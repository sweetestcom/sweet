Nvidia is?
Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s an easy question.'>

    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Jensen, thank you so much for being here today.</p>
<p>And I want to get started just with a question that is</p>
<p>really basic, but I think chips have been in the</p>
<p>ecosystem a lot more lately, and there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>who probably didn&rsquo;t even really know what a</p>
<p>semiconductor was a few years ago.</p>
<p>Can you give me a very basic definition of what</p>
<p>Nvidia is?</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s an easy question.</p>
<p>Well, we are a technology company that processes</p>
<p>software. For applications and domains of science that</p>
<p>are barely possible without us.</p>
<p>And so because of what we do, we can make what is</p>
<p>barely possible, possible.</p>
<p>Or we can make something that is very energy</p>
<p>consuming, very energy efficient.</p>
<p>Or we could turn something that costs a lot of money</p>
<p>and make it much more affordable. And so we</p>
<p>created this thing called accelerated computing, and</p>
<p>that was what we pioneered about three decades ago.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s taken until now to really take off.</p>
<p>In the early days at Denny&rsquo;s with Chris and Curtis, the</p>
<p>dream was probably simpler.</p>
<p>Can you explain what it what your first dream was,</p>
<p>what the vision was, even though now it&rsquo;s come so far</p>
<p>to be this accelerated computing company?</p>
<p>Well, at the time, if you go back 30 years, at the time</p>
<p>the PC revolution was just starting.</p>
<p>The microprocessor was starting to take off.</p>
<p>The CPU was starting to take off.</p>
<p>And there was quite a bit of debate about: what is the</p>
<p>future of computing and how should software be run?</p>
<p>And there was a large camp, and rightfully so, that</p>
<p>believed that CPU or general purpose software was</p>
<p>the best way to go and it was the best way to go for a</p>
<p>long time. We felt, however, that there was a</p>
<p>class of applications that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without</p>
<p>acceleration.</p>
<p>Or you couldn&rsquo;t make it affordable enough for</p>
<p>everybody to enjoy without acceleration.</p>
<p>And so we started this accelerator company, this</p>
<p>accelerated computing company, to solve those</p>
<p>problems. In the beginning, there weren&rsquo;t that many</p>
<p>applications for it, frankly, and we smartly</p>
<p>chose one particular combination that was a home</p>
<p>run. It was computer graphics, and we applied it</p>
<p>to video games.</p>
<p>And that combination turned out to have been a giant</p>
<p>industry. And now video games is the largest</p>
<p>industry in the world and the largest entertainment</p>
<p>industry in the world.</p>
<p>And it drove our technology for three decades because</p>
<p>making video games more and more realistic, making it</p>
<p>available to more people, took a long time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still in that journey and frankly,</p>
<p>probably early in that journey.</p>
<p>There are now probably, you know, over a billion gamers</p>
<p>in the world, but there are 8 billion people.</p>
<p>Someday everybody&rsquo;s going to be a gamer.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s going to be the largest by far entertainment</p>
<p>industry. And so it turned out to have been a fantastic</p>
<p>technology driver for our company.</p>
<p>And we step-by-step added more and more things that we</p>
<p>could do, to today, artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Beyond gaming and graphics, Nvidia has grown immensely.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of things people might be</p>
<p>surprised to hear are powered by Nvidia.</p>
<p>Can you just give a very simple list of some of the</p>
<p>use cases and big name customers that people might</p>
<p>be surprised to hear are powered by Nvidia?</p>
<p>People would probably be surprised that the most</p>
<p>powerful and energy efficient supercomputers in</p>
<p>the world, that are used for molecular dynamic</p>
<p>simulations to climate science research to material</p>
<p>science research to quantum computing research, are</p>
<p>powered by Nvidia.</p>
<p>All the way to the other extreme: a whole bunch of</p>
<p>robots that are powered by Nvidia in manufacturing</p>
<p>lines. Self-driving cars that are powered by Nvidia</p>
<p>to the Nintendo Switch that I&rsquo;m very proud of that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>powered by Nvidia. So we&rsquo;re in very powerful systems and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in very energy efficient systems.</p>
<p>And probably one of the most talked about systems</p>
<p>today are the systems at the Microsoft Azure data</p>
<p>centers that are powering ChatGPT.</p>
<p>And the work that we did with OpenAI in the very</p>
<p>beginning to now that Powers ChatGPT.</p>
<p>I think those are really quite exciting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to come back to ChatGPT for sure, but first</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you about betting it all.</p>
<p>This is something that you have not shied away from in</p>
<p>the 30 years since you started the company.</p>
<p>It was maybe seven times that you&rsquo;ve been reinvented</p>
<p>and faced, you know, success or utter failure.</p>
<p>What is the lesson here?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re in a really fast moving industry.</p>
<p>You know, technology is incredible in the sense that</p>
<p>such enormous challenges and problems could be solved</p>
<p>by computing, on the one hand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the technology changes.</p>
<p>And there are so many great companies in the world and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re pursuing very similar aspirations.</p>
<p>We want to solve the world&rsquo;s greatest challenges.</p>
<p>And so every now and then, a technology revolution</p>
<p>comes along. We were started in the PC</p>
<p>revolution. After that, the Internet revolution came and</p>
<p>all of a sudden the companies before it, some of</p>
<p>them didn&rsquo;t make it to the revolution.</p>
<p>And some great new companies like Google and others got</p>
<p>invented during that time.</p>
<p>And then the cloud computing revolution came.</p>
<p>And then the mobile cloud computing revolution came.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re talking about the AI revolution.</p>
<p>And so each one of these transitions, it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>unlikely that the companies that were great before it</p>
<p>are still great after it.</p>
<p>And there are some companies that have made the</p>
<p>ability to, because of their adaptability and</p>
<p>agility, reinvented themselves along the way.</p>
<p>We had to reinvent ourselves in each one of</p>
<p>those technology revolutions.</p>
<p>And, you know, agility is just really, really, really</p>
<p>important to companies.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I&rsquo;m really proud about our</p>
<p>company is, at the core of our company is incredible</p>
<p>technology. We have incredible technologists.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re pioneering one of the most</p>
<p>important computing platforms in the world, from</p>
<p>use for scientific computing to genomics to</p>
<p>digital biology, all the way to video games, well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need incredible computer</p>
<p>scientists. So on the one hand, we&rsquo;re incredibly</p>
<p>technology rich.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we&rsquo;re in an enormous, we&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>giant sea of technology companies.</p>
<p>And so the ability for us to adapt and reinvent</p>
<p>ourselves and continue to be relevant and from one</p>
<p>generation to another generation was really</p>
<p>important. And I&rsquo;m very proud of that.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t always been success.</p>
<p>Can you talk to me about some of the biggest stumbles</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve had to overcome in the years?</p>
<p>Well, you know, every company makes mistakes and I</p>
<p>make a lot of them.</p>
<p>And, you know, some of them puts the company in peril,</p>
<p>especially in the beginning, because we were</p>
<p>small and were up against very, very large companies</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to invent this brand new technology.</p>
<p>And, you know, when you invent something new, you</p>
<p>have to convince customers to use it.</p>
<p>You have to convince the ecosystem it&rsquo;s the right</p>
<p>thing to use. And you&rsquo;ve got developers, you know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a computing company, so developers matter a lot</p>
<p>to us. And so we&rsquo;re trying to invent something new and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re barely, we barely know exactly what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing, you know?</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re doing something that&rsquo;s never been</p>
<p>done before, you&rsquo;re not exactly sure what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing. And yet, on the other hand, you have these</p>
<p>giant companies who would like you not to disrupt the</p>
<p>industry. And so early on, there were product mistakes</p>
<p>that we made.</p>
<p>There were, you know, execution challenges that we</p>
<p>had. There were some strategy mistakes that I</p>
<p>made. And, you know, there&rsquo;s just so many of</p>
<p>them. And, you know, one of the skills of resilience is</p>
<p>the ability to forget the past.</p>
<p>You know, just as coaches tell you, don&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>the last down, worry about the next down.</p>
<p>And so I tried to make sure that the company remembers</p>
<p>our learnings from the mistakes.</p>
<p>Most founders would be very satisfied being at the helm</p>
<p>of such a huge industry with gaming graphics.</p>
<p>What signaled to you, and when, that it wasn&rsquo;t enough?</p>
<p>Well, our ambition was always to be a computing</p>
<p>platform company.</p>
<p>We selected computer graphics and video games as</p>
<p>our first market combination: technology,</p>
<p>market, product technology and market combination.</p>
<p>But we always believed that accelerated computing</p>
<p>was going to be impactful for many, many different</p>
<p>industries. We expanded from video games into</p>
<p>design. And today just about every product that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>designed or every digital asset or movie or, you know,</p>
<p>almost anything that&rsquo;s designed in 2D or 3D</p>
<p>digitally uses Nvidia somehow.</p>
<p>And then we extended that into scientific computing,</p>
<p>into physical simulation.</p>
<p>And it started with seismic processing, as a field</p>
<p>called inverse physics, to particle simulations,</p>
<p>molecular dynamic simulations, and so on and</p>
<p>so forth, and fluids.</p>
<p>And just about every field of science we&rsquo;re in today.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m really proud of that.</p>
<p>And that led us to a much more general purpose type of</p>
<p>accelerated computing that we created.</p>
<p>Which then, one day, artificial intelligence</p>
<p>found us.</p>
<p>You know, this is one of the things that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>amazing about a computing platform.</p>
<p>You have a vision about what you want to create.</p>
<p>And for whatever reason, you differentiate in your</p>
<p>computing approach.</p>
<p>And maybe you made it super convenient in the cloud.</p>
<p>Maybe you made it possible for you to keep the computer</p>
<p>with you all the time: mobile cloud.</p>
<p>And in our case, accelerated computing makes it possible</p>
<p>for you to solve problems that were impossible</p>
<p>before, or much more energy efficient than before.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a fundamental reason that</p>
<p>makes a new computing architecture successful.</p>
<p>And at some point, the positive feedback system</p>
<p>starts to work. You know, you reach now a lot of</p>
<p>different customers and different applications.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in every cloud, made by every computer company,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden one day a new application</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t possible before discovers you.</p>
<p>First you discover them, and then pretty soon they</p>
<p>discover you. And this positive feedback system</p>
<p>starts to feed on itself.</p>
<p>I assume you&rsquo;re talking about the moment with</p>
<p>AlexNet and CUDA powering that, and sort of the big</p>
<p>bang of AI, if you will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious how much of that you feel like was luck?</p>
<p>I mean, what you&rsquo;re talking about is it finding you.</p>
<p>It sounds a bit like luck.</p>
<p>And how much of it was foresight?</p>
<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t foresight.</p>
<p>The foresight was accelerated computing.</p>
<p>The foresight was making this architecture exactly</p>
<p>the same for everybody.</p>
<p>Having the discipline of staying true to that</p>
<p>platform for generation after generation after</p>
<p>generation, believing that eventually our install base</p>
<p>would be so large that not only would we have reach,</p>
<p>but applications would therefore be enabled by us.</p>
<p>New entire applications that weren&rsquo;t possible before</p>
<p>would discover us.</p>
<p>This is the nature of cloud.</p>
<p>This was the nature of PC.</p>
<p>This was the nature of mobile cloud.</p>
<p>And each one of these revolutions and generations</p>
<p>of technology. In the beginning there was some</p>
<p>fundamental reason it was successful, and then at some</p>
<p>point it achieves a bit of a escape velocity and it</p>
<p>becomes exponential because these applications start to</p>
<p>be enabled by you and they come and discover you.</p>
<p>And so we made a lot of great decisions.</p>
<p>And the great decisions associated with the</p>
<p>architecture and discipline of the platform and</p>
<p>evangelizing it to everybody.</p>
<p>And we reached out to research universities all</p>
<p>over the world. And we just believed that some day</p>
<p>something new would happen.</p>
<p>The rest of it requires some serendipity.</p>
<p>But the part that was really wonderful was when we</p>
<p>realized that AlexNet is not just some neural</p>
<p>network, but it&rsquo;s a whole new way of doing software.</p>
<p>AlexNet is profound in that way.</p>
<p>Not only was it a giant breakthrough in computer</p>
<p>vision, it was also a profoundly new way of doing</p>
<p>software. Some people call it software 2.0, where the</p>
<p>machine augments the software programmers and the</p>
<p>data writes the software.</p>
<p>Instead of humans typing in a software program, the data</p>
<p>creates the software.</p>
<p>That way of using experience or data to cause</p>
<p>a software to be able to make future predictions was</p>
<p>so profound, and we had the good wisdom to go put the</p>
<p>whole company behind it.</p>
<p>We saw early on, about a decade or so ago that this</p>
<p>way of doing software could change everything.</p>
<p>All of the software that we&rsquo;ve wanted to write that</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know how to write, we can now do.</p>
<p>And that was a great decision.</p>
<p>And we changed the company from the bottom all the way</p>
<p>to the top and sideways.</p>
<p>Every chip that we made was focused on artificial</p>
<p>intelligence. We built a wonderful research</p>
<p>organization dedicated to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Our entire software stack was invented for AI and and</p>
<p>then all the things that we did to create large systems</p>
<p>and networks.</p>
<p>Which then became this thing called an AI supercomputer.</p>
<p>And I remember delivering my very first AI</p>
<p>supercomputer. I hand delivered it myself.</p>
<p>I delivered it to OpenAI.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s very first AI supercomputer was delivered</p>
<p>to OpenAI.</p>
<p>What year was that?</p>
<p>Well, I guess it&rsquo;s like five, six years ago, I</p>
<p>guess. Five years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And now here we are and OpenAI has taken the world</p>
<p>by storm. Do you think that your products, Nvidia, is at</p>
<p>the very center of this and has become the must-have</p>
<p>products to power this next big step?</p>
<p>Well we&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s engine for AI.</p>
<p>Because of the decisions we made a decade or so ago, and</p>
<p>we put so much of our might and expertise into it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now in every cloud.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in every country and every field of science.</p>
<p>35,000 companies use our AI computers to develop and</p>
<p>advance this field.</p>
<p>Giant companies like cloud and internet companies, all</p>
<p>the way to startups.</p>
<p>Thousands of startups.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in all kinds of areas: consumer internet to</p>
<p>digital biology to robotics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy with the diffusion of the technology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really pleased with how we&rsquo;ve democratized the</p>
<p>technology so that anybody can access it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t ignore the incredible vision and</p>
<p>dedication to the work at OpenAI.</p>
<p>From the very first day I saw them, they were</p>
<p>dedicated to wanting to do this and they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>focused on it for five years.</p>
<p>And of course in research, even longer than that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of the work that they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Yeah really terrific team.</p>
<p>Here in Silicon Valley, there&rsquo;s a bunch of CEOs and</p>
<p>founders who&rsquo;ve started bringing up the A100 and</p>
<p>kind of publicly competing with each other about who</p>
<p>bought more when and who saw this coming.</p>
<p>Sort of competing for bragging rights around the</p>
<p>A100. What would you want to say to them?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more. Come get them.</p>
<p>Everybody should win.</p>
<p>You know, winners to all.</p>
<p>In the past, when you start a company, a software</p>
<p>company or technology company, you need a lot of</p>
<p>software engineers.</p>
<p>It is still true and you need amazing computer</p>
<p>scientists. But today, startups - and there are</p>
<p>some amazing startups that we&rsquo;re working with right now</p>
<ul>
<li>where they&rsquo;re 25, 30 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Backed up with a large data center of AI supercomputers</p>
<p>powered by A100s.</p>
<p>If you want to start a startup today, it&rsquo;s you and</p>
<p>AI. And you&rsquo;re supercharged by the AI supercomputer and</p>
<p>the algorithms that you have inside and all the data</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to teach it with.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really quite a transformation in how</p>
<p>startups are going to get built in the future.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re onto something even larger than that, you</p>
<p>know, built on these AI supercomputers, these large</p>
<p>language models. It&rsquo;s definitely a watershed event</p>
<p>for the AI industry.</p>
<p>It feels very much like the iPhone moment, when mobile</p>
<p>cloud really took off and all of the environmental</p>
<p>conditions feel exactly the same way, just larger and</p>
<p>much, much more industries.</p>
<p>Right now, generative AI is still extremely expensive to</p>
<p>accomplish. How do you think it&rsquo;ll really take off</p>
<p>if only a couple big companies have true access</p>
<p>to do it at scale?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it doesn&rsquo;t cost that much.</p>
<p>And the reason why there are so many CEOs with</p>
<p>bragging rights on so many A100s is because it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>quite democratized.</p>
<p>We took what otherwise would be a $1 billion data</p>
<p>center running CPUs and we shrunk it down into a data</p>
<p>center of $100 million.</p>
<p>Now $100 million is, when you put that in the cloud</p>
<p>and shared by 100 companies, is almost</p>
<p>nothing. If you take a look at how much it costs to</p>
<p>design a chip, so you put that in perspective, it</p>
<p>costs us about $2 to $3 billion to design A100.</p>
<p>When I hit enter and asked TSMC to help us make it,</p>
<p>that email is $100 million.</p>
<p>And then it populates these AI supercomputer data</p>
<p>centers. And when you train a large language model,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it costs $10 million.</p>
<p>So a chip, and there are 3,000 chip companies in the</p>
<p>world, taping out a chip is like $100 million or $50</p>
<p>million, $30 million, depending on the size, but</p>
<p>nothing less than $10 million.</p>
<p>And now you could build something like a large</p>
<p>language model, like a ChatGPT for something like</p>
<p>$10, $20 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, really affordable.</p>
<p>And so I think the the ability for every industry</p>
<p>to create their foundation model: there&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>protein foundation model, a chemical foundation model.</p>
<p>There will be a robotics foundation model.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be foundation models for science, for</p>
<p>finance, for all kinds of different applications and</p>
<p>different industries and different countries.</p>
<p>I was just in Sweden and the Berzelius supercomputer</p>
<p>there, we helped them with. We built an AI</p>
<p>supercomputer. It&rsquo;s a Swedish foundation model</p>
<p>supercomputer. And with just tens of millions of</p>
<p>dollars, you can build the most powerful supercomputer</p>
<p>in Sweden. And so these are really, really accessible</p>
<p>technologies now.</p>
<p>There are always skeptics and people who are alarmed,</p>
<p>perhaps, by how fast AI is taking off and how powerful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become with capabilities like deepfakes,</p>
<p>fake eye contact, for instance, that I&rsquo;ve seen an</p>
<p>example of. What do you say to them?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing that everybody should do is to</p>
<p>take advantage of the technology and to boost</p>
<p>their own capability.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that the interest behind ChatGPT</p>
<p>has been so great.</p>
<p>It is the fastest growing application in the world,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been used in all kinds of different ways.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s really amazing about artificial</p>
<p>intelligence is that what ChatGPT has shown is that it</p>
<p>has eliminated the digital and the technology divide.</p>
<p>Everyone is a programmer now.</p>
<p>Everybody could program a computer.</p>
<p>During my generation, the way that you program a</p>
<p>computer was: started with Basic and I learned Fortran.</p>
<p>Then you learn C and then you move to C++ and Java and</p>
<p>now PyTorch or Python.</p>
<p>And each one of those languages, there was Ooc,</p>
<p>and these are really weird languages and they&rsquo;re hard</p>
<p>to learn. And the whole time that we&rsquo;ve been making</p>
<p>computers more and more capable, the technology</p>
<p>became harder and harder to use.</p>
<p>And the technology divide arguably has been growing,</p>
<p>until artificial intelligence. And you hear</p>
<p>about cucumber farmers who are teaching a robot how to</p>
<p>sort cucumbers.</p>
<p>And a high school student did that for his mom.</p>
<p>And now 150 million people are programing the</p>
<p>computer, instead of programing the computer with</p>
<p>C or Python, you&rsquo;re now programing the computer with</p>
<p>anybody&rsquo;s plain language.</p>
<p>And you tell this computer what you want to do.</p>
<p>And this computer goes off and does it.</p>
<p>Or you tell the computer you&rsquo;d like to write a Python</p>
<p>script, and it goes off and does it.</p>
<p>And so this capability has democratized computing for</p>
<p>the very first time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s put technology, very powerful technology, in the</p>
<p>hands of anybody who would like to use it.</p>
<p>And so I think this is really genuinely the first</p>
<p>time in my generation that we&rsquo;ve created something, or</p>
<p>contributed to creating something, that made our</p>
<p>technology accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Not just to use, but to harness.</p>
<p>Not just to use, but to program.</p>
<p>And so I think every domain expert in the world will be</p>
<p>able to do that. And I recommend everybody just,</p>
<p>number one, take advantage of AI and augment your work</p>
<p>. Make yourself more productive.</p>
<p>Lift yourself, you know, power up.</p>
<p>Power up your own career, power up your own</p>
<p>capability. And then from there, you know, increase</p>
<p>the productivity of society and move everything along.</p>
<p>How do you stay ahead in an industry where some of your</p>
<p>customers could become your competitors?</p>
<p>You know, speaking about Google&rsquo;s TPUs and Amazon has</p>
<p>their own internal chips as well.</p>
<p>How do you stay ahead in that landscape?</p>
<p>We stay ahead by, number one, doing it very well.</p>
<p>But also we do it very differently.</p>
<p>The first thing that I would say is that every data</p>
<p>center in the world should accelerate every workload</p>
<p>they can. And the reason for that is because, as you</p>
<p>know, the world&rsquo;s data centers consume a lot of</p>
<p>power now. And it used to be the case that because of</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s Law, even though we required more computing</p>
<p>throughput every year, the amount of power that the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s data centers consume didn&rsquo;t grow that</p>
<p>fast. And the reason for that is because Moore&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>But now that&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>That has ended.</p>
<p>And as a result, if we want to increase the amount of</p>
<p>computing throughput we want, and there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>question that&rsquo;s happening, then the amount of power</p>
<p>that the world needs in the data center will grow.</p>
<p>And you can see in the recent trends, it&rsquo;s growing</p>
<p>very quickly and that&rsquo;s a real issue for the world.</p>
<p>The first thing that we should do is: every data</p>
<p>center in the world, however you decide to do it,</p>
<p>for the goodness of sustainable computing,</p>
<p>accelerate everything you can.</p>
<p>Now, an ASIC is designed to be application specific.</p>
<p>It does nothing, it does exactly that and it does it</p>
<p>very well. What Nvidia does is a general purpose</p>
<p>accelerated computing platform.</p>
<p>So we could, on the one hand, simulate climate</p>
<p>science. On the other hand do robotics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, do large language models or computer</p>
<p>graphics and play video games and such.</p>
<p>And so our ability to be flexible, versatile and also</p>
<p>extremely performant lets us increase the versatility</p>
<p>and the utility, the utilization of it, inside</p>
<p>data center. When you build an infrastructure, the most</p>
<p>important thing for you is utilization.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t afford to have hotels that are occupied</p>
<p>30%. You would like the data center even more so</p>
<p>because it cost billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s accelerated computing platform lets you</p>
<p>have versatility and utilization.</p>
<p>So our TCO, our cost, is actually the lowest of all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason why people use it: because they</p>
<p>can use it on so many things. The second reason is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in every cloud.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re an enterprise customer or a</p>
<p>developer or a startup company and you would like</p>
<p>to have the ability to operate your service in</p>
<p>every cloud or any cloud across the world, we make it</p>
<p>possible for you to do it in every cloud: on prem,</p>
<p>hybrid cloud, all the way out to the edge.</p>
<p>One architecture.</p>
<p>What do you say to gamers who wish you had kept focus</p>
<p>entirely on the core business of gaming?</p>
<p>Well, if not for all of our work in physics simulation,</p>
<p>if not for all of our research in artificial</p>
<p>intelligence, what we did recently with GeForce RTX</p>
<p>would not have been possible. We invented the</p>
<p>GPU and programable shader 25 years ago, a quarter of a</p>
<p>century ago, and it&rsquo;s remained basically the same</p>
<p>for the last 25 years.</p>
<p>About five years ago, we came to the conclusion that</p>
<p>in order for us to take computer graphics and video</p>
<p>games to the next level, we had to reinvent and disrupt</p>
<p>ourselves.</p>
<p>Change literally what we invented altogether.</p>
<p>And so we invented this new way of doing computer</p>
<p>graphics: ray tracing, and basically simulating the</p>
<p>pathways of light and simulate everything with</p>
<p>generative AI.</p>
<p>And so we compute one pixel and we imagine with AI</p>
<p>the other seven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite amazing.</p>
<p>Imagine a jigsaw puzzle and we gave you one out of eight</p>
<p>pieces and somehow the AI filled in the rest.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing.</p>
<p>And so as a result, we increased the performance of</p>
<p>what made possible ray tracing.</p>
<p>We increased the performance by probably a</p>
<p>factor of five.</p>
<p>Or another way to think about that: we reduced the</p>
<p>amount of energy consumed by a factor of five.</p>
<p>And so that great invention completely revolutionized</p>
<p>video games. And the next 25 years, because of what we</p>
<p>did, I think we have 25 years of amazing future.</p>
<p>Just a couple of questions about the state of the</p>
<p>industry. Experts seem to say the worst of the chip</p>
<p>shortage is over.</p>
<p>How did Nvidia weather that storm?</p>
<p>The chip shortage was a strange one.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there was chip shortage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, about the same time, you know,</p>
<p>this is now, we&rsquo;re now coming out of it.</p>
<p>But some two or three quarters ago, we had supply</p>
<p>challenges and demand challenges at the same time</p>
<p>. But not at the same customer.</p>
<p>Not in the same industry.</p>
<p>Not in the same market.</p>
<p>And so that was very, very challenging: to have your</p>
<p>foot on the gas and your foot on the brakes at</p>
<p>exactly the same time and full pressure on both.</p>
<p>Our company weathered it just fine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a strong and resilient company.</p>
<p>Our financial performance wasn&rsquo;t as good as our</p>
<p>technology and contribution performance.</p>
<p>We did some of our best work ever in the history of</p>
<p>our company. A100 was replaced by H100, which</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in full production now.</p>
<p>All the work that we did with AI supercomputing and</p>
<p>RTX ray tracing and all of that came out during this</p>
<p>time. Meanwhile, our financial performance wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>very good. And so I think the lesson there is: focus</p>
<p>on doing your good work and things will work out for</p>
<p>itself. And so I&rsquo;m really, really pleased with the</p>
<p>company and the work that everybody&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>And going forward, I think it&rsquo;s starting to ease up</p>
<p>now. I think we&rsquo;re starting to have a lot less inventory</p>
<p>in channels. And the industry has more capacity</p>
<p>and more flexibility and we&rsquo;re moving nicely into the</p>
<p>next generation nodes.</p>
<p>And so almost everything is starting to to get better.</p>
<p>What about a price slump?</p>
<p>Does that worry you?</p>
<p>Everything that we build is rather singular.</p>
<p>And the markets that we serve aren&rsquo;t commodity</p>
<p>markets. You know, right now, more than any time, the</p>
<p>investment needed in AI is just off the charts.</p>
<p>Generative AI, this is the moment that we&rsquo;ve all been</p>
<p>working for in the last ten years.</p>
<p>And now AI is about to be used to revolutionize</p>
<p>digital biology and genomics and transportation</p>
<p>and retail and all these different industries.</p>
<p>search. And everything about the situation we&rsquo;re in right</p>
<p>now is really about growth and really about getting</p>
<p>into the next phase of computing.</p>
<p>And AI is at the center of that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m super excited about the moment we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that we take advantage of it and</p>
<p>capitalize on it.</p>
<p>The vast majority of your chips are made by TSMC.</p>
<p>How have you insulated against geopolitical risks</p>
<p>of the region in the case that the &ldquo;Silicon shield&rdquo;</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hold.</p>
<p>As a company, our first priority is to make sure</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re as resilient as possible.</p>
<p>And in every area that we can, to be as resilient</p>
<p>through diversity and redundancy as much as we can</p>
<p>. In semiconductor design tools, the manufacturing of</p>
<p>our chips, packaging, memory, systems.</p>
<p>The systems that we build, AI supercomputers, these</p>
<p>things are like cars.</p>
<p>They weigh 350 pounds per computer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the heaviest computers that humans make.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got tens of thousands of unique parts.</p>
<p>And so we try to engineer and design, into everything</p>
<p>that we do, diversity and redundancy.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is TSMC is a really important</p>
<p>company. This is a really special company.</p>
<p>And the world doesn&rsquo;t have more than one of them.</p>
<p>It is imperative upon ourselves and them, also</p>
<p>invest in diversity and redundancy.</p>
<p>And the move that they made recently in building the fab</p>
<p>in Arizona is a very big deal.</p>
<p>Will you be moving any of your manufacturing to</p>
<p>Arizona?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely. We&rsquo;ll use Arizona.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s really great about TSMC is every</p>
<p>mask runs everywhere and so they have the ability to use</p>
<p>all the various fabs for the masks that we have.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m excited about the investments that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making so that the entire world can count on them for</p>
<p>diversity and redundancy.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a really special company.</p>
<p>About a quarter of your revenue comes from mainland</p>
<p>China. How do you calm investor fears over the new</p>
<p>export controls?</p>
<p>Well, Nvidia&rsquo;s technology is export controlled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reflection of the importance of the technology</p>
<p>that we make. The first thing that we have to do is</p>
<p>comply with the regulations. It was a</p>
<p>turbulent, you know, month or so as the company went</p>
<p>upside down to reengineer all of our products so that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s compliant with the regulation and yet still be</p>
<p>able to serve the commercial customers that we</p>
<p>have in China. We&rsquo;re able to serve our customers in</p>
<p>China with the regulated parts and delightfully</p>
<p>support them. And so I think we&rsquo;re going to be just</p>
<p>fine in the ability to serve the customers there.</p>
<p>The customers that we have there are consumer companies</p>
<p>and consumer internet companies. And the</p>
<p>regulation is going to be just fine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be able to work through it.</p>
<p>You are famous for reinvention.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next one going to be?</p>
<p>The next big reinvention is probably where AI meets the</p>
<p>physical world.</p>
<p>And today, all of our AI experiences are related to</p>
<p>digital. It&rsquo;s in software.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all digital-related Al.</p>
<p>The next generation of AI, and where AI meets $100</p>
<p>trillion of the world&rsquo;s industry, that&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>physical world. And so it could be transportation.</p>
<p>It could be robotic surgery .</p>
<p>It could be warehouses and manufacturing plant and</p>
<p>energy plants and fabrication plants and so on</p>
<p>and so forth. And in order for us to bring digital</p>
<p>technology and artificial intelligence technology into</p>
<p>that physical world where humans are, and safety is</p>
<p>important and resilience is important, and all of those</p>
<p>kind of physical world physics-related challenges,</p>
<p>we need a new type of software.</p>
<p>And we created this thing called Omniverse that</p>
<p>allows us to connect the digital world and the</p>
<p>physical world. And Omniverse is going to be a</p>
<p>phenomenal success.</p>
<p>And we have 700-plus customers who are trying it</p>
<p>now. And from car industry to logistics warehouse to,</p>
<p>you know, wind turbine plants.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m really excited about the progress there.</p>
<p>And it represents probably the single greatest</p>
<p>container of all of Nvidia&rsquo;s technology:</p>
<p>computer graphics, artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>robotics and physics simulation all into one.</p>
<p>I have great hopes for it.</p>
<p>This is the last one. Just on a personal note, you are</p>
<p>the longest running tech CEO.</p>
<p>Is there any end in sight?</p>
<p>Well, as you can tell, I&rsquo;m sprightly and quite</p>
<p>enthusiastic and energetic yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surrounded by amazing people.</p>
<p>They keep me inspired and I feel that we could do great</p>
<p>things together. They give me so much confidence in</p>
<p>what we can do and the impact we can make.</p>
<p>And I feel that I&rsquo;m making a real contribution to the</p>
<p>company and to them, and to create an environment where</p>
<p>we can make really amazing contributions.</p>
<p>And so I think for so long as I believe I could do</p>
<p>that, and I don&rsquo;t know exactly how long that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be. But three or four decades, I would say.</p>
<p>In another four decades, I&rsquo;ll be robotic and, maybe</p>
<p>another three or four decades after that.</p>
<p>And so hopefully, I&rsquo;ll get to enjoy this for a very</p>
<p>long time.</p>
<p>Wonderful. Well, thank you for today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you, Katie.</p>
