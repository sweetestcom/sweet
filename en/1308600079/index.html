    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are talking about</p>
<p>obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about</p>
<p>obsessive compulsive personality disorder,</p>
<p>which, as you will soon learn,</p>
<p>is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>In fact, many people that refer to themselves or others</p>
<p>as obsessive or compulsive, or quote-unquote having OCD,</p>
<p>or OCD about this, or OCD about that,</p>
<p>do not have clinically diagnosable OCD.</p>
<p>Rather, many people have</p>
<p>obsessive compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>However, there are many people in the world</p>
<p>that have actual OCD.</p>
<p>And for those people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of suffering.</p>
<p>In fact, OCD turns out to be number seven</p>
<p>on the list of most debilitating illnesses,</p>
<p>not just psychiatric illnesses, but of all illnesses,</p>
<p>which is remarkable and somewhat frightening.</p>
<p>The good news is, thanks to the fields of psychiatry,</p>
<p>psychology, and science in general,</p>
<p>there are now excellent treatments for OCD.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about those treatments today.</p>
<p>Those treatments range from behavioral therapies</p>
<p>to drug therapies and brain stimulation,</p>
<p>and even some of the more holistic or natural therapies.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll soon learn, for certain people,</p>
<p>they may want to focus more on the behavioral therapies,</p>
<p>whereas for others, more on the drug-based therapies,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>One extremely interesting and important thing</p>
<p>I learned from this episode</p>
<p>is that the particular sequence that behavioral</p>
<p>and or drug and or holistic therapies are applied</p>
<p>is extremely important.</p>
<p>In fact, the outcomes of studies often depend</p>
<p>on whether or not people start on drug treatment</p>
<p>and then follow with cognitive behavioral treatment</p>
<p>or vice versa.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go into all those details</p>
<p>and how they relate to different types of OCD,</p>
<p>because it turns out there are indeed different types</p>
<p>of obsessions and compulsions,</p>
<p>and the age of onset for OCD, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>What I can assure you is by the end of this episode,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a much greater understanding</p>
<p>of what OCD is and what it isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and what obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is</p>
<p>and what it is not,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have a rich array</p>
<p>of different therapy options to explore</p>
<p>in yourself or in others that are suffering from OCD.</p>
<p>And if neither you or others that you know</p>
<p>suffer from OCD</p>
<p>or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,</p>
<p>the information covered in today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>will also provide insight</p>
<p>into how the brain and nervous system</p>
<p>translate thought into action generally.</p>
<p>And also you&rsquo;re going to learn a lot</p>
<p>about goal-directed behavior generally.</p>
<p>My hope is that by the end of the episode,</p>
<p>you will both understand a lot about this disease state</p>
<p>that we call OCD.</p>
<p>You will have access to information</p>
<p>that will allow you to direct treatments</p>
<p>to yourself or others in better ways,</p>
<p>and that you will gain greater insight</p>
<p>into how you function</p>
<p>and how human beings function in general.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce</p>
<p>that we partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, the quality of their supplements</p>
<p>is exceedingly high.</p>
<p>Second of all, we wanted to have a location</p>
<p>where you could find all of the supplements</p>
<p>discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>in one easy-to-find place.</p>
<p>You can now find that place at livemomentus.com</p>
<p>slash Huberman.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentus Supplements ship internationally,</p>
<p>something that a lot of other supplement companies</p>
<p>simply do not do.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s terrific whether or not you live in the US</p>
<p>or you live abroad.</p>
<p>Right now, not all of the supplements</p>
<p>that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed,</p>
<p>but that catalog of supplements</p>
<p>is being expanded very rapidly.</p>
<p>And a good number of them that we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus</p>
<p>and other aspects of mental and physical health</p>
<p>are already there.</p>
<p>Again, you can find them at livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about OCD or obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>First of all, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>OCD includes thoughts or obsessions</p>
<p>and compulsions, which are actions.</p>
<p>The obsessions and the compulsions are often linked.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the time,</p>
<p>the obsessions and the compulsions are linked</p>
<p>such that the compulsion, the behavior,</p>
<p>is designed to relieve the obsession.</p>
<p>However, one of the hallmark themes</p>
<p>of obsessive compulsive disorder</p>
<p>is that the obsessions are intrusive.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to have them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t enjoy having them.</p>
<p>They just seem to pop into people&rsquo;s minds,</p>
<p>and they seem to pop into their mind recurrently.</p>
<p>And the compulsions, unlike other sorts of behaviors,</p>
<p>provide brief relief to the obsession,</p>
<p>but then very quickly reinforce or strengthen the obsession.</p>
<p>This is a very key theme to realize</p>
<p>about obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to repeat it again.</p>
<p>These two features, first,</p>
<p>the fact that the obsessions are intrusive and recurrent,</p>
<p>as well as the fact that the compulsions,</p>
<p>the behaviors, provide, if anything,</p>
<p>only brief relief for the obsessions,</p>
<p>but in most cases simply serve</p>
<p>to make the obsession stronger,</p>
<p>are the hallmark features of obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>And it turns out to be very important</p>
<p>to keep these in mind as we go forward,</p>
<p>not just because they define obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>but they also define the sorts of treatments</p>
<p>that will and will not work</p>
<p>for obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>And then once you understand a little bit</p>
<p>about the neural circuitry</p>
<p>underlying obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a few moments,</p>
<p>then you will clearly understand</p>
<p>why being a quote-unquote obsessive person</p>
<p>or having obsessive compulsive personality</p>
<p>is not the same as OCD.</p>
<p>In fact, we can leap ahead a little bit</p>
<p>and compare and contrast OCD</p>
<p>with obsessive compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>along one very particular set of features.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll go into this in more detail later,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fair to say that OCD is characterized</p>
<p>by these recurrent and intrusive obsessions.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>the fact that those obsessions get stronger</p>
<p>as a function of people performing certain behaviors.</p>
<p>So unlike an itch that you feel</p>
<p>and then you scratch it and it feels better,</p>
<p>OCD is more like an itch that you feel,</p>
<p>you scratch it and the itch intensifies.</p>
<p>That contour or that pattern of behaviors</p>
<p>and thoughts interacting is very different</p>
<p>than obsessive compulsive personality disorder,</p>
<p>which mainly involves a sense of delayed gratification</p>
<p>that people want and somewhat enjoy</p>
<p>because it allows them to function better</p>
<p>or more in line with how they would like</p>
<p>to show up in the world.</p>
<p>So again, OCD has mainly to do with obsessions</p>
<p>that are intrusive and recurrent,</p>
<p>whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>does not have that intrusive feature to it.</p>
<p>People do not mind or in fact,</p>
<p>often invite or like the particular patterns of thought</p>
<p>that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions.</p>
<p>So leaving aside obsessive compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>for the moment, let&rsquo;s focus a bit more on OCD</p>
<p>and define how it tends to show up in the world.</p>
<p>First of all, OCD is extremely common.</p>
<p>In fact, current estimates are that anywhere from 2.5%</p>
<p>to as high as three or even 4% of people suffer</p>
<p>from true OCD.</p>
<p>That is an astonishingly high number.</p>
<p>Now, the reason the range is so big,</p>
<p>2.5% all the way up to three or maybe even 4%</p>
<p>is that a lot of the features of OCD go unnoticed</p>
<p>both in the clinician&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and simply because people don&rsquo;t report it</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>In fact, it is possible to have recurrent</p>
<p>and intrusive obsessions</p>
<p>and not engage in the sorts of behaviors</p>
<p>that would ever allow people to notice</p>
<p>that somebody has OCD.</p>
<p>That can be because some of the intrusive thoughts</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually lead to overt behaviors</p>
<p>like hand-washing or checking</p>
<p>that other people would notice.</p>
<p>It can also be because people learn to disguise</p>
<p>or hide their obsessions and their compulsions</p>
<p>out of shame or fear of looking strange</p>
<p>or whatever it might be,</p>
<p>such that they have these obsessive and intrusive thoughts</p>
<p>and they do little micro behaviors</p>
<p>like they might tap their fingers on their thigh</p>
<p>as a way to avoid, at least in their own mind,</p>
<p>something catastrophic happening.</p>
<p>That might seem crazy to you, it might seem bizarre,</p>
<p>but this is the sort of thing that operates</p>
<p>in a lot of people.</p>
<p>And I really want to emphasize this</p>
<p>because the clinical literature that are out there</p>
<p>really point to the fact that many people have OCD,</p>
<p>full-blown OCD, and never report it</p>
<p>because of the kind of shame and hiding associated with it.</p>
<p>Another thing to point out</p>
<p>is that OCD is extremely debilitating.</p>
<p>I mentioned this a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>but OCD is currently listed as a number seven</p>
<p>in terms of the most debilitating illnesses,</p>
<p>not just mental illnesses or disorders,</p>
<p>but all types of illnesses,</p>
<p>including things like asthma and cancer, et cetera.</p>
<p>So you can imagine with that standing at number seven,</p>
<p>that it is both extremely common and extremely debilitating.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, it&rsquo;s now realized that many hours,</p>
<p>days, weeks, months, or even years of work performance</p>
<p>or showing up at work of relational interactions</p>
<p>really suffer as a consequence of people having OCD.</p>
<p>So this is a vital problem that the scientific</p>
<p>and psychiatric and psychological communities understand.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the reasons that I&rsquo;m doing this podcast.</p>
<p>And of course I received a ton of interest in OCD</p>
<p>because of this incredibly high incidence of OCD</p>
<p>and how debilitating it is.</p>
<p>We could go really deep into why it&rsquo;s so debilitating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time on that</p>
<p>because I think most of that is pretty obvious,</p>
<p>but some of it is not.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the things that makes OCD</p>
<p>so debilitating is of course the shame</p>
<p>that we talked about before,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the fact that when people are focusing</p>
<p>on their obsessions and their compulsions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not able to focus on other things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not able to focus on too many things at once.</p>
<p>The other thing is that OCD takes a lot of time</p>
<p>out of people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>With recurrent intrusive thoughts happening</p>
<p>at very high frequency or even at moderate frequency,</p>
<p>people are spending a lot of time thinking about this stuff.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re thinking about the behaviors</p>
<p>they need to engage in and then engaging in the behaviors,</p>
<p>which as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>just serve to strengthen the compulsions.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re not actually doing the other things</p>
<p>that make us functional human beings,</p>
<p>like commuting to work or doing homework or doing work</p>
<p>or listening when people are talking or interacting</p>
<p>or sports or working out.</p>
<p>All the things that make for a rich quality life</p>
<p>are taken over by OCD in many cases.</p>
<p>So while that might be obvious to some,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s obvious to everybody</p>
<p>just how much time OCD can occupy.</p>
<p>Another thing you&rsquo;ll soon learn is that sadly,</p>
<p>a lot of the obsessions and compulsions in OCD</p>
<p>often relate to taboo topics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the general categories of OCD</p>
<p>fall into three different bins,</p>
<p>checking obsessions and compulsions,</p>
<p>repetition obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>and order obsessions and compulsions.</p>
<p>The checking ones are somewhat obvious,</p>
<p>checking the stove or checking the locks,</p>
<p>which I think we all tend to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody typically I&rsquo;ll head off to the car</p>
<p>to commute to work and I&rsquo;ll think,</p>
<p>I locked the front door and I&rsquo;ll go back once.</p>
<p>But I won&rsquo;t go back twice or 50 times.</p>
<p>People with OCD will often go back 20 or 30 times</p>
<p>before they&rsquo;ll actually allow themselves to drive off.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s a real challenge for them</p>
<p>to continue to drive off and discard with the idea</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t check the stove</p>
<p>or they didn&rsquo;t check the locks</p>
<p>or they didn&rsquo;t check something else critical.</p>
<p>Repetition obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>obviously can dovetail with the checking ones,</p>
<p>but those tend to be things like counting off</p>
<p>of a certain number of numbers,</p>
<p>like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,</p>
<p>seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.</p>
<p>People will perform that repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly</p>
<p>or feel that they have to.</p>
<p>I remember years ago watching a documentary</p>
<p>about the band, the Ramones, right?</p>
<p>Most people heard of the Ramones, right?</p>
<p>Jeans, t-shirts, aviator glasses.</p>
<p>Everyone had to change their last name to Ramone.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t actually all related to one another,</p>
<p>by the way, you had to change your last name to Ramone.</p>
<p>The Ramones had one band member who was admittedly</p>
<p>and known to others as having OCD.</p>
<p>And during that documentary, which I forget the name,</p>
<p>I think it was called, can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Anyway, can&rsquo;t remember, hippocampal lapse there.</p>
<p>But in this documentary,</p>
<p>the band members describe Joey Ramone as leaving hotels,</p>
<p>walking down the stairs to the parking lot,</p>
<p>but then having to walk up and down them seven or eight times</p>
<p>and sometimes getting out of the van again</p>
<p>and walking up and down them seven or eight times.</p>
<p>And it always had to be a certain number of times</p>
<p>given a certain number of stairs.</p>
<p>This appears quote unquote crazy,</p>
<p>but of course we don&rsquo;t want to think of this as crazy.</p>
<p>This is somebody who very likely had full-blown OCD.</p>
<p>Now that particular example, believe it or not,</p>
<p>is not all that uncommon.</p>
<p>It just so happens that that example entailed</p>
<p>certain compulsions and behaviors that were overt</p>
<p>and that other people could see.</p>
<p>And you can imagine how that would prevent somebody</p>
<p>from moving about their daily life easily.</p>
<p>A lot of people, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>have obsessions and compulsions that they hide</p>
<p>and they do these little micro behaviors</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll just count off in their head</p>
<p>as opposed to generating some sort of walking up</p>
<p>and down stairs or tapping or things of that sort.</p>
<p>So we have checking, we have repetition,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>Order oftentimes is thought of as putting cleanliness</p>
<p>or making sure everything is aligned</p>
<p>and perfect and orderly.</p>
<p>And oftentimes that is the case,</p>
<p>but there are other forms of order that people with OCD</p>
<p>can focus on in a obsessive and compulsive way.</p>
<p>Things like incompleteness,</p>
<p>the idea that one can&rsquo;t walk away from something</p>
<p>or stop doing something because something&rsquo;s not right</p>
<p>or complete in that picture.</p>
<p>It could be the way the table is set.</p>
<p>It could be the way that something&rsquo;s written on a page.</p>
<p>It could be an email.</p>
<p>Again, now we&rsquo;re still talking about OCD, the disorder.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about obsessive,</p>
<p>compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of, well, I&rsquo;ll just be direct,</p>
<p>several colleagues of mine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just remarkable the order in their emails.</p>
<p>Every email is perfect, punctuated, perfect.</p>
<p>Grammar, perfect.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s spaced perfect.</p>
<p>Do they have OCD?</p>
<p>Well, they might, they might not.</p>
<p>How would I know unless they disclose that to me?</p>
<p>But they might have obsessive,</p>
<p>compulsive personality disorder,</p>
<p>or they just might be able to generate a lot of order</p>
<p>and they have a lot of discipline around the way they write</p>
<p>and the way they present any communication</p>
<p>with anybody at all.</p>
<p>So if somebody has a OCD that&rsquo;s in the domain of order,</p>
<p>it could be incompleteness and the constant feeling</p>
<p>of something not being completed and a need to complete it.</p>
<p>It can also be in terms of symmetry,</p>
<p>that everything be aligned and symmetric in some way.</p>
<p>This could be seen perhaps in young kids.</p>
<p>This is one example that I read in the literature</p>
<p>of children that need to arrange their stuffed animals</p>
<p>in exact same order every day,</p>
<p>and in a particular order to the point where</p>
<p>if you were to move the little stuffed frog</p>
<p>over next to the stuffed rabbit,</p>
<p>that the child would have an anxiety reaction to that</p>
<p>and feel literally compelled, driven to fix that,</p>
<p>maybe even multiple times over and over again.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about OCD in children</p>
<p>versus adults in a little bit.</p>
<p>And then the other aspect of order,</p>
<p>which is a little bit less than intuitive,</p>
<p>is this notion of disgust.</p>
<p>This idea that something is contaminated.</p>
<p>So we often think about OCD and hand-washing behavior</p>
<p>in response to people feeling</p>
<p>that something is contaminated, a space, a towel, et cetera,</p>
<p>or even simply somebody else&rsquo;s hand,</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re unwilling to shake somebody&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>You can imagine how these different bins of obsessions</p>
<p>and compulsions, checking, repetition, and order</p>
<p>could be extremely debilitating</p>
<p>depending on how severe they are</p>
<p>and how many different domains of life they show up in.</p>
<p>Because oftentimes in movies,</p>
<p>and even the way I&rsquo;m describing it now,</p>
<p>it sounds as if, okay, well, somebody has to check the locks</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have to also check the stove,</p>
<p>or somebody has the need to count to seven back and forth,</p>
<p>up to seven and down to seven,</p>
<p>seven times, seven times a day or something of that sort,</p>
<p>or they need symmetry in very specific domains of life.</p>
<p>But it turns out that this recurrent</p>
<p>and intrusive aspect of obsessions</p>
<p>leads people with OCD to have checking, repetition,</p>
<p>and or order compulsions everywhere.</p>
<p>So whether or not somebody is at work or in school</p>
<p>or trying to engage in sport</p>
<p>or trying to engage in relationship</p>
<p>or just something simple like walking down the street,</p>
<p>the obsessions are so intrusive that they show up</p>
<p>and they compel people to do things in that domain,</p>
<p>independent of whether or not</p>
<p>they happen to be in one location or another.</p>
<p>In other words, the thought patterns and the behaviors</p>
<p>take over the environment as opposed to the environment</p>
<p>driving the thought patterns and behaviors.</p>
<p>So it therefore becomes impossible</p>
<p>to ever find a room that&rsquo;s clean enough,</p>
<p>to find a bed that&rsquo;s made well enough,</p>
<p>to find anything that&rsquo;s done well enough</p>
<p>to remove the obsession.</p>
<p>And I know I&rsquo;ve said it multiple times now,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to say it many times throughout this episode</p>
<p>in a somewhat obsessive, but I believe justified way</p>
<p>that every time that one engages in the compulsion</p>
<p>related to the obsession,</p>
<p>the obsession simply becomes stronger.</p>
<p>So you can imagine what a powerful</p>
<p>and debilitating loop that really is.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s drill a little bit deeper</p>
<p>into how the obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>relate to one another.</p>
<p>If we were to draw a line</p>
<p>between the obsessions and the compulsions,</p>
<p>that line could be described as anxiety.</p>
<p>Now we need to define what anxiety is.</p>
<p>And to be quite honest,</p>
<p>most of psychology and science</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t agree on exactly what anxiety is.</p>
<p>Typically, the way we think about fear</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a heightened state of autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>so increased heart rate, increased breathing,</p>
<p>sweating, et cetera,</p>
<p>in response to an immediate and present threat</p>
<p>or perceived threat.</p>
<p>Whereas anxiety, generally speaking</p>
<p>in the scientific literature,</p>
<p>relates to the same sorts of thought patterns</p>
<p>and somatic bodily responses,</p>
<p>heart rate, breathing, et cetera,</p>
<p>but without a clear and present danger</p>
<p>being in the environment or right there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way that we&rsquo;re going to talk about anxiety now</p>
<p>and anxiety is really what binds</p>
<p>the obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>such that someone will have an intrusive thought.</p>
<p>So for instance, someone will have the thought</p>
<p>that if they turn left on any street,</p>
<p>that something bad will happen.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s an obsession.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not all that uncommon.</p>
<p>Now, how bad and what the specificity</p>
<p>of that bad thing really is will vary.</p>
<p>Some people will think if I turn left,</p>
<p>something generally bad will happen.</p>
<p>It just makes me feel anxious,</p>
<p>so they always insist on going right.</p>
<p>Whereas other people will think if I turn left,</p>
<p>so-and-so will die or I will die</p>
<p>or something terrible will happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get a disease or someone else will get a disease</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll be cursing myself or somebody else</p>
<p>in some very specific way.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately quite common in people with OCD.</p>
<p>So they have this feeling</p>
<p>and the feeling can be generally or specifically related</p>
<p>to a particular outcome,</p>
<p>but beneath that is a feeling of anxiety,</p>
<p>a quickening of the heartbeat, a quickening of breathing,</p>
<p>a narrowing of one&rsquo;s visual focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this before on other podcasts,</p>
<p>the Master Stress and other podcasts,</p>
<p>but if you haven&rsquo;t heard those,</p>
<p>let me just briefly describe that when we are</p>
<p>in a state of increased so-called autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>alertness, stress, et cetera,</p>
<p>our visual field literally narrows.</p>
<p>The aperture of our visual field gets smaller,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because of the relationship</p>
<p>between the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and your visual system.</p>
<p>So you start seeing the world through sort of soda straw</p>
<p>view or through binocular like view,</p>
<p>as opposed to seeing the big picture.</p>
<p>Why is that important?</p>
<p>Well, it literally sharpens and narrows your focus</p>
<p>toward the very thing that the obsessions</p>
<p>and the compulsions are focused on.</p>
<p>So the person walking down the street who sees</p>
<p>the opportunity to go left or right</p>
<p>will only see the bad decision.</p>
<p>Their visual field narrows very tightly</p>
<p>along that possibility of taking a left turn.</p>
<p>And I know as I described, this seems totally irrational,</p>
<p>but I want to emphasize that the person with OCD</p>
<p>knows it&rsquo;s irrational.</p>
<p>They might feel crazy because they&rsquo;re having these thoughts,</p>
<p>but they know it makes no sense whatsoever</p>
<p>that left somehow would be different than right</p>
<p>in terms of outcomes in this particular case.</p>
<p>And yet it feels as if it would.</p>
<p>In fact, in some cases, it feels as if they went left,</p>
<p>they would have a full-blown panic attack.</p>
<p>So the idea here is that the obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>are bound by anxiety, but then by taking a right-hand turn,</p>
<p>again, in this one particular example,</p>
<p>by taking a right-hand turn, there&rsquo;s a very brief,</p>
<p>I should mention, very brief relief of that anxiety</p>
<p>at the time of the decision to go right, not left.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an additional drop in anxiety</p>
<p>while one takes the right-hand turn</p>
<p>as opposed to the left-hand turn.</p>
<p>And then as I alluded to before,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reinforcement of the compulsion.</p>
<p>In other words, by going right,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t create a situation in the brain</p>
<p>and psychology of the person that,</p>
<p>oh, you know what, I&rsquo;m not anxious anymore.</p>
<p>Left would have probably been okay.</p>
<p>It reinforces the idea that right made me feel better</p>
<p>or turning right made me feel better.</p>
<p>And going left would have been that much worse.</p>
<p>Again, it reinforces the obsession even further.</p>
<p>And again, we could swap out right turns and left turns</p>
<p>with something like hand-washing,</p>
<p>the feeling that something is contaminated</p>
<p>and the need to wash one&rsquo;s hands,</p>
<p>even though one already washed their hands</p>
<p>20, 30, 50 times prior.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re actually going to go back to that example</p>
<p>a little bit later when we talk about</p>
<p>one particular category of therapies</p>
<p>that are very effective in many people for OCD,</p>
<p>which are the cognitive behavioral and exposure therapies.</p>
<p>I think some of you have heard of cognitive behavioral</p>
<p>and exposure therapies,</p>
<p>but the way they are used to treat OCD</p>
<p>is very much different than the way they&rsquo;re used</p>
<p>to treat other sorts of anxiety disorders</p>
<p>and other sorts of disorders generally.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fair to say that up to 70% of people with OCD</p>
<p>have some sort of anxiety or elevated anxiety,</p>
<p>either directly related to the OCD</p>
<p>or indirectly related to the OCD.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really hard to tease those apart</p>
<p>because OCD can create its own anxiety.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, it can even increase</p>
<p>its own anxiety.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also an issue of depression.</p>
<p>Having OCD can be very depressing, right?</p>
<p>Especially if some of these OCD thoughts and behaviors</p>
<p>start to really impede people&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to function in life, at work, in school, in relationship,</p>
<p>they can start feeling less optimistic about life.</p>
<p>And in fact, some people can become suicidally depressed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how bad OCD can be for us.</p>
<p>So we have to be careful when saying that 70% of people</p>
<p>with OCD also have anxiety,</p>
<p>or X number of people with OCD are also depressed</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know whether or not the depression</p>
<p>led the OCD or the other way around,</p>
<p>or whether or not they&rsquo;re operating,</p>
<p>as we say in science, in parallel.</p>
<p>Some of the drug treatments for OCD and depression</p>
<p>and anxiety can tease some of that apart.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that what binds</p>
<p>the obsessions and compulsions is anxiety,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a feeling of it,</p>
<p>or I should say an urgent feeling of a need</p>
<p>to get rid of the obsession.</p>
<p>And the person feels as if the only way they can do that</p>
<p>is to engage in a particular compulsive behavior.</p>
<p>Some people are probably wondering</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a genetic component to OCD.</p>
<p>And indeed there is,</p>
<p>although the nature of it isn&rsquo;t exactly clear.</p>
<p>And oftentimes when people hear</p>
<p>that something has a genetic component,</p>
<p>they think it&rsquo;s always directly inherited from a parent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>There can be genes that surface in siblings</p>
<p>or genes that surface in children</p>
<p>that are not readily apparent</p>
<p>in terms of what we call a phenotype.</p>
<p>So you have a genotype, the gene,</p>
<p>and then you have a phenotype,</p>
<p>the way it shows up as a body form or like eye color,</p>
<p>or how it shows up in terms of a behavior</p>
<p>or behavioral pattern.</p>
<p>Based on twin studies,</p>
<p>where researchers have examined identical twins,</p>
<p>fraternal twins, even identical twins</p>
<p>that share the same sac in utero,</p>
<p>what we call monochorionics,</p>
<p>so sitting in the same little bag during pregnancy,</p>
<p>or in different little bags,</p>
<p>you can see different levels</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called genetic concordance.</p>
<p>But if we were to just sort of cut a broad swath</p>
<p>through all of the genetic data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fair to say that about 40 to 50%</p>
<p>of OCD cases have some genetic component,</p>
<p>some mutation or some inherited aspect that&rsquo;s genetic</p>
<p>and that one could point to if they got their genome mapped.</p>
<p>Now, while that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s terribly useful for most people.</p>
<p>First of all, you can&rsquo;t really control your genes,</p>
<p>at least at this point in history,</p>
<p>even though there are things like epigenetic control</p>
<p>and people are very excited about technologies</p>
<p>like CRISPR for modifying the genome.</p>
<p>In humans at some point,</p>
<p>most people can&rsquo;t control their genetics, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pick who your parents were, as they say.</p>
<p>So just know that there is a genetic component</p>
<p>in about half of people with OCD, but not always.</p>
<p>Now, as is typical for this podcast,</p>
<p>I want to focus on some of the neural mechanisms</p>
<p>and chemical systems in the brain and body</p>
<p>that generate obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>In fact, if you&rsquo;ve watched this podcast before,</p>
<p>listened to this podcast before,</p>
<p>this is always how I structure things.</p>
<p>First, we introduce a topic</p>
<p>and we explore that topic in detail</p>
<p>and really define what it is and what it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s very important that we focus on what is known</p>
<p>and what is not known about the biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that generate whatever that thing happens to be,</p>
<p>in this case, OCD</p>
<p>or an obsessive compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>Now, I want to emphasize that</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a background in biology,</p>
<p>I will make this information accessible to you.</p>
<p>And I also want to emphasize that for those of you</p>
<p>that are interested in treatments</p>
<p>and are anxiously awaiting the description of things</p>
<p>that can help with OCD,</p>
<p>I encourage you, if you will,</p>
<p>to please try and digest some of the material</p>
<p>about the underlying mechanisms,</p>
<p>because understanding even just a little bit</p>
<p>of those biological mechanisms</p>
<p>can really help shed light on why particular drug</p>
<p>and behavioral treatments</p>
<p>and other sorts of treatments work and don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>This is especially important in the case of OCD,</p>
<p>where it turns out that the order and type of treatment</p>
<p>can really vary according to individual.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something really special</p>
<p>and important about OCD that we really can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>for a number of the other sorts of disorders</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve described on previous podcasts.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a step back and look at the neural circuitry.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on in the brain and body of people with OCD?</p>
<p>Why the intrusive recurrent thoughts?</p>
<p>Why the compulsions?</p>
<p>Why is that whole system bound by anxiety?</p>
<p>And in some ways in thinking about that,</p>
<p>I want you to keep in mind</p>
<p>that the brain has two main functions.</p>
<p>The brain&rsquo;s main functions</p>
<p>are to take care of all the housekeeping stuff,</p>
<p>make sure digestion works, make sure the heart beats,</p>
<p>make sure you keep breathing no matter what,</p>
<p>make sure that you can see, you can hear,</p>
<p>you can smell, et cetera, the basic stuff.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s an enormous amount of brain real estate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s designed to allow you to predict</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen next,</p>
<p>either in the immediate future or in the long-term future.</p>
<p>And largely that&rsquo;s done based on your knowledge of the past.</p>
<p>So you also have memory systems.</p>
<p>And of course you have systems in the brain and body</p>
<p>that are designed to bind what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>at the housekeeping level, like your heart rate,</p>
<p>to your anticipation of what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re thinking about something very fearful,</p>
<p>your body will have one type of reaction.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about something</p>
<p>very pleasant and relaxing,</p>
<p>your body will have another type of reaction.</p>
<p>So whenever I hear about the brain-body distinction,</p>
<p>I have to just remind everybody</p>
<p>that there really is no distinction between brain and body</p>
<p>when you think about it through the nervous system.</p>
<p>The nervous system is the brain, the eyes, the spinal cord,</p>
<p>but of course all their connections</p>
<p>with all the organs of the body</p>
<p>and the connections of all the organs of the body</p>
<p>with the brain, the spinal cord, et cetera.</p>
<p>So as I describe these neural circuits,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to think of them</p>
<p>as just things happening in the head.</p>
<p>They are certainly happening in the head.</p>
<p>In fact, the circuits I&rsquo;ll describe most in detail</p>
<p>do exist within the confines of your cranial vault.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nerd speak for skull.</p>
<p>But those circuits are driving particular predictions</p>
<p>and therefore particular biases</p>
<p>towards particular actions in your body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re creating a state of readiness</p>
<p>or a state of desire to check or desire to count</p>
<p>or desire to avoid, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So what are these circuits?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s been a lot of wonderful research</p>
<p>exploring the neural circuits</p>
<p>underlying obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s mainly been accomplished</p>
<p>through a couple of methods.</p>
<p>Most of those methods when applied in humans</p>
<p>involve getting some look into which brain areas are active</p>
<p>when people are having obsessions</p>
<p>and when people are engaging in compulsions.</p>
<p>Now that might seem simple to do,</p>
<p>but of course your brain is housed inside the cranial vault.</p>
<p>And in order to look inside it,</p>
<p>you have to use things like magnetic resonance imaging,</p>
<p>which is just fancy technology for looking at blood flow,</p>
<p>which relates to activation of neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>or things like PET, P-E-T imaging,</p>
<p>which has nothing to do with the verb pet</p>
<p>and has nothing to do with your house pet,</p>
<p>has everything to do with positron emission tomography,</p>
<p>which is just another way of seeing</p>
<p>which brain areas are active.</p>
<p>And then you can also use PET to figure out</p>
<p>what sorts of neurochemicals are active,</p>
<p>like dopamine, et cetera.</p>
<p>Many studies, we can fairly say dozens,</p>
<p>if not hundreds of studies,</p>
<p>have now identified a particular circuit</p>
<p>or loop of brain areas that are interconnected</p>
<p>and very active in obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>That loop includes the cortex,</p>
<p>which is kind of the outer shell of the human brain,</p>
<p>the lumpy stuff, as it sometimes appears</p>
<p>if the skull is removed,</p>
<p>and it involves an area called the striatum,</p>
<p>which is involved in action selection</p>
<p>and holding back action.</p>
<p>The striatum is involved in what&rsquo;s commonly called</p>
<p>go and no-go types of behaviors.</p>
<p>So every type of behavior,</p>
<p>like picking up a pen or a mug of coffee,</p>
<p>involves a go-type function.</p>
<p>It involves generating an action.</p>
<p>But every time I resist an action,</p>
<p>my nervous system is also doing that</p>
<p>using this brain structure, the striatum,</p>
<p>among other things, the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>Talked about that before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to overload you with terminology here,</p>
<p>but I know some people are interested in terminology.</p>
<p>So you have go behaviors and you have no-go,</p>
<p>resisting of behaviors, not going toward behavior.</p>
<p>The cortex and the striatum</p>
<p>are in this intricate back-and-forth talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really loops of connections.</p>
<p>The cortex doesn&rsquo;t tell the striatum what to do.</p>
<p>The striatum doesn&rsquo;t tell the cortex what to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in a crosstalk.</p>
<p>Like any good relationship,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of back-and-forth communication.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a third element in this corticostriatal loop,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called, and that&rsquo;s the thalamus.</p>
<p>Now, the thalamus is not a structure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about before on this podcast,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of my favorite structures to think about</p>
<p>and teach about in neuroanatomy,</p>
<p>which I teach back at Stanford</p>
<p>and have taught for many years elsewhere.</p>
<p>Because the thalamus is this incredible egg-like structure</p>
<p>in the center of your brain</p>
<p>that has different channels through it,</p>
<p>channels for relaying visual information</p>
<p>or auditory information or touch information</p>
<p>from your environment up into your cortex,</p>
<p>and as a consequence,</p>
<p>making certain things that are happening to you</p>
<p>and around you apparent to you,</p>
<p>making you aware of them, making you perceive them,</p>
<p>and suppressing others.</p>
<p>So for instance, right now, if you&rsquo;re hearing me say this,</p>
<p>your thalamus has what are called auditory nuclei.</p>
<p>These are just collections of neurons</p>
<p>that respond to sound waves</p>
<p>that are, of course, coming in through your ears.</p>
<p>And your thalamus is active in a way</p>
<p>that those particular regions of your thalamus</p>
<p>are allowed, literally permitted,</p>
<p>to pass the information coming from your ears</p>
<p>through some other steps,</p>
<p>but then to your thalamus, your auditory thalamus,</p>
<p>then up to your cortex,</p>
<p>and you can hear what I&rsquo;m saying right now.</p>
<p>At the same time, your thalamus is surrounded</p>
<p>by a kind of a shell,</p>
<p>something called the thalamic reticular nucleus.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t have to remember the names,</p>
<p>but this thalamic reticular nucleus,</p>
<p>also sometimes called the reticular thalamic nucleus,</p>
<p>this is, believe it or not, a subject of debate in science.</p>
<p>There are people that literally hated each other,</p>
<p>probably still hate each other,</p>
<p>even though one of them&rsquo;s dead,</p>
<p>for decades because they would argue</p>
<p>it was thalamic reticular nucleus,</p>
<p>the other was reticular thalamic nucleus.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are scientists, they&rsquo;re people,</p>
<p>they tend to debate.</p>
<p>But the thalamic reticular nucleus, as I&rsquo;m going to call it,</p>
<p>serves as a sort of gate</p>
<p>as to which information is allowed to pass through</p>
<p>up to your conscious experience and which is not.</p>
<p>And that gating mechanism is strongly regulated</p>
<p>by the chemical GABA.</p>
<p>GABA is a neurotransmitter that is inhibitory, as we say.</p>
<p>It serves to shut down</p>
<p>or suppress the activity of other neurons.</p>
<p>So the thalamic reticular nucleus is really saying,</p>
<p>no, touch information cannot come in right now.</p>
<p>You should not be thinking about the contact</p>
<p>of the back of your legs</p>
<p>with the chair that you&rsquo;re sitting on, Andrew.</p>
<p>You should be thinking about what you&rsquo;re trying to say</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re hearing and how your voice sounds</p>
<p>and what you see in front of you, et cetera.</p>
<p>Whereas if I&rsquo;m about to get an injection from a doctor</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m in pain or I&rsquo;m in pleasure,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to think about my somatic sensation</p>
<p>at the level of touch.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m probably going to think less about</p>
<p>smells in the room,</p>
<p>although I might also think about smells in the room</p>
<p>or what I&rsquo;m seeing and what I&rsquo;m hearing.</p>
<p>We can combine all these different sensory modalities,</p>
<p>but the thalamic reticular nucleus really allows us</p>
<p>to funnel, to direct particular categories</p>
<p>of sensory experience into our conscious awareness</p>
<p>and suppress other categories of sensory experience.</p>
<p>In addition, the thalamic reticular nucleus</p>
<p>plays a critical role in which thoughts</p>
<p>are allowed to pass up to our conscious perception</p>
<p>and which ones are not.</p>
<p>So much so that some neuroscientists</p>
<p>and indeed some neurophilosophers,</p>
<p>if you want to call them that,</p>
<p>have theorized or philosophized</p>
<p>that the thalamic reticular nucleus</p>
<p>is actually involved in our consciousness.</p>
<p>Now, consciousness isn&rsquo;t a topic</p>
<p>that I really want to talk about this episode.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very kind of mushy, murky,</p>
<p>as we say in science, it&rsquo;s a shmooey term</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t really have clear definition.</p>
<p>So arguments about it often get lost in the fact</p>
<p>that people are arguing about different things.</p>
<p>But when I say consciousness,</p>
<p>what I mean is conscious awareness.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s zoom out and take a look at the circuit</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve got and that we now know</p>
<p>based on neuroimaging studies is intimately involved</p>
<p>in generating obsessions and compulsions in OCD.</p>
<p>We have a cortex or neocortex,</p>
<p>which is involved in perception</p>
<p>and understanding of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>We have the striatum and basal ganglia,</p>
<p>which are involved in generating behaviors, go,</p>
<p>and suppressing behaviors, no go.</p>
<p>And we have the thalamus,</p>
<p>which collects all of our sensory experience in parallel,</p>
<p>hearing, touch, smell, et cetera.</p>
<p>Not so much smell through the thalamus I should mention,</p>
<p>but the other senses that is.</p>
<p>And then that thalamus is encased</p>
<p>by the thalamic reticular nucleus,</p>
<p>which serves as a kind of a guard saying,</p>
<p>you can pass through and you can pass through,</p>
<p>but you, you, you can&rsquo;t pass through</p>
<p>up to conscious understanding and perception.</p>
<p>So that loop, this corticostriatothalamic loop,</p>
<p>corticostriatothalamic loop,</p>
<p>is the circuit thought to underlie OCD.</p>
<p>And dysfunction in that circuit</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s thought to underlie OCD.</p>
<p>Now, again, this circuit exists in all of us</p>
<p>and it can operate in healthy ways</p>
<p>or it can operate in ways that make us feel unhealthy</p>
<p>or even suffer from full-blown OCD.</p>
<p>How do we know that this circuit is involved in OCD?</p>
<p>Well, there we can look to some really interesting studies</p>
<p>that involve bringing human subjects into the laboratory</p>
<p>and generating their obsessions and compulsions,</p>
<p>and then imaging their brain using any variety of techniques</p>
<p>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>What would such an experiment look like?</p>
<p>Well, in order to do that sort of experiment,</p>
<p>first of all, you need people who have OCD.</p>
<p>And of course you need control subjects that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And you need to be able to reliably evoke the obsessions</p>
<p>and the compulsions.</p>
<p>Now, it turns out this is most easily,</p>
<p>or I should say most simply done,</p>
<p>because it can&rsquo;t be easy for the people with OCD,</p>
<p>but this is most straightforward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the word I was looking for.</p>
<p>Most straightforward when looking at the category</p>
<p>of obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>that relate to order and cleanliness.</p>
<p>So what they do typically is bring subjects</p>
<p>into the laboratory who have a obsession</p>
<p>about germs and contamination and a compulsion to hand wash.</p>
<p>And they give these people, believe it or not,</p>
<p>a sweaty towel that contains the sweat and the odor</p>
<p>and the liquid basically from somebody else&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;ll sometimes have someone</p>
<p>wipe their own sweat off the back of their neck</p>
<p>and put it on the towel,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll put it in front of the person,</p>
<p>which as you can imagine for someone with OCD</p>
<p>is incredibly anxiety provoking</p>
<p>and almost always evokes these obsessions</p>
<p>about, oh, this is really, this is really bad.</p>
<p>I need to clean, I need to clean, I need to clean.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re doing all this</p>
<p>while someone is in a brain scanner</p>
<p>or while they&rsquo;re being imaged</p>
<p>for positron emission tomography.</p>
<p>And then they can also look at the patterns of activation</p>
<p>in the brain while the person is doing hand washing.</p>
<p>Although sometimes the apparati</p>
<p>associated with these imaging studies</p>
<p>make it hard to do a lot of movement,</p>
<p>they can do these sorts of studies.</p>
<p>They have done these sorts of studies in many subjects</p>
<p>using different variations of what I just described.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, what lights up,</p>
<p>when I say lights up,</p>
<p>what sorts of brain regions are more metabolically active,</p>
<p>more blood flow, more neural activity?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s this particular corticostriatal thalamic loop.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>some of the drug treatments that are effective in some,</p>
<p>and I want to emphasize some individuals</p>
<p>at suppressing obsessions and or compulsions,</p>
<p>such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</p>
<p>or SSRIs, which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a little bit.</p>
<p>When people take those drugs,</p>
<p>they see not just a suppression</p>
<p>of the obsession and compulsion,</p>
<p>but also a suppression of these particular neural circuits.</p>
<p>They become less active.</p>
<p>Now I want to emphasize and telegraph</p>
<p>a little bit of what&rsquo;s coming later.</p>
<p>These drugs like SSRIs do not work for everybody with OCD.</p>
<p>And as many of you know,</p>
<p>they carry other certain problems and side effects</p>
<p>for many, but not all individuals.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, what we have now is an observation</p>
<p>that this circuit, the corticostriatal thalamic loop,</p>
<p>is active in OCD.</p>
<p>We have a manipulation that when people take a drug</p>
<p>that at least in those individuals is effective</p>
<p>in suppressing or eliminating the obsessions</p>
<p>and compulsions, there&rsquo;s less activity in this loop.</p>
<p>And thanks to some very good animal model studies</p>
<p>that at least at this point in time,</p>
<p>you really couldn&rsquo;t do in humans,</p>
<p>although soon that may change,</p>
<p>we now know in a causal way that the equivalent circuitry,</p>
<p>A, exists in other animals, such as mice, such as cats,</p>
<p>such as monkeys, and that activation</p>
<p>of those particular corticostriatal thalamic circuits</p>
<p>in animal models can indeed evoke OCD in an individual</p>
<p>that prior to that did not have OCD.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to briefly describe one such study.</p>
<p>This is a now classic study published</p>
<p>in the Journal of Science,</p>
<p>one of the three apex journals in 2013.</p>
<p>The first author on this paper is Suzanne Amari, A-H-M-A-R-I.</p>
<p>I will provide a link to this in the show notes</p>
<p>as a truly landmark paper done in Renee Henn&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at Columbia University.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper is</p>
<p>Repeated Corticostriatal Stimulation Generates,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the key word here,</p>
<p>Generates Persistent OCD-Like Behavior.</p>
<p>What they did is they took mice, mice do mouse things.</p>
<p>They move around, they play with toys, they eat, they pee,</p>
<p>they mate, they do various things in their cage,</p>
<p>but they also groom, humans groom, animals with fur groom.</p>
<p>Well, you hope most people groom, some people over groom,</p>
<p>some people under groom, but most people groom.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll comb their hair, they&rsquo;ll clean, et cetera.</p>
<p>Those are normal behaviors that humans engage in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware that mice comb their hair,</p>
<p>but mice adjust their hair.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll kind of pet their hair and they&rsquo;ll do this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll sometimes even do it to each other.</p>
<p>We used to have mice in the lab.</p>
<p>Now we only do human studies,</p>
<p>but the mice will groom themselves</p>
<p>and typical what we call wild type mice,</p>
<p>not because they&rsquo;re wild, but because they&rsquo;re typical,</p>
<p>will groom themselves at a particular frequency,</p>
<p>but not to the point where their hair is falling out,</p>
<p>not constantly.</p>
<p>They are grooming some of the time</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing other mouse things, other mouse times.</p>
<p>So in this particular study,</p>
<p>what they did is they used some technology,</p>
<p>which actually was discussed on a previous episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>This is technology that was developed by a psychiatrist</p>
<p>and bioengineer by the name of Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>one of my colleagues at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This is technology that allows researchers</p>
<p>to use the presentation of light</p>
<p>to control neural activity in particular brain areas</p>
<p>in a very high fidelity way.</p>
<p>You control the activity in the cortex or the striatum</p>
<p>or the thalamus when you want and how you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a beautiful technology.</p>
<p>In any event, what they did in this study is,</p>
<p>or I should say what Susan Amari</p>
<p>and colleagues did in this study</p>
<p>was to stimulate the corticostriatal circuitry</p>
<p>in animals that did not have any OCD-like behavior.</p>
<p>And when they did that,</p>
<p>those animals started grooming incessantly</p>
<p>to the point where their hair was falling out</p>
<p>or they even, you know,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t take the experiments this far, fortunately,</p>
<p>but the animals would have a tendency</p>
<p>to almost rub themselves raw.</p>
<p>In the same way that somebody who has a compulsion</p>
<p>to hand wash would, sadly, people will hand wash</p>
<p>to the point where their hands are actually bleeding</p>
<p>and raw, it&rsquo;s really that bad.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s tough imagery to imagine</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t even imagine why someone would self-harm</p>
<p>in that way, but again, that&rsquo;s that incredible anxiety</p>
<p>relationship between the compulsion, excuse me,</p>
<p>the obsession and the compulsion</p>
<p>and the fact that engaging in the compulsion</p>
<p>simply strengthens the obsession and therefore the anxiety.</p>
<p>So that collection of studies of data,</p>
<p>fMRI, PET scanning in humans, the treatment with SSRIs</p>
<p>and these experiments where researchers</p>
<p>have actively triggered these particular circuits</p>
<p>in animal models that previously did not have</p>
<p>too much activity in these circuits</p>
<p>and then they observe OCD emerging</p>
<p>really points squarely to the fact</p>
<p>that the corticosteroidal thalamic loop</p>
<p>is likely to be the basis of OCD.</p>
<p>Now, of course, other circuits could also be involved,</p>
<p>but the corticosteroidal thalamic circuit</p>
<p>seems to be the main circuit generating OCD-like behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of mechanism.</p>
<p>Hopefully it was described in a way</p>
<p>that you can digest and understand.</p>
<p>And some of you might be thinking, well, so what?</p>
<p>Why does that help me?</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t reach into my brain and turn off my cortex.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t reach into my brain and turn off my thalamus.</p>
<p>And indeed, on the one hand, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But as you&rsquo;ll next learn,</p>
<p>when thinking about the various behavioral treatments</p>
<p>and drug treatments and holistic treatments for OCD,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll notice is that each one taps</p>
<p>into a different component</p>
<p>of this corticosteroidal thalamic loop.</p>
<p>And by understanding that,</p>
<p>you can start to see why certain treatments might work</p>
<p>at one stage of the illness versus others.</p>
<p>You will also start to understand</p>
<p>why obsessive compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>does not have the same sorts of engagements</p>
<p>of these neural loops,</p>
<p>and yet relies on other aspects of brain and body,</p>
<p>and therefore responds best to other sorts of treatments.</p>
<p>Or in some cases,</p>
<p>people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>are not even seeking treatment, as I alluded to before.</p>
<p>The point here is that by understanding</p>
<p>the underlying mechanism,</p>
<p>why certain drugs and behavioral treatments work</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t work will become immediately apparent.</p>
<p>And in thinking about that, in knowing that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to make excellent choices, I believe,</p>
<p>in terms of what sorts of treatments you pursue,</p>
<p>what sorts of treatments you abandon,</p>
<p>and most importantly, the order,</p>
<p>the sequence that you pursue and apply those treatments.</p>
<p>Before we go any further,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to give people a little bit of a window</p>
<p>into what a diagnosis for OCD would look like.</p>
<p>Give you a sense of the sorts of questions</p>
<p>that a clinician would ask</p>
<p>to determine whether or not somebody has OCD or not.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be clear,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do this in an exhaustive way.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone to self-diagnose,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m hoping that by sharing some of this,</p>
<p>that some of you might get insight</p>
<p>into whether or not you do have obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>that might qualify for OCD,</p>
<p>and perhaps even to seek out help.</p>
<p>The most commonly used test of OCD,</p>
<p>or for OCD, I should say,</p>
<p>is called the Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale.</p>
<p>And this is, you know, scientists love acronyms</p>
<p>as do the military, and it&rsquo;s the YBOCS,</p>
<p>the Y-B-O-C-S, the YBOCS.</p>
<p>So typically, someone will go into the clinic</p>
<p>either because a family member encouraged them to,</p>
<p>or because they feel that they&rsquo;re suffering</p>
<p>from obsessions and compulsions.</p>
<p>And before the clinician would proceed</p>
<p>with any kind of direct questions,</p>
<p>they would very clearly define</p>
<p>what obsessions and compulsions are.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m actually reading from the YBOCS.</p>
<p>So, quote,</p>
<p>obsessions are unwelcome and distressing ideas,</p>
<p>thoughts, images, or impulses</p>
<p>that repeatedly enter your mind.</p>
<p>They may seem to occur against your will.</p>
<p>They may be repugnant to you.</p>
<p>You may recognize them as senseless,</p>
<p>and they may not fit your personality.</p>
<p>Then there are compulsions.</p>
<p>Quote, compulsions, on the other hand,</p>
<p>are behaviors or acts that you feel driven to perform,</p>
<p>although you may recognize them as senseless or excessive.</p>
<p>At times, you may try to resist doing them,</p>
<p>but this may prove difficult.</p>
<p>You may experience anxiety that does not diminish</p>
<p>until the behavior is completed.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before, in many cases,</p>
<p>immediately after the behavior is completed,</p>
<p>the anxiety doesn&rsquo;t just return, it indeed can strengthen.</p>
<p>Now, there are a tremendous number of questions</p>
<p>on the YBOCS.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m just going to highlight</p>
<p>a few of the general categories.</p>
<p>Typically, the person will fill out a checklist.</p>
<p>So, they will designate whether or not currently</p>
<p>or in the past they have, for instance,</p>
<p>aggressive obsessions,</p>
<p>fear that one might harm themselves,</p>
<p>fear that one might harm others,</p>
<p>fear that they&rsquo;ll steal things,</p>
<p>fear that they will act on unwanted impulses,</p>
<p>currently or in the past or both.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one category.</p>
<p>The other one are contamination obsessions.</p>
<p>So, concern with dirt or germs,</p>
<p>bothered by sticky substances or residues,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, there are a bunch of different categories</p>
<p>that include, for instance, sexual obsessions,</p>
<p>what are called saving obsessions,</p>
<p>even moral obsessions, right?</p>
<p>Excess concern with right or wrong or morality,</p>
<p>concerned with sacrilege and blasphemy,</p>
<p>obsession with need for symmetry and exactness.</p>
<p>Again, all of these questions being answered</p>
<p>as either present in the past or not present in the past,</p>
<p>present currently or not present currently.</p>
<p>And then the test generally transitions over</p>
<p>to questions about target symptoms.</p>
<p>They really try and get people to identify</p>
<p>if they have obsessions, what are their exact obsessions?</p>
<p>Now, this turns out to be really important</p>
<p>because as we talk about some of the therapies</p>
<p>that really work,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give away a little bit of why they work best</p>
<p>in certain cases and why they don&rsquo;t work as well</p>
<p>in other cases.</p>
<p>It turns out that it becomes very important</p>
<p>for the clinician and the patient</p>
<p>to not just identify the obsessions</p>
<p>and the compulsions generally</p>
<p>in a kind of a generic or top contour way,</p>
<p>but to really encourage or even force the patient</p>
<p>to define very precisely</p>
<p>what the biggest, most catastrophic fear is,</p>
<p>what the obsession really relates to.</p>
<p>That turns out to be very important</p>
<p>in disrupting this corticostriatophilamic loop</p>
<p>and getting relief from symptoms one way or the other.</p>
<p>So the Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale, this Y-box,</p>
<p>again, is very extensive.</p>
<p>It goes on for dozens of pages actually,</p>
<p>and has all these different categories,</p>
<p>not so much designed to just pinpoint</p>
<p>what people obsess about or what they feel compelled to do,</p>
<p>but to also try and identify</p>
<p>what is the fear that&rsquo;s driving all this, right?</p>
<p>In the way that we&rsquo;ve set this up thus far,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>as kind of existing in a vacuum.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re obsessed about germs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re compelled to wash your hands,</p>
<p>obsessed about germs, compelled to wash your hands,</p>
<p>or obsessed about symmetry,</p>
<p>compelled to put right angles on everything,</p>
<p>or obsessed about counting and therefore counting, et cetera.</p>
<p>But beneath that is a cognitive component</p>
<p>that is not at all apparent</p>
<p>from someone describing their obsession</p>
<p>and from someone describing or displaying their compulsion.</p>
<p>The deeper layer to all that is what is the fear exactly</p>
<p>if one were to not perform the compulsion?</p>
<p>Meaning what is the fear that&rsquo;s driving the obsession?</p>
<p>So that brings us to a very powerful category of treatments</p>
<p>that I should say does not work in everybody with OCD,</p>
<p>but works in many people with OCD,</p>
<p>and really speaks to the underlying neural circuitry</p>
<p>that generates OCD and how to interrupt it.</p>
<p>And that is the treatment of cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>and in particular exposure-based</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>and exposure therapy now,</p>
<p>but right at the outset,</p>
<p>I want to distinguish the kinds</p>
<p>of cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapies</p>
<p>that are done for obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>the sorts of cognitive behavioral therapies</p>
<p>that are done for other types</p>
<p>of mental challenges and disorders.</p>
<p>Because cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD</p>
<p>really has everything to do</p>
<p>with identifying the utmost fear.</p>
<p>In some sense, we can think of fears</p>
<p>as kind of along a hierarchy, right?</p>
<p>In the example earlier of somebody being afraid</p>
<p>to turn left and therefore feeling compelled to turn right,</p>
<p>you would want to take that person</p>
<p>and really understand what do they fear most</p>
<p>about turning left?</p>
<p>Now, they might not be aware of it.</p>
<p>They might not be conscious to what that really is.</p>
<p>But if you were to probe them in a clinical setting,</p>
<p>you would eventually get to an answer.</p>
<p>That answer could be at first, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>just, it&rsquo;s just bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It makes no sense, but it&rsquo;s just bad.</p>
<p>I do not want to go left.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>But if you were to push that person a little bit</p>
<p>in a respectful and kind and caring way</p>
<p>aimed at their treatment,</p>
<p>if you were to push them and say,</p>
<p>well, what do you mean by bad?</p>
<p>If you turn left, do you think the world would end?</p>
<p>They might say, no, the world&rsquo;s not going to end,</p>
<p>but someone is going to die suddenly.</p>
<p>I know that sounds crazy,</p>
<p>but somebody is going to die suddenly.</p>
<p>It almost, this almost sounds like superstition.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about superstitions later,</p>
<p>but indeed it is somewhat superstitious.</p>
<p>So for instance, you would say, who&rsquo;s going to die?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d say, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d say, no, really, who&rsquo;s going to die?</p>
<p>If you think about this, are you going to die?</p>
<p>Is so-and-so going to die?</p>
<p>And very often, very often,</p>
<p>what you find is that people will start to reveal</p>
<p>the underlying obsession at a level of detail</p>
<p>that both to the clinician and to them</p>
<p>can be somewhat astonishing,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;ve been living with that detail</p>
<p>in their mind for a very long time.</p>
<p>Now, how could somebody start to reveal detail</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s existed in their mind</p>
<p>for a very long time, but not known about it, right?</p>
<p>Not been aware of it.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might think,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s repressed or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not at all what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>If you think about the architecture of OCD,</p>
<p>typically people will have an obsession</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll engage in the compulsion</p>
<p>as quickly as they can to relieve that obsession.</p>
<p>So in many ways, the disease itself prevents people</p>
<p>from ever getting to the bottom of that trough,</p>
<p>ever getting to the point where they really clearly</p>
<p>articulate to themselves exactly what it is that they fear.</p>
<p>But it becomes so essential to articulate exactly</p>
<p>what it is that they fear</p>
<p>for a somewhat counterintuitive reason.</p>
<p>You might think, oh, the moment they realize</p>
<p>exactly what they fear, everything lifts.</p>
<p>The circuit turns off and they just feel better</p>
<p>because they realized it.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>but it turns out it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>What the clinician is actually trying to do</p>
<p>is get people to feel more anxiety, not less.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re trying to get them to do is to short circuit,</p>
<p>no pun intended, to intervene in their own neural circuit,</p>
<p>I should say, with that relief of anxiety, however brief,</p>
<p>brought on by engaging in the compulsion</p>
<p>related to the obsession.</p>
<p>So whereas typically someone would feel the obsession with,</p>
<p>oh, I don&rsquo;t want to turn left</p>
<p>because something bad&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s going to die, and then they turn right.</p>
<p>They never get the option or the opportunity</p>
<p>to really explore what would happen were they to turn left</p>
<p>or to not be able to turn right.</p>
<p>By forcing them down the path of inquiry</p>
<p>that leads them to the place where they very clearly</p>
<p>identify the fear, the anxiety, it raises the anxiety</p>
<p>in them, and that&rsquo;s actually what the clinician is after.</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy</p>
<p>in the context of OCD most often involves trying</p>
<p>to get people to tolerate, not relieve their anxiety.</p>
<p>This is extremely important,</p>
<p>and I realize there&rsquo;s variation to this</p>
<p>depending on the style of cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>the style of exposure therapy, but almost across the board,</p>
<p>the goal, again, is to get people to feel the anxiety</p>
<p>that normally they are able to at least partially relieve,</p>
<p>however briefly, by engaging in the compulsion.</p>
<p>So if we think back to that circuit</p>
<p>of corticostriatal thalamic, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>Where is CBT intervening?</p>
<p>What part of the circuit is getting interrupted?</p>
<p>Well, as you recall, the cortex is involved</p>
<p>in conscious perception, the thalamus</p>
<p>and that thalamic reticular nucleus are involved</p>
<p>in the passage of certain types of experience</p>
<p>up to our conscious perception, not others,</p>
<p>and the striatum is involved</p>
<p>in this go, no-go type behavior.</p>
<p>When OCD is really expressing itself in its fullness,</p>
<p>people feel an anxiety around a particular thought,</p>
<p>and they either have a go, for instance, wash hands,</p>
<p>or a no-go, do not turn left type reaction.</p>
<p>By having people progressively in a kind of hierarchical way</p>
<p>reveal their precise source of anxiety,</p>
<p>their utmost fear in this context,</p>
<p>what happens is they feel enormous amounts</p>
<p>of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>Now, in the context of anxiety treatment</p>
<p>or other types of treatments,</p>
<p>the goal would be to teach people to dampen,</p>
<p>to lessen their anxiety through breathing techniques</p>
<p>or through visualization techniques or through self-talk</p>
<p>or through social support,</p>
<p>any of the number of things that are well-known</p>
<p>to help people self-regulate their own anxiety.</p>
<p>Here, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re trying to get the patient to do</p>
<p>is to really feel the anxiety at its maximum,</p>
<p>but then do the exact opposite</p>
<p>of whatever the normal compulsion is.</p>
<p>So if normally the compulsion is to wash one&rsquo;s hands,</p>
<p>then the idea is to suppress hand-washing</p>
<p>while being in the experience of the utmost anxiety.</p>
<p>Or in the case of not turning left,</p>
<p>the person is expected to,</p>
<p>or would hopefully be able to actually turn left.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine,</p>
<p>that would evoke tremendous anxiety</p>
<p>and yet to tolerate that anxiety.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be very clear,</p>
<p>this is not the sort of thing you want to do on your own.</p>
<p>This is not the sort of thing you want to do for a friend.</p>
<p>This is done by trained, licensed psychologists</p>
<p>and psychiatrists.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it really points to the fact</p>
<p>that as a anxiety-related disorder,</p>
<p>OCD is distinct from other types of anxiety</p>
<p>and anxiety-related disorders,</p>
<p>things like PTSD and panic disorder, et cetera,</p>
<p>because the goal, again,</p>
<p>is to bring the person right up close</p>
<p>to the thing that they fear the most,</p>
<p>and then to interrupt the circuit.</p>
<p>And now you should be able to know, just intuitively,</p>
<p>because you understand the mechanisms,</p>
<p>that the circuit you&rsquo;re trying to disrupt</p>
<p>is the pattern of information flow</p>
<p>from the thinking part of the brain,</p>
<p>the perception part of the brain, which is the cortex,</p>
<p>to the striatum, right?</p>
<p>The striatum has these neurons which are active</p>
<p>that essentially are,</p>
<p>I know it sounds a little bit like</p>
<p>a discussion about free will,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re trying to get the person</p>
<p>to generate a certain behavior</p>
<p>or suppress a certain behavior.</p>
<p>And as anxiety ramps up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of a hydraulic pressure to do that very thing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve done for so long</p>
<p>and they suffer from so much.</p>
<p>We talked about hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>in the context of aggression, in the aggression episode.</p>
<p>This is very similar, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of a&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, when I say hydraulic pressure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not actual hydraulic pressure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the confluence of a lot of different systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neurochemical, as we&rsquo;ll soon learn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hormonal, it&rsquo;s electrical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of different things operating in parallel.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t point to one chemical or transmitter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening is the person is feeling compelled</p>
<p>to act, act, act to relieve the anxiety,</p>
<p>and through a progressive type of exposure, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t throw people in the deep end</p>
<p>in this kind of therapy right off the bat.</p>
<p>You gradually ratchet them toward</p>
<p>or move them toward the discussion</p>
<p>of exactly what they fear the most,</p>
<p>and then eventually move them toward</p>
<p>the interruption of the compulsion</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re feeling this extremely elevated anxiety.</p>
<p>Of course, within the context</p>
<p>of a supportive clinical setting.</p>
<p>But in doing that, what you are teaching people</p>
<p>is that the anxiety can exist without the need</p>
<p>to engage in the compulsion.</p>
<p>Now, some of this might sound to people like,</p>
<p>oh, this is a lot of the kind of fancy</p>
<p>psychological neuroscience speak</p>
<p>around something that&rsquo;s kind of intuitive.</p>
<p>But I think for most people, this is not intuitive.</p>
<p>And for people with OCD,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no really other way to put it,</p>
<p>the impulse, the compulsion to avoid anxiety</p>
<p>is such a powerful driving force</p>
<p>that it should now make sense to you</p>
<p>as to why being able to tolerate anxiety</p>
<p>and really sit with it and do the exact opposite</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re normally compelled to do</p>
<p>is going to be the path to treatment.</p>
<p>And indeed, CBT has been shown to be enormously effective,</p>
<p>again, for a large number of people with OCD,</p>
<p>but not all of them.</p>
<p>And oftentimes it requires that it also be used</p>
<p>in concert with certain drug treatments,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re going to talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about some of the really unique features</p>
<p>of cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy</p>
<p>in the context of OCD that you often don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>in the use of CBT, that is cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>for other types of psychiatric challenges and disorders.</p>
<p>The first element is one of staircasing.</p>
<p>And I already mentioned this before,</p>
<p>but this gradual and progressive increase</p>
<p>in the anxiety that you&rsquo;re trying to evoke from the patient,</p>
<p>from the person suffering from OCD.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s done in the context of the office or the laboratory,</p>
<p>again, by a trained and licensed clinician.</p>
<p>But then the person leaves, right?</p>
<p>They leave the office, they leave the laboratory.</p>
<p>And a very vital component of CBT and exposure therapy</p>
<p>for people with OCD is that they have</p>
<p>and perform what&rsquo;s called homework.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally what they call.</p>
<p>This might be seen in other sorts of treatments,</p>
<p>but for OCD, homework is extremely important</p>
<p>because within the context of a laboratory experiment</p>
<p>or the clinic, patients often feel so much support</p>
<p>that they can tolerate those heightened levels of anxiety</p>
<p>and interrupt their compulsions.</p>
<p>Whereas when they get home,</p>
<p>oftentimes the familiarity of the environment</p>
<p>brings them to a place where all of a sudden</p>
<p>those obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>start interacting the same way</p>
<p>and they have a very hard time suppressing the behaviors.</p>
<p>Why would that be?</p>
<p>Well, in neuroscience, we have a phrase,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called condition-place preference</p>
<p>and condition-place avoidance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other phrases too,</p>
<p>but basically it all has to do with a simple thing,</p>
<p>which is when you feel something repeatedly</p>
<p>in a given environment,</p>
<p>sometimes even once within a given environment,</p>
<p>you tend to feel that same thing again</p>
<p>when you return to that or similar environments.</p>
<p>Okay, so condition-place blank or condition-place that</p>
<p>is simply fancy nerd speak for the fact that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a place and something good happens,</p>
<p>you tend to feel good if you return to that place</p>
<p>or a place like it.</p>
<p>Or if something bad happens in a given place,</p>
<p>you tend to feel bad when you return to that place</p>
<p>or a place like it.</p>
<p>I think the most salient example that leaps to mind</p>
<p>is in unfortunately the category of bad,</p>
<p>but I had some friends years ago visit San Francisco.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a ongoing,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s been happening forever,</p>
<p>but this is really in the last decade of daytime break-ins</p>
<p>and nighttime break-ins into cars</p>
<p>to steal anything from computers</p>
<p>to what seems to be like a box of tissues.</p>
<p>And there are numerous reasons for this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the topic of today&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>but I will use this as an opportunity to say,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re visiting anywhere in the Bay Area,</p>
<p>do not leave anything in your car</p>
<p>because the window will get broken into</p>
<p>sometimes in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Some good friends of mine were visiting the Bay Area</p>
<p>and I texted them and said,</p>
<p>hey, by the way, when you&rsquo;re headed to dinner, guys,</p>
<p>make sure you bring in all your luggage and computers,</p>
<p>however inconvenient that might be.</p>
<p>They wrote back, too late, everything got stolen.</p>
<p>So it was some years ago now,</p>
<p>I think five, six years ago, this happened.</p>
<p>Sadly, everything got stolen.</p>
<p>Most of it could be replaced,</p>
<p>but some of it was very sentimental to them.</p>
<p>Every time we talk,</p>
<p>every time we consider having a meeting</p>
<p>in a particular city, this comes up as,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be there,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that city anymore, et cetera.</p>
<p>And of course, San Francisco</p>
<p>has some wonderful redeeming features,</p>
<p>but it only takes one bad incident in one location</p>
<p>to kind of color the whole picture dark, so to speak.</p>
<p>The brain works that way.</p>
<p>The brain generalizes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very specific organ.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s a prediction machine</p>
<p>in addition to other things.</p>
<p>So in the case of CBT therapy,</p>
<p>the reason there&rsquo;s homework is that when people go home,</p>
<p>oftentimes that&rsquo;s when they relapse,</p>
<p>if you want to call it that,</p>
<p>back into their obsessions and compulsions.</p>
<p>And that location, that conditioned place</p>
<p>is where it becomes most important</p>
<p>to challenge the anxiety and to deal with the anxiety,</p>
<p>to not try and suppress the anxiety</p>
<p>through compulsions or other means.</p>
<p>And when I say other means,</p>
<p>I want to highlight something</p>
<p>will come up again a little bit later in the podcast</p>
<p>that substance abuse is very common in people with OCD</p>
<p>because of the anxiety component</p>
<p>and also because of people&rsquo;s feelings</p>
<p>that they just can&rsquo;t escape from the thoughts</p>
<p>or behavioral patterns that are so characteristic of OCD.</p>
<p>So alcohol abuse or cannabis abuse</p>
<p>or other forms of narcotics abuse are very common in OCD.</p>
<p>Later, we&rsquo;ll talk about whether or not cannabis</p>
<p>can or cannot help with OCD,</p>
<p>but needless to say,</p>
<p>suppressing anxiety is exactly the wrong direction</p>
<p>that one should take</p>
<p>if the goal is to ultimately relieve or eliminate the OCD.</p>
<p>So we now have two characteristics of CBT exposure therapy</p>
<p>that are extremely important for OCD</p>
<p>and somewhat unique to the treatment of OCD.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the staircasing up towards the really bad fear,</p>
<p>the really severe and specific articulation</p>
<p>and understanding and feeling</p>
<p>of how bad things really would be</p>
<p>if someone engaged in a particular behavior</p>
<p>or avoided a particular behavior.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the component of homework</p>
<p>given by the clinician</p>
<p>for the person to be able to create a broader set of contexts</p>
<p>in which they can deal with the anxiety,</p>
<p>not engage in the compulsions.</p>
<p>And then a very unique feature of treatment of OCD</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t see in many other psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>are home visits.</p>
<p>I find this fascinating.</p>
<p>I think that the field of psychiatry and psychology</p>
<p>traditionally doesn&rsquo;t allow for or invite home visits,</p>
<p>but this component of context,</p>
<p>location and context being so vital</p>
<p>to the treatment and relief of OCD</p>
<p>has inspired many psychiatrists and psychologists</p>
<p>to get permission to do home visits</p>
<p>where they actually go visit their patients</p>
<p>in their native setting, in their home cages, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not mice, but in their home home cages, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being facetious here, but people,</p>
<p>mice live in cages, at least in the laboratory,</p>
<p>and humans generally live in houses or elsewhere.</p>
<p>So they visit them in their home</p>
<p>in order to see how they&rsquo;re interacting</p>
<p>and the particular locations</p>
<p>that evoke the most anxiety and the least anxiety.</p>
<p>Some of the, I don&rsquo;t want to call them crutches,</p>
<p>but some of the tools that people are using</p>
<p>to confront and deal with the obsessions and compulsions,</p>
<p>and in particular, to try and identify</p>
<p>some of the tools and tricks that people are using</p>
<p>to try and avoid that heightened anxiety.</p>
<p>Because once again, and I know I&rsquo;m repeating myself,</p>
<p>but I think this is just so vital and so unique about OCD</p>
<p>and the treatment of OCD,</p>
<p>the critical need for the patient</p>
<p>to be able to tolerate extremely elevated levels of anxiety</p>
<p>is so crucial.</p>
<p>So if people are avoiding certain rooms in the house,</p>
<p>or if people are avoiding certain foods</p>
<p>or certain locations in the kitchen,</p>
<p>the clinician can start to identify that</p>
<p>by mere observation.</p>
<p>And I should mention here that patients</p>
<p>are not always aware of how they are interacting</p>
<p>with their home environment.</p>
<p>Some of these patterns are so deeply ingrained in people</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t even realize</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re constantly turning to the left</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t even realize</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re only washing their hands</p>
<p>on one side of the sink.</p>
<p>And so the clinician, by visiting the home,</p>
<p>can start to interrogate a bit in a polite way,</p>
<p>in a friendly, in a supportive way as to,</p>
<p>hey, do you ever think about why you always</p>
<p>flip the faucet to the left</p>
<p>or flip the faucet to the right, et cetera?</p>
<p>Now, we all do a lot of things that are habitual.</p>
<p>We all do things that are somewhat regular from day to day.</p>
<p>In fact, I would invite you to ask yourself,</p>
<p>do you always put your toothbrush in the same location?</p>
<p>Do you always cap the toothbrush before or after you use it?</p>
<p>What sorts of things do you do?</p>
<p>Do you wipe the little threading on the toothpaste or not?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody, I confess that I have,</p>
<p>well, I have about 3,500 pet peeves,</p>
<p>but one of my pet peeves is toothpaste</p>
<p>kind of on the thread of the toothpaste.</p>
<p>It really bothers me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Almost as much as trying to wipe it off bothers me,</p>
<p>which creates a certain challenge.</p>
<p>And if I talk about this any further,</p>
<p>then I think I would qualify</p>
<p>for obsessive compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>But I have to say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t experience a ton of anxiety about it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t govern my life.</p>
<p>In fact, I realized that right now,</p>
<p>there are tubes of toothpaste</p>
<p>that have toothpaste along the thread</p>
<p>everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really bother me.</p>
<p>I can still sit here</p>
<p>and provide some information about OCD to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not intrusive, at least not to my awareness.</p>
<p>So by the home visit,</p>
<p>the therapist can really start to explore</p>
<p>through direct questioning</p>
<p>and can allow the patient to explore</p>
<p>through direct questioning of themselves,</p>
<p>the things that it might be conscious of</p>
<p>and the things that they might not be conscious of</p>
<p>that would qualify for OCD.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to just briefly summarize</p>
<p>the key elements of cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>and exposure therapy</p>
<p>and how they can be combined with drug treatments</p>
<p>that are very effective.</p>
<p>Much of what I&rsquo;m going to talk about next</p>
<p>relates to the data and indeed the practice</p>
<p>of an incredible research scientist and clinician.</p>
<p>So this is Helen Blair Simpson</p>
<p>or I should say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson</p>
<p>because she is indeed an MD, medical doctor</p>
<p>and a PhD research scientist</p>
<p>at Columbia University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>And one of the world&rsquo;s foremost experts,</p>
<p>if not the expert,</p>
<p>I would put her in a category</p>
<p>of maybe just one to three people</p>
<p>who is most knowledgeable about the mechanisms of OCD,</p>
<p>is actively researching OCD in humans,</p>
<p>trying to find new treatments,</p>
<p>trying to unveil new mechanisms</p>
<p>and expand on our current understanding</p>
<p>and who also treats OCD quite actively in her own clinic.</p>
<p>Dr. Simpson gave a beautiful presentation</p>
<p>which she summarized some of the core elements of CBT</p>
<p>and exposure therapy</p>
<p>for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorders.</p>
<p>She describes that the key procedures are exposures,</p>
<p>of course, done in person</p>
<p>and with the actual thing</p>
<p>that evokes the obsessions and compulsions.</p>
<p>So this could be the sweaty towel as described earlier</p>
<p>or could be any number of different triggers</p>
<p>done with the patient in real time.</p>
<p>So in vivo, as we say.</p>
<p>And it could also be things that are imaginal,</p>
<p>sitting somebody down in a chair in an office and saying,</p>
<p>okay, I want you to imagine the thing</p>
<p>that triggers the intrusive thought</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s just focus on the intrusive thought as it arises</p>
<p>and then to explore and expose the patient</p>
<p>to their obsessions and compulsions that way.</p>
<p>So it can be real or it can be imaginal.</p>
<p>And the goal, of course, then is to gradually</p>
<p>and progressively increase the level of anxiety,</p>
<p>but then to intervene in so-called ritual prevention</p>
<p>to prevent the person from engaging in the compulsion.</p>
<p>The goals, again, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here,</p>
<p>are to, as she states, disconfirm fears</p>
<p>and challenge the beliefs</p>
<p>about the obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>to intervene in the thoughts and the behaviors</p>
<p>and to break the habit of ritualizing and avoiding.</p>
<p>Now, how is this typically done?</p>
<p>What are the nuts and bolts of this procedure?</p>
<p>Typically, this is done through two planning sessions</p>
<p>with the patient.</p>
<p>So describing to the patient what will happen</p>
<p>and when it will happen and how long it will happen</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re not just thrown into this out of the blue.</p>
<p>And then 15 exposure sessions done twice a week or more.</p>
<p>So the one thing to really understand</p>
<p>about cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>is that it can take some period of time,</p>
<p>several or more weeks, as many as 10 or 12 weeks.</p>
<p>However, as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>many of the drug treatments that are effective</p>
<p>in treating OCD either alone</p>
<p>or in combination with behavioral therapies</p>
<p>also can take eight, 10, 12 weeks or longer.</p>
<p>And many of those never work at all.</p>
<p>So even though 10 to 12 weeks</p>
<p>seems like a long period of time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually pretty standard.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see more complete description</p>
<p>of the protocols for cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>and exposure therapy for OCD,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide links to two papers,</p>
<p>Kozak and Foe, F-O-A, which is published in 1997,</p>
<p>which might seem like a long time ago,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, the protocols are still very useful.</p>
<p>And then the second paper is by that last author,</p>
<p>Foe et al in 2012.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll provide links to both of those.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Blair Simpson and others have explored</p>
<p>what are the best treatments for patients with OCD</p>
<p>by comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone,</p>
<p>placebo, so essentially no intervention</p>
<p>or something that takes an equivalent amount of time,</p>
<p>but is not thought to be effective in treatment,</p>
<p>as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</p>
<p>So what is an SSRI?</p>
<p>An SSRI is a drug that prevents the reuptake</p>
<p>of serotonin at the synapse.</p>
<p>What are synapses?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the little spaces between neurons</p>
<p>where neurons communicate with one another</p>
<p>by vomiting little bits of chemical</p>
<p>into the space, the synapse,</p>
<p>and then those chemicals either evoke</p>
<p>or suppress the electrical activity</p>
<p>of the next neuron across the synapse.</p>
<p>And in this case, the neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>the chemical that we&rsquo;re referring to is serotonin.</p>
<p>SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,</p>
<p>prevent the reuptake of the chemical that&rsquo;s left,</p>
<p>in this case, the serotonin that&rsquo;s left in the synapse</p>
<p>after that, I called it vomiting to be dramatic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not actually a vomiting,</p>
<p>the extrusion of the chemical into the synapse.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, there&rsquo;s more serotonin around</p>
<p>to have more of an effect over time,</p>
<p>the net effect being more serotonergic transmission,</p>
<p>more serotonin overall.</p>
<p>So not more serotonin being made,</p>
<p>more serotonin being available for use.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what an SSRI does.</p>
<p>So they compared cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs.</p>
<p>They also had the placebo group</p>
<p>and they had cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>plus the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.</p>
<p>This was a 12-week study done as described before,</p>
<p>two times a week over the course of 12 weeks.</p>
<p>First of all, the most important thing, of course,</p>
<p>placebo did nothing.</p>
<p>It did not relieve the OCD to any significant degree.</p>
<p>How did they know that?</p>
<p>They gave them the Y-box test that we talked about before,</p>
<p>the Yale-Brown test with all those questions</p>
<p>of which I read a few.</p>
<p>So the OCD severity that one has to have on the Y-box</p>
<p>is measured in terms of an index that goes from any,</p>
<p>here from eight all the way up to 28,</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p>
<p>So that number eight is kind of meaningless here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in terms of an index</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only meaningful for the Y-box.</p>
<p>But if somebody has a threshold of 16 or higher,</p>
<p>it means that they&rsquo;re still having</p>
<p>somewhat debilitating symptoms</p>
<p>or very debilitating symptoms.</p>
<p>Placebo did not reduce the obsessions or compulsions</p>
<p>to any significant degree.</p>
<p>However, and I think quite excitingly,</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral therapy had a dramatic effect</p>
<p>in reducing the obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>such that by four weeks, that score,</p>
<p>that in this case ranged from eight to 28,</p>
<p>dropped all the way from 25 down to about 11.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge drop in the severity of the symptoms.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>is that when you look at the effects of SSRIs</p>
<p>in the treatment of OCD symptoms,</p>
<p>they had a significant effect</p>
<p>in reducing the symptoms of OCD</p>
<p>that showed up first at four weeks</p>
<p>and then continued to eight weeks.</p>
<p>In fact, there was a progressive and further reduction</p>
<p>in OCD symptoms from the four to eight week period.</p>
<p>Again, these are the people just taking the SSRI.</p>
<p>And then it sort of flattened out a little bit</p>
<p>such that by 12 weeks,</p>
<p>there was still a significant reduction in OCD symptoms</p>
<p>for people taking SSRIs as compared to placebo.</p>
<p>But the severity of their symptoms was still much greater</p>
<p>than those receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone.</p>
<p>So at least in this study,</p>
<p>and I should tell you which study it is,</p>
<p>this is Faux, Leibowitz, et al., 2005</p>
<p>in the American Journal of Psychiatry.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also provide a link to this</p>
<p>so you can peruse the data if you like.</p>
<p>But at least in this study,</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral therapy was the most effective.</p>
<p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, less effective.</p>
<p>So what happens when you combine them?</p>
<p>Well, they explored that as well.</p>
<p>And the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>and the SSRIs together</p>
<p>did not lead to any further decrease in OCD symptoms.</p>
<p>This points to the idea</p>
<p>that cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>is the most effective treatment.</p>
<p>And again, when I say cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m still referring</p>
<p>to cognitive behavioral slash exposure therapy</p>
<p>done in the way that I detailed before,</p>
<p>twice a week for 12 weeks or more.</p>
<p>So all of the data, at least in this study,</p>
<p>point to the fact that cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>is really effective and the most effective.</p>
<p>Does it alleviate OCD symptoms for everybody?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is it very time-consuming?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Twice a week for two sessions or more of 15 minutes,</p>
<p>sometimes in the office, plus there&rsquo;s homework,</p>
<p>plus in an ideal case,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also home visits from the psychiatrist</p>
<p>or psychologist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of investment, a lot of time investment,</p>
<p>to say nothing of the potential financial investment.</p>
<p>Now, Dr. Blair Simpson has given some beautiful talks</p>
<p>where she describes these data</p>
<p>and also emphasizes the fact that</p>
<p>despite the demonstrated power</p>
<p>of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of OCD,</p>
<p>most people are given drug treatment</p>
<p>simply because of the availability</p>
<p>of those drug treatments.</p>
<p>Now, when I say most people,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>most people who actually go seek treatment</p>
<p>because a really important thing to realize</p>
<p>is that most people with OCD</p>
<p>do not actually go seek evidence-based treatment.</p>
<p>I want to repeat that.</p>
<p>Most people with OCD do not seek evidence-based treatment,</p>
<p>which is a tragic thing.</p>
<p>One of the motivations for doing this podcast episode</p>
<p>is to try and encourage people</p>
<p>who think they may have persistent obsessions</p>
<p>and compulsions to seek treatment.</p>
<p>But most people don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons we spelled out earlier,</p>
<p>shame, et cetera.</p>
<p>Of those that do,</p>
<p>the first line of attack is typically a prescription,</p>
<p>most often an SSRI,</p>
<p>although not always just SSRIs</p>
<p>because soon we&rsquo;ll talk about the somewhat common use</p>
<p>of also prescribing a low dose of a neuroleptic</p>
<p>or an antipsychotic.</p>
<p>Not always, but often.</p>
<p>So the important thing to understand here</p>
<p>is that excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson</p>
<p>understand that while there are treatments</p>
<p>that we could say are best or are ideal based on the data,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s being deployed</p>
<p>most often in the general public.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Dr. Simpson and others</p>
<p>have explored in a very practical way</p>
<p>whether or not it matters if somebody</p>
<p>is getting SSRI treatment</p>
<p>and is experiencing that reduction in OCD symptoms,</p>
<p>that as you may recall is more than</p>
<p>what they would experience with placebo alone,</p>
<p>but not as dramatic a reduction in OCD symptoms</p>
<p>as they would get with cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>there was this exploration of combining</p>
<p>drug treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>from the outset,</p>
<p>but they also quite impressively explored what happens</p>
<p>when people who are already taking SSRIs</p>
<p>initiate cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>This is a really wonderful thing that they&rsquo;ve done this</p>
<p>because in doing that,</p>
<p>first of all, they&rsquo;re acknowledging that</p>
<p>there are many people out there who have sought treatment</p>
<p>and are getting some relief from those SSRIs,</p>
<p>but it perhaps is not as much relief as they could get.</p>
<p>And they are actively acknowledging that</p>
<p>many people are getting these drug treatments first.</p>
<p>In fact, most often people are getting</p>
<p>these drug treatments first.</p>
<p>So what happens when you add in cognitive behavioral therapy?</p>
<p>Well, the good news is when you add</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>to someone who&rsquo;s already taking SSRIs,</p>
<p>that further improves their symptoms.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s different than the results</p>
<p>that I described before from the same laboratory, in fact,</p>
<p>that if you combine cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>with SSRIs from the outset,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no additional benefit of SSRI.</p>
<p>However, as I just described,</p>
<p>if someone is already taking an SSRI</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re experiencing a reduction in their OCD symptoms,</p>
<p>by adding in cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a further reduction in the symptoms of OCD.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>So for those of you that have sought treatment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re taking a SSRI,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re thinking about treatment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re prescribed an SSRI,</p>
<p>the ideal scenario really would be to combine</p>
<p>the drug treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>or in some cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a decision that you really have to make</p>
<p>with the close advice and oversight of a licensed physician</p>
<p>because of course these are prescription drugs.</p>
<p>And anytime you&rsquo;re going to add</p>
<p>or remove a prescription drug or change dosage,</p>
<p>you really want to do that in close discussion</p>
<p>with and on the advice of your physician.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect me,</p>
<p>I say that to protect you</p>
<p>and because it&rsquo;s just the right thing to do.</p>
<p>So again, cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>is extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Drug treatments seem less powerful,</p>
<p>though if you&rsquo;re already on a drug treatment,</p>
<p>adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really help.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been talking about SSRIs</p>
<p>and I described a little bit about how they work</p>
<p>at a kind of superficial level</p>
<p>of keeping more serotonin in the synapse</p>
<p>so that more serotonin can be in action</p>
<p>as opposed to gobbled back up by those neurons.</p>
<p>I should just mention</p>
<p>what some of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are.</p>
<p>So things like clomipramine,</p>
<p>which is not entirely selective,</p>
<p>I should say that that one generally falls</p>
<p>into a category of less selective,</p>
<p>so it can impair or can enhance</p>
<p>some of the other neurotransmitter</p>
<p>or neuromodulator systems like epinephrine, et cetera.</p>
<p>The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are,</p>
<p>at least the classic ones are fluoxetine, Prozac,</p>
<p>fluvoxamine, fluvox, peroxetine,</p>
<p>sertraline, citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>There are about six classic SSRIs.</p>
<p>Some of them like citalopram are used in children</p>
<p>and are available in pediatric doses.</p>
<p>Some like Prozac may or may not be used in children.</p>
<p>The details of which SSRIs, et cetera,</p>
<p>is a very extensive literature and discussion.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that which drugs to use</p>
<p>and at which dosage and whether or not to continue,</p>
<p>excuse me, the same dosage over time</p>
<p>depends a lot on the individual variation</p>
<p>that people express and the responses that they have.</p>
<p>All of these drugs, in fact,</p>
<p>I think we can say all drugs have side effects.</p>
<p>The question is how detrimental</p>
<p>those side effects are to daily life.</p>
<p>The SSRIs are well-known to have effects on appetite.</p>
<p>In some cases, they abolish appetite.</p>
<p>In some cases, they just reduce it a little bit.</p>
<p>In some cases, they increase appetite,</p>
<p>at least highly individual.</p>
<p>They can have effects on libido.</p>
<p>For instance, they can reduce sex drive,</p>
<p>sometimes in a dose-dependent way,</p>
<p>sometimes in a way that&rsquo;s more like a step function</p>
<p>where people are fine at say five or 10 milligrams,</p>
<p>but then they get to 15 milligrams</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a cliff for their libido.</p>
<p>That can happen, it really depends.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t take those dosages as exact values</p>
<p>because this is going to depend</p>
<p>on what they&rsquo;re being used for,</p>
<p>depression or anxiety or OCD,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also going to depend on the drug, et cetera.</p>
<p>I just threw out those numbers as a way to illustrate</p>
<p>what a kind of a step function would look like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gradual, it&rsquo;s immediate at a given dose</p>
<p>is what that means.</p>
<p>The other thing is that some of these drugs</p>
<p>will have transient effects,</p>
<p>so side effects that show up and then disappear,</p>
<p>or sadly, people will sometimes take these drugs for a while</p>
<p>and then side effects will surface later</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t there previously,</p>
<p>depending on life factors, nutrition factors,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a very complicated landscape overall.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>to explore any kind of drug treatment, SSRI or otherwise,</p>
<p>really in close communication with a psychiatrist</p>
<p>who really understands the pharmacokinetics</p>
<p>and has a lot of patient history and experience with them.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m about to tell you next</p>
<p>is most certainly going to come as a big surprise,</p>
<p>which is that despite the fact</p>
<p>that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</p>
<p>can be effective in reducing the symptoms of OCD,</p>
<p>at least somewhat, and certainly more than placebo,</p>
<p>there is very little, if any, evidence</p>
<p>that the serotonin system is disrupted in OCD.</p>
<p>And I have to point out</p>
<p>that this is a somewhat consistent theme</p>
<p>in the field of psychiatry.</p>
<p>That is, a given drug can be very effective</p>
<p>or even partially effective in reducing symptoms</p>
<p>or in changing the overall landscape</p>
<p>of a psychiatric disorder or illness,</p>
<p>and yet there is very little, if any, evidence</p>
<p>that that particular system is what&rsquo;s causal for OCD</p>
<p>or anxiety or depression, et cetera.</p>
<p>This is just the landscape that we&rsquo;re living in</p>
<p>in terms of our understanding of the brain and psychiatry</p>
<p>and the ways of treating brain disorders.</p>
<p>So as a consequence,</p>
<p>there are a huge number of academic reviews</p>
<p>that clinicians and research scientists have generated</p>
<p>and read and share.</p>
<p>One of the more, I think, thorough ones in recent years</p>
<p>was published in 2021.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to this.</p>
<p>This is by an excellent, truly excellent researcher</p>
<p>from Yale University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>I should say, not just a researcher,</p>
<p>but a clinician scientist, again, an MD, PhD.</p>
<p>This is Christopher Pittenger,</p>
<p>and the title of the review</p>
<p>is Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies and New Targets in OCD.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;ll provide a link to it.</p>
<p>This is a just gorgeous review describing,</p>
<p>as I just told you,</p>
<p>that the serotonin system isn&rsquo;t really disrupted in OCD,</p>
<p>and yet SSRIs can be very effective.</p>
<p>The review goes on to explore</p>
<p>even what sorts of receptors for serotonin</p>
<p>might be involved if it&rsquo;s, in fact,</p>
<p>the case that serotonin is a culprit</p>
<p>in the creation of OCD symptoms.</p>
<p>Talk about the serotonin 2A receptor</p>
<p>and the serotonin 1A receptor.</p>
<p>Why am I mentioning all that detail</p>
<p>if, in fact, it&rsquo;s not clear serotonin is involved?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ll just tell you right now,</p>
<p>there is currently a lot of interest</p>
<p>in whether or not some of the psychedelics,</p>
<p>in particular psilocybin,</p>
<p>can be effective in the treatment of OCD.</p>
<p>Psilocybin has been shown in various clinical trials,</p>
<p>in particular, the clinical trials</p>
<p>done at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</p>
<p>by Matthew Johnson and others.</p>
<p>Matthew was on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on the Tim Ferriss podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a world-class researcher</p>
<p>on the use of psychedelics for depression</p>
<p>and other psychiatric challenges.</p>
<p>And there, psilocybin treatment has been seen,</p>
<p>at least in those trials, to be very effective</p>
<p>in the treatment of certain kinds of major depression.</p>
<p>Currently, the exploration of psilocybin</p>
<p>for the treatment of OCD has not yielded similar results,</p>
<p>although the studies are ongoing.</p>
<p>Again, has not yielded similar effectiveness,</p>
<p>but the studies are ongoing.</p>
<p>And the serotonin 2A receptor</p>
<p>and the serotonin 1A receptors</p>
<p>are primary targets for the drug psilocybin.</p>
<p>So I figured there were going to be some questions</p>
<p>about whether or not psychedelics help with OCD.</p>
<p>Thus far, it&rsquo;s inconclusive.</p>
<p>If any of you have been part of clinical trials</p>
<p>or have knowledge or intuition about this relationship</p>
<p>or potential relationship, I should say,</p>
<p>between psilocybin or other psychedelics and OCD,</p>
<p>please put them in the comment section.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>One thing I should point out</p>
<p>is that even though serotonin</p>
<p>has not been directly implicated in OCD,</p>
<p>serotonin and the general systems of serotonin,</p>
<p>the circuits in the brain that carry serotonin</p>
<p>and depend on it,</p>
<p>have been shown to impact cognitive flexibility</p>
<p>and inflexibility, which are kind of hallmark themes of OCD.</p>
<p>So in animals that have their serotonin depleted</p>
<p>or in humans that have very low levels of serotonin,</p>
<p>you can see evidence of cognitive inflexibility,</p>
<p>challenges in task switching,</p>
<p>challenges in switching the rules</p>
<p>by which one performs a game,</p>
<p>challenges in any kind of cognitive domain switching.</p>
<p>And so that does indirectly implicate serotonin</p>
<p>in some of the aspects of OCD.</p>
<p>Again, when one starts to explore</p>
<p>the different transmitter systems</p>
<p>that have been explored in animal models and in humans,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a vast, vast landscape,</p>
<p>but serotonergic drugs do seem to be</p>
<p>the most effective drugs in treating OCD,</p>
<p>despite the fact, again, despite the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no direct evidence</p>
<p>that serotonin systems are the problem in OCD.</p>
<p>If you recall the corticostriatothalamic loop</p>
<p>that is so central to the etiology,</p>
<p>the presence and the patterns of symptoms in OCD,</p>
<p>of course, serotonin is impacting that system.</p>
<p>Serotonin is impacting just about every system in the brain,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no evidence that tinkering</p>
<p>with serotonin levels specifically in that network</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s leading to the improvements in OCD.</p>
<p>However, if people go into a fMRI scanner</p>
<p>and those people have OCD</p>
<p>and they evoke the obsessions and compulsions,</p>
<p>you see activity in that corticostriatothalamic loop.</p>
<p>Treatments like SSRIs that reduce the symptoms of OCD</p>
<p>equate to a situation where there is less activity</p>
<p>in that loop.</p>
<p>And I should point out cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>which we have no reason to believe</p>
<p>only taps into the serotonin system.</p>
<p>I think it would be an extreme stretch.</p>
<p>It would be false actually to say</p>
<p>that cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>taps only into the serotonin system.</p>
<p>Clearly it&rsquo;s going to affect a huge number of circuits</p>
<p>in neurochemical systems.</p>
<p>People who do cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>and find some relief for OCD,</p>
<p>they also show reductions</p>
<p>in those corticostriatothalamic loops.</p>
<p>So basically we have a situation</p>
<p>where we have a behavioral therapy that works</p>
<p>in many people, not all,</p>
<p>and we have a pretty good understanding</p>
<p>of about why it works.</p>
<p>It increases anxiety tolerance</p>
<p>and interference with pattern execution,</p>
<p>getting people to not engage in the same sorts of behaviors</p>
<p>that are detrimental to them.</p>
<p>And we have drug treatments that work</p>
<p>at least to some degree,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know how they work</p>
<p>or where they work in the brain.</p>
<p>One of the things that really unifies</p>
<p>the behavioral treatments and the drug treatments</p>
<p>is that they take some period of time.</p>
<p>Some relief from symptoms seems to show up</p>
<p>around four weeks and certainly by eight weeks</p>
<p>for both cognitive behavioral therapy and the SSRIs.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really at the 10 to 12 week stage</p>
<p>when someone&rsquo;s been doing these twice a week</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral sessions</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve been taking a SSRI for 10 to 12 weeks</p>
<p>that the really significant reduction</p>
<p>in OCD symptoms starts to really show up.</p>
<p>Now, up until now, I&rsquo;ve been talking about the fact</p>
<p>that people are getting relief from these treatments.</p>
<p>But sadly, in the case of OCD,</p>
<p>there is a significant population</p>
<p>that simply does not respond to CBT or to SSRIs</p>
<p>or to their combination,</p>
<p>which is why psychiatrists also explore</p>
<p>the combination of SSRIs and neuroleptics</p>
<p>or drugs that tap into the so-called dopamine system</p>
<p>or the glutamate system.</p>
<p>These are other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators</p>
<p>that impact different circuits in the brain.</p>
<p>And just to really remind you</p>
<p>what neurotransmitters and neuromodulators do,</p>
<p>because this is important to contextualize all this,</p>
<p>neurotransmitters are typically involved</p>
<p>in the rapid communication between neurons.</p>
<p>And the two most common neurotransmitters for that</p>
<p>are the neurotransmitter glutamate,</p>
<p>which we say is excitatory,</p>
<p>meaning when it&rsquo;s released into the synapse,</p>
<p>it causes the next neuron to be more active or active,</p>
<p>and GABA, which is a neurotransmitter that is inhibitory,</p>
<p>meaning when it&rsquo;s released into the synapse,</p>
<p>typically, not always, but typically,</p>
<p>that GABA is going to encourage the next neuron</p>
<p>to be less electrically active or even silence its activity.</p>
<p>The neuromodulators, by contrast,</p>
<p>so not neurotransmitters, but neuromodulators,</p>
<p>like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and acetylcholine and others,</p>
<p>operate a little bit differently.</p>
<p>They tend to act a little bit more broadly.</p>
<p>They can act within the synapse,</p>
<p>but they can also change the general patterns</p>
<p>of activity in the brain,</p>
<p>making certain circuits more likely to be active</p>
<p>and other circuits less likely to be active.</p>
<p>So when we say dopamine does X or dopamine does Y</p>
<p>or serotonin does X or serotonin does Y,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really do one thing.</p>
<p>They change the sort of overall tonality.</p>
<p>They make it more likely or less likely</p>
<p>that certain circuits will be active.</p>
<p>You can think of them as kind of activating playlists</p>
<p>or genres of activity in the brain,</p>
<p>rather than being involved in the specific communication</p>
<p>or specific songs, if you will, in this analogy,</p>
<p>or discussions between particular neurons.</p>
<p>So when we hear that SSRIs increase serotonin</p>
<p>and reduces symptoms of OCD,</p>
<p>or a neuroleptic reduces the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>and makes people feel calmer, for instance,</p>
<p>or can remove some stereotyped repetitive motor behavior,</p>
<p>which they can either generate</p>
<p>or reduce motor behavior, it turns out.</p>
<p>So when I say that, what I&rsquo;m referring to is the fact</p>
<p>that these neuromodulators are turning up the volume</p>
<p>on certain circuits and turning down the volume</p>
<p>on other circuits.</p>
<p>I say that because if you are going to explore</p>
<p>drug treatments, again, with a licensed physician,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to explore drug treatments for OCD,</p>
<p>and in particular, if you are not getting results</p>
<p>from SSRIs or you&rsquo;re not getting results</p>
<p>from cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>or the side effect profiles of the drugs</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re taking for OCD are causing problems</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want to take them,</p>
<p>well, then it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that anytime you take one of these drugs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not acting specifically</p>
<p>on the corticostriatal thalamic circuit.</p>
<p>That would be wonderful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the future of psychiatry.</p>
<p>But as now, when you take a drug, it acts systemically.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s impacting serotonin in your gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also impacting serotonin in other areas of the brain,</p>
<p>hence the effects on things like digestion or libido</p>
<p>or any number of different things</p>
<p>that serotonin is involved in.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you take a neuroleptic like haloperidol</p>
<p>or something that reduces dopamine transmission,</p>
<p>well, then it&rsquo;s going to have some motor effects</p>
<p>because dopamine is involved in the generation</p>
<p>of motor sequences and smooth limb movement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people with Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have much dopamine will get a resting tremor,</p>
<p>have a hard time generating smooth movement.</p>
<p>And so the side effects start to make sense</p>
<p>given the huge number of different neural circuits</p>
<p>that these different neuromodulators are involved in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that to be discouraging.</p>
<p>I say that to encourage patience</p>
<p>and careful systematic exploration</p>
<p>of different drug treatments for OCD.</p>
<p>Always, again, with the careful and close guidance</p>
<p>and oversight of a psychiatrist</p>
<p>because psychiatrists really understand</p>
<p>which side effect profiles make it likely</p>
<p>that you can or cannot or will never</p>
<p>or maybe someday we&rsquo;ll be able to take a given drug</p>
<p>at a given dose.</p>
<p>They are the ones that really have that knowledge.</p>
<p>This is not the sort of thing that you want to cowboy</p>
<p>and go try and figure out yourself.</p>
<p>Now, I also want to acknowledge</p>
<p>that there are other forms of drug treatments.</p>
<p>We touched on psilocybin briefly,</p>
<p>but there are other forms of drug treatments</p>
<p>that have been explored for OCD.</p>
<p>Earlier, we talked a little bit about cannabis.</p>
<p>Why would cannabis be a place of exploration at all?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, a number of people</p>
<p>try and self-medicate for OCD.</p>
<p>There is some clinical evidence,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about recreational use,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about clinical evidence</p>
<p>that cannabis can reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>Now, earlier we were talking about not reducing anxiety,</p>
<p>but learning anxiety tolerance in order to deal with</p>
<p>and treat OCD in the context of cognitive behavioral</p>
<p>therapies.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily rule out cannabis as a candidate</p>
<p>for the treatment of OCD.</p>
<p>And in fact, this has been explored.</p>
<p>A study from Dr. Blair Simpson herself looked at this.</p>
<p>This was a fairly small-scale study.</p>
<p>So first of all, I&rsquo;ll give you the title</p>
<p>and again, we&rsquo;ll provide a link.</p>
<p>This is entitled Acute Effects of Cannabinoids</p>
<p>on Symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,</p>
<p>a Human Laboratory Study.</p>
<p>Very briefly, this was 14 adults with OCD.</p>
<p>They had prior experience with cannabis.</p>
<p>This was randomized, placebo-controlled.</p>
<p>The cannabis was smoked.</p>
<p>They had different varietals, as they&rsquo;re called.</p>
<p>They had a placebo.</p>
<p>So this is basically a condition in which certain subjects</p>
<p>consumed a cigarette that had 0% THC,</p>
<p>others had 7% THC, other groups that is,</p>
<p>or some had 0.4% CBD and THC.</p>
<p>So they looked at CBD.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people out there are interested in CBD.</p>
<p>This is one of the few studies I could find</p>
<p>where they explored different percentages of THC and CBD</p>
<p>in these cannabis or marijuana cigarettes, basically.</p>
<p>The total amount that they consumed,</p>
<p>I believe was 800 milligrams.</p>
<p>These again are not suggestions.</p>
<p>This is just simply reporting what&rsquo;s in this study.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll provide a link.</p>
<p>They looked at OCD symptoms ratings.</p>
<p>They looked at cardiovascular effects.</p>
<p>They had a large number of different things</p>
<p>that they explored.</p>
<p>And I should say this study was done in 2020,</p>
<p>and it was the first placebo-controlled investigation</p>
<p>of cannabis in adults with obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>Pretty interesting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just reading from their conclusions here.</p>
<p>The data suggests that smoked cannabis,</p>
<p>whether containing primarily THC or CBD,</p>
<p>remember they looked at different concentrations of those,</p>
<p>has little acute impact,</p>
<p>meaning immediate impact on OCD symptoms,</p>
<p>and yield smaller reductions in anxiety compared to placebo.</p>
<p>So they did not see a, when I say a positive effect,</p>
<p>I mean a ameliorative effect,</p>
<p>an effect in reducing symptoms of OCD from cannabis or CBD,</p>
<p>which, you know, it&rsquo;s unfortunate.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s unfortunate anytime a treatment doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, those are the data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are going to be other studies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are also going to be people</p>
<p>in the YouTube comment section saying</p>
<p>that cannabis and CBD helps their OCD symptoms.</p>
<p>At least I anticipate there probably will.</p>
<p>Almost everything I say here,</p>
<p>somebody will contradict it with something</p>
<p>from their experience, which I encourage, by the way.</p>
<p>I want to hear about your experience with certain things,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not from randomized placebo-controlled studies,</p>
<p>I still find it very interesting</p>
<p>to know what people are doing and what they&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the better uses</p>
<p>of social media comment sections</p>
<p>is to be able to share some of that,</p>
<p>not in an advice-giving way or a prescriptive way,</p>
<p>but simply as a way to share</p>
<p>and encourage different types of exploration.</p>
<p>There are other sorts of drug treatments</p>
<p>that are gaining popularity for OCD,</p>
<p>at least in the research realm.</p>
<p>One treatment that is a legal, L-E-G-A-L, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes when I say legal,</p>
<p>sometimes people think I say illegal,</p>
<p>but that is legal, at least by prescription</p>
<p>in the United States, is ketamine.</p>
<p>The actions of ketamine are somewhat complex,</p>
<p>although we know, for instance,</p>
<p>that ketamine acts on the glutamate system.</p>
<p>It tends to disrupt the transmission</p>
<p>or the relationship, I should say,</p>
<p>between glutamate, right?</p>
<p>Not glutamine, not the amino acid,</p>
<p>but glutamate, the neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>and the so-called NMDA,</p>
<p>the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor,</p>
<p>which is a receptor that&rsquo;s very special</p>
<p>in the nervous system</p>
<p>because when glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor,</p>
<p>it tends to offer the opportunity</p>
<p>for that particular synapse to get stronger,</p>
<p>so-called neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And ketamine is essentially an antagonist,</p>
<p>although it works through a complicated mechanism.</p>
<p>It tends to block that binding of glutamate</p>
<p>to the NMDA receptor or the effectiveness of that.</p>
<p>Ketamine therapy is now being used quite extensively</p>
<p>for the treatment of trauma and for depression.</p>
<p>It leads to a dissociative state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a so-called dissociative analgesic.</p>
<p>And there are a variety of ways in which that happens.</p>
<p>We did an episode on depression.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do another entire episode</p>
<p>all about ketamine,</p>
<p>describing the networks that ketamine impacts, et cetera.</p>
<p>Ketamine therapies are being explored for OCD.</p>
<p>As of now, the data look somewhat promising,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still a lot more work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>My read of the data</p>
<p>are that the more extensive clinical trials</p>
<p>have not happened yet.</p>
<p>The smaller studies that have happened</p>
<p>reveal that some patients do get some relief</p>
<p>from ketamine therapy for OCD,</p>
<p>but there was nothing overwhelmingly pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that ketamine is a magic bullet for OCD treatment.</p>
<p>So cannabis, CBD, at least now,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s one smaller study,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no real evidence that it can alleviate OCD symptoms.</p>
<p>If there are new studies published soon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be sure to update you.</p>
<p>And if you see those studies, please send them to me.</p>
<p>Ketamine therapy, the jury is still out.</p>
<p>Psilocybin, the jury is still out.</p>
<p>These are early days.</p>
<p>Another treatment that&rsquo;s becoming somewhat common,</p>
<p>or at least people are commonly excited about,</p>
<p>is transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>
<p>So this is the use of a magnetic coil.</p>
<p>This is completely non-invasive</p>
<p>placed on one portion of the skull,</p>
<p>and one can direct magnetic energy</p>
<p>toward particular areas of the brain to either suppress,</p>
<p>or nowadays you can also activate particular brain regions.</p>
<p>There are some interesting data</p>
<p>showing that if TMS is applied to areas of the brain</p>
<p>involved in the generation of motor action,</p>
<p>so the so-called motor areas,</p>
<p>or supplementary motor areas, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>while people think about or have intrusive thoughts,</p>
<p>we know that the TMS coil can interrupt the motor behaviors,</p>
<p>the compulsive behaviors,</p>
<p>and at least in a small cohort of studies,</p>
<p>in a small number of patients within those studies,</p>
<p>this has been shown to be effective,</p>
<p>not just while the coil is on the head, of course,</p>
<p>but after the study has been performed,</p>
<p>or the treatment&rsquo;s been performed,</p>
<p>in reducing OCD symptoms by disrupting the tendency</p>
<p>for the compulsive behavior to be so automatic.</p>
<p>One of the key features of obsessive-compulsive disorder</p>
<p>is that, you know,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s been around for a while,</p>
<p>the person&rsquo;s been dealing with it for a while,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t a pattern in which the person thinks,</p>
<p>oh, I have this, you know, contamination fear,</p>
<p>or I need symmetry,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m kind of obsessed to count to the number seven,</p>
<p>and then they pause and they go, and then they do it.</p>
<p>No, typically, there&rsquo;s a very close pairing</p>
<p>of the obsession and the compulsion in time</p>
<p>so that somebody&rsquo;s walking down the street thinking,</p>
<p>one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,</p>
<p>one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven,</p>
<p>seven, seven, five, six, seven, five, six, seven,</p>
<p>whatever they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re doing this in such rapid succession</p>
<p>because the obsessions are coming up so quickly, right?</p>
<p>Thoughts can be generated very quickly,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re generating the compulsions</p>
<p>as a way to beat down or to try and suppress that anxiety,</p>
<p>and then it comes right back up again at even stronger,</p>
<p>as I described earlier.</p>
<p>So transcranial magnetic stimulation</p>
<p>seems to intervene in these various fast processes.</p>
<p>Right now, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that TMS is a magic bullet either.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement about TMS,</p>
<p>and in particular, I really want to nail this point home,</p>
<p>in particular, there&rsquo;s excitement about the combination</p>
<p>of TMS with drug treatments,</p>
<p>or the combination of TMS with cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>and this is a really important point,</p>
<p>not just for sake of discussion</p>
<p>about obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>but also depression, ADHD, schizophrenia,</p>
<p>any number of different psychiatric challenges</p>
<p>and disorders, in most cases,</p>
<p>are going to respond best to a combination</p>
<p>of behavioral treatment that&rsquo;s ongoing</p>
<p>that occurs in the laboratory and clinical setting,</p>
<p>but also in the home setting where there&rsquo;s homework,</p>
<p>maybe even home visits.</p>
<p>Drug treatments often, not always,</p>
<p>are a terrific augment to those cognitive behavioral</p>
<p>therapies or other behavioral therapies,</p>
<p>and then, now we are living in the age</p>
<p>of brain-machine interface.</p>
<p>You have companies like Neuralink</p>
<p>that I think it&rsquo;s fair to say are going to enter</p>
<p>the brain-machine interface world first</p>
<p>through the treatment of certain syndromes, right?</p>
<p>Movement syndromes or psychiatric syndromes,</p>
<p>probably before they start putting electrodes</p>
<p>into the brain to stimulate enhanced memory</p>
<p>or enhanced cognition, who knows?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>behind the walls of Neuralink, but I have to imagine,</p>
<p>in fact, I would wager, maybe not both arms,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll wager my left arm that the first set</p>
<p>of FDA-approved technologies to come out of companies</p>
<p>like Neuralink are going to be those for the treatment</p>
<p>of things like Parkinson&rsquo;s and movement disorders</p>
<p>and cognitive disorders, rather than, shall we say,</p>
<p>kind of recreational cognitive enhancement</p>
<p>or things of that sort.</p>
<p>So transcranial magnetic stimulation is non-invasive.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t involve going down below the skull.</p>
<p>Can have some effect, but most laboratories</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of at Stanford and elsewhere</p>
<p>that are exploring TMS for things like OCD</p>
<p>and other types of psychiatric challenges</p>
<p>are using TMS in combination with drug therapies,</p>
<p>are using, in some cases, for instance,</p>
<p>a laboratory at Stanford, hope to get them on the podcast,</p>
<p>a psychiatrist, Nolan Williams, is exploring TMS</p>
<p>in combination with psychedelic therapies,</p>
<p>not necessarily at the same time,</p>
<p>but nonetheless combining them or exploring</p>
<p>how they impact brain circuitry.</p>
<p>So if you have OCD, should you run out and get TMS</p>
<p>or should you try ketamine therapy, of course,</p>
<p>with a licensed physician?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s too early to say yes.</p>
<p>I think the answer is we need to wait and see.</p>
<p>I think cognitive behavioral therapy, the SSRIs,</p>
<p>and some other drug treatments like neuroleptics</p>
<p>combined with SSRIs and cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>are where the real bulk of the data are.</p>
<p>I want to make one additional point about cannabis CBD</p>
<p>as it relates to obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s not at all surprising that cannabis CBD</p>
<p>did not improve symptoms of OCD</p>
<p>because in my discussion with Dr. Paul Conti</p>
<p>a few weeks ago, and as you mentioned,</p>
<p>Dr. Conti is indeed a medical doctor, a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>We were talking about cannabis and its various uses</p>
<p>because it does have some clinical applications.</p>
<p>And he mentioned that one of the main effects of cannabis</p>
<p>is to tighten focus and to enhance concentration on</p>
<p>and thoughts about one particular thing.</p>
<p>And in some cases that can be clinically beneficial.</p>
<p>And in other cases that can be clinically detrimental.</p>
<p>If you accept the idea that cannabis increases focus</p>
<p>and you think about OCD and the networks involved,</p>
<p>and you think about the anxiety and the relationship</p>
<p>between the obsession and compulsion,</p>
<p>well, then it shouldn&rsquo;t come as any surprise</p>
<p>that cannabis did not improve the symptoms of OCD</p>
<p>because if anything, it would increase focus</p>
<p>on the obsessions and the compulsions.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not what they observed.</p>
<p>They did not see an exacerbation or a worsening</p>
<p>of the symptoms of OCD with cannabis.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s not my read of the data,</p>
<p>but they did not see an improvement</p>
<p>in OCD symptoms with cannabis or CBD.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s not surprising</p>
<p>given that cannabis, CBD seems to increase focus.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the research on</p>
<p>and the roles of hormones in OCD,</p>
<p>because it turns out to be</p>
<p>a very interesting relationship there.</p>
<p>But before I do, I want to point out something</p>
<p>that I realized I probably should have said earlier,</p>
<p>which is one of the key things for someone with OCD</p>
<p>to come to understand if they&rsquo;re going to experience</p>
<p>any relief of their symptoms,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re doing drug treatments</p>
<p>or behavioral treatments or otherwise,</p>
<p>is that thoughts are not as bad as actions, right?</p>
<p>Thoughts are not as bad as actions.</p>
<p>One of the rules that people with OCD</p>
<p>seem to adopt for themselves is that thoughts</p>
<p>are really truly the equivalent of actions.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll have an intrusive thought,</p>
<p>and we haven&rsquo;t spent too much time on this today,</p>
<p>but earlier I touched on the fact that</p>
<p>some of the intrusive thoughts that people have in OCD</p>
<p>are really disturbing.</p>
<p>They can be really gross,</p>
<p>or at least gross to that person.</p>
<p>They can evoke imagery that is toxic or infectious</p>
<p>or is highly sexualized in a way</p>
<p>that is disturbing to them, can be very taboo.</p>
<p>This is not uncommon</p>
<p>when you start talking to people with OCD</p>
<p>and you start pulling on the thread.</p>
<p>Again, this would be a psychiatrist</p>
<p>who is trained to ask the right questions</p>
<p>and gain the comfort and trust of a patient.</p>
<p>They start to reveal that these thoughts</p>
<p>are really intrusive and kind of disturbing,</p>
<p>which is why they feel so compelled</p>
<p>to try and suppress them with behaviors.</p>
<p>One of the powerful elements of treatment for OCD</p>
<p>is to really support the patient</p>
<p>and make them realize that thoughts are just thoughts</p>
<p>and that everyone has disturbing thoughts.</p>
<p>And then oftentimes those disturbing thoughts</p>
<p>arise at the most inconvenient</p>
<p>and sometimes what seems like</p>
<p>the most inappropriate circumstances.</p>
<p>And this relates to a whole larger discussion</p>
<p>that we could have about what are thoughts</p>
<p>and why do they surface?</p>
<p>And how come when you stand at the edge of a bridge,</p>
<p>even if you do not want to jump off,</p>
<p>you think about jumping off.</p>
<p>And this has to do with the fact that your nervous system</p>
<p>as a prediction machine is oftentimes testing possibilities.</p>
<p>And sometimes that testing goes way off</p>
<p>into the netherlands of the thought patterns</p>
<p>and emotional patterns that we all have inside of us.</p>
<p>The big difference between a thought and an action</p>
<p>is that, of course, the nervous system is one case,</p>
<p>not translating those patterns of thinking</p>
<p>into motor sequences.</p>
<p>That nerdy way of saying thoughts aren&rsquo;t actions,</p>
<p>believe it or not, can be helpful for people</p>
<p>if they really think about that</p>
<p>and use it as an opportunity to realize that,</p>
<p>first of all, they&rsquo;re not crazy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not thinking and feeling this stuff</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re bad or evil.</p>
<p>And of course, sometimes this can cross over</p>
<p>with other elements of life</p>
<p>where we place moral judgment on people</p>
<p>for certain behaviors.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of a healthy society, of course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we have laws and punishments</p>
<p>and rewards for that matter,</p>
<p>for certain types of behaviors.</p>
<p>But this idea that thoughts are not as bad as actions</p>
<p>and that thoughts can be tolerated</p>
<p>and the anxiety around thoughts can be tolerated</p>
<p>and over time can diminish,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very powerful hallmark theme</p>
<p>of the treatment of OCD.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention it.</p>
<p>Thoughts are not actions.</p>
<p>Actions can harm us.</p>
<p>They can harm other people.</p>
<p>They can soak up enormous amounts of time.</p>
<p>Thoughts can soak up enormous amounts of time.</p>
<p>They can be very troubling.</p>
<p>They can be very detrimental.</p>
<p>We, of course, want to be sensitive to that.</p>
<p>But when it really comes down to it,</p>
<p>the first step in treatment for OCD is this realization</p>
<p>or the approach to the realization</p>
<p>that thoughts are not as bad as actions.</p>
<p>So what about hormones in OCD?</p>
<p>Well, this has been explored,</p>
<p>albeit not as extensively as I would have liked to find.</p>
<p>But when I went into the literature,</p>
<p>I found one particularly interesting study</p>
<p>entitled Neurosteroid Levels in Patients</p>
<p>with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,</p>
<p>first author Erbe.</p>
<p>And as always, we&rsquo;ll provide a link to the study.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to explore serum</p>
<p>within blood, neurosteroid levels in people with OCD.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because of the relationship between OCD and anxiety</p>
<p>and the fact that in stress-related disorders</p>
<p>such as anxiety and depression,</p>
<p>the hormones have been extensively explored,</p>
<p>but not so much in OCD, at least until this study.</p>
<p>So they compared serum levels</p>
<p>of a number of different hormones,</p>
<p>progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone.</p>
<p>This was done in 30 patients with OCD</p>
<p>and 30 healthy controls.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a huge study,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s enough to draw some pretty nice conclusions.</p>
<p>These subjects were 18 to 49 years old,</p>
<p>and the controls were age and sex matched,</p>
<p>healthy volunteers, again, no OCD.</p>
<p>What was the basic takeaway from the study?</p>
<p>The basic takeaway from the study</p>
<p>was that in females with OCD,</p>
<p>there was evidence for significantly elevated cortisol</p>
<p>and DHEA.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s interesting because cortisol</p>
<p>is well-known to be associated with the stress system,</p>
<p>although every day, I should mention,</p>
<p>we all, male or female,</p>
<p>everybody experiences an increase in cortisol</p>
<p>shortly after awakening.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy increase in cortisol.</p>
<p>Late shifted, I mean, late in the day peaks in cortisol,</p>
<p>where a shift in that cortisol peak to later in the day</p>
<p>is a known correlate of depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>So the fact that cortisol is elevated in DHEA</p>
<p>or elevated in female patients with OCD</p>
<p>suggests that the cortisol is either reflective of</p>
<p>or causal for the increase in anxiety.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the direction of that effect.</p>
<p>Now, in the male patients with OCD,</p>
<p>there was evidence for increased cortisol,</p>
<p>again, not surprising given the role of anxiety in cortisol,</p>
<p>or I should say, given the role of cortisol in anxiety</p>
<p>and the increasing anxiety seen in OCD,</p>
<p>but there are also significant reductions in testosterone,</p>
<p>which should also not surprise us</p>
<p>because cortisol and testosterone more or less compete</p>
<p>in some fashion for their own production.</p>
<p>Both are derived from the molecule cholesterol,</p>
<p>and there are certain biochemical pathways</p>
<p>that can either direct that cholesterol molecule</p>
<p>toward cortisol synthesis or testosterone synthesis,</p>
<p>but not both.</p>
<p>So they compete.</p>
<p>So when cortisol goes up in general,</p>
<p>not always, but in general,</p>
<p>testosterone goes down and vice versa.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the relationship</p>
<p>between cortisol and testosterone,</p>
<p>and there are even some tools to try and optimize</p>
<p>those ratios in both males and females,</p>
<p>you can find that in our episode</p>
<p>on optimizing testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>Now, I would say the most interesting aspect of this study</p>
<p>is not that DHEA and cortisol are elevated</p>
<p>in females with OCD,</p>
<p>or that cortisol and testosterone have this opposite effect,</p>
<p>cortisol up and testosterone down in males</p>
<p>with OCD, but rather the relationship</p>
<p>between all of those, DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone,</p>
<p>in terms of GABA.</p>
<p>GABA, again, being this inhibitory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>that tends to quiet certain neuronal pathways.</p>
<p>It does different things at different synapses,</p>
<p>but in general, the more GABA that&rsquo;s present,</p>
<p>the more inhibition that&rsquo;s present,</p>
<p>and therefore the more suppression of neural activity.</p>
<p>And DHEA is known to be a potent antagonist</p>
<p>of the GABA system, okay?</p>
<p>So here we have elevated DHEA in females,</p>
<p>and I should also mention that testosterone</p>
<p>is also known to tap into the GABA system.</p>
<p>Typically when testosterone is elevated,</p>
<p>GABA transmission at least is slightly elevated.</p>
<p>So here we have a situation in which the pattern of hormones</p>
<p>in females and males with OCD are different</p>
<p>from those in people without OCD,</p>
<p>such that GABA transmission is altered,</p>
<p>and the net effect would be an overall reduction in GABA.</p>
<p>Now, GABA, as an inhibitory neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>and broadly speaking, is associated</p>
<p>with lower levels of anxiety,</p>
<p>and it tends to create balance</p>
<p>within various neural circuits.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a very broad statement,</p>
<p>but we know, for instance, in epilepsy,</p>
<p>that GABA levels are reduced,</p>
<p>and therefore you get runaway excitation</p>
<p>of certain circuits in the brain, and therefore seizures,</p>
<p>either petit mal, mini seizures,</p>
<p>or grand mal, massive seizures,</p>
<p>or even drop seizures where people completely collapse</p>
<p>to the floor in seizure.</p>
<p>You may have seen this before.</p>
<p>I certainly have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very dramatic,</p>
<p>and it actually is quite debilitating for people</p>
<p>because obviously they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>when these seizures are coming on most often,</p>
<p>and then they can fall into a stove</p>
<p>or while driving, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the situation with OCD is one in which,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, we don&rsquo;t know the direction of effect,</p>
<p>certain hormones are elevated in females,</p>
<p>and certain hormones are elevated in males,</p>
<p>and those hormones differ between males and females,</p>
<p>and yet they both funnel into a system</p>
<p>where GABAergic, or GABA transmission in the brain,</p>
<p>is reduced because of this ability</p>
<p>for those particular hormones to be antagonists to GABA,</p>
<p>and as a consequence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s likely to be overall levels of increased excitation</p>
<p>in certain networks in the brain,</p>
<p>and that brings us back</p>
<p>to this corticostriatal thalamic loop,</p>
<p>this repetitive loop that seems to reinforce,</p>
<p>or we can say reinforces obsession,</p>
<p>leads to anxiety, leads to compulsion,</p>
<p>leads to transient relief of anxiety,</p>
<p>but then increase in anxiety, increased obsession,</p>
<p>anxiety, compulsion, anxiety, compulsion,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So I have not found studies</p>
<p>that have explored adjusting testosterone levels</p>
<p>through exogenous administration,</p>
<p>cream or injection or otherwise,</p>
<p>or that have focused on reducing DHEA in females.</p>
<p>If anyone is aware of such studies,</p>
<p>please put them in the comment section on YouTube</p>
<p>or send them to us.</p>
<p>We have a contact site on the website at hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>but the comment section on YouTube would be best,</p>
<p>but because we know that hormones impact neuromodulators</p>
<p>and neurotransmitters, as I just described,</p>
<p>and that those neuromodulators and neurotransmitters</p>
<p>play an intimate role in the generation</p>
<p>and the treatment of things like OCD,</p>
<p>it stands to reason that manipulations</p>
<p>of those hormone systems, however subtle or dramatic,</p>
<p>might, I want to highlight,</p>
<p>might prove useful in adjusting the symptoms of OCD,</p>
<p>and I hope that this is an area</p>
<p>that researchers are going to pursue in the very near future</p>
<p>because many of the treatments for reducing DHEA</p>
<p>or increasing testosterone or reducing cortisol</p>
<p>have already made it through FDA approval.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out there, they&rsquo;re readily prescribed.</p>
<p>Many of them are already in generic form,</p>
<p>which means that the patents have already lapsed</p>
<p>on the first versions of those drugs,</p>
<p>so when they&rsquo;re available as generic drugs,</p>
<p>very often they&rsquo;re available at significantly lower cost.</p>
<p>All right, there&rsquo;s a whole discussion to be had there</p>
<p>about patent laws and prescription drugs,</p>
<p>but because these drugs are largely available</p>
<p>in prescription yet generic form,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a great opportunity to explore</p>
<p>how hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, and DHEA,</p>
<p>but the huge category of hormones</p>
<p>might impact the symptoms of OCD,</p>
<p>especially since many of the symptoms of OCD</p>
<p>show up right around the time of puberty.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked a lot about childhood OCD</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going to do an entire series</p>
<p>on childhood psychiatric disorders and challenges,</p>
<p>but many children develop OCD early,</p>
<p>as young as three or four, believe it or not,</p>
<p>or even six or seven and 10,</p>
<p>and in adolescence and certainly around puberty</p>
<p>and in young adulthood.</p>
<p>It is rare, although it does happen,</p>
<p>that people will develop OCD very late in life,</p>
<p>around 40 or older, just kind of spontaneously.</p>
<p>Most often, when you look at their clinical history,</p>
<p>you find that either they were hiding it</p>
<p>or it was being suppressed in some way,</p>
<p>or if it does spontaneously show up late in life,</p>
<p>like mid-30s or in one&rsquo;s 40s.</p>
<p>Typically, there&rsquo;s a traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>could be due to stroke or physical injury to the head</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is a interesting correlation</p>
<p>between the onset of puberty and certain forms of OCD.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain forms of, or I should say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain aspects of menopause that can relate to OCD.</p>
<p>You can find all these things in the literature,</p>
<p>all of this to say that hormones</p>
<p>impact neurotransmitters and neuromodulators,</p>
<p>which clearly impact the kinds of circuits</p>
<p>that are involved in OCD.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that, and I would hope that,</p>
<p>there would be an exploration of how these hormones</p>
<p>impact OCD in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>Now, there is an extensive literature</p>
<p>exploring how testosterone therapy,</p>
<p>both in males and females, can be effective,</p>
<p>in some cases, in the treatment of anxiety-related disorders</p>
<p>but not, at least to my knowledge, in OCD in particular.</p>
<p>So this whole area of the use of testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression,</p>
<p>or maybe even enhancement for the treatment of OCD</p>
<p>is essentially a big black box</p>
<p>that very soon, I believe, will be lit.</p>
<p>I realize that a number of listeners of this podcast</p>
<p>are probably interested in the non-typical</p>
<p>or holistic treatments for OCD.</p>
<p>Dr. Blair Simpson&rsquo;s lab has at least one study</p>
<p>exploring the role of mindfulness meditation</p>
<p>for the treatment of OCD.</p>
<p>There, the data are a little bit complicated.</p>
<p>And I should mention that good things are happening,</p>
<p>at least in the United States, probably elsewhere as well,</p>
<p>but good things are happening in terms of the exploration</p>
<p>of things like meditation and other,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call them non-traditional or holistic forms</p>
<p>of treatment for psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>because of the division of complementary health</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now been launched</p>
<p>by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>So whereas before people would think about meditation</p>
<p>or yoga nidra, or even CBD supplementation for that matter</p>
<p>as kind of fringe maybe, or kind of woo,</p>
<p>or non-traditional at the very least,</p>
<p>the National Institutes of Health in the United States</p>
<p>has now devoted an entire division, right?</p>
<p>An entire institute purely for the exploration</p>
<p>of things like breathing practices, meditation, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a cancer institute,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hearing and deafness institute,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a vision institute,</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s this complementary health institute,</p>
<p>which I think is a wonderful addition</p>
<p>to the more traditional aspects of medicine.</p>
<p>I think no possible useful treatment should be overlooked</p>
<p>or unresearched in my opinion,</p>
<p>provided that can be done safely.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson&rsquo;s lab has looked</p>
<p>at the role of mindfulness meditation</p>
<p>and the treatment of OCD.</p>
<p>Now we should all keep in mind, no pun intended,</p>
<p>that most of the data on mindfulness meditation</p>
<p>shows that it increases the ability to focus.</p>
<p>Now this brings us back to a kind of repeating theme today,</p>
<p>which is that increased focus may not be the best thing</p>
<p>for somebody with OCD because it might increase focus</p>
<p>on the obsession and or compulsion.</p>
<p>Turns out that mindfulness meditation can be useful</p>
<p>in the treatment of OCD,</p>
<p>but mainly by way of how it impacts the focus on</p>
<p>and the ability to engage in cognitive behavioral therapies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very unlikely, at least by my read of the data,</p>
<p>to be a direct effect of meditation</p>
<p>on relieving the symptoms.</p>
<p>Rather, it seems that meditation is increasing focus</p>
<p>on things like cognitive behavioral therapy homework</p>
<p>and to not focus on other things</p>
<p>and therefore indirectly improving the symptoms of OCD.</p>
<p>Now, somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,</p>
<p>there have also been a fairly large number of studies</p>
<p>exploring how nutraceuticals,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re sometimes called supplements,</p>
<p>that are available over the counter</p>
<p>can impact the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s such an extensive number</p>
<p>of different compounds and supplements</p>
<p>that fall under the category of nutraceuticals</p>
<p>and that have been explored in the treatment of OCD</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to point you to a review</p>
<p>that is entitled Nutraceuticals</p>
<p>and the Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,</p>
<p>a review, excuse me, of mechanistic and clinical evidence.</p>
<p>This was published in 2011, so it&rsquo;s over 10 years old.</p>
<p>And so by now, I have to imagine</p>
<p>that there are an enormous number of additional substances</p>
<p>that could be explored,</p>
<p>but there are just one or two here that I want to focus on.</p>
<p>Here in this review,</p>
<p>they describe effects of 5-HTP and tryptophan,</p>
<p>so things that are in the serotonin pathway,</p>
<p>which would make sense given what we know about the SSRIs,</p>
<p>that people would explore how different supplements</p>
<p>that increase serotonergic transmission might impact OCD.</p>
<p>What you find is that they do have significant effects</p>
<p>in improving or reducing the symptoms of OCD</p>
<p>in somewhat similar way to some of the SSRIs,</p>
<p>but you, of course, have to be careful.</p>
<p>Anything that&rsquo;s going to tap</p>
<p>into a given neurochemical system to the same degree</p>
<p>may very likely have the same sorts of side effects</p>
<p>that a prescription drug would.</p>
<p>One compound that I&rsquo;d like to focus on</p>
<p>in a little more depth, however,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s exciting and interesting to me, is inositol.</p>
<p>Inositol is a compound that we are going to talk about</p>
<p>in several future podcasts because, well, first of all,</p>
<p>it seems that it can have pretty impressive effects</p>
<p>on reducing anxiety.</p>
<p>It also can have pretty impressive effects</p>
<p>in improving fertility,</p>
<p>in particular in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m referring specifically to myoinositol</p>
<p>because it comes in several forms.</p>
<p>And it does appear that 900 milligrams of inositol</p>
<p>can improve sleep and can reduce anxiety,</p>
<p>perhaps when taken at that dosage or higher dosages.</p>
<p>I will just confess, first of all, I don&rsquo;t have OCD,</p>
<p>although I will also confess that when I was a child,</p>
<p>I had a transient tick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this on podcast before.</p>
<p>It was a grunting tick.</p>
<p>So when I was about six or seven,</p>
<p>I recall a trip to Washington DC with my family</p>
<p>where I was feeling a strong desire or need even,</p>
<p>as I recall, to grunt</p>
<p>in order to clear something in my throat,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have anything in my throat.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a cold or any post-nasal drip.</p>
<p>It was really just the feeling that I needed to do that</p>
<p>to release some sort of tension.</p>
<p>And I remember my dad at the time telling me,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good to grunt or something like that.</p>
<p>I think he saw that it was kind of compulsive behavior.</p>
<p>And so I would actually hide in the backseat</p>
<p>of the rental car and do it, or I&rsquo;d hide in my room.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, it was transient.</p>
<p>I think about six months or a year later, it disappeared.</p>
<p>Although I did notice,</p>
<p>actually an ex-girlfriend of mine pointed out</p>
<p>that when I get very tired</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been working very long hours,</p>
<p>sometimes that grunting tick will reappear.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Do I have Tourette&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe.</p>
<p>I was never diagnosed with Tourette&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Do I have OCD?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I certainly could be accused</p>
<p>of having obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about still in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But the point here is that many children</p>
<p>transiently express ticks or low-level Tourette&rsquo;s or OCD,</p>
<p>and again, transiently, and it disappears over time.</p>
<p>So inositol has been explored</p>
<p>in a bunch of different contexts,</p>
<p>including for ticks and OCD, et cetera.</p>
<p>Going back to inositol and its current use,</p>
<p>or I should say my current use,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking 900 milligrams of inositol</p>
<p>as an addition to my existing toolkit for sleep,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve talked about many times on this podcast</p>
<p>and other podcasts,</p>
<p>consists of magnesium threonate, apigenin, and theanine.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about that kit,</p>
<p>you can go to our newsletter,</p>
<p>Neural Network Newsletter at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>The toolkit for sleep is there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to sign up for the newsletter,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll give you a flavor of the sorts of things</p>
<p>that are in the newsletter.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ve been experimenting a bit</p>
<p>with taking 900 milligrams of myoinositol,</p>
<p>either alone or combination with that sleep kit.</p>
<p>And I must say the sleep I&rsquo;ve been getting on inositol</p>
<p>is extremely deep and does seem to lead</p>
<p>to enhanced levels of focus and alertness during the day.</p>
<p>And perhaps you&rsquo;re noticing that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m talking more quickly on this podcast</p>
<p>than in previous podcasts.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the two things relate</p>
<p>in any kind of causal way.</p>
<p>The point here is that inositol is known</p>
<p>to be pretty effective in reducing anxiety,</p>
<p>but when taken at very high dosages.</p>
<p>Can it do the same at low dosages?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would consider 900 milligrams a low dose.</p>
<p>Most of this, given the fact that most of the studies</p>
<p>of inositol have explored very high dosages,</p>
<p>like even 10 or 12 grams per day,</p>
<p>which I must say seems exceedingly high.</p>
<p>And they do report that some of the subjects</p>
<p>in those experiments actually stopped taking the inositol</p>
<p>because of gastric discomfort or gastric distress,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve reported my results with sleep</p>
<p>in a kind of anecdotal way.</p>
<p>They certainly aren&rsquo;t peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that I described about my own experience in an anecdotal way.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it&rsquo;s been explored that, you know,</p>
<p>things like glycine, which is an amino acid,</p>
<p>which also acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>in the brain, taken at very high dosages,</p>
<p>60 grams per day.</p>
<p>That is a absolutely astonishingly high amount of glycine.</p>
<p>I would not recommend taking that much glycine</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re part of a study where they tell you to</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>18 grams, excuse me, of inositol.</p>
<p>These are very, very high dosages used in these studies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there&rsquo;s some interesting data about inositol</p>
<p>leading to some alleviation of OCD symptoms</p>
<p>or partial alleviation of OCD symptoms</p>
<p>in as little as two weeks</p>
<p>after initiating the supplement protocol.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a great future for these nutraceuticals,</p>
<p>meaning, I think, more systematic exploration</p>
<p>in particular of lower dosages</p>
<p>in the context of OCD treatment.</p>
<p>And as we saw before for the SSRIs</p>
<p>and other prescription drug treatments,</p>
<p>I think there really needs to be an exploration</p>
<p>of these nutraceuticals</p>
<p>in combination with behavioral therapies</p>
<p>and who knows, maybe with brain-machine interface</p>
<p>like cranial magnetic stimulation as well.</p>
<p>Now, way back at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>I alluded to the fact that OCD is one thing,</p>
<p>obsessive-compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s truly a disorder and it&rsquo;s truly debilitating</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s extremely common.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this other thing</p>
<p>called obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,</p>
<p>which is distinct from that,</p>
<p>does not have the intrusive component.</p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t feel overwhelmed</p>
<p>or overtaken by these thoughts.</p>
<p>Rather, they find that the obsessions</p>
<p>can sometimes serve them or they even welcome them.</p>
<p>And I think many of us know people like this.</p>
<p>I perhaps even could be accused or who knows,</p>
<p>maybe have been accused of having</p>
<p>an obsessive-compulsive personality at times.</p>
<p>Why do I draw this distinction?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, we&rsquo;ve come to a point in human history,</p>
<p>I think in large part because of social media,</p>
<p>but also in large part because there are a number</p>
<p>of discussions being held about mental health</p>
<p>that have brought terms like trauma, depression, OCD,</p>
<p>et cetera, into the common vernacular</p>
<p>so that people will say, oh, you&rsquo;re so OCD</p>
<p>or someone will say, I was traumatized by that</p>
<p>or I was traumatized by this.</p>
<p>We should be very careful, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not the word police,</p>
<p>but we should be very careful in the use</p>
<p>of certain types of language,</p>
<p>especially language that has real psychiatric</p>
<p>and psychological definitions</p>
<p>because it can really draw us off course</p>
<p>in providing relief for some of these syndromes.</p>
<p>For instance, the word trauma is thrown around</p>
<p>left and right nowadays.</p>
<p>I was traumatized by this or that caused trauma</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re giving me trauma.</p>
<p>Listen, I realize that many people are traumatized</p>
<p>by certain events, including things that are said to them.</p>
<p>I absolutely acknowledge that.</p>
<p>Hence our episodes on trauma and trauma treatment,</p>
<p>several of them, in fact, Dr. Conte, Dr. David Spiegel,</p>
<p>and then dedicated solo episodes with just me blabbing</p>
<p>about trauma and trauma treatment.</p>
<p>But as Dr. Conte so appropriately pointed out,</p>
<p>trauma is really something that changes our neural circuitry</p>
<p>and therefore our thoughts and our behaviors</p>
<p>in a very persistent way that is detrimental to us.</p>
<p>Not every bad event is traumatizing.</p>
<p>Not everything that we dislike or even that we hate</p>
<p>or that feels terrible to us is traumatizing.</p>
<p>For something to reach the level of trauma,</p>
<p>it really needs to change our neural circuitry</p>
<p>and therefore our thoughts and our behaviors</p>
<p>in a persistent way that is maladaptive for us.</p>
<p>Similarly, just calling someone obsessive is one thing,</p>
<p>saying that someone has OCD or assuming one has OCD</p>
<p>simply because they have a personality or a phenotype,</p>
<p>as we say, where they need things in perfect order.</p>
<p>Like I find myself correcting these pens,</p>
<p>making sure that the caps are facing</p>
<p>in the same direction, for instance, right now.</p>
<p>That is not the same as OCD.</p>
<p>If, for instance, I can tolerate these pens</p>
<p>being at different orientation</p>
<p>or even throw the cap on the floor or something,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t create a lot of anxiety for me.</p>
<p>I can probably agree it&rsquo;s a little bit in the moment,</p>
<p>but then I can forget about it and move on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the key distinctions</p>
<p>between obsessive-compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>and obsessive-compulsive disorder in its strictest form.</p>
<p>Now, once one hears that OCD is different</p>
<p>than obsessive-compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>because of this difference</p>
<p>in how intrusive the thoughts are or not,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s useful,</p>
<p>but it really doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything</p>
<p>about what is happening mechanistically</p>
<p>in one situation or another.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are beautiful data,</p>
<p>again, from Dr. Blair Simpson&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>and you can tell based on the number of studies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve referred to from her laboratory</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s truly one of the luminaries in this field,</p>
<p>that there really are some fundamental wiring differences</p>
<p>and behavioral differences and psychological differences</p>
<p>between people who have obsessive-compulsive disorder</p>
<p>and those who have</p>
<p>obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>So this is a study, first author Pinto, P-I-N-T-O,</p>
<p>entitled Capacity to Delay Reward</p>
<p>Differentiates Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</p>
<p>and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder.</p>
<p>And the methods in this study</p>
<p>were to take 25 people with OCD</p>
<p>and 25 people with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>and 25 people who have both,</p>
<p>because it is possible to have both,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s important to point out,</p>
<p>and 25 so-called healthy controls,</p>
<p>people that don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>obsessive-compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>or obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>They take clinical assessments,</p>
<p>and then they took a number of tests</p>
<p>that probed their ability to defer gratification,</p>
<p>something called, in the laboratory,</p>
<p>we called it delayed discounting.</p>
<p>So their ability to defer gratification</p>
<p>through a task where they can either accept reward right away</p>
<p>or accept reward later.</p>
<p>Some of you may have heard of the two marshmallow task.</p>
<p>This is based on a study that was performed years ago</p>
<p>on young children at Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>where they take young children into a room,</p>
<p>they offer them a marshmallow,</p>
<p>kids like marshmallows generally,</p>
<p>and you say, you can eat the marshmallow right now,</p>
<p>or you can wait some period of time.</p>
<p>And if you are able to wait and not eat the marshmallow,</p>
<p>you can have two marshmallows.</p>
<p>And in general, children want two marshmallows</p>
<p>more than they want one marshmallow.</p>
<p>So really what you&rsquo;re probing is their ability</p>
<p>to access delayed gratification.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very entertaining,</p>
<p>even truly amusing videos of this on the internet.</p>
<p>So if you just do two marshmallow task video</p>
<p>and you go into YouTube,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is that the children will use</p>
<p>all sorts of strategies to delay gratification.</p>
<p>Some of the kids will cover the marshmallow,</p>
<p>others will talk to the marshmallow and say,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re not that delicious.</p>
<p>You look delicious, but no, you&rsquo;re not delicious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll engage with the marshmallow</p>
<p>in all sorts of cute ways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll turn around and try to avoidance,</p>
<p>which actually speaks to a whole category of behaviors</p>
<p>that people with OCD also use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying these kids had OCD,</p>
<p>but avoidance behaviors are very much a component of OCD.</p>
<p>People really trying to avoid the thing</p>
<p>that evokes the obsession.</p>
<p>Well, some kids are able to delay gratification, some aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s debatable as to whether or not the kids</p>
<p>that are able to delay gratification</p>
<p>go on to have more successful lives or not.</p>
<p>Initially, that was the conclusion of those studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of debate about it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll bring an expert on</p>
<p>to give us the final conclusion on this</p>
<p>because there is one and it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>and not intuitive.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, adults are also faced with decisions</p>
<p>every day, all day as to whether or not</p>
<p>they can delay gratification.</p>
<p>And this study used a, not a two marshmallow task,</p>
<p>but a game that involved rewards where people could delay</p>
<p>in order to get greater rewards later.</p>
<p>What is the conclusion?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>and obsessive compulsive personality disorder subjects,</p>
<p>both showed impairments in their psychosocial functioning</p>
<p>and quality of life.</p>
<p>They had compulsive behavior.</p>
<p>So these are people that are suffering in their life</p>
<p>because their compulsions are really strong.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just being really nitpicky or really orderly</p>
<p>in one case and having full-blown OCD in the other.</p>
<p>Both sets of subjects are challenged in life</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re having relationship issues</p>
<p>or job related issues, et cetera,</p>
<p>because they are that compulsive.</p>
<p>However, the individuals with obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>personality disorder, they discounted the value</p>
<p>of delayed gratification significantly less than those</p>
<p>with obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>What do I mean?</p>
<p>They are both impairing disorders that are marked</p>
<p>by compulsive behaviors.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m paraphrasing, but they can be differentiated</p>
<p>by the presence of obsessions in OCD.</p>
<p>So obsessions in OCD, people with OCD are absolutely</p>
<p>fixated on certain ideas and those ideas are intrusive.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s the hallmark theme.</p>
<p>And by an excessive capacity to delay reward</p>
<p>in obsessive compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>That is people who have obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>personality disorder are really good</p>
<p>at delaying gratification.</p>
<p>So they are able to concentrate very intensely</p>
<p>and perform very intensely in ways that allow them</p>
<p>to instill order such that they can delay reward.</p>
<p>Now you can see why this contour of symptoms,</p>
<p>meaning that the people with OCD are experiencing</p>
<p>intrusive thoughts, whereas the people</p>
<p>with obsessive compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>show an enhanced ability to defer gratification.</p>
<p>You could see how that would lead</p>
<p>to very different outcomes.</p>
<p>People with obsessive compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>can actually leverage that personality disorder</p>
<p>to perform better in certain domains of life.</p>
<p>Not all domains of life, because remember, again,</p>
<p>these people are in this study and they&rsquo;re showing up</p>
<p>as experiencing challenges in life</p>
<p>because of their obsessive compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, people with obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>personality disorder you can imagine would be very good</p>
<p>at say architecture or anything that involves</p>
<p>instilling a ton of order.</p>
<p>Maybe sushi chef, for instance, maybe a chef in general.</p>
<p>I know chefs that just kind of throw things around</p>
<p>like the chef on the Muppets and just throw things</p>
<p>everywhere and still produce amazing food.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some people where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re incredibly exacting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just incredibly precise.</p>
<p>I think that movie, what is it, Hero Dreams of Sushi?</p>
<p>That movie is incredible.</p>
<p>Certainly not saying he has obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>personality disorder, but I think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that he is obsessive or extremely meticulous</p>
<p>and orderly about everything from start to finish.</p>
<p>You can imagine a huge array of different occupations</p>
<p>and life endeavors where this would be beneficial.</p>
<p>Science being one of them, where data collection</p>
<p>and analysis is exceedingly important that one be precise</p>
<p>or mathematics or physics or engineering.</p>
<p>Anything where precision has a payoff</p>
<p>and gaining precision takes time and delay</p>
<p>of immediate gratification.</p>
<p>You can imagine that obsessive compulsive personality</p>
<p>disorder would synergize well with those sorts</p>
<p>of activities and professions.</p>
<p>Whereas obsessive compulsive disorder is really intrusive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s preventing functionality</p>
<p>in many different domains of life.</p>
<p>So the key takeaway here is that when we use the words</p>
<p>obsessive compulsive, or we call someone obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>or we are trying to evaluate whether or not</p>
<p>we are obsessive compulsive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that we highlight</p>
<p>that obsessive compulsive disorder is very intrusive.</p>
<p>It involves intrusive thoughts and it interrupts</p>
<p>with normal functioning in life.</p>
<p>Whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder,</p>
<p>while it can interrupt normal functioning in life,</p>
<p>it also can be productive.</p>
<p>It can enhance functioning in life, not just in work</p>
<p>but perhaps at home as well.</p>
<p>If you are somebody and you have family members</p>
<p>that really place enormous value on having a beautiful</p>
<p>and highly organized home,</p>
<p>well then it could lend itself well to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a matter of degrees, of course.</p>
<p>None of these things is an absolute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be on a continuum.</p>
<p>But I think it is fair to say</p>
<p>that obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>whether or not in mild, moderate or severe form</p>
<p>is impairing normal functioning.</p>
<p>Whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a range of expressions of that.</p>
<p>Some of which can be adaptive,</p>
<p>some of which can be maladaptive.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s all going to depend on context.</p>
<p>Before we conclude, I do want to touch on something</p>
<p>that I think a lot of people experience</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s superstitions.</p>
<p>Superstitions are fascinating</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some fascinating research on superstitions.</p>
<p>One particular study that I&rsquo;m a big fan of</p>
<p>is the work of Benzo Levski at Harvard.</p>
<p>He studies motor sequences and motor learning.</p>
<p>And he has beautiful data on how people learn,</p>
<p>for instance, a tennis swing</p>
<p>and the patterns that they engage in early on.</p>
<p>And then the patterns of swinging that they,</p>
<p>swinging the racket that is,</p>
<p>that they engage in later as they acquire more skill.</p>
<p>And basically the takeaway is that the amount of error</p>
<p>or variation from swing to swing is dramatically reduced</p>
<p>as they acquire skill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all fine and good.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some beautiful mechanistic data</p>
<p>that he and others have discovered</p>
<p>to support how that comes to be.</p>
<p>But they also explore animal models,</p>
<p>in particular rats pressing sequences of buttons and levers</p>
<p>to obtain a reward.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, rats are pretty smart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this with my own eyes.</p>
<p>You can teach a rat to press a lever for a pellet of food.</p>
<p>Rats can also learn to press levers</p>
<p>in a particular sequence in order to gain a piece of food.</p>
<p>And they can actually learn to press</p>
<p>an enormous number of levers in very particular sequences</p>
<p>in order to obtain pellets of food.</p>
<p>You can also give them little buttons to press</p>
<p>or even a paddle to, or I should say a pedal, excuse me,</p>
<p>to stomp on with their foot</p>
<p>in order to obtain a pedal of food.</p>
<p>Basically rats can learn exactly what they need to do</p>
<p>in order to obtain a piece of food,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re made a little bit hungry first.</p>
<p>Benz&rsquo;s lab has published beautiful data</p>
<p>showing that as animals and humans</p>
<p>come to learn a particular motor sequence,</p>
<p>very often they will introduce motor patterns</p>
<p>in that sequence that are irrelevant to the outcome</p>
<p>and yet that persist.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever watched a game of baseball,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen this before.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the pitcher up on the mound</p>
<p>will bring the ball to their chin.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll look over their shoulder,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll look back over the other shoulder,</p>
<p>and then they will, of course, reel back and pitch the ball.</p>
<p>But if you watch closely,</p>
<p>oftentimes there are components in the motor sequence</p>
<p>which are completely unrelated to the pitch.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking necessarily</p>
<p>to see if someone&rsquo;s stealing a base.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not necessarily looking down at home plate</p>
<p>where the batter is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also doing things like touching the back</p>
<p>of their ear before they bring the ball to their chin</p>
<p>or adjusting their hat.</p>
<p>And if you watch individual pitchers,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is that they&rsquo;ll do the same sequence</p>
<p>of completely irrelevant motor patterns</p>
<p>before each and every single pitch.</p>
<p>Similarly, rats that have been trained to, for instance,</p>
<p>hit two levers and step on a pedal</p>
<p>with their left hind foot and then tap a button up above,</p>
<p>that is the red button,</p>
<p>will do that to gain a piece of food.</p>
<p>But sometimes they&rsquo;ll also introduce a pattern</p>
<p>into that motor sequence</p>
<p>where they will shake their tail a little bit</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll turn their head a little bit</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll move their ears a little bit, et cetera.</p>
<p>Motor patterns that have nothing to do</p>
<p>with obtaining the particular outcome in mind.</p>
<p>In other words, you could eliminate certain components</p>
<p>of the motor sequence and it would not matter.</p>
<p>The rat would still get the pellet.</p>
<p>The pitcher would still be able to pitch.</p>
<p>And yet that can introduce because somehow,</p>
<p>because they were performed again and again,</p>
<p>prior to successful trials,</p>
<p>the rat or the human baseball pitcher</p>
<p>comes to believe in some way</p>
<p>that it was involved in generating the outcome,</p>
<p>hence superstition, right?</p>
<p>I confess I have a few superstitions.</p>
<p>I occasionally will knock on wood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say something that I want to happen</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll say, oh, knock on wood, and I&rsquo;ll just do it.</p>
<p>And occasionally I&rsquo;ll challenge myself and think,</p>
<p>ah, I don&rsquo;t want to knock, don&rsquo;t knock on wood, Andrew,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You know, no one,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone wants to be superstitious.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so every once in a while I&rsquo;ll just challenge it</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t actually knock on wood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m admitting this to you to kind of,</p>
<p>I guess, normalize some of this.</p>
<p>Some people have superstitions that border on</p>
<p>or even become compulsions.</p>
<p>They really come to believe</p>
<p>that if they don&rsquo;t knock on wood,</p>
<p>that something terrible is going to happen,</p>
<p>maybe something in particular.</p>
<p>Or in the case of the baseball pitcher,</p>
<p>they come to believe that if they don&rsquo;t touch</p>
<p>their right ear before they reel back on the pitch,</p>
<p>that the pitch won&rsquo;t be any good</p>
<p>or that they&rsquo;re going to lose the game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what their thought process is.</p>
<p>Now, I also don&rsquo;t know what the rat is thinking,</p>
<p>but the rat is clearly doing something</p>
<p>or thinking something is related to the final outcome.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any studies where they&rsquo;ve intervened</p>
<p>with the particular superstition-like behaviors of the rat</p>
<p>to see whether or not the rat somehow doesn&rsquo;t continue</p>
<p>to do the motor sequence to get the pellet.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The rats, I don&rsquo;t speak rat, most people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Or if you speak to a rat, if it speaks back,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in English.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that superstitions are beliefs</p>
<p>that we on an individual scale come to believe</p>
<p>are linked to the probability of an outcome</p>
<p>when in fact we know, we actually know</p>
<p>in our rational minds,</p>
<p>they have no real relationship to the outcome.</p>
<p>Superstitions can become full-blown compulsions</p>
<p>and obsessions when we repeat them often enough</p>
<p>that they become automatic.</p>
<p>And I think this is what we observe most of the time</p>
<p>when we see a pitcher touching their ear</p>
<p>or for instance, in tennis, you see this a lot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see someone, they&rsquo;ll slap their shoes often.</p>
<p>I see this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll slap the undersides of their soles.</p>
<p>They may tell themselves that this is, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe moving out some of the dust or something</p>
<p>in the bottoms of their soles that gives them more traction</p>
<p>and they want that to be ready for the serve</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s some truth to that.</p>
<p>But here, what we&rsquo;re referring to are behaviors</p>
<p>that really have no rational relationship to the outcome.</p>
<p>And yet we perform in a compulsive way.</p>
<p>People with OCD, yes, tend to have more superstitions.</p>
<p>People with more superstitions, yes,</p>
<p>tend to have a tendency towards OCD.</p>
<p>And I should mention obsessive-compulsive</p>
<p>personality disorder.</p>
<p>If you think way back to the first part of this episode</p>
<p>when I was just describing what the brain does, right?</p>
<p>What does your brain do?</p>
<p>Housekeeping functions to keep you alive</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a prediction machine.</p>
<p>Your neural circuits, you, have an enormous amount</p>
<p>of biological investment of real estate,</p>
<p>literally cells and chemicals that are there</p>
<p>to try and make your world predictable</p>
<p>and to try and give you control</p>
<p>or at least the sense of control over that world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a normal process.</p>
<p>Low-level superstitions, moderate superstitions</p>
<p>represent a kind of a healthy range, I would say,</p>
<p>of behaviors that are aimed at generating predictability</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t disrupt normal function.</p>
<p>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not too severe, would, I think,</p>
<p>represent the next level along that continuum.</p>
<p>And then obsessive-compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>as I pointed out earlier, is really a case</p>
<p>of highly debilitating, highly intrusive,</p>
<p>really overtake of neural circuitry</p>
<p>over our thoughts and behaviors</p>
<p>that requires very dedicated, very persistent</p>
<p>and very effective treatments</p>
<p>in order to stop those obsessions and compulsions</p>
<p>and the anxiety that links them somewhat counterintuitively</p>
<p>by teaching people to tolerate</p>
<p>that level of increased anxiety and interrupt those patterns.</p>
<p>And fortunately, as we described earlier,</p>
<p>such treatments exist, cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>drug treatments like SSRIs,</p>
<p>though also drug treatments that tap</p>
<p>into the glutamate system</p>
<p>and into perhaps also the dopamine system,</p>
<p>the so-called neuroleptics.</p>
<p>And then, as we described,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s now an extensive exploration</p>
<p>of things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis.</p>
<p>The initial studies don&rsquo;t seem to hold much promise</p>
<p>for cannabis and CBD and the treatment of OCD,</p>
<p>but who knows, maybe more studies will come along</p>
<p>that will change that story.</p>
<p>And then, of course, brain-machine interface</p>
<p>like transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>
<p>And then just to remind you what I already told you before,</p>
<p>combinations of behavioral and drug treatments</p>
<p>and brain-machine interface,</p>
<p>I think, is really where the future lies.</p>
<p>Fortunately, good treatments exist.</p>
<p>We cannot say that any one individual treatment</p>
<p>works for everybody.</p>
<p>There are fairly large percentages of people</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t respond to one set of treatments or another,</p>
<p>and therefore, one has to try different ones.</p>
<p>And then there are the so-called supplementation-based</p>
<p>or more holistic therapies.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;ve tried to cover each and all of these</p>
<p>in a fairly substantial amount of detail.</p>
<p>I realize this is a fairly long episode.</p>
<p>That is intentional.</p>
<p>Much like our episode on ADHD,</p>
<p>on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,</p>
<p>I received an enormous number of requests</p>
<p>to talk about OCD.</p>
<p>And my decision to make this a very long</p>
<p>and detailed episode about OCD</p>
<p>really doesn&rsquo;t stem from any desire</p>
<p>to subject you to too much information</p>
<p>or to avoid the opportunity to just list things off.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ve tried to provide is an opportunity</p>
<p>to really drill deep into the neural circuitry</p>
<p>and an understanding of where OCD comes from,</p>
<p>how OCD is different from things</p>
<p>like the personality disorders that I described,</p>
<p>and also to give you a sense</p>
<p>of how the individual behavioral and drug treatments work</p>
<p>and perhaps don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>so that you can really make the best informed choices.</p>
<p>Again, highlighting the fact that OCD</p>
<p>is an extremely common, extremely common,</p>
<p>and yet extremely debilitating condition,</p>
<p>and one that I hope that if any of you have</p>
<p>or that you know people that have it,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll both gain sympathy and understanding</p>
<p>for what they&rsquo;re dealing with,</p>
<p>perhaps as a consequence</p>
<p>of some of the information presented today,</p>
<p>and maybe help them direct their treatment,</p>
<p>find better treatment,</p>
<p>and of course apply those treatments for some relief.</p>

<p>During today&rsquo;s podcast and on many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like sleep and focus and anxiety and so on.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered</p>
<p>with Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>because Momentus Supplements are of the very highest quality.</p>
<p>They ship everywhere in the world, not just in the US.</p>
<p>And we wanted to have one location where people could go</p>
<p>in order to access the supplements that we describe</p>
<p>and detail the various roles of</p>
<p>here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you can find those supplements.</p>
<p>The catalog of supplements available there</p>
<p>is going to be expanding quite a bit</p>
<p>in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<p>But right now already,</p>
<p>there are a number of different supplements</p>
<p>for enhancing focus, enhancing sleep and so on</p>
<p>that are available.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following Huberman Lab</p>
<p>on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.</p>
<p>There I cover science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the content</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>and some of which is distinct from the content</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>So again, that&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on Instagram</p>
<p>and Huberman Lab also on Twitter.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already subscribed</p>
<p>to our Neural Network newsletter,</p>
<p>this is a monthly newsletter.</p>

<p>for instance, a toolkit for sleep.</p>
<p>You can download that right away.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to sign up for the newsletter.</p>
<p>You can get the toolkit for neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>for the use of cold, for the use of heat</p>
<p>and health and et cetera.</p>
<p>All of that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And if you sign up for the newsletter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get the monthly newsletter sent to you.</p>

<p>under the menu at HubermanLab.com.</p>
<p>In closing, I&rsquo;d like to thank you</p>
<p>for this in-depth discussion</p>
<p>about the mechanisms and various treatments</p>
<p>for obsessive compulsive disorder</p>
<p>and some of the related disorders.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
