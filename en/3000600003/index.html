    <ul>
<li>Good evening everyone, I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Dean of the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Welcome to tonight&rsquo;s event.</p>
<p>We are delighted to have guests</p>
<p>from the Graduate School of Journalism,</p>
<p>as well as distinguished guests</p>
<p>from our Greater Bay Area community.</p>
<p>Today is the third Chris Boskin Dean&rsquo;s Speaker series,</p>
<p>which has been made possible</p>
<p>by a generous donation by Michael Boskin,</p>
<p>in honor of his wife.</p>
<p>Chris, would you like to stand up?</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>Given Chris&rsquo;s outstanding career</p>
<p>in both business and journalism,</p>
<p>the focus of this series</p>
<p>is on the intersection of the two fields,</p>
<p>business and journalism.</p>
<p>On the Berkeley campus</p>
<p>and with so many schools leading</p>
<p>in their field of work here,</p>
<p>we have such an incredible opportunity to collaborate</p>
<p>in an effort to tackle society&rsquo;s big problems</p>
<p>across many fields.</p>
<p>The Chris Boskin&rsquo;s Speaker Series</p>
<p>aligns so well with this effort,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m especially grateful for today&rsquo;s event.</p>
<p>And now it is my pleasure</p>
<p>to introduce tonight&rsquo;s guest speaker Jann Wenner.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>Jann co-founded Rolling Stone in 1967 with Ralph Gleason,</p>
<p>a veteran music journalist.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone was a big step forward</p>
<p>for rock journalism in the United States,</p>
<p>a place for solid pieces on the biggest stars of the time.</p>
<p>Notably, the magazine also devoted space</p>
<p>to issues affecting counterculture.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone was also appreciated by musicians</p>
<p>who had a form for the first time</p>
<p>in which they could talk at length</p>
<p>about their art and other topics</p>
<p>without being subject to condescension</p>
<p>of more mainstream periodicals.</p>
<p>Jann himself</p>
<p>conducted many of the magazine&rsquo;s major interviews</p>
<p>in its early years,</p>
<p>including lengthy sessions with Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger,</p>
<p>Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, and Phil Spector.</p>
<p>As editor, Jann backed the careers of prominent writers</p>
<p>such as Hunter S. Thompson and Cameron Crowe.</p>
<p>And is credited</p>
<p>with discovering photographer Annie Leibovitz.</p>
<p>Jann also published outside US Weekly, Family Life</p>
<p>and Men&rsquo;s Journal,</p>
<p>and he helped to co-found the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>And now I also want to welcome Greil Marcus,</p>
<p>who will moderate today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>Greil and Jann first met here at UC Berkeley in 1964.</p>
<p>Three years later, Jann started Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>A year after that</p>
<p>Greil published his first record review there.</p>
<p>And the next year,</p>
<p>Jann hired Greil as Rolling Stone&rsquo;s first records editor.</p>
<p>Beyond his time with Jann at Rolling Stone,</p>
<p>Greil&rsquo;s work includes authoring multiple books</p>
<p>on politics and history</p>
<p>through the lens of culture change in music.</p>
<p>Greil also taught at Princeton,</p>
<p>the new school in New York City,</p>
<p>and the American Studies program at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Jann and Greil have been in touch</p>
<p>ever since they met at Berkeley</p>
<p>during that period of the 1960s.</p>
<p>So I am so looking forward to hearing about your connections</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>So please join me in a warm welcome to our guests,</p>
<p>Jann Wenner and Greil Marcus.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a great thrill to be here,</p>
<p>to be sitting on a stage at Cal</p>
<p>where we both went as students,</p>
<p>where I taught for so many years.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really fortuitous though,</p>
<p>is that when we walked in,</p>
<p>Bob Dylan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Like A Rolling Stone&rdquo; was playing.</p>
<p>And even with all the static coming through the speakers</p>
<p>and noise from the crowd,</p>
<p>the force of that song,</p>
<p>the just overwhelming vehement of that performance</p>
<p>just shot right through.</p>
<p>And I was always planning to begin tonight</p>
<p>with a passage from Jann&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Like A Rolling Stone,&rdquo;</p>
<p>fortuitous title too about that song.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really apt in a way,</p>
<p>is that it came from a conversation Jann and I had in 2004.</p>
<p>I was writing a book on that song</p>
<p>and I called up Jann and I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;let&rsquo;s talk about Like A Rolling Stone,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and he just opened up.</p>
<p>And I want to read you what he said that day</p>
<p>that turned up again in this book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The song is about discovering</p>
<p>what was actually going on around you.</p>
<p>Realizing that life isn&rsquo;t all you&rsquo;ve been told it is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re liberated from your false knowledge and hangups,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s frightening and you have to face that.</p>
<p>Suddenly you&rsquo;re scrounging for your next meal.</p>
<p>But say, &ldquo;do you wanna make a deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fear in that, &ldquo;do you wanna make a deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that melody, in that voice,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fear all over it.</p>
<p>And the key line is, you&rsquo;re invisible now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got no secrets to conceal.</p>
<p>Everything has been stripped away and you&rsquo;re on your own.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing to hide.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re alone with no direction home, but you&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p>That was the message.</p>
<p>It was a song of innocence and experience.</p>
<p>I always thought it was my story,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jann said all those years ago.</p>
<p>And he says in this book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought it was my story.</p>
<p>I used to go to the finest schools.</p>
<p>Nobody ever taught me how to live out on the street.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden,</p>
<p>I was on the streets of Berkeley, in a world of radicals.</p>
<p>Hells Angels, harmonica Queens, drug dealers, dope Kings,</p>
<p>and one of them called the Mystery Tramp.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m at an acid test</p>
<p>and some stranger with a top hat comes up to me</p>
<p>and I stare into the vacuum of his eyes</p>
<p>and he asks, &ldquo;do you wanna make a deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>That happened to me many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>I was listening to Rolling Stone</li>
</ul>
<p>on my AirPods coming up on the way over here</p>
<p>as I was driving through the streets of Berkeley,</p>
<p>and try and see if I could come back to that moment</p>
<p>or what was.</p>
<p>And I want to add to that,</p>
<p>knowing Greil was gonna bring this up.</p>
<p>And it was that sense</p>
<p>that when you got here in 1963 in Berkeley,</p>
<p>it was that moment of growing up at that particular time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a moment of growing up and going to college</p>
<p>where you feel independent, you&rsquo;re on your own and so forth.</p>
<p>But that moment, in that time, &lsquo;63, &lsquo;64,</p>
<p>there was a whole nother realization coming along.</p>
<p>It was more intense than any earlier people</p>
<p>who were turning 18, like our parents going to school.</p>
<p>That now you weren&rsquo;t buying into the system anymore.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t gonna buy into the fraternity system</p>
<p>or the Ivy League system,</p>
<p>all those things you went to school for</p>
<p>just to get a job, to get a degree.</p>
<p>You were now being asked in this environment,</p>
<p>given what was going on around us,</p>
<p>to upend all those assumptions</p>
<p>and understand that you were gonna throw away</p>
<p>all this security of the society,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s certainties that were going with it</p>
<p>that you were gonna go get a job.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna actually get out there and be on your own.</p>
<p>And the closer you got to the kind of culture</p>
<p>that was starting to thrive then in Berkeley,</p>
<p>political and drugs,</p>
<p>you really were on your own out there.</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>But luckily when I was doing the book,</p>
<p>I called Greil up and we just started talking.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;you should really reuse this stuff</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll send you what you told me,&rdquo;</p>
<p>which I had completely forgotten about.</p>
<p>And of course, it was so good for some reason</p>
<p>that I transcribed literally what Greil had gotten out of me</p>
<p>and put it right in that book and made a wonderful passage.</p>
<p>And it really was a wonderful passage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You write about-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you wanna make a deal?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, do you wanna make a deal?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, I was so moved by what you said.</p>
<p>And then you started talking and you dramatized it,</p>
<p>and you got to, &ldquo;that happened to me too many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Jann laughs)</p>
<p>I want to talk about something</p>
<p>that happened right at that time,</p>
<p>and that was the free speech movement</p>
<p>which you described very wonderfully</p>
<p>as a time when this campus and ultimately this country</p>
<p>was just going to split apart.</p>
<p>And you say of the administration,</p>
<p>that had no idea what was happening</p>
<p>and no idea how to handle it,</p>
<p>and was striking out blindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were trying to defend the rules</p>
<p>for no good reason other than to preserve their authority.</p>
<p>That was the moment it began.</p>
<p>The student protests of the &rsquo;60s</p>
<p>in front of my eyes on Sproul Plaza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A police car had pulled up</p>
<p>to arrest somebody who was violating university rules</p>
<p>by passing out political literature.</p>
<p>They put him in the police car</p>
<p>and within an instant,</p>
<p>people began to sit down around the police car</p>
<p>so it couldn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>And you came out of a classroom,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s around noon, something like that.</p>
<p>And the free speech movement had already started.</p>
<p>There were things going on every day,</p>
<p>but it hadn&rsquo;t come into focus yet.</p>
<p>It hadn&rsquo;t brought everyone into it.</p>
<p>I remember a cousin of mine,</p>
<p>he said, &ldquo;I came here to Cal from the East Coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I came here to go to business school,</p>
<p>and all we ever do</p>
<p>is talk about this god damn free speech movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was at that moment</p>
<p>that that conversation really began.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;re hundreds and then thousands of people</p>
<p>surrounding this police car</p>
<p>for two hours, five hours, 10 hours, 24 hours,</p>
<p>all through the night.</p>
<p>People get up,</p>
<p>are standing on top of the police car making speeches.</p>
<p>Anybody climbing out of the crowd, standing up.</p>
<p>The roof of the police car is going down and down,</p>
<p>but people keep climbing up and making more speeches.</p>
<p>And you walked out of a class</p>
<p>and you saw that the same as I did, and you sat down.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure I sat down,</li>
</ul>
<p>but I hung around for a good while.</p>
<p>It was clearly an event which should have been so minor.</p>
<p>I mean, there was the student activists surrounding it,</p>
<p>but they were a minority in Berkeley,</p>
<p>but it was this constant decision making</p>
<p>by the administration of the campus then.</p>
<p>They kept coming up</p>
<p>with stupider and stupider responses to this,</p>
<p>which kept escalating this and escalating it</p>
<p>till it finally shut down the whole campus.</p>
<p>Not as a striper,</p>
<p>just nobody as Greil&rsquo;s cousin</p>
<p>was doing anything</p>
<p>but talking about the free speech movement</p>
<p>and it galvanized and took over the entire campus.</p>
<p>It changed it in a way that it could never turn back.</p>
<p>And I remember going and seeing the Free Speech Cafe,</p>
<p>and they had something that was so galvanizing,</p>
<p>so radical then,</p>
<p>which was denounced by the state of California.</p>
<p>700 students were arrested and all that stuff,</p>
<p>it was really considered no-go by the powers that be</p>
<p>and now it was memorialized appropriately in a cafe,</p>
<p>or maybe they could have a record jail cell.</p>
<p>The beginning of the student protest movement in the &rsquo;60s</p>
<p>is too often falsely, erroneously,</p>
<p>subscribed to the student strikes</p>
<p>at the Columbia University in New York in 1968.</p>
<p>And in fact, it began here</p>
<p>along with so much else that galvanized the country.</p>
<p>The major recruiting centers</p>
<p>for the freedom rights in the South was here.</p>
<p>This campus sensed it was there,</p>
<p>this campus and all of the other campuses in the area</p>
<p>put on a protest</p>
<p>to the House on American Activities Committee hearings</p>
<p>in 1960 in San Francisco.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have them again by the way, soon I guess,</p>
<p>and drove them out of town.</p>
<p>And so the idea</p>
<p>that students would take direct action on campus</p>
<p>came from this moment here that they were talking about.</p>
<p>The guy in the police car incident,</p>
<p>his name was Jack Weinberg,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the guy who came up with the slogan,</p>
<p>&ldquo;never trust anybody over 30.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned better than that though.</p>
<p>We love people over 30.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We had to keep raising the bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then flip it around.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Never trust anybody under 30.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice Waters founded Chez Panisse in Berkeley in 1971.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s always said</p>
<p>that it came out of the free speech movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without the free speech movement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that led people to create, forge their own paths,</p>
<p>create their own institutions,</p>
<p>that never would&rsquo;ve happened.</p>
<p>You started Rolling Stone in 1967.</p>
<p>Do you think the free speech movement went into that</p>
<p>as part of what made Rolling Stone happen</p>
<p>and become the kind of paper that it was?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that Rolling Stone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real origins are here on this campus,</p>
<p>and the things that happened on this campus</p>
<p>and the things I went through while living here.</p>
<p>The beginning of my acquaintance with drugs</p>
<p>and with rock and roll.</p>
<p>I think as part of the book is that,</p>
<p>in the book, I try and tell through my own life</p>
<p>and through the prism of Rolling Stone</p>
<p>what Rolling Stone covered and wrote about,</p>
<p>and who came in and out of Rolling Stone,</p>
<p>and the stories that people like Greil and Hunter</p>
<p>and all the other people came together</p>
<p>in a particular place, at a particular time</p>
<p>with a particular spirit in mind</p>
<p>represents the story of the last of our generation,</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called, not elegantly, &ldquo;the baby boom,&rdquo;</p>
<p>but of this gray era</p>
<p>of what appears to be at least 40, 50 years of time</p>
<p>that defined America.</p>
<p>And after World War II,</p>
<p>the consequences of World War II in America.</p>
<p>So in that, I think that my own story,</p>
<p>having been raised in Marin County.</p>
<p>Having been born January &lsquo;46,</p>
<p>having had in New York,</p>
<p>my parents, both World War II veterans</p>
<p>moved to California to find their dream,</p>
<p>end up in Marin County,</p>
<p>the kind of dream county of suburban America,</p>
<p>where all these schools were built,</p>
<p>the house, of course it was baby boom</p>
<p>and roads were built and highways</p>
<p>and growing up in a suburban area</p>
<p>or somewhat rural area where I was.</p>
<p>I was there and then I&rsquo;m put here in Berkeley</p>
<p>and being at all these key places at key times.</p>
<p>My baby doctor was Dr. Spock, Benjamin Spock,</p>
<p>the leader of the thought,</p>
<p>the how you would raise these kids in the post war.</p>
<p>So I think, the security coming mandated,</p>
<p>and so I think, yes, here,</p>
<p>the soil of Berkeley gave birth to this.</p>
<p>I mean, Rolling Stone was on all those three things.</p>
<p>It was part political radical,</p>
<p>in a different way than those words may mean now,</p>
<p>part drugs, part music, part student,</p>
<p>it was out of this consciousness</p>
<p>and all those things I had here.</p>
<p>And my co-founder, Ralph Gleason,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle,</p>
<p>lived here in Berkeley on Ashby Avenue.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s on Ashby, 1841 Ashby,</p>
<p>that we planned and plotted Rolling Stone</p>
<p>in his living room.</p>
<p>And Ralph experienced all these.</p>
<p>Although older person,</p>
<p>he was actually 48 at the time,</p>
<p>and was described often by his critics</p>
<p>as being a 48 year old man</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t decide whether he was for 12 year olds</p>
<p>or 16 year olds.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>So he was never over 30.</p>
<p>We were sentenced to all the exact same things</p>
<p>that were on Ashby Avenue</p>
<p>that were happening here on campus,</p>
<p>and was the great champion in the local papers</p>
<p>for the free speech movement</p>
<p>and later the great champion for the rock and roll movement</p>
<p>with Bill Graham.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, yes.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably the most famous or celebrated writer</li>
</ul>
<p>to come out of the pages of Rolling Stone</p>
<p>was Hunter Thompson, who I never met,</p>
<p>but he was a larger than life figure</p>
<p>in the culture at large.</p>
<p>He became a great character.</p>
<p>He played a great role.</p>
<p>And I always felt after a few years that the role,</p>
<p>the celebrity role that he was forced to play,</p>
<p>that he wanted to play,</p>
<p>you would know infinitely better than I would,</p>
<p>overwhelmed his existence as a writer.</p>
<p>But one of the first things he wrote for Rolling Stone</p>
<p>was a very long story,</p>
<p>a two-part story called &ldquo;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas:</p>
<p>A Search for the American Dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reread it not very long ago.</p>
<p>I mean, when it came out in 1971, &lsquo;70?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;70, I think, yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It was overwhelming.</p>
<p>It was probably the most fun thing I ever read</p>
<p>and it stayed fun till the last pages,</p>
<p>but when I reread it a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>it struck me as so sad, as such a tragedy.</p>
<p>It reminded me so much of The Great Gatsby.</p>
<p>At the very end, it was all an alogy.</p>
<p>It was all,</p>
<p>the time to find what we were looking for has passed,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re never gonna get there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to hear what you thought</p>
<p>when you first read that and what you think now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think you&rsquo;re right in characterizing Hunter</li>
</ul>
<p>as being trapped by his fame</p>
<p>and both involuntarily and voluntarily.</p>
<p>He could have at any time turned it off,</p>
<p>but he became such a big personality and had so many fans</p>
<p>and was such a wonderful character and person to be around</p>
<p>that it was inevitable and he got swallowed by that.</p>
<p>And you mentioned this, I think you mentioned it,</p>
<p>that he reminded you of The Gatsby.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald was his favorite writer,</p>
<p>and Hunter studied him constantly.</p>
<p>He named his son, Juan Fitzgerald Thompson.</p>
<p>And Hunter, actually one time</p>
<p>when he was practicing writing, beginning writing,</p>
<p>typed up the entire Great Gatsby,</p>
<p>just so he could get the feel for the rhythm of it</p>
<p>and how Fitzgerald wrote.</p>
<p>And if you read The Great Gatsby,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see exactly</p>
<p>where Hunter got so many of those funny names</p>
<p>and funny devices and things he came out with.</p>
<p>The Gatsby is full of people with very colorful names</p>
<p>that kind of defined them in some way.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot in there,</p>
<p>but it was alogic.</p>
<p>I mean, he had decided at that point in the &rsquo;70s</p>
<p>that this great burst of idealism of the &rsquo;60s</p>
<p>was not gonna work out,</p>
<p>and that the last big chance to transform society</p>
<p>was like a wave</p>
<p>and it had broken in San Francisco in the &rsquo;60s</p>
<p>and had washed out.</p>
<p>And Hunter&rsquo;s vision of that was partially true,</p>
<p>partially not true.</p>
<p>I mean, Hunter liked the apocalypse as a theme</p>
<p>and doom as a theme.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to say why he came to the conclusions.</p>
<p>After that we sent him on the campaign trail</p>
<p>to cover the election,</p>
<p>which was certainly an exercise</p>
<p>in &lsquo;72 election when Nixon and McGovern</p>
<p>was start off as an exercise in optimism and hope,</p>
<p>and of course crashed, complete doom at the end of that.</p>
<p>And it reminds me of later on in the late &rsquo;90s,</p>
<p>Hunter wrote one of his last pieces</p>
<p>called &ldquo;Fear and Loathing in Elko.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was able to write it</p>
<p>because there was a blizzard in Aspen</p>
<p>and so the drug dealers were not able to get to his house.</p>
<p>So he had this week of clarity.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>And &ldquo;Fear and Loathing in Elko&rdquo;</p>
<p>starts with his usual description</p>
<p>of what he&rsquo;s doing in the weather</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m doing and so forth.</p>
<p>And he says he had this dream last night</p>
<p>which was a visionary sudden recollection</p>
<p>of driving to Nevada in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and going and crashing into a hoard of long-haired sheep</p>
<p>who were dying literally on the highway.</p>
<p>And he came out of his car and it was because&hellip;</p>
<p>And he picked up a hitchhiker</p>
<p>who was Judge Clarence Thomas.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>And anyway, he moves to the hotel or motel in Elko</p>
<p>where Clarence Thomas is running a porn ring</p>
<p>and a lot of positives on itself.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>I read that side by side with Vegas.</p>
<p>And whereas it made Vegas look like a dream,</p>
<p>happy land, Disneyland,</p>
<p>the cynicism and the blackness</p>
<p>of this thing about Clarence Thomas was really apparent</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t look like a fairy tale.</p>
<p>But Hunter was one of the great transformative spirits</p>
<p>of Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>I mean, he and I, for some reason</p>
<p>just hit it off enormously.</p>
<p>I recognizing in him</p>
<p>the kind of talent and charisma and thinking that he had.</p>
<p>I mean, he wrote &ldquo;The Battle of Aspen,&rdquo;</p>
<p>it was the first thing he wrote for us.</p>
<p>And oh no, it was a Chicano thing,</p>
<p>and we shared a common purpose and mission.</p>
<p>I mean, we both explicitly said to each other,</p>
<p>we have to take this opportunity</p>
<p>of Rolling Stone and its audiences in 1971</p>
<p>and use it to try and gain power in this country,</p>
<p>to try and gain at least enough power to move things along.</p>
<p>That couldn&rsquo;t we,</p>
<p>with the youth vote and all it represented,</p>
<p>in our naivete, we thought we could move this youth vote</p>
<p>to influence a presidential election.</p>
<p>And so we went about doing that.</p>
<p>And at the same time we recognized,</p>
<p>I think, in each other&hellip;</p>
<p>I saw in him the great writer</p>
<p>and the man who would be the voice of Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>I mean, more striking talent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never seen more energy.</p>
<p>And I think he saw in me the person</p>
<p>and the time, the place that belongs to the vehicle</p>
<p>where he would have the freedom and the support</p>
<p>and the encouragement to do what he wanted to do.</p>
<p>And it worked enormously for the both of us.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>we could have done parts of each of those tasks on our own.</p>
<p>He was brilliant without me</p>
<p>and I was gonna do Rolling Stone,</p>
<p>but together we really hit some extraordinary high point.</p>
<p>And it was his coverage of the elections</p>
<p>having to more than any other thing.</p>
<p>And by that time,</p>
<p>we had done the Lennon Remembers interviews,</p>
<p>and we had won magazine awards for covering Altamont,</p>
<p>breaking the Charles Manson he&rsquo;s guilty story</p>
<p>and all that stuff.</p>
<p>But it was that coverage of the main story</p>
<p>that the United States gives to any kind of journalists;</p>
<p>the race for the White House.</p>
<p>The White House we spent that campaign trail on the A story,</p>
<p>the most observed, watched story about other journalists.</p>
<p>We did something so brilliant and exceptional</p>
<p>that changed journalism forever</p>
<p>and put Rolling Stone up</p>
<p>into the first rank of American publications.</p>
<p>And endorsement for drugs, by the way.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take more drugs, you could get there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That reminds me of a class I taught here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It was on the 1978 remake</p>
<p>of &ldquo;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&rdquo;</p>
<p>directed by Phil Kaufman, who lived in San Francisco then,</p>
<p>lives in San Francisco now.</p>
<p>And I invited Phil and his wife Rose to come to my class.</p>
<p>After we showed the movie in class,</p>
<p>it was a three hour seminar.</p>
<p>And so he did, and I asked him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;why did you make this movie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I figured he was gonna say something like,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a project, I was not a famous director,</p>
<p>it was offered to me, I had a mortgage to pay,</p>
<p>so I made the movie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what he said.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;it was the beginning of the new age movement.</p>
<p>I was living in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I looked around and all I saw were pods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then his wife Rose said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;and the problem with that time, the problem with the &rsquo;60s,</p>
<p>the reason the &rsquo;60s didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>is that people didn&rsquo;t take enough drugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>And that is a theme in this book too.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, I thought in the book,</p>
<p>I had to at least be honest about this.</p>
<p>If I was gonna tell a true story of our times,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no question</p>
<p>that our generation was very tied up in a drug culture.</p>
<p>And now the drug culture is a pretty broad expression</p>
<p>to cover all the things that happened.</p>
<p>As I said before or then,</p>
<p>my experience with drugs here in Berkeley</p>
<p>was primarily with pot and LSD.</p>
<p>And at the time, there wasn&rsquo;t a lot more destructive drugs</p>
<p>like speed and cocaine.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t wanna go through all that</p>
<p>just to say that I think that LSD&hellip;</p>
<p>Cocaine turned out to be a bad drug,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to say in the book very explicitly</p>
<p>that if I had to do it again, I would not.</p>
<p>It was a waste of time and energy and money.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that, but it&rsquo;s not same time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can really regulate and ban it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna happen anyway.</p>
<p>But LSD was a big theme in it.</p>
<p>And I wanted to be honest about the drug use</p>
<p>and what it meant,</p>
<p>and both its good sides and its bad sides.</p>
<p>And I notice now what&rsquo;s coming back</p>
<p>when I was doing a Joe Rogan show and promoting this book,</p>
<p>and he brought up the idea</p>
<p>that he felt that everybody in the country,</p>
<p>that people in this country</p>
<p>would really benefit if there was more LSD,</p>
<p>if people took more psychedelic drugs.</p>
<p>In fact, it would be almost universally useful.</p>
<p>It sounds crazy,</p>
<p>but then you marry what&rsquo;s now worth seen finally at last,</p>
<p>the opening of government approved use of MDMA</p>
<p>and other psycho drugs to treat traumatized people.</p>
<p>But also this broadening use of ayahuasca was again,</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a truth</p>
<p>to the fact that if in fact you had everybody take LSD,</p>
<p>top to bottom or in some fashion and whatsoever,</p>
<p>and people in government are making government decisions</p>
<p>and decisions about war and what is gonna destroy things</p>
<p>and pumping oil.</p>
<p>Would you imagine if like the heads of oil company, Exxon,</p>
<p>and you sat around with your fellow executives</p>
<p>and took LSD and went outside</p>
<p>and you saw how beautiful nature was</p>
<p>and really how we all get that feeling we&rsquo;re all one,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m responsible for keeping this earth this way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m being very dead serious now,</p>
<p>and it sounds like the fear</p>
<p>that we are gonna poison the water supply with LSD,</p>
<p>but I think you&rsquo;d start to see a more abrupt end</p>
<p>to the policies of a lot of company.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;d have to change.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go back and live your life the same way</p>
<p>having had that insight.</p>
<p>And I might sound like some pie-eyed &rsquo;60s drug head</p>
<p>or Allen Ginsburg or Tim Leary or something like that,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a lot of truth to that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of value to that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something that should be pursued.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, you were a great editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m right, I know it.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>You were a great editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with you could be a revelation.</p>
<p>I remember bringing in one piece, you looked at it,</p>
<p>it seemed as if you looked at it for half a second</p>
<p>like to see how long it was.</p>
<p>And you said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;cut the first paragraph, cut the last paragraph.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I felt, what?</p>
<p>This is the Meat Cleaver School of Editing?</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>So I did it and looked at it,</p>
<p>it was a different piece.</p>
<p>It was so much better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d spent the first paragraph clearing my throat,</p>
<p>and I spent the last paragraph trying to wrap it up</p>
<p>with something meaningful and significant</p>
<p>that was total nonsense.</p>
<p>And there it was.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a writer</p>
<p>who appeared in the first issue of Rolling Stone</p>
<p>and for quite a long time afterwards,</p>
<p>his name is Jon Landau,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s now Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s manager</p>
<p>and has been for many, many years.</p>
<p>But he started out in the first issue of Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>And I would pick up the magazine,</p>
<p>I would pick up the paper as we called it then,</p>
<p>and I would read his columns.</p>
<p>And I was just stunned by the authority of his writing.</p>
<p>He seemed to write from deep knowledge, deep feeling.</p>
<p>He was not a great writer, he was not a stylist.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t someone</p>
<p>who would put memorable sentences together,</p>
<p>but somehow you read what he said</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;wow, let me think about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tell me about your reactions to Jon when you first read him</p>
<p>and then having him as a mainstay of Rolling Stone.</p>
<ul>
<li>I first encountered Jon&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I started Rolling Stone, I was working,</p>
<p>The Ramparts had an offshoots publication</p>
<p>called Sunday Rampart in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t get into all that,</p>
<p>but he was writing for a publication called-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Crawdaddy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it Crawdaddy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crawdaddy at Boston, Massachusetts,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>which was the first real rock and roll magazine.</p>
<p>It was kind of mimeograph thing more.</p>
<p>And it was kind of mainly students</p>
<p>writing about really arcane essays</p>
<p>about their experience with rock and roll.</p>
<p>And at that time,</p>
<p>people who were writing about rock and roll</p>
<p>really didn&rsquo;t know much about it.</p>
<p>I mean, they weren&rsquo;t trained musicians</p>
<p>and there was no scholarship of building up,</p>
<p>there was nobody else, it was just the beginning of it.</p>
<p>So primarily, they would write</p>
<p>about the record covers or the lyrics</p>
<p>and discuss the artist and what the artist meant to them.</p>
<p>But here was this one essay every time,</p>
<p>it was so authoritative</p>
<p>and by somebody who actually knew about music,</p>
<p>and talked about things like treble&hellip;</p>
<p>All the musical terminology</p>
<p>and was evaluating the playing and the producing</p>
<p>and the production and the singing and real music.</p>
<p>So I looked him up immediately when I started Rolling Stone</p>
<p>and asked him to come write for me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know who he was or anything.</p>
<p>And he wrote back.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was a junior at Brandeis</p>
<p>and another one of the people who I write about in the book</p>
<p>that I think that all came together</p>
<p>from different parts of the country,</p>
<p>with different kinds of stories</p>
<p>of this musical scholar there, Greil here,</p>
<p>Hunter Thompson there, and Lee Woods at the Art Institute,</p>
<p>and numerous others</p>
<p>that came together in this time and place</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think of as a bit like the New Yorker</p>
<p>when it started off.</p>
<p>Where all these like-minded people</p>
<p>came together with a sensibility about time and place.</p>
<p>In any case, Jon,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t afford long distance phone call thing</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;d correspond at length by letter.</p>
<p>And I tried to edit him.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true of the worst writers,</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t like editing.</p>
<p>The best writers are so grateful to have editing,</p>
<p>somebody looking at them</p>
<p>and taking care of their little things</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve forgotten.</p>
<p>And I mean, it is universally true,</p>
<p>the people who are the worst</p>
<p>are just touchy about every god damn word.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>And Jon was really touchy</p>
<p>and he threatened to quit on me early on</p>
<p>because I had edited something.</p>
<p>But he also got me</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause he didn&rsquo;t like the San Francisco groups.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like the dead,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t like the airplane on and on.</p>
<p>And he liked R&rsquo;n&rsquo;B and stuff</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s always telling me about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d just edit out his snarly stuff</p>
<p>about the San Francisco groups.</p>
<p>But anyway, we had it out.</p>
<p>We met, we became fast friends and he was&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, he had the voice of gravitas,</p>
<p>like you could feel it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s that way today, and he hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>But he, I guess, became the foundational critic,</p>
<p>would you say- - Yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>He was the most respected, revered&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>He lived in Boston the entire time, he didn&rsquo;t come out here,</p>
<p>but he managed to gain respect</p>
<p>both from all the critics that Greil had</p>
<p>on the coast here on the West coast</p>
<p>since we were writing our version of their records.</p>
<p>And also there were these critics in New York</p>
<p>who hated us no matter what we would do</p>
<p>because they thought it was their thing</p>
<p>and we were getting all the&hellip;</p>
<p>But everybody respected Landau.</p>
<p>And anyway&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, there was a book about you and Rolling Stone</li>
</ul>
<p>published a few years ago</p>
<p>called &ldquo;Sticky Fingers&rdquo; by Joe Hagan.</p>
<p>And it was a book</p>
<p>that you chose him as the person to write this book.</p>
<p>You cooperated with him.</p>
<p>You encouraged all your friends</p>
<p>and people who had worked with you over the years</p>
<p>to talk with him and be open with him.</p>
<p>And the book that came out</p>
<p>was this absolutely bizarre hatchet job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the number of biographies I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>I remember one about Herman Melville,</p>
<p>that was fundamentally, it seemed to me,</p>
<p>motivated by distaste,</p>
<p>which is a really small kind of emotion.</p>
<p>Distaste for you, distaste for the way you lived your life.</p>
<p>And distaste, I really felt this in the pages most deeply,</p>
<p>for homosexuality,</p>
<p>which is a major theme in this book.</p>
<p>In Joe Hagan&rsquo;s book, in Sticky Fingers,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got the sexual innuendo of the title right there.</p>
<p>There is a kind of ew, through the book</p>
<p>when this theme comes up</p>
<p>because you spoke very openly with him about it</p>
<p>and opened your life to him.</p>
<p>In this book,</p>
<p>homosexuality is a fact of your life and is a fact of life.</p>
<p>And over the years,</p>
<p>it becomes a fuller fact and a more open fact,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a scandal and it&rsquo;s not a story</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not something that polite people don&rsquo;t talk about.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to know how you thought</p>
<p>about pushing that theme, leading that theme,</p>
<p>being led by that theme throughout the whole book.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, could we just talk about Sticky Fingers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never have a book written about you called Sticky Fingers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good title.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a believer in chance and karma</p>
<p>and the right thing at the right time and place.</p>
<p>And I ran to this guy up in a little town I used to live in</p>
<p>and he was writing.</p>
<p>He introduced himself to me &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;d been writing for&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d done a profile role for Rolling Stone</p>
<p>and he wrote articles of Men&rsquo;s Journal,</p>
<p>and beyond that, he had interned.</p>
<p>He was a Wall Street Journal reporter</p>
<p>who had interned at Rolling Stone in the &rsquo;90s something,</p>
<p>anyway, 10 years before,</p>
<p>and had sat right outside my office</p>
<p>and when he met me he asked me questions about Ralph Gleason</p>
<p>and this guy&rsquo;s the guy, maybe this is the guy.</p>
<p>So I even checked with my own editors who worked with him,</p>
<p>they all liked him.</p>
<p>I went ahead and said, do you want to do this?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll open the da da da</p>
<p>and went ahead and got a big contract for it.</p>
<p>And we sat off</p>
<p>and there was something always off about it, you know?</p>
<p>And which gets to another one of the things</p>
<p>I learned in my life is that&hellip;</p>
<p>My sister talked to him on the phone,</p>
<p>she said, this guy&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing you could learn in life,</p>
<p>I think in business, in other places and everything,</p>
<p>is to trust your gut.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something inside of you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s saying that something doesn&rsquo;t feel right about this,</p>
<p>explore that emotion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably 99% true.</p>
<p>And if you get that feeling, oh this thing isn&rsquo;t right,</p>
<p>that you tried to make some decision or do something out of,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s ambition or jealousy</p>
<p>or because you want to appear better than somebody else</p>
<p>or sound, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>You try to do things for the right reason.</p>
<p>So anyway, I started to get this feeling in my gut,</p>
<p>but I kept playing thinking,</p>
<p>no, no, this&rsquo;ll be all right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying this and people call me and say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;he&rsquo;s asking so many questions</p>
<p>about when you knew you was gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it seemed to me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another thing you wanna start with here.</p>
<p>So he called me on one day.</p>
<p>He says, just let me double,</p>
<p>&ldquo;so in the &rsquo;80s,&rdquo; he says on the phone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;when Reagan was so popular,</p>
<p>you did a poll</p>
<p>and it showed that your readers liked Reagan more.</p>
<p>Now, did you endorse Reagan that year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I mean, have you ever read the magazine?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible we could have ever&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you read Hunter?</p>
<p>Do you think we could ever have endorsed Reagan?</p>
<p>How can you ask me such&hellip;</p>
<p>And I thought, you haven&rsquo;t gotten this at all, have you?</p>
<p>After a year and a half working at it.</p>
<p>So it just, anyway went south.</p>
<p>And why it went south?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve tried to figure out,</p>
<p>I mean, did he not like me?</p>
<p>You know, people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Is he jealous?</p>
<p>People are jealous.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s coming in kind of jealousy</p>
<p>and bitterness and maybe some&hellip;</p>
<p>Later I&rsquo;ll get to that.</p>
<p>I think that came down to two things.</p>
<p>I think one,</p>
<p>he really didn&rsquo;t like what the results of the &rsquo;60s were</p>
<p>and what we were about and what that generation meant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he believed in it,</p>
<p>I think he was too cynical.</p>
<p>And then he was also a journalist.</p>
<p>And then you get down to it,</p>
<p>a journalist is there&hellip; (laughs)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting in your territory.</p>
<p>A journalist is a person</p>
<p>who is generally looking for a story,</p>
<p>a scoop, something hot,</p>
<p>to uncover something, discover something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partially out of jealousy,</p>
<p>partially out of anger,</p>
<p>partially out of that&rsquo;s the mission of a journalist</p>
<p>to find the scoop, to discover the missing information.</p>
<p>So I mean, he wasn&rsquo;t a biographer,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t a novelist, that wasn&rsquo;t his mission.</p>
<p>His mission was to get dirt, to uncover stuff.</p>
<p>That is not a type of journalism</p>
<p>that Rolling Stones has ever practiced.</p>
<p>It is not that we haven&rsquo;t published or investigated people</p>
<p>trying to look for bad stuff like that,</p>
<p>but by and large we didn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>and won&rsquo;t do that and didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And we certainly didn&rsquo;t do it with artists</p>
<p>who were people who did not deserve that kind of thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not involved in public service or politics.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re people bringing light and beauty to you</p>
<p>and love and they&rsquo;re creative.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a kind of a grimy thing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t go out to ruin people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>You go out to investigate a story,</p>
<p>you wanna find out why Karen Silkwood was killed</p>
<p>and what happened there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to go reinvestigate her life</p>
<p>and find out how grim&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, so part of the Hagan thing,</p>
<p>I think, it was related to homosexuality</p>
<p>or something that made him really prurient,</p>
<p>be curious about all this stuff.</p>
<p>What can you do?</p>
<p>And when I came to write my book,</p>
<p>and not really write it in any way</p>
<p>in response to the Hagan&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>in fact, I never even really read all of Hagan&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>I just skimmed through it</p>
<p>to look for what I was gonna have to apologize for</p>
<p>to people.</p>
<p>And to see how bad it was, how cynical.</p>
<p>It was so cynical</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t credit Rolling Stone</p>
<p>with any of the good that it did</p>
<p>and the good intentions we had</p>
<p>because it was all like a marketing thing.</p>
<p>I decided not to pay attention,</p>
<p>not to deal with this book or try and refute it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even mention it in my book.</p>
<p>Like the drugs, you just really have to&hellip;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna tell a true story,</p>
<p>you have to tell a true story.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t write about drug use in the book</p>
<p>trying to describe it very much or get into the details.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that,</p>
<p>and likewise with homosexuality or sexuality in general,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really what&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of writing about the details of it?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not different than anybody else&rsquo;s experiences.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been written about a thousand times.</p>
<p>What was was important here was the issue of realizing,</p>
<p>making a realization of who you are</p>
<p>in this particular climate and culture</p>
<p>and this place where you&rsquo;re baby boomer,</p>
<p>the importance of exercising these freedoms</p>
<p>and finding these freedoms for people</p>
<p>and being able to discuss this openly.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve realized</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of people who read this</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll affect them and maybe empower them</p>
<p>to do things to themselves.</p>
<p>And it was a secondary feeling,</p>
<p>it was just part of the historical record.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of going on personal life too much</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t really discuss</p>
<p>this makes scenes of any more necessary in here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>We have to tell this story,</p>
<p>it has to be told.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great letter I got,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can find it.</p>
<p>Oh, not in here.</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I should try and see.</p>
<p>We got a letter from our reader once,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I couldn&rsquo;t even find it,</p>
<p>but saying like four or five years into it.</p>
<p>And I only just found the letter</p>
<p>when I was researching the book</p>
<p>and looking through old letters.</p>
<p>The reader was saying,</p>
<p>we admire all your coverage of music and pot laws</p>
<p>and on and on</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve never touched the issue of homosexuality.</p>
<p>And this is more important to me</p>
<p>than it is what are my rights of smoking dope.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you realize</p>
<p>that people in the certain parts of the country</p>
<p>can still get castrated for the&hellip;</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t really dawn on me at the time</p>
<p>until I saw at the end how right that individual was.</p>
<p>But anyway&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Geeta] We&rsquo;re gonna ask to open it up to questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Geeta] Come up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you have any more thoughts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could go for a long time, Jann, we already have.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean over the years, no end to it.</p>
<p>But people want to ask you questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Geeta] Hello, hello.</li>
</ul>
<p>So question time, I&rsquo;m Geeta Anand,</p>
<p>Dean of the School of Journalism</p>
<p>and we love journalists, so thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna ask the first question and then open it up</p>
<p>or would you like to ask the first question Michael?</p>
<p>Oh, how do we get&hellip;</p>
<p>I wanna make sure people can hear your question-</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, everybody hear me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I speaking loud enough?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Or should we rush microphone?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should stand up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can everybody hear me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A microphone is headed your way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope everyone can hear me now.</p>
<p>So we are at the Haas Business School</p>
<p>and you were running a business.</p>
<p>You spoke briefly</p>
<p>about the slim pickings you had to start with</p>
<p>and how you had to build,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve been through a lot of interesting times.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been through deep recessions, inflation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been through the disintermediation of magazines</p>
<p>and much of media by tech companies, et cetera.</p>
<p>Just thought if you had any reflections on that</p>
<p>that might be interesting</p>
<p>for both the journalism students here</p>
<p>but especially the business school students here.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;d appreciate it if you want to-</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I do.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t speak too much to the recessions.</p>
<p>We were luckily somewhat immune to them.</p>
<p>And our main business task in the first 15, 20 years</p>
<p>was learning how to be in business and how to manage growth.</p>
<p>Our growth was rapid.</p>
<p>We had no experience.</p>
<p>And when when you&rsquo;re managing growth</p>
<p>and going through that phase,</p>
<p>it seems like nothing you do is wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, anything that you did that was wrong</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t learn from, you just move on.</p>
<p>The next thing it gets covered up by the other successes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a somewhat easy thing.</p>
<p>It leads you obviously,</p>
<p>into making some pretty dumb moves and mistakes,</p>
<p>thinking you&rsquo;re better than you are,</p>
<p>and we did that.</p>
<p>And rapid expansion is a trap you have to watch</p>
<p>and can learn about.</p>
<p>But the most interesting thing that really turned around</p>
<p>and brought the end of the magazine business</p>
<p>is the internet.</p>
<p>And I begrudge the internet very deeply for doing that</p>
<p>and what it&rsquo;s done and what it&rsquo;s doing to society</p>
<p>these days.</p>
<p>I think that the internet really needs to be regulated</p>
<p>and regulated badly and soon if at all possible,</p>
<p>and brought under the laws of the United States.</p>
<p>The founders of this country</p>
<p>gave privilege and right to the free press</p>
<p>on the assumption that the press</p>
<p>would create an informed public, a properly informed public,</p>
<p>which would guide public policy</p>
<p>and be a guardrail of democracy.</p>
<p>And for that reason, newspapers, magazines,</p>
<p>responsible journalism has been extremely important</p>
<p>in the history of this country.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all kinds of places</p>
<p>and surely there&rsquo;s been accesses and so on over the years</p>
<p>and so on like that,</p>
<p>but the journalism institutions have made a big difference.</p>
<p>But what happened now</p>
<p>and the government has learned to regulate them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re regulated,</p>
<p>and I include the television networks in this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re regulated by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>And the First Amendment</p>
<p>as interpreted by the lawful Supreme Court,</p>
<p>forbids newspapers and magazines and television stations</p>
<p>and other public media</p>
<p>from acting with reckless disregard of the truth and fact</p>
<p>and malicious intent.</p>
<p>No such restriction applies to the internet.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>And yet they are the major avenue</p>
<p>of public discourse in the country.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s ever been an institution</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s been belongs to the people,</p>
<p>this institution is created by the Defense Department,</p>
<p>have research money of the United States government</p>
<p>that created the internet.</p>
<p>Not Silicone Valley, not the hedge fund guys,</p>
<p>not Steve Jobs, none of them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s created by government money.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>they were given every kind of tax break,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t pay taxes.</p>
<p>For years they didn&rsquo;t pay state taxes.</p>
<p>These companies have several trillion dollars</p>
<p>stuffed in tax free havens</p>
<p>and low tax countries and around the country</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t come back here.</p>
<p>And they are so virtually untaxed in so many cases.</p>
<p>And then on top of it,</p>
<p>rule 820 it&rsquo;s called or 420 or whatever, I forget,</p>
<p>exempts them from obeying the law.</p>
<p>They must be responsible for what they publish.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s gonna cost them an extra billion dollars a year</p>
<p>to enforce that and do what&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>But they can afford an extra fucking billion dollars a year</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause they have $50 billion a year.</p>
<p>But it is reckless, it&rsquo;s irresponsible</p>
<p>and destroying the public discourse</p>
<p>and is not necessary</p>
<p>and it should be brought back under rule of law.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking out into the audience for the next question-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May I just finish that question?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What the internet did with all those privileges</p>
<p>to my biggest business is they came in,</p>
<p>they stole our intellectual property,</p>
<p>our content that we paid highly for</p>
<p>to expensive writers like Greil and Annie</p>
<p>and so forth like that.</p>
<p>They put it on their thing free or made access to it free.</p>
<p>And then admittedly, the internet,</p>
<p>the digital thing is a better advertising medium.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree that they should be huge and popular</p>
<p>and diminish magazines in any way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fight technology</p>
<p>but they took away our income abruptly,</p>
<p>really quickly and without conscience like blood suckers.</p>
<p>And then they came in and fooled you as a magazine,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s my magazine or Time Inc. or the Time</p>
<p>and said, geez, let them,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ll put the content on us now,</p>
<p>like give it to us, we&rsquo;ll give you 10% of the revenues.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t actually get your people to sign up with us.</p>
<p>You have to subscribe to the Apple store.</p>
<p>Apple will take 30%&hellip;</p>
<p>And every trick in the book</p>
<p>until all of a sudden the publishers were bled dry.</p>
<p>I mean, really it was like a vampire dragon squid,</p>
<p>with all these tentacles that had iPhones at the end of it,</p>
<p>sucking us all dry.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>And so now I don&rsquo;t have the money</p>
<p>to pay for the quality journalism or quality photography</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s necessary for long form magazine journalism.</p>
<p>The money is going to all these hits that are so fast.</p>
<p>So where is the thought journalism?</p>
<p>Where is that kind of journalism</p>
<p>that is gonna tell us how to govern this country</p>
<p>and what our policies should be?</p>
<p>Sorry, thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>

<p>Next question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, my name is Joseph Arjo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a student at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you,</p>
<p>when you were a student here</p>
<p>and you were part of the Daily Californian,</p>
<p>did that inspire you to start the Rolling Stone</p>
<p>or was there some other catalyst that brought that to you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some other catalyst, but I enjoyed the Daily Californian.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was an anonymous staffer, I wrote a column every week.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go in, I wasn&rsquo;t part of the staff.</p>
<p>I wrote it under a pseudonym, Mr. Jones,</p>
<p>after the Stilton song, battle of the thin man.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s happen here, you know what it is?</p>
<p>Do you, Mr&hellip;</p>
<p>And I wrote it, as I mentioned, Ralph Gleason earlier,</p>
<p>who lived here in Berkeley</p>
<p>and was with Chronicle of San Francisco.</p>
<p>And he used to write this column three times a week</p>
<p>and once on Sunday in the pink section</p>
<p>about what was going on in rock and roll or on the campus</p>
<p>or poetry or something like that.</p>
<p>And it was kind of an imitation of&hellip;</p>
<p>Not really imitating him,</p>
<p>so I would just write a comment</p>
<p>of my experiences over the weekend,</p>
<p>taking drugs and going to the Fillmore Auditorium</p>
<p>and sitting grateful there with my friends.</p>
<p>And that was about that.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>The direct inspirations</p>
<p>were working at Sunday Rampart,</p>
<p>the influence of Rampart</p>
<p>and the reading English music magazines,</p>
<p>the Melody Maker and Music Express</p>
<p>and a great influence in San Francisco Chronicle</p>
<p>for just quirky bullshit.</p>
<p>I mean, every weird story there was,</p>
<p>the Chronicle wouldn&rsquo;t run it.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>I remember once there was an LSD bust</p>
<p>in 1965 or something like that,</p>
<p>and that was a front page headline.</p>
<p>Central &ldquo;Mr. Big busted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had some money in that deal by the way,</p>
<p>but the idea that a major city newspaper</p>
<p>which has a page one headline across banner headline</p>
<p>about the address of an LSD dealer, I liked that.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Geeta] Yes, a question back there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Don Gammon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d never thought about this before tonight</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know that the timeline maps perfectly,</p>
<p>but it occurred to me that the rise of Rolling Stone</p>
<p>somewhat coincided or overlapped with Playboy.</p>
<p>My question to you is,</p>
<p>did you have a relationship with Hugh Hefner?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big free speech theme,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big overlap in influence to the culture.</p>
<p>Did you ever have a moment where you sat in a room</p>
<p>and laid out the future of the culture</p>
<p>and figured out who was tackling what?</p>
<p>And I would be curious to hear.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Hef, you do sex, I&rsquo;ll do music.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Hef says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make all the money,&rdquo; and he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the Mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Playboy predated Rolling Stone,</p>
<p>substantially predated Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>But when I started Rolling Stone,</p>
<p>Playboy was one of those magazines that everybody read then.</p>
<p>And it was one that had a great deal of influence</p>
<p>on Rolling Stone indirectly</p>
<p>because it was liberal, crusading.</p>
<p>It was clearly a really fine piece of magazine craft.</p>
<p>I know people remember Playboy then,</p>
<p>but it was thick like this.</p>
<p>And also had different papers and cutouts and artists</p>
<p>and ran major writers on stuff.</p>
<p>And it had one particular feature, the Playboy interview,</p>
<p>which was so much better than any other profile interview</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get in any other magazine in the United States</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause they went and spent a lot of time</p>
<p>in a one on one conversation with the artist or the writer</p>
<p>or the politician that they were trying&hellip;</p>
<p>It was the only in-depth interview</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d ever see anywhere with anybody.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t run professors</p>
<p>and we adapted that feature out of him.</p>
<p>Many years later, I ran to Hef a couple of times.</p>
<p>Once he sat in front of me</p>
<p>at the Ali-Frazier fight at the Garden.</p>
<p>That was kind of cool.</p>
<p>And Bob Dylan was there too.</p>
<p>And then later in later years, I did finally meet him.</p>
<p>I met Christie Hefner, his daughter,</p>
<p>about 10 or 20 years ago,</p>
<p>and she had taken over Playboy that time</p>
<p>and was having a really struggling time with circulations.</p>
<p>By then, it was obviously a diminishing thing.</p>
<p>She wanted me to take it over in partnership with her.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I mean, but your old man,</p>
<p>Hef is having a great time.</p>
<p>I said, well, meet him.</p>
<p>So I went out and had lunch with him at the Playboy mansion,</p>
<p>which was fantastic.</p>
<p>We spent the afternoon together and had a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a grand old man to my whatever I was then.</p>
<p>And somebody deserving an enormous respect.</p>
<p>And well, we shall all be grateful to him.</p>
<p>And I mean, he played this great part</p>
<p>in the liberation of the &rsquo;60s and the country.</p>
<p>Anyway, after all this time&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, so we met and chatted.</p>
<p>When I went back, I met Christie,</p>
<p>she says, well, Hef has&hellip;</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;re not gonna change this thing unless Hef goes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all his stuff &lsquo;cause you just have to monitor.</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;well, would you tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;m on his side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna go.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Geeta] Next question back there,</li>
</ul>
<p>and this will be our last question.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, no pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Laura.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a student at the journalism school.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jann] Ah okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If &ldquo;Like a Rolling Stone&rdquo; and the Free Speech Movement</p>
<p>helped to define your life then,</p>
<p>what song and movement helped define your life now?</p>
<ul>
<li>Good question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>On that note, in terms of songs before movements,</p>
<p>I think, like everybody, I&rsquo;m most partial to the music</p>
<p>that I heard when I was growing up,</p>
<p>when I was young in my 20s, maybe into my 30s.</p>
<p>But before you start getting professional,</p>
<p>starting a family and all these things</p>
<p>that start to take priority over music.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m most partial to that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of music I go to most.</p>
<p>Still, you listen to Bob Dylan</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still a revelation,</p>
<p>his voice, his lyrics, who he was at the time, his attitude.</p>
<p>I mean to win the Nobel Prize for literature</p>
<p>was beyond justifiable and long overdue.</p>
<p>And in it, interestingly, I found when he won the Nobel,</p>
<p>they not only cited his writing,</p>
<p>but they also cited the form</p>
<p>in which he was writing rock and roll music,</p>
<p>rock and roll song.</p>
<p>They cited that particular thing as a validation of poetry</p>
<p>to say that this is also an award for rock and roll music.</p>
<p>But today, there are certain things that inspire me.</p>
<p>I mean, I look at what Bob is doing,</p>
<p>I look at the same people still.</p>
<p>Then I take a lot out and get a lot out of YouTube</p>
<p>and particularly out of Bruce Springsteen</p>
<p>and Bob still with the new albums</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause Bob is dealing with contemporary problems</p>
<p>that we all have.</p>
<p>For us, our age, dying, getting older,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s becoming of the world, this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So he is still engaged with that</p>
<p>which makes him sort of compelling.</p>
<p>Bruce and U2 are so engaged still</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s going on around them today</p>
<p>and writing about these things and these themes.</p>
<p>And Bruce particularly again,</p>
<p>about aging and certain internal truths.</p>
<p>And that still speaks to me so much,</p>
<p>but all this beautiful music does.</p>
<p>The thing I like the most lately in contemporary music</p>
<p>is Bruce did a record</p>
<p>in which he covered a bunch of &rsquo;70s, &rsquo;80s soul classics.</p>
<p>Things like the Gamble and the Huff tunes,</p>
<p>things like Hey, Western Union Man, Only the Strong Survive,</p>
<p>some Motown stuff, 7 Rooms Of Gloom.</p>
<p>And it is brilliant.</p>
<p>I mean, he sings this stuff so well.</p>
<p>The arrangements are the same,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all brought up and they&rsquo;re (indistinct)</p>
<p>larger and broader and bigger sound.</p>
<p>And it is so much fun.</p>
<p>And I take out of that</p>
<p>the idea still that rock and roll is so liberating still</p>
<p>and so great to hear and so much fun to hear</p>
<p>and so full of energy that it just lives forever</p>
<p>and that inspires the hell out of me.</p>
<p>And so what currently gets me,</p>
<p>politically is when I think about it,</p>
<p>I think about most is the energy crisis, climate crisis.</p>
<p>Obviously, fun following politics.</p>
<p>Without belaboring,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in a pretty good position now.</p>
<p>I think Biden&rsquo;s gonna turn out to be a great president.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re moving forward.</p>
<p>I believe that my heart, my soul, that there&rsquo;s no doom.</p>
<p>And the political situation in America,</p>
<p>history goes in cycles</p>
<p>and it all comes back and goes around again.</p>
<p>And everything we&rsquo;ve seen with Trump and all those people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen it before in different stages.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had the McCarthy era,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had the Palmer era in the &rsquo;20s,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had the Ku Klux Klan</p>
<p>and Father Coughlin, all this stuff.</p>
<p>And that comes around</p>
<p>and then we become very liberal and international</p>
<p>and it depends what side of that cycle we&rsquo;re on right now.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re on the right side of cycle.</p>
<p>I think things have come together in such a way</p>
<p>that the public really strongly feels convinced</p>
<p>about a certain set of things that must happen.</p>
<p>And some people see there&rsquo;s an opportunity ahead of us</p>
<p>to have a really better world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s dangers in the political system,</p>
<p>frustrating that, but I think they can overcome them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Going back to taking LSD,</p>
<p>will we come around to a point</p>
<p>where we can triumph over greed</p>
<p>that is represented by the people who own oil,</p>
<p>own all these companies, the greed of individuals,</p>
<p>the greed of billionaires</p>
<p>who are taking all this private capital.</p>
<p>All this capital is being taken out of society</p>
<p>and stuffed away in bank accounts and yachts.</p>
<p>And the most useless form of wealth there is in the world</p>
<p>is private wealth stuffed away,</p>
<p>when we need this money</p>
<p>to redo the energy system in the world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll go with them saying it&rsquo;s gonna take about</p>
<p>four and a half trillion dollars a year for next 20 years.</p>
<p>That money is out there.</p>
<p>You could get that out of any number of oligarchs, sheikhs,</p>
<p>venture capitalists, bankers&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s there, we need it.</p>
<p>And unless we can take that money,</p>
<p>we will not make it in our current form.</p>
<p>Yeah, there will only be like 600 million of us left,</p>
<p>most of us at the North Pole, some at the South Pole.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Geeta] Well, I see why you love &ldquo;Like A Rolling Stone&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>and that life is cyclical and the world is cyclical.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s end on a hopeful note.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs) (audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Geeta] Thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience applause continues)</p>
<p>I wanna make sure you all know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reception afterwards.</p>
<p>Please join us.</p>
<p>I wanna thank again Michael and Chris Boskin</p>
<p>for your incredible generosity.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>And Jann and Greil, for this very real conversation</p>
<p>that makes me grateful</p>
<p>that we had Michael polling at the Journalism School</p>
<p>and the center for psychedelics</p>
<p>lies at the journalism school.</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
