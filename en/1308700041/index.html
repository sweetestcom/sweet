    <p>Our card this week is Dana Ram, the Jack of Hearts from California.</p>
<p>Just shy of New Year&rsquo;s Eve in 1986, 20-year-old Dana Ram vanished from a gas station parking</p>
<p>lot in a small California town.</p>
<p>When her body was found the morning after she disappeared, her friends and family were</p>
<p>heartbroken, but they helped police piece together the last moments of Dana&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Without any tips generated for decades, police are now turning to the public for help identifying</p>
<p>a biker who might be the missing piece in one of California&rsquo;s coldest cases.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On Monday, December 29th, 1986, a woman was driving to work on a country road near Senoal,</p>
<p>California, when she spotted something on the shoulder of the road.</p>
<p>At first, she couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was because it was early, like 7.30, and it was</p>
<p>one of those foggy, Bay Area mornings, on top of the fact that it was the week between</p>
<p>Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s when you just can&rsquo;t fathom getting out of bed and dragging yourself</p>
<p>to work.</p>
<p>But as she slowed to peer out her window and get a better look, it came into focus.</p>
<p>It was a woman lying naked and motionless on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Out racing, practically beating out of her body, she sped up and continued down the road</p>
<p>until she spotted a public works crew doing some road maintenance.</p>
<p>She stopped, told them what she&rsquo;d seen, and led the crew back to the woman.</p>
<p>Without getting too close to what they quickly realized was a crime scene, they could tell</p>
<p>that the woman was dead.</p>
<p>As they were about to leave to find a phone and call 911, a California Department of Forestry</p>
<p>and Fire Protection officer also rolled up.</p>
<p>They radioed for emergency crews to respond right away, and a fire engineer cordoned off</p>
<p>the road a couple hundred feet in both directions to stop any cars that tried to pass.</p>
<p>Just as an ambulance pulled up, investigators from the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>arrived and took over the scene.</p>
<p>Medics and investigators could tell that the woman was young, but they couldn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>how she&rsquo;d died or even how she&rsquo;d gotten there.</p>
<p>She was laying face up, her pale skin, reddish blonde hair, and blue eyes, a harsh contrast</p>
<p>to the dirt and gravel off the side of the paved road.</p>
<p>She had a little blood coming from her nose and mouth, some bruising on her neck, and</p>
<p>scrapes on her knees and elbows, or at least her right elbow, because that&rsquo;s all they</p>
<p>could see.</p>
<p>Her left arm was awkwardly trapped under her body, and her knees were bent.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t any items left near her body, and her clothes were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>But there were a few things left on her body.</p>
<p>She had some rings on her right hand and a necklace with a cannabis leaf pendant around</p>
<p>her neck.</p>
<p>The coroner&rsquo;s bureau didn&rsquo;t get there until after 10.30 a.m., but once they arrived on</p>
<p>scene, they recovered the woman&rsquo;s body and took her away for an autopsy.</p>
<p>While they hoped the exam would offer some clarity to this growing mystery, the question</p>
<p>they wanted answered most was who was she?</p>
<p>After she was taken away, detectives hung back and combed the area.</p>
<p>They found some alcohol bottles and a leather glove, but they were several feet down the</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>And we learned from our interview with Detective Patrick Smith at the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office that this area was notorious as a teenage hangout spot, a roadside shoulder where local</p>
<p>high schoolers pulled over and partied on Friday nights.</p>
<p>So detectives figured the items could just be litter from teens, but they collected them</p>
<p>just in case.</p>
<p>As soon as law enforcement processed the scene, investigators and Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Patrol</p>
<p>units started canvassing, but there weren&rsquo;t exactly houses nearby, or they could go door-knocking.</p>
<p>The area even today is pretty bare.</p>
<p>Detective Smith took our reporting team to the exact spot where she was found, and you</p>
<p>can see a picture of it along with a map of the area on our blog post for this episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t any houses or businesses around, just flatlands with grazing cattle flanking</p>
<p>the road on either side.</p>
<p>So police started looking for witnesses a few miles north, closer to the highway where</p>
<p>there was at least a gas station.</p>
<p>But no one at the gas station up the road had any helpful information.</p>
<p>One patrol unit paid a visit to the woman who had spotted the body on her way to work</p>
<p>that morning.</p>
<p>I mean, poor thing was so shaken up that she just turned around and went home instead of</p>
<p>continuing on to work.</p>
<p>But she didn&rsquo;t have much else to offer.</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Office checked to see if they had any similar missing persons reports on</p>
<p>file, but they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office sent out a bulletin describing the woman to other police agencies</p>
<p>in the East Bay, just in case any of their missing people matched her description.</p>
<p>Not long after they put that bulletin out, at about 7 p.m. or so, the Alameda County</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s Office got a phone call from a neighboring police department.</p>
<p>Law enforcement in the nearby city of Pleasanton had just received a missing persons report</p>
<p>for a 20-something young woman named Dana, pale, reddish-blonde hair, and blue eyes.</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Office was told that her two friends, Cody and Tracy, had been searching</p>
<p>for her since the wee hours of that morning.</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t seem like a coincidence, so Cody and Tracy were told to go to the Alameda</p>
<p>County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and to bring a picture of Dana.</p>
<p>As soon as they got there with the picture and a little more info on Dana, deputies ran</p>
<p>her name and date of birth in their database, and they saw Dana&rsquo;s fingerprints, which</p>
<p>police had on file from a misdemeanor drug arrest earlier that year.</p>
<p>And sure enough, it was her, 20-year-old Dana Ram.</p>
<p>Detectives had Cody and Tracy stick around for questioning, while other deputies drove</p>
<p>to nearby Livermore, 20 minutes northeast of Sunol, to notify Dana&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Dana&rsquo;s sister, Carla, told our reporting team that she will never forget that night.</p>
<p>I just had gotten my consoles out, and then my mom and I were just watching TV, and there</p>
<p>was a knock on the door at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and no one comes to the house at ten</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock at night.</p>
<p>And the cops told my mom and dad, and yeah, you can&rsquo;t get the screams out of your head.</p>
<p>The Ram family was stunned.</p>
<p>Like the way you would think about someone who has just been struck by lightning.</p>
<p>In a single instant, their entire world changed.</p>
<p>And all at once, it was too hard to breathe, hard to stand, and even hard to think straight.</p>
<p>How could it happen that fast?</p>
<p>This has to be some kind of mistake.</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t talked to her in a while, but it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for them to go a few days,</p>
<p>even weeks, without hearing from Dana.</p>
<p>So no one even knew to be worried about her.</p>
<p>Dana&rsquo;s mom said that the last time she&rsquo;d spoken to her daughter was just over a month</p>
<p>ago.</p>
<p>Right after Thanksgiving, she&rsquo;d reached out to Dana after reading in the local paper that</p>
<p>Dana was involved in a bizarre incident.</p>
<p>Apparently, Dana had gotten in a fight with her friend Tracy&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>Now, the fight was pretty convoluted and honestly not even worth getting into, but basically,</p>
<p>Tracy and her sister got into an argument over something, and their boyfriends both</p>
<p>got involved.</p>
<p>Dana ended up chiming in at some point, and then Tracy&rsquo;s sister and Dana started physically</p>
<p>fighting each other.</p>
<p>And the sister ended up biting off the tip of Dana&rsquo;s left ring finger, which is like,</p>
<p>whoa.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I get why Dana&rsquo;s mom was worried about her after reading that in the newspaper.</p>
<p>But she got ahold of Dana, and Dana was like, I&rsquo;m fine, Mom.</p>
<p>And Mom believed her, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Now, even though this was weird and maybe, you know, interesting to police as a potential</p>
<p>lead, unfortunately, none of Dana&rsquo;s family had any more helpful information to give investigators.</p>
<p>It would be up to them to piece together this puzzle.</p>
<p>Dana&rsquo;s autopsy was done the next day, and not like there was any doubt that it was her,</p>
<p>but the coroner confirmed that she was, in fact, missing a fingertip.</p>
<p>The autopsy results indicated that Dana died by asphyxiation from manual strangulation,</p>
<p>and the examiner noted other scrapes on her body.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Smith.</p>
<p>You look at the evidence that, you know, she did have some, you know, bruising on her wrist.</p>
<p>She had some abrasions on her elbows and knees, but there wasn&rsquo;t a massive amount of evidence</p>
<p>to suggest that there was a prolonged altercation of any kind.</p>
<p>In Dana&rsquo;s case, the autopsy report didn&rsquo;t indicate any trauma from sexual assault, but</p>
<p>there was semen present, though what they were really hoping for in 1986 were hairs</p>
<p>or fibers, which they could actually use to match to a suspect, but they didn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>any of those.</p>
<p>When detectives started doing interviews to find out exactly what happened to Dana, detectives</p>
<p>first focused on Tracy and Cody, the friends who reported her missing.</p>
<p>At this point, police weren&rsquo;t even sure who these people were to Dana, so they needed</p>
<p>to do some background work.</p>
<p>Police started with Tracy, who told them that she and Dana had been friends for eight years.</p>
<p>The more Tracy talked, the more detectives got a sense for the free spirit that Dana was.</p>
<p>The East Bay Times called her a quote-unquote flower child living in the 80s, and her sister</p>
<p>Carla told us that Dana was airy, never stressed.</p>
<p>She was a young, bright woman with a future ahead of her.</p>
<p>She was clever, she loved children, and she loved riding her father&rsquo;s motorcycle.</p>
<p>Police learned from Tracy that Dana did what most young adults dream of doing.</p>
<p>After graduating high school in June of 85, a year and a half before she was killed, Dana</p>
<p>hit the road to do some soul-searching.</p>
<p>Carla told us that Livermore was kind of a cowboy town, and her sister yearned for something</p>
<p>different.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s at a place in Livermore, if she just traveled 30 minutes up the road to Berkeley,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d fit in.</p>
<p>She was very hippie-ish, very la-la-la, free love.</p>
<p>After working any odd job that she could find and spending time with a boyfriend in</p>
<p>South Lake Tahoe, which is about three and a half hours northeast of East Bay, Dana returned</p>
<p>to the Bay Area in November.</p>
<p>Tracy told police that the two of them only started hanging around Cody a few months ago,</p>
<p>and during that time, Dana went between living in a hotel room in the East Bay and kind of</p>
<p>van-lifing with Cody and Tracy in her rusted blue Ford 1966 van.</p>
<p>Sometime around Christmas, the trio left their motel room and went on a road trip, initially</p>
<p>driving with Cody to his family&rsquo;s house and then sleeping in Dana&rsquo;s van in some</p>
<p>East Bay parking lots for a few nights after the holiday.</p>
<p>Tracy said that the last day they saw Dana, December 28th, nothing particularly eventful</p>
<p>happened.</p>
<p>That morning, Dana told Tracy and Cody that she needed a break from the van and that she</p>
<p>was going to go hang out with someone over at a nearby racquetball club.</p>
<p>She asked Tracy and Cody to meet her there a few hours later, and they agreed to swing</p>
<p>by at like 4 or 4.30 p.m., but Tracy said that Dana didn&rsquo;t stick to their plan.</p>
<p>Instead, she went over to her on-again, off-again boyfriend John&rsquo;s home in Livermore.</p>
<p>Tracy knew this because when she and Cody drove by the racquetball club that afternoon</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t see Dana&rsquo;s van parked out front, they assumed that she was at John&rsquo;s, and</p>
<p>so they drove by his place to check, and just as they expected, Dana&rsquo;s van was there.</p>
<p>The two left a note on her windshield telling Dana to meet them at a nearby park.</p>
<p>Tracy told police that she and Cody waited for Dana in the park, and they waited, but</p>
<p>by the time it got dark outside, they were really starting to wonder where she was.</p>
<p>So they drove back toward John&rsquo;s house, and they practically bumped into Dana.</p>
<p>They were both driving down the same street.</p>
<p>They followed each other downtown to get a bite to eat, Dana in her Ford van and the</p>
<p>duo in Tracy&rsquo;s Oldsmobile.</p>
<p>They all ate dinner at Carl&rsquo;s Jr. and then drove separately for a few miles and then</p>
<p>found a spot where Dana parked her van, and they all hopped into Tracy&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>The three of them just kind of cruised around, stopping by friends&rsquo; houses to see if anyone</p>
<p>wanted to hang out.</p>
<p>By 11 p.m., Tracy&rsquo;s car was nearly out of gas, so they pulled into a gas station in</p>
<p>Pleasanton just as the tank hit empty.</p>
<p>So Tracy and Cody hopped out and pushed it the rest of the way to the pump.</p>
<p>Problem though, the gas station was closing, so the pumps were turned off.</p>
<p>The group needed to figure out their next move, fast.</p>
<p>So Tracy said that by 11.20, she and Cody started the two-mile trek to where Dana parked</p>
<p>her van, while Dana stayed in the gas station parking lot in the Oldsmobile.</p>
<p>Tracy told investigators that Dana gave them the van&rsquo;s keys and said that she left her</p>
<p>purse in the van, which also had some money in it that she&rsquo;d gotten from John earlier,</p>
<p>totaling a bit less than 20 bucks.</p>
<p>Once at Dana&rsquo;s van, their plan was to drive it back to the gas station, sleep in it, and</p>
<p>then use the cash the next morning when the pumps reopened.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s exactly what they did.</p>
<p>Now since the gas station was exactly two miles from where Dana&rsquo;s van was parked, it</p>
<p>would take the average person around 40 minutes to walk there, and like five minutes to drive</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>To investigators, this would put them back at the gas station with Dana a little after</p>
<p>midnight.</p>
<p>When they got back though, Tracy told detectives that her car was still there, but Dana wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So immediately Tracy&rsquo;s worried that, you know, Dana&rsquo;s gone, they had no way to get a hold</p>
<p>of her.</p>
<p>You know, they thought, well, maybe she&rsquo;s gone, she&rsquo;ll come back soon.</p>
<p>They waited there in the parking lot there between the Safeway and the Chevron gas station.</p>
<p>She did not return.</p>
<p>Tracy knew Dana well.</p>
<p>Dana didn&rsquo;t always play by the rules, sure, but Tracy knew that she would have left a</p>
<p>note saying where she&rsquo;d gone.</p>
<p>This was pre-cell phone, so the group often communicated with windshield notes.</p>
<p>Tracy said that Cody tried to calm her down because she was already spiraling as they</p>
<p>looked across the parking lot and found no sign of her.</p>
<p>Tracy said they pushed her car off the pumps and into a parking spot, and they just stayed</p>
<p>awake until like three in the morning, sitting in the parking lot, hoping that Dana would</p>
<p>appear.</p>
<p>And this would all be some big misunderstanding, but Dana never showed up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely she got in someone&rsquo;s vehicle, whether that was willingly or unwillingly.</p>
<p>I do think that given the time of what she was wearing, knowing that her friends were</p>
<p>coming back, you don&rsquo;t have cell phones in those days.</p>
<p>So is it possible she could have went to a nearby pay phone and called somebody?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Whether she did that or whether someone just pulled up and saw her there, you know, I do</p>
<p>believe she got into a car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of was that willingly or unwillingly?</p>
<p>Tracy said that she and Cody eventually fell asleep in Dana&rsquo;s van and woke up at around</p>
<p>9 a.m. with pits in their stomachs when they realized that Dana still hadn&rsquo;t turned up.</p>
<p>They took the money from Dana&rsquo;s purse and put some gas in Tracy&rsquo;s car and started canvassing</p>
<p>the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Cody and Tracy didn&rsquo;t want to drive Dana&rsquo;s van because it had expired registration tags,</p>
<p>so Tracy said that they just left it parked at the gas station.</p>
<p>Through the late morning and early afternoon on December 29th, Tracy said that she and</p>
<p>Cody drove from friend&rsquo;s house to friend&rsquo;s house to see if anybody had heard from Dana.</p>
<p>They stopped at the liquor store where John worked, but he told them that he hadn&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>Dana since she left his place at around 5 p.m. the day before.</p>
<p>And all of their friends in Livermore had no more information than the next person.</p>
<p>But then what Tracy said they did next had me scratching my head a little.</p>
<p>They drove to the mall.</p>
<p>They walked around and Tracy said she tried on some makeup, but like, why are you testing</p>
<p>makeup while your friend is MIA?</p>
<p>Detectives didn&rsquo;t love this either, but they wanted Tracy to keep talking, so they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dwell on it.</p>
<p>Tracy said that after the mall, she and Cody went back to the gas station parking lot one</p>
<p>last time just to grab a radio and a blanket from Dana&rsquo;s van.</p>
<p>They briefly hung out at a nearby park, again, no real sense of urgency to find their friend</p>
<p>here, but they made one last stop at a friend&rsquo;s house who suggested that they report Dana</p>
<p>missing, finally.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when Tracy and Cody drove to a motel and used a phone booth to call in and report</p>
<p>Dana missing.</p>
<p>Police felt like they had a good sense of Dana&rsquo;s last movements after interviewing</p>
<p>Tracy.</p>
<p>So now they wanted to go talk to Cody to see how his recollections stacked up against Tracy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In his interview with police, Cody said that he&rsquo;d met Dana and Tracy through this 24-year-old</p>
<p>guy named Dennis, who Tracy was actually dating.</p>
<p>You see, when Cody moved to Livermore like a month prior, he&rsquo;d moved into the same</p>
<p>hotel as Dennis, and Dennis hooked Cody up with a job as a carpenter&rsquo;s helper.</p>
<p>Tracy and Dennis broke up soon after Cody came to town, but she and Dana still hung</p>
<p>out with Cody.</p>
<p>In fact, at some point, Dana had a little fling with Cody, but she ended that and also</p>
<p>broke things off with a previous boyfriend to see where things might go with that John</p>
<p>guy in Livermore.</p>
<p>The mention of a romantic relationship with their victim made deputies perk up.</p>
<p>But Cody said that he and Dana were just like casual hookup buddies, and they never actually</p>
<p>like dated dated.</p>
<p>He said it was totally cool with him if she wanted to see other people, so that was that.</p>
<p>All Cody&rsquo;s answers and timeline matched with Tracy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He said that the last time they saw Dana, she was sitting alone in the car.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually a thought that pains Dana&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>She was just a young woman.</p>
<p>She had a dress on.</p>
<p>It was recorded the coldest night in history, and she&rsquo;s freezing, sitting in a car in a</p>
<p>gas station all by herself.</p>
<p>And the doors didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The locks didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So she couldn&rsquo;t even lock herself in or put the heater on.</p>
<p>After talking to Tracy and Cody, police swiftly combed Dana&rsquo;s van and Tracy&rsquo;s car for any</p>
<p>clues that could lead them to the killer.</p>
<p>Investigators actually did find a few interesting things in Tracy&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Some articles of clothing and other items were spotted with mysterious stains.</p>
<p>But when the items were tested, they realized the stains weren&rsquo;t blood.</p>
<p>So if the physical evidence was a bust, then they were going to have to get info from witnesses,</p>
<p>starting with the gas station clerk who&rsquo;d actually seen Dana and her friends the night</p>
<p>she vanished.</p>
<p>The clerk told police that he actually remembered seeing Dana walk into the store and go to</p>
<p>the bathroom just as he was closing up shop on Sunday night.</p>
<p>After Dana went back outside to the car, the clerk remembered seeing her talk with two</p>
<p>other people, presumably Tracy and Cody.</p>
<p>The Chevron attendant told police that he saw Tracy and Cody start walking north toward</p>
<p>the interstate while Dana stayed at the car, which was still parked next to the gas pumps.</p>
<p>The clerk told police that he closed up shop for the night and Dana was still sitting there</p>
<p>when he left, but she wasn&rsquo;t the only one.</p>
<p>According to him, around the same time that Dana and her friends were at the gas station</p>
<p>that night, there was another car there too.</p>
<p>It was a Toyota Coupe, and the gas station attendant just so happened to know the guy</p>
<p>who was driving it, but he couldn&rsquo;t say for sure that the other car was still there</p>
<p>when he left for the night.</p>
<p>Detectives tracked the guy down, the one that was driving the Coupe, as well as the other</p>
<p>people who were reportedly in the car with him that night, and they all remembered seeing</p>
<p>Dana, Cody, and Tracy, but the groups didn&rsquo;t say much to each other and they didn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>anything weird or suspicious, so they actually weren&rsquo;t much help at all.</p>
<p>Detectives wasted no time in moving on talking to the other guy Tracy had mentioned during</p>
<p>her interview, John, the guy whose house Tracy said she saw Dana&rsquo;s van at on the 28th.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office sent a patrol unit to John&rsquo;s house to see if he would come into</p>
<p>the station for an interview, and he did.</p>
<p>John was forthcoming with police.</p>
<p>He said that he met Dana through a mutual friend on a softball team, and according to</p>
<p>John, his relationship with her was casual and functioned when it was convenient for</p>
<p>them, like they would hook up when Dana was around but didn&rsquo;t talk all that much when</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t in the East Bay.</p>
<p>John told investigators that Dana cut things off with him the year before when she was</p>
<p>dating someone else, but because they were both newly single, the two recently rekindled</p>
<p>their romance.</p>
<p>After seeing each other in early December, they had planned to meet up again after the</p>
<p>holidays, and they ended up getting together on the 28th, Dana&rsquo;s last day alive.</p>
<p>Just as Tracy had suspected, John confirmed that Dana did drive to his house in her blue</p>
<p>van.</p>
<p>He said that they hung out with some other friends and watched the 49ers Rams game.</p>
<p>Now, my research says that the Rams played Washington on December 28th, 1986, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Later in the day, though, he said that he and Dana had sex.</p>
<p>John told police that Dana left his house at around five that afternoon, and before</p>
<p>she left, she asked to borrow five bucks.</p>
<p>John knew that Dana didn&rsquo;t have a ton of money saved up, so he took Dana to the bank,</p>
<p>withdrew 20 from his account, and gave it to her.</p>
<p>The two then drove back to John&rsquo;s place, and Dana took off in her van.</p>
<p>John was also able to give detectives a detailed description of exactly what Dana was wearing</p>
<p>that day, a digital watch, a plaid skirt, and matching brown blouse.</p>
<p>She was also wearing a necklace with a cannabis leaf charm, and calf-length heeled tan boots.</p>
<p>After Dana left, John said he had a relatively average night on the town.</p>
<p>He went to a local saloon, which he left at around 10 p.m., and then he stopped by a restaurant</p>
<p>for an hour or so and finished his night at a club in Pleasanton.</p>
<p>John drove back home from the club just before midnight because he said that he wanted to</p>
<p>go to bed at a reasonable hour.</p>
<p>Dana Smith said John reacted just as anyone would react to finding out that a close friend</p>
<p>had died.</p>
<p>They had him take a polygraph, and he passed.</p>
<p>Now while the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office were conducting all of these interviews, there</p>
<p>was just one person they still really wanted to know more about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Dana&rsquo;s last boyfriend, Stuart, who Tracy said Dana lived with in South Lake</p>
<p>Tahoe.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Police weren&rsquo;t sure if he was still alive.</p>
<p>You see, after she and Stuart broke up, Dana returned to the East Bay and told her friends</p>
<p>that Stuart had died by suicide.</p>
<p>But a few days after Dana&rsquo;s body was found, on January 2nd, 1987, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>got a call that stopped them in their tracks.</p>
<p>It was Stuart.</p>
<p>And he was like, I heard you&rsquo;ve been looking for me.</p>
<p>Stuart agreed to meet police at the station that same day.</p>
<p>When he sat down for his interview, investigators&rsquo; first question was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Why did Dana tell everyone you&rsquo;re dead?</p>
<p>He explained it like their relationship was like a Romeo and Juliet relationship.</p>
<p>And after they broke up, she just started spreading the rumor that he had died.</p>
<p>Detectives pressed him on their relationship, and Stuart told investigators that he and</p>
<p>Dana had known each other for three years.</p>
<p>He said Dana broke up with him when she left South Lake Tahoe for the East Bay in November.</p>
<p>She just told him that she needed space.</p>
<p>Up to that point, Stuart said that he and Dana were living together in South Lake Tahoe</p>
<p>out of their van.</p>
<p>Investigators obviously wanted to know Stuart&rsquo;s whereabouts during the time Dana was murdered,</p>
<p>and he told them that he was actually in Oregon when Dana was killed, which ended up being</p>
<p>true.</p>
<p>Stuart&rsquo;s employer in Oregon told detectives that he was at work until 9 p.m. on December</p>
<p>28th, and he showed up to work the next day too.</p>
<p>So with a solid alibi, police had no reason to hold Stuart.</p>
<p>They moved on, interviewing anyone and everyone in Dana&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>So the next person they turned to was a guy that you might remember from earlier.</p>
<p>The one who helped Cody land that job in Livermore, Dennis.</p>
<p>And Dennis was already known to police because on Christmas Day, they were called to a home</p>
<p>for a strange incident involving him.</p>
<p>The Pleasanton Police Department responded to an address, a residence in Pleasanton,</p>
<p>where someone was reportedly threatening two subjects with a handgun, and the two subjects</p>
<p>were Cody and Tracy.</p>
<p>If you remember from earlier, Dennis and Tracy had just broken up, which created some</p>
<p>tension between everyone.</p>
<p>And adding to that tension was the fact that Dennis&rsquo; car had been stolen around Christmas,</p>
<p>and he heard that Tracy might have stolen it, so he was fuming.</p>
<p>Dennis accused Cody, Tracy, and Dana of stealing not only his car, but also some personal belongings</p>
<p>from his room when all four of them were living at the motel.</p>
<p>When Dennis&rsquo; father heard about his son&rsquo;s suspicions, he took things too far.</p>
<p>Just before 7pm on Christmas Day, Dennis and his father went to Tracy&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; home</p>
<p>in Pleasanton.</p>
<p>And when he got there, Dennis&rsquo; dad pulled a revolver on Tracy and Cody.</p>
<p>He yelled at them and told them they were under some sort of citizen&rsquo;s arrest, and</p>
<p>he threatened to kill them right there if they even thought about running.</p>
<p>Dennis knew that the situation had gotten way out of hand, so he grabbed the gun from</p>
<p>his dad and stashed it in his dad&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Tracy&rsquo;s dad called the police, who found the gun in the car when they arrived on scene.</p>
<p>Dennis&rsquo; father was arrested, and neither Cody nor Tracy were found in possession of</p>
<p>Dennis&rsquo; car.</p>
<p>Now, notably, Dana wasn&rsquo;t there when all this went down, but police heard that Dennis</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t very fond of Dana because he thought that she helped Tracy steal his car.</p>
<p>Plus, according to rumors going around, Dana had refused a sexual advance that Dennis made.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Detective Smith had to say about Dennis and Dana.</p>
<p>And just to clarify, we were asked to bleep Dennis&rsquo; last name.</p>
<p>He had called, made insults about her and saying things that she was foul-mouthed and</p>
<p>that quote-unquote he would tear her throat out because he believed that Dana had helped</p>
<p>Tracy steal his vehicle.</p>
<p>Despite the Christmas Day incident and Dennis&rsquo; clear aversion to Dana, police couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>connect him or his dad to Dana&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>In fact, Dennis and his dad both took polygraph tests and passed.</p>
<p>After they exhausted that lead, Dana&rsquo;s case went cold.</p>
<p>The 80s were this gray area for DNA.</p>
<p>Some agencies were able to test their samples, others weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It just really depended on the department, and I&rsquo;m not sure Alameda County was ahead</p>
<p>of its time.</p>
<p>But finally, in 2001, DNA that had been collected from Dana&rsquo;s body, like samples from her</p>
<p>fingernails, as well as reference samples from John, Tracy, and Cody, were all sent</p>
<p>to a private forensic DNA lab.</p>
<p>The sample that came from the sexual assault kit taken when Dana was found matched John&rsquo;s</p>
<p>DNA.</p>
<p>But he and his friends at the house on December 28th confirmed that he and Dana had sex that</p>
<p>afternoon, so it didn&rsquo;t really help investigators advance the case.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, nothing came from her fingernail clippings.</p>
<p>Again, this is one of the cases that we&rsquo;re looking into as far as re-examining some evidence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not, the difficulty here is, with this case is, the evidence from the scene</p>
<p>where Dana&rsquo;s found, it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s not a lot, so unfortunately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just been a small amount of stuff to work with regarding, you know, stuff related</p>
<p>to a crime scene.</p>
<p>We really don&rsquo;t have a crime scene, we have, again, in all likelihood, her body is dumped</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>But where this strangulation took place, it&rsquo;s kind of like, where are her clothing at?</p>
<p>Her clothing is, we never found that.</p>
<p>So obviously where this, the murder took place is the actual crime scene.</p>
<p>We have the evidence we find, you know, with Dana when she&rsquo;s found on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Dana&rsquo;s case was formally reopened by detectives in Alameda County in 2005.</p>
<p>According to reporting by SFGATE, a $5,000 reward was offered that year to try and breathe</p>
<p>new life into the cold case, but no breakthroughs came from the reward announcement.</p>
<p>But when detectives started to reexamine the case files, they became suspicious of a man</p>
<p>who had never been considered a person of interest, a man who police connected to another</p>
<p>murder that happened nearby in Livermore that same year that Dana was killed.</p>
<p>On July 24th, 1986, a 59-year-old nurse was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in</p>
<p>her home, and it didn&rsquo;t take long for police to find her killer.</p>
<p>Almost eight months after the tragedy, investigators found physical evidence that put the nurse&rsquo;s</p>
<p>27-year-old neighbor, Richard Tully, right at the crime scene.</p>
<p>Richard admitted that he was at the scene, but vehemently denied killing the woman.</p>
<p>But no one bought that.</p>
<p>Richard was eventually sentenced to death for her murder in 1992.</p>
<p>Because of their proximity in age and similar locations, Dana and Richard had some mutual</p>
<p>friends.</p>
<p>So detectives wondered if maybe Richard was responsible for Dana&rsquo;s murder, but police</p>
<p>never found anything that linked him to the gas station or the area where Dana&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>was left.</p>
<p>Especially then, even now, Livermore is not a city.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very safe city.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a lot of violent crime.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t work for Livermore.</p>
<p>I grew up and lived in the area.</p>
<p>If they had one or two murders a year, that&rsquo;s probably about it, on average, maybe three.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a relatively safe city, so especially, you know, when something like that happens</p>
<p>and people run in the same circles, it catches your attention.</p>
<p>Detective Smith checked old case reports and he didn&rsquo;t think Richard Tully was ever interviewed</p>
<p>or asked if he had anything to do with Dana&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He said that Richard lived near the high school Dana attended, but that&rsquo;s the closest link</p>
<p>any investigator could ever come up with.</p>
<p>Richard isn&rsquo;t the only person of interest Detective Smith is still thinking about.</p>
<p>You see, when investigators searched Dana&rsquo;s van, they found something that they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been able to shake for 36 years.</p>
<p>It was a letter, and Detective Smith isn&rsquo;t sure if any of the original investigators</p>
<p>ever looked into its contents.</p>
<p>The letter was to Tracy.</p>
<p>It was dated September 7th, 1986, which was just a few months before Dana was murdered.</p>
<p>And the letter muses about this person that Dana had met and had had a sexual encounter</p>
<p>with while in South Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>It was a person that she called Happy, and she said this person was from Sinole.</p>
<p>The tone of the letter was overwhelmingly positive, like she was crushing hard on this</p>
<p>guy, but Happy, whoever he is, has never been identified by police.</p>
<p>And Detective Smith really wants to interview Happy, whoever he may be.</p>
<p>If there was a listener that knew, was familiar with Sinole, had lived in Sinole, was friends</p>
<p>with somebody, people in Sinole, around that time, someone&rsquo;s going to know who he is.</p>
<p>The other details we have about Happy are very limited, because Dana didn&rsquo;t provide</p>
<p>much description at all.</p>
<p>But Dana made it sound like Happy lived in Sinole for a long time, maybe even grew up</p>
<p>there, and was in South Lake Tahoe for just a little while, most likely just passing through.</p>
<p>Dana also wrote that Happy had previously lived in Hawaii, and they were a biker.</p>
<p>She said that his dad was a biker too, and they both owned Harley Davidson motorcycles.</p>
<p>Detectives need to know who Happy is and what he was up to when Dana vanished into the night.</p>
<p>Happy could be the missing piece in this convoluted puzzle, but the clock is truly ticking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 36 years since Dana was murdered, and Happy still remains nameless.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s found in Sinole.</p>
<p>Sinole&rsquo;s a very small place, and you look at the area, when you have killers who transport</p>
<p>victims and dispose of their bodies places, you know, many times they go to a place they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Because they know what&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a comfortability factor.</p>
<p>A lot of times they&rsquo;re driving to a place because they know where this place is at.</p>
<p>Could this mean something?</p>
<p>I would love to know who Happy is, and I&rsquo;d be able to identify Happy.</p>
<p>Sometimes I tell you at the end of these episodes that the help you can give law enforcement</p>
<p>is a shot in the dark or a reach, but I truly don&rsquo;t feel that way in this case.</p>
<p>The impact this unthinkable tragedy has had on the Ram family is immeasurable.</p>
<p>My life has changed in so many ways, but every decade it&rsquo;s a different layer.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s harder now than it was then.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the real mystery with this whole thing is that for some reason at this point</p>
<p>of my life, I yearn for her more and mourn for her more than when it happened.</p>
<p>We have so many reasons to stay hopeful that Dana&rsquo;s case will get solved.</p>
<p>I mean, Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office is reexamining evidence as I&rsquo;m recording</p>
<p>this episode.</p>
<p>So listeners, if you think you know who Happy is, or if you know anything about what happened</p>
<p>to Dana Ram in December of 1986, do not let this case stand solved.</p>
<p>Maybe you know something that could break this case wide open.</p>
<p>It is never too late.</p>
