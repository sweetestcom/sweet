    <p>Hi friends! So in this week&rsquo;s episode I want to talk about something I used to</p>
<p>struggle with really bad and it was hating myself and my body and criticizing</p>
<p>the fuck out of it and not seeming to be able to stop. So I&rsquo;ve gained some</p>
<p>awareness around why I did that and how to stop doing that and that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>want to share in this episode. And I do want to clarify, because I&rsquo;m gonna talk a</p>
<p>lot of shit on social media, I do want to clarify that by me talking my shit I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like degrading everyone or like trying to talk down on people. Everything</p>
<p>that I say there&rsquo;s a point behind it, there&rsquo;s a bigger reason behind what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying. So keep that in mind, my intention is not to degrade anyone or like just</p>
<p>genuinely just talk shit on people, it&rsquo;s to bring light to certain things. And if</p>
<p>it sounds a little mean then so be it, okay? So when it comes to social media</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things that you are not aware of, there&rsquo;s a lot of things that do</p>
<p>not meet the eye or shit that you don&rsquo;t see, like it&rsquo;s behind the curtain. I</p>
<p>touched on a lot of this in my first episode of this podcast, but this episode</p>
<p>is just strictly on body image and I&rsquo;m gonna just poke fun, for the first part,</p>
<p>at some of the shit that I notice and that I have to remind myself of when I</p>
<p>see really hot people on Instagram. Like the little secrets that they&rsquo;re hiding</p>
<p>and the little tricks that they do to look as hot as they do. I&rsquo;m gonna poke</p>
<p>fun at that real quick and then I&rsquo;m gonna get into some bigger realizations</p>
<p>towards the end. So my first one, like social media is constantly throwing hot</p>
<p>people in your face. I swear to God, you open your fucking Instagram, even if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t intentionally follow people that are extremely hot, and I call them the</p>
<p>people that like look hot for a living, because it&rsquo;s like their job to look hot.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I call them on Instagram, like if it&rsquo;s their job to look hot, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that type of influencer. Even if you don&rsquo;t follow that type of influencer, you</p>
<p>click your explore page on Instagram, boom, there they all are. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the 10 out of 10s, with not a thought behind their eyes, but they all look</p>
<p>fucking hot, like there they all are. You can&rsquo;t escape them, especially on TikTok.</p>
<p>Like everybody on TikTok is a fucking 10 out of 10. There&rsquo;s a couple like 9s</p>
<p>out of 10s, but 8 out of 10 is usually as low as it goes.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s fucking ugly on TikTok or Instagram anymore, and if you are seeing</p>
<p>ugly people, send them to me please, because I need to feel better about</p>
<p>myself. Okay, so getting back on track, with these hot-ass people that you see</p>
<p>on Instagram, let&rsquo;s just use Little Miss IG for the first example. You see</p>
<p>pictures of hot-ass people. The way that they are posing is not the way that they</p>
<p>stand in real life. So when you see these fine motherfuckers on Instagram and</p>
<p>their pictures, look at the way that they&rsquo;re standing. Are they standing</p>
<p>normal? Like when you get in the mirror, and when you look at yourself in the</p>
<p>mirror, are you comparing yourself standing straight normal to them doing</p>
<p>some weird-ass pose? So the fitness influencers are never standing straight</p>
<p>or normal. They&rsquo;re flexing something. They&rsquo;re poking their ass out. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>poking their fucking chest out. They&rsquo;re flexing their traps. They got their</p>
<p>fucking lats spread to look wider than they are. They&rsquo;re not just standing there</p>
<p>normally. No one actually looks like that when they&rsquo;re just standing there. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing that you need to like remind yourself of when you see really</p>
<p>really hot people on Instagram. Check the way that they&rsquo;re standing. Do they</p>
<p>actually look like that? Do they actually stand like that? Fuck no. Like Kylie</p>
<p>Jenner. She&rsquo;s a perfect example of someone doing some weird-ass poses, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of gonna go in on the whole BBL body for a minute, and I&rsquo;m sorry to</p>
<p>anybody that likes her. I like Kylie. I think she&rsquo;s cool, but I just gotta like</p>
<p>peel back her curtain real quick and give you guys some shit to remind</p>
<p>yourself of. The way this bitch poses, like get real, okay? She looks good for</p>
<p>the way that she poses. Have you ever seen her standing straight up? Have you</p>
<p>ever seen her standing normally or caught off guard by like paparazzi?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s two different bitches. That is two whole entirely different fucking people.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t see the one that stands normal. You only see the one where the</p>
<p>body looks perfect, and the whole BBL body style and like body type, if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what a BBL is, it&rsquo;s a Brazilian butt lift. So if you look at any</p>
<p>other Kardashians or Jenners, but not Kendall, her little skinny ass, they all</p>
<p>have the procedure, like a BBL is where they suck the fat out of the parts of</p>
<p>your body you don&rsquo;t want it in, and then they inject it into your ass and your</p>
<p>hips to give you the hourglass shape. That&rsquo;s like the ideal body type for</p>
<p>girls online, and I say ideal because those are the bitches with the most</p>
<p>followers, so don&rsquo;t try to fight me on it. But all of these girls look super, super</p>
<p>hot online. Their bodies look good, but if you ever see them caught off guard, they</p>
<p>look fucked up. They look like misshapen, and I don&rsquo;t mean that in a bad way,</p>
<p>because the angles that they have right, like Kylie Jenner, the way she fucking</p>
<p>looks in the angles where she picks them, like damn, like she knows how to look</p>
<p>good, and like she knows what she knows her fucking angles, that&rsquo;s it. But when</p>
<p>you see her standing off guard, or you see her standing straight on, her hips, yo,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not one to body shame and talk shit, but they don&rsquo;t look as good in real</p>
<p>life as they seem online, and that comes back to like the posing thing. So not</p>
<p>even Kylie Jenner, I&rsquo;m talking about everybody now, anybody on social media</p>
<p>will look good in a certain pose, but what do they look like standing up</p>
<p>normally? What do they look like naturally? Because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>comparing yourself to when you&rsquo;re standing in your mirror looking at your</p>
<p>fucking naked body, looking at things you want to change. You&rsquo;re comparing</p>
<p>yourself to a bitch that looks good sitting down, or with half her body</p>
<p>twisted in a certain way. You&rsquo;re not comparing yourself to that same person</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re standing there just caught off guard, or standing like a normal</p>
<p>human being. So that&rsquo;s an unfair comparison, and stop doing that to</p>
<p>yourself. Now the second thing you got to keep in mind is lighting. Lighting can</p>
<p>change fucking everything. Face structure, the amount of muscle it looks like you</p>
<p>have, the definition in your body, like lighting can literally make or fucking</p>
<p>break you, and no one can change my mind on it. That&rsquo;s why I always say take</p>
<p>pictures of me in the dark. I look better in the fucking dark. If you put the flash</p>
<p>on, I can tone down. You can&rsquo;t tone up a picture. You can tone it down. So if you</p>
<p>put it on the flash and it&rsquo;s too bright, bitch, we can tone it down and look fine. If</p>
<p>you can see too much, we can blur it out and we can make it darker. Boom. Perfect.</p>
<p>Done. Go on my Instagram, most of my shit&rsquo;s in the dark. Sorry about it. Like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking honest. Lighting can make or break you, but if you look at fitness</p>
<p>influencers and specific guys, but like girls deal with it too, like the male</p>
<p>influencers, when they&rsquo;re trying to show off their abs or their muscles, they</p>
<p>usually catch a downward lighting because it casts shadows. So like your</p>
<p>pecs underneath will have more of a shadow. Your abs will have more shadows,</p>
<p>your shoulders, everything has more shadows. So you look way more defined,</p>
<p>like literally lighting. I swear to God, I love the trend on Tik TOK where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, this is me in perfect lighting with a pump versus me in real life</p>
<p>because having a pump also can change the entire fucking way that you look</p>
<p>because everybody knows how you look normal. And then when you go to the gym</p>
<p>and you get a pump, that&rsquo;s two different people. I swear to God, it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>feeling. You will feel so good about yourself when you have a pump and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the state people are in when they&rsquo;re taking these pictures of themselves.</p>
<p>They got the perfect lighting and they got the pump half the time. They got</p>
<p>fucking oil on their self to make their self look sweaty and shiny and look</p>
<p>better for their picture. I&rsquo;m not shitting you. I&rsquo;ve literally seen</p>
<p>motherfuckers in my gym with a can of Pam, spraying their self to take</p>
<p>pictures. I&rsquo;m not shitting you. Like you, that&rsquo;s the thing is you also don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that normal Joe Schmoe ass people are doing this. They are. A lot more</p>
<p>people put a lot more effort into their pictures than you think. So even though</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t seem like a big influencer, they&rsquo;re still doing what they can to</p>
<p>look their best in their photos. Another thing, professional ass cameras. They all</p>
<p>have them. I swear. Because who the motherfuck is taking this good of</p>
<p>pictures on their iPhone camera? Okay, I have an iPhone 12 Pro. My pictures don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look as good as these people online. So I fucking, I&rsquo;m going out on a limb and</p>
<p>saying that they all have professional cameras. Because my cameras don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>taking pictures like that. It&rsquo;s not like I have a fucking iPhone 8 and I&rsquo;m over</p>
<p>here like, why don&rsquo;t my pictures look like theirs? Nah bitch, I got the newest</p>
<p>and best phone. I know how the camera is. My camera don&rsquo;t be looking like that.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s someone insanely hot and like I&rsquo;m taking a picture of. Bitch, they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be looking like that. So y&rsquo;all&rsquo;s pictures are not off an iPhone and you</p>
<p>bitches can fight me on it. I swear to God, these people that you&rsquo;re following,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not taking pictures on a normal ass camera. Sometimes they might. Okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give them the benefit of the doubt once in a while. But if you notice someone has</p>
<p>like really, really good pictures non-stop, that ain&rsquo;t their fucking phone.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re comparing your pictures to something you&rsquo;re taking on your phone</p>
<p>because you think it&rsquo;s easy. You think you just pull your phone out and take a</p>
<p>picture. That&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re doing. They make it seem like that. So when you</p>
<p>pull your phone out and you take a picture and it looks like dog shit, you</p>
<p>compare it to people that you think do the same thing. When in reality, they got</p>
<p>a professional ass camera. They got good ass lighting. They got people teaching</p>
<p>them how to pose. And they&rsquo;re probably taking other steps to look a certain</p>
<p>way. Whether it&rsquo;s an outfit that it emphasizes certain things or like I said</p>
<p>with the Pam, like spraying their self with like cooking spray. That&rsquo;s what Pam</p>
<p>is. I should have clarified. Spraying their self with spray to look a certain</p>
<p>fucking way. And then they&rsquo;re gonna filter it and edit it. And there are</p>
<p>filters to make shit look natural. There are adjustments you can make to a photo</p>
<p>to make it look natural, but it will be edited out the fucking ass. It just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look like it. And that&rsquo;s the whole point. It&rsquo;s like girls and their</p>
<p>fucking no makeup makeup look. Like they put on makeup to look like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have makeup on. So the way you&rsquo;re comparing yourself to all these people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not fair. But these are the things that you need to remind yourself of when</p>
<p>you see these really hot people online. There&rsquo;s a lot more that goes to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more behind the scenes than you realize. People are not just</p>
<p>throwing up their phone and taking a fucking picture of their self like they</p>
<p>make it seem. Another thing is a lot more people are on steroids than you think. A</p>
<p>lot more people have cosmetic work done or fillers or lip injections or Botox or</p>
<p>whatever you want to talk about. That shit is so much more common than you</p>
<p>think. That&rsquo;s why that industry makes so much money. Because so many people are</p>
<p>having that shit done. And people that you wouldn&rsquo;t even expect. Because there</p>
<p>are people that get cosmetic procedures or injectables to look natural. And there</p>
<p>are people that take steroids to look better, air quote, natural. Like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to still look natural but they&rsquo;re taking enhancing drugs to achieve that</p>
<p>look. Or they&rsquo;re doing cosmetic procedures to achieve the cute natural</p>
<p>look. I get Botox in my upper lip. So my top lip does not move symmetrically. Like</p>
<p>one side pulls more than the other. And I get Botox to help make it move</p>
<p>symmetrically. It still pulls a little bit more but not as bad as without it.</p>
<p>But also getting Botox, it&rsquo;s called a lip flip, getting Botox above your lip makes</p>
<p>your top lip look bigger. That is the tiniest procedure you can have done. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little needle. They stick you four times and you&rsquo;re done. It takes fucking</p>
<p>20 seconds. Hurts like a bitch. But it takes 20 seconds and it lasts a few</p>
<p>months. It&rsquo;s the tiniest thing but it makes a huge difference. And you would</p>
<p>never know. Like it&rsquo;s made to look natural. It&rsquo;s made to look normal. But I</p>
<p>have something in my back pocket that&rsquo;s giving me an upper hand to look better</p>
<p>than I normally would. Just no one has a fucking clue. I know people in my life</p>
<p>that have taken steroids or are currently on steroids or some kind of</p>
<p>performance enhancing drug that look like they are not on steroids. They look</p>
<p>good, sure. But the typical, what you say, the motherfucker that you think is on</p>
<p>steroids. The typical idea for what someone on steroids looks like, just a</p>
<p>name that everybody knows, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Like he is the ideal for</p>
<p>like a motherfucker that looks like that you know is on steroids. But that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>what the publicized and like mainstream idea of what someone on steroids looks</p>
<p>like is that. There are so many normal Joe Schmo motherfuckers on steroids that</p>
<p>look average as fuck. Like there&rsquo;s been so many people that have told me they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on steroids and I&rsquo;m like huh. Like I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude but like okay cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like shocked in the back of my head. Like you bitch. Like you be honest. I</p>
<p>would not claim that. If I looked normal I would not claim that I was on steroids.</p>
<p>You look dumb. Or you look like you&rsquo;re doing the wrong shit. Like I will get on</p>
<p>steroids later in my life. I haven&rsquo;t taken steroids before. I&rsquo;ve not taken any</p>
<p>performance enhancing drug. I&rsquo;ve done fucking creatine. That&rsquo;s a goddamn</p>
<p>supplement you could buy at the store. That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about like actual steroids. I&rsquo;ll do them eventually. I&rsquo;m educated on like</p>
<p>your hormones and your chemicals in your body. I don&rsquo;t want to fuck mine up while</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still leveling out. I&rsquo;m 23 so I got some time. I think when I&rsquo;m about 26</p>
<p>to 28 I&rsquo;ll start fucking around with steroids if I&rsquo;m not happy with the way</p>
<p>that I look and I want to look a certain way. Then I&rsquo;ll start doing it. But I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna wait. But I&rsquo;m open and honest about that shit. If I was on the shit I&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>I was on something and I would tell you what I was on and my dose. I love that</p>
<p>now in the fitness community everyone&rsquo;s open about it and talking about their</p>
<p>steroid use. Like you didn&rsquo;t just lie about it for five fucking years to get</p>
<p>famous. You were the 18 year old that could lift 600 fucking pounds David</p>
<p>Laid and you made everybody think that your physique and your strength level</p>
<p>was attainable at your age for so long. You&rsquo;re a fucking liar and you portrayed</p>
<p>this false image to people and gave them false hope. Like I&rsquo;m the same age as him</p>
<p>and I grew up watching him and I was always like kind of jealous that I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t look like that. The motherfucker&rsquo;s been on drugs his whole fucking life.</p>
<p>Like no shit I didn&rsquo;t look like that. I was comparing myself to an ideal that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t real. So of course I was dissatisfied with the way that I look</p>
<p>and that kind of ties into everything I just told you guys about people looking</p>
<p>a certain way on social media. You&rsquo;re comparing yourself to something that is</p>
<p>not real. You&rsquo;re convincing yourself that these people look like this in an</p>
<p>effortless way. They don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re putting so much more effort in than you</p>
<p>realize. So don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t criticize yourself and like beat yourself up</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t look near as good as they do. No shit you don&rsquo;t. One thing you</p>
<p>need to realize about most of these people that are really hot on social</p>
<p>media is it&rsquo;s their job to look hot. That is their job. That is their nine-to-five.</p>
<p>I mean it never really ends if that&rsquo;s your job. But these people that look</p>
<p>freakishly fucking perfect, they don&rsquo;t have a normal job bitch. They&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to a real nine-to-five. They&rsquo;re not dealing with the stress of having a</p>
<p>normal job. Their job is to look hot. They spend all their time of the day and</p>
<p>their energy in their appearance and the way that they look. So of course they</p>
<p>look better than you. You have shit to do. You live in real life. You have actual</p>
<p>worries and concerns and bigger shit to deal with. Not to worry about only the</p>
<p>way that you look. Oh my god one more thing I wanted to talk about was skin</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s skin texture and stretch marks and acne and all of that. Everyone</p>
<p>on social media has perfect fucking skin and it pisses me off. I have stretch</p>
<p>marks like a motherfucker. Like in my arms and like the typical ones on like</p>
<p>your shoulders and your chest. Like when you start working out I have them on my</p>
<p>forearms. I have them on my hips and like my stomach area because I was like fat</p>
<p>as a kid. Like I wasn&rsquo;t ever like huge but I was like a chubby little shit as a</p>
<p>kid. And I&rsquo;ve grown really fast. Like I&rsquo;m 6'7&quot;. You don&rsquo;t just fucking get this</p>
<p>tall without any signs of like wear on your body. Like I had to stretch very</p>
<p>fast and like I have stretch marks on me. They&rsquo;re not that noticeable but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there. And sometimes I&rsquo;ll get like an ingrown hair or I&rsquo;ll get like</p>
<p>acne or on my face or my neck. Like when you shave and you get a fucking razor</p>
<p>bump or an ingrown hair. Like shit happens. Like I&rsquo;m a normal human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get like a pimple or whatever on my back or my shoulder or whatever every</p>
<p>once in a while. Even I used to get them all the time but it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve grown</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m out of that stage of like puberty where my shits a little bit more</p>
<p>balanced so I don&rsquo;t break out as often. But people online don&rsquo;t break out. People</p>
<p>online do not have fucking acne and they do not have fucking stretch marks. I</p>
<p>swear to God it&rsquo;s the most frustrating shit. Everybody&rsquo;s skin look like milk.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s fucking perfect and it pisses me off. And something I realized</p>
<p>about this last night. I went and saw the movie The House of Gucci with Lady Gaga</p>
<p>in it. I know y&rsquo;all heard about it. That fucking movie was so good and that</p>
<p>fucking piece of shit Maurizio Gucci got what the fuck he deserved. Okay. It</p>
<p>got revealed in the trailer so I&rsquo;m not like spoiling anything. But Lady Gaga&rsquo;s</p>
<p>character hired a hitman to kill her husband which is Gucci. Like fuck him.</p>
<p>What he did to her. That&rsquo;s what he he fucking had it coming. Alright. But anyway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the point. It&rsquo;s a good movie. You should watch it. But my point with</p>
<p>that is there&rsquo;s a scene in it when Lady Gaga is in a hotel room with her husband</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting into a little fight. Whatever. But she took her shirt off and</p>
<p>she was like changing clothes. And it showed in that scene the lighting like</p>
<p>reflected off of her arms and her back. And she had like you know those tiny</p>
<p>little bumps on like your skin. I have them. Like a lot of people have them and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a normal thing. It&rsquo;s like the tiny little bumps. Like you know when you</p>
<p>get chicken pot. Not chicken pox. What the fuck is it called? Like chill bumps. Like</p>
<p>when you get like a chill and like you get a little. What the fuck is it called?</p>
<p>Goosebumps. Goosebumps. The goose and geese bumps. So those like on your arm.</p>
<p>But like they&rsquo;re not that bad or that severe. But there&rsquo;s like little dots all</p>
<p>over your arms. And the lighting like in that scene showed it on her shoulders</p>
<p>and her arms. And I was like oh my fucking God. Like she&rsquo;s a normal human</p>
<p>being. I got so excited that I related to Lady Gaga. Like someone that is not shown</p>
<p>and like celebrities are not shown in the light to have flaws. So like to see</p>
<p>that she doesn&rsquo;t have like perfect skin like every fucking body else. That made</p>
<p>me so happy. Like I felt like I related to her and connected to her in that</p>
<p>moment. I was like holy shit. Yeah I be getting too deep into everything. Leave</p>
<p>me alone. But that made me realize so much about myself. Because when I was</p>
<p>like very insecure. When I would see people online. I would immediately look</p>
<p>for their flaws. And even people in real life. Like whenever I felt intimidated by</p>
<p>someone or I felt like someone was better than me. I would immediately just</p>
<p>start looking for their flaws to make myself feel better. So like if someone</p>
<p>had a stretch mark. Or if they had like the bumps on their arm like Lady Gaga. Or</p>
<p>if they had like weird shaped thumbnails. Like fingernails. That&rsquo;s one thing that I</p>
<p>like made myself feel better about with one guy. He was like super fucking hot.</p>
<p>But he had like club fingers and I was like ha. When I was really insecure I</p>
<p>used to do that. And I never knew why I did that. I would never voice it to</p>
<p>people. I&rsquo;ve never left a hate comment in my life. I&rsquo;m not the type of person to</p>
<p>point that shit out. But in my brain I would always look for people&rsquo;s flaws. Or</p>
<p>shit that was wrong with them. Because it made me feel better. I never knew why it</p>
<p>did. But and I didn&rsquo;t know why I ever did it. I didn&rsquo;t know how to stop it. But I</p>
<p>realized last night when I watched that movie. Like I don&rsquo;t look for people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>flaws anymore to feel better about myself. Like oh look at them. They&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>fucked up. I look for people&rsquo;s flaws now to relate to them. Like when I saw Lady</p>
<p>Gaga had the bumps on her arms. I got so excited and like happy that she&rsquo;s human</p>
<p>just like me. Like it&rsquo;s normal. Like it&rsquo;s not. Having bumps on your arms is normal.</p>
<p>Some people just fucking have them. Like that&rsquo;s just how it is. Oh my god. Like it</p>
<p>made me so fucking excited that the bitch is like a human. And like I look at</p>
<p>people now when I see that they have like an air quote flaw. Or if they have a</p>
<p>sign that they&rsquo;re a real human being. That social media does not show. I get</p>
<p>happy because I relate. Because I have it too. It&rsquo;s not like oh I need to find</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with you. So I don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re that much above me. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no. Now I can relate to you. So I guess the whole mindset shift of like looking</p>
<p>at people as how are we the same makes me feel a lot better than just trying to</p>
<p>rip people down in my brain or make myself seem less ugly. I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to explain that but I hope that made sense. But just start looking for the way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re like the same as other people and you&rsquo;ll start feeling a lot</p>
<p>more connected to them. And you&rsquo;ll start feeling a lot less alone. Oh but back to</p>
<p>like social media. A lot of people deal with that shit. A lot more people have it</p>
<p>than you think but they blur it out. Or they&rsquo;ll smooth their skin in pictures.</p>
<p>Now you do have the people that will post about their stretch marks or their</p>
<p>acne or acne scars and I love that shit. Like I love when people are vulnerable</p>
<p>and real and honest because just how seeing Lady Gaga made me feel like less</p>
<p>alone. Those posts make people feel less alone. Another thing that I&rsquo;ve realized</p>
<p>about myself in specific is I&rsquo;m not photogenic. Like it&rsquo;s very like I&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>a good picture of myself every once in a while and then I&rsquo;ll hang on to that</p>
<p>fucker like it&rsquo;s the golden ticket to the goddamn Willy Wonka Palace. Like I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just hold on to it for a while. I&rsquo;ll just use that picture. Like that&rsquo;s my go-to</p>
<p>picture. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t post a lot of selfies because bitch they&rsquo;re a dime a</p>
<p>dozen. I don&rsquo;t take good pictures very often. But I realized I look like shit in</p>
<p>my phone camera and like on camera like I just don&rsquo;t feel like I look good</p>
<p>because I see myself in my mirror and I&rsquo;m like damn I&rsquo;m fucking cute and then</p>
<p>I try to take a picture of myself in that mirror and I&rsquo;m like god damn I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually ugly. That right there. You need to stop thinking that shit cuz I know</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all do the same thing. The way you look on camera is not the way you look in</p>
<p>real life. I promise you. And because I saw this one TikTok and it made me like</p>
<p>really believe this when this girl said you know when you take a picture of the</p>
<p>sunset and it never shows up as good on your phone? Like it looks way better in</p>
<p>real life than on your phone. Your phone can&rsquo;t capture the actual beauty of the</p>
<p>sunset. You&rsquo;re the same way. And since seeing that bitch&rsquo;s TikTok it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>changed me because I&rsquo;d be feeling like I am ugly as shit in my phone camera. Like</p>
<p>when I take a selfie, ugh. I&rsquo;m like god woof. Like holy shit. But then I look at</p>
<p>myself in the mirror in real life and I can like see myself more 3D and like I</p>
<p>can see myself the way that I move. You know? I know I&rsquo;m looking at a mirror and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 2D shut the fuck up but I look 3D in it. Okay? Don&rsquo;t attack me for that. I</p>
<p>know it sounds stupid. And also another thing. When you&rsquo;re looking at yourself in</p>
<p>a certain mirror. Remember when I said lighting is important? You need to look</p>
<p>at yourself in other mirrors too. Whenever you get the chance, go to a</p>
<p>different mirror. Look at yourself in different lightings, in different places,</p>
<p>in different atmospheres, in different mirrors. You will appreciate yourself so</p>
<p>much more because you will see that you look a lot different than you think. Like</p>
<p>when you get used to looking at yourself in just one mirror and one lighting like</p>
<p>in your bedroom or your bathroom, you don&rsquo;t see certain shit. Like not every</p>
<p>mirror will show you the same thing. It sounds fucking wacky but start looking</p>
<p>at yourself in other mirrors and you&rsquo;ll start seeing shit you didn&rsquo;t notice</p>
<p>before. You&rsquo;re just used to looking at yourself in one place. That&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>confidence boost but some of them, goddamn, do it when you feel yourself</p>
<p>because if you try and look in a different mirror when you like don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel your best or you actually look ugly, oof, it&rsquo;ll hurt your feelings. Also, look at</p>
<p>yourself from the side in the mirrors. Like move around, like turn around and</p>
<p>look at yourself in different angles because when I look at myself head-on</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re a fucking whale and then I look at myself from the side or I</p>
<p>turn a little bit I&rsquo;m like okay that&rsquo;s like doable, you know? So move around a</p>
<p>little. Like actually if you&rsquo;re gonna look at yourself in the mirror, check</p>
<p>yourself the fuck out. Do a little spin for yourself. So one of the big</p>
<p>realizations that I&rsquo;m so excited to talk about is the one about social media</p>
<p>creating a certain norm and an idea of what is air quote normal. Big fat fucking</p>
<p>air quote around what&rsquo;s normal. So when you look at your phone, okay, and you get</p>
<p>on social media whether it&rsquo;s Instagram, TikTok, whatever fucking tickles your</p>
<p>fancy, even if you don&rsquo;t directly follow the fitness influencers where it&rsquo;s their</p>
<p>job to look hot, the ones that I talked about before, they will come up on your</p>
<p>explore page. They will come up on your fucking for you page. They&rsquo;ll find a way</p>
<p>in front of your face, I swear to God. Like the hot people, they just, their pages</p>
<p>just get pushed by the algorithm into everybody&rsquo;s goddamn face. So what this</p>
<p>does is when you&rsquo;re shown incredibly hot people over and over and over again, you</p>
<p>start to think that&rsquo;s more common than it is. So if you&rsquo;re constantly seeing</p>
<p>bitches with BBLs for girls or if like guys, like if you&rsquo;re constantly seeing</p>
<p>people with perfect bodies and abs and looking hot, you&rsquo;re gonna see it a whole</p>
<p>bunch, but subconsciously you&rsquo;re gonna think it&rsquo;s a lot more common than it is.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re seeing this shit daily, multiple times a day, multiple different</p>
<p>people. So when you start seeing this as common and it happens way too long,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna start subconsciously seeing this as like normal. This is the normal</p>
<p>way to look. This is the normal way to be. And this becomes a major fucking</p>
<p>problem when you don&rsquo;t match that and you don&rsquo;t fit what is air quote now seen</p>
<p>as normal by the subconscious in your mind. So now when you look at yourself in</p>
<p>the mirror, you&rsquo;re not gonna see the good things about you. You&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>see the things that you have to appreciate. You&rsquo;re immediately gonna</p>
<p>start seeing the ways that you&rsquo;re not what you see on social media. It&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be subconscious. You&rsquo;re not gonna know why you don&rsquo;t like your body. You&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>not gonna fucking like it. And you&rsquo;re always gonna see what&rsquo;s wrong instead of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right and what you like. That takes effort. To look at the positive and</p>
<p>to look at what you like takes effort. Your subconscious is just gonna do it</p>
<p>for you and it&rsquo;s always what you&rsquo;re lacking. Because your brain automatically</p>
<p>compares. So if you&rsquo;ve got this idea or this image of what is normal and you get</p>
<p>in front of a mirror, you&rsquo;re already subconsciously comparing. And when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>comparing and contrasting and you&rsquo;re seeing, no I&rsquo;m not built like Kylie</p>
<p>Jenner. Or I&rsquo;m not built like Arnold Schwarzenegger. If that&rsquo;s who you people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d like to follow like the fitness influencers. I just use him because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very known name. You&rsquo;re only gonna see what you need to fix. So I realized this</p>
<p>when I was at a hotel pool a couple weeks ago. So I had been dieting so</p>
<p>fucking hard for this trip. I like isolated myself. I quit going out. I quit</p>
<p>hanging out with people. I quit hanging out with friends. Like I literally just</p>
<p>like hermited myself like a hermit crab and fucking worked on the way that I</p>
<p>looked. Because I was so excited to go to this pool. And I was like oh my god I</p>
<p>want to finally be confident for once and the way that I look going and taking</p>
<p>my shirt off somewhere. Because I never have. For the first time in 23 years I</p>
<p>finally felt confident without my shirt on at a place. And this was before I went</p>
<p>to EDC because I took my shirt off there and I felt really good too. But</p>
<p>anyway I was dieting really hard because I was so excited to go and spend the</p>
<p>weekend by this fucking hotel pool. And when I got there like I didn&rsquo;t think I</p>
<p>was gonna look that good like compared to everybody else. I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>look good but I&rsquo;m not gonna be the best-looking one at the pool. Like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure everyone&rsquo;s gonna be fucking hot but I don&rsquo;t want to be like cripplingly</p>
<p>insecure when I&rsquo;m there. So I&rsquo;m putting all this work into my body you know. I</p>
<p>want to look like as good as I can even though I know I&rsquo;m not gonna look the</p>
<p>best. So when I get to this fucking pool I realized what the fuck? Like I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>best-looking one here. And in my mind I was like I don&rsquo;t even look that good. So</p>
<p>how the fuck am I the best-looking one here? Like this is sad. And the reason I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think I looked that good is because I was comparing myself to what I</p>
<p>was seeing on social media. And the guys that I see there and the fitness</p>
<p>influencers that I was following at the time. I was comparing myself to that. So</p>
<p>comparing to them, nah I didn&rsquo;t look that good. But comparing myself to the real</p>
<p>life and real people and real bodies that were at that pool, I looked fucking</p>
<p>good. Half the people there were fucking hippos alright. If you&rsquo;re fat and</p>
<p>sensitive, I used to be fat too I&rsquo;m allowed to say it shut up. But I was so</p>
<p>shocked. Like I was the best-looking one at the pool. Me? Like I like I was so</p>
<p>shell-shocked by that. And that is what made me realize yo what I&rsquo;m comparing</p>
<p>myself to is not fucking real. Because where are all these fucking fruitcakes</p>
<p>that I see online? None of y&rsquo;all was at the motherfucking pool. None of y&rsquo;all was</p>
<p>at that casino I was in I was at. Like all the ones down the street like where</p>
<p>the fuck were you guys? Where were all these hot ass people that I was seeing</p>
<p>online? Nowhere to fucking be found. Nowhere to be found. And I have traveled</p>
<p>a lot of places. And I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of like air quote Instagram hot people in</p>
<p>real life. A couple of them look hot but a lot of them just look really</p>
<p>uncomfortable. But they don&rsquo;t really fucking look like that. Like they look</p>
<p>good like I said in their one pose, under their certain lighting, and their</p>
<p>certain little outfit they had for Instagram. That&rsquo;s when they look good.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t look good in real life moving around and breathing. They don&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>good as a human. They look good as a fucking little picture online. But yeah</p>
<p>going to that pool shocked the fuck out of me. And it made me realize like how</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;ve been being to myself. And this idea of what I&rsquo;m supposed to look like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been served to me by social media. And I went through and I unfollowed all</p>
<p>the people that were like super fucking hot. None of them have personality</p>
<p>anyways. All they are is they&rsquo;re fucking what I eat in a day. And their macro</p>
<p>split and their workouts and their exercises that everybody fucking does.</p>
<p>How many exercises can you do that I haven&rsquo;t seen before bitch? Everyone knows</p>
<p>how to fucking work out okay? So these people like that&rsquo;s another thing I</p>
<p>realized. And it&rsquo;s these really really hot people online. All their personality</p>
<p>is is being hot. All these little fitness boys. If you take any of these fucking</p>
<p>faggots out of the gym, they&rsquo;re losers. Like in the gym they know what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing. They know what they&rsquo;re talking about. They have their little friends in</p>
<p>there. But you take a fucking fruitcake that spends all of his time working out</p>
<p>and eating chicken and rice. You take him out one night stiff as a board,</p>
<p>uncomfortable, can&rsquo;t make a conversation, doesn&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do with</p>
<p>himself or his hands, seems like a like a newborn fucking baby giraffe, doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to walk. Like walks like they have a stick in their ass because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to like flex their muscles. Like keep flexing your muscles Jordan. You</p>
<p>look like a fucking imbecile. In the wise words of fucking Margot Robbie. Like</p>
<p>these motherfuckers, you&rsquo;re comparing yourself to people that you see them in</p>
<p>their prime, in their element. Like these little fitness people. You see them at</p>
<p>the gym. Of course they look good. Of course that is their specialty. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a doctor. If you talk to a doctor in the hospital, they are on their shit. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>intimidating. They&rsquo;re scary because that&rsquo;s their field. That&rsquo;s where they</p>
<p>know everything about. You talk to a doctor in a real life, half of them have</p>
<p>no fucking social skills because they&rsquo;ve spent so long of their life with their</p>
<p>face in a fucking book. Yeah, they know what they&rsquo;re talking about in the</p>
<p>hospital, but that&rsquo;s it. They don&rsquo;t have much, what&rsquo;s it called, range with their</p>
<p>personality. They know what they know and that&rsquo;s it. Same with these little fitness</p>
<p>boys. They know how to be cool in the gym. They know how to lift. They know how to</p>
<p>look hot, but they don&rsquo;t know how to socialize. They don&rsquo;t know how to have a</p>
<p>conversation that&rsquo;s not about fucking lifting or eating chicken. There are</p>
<p>exceptions to the rule, but I&rsquo;ve had to learn about myself. The least important</p>
<p>or interesting thing about me is the fact that I work out. The most</p>
<p>interesting thing about these people that are fucking hot is that they work</p>
<p>out or that they&rsquo;re hot. So that&rsquo;s another thing you need to remind yourself</p>
<p>of is these people you&rsquo;re comparing yourself to, it&rsquo;s very shallow and no</p>
<p>depth and no range. So if you are funny and you&rsquo;re like mildly cute, boom, you</p>
<p>already win. Because these motherfuckers are stiff as a board. Light as a feather,</p>
<p>stiff as a board. Light as a feather, stiff as a board. I&rsquo;m gonna start levitating in this fucking room right now.</p>
<p>I need to stop with the witchy shit. But yeah, take any person that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>intimidated by or you think is like super cool and take them out of what</p>
<p>they know and see if they can still survive. Because if you have a resilient</p>
<p>personality and you have like a personality with range, you can survive</p>
<p>in any social setting. I&rsquo;m one of those people, thank God. I&rsquo;ve had to put a lot</p>
<p>of fucking effort into myself to learn about a lot of different things so that</p>
<p>I can hang in different social situations. Like doctors, talk to them</p>
<p>anything about other than their field and they&rsquo;re a fucking little toddler.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re an idiot. They don&rsquo;t get it. Like talk to a fitness boy about anything</p>
<p>other than fitness. Try it. Try to have a conversation. See how one, they have</p>
<p>nothing to say or two, how they try to find a way to resort it back to fitness.</p>
<p>Another great example of this, I know the audio switches and it sounds different,</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;m recording this later, I need to throw these little two cents in.</p>
<p>An example of this is people on TikTok, like the little thirst trappers. The ones</p>
<p>that just look cute or like do certain little weird shit and they look really</p>
<p>hot while they&rsquo;re doing it. They look super fucking hot in their TikToks. They</p>
<p>know what they&rsquo;re doing, they know their angle, they know their transition. They</p>
<p>can construct that to make their self look hot as fuck and to portray a</p>
<p>certain image. But if you take them out of TikTok, they ain&rsquo;t shit. And that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole topic in and of itself, is social media making nobodies feel like they are</p>
<p>somebody. But just because someone can make a little video of their self and do</p>
<p>it really well, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they have any other valuable skill sets or</p>
<p>that they are a certain type of person in real life. That may just be all that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re good at, you know? But my point is you&rsquo;re comparing yourself to someone</p>
<p>that is really good at what they&rsquo;re doing. If you make a TikTok and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not skilled at it, of course it&rsquo;s gonna look like ass. It&rsquo;s not gonna look as</p>
<p>cool as theirs. You&rsquo;re gonna think they&rsquo;re a lot cooler than they actually</p>
<p>are. They&rsquo;re not. They just have certain skills that you don&rsquo;t. If you put them in</p>
<p>a place where you have a lot of skills, they would struggle. You would feel like</p>
<p>you had the upper hand. So you got to remind yourself of that. As you have</p>
<p>skills too, you have value too, just not in the same areas as them maybe. But even</p>
<p>the areas that they have the value, when they look cool, girl, it&rsquo;s social media.</p>
<p>Who even gives a fuck, you know? Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna polish this off with a</p>
<p>realization that I have like half realized and it was a couple days ago.</p>
<p>The realization is, what for? That&rsquo;s it. Like, that&rsquo;s the fucking realization.</p>
<p>People spend so much time and energy going to the gym or working on their</p>
<p>body to look hot. Okay, cool. Like, I understand the motive behind trying to</p>
<p>look hot is trying to find a partner and like trying to be attractive to</p>
<p>others. Okay, great. I get that. But like, for what? Like, why are you going to the</p>
<p>gym every day to pick shit up and put it down? Have you seen any fitness person?</p>
<p>Like, I hate that they call it a sport because, bitch, all you&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>working on the way that you look. Like, you&rsquo;re not able to do anything. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to pick shit up and put it down. You&rsquo;re not learning a skill. You&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>training for a sport. You&rsquo;re not training to do an activity. You&rsquo;re not training to</p>
<p>be able to like do gymnastics or some shit. You&rsquo;re going to the gym to be able</p>
<p>to move heavy things and to look cute or like look big and muscular. What more? You</p>
<p>know what I mean? Like, what more is there? Like, I&rsquo;m over training just for looks.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m like, I recently started picking up like calisthenics and like</p>
<p>being able to do certain shit with my body and I really want to get into like</p>
<p>gymnastics and be able to do some freaky ass shit because I&rsquo;m pretty flexible but</p>
<p>I want to like get there. Like, I want to be able to do them little handstands you</p>
<p>could do from like sitting down to doing a handstand. That shit&rsquo;s cool to me. I</p>
<p>want to start training to be able to like accomplish more than just looking</p>
<p>good. I want to be able to do shit. Like, I want to have more to show for my</p>
<p>effort and my like training than just looking cute because like what the fuck</p>
<p>for? Like, that&rsquo;s boring. I&rsquo;d rather be able to do cool shit like flips. That was</p>
<p>just a random realization I had of like what for? Like, I need more from working</p>
<p>out now. I just look at it as so superficial and like a waste of fucking</p>
<p>time. Like, it&rsquo;s kind of selfish too. Let&rsquo;s not get on to that topic but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>honestly let&rsquo;s just do it. Like, it&rsquo;s selfish. You spend this much time and</p>
<p>energy just to look good. For what? You know, you could be doing something way</p>
<p>more productive for like a better outcome. I just look at it like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much effort for so little outcome because I guess, oh that&rsquo;s what it is, my</p>
<p>values now about looking good are a lot different. Like, I don&rsquo;t think looking</p>
<p>good is the point of life anymore and trying to be cute and attractive. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not what does it for me anymore. That&rsquo;s not my goal. That&rsquo;s not what I think is</p>
<p>like the most important. So now I look at all the time and effort and energy put</p>
<p>into just solely looking better as a waste and don&rsquo;t try to come for me and</p>
<p>say, I do it to be healthy. Shut the fuck up. Shut up. You don&rsquo;t fucking go to the</p>
<p>gym to be healthy because you eat like shit. All right, if you think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting all the nutrients you need from some chicken and some rice, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Okay bitch, so don&rsquo;t try and come at me about trying to be healthy. Shooting</p>
<p>fucking needles in your body with substances that you don&rsquo;t know what they</p>
<p>actually are because you bought them from some guy in the fucking gym. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give a fuck about health. Shut up. That ain&rsquo;t why you&rsquo;re working out. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working out to look cute and it&rsquo;s okay because me too. I&rsquo;m just saying like</p>
<p>these are the new ideas and perspectives I&rsquo;m taking on about this</p>
<p>topic and I&rsquo;m just looking at the shit like for what and what can I do more</p>
<p>because this is not fulfilling for me anymore. You know, I want to start doing</p>
<p>some cool shit. If you see me doing a headstand and like climbing buildings</p>
<p>and shit like spider-man, mind your business. That&rsquo;s my new goal for my body</p>
<p>now. Be able to do flips and like handstands and shit. Maybe I should get</p>
<p>into training to like fight. Like fair fight because I can street fight. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I don&rsquo;t like fair fighting because it&rsquo;s too many fucking rules bitch. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I don&rsquo;t like MMA or like boxing or anything like kickboxing and shit. Like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun and all to train but like girl I don&rsquo;t know how to fucking fight with</p>
<p>all these goddamn rules. I&rsquo;m not thinking of that. Like when I&rsquo;m in the zone to</p>
<p>fuck somebody&rsquo;s shit up, I ain&rsquo;t- I&rsquo;m not gonna be like having my adrenaline going</p>
<p>and trying to go through the rulebook in my fucking head of how I can and can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hit you. Bitch I&rsquo;m just gonna hit you. You trying to hit me? Now I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>rambling at this point. So that&rsquo;s all I got for this episode about social media.</p>
<p>I hope you guys liked it. Leave this show a 5 star rating if you don&rsquo;t mind. I</p>
<p>appreciate it a whole bunch. And send me on Instagram topics or things you want</p>
<p>me to discuss on a podcast or shit you just want to hear my hot take of. Like DM</p>
<p>me. Feel free. Let&rsquo;s talk. And I do really want you guys&rsquo;s opinions because I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>talking about topics that I think are helpful and things that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>about certain things. So I want to know what everybody else wants to hear about</p>
<p>too. Also if you&rsquo;re gonna send me a hate message or something rude, I will be rude</p>
<p>back. Okay? Be constructive. Be nice with your criticisms. Okay? I&rsquo;m open to that.</p>
<p>Alright let me go before I keep running my mouth and fucking get in trouble. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>talk to you guys next Sunday. On Jesus&rsquo;s day.</p>
