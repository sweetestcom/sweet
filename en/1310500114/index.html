    <p>The following is a conversation with Russ Tedrick,</p>
<p>a roboticist and professor at MIT</p>
<p>and vice president of robotics research</p>
<p>at Toyota Research Institute or TRI.</p>
<p>He works on control of robots in interesting,</p>
<p>complicated, underactuated, stochastic,</p>
<p>difficult to model situations.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great teacher and a great person,</p>
<p>one of my favorites at MIT.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into a lot of topics in this conversation</p>
<p>from his time leading MIT&rsquo;s Delta Robotics Challenge team</p>
<p>to the awesome fact that he often runs</p>
<p>close to a marathon a day to and from work barefoot.</p>
<p>For a world class roboticist interested in elegant,</p>
<p>efficient control of underactuated dynamical systems</p>
<p>like the human body, this fact makes Russ</p>
<p>one of the most fascinating people I know.</p>

<p>Have you ever watched The Office?</p>
<p>If you have, you probably know it&rsquo;s based</p>
<p>on a UK series also called The Office.</p>
<p>Not to stir up trouble, but I personally think</p>
<p>the British version is actually more brilliant</p>
<p>than the American one, but both are amazing.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are actually nine other countries</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Russ Tedrick.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful motion</p>
<p>of an animal or robot that you&rsquo;ve ever seen?</p>
<p>I think the most beautiful motion of a robot</p>
<p>has to be the passive dynamic walkers.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just something fundamentally beautiful.</p>
<p>The ones in particular that Steve Collins built</p>
<p>with Andy Ruina at Cornell, a 3D walking machine.</p>
<p>So it was not confined to a boom or a plane</p>
<p>that you put it on top of a small ramp,</p>
<p>give it a little push, it&rsquo;s powered only by gravity.</p>
<p>No controllers, no batteries whatsoever.</p>
<p>It just falls down the ramp.</p>
<p>And at the time it looked more natural, more graceful,</p>
<p>more human like than any robot we&rsquo;d seen to date</p>
<p>powered only by gravity.</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>Well, okay, the simplest model, it&rsquo;s kind of like a slinky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an elaborate slinky.</p>
<p>One of the simplest models we used to think about it</p>
<p>is actually a rimless wheel.</p>
<p>So imagine taking a bicycle wheel, but take the rim off.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s now just got a bunch of spokes.</p>
<p>If you give that a push,</p>
<p>it still wants to roll down the ramp,</p>
<p>but every time its foot, its spoke comes around</p>
<p>and hits the ground, it loses a little energy.</p>
<p>Every time it takes a step forward,</p>
<p>it gains a little energy.</p>
<p>Those things can come into perfect balance.</p>
<p>And actually they want to, it&rsquo;s a stable phenomenon.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going too slow, it&rsquo;ll speed up.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going too fast, it&rsquo;ll slow down</p>
<p>and it comes into a stable periodic motion.</p>
<p>Now you can take that rimless wheel,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t look very much like a human walking,</p>
<p>take all the extra spokes away, put a hinge in the middle.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s two legs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called our compass gait walker.</p>
<p>That can still, you give it a little push,</p>
<p>it starts falling down a ramp.</p>
<p>It looks a little bit more like walking.</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s a biped.</p>
<p>But what Steve and Andy,</p>
<p>and Tad McGeer started the whole exercise,</p>
<p>but what Steve and Andy did was they took it</p>
<p>to this beautiful conclusion</p>
<p>where they built something that had knees, arms, a torso.</p>
<p>The arms swung naturally, give it a little push.</p>
<p>And that looked like a stroll through the park.</p>
<p>How do you design something like that?</p>
<p>I mean, is that art or science?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the boundary.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a science to getting close to the solution.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s certainly art in the way</p>
<p>that they made a beautiful robot.</p>
<p>But then the finesse, because they were working</p>
<p>with a system that wasn&rsquo;t perfectly modeled,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t perfectly controlled,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these little tricks</p>
<p>that you have to tune the suction cups at the knees,</p>
<p>for instance, so that they stick,</p>
<p>but then they release at just the right time.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s all these little tricks of the trade,</p>
<p>which really are art, but it was a point.</p>
<p>I mean, it made the point.</p>
<p>We were, at that time, the walking robot,</p>
<p>the best walking robot in the world was Honda&rsquo;s Asmo.</p>
<p>Absolutely marvel of modern engineering.</p>
<p>Is this 90s?</p>
<p>This was in 97 when they first released.</p>
<p>It sort of announced P2, and then it went through.</p>
<p>It was Asmo by then in 2004.</p>
<p>And it looks like this very cautious walking,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re walking on hot coals or something like that.</p>
<p>I think it gets a bad rap.</p>
<p>Asmo is a beautiful machine.</p>
<p>It does walk with its knees bent.</p>
<p>Our Atlas walking had its knees bent.</p>
<p>But actually, Asmo was pretty fantastic.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t energy efficient.</p>
<p>Neither was Atlas when we worked on Atlas.</p>
<p>None of our robots that have been that complicated</p>
<p>have been very energy efficient.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a thing that happens when you do control,</p>
<p>when you try to control a system of that complexity.</p>
<p>You try to use your motors to basically counteract gravity.</p>
<p>Take whatever the world&rsquo;s doing to you and push back,</p>
<p>erase the dynamics of the world,</p>
<p>and impose the dynamics you want</p>
<p>because you can make them simple and analyzable,</p>
<p>mathematically simple.</p>
<p>And this was a very sort of beautiful example</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>You can just let go.</p>
<p>Let physics do most of the work, right?</p>
<p>And you just have to give it a little bit of energy.</p>
<p>This one only walked down a ramp.</p>
<p>It would never walk on the flat.</p>
<p>To walk on the flat,</p>
<p>you have to give a little energy at some point.</p>
<p>But maybe instead of trying to take the forces imparted</p>
<p>to you by the world and replacing them,</p>
<p>what we should be doing is letting the world push us around</p>
<p>and we go with the flow.</p>
<p>Very zen, very zen robot.</p>
<p>Yeah, but okay, so that sounds very zen,</p>
<p>but I can also imagine how many like failed versions</p>
<p>they had to go through.</p>
<p>Like how many, like, I would say it&rsquo;s probably,</p>
<p>would you say it&rsquo;s in the thousands</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve had to have the system fall down</p>
<p>before they figured out how to get it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s thousands, but it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It takes some patience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>So in that sense, control might help a little bit.</p>
<p>Oh, I think everybody, even at the time,</p>
<p>said that the answer is to do with that with control.</p>
<p>But it was just pointing out</p>
<p>that maybe the way we&rsquo;re doing control right now</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the way we should.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So what about on the animal side,</p>
<p>the ones that figured out how to move efficiently?</p>
<p>Is there anything you find inspiring or beautiful</p>
<p>in the movement of any particular animal?</p>
<p>I do have a favorite example.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it sort of goes with the passive walking idea.</p>
<p>So is there, you know, how energy efficient are animals?</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a great series of experiments</p>
<p>by George Lauder at Harvard and Mike Tranofilo at MIT.</p>
<p>They were studying fish swimming in a water tunnel.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And one of these, the type of fish they were studying</p>
<p>were these rainbow trout,</p>
<p>because there was a phenomenon well understood</p>
<p>that rainbow trout, when they&rsquo;re swimming upstream</p>
<p>in mating season, they kind of hang out behind the rocks.</p>
<p>And it looks like, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tiring work swimming upstream.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hanging out behind the rocks.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something energetically interesting there.</p>
<p>So they tried to recreate that.</p>
<p>They put in this water tunnel, a rock basically,</p>
<p>a cylinder that had the same sort of vortex street,</p>
<p>the eddies coming off the back of the rock</p>
<p>that you would see in a stream.</p>
<p>And they put a real fish behind this</p>
<p>and watched how it swims.</p>
<p>And the amazing thing is that if you watch from above</p>
<p>what the fish swims when it&rsquo;s not behind a rock,</p>
<p>it has a particular gate.</p>
<p>You can identify the fish the same way you look</p>
<p>at a human walking down the street.</p>
<p>You sort of have a sense of how a human walks.</p>
<p>The fish has a characteristic gate.</p>
<p>You put that fish behind the rock, its gate changes.</p>
<p>And what they saw was that it was actually resonating</p>
<p>and kind of surfing between the vortices.</p>
<p>Now, here was the experiment that really was the clincher.</p>
<p>Because there was still, it wasn&rsquo;t clear how much of that</p>
<p>was mechanics of the fish,</p>
<p>how much of that is control, the brain.</p>
<p>So the clincher experiment,</p>
<p>and maybe one of my favorites to date,</p>
<p>although there are many good experiments.</p>
<p>They took, this was now a dead fish.</p>
<p>They took a dead fish.</p>
<p>They put a string that went,</p>
<p>that tied the mouth of the fish to the rock</p>
<p>so it couldn&rsquo;t go back and get caught in the grates.</p>
<p>And then they asked what would that dead fish do</p>
<p>when it was hanging out behind the rock?</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;d expect, it sort of flopped around</p>
<p>like a dead fish in the vortex wake</p>
<p>until something sort of amazing happens.</p>
<p>And this video is worth putting in, right?</p>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>The dead fish basically starts swimming upstream, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely dead, no brain, no motors, no control.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s somehow the mechanics of the fish</p>
<p>resonate with the vortex street</p>
<p>and it starts swimming upstream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the best examples ever.</p>
<p>Who do you give credit for that to?</p>
<p>Is that just evolution constantly just figuring out</p>
<p>by killing a lot of generations of animals,</p>
<p>like the most efficient motion?</p>
<p>Is that, or maybe the physics of our world completely like,</p>
<p>is like if evolution applied not only to animals,</p>
<p>but just the entirety of it somehow drives to efficiency,</p>
<p>like nature likes efficiency?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that question even makes any sense.</p>
<p>I understand the question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s reasonable.</p>
<p>I mean, do they co evolve?</p>
<p>Yeah, somehow co, yeah.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t know if an environment can evolve, but.</p>
<p>I mean, there are experiments that people do,</p>
<p>careful experiments that show that animals can adapt</p>
<p>to unusual situations and recover efficiency.</p>
<p>So there seems like at least in one direction,</p>
<p>I think there is reason to believe</p>
<p>that the animal&rsquo;s motor system and probably its mechanics</p>
<p>adapt in order to be more efficient.</p>
<p>But efficiency isn&rsquo;t the only goal, of course.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s too easy to think about only efficiency,</p>
<p>but we have to do a lot of other things first, not get eaten.</p>
<p>And then all other things being equal, try to save energy.</p>
<p>By the way, let&rsquo;s draw a distinction</p>
<p>between control and mechanics.</p>
<p>Like how would you define each?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think part of the point is that</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t draw a line as clearly as we tend to.</p>
<p>But on a robot, we have motors</p>
<p>and we have the links of the robot, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>If the motors are turned off,</p>
<p>the robot has some passive dynamics, okay?</p>
<p>Gravity does the work.</p>
<p>You can put springs, I would call that mechanics, right?</p>
<p>If we have springs and dampers,</p>
<p>which our muscles are springs and dampers and tendons.</p>
<p>But then you have something that&rsquo;s doing active work,</p>
<p>putting energy in, which are your motors on the robot.</p>
<p>The controller&rsquo;s job is to send commands to the motor</p>
<p>that add new energy into the system, right?</p>
<p>So the mechanics and control interplay somewhere,</p>
<p>the divide is around, you know,</p>
<p>did you decide to send some commands to your motor</p>
<p>or did you just leave the motors off,</p>
<p>let them do their work?</p>
<p>Would you say is most of nature</p>
<p>on the dynamic side or the control side?</p>
<p>So like, if you look at biological systems,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living in a pandemic now,</p>
<p>like, do you think a virus is a,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s a dynamic system</p>
<p>or is there a lot of control, intelligence?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s both, but I think we maybe have underestimated</p>
<p>how important the dynamics are, right?</p>
<p>I mean, even our bodies, the mechanics of our bodies,</p>
<p>certainly with exercise, they evolve.</p>
<p>But so I actually, I lost a finger in early 2000s</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s my fifth metacarpal.</p>
<p>And it turns out you use that a lot</p>
<p>in ways you don&rsquo;t expect when you&rsquo;re opening jars,</p>
<p>even when I&rsquo;m just walking around,</p>
<p>if I bump it on something, there&rsquo;s a bone there</p>
<p>that was used to taking contact.</p>
<p>My fourth metacarpal wasn&rsquo;t used to taking contact,</p>
<p>it used to hurt, it still does a little bit.</p>
<p>But actually my bone has remodeled, right?</p>
<p>Over a couple of years, the geometry,</p>
<p>the mechanics of that bone changed</p>
<p>to address the new circumstances.</p>
<p>So the idea that somehow it&rsquo;s only our brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s adapting or evolving is not right.</p>
<p>Maybe sticking on evolution for a bit,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s tended to create some interesting things.</p>
<p>Bipedal walking, why the heck did evolution give us,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re, are we the only mammals that walk on two feet?</p>
<p>No, I mean, there&rsquo;s a bunch of animals that do it a bit.</p>
<p>A bit.</p>
<p>I think we are the most successful bipeds.</p>
<p>I think I read somewhere that the reason</p>
<p>the evolution made us walk on two feet</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s an advantage</p>
<p>to being able to carry food back to the tribe</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So like you can carry, it&rsquo;s kind of this communal,</p>
<p>cooperative thing, so like to carry stuff back</p>
<p>to a place of shelter and so on to share with others.</p>
<p>Do you understand at all the value of walking on two feet</p>
<p>from both a robotics and a human perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, there are some great books written</p>
<p>about evolution of, walking evolution of the human body.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easy though to make bad evolutionary arguments.</p>
<p>Sure, most of them are probably bad,</p>
<p>but what else can we do?</p>
<p>I mean, I think a lot of what dominated our evolution</p>
<p>probably was not the things that worked well</p>
<p>sort of in the steady state, you know,</p>
<p>when things are good, but for instance,</p>
<p>people talk about what we should eat now</p>
<p>because our ancestors were meat eaters or whatever.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I love that, yeah.</p>
<p>But probably, you know, the reason</p>
<p>that one pre Homo sapiens species versus another survived</p>
<p>was not because of whether they ate well</p>
<p>when there was lots of food.</p>
<p>But when the ice age came, you know,</p>
<p>probably one of them happened to be in the wrong place.</p>
<p>One of them happened to forage a food that was okay</p>
<p>even when the glaciers came or something like that, I mean.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million variables that contributed</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t, and our, actually the amount of information</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working with and telling these stories,</p>
<p>these evolutionary stories is very little.</p>
<p>So yeah, just like you said, it seems like,</p>
<p>if you study history, it seems like history turns</p>
<p>on like these little events that otherwise</p>
<p>would seem meaningless, but in a grant,</p>
<p>like when you, in retrospect, were turning points.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably how like somebody got hit in the head</p>
<p>with a rock because somebody slept with the wrong person</p>
<p>back in the cave days and somebody get angry</p>
<p>and that turned, you know, warring tribes</p>
<p>combined with the environment, all those millions of things</p>
<p>and the meat eating, which I get a lot of criticism</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know what your dietary processes are like,</p>
<p>but these days I&rsquo;ve been eating only meat,</p>
<p>which is, there&rsquo;s a large community of people who say,</p>
<p>yeah, probably make evolutionary arguments</p>
<p>and say you&rsquo;re doing a great job.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably an even larger community of people,</p>
<p>including my mom, who says it&rsquo;s deeply unhealthy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wrong, but I just feel good doing it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, these evolutionary arguments</p>
<p>can be flawed, but is there anything interesting</p>
<p>to pull out for?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great book, by the way,</p>
<p>well, a series of books by Nicholas Taleb</p>
<p>about Fooled by Randomness and Black Swan.</p>
<p>Highly recommend them, but yeah,</p>
<p>they make the point nicely that probably</p>
<p>it was a few random events that, yes,</p>
<p>maybe it was someone getting hit by a rock, as you say.</p>
<p>That said, do you think, I don&rsquo;t know how to ask this</p>
<p>question or how to talk about this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something elegant and beautiful</p>
<p>about moving on two feet, obviously biased</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m human, but from a robotics perspective, too,</p>
<p>you work with robots on two feet,</p>
<p>is it all useful to build robots that are on two feet</p>
<p>as opposed to four?</p>
<p>Is there something useful about it?</p>
<p>I think the most, I mean, the reason I spent a long time</p>
<p>working on bipedal walking was because it was hard</p>
<p>and it challenged control theory in ways</p>
<p>that I thought were important.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have ever tried to convince you</p>
<p>that you should start a company around bipeds</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>There are people that make pretty compelling arguments.</p>
<p>I think the most compelling one is that the world</p>
<p>is built for the human form, and if you want a robot</p>
<p>to work in the world we have today,</p>
<p>then having a human form is a pretty good way to go.</p>
<p>There are places that a biped can go that would be hard</p>
<p>for other form factors to go, even natural places,</p>
<p>but at some point in the long run,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be building our environments for our robots, probably,</p>
<p>and so maybe that argument falls aside.</p>
<p>So you famously run barefoot.</p>
<p>Do you still run barefoot?</p>
<p>I still run barefoot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so awesome.</p>
<p>Much to my wife&rsquo;s chagrin.</p>
<p>Do you want to make an evolutionary argument</p>
<p>for why running barefoot is advantageous?</p>
<p>What have you learned about human and robot movement</p>
<p>in general from running barefoot?</p>
<p>Human or robot and or?</p>
<p>Well, you know, it happened the other way, right?</p>
<p>So I was studying walking robots,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a great conference called</p>
<p>the Dynamic Walking Conference where it brings together</p>
<p>both the biomechanics community</p>
<p>and the walking robots community.</p>
<p>And so I had been going to this for years</p>
<p>and hearing talks by people who study barefoot running</p>
<p>and other, the mechanics of running.</p>
<p>So I did eventually read Born to Run.</p>
<p>Most people read Born to Run in the first, right?</p>
<p>The other thing I had going for me is actually</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t a runner before,</p>
<p>and I learned to run after I had learned</p>
<p>about barefoot running, or I mean,</p>
<p>started running longer distances.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t have to unlearn.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m definitely, I&rsquo;m a big fan of it for me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to,</p>
<p>I tend to not try to convince other people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who run beautifully with shoes on,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s why it makes sense for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the longterm game, right?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just too easy to run 10 miles,</p>
<p>feel pretty good, and then you get home at night</p>
<p>and you realize my knees hurt.</p>
<p>I did something wrong, right?</p>
<p>If you take your shoes off,</p>
<p>then if you hit hard with your foot at all,</p>
<p>then it hurts.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like run 10 miles</p>
<p>and then realize you&rsquo;ve done some damage.</p>
<p>You have immediate feedback telling you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve done something that&rsquo;s maybe suboptimal,</p>
<p>and you change your gait.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s even subconscious.</p>
<p>If I, right now, having run many miles barefoot,</p>
<p>if I put a shoe on, my gait changes</p>
<p>in a way that I think is not as good.</p>
<p>So it makes me land softer.</p>
<p>And I think my goals for running</p>
<p>are to do it for as long as I can into old age,</p>
<p>not to win any races.</p>
<p>And so for me, this is a way to protect myself.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, first of all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried running barefoot many years ago,</p>
<p>probably the other way,</p>
<p>just reading Born to Run.</p>
<p>But just to understand,</p>
<p>because I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t put in the miles</p>
<p>that I wanted to.</p>
<p>And it feels like running for me,</p>
<p>and I think for a lot of people,</p>
<p>was one of those activities that we do often</p>
<p>and we never really try to learn to do correctly.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s funny, there&rsquo;s so many activities</p>
<p>we do every day, like brushing our teeth, right?</p>
<p>I think a lot of us, at least me,</p>
<p>probably have never deeply studied</p>
<p>how to properly brush my teeth, right?</p>
<p>Or wash, as now with the pandemic,</p>
<p>or how to properly wash our hands.</p>
<p>We do it every day, but we haven&rsquo;t really studied,</p>
<p>like, am I doing this correctly?</p>
<p>But running felt like one of those things,</p>
<p>it was absurd not to study how to do correctly,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the source of so much pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Like, I hate running, but I do it.</p>
<p>I do it because I hate it, but I feel good afterwards.</p>
<p>But I think it feels like you need</p>
<p>to learn how to do it properly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where barefoot running came in,</p>
<p>and then I quickly realized that my gait</p>
<p>was completely wrong.</p>
<p>I was taking huge steps,</p>
<p>and landing hard on the heel, all those elements.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, from that I actually learned</p>
<p>to take really small steps, look.</p>
<p>I already forgot the number,</p>
<p>but I feel like it was 180 a minute or something like that.</p>
<p>And I remember I actually just took songs</p>
<p>that are 180 beats per minute,</p>
<p>and then like tried to run at that beat,</p>
<p>and just to teach myself.</p>
<p>It took a long time, and I feel like after a while,</p>
<p>you learn to run, you adjust properly,</p>
<p>without going all the way to barefoot.</p>
<p>But I feel like barefoot is the legit way to do it.</p>
<p>I mean, I think a lot of people</p>
<p>would be really curious about it.</p>
<p>Can you, if they&rsquo;re interested in trying,</p>
<p>what would you, how would you recommend</p>
<p>they start, or try, or explore?</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest thing people do,</p>
<p>is they are excellent runners,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re used to running long distances,</p>
<p>or running fast, and they take their shoes off,</p>
<p>and they hurt themselves instantly trying to do</p>
<p>something that they were used to doing.</p>
<p>I think I lucked out in the sense</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t run very far when I first started trying.</p>
<p>And I run with minimal shoes too.</p>
<p>I mean, I will bring along a pair of,</p>
<p>actually, like aqua socks or something like this,</p>
<p>I can just slip on, or running sandals,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried all of them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a minimal shoe</p>
<p>and nothing at all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, like, feeling wise, what does it feel like?</p>
<p>There is a, I mean, I notice my gait changing, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, your foot has as many muscles</p>
<p>and sensors as your hand does, right?</p>
<p>Sensors, ooh, okay.</p>
<p>And we do amazing things with our hands.</p>
<p>And we stick our foot in a big, solid shoe, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, I think, you know, when you&rsquo;re barefoot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just giving yourself more proprioception.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re more aware of some of the gait flaws</p>
<p>and stuff like this.</p>
<p>Now, you have less protection too, so.</p>
<p>Rocks and stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, so I think people who are afraid</p>
<p>of barefoot running are worried about getting cuts</p>
<p>or stepping on rocks.</p>
<p>First of all, even if that was a concern,</p>
<p>I think those are all, like, very short term.</p>
<p>You know, if I get a scratch or something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll heal in a week.</p>
<p>If I blow out my knees, I&rsquo;m done running forever.</p>
<p>So I will trade the short term for the long term anytime.</p>
<p>But even then, you know, and this, again,</p>
<p>to my wife&rsquo;s chagrin, your feet get tough, right?</p>
<p>And, yeah, I can run over almost anything now.</p>
<p>I mean, what, can you talk about,</p>
<p>is there, like, is there tips or tricks</p>
<p>that you have, suggestions about,</p>
<p>like, if I wanted to try it?</p>
<p>You know, there is a good book, actually.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably more good books since I read them.</p>
<p>But Ken Bob, Barefoot Ken Bob Saxton.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an interesting guy.</p>
<p>But I think his book captures the right way</p>
<p>to describe running, barefoot running,</p>
<p>to somebody better than any other I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>So you run pretty good distances, and you bike,</p>
<p>and is there, you know, if we talk about bucket list items,</p>
<p>is there something crazy on your bucket list,</p>
<p>athletically, that you hope to do one day?</p>
<p>I mean, my commute is already a little crazy.</p>
<p>What are we talking about here?</p>
<p>What distance are we talking about?</p>
<p>Well, I live about 12 miles from MIT,</p>
<p>but you can find lots of different ways to get there.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I&rsquo;ve run there for many years, I&rsquo;ve biked there.</p>
<p>Old ways?</p>
<p>Yeah, but normally I would try to run in</p>
<p>and then bike home, bike in, run home.</p>
<p>But you have run there and back before?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Barefoot?</p>
<p>Yeah, or with minimal shoes or whatever that.</p>
<p>12, 12 times two?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It became kind of a game of how can I get to work?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve rollerbladed, I&rsquo;ve done all kinds of weird stuff,</p>
<p>but my favorite one these days,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking the Charles River to work.</p>
<p>So, I can put in the rowboat not so far from my house,</p>
<p>but the Charles River takes a long way to get to MIT,</p>
<p>so I can spend a long time getting there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not about, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s just about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people ask me,</p>
<p>how can you justify taking that time?</p>
<p>But for me, it&rsquo;s just a magical time to think,</p>
<p>to compress, decompress.</p>
<p>Especially, I&rsquo;ll wake up, do a lot of work in the morning,</p>
<p>and then I kind of have to just let that settle</p>
<p>before I&rsquo;m ready for all my meetings.</p>
<p>And then on the way home, it&rsquo;s a great time to sort of</p>
<p>let that settle.</p>
<p>You lead a large group of people.</p>
<p>Is there days where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh shit, I gotta get to work in an hour?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, is there a tension there?</p>
<p>And like, if we look at the grand scheme of things,</p>
<p>just like you said, long term,</p>
<p>that meeting probably doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Like, you can always say, I&rsquo;ll just, I&rsquo;ll run</p>
<p>and let the meeting happen, how it happens.</p>
<p>Like, what, how do you, that zen, how do you,</p>
<p>what do you do with that tension</p>
<p>between the real world saying urgently,</p>
<p>you need to be there, this is important,</p>
<p>everything is melting down,</p>
<p>how are we gonna fix this robot?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this critical meeting,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s this, the zen beauty of just running,</p>
<p>the simplicity of it, you along with nature.</p>
<p>What do you do with that?</p>
<p>I would say I&rsquo;m not a fast runner, particularly.</p>
<p>Probably my fastest splits ever was when</p>
<p>I had to get to daycare on time</p>
<p>because they were gonna charge me, you know,</p>
<p>some dollar per minute that I was late.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve run some fast splits to daycare.</p>
<p>But those times are past now.</p>
<p>I think work, you can find a work life balance in that way.</p>
<p>I think you just have to.</p>
<p>I think I am better at work</p>
<p>because I take time to think on the way in.</p>
<p>So I plan my day around it,</p>
<p>and I rarely feel that those are really at odds.</p>
<p>So what, the bucket list item.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking 12 times two, or approaching a marathon,</p>
<p>what, have you run an ultra marathon before?</p>
<p>Do you do races?</p>
<p>Is there, what&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Not to win.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna like take a dinghy across the Atlantic</p>
<p>or something if that&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>But if someone does and wants to write a book,</p>
<p>I would totally read it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a sucker for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>No, I do have some fun things that I will try.</p>
<p>You know, I like to, when I travel,</p>
<p>I almost always bike to Logan Airport</p>
<p>and fold up a little folding bike</p>
<p>and then take it with me and bike to wherever I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s taken me,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll take a stand up paddle board these days</p>
<p>on the airplane,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll try to paddle around where I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done some crazy things, but&hellip;</p>
<p>But not for the, you know, I now talk,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who David Goggins is by any chance.</p>
<p>Not well, but yeah.</p>
<p>But I talk to him now every day.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the person who made me do this stupid challenge.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s insane and he does things for the purpose</p>
<p>in the best kind of way.</p>
<p>He does things like for the explicit purpose of suffering.</p>
<p>Like he picks the thing that,</p>
<p>like whatever he thinks he can do, he does more.</p>
<p>So is that, do you have that thing in you or are you&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s become the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like that dynamical system</p>
<p>that the walker, the efficient&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s leave no pain, right?</p>
<p>You should end feeling better than you started.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s mostly, I think, and COVID has tested this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve lost my commute.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m perfectly happy walking around town</p>
<p>with my wife and kids if they could get them to go.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more about just getting outside</p>
<p>and getting away from the keyboard for some time</p>
<p>just to let things compress.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go into robotics a little bit.</p>
<p>What to use the most beautiful idea in robotics?</p>
<p>Whether we&rsquo;re talking about control</p>
<p>or whether we&rsquo;re talking about optimization</p>
<p>and the math side of things or the engineering side of things</p>
<p>or the philosophical side of things.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been lucky to experience something</p>
<p>that not so many roboticists have experienced,</p>
<p>which is to hang out</p>
<p>with some really amazing control theorists.</p>
<p>And the clarity of thought</p>
<p>that some of the more mathematical control theory</p>
<p>can bring to even very complex, messy looking problems</p>
<p>is really, it really had a big impact on me</p>
<p>and I had a day even just a couple of weeks ago</p>
<p>where I had spent the day on a Zoom robotics conference</p>
<p>having great conversations with lots of people.</p>
<p>Felt really good about the ideas</p>
<p>that were flowing and the like.</p>
<p>And then I had a late afternoon meeting</p>
<p>with one of my favorite control theorists</p>
<p>and we went from these abstract discussions</p>
<p>about maybes and what ifs and what a great idea</p>
<p>to these super precise statements</p>
<p>about systems that aren&rsquo;t that much more simple</p>
<p>or abstract than the ones I care about deeply.</p>
<p>And the contrast of that is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it really gets me.</p>
<p>I think people underestimate</p>
<p>maybe the power of clear thinking.</p>
<p>And so for instance, deep learning is amazing.</p>
<p>I use it heavily in our work.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s changed the world, unquestionable.</p>
<p>It makes it easy to get things to work</p>
<p>without thinking as critically about it.</p>
<p>So I think one of the challenges as an educator</p>
<p>is to think about how do we make sure people get a taste</p>
<p>of the more rigorous thinking</p>
<p>that I think goes along with some different approaches.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So understanding like the fundamentals,</p>
<p>the first principles of the problem,</p>
<p>where in this case it&rsquo;s mechanics,</p>
<p>like how a thing moves, how a thing behaves,</p>
<p>like all the forces involved,</p>
<p>like really getting a deep understanding of that.</p>
<p>I mean, from physics, the first principle thing</p>
<p>come from physics, and here it&rsquo;s literally physics.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this applies, in deep learning,</p>
<p>this applies to not just, I mean,</p>
<p>it applies so cleanly in robotics,</p>
<p>but it also applies to just in any data set.</p>
<p>I find this true, I mean, driving as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of folks in that work on autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>that work on autonomous vehicles that don&rsquo;t study driving,</p>
<p>like deeply.</p>
<p>I might be coming a little bit from the psychology side,</p>
<p>but I remember I spent a ridiculous number of hours</p>
<p>at lunch, at this like lawn chair,</p>
<p>and I would sit somewhere in MIT&rsquo;s campus,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few interesting intersections,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d just watch people cross.</p>
<p>So we were studying pedestrian behavior,</p>
<p>and I felt like, as we record a lot of video,</p>
<p>to try, and then there&rsquo;s the computer vision</p>
<p>extracts their movement, how they move their head, and so on,</p>
<p>but like every time, I felt like I didn&rsquo;t understand enough.</p>
<p>I just, I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t understanding</p>
<p>what, how are people signaling to each other,</p>
<p>what are they thinking,</p>
<p>how cognizant are they of their fear of death?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the underlying game theory here?</p>
<p>What are the incentives?</p>
<p>And then I finally found a live stream of an intersection</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like high def that I just, I would watch</p>
<p>so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to sit out there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting, so like, I feel.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s tough, that&rsquo;s a tough example,</p>
<p>because I mean, the learning.</p>
<p>Humans are involved.</p>
<p>Not just because human, but I think the learning mantra</p>
<p>is that basically the statistics of the data</p>
<p>will tell me things I need to know, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, for the example you gave</p>
<p>of all the nuances of, you know, eye contact,</p>
<p>or hand gestures, or whatever that are happening</p>
<p>for these subtle interactions</p>
<p>between pedestrians and traffic, right?</p>
<p>Maybe the data will tell that story.</p>
<p>I maybe even, one level more meta than what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>For a particular problem,</p>
<p>I think it might be the case</p>
<p>that data should tell us the story.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a rigorous thinking</p>
<p>that is just an essential skill</p>
<p>for a mathematician or an engineer</p>
<p>that I just don&rsquo;t wanna lose it.</p>
<p>There are certainly super rigorous control,</p>
<p>or sorry, machine learning people.</p>
<p>I just think deep learning makes it so easy</p>
<p>to do some things that our next generation,</p>
<p>are not immediately rewarded</p>
<p>for going through some of the more rigorous approaches.</p>
<p>And then I wonder where that takes us.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m actually optimistic about it.</p>
<p>I just want to do my part</p>
<p>to try to steer that rigorous thinking.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like two questions I wanna ask.</p>
<p>Do you have sort of a good example of rigorous thinking</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s easy to get lazy and not do the rigorous thinking?</p>
<p>And the other question I have is like,</p>
<p>do you have advice of how to practice rigorous thinking</p>
<p>in all the computer science disciplines that we&rsquo;ve mentioned?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there are times where problems</p>
<p>that can be solved with well known mature methods</p>
<p>could also be solved with a deep learning approach.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an argument that you must use learning</p>
<p>even for the parts we already think we know,</p>
<p>because if the human has touched it,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve biased the system</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve suddenly put a bottleneck in there</p>
<p>that is your own mental model.</p>
<p>But something like converting a matrix,</p>
<p>I think we know how to do that pretty well,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a pretty big matrix,</p>
<p>and we understand that pretty well.</p>
<p>And you could train a deep network to do it,</p>
<p>but you shouldn&rsquo;t probably.</p>
<p>So in that sense, rigorous thinking is understanding</p>
<p>the scope and the limitations of the methods that we have,</p>
<p>like how to use the tools of mathematics properly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think taking a class on analysis</p>
<p>is all I&rsquo;m sort of arguing is to take a chance to stop</p>
<p>and force yourself to think rigorously</p>
<p>about even the rational numbers or something.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the end all problem.</p>
<p>But that exercise of clear thinking,</p>
<p>I think goes a long way,</p>
<p>and I just wanna make sure we keep preaching it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t lose it.</p>
<p>But do you think when you&rsquo;re doing rigorous thinking</p>
<p>or maybe trying to write down equations</p>
<p>or sort of explicitly formally describe a system,</p>
<p>do you think we naturally simplify things too much?</p>
<p>Is that a danger you run into?</p>
<p>Like in order to be able to understand something</p>
<p>about the system mathematically,</p>
<p>we make it too much of a toy example.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s the good stuff, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you understand the fundamentals?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think maybe even that&rsquo;s a key to intelligence</p>
<p>or something, but I mean, okay,</p>
<p>what if Newton and Galileo had deep learning?</p>
<p>And they had done a bunch of experiments</p>
<p>and they told the world,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s your weights of your neural network.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve solved the problem.</p>
<p>Where would we be today?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be as far as we are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said</p>
<p>about having the simplest explanation for a phenomenon.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t doubt that we can train neural networks</p>
<p>to predict even physical F equals MA type equations.</p>
<p>But I maybe, I want another Newton to come along</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s more to do</p>
<p>in terms of coming up with the simple models</p>
<p>for more complicated tasks.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s not offend AI systems from 50 years</p>
<p>from now that are listening to this</p>
<p>that are probably better at,</p>
<p>might be better coming up</p>
<p>with F equals MA equations themselves.</p>
<p>So sorry, I actually think learning is probably a route</p>
<p>to achieving this, but the representation matters, right?</p>
<p>And I think having a function that takes my inputs</p>
<p>to outputs that is arbitrarily complex</p>
<p>may not be the end goal.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s still the most simple</p>
<p>or parsimonious explanation for the data.</p>
<p>Simple doesn&rsquo;t mean low dimensional.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing I think that we&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>a lesson that we&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>So a standard way to do model reduction</p>
<p>or system identification and controls</p>
<p>is the typical formulation is that you try to find</p>
<p>the minimal state dimension realization of a system</p>
<p>that hits some error bounds or something like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s maybe not, I think we&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>that state dimension is not the right metric.</p>
<p>Of complexity.</p>
<p>But for me, I think a lot about contact,</p>
<p>the mechanics of contact,</p>
<p>if a robot hand is picking up an object or something.</p>
<p>And when I write down the equations of motion for that,</p>
<p>they look incredibly complex,</p>
<p>not because, actually not so much</p>
<p>because of the dynamics of the hand when it&rsquo;s moving,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the interactions</p>
<p>and when they turn on and off, right?</p>
<p>So having a high dimensional,</p>
<p>but simple description of what&rsquo;s happening out here is fine.</p>
<p>But if when I actually start touching,</p>
<p>if I write down a different dynamical system</p>
<p>for every polygon on my robot hand</p>
<p>and every polygon on the object,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in contact or not,</p>
<p>with all the combinatorics that explodes there,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s too complex.</p>
<p>So I need to somehow summarize that</p>
<p>with a more intuitive physics way of thinking.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;m very optimistic</p>
<p>that machine learning will get us there.</p>
<p>First of all, I mean, I&rsquo;ll probably do it</p>
<p>in the introduction,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re one of the great robotics people at MIT.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a professor at MIT.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve teach him a lot of amazing courses.</p>
<p>You run a large group</p>
<p>and you have a important history for MIT, I think,</p>
<p>as being a part of the DARPA Robotics Challenge.</p>
<p>Can you maybe first say,</p>
<p>what is the DARPA Robotics Challenge</p>
<p>and then tell your story around it, your journey with it?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>So the DARPA Robotics Challenge,</p>
<p>it came on the tails of the DARPA Grand Challenge</p>
<p>and DARPA Urban Challenge,</p>
<p>which were the challenges that brought us,</p>
<p>put a spotlight on self driving cars.</p>
<p>Gil Pratt was at DARPA and pitched a new challenge</p>
<p>that involved disaster response.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t explicitly require humanoids,</p>
<p>although humanoids came into the picture.</p>
<p>This happened shortly after the Fukushima disaster in Japan</p>
<p>and our challenge was motivated roughly by that</p>
<p>because that was a case where if we had had robots</p>
<p>that were ready to be sent in,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a chance that we could have averted disaster.</p>
<p>And certainly after the, in the disaster response,</p>
<p>there were times we would have loved</p>
<p>to have sent robots in.</p>
<p>So in practice, what we ended up with was a grand challenge,</p>
<p>a DARPA Robotics Challenge,</p>
<p>where Boston Dynamics was to make humanoid robots.</p>
<p>People like me and the amazing team at MIT</p>
<p>were competing first in a simulation challenge</p>
<p>to try to be one of the ones that wins the right</p>
<p>to work on one of the Boston Dynamics humanoids</p>
<p>in order to compete in the final challenge,</p>
<p>which was a physical challenge.</p>
<p>And at that point, it was already, so it was decided</p>
<p>as humanoid robots early on.</p>
<p>There were two tracks.</p>
<p>You could enter as a hardware team</p>
<p>where you brought your own robot,</p>
<p>or you could enter through the virtual robotics challenge</p>
<p>as a software team that would try to win the right</p>
<p>to use one of the Boston Dynamics robots.</p>
<p>Sure, called Atlas.</p>
<p>Atlas.</p>
<p>Humanoid robots.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a 400 pound Marvel,</p>
<p>but a pretty big, scary looking robot.</p>
<p>Expensive too.</p>
<p>Expensive, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so I mean, how did you feel</p>
<p>at the prospect of this kind of challenge?</p>
<p>I mean, it seems autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>yeah, I guess that sounds hard,</p>
<p>but not really from a robotics perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, didn&rsquo;t they do it in the 80s</p>
<p>is the kind of feeling I would have,</p>
<p>like when you first look at the problem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on wheels, but like humanoid robots,</p>
<p>that sounds really hard.</p>
<p>So what are your, psychologically speaking,</p>
<p>what were you feeling, excited, scared?</p>
<p>Why the heck did you get yourself involved</p>
<p>in this kind of messy challenge?</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really know for sure what we were signing up for</p>
<p>in the sense that you could have something that,</p>
<p>as it was described in the call for participation,</p>
<p>that could have put a huge emphasis on the dynamics</p>
<p>of walking and not falling down</p>
<p>and walking over rough terrain,</p>
<p>or the same description,</p>
<p>because the robot had to go into this disaster area</p>
<p>and turn valves and pick up a drill,</p>
<p>it cut the hole through a wall,</p>
<p>it had to do some interesting things.</p>
<p>The challenge could have really highlighted perception</p>
<p>and autonomous planning,</p>
<p>or it ended up that locomoting over complex terrain</p>
<p>played a pretty big role in the competition.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>And the degree of autonomy wasn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>The degree of autonomy</p>
<p>was always a central part of the discussion.</p>
<p>So what wasn&rsquo;t clear was how we would be able,</p>
<p>how far we&rsquo;d be able to get with it.</p>
<p>So the idea was always that you want semi autonomy,</p>
<p>that you want the robot to have enough compute</p>
<p>that you can have a degraded network link to a human.</p>
<p>And so the same way we had degraded networks</p>
<p>at many natural disasters,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d send your robot in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be able to get a few bits back and forth,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t get to have enough</p>
<p>potentially to fully operate the robot</p>
<p>in every joint of the robot.</p>
<p>So, and then the question was,</p>
<p>and the gamesmanship of the organizers</p>
<p>was to figure out what we&rsquo;re capable of,</p>
<p>push us as far as we could,</p>
<p>so that it would differentiate the teams</p>
<p>that put more autonomy on the robot</p>
<p>and had a few clicks and just said,</p>
<p>go there, do this, go there, do this,</p>
<p>versus someone who&rsquo;s picking every footstep</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So what were some memories,</p>
<p>painful, triumphant from the experience?</p>
<p>Like what was that journey?</p>
<p>Maybe if you can dig in a little deeper,</p>
<p>maybe even on the technical side, on the team side,</p>
<p>that whole process of,</p>
<p>from the early idea stages to actually competing.</p>
<p>I mean, this was a defining experience for me.</p>
<p>It came at the right time for me in my career.</p>
<p>I had gotten tenure before I was due a sabbatical,</p>
<p>and most people do something relaxing</p>
<p>and restorative for a sabbatical.</p>
<p>So you got tenure before this?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It was a good time for me.</p>
<p>We had a bunch of algorithms that we were very happy with.</p>
<p>We wanted to see how far we could push them,</p>
<p>and this was a chance to really test our mettle</p>
<p>to do more proper software engineering.</p>
<p>So the team, we all just worked our butts off.</p>
<p>We were in that lab almost all the time.</p>
<p>Okay, so there were some, of course,</p>
<p>high highs and low lows throughout that.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re not sleeping</p>
<p>and devoting your life to a 400 pound humanoid.</p>
<p>I remember actually one funny moment</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re all super tired,</p>
<p>and so Atlas had to walk across cinder blocks.</p>
<p>That was one of the obstacles.</p>
<p>And I remember Atlas was powered down</p>
<p>and hanging limp on its harness,</p>
<p>and the humans were there picking up</p>
<p>and laying the brick down</p>
<p>so that the robot could walk over it.</p>
<p>And I thought, what is wrong with this?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a robot just watching us</p>
<p>do all the manual labor</p>
<p>so that it can take its little stroll across the train.</p>
<p>But I mean, even the virtual robotics challenge</p>
<p>was super nerve wracking and dramatic.</p>
<p>I remember, so we were using Gazebo as a simulator</p>
<p>on the cloud,</p>
<p>and there was all these interesting challenges.</p>
<p>I think the investment that OSR FC,</p>
<p>whatever they were called at that time,</p>
<p>Brian Gerkey&rsquo;s team at Open Source Robotics,</p>
<p>they were pushing on the capabilities of Gazebo</p>
<p>in order to scale it to the complexity of these challenges.</p>
<p>So, you know, up to the virtual competition.</p>
<p>So the virtual competition was,</p>
<p>you will sign on at a certain time</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have a network connection</p>
<p>to another machine on the cloud</p>
<p>that is running the simulator of your robot.</p>
<p>And your controller will run on this computer</p>
<p>and the physics will run on the other</p>
<p>and you have to connect.</p>
<p>Now, the physics, they wanted it to run at real time rates</p>
<p>because there was an element of human interaction.</p>
<p>And humans, if you do want to teleop,</p>
<p>it works way better if it&rsquo;s at frame rate.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>But it was very hard to simulate</p>
<p>these complex scenes at real time rate.</p>
<p>So right up to like days before the competition,</p>
<p>the simulator wasn&rsquo;t quite at real time rate.</p>
<p>And that was great for me because my controller</p>
<p>was solving a pretty big optimization problem</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t quite at real time rate.</p>
<p>So I was fine.</p>
<p>I was keeping up with the simulator.</p>
<p>We were both running at about 0.7.</p>
<p>And I remember getting this email.</p>
<p>And by the way, the perception folks on our team hated</p>
<p>that they knew that if my controller was too slow,</p>
<p>the robot was gonna fall down.</p>
<p>And no matter how good their perception system was,</p>
<p>if I can&rsquo;t make my controller fast.</p>
<p>Anyways, we get this email</p>
<p>like three days before the virtual competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for all the marbles.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna either get a humanoid robot or we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And we get an email saying,</p>
<p>good news, we made the robot, the simulator faster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now at one point.</p>
<p>And I was just like, oh man, what are we gonna do here?</p>
<p>So that came in late at night for me.</p>
<p>A few days ahead.</p>
<p>I went over, it happened at Frank Permenter,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a very, very sharp.</p>
<p>He was a student at the time working on optimization.</p>
<p>He was still in lab.</p>
<p>Frank, we need to make the quadratic programming solver</p>
<p>faster, not like a little faster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, you know, and we wrote a new solver</p>
<p>for that QP together that night.</p>
<p>It was terrifying.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a really hard optimization problem</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re constantly solving.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t make the optimization problem simpler?</p>
<p>You wrote a new solver?</p>
<p>So, I mean, your observation is almost spot on.</p>
<p>What we did was what everybody,</p>
<p>I mean, people know how to do this,</p>
<p>but we had not yet done this idea of warm starting.</p>
<p>So we are solving a big optimization problem</p>
<p>at every time step.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re running fast enough,</p>
<p>the optimization problem you&rsquo;re solving</p>
<p>on the last time step is pretty similar</p>
<p>to the optimization you&rsquo;re gonna solve with the next.</p>
<p>We had course had told our commercial solver</p>
<p>to use warm starting, but even the interface</p>
<p>to that commercial solver was causing us these delays.</p>
<p>So what we did was we basically wrote,</p>
<p>we called it fast QP at the time.</p>
<p>We wrote a very lightweight, very fast layer,</p>
<p>which would basically check if nearby solutions</p>
<p>to the quadratic program were,</p>
<p>which were very easily checked,</p>
<p>could stabilize the robot.</p>
<p>And if they couldn&rsquo;t, we would fall back to the solver.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t really test this well, right?</p>
<p>Or like?</p>
<p>I mean, so we always knew that if we fell back to,</p>
<p>if we, it got to the point where if for some reason</p>
<p>things slowed down and we fell back to the original solver,</p>
<p>the robot would actually literally fall down.</p>
<p>So it was a harrowing sort of edge we were,</p>
<p>ledge we were sort of on.</p>
<p>But I mean, it actually,</p>
<p>like the 400 pound human could come crashing to the ground</p>
<p>if your solver&rsquo;s not fast enough.</p>
<p>But you know, we had lots of good experiences.</p>
<p>So can I ask you a weird question I get</p>
<p>about idea of hard work?</p>
<p>So actually people, like students of yours</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve interacted with and just,</p>
<p>and robotics people in general,</p>
<p>but they have moments,</p>
<p>at moments have worked harder than most people I know</p>
<p>in terms of, if you look at different disciplines</p>
<p>of how hard people work.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re also like the happiest.</p>
<p>Like, just like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with like running.</p>
<p>People that push themselves to like the limit,</p>
<p>they also seem to be like the most like full of life</p>
<p>somehow.</p>
<p>And I get often criticized like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting enough sleep.</p>
<p>What are you doing to your body?</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah, like this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I usually just kind of respond like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing what I love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m passionate about it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s invigorating.</p>
<p>I actually think, I don&rsquo;t think the lack of sleep</p>
<p>is what hurts you.</p>
<p>I think what hurts you is stress and lack of doing things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>But in this world, yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>can you comment about why the heck robotics people</p>
<p>are willing to push themselves to that degree?</p>
<p>Is there value in that?</p>
<p>And why are they so happy?</p>
<p>I think, I think you got it right.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the causality is not that we work hard.</p>
<p>And I think other disciplines work very hard too,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that we work hard</p>
<p>and therefore we are happy.</p>
<p>I think we found something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re truly passionate about.</p>
<p>It makes us very happy.</p>
<p>And then we get a little involved with it</p>
<p>and spend a lot of time on it.</p>
<p>What a luxury to have something</p>
<p>that you wanna spend all your time on, right?</p>
<p>We could talk about this for many hours,</p>
<p>but maybe if we could pick,</p>
<p>is there something on the technical side</p>
<p>on the approach that you took that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that turned out to be a terrible failure</p>
<p>or a success that you carry into your work today</p>
<p>about all the different ideas that were involved</p>
<p>in making, whether in the simulation or in the real world,</p>
<p>making this semi autonomous system work?</p>
<p>I mean, it really did teach me something fundamental</p>
<p>about what it&rsquo;s gonna take to get robustness</p>
<p>out of a system of this complexity.</p>
<p>I would say the DARPA challenge</p>
<p>really was foundational in my thinking.</p>
<p>I think the autonomous driving community thinks about this.</p>
<p>I think lots of people thinking</p>
<p>about safety critical systems</p>
<p>that might have machine learning in the loop</p>
<p>are thinking about these questions.</p>
<p>For me, the DARPA challenge was the moment</p>
<p>where I realized we&rsquo;ve spent every waking minute</p>
<p>running this robot.</p>
<p>And again, for the physical competition,</p>
<p>days before the competition,</p>
<p>we saw the robot fall down in a way</p>
<p>it had never fallen down before.</p>
<p>I thought, how could we have found that?</p>
<p>We only have one robot, it&rsquo;s running almost all the time.</p>
<p>We just didn&rsquo;t have enough hours in the day</p>
<p>to test that robot.</p>
<p>Something has to change, right?</p>
<p>And then I think that, I mean,</p>
<p>I would say that the team that won was,</p>
<p>from KAIST, was the team that had two robots</p>
<p>and was able to do not only incredible engineering,</p>
<p>just absolutely top rate engineering,</p>
<p>but also they were able to test at a rate</p>
<p>and discipline that we didn&rsquo;t keep up with.</p>
<p>What does testing look like?</p>
<p>What are we talking about here?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s a loop of tests?</p>
<p>Like from start to finish, what is a loop of testing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a whole philosophy to testing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the unit tests, and you can do that on a hardware,</p>
<p>you can do that in a small piece of code.</p>
<p>You write one function, you should write a test</p>
<p>that checks that function&rsquo;s input and outputs.</p>
<p>You should also write an integration test</p>
<p>at the other extreme of running the whole system together,</p>
<p>where they try to turn on all of the different functions</p>
<p>that you think are correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much harder to write the specifications</p>
<p>for a system level test,</p>
<p>especially if that system is as complicated</p>
<p>as a humanoid robot.</p>
<p>But the philosophy is sort of the same.</p>
<p>On the real robot, it&rsquo;s no different,</p>
<p>but on a real robot,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to run the same experiment twice.</p>
<p>So if you see a failure,</p>
<p>you hope you caught something in the logs</p>
<p>that tell you what happened,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d probably never be able to run</p>
<p>exactly that experiment again.</p>
<p>And right now, I think our philosophy is just,</p>
<p>basically Monte Carlo estimation,</p>
<p>is just run as many experiments as we can,</p>
<p>maybe try to set up the environment</p>
<p>to make the things we are worried about happen</p>
<p>as often as possible.</p>
<p>But really we&rsquo;re relying on somewhat random search</p>
<p>in order to test.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ll ever be able to,</p>
<p>but I think, you know,</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s an argument that the things that&rsquo;ll get you</p>
<p>are the things that are really nuanced in the world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;d be very hard to, for instance,</p>
<p>put back in a simulation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess the edge cases.</p>
<p>What was the hardest thing?</p>
<p>Like, so you said walking over rough terrain,</p>
<p>like just taking footsteps.</p>
<p>I mean, people, it&rsquo;s so dramatic and painful</p>
<p>in a certain kind of way to watch these videos</p>
<p>from the DRC of robots falling.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because for me at least,</p>
<p>we anthropomorphize the robot.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s also funny for some reason,</p>
<p>like humans falling is funny for, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some dark reason.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why it is so,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also like tragic and painful.</p>
<p>And so speaking of which, I mean,</p>
<p>what made the robots fall and fail in your view?</p>
<p>So I can tell you exactly what happened on our,</p>
<p>we, I contributed one of those.</p>
<p>Our team contributed one of those spectacular falls.</p>
<p>Every one of those falls has a complicated story.</p>
<p>I mean, at one time,</p>
<p>the power effectively went out on the robot</p>
<p>because it had been sitting at the door</p>
<p>waiting for a green light to be able to proceed</p>
<p>and its batteries, you know,</p>
<p>and therefore it just fell backwards</p>
<p>and smashed its head against the ground.</p>
<p>And it was hilarious,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t because of bad software, right?</p>
<p>But for ours, so the hardest part of the challenge,</p>
<p>the hardest task in my view was getting out of the Polaris.</p>
<p>It was actually relatively easy to drive the Polaris.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story?</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>The story of the car.</p>
<p>People should watch this video.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing you&rsquo;ve come up with is just brilliant,</p>
<p>but anyway, sorry, what&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, we kind of joke.</p>
<p>We call it the big robot, little car problem</p>
<p>because somehow the race organizers decided</p>
<p>to give us a 400 pound humanoid.</p>
<p>And then they also provided the vehicle,</p>
<p>which was a little Polaris.</p>
<p>And the robot didn&rsquo;t really fit in the car.</p>
<p>So you couldn&rsquo;t drive the car with your feet</p>
<p>under the steering column.</p>
<p>We actually had to straddle the main column of the,</p>
<p>and have basically one foot in the passenger seat,</p>
<p>one foot in the driver&rsquo;s seat,</p>
<p>and then drive with our left hand.</p>
<p>But the hard part was we had to then park the car,</p>
<p>get out of the car.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have a door, that was okay.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just getting up from crouched, from sitting,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in this very constrained environment.</p>
<p>First of all, I remember after watching those videos,</p>
<p>I was much more cognizant of how hard it is for me</p>
<p>to get in and out of the car,</p>
<p>and out of the car, especially.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a really difficult control problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very cognizant of it when I&rsquo;m like injured</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how did you approach this problem?</p>
<p>So we had, you think of NASA&rsquo;s operations,</p>
<p>and they have these checklists,</p>
<p>prelaunched checklists and the like.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t far off from that.</p>
<p>We had this big checklist.</p>
<p>And on the first day of the competition,</p>
<p>we were running down our checklist.</p>
<p>And one of the things we had to do,</p>
<p>we had to turn off the controller,</p>
<p>the piece of software that was running</p>
<p>that would drive the left foot of the robot</p>
<p>in order to accelerate on the gas.</p>
<p>And then we turned on our balancing controller.</p>
<p>And the nerves, jitters of the first day of the competition,</p>
<p>someone forgot to check that box</p>
<p>and turn that controller off.</p>
<p>So we used a lot of motion planning</p>
<p>to figure out a sort of configuration of the robot</p>
<p>that we could get up and over.</p>
<p>We relied heavily on our balancing controller.</p>
<p>And basically, when the robot was in one</p>
<p>of its most precarious sort of configurations,</p>
<p>trying to sneak its big leg out of the side,</p>
<p>the other controller that thought it was still driving</p>
<p>told its left foot to go like this.</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>But it turned disastrous for us</p>
<p>because what happened was a little bit of push here.</p>
<p>Actually, we have videos of us running into the robot</p>
<p>with a 10 foot pole and it kind of will recover.</p>
<p>But this is a case where there&rsquo;s no space to recover.</p>
<p>So a lot of our secondary balancing mechanisms</p>
<p>about like take a step to recover,</p>
<p>they were all disabled because we were in the car</p>
<p>and there was no place to step.</p>
<p>So we were relying on our just lowest level reflexes.</p>
<p>And even then, I think just hitting the foot on the seat,</p>
<p>on the floor, we probably could have recovered from it.</p>
<p>But the thing that was bad that happened</p>
<p>is when we did that and we jostled a little bit,</p>
<p>the tailbone of our robot was only a little off the seat,</p>
<p>it hit the seat.</p>
<p>And the other foot came off the ground just a little bit.</p>
<p>And nothing in our plans had ever told us what to do</p>
<p>if your butt&rsquo;s on the seat and your feet are in the air.</p>
<p>Feet in the air.</p>
<p>And then the thing is once you get off the script,</p>
<p>things can go very wrong</p>
<p>because even our state estimation,</p>
<p>our system that was trying to collect all the data</p>
<p>from the sensors and understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening with the robot,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t know about this situation.</p>
<p>So it was predicting things that were just wrong.</p>
<p>And then we did a violent shake and fell off</p>
<p>in our face first out of the robot.</p>
<p>But like into the destination.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, we fell in, we got our point for egress.</p>
<p>But so is there any hope for, that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>is there any hope for Atlas to be able to do something</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s just on its butt and feet in the air?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So you can, what do you?</p>
<p>No, so that is one of the big challenges.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s still true, you know,</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics and Antimal and there&rsquo;s this incredible work</p>
<p>on legged robots happening around the world.</p>
<p>Most of them still are very good at the case</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re making contact with the world at your feet.</p>
<p>And they have typically point feet relatively,</p>
<p>they have balls on their feet, for instance.</p>
<p>If those robots get in a situation</p>
<p>where the elbow hits the wall or something like this,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pretty different situation.</p>
<p>Now they have layers of mechanisms that will make,</p>
<p>I think the more mature solutions have ways</p>
<p>in which the controller won&rsquo;t do stupid things.</p>
<p>But a human, for instance, is able to leverage</p>
<p>incidental contact in order to accomplish a goal.</p>
<p>In fact, I might, if you push me,</p>
<p>I might actually put my hand out</p>
<p>and make a new brand new contact.</p>
<p>The feet of the robot are doing this on quadrupeds,</p>
<p>but we mostly in robotics are afraid of contact</p>
<p>on the rest of our body, which is crazy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole field of motion planning,</p>
<p>collision free motion planning.</p>
<p>And we write very complex algorithms</p>
<p>so that the robot can dance around</p>
<p>and make sure it doesn&rsquo;t touch the world.</p>
<p>So people are just afraid of contact</p>
<p>because contact the scene is a difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a difficult control problem and sensing problem.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re a serious person, I&rsquo;m a little bit of an idiot</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to ask you some dumb questions.</p>
<p>So I do martial arts.</p>
<p>So like jiu jitsu, I wrestled my whole life.</p>
<p>So let me ask the question, like whenever people learn</p>
<p>that I do any kind of AI or like I mentioned robots</p>
<p>and things like that, they say,</p>
<p>when are we going to have robots that can win</p>
<p>in a wrestling match or in a fight against a human?</p>
<p>So we just mentioned sitting on your butt,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the air, that&rsquo;s a common position.</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu, when you&rsquo;re on the ground,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a down opponent.</p>
<p>Like how difficult do you think is the problem?</p>
<p>And when will we have a robot that can defeat a human</p>
<p>in a wrestling match?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about a lot, like, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re familiar with wrestling, but essentially.</p>
<p>Not very.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the art of contact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re picking contact points</p>
<p>and then using like leverage like to off balance</p>
<p>to trick people, like you make them feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re doing one thing</p>
<p>and then they change their balance</p>
<p>and then you switch what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and then results in a throw or whatever.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s basically the art of multiple contacts.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Awesome, that&rsquo;s a nice description of it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also an opponent in there, right?</p>
<p>So if.</p>
<p>Very dynamic.</p>
<p>Right, if you are wrestling a human</p>
<p>and are in a game theoretic situation with a human,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still hard, but just to speak to the, you know,</p>
<p>quickly reasoning about contact part of it, for instance.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe even throwing the game theory out of it,</p>
<p>almost like, yeah, almost like a non dynamic opponent.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s reasons to be optimistic,</p>
<p>but I think our best understanding of those problems</p>
<p>are still pretty hard.</p>
<p>I have been increasingly focused on manipulation,</p>
<p>partly where that&rsquo;s a case where the contact</p>
<p>has to be much more rich.</p>
<p>And there are some really impressive examples</p>
<p>of deep learning policies, controllers</p>
<p>that can appear to do good things through contact.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve even got new examples of, you know,</p>
<p>deep learning models of predicting what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>to objects as they go through contact.</p>
<p>But I think the challenge you just offered there</p>
<p>still eludes us, right?</p>
<p>The ability to make a decision</p>
<p>based on those models quickly.</p>
<p>You know, I have to think though, it&rsquo;s hard for humans too,</p>
<p>when you get that complicated.</p>
<p>I think probably you had maybe a slow motion version</p>
<p>of where you learned the basic skills</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve probably gotten better at it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s much more subtle to you.</p>
<p>But it might still be hard to actually, you know,</p>
<p>really on the fly take a, you know, model of your humanoid</p>
<p>and figure out how to plan the optimal sequence.</p>
<p>That might be a problem we never solve.</p>
<p>Well, the, I mean, one of the most amazing things to me</p>
<p>about the, we can talk about martial arts.</p>
<p>We could also talk about dancing.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Too human, I think it&rsquo;s the most interesting study</p>
<p>of contact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even the dynamic element of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, like when you get good at it, it&rsquo;s so effortless.</p>
<p>Like I can just, I&rsquo;m very cognizant</p>
<p>of the entirety of the learning process</p>
<p>being essentially like learning how to move my body</p>
<p>in a way that I could throw very large weights</p>
<p>around effortlessly, like, and I can feel the learning.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a huge believer in drilling of techniques</p>
<p>and you can just like feel your, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not feeling, you&rsquo;re feeling, sorry,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re learning it intellectually a little bit,</p>
<p>but a lot of it is the body learning it somehow,</p>
<p>like instinctually and whatever that learning is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really, I&rsquo;m not even sure if that&rsquo;s equivalent</p>
<p>to like a deep learning, learning a controller.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s something more,</p>
<p>it feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of distributed learning</p>
<p>going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s hierarchy and composition</p>
<p>probably in the systems that we don&rsquo;t capture very well yet.</p>
<p>You have layers of control systems.</p>
<p>You have reflexes at the bottom layer</p>
<p>and you have a system that&rsquo;s capable</p>
<p>of planning a vacation to some distant country,</p>
<p>which is probably, you probably don&rsquo;t have a controller,</p>
<p>a policy for every possible destination you&rsquo;ll ever pick.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something magical in the in between</p>
<p>and how do you go from these low level feedback loops</p>
<p>to something that feels like a pretty complex</p>
<p>set of outcomes.</p>
<p>You know, my guess is, I think there&rsquo;s evidence</p>
<p>that you can plan at some of these levels, right?</p>
<p>So Josh Tenenbaum just showed it in his talk the other day.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a game he likes to talk about.</p>
<p>I think he calls it the pick three game or something,</p>
<p>where he puts a bunch of clutter down in front of a person</p>
<p>and he says, okay, pick three objects.</p>
<p>And it might be a telephone or a shoe</p>
<p>or a Kleenex box or whatever.</p>
<p>And apparently you pick three items and then you pick,</p>
<p>he says, okay, pick the first one up with your right hand,</p>
<p>the second one up with your left hand.</p>
<p>Now using those objects, now as tools,</p>
<p>pick up the third object.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s down at the level of physics</p>
<p>and mechanics and contact mechanics</p>
<p>that I think we do learning or we do have policies for,</p>
<p>we do control for, almost feedback,</p>
<p>but somehow we&rsquo;re able to still,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never picked up a telephone</p>
<p>with a shoe and a water bottle before.</p>
<p>And somehow, and it takes me a little longer to do that</p>
<p>the first time, but most of the time</p>
<p>we can sort of figure that out.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think the amazing thing is this ability</p>
<p>to be flexible with our models,</p>
<p>plan when we need to use our well oiled controllers</p>
<p>when we don&rsquo;t, when we&rsquo;re in familiar territory.</p>
<p>Having models, I think the other thing you just said</p>
<p>was something about, I think your awareness</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening is even changing</p>
<p>as you improve your expertise, right?</p>
<p>So maybe you have a very approximate model</p>
<p>of the mechanics to begin with.</p>
<p>And as you gain expertise,</p>
<p>you get a more refined version of that model.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re aware of muscles or balance components</p>
<p>that you just weren&rsquo;t even aware of before.</p>
<p>So how do you scaffold that?</p>
<p>Yeah, plus the fear of injury,</p>
<p>the ambition of goals, of excelling,</p>
<p>and fear of mortality.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, what else is in there?</p>
<p>As the motivations, overinflated ego in the beginning,</p>
<p>and then a crash of confidence in the middle.</p>
<p>All of those seem to be essential for the learning process.</p>
<p>And if all that&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re probably optimizing energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, so we have to get that right.</p>
<p>So there was this idea that you would have robots</p>
<p>play soccer better than human players by 2050.</p>
<p>That was the goal.</p>
<p>Basically, it was the goal to beat world champion team,</p>
<p>to become a world cup, beat like a world cup level team.</p>
<p>So are we gonna see that first?</p>
<p>Or a robot, if you&rsquo;re familiar,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an organization called UFC for mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>Are we gonna see a world cup championship soccer team</p>
<p>that have robots, or a UFC champion mixed martial artist</p>
<p>as a robot?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very hard to say one thing is harder,</p>
<p>some problem is harder than the other.</p>
<p>What probably matters is who started the organization that,</p>
<p>I mean, I think RoboCup has a pretty serious following,</p>
<p>and there is a history now of people playing that game,</p>
<p>learning about that game, building robots to play that game,</p>
<p>building increasingly more human robots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got momentum.</p>
<p>So if you want to have mixed martial arts compete,</p>
<p>you better start your organization now, right?</p>
<p>I think almost independent of which problem</p>
<p>is technically harder,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re both hard and they&rsquo;re both different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>I mean, those videos are just hilarious,</p>
<p>like especially the humanoid robots</p>
<p>trying to play soccer.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re kind of terrible right now.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess there is robo sumo wrestling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like the robo one competitions,</p>
<p>where they do have these robots that go on the table</p>
<p>and basically fight.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, maybe.</p>
<p>First of all, do you have a year in mind for RoboCup,</p>
<p>just from a robotics perspective?</p>
<p>Seems like a super exciting possibility</p>
<p>that like in the physical space,</p>
<p>this is what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think the world is captivated.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>It inspires just a huge number of people</p>
<p>when a machine beats a human at a game</p>
<p>that humans are really damn good at.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about chess and go,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s in the world of digital.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think machines have beat humans</p>
<p>at a game in the physical space yet,</p>
<p>but that would be just.</p>
<p>You have to make the rules very carefully, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if Atlas kicked me in the shins, I&rsquo;m down</p>
<p>and game over.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very subtle on what&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>I think the fighting one is a weird one.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you&rsquo;re talking about a machine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much stronger than you.</p>
<p>But yeah, in terms of soccer, basketball, all those kinds.</p>
<p>Even soccer, right?</p>
<p>I mean, as soon as there&rsquo;s contact or whatever,</p>
<p>and there are some things that the robot will do better.</p>
<p>I think if you really set yourself up to try to see</p>
<p>could robots win the game of soccer</p>
<p>as the rules were written, the right thing</p>
<p>for the robot to do is to play very differently</p>
<p>than a human would play.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get the perfect soccer player robot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get something that exploits the rules,</p>
<p>exploits its super actuators, its super low bandwidth</p>
<p>feedback loops or whatever, and it&rsquo;s gonna play the game</p>
<p>differently than you want it to play.</p>
<p>And I bet there&rsquo;s ways, I bet there&rsquo;s loopholes, right?</p>
<p>We saw that in the DARPA challenge that it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to write a set of rules that someone can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>a way to exploit.</p>
<p>Let me ask another ridiculous question.</p>
<p>I think this might be the last ridiculous question,</p>
<p>but I doubt it.</p>
<p>I aspire to ask as many ridiculous questions</p>
<p>of a brilliant MIT professor.</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen the black mirror.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, I never watched the episode.</p>
<p>I know when it happened though, because I gave a talk</p>
<p>to some MIT faculty one day on a unassuming Monday</p>
<p>or whatever I was telling him about the state of robotics.</p>
<p>And I showed some video from Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>of the quadruped spot at the time.</p>
<p>It was the early version of spot.</p>
<p>And there was a look of horror that went across the room.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;ve shown videos like this a lot of times,</p>
<p>what happened?</p>
<p>And it turns out that this video had gone,</p>
<p>this black mirror episode had changed</p>
<p>the way people watched the videos I was putting out.</p>
<p>The way they see these kinds of robots.</p>
<p>So I talked to so many people who are just terrified</p>
<p>because of that episode probably of these kinds of robots.</p>
<p>I almost wanna say that they almost enjoy being terrified.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what it is about human psychology</p>
<p>that kind of imagine doomsday,</p>
<p>the destruction of the universe or our society</p>
<p>and kind of like enjoy being afraid.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna simplify it, but it feels like</p>
<p>they talk about it so often.</p>
<p>It almost, there does seem to be an addictive quality to it.</p>
<p>I talked to a guy, a guy named Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s kind of the flag bearer</p>
<p>for being terrified at these robots.</p>
<p>Do you have two questions?</p>
<p>One, do you have an understanding</p>
<p>of why people are afraid of robots?</p>
<p>And the second question is in black mirror,</p>
<p>just to tell you the episode,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember it that much anymore,</p>
<p>but these robots, I think they can shoot</p>
<p>like a pellet or something.</p>
<p>They basically have, it&rsquo;s basically a spot with a gun.</p>
<p>And how far are we away from having robots</p>
<p>that go rogue like that?</p>
<p>Basically spot that goes rogue for some reason</p>
<p>and somehow finds a gun.</p>
<p>Right, so, I mean, I&rsquo;m not a psychologist.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know exactly why</p>
<p>people react the way they do.</p>
<p>I think we have to be careful about the way robots influence</p>
<p>our society and the like.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something, that&rsquo;s a responsibility</p>
<p>that roboticists need to embrace.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think robots are gonna come after me</p>
<p>with a kitchen knife or a pellet gun right away.</p>
<p>And I mean, if they were programmed in such a way,</p>
<p>but I used to joke with Atlas that all I had to do</p>
<p>was run for five minutes and its battery would run out.</p>
<p>But actually they&rsquo;ve got to be careful</p>
<p>and actually they&rsquo;ve got a very big battery</p>
<p>in there by the end.</p>
<p>So it was over an hour.</p>
<p>I think the fear is a bit cultural though.</p>
<p>Cause I mean, you notice that, like, I think in my age,</p>
<p>in the US, we grew up watching Terminator, right?</p>
<p>If I had grown up at the same time in Japan,</p>
<p>I probably would have been watching Astro Boy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very different reaction to robots</p>
<p>in different countries, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a human innate fear of metal marvels</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve done to ourselves</p>
<p>with our sci fi.</p>
<p>Yeah, the stories we tell ourselves through movies,</p>
<p>through just through popular media.</p>
<p>But if I were to tell, you know, if you were my therapist</p>
<p>and I said, I&rsquo;m really terrified that we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have these robots very soon that will hurt us.</p>
<p>Like, how do you approach making me feel better?</p>
<p>Like, why shouldn&rsquo;t people be afraid?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, I think there&rsquo;s a video</p>
<p>that went viral recently.</p>
<p>Everything, everything was spot in Boston,</p>
<p>which goes viral in general.</p>
<p>But usually it&rsquo;s like really cool stuff.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re doing flips and stuff</p>
<p>or like sad stuff, the Atlas being hit with a broomstick</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a video where I think one of the new productions</p>
<p>bought robots, which are awesome.</p>
<p>It was like patrolling somewhere in like in some country.</p>
<p>And like people immediately were like saying like,</p>
<p>this is like the dystopian future,</p>
<p>like the surveillance state.</p>
<p>For some reason, like you can just have a camera,</p>
<p>like something about spot being able to walk on four feet</p>
<p>with like really terrified people.</p>
<p>So like, what do you say to those people?</p>
<p>I think there is a legitimate fear there</p>
<p>because so much of our future is uncertain.</p>
<p>But at the same time, technically speaking,</p>
<p>it seems like we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>So what do you say?</p>
<p>I mean, I think technology is complicated.</p>
<p>It can be used in many ways.</p>
<p>I think there are purely software attacks</p>
<p>that somebody could use to do great damage.</p>
<p>Maybe they have already, you know,</p>
<p>I think wheeled robots could be used in bad ways too.</p>
<p>Drones.</p>
<p>Drones, right, I don&rsquo;t think that, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be building technology</p>
<p>just because I&rsquo;m compelled to build technology</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think about it.</p>
<p>But I would consider myself a technological optimist,</p>
<p>I guess, in the sense that I think we should continue</p>
<p>to create and evolve and our world will change.</p>
<p>And if we will introduce new challenges,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll screw something up maybe,</p>
<p>but I think also we&rsquo;ll invent ourselves</p>
<p>out of those challenges and life will go on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting because you didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>like this is technically too hard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think robots are, I think people attribute</p>
<p>a robot that looks like an animal</p>
<p>as maybe having a level of self awareness</p>
<p>or consciousness or something that they don&rsquo;t have yet.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s not, I think our ability</p>
<p>to anthropomorphize those robots is probably,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re assuming that they have a level of intelligence</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t yet have.</p>
<p>And that might be part of the fear.</p>
<p>So in that sense, it&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p>But, you know, there are many scary things in the world.</p>
<p>Right, so I think we&rsquo;re right to ask those questions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re right to think about the implications of our work.</p>
<p>Right, in the short term as we&rsquo;re working on it for sure,</p>
<p>is there something long term that scares you</p>
<p>about our future with AI and robots?</p>
<p>A lot of folks from Elon Musk to Sam Harris</p>
<p>to a lot of folks talk about the existential threats</p>
<p>about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, robots kind of inspire that the most</p>
<p>because of the anthropomorphism.</p>
<p>Do you have any fears?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important question.</p>
<p>I actually, I think I like Rod Brooks answer</p>
<p>maybe the best on this, I think.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the only answer he&rsquo;s given over the years,</p>
<p>but maybe one of my favorites is he says,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be, he&rsquo;s got a book,</p>
<p>Flesh and Machines, I believe, it&rsquo;s not gonna be</p>
<p>the robots versus the people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all gonna be robot people.</p>
<p>Because, you know, we already have smartphones,</p>
<p>some of us have serious technology implanted</p>
<p>in our bodies already, whether we have a hearing aid</p>
<p>or a pacemaker or anything like this,</p>
<p>people with amputations might have prosthetics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a trend I think that is likely to continue.</p>
<p>I mean, this is now wild speculation.</p>
<p>But I mean, when do we get to cognitive implants</p>
<p>and the like, and.</p>
<p>Yeah, with neural link, brain computer interfaces,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a dance between humans and robots</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be, it&rsquo;s going to be impossible</p>
<p>to be scared of the other out there, the robot,</p>
<p>because the robot will be part of us, essentially.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be so intricately sort of part of our society that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it might not even be implanted part of us,</p>
<p>but just, it&rsquo;s so much a part of our, yeah, our society.</p>
<p>So in that sense, the smartphone is already the robot</p>
<p>we should be afraid of, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, and all the usual fears arise</p>
<p>of the misinformation, the manipulation,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that,</p>
<p>the problems are all the same.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re human problems, essentially, it feels like.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think the way we interact</p>
<p>with each other online is changing the value we put on,</p>
<p>you know, personal interaction.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a crazy big change that&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>and rip through our, has already been ripping</p>
<p>through our society, right?</p>
<p>And that has implications that are massive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they should be scared of it</p>
<p>or go with the flow, but I don&rsquo;t see, you know,</p>
<p>some battle lines between humans and robots</p>
<p>being the first thing to worry about.</p>
<p>I mean, I do want to just, as a kind of comment,</p>
<p>maybe you can comment about your just feelings</p>
<p>about Boston Dynamics in general, but you know,</p>
<p>I love science, I love engineering,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s so many beautiful ideas in it.</p>
<p>And when I look at Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>or legged robots in general,</p>
<p>I think they inspire people, curiosity and feelings</p>
<p>in general, excitement about engineering</p>
<p>more than almost anything else in popular culture.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s such an exciting,</p>
<p>like responsibility and possibility for robotics.</p>
<p>And Boston Dynamics is riding that wave pretty damn well.</p>
<p>Like they found it, they&rsquo;ve discovered that hunger</p>
<p>and curiosity in the people and they&rsquo;re doing magic with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if the, I mean, I guess is that their company,</p>
<p>they have to make money, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re already doing incredible work</p>
<p>and inspiring the world about technology.</p>
<p>I mean, do you have thoughts about Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>and maybe others, your own work in robotics</p>
<p>and inspiring the world in that way?</p>
<p>I completely agree, I think Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>is absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>I think I show my kids those videos, you know,</p>
<p>and the best thing that happens is sometimes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already seen them, you know, right?</p>
<p>I think, I just think it&rsquo;s a pinnacle of success</p>
<p>in robotics that is just one of the best things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened, absolutely completely agree.</p>
<p>One of the heartbreaking things to me is how many</p>
<p>robotics companies fail, how hard it is to make money</p>
<p>with a robotics company.</p>
<p>Like iRobot like went through hell just to arrive</p>
<p>at a Roomba to figure out one product.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s so many home robotics companies</p>
<p>like Jibo and Anki, Anki, the cutest toy that&rsquo;s a great robot</p>
<p>I thought went down, I&rsquo;m forgetting a bunch of them,</p>
<p>but a bunch of robotics companies fail,</p>
<p>Rod&rsquo;s company, Rethink Robotics.</p>
<p>Like, do you have anything hopeful to say</p>
<p>about the possibility of making money with robots?</p>
<p>Oh, I think you can&rsquo;t just look at the failures.</p>
<p>I mean, Boston Dynamics is a success.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of companies that are still doing amazingly</p>
<p>good work in robotics.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the capitalist ecology or something, right?</p>
<p>I think you have many companies, you have many startups</p>
<p>and they push each other forward and many of them fail</p>
<p>and some of them get through and that&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>the natural way of those things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that is robotics really that much worse.</p>
<p>I feel the pain that you feel too.</p>
<p>Every time I read one of these, sometimes it&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>and I definitely wish it went better or went differently.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s healthy and good to have bursts of ideas,</p>
<p>bursts of activities, ideas, if they are really aggressive,</p>
<p>they should fail sometimes.</p>
<p>Certainly that&rsquo;s the research mantra, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re succeeding at every problem you attempt,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not choosing aggressively enough.</p>
<p>Is it exciting to you, the new spot?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>When are you getting them as a pet or it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I have to dig up 75K right now.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so cool that there&rsquo;s a price tag,</p>
<p>you can go and then actually buy it.</p>
<p>I have a Skydio R1, love it.</p>
<p>So no, I would absolutely be a customer.</p>
<p>I wonder what your kids would think about it.</p>
<p>I actually, Zach from Boston Dynamics would let my kid drive</p>
<p>in one of their demos one time.</p>
<p>And that was just so good, so good.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll forever be grateful for that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something magical about the anthropomorphization</p>
<p>of that arm, it adds another level of human connection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure we understand from a control aspect,</p>
<p>the value of anthropomorphization.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an understudied</p>
<p>and under understood engineering problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a, like psychologists have been studying it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s part like manipulating our mind</p>
<p>to believe things is a valuable engineering.</p>
<p>Like this is another degree of freedom</p>
<p>that can be controlled.</p>
<p>I like that, yeah, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something that humans seem to do</p>
<p>or maybe my dangerous introspection is,</p>
<p>I think we are able to make very simple models</p>
<p>that assume a lot about the world very quickly.</p>
<p>And then it takes us a lot more time, like you&rsquo;re wrestling.</p>
<p>You probably thought you knew what you were doing</p>
<p>with wrestling and you were fairly functional</p>
<p>as a complete wrestler.</p>
<p>And then you slowly got more expertise.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s natural that our first level of defense</p>
<p>against seeing a new robot is to think of it</p>
<p>in our existing models of how humans and animals behave.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, as you spend more time with it,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll develop more sophisticated models</p>
<p>that will appreciate the differences.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Can you say what does it take to control a robot?</p>
<p>Like what is the control problem of a robot?</p>
<p>And in general, what is a robot in your view?</p>
<p>Like how do you think of this system?</p>
<p>What is a robot?</p>
<p>I think robotics.</p>
<p>I told you ridiculous questions.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s standard definitions</p>
<p>of combining computation with some ability</p>
<p>to do mechanical work.</p>
<p>I think that gets us pretty close.</p>
<p>But I think robotics has this problem</p>
<p>that once things really work,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t call them robots anymore.</p>
<p>Like my dishwasher at home is pretty sophisticated,</p>
<p>beautiful mechanisms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a pretty good computer,</p>
<p>probably a couple of chips in there doing amazing things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think of that as a robot anymore,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t fair.</p>
<p>Because then what roughly it means</p>
<p>that robotics always has to solve the next problem</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t get to celebrate its past successes.</p>
<p>I mean, even factory room floor robots</p>
<p>are super successful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the ones,</p>
<p>I mean, people think of them as robots,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you ask what are the successes of robotics,</p>
<p>somehow it doesn&rsquo;t come to your mind immediately.</p>
<p>So the definition of robot is a system</p>
<p>with some level of automation that fails frequently.</p>
<p>Something like, it&rsquo;s the computation plus mechanical work</p>
<p>and an unsolved problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unsolved problem, yeah.</p>
<p>So from a perspective of control and mechanics,</p>
<p>dynamics, what is a robot?</p>
<p>So there are many different types of robots.</p>
<p>The control that you need for a Jibo robot,</p>
<p>you know, some robot that&rsquo;s sitting on your countertop</p>
<p>and interacting with you, but not touching you,</p>
<p>for instance, is very different than what you need</p>
<p>for an autonomous car or an autonomous drone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different than what you need for a robot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna walk or pick things up with its hands, right?</p>
<p>My passion has always been for the places</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re interacting more,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing more dynamic interactions with the world.</p>
<p>So walking, now manipulation.</p>
<p>And the control problems there are beautiful.</p>
<p>I think contact is one thing that differentiates them</p>
<p>from many of the control problems we&rsquo;ve solved classically,</p>
<p>right, like modern control grew up stabilizing fighter jets</p>
<p>that were passively unstable,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like amazing success stories from control</p>
<p>all over the place.</p>
<p>Power grid, I mean, there&rsquo;s all kinds of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everywhere that we don&rsquo;t even realize,</p>
<p>just like AI is now.</p>
<p>So you mentioned contact, like what&rsquo;s contact?</p>
<p>So an airplane is an extremely complex system</p>
<p>or a spacecraft landing or whatever,</p>
<p>but at least it has the luxury</p>
<p>of things change relatively continuously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an oversimplification.</p>
<p>But if I make a small change</p>
<p>in the command I send to my actuator,</p>
<p>then the path that the robot will take</p>
<p>tends to change only by a small amount.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a feedback mechanism here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>And thinking about this as locally,</p>
<p>like a linear system, for instance,</p>
<p>I can use more linear algebra tools</p>
<p>to study systems like that,</p>
<p>generalizations of linear algebra to these smooth systems.</p>
<p>What is contact?</p>
<p>The robot has something very discontinuous</p>
<p>that happens when it makes or breaks,</p>
<p>when it starts touching the world.</p>
<p>And even the way it touches or the order of contacts</p>
<p>can change the outcome in potentially unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>Not unpredictable, but complex ways.</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s a little bit of,</p>
<p>a lot of people will say that contact is hard in robotics,</p>
<p>even to simulate.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a little bit of a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s truth to that,</p>
<p>but maybe a misunderstanding around that.</p>
<p>So what is limiting is that when we think about our robots</p>
<p>and we write our simulators,</p>
<p>we often make an assumption that objects are rigid.</p>
<p>And when it comes down, that their mass moves all,</p>
<p>stays in a constant position relative to each other itself.</p>
<p>And that leads to some paradoxes</p>
<p>when you go to try to talk about</p>
<p>rigid body mechanics and contact.</p>
<p>And so for instance, if I have a three legged stool</p>
<p>with just imagine it comes to a point at the leg.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only touching the world at a point.</p>
<p>If I draw my physics,</p>
<p>my high school physics diagram of the system,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a couple of things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m given by elementary physics.</p>
<p>I know if the system, if the table is at rest,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not moving, zero velocities,</p>
<p>that means that the normal force,</p>
<p>all the forces are in balance.</p>
<p>So the force of gravity is being countered</p>
<p>by the forces that the ground is pushing on my table legs.</p>
<p>I also know since it&rsquo;s not rotating</p>
<p>that the moments have to balance.</p>
<p>And since it&rsquo;s a three dimensional table,</p>
<p>it could fall in any direction.</p>
<p>It actually tells me uniquely</p>
<p>what those three normal forces have to be.</p>
<p>If I have four legs on my table,</p>
<p>four legged table and they were perfectly machined</p>
<p>to be exactly the right same height</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re set down and the table&rsquo;s not moving,</p>
<p>then the basic conservation laws don&rsquo;t tell me,</p>
<p>there are many solutions for the forces</p>
<p>that the ground could be putting on my legs</p>
<p>that would still result in the table not moving.</p>
<p>Now, the reason that seems fine, I could just pick one.</p>
<p>But it gets funny now because if you think about friction,</p>
<p>what we think about with friction is our standard model</p>
<p>says the amount of force that the table will push back</p>
<p>if I were to now try to push my table sideways,</p>
<p>I guess I have a table here,</p>
<p>is proportional to the normal force.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m barely touching and I push, I&rsquo;ll slide,</p>
<p>but if I&rsquo;m pushing more and I push, I&rsquo;ll slide less.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called coulomb friction is our standard model.</p>
<p>Now, if you don&rsquo;t know what the normal force is</p>
<p>on the four legs and you push the table,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t know what the friction forces are gonna be.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t actually tell,</p>
<p>the laws just aren&rsquo;t explicit yet</p>
<p>about which way the table&rsquo;s gonna go.</p>
<p>It could veer off to the left,</p>
<p>it could veer off to the right, it could go straight.</p>
<p>So the rigid body assumption of contact</p>
<p>leaves us with some paradoxes,</p>
<p>which are annoying for writing simulators</p>
<p>and for writing controllers.</p>
<p>We still do that sometimes because soft contact</p>
<p>is potentially harder numerically or whatever,</p>
<p>and the best simulators do both</p>
<p>or do some combination of the two.</p>
<p>But anyways, because of these kinds of paradoxes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of paradoxes in contact,</p>
<p>mostly due to these rigid body assumptions.</p>
<p>It becomes very hard to write the same kind of control laws</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been able to be successful with</p>
<p>for fighter jets.</p>
<p>Like fighter jets, we haven&rsquo;t been as successful</p>
<p>writing those controllers for manipulation.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>at the point of contact, at the moment of contact.</p>
<p>There are situations absolutely</p>
<p>where our laws don&rsquo;t tell us.</p>
<p>So the standard approach, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I mean, instead of having a differential equation,</p>
<p>you end up with a differential inclusion, it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a set valued equation.</p>
<p>It says that I&rsquo;m in this configuration,</p>
<p>I have these forces applied on me.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a set of things that could happen, right?</p>
<p>And you can&hellip;</p>
<p>And those aren&rsquo;t continuous, I mean, what&hellip;</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re saying like non smooth,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not only not smooth, but this is discontinuous?</p>
<p>The non smooth comes in</p>
<p>when I make or break a new contact first,</p>
<p>or when I transition from stick to slip.</p>
<p>So you typically have static friction,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll start sliding,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;ll be a discontinuous change in philosophy.</p>
<p>In philosophy, for instance,</p>
<p>especially if you come to rest or&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>Okay, so what do you do?</p>
<p>Sorry, I interrupted you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hope under so much uncertainty</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going to happen?</p>
<p>What are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>I mean, control has an answer for this.</p>
<p>Robust control is one approach,</p>
<p>but roughly you can write controllers</p>
<p>which try to still perform the right task</p>
<p>despite all the things that could possibly happen.</p>
<p>The world might want the table to go this way and this way,</p>
<p>but if I write a controller that pushes a little bit more</p>
<p>and pushes a little bit,</p>
<p>I can certainly make the table go in the direction I want.</p>
<p>It just puts a little bit more of a burden</p>
<p>on the control system, right?</p>
<p>And this discontinuities do change the control system</p>
<p>because the way we write it down right now,</p>
<p>every different control configuration,</p>
<p>including sticking or sliding</p>
<p>or parts of my body that are in contact or not,</p>
<p>looks like a different system.</p>
<p>And I think of them,</p>
<p>I reason about them separately or differently</p>
<p>and the combinatorics of that blow up, right?</p>
<p>So I just don&rsquo;t have enough time to compute</p>
<p>all the possible contact configurations of my humanoid.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I mean, I&rsquo;m a humanoid.</p>
<p>I have lots of degrees of freedom, lots of joints.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only been around for a handful of years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting up there,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t had time in my life</p>
<p>to visit all of the states in my system,</p>
<p>certainly all the contact configurations.</p>
<p>So if step one is to consider</p>
<p>every possible contact configuration that I&rsquo;ll ever be in,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not a problem I need to solve, right?</p>
<p>Just as a small tangent, what&rsquo;s a contact configuration?</p>
<p>What like, just so we can enumerate</p>
<p>what are we talking about?</p>
<p>How many are there?</p>
<p>The simplest example maybe would be,</p>
<p>imagine a robot with a flat foot.</p>
<p>And we think about the phases of gait</p>
<p>where the heel strikes and then the front toe strikes,</p>
<p>and then you can heel up, toe off.</p>
<p>Those are each different contact configurations.</p>
<p>I only had two different contacts,</p>
<p>but I ended up with four different contact configurations.</p>
<p>Now, of course, my robot might actually have bumps on it</p>
<p>or other things,</p>
<p>so it could be much more subtle than that, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just even with one sort of box</p>
<p>interacting with the ground already in the plane</p>
<p>has that many, right?</p>
<p>And if I was just even a 3D foot,</p>
<p>then it probably my left toe might touch</p>
<p>just before my right toe and things get subtle.</p>
<p>Now, if I&rsquo;m a dexterous hand</p>
<p>and I go to talk about just grabbing a water bottle,</p>
<p>if I have to enumerate every possible order</p>
<p>that my hand came into contact with the bottle,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m dead in the water.</p>
<p>Any approach that we were able to get away with that</p>
<p>in walking because we mostly touched the ground</p>
<p>within a small number of points, for instance,</p>
<p>and we haven&rsquo;t been able to get dexterous hands that way.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned that people think</p>
<p>that contact is really hard</p>
<p>and that that&rsquo;s the reason that robotic manipulation</p>
<p>is problem is really hard.</p>
<p>Is there any flaws in that thinking?</p>
<p>So I think simulating contact is one aspect.</p>
<p>I know people often say that we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that one of the reasons that we have a limit in robotics</p>
<p>is because we do not simulate contact accurately</p>
<p>in our simulators.</p>
<p>And I think that is the extent to which that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>is partly because our simulators,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t got mature enough simulators.</p>
<p>There are some things that are still hard, difficult,</p>
<p>that we should change,</p>
<p>but we actually, we know what the governing equations are.</p>
<p>They have some foibles like this indeterminacy,</p>
<p>but we should be able to simulate them accurately.</p>
<p>We have incredible open source community in robotics,</p>
<p>but it actually just takes a professional engineering team</p>
<p>a lot of work to write a very good simulator like that.</p>
<p>Now, where does, I believe you&rsquo;ve written, Drake.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a team of people.</p>
<p>I certainly spent a lot of hours on it myself.</p>
<p>But what is Drake and what does it take to create</p>
<p>a simulation environment for the kind of difficult control</p>
<p>problems we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Right, so Drake is the simulator that I&rsquo;ve been working on.</p>
<p>There are other good simulators out there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to think of Drake as just a simulator</p>
<p>because we write our controllers in Drake,</p>
<p>we write our perception systems a little bit in Drake,</p>
<p>but we write all of our low level control</p>
<p>and even planning and optimization.</p>
<p>So it has optimization capabilities as well?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, Drake is three things roughly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an optimization library, which is sits on,</p>
<p>it provides a layer of abstraction in C++ and Python</p>
<p>for commercial solvers.</p>
<p>You can write linear programs, quadratic programs,</p>
<p>semi definite programs, sums of squares programs,</p>
<p>the ones we&rsquo;ve used, mixed integer programs,</p>
<p>and it will do the work to curate those</p>
<p>and send them to whatever the right solver is for instance,</p>
<p>and it provides a level of abstraction.</p>
<p>The second thing is a system modeling language,</p>
<p>a bit like LabVIEW or Simulink,</p>
<p>where you can make block diagrams out of complex systems,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like ROS in that sense,</p>
<p>where you might have lots of ROS nodes</p>
<p>that are each doing some part of your system,</p>
<p>but to contrast it with ROS, we try to write,</p>
<p>if you write a Drake system, then you have to,</p>
<p>it asks you to describe a little bit more about the system.</p>
<p>If you have any state, for instance, in the system,</p>
<p>any variables that are gonna persist,</p>
<p>you have to declare them.</p>
<p>Parameters can be declared and the like,</p>
<p>but the advantage of doing that is that you can,</p>
<p>if you like, run things all on one process,</p>
<p>but you can also do control design against it.</p>
<p>You can do, I mean, simple things like rewinding</p>
<p>and playing back your simulations, for instance,</p>
<p>these things, you get some rewards</p>
<p>for spending a little bit more upfront cost</p>
<p>in describing each system.</p>
<p>And I was inspired to do that</p>
<p>because I think the complexity of Atlas, for instance,</p>
<p>is just so great.</p>
<p>And I think, although, I mean,</p>
<p>ROS has been an incredible, absolutely huge fan</p>
<p>of what it&rsquo;s done for the robotics community,</p>
<p>but the ability to rapidly put different pieces together</p>
<p>and have a functioning thing is very good.</p>
<p>But I do think that it&rsquo;s hard to think clearly</p>
<p>about a bag of disparate parts,</p>
<p>Mr. Potato Head kind of software stack.</p>
<p>And if you can ask a little bit more</p>
<p>out of each of those parts,</p>
<p>then you can understand the way they work better.</p>
<p>You can try to verify them and the like,</p>
<p>or you can do learning against them.</p>
<p>And then one of those systems, the last thing,</p>
<p>I said the first two things that Drake is,</p>
<p>but the last thing is that there is a set</p>
<p>of multi body equations, rigid body equations,</p>
<p>that is trying to provide a system that simulates physics.</p>
<p>And we also have renderers and other things,</p>
<p>but I think the physics component of Drake is special</p>
<p>in the sense that we have done excessive amount</p>
<p>of engineering to make sure</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve written the equations correctly.</p>
<p>Every possible tumbling satellite or spinning top</p>
<p>or anything that we could possibly write as a test is tested.</p>
<p>We are making some, I think, fundamental improvements</p>
<p>on the way you simulate contact.</p>
<p>Just what does it take to simulate contact?</p>
<p>I mean, it just seems,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something just beautiful</p>
<p>to the way you were like explaining contact</p>
<p>and you were like tapping your fingers</p>
<p>on the table while you&rsquo;re doing it, just.</p>
<p>Easily, right?</p>
<p>Easily, just like, just not even like,</p>
<p>it was like helping you think, I guess.</p>
<p>So you have this like awesome demo</p>
<p>of loading or unloading a dishwasher,</p>
<p>just picking up a plate,</p>
<p>or grasping it like for the first time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just seems like so difficult.</p>
<p>What, how do you simulate any of that?</p>
<p>So it was really interesting that what happened was</p>
<p>that we started getting more professional</p>
<p>about our software development</p>
<p>during the DARPA Robotics Challenge.</p>
<p>I learned the value of software engineering</p>
<p>and how these, how to bridle complexity.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what I want to somehow fight against</p>
<p>and bring some of the clear thinking of controls</p>
<p>into these complex systems we&rsquo;re building for robots.</p>
<p>Shortly after the DARPA Robotics Challenge,</p>
<p>Toyota opened a research institute,</p>
<p>TRI, Toyota Research Institute.</p>
<p>They put one of their, there&rsquo;s three locations.</p>
<p>One of them is just down the street from MIT.</p>
<p>And I helped ramp that up right up</p>
<p>as a part of my, the end of my sabbatical, I guess.</p>
<p>So TRI has given me, the TRI robotics effort</p>
<p>has made this investment in simulation in Drake.</p>
<p>And Michael Sherman leads a team there</p>
<p>of just absolutely top notch dynamics experts</p>
<p>that are trying to write those simulators</p>
<p>that can pick up the dishes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a team working on manipulation there</p>
<p>that is taking problems like loading the dishwasher.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re using that to study these really hard corner cases</p>
<p>kind of problems in manipulation.</p>
<p>So for me, this, you know, simulating the dishes,</p>
<p>we could actually write a controller.</p>
<p>If we just cared about picking up dishes in the sink once,</p>
<p>we could write a controller</p>
<p>without any simulation whatsoever,</p>
<p>and we could call it done.</p>
<p>But we want to understand like,</p>
<p>what is the path you take to actually get to a robot</p>
<p>that could perform that for any dish in anybody&rsquo;s kitchen</p>
<p>with enough confidence</p>
<p>that it could be a commercial product, right?</p>
<p>And it has deep learning perception in the loop.</p>
<p>It has complex dynamics in the loop.</p>
<p>It has controller, it has a planner.</p>
<p>And how do you take all of that complexity</p>
<p>and put it through this engineering discipline</p>
<p>and verification and validation process</p>
<p>to actually get enough confidence to deploy?</p>
<p>I mean, the DARPA challenge made me realize</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not something you throw over the fence</p>
<p>and hope that somebody will harden it for you,</p>
<p>that there are really fundamental challenges</p>
<p>in closing that last gap.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing the validation and the testing.</p>
<p>I think it might even change the way we have to think about</p>
<p>the way we write systems.</p>
<p>What happens if you have the robot running lots of tests</p>
<p>and it screws up, it breaks a dish, right?</p>
<p>How do you capture that?</p>
<p>I said, you can&rsquo;t run the same simulation</p>
<p>or the same experiment twice on a real robot.</p>
<p>Do we have to be able to bring that one off failure</p>
<p>back into simulation</p>
<p>in order to change our controllers, study it,</p>
<p>make sure it won&rsquo;t happen again?</p>
<p>Do we, is it enough to just try to add that</p>
<p>to our distribution and understand that on average,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna cover that situation again?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like really subtle questions at the corner cases</p>
<p>that I think we don&rsquo;t yet have satisfying answers for.</p>
<p>Like how do you find the corner cases?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one kind of, is there,</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s possible to create a systematized way</p>
<p>of discovering corner cases efficiently?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In whatever the problem is?</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, I think we have to get better at that.</p>
<p>I mean, control theory has for decades</p>
<p>talked about active experiment design.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>So people call it curiosity these days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s roughly this idea of trying to exploration</p>
<p>or exploitation, but in the active experiment design</p>
<p>is even, is more specific.</p>
<p>You could try to understand the uncertainty in your system,</p>
<p>design the experiment that will provide</p>
<p>the maximum information to reduce that uncertainty.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a parameter you wanna learn about,</p>
<p>what is the optimal trajectory I could execute</p>
<p>to learn about that parameter, for instance.</p>
<p>Scaling that up to something that has a deep network</p>
<p>in the loop and a planning in the loop is tough.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done some work on, you know,</p>
<p>with Matt Okely and Aman Sinha,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve worked on some falsification algorithms</p>
<p>that are trying to do rare event simulation</p>
<p>that try to just hammer on your simulator.</p>
<p>And if your simulator is good enough,</p>
<p>you can spend a lot of time,</p>
<p>or you can write good algorithms</p>
<p>that try to spend most of their time in the corner cases.</p>
<p>So you basically imagine you&rsquo;re building an autonomous car</p>
<p>and you wanna put it in, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>downtown New Delhi all the time, right?</p>
<p>And accelerated testing.</p>
<p>If you can write sampling strategies,</p>
<p>which figure out where your controller&rsquo;s</p>
<p>performing badly in simulation</p>
<p>and start generating lots of examples around that.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just the space of possible places</p>
<p>where that can be, where things can go wrong is very big.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to write those algorithms.</p>
<p>Yeah, rare event simulation</p>
<p>is just a really compelling notion, if it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>We joked and we call it the black swan generator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a black swan.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t just want the rare events,</p>
<p>you want the ones that are highly impactful.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the most,</p>
<p>those are the most sort of profound questions</p>
<p>we ask of our world.</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the worst that can happen?</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re really asking</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t some kind of like computer science,</p>
<p>worst case analysis.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re asking like, what are the millions of ways</p>
<p>this can go wrong?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like our curiosity.</p>
<p>And we humans, I think are pretty bad at,</p>
<p>we just like run into it.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a distributed sense</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s now like 7.5 billion of us.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of them.</p>
<p>And then a lot of them write blog posts</p>
<p>about the stupid thing they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So we learn in a distributed way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna be important for robots too.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s another massive theme</p>
<p>at Toyota Research for Robotics</p>
<p>is this fleet learning concept</p>
<p>is the idea that I, as a human,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough time to visit all of my states, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a, it&rsquo;s very hard for one robot</p>
<p>to experience all the things.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not actually the problem we have to solve, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have fleets of robots</p>
<p>that can have very similar appendages.</p>
<p>And at some point, maybe collectively,</p>
<p>they have enough data</p>
<p>that their computational processes</p>
<p>should be set up differently than ours, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this vision of just,</p>
<p>I mean, all these dishwasher unloading robots.</p>
<p>I mean, that robot dropping a plate</p>
<p>and a human looking at the robot probably pissed off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a special moment to record.</p>
<p>I think one thing in terms of fleet learning,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen that because I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of folks,</p>
<p>just like Tesla users or Tesla drivers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re another company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s using this kind of fleet learning idea.</p>
<p>One hopeful thing I have about humans</p>
<p>is they really enjoy when a system improves, learns.</p>
<p>So they enjoy fleet learning.</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s hopeful for me</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re willing to put up with something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of dumb right now.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, if it&rsquo;s improving,</p>
<p>they almost like enjoy being part of the, like teaching it.</p>
<p>Almost like if you have kids,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re teaching them something, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing</p>
<p>because that gives me hope</p>
<p>that we can put dumb robots out there.</p>
<p>I mean, the problem on the Tesla side with cars,</p>
<p>cars can kill you.</p>
<p>That makes the problem so much harder.</p>
<p>Dishwasher unloading is a little safe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why home robotics is really exciting.</p>
<p>And just to clarify, I mean, for people who might not know,</p>
<p>I mean, TRI, Toyota Research Institute.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re, I mean, they&rsquo;re pretty well known</p>
<p>for like autonomous vehicle research,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also interested in home robotics.</p>
<p>Yep, there&rsquo;s a big group working on,</p>
<p>multiple groups working on home robotics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a major part of the portfolio.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a couple other projects</p>
<p>in advanced materials discovery,</p>
<p>using AI and machine learning to discover new materials</p>
<p>for car batteries and the like, for instance, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been actually an incredibly successful team.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s new projects starting up too, so.</p>
<p>Do you see a future of where like robots are in our home</p>
<p>and like robots that have like actuators</p>
<p>that look like arms in our home</p>
<p>or like, you know, more like humanoid type robots?</p>
<p>Or is this, are we gonna do the same thing</p>
<p>that you just mentioned that, you know,</p>
<p>the dishwasher is no longer a robot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to just not even see them as robots.</p>
<p>But I mean, what&rsquo;s your vision of the home of the future</p>
<p>10, 20 years from now, 50 years, if you get crazy?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we already have Roombas cruising around.</p>
<p>We have, you know, Alexis or Google Homes</p>
<p>on our kitchen counter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until they spring arms</p>
<p>and start doing something useful like that.</p>
<p>So I do think it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>I think lots of people have lots of motivations</p>
<p>for doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been super interesting actually learning</p>
<p>about Toyota&rsquo;s vision for it,</p>
<p>which is about helping people age in place.</p>
<p>Cause I think that&rsquo;s not necessarily the first entry,</p>
<p>the most lucrative entry point,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the problem maybe that we really need to solve</p>
<p>no matter what.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a real opportunity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a delicate problem.</p>
<p>How do you work with people, help people,</p>
<p>keep them active, engaged, you know,</p>
<p>but improve their quality of life</p>
<p>and help them age in place, for instance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because older folks are also,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a contrast there</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not always the folks</p>
<p>who are the most comfortable with technology, for example.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a division that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You can do so much good with a robot for older folks,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a gap to fill of understanding.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s actually kind of beautiful.</p>
<p>Robot is learning about the human</p>
<p>and the human is kind of learning about this new robot thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also with, at least with,</p>
<p>like when I talked to my parents about robots,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of a blank slate there too.</p>
<p>Like you can, I mean, they don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about robotics, so it&rsquo;s completely like wide open.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have, they haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>my parents haven&rsquo;t seen Black Mirror.</p>
<p>So like they, it&rsquo;s a blank slate.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a cool thing, like what can it do for me?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s an exciting space.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really important space.</p>
<p>I do feel like a few years ago,</p>
<p>drones were successful enough in academia.</p>
<p>They kind of broke out and started an industry</p>
<p>and autonomous cars have been happening.</p>
<p>It does feel like manipulation in logistics, of course,</p>
<p>first, but in the home shortly after,</p>
<p>seems like one of the next big things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna really pop.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we talked about it,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s soft robotics?</p>
<p>So we talked about like rigid bodies.</p>
<p>Like if we can just linger on this whole touch thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what&rsquo;s soft robotics?</p>
<p>So I told you that I really dislike the fact</p>
<p>that robots are afraid of touching the world</p>
<p>all over their body.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a couple reasons for that.</p>
<p>If you look carefully at all the places</p>
<p>that robots actually do touch the world,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re almost always soft.</p>
<p>They have some sort of pad on their fingers</p>
<p>or a rubber sole on their foot.</p>
<p>But if you look up and down the arm,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just pure aluminum or something.</p>
<p>So that makes it hard actually.</p>
<p>In fact, hitting the table with your rigid arm</p>
<p>or nearly rigid arm has some of the problems</p>
<p>that we talked about in terms of simulation.</p>
<p>I think it fundamentally changes the mechanics of contact</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re soft, right?</p>
<p>You turn point contacts into patch contacts,</p>
<p>which can have torsional friction.</p>
<p>You can have distributed load.</p>
<p>If I wanna pick up an egg, right?</p>
<p>If I pick it up with two points,</p>
<p>then in order to put enough force</p>
<p>to sustain the weight of the egg,</p>
<p>I might have to put a lot of force to break the egg.</p>
<p>If I envelop it with contact all around,</p>
<p>then I can distribute my force across the shell of the egg</p>
<p>and have a better chance of not breaking it.</p>
<p>So soft robotics is for me a lot about changing</p>
<p>the mechanics of contact.</p>
<p>Does it make the problem a lot harder?</p>
<p>Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>It changes the computational problem.</p>
<p>I think because of the, I think our world</p>
<p>and our mathematics has biased us towards rigid.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>But it really should make things better in some ways, right?</p>
<p>I think the future is unwritten there.</p>
<p>But the other thing it can do.</p>
<p>I think ultimately, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but I think ultimately it will make things simpler</p>
<p>if we embrace the softness of the world.</p>
<p>It makes things smoother, right?</p>
<p>So the result of small actions is less discontinuous,</p>
<p>but it also means potentially less instantaneously bad.</p>
<p>For instance, I won&rsquo;t necessarily contact something</p>
<p>and send it flying off.</p>
<p>The other aspect of it</p>
<p>that just happens to dovetail really well</p>
<p>is that soft robotics tends to be a place</p>
<p>where we can embed a lot of sensors too.</p>
<p>So if you change your hardware and make it more soft,</p>
<p>then you can potentially have a tactile sensor,</p>
<p>which is measuring the deformation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a team at TRI that&rsquo;s working on soft hands</p>
<p>and you get so much more information.</p>
<p>You can put a camera behind the skin roughly</p>
<p>and get fantastic tactile information,</p>
<p>which is, it&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>Like in manipulation,</p>
<p>one of the things that really is frustrating</p>
<p>is if you work super hard on your head mounted,</p>
<p>on your perception system for your head mounted cameras,</p>
<p>and then you get a lot of information</p>
<p>for your head mounted cameras,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve identified an object,</p>
<p>you reach down to touch it,</p>
<p>and the last thing that happens,</p>
<p>right before the most important time,</p>
<p>you stick your hand</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re occluding your head mounted sensors.</p>
<p>So in all the part that really matters,</p>
<p>all of your off board sensors are occluded.</p>
<p>And really, if you don&rsquo;t have tactile information,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re blind in an important way.</p>
<p>So it happens that soft robotics and tactile sensing</p>
<p>tend to go hand in hand.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve kind of talked about it,</p>
<p>but you taught a course on underactuated robotics.</p>
<p>I believe that was the name of it, actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Can you talk about it in that context?</p>
<p>What is underactuated robotics?</p>
<p>Right, so underactuated robotics is my graduate course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s online mostly now,</p>
<p>in the sense that the lectures.</p>
<p>Several versions of it, I think.</p>
<p>Right, the YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really great, I recommend it highly.</p>
<p>Look on YouTube for the 2020 versions.</p>
<p>Until March, and then you have to go back to 2019,</p>
<p>thanks to COVID.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve poured my heart into that class.</p>
<p>And lecture one is basically explaining</p>
<p>what the word underactuated means.</p>
<p>So people are very kind to show up</p>
<p>and then maybe have to learn</p>
<p>what the title of the course means</p>
<p>over the course of the first lecture.</p>
<p>That first lecture is really good.</p>
<p>You should watch it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strange name,</p>
<p>but I thought it captured the essence</p>
<p>of what control was good at doing</p>
<p>and what control was bad at doing.</p>
<p>So what do I mean by underactuated?</p>
<p>So a mechanical system</p>
<p>has many degrees of freedom, for instance.</p>
<p>I think of a joint as a degree of freedom.</p>
<p>And it has some number of actuators, motors.</p>
<p>So if you have a robot that&rsquo;s bolted to the table</p>
<p>that has five degrees of freedom and five motors,</p>
<p>then you have a fully actuated robot.</p>
<p>If you take away one of those motors,</p>
<p>then you have an underactuated robot.</p>
<p>Now, why on earth?</p>
<p>I have a good friend who likes to tease me.</p>
<p>He said, Ross, if you had more research funding,</p>
<p>would you work on fully actuated robots?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the answer is no.</p>
<p>The world gives us underactuated robots,</p>
<p>whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a human.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an underactuated robot,</p>
<p>even though I have more muscles</p>
<p>than my big degrees of freedom,</p>
<p>because I have in some places</p>
<p>multiple muscles attached to the same joint.</p>
<p>But still, there&rsquo;s a really important degree of freedom</p>
<p>that I have, which is the location of my center of mass</p>
<p>in space, for instance.</p>
<p>All right, I can jump into the air,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no motor that connects my center of mass</p>
<p>to the ground in that case.</p>
<p>So I have to think about the implications</p>
<p>of not having control over everything.</p>
<p>The passive dynamic walkers are the extreme view of that,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve taken away all the motors,</p>
<p>and you have to let physics do the work.</p>
<p>But it shows up in all of the walking robots,</p>
<p>where you have to use some of the actuators</p>
<p>to push and pull even the degrees of freedom</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have an actuator on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s referring to walking if you&rsquo;re falling forward.</p>
<p>Is there a way to walk that&rsquo;s fully actuated?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a subtle point.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in contact and you have your feet on the ground,</p>
<p>there are still limits to what you can do, right?</p>
<p>Unless I have suction cups on my feet,</p>
<p>I cannot accelerate my center of mass towards the ground</p>
<p>faster than gravity,</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t get a force pushing me down, right?</p>
<p>But I can still do most of the things that I want to.</p>
<p>So you can get away with basically thinking of the system</p>
<p>as fully actuated,</p>
<p>unless you suddenly needed to accelerate down super fast.</p>
<p>But as soon as I take a step,</p>
<p>I get into the more nuanced territory,</p>
<p>and to get to really dynamic robots,</p>
<p>or airplanes or other things,</p>
<p>I think you have to embrace the underactuated dynamics.</p>
<p>Manipulation, people think, is manipulation underactuated?</p>
<p>Even if my arm is fully actuated, I have a motor,</p>
<p>if my goal is to control the position and orientation</p>
<p>of this cup, then I don&rsquo;t have an actuator</p>
<p>for that directly.</p>
<p>So I have to use my actuators over here</p>
<p>to control this thing.</p>
<p>Now it gets even worse,</p>
<p>like what if I have to button my shirt, okay?</p>
<p>What are the degrees of freedom of my shirt, right?</p>
<p>I suddenly, that&rsquo;s a hard question to think about.</p>
<p>It kind of makes me queasy</p>
<p>thinking about my state space control ideas.</p>
<p>But actually those are the problems</p>
<p>that make me so excited about manipulation right now,</p>
<p>is that it breaks some of the,</p>
<p>it breaks a lot of the foundational control stuff</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about.</p>
<p>Is there, what are some interesting insights</p>
<p>you could say about trying to solve an underactuated,</p>
<p>a control in an underactuated system?</p>
<p>So I think the philosophy there</p>
<p>is let physics do more of the work.</p>
<p>The technical approach has been optimization.</p>
<p>So you typically formulate your decision making</p>
<p>for control as an optimization problem.</p>
<p>And you use the language of optimal control</p>
<p>and sometimes often numerical optimal control</p>
<p>in order to make those decisions and balance,</p>
<p>these complicated equations of,</p>
<p>and in order to control,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to use optimal control</p>
<p>to do underactuated systems,</p>
<p>but that has been the technical approach</p>
<p>that has borne the most fruit in our,</p>
<p>at least in our line of work.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some, so in underactuated systems,</p>
<p>when you say let physics do some of the work,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a kind of feedback loop</p>
<p>that observes the state that the physics brought you to.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;ve, there&rsquo;s a perception there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a feedback somehow.</p>
<p>Do you ever loop in like complicated perception systems</p>
<p>into this whole picture?</p>
<p>Right, right around the time of the DARPA challenge,</p>
<p>we had a complicated perception system</p>
<p>in the DARPA challenge.</p>
<p>We also started to embrace perception</p>
<p>for our flying vehicles at the time.</p>
<p>We had a really good project</p>
<p>on trying to make airplanes fly</p>
<p>at high speeds through forests.</p>
<p>Sirtash Karaman was on that project</p>
<p>and we had, it was a really fun team to work on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s carried it farther, much farther forward since then.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s using cameras for perception?</p>
<p>So that was using cameras.</p>
<p>That was, at the time we felt like LIDAR</p>
<p>was too heavy and too power heavy</p>
<p>to be carried on a light UAV,</p>
<p>and we were using cameras.</p>
<p>And that was a big part of it was just</p>
<p>how do you do even stereo matching</p>
<p>at a fast enough rate with a small camera,</p>
<p>small onboard compute.</p>
<p>Since then we have now,</p>
<p>so the deep learning revolution</p>
<p>unquestionably changed what we can do</p>
<p>with perception for robotics and control.</p>
<p>So in manipulation, we can address,</p>
<p>we can use perception in I think a much deeper way.</p>
<p>And we get into not only,</p>
<p>I think the first use of it naturally</p>
<p>would be to ask your deep learning system</p>
<p>to look at the cameras and produce the state,</p>
<p>which is like the pose of my thing, for instance.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;ve quickly found out</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not always the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because what&rsquo;s the state of my shirt?</p>
<p>Imagine, I&rsquo;ve always,</p>
<p>Very noisy, you mean, or?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, if the first step of me trying to button my shirt</p>
<p>is estimate the full state of my shirt,</p>
<p>including like what&rsquo;s happening in the back here,</p>
<p>whatever, whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not the right specification.</p>
<p>There are aspects of the state</p>
<p>that are very important to the task.</p>
<p>There are many that are unobservable</p>
<p>and not important to the task.</p>
<p>So you really need,</p>
<p>it begs new questions about state representation.</p>
<p>Another example that we&rsquo;ve been playing with in lab</p>
<p>has been just the idea of chopping onions, okay?</p>
<p>Or carrots, turns out to be better.</p>
<p>So onions stink up the lab.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re hard to see in a camera.</p>
<p>But so,</p>
<p>Details matter, yeah.</p>
<p>Details matter, you know?</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m moving around a particular object, right?</p>
<p>Then I think about,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s got a position or an orientation in space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the description I want.</p>
<p>Now, when I&rsquo;m chopping an onion, okay?</p>
<p>Like the first chop comes down.</p>
<p>I have now a hundred pieces of onion.</p>
<p>Does my control system really need to understand</p>
<p>the position and orientation and even the shape</p>
<p>of the hundred pieces of onion in order to make a decision?</p>
<p>Probably not, you know?</p>
<p>And if I keep going, I&rsquo;m just getting,</p>
<p>more and more is my state space getting bigger as I cut?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>So somehow there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a richer idea of state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the state that is given to us</p>
<p>by Lagrangian mechanics.</p>
<p>There is a proper Lagrangian state of the system,</p>
<p>but the relevant state for this is some latent state</p>
<p>is what we call it in machine learning.</p>
<p>But, you know, there&rsquo;s some different state representation.</p>
<p>Some compressed representation, some.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I worry about saying compressed</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind that it&rsquo;s low dimensional or not,</p>
<p>but it has to be something that&rsquo;s easier to think about.</p>
<p>By us humans.</p>
<p>Or my algorithms.</p>
<p>Or the algorithms being like control, optimal.</p>
<p>So for instance, if the contact mechanics</p>
<p>of all of those onion pieces and all the permutations</p>
<p>of possible touches between those onion pieces,</p>
<p>you know, you can give me</p>
<p>a high dimensional state representation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay if it&rsquo;s linear.</p>
<p>But if I have to think about all the possible</p>
<p>shattering combinatorics of that,</p>
<p>then my robot&rsquo;s gonna sit there thinking</p>
<p>and the soup&rsquo;s gonna get cold or something.</p>
<p>So since you taught the course,</p>
<p>it kind of entered my mind,</p>
<p>the idea of underactuated as really compelling</p>
<p>to see the world in this kind of way.</p>
<p>Do you ever, you know, if we talk about onions</p>
<p>or you talk about the world with people in it in general,</p>
<p>do you see the world as basically an underactuated system?</p>
<p>Do you like often look at the world in this way?</p>
<p>Or is this overreach?</p>
<p>Underactuated is a way of life, man.</p>
<p>Exactly, I guess that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p>I think in some places,</p>
<p>we already have natural tools to deal with it.</p>
<p>You know, it rears its head.</p>
<p>I mean, in linear systems, it&rsquo;s not a problem.</p>
<p>We just, like an underactuated linear system</p>
<p>is really not sufficiently distinct</p>
<p>from a fully actuated linear system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a subtle point about when that becomes a bottleneck</p>
<p>in what we know how to do with control.</p>
<p>It happens to be a bottleneck,</p>
<p>although we&rsquo;ve gotten incredibly good solutions now,</p>
<p>but for a long time that I felt</p>
<p>that that was the key bottleneck in legged robots.</p>
<p>And roughly now the underactuated course</p>
<p>is me trying to tell people everything I can</p>
<p>about how to make Atlas do a backflip, right?</p>
<p>I have a second course now</p>
<p>that I teach in the other semesters,</p>
<p>which is on manipulation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we get into now more of the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a newer class.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to put it online this fall completely.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna have much more aspects</p>
<p>about these perception problems</p>
<p>and the state representation questions,</p>
<p>and then how do you do control.</p>
<p>And the thing that&rsquo;s a little bit sad is that,</p>
<p>for me at least, is there&rsquo;s a lot of manipulation tasks</p>
<p>that people wanna do and should wanna do.</p>
<p>They could start a company with it and be very successful</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t actually require you to think that much</p>
<p>about underact, or dynamics at all even,</p>
<p>but certainly underactuated dynamics.</p>
<p>Once I have, if I reach out and grab something,</p>
<p>if I can sort of assume it&rsquo;s rigidly attached to my hand,</p>
<p>then I can do a lot of interesting,</p>
<p>meaningful things with it</p>
<p>without really ever thinking about the dynamics</p>
<p>of that object.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve built systems that kind of reduce the need for that.</p>
<p>Enveloping grasps and the like.</p>
<p>But I think the really good problems in manipulation.</p>
<p>So manipulation, by the way, is more than just pick and place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a lot of people think of that, just grasping.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that.</p>
<p>I mean buttoning my shirt, I mean tying shoelaces.</p>
<p>How do you program a robot to tie shoelaces?</p>
<p>And not just one shoe, but every shoe, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to write down like the infinite dimensional</p>
<p>state of the laces, that&rsquo;s probably not needed</p>
<p>to write a good controller.</p>
<p>I know we could hand design a controller that would do it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>I want to understand the principles that would allow me</p>
<p>to solve another problem that&rsquo;s kind of like that.</p>
<p>But I think if we can stay pure in our approach,</p>
<p>then the challenge of tying anybody&rsquo;s shoes</p>
<p>is a great challenge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great challenge.</p>
<p>I mean, and the soft touch comes into play there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Let me ask another ridiculous question on this topic.</p>
<p>How important is touch?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked much about humans,</p>
<p>but I have this argument with my dad</p>
<p>where like I think you can fall in love with a robot</p>
<p>based on language alone.</p>
<p>And he believes that touch is essential.</p>
<p>Touch and smell, he says.</p>
<p>But so in terms of robots, connecting with humans,</p>
<p>we can go philosophical in terms of like a deep,</p>
<p>meaningful connection, like love,</p>
<p>but even just like collaborating in an interesting way,</p>
<p>how important is touch like from an engineering perspective</p>
<p>and a philosophical one?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>Even just in a practical sense,</p>
<p>if we forget about the emotional part of it.</p>
<p>But for robots to interact safely</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re doing meaningful mechanical work</p>
<p>in the close contact with or vicinity of people</p>
<p>that need help, I think we have to have them,</p>
<p>we have to build them differently.</p>
<p>They have to be afraid, not afraid of touching the world.</p>
<p>So I think Baymax is just awesome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like the movie of Big Hero 6</p>
<p>and the concept of Baymax, that&rsquo;s just awesome.</p>
<p>I think we should, and we have some folks at Toyota</p>
<p>that are trying to, Toyota Research</p>
<p>that are trying to build Baymax roughly.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just a fantastically good project.</p>
<p>I think it will change the way people physically interact.</p>
<p>The same way, I mean, you gave a couple examples earlier,</p>
<p>but if the robot that was walking around my home</p>
<p>looked more like a teddy bear</p>
<p>and a little less like the Terminator,</p>
<p>that could change completely the way people perceive it</p>
<p>and interact with it.</p>
<p>And maybe they&rsquo;ll even wanna teach it, like you said, right?</p>
<p>You could not quite gamify it,</p>
<p>but somehow instead of people judging it</p>
<p>and looking at it as if it&rsquo;s not doing as well as a human,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna try to help out the cute teddy bear, right?</p>
<p>Who knows, but I think we&rsquo;re building robots wrong</p>
<p>and being more soft and more contact is important, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, like all the magical moments</p>
<p>I can remember with robots,</p>
<p>well, first of all, just visiting your lab and seeing Atlas,</p>
<p>but also Spotmini, when I first saw Spotmini in person</p>
<p>and hung out with him, her, it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have trouble engendering robots.</p>
<p>I feel the robotics people really say, oh, is it it?</p>
<p>I kinda like the idea that it&rsquo;s a her or a him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a magical moment, but there&rsquo;s no touching.</p>
<p>I guess the question I have, have you ever been,</p>
<p>like, have you had a human robot experience</p>
<p>where a robot touched you?</p>
<p>And like, it was like, wait,</p>
<p>like, was there a moment that you&rsquo;ve forgotten</p>
<p>that a robot is a robot and like,</p>
<p>the anthropomorphization stepped in</p>
<p>and for a second you forgot that it&rsquo;s not human?</p>
<p>I mean, I think when you&rsquo;re in on the details,</p>
<p>then we, of course, anthropomorphized our work with Atlas,</p>
<p>but in verbal communication and the like,</p>
<p>I think we were pretty aware of it</p>
<p>as a machine that needed to be respected.</p>
<p>And I actually, I worry more about the smaller robots</p>
<p>that could still move quickly if programmed wrong</p>
<p>and we have to be careful actually</p>
<p>about safety and the like right now.</p>
<p>And that, if we build our robots correctly,</p>
<p>I think then those, a lot of those concerns could go away.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing that trend.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing the lower cost, lighter weight arms now</p>
<p>that could be fundamentally safe.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think touch is so fundamental.</p>
<p>Ted Adelson is great.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a perceptual scientist at MIT</p>
<p>and he studied vision most of his life.</p>
<p>And he said, when I had kids,</p>
<p>I expected to be fascinated by their perceptual development.</p>
<p>But what really, what he noticed was,</p>
<p>felt more impressive, more dominant</p>
<p>was the way that they would touch everything</p>
<p>and lick everything.</p>
<p>And pick things up, stick it on their tongue and whatever.</p>
<p>And he said, watching his daughter convinced him</p>
<p>that actually he needed to study tactile sensing more.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something very important.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little bit also of the passive</p>
<p>versus active part of the world, right?</p>
<p>You can passively perceive the world.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fundamentally different if you can do an experiment</p>
<p>and if you can change the world</p>
<p>and you can learn a lot more than a passive observer.</p>
<p>So you can in dialogue, that was your initial example,</p>
<p>you could have an active experiment exchange.</p>
<p>But I think if you&rsquo;re just a camera watching YouTube,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very different problem</p>
<p>than if you&rsquo;re a robot that can apply force.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a very different problem</p>
<p>than if you&rsquo;re a robot that can apply force and touch.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s just an exciting area of research.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re probably right</p>
<p>that this hasn&rsquo;t been under researched.</p>
<p>To me as a person who&rsquo;s captivated</p>
<p>by the idea of human robot interaction,</p>
<p>it feels like such a rich opportunity to explore touch.</p>
<p>Not even from a safety perspective,</p>
<p>but like you said, the emotional too.</p>
<p>I mean, safety comes first,</p>
<p>but the next step is like a real human connection.</p>
<p>Even in the industrial setting,</p>
<p>it just feels like it&rsquo;s nice for the robot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you might disagree with this,</p>
<p>but because I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to see robots as tools often,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re just always going to be more effective</p>
<p>once you humanize them.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s convenient now to think of them as tools</p>
<p>because we want to focus on the safety,</p>
<p>but I think ultimately to create like a good experience</p>
<p>for the worker, for the person,</p>
<p>there has to be a human element.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, for me,</p>
<p>it feels like an industrial robotic arm</p>
<p>would be better if it has a human element.</p>
<p>I think like Rethink Robotics had that idea</p>
<p>with the Baxter and having eyes and so on,</p>
<p>having, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m a big believer in that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my area, but I am also a big believer.</p>
<p>Do you have an emotional connection to Atlas?</p>
<p>Like do you miss him?</p>
<p>I mean, yes, I don&rsquo;t know if I more so</p>
<p>than if I had a different science project</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d worked on super hard, right?</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, the robot,</p>
<p>we basically had to do heart surgery on the robot</p>
<p>in the final competition because we melted the core.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was something about watching that robot</p>
<p>hanging there.</p>
<p>We know we had to compete with it in an hour</p>
<p>and it was getting its guts ripped out.</p>
<p>Those are all historic moments.</p>
<p>I think if you look back like a hundred years from now,</p>
<p>yeah, I think those are important moments in robotics.</p>
<p>I mean, these are the early days.</p>
<p>You look at like the early days</p>
<p>of a lot of scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>They look ridiculous, they&rsquo;re full of failure,</p>
<p>but it feels like robotics will be important</p>
<p>in the coming a hundred years.</p>
<p>And these are the early days.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of people are,</p>
<p>look at a brilliant person such as yourself</p>
<p>and are curious about the intellectual journey they&rsquo;ve took.</p>
<p>Is there maybe three books, technical, fiction,</p>
<p>philosophical that had a big impact on your life</p>
<p>that you would recommend perhaps others reading?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I actually didn&rsquo;t read that much as a kid,</p>
<p>but I read fairly voraciously now.</p>
<p>There are some recent books that if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in this kind of topic, like AI Superpowers by Kai Fu Lee</p>
<p>is just a fantastic read.</p>
<p>You must read that.</p>
<p>Yuval Harari is just, I think that can open your mind.</p>
<p>Sapiens.</p>
<p>Sapiens is the first one, Homo Deus is the second, yeah.</p>
<p>We mentioned it in the book,</p>
<p>Homo Deus is the second, yeah.</p>
<p>We mentioned The Black Swan by Taleb.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good sort of mind opener.</p>
<p>I actually, so there&rsquo;s maybe a more controversial</p>
<p>recommendation I could give.</p>
<p>Great, we love controversy.</p>
<p>In some sense, it&rsquo;s so classical it might surprise you,</p>
<p>but I actually recently read Mortimer Adler&rsquo;s</p>
<p>How to Read a Book, not so long, it was a while ago,</p>
<p>but some people hate that book.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in this time right now where,</p>
<p>boy, we&rsquo;re just inundated with research papers</p>
<p>that you could read on archive with limited peer review</p>
<p>and just this wealth of information.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think the passion of what you can get</p>
<p>out of a book, a really good book or a really good paper</p>
<p>if you find it, the attitude, the realization</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re only gonna find a few that really</p>
<p>are worth all your time, but then once you find them,</p>
<p>you should just dig in and understand it very deeply</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s worth marking it up and having the hard copy</p>
<p>writing in the side notes, side margins.</p>
<p>I think that was really, I read it at the right time</p>
<p>where I was just feeling just overwhelmed</p>
<p>with really low quality stuff, I guess.</p>
<p>And similarly, I&rsquo;m just giving more than three now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;ve exceeded my quota.</p>
<p>But on that topic just real quick is,</p>
<p>so basically finding a few companions to keep</p>
<p>for the rest of your life in terms of papers and books</p>
<p>and so on and those are the ones,</p>
<p>like not doing, what is it, FOMO, fear of missing out,</p>
<p>constantly trying to update yourself,</p>
<p>but really deeply making a life journey</p>
<p>of studying a particular paper, essentially, set of papers.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think when you really start to understand</p>
<p>when you really find something,</p>
<p>which a book that resonates with you</p>
<p>might not be the same book that resonates with me,</p>
<p>but when you really find one that resonates with you,</p>
<p>I think the dialogue that happens and that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>I loved that Adler was saying, I think Socrates and Plato</p>
<p>say the written word is never gonna capture</p>
<p>the beauty of dialogue, right?</p>
<p>But Adler says, no, no, a really good book</p>
<p>is a dialogue between you and the author</p>
<p>and it crosses time and space and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very romantic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of like specific advice,</p>
<p>which you can just gloss over,</p>
<p>but the romantic view of how to read</p>
<p>and really appreciate it is so good.</p>
<p>And similarly, teaching,</p>
<p>yeah, I thought a lot about teaching</p>
<p>and so Isaac Asimov, great science fiction writer,</p>
<p>has also actually spent a lot of his career</p>
<p>writing nonfiction, right?</p>
<p>His memoir is fantastic.</p>
<p>He was passionate about explaining things, right?</p>
<p>He wrote all kinds of books</p>
<p>on all kinds of topics in science.</p>
<p>He was known as the great explainer</p>
<p>and I do really resonate with his style</p>
<p>and just his way of talking about,</p>
<p>by communicating and explaining to something</p>
<p>is really the way that you learn something.</p>
<p>I think about problems very differently</p>
<p>because of the way I&rsquo;ve been given the opportunity</p>
<p>to teach them at MIT.</p>
<p>We have questions asked, the fear of the lecture,</p>
<p>the experience of the lecture</p>
<p>and the questions I get and the interactions</p>
<p>just forces me to be rock solid on these ideas</p>
<p>in a way that if I didn&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I would be in a different intellectual space.</p>
<p>Also, video, does that scare you</p>
<p>that your lectures are online</p>
<p>and people like me in sweatpants can sit sipping coffee</p>
<p>and watch you give lectures?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I do think that something&rsquo;s changed right now,</p>
<p>which is, right now we&rsquo;re giving lectures over Zoom.</p>
<p>I mean, giving seminars over Zoom and everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out, I think it&rsquo;s a new medium.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how to exploit it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been quite cynical</p>
<p>about human to human connection over that medium,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s because it hasn&rsquo;t been explored fully</p>
<p>and teaching is a different thing.</p>
<p>Every lecture is a, I&rsquo;m sorry, every seminar even,</p>
<p>I think every talk I give is an opportunity</p>
<p>to give that differently.</p>
<p>I can deliver content directly into your browser.</p>
<p>You have a WebGL engine right there.</p>
<p>I can throw 3D content into your browser</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re listening to me, right?</p>
<p>And I can assume that you have at least</p>
<p>a powerful enough laptop or something to watch Zoom</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m doing that, while I&rsquo;m giving a lecture.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a new communication tool</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t have last year, right?</p>
<p>And I think robotics can potentially benefit a lot</p>
<p>from teaching that way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see, it&rsquo;s gonna be an experiment this fall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking a lot about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also like the length of lectures</p>
<p>or the length of like, there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>so like I guarantee you, it&rsquo;s like 80% of people</p>
<p>who started listening to our conversation</p>
<p>are still listening to now, which is crazy to me.</p>
<p>But so there&rsquo;s a patience and interest</p>
<p>in long form content, but at the same time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a magic to forcing yourself to condense</p>
<p>an idea to as short as possible.</p>
<p>As short as possible, like clip,</p>
<p>it can be a part of a longer thing,</p>
<p>but like just like really beautifully condense an idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s easier to do in remote with, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>with editing too.</p>
<p>Editing is an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Like what, you know, most professors don&rsquo;t get,</p>
<p>when they give a lecture,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get to go back and edit out parts,</p>
<p>like crisp it up a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also, it can do magic.</p>
<p>Like if you remove like five to 10 minutes</p>
<p>from an hour lecture, it can actually,</p>
<p>it can make something special of a lecture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that in myself and in others too,</p>
<p>because I edit other people&rsquo;s lectures to extract clips.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s certain tangents that are like,</p>
<p>that lose, they&rsquo;re not interesting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mumbling, they&rsquo;re just not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not clarifying, they&rsquo;re not helpful at all.</p>
<p>And once you remove them, it&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Editing can be magic.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of time.</p>
<p>Yeah, it takes, it depends like what is teaching,</p>
<p>you have to ask.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Cause I find the editing process is also beneficial</p>
<p>as for teaching, but also for your own learning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, have you watched yourself?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Have you watched those videos?</p>
<p>I mean, not all of them.</p>
<p>It could be painful to see like how to improve.</p>
<p>So do you find that, I know you segment your podcast.</p>
<p>Do you think that helps people with the,</p>
<p>the attention span aspect of it?</p>
<p>Or is it the segment like sections like,</p>
<p>yeah, we&rsquo;re talking about this topic, whatever.</p>
<p>Nope, nope, that just helps me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually bad.</p>
<p>So, and you&rsquo;ve been incredible.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m learning, like I&rsquo;m afraid of conversation.</p>
<p>This is even today, I&rsquo;m terrified of talking to you.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m trying to remove for myself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy, I mean, I&rsquo;ve learned from a lot of people,</p>
<p>but really there&rsquo;s been a few people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been inspirational to me in terms of conversation.</p>
<p>Whatever people think of him,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan has been inspirational to me</p>
<p>because comedians have been too.</p>
<p>Being able to just have fun and enjoy themselves</p>
<p>and lose themselves in conversation</p>
<p>that requires you to be a great storyteller,</p>
<p>to be able to pull a lot of different pieces</p>
<p>of information together.</p>
<p>But mostly just to enjoy yourself in conversations.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to learn that.</p>
<p>These notes are, you see me looking down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a safety blanket</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to let go of more and more.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, people love just regular conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they, the structure is like, whatever.</p>
<p>I would say, I would say maybe like 10 to like,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a bunch of, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably a couple of thousand PhD students</p>
<p>listening to this right now, right?</p>
<p>And they might know what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But there is somebody, I guarantee you right now,</p>
<p>in Russia, some kid who&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just smoked some weed, is sitting back</p>
<p>and just enjoying the hell out of this conversation.</p>
<p>Not really understanding.</p>
<p>He kind of watched some Boston Dynamics videos.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just enjoying it.</p>
<p>And I salute you, sir.</p>
<p>No, but just like, there&rsquo;s so much variety of people</p>
<p>that just have curiosity about engineering,</p>
<p>about sciences, about mathematics.</p>
<p>And also like, I should, I mean,</p>
<p>enjoying it is one thing,</p>
<p>but also often notice it inspires people to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who are like</p>
<p>in their undergraduate studies trying to figure out what,</p>
<p>trying to figure out what to pursue.</p>
<p>And these conversations can really spark</p>
<p>the direction of their life.</p>
<p>And in terms of robotics, I hope it does,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m excited about the possibilities</p>
<p>of what robotics brings.</p>
<p>On that topic, do you have advice?</p>
<p>Like what advice would you give</p>
<p>to a young person about life?</p>
<p>A young person about life</p>
<p>or a young person about life in robotics?</p>
<p>It could be in robotics.</p>
<p>Robotics, it could be in life in general.</p>
<p>It could be career.</p>
<p>It could be a relationship advice.</p>
<p>It could be running advice.</p>
<p>Just like they&rsquo;re, that&rsquo;s one of the things I see,</p>
<p>like we talked to like 20 year olds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, how do I do this thing?</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>If they come up to you, what would you tell them?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an interesting time to be a kid these days.</p>
<p>Everything points to this being sort of a winner,</p>
<p>take all economy and the like.</p>
<p>I think the people that will really excel in my opinion</p>
<p>are going to be the ones that can think deeply</p>
<p>about problems.</p>
<p>You have to be able to ask questions agilely</p>
<p>and use the internet for everything it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>and stuff like this.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people will develop those skills.</p>
<p>I think the leaders, thought leaders,</p>
<p>robotics leaders, whatever,</p>
<p>are gonna be the ones that can do more</p>
<p>and they can think very deeply and critically.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a harder thing to learn.</p>
<p>I think one path to learning that is through mathematics,</p>
<p>through engineering.</p>
<p>I would encourage people to start math early.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t really start.</p>
<p>I mean, I was always in the better math classes</p>
<p>that I could take,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t pursuing super advanced mathematics</p>
<p>or anything like that until I got to MIT.</p>
<p>I think MIT lit me up</p>
<p>and really started the life that I&rsquo;m living now.</p>
<p>But yeah, I really want kids to dig deep,</p>
<p>really understand things, building things too.</p>
<p>I mean, pull things apart, put them back together.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just such a good way</p>
<p>to really understand things</p>
<p>and expect it to be a long journey, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you don&rsquo;t have to know everything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna know everything.</p>
<p>So think deeply and stick with it.</p>
<p>Enjoy the ride, but just make sure you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>yeah, just make sure you&rsquo;re stopping</p>
<p>to think about why things work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s easy to lose yourself</p>
<p>in the distractions of the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re overwhelmed with content right now,</p>
<p>but you have to stop and pick some of it</p>
<p>and really understand it.</p>
<p>Yeah, on the book point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read Animal Farm by George Orwell</p>
<p>a ridiculous number of times.</p>
<p>So for me, like that book,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a good book in general,</p>
<p>but for me it connects deeply somehow.</p>
<p>It somehow connects, so I was born in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So it connects to me into the entirety of the history</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union and to World War II</p>
<p>and to the love and hatred and suffering</p>
<p>that went on there and the corrupting nature of power</p>
<p>and greed and just somehow I just,</p>
<p>that book has taught me more about life</p>
<p>than like anything else.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s just like a silly childlike book</p>
<p>about pigs, I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>it just connects and inspires.</p>
<p>The same, there&rsquo;s a few technical books too</p>
<p>and algorithms that just, yeah, you return to often.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ve been losing that</p>
<p>because of the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been like going on, I&rsquo;ve been going on archive</p>
<p>and blog posts and GitHub and the new thing</p>
<p>and you lose your ability to really master an idea.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a fond memory from childhood?</p>
<p>When baby Russ Tedrick.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I just said that at least my current life</p>
<p>began when I got to MIT.</p>
<p>If I have to go farther than that.</p>
<p>Yeah, what was, was there a life before MIT?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, but let me actually tell you</p>
<p>what happened when I first got to MIT</p>
<p>because that I think might be relevant here,</p>
<p>but I had taken a computer engineering degree at Michigan.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it immensely, learned a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>I liked computers, I liked programming,</p>
<p>but when I did get to MIT and started working</p>
<p>with Sebastian Sung, theoretical physicist,</p>
<p>computational neuroscientist, the culture here</p>
<p>was just different.</p>
<p>It demanded more of me, certainly mathematically</p>
<p>and in the critical thinking.</p>
<p>And I remember the day that I borrowed one of the books</p>
<p>from my advisor&rsquo;s office and walked down</p>
<p>to the Charles River and was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting my butt kicked.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s gonna happen to everybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think I expected you to ask me the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I think that somehow I think that&rsquo;s gotta be part of it.</p>
<p>Doing hard things?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you consider quitting at any point?</p>
<p>Did you consider this isn&rsquo;t for me?</p>
<p>No, never that.</p>
<p>I was working hard, but I was loving it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s this magical thing</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m lucky to surround myself with people</p>
<p>that basically almost every day I&rsquo;ll see something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be told something or something that I realize,</p>
<p>wow, I don&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>And if I could just understand that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something else to learn.</p>
<p>That if I could just learn that thing,</p>
<p>I would connect another piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>And I think that is just such an important aspect</p>
<p>and being willing to understand what you can and can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>and loving the journey of going</p>
<p>and learning those other things.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the best part.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it, Russ.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been an inspiration to me since I showed up at MIT.</p>
<p>Your work has been an inspiration to the world.</p>
<p>This conversation was amazing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do next</p>
<p>with robotics, home robots.</p>
<p>I hope to see you work in my home one day.</p>
<p>So thanks so much for talking today, it&rsquo;s been awesome.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Neil deGrasse Tyson talking about robots in space</p>
<p>and the emphasis we humans put</p>
<p>on human based space exploration.</p>
<p>Robots are important.</p>
<p>If I don my pure scientist hat,</p>
<p>I would say just send robots.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stay down here and get the data.</p>
<p>But nobody&rsquo;s ever given a parade for a robot.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s ever named a high school after a robot.</p>
<p>So when I don my public educator hat,</p>
<p>I have to recognize the elements of exploration</p>
<p>that excite people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only the discoveries and the beautiful photos</p>
<p>that come down from the heavens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the vicarious participation in discovery itself.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
