    <p>Our card this week is Bobby Joe Fritz,</p>
<p>the five of spades from Wisconsin.</p>
<p>When five-year-old Bobby Joe vanished</p>
<p>one afternoon in the early 80s,</p>
<p>no one suspected right away that he&rsquo;d been abducted</p>
<p>because stuff like that just didn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>in his tiny hometown.</p>
<p>But as days went by without any sign of the little boy,</p>
<p>the clues started to point to a worst case scenario</p>
<p>and revealed something much more sinister going on</p>
<p>in Northern Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>On May 14th, 1983, in the small Northern Wisconsin village</p>
<p>of Campbellsport, 10-year-old Cinda Fritz</p>
<p>and her five-year-old brother Bobby Joe</p>
<p>were out playing kickball with some neighborhood kids.</p>
<p>It was a Saturday afternoon,</p>
<p>and the group was playing in an empty field</p>
<p>across from East Main Street,</p>
<p>where Cinda and Bobby Joe lived.</p>
<p>The kids played there all the time</p>
<p>because the field was close enough to their row of houses</p>
<p>that most of their parents</p>
<p>could step outside their front doors and see them.</p>
<p>But Campbellsport, especially back in the 80s,</p>
<p>was one of those small Midwestern towns</p>
<p>where all the kids roamed wherever they felt like it</p>
<p>until it was time to go home for dinner.</p>
<p>This is how Fond du Lac County Sheriff&rsquo;s Detective</p>
<p>Eric Mullenbach describes it.</p>
<p>Campbellsport&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>Everybody knows everybody, literally.</p>
<p>So even back then, you know, you could say,</p>
<p>hey, that&rsquo;s the Smiths, you know, they&rsquo;re 12 doors down</p>
<p>and they drive, you know, a green car</p>
<p>and basically know their movements</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a small town.</p>
<p>May 14th was a nice spring day</p>
<p>and the kids played kickball for hours that afternoon.</p>
<p>But around 4.30 p.m., Cinda&rsquo;s brother Bobby Joe</p>
<p>asked her to take him home because he was hungry</p>
<p>and he wanted a snack.</p>
<p>Since Cinda was five years older than Bobby,</p>
<p>he became her responsibility when they were out playing.</p>
<p>So Cinda walked him toward home.</p>
<p>She stopped just short of their house,</p>
<p>but she watched as her little brother</p>
<p>made it to the end of their mom&rsquo;s driveway</p>
<p>about 30 feet from their front door.</p>
<p>They waved goodbye and Cinda went to join back in</p>
<p>on the kickball game.</p>
<p>Cinda arrived back to the house about an hour later</p>
<p>to wash up in time for dinner.</p>
<p>And she was taken aback almost immediately</p>
<p>when her mom asked her where Bobby Joe was.</p>
<p>Cinda said, I brought him home an hour ago.</p>
<p>But Cinda&rsquo;s mom, Sharon, just looked confused.</p>
<p>She said she never saw Bobby Joe come inside.</p>
<p>At first, Sharon thought maybe Bobby Joe had snuck by her.</p>
<p>You see, Sharon was a newly single mom</p>
<p>with four of her six kids under one roof.</p>
<p>She had recently divorced from their father, Robert,</p>
<p>and he had moved to Illinois with two of their older sons.</p>
<p>So it was a lively household and not uncommon for Sharon</p>
<p>not to have eyes on all four kids at all times.</p>
<p>So Cinda, Sharon, and the two other kids, Todd and Laura,</p>
<p>started searching the house for Bobby Joe at 5.30.</p>
<p>They shouted his name and looked in the closets</p>
<p>and under the beds to see if he was hiding,</p>
<p>but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>So they expanded their search outside</p>
<p>and looked in the yard.</p>
<p>Some neighbors heard the Fritz&rsquo;s yelling out for Bobby Joe</p>
<p>and got worried, so they joined in.</p>
<p>It was one of them who suggested</p>
<p>they alert the sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>And at 5.37 p.m., a neighbor called</p>
<p>the Fond du Lac County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>and reported Bobby Joe missing.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m happy to tell you,</p>
<p>this is not one of those stories</p>
<p>where police were dismissive and said,</p>
<p>oh, just give it a few days, he&rsquo;ll probably show back up.</p>
<p>Deputies responded right away</p>
<p>and joined in the search for Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, there were teams of people</p>
<p>looking all over the neighborhood for the five-year-old.</p>
<p>Not long into their search,</p>
<p>someone found a toy gun</p>
<p>near the edge of the Milwaukee River</p>
<p>in a field where the kids had been playing kickball,</p>
<p>which butts up to the riverbank.</p>
<p>A neighbor said he had seen Bobby Joe</p>
<p>with a toy gun in the past,</p>
<p>so they were pretty sure it was his,</p>
<p>though none of the kids could recall</p>
<p>if Bobby Joe had had it with him earlier that day.</p>
<p>Because they found the toy so close to the river,</p>
<p>investigators worried Bobby Joe</p>
<p>might have somehow wandered back here on his own</p>
<p>and fallen in the water.</p>
<p>They were especially worried about this</p>
<p>because of an incident that happened a few weeks earlier.</p>
<p>The family told Fond du Lac County deputies</p>
<p>that Bobby Joe had been playing outside</p>
<p>and fell in the water,</p>
<p>but a bigger kid was able to grab him and get him out.</p>
<p>Now, the river in that spot isn&rsquo;t super deep</p>
<p>because it flows south into a pond with a dam</p>
<p>before narrowing again.</p>
<p>And that was comforting at first,</p>
<p>because A, they knew they had a really good chance</p>
<p>of finding him in that immediate area</p>
<p>if he had gone in the water,</p>
<p>and B, if he&rsquo;d fallen in that exact spot,</p>
<p>he likely would have been able to get out safely on his own.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office called out the rescue squad,</p>
<p>and by 6.30 p.m., there was a full-scale search underway</p>
<p>in the Milwaukee River.</p>
<p>Detective Mullenbach wasn&rsquo;t part</p>
<p>of the search team back then,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s working the case today</p>
<p>and has reviewed every piece of paperwork</p>
<p>associated with it.</p>
<p>That was thoroughly searched,</p>
<p>with boats walking in the water,</p>
<p>with poles poking everywhere.</p>
<p>You know, if there was something underwater</p>
<p>where the rocks created a little cavern or something,</p>
<p>all that was scuba divers and the dive team.</p>
<p>Because of the dam and the way the river flows,</p>
<p>Detective Mullenbach said it would be nearly impossible</p>
<p>for someone, even a child, to have fallen in</p>
<p>and not be spit out downstream,</p>
<p>unless he was able to get out of the water himself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the belief, that he&rsquo;d have been washed downstream.</p>
<p>And it gets narrow, so those are all farm fields.</p>
<p>And, you know, brush hanging over the shorelines</p>
<p>at some point, he&rsquo;d have got caught up in some brush</p>
<p>and either a deer hunter or some type of hunter or farmer</p>
<p>would have seen something in the water.</p>
<p>The dive team kept searching the water until dark,</p>
<p>at which point the Fritz family had to go home panicked,</p>
<p>thinking about the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>The next day, the water searches continued</p>
<p>while deputies questioned Bobby Joe&rsquo;s family and neighbors.</p>
<p>They wanted to find out if anything strange</p>
<p>had happened before Bobby Joe vanished.</p>
<p>They had a yard sale earlier that day,</p>
<p>Cinda did, she didn&rsquo;t sell anything,</p>
<p>so there wasn&rsquo;t anybody suspicious hanging around</p>
<p>or any suspicious vehicles.</p>
<p>A neighbor was talked to, and at some point during that day,</p>
<p>he had seen Bobby Joe playing by some water</p>
<p>earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Though everything seemed to lead back to the water,</p>
<p>divers still hadn&rsquo;t found Bobby Joe</p>
<p>or any sign of his clothing.</p>
<p>So investigators started to wonder</p>
<p>if he could have been abducted.</p>
<p>They canvassed the neighborhood</p>
<p>to see if anyone else had noticed any suspicious people</p>
<p>or cars in Campbell&rsquo;s Port on Saturday, but no one had.</p>
<p>And everyone who knew Bobby Joe</p>
<p>said he wouldn&rsquo;t willingly have gone anywhere</p>
<p>with a stranger.</p>
<p>I had read some interview reports</p>
<p>that he probably wouldn&rsquo;t go up to somebody,</p>
<p>and especially men.</p>
<p>He was just very shy.</p>
<p>Detective Momenbach said the old reports from the 80s</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t super detailed about the interviews police</p>
<p>back then conducted with Bobby Joe&rsquo;s family members,</p>
<p>but Sharon did say that she was concerned</p>
<p>about her ex-husband.</p>
<p>The reports don&rsquo;t indicate anything suspicious</p>
<p>or rumor mill,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just not what they did back then.</p>
<p>And even now, we don&rsquo;t really put rumor</p>
<p>or anything that we can&rsquo;t verify in the reports.</p>
<p>But Mom had a suspicion that maybe, you know,</p>
<p>Robert took him, Robert Sr.</p>
<p>According to old police reports,</p>
<p>Sharon had tried to contact her ex-husband</p>
<p>on the Saturday Bobby Joe went missing,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;d been out.</p>
<p>And then when she did finally get in touch with him</p>
<p>on Sunday, he was a little dismissive of the situation.</p>
<p>The best way detectives today describe it</p>
<p>is Sharon figured Robert would hop in the car</p>
<p>and come up to Wisconsin to help search for their son,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>After two days of unsuccessful searching,</p>
<p>deputies knew it was time to alert</p>
<p>some neighboring police agencies</p>
<p>about Bobby Joe&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>They sent out some bulletins,</p>
<p>stapled flyers up at local businesses,</p>
<p>and alerted the local press.</p>
<p>And before they knew it,</p>
<p>calls were coming in about alleged sightings of Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>He was saw in Wyoming.</p>
<p>He was seen in Kansas, you know, things like that.</p>
<p>So a lot of phone calls back then,</p>
<p>a lot of requests for other agencies,</p>
<p>you know, just letting them know.</p>
<p>And that was through a system in the computer system</p>
<p>back then that it would come out on a teletype,</p>
<p>a little paragraph like,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s a boy missing from Kalisper, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s his description.</p>
<p>By the time Monday rolled around</p>
<p>and Bobby Joe had been missing for two full days,</p>
<p>everyone in town had heard about his disappearance.</p>
<p>Calls continued to come in with theories</p>
<p>about what people thought happened to Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>And over the next week,</p>
<p>as divers continued searching the Milwaukee River,</p>
<p>the dam, and a nearby pond,</p>
<p>deputies worked to follow all possible leads.</p>
<p>Efforts were made for FBI agents</p>
<p>to interview Bobby Joe&rsquo;s dad in Illinois.</p>
<p>And though there aren&rsquo;t a ton of details</p>
<p>about what Robert Sr. told law enforcement,</p>
<p>they did find out that he got remarried</p>
<p>on the weekend following his son&rsquo;s disappearance,</p>
<p>which some people found suspicious.</p>
<p>But agents didn&rsquo;t find Bobby Joe</p>
<p>at his dad&rsquo;s house in Illinois.</p>
<p>So while the timing of his wedding</p>
<p>made them scratch their heads,</p>
<p>he was pretty much ruled out as a suspect.</p>
<p>As deputies continued to interview everyone</p>
<p>who knew the young boy,</p>
<p>they heard concerns from his teachers about his home life.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that mom had drank periodically.</p>
<p>She would show up to school</p>
<p>if she showed up for an appointment,</p>
<p>if she showed up.</p>
<p>And sometimes she would show up</p>
<p>and teachers or school staff would feel</p>
<p>that she may have been intoxicated.</p>
<p>The kids missed quite a bit of school.</p>
<p>Some of the older kids would miss</p>
<p>anywhere from 40 to 60 days a year.</p>
<p>The school would offer help</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily taken by mom.</p>
<p>They offered to go home to the house</p>
<p>and help the kids along and teach</p>
<p>because Bobby Joe had a little speech impediment</p>
<p>a little bit, you know, the language teacher,</p>
<p>just to help the kids along.</p>
<p>And she was just dismissive.</p>
<p>Yeah, if I recall correctly,</p>
<p>the report said, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to be home, we&rsquo;re busy.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s all from what I read in the reports.</p>
<p>I want to be clear that police said</p>
<p>the teacher&rsquo;s concerns were about the children&rsquo;s absences</p>
<p>and there were never any accusations of neglect</p>
<p>or anything against Sharon.</p>
<p>Part of me wants to cut her some slack</p>
<p>because she had just gone through</p>
<p>what police called a bitter divorce</p>
<p>and was on her own with four small kids.</p>
<p>But of course, deputies had to rule her out</p>
<p>as a person of interest, which they did.</p>
<p>By early June, Wisconsin State investigators</p>
<p>had gotten involved in the search for Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>And they sent the Civil Air Patrol</p>
<p>out to conduct the first aerial search of Campbell&rsquo;s Port,</p>
<p>which focused on a five-mile radius of the Milwaukee River.</p>
<p>The air crew searched for 10 hours</p>
<p>and videoed their efforts</p>
<p>so investigators could have a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the area</p>
<p>in case they could spot anything</p>
<p>that was missed from the water searches.</p>
<p>But even they came out of it empty-handed.</p>
<p>In a June 13th, 1983 article</p>
<p>in the Fond du Lac Commonwealth Reporter,</p>
<p>the sheriff at the time was quoted as saying</p>
<p>he was frustrated by his department&rsquo;s inability</p>
<p>to make headway in the case.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t a day or night that goes by</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t think about him.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to find him, end quote.</p>
<p>I think the reason they were so frustrated</p>
<p>was because there were only a couple ways</p>
<p>in and out of Campbell&rsquo;s Port.</p>
<p>And so many people involved in the initial search</p>
<p>for Bobby Joe fully expected to have found him</p>
<p>within a couple of days.</p>
<p>But as days turned into months,</p>
<p>all they could do was keep up</p>
<p>the weekly river searches for Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>No one knew what else to do.</p>
<p>In July, 1983,</p>
<p>the Fond du Lac Commonwealth Reporter ran a story</p>
<p>about how Bobby Joe&rsquo;s sixth birthday was approaching.</p>
<p>And with each passing day,</p>
<p>the Fritz family&rsquo;s hope at finding him alive was fading.</p>
<p>Bobby Joe&rsquo;s mom, Sharon, told the newspaper</p>
<p>that her son had asked for a fish tank</p>
<p>and a real fish for his sixth birthday.</p>
<p>And she hoped her son would be found</p>
<p>so she could buy him that fish as a gift.</p>
<p>In that same article,</p>
<p>Sharon said that friends and family members</p>
<p>were working to pass around flyers about Bobby Joe</p>
<p>to long-haul truck drivers so they could spread the word.</p>
<p>The flyers described Bobby Joe as five years old, blonde,</p>
<p>with a red birthmark on his left leg</p>
<p>and a speech impediment.</p>
<p>Sharon shared with the newspaper</p>
<p>that she was having trouble sleeping at night</p>
<p>and would sit up and just cry,</p>
<p>thinking about what could have happened to her little boy.</p>
<p>She also said that some of her other kids</p>
<p>were getting counseling</p>
<p>because they were having such a hard time</p>
<p>dealing with Bobby Joe&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>According to that newspaper&rsquo;s same reporting,</p>
<p>Sharon even wrote a letter to the president at the time,</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>She told Reagan in her letter</p>
<p>that there were 50,000 kids abducted</p>
<p>in the United States every year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anything you can do</p>
<p>to help us parents of missing children?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any reports about whether or not</p>
<p>the Fritz family ever heard back from the White House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in the spring of 1984,</p>
<p>an entire year after Bobby Joe went missing,</p>
<p>deputies received a tip</p>
<p>that not only had the potential</p>
<p>to break the case wide open,</p>
<p>but pointed them to something much darker</p>
<p>going on in their community.</p>
<p>A couple in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin,</p>
<p>decided to visit a brand new art gallery in Waldo,</p>
<p>a tiny village about 25 minutes east of Campbellsport.</p>
<p>But instead of finding art</p>
<p>that they might wanna purchase</p>
<p>to hang on their walls at home,</p>
<p>they found paintings that creeped them out.</p>
<p>The paintings looked to be of young boys in their underwear.</p>
<p>And the fact that the gallery owner and artist himself</p>
<p>was a 30-something man creeped them out even more.</p>
<p>They were about to leave</p>
<p>when they spotted an article on a table in the gallery.</p>
<p>It was one of the articles about Bobby Joe&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>that featured a photo of him.</p>
<p>And it was near a painting</p>
<p>that looked like it could be of Bobby Joe,</p>
<p>except the face was obscured.</p>
<p>This gave the couple chills.</p>
<p>They got out of there as fast as they could</p>
<p>and called police to report everything they&rsquo;d seen.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Detective,</p>
<p>Kevin Whitlinger, who works the case today</p>
<p>alongside Detective Mullenbach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure who that couple is or where they&rsquo;re from.</p>
<p>It became known to law enforcement that,</p>
<p>hey, this guy has these articles out of this boy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s missing and he has this weird artwork of young boys</p>
<p>in these, I would call, skimpy swimsuits.</p>
<p>The Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>connected with deputies in Fond du Lac County about the tip,</p>
<p>which kicked off a deep dive into the gallery owner.</p>
<p>They found out the man was 35-year-old Michael Menzer,</p>
<p>a former teacher and swim coach</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d been arrested for sexual assault</p>
<p>and fired from the Sheboygan school system in 1980.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he had a reputation there yet,</p>
<p>but he left the city sometime after being arrested in 1980</p>
<p>for the molestation of other children.</p>
<p>After Menzer&rsquo;s arrest,</p>
<p>he was released from jail on a signature bond,</p>
<p>meaning he didn&rsquo;t have to pay any bail money.</p>
<p>And according to old news reports in the Sheboygan press,</p>
<p>he was later placed on probation</p>
<p>after pleading no contest in the sexual assault case.</p>
<p>But he lost his teaching and coaching jobs</p>
<p>as well as his volunteer position</p>
<p>at Big Brothers Big Sisters.</p>
<p>Police also found out that Menzer bought the art gallery,</p>
<p>which was also his house, in Waldo in 1981.</p>
<p>But the research also revealed Menzer had a wife</p>
<p>and a couple of stepkids.</p>
<p>So to some, he appeared to have cleaned up his act</p>
<p>after his 1980 arrest.</p>
<p>But the more police looked into it,</p>
<p>they realized the Menzer family dynamic was complex.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even clear if the kids and wife</p>
<p>lived at the Waldo Art Gallery with him.</p>
<p>And it was in a rural area,</p>
<p>so neighbors weren&rsquo;t sure what went on there.</p>
<p>But considering Menzer&rsquo;s criminal history</p>
<p>and the fact that he lived just 25 minutes</p>
<p>from where Bobby Joe went missing,</p>
<p>deputies were thinking, this has to be our guy.</p>
<p>If they wanted to find Bobby Joe, if he was still alive,</p>
<p>they had to be very careful</p>
<p>with their next steps in the investigation.</p>
<p>As they started writing a search warrant</p>
<p>for Menzer&rsquo;s art gallery and attached house,</p>
<p>rumors started to swirl</p>
<p>and deputies got another disturbing phone call.</p>
<p>It was from a parent of a young boy</p>
<p>who said Michael Menzer</p>
<p>had made their son pose naked for pictures.</p>
<p>That was all police needed to hear</p>
<p>to launch a full-blown investigation into this guy,</p>
<p>who was obviously still preying on young boys.</p>
<p>In June of 1984, investigators executed a search warrant</p>
<p>at Menzer&rsquo;s property, hoping to either find Bobby Joe</p>
<p>or his remains or some clue</p>
<p>that would tell them that he&rsquo;d been there.</p>
<p>Instead, they found an enormous amount of evidence</p>
<p>that convinced them their suspect</p>
<p>needed to be behind bars</p>
<p>for crimes relating to other children.</p>
<p>In Menzer&rsquo;s gallery and home,</p>
<p>police found child sex abuse materials,</p>
<p>books and brochures showing young boys,</p>
<p>an article about child sex abuse materials</p>
<p>and First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>They also found several pairs of little boys&rsquo; swimsuits,</p>
<p>photography equipment, photos of nude boys,</p>
<p>chains and manacles and legal model releases</p>
<p>for parents to sign to allow Menzer</p>
<p>to photograph their children.</p>
<p>Police also found a wooden box with a lock on it</p>
<p>containing more child abuse materials,</p>
<p>with a note on it signed by Menzer that said,</p>
<p>quote, at my death, please destroy by fire</p>
<p>this box and everything in it without opening it,</p>
<p>please, end quote.</p>
<p>They also found the article that the couple had seen</p>
<p>about Bobby Joe&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>and the paintings and other disturbing articles.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Mullenbach again.</p>
<p>Untimely deaths of, you know,</p>
<p>three children in Waukesha County was suffocated,</p>
<p>two young people that were killed in a traffic crash,</p>
<p>child that was ran over by a car</p>
<p>and a bizarre clipping, you know,</p>
<p>from wherever it was in the country,</p>
<p>you know, a child being placed in an oven by a mother.</p>
<p>So just odd paper clippings</p>
<p>and a lot of negatives of photos of kids,</p>
<p>young kids dating back to 1968</p>
<p>when Menzer had graduated college and began teaching.</p>
<p>Detectives shared some photos of Menzer&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and the G-rated photos of their evidence with us.</p>
<p>So you can actually see those on thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Detective Wittlinger said Menzer later made up excuses</p>
<p>about why he had the news articles in his house.</p>
<p>So he was questioning about the articles.</p>
<p>I said, well, how come you had these newspaper articles?</p>
<p>And he stated the one where the child was placed</p>
<p>into an oven that he got from when he was in college</p>
<p>for some sort of project that he was working on then.</p>
<p>But on the article written in grease pencil</p>
<p>is the date of 83.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know when that article actually was published,</p>
<p>but I would have a hard time thinking that&rsquo;s an article</p>
<p>that he retained from 1970.</p>
<p>And then the one with Bobby Joe Fritz,</p>
<p>he said he saved that</p>
<p>because he wanted to talk to his wife about child safety</p>
<p>because their kids were always running around</p>
<p>and it was near a highway in a rural area,</p>
<p>just like Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>So he wanted to talk to her.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t say he did.</p>
<p>He says, I wanted to talk to her about child safety</p>
<p>and show her that these things are possible</p>
<p>and this happens.</p>
<p>One of the last pieces of evidence</p>
<p>police found at the house was a calendar.</p>
<p>It caught their attention</p>
<p>because someone had put a red star sticker on May 14th, 1983.</p>
<p>That is the day that Bobby Joe vanished.</p>
<p>After seeing that, police were more convinced than ever</p>
<p>that Menzer had something to do</p>
<p>with the little boy&rsquo;s abduction,</p>
<p>but there was no sign of Bobby Joe at Menzer&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>When he was interviewed about the star on May 14th,</p>
<p>Menzer said it had something to do</p>
<p>with his stepson&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>He dismissed that saying it had something to do</p>
<p>with one of the boy&rsquo;s birthdays,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think any of the boys are born on the 14th.</p>
<p>It appeared in a way it&rsquo;s written</p>
<p>that it was a flippant response.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It probably had to do with,</p>
<p>I think it was Kyle that was born in May.</p>
<p>Probably had something to do with Kyle&rsquo;s birthday,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s nothing else written there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally just the star not going out to dinner</p>
<p>or party or call the grandparents or anything like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, oh, I think that probably had something to do</p>
<p>with Kyle&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>Police arrested the 35-year-old</p>
<p>and charged him with sexual exploitation of a child.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Sheboygan Press,</p>
<p>he saw a judge on June 30th of 84</p>
<p>and his bail was set at $10,000.</p>
<p>But weeks later, Menzer pled not guilty,</p>
<p>demanded a jury trial,</p>
<p>and was allowed to post a $15,000 property bond</p>
<p>in place of his $10,000 cash bond,</p>
<p>and he was released from jail.</p>
<p>The news of Menzer&rsquo;s arrest opened the floodgates.</p>
<p>Other parents were calling in,</p>
<p>saying their children had also been abused by Menzer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you the details,</p>
<p>but it was enough for them to tack</p>
<p>on several more counts of exploitation.</p>
<p>After he made bail in 1984,</p>
<p>Menzer&rsquo;s wife, Grace, told investigators</p>
<p>that he spent an afternoon burning stuff</p>
<p>and erected a huge cross behind his Waldo property</p>
<p>and kept flowers at the base of it.</p>
<p>Despite police being convinced</p>
<p>Menzer abducted Bobby Joe Fritz,</p>
<p>they had no actual evidence tying him to it,</p>
<p>except for that article</p>
<p>and a star on the calendar being suspicious.</p>
<p>So they continued their investigative efforts</p>
<p>while Menzer went on with his life</p>
<p>while he was out on bond awaiting trial.</p>
<p>But calls about Bobby Joe slowed down.</p>
<p>The next year in 1985,</p>
<p>a psychic called the Fond du Lac County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>and said Bobby Joe was being held captive</p>
<p>in a park in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The psychic must have been convincing,</p>
<p>or maybe police just didn&rsquo;t want any tip to go ignored</p>
<p>because Wisconsin deputies called up</p>
<p>the Royal Canadian Mounted Police</p>
<p>and asked them to respond to this park</p>
<p>where the psychic had her vision.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t find Bobby Joe</p>
<p>or any other suspicious activity there.</p>
<p>The next call they got though</p>
<p>pointed them in a more believable direction,</p>
<p>right back at Menzer.</p>
<p>A man called police to report</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;d heard about Menzer&rsquo;s arrest</p>
<p>and he realized that he&rsquo;d been in Menzer&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>in January of 1984 and saw something weird in the basement.</p>
<p>The man said that he had considered purchasing a turbine</p>
<p>that Menzer listed for sale</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d gone to the Waldo property to see it.</p>
<p>The man said that he got to the bottom</p>
<p>of the basement stairs and there was some plastic</p>
<p>and what appeared to be some kind of shrine in the corner.</p>
<p>He also said that if you walked far enough into the basement</p>
<p>the concrete floor turned to dirt</p>
<p>where there was then a hole in the ground,</p>
<p>six feet long and five feet deep, like a grave.</p>
<p>He said he looked in the hole</p>
<p>but it was empty.</p>
<p>This was incredibly frustrating for police to hear</p>
<p>because this was just another thing that was fishy as hell.</p>
<p>But no matter how many tips like this came in,</p>
<p>no matter how many other crimes</p>
<p>against children he was accused of,</p>
<p>there was just nothing physical tying him to Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>By 1986, most hope about Bobby Joe</p>
<p>still being found alive was gone.</p>
<p>In June, Menzer was finally convicted</p>
<p>of the unrelated exploitation charges</p>
<p>and given a year of County jail time with probation</p>
<p>and a possible prison sentence of four and a half years</p>
<p>if he violated his parole.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna let that just sink in for a minute</p>
<p>because it made me sick to my stomach</p>
<p>when I learned about it,</p>
<p>especially because he ended up getting out of jail</p>
<p>within a couple of months</p>
<p>and then he went off the grid for several years.</p>
<p>Despite the FBI getting involved</p>
<p>in trying to put pressure on Menzer to confess</p>
<p>or lead investigators to Bobby Joe&rsquo;s body, he never did.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time when he&rsquo;s spoken to,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s by locals.</p>
<p>It would have been state or federal agents</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just kind of brought up</p>
<p>and he says, I actually think he says,</p>
<p>oh yeah, no one&rsquo;s ever really asked me about that</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with those kids.</p>
<p>After laying low for a few years,</p>
<p>Menzer filed divorce papers on his wife in 1989.</p>
<p>In September, 1990, Menzer called the school counselor</p>
<p>for his son and two step-sons and asked out of the blue</p>
<p>if she could tell whether or not the boys</p>
<p>had been sexually molested.</p>
<p>According to police reports, the counselor said,</p>
<p>yes, that can be determined through counseling.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Menzer&rsquo;s divorce was finalized</p>
<p>and his wife Grace got full custody of all three kids.</p>
<p>She later discloses that he almost immediately</p>
<p>within a few months starts molesting his stepkids now.</p>
<p>So now he has access again to children</p>
<p>until he loses them at divorce.</p>
<p>According to detectives, Grace told police</p>
<p>that she had threatened Menzer in the past</p>
<p>to turn him in for molesting their kids.</p>
<p>But she said that he would threaten her back,</p>
<p>usually saying that their marriage was the only thing</p>
<p>keeping her a legal resident in the US.</p>
<p>Three days after their divorce was finalized,</p>
<p>this was September 17th, 1990,</p>
<p>the same day as the kids&rsquo; next scheduled counseling session,</p>
<p>someone set the Waldo Art Gallery and home on fire.</p>
<p>Now by then, Menzer and Grace</p>
<p>were still working on separating completely.</p>
<p>So Grace and the kids were staying at the Waldo house</p>
<p>and police believe Menzer was staying somewhere else,</p>
<p>either his parents&rsquo; lake house</p>
<p>or at his mom&rsquo;s primary house in Sheboygan.</p>
<p>The fire started at 4 a.m.</p>
<p>when Grace and the three boys were all asleep.</p>
<p>The fire killed two of the children,</p>
<p>but Grace and their five-year-old</p>
<p>escaped by jumping from a three-story window.</p>
<p>Despite Menzer being the main suspect</p>
<p>for the arson and murders,</p>
<p>police had no physical evidence tying him to it.</p>
<p>So he wasn&rsquo;t immediately arrested or charged with anything.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, an insurance representative said</p>
<p>Menzer had contacted her agency about filing a claim</p>
<p>and Menzer had asked some weird questions.</p>
<p>He wanted to know specifically</p>
<p>if the basement would be dug up.</p>
<p>Menzer asking about the basement</p>
<p>was enough for police to be granted another search warrant</p>
<p>for the basement of Menzer&rsquo;s charred home</p>
<p>and former art gallery,</p>
<p>in addition to a family cabin that he frequented</p>
<p>at nearby Elkhart Lake.</p>
<p>Police executed the search warrants in October, 1990.</p>
<p>And during the search at his family&rsquo;s cottage at the lake,</p>
<p>police found a peephole in the wall of a room</p>
<p>that was used by men and boys to change into their swimwear.</p>
<p>But as far as evidence goes,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t find much else at the cottage.</p>
<p>Detectives said Menzer had access to the lake house</p>
<p>and would use it when he knew other family members</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t going to be there.</p>
<p>Back in Waldo, Menzer&rsquo;s art gallery and house</p>
<p>sat right on the Milwaukee River.</p>
<p>So police got rescue teams out to search the water too.</p>
<p>They dragged the area directly behind Menzer&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>looking for human remains, clothing, or anything</p>
<p>that could sink to the bottom of the water</p>
<p>that he could have used to hide human remains.</p>
<p>Then in the basement of the Waldo house,</p>
<p>police dug up the entire basement</p>
<p>and discovered children&rsquo;s clothing under a concrete slab.</p>
<p>They also found bones.</p>
<p>But the thing is, none of the clothing they found</p>
<p>matched what Bobby Joe was wearing the day he went missing.</p>
<p>So investigators wondered if maybe they just discovered</p>
<p>the remains of another unknown victim.</p>
<p>But according to Detective Wittlinger,</p>
<p>an anthropologist examined the bones</p>
<p>and determined that they were from an animal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nowhere in the reports</p>
<p>does it say how that determination was made</p>
<p>or what animal the anthropologist</p>
<p>thought the bones belonged to.</p>
<p>Menzer remained the only suspect in the arson</p>
<p>that killed his stepkids.</p>
<p>So investigators continued looking for evidence</p>
<p>that could prove he did it.</p>
<p>And some people came forward with information</p>
<p>that made Menzer look even more suspicious.</p>
<p>Apparently, before the fire started,</p>
<p>Menzer had told various people that he thought someone</p>
<p>was going to burn down his house and kill his family</p>
<p>because of his reputation as a pedophile.</p>
<p>He also reported a small fire behind his house</p>
<p>in the weeks prior to the deadly blaze.</p>
<p>In hindsight, police think that he had planned the fire</p>
<p>and was kind of planting seeds to make police think</p>
<p>that someone else was out to get him.</p>
<p>So in 1991, Menzer was interviewed by special agents.</p>
<p>This time, they had accusations from Grace</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;d been molesting their children for years.</p>
<p>It was during that interview that Menzer finally admitted</p>
<p>to molesting numerous children in the past,</p>
<p>but he said, not his stepkids,</p>
<p>mostly children he met through volunteering</p>
<p>at the Big Brothers program.</p>
<p>He also didn&rsquo;t admit anything relating to Bobby Joe Fritz.</p>
<p>Combining all the evidence,</p>
<p>interviews with victims, and his confession,</p>
<p>police and prosecutors built a federal case against Menzer,</p>
<p>which took years.</p>
<p>But in 1993, he was convicted of the arson and murders</p>
<p>of his seven and eight-year-old stepsons.</p>
<p>During the trial, according to documents,</p>
<p>a federal jury learned that Menzer had molested</p>
<p>at least 10 boys over the course of his adult life.</p>
<p>In a letter to a federal judge after the conviction,</p>
<p>but before sentencing,</p>
<p>the prosecutor called Menzer a dangerous pedophile</p>
<p>whose crimes escalated over his lifetime.</p>
<p>The attorney said Menzer deserved a harsher punishment</p>
<p>than even the recommended maximum.</p>
<p>And ultimately, he was given 40 years in federal prison.</p>
<p>Bobby Joe&rsquo;s family never stopped missing him</p>
<p>or wondering what happened to him.</p>
<p>Detectives said in 2000,</p>
<p>one of his brothers even moved back to Campbell&rsquo;s Port</p>
<p>as a personal quest to find his brother.</p>
<p>Every so often,</p>
<p>someone would call Wisconsin deputies out of the blue,</p>
<p>thinking that maybe they were Bobby Joe,</p>
<p>but those were ruled out quickly.</p>
<p>Years ago, you know, you would have somebody say,</p>
<p>hey, I think I&rsquo;m Bobby Joe,</p>
<p>or somebody thinks,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s a kid, I think it&rsquo;s Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>And then the detectives would just touch base</p>
<p>with that person, and the first thing is,</p>
<p>birthmark on your thigh, no, okay.</p>
<p>Menzer died in a federal prison in Maryland in 2008</p>
<p>when he was 58 years old.</p>
<p>He never confessed to anything related to Bobby Joe</p>
<p>or revealed any information related to the case.</p>
<p>Police in Wisconsin said they wished</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d been able to interview him</p>
<p>one last time before his death,</p>
<p>but because he was in federal custody,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even know that he was sick with cancer.</p>
<p>In 2010, police finally dug out</p>
<p>some of the old evidence,</p>
<p>the clothes that they had found under concrete</p>
<p>in Menzer&rsquo;s basement,</p>
<p>and they submitted them for DNA.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve swabbed some of Bobby Joe&rsquo;s family members</p>
<p>to try and see if anything matches,</p>
<p>which would at least tell them</p>
<p>if Bobby Joe was ever in Menzer&rsquo;s home,</p>
<p>but they haven&rsquo;t gotten any matches yet.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t gotten any hits on the clothing</p>
<p>for other DNA profiles related</p>
<p>to other missing or murdered children either,</p>
<p>but detectives are hoping to work</p>
<p>with the Wisconsin state agents</p>
<p>to use genealogy resources.</p>
<p>Even if the clothes were not Bobby Joe&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>they had to have belonged to someone,</p>
<p>and detectives worry that the clothes</p>
<p>might belong to another unknown or unidentified victim.</p>
<p>Over the years, there have been small updates</p>
<p>here and there.</p>
<p>In 2012, as part of a public works project in Campbellsport,</p>
<p>local officials needed to drain the old pond</p>
<p>to reconfigure how the Milwaukee River flows there,</p>
<p>so they took it as an opportunity</p>
<p>to do another thorough search</p>
<p>for any signs of Bobby Joe&rsquo;s remains or clothing,</p>
<p>but it turned up nothing.</p>
<p>In 2013, the National Center</p>
<p>for Missing and Exploited Children</p>
<p>released an age-progressed photo of Bobby Joe</p>
<p>to drum up some new publicity in hopes of new leads.</p>
<p>The poster featured a real photo of Bobby Joe</p>
<p>on the left at five years old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the usual school photo,</p>
<p>and the blonde little boy is looking just off camera</p>
<p>and smiling in a red collared shirt.</p>
<p>His age-progressed photo shows what they think Bobby Joe</p>
<p>would have looked like at 27,</p>
<p>his blonde hair a little darker</p>
<p>and face a little bit fuller.</p>
<p>The photo did create some new local publicity,</p>
<p>but it actually didn&rsquo;t lead to any new tips in the case.</p>
<p>So in 2014, detectives submitted more evidence</p>
<p>for DNA testing.</p>
<p>Six hairs were found on some of the old clothing</p>
<p>that had been taken from Menzer&rsquo;s basement,</p>
<p>and one of the strands of hair belongs to a male,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s all we know of now</p>
<p>because more specific testing hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>The Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>is still deciding how to test the hair</p>
<p>without ruining the strand.</p>
<p>It might sound like a long shot, and it is,</p>
<p>but the fact is police don&rsquo;t have much else to work with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take a DNA match or a tip</p>
<p>to physically connect Bobby Joe and Michael Menzer.</p>
<p>And interestingly, in 2008, a tip came in</p>
<p>that detectives thought could have been that missing link.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when one of Michael Menzer&rsquo;s family members</p>
<p>emailed the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>asking if they&rsquo;d ever searched a place</p>
<p>called Grasshopper Hill.</p>
<p>It was near the family cottage at Elkhart Lake,</p>
<p>and that lake is about 20 minutes north of Waldo</p>
<p>where Menzer lived.</p>
<p>This family member said that they all used to go up there</p>
<p>as kids and play in the woods,</p>
<p>and Menzer had secluded access to the hill.</p>
<p>It took the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office a while</p>
<p>to get together the necessary team,</p>
<p>but in the summer and fall of 2021,</p>
<p>detectives with cadaver dogs took to Grasshopper Hill,</p>
<p>which is now a 25-acre preserve,</p>
<p>and their hope was to finally find</p>
<p>the remains of Bobby Joe Fritz.</p>
<p>And they got their hopes up when three different dogs</p>
<p>indicated on a cadaver scent between some trees.</p>
<p>And it goes back and forth between this cedar tree</p>
<p>and this oak tree, and it kind of just does this loop,</p>
<p>looking around, and gets,</p>
<p>even I can see a behavior change in the dog,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s trying to find something,</p>
<p>and it winds up giving a positive indication</p>
<p>between the two trees.</p>
<p>After that, the whole team of people</p>
<p>who are involved in this search are thinking,</p>
<p>this has to be it, this has to be where Bobby Joe is buried.</p>
<p>So they brought in ground-penetrating radar,</p>
<p>which indicated on two areas of possible soil disturbances.</p>
<p>They put together a plan,</p>
<p>and it was not just a hand-to-shovel operation.</p>
<p>On October 18th and 19th of 2021,</p>
<p>members of the Sheboygan County</p>
<p>and Fond du Lac County Sheriff&rsquo;s Departments</p>
<p>and FBI Evidence Recovery Team,</p>
<p>special agents with the Wisconsin Department</p>
<p>of Justice Division of Criminal Investigations,</p>
<p>and a forensic anthropologist,</p>
<p>went back to Grasshopper Hill with heavy machinery.</p>
<p>And they conducted two days of excavation operations,</p>
<p>fully expecting to find the remains of Bobby Joe Fritz.</p>
<p>But there was nothing.</p>
<p>Detectives said it was surprising and frustrating.</p>
<p>After seeing the dogs indicate on a possible grave site</p>
<p>in the area where one of Menzer&rsquo;s relatives</p>
<p>said he frequented,</p>
<p>they thought for sure it was going to be the end</p>
<p>of the decades-long search for Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>The disappointment of not finding his remains</p>
<p>forced them to go back to the beginning</p>
<p>and try to think about things differently.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s tough is the fact that Bobby Joe disappeared</p>
<p>feet from his own door in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Whoever took him did it quietly and without being detected.</p>
<p>Plus, if that did happen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlikely Bobby Joe or his body</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have turned up somewhere near Campbell&rsquo;s Port.</p>
<p>If you had the stranger comes through town</p>
<p>and just happens to get lucky and grabs Bobby Joe,</p>
<p>statistically speaking, they are not keeping Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to do, it&rsquo;s a three-hour window.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to do what they&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to dispose of Bobby Joe.</p>
<p>And when they dispose of him,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s within 250 feet of the roadway somewhere else.</p>
<p>You know, they get off the main road,</p>
<p>they go do their thing.</p>
<p>And within 250 feet of that road</p>
<p>is usually where the body is disposed of.</p>
<p>Bobby Joe has never been found.</p>
<p>Detectives Wittlinger and Bollenbach remain hopeful</p>
<p>that if they continue to test for DNA matches</p>
<p>on every piece of evidence,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll eventually come across Bobby Joe&rsquo;s remains.</p>
<p>And even though their primary suspect is dead,</p>
<p>finding Bobby Joe would at least provide</p>
<p>some answers to his family,</p>
<p>answers that they&rsquo;ve been searching for for decades.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that Bobby Joe&rsquo;s, if he&rsquo;s dead,</p>
<p>his remains are in Cheboygan County.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s nothing that I can find</p>
<p>at Ty&rsquo;s Menzer anywhere else outside of the state.</p>
<p>Bobby Joe Fritz has been missing for 39 years</p>
<p>and his siblings still miss him</p>
<p>and they still wonder what happened.</p>
<p>His parents both passed away</p>
<p>without ever learning what happened to their son.</p>
<p>Bobby Joe would be 44 today if he was still alive.</p>
<p>Investigators in Wisconsin are not going to give up</p>
<p>until they find him.</p>
<p>So if you know anything about the 1983 disappearance</p>
<p>of Bobby Joseph Fritz,</p>
<p>please call the Fond du Lac County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>at 920-906-4777.</p>
