    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>I&rsquo;m getting better at it all the time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at a funeral again.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both in black again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even notice.</p>
<p>The producers always sniff it out.</p>
<p>Jen Morton&rsquo;s coming to the funeral.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re in black too.</p>
<p>One of the producers has joined in.</p>
<p>It is the funeral of I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>I want to air a grievance that I have with you personally.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with you in the sense</p>
<p>that when we&rsquo;re talking on the phone and we hang up,</p>
<p>you always put the burden of the hang up on me.</p>
<p>You never hang up the phone, ever.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just waiting for something brilliant</p>
<p>Typically, I call you on my way to Pickleball.</p>
<p>And so right when I pull up in the parking lot</p>
<p>and put my car in park, I say, OK, I got to go.</p>
<p>I got to go in for Pickleball.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m putting the car in park.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for my Pickleball bag.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, I look down like 10 seconds have passed</p>
<p>and the call&rsquo;s still live.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve noticed it more and more and more</p>
<p>that you unfairly place the hang up burden on me.</p>
<p>Basically, I&rsquo;m carrying 100% of the load.</p>
<p>Terminating the call.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve noticed it.</p>
<p>And I put it on my little list of things</p>
<p>to bring up with you that I&rsquo;m carrying the load of this.</p>
<p>And I want you to know, number one, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Number two, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>OK, I just want to say in response, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>But thank you for bringing it to my attention.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>What have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;ve had it with what I see as a new trend of everyone</p>
<p>wanting to be tipped all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It used to be carhops and servers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Now you go order your food.</p>
<p>You pay for your food while standing at the register.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going to go pick up your food by the time</p>
<p>they have it made for you.</p>
<p>And it says, do you want a tip?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking straight up at the person that you&rsquo;re tipping.</p>
<p>So if you hit no tip, you&rsquo;re just a total fucking twat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But it just seems ridiculous if I&rsquo;m ordering it,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m standing up to pay for it, and I have to pick it up.</p>
<p>The tip question should never be asked.</p>
<p>I went to a bakery to get some cookies the other day.</p>
<p>They have the little glass display.</p>
<p>And I see the cookies with the icing and the sprinkles.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ll take six of those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s her job to put the six cookies in a box, ring me up.</p>
<p>She spins the little checkout thing around.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tip on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outrageous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Botox clinic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tip place at everywhere you go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all built in, this tip.</p>
<p>And then you feel like this asshole,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a huge believer in tipping.</p>
<p>We were both servers, so we are huge tippers.</p>
<p>Great tip, even if the service is shitty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tip big.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tip big despite bad service.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some skirting of the system.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I think is going on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the minimum wage is high enough.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got people living below the poverty line.</p>
<p>And then these corporations that make</p>
<p>all these billions of dollars that also skirt taxes,</p>
<p>because of all the laws that favor corporations and not</p>
<p>individuals, are putting the burden back on us,</p>
<p>where if they would just pay a livable wage,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have to tip out the wazoo all the time.</p>
<p>Agree with all that.</p>
<p>It sounds too complicated for me</p>
<p>to really care about too much.</p>
<p>But I do think the bottom line is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not providing a service, you don&rsquo;t get tipped.</p>
<p>So would you say you&rsquo;re a high information voter</p>
<p>or low information voter?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a high information voter, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to break it down into comparing it to tipping.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re poo-pooing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not poo-pooing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re poo-pooing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>That is bullshit right there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not poo-pooing anyone except the boss.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example, our favorite restaurant</p>
<p>we go to every day, pretty much.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>You stand there, you order, they give you your food.</p>
<p>On occasion, they&rsquo;ll bring it to you.</p>
<p>You have to get your own drink.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>All that.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>So that corporation should pay them more and not ask for a tip.</p>
<p>Tipping everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out of control.</p>
<p>I went to a concession stand at a basketball game.</p>
<p>It was a tip jar.</p>
<p>I worked at a concession stand.</p>
<p>Nobody tipped you.</p>
<p>At Brink Junior High School in Moore, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>And I worked at the little student store.</p>
<p>It was a little concession stand.</p>
<p>I never got a fucking tip.</p>
<p>Back in the day, it would have been unheard of to tip,</p>
<p>to even ask or expect a tip at that.</p>
<p>I feel like this is the last five or 10 years deal.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like the last five.</p>
<p>You tip your nail lady, you tip your hair.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m fine with all those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, if the only service you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is entering what I&rsquo;m getting ready to buy</p>
<p>in the computer that&rsquo;s pre-programmed,</p>
<p>all you have to do is find spinach salad,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a typical action.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>When it comes to restaurants and you&rsquo;re dining out</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a booth, a four-top booth,</p>
<p>and you see a couple, a couple meaning two,</p>
<p>sitting at a four-top booth on the same side,</p>
<p>how do you feel about that?</p>
<p>I immediately fucking hate their guts,</p>
<p>think that they&rsquo;re ridiculous.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason for a couple</p>
<p>to sit on the same side of the booth, ever.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s break it down.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a percentage.</p>
<p>You guys go out to eat, and out of 100% of the time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re seated at a four-top booth,</p>
<p>what is the percentage that y&rsquo;all would sit</p>
<p>on the same side of the booth?</p>
<p>Is it just us?</p>
<p>Two people at a four-top,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the percentage that y&rsquo;all are gonna sit?</p>
<p>50?</p>
<p>Maybe more?</p>
<p>I mean, 100% for the picture to send you guys.</p>
<p>But we like to sit next to each other, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I always think in my mind,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just sitting on the same side to torture us,</p>
<p>but then you go back to being a normal people.</p>
<p>No, we stay, we stay.</p>
<p>You can hold hands while you eat.</p>
<p>You guys should try it sometime, you&rsquo;d love it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You hold hands when you eat?</p>
<p>No, Jen would love to though.</p>
<p>I probably would.</p>
<p>Nellie just going right at her.</p>
<p>So in the vein of all of this,</p>
<p>just gratuitous tipping nonstop,</p>
<p>we are gonna have a guest on today, Mara Davis.</p>
<p>And she has a podcast called Vote Her out of Atlanta.</p>
<p>And she has a lot of very strong opinions.</p>
<p>One in particular about the meal</p>
<p>that people eat on Sundays.</p>
<p>She weighs in on the news like weekly entertainment.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a mover and shaker in hot Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>Hi, Mara.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>So Mary, you know what Pumps and I were just talking about?</p>
<p>And I know a little bird has told me</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got to be up your bonnet on this.</p>
<p>And it is the restaurant culture of,</p>
<p>you got to tip everybody,</p>
<p>everybody going out to lunch on Sundays,</p>
<p>which I hear really gets up your crawl.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you tell us a little bit about that?</p>
<p>Okay, Jennifer and Pumps,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with brunch.</p>
<p>Bottomless mimosa is like, who made that up?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so gross.</p>
<p>I just think of someone without pants on</p>
<p>and like crotch that.</p>
<p>How do you feel about couples</p>
<p>that sit on the same side of the booth?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got two people sitting</p>
<p>on the same side of a four top.</p>
<p>Are you for or against?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, I don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Pumps and I feel homicidal rage when we see it.</p>
<p>Neither one of us are romantic at all.</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>Like if I went on a first date with someone</p>
<p>and he wanted to sit on the same side of the booth,</p>
<p>I would immediately say, peace out.</p>
<p>If Josh and I went to dinner</p>
<p>and he moved over and sat on the same side,</p>
<p>it was like, what the fuck are you doing over there?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I want to talk about.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re going to have some good feedback on this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of shit in the news</p>
<p>about famous Hollywood types that are shitty to waiters,</p>
<p>which I think is the worst.</p>
<p>So tell us what you know about James Corden.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve also heard that Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>is a terrible tipper.</p>
<p>Rachel Ray, Johnny Depp and George Clooney</p>
<p>are rumored to be some of the nicest.</p>
<p>And also, of course, Harry Styles</p>
<p>and the most darling man on the planet, Barack Obama,</p>
<p>is rumored to be the nicest customer and the best tipper,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s no surprise to anyone.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about the misbehaving, bad James Corden.</p>
<p>So he got a lot of shit</p>
<p>because he was eating at Baltazar in New York City.</p>
<p>And you ladies have probably been to Baltazar, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s downtown and it&rsquo;s super chic.</p>
<p>The tables are very close together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there many times and the service</p>
<p>is always excellent, but he was very particular</p>
<p>about his omelet and kept sending it back</p>
<p>and kind of terrorized the staff.</p>
<p>And then the owner of the restaurant went public with it</p>
<p>and put it on Instagram and basically said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve terrorized my staff, don&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>And I thought this was really great.</p>
<p>He has a reputation, he definitely does.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always the people who are like the nice,</p>
<p>known as the nice people.</p>
<p>And so he had a reputation.</p>
<p>Now he apologized, they let him back in,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s gonna haunt him forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of great.</p>
<p>Okay, I have two questions on that.</p>
<p>I love the fact that the owner came out</p>
<p>and shamed him publicly.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>But how do you send back an omelet multiple times?</p>
<p>I mean, even I can make an omelet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of, do you know who I am situation.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what a particular psycho</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m married to in restaurants.</p>
<p>So, you know, y&rsquo;all know Josh</p>
<p>and we go to a Mexican restaurant and you know,</p>
<p>the Tex-Mex style where they immediately bring you</p>
<p>chips and salsa, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an immediate put down.</p>
<p>Josh was like, can I get some salsa with no onions?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is like where I just completely glaze over immediately.</p>
<p>And I just look at the waitress and I&rsquo;m like, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>But wherever, whenever we go anywhere</p>
<p>and we place an order, I&rsquo;m just,</p>
<p>I literally have to inhale, count to three,</p>
<p>exhale, count to four.</p>
<p>It is like literally like I&rsquo;m in labor</p>
<p>because he is such a fucking psycho.</p>
<p>Special order, custom order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so bad that like we&rsquo;ll be in line to order something.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, okay, I want the number four,</p>
<p>but remove the avocado, remove the onions,</p>
<p>remove this, remove that.</p>
<p>And the guy&rsquo;s like, okay, so you want a number two?</p>
<p>Like he, you know.</p>
<p>Mira, let me ask you this.</p>
<p>What do you think about the term Sunday fun day?</p>
<p>Oh my God, it&rsquo;s the worst ever.</p>
<p>Like fuck Sunday fun day ever.</p>
<p>Like I hate it.</p>
<p>I hate the hashtag.</p>
<p>I hate what it means.</p>
<p>First of all, what is it?</p>
<p>That is the most basic bitch term.</p>
<p>That and foodie.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like foodie either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a foodie at all.</p>
<p>Food for me is something that I have to do twice a day</p>
<p>to be able to function.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like not this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna see me take a photograph of food,</p>
<p>post pictures of food on my Instagram.</p>
<p>Josh and I both like to go to dinner early.</p>
<p>We like to eat with the blue hairs around five, 5.30</p>
<p>and we dine.</p>
<p>And dash.</p>
<p>And dash immediately.</p>
<p>We are so, we wanna get in and get out.</p>
<p>My oldest son, Dylan, when he went off to college,</p>
<p>he went to dinner with friends.</p>
<p>And like right after the food, he was ready to go.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like getting his stuff.</p>
<p>So when he came home, he said,</p>
<p>I realized going to dinner with other people,</p>
<p>like they sit and stay at the table and have a conversation.</p>
<p>Jennifer, you have got to get pumped some snacks</p>
<p>in your office.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mira.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Is it unbelievable?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, that is like amazing to me</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have like a cracker, a peanut, a fruit bowl.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t snosh.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t snack.</p>
<p>She has a strict no snacking policy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a snacker.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t snack.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want it around because I would eat it.</p>
<p>So I just, so if I&rsquo;m gonna suffer,</p>
<p>every motherfucker that enters Jennifer Welch Designs</p>
<p>is gonna suffer.</p>
<p>Just as much.</p>
<p>Gluten-free bread.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re having celiac disease.</p>
<p>So like, if you have that, that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>But like for the nine times out of 10, you don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re lying liars.</p>
<p>So eat the regular bread.</p>
<p>Bad tippers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Worst.</p>
<p>Road testers at drag brunches had it.</p>
<p>People want to dress in drag and go to brunch,</p>
<p>let them do it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even get me started.</p>
<p>Why do you care?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna pause there for a second</p>
<p>because this is something that really fucking pisses me off</p>
<p>because you, all of a sudden, Fox or somebody,</p>
<p>one of these nut job news organizations</p>
<p>does something about drag queens.</p>
<p>And now everybody&rsquo;s going bananas</p>
<p>that drag queens are this huge threat to society.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t know everything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I do know.</p>
<p>I do know that the Catholic church, the Boy Scouts,</p>
<p>need I go on, are far more dangerous places for children</p>
<p>than a fucking drag show.</p>
<p>Like this is in the record, the criminal record,</p>
<p>that these are not safe places for children.</p>
<p>It is infuriating because I love drag queens.</p>
<p>I love drag queens.</p>
<p>I think I would-</p>
<p>I love drag queens.</p>
<p>I love it too.</p>
<p>And so if you don&rsquo;t want your kids</p>
<p>to be around drag queens, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So take them to a drag show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well within your control</p>
<p>whether your child goes to a drag show or not.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>Smoothies, had it.</p>
<p>I like a smoothie.</p>
<p>I like smoothies.</p>
<p>I like a smoothie.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m kind of,</p>
<p>I could never have a smoothie as my meal supplement.</p>
<p>I could.</p>
<p>But like you also have an office with no snacks.</p>
<p>So it does not surprise me that that is your jam.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one Mara, zero Jay Welch.</p>
<p>That was fantastic right there.</p>
<p>Let me just tell you this,</p>
<p>because of all the shit I&rsquo;m getting about the snacks,</p>
<p>I will never,</p>
<p>never purchase snacks for this office.</p>
<p>And if I happen to have a soft feeling</p>
<p>towards my employees that are here full-time</p>
<p>and then Pumps is supposed to come here to do a podcast,</p>
<p>I will secretly remove and hide the snacks</p>
<p>because she will never walk into this office.</p>
<p>Just on principle.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve just been,</p>
<p>I mean, this is like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re calling me out on this nonstop.</p>
<p>I thought that a lot of people would support it,</p>
<p>but apparently I&rsquo;m just alone on asshole Island.</p>
<p>Mother&rsquo;s day brunch.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given birth.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>My whole innards have come out to deliver a child.</p>
<p>And now my reward is scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t even go into the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got to dress the kid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to dress yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to go make them act appropriately</p>
<p>during the lunch.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t scream.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t yell.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to talk about,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re so happy you&rsquo;re the mother.</p>
<p>Yuck, yuck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, do me a favor for mother&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Take these little fuckers somewhere where I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For the whole day.</p>
<p>And if you really want to celebrate for an overnight.</p>
<p>This is the best mother&rsquo;s day gift</p>
<p>that you can give a mother.</p>
<p>Leave her the fuck alone.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let her be by herself.</p>
<p>And leave her the fuck alone.</p>
<p>Let her watch Netflix.</p>
<p>Let her do whatever the fuck she wants to.</p>
<p>Get the children.</p>
<p>Remove them from the house and go entertain them.</p>
<p>Mother&rsquo;s day, get the fuck away from me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best gift you could give a mother.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>So listen up to all of these men.</p>
<p>Why, why, why?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ll see it every single year.</p>
<p>When all the like marketing arrives for mother&rsquo;s day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all, let&rsquo;s take mom to brunch.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, why?</p>
<p>Like, what is this?</p>
<p>Like who decided that this is what moms want?</p>
<p>So this is something that we touch on</p>
<p>almost with every episode where you said,</p>
<p>who decided this about brunch?</p>
<p>Something we&rsquo;re talking about all the time</p>
<p>is there is very little oversight</p>
<p>on all of this shit that goes down.</p>
<p>Somebody somewhere decided brunch was going to be a thing.</p>
<p>Bottomless mimosas were going to be a thing.</p>
<p>They were going to start trotting them out,</p>
<p>cramming them down everybody&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>Mother&rsquo;s day brunch was going to be a thing.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t take your mom to brunch,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a fucking asshole.</p>
<p>I want, where&rsquo;s the oversight?</p>
<p>Where did we get to vote?</p>
<p>All this shit is happening around us all the time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s zero oversight on any of it.</p>
<p>Which is craziness on Sunday fun day.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s running around on Sunday fun day.</p>
<p>Let me, I want to, I want to pull,</p>
<p>pull everybody in this room.</p>
<p>Maris had it with Sunday funny pumps.</p>
<p>You use the word Sunday fun day?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily like it.</p>
<p>Have you had it with the phrase Sunday fun day?</p>
<p>Probably had it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jen and Nealey,</p>
<p>how do y&rsquo;all feel about the phrase Sunday fun day?</p>
<p>I love Sunday fun day.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>We love brunch.</p>
<p>We love bottomless mimosas.</p>
<p>We love drag brunch.</p>
<p>The only brunch that I can really get behind</p>
<p>is the drag brunch.</p>
<p>The drag brunch.</p>
<p>So you all like to do everything that everyone else.</p>
<p>So obviously we&rsquo;re the majority three to one, three to two.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the minority.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, I don&rsquo;t use the term Sunday fun day,</p>
<p>but I enjoy a fun Sunday.</p>
<p>And a fun Sunday is, is having a long, long brunch.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ll do like dinners with friends</p>
<p>for like three or four hours.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my worst.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my worst nightmare.</p>
<p>Mara, would you go to dinner with friends</p>
<p>for three to four hours?</p>
<p>Yes, I would.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mara.</p>
<p>I think, I have to say, I think that that&rsquo;s more civilized.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more normal.</p>
<p>If somebody invites me to dinner</p>
<p>and the start time is around 7.30 PM,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an immediate no.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Last time our producers were in town,</p>
<p>our friend Bogie that owns all of these restaurants</p>
<p>in Oklahoma City, he was like,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this new Mexican restaurant opened by you all.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>So we go at like, he said, you have to get there early.</p>
<p>You have to get there at like 5, 5.30 to get a table.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m down with the blue hair dinner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>So we go, it&rsquo;s full.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an hour long wait.</p>
<p>And if you look two doors down,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a place and it says pizza bar.</p>
<p>So I immediately adjust.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I say, okay, this place is an hour wait.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fucking doing that.</p>
<p>This place is open and has tables.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go eat there.</p>
<p>Josh Welch was immediately in agreement with me.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>We go down, we sit down, we have menus.</p>
<p>Well, Jen and Neely and Brian Bogert and Tanner are like,</p>
<p>no, we want to go to the Mexican restaurant.</p>
<p>Josh Welch says, here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all can go do that.</p>
<p>You can change it from a six top to a four top,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not waiting.</p>
<p>This place is open.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re eating here.</p>
<p>So we eat there.</p>
<p>They go down there.</p>
<p>They wait, they get their table.</p>
<p>And the next day I was like, Brian, was it good?</p>
<p>Did you like it?</p>
<p>And he said, yeah, I think they said like,</p>
<p>if you have to get a table, you need to get there by four.</p>
<p>And I said, perfect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<p>Fucking perfect.</p>
<p>4 p.m. dinner.</p>
<p>One thing I love like about this daylight savings thing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like such a fucking loser</p>
<p>putting my pajamas on at 5.30 p.m.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>It is not fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be starting to get dark at 4.30.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just stupid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you who suffers the most on daylight savings time</p>
<p>are mothers of young children.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>I remember those, remember when our kids were little</p>
<p>and we would, oh, it was horrible.</p>
<p>As we established in episode one,</p>
<p>our toddlers were total fucking assholes.</p>
<p>So it was-</p>
<p>Well, and also you established that like,</p>
<p>I love that because you also established as mothers,</p>
<p>like we did, listening to that,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t feel alone counting down the minutes</p>
<p>to your toddler going to bed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, starting at five o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>I remember the clock started going backwards.</p>
<p>You know, it was like taking so much longer</p>
<p>because I was like, okay, I&rsquo;ve got three hours.</p>
<p>I can do it.</p>
<p>Three more hours, three more hours.</p>
<p>Also had it with babies in restaurants.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not prepared</p>
<p>and you let that kid run wild,</p>
<p>well, you can fuck off.</p>
<p>Then get that kid out of the restaurant.</p>
<p>A baby on a plane, you have no choice.</p>
<p>That baby is on that plane.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing you can do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>A restaurant, I have a really huge fucking problem with,</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d load up, go to dinner.</p>
<p>One of our kids would start screaming.</p>
<p>Josh would immediately pick the child up,</p>
<p>leave the restaurant.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d say, get out, would convert to boxes.</p>
<p>And then we ate the meal at home</p>
<p>because we had an awareness</p>
<p>about how annoying it was to the other people</p>
<p>that were out.</p>
<p>Here are my two biggest pet peeves about the baby.</p>
<p>Obviously you&rsquo;re in Georgia,</p>
<p>so football is a big deal for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in Oklahoma, football&rsquo;s a big deal for us.</p>
<p>Going to the first game of the season</p>
<p>that is 110 degrees in the shade</p>
<p>and people have these teeny tiny babies,</p>
<p>like less than three months.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you think that baby wanted to get up</p>
<p>and come to 110 degree heat with people screaming?</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ve got the big headphones on the baby.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re making that baby miserable.</p>
<p>Sit your ass at home or get a babysitter.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t hard.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no genius.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in so much agreement with you, Pops.</p>
<p>I feel sorry.</p>
<p>People have gotten really weird with that.</p>
<p>I think like when we were babies,</p>
<p>like parents just didn&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>They smoked cigarettes around you.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t like put seat belts on you.</p>
<p>It was just like, they just threw you down in the basement</p>
<p>and now people are like so hypersensitive</p>
<p>that they wanna bring their babies everywhere.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen these kids at sporting events and concerts.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what&rsquo;s even grosser?</p>
<p>A baby at a music festival.</p>
<p>Agree, that&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>Okay, my other thing that I&rsquo;m hugely have a problem</p>
<p>with people and their kids,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very sensitive because I&rsquo;ve had three kids</p>
<p>that act shitty in a Target.</p>
<p>If you see a mom and she&rsquo;s got a baby</p>
<p>screaming, crying, whatever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s when they have both parents</p>
<p>at like the store shopping</p>
<p>and the two kids are out of control.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s two adults.</p>
<p>Somebody should have stayed home with the kid.</p>
<p>The family grocery shop to me with toddlers</p>
<p>is fucking ridiculous.</p>
<p>We never took our kids to the grocery store, ever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a complete lie.</p>
<p>You and I would, that&rsquo;s a total fucking lie.</p>
<p>We would take the whole crew?</p>
<p>Yeah, we would load up and we would take those kids</p>
<p>to the toddler gymnastics and your Petri dish,</p>
<p>the white suburb.</p>
<p>And then we went to the Mazzio&rsquo;s Pizza Buffet</p>
<p>because it was immediate gratification.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;d go to Target with the fucking kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that before in a Target</p>
<p>where my son was little and screaming</p>
<p>and I pretended I didn&rsquo;t know him.</p>
<p>I was like, who is that?</p>
<p>Baby, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Who is that?</p>
<p>Somebody left their kid.</p>
<p>Well, I want all of our listeners to know</p>
<p>that there is a war on brunch</p>
<p>that is being waged and headquartered</p>
<p>in Hotlanta, Georgia by Mara.</p>
<p>You can listen to her podcast, Vote Her</p>
<p>and find her on social media.</p>
<p>What are your socials, Mara?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m at Mara Davis on Twitter</p>
<p>if Twitter still exists by the time this comes out.</p>
<p>And then on Instagram, I&rsquo;m maradavis2000.</p>
<p>Well, ladies, when you come to Atlanta,</p>
<p>we will not go for brunch.</p>
<p>I will get a reservation for dinner at 5.30</p>
<p>and we will be done by seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Five&rsquo;s a little better.</p>
<p>Five&rsquo;s a little bit more optimal.</p>
<p>Mara, it was great to talk to you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Mara, thank you.</p>
<p>You bring a joy, lots of joy to a lot of cranky bitches.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mara.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mara.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Cranky bitches.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we should have named this podcast.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve listened and endured all of these podcasts</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve done and we&rsquo;re wearing black today</p>
<p>for the funeral of our podcast,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t want it to be dead,</p>
<p>subscribe, what is that?</p>
<p>Subscribe, review, follow.</p>
<p>Do all the shit you&rsquo;re supposed to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, do all the shit.</p>
<p>And what do we say now?</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just getting so good at this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting really good at this.</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s not the funeral.</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s not the last one ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
