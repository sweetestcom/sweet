    <p>The following is a conversation with Jeremy Howard.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the founder of FastAI, a research institute dedicated</p>
<p>to making deep learning more accessible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a distinguished research scientist</p>
<p>at the University of San Francisco,</p>
<p>a former president of Kaggle,</p>
<p>as well as a top ranking competitor there.</p>
<p>And in general, he&rsquo;s a successful entrepreneur,</p>
<p>educator, researcher, and an inspiring personality</p>
<p>in the AI community.</p>
<p>When someone asks me, how do I get started with deep learning?</p>
<p>FastAI is one of the top places that point them to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free, it&rsquo;s easy to get started,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insightful and accessible,</p>
<p>and if I may say so, it has very little BS</p>
<p>that can sometimes dilute the value of educational content</p>
<p>on popular topics like deep learning.</p>
<p>FastAI has a focus on practical application of deep learning</p>
<p>and hands on exploration of the cutting edge</p>
<p>that is incredibly both accessible to beginners</p>
<p>and useful to experts.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jeremy Howard.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the first program you ever written?</p>
<p>First program I wrote that I remember</p>
<p>would be at high school.</p>
<p>I did an assignment where I decided</p>
<p>to try to find out if there were some better musical scales</p>
<p>than the normal 12 tone, 12 interval scale.</p>
<p>So I wrote a program on my Commodore 64 in basic</p>
<p>that searched through other scale sizes</p>
<p>to see if it could find one</p>
<p>where there were more accurate harmonies.</p>
<p>Like mid tone?</p>
<p>Like you want an actual exactly three to two ratio</p>
<p>or else with a 12 interval scale,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not exactly three to two, for example.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s well tempered as they say in there.</p>
<p>And basic on a Commodore 64.</p>
<p>Where was the interest in music from?</p>
<p>Or is it just technical?</p>
<p>I did music all my life.</p>
<p>So I played saxophone and clarinet and piano</p>
<p>and guitar and drums and whatever.</p>
<p>How does that thread go through your life?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s music today?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not where I wish it was.</p>
<p>For various reasons, couldn&rsquo;t really keep it going,</p>
<p>particularly because I had a lot of problems</p>
<p>with RSI with my fingers.</p>
<p>And so I had to kind of like cut back anything</p>
<p>that used hands and fingers.</p>
<p>I hope one day I&rsquo;ll be able to get back to it health wise.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a love for music underlying it all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite instrument?</p>
<p>Saxophone.</p>
<p>Sax.</p>
<p>Or baritone saxophone.</p>
<p>Well, probably bass saxophone, but they&rsquo;re awkward.</p>
<p>Well, I always love it when music</p>
<p>is coupled with programming.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about a brain that utilizes those</p>
<p>that emerges with creative ideas.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve used and studied quite a few programming languages.</p>
<p>Can you give an overview of what you&rsquo;ve used?</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons of each?</p>
<p>Well, my favorite programming environment,</p>
<p>well, most certainly was Microsoft Access</p>
<p>back in like the earliest days.</p>
<p>So that was Visual Basic for applications,</p>
<p>which is not a good programming language,</p>
<p>but the programming environment was fantastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the ability to create, you know,</p>
<p>user interfaces and tie data and actions to them</p>
<p>and create reports and all that</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve never seen anything as good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things nowadays like Airtable,</p>
<p>which are like small subsets of that,</p>
<p>which people love for good reason,</p>
<p>but unfortunately, nobody&rsquo;s ever achieved</p>
<p>anything like that.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>If you could pause on that for a second.</p>
<p>Oh, Access?</p>
<p>Is it a database?</p>
<p>It was a database program that Microsoft produced,</p>
<p>part of Office, and they kind of withered, you know,</p>
<p>but basically it lets you in a totally graphical way</p>
<p>create tables and relationships and queries</p>
<p>and tie them to forms and set up, you know,</p>
<p>event handlers and calculations.</p>
<p>And it was a very complete powerful system</p>
<p>designed for not massive scalable things,</p>
<p>but for like useful little applications that I loved.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the connection between Excel and Access?</p>
<p>So very close.</p>
<p>So Access kind of was the relational database equivalent,</p>
<p>if you like.</p>
<p>So people still do a lot of that stuff</p>
<p>that should be in Access in Excel as they know it.</p>
<p>Excel&rsquo;s great as well.</p>
<p>So, but it&rsquo;s just not as rich a programming model</p>
<p>as VBA combined with a relational database.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve always loved relational databases,</p>
<p>but today programming on top of relational database</p>
<p>is just a lot more of a headache.</p>
<p>You know, you generally either need to kind of,</p>
<p>you know, you need something that connects,</p>
<p>that runs some kind of database server</p>
<p>unless you use SQLite, which has its own issues.</p>
<p>Then you kind of often,</p>
<p>if you want to get a nice programming model,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll need to like create an, add an ORM on top.</p>
<p>And then, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these pieces to tie together</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a lot more awkward than it should be.</p>
<p>There are people that are trying to make it easier.</p>
<p>So in particular, I think of F sharp, you know, Don Syme,</p>
<p>who, him and his team have done a great job</p>
<p>of making something like a database appear</p>
<p>in the type system.</p>
<p>So you actually get like tab completion for fields</p>
<p>and tables and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, so that was kind of, anyway,</p>
<p>so like that whole VBA office thing, I guess,</p>
<p>was a starting point, which I still miss.</p>
<p>And I got into standard Visual Basic, which&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, just to pause on that for a second.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that you&rsquo;re connecting programming languages</p>
<p>to the ease of management of data.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in your use of programming languages,</p>
<p>you always had a love and a connection with data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in doing useful things</p>
<p>for myself and for others,</p>
<p>which generally means getting some data</p>
<p>and doing something with it and putting it out there again.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been my interest throughout.</p>
<p>So I also did a lot of stuff with AppleScript</p>
<p>back in the early days.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of nice being able to get the computer</p>
<p>and computers to talk to each other</p>
<p>and to do things for you.</p>
<p>And then I think that one,</p>
<p>the programming language I most loved then</p>
<p>would have been Delphi, which was Object Pascal,</p>
<p>created by Anders Heilsberg,</p>
<p>who previously did Turbo Pascal</p>
<p>and then went on to create.NET</p>
<p>and then went on to create TypeScript.</p>
<p>Delphi was amazing because it was like a compiled,</p>
<p>fast language that was as easy to use as Visual Basic.</p>
<p>Delphi, what is it similar to in more modern languages?</p>
<p>Visual Basic.</p>
<p>Yeah, but a compiled, fast version.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s anything quite like it anymore.</p>
<p>If you took like C Sharp or Java</p>
<p>and got rid of the virtual machine</p>
<p>and replaced it with something,</p>
<p>you could compile a small type binary.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s where Swift could get to</p>
<p>with the new Swift UI</p>
<p>and the cross platform development going on.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s one of my dreams</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ll hopefully get back to where Delphi was.</p>
<p>There is actually a free Pascal project nowadays</p>
<p>called Lazarus,</p>
<p>which is also attempting to kind of recreate Delphi.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re making good progress.</p>
<p>So, okay, Delphi,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of your favorite programming languages.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s programming environments.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;d say Pascal&rsquo;s not a nice language.</p>
<p>If you wanted to know specifically</p>
<p>about what languages I like,</p>
<p>I would definitely pick J as being an amazingly wonderful</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s J?</p>
<p>J, are you aware of APL?</p>
<p>I am not, except from doing a little research</p>
<p>on the work you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Okay, so not at all surprising you&rsquo;re not familiar with it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not well known,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually one of the main families</p>
<p>of programming languages going back to the late 50s,</p>
<p>early 60s.</p>
<p>So there was a couple of major directions.</p>
<p>One was the kind of Lambda Calculus Alonzo Church direction,</p>
<p>which I guess kind of lisp and scheme and whatever,</p>
<p>which has a history going back</p>
<p>to the early days of computing.</p>
<p>The second was the kind of imperative slash OO,</p>
<p>algo similar going on to C, C++ and so forth.</p>
<p>There was a third,</p>
<p>which are called array oriented languages,</p>
<p>which started with a paper by a guy called Ken Iverson,</p>
<p>which was actually a math theory paper,</p>
<p>not a programming paper.</p>
<p>It was called Notation as a Tool for Thought.</p>
<p>And it was the development of a new way,</p>
<p>a new type of math notation.</p>
<p>And the idea is that this math notation</p>
<p>was much more flexible, expressive,</p>
<p>and also well defined than traditional math notation,</p>
<p>which is none of those things.</p>
<p>Math notation is awful.</p>
<p>And so he actually turned that into a programming language</p>
<p>and cause this was the early 50s or the sorry, late 50s,</p>
<p>all the names were available.</p>
<p>So he called his language a programming language or APL.</p>
<p>APL.</p>
<p>So APL is a implementation of notation</p>
<p>as a tool for thought by which he means math notation.</p>
<p>And Ken and his son went on to do many things,</p>
<p>but eventually they actually produced a new language</p>
<p>that was built on top of all the learnings of APL.</p>
<p>And that was called J.</p>
<p>And J is the most expressive, composable language</p>
<p>of beautifully designed language I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Does it have object oriented components?</p>
<p>Does it have that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Not really, it&rsquo;s an array oriented language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the third path.</p>
<p>Are you saying array?</p>
<p>Array oriented, yeah.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be array oriented?</p>
<p>So array oriented means that you generally</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use any loops,</p>
<p>but the whole thing is done with kind of</p>
<p>a extreme version of broadcasting,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re familiar with that NumPy slash Python concept.</p>
<p>So you do a lot with one line of code.</p>
<p>It looks a lot like math notation, highly compact.</p>
<p>And the idea is that you can kind of,</p>
<p>because you can do so much with one line of code,</p>
<p>a single screen of code is very unlikely to,</p>
<p>you very rarely need more than that</p>
<p>to express your program.</p>
<p>And so you can kind of keep it all in your head</p>
<p>and you can kind of clearly communicate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that APL created two main branches,</p>
<p>K and J.</p>
<p>J is this kind of like open source,</p>
<p>niche community of crazy enthusiasts like me.</p>
<p>And then the other path, K, was fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an astonishingly expensive programming language,</p>
<p>which many of the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>most ludicrously rich hedge funds use.</p>
<p>So the entire K machine is so small</p>
<p>it sits inside level three cache on your CPU.</p>
<p>And it easily wins every benchmark I&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>in terms of data processing speed.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t come across it very much</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like $100,000 per CPU to run it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this path of programming languages</p>
<p>is just so much, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>so much more powerful in every way</p>
<p>than the ones that almost anybody uses every day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about computation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really focused on computation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty heavily focused on computation.</p>
<p>I mean, so much of programming</p>
<p>is data processing by definition.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do with it.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s not much work being done</p>
<p>on making like user interface toolkits or whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some, but they&rsquo;re not great.</p>
<p>At the same time, you&rsquo;ve done a lot of stuff</p>
<p>with Perl and Python.</p>
<p>So where does that fit into the picture of J and K and APL?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just much more pragmatic.</p>
<p>Like in the end, you kind of have to end up</p>
<p>where the libraries are, you know?</p>
<p>Like, cause to me, my focus is on productivity.</p>
<p>I just want to get stuff done and solve problems.</p>
<p>So Perl was great.</p>
<p>I created an email company called FastMail</p>
<p>and Perl was great cause back in the late nineties,</p>
<p>early two thousands, it just had a lot of stuff it could do.</p>
<p>I still had to write my own monitoring system</p>
<p>and my own web framework, my own whatever,</p>
<p>cause like none of that stuff existed.</p>
<p>But it was a super flexible language to do that in.</p>
<p>And you used Perl for FastMail, you used it as a backend?</p>
<p>Like so everything was written in Perl?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, everything, everything was Perl.</p>
<p>Why do you think Perl hasn&rsquo;t succeeded</p>
<p>or hasn&rsquo;t dominated the market where Python</p>
<p>really takes over a lot of the tasks?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, Perl did dominate.</p>
<p>It was everything, everywhere,</p>
<p>but then the guy that ran Perl, Larry Wohl,</p>
<p>kind of just didn&rsquo;t put the time in anymore.</p>
<p>And no project can be successful if there isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, particularly one that started with a strong leader</p>
<p>that loses that strong leadership.</p>
<p>So then Python has kind of replaced it.</p>
<p>You know, Python is a lot less elegant language</p>
<p>in nearly every way,</p>
<p>but it has the data science libraries</p>
<p>and a lot of them are pretty great.</p>
<p>So I kind of use it</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s the best we have,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely not good enough.</p>
<p>But what do you think the future of programming looks like?</p>
<p>What do you hope the future of programming looks like</p>
<p>if we zoom in on the computational fields,</p>
<p>on data science, on machine learning?</p>
<p>I hope Swift is successful</p>
<p>because the goal of Swift,</p>
<p>the way Chris Latner describes it,</p>
<p>is to be infinitely hackable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I want.</p>
<p>I want something where me and the people I do research with</p>
<p>and my students can look at</p>
<p>and change everything from top to bottom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing mysterious and magical and inaccessible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately with Python, it&rsquo;s the opposite of that</p>
<p>because Python is so slow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely unhackable.</p>
<p>You get to a point where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, from here on down at C.</p>
<p>So your debugger doesn&rsquo;t work in the same way.</p>
<p>Your profiler doesn&rsquo;t work in the same way.</p>
<p>Your build system doesn&rsquo;t work in the same way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not very hackable at all.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the part you like to be hackable?</p>
<p>Is it for the objective of optimizing training</p>
<p>of neural networks, inference of neural networks?</p>
<p>Is it performance of the system</p>
<p>or is there some non performance related, just?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>I mean, in the end, I want to be productive</p>
<p>as a practitioner.</p>
<p>So that means that, so like at the moment,</p>
<p>our understanding of deep learning is incredibly primitive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little we understand.</p>
<p>Most things don&rsquo;t work very well,</p>
<p>even though it works better than anything else out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many opportunities to make it better.</p>
<p>So you look at any domain area,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, speech recognition with deep learning</p>
<p>or natural language processing classification</p>
<p>with deep learning or whatever.</p>
<p>Every time I look at an area with deep learning,</p>
<p>I always see like, oh, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots and lots of obviously stupid ways</p>
<p>to do things that need to be fixed.</p>
<p>So then I want to be able to jump in there</p>
<p>and quickly experiment and make them better.</p>
<p>You think the programming language has a role in that?</p>
<p>Huge role, yeah.</p>
<p>So currently, Python has a big gap</p>
<p>in terms of our ability to innovate,</p>
<p>particularly around recurrent neural networks</p>
<p>and natural language processing.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so slow, the actual loop</p>
<p>where we actually loop through words,</p>
<p>we have to do that whole thing in CUDA C.</p>
<p>So we actually can&rsquo;t innovate with the kernel,</p>
<p>the heart of that most important algorithm.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a huge problem.</p>
<p>And this happens all over the place.</p>
<p>So we hit research limitations.</p>
<p>Another example, convolutional neural networks,</p>
<p>which are actually the most popular architecture</p>
<p>for lots of things, maybe most things in deep learning.</p>
<p>We almost certainly should be using</p>
<p>sparse convolutional neural networks,</p>
<p>but only like two people are,</p>
<p>because to do it, you have to rewrite</p>
<p>all of that CUDA C level stuff.</p>
<p>And yeah, just researchers and practitioners don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just big gaps in what people actually research on,</p>
<p>what people actually implement</p>
<p>because of the programming language problem.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s just too difficult to write in CUDA C</p>
<p>that a higher level programming language like Swift</p>
<p>should enable the easier,</p>
<p>fooling around creative stuff with RNNs</p>
<p>or with sparse convolutional neural networks?</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s at fault?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s at charge of making it easy</p>
<p>for a researcher to play around?</p>
<p>I mean, no one&rsquo;s at fault,</p>
<p>just nobody&rsquo;s got around to it yet,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s hard, right?</p>
<p>And I mean, part of the fault is that we ignored</p>
<p>that whole APL kind of direction.</p>
<p>Nearly everybody did for 60 years, 50 years.</p>
<p>But recently people have been starting to</p>
<p>reinvent pieces of that</p>
<p>and kind of create some interesting new directions</p>
<p>in the compiler technology.</p>
<p>So the place where that&rsquo;s particularly happening right now</p>
<p>is something called MLIR,</p>
<p>which is something that, again,</p>
<p>Chris Latina, the Swift guy, is leading.</p>
<p>And yeah, because it&rsquo;s actually not gonna be Swift</p>
<p>on its own that solves this problem,</p>
<p>because the problem is that currently writing</p>
<p>a acceptably fast, you know, GPU program</p>
<p>is too complicated regardless of what language you use.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just because if you have to deal with the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve got, you know, 10,000 threads</p>
<p>and I have to synchronize between them all</p>
<p>and I have to put my thing into grid blocks</p>
<p>and think about warps and all this stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so much boilerplate that to do that well,</p>
<p>you have to be a specialist at that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be a year&rsquo;s work to, you know,</p>
<p>optimize that algorithm in that way.</p>
<p>But with things like tensor comprehensions</p>
<p>and TILE and MLIR and TVM,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these various projects</p>
<p>which are all about saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let people create like domain specific languages</p>
<p>for tensor computations.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of things we do generally</p>
<p>on the GPU for deep learning and then have a compiler</p>
<p>which can optimize that tensor computation.</p>
<p>A lot of this work is actually sitting</p>
<p>on top of a project called Halide,</p>
<p>which is a mind blowing project where they came up</p>
<p>with such a domain specific language.</p>
<p>In fact, two, one domain specific language for expressing</p>
<p>this is what my tensor computation is</p>
<p>and another domain specific language for expressing</p>
<p>this is the kind of the way I want you to structure</p>
<p>the compilation of that and like do it block by block</p>
<p>and do these bits in parallel.</p>
<p>And they were able to show how you can compress</p>
<p>the amount of code by 10X compared to optimized GPU code</p>
<p>and get the same performance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like, so these other things are kind of sitting</p>
<p>on top of that kind of research and MLIR is pulling a lot</p>
<p>of those best practices together.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re starting to see work done on making all</p>
<p>of that directly accessible through Swift</p>
<p>so that I could use Swift to kind of write those</p>
<p>domain specific languages and hopefully we&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>then Swift CUDA kernels written in a very expressive</p>
<p>and concise way that looks a bit like J and APL</p>
<p>and then Swift layers on top of that</p>
<p>and then a Swift UI on top of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be so nice if we can get to that point.</p>
<p>Now does it all eventually boil down to CUDA</p>
<p>and NVIDIA GPUs?</p>
<p>Unfortunately at the moment it does,</p>
<p>but one of the nice things about MLIR if AMD ever</p>
<p>gets their act together which they probably won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>is that they or others could write MLIR backends</p>
<p>for other GPUs or rather tensor computation devices</p>
<p>of which today there are increasing number</p>
<p>like Graph Core or Vertex AI or whatever.</p>
<p>So yeah, being able to target lots of backends</p>
<p>would be another benefit of this</p>
<p>and the market really needs competition</p>
<p>because at the moment NVIDIA is massively overcharging</p>
<p>for their kind of enterprise class cards</p>
<p>because there is no serious competition</p>
<p>because nobody else is doing the software properly.</p>
<p>In the cloud there is some competition, right?</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Not really, other than TPUs perhaps,</p>
<p>but TPUs are almost unprogrammable at the moment.</p>
<p>So TPUs have the same problem that you can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>So TPUs, Google actually made an explicit decision</p>
<p>to make them almost entirely unprogrammable</p>
<p>because they felt that there was too much IP in there</p>
<p>and if they gave people direct access to program them,</p>
<p>people would learn their secrets.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t actually directly program the memory</p>
<p>in a TPU.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even directly create code that runs on</p>
<p>and that you look at on the machine that has the TPU,</p>
<p>it all goes through a virtual machine.</p>
<p>So all you can really do is this kind of cookie cutter thing</p>
<p>of like plug in high level stuff together,</p>
<p>which is just super tedious and annoying</p>
<p>and totally unnecessary.</p>
<p>So what was the, tell me if you could,</p>
<p>the origin story of fast AI.</p>
<p>What is the motivation, its mission, its dream?</p>
<p>So I guess the founding story is heavily tied</p>
<p>to my previous startup, which is a company called Analytic,</p>
<p>which was the first company to focus on deep learning</p>
<p>for medicine and I created that because I saw</p>
<p>that was a huge opportunity to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about a 10X shortage of the number of doctors</p>
<p>in the world, in the developing world that we need.</p>
<p>I expected it would take about 300 years</p>
<p>to train enough doctors to meet that gap.</p>
<p>But I guess that maybe if we used deep learning</p>
<p>for some of the analytics, we could maybe make it</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t need as highly trained doctors.</p>
<p>For diagnosis.</p>
<p>For diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the biggest benefit just before we get to fast AI,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the biggest benefit of AI</p>
<p>and medicine that you see today?</p>
<p>And maybe next time.</p>
<p>Not much happening today in terms of like stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually out there, it&rsquo;s very early.</p>
<p>But in terms of the opportunity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to take markets like India and China and Indonesia,</p>
<p>which have big populations, Africa,</p>
<p>small numbers of doctors,</p>
<p>and provide diagnostic, particularly treatment planning</p>
<p>and triage kind of on device so that if you do a test</p>
<p>for malaria or tuberculosis or whatever,</p>
<p>you immediately get something that even a healthcare worker</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s had a month of training can get</p>
<p>a very high quality assessment of whether the patient</p>
<p>might be at risk and tell, okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll send them off to a hospital.</p>
<p>So for example, in Africa, outside of South Africa,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only five pediatric radiologists</p>
<p>for the entire continent.</p>
<p>So most countries don&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>So if your kid is sick and they need something diagnosed</p>
<p>through medical imaging, the person,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re able to get medical imaging done,</p>
<p>the person that looks at it will be a nurse at best.</p>
<p>But actually in India, for example, and China,</p>
<p>almost no x rays are read by anybody,</p>
<p>by any trained professional because they don&rsquo;t have enough.</p>
<p>So if instead we had a algorithm that could take</p>
<p>the most likely high risk 5% and say triage,</p>
<p>basically say, okay, someone needs to look at this,</p>
<p>it would massively change the kind of way</p>
<p>that what&rsquo;s possible with medicine in the developing world.</p>
<p>And remember, they have, increasingly they have money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the developing world, they&rsquo;re not the poor world,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the developing world.</p>
<p>So they have the money.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re building the hospitals,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting the diagnostic equipment,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no way for a very long time</p>
<p>will they be able to have the expertise.</p>
<p>Shortage of expertise, okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the deep learning systems can step in</p>
<p>and magnify the expertise they do have.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>So you do see, just to linger a little bit longer,</p>
<p>the interaction, do you still see the human experts</p>
<p>still at the core of these systems?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Is there something in medicine</p>
<p>that could be automated almost completely?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the point of even thinking about that</p>
<p>because we have such a shortage of people.</p>
<p>Why would we want to find a way not to use them?</p>
<p>We have people, so the idea of like,</p>
<p>even from an economic point of view,</p>
<p>if you can make them 10X more productive,</p>
<p>getting rid of the person,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t impact your unit economics at all.</p>
<p>And it totally ignores the fact</p>
<p>that there are things people do better than machines.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just to me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a useful way of framing the problem.</p>
<p>I guess, just to clarify,</p>
<p>I guess I meant there may be some problems</p>
<p>where you can avoid even going to the expert ever,</p>
<p>sort of maybe preventative care or some basic stuff,</p>
<p>allowing food,</p>
<p>allowing the expert to focus on the things</p>
<p>that are really that, you know.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what the triage would do, right?</p>
<p>So the triage would say,</p>
<p>okay, there&rsquo;s 99% sure there&rsquo;s nothing here.</p>
<p>So that can be done on device</p>
<p>and they can just say, okay, go home.</p>
<p>So the experts are being used to look at the stuff</p>
<p>which has some chance it&rsquo;s worth looking at,</p>
<p>which most things it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Why do you think we haven&rsquo;t quite made progress on that yet</p>
<p>in terms of the scale of how much AI is applied</p>
<p>in the medical field?</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>I mean, one is it&rsquo;s pretty new.</p>
<p>I only started in Liddick in like 2014.</p>
<p>And before that, it&rsquo;s hard to express</p>
<p>to what degree the medical world</p>
<p>was not aware of the opportunities here.</p>
<p>So I went to RSNA,</p>
<p>which is the world&rsquo;s largest radiology conference.</p>
<p>And I told everybody I could, you know,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m doing this thing with deep learning,</p>
<p>please come and check it out.</p>
<p>And no one had any idea what I was talking about</p>
<p>and no one had any interest in it.</p>
<p>So like we&rsquo;ve come from absolute zero, which is hard.</p>
<p>And then the whole regulatory framework, education system,</p>
<p>everything is just set up to think of doctoring</p>
<p>in a very different way.</p>
<p>So today there is a small number of people</p>
<p>who are deep learning practitioners</p>
<p>and doctors at the same time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re starting to see the first ones</p>
<p>come out of their PhD programs.</p>
<p>So Zach Kahane over in Boston, Cambridge</p>
<p>has a number of students now who are data science experts,</p>
<p>deep learning experts, and actual medical doctors.</p>
<p>Quite a few doctors have completed our fast AI course now</p>
<p>and are publishing papers and creating journal reading groups</p>
<p>in the American Council of Radiology.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s just starting to happen,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna be a long time coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna happen, but it&rsquo;s gonna be a long process.</p>
<p>The regulators have to learn how to regulate this.</p>
<p>They have to build guidelines.</p>
<p>And then the lawyers at hospitals</p>
<p>have to develop a new way of understanding</p>
<p>that sometimes it makes sense for data to be looked at</p>
<p>in raw form in large quantities</p>
<p>in order to create well changing results.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the regulation around data, all that,</p>
<p>it sounds probably the hardest problem,</p>
<p>but sounds reminiscent of autonomous vehicles as well.</p>
<p>Many of the same regulatory challenges,</p>
<p>many of the same data challenges.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, funnily enough,</p>
<p>the problem is less the regulation</p>
<p>and more the interpretation of that regulation</p>
<p>by lawyers in hospitals.</p>
<p>So HIPAA is actually, was designed to pay,</p>
<p>and HIPAA does not stand for privacy.</p>
<p>It stands for portability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually meant to be a way that data can be used.</p>
<p>And it was created with lots of gray areas</p>
<p>because the idea is that would be more practical</p>
<p>and it would help people to use this legislation</p>
<p>to actually share data in a more thoughtful way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s done the opposite</p>
<p>because when a lawyer sees a gray area,</p>
<p>they say, oh, if we don&rsquo;t know, we won&rsquo;t get sued,</p>
<p>then we can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So HIPAA is not exactly the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is more that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>hospital lawyers are not incented</p>
<p>to make bold decisions about data portability.</p>
<p>Or even to embrace technology that saves lives.</p>
<p>They more want to not get in trouble</p>
<p>for embracing that technology.</p>
<p>It also saves lives in a very abstract way,</p>
<p>which is like, oh, we&rsquo;ve been able to release</p>
<p>these 100,000 anonymized records.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t point to the specific person</p>
<p>whose life that saved.</p>
<p>I can say like, oh, we ended up with this paper</p>
<p>which found this result,</p>
<p>which diagnosed a thousand more people</p>
<p>than we would have otherwise,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, which ones were helped?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very abstract.</p>
<p>And on the counter side of that,</p>
<p>you may be able to point to a life that was taken</p>
<p>because of something that was.</p>
<p>Yeah, or a person whose privacy was violated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, this specific person was deidentified.</p>
<p>So, identified.</p>
<p>Just a fascinating topic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re jumping around.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get back to fast AI,</p>
<p>but on the question of privacy,</p>
<p>data is the fuel for so much innovation in deep learning.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense on privacy?</p>
<p>Whether we&rsquo;re talking about Twitter, Facebook, YouTube,</p>
<p>just the technologies like in the medical field</p>
<p>that rely on people&rsquo;s data in order to create impact.</p>
<p>How do we get that right,</p>
<p>respecting people&rsquo;s privacy and yet creating technology</p>
<p>that is learning from data?</p>
<p>One of my areas of focus is on doing more with less data.</p>
<p>More with less data, which,</p>
<p>so most vendors, unfortunately,</p>
<p>are strongly incented to find ways</p>
<p>to require more data and more computation.</p>
<p>So, Google and IBM being the most obvious.</p>
<p>IBM.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Watson.</p>
<p>So, Google and IBM both strongly push the idea</p>
<p>that you have to be,</p>
<p>that they have more data and more computation</p>
<p>and more intelligent people than anybody else.</p>
<p>And so you have to trust them to do things</p>
<p>because nobody else can do it.</p>
<p>And Google&rsquo;s very upfront about this,</p>
<p>like Jeff Dean has gone out there and given talks</p>
<p>and said, our goal is to require</p>
<p>a thousand times more computation, but less people.</p>
<p>Our goal is to use the people that you have better</p>
<p>and the data you have better</p>
<p>and the computation you have better.</p>
<p>So, one of the things that we&rsquo;ve discovered is,</p>
<p>or at least highlighted,</p>
<p>is that you very, very, very often</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need much data at all.</p>
<p>And so the data you already have in your organization</p>
<p>will be enough to get state of the art results.</p>
<p>So, like my starting point would be to kind of say</p>
<p>around privacy is a lot of people are looking for ways</p>
<p>to share data and aggregate data,</p>
<p>but I think often that&rsquo;s unnecessary.</p>
<p>They assume that they need more data than they do</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not familiar with the basics</p>
<p>of transfer learning, which is this critical technique</p>
<p>for needing orders of magnitude less data.</p>
<p>Is your sense, one reason you might wanna collect data</p>
<p>from everyone is like in the recommender system context,</p>
<p>where your individual, Jeremy Howard&rsquo;s individual data</p>
<p>is the most useful for providing a product</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s impactful for you.</p>
<p>So, for giving you advertisements,</p>
<p>for recommending to you movies,</p>
<p>for doing medical diagnosis,</p>
<p>is your sense we can build with a small amount of data,</p>
<p>general models that will have a huge impact</p>
<p>for most people that we don&rsquo;t need to have data</p>
<p>from each individual?</p>
<p>On the whole, I&rsquo;d say yes.</p>
<p>I mean, there are things like,</p>
<p>you know, recommender systems have this cold start problem</p>
<p>where, you know, Jeremy is a new customer,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t seen him before, so we can&rsquo;t recommend him things</p>
<p>based on what else he&rsquo;s bought and liked with us.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s various workarounds to that.</p>
<p>Like in a lot of music programs,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll start out by saying, which of these artists do you like?</p>
<p>Which of these albums do you like?</p>
<p>Which of these songs do you like?</p>
<p>Netflix used to do that, nowadays they tend not to.</p>
<p>People kind of don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>because they think, oh, we don&rsquo;t wanna bother the user.</p>
<p>So, you could work around that</p>
<p>by having some kind of data sharing</p>
<p>where you get my marketing record from Axiom or whatever,</p>
<p>and try to guess from that.</p>
<p>To me, the benefit to me and to society</p>
<p>of saving me five minutes on answering some questions</p>
<p>versus the negative externalities of the privacy issue</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t add up.</p>
<p>So, I think like a lot of the time,</p>
<p>the places where people are invading our privacy</p>
<p>in order to provide convenience</p>
<p>is really about just trying to make them more money</p>
<p>and they move these negative externalities</p>
<p>to places that they don&rsquo;t have to pay for them.</p>
<p>So, when you actually see regulations appear</p>
<p>that actually cause the companies</p>
<p>that create these negative externalities</p>
<p>to have to pay for it themselves,</p>
<p>they say, well, we can&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>
<p>So, the cost is actually too high.</p>
<p>But for something like medicine,</p>
<p>yeah, I mean, the hospital has my medical imaging,</p>
<p>my pathology studies, my medical records,</p>
<p>and also I own my medical data.</p>
<p>So, you can, so I help a startup called Doc.ai.</p>
<p>One of the things Doc.ai does is that it has an app.</p>
<p>You can connect to, you know, Sutter Health</p>
<p>and LabCorp and Walgreens</p>
<p>and download your medical data to your phone</p>
<p>and then upload it again at your discretion</p>
<p>to share it as you wish.</p>
<p>So, with that kind of approach,</p>
<p>we can share our medical information</p>
<p>with the people we want to.</p>
<p>Yeah, so control.</p>
<p>I mean, really being able to control</p>
<p>who you share it with and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, that has a beautiful, interesting tangent</p>
<p>to return back to the origin story of Fast.ai.</p>
<p>Right, so before I started Fast.ai,</p>
<p>I spent a year researching</p>
<p>where are the biggest opportunities for deep learning?</p>
<p>Because I knew from my time at Kaggle in particular</p>
<p>that deep learning had kind of hit this threshold point</p>
<p>where it was rapidly becoming the state of the art approach</p>
<p>in every area that looked at it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d been working with neural nets for over 20 years.</p>
<p>I knew that from a theoretical point of view,</p>
<p>once it hit that point,</p>
<p>it would do that in kind of just about every domain.</p>
<p>And so I kind of spent a year researching</p>
<p>what are the domains that&rsquo;s gonna have</p>
<p>the biggest low hanging fruit</p>
<p>in the shortest time period.</p>
<p>I picked medicine, but there were so many</p>
<p>I could have picked.</p>
<p>And so there was a kind of level of frustration for me</p>
<p>of like, okay, I&rsquo;m really glad we&rsquo;ve opened up</p>
<p>the medical deep learning world.</p>
<p>And today it&rsquo;s huge, as you know,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t do, I can&rsquo;t do everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know, like in medicine,</p>
<p>it took me a really long time to even get a sense</p>
<p>of like what kind of problems do medical practitioners solve?</p>
<p>What kind of data do they have?</p>
<p>Who has that data?</p>
<p>So I kind of felt like I need to approach this differently</p>
<p>if I wanna maximize the positive impact of deep learning.</p>
<p>Rather than me picking an area</p>
<p>and trying to become good at it and building something,</p>
<p>I should let people who are already domain experts</p>
<p>in those areas and who already have the data</p>
<p>do it themselves.</p>
<p>So that was the reason for Fast.ai</p>
<p>is to basically try and figure out</p>
<p>how to get deep learning into the hands of people</p>
<p>who could benefit from it and help them to do so</p>
<p>in as quick and easy and effective a way as possible.</p>
<p>Got it, so sort of empower the domain experts.</p>
<p>Yeah, and like partly it&rsquo;s because like,</p>
<p>unlike most people in this field,</p>
<p>my background is very applied and industrial.</p>
<p>Like my first job was at McKinsey &amp; Company.</p>
<p>I spent 10 years in management consulting.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time with domain experts.</p>
<p>So I kind of respect them and appreciate them.</p>
<p>And I know that&rsquo;s where the value generation in society is.</p>
<p>And so I also know how most of them can&rsquo;t code</p>
<p>and most of them don&rsquo;t have the time to invest</p>
<p>three years in a graduate degree or whatever.</p>
<p>So I was like, how do I upskill those domain experts?</p>
<p>I think that would be a super powerful thing,</p>
<p>the biggest societal impact I could have.</p>
<p>So yeah, that was the thinking.</p>
<p>So much of Fast.ai students and researchers</p>
<p>and the things you teach are pragmatically minded,</p>
<p>practically minded,</p>
<p>figuring out ways how to solve real problems and fast.</p>
<p>So from your experience,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between theory</p>
<p>and practice of deep learning?</p>
<p>Well, most of the research in the deep learning world</p>
<p>is a total waste of time.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s what I was getting at.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem in science in general.</p>
<p>Scientists need to be published,</p>
<p>which means they need to work on things</p>
<p>that their peers are extremely familiar with</p>
<p>and can recognize in advance in that area.</p>
<p>So that means that they all need to work on the same thing.</p>
<p>And so it really, and the thing they work on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to encourage them to work on things</p>
<p>that are practically useful.</p>
<p>So you get just a whole lot of research,</p>
<p>which is minor advances and stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been very highly studied</p>
<p>and has no significant practical impact.</p>
<p>Whereas the things that really make a difference,</p>
<p>like I mentioned transfer learning,</p>
<p>like if we can do better at transfer learning,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s this like world changing thing</p>
<p>where suddenly like lots more people</p>
<p>can do world class work with less resources and less data.</p>
<p>But almost nobody works on that.</p>
<p>Or another example, active learning,</p>
<p>which is the study of like,</p>
<p>how do we get more out of the human beings in the loop?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite topic.</p>
<p>Yeah, so active learning is great,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost nobody working on it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just not a trendy thing right now.</p>
<p>You know what somebody, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that nobody is publishing on active learning,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s people inside companies,</p>
<p>anybody who actually has to solve a problem,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to innovate on active learning.</p>
<p>Yeah, everybody kind of reinvents active learning</p>
<p>when they actually have to work in practice</p>
<p>because they start labeling things and they think,</p>
<p>gosh, this is taking a long time and it&rsquo;s very expensive.</p>
<p>And then they start thinking,</p>
<p>well, why am I labeling everything?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only, the machine&rsquo;s only making mistakes</p>
<p>on those two classes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the hard ones.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll just start labeling those two classes.</p>
<p>And then you start thinking,</p>
<p>well, why did I do that manually?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t I just get the system to tell me</p>
<p>which things are going to be hardest?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an obvious thing to do, but yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like transfer learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understudied and the academic world</p>
<p>just has no reason to care about practical results.</p>
<p>The funny thing is,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve only really ever written one paper.</p>
<p>I hate writing papers.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even write it.</p>
<p>It was my colleague, Sebastian Ruder,</p>
<p>who actually wrote it.</p>
<p>I just did the research for it,</p>
<p>but it was basically introducing transfer learning,</p>
<p>successful transfer learning to NLP for the first time.</p>
<p>The algorithm is called ULM fit.</p>
<p>And it actually, I actually wrote it for the course,</p>
<p>for the Fast AI course.</p>
<p>I wanted to teach people NLP and I thought,</p>
<p>I only want to teach people practical stuff.</p>
<p>And I think the only practical stuff is transfer learning.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t find any examples of transfer learning in NLP.</p>
<p>So I just did it.</p>
<p>And I was shocked to find that as soon as I did it,</p>
<p>which, you know, the basic prototype took a couple of days,</p>
<p>smashed the state of the art</p>
<p>on one of the most important data sets</p>
<p>in a field that I knew nothing about.</p>
<p>And I just thought, well, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>And so I spoke to Sebastian about it</p>
<p>and he kindly offered to write it up, the results.</p>
<p>And so it ended up being published in ACL,</p>
<p>which is the top computational linguistics conference.</p>
<p>So like people do actually care once you do it,</p>
<p>but I guess it&rsquo;s difficult for maybe like junior researchers</p>
<p>or like, I don&rsquo;t care whether I get citations</p>
<p>or papers or whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in my life that makes that important,</p>
<p>which is why I&rsquo;ve never actually bothered</p>
<p>to write a paper myself.</p>
<p>But for people who do,</p>
<p>I guess they have to pick the kind of safe option,</p>
<p>which is like, yeah, make a slight improvement</p>
<p>on something that everybody&rsquo;s already working on.</p>
<p>Yeah, nobody does anything interesting</p>
<p>or succeeds in life with the safe option.</p>
<p>Although, I mean, the nice thing is,</p>
<p>nowadays everybody is now working on NLP transfer learning</p>
<p>because since that time we&rsquo;ve had GPT and GPT2 and BERT,</p>
<p>and, you know, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s, so yeah,</p>
<p>once you show that something&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>everybody jumps in, I guess, so.</p>
<p>I hope to be a part of,</p>
<p>and I hope to see more innovation</p>
<p>and active learning in the same way.</p>
<p>I think transfer learning and active learning</p>
<p>are fascinating, public, open work.</p>
<p>I actually helped start a startup called Platform AI,</p>
<p>which is really all about active learning.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s been interesting trying to kind of see</p>
<p>what research is out there and make the most of it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s basically none.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had to do all our own research.</p>
<p>Once again, and just as you described.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of the Stanford competition,</p>
<p>Dawn Bench, and FastAI&rsquo;s achievement on it?</p>
<p>Sure, so something which I really enjoy</p>
<p>is that I basically teach two courses a year,</p>
<p>the Practical Deep Learning for Coders,</p>
<p>which is kind of the introductory course,</p>
<p>and then Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders,</p>
<p>which is the kind of research level course.</p>
<p>And while I teach those courses,</p>
<p>I basically have a big office</p>
<p>at the University of San Francisco,</p>
<p>big enough for like 30 people.</p>
<p>And I invite anybody, any student who wants to come</p>
<p>and hang out with me while I build the course.</p>
<p>And so generally it&rsquo;s full.</p>
<p>And so we have 20 or 30 people in a big office</p>
<p>with nothing to do but study deep learning.</p>
<p>So it was during one of these times</p>
<p>that somebody in the group said,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s a thing called Dawn Bench</p>
<p>that looks interesting.</p>
<p>And I was like, what the hell is that?</p>
<p>And they set out some competition</p>
<p>to see how quickly you can train a model.</p>
<p>Seems kind of, not exactly relevant to what we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but it sounds like the kind of thing</p>
<p>which you might be interested in.</p>
<p>And I checked it out and I was like,</p>
<p>oh crap, there&rsquo;s only 10 days till it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kind of busy trying to teach this course.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re like, oh, it would make an interesting case study</p>
<p>for the course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s all the stuff we&rsquo;re already doing.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just put together</p>
<p>our current best practices and ideas?</p>
<p>So me and I guess about four students</p>
<p>just decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>And we focused on this small one called Cifar 10,</p>
<p>which is little 32 by 32 pixel images.</p>
<p>Can you say what Dawn Bench is?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a competition to train a model</p>
<p>as fast as possible.</p>
<p>It was run by Stanford.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cheap as possible too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also another one for as cheap as possible.</p>
<p>And there was a couple of categories,</p>
<p>ImageNet and Cifar 10.</p>
<p>So ImageNet is this big 1.3 million image thing</p>
<p>that took a couple of days to train.</p>
<p>Remember a friend of mine, Pete Warden,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now at Google.</p>
<p>I remember he told me how he trained ImageNet</p>
<p>a few years ago when he basically like had this</p>
<p>little granny flat out the back</p>
<p>that he turned into his ImageNet training center.</p>
<p>And he figured, you know, after like a year of work,</p>
<p>he figured out how to train it in like 10 days or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that was a big job.</p>
<p>Whereas Cifar 10, at that time,</p>
<p>you could train in a few hours.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s much smaller and easier.</p>
<p>So we thought we&rsquo;d try Cifar 10.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;ve really never done that before.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d never really,</p>
<p>like things like using more than one GPU at a time</p>
<p>was something I tried to avoid.</p>
<p>Cause to me, it&rsquo;s like very against the whole idea</p>
<p>of accessibility is should better do things with one GPU.</p>
<p>I mean, have you asked in the past before,</p>
<p>after having accomplished something,</p>
<p>how do I do this faster, much faster?</p>
<p>Oh, always, but it&rsquo;s always, for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always how do I make it much faster on a single GPU</p>
<p>that a normal person could afford in their day to day life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not how could I do it faster by, you know,</p>
<p>having a huge data center.</p>
<p>Cause to me, it&rsquo;s all about like,</p>
<p>as many people should better use something as possible</p>
<p>without fussing around with infrastructure.</p>
<p>So anyways, in this case it&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>we can use eight GPUs just by renting a AWS machine.</p>
<p>So we thought we&rsquo;d try that.</p>
<p>And yeah, basically using the stuff we were already doing,</p>
<p>we were able to get, you know, the speed,</p>
<p>you know, within a few days we had the speed down to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a very small number of minutes.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember exactly how many minutes it was,</p>
<p>but it might&rsquo;ve been like 10 minutes or something.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, we found ourselves</p>
<p>at the top of the leaderboard easily</p>
<p>for both time and money, which really shocked me</p>
<p>cause the other people competing in this</p>
<p>were like Google and Intel and stuff</p>
<p>who I like know a lot more about this stuff</p>
<p>than I think we do.</p>
<p>So then we were emboldened.</p>
<p>We thought let&rsquo;s try the ImageNet one too.</p>
<p>I mean, it seemed way out of our league,</p>
<p>but our goal was to get under 12 hours.</p>
<p>And we did, which was really exciting.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t put anything up on the leaderboard,</p>
<p>but we were down to like 10 hours.</p>
<p>But then Google put in like five hours or something</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just like, oh, we&rsquo;re so screwed.</p>
<p>But we kind of thought, we&rsquo;ll keep trying.</p>
<p>You know, if Google can do it in five,</p>
<p>I mean, Google did on five hours on something</p>
<p>on like a TPU pod or something, like a lot of hardware.</p>
<p>But we kind of like had a bunch of ideas to try.</p>
<p>Like a really simple thing was</p>
<p>why are we using these big images?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like 224 or 256 by 256 pixels.</p>
<p>You know, why don&rsquo;t we try smaller ones?</p>
<p>And just to elaborate, there&rsquo;s a constraint</p>
<p>on the accuracy that your trained model</p>
<p>is supposed to achieve, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you gotta achieve 93%, I think it was,</p>
<p>for ImageNet, exactly.</p>
<p>Which is very tough, so you have to.</p>
<p>Yeah, 93%, like they picked a good threshold.</p>
<p>It was a little bit higher</p>
<p>than what the most commonly used ResNet 50 model</p>
<p>could achieve at that time.</p>
<p>So yeah, so it&rsquo;s quite a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>But yeah, we realized if we actually</p>
<p>just use 64 by 64 images,</p>
<p>it trained a pretty good model.</p>
<p>And then we could take that same model</p>
<p>and just give it a couple of epochs to learn 224 by 224 images.</p>
<p>And it was basically already trained.</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Like if you teach somebody,</p>
<p>like here&rsquo;s what a dog looks like</p>
<p>and you show them low res versions,</p>
<p>and then you say, here&rsquo;s a really clear picture of a dog,</p>
<p>they already know what a dog looks like.</p>
<p>So that like just, we jumped to the front</p>
<p>and we ended up winning parts of that competition.</p>
<p>We actually ended up doing a distributed version</p>
<p>over multiple machines a couple of months later</p>
<p>and ended up at the top of the leaderboard.</p>
<p>We had 18 minutes.</p>
<p>ImageNet.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was,</p>
<p>and people have just kept on blasting through</p>
<p>again and again since then, so.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your view on multi GPU</p>
<p>or multiple machine training in general</p>
<p>as a way to speed code up?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s largely a waste of time.</p>
<p>Both of them.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s largely a waste of time.</p>
<p>Both multi GPU on a single machine and.</p>
<p>Yeah, particularly multi machines,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s just clunky.</p>
<p>Multi GPUs is less clunky than it used to be,</p>
<p>but to me anything that slows down your iteration speed</p>
<p>is a waste of time.</p>
<p>So you could maybe do your very last,</p>
<p>you know, perfecting of the model on multi GPUs</p>
<p>if you need to, but.</p>
<p>So for example, I think doing stuff on ImageNet</p>
<p>is generally a waste of time.</p>
<p>Why test things on 1.3 million images?</p>
<p>Most of us don&rsquo;t use 1.3 million images.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve also done research that shows that</p>
<p>doing things on a smaller subset of images</p>
<p>gives you the same relative answers anyway.</p>
<p>So from a research point of view, why waste that time?</p>
<p>So actually I released a couple of new data sets recently.</p>
<p>One is called ImageNet,</p>
<p>the French ImageNet, which is a small subset of ImageNet,</p>
<p>which is designed to be easy to classify.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, how do you spell ImageNet?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got an extra T and E at the end,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s very French.</p>
<p>And then another one called ImageWolf,</p>
<p>which is a subset of ImageNet that only contains dog breeds.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a hard one, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard one.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve discovered that if you just look at these</p>
<p>two subsets, you can train things on a single GPU</p>
<p>in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And the results you get are directly transferable</p>
<p>to ImageNet nearly all the time.</p>
<p>And so now I&rsquo;m starting to see some researchers</p>
<p>start to use these much smaller data sets.</p>
<p>I so deeply love the way you think,</p>
<p>because I think you might&rsquo;ve written a blog post</p>
<p>saying that sort of going these big data sets</p>
<p>is encouraging people to not think creatively.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re too, it sort of constrains you to train</p>
<p>on large resources.</p>
<p>And because you have these resources,</p>
<p>you think more research will be better.</p>
<p>And then you start, so like somehow you kill the creativity.</p>
<p>Yeah, and even worse than that, Lex,</p>
<p>I keep hearing from people who say,</p>
<p>I decided not to get into deep learning</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s accessible to people</p>
<p>outside of Google to do useful work.</p>
<p>So like I see a lot of people make an explicit decision</p>
<p>to not learn this incredibly valuable tool</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve drunk the Google Koolaid,</p>
<p>which is that only Google&rsquo;s big enough</p>
<p>and smart enough to do it.</p>
<p>And I just find that so disappointing and it&rsquo;s so wrong.</p>
<p>And I think all of the major breakthroughs in AI</p>
<p>in the next 20 years will be doable on a single GPU.</p>
<p>Like I would say, my sense is all the big sort of.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>None of the big breakthroughs of the last 20 years</p>
<p>have required multiple GPUs.</p>
<p>So like batch norm, ReLU, Dropout.</p>
<p>To demonstrate that there&rsquo;s something to them.</p>
<p>Every one of them, none of them has required multiple GPUs.</p>
<p>GANs, the original GANs didn&rsquo;t require multiple GPUs.</p>
<p>Well, and we&rsquo;ve actually recently shown</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t even need GANs.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve developed GAN level outcomes without needing GANs.</p>
<p>And we can now do it with, again,</p>
<p>by using transfer learning,</p>
<p>we can do it in a couple of hours on a single GPU.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just using a generator model</p>
<p>without the adversarial part?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;ve found loss functions</p>
<p>that work super well without the adversarial part.</p>
<p>And then one of our students, a guy called Jason Antich,</p>
<p>has created a system called dealtify,</p>
<p>which uses this technique to colorize</p>
<p>old black and white movies.</p>
<p>You can do it on a single GPU,</p>
<p>colorize a whole movie in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>And one of the things that Jason and I did together</p>
<p>was we figured out how to add a little bit of GAN</p>
<p>at the very end, which it turns out for colorization</p>
<p>makes it just a bit brighter and nicer.</p>
<p>And then Jason did masses of experiments</p>
<p>to figure out exactly how much to do,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still all done on his home machine</p>
<p>on a single GPU in his lounge room.</p>
<p>And if you think about colorizing Hollywood movies,</p>
<p>that sounds like something a huge studio would have to do,</p>
<p>but he has the world&rsquo;s best results on this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this problem of microphones.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just talking to microphones now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a pain in the ass to have these microphones</p>
<p>to get good quality audio.</p>
<p>And I tried to see if it&rsquo;s possible to plop down</p>
<p>a bunch of cheap sensors and reconstruct</p>
<p>higher quality audio from multiple sources.</p>
<p>Because right now I haven&rsquo;t seen the work from,</p>
<p>okay, we can say even expensive mics</p>
<p>automatically combining audio from multiple sources</p>
<p>to improve the combined audio.</p>
<p>People haven&rsquo;t done that.</p>
<p>And that feels like a learning problem.</p>
<p>So hopefully somebody can.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s evidently doable</p>
<p>and it should have been done by now.</p>
<p>I felt the same way about computational photography</p>
<p>four years ago.</p>
<p>Why are we investing in big lenses</p>
<p>when three cheap lenses plus actually</p>
<p>a little bit of intentional movement,</p>
<p>so like take a few frames,</p>
<p>gives you enough information</p>
<p>to get excellent subpixel resolution,</p>
<p>which particularly with deep learning,</p>
<p>you would know exactly what you meant to be looking at.</p>
<p>We can totally do the same thing with audio.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s madness that it hasn&rsquo;t been done yet.</p>
<p>Is there progress on the photography company?</p>
<p>Yeah, photography is basically standard now.</p>
<p>So the Google Pixel Night Light,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever tried it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s astonishing.</p>
<p>You take a picture in almost pitch black</p>
<p>and you get back a very high quality image.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not because of the lens.</p>
<p>Same stuff with like adding the bokeh</p>
<p>to the background blurring,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done computationally.</p>
<p>This is the pixel right here.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically everybody now</p>
<p>is doing most of the fanciest stuff</p>
<p>on their phones with computational photography</p>
<p>and also increasingly people are putting</p>
<p>more than one lens on the back of the camera.</p>
<p>So the same will happen for audio for sure.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s applications in the audio side.</p>
<p>If you look at an Alexa type device,</p>
<p>most people I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>especially I worked at Google before,</p>
<p>when you look at noise background removal,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think of multiple sources of audio.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t play with that as much</p>
<p>as I would hope people would.</p>
<p>But I mean, you can still do it even with one.</p>
<p>Like again, not much work&rsquo;s been done in this area.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re actually gonna be releasing an audio library soon,</p>
<p>which hopefully will encourage development of this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so underused.</p>
<p>The basic approach we used for our super resolution</p>
<p>and which Jason uses for dealtify</p>
<p>of generating high quality images,</p>
<p>the exact same approach would work for audio.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s done it yet,</p>
<p>but it would be a couple of months work.</p>
<p>Okay, also learning rate in terms of Dawn Bench.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some magic on learning rate</p>
<p>that you played around with that&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is all work that came</p>
<p>from a guy called Leslie Smith.</p>
<p>Leslie&rsquo;s a researcher who, like us,</p>
<p>cares a lot about just the practicalities</p>
<p>of training neural networks quickly and accurately,</p>
<p>which I think is what everybody should care about,</p>
<p>but almost nobody does.</p>
<p>And he discovered something very interesting,</p>
<p>which he calls super convergence,</p>
<p>which is there are certain networks</p>
<p>that with certain settings of high parameters</p>
<p>could suddenly be trained 10 times faster</p>
<p>by using a 10 times higher learning rate.</p>
<p>Now, no one published that paper</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not an area of kind of active research</p>
<p>in the academic world.</p>
<p>No academics recognize that this is important.</p>
<p>And also deep learning in academia</p>
<p>is not considered a experimental science.</p>
<p>So unlike in physics where you could say like,</p>
<p>I just saw a subatomic particle do something</p>
<p>which the theory doesn&rsquo;t explain,</p>
<p>you could publish that without an explanation.</p>
<p>And then in the next 60 years,</p>
<p>people can try to work out how to explain it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t allow this in the deep learning world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s literally impossible for Leslie</p>
<p>to publish a paper that says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just seen something amazing happen.</p>
<p>This thing trained 10 times faster than it should have.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>And so the reviewers were like,</p>
<p>well, you can&rsquo;t publish that because you don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>So anyway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important to pause on</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many discoveries</p>
<p>that would need to start like that.</p>
<p>Every other scientific field I know of works that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why ours is uniquely disinterested</p>
<p>in publishing unexplained experimental results,</p>
<p>but there it is.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t published.</p>
<p>Having said that,</p>
<p>I read a lot more unpublished papers than published papers</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where you find the interesting insights.</p>
<p>So I absolutely read this paper.</p>
<p>And I was just like,</p>
<p>this is astonishingly mind blowing and weird</p>
<p>and awesome.</p>
<p>And like, why isn&rsquo;t everybody only talking about this?</p>
<p>Because like, if you can train these things 10 times faster,</p>
<p>they also generalize better</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing less epochs,</p>
<p>which means you look at the data less,</p>
<p>you get better accuracy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been kind of studying that ever since.</p>
<p>And eventually Leslie kind of figured out</p>
<p>a lot of how to get this done.</p>
<p>And we added minor tweaks.</p>
<p>And a big part of the trick</p>
<p>is starting at a very low learning rate,</p>
<p>very gradually increasing it.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;re training your model,</p>
<p>you would take very small steps at the start</p>
<p>and you gradually make them bigger and bigger</p>
<p>until eventually you&rsquo;re taking much bigger steps</p>
<p>than anybody thought was possible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few other little tricks to make it work,</p>
<p>but basically we can reliably get super convergence.</p>
<p>And so for the Dawn Bench thing,</p>
<p>we were using just much higher learning rates</p>
<p>than people expected to work.</p>
<p>What do you think the future of,</p>
<p>I mean, it makes so much sense</p>
<p>for that to be a critical hyperparameter learning rate</p>
<p>that you vary.</p>
<p>What do you think the future</p>
<p>of learning rate magic looks like?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s been a lot of great work</p>
<p>in the last 12 months in this area.</p>
<p>And people are increasingly realizing that optimize,</p>
<p>like we just have no idea really how optimizers work.</p>
<p>And the combination of weight decay,</p>
<p>which is how we regularize optimizers,</p>
<p>and the learning rate,</p>
<p>and then other things like the epsilon we use</p>
<p>in the Adam optimizer,</p>
<p>they all work together in weird ways.</p>
<p>And different parts of the model,</p>
<p>this is another thing we&rsquo;ve done a lot of work on</p>
<p>is research into how different parts of the model</p>
<p>should be trained at different rates in different ways.</p>
<p>So we do something we call discriminative learning rates,</p>
<p>which is really important,</p>
<p>particularly for transfer learning.</p>
<p>So really, I think in the last 12 months,</p>
<p>a lot of people have realized</p>
<p>that all this stuff is important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of great work coming out</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re starting to see algorithms appear,</p>
<p>which have very, very few dials, if any,</p>
<p>that you have to touch.</p>
<p>So I think what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>is the idea of a learning rate,</p>
<p>well, it almost already has disappeared</p>
<p>in the latest research.</p>
<p>And instead, it&rsquo;s just like we know enough</p>
<p>about how to interpret the gradients</p>
<p>and the change of gradients we see</p>
<p>to know how to set every parameter</p>
<p>in an optimal way.</p>
<p>So you see the future of deep learning</p>
<p>where really, where&rsquo;s the input of a human expert needed?</p>
<p>Well, hopefully the input of a human expert</p>
<p>will be almost entirely unneeded</p>
<p>from the deep learning point of view.</p>
<p>So again, like Google&rsquo;s approach to this</p>
<p>is to try and use thousands of times more compute</p>
<p>to run lots and lots of models at the same time</p>
<p>and hope that one of them is good.</p>
<p>AutoML kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, AutoML kind of stuff, which I think is insane.</p>
<p>When you better understand the mechanics</p>
<p>of how models learn,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to try a thousand different models</p>
<p>to find which one happens to work the best.</p>
<p>You can just jump straight to the best one,</p>
<p>which means that it&rsquo;s more accessible</p>
<p>in terms of compute, cheaper,</p>
<p>and also with less hyperparameters to set,</p>
<p>it means you don&rsquo;t need deep learning experts</p>
<p>to train your deep learning model for you,</p>
<p>which means that domain experts can do more of the work,</p>
<p>which means that now you can focus the human time</p>
<p>on the kind of interpretation, the data gathering,</p>
<p>identifying model errors and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, the data side.</p>
<p>How often do you work with data these days</p>
<p>in terms of the cleaning, looking at it?</p>
<p>Like Darwin looked at different species</p>
<p>while traveling about.</p>
<p>Do you look at data?</p>
<p>Have you in your roots in Kaggle?</p>
<p>Always, yeah.</p>
<p>Look at data.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a key part of our course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like before we train a model in the course,</p>
<p>we see how to look at the data.</p>
<p>And then the first thing we do</p>
<p>after we train our first model,</p>
<p>which we fine tune an ImageNet model for five minutes.</p>
<p>And then the thing we immediately do after that</p>
<p>is we learn how to analyze the results of the model</p>
<p>by looking at examples of misclassified images</p>
<p>and looking at a classification matrix,</p>
<p>and then doing research on Google</p>
<p>to learn about the kinds of things that it&rsquo;s misclassifying.</p>
<p>So to me, one of the really cool things</p>
<p>about machine learning models in general</p>
<p>is that when you interpret them,</p>
<p>they tell you about things like</p>
<p>what are the most important features,</p>
<p>which groups are you misclassifying,</p>
<p>and they help you become a domain expert more quickly</p>
<p>because you can focus your time on the bits</p>
<p>that the model is telling you is important.</p>
<p>So it lets you deal with things like data leakage,</p>
<p>for example, if it says,</p>
<p>oh, the main feature I&rsquo;m looking at is customer ID.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, oh, customer ID should be predictive.</p>
<p>And then you can talk to the people</p>
<p>that manage customer IDs and they&rsquo;ll tell you like,</p>
<p>oh yes, as soon as a customer&rsquo;s application is accepted,</p>
<p>we add a one on the end of their customer ID or something.</p>
<p>So yeah, looking at data,</p>
<p>particularly from the lens of which parts of the data</p>
<p>the model says is important is super important.</p>
<p>Yeah, and using the model to almost debug the data</p>
<p>to learn more about the data.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What are the different cloud options</p>
<p>for training your own networks?</p>
<p>Last question related to DawnBench.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s part of a lot of the work you do,</p>
<p>but from a perspective of performance,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve written this in a blog post.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s AWS, there&rsquo;s TPU from Google.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>What the future holds?</p>
<p>What would you recommend now in terms of training?</p>
<p>So from a hardware point of view,</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s TPUs and the best Nvidia GPUs are similar.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe the TPUs are like 30% faster,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also much harder to program.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a clear leader in terms of hardware right now,</p>
<p>although much more importantly,</p>
<p>the Nvidia GPUs are much more programmable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got much more written for all of them.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s the clear leader for me</p>
<p>and where I would spend my time</p>
<p>as a researcher and practitioner.</p>
<p>But then in terms of the platform,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re super lucky now with stuff like Google GCP,</p>
<p>Google Cloud, and AWS that you can access a GPU</p>
<p>pretty quickly and easily.</p>
<p>But I mean, for AWS, it&rsquo;s still too hard.</p>
<p>Like you have to find an AMI and get the instance running</p>
<p>and then install the software you want and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>GCP is currently the best way to get started</p>
<p>on a full server environment</p>
<p>because they have a fantastic fast AI in PyTorch ready</p>
<p>to go instance, which has all the courses preinstalled.</p>
<p>It has Jupyter Notebook pre running.</p>
<p>Jupyter Notebook is this wonderful</p>
<p>interactive computing system,</p>
<p>which everybody basically should be using</p>
<p>for any kind of data driven research.</p>
<p>But then even better than that,</p>
<p>there are platforms like Salamander, which we own</p>
<p>and Paperspace, where literally you click a single button</p>
<p>and it pops up a Jupyter Notebook straight away</p>
<p>without any kind of installation or anything.</p>
<p>And all the course notebooks are all preinstalled.</p>
<p>So like for me, this is one of the things</p>
<p>we spent a lot of time kind of curating and working on.</p>
<p>Because when we first started our courses,</p>
<p>the biggest problem was people dropped out of lesson one</p>
<p>because they couldn&rsquo;t get an AWS instance running.</p>
<p>So things are so much better now.</p>
<p>And like we actually have, if you go to course.fast.ai,</p>
<p>the first thing it says is here&rsquo;s how to get started</p>
<p>with your GPU.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like, you just click on the link</p>
<p>and you click start and you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll go GCP.</p>
<p>I have to confess, I&rsquo;ve never used the Google GCP.</p>
<p>Yeah, GCP gives you $300 of compute for free,</p>
<p>which is really nice.</p>
<p>But as I say, Salamander and Paperspace</p>
<p>are even easier still.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So from the perspective of deep learning frameworks,</p>
<p>you work with fast.ai, if you go to this framework,</p>
<p>and PyTorch and TensorFlow.</p>
<p>What are the strengths of each platform in your perspective?</p>
<p>So in terms of what we&rsquo;ve done our research on</p>
<p>and taught in our course,</p>
<p>we started with Theano and Keras,</p>
<p>and then we switched to TensorFlow and Keras,</p>
<p>and then we switched to PyTorch,</p>
<p>and then we switched to PyTorch and fast.ai.</p>
<p>And that kind of reflects a growth and development</p>
<p>of the ecosystem of deep learning libraries.</p>
<p>Theano and TensorFlow were great,</p>
<p>but were much harder to teach and to do research</p>
<p>and development on because they define</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called a computational graph upfront,</p>
<p>a static graph, where you basically have to say,</p>
<p>here are all the things that I&rsquo;m gonna eventually do</p>
<p>in my model, and then later on you say,</p>
<p>okay, do those things with this data.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t like debug them,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do them step by step,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t program them interactively</p>
<p>in a Jupyter notebook and so forth.</p>
<p>PyTorch was not the first,</p>
<p>but PyTorch was certainly the strongest entrant</p>
<p>to come along and say, let&rsquo;s not do it that way,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just use normal Python.</p>
<p>And everything you know about in Python</p>
<p>is just gonna work, and we&rsquo;ll figure out</p>
<p>how to make that run on the GPU as and when necessary.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a huge leap</p>
<p>in terms of what we could do with our research</p>
<p>and what we could do with our teaching.</p>
<p>Because it wasn&rsquo;t limiting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it was critical for us</p>
<p>for something like DawnBench</p>
<p>to be able to rapidly try things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so much harder to be a researcher</p>
<p>and practitioner when you have to do everything upfront</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t inspect it.</p>
<p>Problem with PyTorch is it&rsquo;s not at all accessible</p>
<p>to newcomers because you have to like</p>
<p>write your own training loop and manage the gradients</p>
<p>and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also like not great for researchers</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re spending your time dealing</p>
<p>with all this boilerplate and overhead</p>
<p>rather than thinking about your algorithm.</p>
<p>So we ended up writing this very multi layered API</p>
<p>that at the top level, you can train</p>
<p>a state of the art neural network</p>
<p>in three lines of code.</p>
<p>And which kind of talks to an API,</p>
<p>which talks to an API, which talks to an API,</p>
<p>which like you can dive into at any level</p>
<p>and get progressively closer to the machine</p>
<p>kind of levels of control.</p>
<p>And this is the fast AI library.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been critical for us and for our students</p>
<p>and for lots of people that have won deep learning</p>
<p>competitions with it and written academic papers with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made a big difference.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still limited though by Python.</p>
<p>And particularly this problem with things like</p>
<p>recurrent neural nets say where you just can&rsquo;t change things</p>
<p>unless you accept it going so slowly that it&rsquo;s impractical.</p>
<p>So in the latest incarnation of the course</p>
<p>and with some of the research we&rsquo;re now starting to do,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting to do stuff, some stuff in Swift.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re three years away from that</p>
<p>being super practical, but I&rsquo;m in no hurry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy to invest the time to get there.</p>
<p>But with that, we actually already have a nascent version</p>
<p>of the fast AI library for vision running</p>
<p>on Swift and TensorFlow.</p>
<p>Cause a Python for TensorFlow is not gonna cut it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a disaster.</p>
<p>What they did was they tried to replicate</p>
<p>the bits that people were saying they like about PyTorch,</p>
<p>this kind of interactive computation,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t actually change</p>
<p>their foundational runtime components.</p>
<p>So they kind of added this like syntax sugar</p>
<p>they call TF Eager, TensorFlow Eager,</p>
<p>which makes it look a lot like PyTorch,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s 10 times slower than PyTorch</p>
<p>to actually do a step.</p>
<p>So because they didn&rsquo;t invest the time in like retooling</p>
<p>the foundations, cause their code base is so horribly</p>
<p>complex.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s probably very difficult</p>
<p>to do that kind of retooling.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, particularly the way TensorFlow was written,</p>
<p>it was written by a lot of people very quickly</p>
<p>in a very disorganized way.</p>
<p>So like when you actually look in the code,</p>
<p>as I do often, I&rsquo;m always just like,</p>
<p>Oh God, what were they thinking?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s pretty awful.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really extremely negative</p>
<p>about the potential future for Python for TensorFlow.</p>
<p>But Swift for TensorFlow can be a different beast altogether.</p>
<p>It can be like, it can basically be a layer on top of MLIR</p>
<p>that takes advantage of, you know,</p>
<p>all the great compiler stuff that Swift builds on with LLVM</p>
<p>and yeah, I think it will be absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re inspiring me to try.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t truly felt the pain of TensorFlow 2.0 Python.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine by me, but of&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it does the job</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re using like predefined things</p>
<p>that somebody has already written.</p>
<p>But if you actually compare, you know,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve had to do,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve been having to do a lot of stuff</p>
<p>with TensorFlow recently,</p>
<p>you actually compare like,</p>
<p>okay, I want to write something from scratch</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, I just keep finding it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s running 10 times slower than PyTorch.</p>
<p>So is the biggest cost,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s throw running time out the window.</p>
<p>How long it takes you to program?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not too different now,</p>
<p>thanks to TensorFlow Eager, that&rsquo;s not too different.</p>
<p>But because so many things take so long to run,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t run it at 10 times slower.</p>
<p>Like you just go like, Oh, this is taking too long.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>which are just less programmable,</p>
<p>like tf.data, which is the way data processing works</p>
<p>in TensorFlow is just this big mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly inefficient.</p>
<p>And they kind of had to write it that way</p>
<p>because of the TPU problems I described earlier.</p>
<p>So I just, you know,</p>
<p>I just feel like they&rsquo;ve got this huge technical debt,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re not going to solve</p>
<p>without starting from scratch.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an interesting question then,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a new student starting today,</p>
<p>what would you recommend they use?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we obviously recommend Fastai and PyTorch</p>
<p>because we teach new students and that&rsquo;s what we teach with.</p>
<p>So we would very strongly recommend that</p>
<p>because it will let you get on top of the concepts</p>
<p>much more quickly.</p>
<p>So then you&rsquo;ll become an actual,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll also learn the actual state</p>
<p>of the art techniques, you know,</p>
<p>so you actually get world class results.</p>
<p>Honestly, it doesn&rsquo;t much matter what library you learn</p>
<p>because switching from the trainer to MXNet</p>
<p>to TensorFlow to PyTorch is gonna be a couple of days work</p>
<p>as long as you understand the foundation as well.</p>
<p>But you think will Swift creep in there</p>
<p>as a thing that people start using?</p>
<p>Not for a few years,</p>
<p>particularly because like Swift has no data science</p>
<p>community, libraries, schooling.</p>
<p>And the Swift community has a total lack of appreciation</p>
<p>and understanding of numeric computing.</p>
<p>So like they keep on making stupid decisions, you know,</p>
<p>for years, they&rsquo;ve just done dumb things</p>
<p>around performance and prioritization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clearly changing now</p>
<p>because the developer of Swift, Chris Latner,</p>
<p>is working at Google on Swift for TensorFlow.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s a priority.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what happens with Apple</p>
<p>because like Apple hasn&rsquo;t shown any sign of caring</p>
<p>about numeric programming in Swift.</p>
<p>So I mean, hopefully they&rsquo;ll get off their ass</p>
<p>and start appreciating this</p>
<p>because currently all of their low level libraries</p>
<p>are not written in Swift.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not particularly Swifty at all,</p>
<p>stuff like CoreML, they&rsquo;re really pretty rubbish.</p>
<p>So yeah, so there&rsquo;s a long way to go.</p>
<p>But at least one nice thing is that Swift for TensorFlow</p>
<p>can actually directly use Python code and Python libraries</p>
<p>in a literally the entire lesson one notebook of fast AI</p>
<p>runs in Swift right now in Python mode.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a nice intermediate thing.</p>
<p>How long does it take?</p>
<p>If you look at the two fast AI courses,</p>
<p>how long does it take to get from point zero</p>
<p>to completing both courses?</p>
<p>It varies a lot.</p>
<p>Somewhere between two months and two years generally.</p>
<p>So for two months, how many hours a day on average?</p>
<p>So like somebody who is a very competent coder</p>
<p>can do 70 hours per course and pick up 70.</p>
<p>70, seven zero, that&rsquo;s it, okay.</p>
<p>But a lot of people I know take a year off</p>
<p>to study fast AI full time and say at the end of the year,</p>
<p>they feel pretty competent</p>
<p>because generally there&rsquo;s a lot of other things you do</p>
<p>like generally they&rsquo;ll be entering Kaggle competitions,</p>
<p>they might be reading Ian Goodfellow&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>they might, they&rsquo;ll be doing a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>and often particularly if they are a domain expert,</p>
<p>their coding skills might be a little</p>
<p>on the pedestrian side.</p>
<p>So part of it&rsquo;s just like doing a lot more writing.</p>
<p>What do you find is the bottleneck for people usually</p>
<p>except getting started and setting stuff up?</p>
<p>I would say coding.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say the best,</p>
<p>the people who are strong coders pick it up the best.</p>
<p>Although another bottleneck is people who have a lot</p>
<p>of experience of classic statistics can really struggle</p>
<p>because the intuition is so the opposite</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very used to like trying to reduce the number</p>
<p>of parameters in their model</p>
<p>and looking at individual coefficients and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So I find people who have a lot of coding background</p>
<p>and know nothing about statistics</p>
<p>are generally gonna be the best off.</p>
<p>So you taught several courses on deep learning</p>
<p>and as Feynman says,</p>
<p>best way to understand something is to teach it.</p>
<p>What have you learned about deep learning from teaching it?</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a key reason for me to teach the courses.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously it&rsquo;s gonna be necessary</p>
<p>to achieve our goal of getting domain experts</p>
<p>to be familiar with deep learning,</p>
<p>but it was also necessary for me to achieve my goal</p>
<p>of being really familiar with deep learning.</p>
<p>I mean, to see so many domain experts</p>
<p>from so many different backgrounds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely, I wouldn&rsquo;t say taught me,</p>
<p>but convinced me something that I liked to believe was true,</p>
<p>which was anyone can do it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of snobbishness out there</p>
<p>about only certain people can learn to code.</p>
<p>Only certain people are gonna be smart enough</p>
<p>like do AI, that&rsquo;s definitely bullshit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen so many people from so many different backgrounds</p>
<p>get state of the art results in their domain areas now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely taught me that the key differentiator</p>
<p>between people that succeed</p>
<p>and people that fail is tenacity.</p>
<p>That seems to be basically the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>A lot of people give up.</p>
<p>But of the ones who don&rsquo;t give up,</p>
<p>pretty much everybody succeeds.</p>
<p>Even if at first I&rsquo;m just kind of like thinking like,</p>
<p>wow, they really aren&rsquo;t quite getting it yet, are they?</p>
<p>But eventually people get it and they succeed.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re both things I liked to believe was true,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t feel like I really had strong evidence</p>
<p>for them to be true,</p>
<p>but now I can say I&rsquo;ve seen it again and again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it again and again. So what advice do you have</p>
<p>for someone who wants to get started in deep learning?</p>
<p>Train lots of models.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you learn it.</p>
<p>So I think, it&rsquo;s not just me,</p>
<p>I think our course is very good,</p>
<p>but also lots of people independently</p>
<p>have said it&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>It recently won the COGx award for AI courses</p>
<p>as being the best in the world.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say come to our course, course.fast.ai.</p>
<p>And the thing I keep on hopping on in my lessons</p>
<p>is train models, print out the inputs to the models,</p>
<p>print out to the outputs to the models,</p>
<p>like study, change the inputs a bit,</p>
<p>look at how the outputs vary,</p>
<p>just run lots of experiments</p>
<p>to get an intuitive understanding of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>To get hooked, do you think, you mentioned training,</p>
<p>do you think just running the models inference,</p>
<p>like if we talk about getting started?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;ve got to fine tune the models.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the critical thing,</p>
<p>because at that point you now have a model</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in your domain area.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no point running somebody else&rsquo;s model</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not your model.</p>
<p>So it only takes five minutes to fine tune a model</p>
<p>for the data you care about.</p>
<p>And in lesson two of the course,</p>
<p>we teach you how to create your own data set from scratch</p>
<p>by scripting Google image search.</p>
<p>So, and we show you how to actually create</p>
<p>a web application running online.</p>
<p>So I create one in the course that differentiates</p>
<p>between a teddy bear, a grizzly bear and a brown bear.</p>
<p>And it does it with basically 100% accuracy,</p>
<p>took me about four minutes to scrape the images</p>
<p>from Google search in the script.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little graphical widgets we have in the notebook</p>
<p>that help you clean up the data set.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other widgets that help you study the results</p>
<p>to see where the errors are happening.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;ve got over a thousand replies</p>
<p>in our share your work here thread</p>
<p>of students saying, here&rsquo;s the thing I built.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s people who like,</p>
<p>and a lot of them are state of the art.</p>
<p>Like somebody said, oh, I tried looking</p>
<p>at Devangari characters and I couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>The thing that came out was more accurate</p>
<p>than the best academic paper after lesson one.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s others which are just more kind of fun,</p>
<p>like somebody who&rsquo;s doing Trinidad and Tobago hummingbirds.</p>
<p>She said that&rsquo;s kind of their national bird</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s got something that can now classify Trinidad</p>
<p>and Tobago hummingbirds.</p>
<p>So yeah, train models, fine tune models with your data set</p>
<p>and then study their inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>How much is Fast.ai courses?</p>
<p>Free.</p>
<p>Everything we do is free.</p>
<p>We have no revenue sources of any kind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a service to the community.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a saint.</p>
<p>Okay, once a person understands the basics,</p>
<p>trains a bunch of models,</p>
<p>if we look at the scale of years,</p>
<p>what advice do you have for someone wanting</p>
<p>to eventually become an expert?</p>
<p>Train lots of models.</p>
<p>But specifically train lots of models in your domain area.</p>
<p>So an expert what, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need more expert,</p>
<p>like create slightly evolutionary research in areas</p>
<p>that everybody&rsquo;s studying.</p>
<p>We need experts at using deep learning</p>
<p>to diagnose malaria.</p>
<p>Or we need experts at using deep learning</p>
<p>to analyze language to study media bias.</p>
<p>So we need experts in analyzing fisheries</p>
<p>to identify problem areas in the ocean.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we need.</p>
<p>So become the expert in your passion area.</p>
<p>And this is a tool which you can use for just about anything</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to do that thing better</p>
<p>than other people, particularly by combining it</p>
<p>with your passion and domain expertise.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Even if you do wanna innovate on transfer learning</p>
<p>or active learning, your thought is,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one I certainly share,</p>
<p>is you also need to find a domain or data set</p>
<p>that you actually really care for.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not working on a real problem that you understand,</p>
<p>how do you know if you&rsquo;re doing it any good?</p>
<p>How do you know if your results are good?</p>
<p>How do you know if you&rsquo;re getting bad results?</p>
<p>Why are you getting bad results?</p>
<p>Is it a problem with the data?</p>
<p>Like, how do you know you&rsquo;re doing anything useful?</p>
<p>Yeah, to me, the only really interesting research is,</p>
<p>not the only, but the vast majority</p>
<p>of interesting research is like,</p>
<p>try and solve an actual problem and solve it really well.</p>
<p>So both understanding sufficient tools</p>
<p>on the deep learning side and becoming a domain expert</p>
<p>in a particular domain are really things</p>
<p>within reach for anybody.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, to me, I would compare it</p>
<p>to like studying self driving cars,</p>
<p>having never looked at a car or been in a car</p>
<p>or turned a car on, which is like the way it is</p>
<p>for a lot of people, they&rsquo;ll study some academic data set</p>
<p>where they literally have no idea about that.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m not sure how familiar</p>
<p>with autonomous vehicles, but that is literally,</p>
<p>you describe a large percentage of robotics folks</p>
<p>working in self driving cars is they actually</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t considered driving.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t actually looked at what driving looks like.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t driven.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a problem because you know,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve actually driven, you know,</p>
<p>like these are the things that happened</p>
<p>to me when I was driving.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that beats the real world examples</p>
<p>of just experiencing them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve created many successful startups.</p>
<p>What does it take to create a successful startup?</p>
<p>Same thing as becoming a successful</p>
<p>deep learning practitioner, which is not giving up.</p>
<p>So you can run out of money or run out of time</p>
<p>or run out of something, you know,</p>
<p>but if you keep costs super low</p>
<p>and try and save up some money beforehand</p>
<p>so you can afford to have some time,</p>
<p>then just sticking with it is one important thing.</p>
<p>Doing something you understand and care about is important.</p>
<p>By something, I don&rsquo;t mean,</p>
<p>the biggest problem I see with deep learning people</p>
<p>is they do a PhD in deep learning</p>
<p>and then they try and commercialize their PhD.</p>
<p>It is a waste of time</p>
<p>because that doesn&rsquo;t solve an actual problem.</p>
<p>You picked your PhD topic</p>
<p>because it was an interesting kind of engineering</p>
<p>or math or research exercise.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you&rsquo;ve actually spent time as a recruiter</p>
<p>and you know that most of your time was spent</p>
<p>sifting through resumes</p>
<p>and you know that most of the time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just looking for certain kinds of things</p>
<p>and you can try doing that with a model for a few minutes</p>
<p>and see whether that&rsquo;s something which a model</p>
<p>seems to be able to do as well as you could,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re on the right track to creating a startup.</p>
<p>And then I think just, yeah, being, just be pragmatic and</p>
<p>try and stay away from venture capital money</p>
<p>as long as possible, preferably forever.</p>
<p>So yeah, on that point, do you venture capital?</p>
<p>So did you, were you able to successfully run startups</p>
<p>with self funded for quite a while?</p>
<p>Yeah, so my first two were self funded</p>
<p>and that was the right way to do it.</p>
<p>Is that scary?</p>
<p>No, VC startups are much more scary</p>
<p>because you have these people on your back</p>
<p>who do this all the time and who have done it for years</p>
<p>telling you grow, grow, grow, grow.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t care if you fail.</p>
<p>They only care if you don&rsquo;t grow fast enough.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>Whereas doing the ones myself, well, with partners</p>
<p>who were friends was nice</p>
<p>because like we just went along at a pace that made sense</p>
<p>and we were able to build it to something</p>
<p>which was big enough that we never had to work again</p>
<p>but was not big enough that any VC</p>
<p>would think it was impressive.</p>
<p>And that was enough for us to be excited, you know?</p>
<p>So I thought that&rsquo;s a much better way</p>
<p>to do things than most people.</p>
<p>In generally speaking, not for yourself</p>
<p>but how do you make money during that process?</p>
<p>Do you cut into savings?</p>
<p>So yeah, so for, so I started Fast Mail</p>
<p>and Optimal Decisions at the same time in 1999</p>
<p>with two different friends.</p>
<p>And for Fast Mail, I guess I spent $70 a month</p>
<p>on the server.</p>
<p>And when the server ran out of space</p>
<p>I put a payments button on the front page</p>
<p>and said, if you want more than 10 mega space</p>
<p>you have to pay $10 a year.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>So run low, like keep your costs down.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I kept my costs down.</p>
<p>And once, you know, once I needed to spend more money</p>
<p>I asked people to spend the money for me.</p>
<p>And that, that was that.</p>
<p>Basically from then on, we were making money</p>
<p>and I was profitable from then.</p>
<p>For Optimal Decisions, it was a bit harder</p>
<p>because we were trying to sell something</p>
<p>that was more like a $1 million sale.</p>
<p>But what we did was we would sell scoping projects.</p>
<p>So kind of like prototypy projects</p>
<p>but rather than doing it for free</p>
<p>we would sell them 50 to $100,000.</p>
<p>So again, we were covering our costs</p>
<p>and also making the client feel</p>
<p>like we were doing something valuable.</p>
<p>So in both cases, we were profitable from six months in.</p>
<p>Ah, nevertheless, it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s scary before you jump in</p>
<p>and I just, I guess I was comparing it</p>
<p>to the scarediness of VC.</p>
<p>I felt like with VC stuff, it was more scary.</p>
<p>Kind of much more in somebody else&rsquo;s hands,</p>
<p>will they fund you or not?</p>
<p>And what do they think of what you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>I also found it very difficult with VCs,</p>
<p>back startups to actually do the thing</p>
<p>which I thought was important for the company</p>
<p>rather than doing the thing</p>
<p>which I thought would make the VC happy.</p>
<p>And VCs always tell you not to do the thing</p>
<p>that makes them happy.</p>
<p>But then if you don&rsquo;t do the thing that makes them happy</p>
<p>they get sad, so.</p>
<p>And do you think optimizing for the,</p>
<p>whatever they call it, the exit is a good thing</p>
<p>to optimize for?</p>
<p>I mean, it can be, but not at the VC level</p>
<p>because the VC exit needs to be, you know, a thousand X.</p>
<p>So where else the lifestyle exit,</p>
<p>if you can sell something for $10 million,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve made it, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, it depends.</p>
<p>If you want to build something that&rsquo;s gonna,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of happy to do forever, then fine.</p>
<p>If you want to build something you want to sell</p>
<p>in three years time, that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re both perfectly good outcomes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re learning Swift now, in a way.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to.</p>
<p>And I read that you use, at least in some cases,</p>
<p>space repetition as a mechanism for learning new things.</p>
<p>I use Anki quite a lot myself.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>I actually never talk to anybody about it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how many people do it,</p>
<p>but it works incredibly well for me.</p>
<p>Can you talk to your experience?</p>
<p>Like how did you, what do you?</p>
<p>First of all, okay, let&rsquo;s back it up.</p>
<p>What is space repetition?</p>
<p>So space repetition is an idea created</p>
<p>by a psychologist named Ebbinghaus.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, must be a couple of hundred years ago</p>
<p>or something, 150 years ago.</p>
<p>He did something which sounds pretty damn tedious.</p>
<p>He wrote down random sequences of letters on cards</p>
<p>and tested how well he would remember</p>
<p>those random sequences a day later, a week later, whatever.</p>
<p>He discovered that there was this kind of a curve</p>
<p>where his probability of remembering one of them</p>
<p>would be dramatically smaller the next day</p>
<p>and then a little bit smaller the next day</p>
<p>and a little bit smaller the next day.</p>
<p>What he discovered is that if he revised those cards</p>
<p>after a day, the probabilities would decrease</p>
<p>at a smaller rate.</p>
<p>And then if you revise them again a week later,</p>
<p>they would decrease at a smaller rate again.</p>
<p>And so he basically figured out a roughly optimal equation</p>
<p>for when you should revise something you wanna remember.</p>
<p>So space repetition learning is using this simple algorithm,</p>
<p>just something like revise something after a day</p>
<p>and then three days and then a week and then three weeks</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And so if you use a program like Anki, as you know,</p>
<p>it will just do that for you.</p>
<p>And it will say, did you remember this?</p>
<p>And if you say no, it will reschedule it back</p>
<p>to appear again like 10 times faster</p>
<p>than it otherwise would have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of a way of being guaranteed to learn something</p>
<p>because by definition, if you&rsquo;re not learning it,</p>
<p>it will be rescheduled to be revised more quickly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, it&rsquo;s also like,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t let you fool yourself.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not learning something,</p>
<p>you know like your revisions will just get more and more.</p>
<p>So you have to find ways to learn things productively</p>
<p>and effectively like treat your brain well.</p>
<p>So using like mnemonics and stories and context</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s a super great technique.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like learning how to learn is something</p>
<p>which everybody should learn</p>
<p>before they actually learn anything.</p>
<p>But almost nobody does.</p>
<p>So what have you, so it certainly works well</p>
<p>for learning new languages for, I mean,</p>
<p>for learning like small projects almost.</p>
<p>But do you, you know, I started using it for,</p>
<p>I forget who wrote a blog post about this inspired me.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve been you, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I started when I read papers,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll concepts and ideas, I&rsquo;ll put them.</p>
<p>Was it Michael Nielsen?</p>
<p>It was Michael Nielsen.</p>
<p>So Michael started doing this recently</p>
<p>and has been writing about it.</p>
<p>So the kind of today&rsquo;s Ebbinghaus</p>
<p>is a guy called Peter Wozniak</p>
<p>who developed a system called SuperMemo.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been basically trying to become like</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s greatest Renaissance man</p>
<p>over the last few decades.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically lived his life</p>
<p>with space repetition learning for everything.</p>
<p>I, and sort of like,</p>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s only very recently got into this,</p>
<p>but he started really getting excited</p>
<p>about doing it for a lot of different things.</p>
<p>For me personally, I actually don&rsquo;t use it</p>
<p>for anything except Chinese.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that</p>
<p>Chinese is specifically a thing I made a conscious decision</p>
<p>that I want to continue to remember,</p>
<p>even if I don&rsquo;t get much of a chance to exercise it,</p>
<p>cause like I&rsquo;m not often in China, so I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Or else something like programming languages or papers.</p>
<p>I have a very different approach,</p>
<p>which is I try not to learn anything from them,</p>
<p>but instead I try to identify the important concepts</p>
<p>and like actually ingest them.</p>
<p>So like really understand that concept deeply</p>
<p>and study it carefully.</p>
<p>I will decide if it really is important,</p>
<p>if it is like incorporated into our library,</p>
<p>you know, incorporated into how I do things</p>
<p>or decide it&rsquo;s not worth it, say.</p>
<p>So I find, I find I then remember the things</p>
<p>that I care about because I&rsquo;m using it all the time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve, for the last 25 years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve committed to spending at least half of every day</p>
<p>learning or practicing something new,</p>
<p>which is all my colleagues have always hated</p>
<p>because it always looks like I&rsquo;m not working on</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m meant to be working on,</p>
<p>but it always means I do everything faster</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been practicing a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>So I kind of give myself a lot of opportunity</p>
<p>to practice new things.</p>
<p>And so I find now I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>yeah, I don&rsquo;t often kind of find myself</p>
<p>wishing I could remember something</p>
<p>because if it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s useful,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ve been using it a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy enough to look it up on Google,</p>
<p>but speaking Chinese, you can&rsquo;t look it up on Google.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for people learning new things?</p>
<p>So if you, what have you learned as a process as a,</p>
<p>I mean, it all starts with just making the hours</p>
<p>and the day available.</p>
<p>Yeah, you got to stick with it,</p>
<p>which is again, the number one thing</p>
<p>that 99% of people don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>So the people I started learning Chinese with,</p>
<p>none of them were still doing it 12 months later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still doing it 10 years later.</p>
<p>I tried to stay in touch with them,</p>
<p>but they just, no one did it.</p>
<p>For something like Chinese,</p>
<p>like study how human learning works.</p>
<p>So every one of my Chinese flashcards</p>
<p>is associated with a story.</p>
<p>And that story is specifically designed to be memorable.</p>
<p>And we find things memorable,</p>
<p>which are like funny or disgusting or sexy</p>
<p>or related to people that we know or care about.</p>
<p>So I try to make sure all of the stories</p>
<p>that are in my head have those characteristics.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you have to, you know,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t remember things well</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t have some context.</p>
<p>And yeah, you won&rsquo;t remember them well</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t regularly practice them,</p>
<p>whether it be just part of your day to day life</p>
<p>or the Chinese and me flashcards.</p>
<p>I mean, the other thing is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let yourself fail sometimes.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;ve had various medical problems</p>
<p>over the last few years.</p>
<p>And basically my flashcards</p>
<p>just stopped for about three years.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been other times I&rsquo;ve stopped for a few months</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so hard because you get back to it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you have 18,000 cards due.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and so you just have to go, all right,</p>
<p>well, I can either stop and give up everything</p>
<p>or just decide to do this every day for the next two years</p>
<p>until I get back to it.</p>
<p>The amazing thing has been that even after three years,</p>
<p>I, you know, the Chinese were still in there.</p>
<p>Like it was so much faster to relearn</p>
<p>than it was to learn the first time.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>I have the same with guitar, with music and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad because the work sometimes takes away</p>
<p>and then you won&rsquo;t play for a year.</p>
<p>But really, if you then just get back to it every day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right there again.</p>
<p>What do you think is the next big breakthrough</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>What are your hopes in deep learning or beyond</p>
<p>that people should be working on</p>
<p>or you hope there&rsquo;ll be breakthroughs?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to predict.</p>
<p>I think what we already have</p>
<p>is an incredibly powerful platform</p>
<p>to solve lots of societally important problems</p>
<p>that are currently unsolved.</p>
<p>So I just hope that people will,</p>
<p>lots of people will learn this toolkit and try to use it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we need a lot of new technological breakthroughs</p>
<p>to do a lot of great work right now.</p>
<p>And when do you think we&rsquo;re going to create</p>
<p>a human level intelligence system?</p>
<p>Do you think?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>How hard is it?</p>
<p>How far away are we?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have no way to know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why people make predictions about this</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no data and nothing to go on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many societally important problems</p>
<p>to solve right now.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t find it a really interesting question</p>
<p>to even answer.</p>
<p>So in terms of societally important problems,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the problem that is within reach?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, for example,</p>
<p>there are problems that AI creates, right?</p>
<p>So more specifically,</p>
<p>labor force displacement is going to be huge</p>
<p>and people keep making this</p>
<p>frivolous econometric argument of being like,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s been other things that aren&rsquo;t AI</p>
<p>that have come along before</p>
<p>and haven&rsquo;t created massive labor force displacement,</p>
<p>therefore AI won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a serious concern for you?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Andrew Yang is running on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m desperately concerned.</p>
<p>And you see already that the changing workplace</p>
<p>has led to a hollowing out of the middle class.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing that students coming out of school today</p>
<p>have a less rosy financial future ahead of them</p>
<p>than their parents did,</p>
<p>which has never happened in recent,</p>
<p>in the last few hundred years.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve always had progress before.</p>
<p>And you see this turning into anxiety</p>
<p>and despair and even violence.</p>
<p>So I very much worry about that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written quite a bit about ethics too.</p>
<p>I do think that every data scientist</p>
<p>working with deep learning needs to recognize</p>
<p>they have an incredibly high leverage tool</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re using that can influence society</p>
<p>in lots of ways.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re doing research,</p>
<p>that that research is gonna be used by people</p>
<p>doing this kind of work.</p>
<p>And they have a responsibility to consider the consequences</p>
<p>and to think about things like</p>
<p>how will humans be in the loop here?</p>
<p>How do we avoid runaway feedback loops?</p>
<p>How do we ensure an appeals process for humans</p>
<p>that are impacted by my algorithm?</p>
<p>How do I ensure that the constraints of my algorithm</p>
<p>are adequately explained to the people</p>
<p>that end up using them?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of human issues</p>
<p>which only data scientists are actually</p>
<p>in the right place to educate people are about,</p>
<p>but data scientists tend to think of themselves</p>
<p>as just engineers and that they don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to be part of that process, which is wrong.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re in the perfect position to educate them better,</p>
<p>to read literature, to read history, to learn from history.</p>
<p>Well, Jeremy, thank you so much for everything you do</p>
<p>for inspiring huge amount of people,</p>
<p>getting them into deep learning</p>
<p>and having the ripple effects,</p>
<p>the flap of a butterfly&rsquo;s wings</p>
<p>that will probably change the world.</p>
<p>So thank you very much.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
