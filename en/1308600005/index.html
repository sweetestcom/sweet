    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>Along those lines, I want to thank today&rsquo;s sponsors</p>
<p>of the podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase, they&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work,</p>
<p>babies, kids, and the elderly,</p>
<p>and we are going to discuss protocols</p>
<p>that are backed by science.</p>
<p>That means quality peer-reviewed papers</p>
<p>published in excellent journals</p>
<p>that can support particular tools</p>
<p>that you can use to combat things like jet lag,</p>
<p>offset some of the negative effects of shift work,</p>
<p>and make life easier for the new parent,</p>
<p>as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent,</p>
<p>anyone that wants to sleep better,</p>
<p>feel better when they&rsquo;re awake, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve listened to the previous three episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been exploring these themes</p>
<p>of wakefulness and sleepiness,</p>
<p>how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been discussing parameters</p>
<p>like light, exercise, temperature, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s discussion will be even more digestible for you.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I will provide a little bit of background here or there</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s not necessary</p>
<p>that you have listened to those previous episodes,</p>
<p>but if you get a chance to listen to them, please do.</p>
<p>I think it will help you digest the information better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just take a step back for a moment</p>
<p>and remind everybody what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about an endogenous, meaning within us,</p>
<p>rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour rhythm</p>
<p>in all sorts of functions.</p>
<p>The most prominent one is a rhythm</p>
<p>in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.</p>
<p>So believe it or not,</p>
<p>the experiment has been done throughout history,</p>
<p>not often, but it&rsquo;s been done</p>
<p>where people will go down into a cave</p>
<p>and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time.</p>
<p>There are also cases where people have been</p>
<p>in constant light for some period of time,</p>
<p>but because people can close their eyes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually easier to do the experiment</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re in constant darkness</p>
<p>to address the question of what is the endogenous,</p>
<p>meaning the internal rhythm that we all have,</p>
<p>and it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not exactly 24 hours,</p>
<p>meaning every 24 hours,</p>
<p>your body temperature goes from low to high</p>
<p>and back down to low again,</p>
<p>and it takes 24 hours for that to repeat.</p>
<p>Not 18, not six, 24, plus or minus a couple hours.</p>
<p>You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness</p>
<p>that correlates with that.</p>
<p>We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling,</p>
<p>getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking</p>
<p>when our temperature is increasing.</p>
<p>This is a biological fact.</p>
<p>It is right down to our DNA.</p>
<p>We actually have genes in every single one of our cells</p>
<p>that ensure that every cell is on this 24-hour-ish rhythm,</p>
<p>close to 24 hours.</p>
<p>We have a clock over the roof of our mouth,</p>
<p>a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.</p>
<p>That clock generates a 24-hour rhythm,</p>
<p>and that clock is entrained,</p>
<p>meaning it is matched to the external light-dark cycle,</p>
<p>which is, no surprise, 24 hours.</p>
<p>Spinning the Earth takes 24 hours.</p>
<p>So our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature,</p>
<p>but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood,</p>
<p>all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>And if we are living our life in a perfect way</p>
<p>where we wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon,</p>
<p>and then by evening we catch a little sunlight,</p>
<p>and then at night we&rsquo;re in complete darkness,</p>
<p>we will be more or less perfectly matched</p>
<p>to the external or ambient light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>Very few of us do that</p>
<p>because of these things that we call artificial lights</p>
<p>and this other thing that we call life demands.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>when we get pulled away from that rhythm.</p>
<p>Now, you may immediately be thinking,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ve heard there are night owls</p>
<p>and there are morning larks, they&rsquo;re sometimes called,</p>
<p>and there are genetic polymorphisms,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a fancy name for genetic variations</p>
<p>that make some people want to wake up early</p>
<p>and other people want to stay up late</p>
<p>and teens want to sleep in more.</p>
<p>Sure, that&rsquo;s all true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all true regardless of what names we give those.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s no escaping the fact</p>
<p>that human beings are a diurnal species.</p>
<p>We were designed, literally,</p>
<p>our cells and the circuits of our body</p>
<p>were constructed to be awake during the daytime</p>
<p>and asleep at night.</p>
<p>How do I know that?</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m certain of that because many studies have shown</p>
<p>that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule</p>
<p>and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off,</p>
<p>but serious health effects,</p>
<p>both mental and physical, start to arise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to spend much of today</p>
<p>talking about all the negative effects of jet lag,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about it,</p>
<p>or the negative effects of shift work</p>
<p>or trying to scare you by telling you</p>
<p>about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia,</p>
<p>dementia, all the terrible things that happen</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not sleeping well.</p>
<p>Rather, I&rsquo;d like to focus on what you can do</p>
<p>and arm you with tools.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about that perfect schedule for a moment,</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s talk about jet lag</p>
<p>and what jet lag really represents</p>
<p>and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster,</p>
<p>and escape some of the severe bad things</p>
<p>that can happen with jet lag,</p>
<p>including just feeling miserable</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re traveling for work or vacation.</p>
<p>So what is the perfect day?</p>
<p>What does that look like</p>
<p>from a circadian sleep wakefulness standpoint?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m about to summarize what I&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>in the three previous podcast episodes,</p>
<p>as well as now countless Instagram posts.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight,</p>
<p>but as much light into your eyes</p>
<p>during the period of each 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert.</p>
<p>And you want to get as little light into your eyes</p>
<p>at the times of that 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep.</p>
<p>How much is enough?</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t want to go so high with the light exposure</p>
<p>that you damage your eyes</p>
<p>because as many of you heard me say before,</p>
<p>the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain,</p>
<p>your central nervous system</p>
<p>that were extruded out of your skull.</p>
<p>And as pieces of the central nervous system,</p>
<p>aka your brain, they will not regenerate.</p>
<p>At least right now, the technologies don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>to regenerate those neurons in humans.</p>
<p>You do not want to damage them.</p>
<p>So what is too bright?</p>
<p>Well, when it&rsquo;s painful to look at,</p>
<p>when you have to blink or close your eyes</p>
<p>in order to bear it.</p>
<p>So please don&rsquo;t look at very bright lights,</p>
<p>so painful that they&rsquo;re likely going to damage your eyes.</p>
<p>However, if you get up in the morning</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still dark out and you want to be awake,</p>
<p>you would be wise to turn on artificial lights,</p>
<p>in particular overhead lights</p>
<p>for reasons I&rsquo;ve discussed previously,</p>
<p>but those overhead lights will optimally trigger</p>
<p>the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina</p>
<p>that will activate your circadian clock.</p>
<p>When the sun comes out, even if there&rsquo;s cloud cover,</p>
<p>the sun does come out every day,</p>
<p>regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave.</p>
<p>People have said to me,</p>
<p>well, I live in an area where I can&rsquo;t really see the sun.</p>
<p>Well, the sun is there.</p>
<p>It might be hiding behind clouds</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s very, very dark where you live,</p>
<p>like Scandinavia in the depths of winter,</p>
<p>in which case you might want some artificial light.</p>
<p>Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal with sunlight and artificial light</p>
<p>that I have not discussed previously.</p>
<p>A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux,</p>
<p>LUX comes through even cloud cover.</p>
<p>A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb</p>
<p>is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux</p>
<p>before 9 a.m.</p>
<p>10 a.m. maybe, but before 9 a.m.,</p>
<p>assuming you&rsquo;re waking up sometime between 5 and 8 a.m.</p>
<p>Okay, so get 100,000 lux.</p>
<p>Now you do not, I want to repeat,</p>
<p>you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux</p>
<p>or a 100,000 lux light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very bright.</p>
<p>The mechanism of circadian clock setting,</p>
<p>and this is very important,</p>
<p>the mechanism of circadian clock setting</p>
<p>involves these neurons in your eye</p>
<p>that send electrical signals</p>
<p>to this clock above the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>and that system sums, meaning it adds photons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very slow system.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that I wake up</p>
<p>and I look at my computer screen briefly,</p>
<p>or my phone screen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably 500 to 1,000 lux.</p>
<p>If I were to look at that for a full minute,</p>
<p>I would get that photon energy</p>
<p>transferred into electrical energy of neurons,</p>
<p>and it would be communicated to my circadian clock.</p>
<p>However, the signal that it&rsquo;s morning</p>
<p>will not have registered with the circadian clock,</p>
<p>unless I looked at that for 100 minutes or more.</p>
<p>So 100,000.</p>
<p>Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to get enough light from artificial light</p>
<p>before you reach what&rsquo;s called the circadian dead zone.</p>
<p>So you have this opportunity before 9 a.m., maybe 10 a.m.,</p>
<p>to capture enough photons,</p>
<p>and you have to do it with your eyes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed why that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>in previous episodes of the podcast.</p>
<p>You have to do it with your eyes.</p>
<p>There is no extraocular photoreception.</p>
<p>This is not about vitamin D in your skin.</p>
<p>This is about setting your circadian clock,</p>
<p>which is paramount for mental and physical health.</p>
<p>So here we&rsquo;re talking about trying to get that</p>
<p>at least 100,000 photons, but not all at once,</p>
<p>but you got to get them before 9 a.m.-ish, maybe 10 a.m.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>You go outside.</p>
<p>If you want to get nerdy about this, quantitative,</p>
<p>you could download a free app like Light Meter</p>
<p>and take a look around your house with Light Meter,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll notice that even bright overhead lights</p>
<p>are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a long while of looking at those lights</p>
<p>with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock</p>
<p>and tell your brain and body that it&rsquo;s morning.</p>
<p>Going outside, even on a cloudy day,</p>
<p>could be 7,000, 10,000 lux.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really remarkable how bright it is,</p>
<p>meaning how much photon energy is coming through.</p>
<p>So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9 a.m.</p>
<p>Now, if you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>because you live in an area of the world</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just not bright enough,</p>
<p>some people have sent me pictures from Northern England,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not bright enough in winter,</p>
<p>then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights</p>
<p>in order to get enough photons.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target</p>
<p>to get each day before 9 a.m.</p>
<p>You can, in theory, get it all from artificial lights,</p>
<p>but there are some special qualities about sunlight</p>
<p>that make sunlight the better stimulus.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s free if it&rsquo;s available outside.</p>
<p>There is a number of different,</p>
<p>there are, excuse me, a number of different technologies,</p>
<p>kind of like this one, like a light pad,</p>
<p>that this one says it&rsquo;s 930 lux.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m covering this up</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not trying to promote any specific products.</p>
<p>I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a sponsor.</p>
<p>And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think,</p>
<p>by holding this on, holding down this button,</p>
<p>you can make it dimmer or brighter.</p>
<p>This is about 1,000 lux.</p>
<p>It seems really bright,</p>
<p>but a cloudy day outside</p>
<p>will have five times more photon energy coming through.</p>
<p>So some people set these lights or ring lights</p>
<p>that they use for selfies and that kind of thing</p>
<p>near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning,</p>
<p>but you really want to get sunlight, okay?</p>
<p>So those things are kind of nice because they&rsquo;ll travel,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about jet lag,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough.</p>
<p>That light has to be captured and summed</p>
<p>before you enter the circadian dead zone,</p>
<p>which is the middle of the day.</p>
<p>This is, again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ve recommended based on scientific literature</p>
<p>that you look at sunlight sometime</p>
<p>around the time when the sun is setting.</p>
<p>And the reason for that, of course,</p>
<p>is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s the diabolical thing.</p>
<p>While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day</p>
<p>to wake up our system and set our circadian clock</p>
<p>and prepare us for a good night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>14 to 16 hours later,</p>
<p>it takes very little photon energy</p>
<p>to reset and shift our clock after 8 p.m.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you want to, as much as you safely can,</p>
<p>avoid bright light and even not so bright light</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 or 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked me some questions about this.</p>
<p>And the last episode, I went into red lights.</p>
<p>I would discuss blue blockers, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to repeat all that, but here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>If you see afternoon light,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes</p>
<p>so that you have a little bit more wiggle room,</p>
<p>a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens</p>
<p>and overhead lights even late at night</p>
<p>without disrupting your circadian clock.</p>
<p>But it is a kind of a double-edged sword</p>
<p>where you need a lot of light early in the day</p>
<p>and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned studies on here.</p>
<p>A number of you have asked about getting the references.</p>
<p>We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going</p>
<p>with full links.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some copyright issues that we have to deal with,</p>
<p>but wherever possible, I&rsquo;ll try and reference these studies.</p>
<p>And when people ask, I&rsquo;ll generally put them</p>
<p>in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram.</p>
<p>There have been two studies done</p>
<p>from University of Colorado,</p>
<p>both published in Current Biology.</p>
<p>You can easily find these online</p>
<p>by just Googling the words Current Biology,</p>
<p>camping and reset circadian clocks</p>
<p>that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun</p>
<p>and avoiding light at night,</p>
<p>they actually took graduate students camping,</p>
<p>really cool experiment to be a part of,</p>
<p>reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms</p>
<p>for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far</p>
<p>from their natural rhythms.</p>
<p>There are other things that you can do to shift your clock</p>
<p>and to reinforce your clock,</p>
<p>like exercising more or less the same time,</p>
<p>eating more or less the same time, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what today&rsquo;s episode is about.</p>
<p>So I just described perfect schedule,</p>
<p>get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes,</p>
<p>not all at once, but summing across the morning.</p>
<p>Again, you know when it&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s painful to look at.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s obviously something to avoid.</p>
<p>But then once the middle of the day,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re waking up at 10 or 11,</p>
<p>you go outside, the sun&rsquo;s overhead, forget it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to shift your clock.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>In the evening, you see the evening light</p>
<p>and you want to get that light</p>
<p>to adjust down your retinal sensitivity</p>
<p>to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night,</p>
<p>if you happen to look at screens</p>
<p>or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to shift your clock</p>
<p>because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1,500 lux</p>
<p>of light energy to shift your clock</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about shifting clocks</p>
<p>because for the jet lag person,</p>
<p>this ability to shift the clock</p>
<p>with light temperature exercise and food</p>
<p>is vitally important for getting</p>
<p>onto the new local schedule.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much out there about jet lag today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to dial it down to one very specific parameter</p>
<p>that all of you can figure out</p>
<p>without any technology or devices</p>
<p>and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure</p>
<p>or anytime you&rsquo;re jet lagged.</p>
<p>And I want to absolutely emphasize</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to travel to get jet lagged.</p>
<p>Many of you are jet lagged.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re jet lagged because you&rsquo;re looking at your phone</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re jet lagged because you&rsquo;re waking up</p>
<p>at different times a day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re jet lagged because your exercise</p>
<p>is on a chaotic regime some days at this time,</p>
<p>some days at that time.</p>
<p>And if that works for you, great.</p>
<p>I want to be really clear that a number of people</p>
<p>always say, well, I know so-and-so</p>
<p>that only needed four hours of sleep</p>
<p>and or they&rsquo;re just fine.</p>
<p>They traveled to Europe and it&rsquo;s just fine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of individual variability.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about the origins</p>
<p>of some of that variability.</p>
<p>I mean, I know people that can eat anything</p>
<p>and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles</p>
<p>and body weight and fitness ability.</p>
<p>And I know some people that they eat one cracker</p>
<p>and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears</p>
<p>because they think that that&rsquo;s going to throw them off.</p>
<p>And then maybe it does, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of variability out there.</p>
<p>So this is really about optimal and what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience</p>
<p>I suffer terribly from jet lag traveling</p>
<p>in certain directions, but not others.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t have trouble with jet lag.</p>
<p>Many people will travel to a new location.</p>
<p>They feel great for the first day and night</p>
<p>and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping</p>
<p>or they travel back and they have a terrible time</p>
<p>getting back onto a normal schedule.</p>
<p>And some of this varies with age</p>
<p>and some of it varies with genetics.</p>
<p>And there is no simple pill or anything</p>
<p>that you can take to just get rid of jet lag.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>If it worked that way, I would tell you.</p>
<p>But there are some simple things that you can do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is</p>
<p>and how it works.</p>
<p>And contrary to what many people out there say and believe</p>
<p>I know that understanding mechanism</p>
<p>affords you more flexibility.</p>
<p>Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me</p>
<p>just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do?</p>
<p>Well, what happens when you can&rsquo;t do those things</p>
<p>in exactly the way they&rsquo;re written down?</p>
<p>When you understand mechanism,</p>
<p>you understand how to control the machine</p>
<p>that is your biological system, your nervous system.</p>
<p>So a little bit of understanding about mechanism</p>
<p>goes a really long way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what jet lag is.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I promised that I wouldn&rsquo;t get too dark</p>
<p>with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m about to get dark.</p>
<p>There are quality peer-reviewed papers</p>
<p>showing that jet lag will shorten your life.</p>
<p>It will kill you earlier.</p>
<p>I guess it means you&rsquo;ll die earlier.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually kill you necessarily.</p>
<p>Although there are many cases where tourists</p>
<p>end up stepping in front of buses,</p>
<p>especially in countries where the cars and buses</p>
<p>drive on the opposite side of the street</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re used to,</p>
<p>who are jet lagged and lose their life that way.</p>
<p>Jet lag is a serious thing.</p>
<p>Should we have a family story about this?</p>
<p>When I was growing up,</p>
<p>I had a family member travel overseas for work</p>
<p>and take a sleeping pill.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t name the sleeping pill,</p>
<p>though at the end I&rsquo;m going to talk about sleeping pills</p>
<p>and had a case of total amnesia for a week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely uncommon.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even have to be in the middle of the day,</p>
<p>woken up, you might not know where you are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because time and space are really linked</p>
<p>and the brain wasn&rsquo;t designed to be transported</p>
<p>four, five, six hours into a new time zone.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Our brain and the biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that govern circadian timing</p>
<p>were designed to be shifted by a couple hours,</p>
<p>not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours.</p>
<p>So you can really mess yourself up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that experience.</p>
<p>I usually experienced it as fluctuations in mood.</p>
<p>I flew 12 hours out of phase to Abu Dhabi once</p>
<p>to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess.</p>
<p>I actually was getting vertigo.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t hallucinating, but I was really out of it.</p>
<p>And my mood was just all over the place.</p>
<p>It was very bizarre.</p>
<p>Jet lag, even if you don&rsquo;t experience it</p>
<p>as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Traveling westward on the globe is always easier</p>
<p>than traveling eastward, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because the effects of jet lag</p>
<p>on longevity have shown that traveling east</p>
<p>takes more years off your life than traveling west.</p>
<p>Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone</p>
<p>or three hours, just one time zone over,</p>
<p>or two time zones over, rather,</p>
<p>is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology</p>
<p>than a eight-hour shift or a nine-hour shift.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity,</p>
<p>or this idea that it can shorten our lives,</p>
<p>we have to ask ourselves, why?</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>And it turns out there&rsquo;s a pretty simple explanation</p>
<p>for this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked before about the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain</p>
<p>that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.</p>
<p>It turns out that human beings, and probably most species,</p>
<p>are better able to activate and stay alert</p>
<p>than they are to shut down their nervous system</p>
<p>and go to sleep on demand.</p>
<p>So if you really have to push</p>
<p>and you really have to stay awake, you can do it.</p>
<p>You can stay up later.</p>
<p>But falling asleep earlier is harder.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why traveling east</p>
<p>has a number of different features associated with it</p>
<p>that because you&rsquo;re traveling east,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to go to bed earlier.</p>
<p>You know, as a Californian, if I go to New York City,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to get to bed three hours early</p>
<p>and wake up three hours earlier.</p>
<p>Much harder than coming back to California</p>
<p>and just staying up a few more hours.</p>
<p>And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation</p>
<p>where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up</p>
<p>and go or forge for food or fight</p>
<p>or do any number of different things</p>
<p>that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline</p>
<p>and epinephrine to stay awake.</p>
<p>Whereas being able to slow down</p>
<p>and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag.</p>
<p>So if you want to read up on this,</p>
<p>because people have asked me about papers,</p>
<p>you can look, there&rsquo;s a paper published by Davidson</p>
<p>and colleagues 2006 in Current Biology</p>
<p>that talks about the differences in lifespan</p>
<p>for frequent eastward versus westward versus no travel</p>
<p>and longevity and et cetera.</p>
<p>A number of different biological markers of longevity.</p>
<p>So going east is harder</p>
<p>because going to sleep earlier is harder</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to do that on demand.</p>
<p>Many people have turned to melatonin</p>
<p>as a way to try and induce sleepiness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about melatonin at the end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned on previous podcasts,</p>
<p>a number of you have asked for the evidence</p>
<p>that melatonin is potentially detrimental</p>
<p>to some hormone systems.</p>
<p>Melatonin is a hormone and I&rsquo;ll discuss that at the end,</p>
<p>in particular, the role of melatonin</p>
<p>in suppressing a hormone pathway</p>
<p>that involves luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>testosterone in men and estrogen in females,</p>
<p>as well as a really interesting peptide</p>
<p>called kisspeptin, that&rsquo;s a cool name.</p>
<p>All right, well, let&rsquo;s think about travel and what happens.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re not going eastward or westward,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going north or south.</p>
<p>So if you go from, for instance, Washington DC</p>
<p>to Santiago, Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel</p>
<p>to Cape Town, South Africa,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going north and south, right?</p>
<p>And not, you know, either direction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not really moving into a different time zone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not shifting.</p>
<p>So you will experience travel fatigue.</p>
<p>And it turns out that jet lag has two elements,</p>
<p>travel fatigue and time zone jet lag.</p>
<p>Time zone jet lag is simply the inability</p>
<p>of local sunlight and local darkness</p>
<p>to match to your internal rhythm,</p>
<p>this endogenous rhythm that you have.</p>
<p>So before we get too complicated</p>
<p>and too down in the weeds about this,</p>
<p>I want to just throw out a couple important things.</p>
<p>First of all, I mentioned this earlier,</p>
<p>but some people suffer from jet lag a lot,</p>
<p>other people, not so much.</p>
<p>Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older.</p>
<p>There are reasons for that,</p>
<p>because early in life, patterns of melatonin release</p>
<p>are very stable and flat and very high,</p>
<p>actually, in children.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons why they don&rsquo;t undergo puberty.</p>
<p>Then it becomes cyclic during puberty,</p>
<p>meaning it comes on once every 24 hours</p>
<p>and turns off once every 24 hours.</p>
<p>It cycles, cyclic.</p>
<p>And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted</p>
<p>and we become more vulnerable</p>
<p>to even small changes in schedule, et cetera,</p>
<p>meal times, right?</p>
<p>So jet lag gets worse as we age.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other things that happen with age</p>
<p>that people start doing less exercise,</p>
<p>their digestion can get worse, et cetera.</p>
<p>So some of the effects of age</p>
<p>might not be direct effects of getting older,</p>
<p>but some of the things that are correlated with being older,</p>
<p>like people who are willing to have</p>
<p>a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime</p>
<p>to shift their circadian clock.</p>
<p>And I have a good friend, his father&rsquo;s in his 80s.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still pushing out 25, 30 pushups each morning.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on the Peloton or whatever it is,</p>
<p>doing a lot of cycling.</p>
<p>So some 80-year-olds are doing that, many are not.</p>
<p>Many 30-year-olds are not.</p>
<p>But if you have a regular exercise program,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to make it easier</p>
<p>to shift your circadian clock for sake of jet lag.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually a knob you can turn</p>
<p>and you can leverage for shifting your clock.</p>
<p>Before we go any further,</p>
<p>I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy,</p>
<p>or at least as easy and as simple</p>
<p>as one could possibly make it, I believe.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about is perhaps</p>
<p>one of the most important things to know</p>
<p>about your body and brain,</p>
<p>which is called your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>Most of you know your approximate weight.</p>
<p>Some of you even know your blood pressure.</p>
<p>Some of you might even know your body mass index.</p>
<p>Some of you might know other things about your biology</p>
<p>that have fancy names,</p>
<p>but everyone should know their temperature minimum.</p>
<p>Your temperature minimum doesn&rsquo;t require</p>
<p>a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it.</p>
<p>Your temperature minimum is the point</p>
<p>in every 24-hour cycle when your temperature is lowest.</p>
<p>Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer?</p>
<p>It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours</p>
<p>before your average waking time.</p>
<p>So I want to repeat that.</p>
<p>Your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes</p>
<p>to two hours before your average waking time.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re not traveling</p>
<p>and your typical wake-up time is 5.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Your temperature minimum is very likely 3.30 a.m. or 4.00 a.m.</p>
<p>If you want, if any of you want to,</p>
<p>you can measure your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>You can get a thermometer</p>
<p>and you can measure your temperature</p>
<p>every couple hours for 24 hours.</p>
<p>You can find your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re going to find is that you have a low point,</p>
<p>the temperature minimum,</p>
<p>and then your temperature will start to rise.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll wake up about two hours later.</p>
<p>Then your temperature will continue to rise</p>
<p>into the afternoon.</p>
<p>It will peak, maybe a little trough.</p>
<p>Sometimes that happens.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;ll start declining slowly</p>
<p>as you approach nighttime.</p>
<p>There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern.</p>
<p>Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, et cetera.</p>
<p>Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect</p>
<p>that increases temperature slightly, little blips,</p>
<p>but the overall cycle, 24-hour cycle of temperature</p>
<p>has this pattern.</p>
<p>And last time I talked about the seminal work</p>
<p>of Joe Takahashi and others who have shown</p>
<p>that temperature actually is the signal</p>
<p>by which this clock above the roof of your mouth</p>
<p>entrains or collectively pushes all the cells</p>
<p>and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule.</p>
<p>Temperature is the effector.</p>
<p>And once you hear that,</p>
<p>there should be an immediate, oh, of course,</p>
<p>because how else would you get</p>
<p>all these different diverse cell types</p>
<p>to follow one pattern, right?</p>
<p>A pancreatic cell does something very different</p>
<p>than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all doing different things at different rates.</p>
<p>So the temperature signal can go out</p>
<p>and then each one of those can interpret</p>
<p>the temperature signal as one unified</p>
<p>and consistent theme of their environment.</p>
<p>So temperatures vary from person to person.</p>
<p>Some people are 98.6,</p>
<p>some people run a little colder, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you have a low point and you have a high point.</p>
<p>Know your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum?</p>
<p>The temperature minimum can be determined</p>
<p>by taking the last three to five wake up times.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you wake up 7 a.m., 8 a.m., 3 a.m.,</p>
<p>right, happens, take those, add them together,</p>
<p>average them by adding them up</p>
<p>and dividing by the number of days,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll give you the average.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of these people that wakes up at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>and then goes back to sleep and sleeps till 10,</p>
<p>your wake up time was 10 a.m.</p>
<p>If you use an alarm clock,</p>
<p>your wake up time is still when you get up, okay?</p>
<p>I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized,</p>
<p>but in my world, being late and missing appointments</p>
<p>is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock.</p>
<p>Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day.</p>
<p>There tends to be some variation for people.</p>
<p>Some people, it&rsquo;s going to vary</p>
<p>depending on life circumstances,</p>
<p>but average that for three to seven days or so.</p>
<p>Take that wake up time.</p>
<p>You can then get an average</p>
<p>or sort of typical temperature minimum.</p>
<p>Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point</p>
<p>for shifting your circadian clock.</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s for jet lag or shift work</p>
<p>or some other purpose.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>If you expose your eyes to bright light</p>
<p>in the four hours, maybe five or six,</p>
<p>but in the four hours after your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>your circadian clock will shift</p>
<p>so that you will tend to get up earlier</p>
<p>and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a phase advance,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to read up on this further.</p>
<p>You advance your clock, okay?</p>
<p>However, if you view bright light</p>
<p>in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>you will tend to phase delay your clock.</p>
<p>You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m going to repeat this</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much confusion out there</p>
<p>and people talk about circadian time and all this.</p>
<p>Find your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>I tend to wake up at about 6 a.m.,</p>
<p>sometimes 6.30, sometimes 7.</p>
<p>It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m guessing it does for you.</p>
<p>But that means that my temperature minimum</p>
<p>is probably somewhere right around 4.30 a.m.,</p>
<p>which means that if I wake up at 4.30 a.m.</p>
<p>and I were to view bright light at 4.35 a.m.,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to advance my clock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night</p>
<p>and wake up earlier the subsequent morning.</p>
<p>And as I shift my wake-up time,</p>
<p>my temperature minimum shifts too, right?</p>
<p>Because each time we shift our wake-up time,</p>
<p>our temperature minimum shifts,</p>
<p>assuming that wake-up time shifts more than 30 minutes</p>
<p>or an hour, okay?</p>
<p>If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours</p>
<p>before 4.30 a.m., guess what?</p>
<p>The next night I&rsquo;m going to want to stay up later</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to want to wake up later</p>
<p>the subsequent morning.</p>
<p>Your temperature minimum is a reference point,</p>
<p>not a temperature reading.</p>
<p>Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum</p>
<p>and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever,</p>
<p>or 96 point whatever, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You can do that, but that information won&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p>What you need to know is what time</p>
<p>your body temperature is lowest</p>
<p>and understand that in the four hours or so</p>
<p>just after that time,</p>
<p>viewing light will advance your clock</p>
<p>to make you want to get up earlier.</p>
<p>And the four hours before your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>viewing light will make you want to stay up later.</p>
<p>Now, some people might be saying,</p>
<p>well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sleepy all day and I&rsquo;m a mess, or I feel fine.</p>
<p>Look, let&rsquo;s talk about feeling fine.</p>
<p>It turns out the definition of insomnia</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re experiencing excessive sleepiness</p>
<p>during the day.</p>
<p>Sleepiness and fatigue are different, okay?</p>
<p>So in the world of sleep medicine,</p>
<p>fatigue is a physical exhaustion.</p>
<p>Sleepiness is falling asleep,</p>
<p>like falling asleep at your desk</p>
<p>or falling asleep during lectures,</p>
<p>or there seems to be something special about my lectures</p>
<p>that makes people want to fall asleep.</p>
<p>So if this cures your insomnia, fantastic.</p>
<p>However, in all seriousness,</p>
<p>sleepiness during the daytime,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s around your temperature peak</p>
<p>and only lasts about 90 minutes or so,</p>
<p>is a sign of insomnia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign of lack of sleep.</p>
<p>So I want to be very, very clear</p>
<p>that if you know your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>you can shift your clock using light.</p>
<p>You can also shift your clock</p>
<p>by engaging in exercise in the four hours</p>
<p>after your temperature minimum</p>
<p>to wake up earlier on subsequent nights</p>
<p>or exercise before then to delay your clock, okay?</p>
<p>So now you can start to see and understand</p>
<p>the logic of this system.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about why this works</p>
<p>and the underlying biology,</p>
<p>but understanding that temperature is the effector</p>
<p>and understanding that you have this low point</p>
<p>and that reflects your most sleepy point,</p>
<p>essentially, right before waking up,</p>
<p>and then temperature rises,</p>
<p>you can now start to shift that temperature</p>
<p>according to your travel needs.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one way in which you might do that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I am going to travel to Europe,</p>
<p>which is nine hours ahead, typically, from California.</p>
<p>I would want to determine my temperature minimum,</p>
<p>which for me is about 4.30 a.m., maybe 5 a.m.,</p>
<p>and I would want to start getting up at about 5.30 a.m.</p>
<p>and getting some bright light exposure,</p>
<p>presumably from artificial sources,</p>
<p>because the sunlight isn&rsquo;t going to be out at that time,</p>
<p>maybe even exercising as well,</p>
<p>maybe even eating a meal at that time</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s in your practice.</p>
<p>You would want to start doing that</p>
<p>two or three days before travel,</p>
<p>because once you land in, or I land in Europe,</p>
<p>chances are just viewing the sunrise or sunset in Europe</p>
<p>is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock.</p>
<p>Some people say, get sunlight in your eyes when you land,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not going to work,</p>
<p>because one of two things is likely to happen.</p>
<p>With a nine-hour shift like that,</p>
<p>either I&rsquo;m going to view sunlight</p>
<p>at a time that corresponds to the circadian dead zone,</p>
<p>the time in which my circadian clock can&rsquo;t be shifted,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to end up viewing sunlight</p>
<p>at a time that corresponds to the four- to six-hour window</p>
<p>before my temperature minimum.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to shift me</p>
<p>in exactly the opposite direction that I want to go.</p>
<p>So it can be very, very challenging</p>
<p>for people to adjust to jet lag.</p>
<p>So you need to ask, am I traveling east</p>
<p>or am I traveling west?</p>
<p>Am I trying to advance my clock or delay my clock?</p>
<p>Remember, viewing light, exercise, and eating</p>
<p>in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum</p>
<p>will delay your clock.</p>
<p>Eating, viewing sunlight, and exercising,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to do all three,</p>
<p>but some combination of those in the four to six hours</p>
<p>after your temperature minimum will advance your clock.</p>
<p>And this is a powerful mechanism</p>
<p>by which you can shift your clock anywhere</p>
<p>from one to three hours per day, which is remarkable.</p>
<p>That means your temperature minimum</p>
<p>is going to shift out as much as three hours,</p>
<p>which can make it such that you can travel</p>
<p>all the way to Europe.</p>
<p>And as long as you&rsquo;ve prepared for a day or so</p>
<p>by doing what I described back home,</p>
<p>and then doing it when you arrive,</p>
<p>you can potentially accomplish the entire shift</p>
<p>within anywhere from 24 to 36 hours.</p>
<p>And this is really important to emphasize</p>
<p>that once you arrive in your new location,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m talking about traveling eastward California</p>
<p>to Europe, once you arrive in your new location,</p>
<p>you have to keep track</p>
<p>of what your temperature minimum was back home</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s being shifted during your trip.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s much easier to do than you think.</p>
<p>One of the unfortunate consequences of the smartphone</p>
<p>is that you can&rsquo;t do something goofy</p>
<p>like wearing two watches,</p>
<p>one watch that corresponds to the time back home</p>
<p>and another one that corresponds to the local time.</p>
<p>Typically it updates automatically based on Wi-Fi, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if you can keep track of the time back home,</p>
<p>then you can easily shift your clock going forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping this would make sense.</p>
<p>I really want to emphasize</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to be precise down to the minute.</p>
<p>Some of you may be asking,</p>
<p>well, what about you&rsquo;ve got this temperature minimum</p>
<p>and if I view light one minute before it,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m going to delay my clock</p>
<p>and one minute after it, I&rsquo;m going to advance my clock.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t quite work like that, okay?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>that light is the primary way</p>
<p>in which we can shift our clock.</p>
<p>And now you should also be able to understand things</p>
<p>like the circadian dead zone from about 9.30, 10 a.m.</p>
<p>all the way until six hours before your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to shift your clock.</p>
<p>Nothing that you do in that time</p>
<p>in terms of light viewing behavior, feeding, et cetera,</p>
<p>is going to shift your clock.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people are landing in Europe,</p>
<p>getting sunlight in their eyes</p>
<p>and throwing their clock out of whack</p>
<p>or not shifting their clock at all.</p>
<p>This brings me to the other thing that&rsquo;s highly recommended.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before,</p>
<p>but you want to eat on the local meal schedule.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in your practice to fast, fast, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But when you eat,</p>
<p>you want to eat within the local schedule for alertness.</p>
<p>Okay, that means if you arrive</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s eating breakfast</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t stomach the idea of breakfast</p>
<p>in your new location because your appetite isn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>that means the clock in your liver,</p>
<p>you have a clock in your liver,</p>
<p>biological clock has not caught up to the new time zone.</p>
<p>You can force yourself to eat if you like,</p>
<p>or you can skip that meal.</p>
<p>But what you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>is stay on your home meal schedule,</p>
<p>waking up in the middle of the night and eating.</p>
<p>That is really going to throw things off</p>
<p>because a lot of the clocks in the periphery,</p>
<p>like from the liver, the peripheral body,</p>
<p>will send information back to the brain.</p>
<p>And then the brain is getting really conflicted signals.</p>
<p>So the temperature minimum is really your anchor point</p>
<p>for shifting your clock best.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this information</p>
<p>really hasn&rsquo;t made it into the popular sphere quite so much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of stuff</p>
<p>about taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats,</p>
<p>a lot of kind of like more sophisticated, complicated,</p>
<p>and potentially problematic ways</p>
<p>of trying to shift the clock.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about melatonin.</p>
<p>But first I just want to pause</p>
<p>and shift gears a little bit</p>
<p>because I talked about traveling eastward,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t talked about traveling westward.</p>
<p>So I want to do that now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re traveling from New York to California</p>
<p>or from Europe to California.</p>
<p>The challenge there tends to be</p>
<p>how can you stay up late enough?</p>
<p>Now, some people are able to do this</p>
<p>because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the autonomic nervous system is asymmetrically wired</p>
<p>such that it&rsquo;s easier to stay up late later</p>
<p>than we would naturally want to</p>
<p>than it is to go to sleep earlier.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you land and it&rsquo;s 4 p.m.</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just dying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in California, you came from Europe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 4 p.m. and you really, really want to go to sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the use of things like caffeine, exercise,</p>
<p>and sunlight can shift you, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s after your temperature peak,</p>
<p>then viewing sunlight around 6 p.m. or 8 p.m.</p>
<p>or artificial light, if there isn&rsquo;t sunlight,</p>
<p>will help shift you later, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to delay your clock</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to be able to stay up later.</p>
<p>The worst thing you can do is take a nap</p>
<p>that was intended to last 20 minutes or an hour.</p>
<p>I do this routinely and then wake up four hours later</p>
<p>or you wake up and it&rsquo;s midnight</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t fall back asleep.</p>
<p>You really want to avoid doing that.</p>
<p>So provided it&rsquo;s not excessive amounts,</p>
<p>stimulants like caffeine and coffee or tea</p>
<p>can really help you push past that afternoon barrier</p>
<p>and get you to sleep more like on the local schedule</p>
<p>and eating on the local schedule as well.</p>
<p>A number of people have asked about the use of melatonin</p>
<p>to induce sleepiness.</p>
<p>All right, well, let&rsquo;s think about what melatonin is.</p>
<p>Melatonin is this hormone that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>from the pineal gland, which is this gland.</p>
<p>A couple notes about the pineal,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of questions about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to draw some fire for this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be happy to have a thoughtful, considerate debate</p>
<p>with some peer-reviewed papers in front of us.</p>
<p>The pineal does make this hallucinogenic molecule</p>
<p>they call DMT, but in such minuscule amounts</p>
<p>that it is not responsible for the hallucinations</p>
<p>you see in sleep and dreaming.</p>
<p>Sorry, folks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not responsible for the hallucinations</p>
<p>you might see through other approaches to DMT.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not, that&rsquo;s not where the DMT comes from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s infinitesimally small amounts.</p>
<p>There are a lot of kind of wacky claims out there</p>
<p>about calcification of the pineal and fluoride</p>
<p>and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Look, the pineal sits in an area of the brain</p>
<p>near the fourth ventricle</p>
<p>where the skull is not terribly far away,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s some overlying neural tissue.</p>
<p>And with age, there&rsquo;s some aggregation</p>
<p>of some of the meninges and other things around there</p>
<p>that stick to the skull.</p>
<p>Young brains don&rsquo;t look like old brains,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no calcification of the pineal, all right?</p>
<p>So you can forget about calcification</p>
<p>of the pineal as a problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where that whole thing got started,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not an issue.</p>
<p>Your pineal will churn out melatonin your whole life.</p>
<p>Melatonin induces sleepiness.</p>
<p>Melatonin during development is also responsible</p>
<p>for timing the secretion of certain hormones</p>
<p>that are vitally important for puberty.</p>
<p>Does melatonin control the onset of puberty?</p>
<p>Not directly, but indirectly.</p>
<p>Melatonin inhibits something</p>
<p>called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,</p>
<p>which is a hormone that&rsquo;s released from your hypothalamus,</p>
<p>also roughly above the roof of your mouth and your brain.</p>
<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is really interesting</p>
<p>because it stimulates the release of another hormone</p>
<p>called luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>which in females causes estrogen</p>
<p>to be released within the ovaries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in reproductive cycles,</p>
<p>and in males, stimulates testosterone</p>
<p>from the sertoli cells of the testes.</p>
<p>Melatonin is inhibitory to GNRH,</p>
<p>gonadotropin-releasing hormone,</p>
<p>and therefore is inhibitory to LH, luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>and therefore is inhibitory to testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no two ways about it.</p>
<p>There is immense amount of data on the fact</p>
<p>that high levels of melatonin in seasonally breeding animals</p>
<p>takes the ovaries from nice and robust ovaries</p>
<p>that are capable of deploying eggs and this kind of thing,</p>
<p>and literally shrinking them</p>
<p>and making these animals infertile.</p>
<p>These are very high levels of melatonin</p>
<p>in seasonal breeders in winter.</p>
<p>Melatonin in males of seasonal breeders</p>
<p>takes the testes and shrinks them.</p>
<p>Long ago, when I was at UC Berkeley as a master student,</p>
<p>I was working on neuroendocrinology,</p>
<p>and we were working on this hamster species</p>
<p>of seasonal breeders,</p>
<p>and basically when days are long, which inhibits melatonin,</p>
<p>these little Siberian hamsters, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>have testes about the size of sort of typical table grapes,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a weird way to put it.</p>
<p>When days get shorter and the melatonin signal gets longer,</p>
<p>because light inhibits melatonin,</p>
<p>days get shorter, melatonin gets longer,</p>
<p>those same hamsters would have testes</p>
<p>that would involute to the size of about a grain of rice.</p>
<p>Now, this does not happen in humans in short days,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, the melatonin signal</p>
<p>really does have a ton of effects on the hormone system.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean that if you&rsquo;ve been taking melatonin,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve really screwed up your hormones?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Does it mean if a kid has been taking melatonin,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really screwing up their puberty?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Melatonin operates on a concentration level,</p>
<p>so in a child that&rsquo;s very, very small,</p>
<p>that has high levels of melatonin,</p>
<p>it actually can inhibit GNRH, LH, testosterone, or estrogen,</p>
<p>depending on the sex of the child,</p>
<p>but as that child grows through other mechanisms,</p>
<p>like growth hormone release, et cetera,</p>
<p>that same amount of melatonin released from the pineal</p>
<p>is now diluted over a much larger body,</p>
<p>so the concentration actually goes way, way down, okay?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem with supplementing melatonin.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the previous episode,</p>
<p>concentrations of melatonin in many commercial supplements</p>
<p>have been shown to be anywhere from 85% to 400%</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s listed on the bottle,</p>
<p>so when you take melatonin, or a child takes melatonin,</p>
<p>oftentimes they are taking</p>
<p>supraphysiological levels of melatonin,</p>
<p>which, at least by my read and the literature,</p>
<p>says that it could have dramatic effects</p>
<p>on timing and course of things like puberty.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not so much that the journals have come out saying,</p>
<p>oh, taking that melatonin inhibits puberty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that no single study has been done</p>
<p>with the supraphysiological levels of melatonin</p>
<p>that are present in a lot of these supplements</p>
<p>in developing children.</p>
<p>So melatonin is used widely for inducing sleepiness</p>
<p>when you want to fall asleep</p>
<p>in the new location that you&rsquo;ve arrived, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fall asleep,</p>
<p>you take melatonin, it helps you fall asleep.</p>
<p>It does not help you stay asleep.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>melatonin has been kind of touted</p>
<p>as the best way to shift your circadian clock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to go on record saying,</p>
<p>look, if you need melatonin and you can work with a doctor</p>
<p>or somebody who really understands circadian</p>
<p>and sleep biology, go for it if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>but I, as always on this podcast and elsewhere,</p>
<p>I have a bias toward behavioral things</p>
<p>that you can titrate and control,</p>
<p>like exposure to light, exercise, temperature, et cetera,</p>
<p>that have much bigger margins for safety</p>
<p>and certainly don&rsquo;t have these other endocrine effects</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been thinking about and talking about.</p>
<p>So if you want to take melatonin in the afternoon</p>
<p>in order to fall asleep or in the evening,</p>
<p>be my guest, that&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re responsible for your health, not me.</p>
<p>But for many people,</p>
<p>melatonin is not going to be the best solution.</p>
<p>The best solution is going to be to use light</p>
<p>and temperature and exercise</p>
<p>on either side of the temperature minimum</p>
<p>to shift your clock both before your trip</p>
<p>and when you land in your new location</p>
<p>and your clock starts to shift.</p>
<p>Okay, so now you know my opinions about melatonin.</p>
<p>Feel free to filter them through your own opinions</p>
<p>and experiences with melatonin.</p>
<p>And now you also understand what your temperature minimum is</p>
<p>and how it represents an important landmark,</p>
<p>either side of which you can use light temperature</p>
<p>and exercise to shift your clock.</p>
<p>Just to remind you a little bit about temperature,</p>
<p>if you want to shift your clock,</p>
<p>typically you would do that by,</p>
<p>you could take a hot shower</p>
<p>and then that will have a cooling effect</p>
<p>after the hot shower.</p>
<p>And if you were to get into a cold shower or an ice bath,</p>
<p>if you have access to one,</p>
<p>afterward there&rsquo;s going to be a thermogenic effect</p>
<p>of your body increasing temperature.</p>
<p>And if you just think about your natural rhythm back home</p>
<p>when everything&rsquo;s stable,</p>
<p>you have a nadir, a low point in,</p>
<p>which is your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>and then you have a peak.</p>
<p>And you think about when you&rsquo;re doing this hot</p>
<p>or cold shower in that rhythm,</p>
<p>now you should be able to understand</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re shifting your rhythm.</p>
<p>That temperature rhythm is the one that&rsquo;s going to move.</p>
<p>Give you an example.</p>
<p>If I were to wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say I wake up at 6 a.m.,</p>
<p>my temperature I know is rising,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve passed my temperature minimum.</p>
<p>If I were to get into a hot shower</p>
<p>that would then lower my body temperature when I got out,</p>
<p>that is not normally what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>And therefore my clock would very likely get phase delayed.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s going to delay the increase in temperature.</p>
<p>Whereas if I got into a cold shower,</p>
<p>something I don&rsquo;t personally like to do,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve done from time to time or an ice bath,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to then have a rebound increase</p>
<p>in body temperature and is going to phase advance my clock.</p>
<p>That peak in the afternoon</p>
<p>is going to come about an hour earlier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to want to go to bed earlier, later that night.</p>
<p>So you can start to play these games</p>
<p>with timing and hot and cold,</p>
<p>with meals, whether or not you eat or you don&rsquo;t eat,</p>
<p>and with light exposure,</p>
<p>whether or not you view light or you don&rsquo;t view light.</p>
<p>So now you can start to see why understanding</p>
<p>the core mechanics of a system</p>
<p>can really give you the most flexibility</p>
<p>because I could spend the next 25 years of my life</p>
<p>answering every question</p>
<p>about every nuanced pattern of travel.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re going to Sydney, then we&rsquo;re going there.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s on you.</p>
<p>You need to figure out your temperature minimum</p>
<p>and your temperature peak, if you like,</p>
<p>and then use these parameters to, it gives you flexibility.</p>
<p>And that really underscores the most important thing</p>
<p>is that when you understand mechanism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about being neurotically attached</p>
<p>to a specific protocol, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>It gives you power to not be neurotically attached</p>
<p>to a specific protocol.</p>
<p>It can give you great confidence and flexibility</p>
<p>in being able to shift your body rhythms</p>
<p>however you want, and when things get out of whack,</p>
<p>you can tuck them right back into place.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s common is that people</p>
<p>need to do a quick trip.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always that you&rsquo;re going to go to,</p>
<p>you know, on vacation for two weeks or, you know,</p>
<p>work someplace else for weeks on end.</p>
<p>If your trip is 48 hours or less,</p>
<p>stay on your home schedule.</p>
<p>This can be tough and it may require scheduling meetings</p>
<p>according to your home schedule.</p>
<p>But if you can somehow manage that,</p>
<p>the best thing to do would be to stay on your home schedule.</p>
<p>Your clock is not going to shift more than a couple hours,</p>
<p>even if you do everything correctly in one day, okay?</p>
<p>So if I were to travel, say, to Europe,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually done this.</p>
<p>I did a 24-hour trip to Basel, Switzerland,</p>
<p>gave a talk and came back.</p>
<p>People thought I was crazy,</p>
<p>but I had a little bit of travel fatigue</p>
<p>because remember there&rsquo;s fatigue</p>
<p>from the actual travel experience.</p>
<p>The novelty of it, the air is never great on the planes.</p>
<p>This was even true before there were mask requirements</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the travel fatigue,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t throw your clock off.</p>
<p>If you stay 48 hours,</p>
<p>then you start to shift a little bit.</p>
<p>72, that&rsquo;s when you start running into trouble.</p>
<p>The transit time is also important,</p>
<p>but I would say if it&rsquo;s three days or less,</p>
<p>stay on your home schedule as much as you can.</p>
<p>And because sunlight isn&rsquo;t under your control,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s something about you I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when traveling with some sort of bright light,</p>
<p>like the light pad that I have down there</p>
<p>that I showed earlier.</p>
<p>For those of you listening just on audio,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it looks like an 8 1‚ÅÑ2 by 11 pad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not designed for wake up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually designed, it&rsquo;s a drawing pad,</p>
<p>and you can, and it emits about 1,000 lux of light.</p>
<p>And so if you want to travel with something like that,</p>
<p>you can use that in your hotel room</p>
<p>to wake up when you like.</p>
<p>Some people will use nightshades,</p>
<p>you know, not the nightshades that you eat</p>
<p>or that some people say you&rsquo;re not supposed to eat,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about that,</p>
<p>but the eye covers to keep light out.</p>
<p>Those can be very useful on planes and in hotels and so on.</p>
<p>So you can use light and dark,</p>
<p>and you can travel with your light and dark devices</p>
<p>so that you can stay on your home schedule</p>
<p>and get most of your light</p>
<p>when it would be your normal wake up time back home.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s kind of nice is if you know</p>
<p>when your circadian dead zone is back home,</p>
<p>which is generally for most people</p>
<p>around 10 a.m. to about 3 p.m.,</p>
<p>so basically the rising phase of your temperature,</p>
<p>then you can also feel free to be outside</p>
<p>without having to wear sunglasses</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t have to worry about light exposure.</p>
<p>But if you know that window</p>
<p>before your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>that four to six hour window,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the time when if you&rsquo;re viewing a lot of light</p>
<p>in your new location,</p>
<p>you are going to shift your clock pretty considerably.</p>
<p>And then you can come back home and have a terrible time.</p>
<p>At the end of graduate school, I went to Australia,</p>
<p>a remarkable country, incredible people,</p>
<p>incredible wildlife, an amazing time.</p>
<p>I came back and it was the first time in my life</p>
<p>where I couldn&rsquo;t sleep on a regular schedule.</p>
<p>I was sleeping in like hour long increments</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>It was a nightmare.</p>
<p>And it took me weeks to get back on target.</p>
<p>And the way I was able to do that</p>
<p>was exercising consistently at the same time,</p>
<p>every 24 hours,</p>
<p>turning my home into essentially a cave at night,</p>
<p>even covering up the windows,</p>
<p>and then getting as much bright light in my eyes</p>
<p>as I possibly could during the day,</p>
<p>no sunglasses, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it can take some real work</p>
<p>if your clock gets thrown out of whack.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a phenomenon called ICU psychosis</p>
<p>where people that are in the intensive care unit</p>
<p>in hospitals actually lose their mind.</p>
<p>They become psychotic, hallucinations, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because of altered circadian cycles.</p>
<p>We know this because they&rsquo;re exposed to these lights</p>
<p>and these sounds, people coming in and checking on them.</p>
<p>They leave the hospital,</p>
<p>or in some cases there&rsquo;ve been experiments</p>
<p>where people are placed near a window</p>
<p>where they get some natural light</p>
<p>and these psychotic symptoms disappear,</p>
<p>presuming there weren&rsquo;t psychotic symptoms beforehand</p>
<p>before they entered the hospital.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty dramatic what light can do</p>
<p>to the psyche and to the body.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk a little bit</p>
<p>about a different form of jet lag</p>
<p>that requires no planes, no trains, no automobiles,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s shift work.</p>
<p>Shift work is becoming increasingly common.</p>
<p>Many of us are shift working even though we don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing work in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>We are working on our computers at odd hours,</p>
<p>sleeping during the day.</p>
<p>A lot of people who are under shelter in place type stuff</p>
<p>are doing more of this.</p>
<p>Kids with the drifting school schedules.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal with shift work.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one rule of thumb for shift work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that if at all possible,</p>
<p>you want to stay on the same schedule for at least 14 days,</p>
<p>including weekends.</p>
<p>Now that should immediately cue the non-shift workers</p>
<p>to the importance of not getting too far off track</p>
<p>on the weekend, even if you&rsquo;re not a shift worker.</p>
<p>So sleeping in on Sunday is not a good idea.</p>
<p>The most important thing about shift work</p>
<p>is to stay consistent with your schedule.</p>
<p>Now I had a conversation on Instagram Live</p>
<p>with Samer Hattar,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a neuroscientist</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually the head of the chronobiology unit there.</p>
<p>And he was really emphasizing this point</p>
<p>because shift work,</p>
<p>where people are doing the so-called swing shift,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re working four days on one shift</p>
<p>and four days on another,</p>
<p>is extremely detrimental to a number of health parameters.</p>
<p>It gets the cortisol release from the adrenals</p>
<p>really out of whack.</p>
<p>And there are these cortisol spikes</p>
<p>at various hours of the day.</p>
<p>It messes up learning.</p>
<p>It really disrupts the dopamine system and wellbeing.</p>
<p>It is a serious, serious problem.</p>
<p>So if you can negotiate with your employer</p>
<p>to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be immensely beneficial</p>
<p>and will help you offset</p>
<p>a lot of the negative effects of shift work.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t presume that all of you</p>
<p>are going to be able to do that.</p>
<p>Some of you just don&rsquo;t have that level of control.</p>
<p>And of course, I want to acknowledge</p>
<p>that shift workers are essential, right?</p>
<p>Of course, first responders, firefighters,</p>
<p>police officers, paramedics, et cetera,</p>
<p>but also pilots, night nurses,</p>
<p>people working on the hospital wards,</p>
<p>people picking up trash.</p>
<p>These night shifts are critical</p>
<p>to our functioning as a society,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m sure all of you can appreciate.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to work a shift</p>
<p>where let&rsquo;s say you start at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>and you end at 2 a.m., excuse me,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s some important questions that arise.</p>
<p>For instance, should you see light during your shift?</p>
<p>Well, this is a matter of personal choice,</p>
<p>but ideally you want to view as much light as possible</p>
<p>and as safely possible when you need to be alert.</p>
<p>So that would mean from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.</p>
<p>And then you would want to sleep.</p>
<p>So using light as a correlate of alertness</p>
<p>and using darkness as a correlate of sleepiness,</p>
<p>what this means is see as much light as you safely can</p>
<p>during the phase of your day when you want to be awake.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same thing I said way back</p>
<p>at the beginning of this podcast episode.</p>
<p>And see as little light as safely possible</p>
<p>and allows you to function during the time</p>
<p>when you want to be asleep.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re finishing out that 2 a.m. shift,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you would want to avoid bright light exposure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d want to go home.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d really want to avoid watching TV if possible.</p>
<p>If you need that in order to fall asleep,</p>
<p>that would be a case where something</p>
<p>like dimming the screen plus blue blockers,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s in your practice,</p>
<p>or you want to do that would be helpful</p>
<p>and then going to sleep.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll probably wake up late in the afternoon</p>
<p>or early afternoon.</p>
<p>Some of you might say,</p>
<p>wait, Huberman, I thought you don&rsquo;t like blue blockers.</p>
<p>I never said I don&rsquo;t like blue blockers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like people wearing blue blockers</p>
<p>at the time of day when they want to be alert.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like people asserting</p>
<p>that blue blockers can prevent circadian shifts</p>
<p>simply because people are wearing them.</p>
<p>The brightness of light is what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the blue.</p>
<p>So if you want to wear them, wear them,</p>
<p>or just dim the lights or turn the lights off.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you go to sleep at,</p>
<p>you get home after this 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift.</p>
<p>You maybe eat something.</p>
<p>You go to sleep and you wake up and it&rsquo;s noon or 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Should you get light in your eyes?</p>
<p>Well, your first assumption based</p>
<p>on what I&rsquo;ve said previously might be</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in the circadian dead zone,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s noon or 1 p.m.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not in the circadian dead zone</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re somebody who goes to sleep</p>
<p>early in the morning at 2 a.m.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like the circadian dead zone</p>
<p>is a strict time of day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an internal biological clock.</p>
<p>So what do you need to know?</p>
<p>You guessed it.</p>
<p>You need to know your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>You need to know whether or not</p>
<p>your temperature is increasing or decreasing.</p>
<p>And now we can make this whole thing even simpler</p>
<p>and just say, if your temperature is decreasing,</p>
<p>avoid light.</p>
<p>If your temperature is increasing, get light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>Okay, if your temperature is decreasing, avoid light.</p>
<p>If your temperature is increasing, get light.</p>
<p>The shift worker who works from 4 p.m. until 2 a.m.</p>
<p>has a temperature rhythm that&rsquo;s very different than mine</p>
<p>where I wake up around 6 a.m., 5 a.m.</p>
<p>and I go to sleep around 11 p.m., okay?</p>
<p>We both have a 24-hour-ish circadian cycle</p>
<p>except mine is more aligned to the rise</p>
<p>and setting of the sun and theirs is not, right?</p>
<p>So you have to know your internal temperature rhythm</p>
<p>and know you don&rsquo;t have to walk around with a thermometer</p>
<p>wherever taking your temperature.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;d be great if some of the devices</p>
<p>that are out there, you know,</p>
<p>people are counting their steps.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be great</p>
<p>if people had a circadian body temperature measurement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not involved in any of this device development,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a real call to arms, pun intended,</p>
<p>to have a wristband that would measure temperature</p>
<p>and would tell you your temperature minimum</p>
<p>when you travel or whatnot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe some of these devices already do that,</p>
<p>but if they don&rsquo;t, they should.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely absurd to me</p>
<p>why we wouldn&rsquo;t have this simple measurement.</p>
<p>Very easy to get that kind of information.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need the exact temperature read.</p>
<p>All you need to know is the high and low point.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a shift worker who really is nocturnal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re flipped.</p>
<p>Well, you want to stay on that nocturnal schedule.</p>
<p>Now, that can be very hard on families</p>
<p>and social life of all kinds,</p>
<p>but the person who is working, say, from 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>like sundown to sunrise, this raises a question.</p>
<p>Should they be looking at the sunrise</p>
<p>and should they be watching the sunset,</p>
<p>waking up with the sunset, going to sleep with the sunrise?</p>
<p>You think, well, is that light going to throw them off?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just actually going to invert</p>
<p>what sunrise and sunset are.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re waking up in the morning,</p>
<p>if they get some sunlight in their eyes,</p>
<p>they look at the sun and get some bright light</p>
<p>from devices or overhead lights in their apartment or home,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s going to tend to wake them up</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s in the evening, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know if I stated that clearly,</p>
<p>but if in the evening the sun is setting</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking at that setting sun,</p>
<p>that is the morning sun for that person</p>
<p>and it will wake them up for their night shift.</p>
<p>So temperature rising.</p>
<p>Then toward morning, what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>Okay, well, they&rsquo;re closing out their work shift.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going home.</p>
<p>The sun is rising.</p>
<p>Do you look at the rising sun?</p>
<p>Well, based on what you now know,</p>
<p>your eyes are very sensitive</p>
<p>to resetting of circadian clocks.</p>
<p>What will it do at that time?</p>
<p>If this were a classroom,</p>
<p>I would either cold call on somebody</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;d wait for the person in the audience.</p>
<p>That would inevitably exist.</p>
<p>So temperature for that person,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been up for a while.</p>
<p>Temperature is falling, not rising.</p>
<p>For me, it would be rising,</p>
<p>but because I&rsquo;m not diurnal, I&rsquo;m awake during the day.</p>
<p>For that person, the temperature is falling</p>
<p>and so they view light while temperature is falling.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it going to do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to phase delay them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to make it harder for them</p>
<p>to get to sleep the following night.</p>
<p>So you would say that person should watch the setting sun</p>
<p>to help them wake up</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re going to work the night shift,</p>
<p>but you probably have sunglasses on</p>
<p>or avoid viewing bright light before they go to sleep.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just on an inverted,</p>
<p>as a typical person who&rsquo;s diurnal,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re on an inverted schedule.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m really trying hard here</p>
<p>to make this all really clear.</p>
<p>There are kind of two patterns of requests in the world</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m noticing as I&rsquo;ve kind of ventured</p>
<p>into this landscape of social media and podcasts.</p>
<p>There are people who want to know every detail,</p>
<p>want to quantify everything</p>
<p>because they want to get exactly right.</p>
<p>These are like the graduate students</p>
<p>and students that don&rsquo;t want to make a mistake.</p>
<p>And to quote my graduate advisor,</p>
<p>provided the mistakes are not dangerous,</p>
<p>certainly not lethal,</p>
<p>you kind of want to make a few little mistakes</p>
<p>so that you can adjust, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to endanger yourself,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually, you&rsquo;re not going to get things perfect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called learning.</p>
<p>Learning is when you realize,</p>
<p>oh, I viewed some this time and then I stayed up</p>
<p>and it really messed me up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never do that again.</p>
<p>The other category of people seem to want</p>
<p>the one size fits all kind of like,</p>
<p>give me this pill or give me this protocol.</p>
<p>And those things generally work,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t afford people flexibility.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s anything like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this temperature minimum thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been just hammering on again</p>
<p>and again and again today,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something that you own</p>
<p>and that you can really use as a key landmark</p>
<p>for shifting your clock.</p>
<p>I suppose there&rsquo;s a third category,</p>
<p>which is people who accept that biological systems</p>
<p>are actually much more forgiving</p>
<p>than the way they&rsquo;re sometimes described.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to use this as an opportunity</p>
<p>to editorialize a little bit.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s so much made of sleep debt.</p>
<p>Look, there isn&rsquo;t an IRS equivalent for sleep.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to come around</p>
<p>and try and collect all the sleep</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t get.</p>
<p>No one really knows what the consequences</p>
<p>are going to be for you and for me</p>
<p>and for the next person for the sleep you didn&rsquo;t get.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really recover the sleep you missed out on,</p>
<p>but you also don&rsquo;t want to get</p>
<p>neurotically attached to a schedule</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this thing called sleep anxiety,</p>
<p>and then people have trouble falling asleep</p>
<p>and staying asleep.</p>
<p>So I want to spend a moment on that</p>
<p>and go back to a theme that I&rsquo;ve said many times before,</p>
<p>because these tools work,</p>
<p>what I called NSDR, non-sleep depressed.</p>
<p>So this would be hypnosis.</p>
<p>I give you the link, but I&rsquo;ll say it again,</p>
<p>reveriehealth.com for clinically tested,</p>
<p>research tested, free hypnosis for anxiety,</p>
<p>but also for sleep.</p>
<p>Those are very beneficial people.</p>
<p>NSDR protocols, non-sleep depressed protocols</p>
<p>for things like yoga nidra.</p>
<p>I provide some links to those in the caption for episode two.</p>
<p>These things really work.</p>
<p>Last night I woke up, I went to bed about 1030.</p>
<p>I woke up at three in the morning.</p>
<p>I knew I wasn&rsquo;t feeling rested.</p>
<p>I did a NSDR protocol.</p>
<p>I fell back asleep.</p>
<p>I woke up at 630, okay?</p>
<p>You need to teach your brain and your nervous system</p>
<p>how to turn off your thoughts and go to sleep.</p>
<p>And ideally you do that without medication,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a real need,</p>
<p>you do that through these behavioral protocols.</p>
<p>They work because they involve using the body</p>
<p>to shift the mind,</p>
<p>not trying to just turn off your thoughts</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Now there are periods of life where things are stressful</p>
<p>and people are concerned</p>
<p>and you will have some struggle getting and staying asleep.</p>
<p>And that really has to do more with anxiety,</p>
<p>which NSDR protocols also can help with.</p>
<p>As I always say, do them in the middle of the night</p>
<p>if you wake up and you want to go back to sleep,</p>
<p>do in the middle of the day</p>
<p>to teach your nervous system how to calm down</p>
<p>or do them first thing in the morning</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t feel you got enough sleep.</p>
<p>In other words, do them whenever you have an opportunity</p>
<p>to do them because they really can help you learn</p>
<p>how to turn on the parasympathetic</p>
<p>slash calming arm of your autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other way that I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>to teach your system to slow down</p>
<p>and turn off your thoughts and go back to sleep.</p>
<p>But these are powerful protocols</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of research now</p>
<p>to support the fact that they can really help.</p>
<p>Meditation would be another example.</p>
<p>Meditation of certain kinds of meditation</p>
<p>involve focus and alertness.</p>
<p>Those are slightly different than meditations</p>
<p>that involve lack of focus and attention</p>
<p>to say internal states.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pause there</p>
<p>and then I want to talk about kids and the elderly.</p>
<p>In other words, how do we control sleep</p>
<p>and circadian rhythms and wakefulness</p>
<p>in babies, adolescents, teens, and aged folks?</p>
<p>All right, before we talk about sleep and kids,</p>
<p>I want to tell a little story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a joke.</p>
<p>Many of you will be relieved that I&rsquo;m not going to try</p>
<p>and tell another joke this episode,</p>
<p>which is the relationship between light,</p>
<p>skin and pellage color, dopamine and reproduction, mating.</p>
<p>So many seasonally breeding animals,</p>
<p>Siberian hamsters, which I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>rabbits, fox, other animals change their color</p>
<p>of their coat.</p>
<p>In the winter, they tend to be a lighter color.</p>
<p>Sometimes pure white,</p>
<p>sometimes with flecks of black or brown.</p>
<p>And in the summer, their pellage changes to a color</p>
<p>of brown or red, some other vastly different color.</p>
<p>That shift is controlled by light and by melatonin.</p>
<p>This has an interesting correlate in humans.</p>
<p>So humans obviously have different skin tones,</p>
<p>just genetically, because of the amount of melanin</p>
<p>in one&rsquo;s skin, depending on genetic background.</p>
<p>But of course, sunlight will increase the amount of melanin</p>
<p>in the skin regardless, right?</p>
<p>This is sun tan, sunburn, et cetera, bronzing, whatever.</p>
<p>The whole system is wired so that shifts in skin color</p>
<p>and shifts in these cells within the eye and melatonin</p>
<p>are actually very closely linked.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the story.</p>
<p>Many years ago, meaning about 10 years ago, 15 years ago,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see, it was 20 years ago, forgive me,</p>
<p>a guy named Iggy Provencio,</p>
<p>who was running his own lab at Uniformed Armed Services.</p>
<p>This is a standard biological laboratory,</p>
<p>discovered that there was an opsin in the eye,</p>
<p>in the cells of the eye that connect</p>
<p>to the rest of the brain called melanopsin.</p>
<p>Melanopsin, as many of you now know, is the opsin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a pigment.</p>
<p>It absorbs light.</p>
<p>It is the opsin that converts light into electrical signals</p>
<p>that then set the circadian clock.</p>
<p>Iggy discovered melanopsin because it was similar in form</p>
<p>to what was in frog melanophores.</p>
<p>It was actually in the skin of frogs</p>
<p>that allowed those frogs to go from pale white</p>
<p>when it was dark for most of the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>to pigmented, green or brown for a frog.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this relationship between the cells in our eye</p>
<p>and the pigment cells of our skin.</p>
<p>And we also know that in long days, there&rsquo;s more breeding.</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s actually from dopamine</p>
<p>triggering increases in testosterone mainly in males</p>
<p>and estrogen mainly in females,</p>
<p>although of course there&rsquo;s testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in both sexes.</p>
<p>So we have this kind of pathway where it&rsquo;s light,</p>
<p>increases in melanin, dopamine and reproduction</p>
<p>on the one hand, and lack of light, melatonin decreases</p>
<p>in the darkness of skin, less melanin in the skin,</p>
<p>or in the case of an animal with fur,</p>
<p>white fur and no reproduction on the other hand.</p>
<p>And humans don&rsquo;t actually shift their breeding patterns</p>
<p>tremendously from long days and short days,</p>
<p>although there are some data that there&rsquo;s some shifts.</p>
<p>We also don&rsquo;t radically change our skin color</p>
<p>depending on how much sunlight exposure we have.</p>
<p>But the simple way to put this is when days are long,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more dopamine and we feel really good.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot more breeding and breeding like behavior.</p>
<p>When days are short, there&rsquo;s a lot less dopamine</p>
<p>and a lot less breeding behavior</p>
<p>because these pathways are very highly conserved.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting is that as we&rsquo;ve moved</p>
<p>into a modern society where much of our waking days</p>
<p>we are looking at screens, which is fine</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re getting a lot of light that way,</p>
<p>although not as much as sunlight.</p>
<p>But also at night, we&rsquo;re getting a lot of light</p>
<p>from screens.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happened is all these pathways,</p>
<p>melanin in the skin, turnover of skin cells, dopamine,</p>
<p>all of this stuff has become completely disrupted.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not to say that we should go back to a time</p>
<p>in which we didn&rsquo;t use artificial lights,</p>
<p>but I think the important thing to realize</p>
<p>is that feeling good with getting a lot of light,</p>
<p>the relationship to dopamine and melanin in the skin</p>
<p>and the good feelings of getting light also on our skin,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re not getting burned</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not getting excessive UV exposure,</p>
<p>those are not just coincidences.</p>
<p>Those are hardwired biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that exist in everybody, regardless of how light or dark</p>
<p>your skin is to begin with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another point which is important,</p>
<p>which is that the dopamine system,</p>
<p>which is this feel-good molecule,</p>
<p>is very closely related to the testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>and reproductive cycles.</p>
<p>Remember, melatonin inhibits</p>
<p>gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>and the production of these hormones.</p>
<p>And melatonin is the effector.</p>
<p>It is the hormone of darkness.</p>
<p>So I just threw a lot of biology at you,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re like a Siberian hamster,</p>
<p>at least not in ways that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that your pellage color is going to change.</p>
<p>Actually, the reason people go gray</p>
<p>is because when you&rsquo;re really stressed, did you know this?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re really stressed,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an increase in the nerve fibers</p>
<p>that release adrenaline to the hair follicle,</p>
<p>and that activates peroxide groups in the hair follicle</p>
<p>that cause the hair to actually go gray or white.</p>
<p>So actually, stress does make your hair gray or white.</p>
<p>Aging does it too.</p>
<p>So that was a brief aside,</p>
<p>but for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in the relationship between light and skin tone</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>I thought you might find it interesting</p>
<p>that these cells in your eye</p>
<p>are a lot like these skin cells in frogs or in animals</p>
<p>that shift their entire color</p>
<p>and sometimes metamorphosize.</p>
<p>You know, there are some species</p>
<p>that literally change shape in the reproductive organs.</p>
<p>In fact, if that wasn&rsquo;t weird enough,</p>
<p>when I was in graduate school at Berkeley,</p>
<p>there was another graduate student</p>
<p>studying a species of hermaphroditic mole,</p>
<p>right, those little things that dig,</p>
<p>hermaphrodite mole that would change</p>
<p>from having ovaries to testes and back again,</p>
<p>depending on daylight.</p>
<p>Super cool, super different and wild biological mechanism.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering how those animals reproduce,</p>
<p>they actually adjust the numbers of males and females</p>
<p>depending on the density of males and females.</p>
<p>So if there are too many males,</p>
<p>some of the males turn their testes into ovaries</p>
<p>and if there are too many females,</p>
<p>they turn their ovaries into testes.</p>
<p>They actually are true hermaphroditic animals</p>
<p>as opposed to pseudo hermaphroditic animals.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get back on track.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the animal that most of you care about,</p>
<p>which is the human animal.</p>
<p>New parents and babies.</p>
<p>All right, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>melatonin is not cyclic, it&rsquo;s not cycling in babies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more phasic, it&rsquo;s being released</p>
<p>at a kind of a constant level.</p>
<p>And babies tend to be smaller than adults, they are.</p>
<p>And so those concentrations of melatonin are very high.</p>
<p>As a baby grows, those concentrations per unit volume</p>
<p>are going to go down.</p>
<p>Babies are not born with a typical sleep-wake cycle.</p>
<p>And now all the parents saying,</p>
<p>tell me something I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They also have, and I really want to emphasize this,</p>
<p>they also have much more sensitive optics of the eye.</p>
<p>So a number of people have asked me,</p>
<p>should I be exposing my baby to sunlight?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to avoid sunlight,</p>
<p>but their eyes are very sensitive.</p>
<p>The optics of their eyes aren&rsquo;t quite developed,</p>
<p>so much so that when you look at a newborn baby</p>
<p>and they look a little glassy-eyed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of looking through you</p>
<p>or even a young child, a lot of people think</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re seeing you the way that you&rsquo;re seeing them.</p>
<p>Hate to break it to you, but if you ever can just Google</p>
<p>visual image of a one-month-old,</p>
<p>the optics of their eyes are so poor</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a cloudy image.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not seeing your fine detail.</p>
<p>As the optics get better,</p>
<p>then they will see you with more and more clarity.</p>
<p>But a lot of that is clearing of the lens</p>
<p>and some of the other aqueous features of the newborn eye.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t see very well.</p>
<p>But they also don&rsquo;t have such great ways</p>
<p>of adjusting to bright light.</p>
<p>And so babies have a natural aversion to bright light.</p>
<p>So you really want to avoid trying to use sunlight</p>
<p>or really bright light in the same way</p>
<p>that you would for an adult on a young baby or child.</p>
<p>As children get older, however,</p>
<p>melatonin does start to become slightly more cyclic,</p>
<p>slightly more cycled,</p>
<p>and their body temperature rhythms</p>
<p>also start to fall into a more regular,</p>
<p>not quite 24-hour rhythm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more of these ultradian rhythms.</p>
<p>So in an episode,</p>
<p>I think it was one or two of the podcast, or maybe both,</p>
<p>we talked about these 90-minute so-called ultradian rhythms</p>
<p>where every 90 minutes,</p>
<p>babies are going through a cycle of body temperature</p>
<p>and some other hormonal features.</p>
<p>I mean, so much is changing in their system.</p>
<p>So what to do if a child isn&rsquo;t sleeping?</p>
<p>You can use phases of darkness and phases of light,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re going to have to be shortened</p>
<p>in order to try and encourage sleep</p>
<p>when you want the child to sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re just not going to fall</p>
<p>into an adult-like regime of a temperature minimum</p>
<p>and a temperature maximum.</p>
<p>Their temperature minimums and maximums</p>
<p>are fluctuating much more quickly,</p>
<p>and it varies tremendously.</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s an interesting literature</p>
<p>of whether or not they have siblings,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re twins,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re in a nursery environment,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>Hopefully the baby&rsquo;s not alone, but you know what I mean,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re sleeping alone in a room</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re in the other room.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that seem to help,</p>
<p>which is getting the overall environment</p>
<p>into a 24-hour schedule.</p>
<p>So having the room slightly colder,</p>
<p>obviously you want babies to be nice and cozy,</p>
<p>slightly colder when you would like them to be asleep,</p>
<p>slightly warmer for the times</p>
<p>you would like them to be awake.</p>
<p>Babies tend to run pretty hot anyway.</p>
<p>And obviously you want to be very careful</p>
<p>about avoiding all extremes of temperature, cold or hot.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re going through these 90-minute cycles,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to adjust</p>
<p>to those 90-minute cycles as well.</p>
<p>So then people say,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s not going to help me at all</p>
<p>because how do I deal with the fact</p>
<p>that I need to be up every 90 minutes at night?</p>
<p>There are a couple tools that can be helpful.</p>
<p>The first one is going to be to try</p>
<p>and understand the relationship</p>
<p>between calm and deep sleep.</p>
<p>So the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>can put us into states of panic</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s kind of seesaw of autonomic alertness</p>
<p>goes all the way to panic,</p>
<p>or it can be alertness or it can be alert and calm, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a range there, it&rsquo;s a continuum.</p>
<p>Can also be that you&rsquo;re in deep sleep,</p>
<p>so the other end of the seesaw is way up,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in light sleep, or you&rsquo;re kind of sleepy,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just feeling kind of relaxed.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re having to map to a baby&rsquo;s schedule</p>
<p>in order to make sure that they&rsquo;re getting changings</p>
<p>and nursing, et cetera, at the appropriate times</p>
<p>is to try and maintain, if you can&rsquo;t sleep,</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t sleep continuously,</p>
<p>to try and maintain your autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>in a place where you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>into heightened states of alertness</p>
<p>when you would ideally be sleeping.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that this could be translated</p>
<p>to try and stay calm while you&rsquo;re sleep deprived,</p>
<p>which is very hard for people to do,</p>
<p>but this is where the non-sleep deep rest protocols</p>
<p>surface again, and can potentially be very beneficial</p>
<p>for people to be able to recover, not necessarily sleep,</p>
<p>but for them to maintain a certain amount</p>
<p>of autonomic regulation.</p>
<p>So what would this look like?</p>
<p>This would look like the baby goes down,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s only going to go down for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>If you can capture sleep,</p>
<p>capture sleep, there are some data showing</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called polyphasic sleep.</p>
<p>If you can sleep in 45-minute increments or batches,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s spread throughout the day</p>
<p>with periods of wakefulness in between,</p>
<p>as miserable as that sound,</p>
<p>there are actually some adults</p>
<p>that have deliberately employed that</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have children for sake of work productivity,</p>
<p>and it does tend to reduce</p>
<p>the total overall amount of sleep that you need.</p>
<p>It is a very hard schedule for most people to maintain,</p>
<p>but if you have a baby,</p>
<p>the baby may be throwing you</p>
<p>into that kind of schedule anyway.</p>
<p>So if you can get 45 minutes sleep while they sleep, great.</p>
<p>If you can get another 45 minutes after waking</p>
<p>and then they go back down to sleep, great.</p>
<p>So as many phases of sleep as you can get,</p>
<p>but if you can&rsquo;t sleep,</p>
<p>the data on non-sleep deep rest type protocols</p>
<p>does show that at least from a neurochemical level,</p>
<p>want to be clear what that means,</p>
<p>reset of things like dopamine levels in the basal ganglia</p>
<p>measured by things like positron emission tomography,</p>
<p>et cetera, those things tend to reset themselves pretty well</p>
<p>if you can access these deep rest states.</p>
<p>So that means not being alert</p>
<p>throughout the entire time that the baby is sleeping,</p>
<p>trying to sort of mirror the baby&rsquo;s sleep cycle,</p>
<p>which can be brutal for certain people,</p>
<p>and especially if you&rsquo;re trying to prepare meals</p>
<p>and do all these things.</p>
<p>So I do recognize that there are a lot of constraints</p>
<p>on parenting, not just mapping on your baby&rsquo;s sleep schedule.</p>
<p>As children approach ages one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when certainly the optics of the eyes have improved,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to damage the eyes, of course,</p>
<p>with very bright light.</p>
<p>They are much more sensitive</p>
<p>even until they&rsquo;re kind of 10, 11 years old.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about vision in children in a moment,</p>
<p>but trying to get longer and longer batches of sleep</p>
<p>through, hopefully not through the use</p>
<p>of administering melatonin to the kids,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what I talked about before,</p>
<p>why that could potentially be detrimental.</p>
<p>Talk about that with your doctor,</p>
<p>but more so trying to get longer blocks of sleep</p>
<p>that map onto these ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>So it would be better off to get a three hour,</p>
<p>like two 90 minute cycles,</p>
<p>then to a four hour batch of sleep</p>
<p>because waking up in the middle of those ultradian cycles</p>
<p>can just be brutal for parent and kid.</p>
<p>So if one can&rsquo;t get a full six or 10,</p>
<p>or some kids should even be sleeping 12 hours</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re growing quickly,</p>
<p>trying to get batches of sleep,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re fractured throughout the 24 hour cycle</p>
<p>that are matched more to these 90 minute cycles,</p>
<p>meaning maybe one ultradian cycle of 90 minutes</p>
<p>or two back-to-back or three back-to-back-to-back,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be better than waking up</p>
<p>in the middle of an ultradian cycle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to set any number of other things</p>
<p>in a better direction than were you to try to say,</p>
<p>just enforce or force a full eight or 10 hours of sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at least what the literature shows.</p>
<p>Some kids sleep great through the night,</p>
<p>starting at a very young age, others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I typically hear from people who are struggling tremendously.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re losing their mind, understandably,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not sleeping, their kid&rsquo;s not sleeping,</p>
<p>or their kid is sleeping for such brief periods.</p>
<p>So in other words, trying to access deep calm</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t sleep,</p>
<p>trying to access sleep if you can sleep,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s fractured.</p>
<p>And then you say, well, what about all the sunlight viewing</p>
<p>and the exercise stuff?</p>
<p>When sleep is really, really dismantled,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s happening in various times of day or night,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s especially, at those times,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be especially important for the parent</p>
<p>to get morning and evening sunlight</p>
<p>because your circadian clock is going into a tailspin</p>
<p>and it basically wants to anchor to something.</p>
<p>So you want to give it two anchors,</p>
<p>morning and evening light, okay?</p>
<p>So this is rather different</p>
<p>than what I described for shift work.</p>
<p>This is when things are really chaotic</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just not able to sleep.</p>
<p>Similar circumstances can arise</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking care of a very sick loved one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re up all night, try and stay calm using NSDR protocols.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s harder to do than to say,</p>
<p>but those protocols are there, they&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s research to support them.</p>
<p>Try and get sleep whenever you can,</p>
<p>but also try to get morning sunlight</p>
<p>and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t get that, use artificial light, okay?</p>
<p>What about later life?</p>
<p>So kids now, adolescents, teens,</p>
<p>it is true that teens have a tendency to wake up later</p>
<p>and go to sleep later,</p>
<p>in part just because they&rsquo;re sleeping a lot more.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re churning out gonadotropin-releasing hormone</p>
<p>and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>Their whole bodies are changing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether or not people realize this,</p>
<p>but the fastest rate of aging</p>
<p>that any of us will ever undergo is puberty.</p>
<p>That is the fastest rate of aging.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a huge number of biological processes</p>
<p>that are happening during puberty.</p>
<p>Probably devote a whole episode to puberty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating aspect to the life course,</p>
<p>but it is an accelerated period of aging.</p>
<p>And the circadian clock mechanism</p>
<p>sometimes are very intact,</p>
<p>and sometimes they&rsquo;re a little dismantled</p>
<p>and going through some change,</p>
<p>but prioritize the duration of sleep</p>
<p>for adolescents and teens.</p>
<p>Now, if that means they&rsquo;re sleeping until 2 p.m.</p>
<p>and then waking up, and then they&rsquo;re up all night,</p>
<p>the up all night part can become a problem,</p>
<p>especially with all the devices,</p>
<p>texting in their rooms or playing video games.</p>
<p>Morning and evening sunlight would be ideal,</p>
<p>but some kids are just going to sleep</p>
<p>through the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>However, if you were to measure their temperature,</p>
<p>what you would find is that their temperature minimum</p>
<p>would come later in the morning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be 8 a.m.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be maybe even 10 a.m.</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re sleeping until 11 or 12,</p>
<p>or it might be 8 a.m. if they&rsquo;re sleeping until 10.</p>
<p>Remember, temperature minimum is two hours</p>
<p>before your average waking time, typically.</p>
<p>So in teens, it maximizes the total amount of sleep.</p>
<p>Try and get regular sunlight either in the morning</p>
<p>or in the evening or both,</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;re sleeping through the morning sunrise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not as much of an issue.</p>
<p>Waking them up and depriving them of sleep</p>
<p>is probably worse because their Tmin,</p>
<p>their temperature minimum, is actually falling later.</p>
<p>So their circadian dead zone is later, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I think with adolescents and teens,</p>
<p>it makes sense to kind of give them a little bit more rope</p>
<p>in terms of allowing them some leeway</p>
<p>to adjust their own schedule.</p>
<p>Some schools are even starting classes later</p>
<p>on the basis of some very good biology</p>
<p>to support this late-shifted rhythm</p>
<p>and this extended sleep phase.</p>
<p>There are data from Dr. Jamie Zeitzer,</p>
<p>Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,</p>
<p>and others at Stanford,</p>
<p>showing that turning on the lights in the room of a teen</p>
<p>before they wake up helps them get more sleep</p>
<p>the subsequent night.</p>
<p>It also tricks them into going to sleep</p>
<p>a little bit earlier,</p>
<p>but it gives them about 45 minutes more of deep sleep,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s been shown statistically.</p>
<p>Total sleep time increases as well.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re hiding under the covers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to work,</p>
<p>but their eyes don&rsquo;t have to be open.</p>
<p>I know a few parents now that are coming in</p>
<p>with a flashlight and flashing their kids</p>
<p>over their eyelids before they wake up</p>
<p>in hopes of getting this to work.</p>
<p>Some have told me this is working.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not part of a standard study,</p>
<p>but it does seem to work because,</p>
<p>now you should know why,</p>
<p>because if light&rsquo;s getting through the eyelids</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, say, 8 a.m. and the kid is still asleep</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to wake up at 10,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving them light just after</p>
<p>or around their temperature minimum,</p>
<p>which is going to make them want to go to sleep earlier.</p>
<p>And in the case of teens,</p>
<p>for some reason we don&rsquo;t quite understand,</p>
<p>sleep longer, about 45 minutes longer,</p>
<p>spend more time in deep sleep.</p>
<p>Adults can do this too.</p>
<p>If you can persuade someone or put your lights on a timer</p>
<p>for lights to go on before you wake up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really going to help you wake up earlier.</p>
<p>Okay, so if you&rsquo;re starting to hear</p>
<p>some themes are really resounding over and over again,</p>
<p>that should be reassuring to you, right?</p>
<p>These are core mechanisms.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there aren&rsquo;t 1,000 different mechanisms.</p>
<p>Now, in the elderly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real tendency to want to go to sleep very early</p>
<p>and wake up very early.</p>
<p>And people should talk to their physician.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that melatonin levels</p>
<p>and patterns of melatonin secretion</p>
<p>can become a little chaotic in elderly folks.</p>
<p>What do I mean by elderly?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s going to differ.</p>
<p>Rates of aging differ, right?</p>
<p>You see some 65-year-olds that are struggling to move</p>
<p>and seem much older than some 65-year-olds</p>
<p>that are still hustling around and have tons of energy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of variation.</p>
<p>Some of it&rsquo;s genetic, some of it&rsquo;s lifestyle factors.</p>
<p>It really varies.</p>
<p>Certainly lifestyle factors can play an important role</p>
<p>in rates of aging.</p>
<p>I think that the most prominent results</p>
<p>from sleep and circadian rhythms in the elderly</p>
<p>are they need to get as much natural light,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s through windows.</p>
<p>I realize that some elderly folks</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get outside as easily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not safe for them to do it.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t move around as easily.</p>
<p>Exercise can come in various forms.</p>
<p>For people that can&rsquo;t get outside</p>
<p>and get a ton of sunlight by jogging or cycling,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not able to do that.</p>
<p>Light through a window in that case, open window ideally,</p>
<p>but for temperature reasons, et cetera,</p>
<p>sometimes the window has to be closed.</p>
<p>Getting people near that window</p>
<p>and away from artificial light early in the day</p>
<p>and away from artificial lights during the night phase</p>
<p>can have a tremendous effect.</p>
<p>And in the elderly,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when melatonin might be a viable option.</p>
<p>And this should be discussed with a physician, of course,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re way past the puberty time point.</p>
<p>In most cases, people who are in their 70s and 80s and 90s</p>
<p>are not churning out a lot of GnRH</p>
<p>and luteinizing hormone to begin with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where struggles with falling asleep</p>
<p>and staying asleep,</p>
<p>all the same parameters and things we&rsquo;ve described before</p>
<p>still apply, light, exercise, temperature, et cetera,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where melatonin might be of greatest benefit.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not pushing melatonin here,</p>
<p>but I think for elderly folks who are having trouble</p>
<p>falling and staying asleep, that might be worthwhile.</p>
<p>There are, and I should just also mention</p>
<p>that regular schedule for folks that are elderly</p>
<p>and as much natural light as safely possible,</p>
<p>those are going to be the key levers</p>
<p>for adjusting sleep and circadian schedules.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before on previous podcasts,</p>
<p>other supplements besides melatonin.</p>
<p>And some of those supplements are quite good for sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a supplement pusher.</p>
<p>I am somebody who takes supplements.</p>
<p>I believe in them.</p>
<p>Some have worked for me, some have not worked as well,</p>
<p>but I certainly believe in getting the behaviors right,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s NSDR protocols,</p>
<p>viewing natural light, exercise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hot baths or cold showers or what have you,</p>
<p>behavioral protocols first.</p>
<p>There are some supplements</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve mentioned in previous podcasts,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seemed to get a lot of questions about.</p>
<p>So I just want to take a couple of minutes</p>
<p>and just talk about some of the supplements</p>
<p>that can be beneficial for helping turning off thinking,</p>
<p>accessing deeper sleep,</p>
<p>and even being able to compact your sleep schedule</p>
<p>into a shorter period of hours,</p>
<p>meaning getting by well with less sleep.</p>
<p>People take a lot of sleeping pills.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell people not to take sleeping pills.</p>
<p>They can be very problematic, habit-forming,</p>
<p>high side effect incidents in many cases.</p>
<p>Some people can handle them just fine.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not a physician, don&rsquo;t prescribe anything,</p>
<p>professor, so I profess a lot of things,</p>
<p>some of which are my opinion.</p>
<p>Although, if you look at the scientific literature,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some impressive data</p>
<p>around some non-prescription drug type supplements</p>
<p>that have fairly high safety margins that you might consider,</p>
<p>but you should talk to your doctor always</p>
<p>before adding or taking anything</p>
<p>out of your health regimes, right?</p>
<p>Your health is not my responsibility,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your responsibility, so be a stringent filter.</p>
<p>Along those lines, one of the most powerful</p>
<p>and useful tools that I&rsquo;ve mentioned here on many times,</p>
<p>and I plan to mention many, many more times,</p>
<p>is the website examine.com,</p>
<p>which I have no affiliation with,</p>
<p>but is a wonderful site that links you</p>
<p>to quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>related to just about any supplement,</p>
<p>including some safety warnings.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also tell you what subjects,</p>
<p>whether or not it was rats, cats, elderly folks, or kids,</p>
<p>that a given study was done on, which is important,</p>
<p>can be kind of hard to pull from sites</p>
<p>where people are just advertising supplements, right?</p>
<p>They usually don&rsquo;t tell you what the study was</p>
<p>and who were these rats, who were these kids.</p>
<p>Et cetera.</p>
<p>There are three supplements that, at least for me,</p>
<p>have had a tremendously positive effect on my sleep</p>
<p>that some of you might consider.</p>
<p>I would say, if you&rsquo;re doing everything properly,</p>
<p>behaviorally, and you&rsquo;re still having issues,</p>
<p>then supplements might be a good thing for you.</p>
<p>Or if you are traveling and you want a little bit</p>
<p>of extra help in buffering your sleep wakefulness protocols.</p>
<p>Some people like to go just to the supplements.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, what should I take?</p>
<p>I have people in my life that are like,</p>
<p>just tell me what to take.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more of, here&rsquo;s what you might want to do or not do,</p>
<p>but, and then think about what you might want to take</p>
<p>or not take, but personal preference,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s free country, so you can do what you like.</p>
<p>Magnesium.</p>
<p>So magnesium has been shown to increase the depth of sleep</p>
<p>and has been shown to decrease the amount of time</p>
<p>that it takes to access sleep, to fall asleep.</p>
<p>It comes in various forms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a bunch of times about magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate,</p>
<p>which seems to be the more bioavailable form of magnesium,</p>
<p>and magnesium threonate, it seems,</p>
<p>is shuttled preferentially to the brain,</p>
<p>which is where you want it,</p>
<p>and there are certain transporters.</p>
<p>It actually engages the GABA pathway,</p>
<p>which tends to turn off certain areas of the forebrain,</p>
<p>allows you to fall asleep.</p>
<p>There is a study, if you would like to explore it,</p>
<p>since people serious about supplementation</p>
<p>might want to explore the study,</p>
<p>which is ATES et al., A-T-E-S,</p>
<p>dose-dependent absorption profile</p>
<p>of different magnesium compounds.</p>
<p>Looks to me like a quality peer-reviewed paper.</p>
<p>I can put the link in the caption,</p>
<p>and it explores all the different forms of magnesium.</p>
<p>It does seem like magnesium glycinate</p>
<p>can be similar to magnesium threonate</p>
<p>in terms of which tissues it&rsquo;s shuttled to.</p>
<p>Magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E,</p>
<p>is preferentially shuttled to the muscle, it appears,</p>
<p>as opposed to the brain,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s going to be more of a muscle repair type thing</p>
<p>or restoring magnesium stores in the periphery</p>
<p>as opposed to the brain.</p>
<p>Magnesium citrate has another name</p>
<p>that I won&rsquo;t mention in jest</p>
<p>because magnesium citrate&rsquo;s main effect,</p>
<p>at least on me and the people I know,</p>
<p>seems to be a laxative effect</p>
<p>as opposed to a cognitive effect.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some evidence</p>
<p>that magnesium threonate can be neuroprotective.</p>
<p>Those data come from quality labs,</p>
<p>mostly rodent studies, not human studies,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>And again, the safety margins for these things</p>
<p>tend to be pretty high,</p>
<p>but anytime you&rsquo;re going to take something new,</p>
<p>you should approach it with caution,</p>
<p>especially since magnesium could be involved</p>
<p>in heart rhythm and things of that sort.</p>
<p>The other supplement that has been very beneficial for me</p>
<p>is theanine.</p>
<p>So this is T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.</p>
<p>Theanine activates certain GABA pathways,</p>
<p>which are involved in turning off top-down processing</p>
<p>and thinking, making it easier to fall asleep.</p>
<p>And theanine, 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams,</p>
<p>has a calming effect.</p>
<p>Theanine is now showing up</p>
<p>in a number of different energy drinks</p>
<p>and even some coffees as a way to try and get people</p>
<p>to ingest more of a given type of coffee</p>
<p>because the idea is it would take away the jitters</p>
<p>and the anxiety, allowing people to drink more coffee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about taking magnesium and theanine</p>
<p>30 to 60 minutes before bedtime,</p>
<p>not during the day to quell anxiety,</p>
<p>but rather 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime</p>
<p>with or without food for me has made a difference.</p>
<p>And the combination of those two things has really helped.</p>
<p>Theanine for sleepwalkers can be a problem.</p>
<p>It does increase the intensity of your dreams.</p>
<p>It gives you very vivid dreams.</p>
<p>So for sleepwalkers or people that get night terrors,</p>
<p>stay away from theanine is my advice.</p>
<p>Magnesium, theanine might be something to explore</p>
<p>for those of you that don&rsquo;t have those issues</p>
<p>with the emphasis on might.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve talked about a compound.</p>
<p>And last time I talked about the mechanisms of apigenin,</p>
<p>which is a derivative of chamomile, A-P-I-G-E-N,</p>
<p>which acts as a little bit of a hypnotic</p>
<p>by activating chloride channels,</p>
<p>hyperpolarizes neurons, increases GABA in the brain,</p>
<p>basically makes you feel a little sleepy.</p>
<p>And chamomile, for those of you that read your,</p>
<p>what was it?</p>
<p>The Peter Rabbit snuck into Mr. McGregor&rsquo;s garden,</p>
<p>ate the chamomile, fell asleep.</p>
<p>Mr. McGregor came back.</p>
<p>Okay, anyone flashing back to elementary school?</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a story about chamomile</p>
<p>having these kind of sedative-like effects.</p>
<p>Apigenin is highly concentrated.</p>
<p>Chamomile also has anti-estrogenic effects.</p>
<p>So if you want to keep your estrogen up,</p>
<p>you might want to be cautious about apigenin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where things like examine.com become really useful</p>
<p>because you can go to examine, you put in apigenin,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll tell you all the things that it does</p>
<p>and all the things that it does</p>
<p>can sometimes include things that you had no idea,</p>
<p>like reducing conversion of certain androgens to estrogens,</p>
<p>which you might like, or you might want to avoid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s up to you and where you want your estrogen levels,</p>
<p>depending on who you are</p>
<p>and what your life circumstances and goals are.</p>
<p>A few other things that can help the transition to sleep</p>
<p>are things like 5-HTP, L-tryptophan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about why I&rsquo;m not a fan of those for me.</p>
<p>They tend to throw me into deep sleep</p>
<p>and then I wake up and I can&rsquo;t fall back asleep.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like to tinker with my serotonin system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to tinker with my dopamine system</p>
<p>for entirely other reasons,</p>
<p>but none of which are particularly concerning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I find that if I increase my dopamine</p>
<p>by taking L-tyrosine in pill form,</p>
<p>then I crash really hard the next day.</p>
<p>Or if I take 5-HTP or L-tryptophan,</p>
<p>I fall deeply asleep and then I wake up.</p>
<p>But I did mention that there might be ways</p>
<p>to make sleep more compact.</p>
<p>And so this is actually a request to you.</p>
<p>I had a really interesting experience when I was a postdoc.</p>
<p>I went for the first time to an acupuncturist.</p>
<p>I know there are varying thoughts</p>
<p>and opinions out there about acupuncture.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I benefited so much from the acupuncture.</p>
<p>There are now quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>showing, published in Neuron,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,</p>
<p>showing that acupuncture can stimulate</p>
<p>some anti-inflammatory compounds,</p>
<p>depending on where the acupuncture is done.</p>
<p>This is a really good study.</p>
<p>This came out last year.</p>
<p>I talked about this on Instagram.</p>
<p>I may talk about it again.</p>
<p>As well as certain acupuncture sites</p>
<p>that increase inflammation.</p>
<p>So, you know, you can get different types of effects.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say acupuncture is great across the board.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m assuming that the acupuncturists know</p>
<p>which sites are good for increasing inflammation,</p>
<p>which ones are good for decreasing inflammation.</p>
<p>However, this acupuncturist that I went to</p>
<p>gave me these red pills.</p>
<p>He said, these are minerals for sleep.</p>
<p>And it was remarkable.</p>
<p>I took the red pills.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a thing now?</p>
<p>Take the red pill.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that means because I&rsquo;m not tuned in.</p>
<p>But these red pills look like little M&amp;Ms.</p>
<p>I took a couple of them on his suggestion.</p>
<p>And I fell deeply asleep.</p>
<p>And four hours later, woke up feeling incredibly rested,</p>
<p>more rested than I&rsquo;d ever felt in my entire life.</p>
<p>And I never required more than four hours sleep.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, acupuncturist moved away.</p>
<p>I never figured out what was in those red pills.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to do the mass spectroscopy.</p>
<p>And I still wonder.</p>
<p>He said they were minerals.</p>
<p>So somebody out there knows what these red pills are</p>
<p>and what this compound is.</p>
<p>And it was incredible.</p>
<p>And I would love to know what those are.</p>
<p>So if you know,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t go taking red pills at random</p>
<p>to try and recreate this non-experiment experience of mine.</p>
<p>But please do contact me if you find out</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re an acupuncturist</p>
<p>and you know what these mysterious red pills were</p>
<p>because they were pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Once again, I&rsquo;ve thrown a tremendous amount</p>
<p>of information at you.</p>
<p>I hope you will figure out your temperature minimum</p>
<p>and start working with that</p>
<p>to access the sleep and wakeful cycles</p>
<p>that you want to access.</p>
<p>I hope that you&rsquo;ll explore NSDR.</p>
<p>You might want to explore supplementation</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>You have now access to a lot of mechanism</p>
<p>about sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>But in keeping with the theme of this podcast</p>
<p>where we stay on topic for an entire month</p>
<p>or even slightly more,</p>
<p>we are not done with sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>I know this is very different</p>
<p>than the typical podcast format</p>
<p>where one week it&rsquo;s how to become superhuman.</p>
<p>And the next week it&rsquo;s how to develop growth mindset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of all over the place with episode to episode.</p>
<p>We are staying on track because I really believe</p>
<p>that as we drill deeper and deeper into these mechanisms</p>
<p>and you start hearing some of the same themes</p>
<p>again and again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start to develop an intuition</p>
<p>and an understanding of how these systems work in you</p>
<p>and your particular life circumstances.</p>
<p>And my goal is really to eventually become obsolete.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what my graduate advisor</p>
<p>used to call the hit by a bus principle.</p>
<p>She had a somewhat morbid sense of humor</p>
<p>and used to be, well, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow,</p>
<p>what are you going to do without me blabbing at you here?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to get hit by a bus.</p>
<p>I plan on living a very long time</p>
<p>if I have anything to say about it.</p>
<p>But were I to get hit by a bus tomorrow,</p>
<p>what would you do for your sleep and wakefulness, right?</p>
<p>You could put a comment on YouTube, which I hope you&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p>But if I were hit by a bus and killed,</p>
<p>then I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to answer your question.</p>
<p>So know your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>Understand light in the early part of the day is valuable.</p>
<p>Light when you want to be awake,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not so bright, it&rsquo;s damaging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for you whether or not it comes from screens</p>
<p>or sunlight, but sunlight&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>Avoid light in the four to six hours</p>
<p>before your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>or else you&rsquo;re going to delay your clock</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re traveling and that&rsquo;s what you want to do.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Use temperature, increase temperature to shift your clock.</p>
<p>Decrease temperature to delay your clock.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Map out your temperature and understand it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know degree by degree across the day.</p>
<p>Know your minimum, know your maximum temperature</p>
<p>in your 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>and you will feel great power through that</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;ll know also about these ultradian cycles,</p>
<p>these 90-minute cycles within which you can do focused work.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect the focus to come early.</p>
<p>Expect the focus to come in the middle</p>
<p>and then kind of taper off.</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about kids,</p>
<p>a little bit about elderly, about parenting.</p>
<p>We are going to continue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be more.</p>
<p>But now shift workers, travelers,</p>
<p>people that are jet lagging themselves at home,</p>
<p>you now have levers in place.</p>
<p>Information can be powerful,</p>
<p>but you have to implement it in ways,</p>
<p>obviously safe ways and reasonable ways.</p>
<p>But implementing this knowledge</p>
<p>in the ways that you trust are safe and reasonable for you</p>
<p>is going to be the way that you can develop</p>
<p>a bit of a laboratory about yourself.</p>
<p>I loathe the term biohacking.</p>
<p>Sorry, biohackers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in hacking anything.</p>
<p>I believe in understanding mechanism</p>
<p>and applying the principles of mechanism</p>
<p>for which there are large bodies</p>
<p>of quality peer-reviewed data</p>
<p>and even a whole center of mass</p>
<p>around certain biological principles,</p>
<p>like the effects of light and temperature minimums</p>
<p>that will allow you to shift your biology</p>
<p>in the ways that you want to go,</p>
<p>that will allow you to shift your psychology</p>
<p>in the ways you want to go.</p>
<p>Next podcast episode,</p>
<p>we are going to talk more about a few things.</p>
<p>First of all, we&rsquo;re going to answer more of your questions</p>
<p>because during office hours,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get to all your questions</p>
<p>from the previous episode.</p>
<p>So I do read the comments and we&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>and figuring out the most common questions.</p>
<p>We are going to get to some of the harder topics.</p>
<p>Someone came at me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always fun when somebody does this,</p>
<p>and they say, well,</p>
<p>these are just the kind of basal low-level questions.</p>
<p>What about the big stuff?</p>
<p>What about dreaming and lucid dreaming and consciousness?</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ll talk about that stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m planning to do that,</p>
<p>some of which in the next episode</p>
<p>and the following episode, maybe even.</p>
<p>But I want to give you data.</p>
<p>I want to give you things that are supported by data.</p>
<p>So I will try to speculate as little as possible</p>
<p>because this is a podcast about science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>This is not about me speculating.</p>
<p>Many people have speculated</p>
<p>about the role of sleep, dreaming, and consciousness.</p>
<p>Fascinating topics and a rather circular argument, frankly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been going on for centuries.</p>
<p>Someday we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Right now, we&rsquo;re concentrating</p>
<p>on these deep biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that make you who you are</p>
<p>and allow you to feel certain ways, good or bad,</p>
<p>allow you to function physically in certain ways,</p>
<p>good or bad, and give you more of a sense of control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my goal here.</p>
<p>Many people have quite graciously asked</p>
<p>how they can help support the podcast.</p>
<p>First of all, thank you.</p>
<p>We appreciate the question.</p>
<p>You can support the podcast</p>
<p>by subscribing to the podcast on YouTube,</p>
<p>as well as subscribing on Apple or Spotify.</p>
<p>And you can also leave us comments</p>
<p>and feedback on YouTube and at Apple.</p>
<p>That really helps.</p>
<p>We would hope the feedback would be positive,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, leave us feedback, ask questions.</p>
<p>We will use those questions</p>
<p>to create future content for the podcast.</p>
<p>As well, if you can recommend the podcast</p>
<p>to friends and family and other people</p>
<p>that you think might find the information of use,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>And check out our sponsors</p>
<p>that we mentioned at the beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really great way to help support us</p>
<p>and our ability to bring you this information.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>and you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your time and attention.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>See you next time on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>And as always, thanks for your interest in science.</p>
