    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>For today&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about the parts list</p>
<p>of the nervous system.</p>
<p>Now that might sound boring,</p>
<p>but these are the bits and pieces</p>
<p>that together make up everything</p>
<p>about your experience of life,</p>
<p>from what you think about to what you feel,</p>
<p>what you imagine, and what you accomplish</p>
<p>from the day you&rsquo;re born until the day you die.</p>
<p>That parts list is really incredible</p>
<p>because it has a history associated with it</p>
<p>that really provides a window into all sorts of things</p>
<p>like engineering, warfare, religion, and philosophy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to share with you the parts list</p>
<p>that makes up who you are</p>
<p>through the lens of some of those other aspects of life</p>
<p>and other aspects of the history of the discovery</p>
<p>of the nervous system.</p>
<p>By the end of this podcast,</p>
<p>I promise you&rsquo;re going to understand a lot more</p>
<p>about how you work and how to apply that knowledge.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a little bit of story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of discussion</p>
<p>about the people who made these particular discoveries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a little bit of technical language.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to avoid that.</p>
<p>But at the end, you&rsquo;re going to have in hand</p>
<p>what would be the equivalent</p>
<p>of an entire semester of learning</p>
<p>about the nervous system and how you work.</p>
<p>So a few important points before we get started.</p>
<p>I am not a medical doctor.</p>
<p>That means I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor.</p>
<p>So sometimes I&rsquo;ll profess things.</p>
<p>In fact, I profess a lot of things.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about some basic functioning</p>
<p>of the nervous system, parts, et cetera,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also going to talk about</p>
<p>how to apply that knowledge.</p>
<p>That said, your healthcare,</p>
<p>your wellbeing is your responsibility.</p>
<p>So anytime we talk about tools,</p>
<p>please filter it through that responsibility.</p>
<p>Talk to a healthcare professional</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to explore any new tools or practices</p>
<p>and be smart in your pursuit of these new tools.</p>
<p>I also want to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>and the other things I do on social media</p>
<p>are my personal goal of bringing</p>
<p>zero cost to consumer information to the general public.</p>
<p>It is separate from my role at Stanford University.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I really want to thank</p>
<p>the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health, even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine.</p>
<p>Many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlment.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs</p>
<p>in the sense that I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s any one substance or collection of substances</p>
<p>that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the nervous system.</p>
<p>The reason I say your nervous system and not your brain</p>
<p>is because your brain is actually just one piece</p>
<p>of this larger, more important thing, frankly,</p>
<p>that we call the nervous system.</p>
<p>The nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord</p>
<p>but also all the connections between your brain</p>
<p>and your spinal cord and the organs of your body.</p>
<p>It also includes, very importantly,</p>
<p>all the connections between your organs</p>
<p>back to your spinal cord and brain.</p>
<p>So the way to think about how you function at every level</p>
<p>from the moment you&rsquo;re born until the day you die,</p>
<p>everything you think and remember and feel and imagine</p>
<p>is that your nervous system</p>
<p>is this continuous loop of communication</p>
<p>between the brain, spinal cord, and body,</p>
<p>and body, spinal cord, and brain.</p>
<p>In fact, we really can&rsquo;t even separate them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one continuous loop.</p>
<p>You may have heard of something called a Mobius strip.</p>
<p>A Mobius strip is almost like one of these impossible</p>
<p>figures that no matter which angle you look at it from,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tell where it starts and where it ends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really how your nervous system is built.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the structure that allows you to, for instance,</p>
<p>deploy immune cells, to release cells</p>
<p>that will go kill infection</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the presence of infection.</p>
<p>Most people just think about that</p>
<p>as a function of the immune system,</p>
<p>but actually it&rsquo;s your nervous system</p>
<p>that tells organs like your spleen to release killer cells</p>
<p>that go and hunt down those bacterial and viral invaders</p>
<p>and gobble them up.</p>
<p>If you have a stomach ache, for instance,</p>
<p>sure, you feel that in your stomach,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really your nervous system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing the stomach ache,</p>
<p>the ache aspect of it is a nervous system feature.</p>
<p>So when we want to talk about experience,</p>
<p>or we want to talk about how to change the self in any way,</p>
<p>we really need to think about the nervous system first.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that the nervous system</p>
<p>governs all other biological systems of the body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also influenced by those other biological systems.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re talking about the nervous system,</p>
<p>we need to get a little specific about what we mean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just this big loop of wires.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a interesting story about that</p>
<p>because at the turn of the sort of 1800s to 1900s,</p>
<p>it actually was believed that our nervous system</p>
<p>was just one giant cell.</p>
<p>But two guys, the names aren&rsquo;t super important,</p>
<p>but in fairness to their important discovery,</p>
<p>Ramon y Cajal, a Spaniard, Camillo Golgi, an Italian guy,</p>
<p>figured out how to label or stain the nervous system</p>
<p>in a way that revealed, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually made up of trillions of these little cells,</p>
<p>nerve cells that are called neurons.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a neuron is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a nerve cell.</p>
<p>They also saw that those nerve cells</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t touching one another.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually separated by little gaps.</p>
<p>And those little gaps you may have heard of before,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called synapses.</p>
<p>Those synapses are where the chemicals from one neuron</p>
<p>are kind of spit out or vomited into.</p>
<p>And then the next nerve cell detects those chemicals</p>
<p>and then passes electricity down its length</p>
<p>to the next nerve cell and so forth.</p>
<p>So really the way to think about your body</p>
<p>and your thoughts and your mind</p>
<p>is that you are a flow of electricity, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing mystical about this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a flow of electricity</p>
<p>between these different nerve cells.</p>
<p>And depending on which nerve cells are active,</p>
<p>you might be lifting your arm or lowering your arm.</p>
<p>You might be seeing something and perceiving that it&rsquo;s red,</p>
<p>or you might be seeing something</p>
<p>and perceiving that it&rsquo;s green,</p>
<p>all depending on which nerve cells</p>
<p>are electrically active at a given moment.</p>
<p>The example of perceiving red or perceiving green</p>
<p>is a particularly good example</p>
<p>because so often our experience of the world</p>
<p>makes it seem as if these things</p>
<p>that are happening outside us</p>
<p>are actually happening inside us.</p>
<p>But the language of the nervous system is just electricity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a Morse code of some sort</p>
<p>where the syllables and words and consonants</p>
<p>and vowels of language,</p>
<p>it just depends on how they&rsquo;re assembled, what order.</p>
<p>And so that brings us to the issue</p>
<p>of how the nervous system works.</p>
<p>The way to think about how the nervous system works</p>
<p>is that our experiences, our memories, everything</p>
<p>is sort of like the keys on a piano</p>
<p>being played in a particular order, right?</p>
<p>If I play the keys on a piano in a particular order</p>
<p>and with a particular intensity, that&rsquo;s a given song.</p>
<p>We can make that analogous to a given experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really that the key, you know,</p>
<p>A sharp or E flat is the song,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one component of the song.</p>
<p>So when you hear that, you know, for instance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a brain area called the hippocampus,</p>
<p>which there is, that&rsquo;s involved in memory.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s involved in memory,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that memories are stored there as sentences,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re stored there as patterns of electricity and neurons</p>
<p>that when repeated give you the sense</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re experiencing the thing again.</p>
<p>In fact, deja vu, the sense that what you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>is so familiar and like something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve experienced previously</p>
<p>is merely that the neurons that were active</p>
<p>in one circumstance are now becoming active</p>
<p>in the same circumstance again.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really just like hearing the same song,</p>
<p>maybe not played on a piano,</p>
<p>but next time on a classical guitar,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something similar about that song,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s being played on two different instruments.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s important that people understand</p>
<p>the parts of their nervous system</p>
<p>and that it includes so much more than just the brain</p>
<p>and that there are these things, neurons and synapses,</p>
<p>but really that it&rsquo;s the electrical activity</p>
<p>of these neurons that dictates our experience.</p>
<p>So if the early 1900s</p>
<p>were when these neurons were discovered,</p>
<p>certainly a lot has happened since then.</p>
<p>And in that time between the early 1900s and now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some important events</p>
<p>that actually happened in history</p>
<p>that give us insight or gave us insight</p>
<p>into how the nervous system works.</p>
<p>One of the more surprising ones was actually warfare.</p>
<p>So as most everybody knows, in warfare,</p>
<p>people get shot and people often die,</p>
<p>but many people get shot and they don&rsquo;t die.</p>
<p>And in World War I,</p>
<p>there were some changes in artillery, in bullets</p>
<p>that made for a situation where bullets</p>
<p>would enter the body and brain at very discrete locations</p>
<p>and would go out the other side of the body or brain</p>
<p>and also make a very small hole at that exit location.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>produced a lot of naturally occurring lesions</p>
<p>of the nervous system.</p>
<p>Now you say, okay,</p>
<p>well, how does that relate to neuroscience?</p>
<p>Well, unlike previous years</p>
<p>where a lot of the artillery would create</p>
<p>these big sort of holes as the bullets</p>
<p>would blow out of the brain or body,</p>
<p>I know this is rather gruesome,</p>
<p>when the holes were very discrete,</p>
<p>they entered at one point and left at another point,</p>
<p>they would take out or destroy very discrete bits</p>
<p>of neural tissue of the nervous system.</p>
<p>So people were coming back from war</p>
<p>with holes in their brain</p>
<p>and in other parts of their nervous system</p>
<p>that were limited to very specific locations.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>there was some advancement</p>
<p>in the cleaning of wounds that happened.</p>
<p>So many more people were surviving.</p>
<p>What this meant was that neurologists</p>
<p>now had a collection of patients that would come back</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d have holes</p>
<p>in very specific locations of their brain.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d say things like,</p>
<p>well, I can recognize faces,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t recognize who those faces belong to.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a face, but I don&rsquo;t know who it belongs to.</p>
<p>And after that person eventually died,</p>
<p>the neurologist would figure out,</p>
<p>ah, I&rsquo;ve had 10 patients that all told me</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t recognize faces</p>
<p>and they all had these bullet holes</p>
<p>that went through a particular region of the brain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we know a lot</p>
<p>about how particular brain regions</p>
<p>like the hippocampus work.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the more amazing examples of this</p>
<p>where people would come back and they, for instance,</p>
<p>would speak in complete gibberish,</p>
<p>whereas previously they could speak normally.</p>
<p>And even though they were speaking in complete gibberish,</p>
<p>they could understand language perfectly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we know that speech and language</p>
<p>are actually controlled</p>
<p>by separate portions of the nervous system.</p>
<p>And there are many examples like that.</p>
<p>People that couldn&rsquo;t recognize the faces of famous people</p>
<p>or, and that actually brings us to an interesting example.</p>
<p>In modern times, many, many years later,</p>
<p>in the early 2000s,</p>
<p>there was actually a paper</p>
<p>that was published in the journal Nature,</p>
<p>excellent journal,</p>
<p>showing that in a human being,</p>
<p>a perfectly healthy human being,</p>
<p>there was a neuron that would become active,</p>
<p>electrically active,</p>
<p>only when the person viewed the picture</p>
<p>of Jennifer Aniston, the actress.</p>
<p>So literally a neuron that represented Jennifer Aniston,</p>
<p>so-called Jennifer Aniston cells.</p>
<p>Neuroscientists know about these Jennifer Aniston cells.</p>
<p>If you can recognize Jennifer Aniston&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p>you have Jennifer Aniston neurons.</p>
<p>And presumably you also have neurons</p>
<p>that can recognize the faces</p>
<p>of other famous and non-famous people.</p>
<p>So that indicates that our brain</p>
<p>is really a map of our experience.</p>
<p>We come into the world</p>
<p>and our brain has a kind of bias</p>
<p>towards learning particular kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ready to receive information</p>
<p>and learn that information,</p>
<p>but the brain is really a map of experience.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what experience really is.</p>
<p>What does it mean for your brain to work?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that the nervous system really does five things, maybe six.</p>
<p>The first one is sensation.</p>
<p>So this is important to understand</p>
<p>for any and all of you</p>
<p>that want to change your nervous system</p>
<p>or to apply tools to make your nervous system work better.</p>
<p>Sensation is a non-negotiable element</p>
<p>of your nervous system.</p>
<p>You have neurons in your eye</p>
<p>that perceive certain colors of light</p>
<p>and certain directions of movement.</p>
<p>You have neurons in your skin</p>
<p>that perceive particular kinds of touch,</p>
<p>like light touch or firm touch or painful touch.</p>
<p>You have neurons in your ears that perceive certain sounds.</p>
<p>Your entire experience of life</p>
<p>is filtered by these, what we call sensory receptors,</p>
<p>if you want to know what the name is.</p>
<p>So this always raises an interesting question.</p>
<p>People ask, well, is there much more out there?</p>
<p>Is there a lot more happening in the world</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not experiencing or that humans aren&rsquo;t experiencing?</p>
<p>And the answer, of course, is yes.</p>
<p>There are many species on this planet</p>
<p>that are perceiving things that we will never perceive</p>
<p>unless we apply technology.</p>
<p>Best example I could think of off the top of my head</p>
<p>would be something like infrared vision.</p>
<p>There are snakes out there, pit vipers and so forth,</p>
<p>that can sense heat emissions from other animals.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually see their shape.</p>
<p>They sense their heat shape and their heat emissions.</p>
<p>Humans can&rsquo;t do that unless, of course,</p>
<p>they put on infrared goggles or something</p>
<p>that would allow them to detect those heat emissions.</p>
<p>There are turtles and certain species of birds</p>
<p>that migrate long distances</p>
<p>that can detect magnetic fields because they have neurons.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s the nervous system that allows them to do this.</p>
<p>So they have neurons in their nose and in their head</p>
<p>that allow them to migrate along magnetic fields</p>
<p>in order to, as amazing as this sounds,</p>
<p>go from one particular location in the ocean,</p>
<p>thousands of miles away,</p>
<p>to all aggregate on one particular beach</p>
<p>at a particular time of year</p>
<p>so that they can mate, lay eggs,</p>
<p>and then wander back off into the sea to die.</p>
<p>And then their young will eventually hatch.</p>
<p>Those little cute little turtles will shuffle to the ocean,</p>
<p>swim off, and go do the exact same thing.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t migrate that distance by vision.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do it by smell.</p>
<p>They do it by sensing magnetic fields, okay?</p>
<p>And many other species do these incredible things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, humans are not magnetic sensing organisms.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do that because we don&rsquo;t have receptors</p>
<p>that sense magnetic fields.</p>
<p>There are some data that maybe some humans</p>
<p>can sense magnetic fields,</p>
<p>but you should be very skeptical of anyone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s convinced that they can do that</p>
<p>with any degree of robustness or accuracy</p>
<p>because even the people that can do this</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t necessarily aware that they can.</p>
<p>Maybe a topic for a future podcast.</p>
<p>So we have sensation.</p>
<p>Then we have perception.</p>
<p>Perception is our ability to take what we&rsquo;re sensing</p>
<p>and focus on it and make sense of it,</p>
<p>to explore it, to remember it.</p>
<p>So really perceptions are just whichever sensations</p>
<p>we happen to be paying attention to at any moment.</p>
<p>And you can do this right now.</p>
<p>You can experience perception</p>
<p>and the difference between perception</p>
<p>and sensation very easily.</p>
<p>If, for instance, I tell you to pay attention</p>
<p>to the contact of your feet, the bottoms of your feet</p>
<p>with whatever surface they happen to be in contact with,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s shoes, maybe it&rsquo;s the floor.</p>
<p>If your feet are up, maybe it&rsquo;s air.</p>
<p>The moment you place your,</p>
<p>what we call the spotlight of attention</p>
<p>or the spotlight of perception on your feet,</p>
<p>you are now perceiving what was happening there,</p>
<p>what was being sensed there.</p>
<p>The sensation was happening all along, however.</p>
<p>So while sensation is not negotiable,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t change your receptors</p>
<p>unless you adopt some new technology.</p>
<p>Perception is under the control of your attention.</p>
<p>And the way to think about attention</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s like a spotlight, except it&rsquo;s not one spotlight.</p>
<p>You actually have two attentional spotlights.</p>
<p>Anyone that tells you you can&rsquo;t multitask,</p>
<p>tell them they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And if they disagree with you, tell them to contact me.</p>
<p>Because in old world primates, of which humans are,</p>
<p>we are able to do what&rsquo;s called covert attention.</p>
<p>We can place a spotlight of attention on something,</p>
<p>for instance, something we&rsquo;re reading or looking at</p>
<p>or someone that we&rsquo;re listening to.</p>
<p>And we can place a second spotlight of attention</p>
<p>on something we&rsquo;re eating and how it tastes</p>
<p>or our child running around in the room</p>
<p>or my dog.</p>
<p>You can split your attention into two locations,</p>
<p>but of course you can also bring your attention,</p>
<p>that is your perception, to one particular location.</p>
<p>You can dilate your attention,</p>
<p>kind of like making a spotlight more diffuse,</p>
<p>or you can make it more concentrated.</p>
<p>This is very important to understand</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to think about tools</p>
<p>to improve your nervous system,</p>
<p>whether or not that tool is in the form of a chemical</p>
<p>that you decide to take,</p>
<p>maybe a supplement to increase some chemical in your brain.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s your choice, or a brain machine device,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to try and learn something better</p>
<p>by engaging in some focus or motivated pursuit</p>
<p>for some period of time each day.</p>
<p>Attention is something that is absolutely</p>
<p>under your control, in particular, when you&rsquo;re rested.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get back to this.</p>
<p>But when you are rested,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll define rest very clearly,</p>
<p>you are able to direct your attention</p>
<p>in very deliberate ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we have something in our nervous system</p>
<p>which is sort of like a two-way street.</p>
<p>And that two-way street is a communication</p>
<p>between the aspects of our nervous system</p>
<p>that are reflexive,</p>
<p>and the aspects of our nervous system that are deliberate.</p>
<p>So we all know what it&rsquo;s like to be reflexive.</p>
<p>You go through life, you&rsquo;re walking.</p>
<p>If you already know how to walk,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think about your walking, you just walk.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the nervous system wants to pass off</p>
<p>as much as it can to reflexive action.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called a bottom-up processing.</p>
<p>It really just means that information is flowing</p>
<p>in through your senses,</p>
<p>regardless of what you&rsquo;re perceiving,</p>
<p>that information is flowing up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s directing your activity.</p>
<p>But at any moment, for instance,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a car screeches in front of you around the corner</p>
<p>and you suddenly pause,</p>
<p>you are now moving into deliberate action.</p>
<p>You would start looking around in a very deliberate way.</p>
<p>The nervous system can be reflexive in its action,</p>
<p>or it can be deliberate.</p>
<p>If reflexive action tends to be what we call bottom-up,</p>
<p>deliberate action and deliberate perceptions</p>
<p>and deliberate thoughts are top-down.</p>
<p>They require some effort and some focus,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>You can decide to focus your attention and energy</p>
<p>on anything you want.</p>
<p>You can decide to focus your behavior in any way you want,</p>
<p>but it will always feel like it requires some effort</p>
<p>and some strain.</p>
<p>Whereas when you&rsquo;re in reflexive mode,</p>
<p>just walking and talking and eating and doing your thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to feel very easy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because your nervous system basically wired up</p>
<p>to be able to do most things easily</p>
<p>without much metabolic demand,</p>
<p>without consuming much energy.</p>
<p>But the moment you try and do something very specific,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel a sort of mental friction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be challenging.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got sensations, perceptions,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ve got things that we call feelings</p>
<p>slash emotions.</p>
<p>And these get a little complicated</p>
<p>because almost all of us,</p>
<p>I would hope all of us are familiar with things</p>
<p>like happiness and sadness or boredom or frustration.</p>
<p>Scientists argue like crazy,</p>
<p>neuroscientists and psychologists and philosophers</p>
<p>for that matter,</p>
<p>argue like crazy about what these are and how they work.</p>
<p>Certainly emotions and feelings</p>
<p>are the product of the nervous system.</p>
<p>They involve the activity of neurons.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned earlier, neurons are electrically active,</p>
<p>but they also release chemicals.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain category of chemicals</p>
<p>that has a very profound influence on our emotional states.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called neuromodulators.</p>
<p>And those neuromodulators have names</p>
<p>that probably you&rsquo;ve heard of before,</p>
<p>things like dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>and acetylcholine, epinephrine.</p>
<p>Neuromodulators are really interesting</p>
<p>because they bias which neurons are likely to be active</p>
<p>and which ones are likely to be inactive.</p>
<p>A simple way to think about neuromodulators</p>
<p>is they are sort of like playlists</p>
<p>that you would have on any kind of device</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to play particular categories of music.</p>
<p>So for instance, dopamine,</p>
<p>which is often discussed as the molecule of reward or joy,</p>
<p>is involved in reward.</p>
<p>And it does tend to create a sort of a upbeat mood</p>
<p>when released in appropriate amounts in the brain.</p>
<p>But the reason it does that</p>
<p>is because it makes certain neurons</p>
<p>and neural circuits, as we call them,</p>
<p>more active and others less active, okay?</p>
<p>So serotonin, for instance,</p>
<p>is a molecule that when released</p>
<p>tends to make us feel really good</p>
<p>with what we have, our sort of internal landscape</p>
<p>and the resources that we have.</p>
<p>Whereas dopamine, more than being a molecule of reward,</p>
<p>is really more a molecule of motivation</p>
<p>toward things that are outside us</p>
<p>and that we want to pursue.</p>
<p>And we can look at healthy conditions or situations</p>
<p>like being in pursuit of a goal</p>
<p>where every time we accomplish something</p>
<p>en route to that goal,</p>
<p>a little bit of dopamine is released</p>
<p>and we feel more motivation, that happens.</p>
<p>We can also look at the extreme example</p>
<p>of something like mania,</p>
<p>where somebody is so relentlessly in pursuit</p>
<p>of external things like money and relationships</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re sort of in this delusional state</p>
<p>of thinking that they have the resources that they need</p>
<p>in order to pursue all these things</p>
<p>when in fact they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So these neuromodulators can exist in normal levels,</p>
<p>low levels, high levels,</p>
<p>and that actually gives us a window</p>
<p>into a very important aspect of neuroscience history</p>
<p>that all of us are impacted by today,</p>
<p>which is the discovery of antidepressants</p>
<p>and so-called antipsychotics.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s,</p>
<p>it was discovered that there are compounds, chemicals,</p>
<p>that can increase or decrease serotonin,</p>
<p>that can increase or decrease dopamine.</p>
<p>And that led to the development</p>
<p>of most of what we call antidepressants.</p>
<p>Now, the trick here or the problem</p>
<p>is that most of these drugs,</p>
<p>especially in the 1950s and 60s,</p>
<p>they would reduce serotonin,</p>
<p>but they would also reduce dopamine,</p>
<p>or they would increase serotonin,</p>
<p>but they would also increase</p>
<p>some other neuromodulator or chemical.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because all these chemical systems in the body,</p>
<p>but the neuromodulators in particular</p>
<p>have a lot of receptors.</p>
<p>Now, these are different than the receptors</p>
<p>we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>The receptors I&rsquo;m talking about now</p>
<p>are sort of like parking spots where dopamine is released,</p>
<p>and if it attaches to a receptor, say, on the heart,</p>
<p>it might make the heart beat faster</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a certain kind of receptor on the heart,</p>
<p>whereas if dopamine is released</p>
<p>and goes and attaches to muscle,</p>
<p>it might have a completely different effect on muscle,</p>
<p>and in fact, it does.</p>
<p>So different receptors on different organs of the body</p>
<p>are the ways that these neuromodulators</p>
<p>can have all these different effects</p>
<p>on different aspects of our biology.</p>
<p>This is most salient in the example</p>
<p>of some of the antidepressants that have sexual side effects</p>
<p>or that blunt appetite or that blunt motivation.</p>
<p>Many of these, which increase serotonin,</p>
<p>can be very beneficial for people.</p>
<p>It can elevate their mood, it can make them feel better,</p>
<p>but they also, if the doses are too high</p>
<p>or if that particular drug isn&rsquo;t right for somebody,</p>
<p>that person experiences challenges with motivation</p>
<p>or appetite or libido because serotonin</p>
<p>is binding to receptors in the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that control those other things as well.</p>
<p>So we talked about sensation, we talked about perception.</p>
<p>When we talk about feelings,</p>
<p>we have to consider these neuromodulators,</p>
<p>and we have to consider also that feelings and emotions</p>
<p>are contextual.</p>
<p>In some cultures, showing a lot of joy</p>
<p>or a lot of sadness is entirely appropriate.</p>
<p>In other cultures, it&rsquo;s considered inappropriate.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a sadness circuit or area of the brain</p>
<p>or a happiness circuit or area of the brain.</p>
<p>However, it is fair to say that certain chemicals</p>
<p>and certain brain circuits tend to be active</p>
<p>when we are in motivated states,</p>
<p>tend to be active when we are in non-motivated, lazy states,</p>
<p>tend to be active when we are focused</p>
<p>and tend to be active when we are not focused.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize also that emotions</p>
<p>are something that we generally feel</p>
<p>are not under our control.</p>
<p>We feel like they kind of geyser up within us</p>
<p>and they just kind of happen to us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because they are somewhat reflexive.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really set out with a deliberate thought</p>
<p>to be happy or deliberate thought to be sad.</p>
<p>We tend to experience them</p>
<p>in kind of a passive reflexive way.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the next thing, which are thoughts.</p>
<p>Thoughts are really interesting</p>
<p>because in many ways they&rsquo;re like perceptions,</p>
<p>except that they draw on</p>
<p>not just what&rsquo;s happening in the present,</p>
<p>but also things we remember from the past</p>
<p>and things that we anticipate about the future.</p>
<p>The other thing about thoughts that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>is that thoughts can be both reflexive,</p>
<p>they can just be occurring all the time,</p>
<p>sort of like pop-up windows</p>
<p>on a poorly filtered web browser,</p>
<p>or they can be deliberate.</p>
<p>We can decide to have a thought.</p>
<p>In fact, right now you could decide to have a thought</p>
<p>just like you would decide to write something out</p>
<p>on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>You could decide that you&rsquo;re listening to a podcast,</p>
<p>that you are in a particular location.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just paying attention to what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re directing your thought process.</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>or at least appreciate that the thought patterns</p>
<p>and the neural circuits that underlie thoughts</p>
<p>can actually be controlled in this deliberate way.</p>
<p>And then finally, there are actions.</p>
<p>Actions or behaviors are perhaps the most important aspect</p>
<p>to our nervous system,</p>
<p>because first of all,</p>
<p>our behaviors are actually the only thing</p>
<p>that are going to create any fossil record of our existence.</p>
<p>After we die, the nervous system deteriorates,</p>
<p>our skeleton will remain,</p>
<p>but in the moment of experiencing something very joyful</p>
<p>or something very sad,</p>
<p>it can feel so all-encompassing</p>
<p>that we actually think that it has some meaning</p>
<p>beyond that moment.</p>
<p>But actually for humans, and I think for all species,</p>
<p>the sensations, the perceptions, and the thoughts,</p>
<p>and the feelings that we have in our lifespan,</p>
<p>none of that is actually carried forward</p>
<p>except the ones that we take and we convert</p>
<p>into actions such as writing, actions such as words,</p>
<p>actions such as engineering new things.</p>
<p>And so the fossil record of our species</p>
<p>and of each one of us is really through action.</p>
<p>And that in part is why so much of our nervous system</p>
<p>is devoted to converting sensation, perceptions, feelings,</p>
<p>and thoughts into actions.</p>
<p>In fact, the great neuroscientist or physiologist,</p>
<p>Sherrington, won a Nobel Prize for his work</p>
<p>in mapping some of the circuitry,</p>
<p>the connections between nerve cells</p>
<p>that give rise to movement.</p>
<p>And he said, movement is the final common pathway.</p>
<p>The other way to think about it</p>
<p>is that one of the reasons that our central nervous system,</p>
<p>our brain and spinal cord, include this stuff in our skull,</p>
<p>but also connect so heavily to the body</p>
<p>is because most everything that we experience,</p>
<p>including our thoughts and feelings,</p>
<p>was really designed to either impact our behavior or not.</p>
<p>And the fact that thoughts allow us to reach into the past</p>
<p>and anticipate the future,</p>
<p>and not just experience what&rsquo;s happening in the moment,</p>
<p>gave rise to an incredible capacity</p>
<p>for us to engage in behaviors</p>
<p>that are not just for the moment.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re based on things that we know from the past</p>
<p>and that we would like to see in the future.</p>
<p>And this aspect to our nervous system of creating movement</p>
<p>occurs through some very simple pathways.</p>
<p>The reflexive pathway basically includes areas</p>
<p>of the brainstem we call central pattern generators.</p>
<p>When you walk, provided you already know how to walk,</p>
<p>you are basically walking</p>
<p>because you have these central pattern generators,</p>
<p>groups of neurons that generate right foot, left foot,</p>
<p>right foot, left foot kind of movement.</p>
<p>However, when you decide to move</p>
<p>in a particular deliberate way</p>
<p>that requires a little more attention,</p>
<p>you start to engage areas of your brain</p>
<p>for top-down processing,</p>
<p>where your forebrain works from the top down</p>
<p>to control those central pattern generators</p>
<p>so that maybe it&rsquo;s right foot, right foot, left foot,</p>
<p>right foot, right foot, left foot,</p>
<p>if maybe you&rsquo;re hiking along some rocks</p>
<p>or something and you have to engage in that kind of movement.</p>
<p>So movement is just like thoughts,</p>
<p>can be either reflexive or deliberate.</p>
<p>And when we talk about deliberate,</p>
<p>I want to be very specific about how your brain works</p>
<p>in a deliberate way because it gives rise</p>
<p>to a very important feature of the nervous system</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about next,</p>
<p>which is your ability to change your nervous system.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;d like to center on for a second</p>
<p>is this notion of what does it mean</p>
<p>for the nervous system to do something deliberately?</p>
<p>Well, when you do something deliberately, you pay attention,</p>
<p>you are bringing your perception</p>
<p>to an analysis of three things,</p>
<p>duration, how long something is going to take</p>
<p>or should be done,</p>
<p>path, what you should be doing,</p>
<p>and outcome, if you do something</p>
<p>for a given length of time, what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Now, when you&rsquo;re walking down the street or you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just talking reflexively,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing this, what I call DPO,</p>
<p>duration, path, outcome, type of deliberate function</p>
<p>in your brain and nervous system.</p>
<p>But the moment you decide to learn something</p>
<p>or to resist speaking or to speak up</p>
<p>when you would rather be quiet,</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re deliberately kind of forcing yourself</p>
<p>over a threshold, you&rsquo;re engaging these brain circuits</p>
<p>and these nervous system circuits</p>
<p>that suddenly make it feel as if something is challenging,</p>
<p>something has changed.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s changed?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s changed is that when you engage</p>
<p>in this duration, path, and outcome type of thinking</p>
<p>or behavior or way of being,</p>
<p>you start to recruit these neuromodulators</p>
<p>that are released from particular areas of your brain</p>
<p>and also it turns out from your body,</p>
<p>and they start cueing to your nervous system,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s different now about what I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s different about what I&rsquo;m feeling.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give an example where perhaps somebody says something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s triggering to you, you don&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>and you know you shouldn&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>You feel like, oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t respond,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t respond, I shouldn&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actively suppressing your behavior</p>
<p>through top-down processing.</p>
<p>Your forebrain is actually preventing you</p>
<p>from saying the thing that you know you shouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>or that maybe you should wait to say</p>
<p>or say in a different form.</p>
<p>This feels like agitation and stress</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re actually suppressing a circuit.</p>
<p>We actually can see examples of what happens</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not doing this well.</p>
<p>Some of the examples come from children.</p>
<p>If you look at young children,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the forebrain circuitry</p>
<p>to engage in this top-down processing</p>
<p>until they reach age 22, even 25.</p>
<p>But in young children, you see this in a really robust way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see they&rsquo;ll be rocking back and forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for them to sit still</p>
<p>because those central pattern generators</p>
<p>are constantly going in the background</p>
<p>whereas adults can sit still.</p>
<p>A kid sees a piece of candy that it wants</p>
<p>and will just reach out and grab it</p>
<p>whereas an adult probably would ask</p>
<p>if they could have a piece</p>
<p>or wait until they were offered a piece in most cases.</p>
<p>People that have damage to the certain areas</p>
<p>of the frontal lobes don&rsquo;t have this kind of restriction.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just blurt things out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just say things.</p>
<p>We all know people like this.</p>
<p>Impulsivity is a lack of top-down control,</p>
<p>a lack of top-down processing.</p>
<p>The other thing that will turn off the forebrain</p>
<p>and make it harder to top-down processing</p>
<p>is a couple of drinks containing alcohol.</p>
<p>The removal of inhibition</p>
<p>is actually a removal of neural inhibition</p>
<p>of nerve cells suppressing the activity</p>
<p>of other nerve cells.</p>
<p>And so when you look at people</p>
<p>that have damage to their frontal lobes</p>
<p>or you look at puppies or you look at young children,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s a stimulus.</p>
<p>Everything is a potential interaction for them</p>
<p>and they have a very hard time</p>
<p>restricting their behavior and their speech.</p>
<p>So a lot of the motor system</p>
<p>is designed to just work in a reflexive way.</p>
<p>And then when we decide we want to learn something</p>
<p>or do something or not do something,</p>
<p>we have to engage in this top-down restriction</p>
<p>and it feels like agitation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s accompanied by the release</p>
<p>of a neuromodulator called norepinephrine,</p>
<p>which in the body we call adrenaline</p>
<p>and it actually makes us feel agitated.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are trying to learn something new</p>
<p>or to learn to suppress your responses</p>
<p>or be more deliberate and careful in your responses,</p>
<p>that is going to feel challenging for a particular reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to feel challenging</p>
<p>because the chemicals in your body</p>
<p>that are released in association with that effort</p>
<p>are designed to make you feel kind of agitated.</p>
<p>That low-level tremor that sometimes people feel</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re really, really angry</p>
<p>is actually a chemically induced low-level tremor.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the, what I call limbic friction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an area of your brain that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in our more primitive reflexive responses</p>
<p>called the limbic system.</p>
<p>And the frontal cortex is in a friction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a tug-of-war with that system all the time,</p>
<p>unless of course you have damage to the frontal lobe</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve had too much to drink or something,</p>
<p>in which case you tend to just say and do whatever.</p>
<p>And so this is really important to understand</p>
<p>because if you want to understand neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>you want to understand how to shape your behavior,</p>
<p>how to shape your thinking,</p>
<p>how to change how you&rsquo;re able to perform in any context.</p>
<p>The most important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that it requires top-down processing.</p>
<p>It requires this feeling of agitation.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say that agitation and strain</p>
<p>is the entry point to neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at what neuroplasticity is.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore it not as the way it&rsquo;s normally talked about</p>
<p>in modern cultures.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity, plasticity is great.</p>
<p>What exactly do people mean?</p>
<p>Plasticity itself is just a process</p>
<p>by which neurons can change their connections</p>
<p>in the way they work,</p>
<p>so that you can go from things</p>
<p>being very challenging and deliberate,</p>
<p>requiring a lot of effort and strain</p>
<p>to them being reflexive.</p>
<p>And typically when we hear about plasticity,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re thinking about positive</p>
<p>or what I call adaptive plasticity.</p>
<p>A lot of plasticity can be induced,</p>
<p>for instance, by brain damage,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s generally not the kind of plasticity</p>
<p>that we want.</p>
<p>So when I say plasticity, unless I say otherwise,</p>
<p>I mean adaptive plasticity.</p>
<p>And in particular, most of the neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that people want is self-directed plasticity</p>
<p>because if there&rsquo;s one truism to neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that from birth until about age 25,</p>
<p>the brain is incredibly plastic.</p>
<p>Kids are learning all sorts of things,</p>
<p>but they can learn it passively.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to work too hard or focus too hard,</p>
<p>although focus helps, to learn new things,</p>
<p>acquire new languages, acquire new skills.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re an adult</p>
<p>and you want to change your neural circuitry</p>
<p>at the level of emotions or behavior or thoughts</p>
<p>or anything really,</p>
<p>you absolutely need to ask two important questions.</p>
<p>One, what particular aspect of my nervous system</p>
<p>am I trying to change?</p>
<p>Meaning, am I trying to change my emotions</p>
<p>or my perceptions, my sensations,</p>
<p>and which ones are available for me to change?</p>
<p>And then the second question is,</p>
<p>how are you going to go about that?</p>
<p>What is the structure of a regimen</p>
<p>to engage neuroplasticity?</p>
<p>And it turns out that the answer to that second question</p>
<p>is governed by how awake or how sleepy we are.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about that next.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the ability for these connections</p>
<p>in the brain and body to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so incredible</p>
<p>about the human nervous system in particular</p>
<p>is that we can direct our own neural changes.</p>
<p>We can decide that we want to change our brain.</p>
<p>In other words, our brain can change itself</p>
<p>and our nervous system can change itself.</p>
<p>And the same can&rsquo;t be said for other organs of the body.</p>
<p>Even though our other organs of the body</p>
<p>have some ability to change, they can&rsquo;t direct it.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t think and decide,</p>
<p>oh, you know, your gut doesn&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, I want to be able</p>
<p>to digest spicy foods better.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to rearrange the connections</p>
<p>to be able to do that.</p>
<p>Whereas your brain can decide</p>
<p>that you want to learn a language</p>
<p>or you want to be less emotionally reactive</p>
<p>or more emotionally engaged.</p>
<p>And you can undergo a series of steps</p>
<p>that will allow your brain to make those changes</p>
<p>so that eventually it becomes reflexive</p>
<p>for you to do that, which is absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>For a long time, it was thought that neuroplasticity</p>
<p>was the unique gift of young animals and humans,</p>
<p>that it could only occur when we&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>And in fact, the young brain is incredibly plastic.</p>
<p>Children can learn three languages</p>
<p>without an accent reflexively,</p>
<p>whereas adults, it&rsquo;s very challenging.</p>
<p>It takes a lot more effort and strain,</p>
<p>a lot more of that duration path outcome</p>
<p>kind of thinking in order to achieve those plastic changes.</p>
<p>We now know, however, that the adult brain can change</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>Nobel prizes were given for the understanding</p>
<p>that the young brain can change very dramatically.</p>
<p>I think one of the most extreme examples would be</p>
<p>for people that are born blind from birth,</p>
<p>they use the area of their brain</p>
<p>that normally would be used for visualizing objects</p>
<p>and colors and things outside of them for braille reading.</p>
<p>In brain imaging studies, it&rsquo;s been shown that,</p>
<p>people who are blind from birth, when they braille read,</p>
<p>the area of the brain that would normally light up,</p>
<p>if you will, for vision, lights up for braille reading.</p>
<p>So that real estate is reallocated</p>
<p>for an entirely different function.</p>
<p>If someone is made blind in adulthood,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlikely that their entire visual brain</p>
<p>will be taken over by the areas of the brain</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re responsible for touch.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s some evidence that areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in hearing and touch</p>
<p>can kind of migrate into that area.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of interest now in trying to figure out</p>
<p>how more plasticity can be induced in adulthood,</p>
<p>more positive plasticity.</p>
<p>And in order to understand that process,</p>
<p>we really have to understand something</p>
<p>that might at first seem totally divorced</p>
<p>from neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>but actually lies at the center of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And for any of you that are interested</p>
<p>in changing your nervous system,</p>
<p>so that something that you want</p>
<p>can go from being very hard or seem almost impossible</p>
<p>and out of reach to being very reflexive,</p>
<p>this is especially important to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Plasticity in the adult human nervous system is gated,</p>
<p>meaning it is controlled by neuromodulators.</p>
<p>These things that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>dopamine, serotonin, and one in particular</p>
<p>called acetylcholine are what open up plasticity.</p>
<p>They literally unveil plasticity</p>
<p>and allow brief periods of time</p>
<p>in which whatever information,</p>
<p>whatever thing we&rsquo;re sensing or perceiving or thinking,</p>
<p>or whatever emotions we feel</p>
<p>can literally be mapped in the brain</p>
<p>such that later it will become much easier</p>
<p>for us to experience and feel that thing.</p>
<p>Now, this has a dark side and a positive side.</p>
<p>The dark side is it&rsquo;s actually very easy</p>
<p>to get neuroplasticity as an adult</p>
<p>through traumatic or terrible or challenging experiences.</p>
<p>But the important question is to say, why is that?</p>
<p>And the reason that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>is because when something very bad happens,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the release of two sets of neuromodulators</p>
<p>in the brain, epinephrine,</p>
<p>which tends to make us feel alert and agitated,</p>
<p>which is associated with most bad circumstances,</p>
<p>and acetylcholine, which tends to create</p>
<p>a even more intense and focused perceptual spotlight.</p>
<p>Remember earlier, we were talking about perception</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s kind of like a spotlight.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine makes that light particularly bright</p>
<p>and particularly restricted to one region of our experience.</p>
<p>And it does that by making certain neurons</p>
<p>in our brain and body active much more than all the rest.</p>
<p>So acetylcholine is sort of like a highlighter marker</p>
<p>upon which neuroplasticity then comes in later</p>
<p>and says, wait, which neurons were active</p>
<p>in this particularly alerting phase of whatever,</p>
<p>you know, day or night,</p>
<p>whenever this thing happened to happen.</p>
<p>So the way it works is this.</p>
<p>You can think of epinephrine as creating this alertness</p>
<p>and this kind of unbelievable level of increased attention</p>
<p>compared to what you were experiencing before.</p>
<p>And you can think of acetylcholine as being the molecule</p>
<p>that highlights whatever happens</p>
<p>during that period of heightened alertness.</p>
<p>So just to be clear, it&rsquo;s epinephrine creates the alertness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming from a subset of neurons in the brainstem,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
<p>And acetylcholine coming from an area of the forebrain</p>
<p>is tagging or marking the neurons</p>
<p>that are particularly active</p>
<p>during this heightened level of alertness.</p>
<p>Now that marks the cells, the neurons, and the synapses</p>
<p>for strengthening, for becoming more likely</p>
<p>to be active in the future,</p>
<p>even without us thinking about it, okay?</p>
<p>So in bad circumstances,</p>
<p>this all happens without us having to do much.</p>
<p>When we want something to happen, however,</p>
<p>we want to learn a new language,</p>
<p>we want to learn a new skill,</p>
<p>we want to become more motivated.</p>
<p>What do we know for certain?</p>
<p>We know that that process of getting neuroplasticity</p>
<p>so that we have more focus, more motivation,</p>
<p>absolutely requires the release of epinephrine.</p>
<p>We have to have alertness in order to have focus.</p>
<p>And we have to have focus</p>
<p>in order to direct those plastic changes</p>
<p>to particular parts of our nervous system.</p>
<p>Now, this has immense implications</p>
<p>in thinking about the various tools,</p>
<p>whether or not those are chemical tools or machine tools,</p>
<p>or just self-induced regimens of how long</p>
<p>or how intensely you&rsquo;re going to focus</p>
<p>in order to get neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another side to it.</p>
<p>The dirty secret of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>is that no neuroplasticity occurs</p>
<p>during the thing you&rsquo;re trying to learn,</p>
<p>during the terrible event, during the great event,</p>
<p>during the thing that you&rsquo;re really trying to shape</p>
<p>and learn, nothing is actually changing</p>
<p>between the neurons that is going to last.</p>
<p>All the neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the strengthening of the synapses,</p>
<p>the addition, in some cases, of new nerve cells,</p>
<p>or at least connections between nerve cells,</p>
<p>all of that occurs at a very different phase of life,</p>
<p>which is when we are in sleep and non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>And so neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>which is the kind of holy grail of human experience of,</p>
<p>you know, this is the new year</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s thinking New Year&rsquo;s resolutions.</p>
<p>And right now, perhaps everything&rsquo;s organized</p>
<p>and people are highly motivated,</p>
<p>but what happens in March or April or May?</p>
<p>Well, that all depends on how much attention and focus</p>
<p>one can continually bring</p>
<p>to whatever it is they&rsquo;re trying to learn,</p>
<p>so much so that agitation and a feeling of strain</p>
<p>are actually required</p>
<p>for this process of neuroplasticity to get triggered.</p>
<p>But the actual rewiring occurs</p>
<p>during periods of sleep and non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study published last year</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s particularly relevant here that I want to share,</p>
<p>it was not done by my laboratory,</p>
<p>that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest,</p>
<p>this is not deep sleep,</p>
<p>but essentially doing something very hard and very intense</p>
<p>and then taking 20 minutes afterward,</p>
<p>immediately afterwards,</p>
<p>to deliberately turn off</p>
<p>the deliberate focused thinking and engagement</p>
<p>actually accelerated neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another study that&rsquo;s just incredible,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to go into this</p>
<p>in a future episode of the podcast not too long from now,</p>
<p>that showed that if people are learning a particular skill,</p>
<p>it could be a language skill or a motor skill,</p>
<p>and they hear a tone just playing in the background,</p>
<p>the tone is playing periodically in the background</p>
<p>like just a bell,</p>
<p>in deep sleep, if that bell is played,</p>
<p>learning is much faster</p>
<p>for the thing that they were learning while they were awake.</p>
<p>It somehow cues the nervous system in sleep,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even have to be in dreaming,</p>
<p>that something that happened in the waking phase</p>
<p>was especially important,</p>
<p>so much so that that bell is sort of a Pavlovian cue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of a reminder to the sleeping brain,</p>
<p>oh, you need to remember what it is that you were learning</p>
<p>at that particular time of day,</p>
<p>and the learning rates and the rates of retention,</p>
<p>meaning how much people can remember</p>
<p>from the thing they learned,</p>
<p>are significantly higher under those conditions.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to talk about how to apply all this knowledge</p>
<p>in a little bit more in this podcast episode,</p>
<p>but also in future episodes,</p>
<p>but it really speaks to the really key importance</p>
<p>of sleep and focus,</p>
<p>these two opposite ends of our attentional state.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re in sleep, these DPOs,</p>
<p>duration, path, and outcome analysis are impossible,</p>
<p>we just can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>we are only in relation to what&rsquo;s happening inside of us.</p>
<p>So sleep is key,</p>
<p>also key are periods of non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re turning off our analysis</p>
<p>of duration, path, and outcome,</p>
<p>in particular for the thing</p>
<p>that we were just trying to learn,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in this kind of liminal state</p>
<p>where our attention is kind of drifting all over.</p>
<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s very important for the consolidation,</p>
<p>for the changes between the nerve cells</p>
<p>that will allow what we were trying to learn</p>
<p>to go from being deliberate and hard and stressful</p>
<p>and a strain to easy and reflexive.</p>
<p>This also points to how different people,</p>
<p>including many modern clinicians,</p>
<p>are thinking about how to prevent bad circumstances,</p>
<p>traumas from routing their way</p>
<p>into our nervous system permanently.</p>
<p>It says that you might want to interfere</p>
<p>with certain aspects of brain states</p>
<p>that are away from the bad thing that happened,</p>
<p>the brain states that happened the next day</p>
<p>or the next month or the next year.</p>
<p>And also I want to make sure</p>
<p>that I pay attention to the fact that for many of you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>not just in changing your nervous system</p>
<p>to add something new,</p>
<p>but to also get rid of things that you don&rsquo;t like, right?</p>
<p>That you want to forget bad experiences</p>
<p>or at least remove the emotional contingency</p>
<p>of a bad relationship or a bad relationship to some thing</p>
<p>or some person or some event.</p>
<p>Learning to fear certain things less,</p>
<p>to eliminate a phobia, to erase a trauma.</p>
<p>The memories themselves don&rsquo;t get erased.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say that the memories themselves get erased,</p>
<p>but the emotional load of memories can be reduced.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different ways</p>
<p>that that can happen,</p>
<p>but they all require this thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re calling neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have a large number of discussions</p>
<p>about neuroplasticity in depth.</p>
<p>But the most important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that it is indeed a two-phase process.</p>
<p>What governs the transition between alert and focused</p>
<p>and these depressed and deep sleep states</p>
<p>is a system in our brain and body,</p>
<p>a certain aspect of the nervous system</p>
<p>called the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>And it is immensely important to understand</p>
<p>how this autonomic nervous system works.</p>
<p>It has names like the sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>and parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>which frankly are complicated names</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re a little bit misleading.</p>
<p>Sympathetic is the one that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with more alertness.</p>
<p>Parasympathetic is the one that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with more calmness.</p>
<p>And it gets really misleading</p>
<p>because the sympathetic nervous system sounds like sympathy</p>
<p>and then people think it&rsquo;s related to calm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to call it the alertness system</p>
<p>and the calmness system,</p>
<p>because even though sympathetic and parasympathetic</p>
<p>are sometimes used, people really get confused.</p>
<p>So the way to think about the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and the reason it&rsquo;s important for every aspect of your life,</p>
<p>but in particular for neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and engaging in these focus states</p>
<p>and then these defocus states</p>
<p>is that it works sort of like a seesaw.</p>
<p>Every 24 hours, we&rsquo;re all familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that when we wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>we might be a little bit groggy,</p>
<p>but then generally we&rsquo;re more alert.</p>
<p>And then as evening comes around,</p>
<p>we tend to become a little more relaxed and sleepy.</p>
<p>And eventually at some point at night, we go to sleep.</p>
<p>So we go from alert to deeply calm.</p>
<p>And as we do that, we go from an ability to engage</p>
<p>in these very focused duration path outcome</p>
<p>types of analyses to states in sleep</p>
<p>that are completely divorced from duration path and outcome</p>
<p>in which everything is completely random and untethered</p>
<p>in terms of our sensations, perceptions,</p>
<p>and feelings and so forth.</p>
<p>So every 24 hours, we have a phase of our day</p>
<p>that is optimal for thinking and focusing</p>
<p>and learning and neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and doing all sorts of things.</p>
<p>We have energy as well.</p>
<p>And at another phase of our day, we&rsquo;re tired</p>
<p>and we have no ability to focus.</p>
<p>We have no ability to engage</p>
<p>in duration path outcome types of analyses.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that both phases are important</p>
<p>for shaping our nervous system in the ways that we want.</p>
<p>So if we want to engage neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and we want to get the most out of our nervous system,</p>
<p>we each have to master both the transition</p>
<p>between wakefulness and sleep</p>
<p>and the transition between sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>Now, so much has been made of the importance of sleep</p>
<p>and it is critically important for wound healing,</p>
<p>for learning, as I just mentioned,</p>
<p>for consolidating learning,</p>
<p>for all aspects of our immune system.</p>
<p>It is the one period of time</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;re not doing these duration path</p>
<p>and outcomes types of analyses.</p>
<p>And it is critically important to all aspects of our health,</p>
<p>including our longevity.</p>
<p>Much less has been made, however,</p>
<p>of how to get better at sleeping,</p>
<p>how to get better at the process</p>
<p>that involves falling asleep, staying asleep,</p>
<p>and accessing the states of mind and body</p>
<p>that involve total paralysis.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re actually paralyzed during much of your sleep</p>
<p>so that you can&rsquo;t act out your dreams, presumably.</p>
<p>But also where your brain is in a total idle state</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not controlling anything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just left to kind of free run.</p>
<p>And there are certain things that we can all do</p>
<p>in order to master that transition,</p>
<p>in order to get better at sleeping.</p>
<p>And it involves much more than just how much we sleep.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all being told, of course, that we need to sleep more,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the issue of sleep quality,</p>
<p>accessing those deep states of non-DPO thinking,</p>
<p>accessing the right timing of sleep.</p>
<p>Not a lot has been discussed publicly</p>
<p>as far as I&rsquo;m aware of when to time your sleep.</p>
<p>I think we all can appreciate that</p>
<p>sleeping for half an hour throughout the day</p>
<p>so that you get a total of eight hours of sleep</p>
<p>every 24-hour cycle is probably very different</p>
<p>and not optimal compared to a solid block</p>
<p>of eight hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Although there are people that have tried this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s been written about in various books.</p>
<p>Not many people can stick to that schedule.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think it&rsquo;s called the Uberman schedule,</p>
<p>not to be confused with the Huberman schedule,</p>
<p>because first of all,</p>
<p>my schedule doesn&rsquo;t look anything like that.</p>
<p>And second of all,</p>
<p>I would never attempt such a sleeping regime.</p>
<p>The other thing that is really important to understand</p>
<p>is that we have not explored as a culture</p>
<p>the rhythms that occur in our waking states.</p>
<p>So much has been focused on the value of sleep</p>
<p>and the importance of sleep, which is great.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that most people are paying attention</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s happening in their waking states</p>
<p>and when their brain is optimized for focus,</p>
<p>when their brain is optimized for these DPOs,</p>
<p>these duration path outcome types of engagements</p>
<p>for learning and for changing,</p>
<p>and when their brain is probably better suited</p>
<p>for more reflexive thinking and behaviors.</p>
<p>And it turns out that there&rsquo;s a vast amount</p>
<p>of scientific data which points to the existence</p>
<p>of what are called ultradian rhythms.</p>
<p>You may have heard of circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Circadian means circa about a day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 24-hour rhythms</p>
<p>because the earth spins once every 24 hours.</p>
<p>Ultradian rhythms occur throughout the day</p>
<p>and they require less time, they&rsquo;re shorter.</p>
<p>The most important ultradian rhythm</p>
<p>for sake of this discussion is the 90-minute rhythm</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going through all the time</p>
<p>in our ability to attend and focus.</p>
<p>And in sleep, our sleep is broken up</p>
<p>into 90-minute segments.</p>
<p>Early in the night, we have more phase one</p>
<p>and phase two lighter sleep,</p>
<p>and then we go into our deeper phase three</p>
<p>and phase four sleep,</p>
<p>and then we return to phase one, two, three, four.</p>
<p>So all night you&rsquo;re going through these ultradian rhythms</p>
<p>of stage one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s repeating.</p>
<p>Most people perhaps know that, maybe they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but when you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>these ultradian rhythms continue.</p>
<p>And it turns out that we are optimized</p>
<p>for focus and attention within these 90-minute cycles</p>
<p>so that at the beginning of one of these 90-minute cycles,</p>
<p>maybe you sit down to learn something new</p>
<p>or to engage in some new challenging behavior.</p>
<p>For the first five or 10 minutes of one of those cycles,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s well-known that the brain and the neural circuits</p>
<p>and the neuromodulators are not going to be optimally tuned</p>
<p>to whatever it is you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>But as you drop deeper into that 90-minute cycle,</p>
<p>your ability to focus and to engage in this DPO process</p>
<p>and to direct neuroplasticity and to learn</p>
<p>is actually much greater.</p>
<p>And then you eventually pop out of that</p>
<p>at the end of the 90-minute cycle.</p>
<p>So these cycles are occurring in sleep</p>
<p>and these cycles are occurring in wakefulness.</p>
<p>And all of those are governed by this seesaw</p>
<p>of alertness to calmness</p>
<p>that we call the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>So if you want to master and control your nervous system,</p>
<p>regardless of what tool you reach to,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a pharmacologic tool</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s a behavioral tool</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s a brain machine interface tool,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s vitally important to understand</p>
<p>that your entire existence</p>
<p>is occurring in these 90-minute cycles,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re asleep or awake.</p>
<p>And so you really need to learn</p>
<p>how to wedge into those 90-minute cycles.</p>
<p>And for instance, it would be completely crazy</p>
<p>and counterproductive to try and just learn information</p>
<p>while in deep sleep by listening to that information</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not able to access it.</p>
<p>It would be perfectly good, however,</p>
<p>to engage in a focus bout of learning each day.</p>
<p>And now we know how long that focus bout</p>
<p>of learning should be.</p>
<p>It should be at least one 90-minute cycle.</p>
<p>And the expectation should be that the early phase</p>
<p>of that cycle is going to be challenging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to hurt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to feel natural.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to feel like flow,</p>
<p>but that you can learn.</p>
<p>And the circuits of your brain that are involved</p>
<p>in focus and motivation can learn to drop in</p>
<p>to a mode of more focus, get more neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>in other words, by engaging these ultradian cycles</p>
<p>at the appropriate times of day.</p>
<p>For instance, some people are very good learners</p>
<p>early in the day and not so good in the afternoon.</p>
<p>So you can start to explore this process</p>
<p>even without any information</p>
<p>about the underlying neurochemicals</p>
<p>by simply paying attention,</p>
<p>not just to when you go to sleep</p>
<p>and when you wake up each morning,</p>
<p>how deep or how shallow your sleep felt to you subjectively,</p>
<p>but also throughout the day</p>
<p>when your brain tends to be most anxious</p>
<p>because it turns out that has a correlate</p>
<p>related to perception that we will talk about.</p>
<p>You can ask yourself, when are you most focused?</p>
<p>When are you least anxious?</p>
<p>When do you feel most motivated?</p>
<p>When do you feel least motivated?</p>
<p>By understanding how the different aspects</p>
<p>of your perception, sensation, feeling, thought,</p>
<p>and actions tend to want to be engaged</p>
<p>or not want to be engaged,</p>
<p>you develop a very good window</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s going to be required</p>
<p>to shift your ability to focus</p>
<p>or shift your ability to engage in creative type thinking</p>
<p>at different times of day, should you choose.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re heading going forward.</p>
<p>It all starts with mastering this seesaw</p>
<p>that is the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that at a course level is a transition</p>
<p>between wakefulness and sleep,</p>
<p>but at a finer level and just as important</p>
<p>are the various cycles,</p>
<p>these all trading in 90 minute cycles</p>
<p>that govern our life all the time,</p>
<p>24 hours a day, every day of our life.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how you can take control of the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>so that you can better access neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>better access sleep,</p>
<p>even take advantage of the phase</p>
<p>that is the transition between sleep and waking</p>
<p>to access things like creativity and so forth,</p>
<p>all based on studies that have been published</p>
<p>over the last hundred years,</p>
<p>mainly within the last 10 years,</p>
<p>and some that are very, very new,</p>
<p>and that point to the use of specific tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to get the most</p>
<p>out of your nervous system.</p>
<p>So today we covered a lot of information.</p>
<p>It was sort of a whirlwind tour</p>
<p>of everything from neurons and synapses</p>
<p>to neuroplasticity in the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>We will revisit a lot of these themes going forward.</p>
<p>So if all of that didn&rsquo;t sink in in one pass,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>We will come back to these themes over and over again.</p>
<p>I wanted to equip you with a language</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all developing a kind of common base set</p>
<p>of information going forward.</p>
<p>And I hope the information is valuable to you</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about what is working well for you</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s working less well</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s been exceedingly challenging,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s been easy for you in terms of your pursuit</p>
<p>of particular behaviors or emotional states,</p>
<p>where your challenges or the challenges of people</p>
<p>that you know might reside.</p>
<p>As promised in our welcome video,</p>
<p>the format of the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is to dive deep into individual topics</p>
<p>for an entire month at a time.</p>
<p>So for the entire month of January,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to explore this incredible state</p>
<p>that is sleep and a related state,</p>
<p>which is non-sleep depressed.</p>
<p>And what they do for things like learning,</p>
<p>resetting our emotional capacity.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s probably familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that when we&rsquo;re sleep deprived,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so much less good at dealing with life circumstances.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more emotionally labile.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>How is that?</p>
<p>But most importantly,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about how to get better at sleeping</p>
<p>and then how to access better sleep,</p>
<p>even when your sleep timing or duration is compromised.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about the data</p>
<p>that support this very interesting state</p>
<p>called non-sleep depressed,</p>
<p>where one is neither asleep nor awake,</p>
<p>but it turns out one can recover</p>
<p>some of the neuromodulators</p>
<p>and more importantly,</p>
<p>the processes involved in sensation,</p>
<p>perception, feeling, thought, and action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sure to be a very rich discussion back and forth</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m answering your questions and providing tools.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;re also going to learn</p>
<p>a lot of information about neuroscience</p>
<p>and what makes up this incredible phase of your life</p>
<p>where you think you&rsquo;re not conscious,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re actually resetting and renewing yourself</p>
<p>in order to perform better, feel better, et cetera,</p>
<p>in the waking state.</p>
