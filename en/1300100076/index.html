<p>why like somehow or another it&rsquo;s like bad for your</p>
<p>reputation does it really take you 10 minutes to come</p>
<p>yeah because i</p>
<p>now when you</p>
<p>have regular sex is it take you ten minutes</p>
<p>no it takes you longer can i say something</p>
<p>i want to say something to you sure</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very i&rsquo;m being very specific on my porn the</p>
<p>thing is that i need the interview</p>
<p>you okay you know the interview</p>
<p>the interview the interview with the girl so far</p>

<p>point have you done not that much this is my</p>
<p>second time or first</p>
<p>and i need to</p>
<p>sense a little fear</p>
<p>inner voice</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>check it out</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>first time when they do</p>
<p>the first timers</p>
<p>when the penis goes in the vagina</p>
<p>i have to look at their eyes</p>
<p>in the eyes they have to question</p>
<p>their decision</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you get</p>
<p>excited yeah you know how like when the</p>
<p>penis goes in</p>
<p>they have to go mom</p>
<p>do you associate that with any past</p>
<p>sexual experience</p>
<p>where you see</p>
<p>the look in the girl&rsquo;s eye she&rsquo;s like what the fuck is</p>
<p>bobby lee doing inside me</p>
<p>and then you get excited like</p>
<p>trick them again josie no no no</p>
<p>i think what it is is this i think that my penis</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even an ethnic thing</p>
<p>but my penis is abnormally small</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t care about it because you know what i mean i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>rapid like how small</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just small like thumb</p>
<p>like your thumb no yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thicker than that</p>
<p>but the thing is is that and girls</p>
<p>they like my bubbly personality i&rsquo;m like a</p>
<p>dream weaver you know what i mean</p>
<p>and you know what i mean you&rsquo;re fun</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m a cute you know i tickle you know what i mean</p>
<p>i giggle fun to be around yeah i giggle</p>
<p>you bring a party yeah yeah</p>
<p>and so then all of a</p>
<p>sudden this party&rsquo;s fucking your mouth you&rsquo;re like hey</p>
<p>yeah and when i&rsquo;m with a girl i look in their eyes and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never had the sensation of like</p>
<p>them going oh you know what i mean</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s too big</p>
<p>right yeah man</p>
<p>i have a friend</p>
<p>of mine who had that same problem and so what he</p>
<p>started doing was getting</p>
<p>he got a strap on</p>
<p>he got this</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>that covers his dick</p>
<p>and i was like his dick</p>
<p>would go on and then this big fake dick</p>
<p>would go over his dick</p>
<p>and we were talking to him</p>
<p>about it we were like well what&rsquo;s up like</p>
<p>what are you doing that for</p>
<p>he goes just once i</p>
<p>wanna see a girl like</p>
<p>have a hard time taking it</p>
<p>yeah they can always</p>
<p>take it so easy yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never hurting them i never</p>
<p>think of them</p>
<p>so are you really big into anal</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t do that you think you</p>
<p>would be though because that</p>
<p>most girls even with your</p>
<p>small dick would like no</p>
<p>no no no no no because</p>
<p>for me it&rsquo;s like i want them to have pleasure too</p>
<p>some girls like it</p>
<p>i know a girl</p>
<p>that likes anal whip better than regular sex she</p>
<p>just wants anal all the time yeah yeah i know there are</p>
<p>girls and they&rsquo;re called broken yeah</p>
<p>those are the ones that also</p>
<p>light your house on fire by the way</p>
<p>but i also imagine</p>
<p>if you do an anal and you don&rsquo;t have a condom on</p>
<p>that the poop goes into the hole my hole does</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t need that in my life</p>
<p>we talked about a terrible</p>
<p>scene did we talk</p>
<p>about that on the podcast that the</p>
<p>the nani show</p>
<p>thing yeah yeah we did it i</p>
<p>think snakes are actually cool if you&rsquo;re at a point</p>
<p>when you shut up what&rsquo;s a poop snake</p>
<p>when you piss</p>
<p>after anal sex as it comes out</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t need that in my life you</p>
<p>should try it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just talking about</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been silly</p>
<p>he does this all the time you can&rsquo;t take him you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never had a poop</p>
<p>snake be honest</p>
<p>never i poop</p>
<p>smell though now this is worse</p>
<p>the girls had sex with a long time ago back when i was</p>
<p>twenty one i lost my boner because i was banging her</p>
<p>doggy style i saw poop around her butthole</p>
<p>i realized that she didn&rsquo;t really wipe that good</p>
<p>and then i started</p>
<p>smelling it because the funk of</p>
<p>the sex and the</p>
<p>sweat yeah yeah yeah and</p>
<p>my wet nappet</p>
<p>you ever do that my butt yeah yeah i wet not my butt</p>
<p>yeah baby yeah yeah</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>flush those that&rsquo;s respect</p>
<p>right you cannot flush those what</p>
<p>you got it you got to wipe yourself</p>
<p>first and then</p>
<p>you got to get the baby wipes and then you got to</p>
<p>throw the baby wipes away</p>
<p>which is kind of</p>
<p>gross because i got</p>
<p>well if you live in an</p>
<p>apartment go flush away</p>
<p>but if you live in a</p>
<p>house eventually they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get clogged up and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to have a</p>
<p>group of dudes come in your backyard</p>
<p>and find this pipe</p>
<p>stuff full of your shit</p>
<p>rags are you</p>
<p>sure you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>using that for example</p>
<p>with me no bro i&rsquo;ve used</p>
<p>flushable baby wipes</p>
<p>the flushable</p>
<p>ones they never</p>
<p>break they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing they pretend they do they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really they become like goo</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t dissolve</p>
<p>like toilet</p>
<p>paper and they</p>
<p>get tied up on</p>
<p>things like if you have</p>
<p>in my area we have issues with</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;re kind of rural we have issues with trees</p>
<p>growing into your pipes</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s an issue like</p>
<p>so many trees out here the trees will</p>
<p>grow through like a</p>
<p>crack in the pipe and then</p>
<p>one of them</p>
<p>became like a goddamn tree</p>
<p>i mean i posted</p>
<p>pictures of it on twitter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so ridiculous nobody even fucking believes it</p>
<p>my toilet was clogged</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was</p>
<p>going on with it so i had</p>
<p>these plumbers come out</p>
<p>they pulled a fucking</p>
<p>eight foot tree</p>
<p>out of my toilet oh my god</p>
<p>maybe not eight foot</p>
<p>how big was it at</p>
<p>least five feet yeah like five feet it was</p>
<p>long it was like</p>
<p>it was like your eye</p>
<p>looked like a muppet</p>
<p>it looked like a</p>
<p>muppet like a</p>
<p>swamp thing looked like some sort of an animal</p>
<p>like somebody flushed</p>
<p>some woodrat</p>
<p>but are you</p>
<p>worried that if they open up the pipe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stuff with wet</p>
<p>naps but can&rsquo;t you just say it&rsquo;s my children&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s mine i don&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>a fucking owner i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna the bus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to be the diaper wipes you</p>
<p>definitely don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>flush because they&rsquo;re really thick and</p>
<p>gross i mean not course but</p>
<p>strong that they</p>
<p>would not break up definitely</p>
<p>but flushable baby wipes those bitches don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break up either the guy told me now they say they</p>
<p>break up people say because i</p>
<p>pull them out of people&rsquo;s pipes all the time</p>
<p>so they had to like dig a hole but it was really</p>
<p>the issue more or less was that there was a route</p>
<p>that was blocking part of the area</p>
<p>not as bad as the one that was in</p>
<p>the toilet the one that was in the toilet was fucking</p>
<p>ridiculous i&rsquo;ll find it and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>repost that shit on twitter because it&rsquo;s just so silly</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t even make sense</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so silly</p>
<p>it really didn&rsquo;t look real</p>
<p>like i couldn&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>and that was</p>
<p>after i had</p>
<p>moved to colorado</p>
<p>so i left the</p>
<p>house for a couple</p>
<p>months and nobody was</p>
<p>nobody was flushing</p>
<p>yeah i just wish</p>
<p>like masturbating lasted longer for me</p>
<p>because to me it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>i seriously have to</p>
<p>focus on slowing it down why not just</p>
<p>get it done</p>
<p>what are you trying to do there</p>
<p>fella no that&rsquo;s with sex and</p>
<p>everything i just with masturbation though</p>

<p>yeah but i like to</p>
<p>enjoy it you</p>
<p>know really i mean it feels good when you&rsquo;re doing it</p>

<p>yeah well the</p>
<p>other day i was in i wasn&rsquo;t when i was in new york i</p>
<p>tried to masturbate</p>
<p>you know to the port on the internet i couldn&rsquo;t finish</p>

<p>wow man you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an unfortunate</p>
<p>thing when people</p>
<p>try to fuck around on sets and just have fun</p>
<p>you never know</p>
<p>right before you do something sometimes</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s too far</p>
<p>patrice o&rsquo;neal had a really</p>
<p>funny point once</p>
<p>where patrice was talking</p>

<p>trouble for saying something about</p>
<p>black people remember that</p>

<p>no one knows</p>
<p>exactly what the fuck they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say before they say</p>
<p>things like that and sometimes you say</p>
<p>things that are across the line</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where all</p>
<p>funny comes from</p>
<p>if it misses or it hits it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still coming from the same place</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just trying to get a</p>
<p>laugh and it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s what it is yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>people that aren&rsquo;t in</p>
<p>the comedy businessman they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>understand that in</p>
<p>order to be really funny</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really have very many</p>
<p>boundaries yeah</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re from we&rsquo;re from the like you know the</p>
<p>stores always work</p>

<p>while because they</p>
<p>would let us</p>
<p>drink on the set</p>
<p>so we would be done with the show and we</p>
<p>would get fucking hammered</p>
<p>we would get so hammered that no one knows this is</p>
<p>i because i</p>

<p>so pissed the next day they&rsquo;re blaming it on the band</p>
<p>we were like yeah that&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>those guys were fucking</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>gonna like stop</p>
<p>drinking on the set because of it</p>
<p>andy would get smashed</p>
<p>andy and andy</p>
<p>would bring the shady fucking characters over</p>
<p>just be strange</p>
<p>smells coming out of this fucking</p>
<p>dressing room</p>
<p>it was just a fun fun set man</p>
<p>this is the thing</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>real good comedy</p>
<p>unless you get the type of people that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that many</p>
<p>boundaries people</p>
<p>that will go out there</p>
<p>people that have pulled</p>
<p>their fucking</p>
<p>pants down like all my friends at</p>
<p>their comics that pull</p>
<p>their pants down</p>
<p>they do stupid shit they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>say i dare you to go do this like they&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>gonna do if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny yeah yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen like nine ten</p>
<p>comics penises over the last weak</p>
<p>like kristalia&rsquo;s polys i&rsquo;ve seen polly</p>
<p>shorts penis</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even</p>
<p>lying eight hundred</p>
<p>and thirty two times</p>
<p>over a lifetime</p>
<p>you know i mean and it&rsquo;s just i didn&rsquo;t ask</p>
<p>the crystal</p>
<p>is penis look like our</p>
<p>magicals penis</p>
<p>by the way is very large</p>
<p>okay yeah yeah anyway</p>
<p>but but they don&rsquo;t people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how magical</p>
<p>wise man with magicals penis</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s pretty large to i guess no i don&rsquo;t think it is</p>
<p>possible that i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>magical has a big dick yeah it&rsquo;s impossible really</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a hispanic</p>
<p>what are you talking</p>
<p>about hispanics don&rsquo;t have little dicks</p>
<p>they go huge monster dicks mexicans you blowing</p>
<p>no no mexican</p>
<p>blowing any mexican what are you talking about</p>
<p>they have big penises</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not the ones but not that the</p>
<p>black big penis people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like black people they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>but neither are like</p>
<p>irish well irish people are supposedly small penises</p>
<p>no they have</p>
<p>thick penis</p>
<p>irish cursive to me</p>
<p>the only difference between a mexican guy and asian guy</p>
<p>except for culturally but physically i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>is the eyes</p>
<p>what yeah the eyes you you</p>
<p>if you take a mexican guy you get him really high</p>
<p>right fucking from okinawa</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right hmm</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re more well they are</p>
<p>asian really because what what</p>
<p>american indians are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s people that came down from the bering</p>
<p>street that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>well some people have a different</p>
<p>that mankind</p>
<p>started in america and they went the other way hmm</p>
<p>well you know that&rsquo;s also possible</p>
<p>human beings have been around so long they&rsquo;ve made a</p>
<p>bunch of recent discoveries</p>
<p>that have way way way pushed back the dates of</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about this in the podcast recently</p>
<p>about crete</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an island is forty</p>
<p>miles away from the shore</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been that way for over five million years</p>
<p>and they found these</p>
<p>stone tools that may be as old as</p>
<p>seven hundred thousand years old</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at least one hundred thousand years old</p>
<p>so they know a hundred thousand years ago</p>
<p>dudes were getting on boats and traveling</p>
<p>forty miles</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s amazing shit yeah</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of shit we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about people man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of shit we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about people but as far as like</p>
<p>what we do know is that the people that were in asia</p>
<p>are the same people that were</p>
<p>north american indians</p>
<p>and north american indians</p>
<p>got fucked by spaniards</p>
<p>and they created mexicans that&rsquo;s what it is that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why some mexicans look like indians they look like</p>
<p>you can just make a fucking</p>
<p>headdress and he&rsquo;d be sitting bull you know</p>
<p>and what else people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand is is that you know japanese and koreans</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;m korean right</p>
<p>we have kakazoid</p>
<p>strains in our dna because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re from mongolia</p>
<p>right and they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>close to russia</p>
<p>right that it</p>
<p>mixed a little bit sure you know i mean</p>
<p>so we have that you know i mean so i&rsquo;m kind of white</p>
<p>well russia</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of parts of russia like siberia</p>
<p>especially where the people look very</p>
<p>asian they look like bjork</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>so they have a weird you</p>
<p>know sort of an inuit</p>
<p>look to them</p>
<p>yeah yeah it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a trip man it&rsquo;s a trip when you step</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really a trip</p>
<p>about asians</p>
<p>i mean the real</p>
<p>trip is the stereotype that they look exactly the same</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t of course look exactly the same but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have to tell you that</p>
<p>but it is kind of</p>
<p>weird that you have an entire</p>
<p>group of people with</p>
<p>narrow eyes and the same</p>
<p>color skin and black hair</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s like zero variation</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy that there&rsquo;s a billion people like that</p>
<p>a billion plus really</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really amazing when you look at the very</p>
<p>minute amount of variation as opposed to european</p>
<p>countries and even african countries</p>
<p>but let me say something to you</p>
<p>okay i ran into you and</p>
<p>eddie once at the sherman oaks galleria</p>
<p>you guys were working out at the gym there okay</p>
<p>and i was maybe</p>
<p>a hundred feet away from you</p>
<p>right and there was probably 20</p>
<p>other asians in my area</p>
<p>right and you from a hundred yards go bobby</p>
<p>and i turned around</p>
<p>right was it like that</p>
<p>dude like hey bobby</p>
<p>yeah you yell</p>
<p>from like a hundred yards i talk to the gym yeah yeah</p>
<p>no it wasn&rsquo;t in the gym it was outside the gym right</p>
<p>it was outside the gym</p>
<p>and so you recognize me from 100 yards away</p>
<p>amongst asians so we don&rsquo;t look alike</p>
<p>well bobby i know who you are</p>
<p>but without that we are saying that we</p>
<p>look like my eyes are good i</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>so what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is is that</p>
<p>we do have differences</p>
<p>sure you have variations in the same theme</p>
<p>same theme over</p>
<p>and over again</p>
<p>yeah the same skin color yeah</p>
<p>look this is not</p>
<p>racist you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of people</p>
<p>right now this is not get did</p>
<p>you this is</p>
<p>dedicated to the people that</p>
<p>will start fucking complaining</p>
<p>either on a message</p>
<p>board or on twitter and yeah i</p>
<p>heard that shit you said</p>
<p>about asians it&rsquo;s so racist</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s just an observation i don&rsquo;t find it</p>
<p>racist it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s a fascinating thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing negative about it</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s fascinating is that</p>
<p>especially in</p>
<p>china and japan</p>
<p>there are a gigantic</p>
<p>group of people that look very very similar</p>
<p>and you know there&rsquo;s not like a lot of</p>
<p>black influence</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a lot of european influence</p>
<p>or the fact that they were able to stay so pure</p>
<p>for so long is really</p>
<p>quite shocking</p>
<p>when you look at the history of the</p>
<p>human race the</p>
<p>human race has been around for</p>
<p>however many</p>
<p>hundreds and hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been so concentrated in this area</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>agents breeding with asians</p>
<p>almost exclusively</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reason why</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve only dated one asian guy</p>
<p>a girl in my</p>
<p>whole life you said guys i said girl</p>
<p>patty i heard you said guy</p>
<p>first girl girl guy</p>
<p>yeah okay girl</p>
<p>so girl patty once you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>power ranger</p>
<p>she in the space one</p>
<p>when they went to space</p>
<p>yes yes hot right</p>
<p>and she was beautiful</p>
<p>so when i was in the bed with her</p>
<p>right you know how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dark and your eyes get adjusted to the</p>
<p>light a little bit the darkness</p>
<p>right you saw yourself</p>
<p>no i didn&rsquo;t see yourself i saw the guy from heroes</p>
<p>i saw the lady from grey&rsquo;s anatomy</p>
<p>i saw my uncle</p>
<p>han i saw kim jong il</p>
<p>i saw i saw everybody</p>
<p>right and after that i said i can&rsquo;t do it anymore wow</p>
<p>so yeah so the girls that i date are always</p>
<p>either six foot two blonde</p>
<p>scandinavian</p>
<p>looking ones</p>
<p>or like you know you know</p>
<p>skinny tall mexicans that are you know i mean</p>
<p>but it cannot be</p>
<p>asians wow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great i knew a girl who was chinese and she had</p>
<p>a thing with her dad and just</p>
<p>asian guys made her</p>
<p>throw up like she couldn&rsquo;t even imagine yeah</p>
<p>fucking her</p>
<p>yeah she&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>so sad yeah</p>
<p>poor kid yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re so excluded</p>
<p>just one group just just</p>
<p>fucking whoever</p>
<p>was the representative of that one group</p>
<p>fucked up so hard</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s you know the</p>
<p>asian parents are really the</p>
<p>worst really</p>
<p>they are the</p>
<p>worst because</p>
<p>they come to this country and they just assume</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>their children here</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be doctors</p>
<p>and lawyers i mean that&rsquo;s flat out there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>three options</p>
<p>right so if you come home with seeds</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting in a beat</p>
<p>i got beat so hard bro really</p>
<p>yeah just beat because i got a c on my report card</p>
<p>now how do your</p>
<p>parents feel now that you&rsquo;re real</p>
<p>successful as</p>
<p>a comedian do they accept that no but when they first</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>stand up they didn&rsquo;t talk to me for years bro whoa</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>for birthdays i go</p>
<p>happy birthday</p>
<p>but thanks dad okay bye</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it yeah</p>
<p>wow but i understand</p>
<p>culturally what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about right</p>
<p>and then when they saw me on the tonight show</p>
<p>leno like 12 years ago i did it right</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>first moment</p>
<p>where they went we fuck up</p>
<p>we totally fuck up</p>
<p>so my dad called me emotionally and i</p>
<p>never seen the guy cry before wow and he</p>
<p>started crying on the</p>
<p>phone goes i</p>
<p>should have supported you but</p>
<p>i never thought you could make</p>
<p>it you know i mean</p>
<p>the main mistake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s heavy man yeah</p>
<p>and it was like the bond</p>
<p>you know that they that they</p>
<p>you know i mean discovered that they made a mistake</p>
<p>yeah that the</p>
<p>whole time like me</p>
<p>getting bad grades in</p>
<p>school we get kicked out of</p>
<p>school you know what i mean</p>
<p>and all the behavioral problems</p>
<p>you need that to be a comedian</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>a single comedian that got straight a&rsquo;s and fucking</p>
<p>studied all the time maybe</p>
<p>had a lot of options then</p>
<p>think of good in</p>
<p>school i think</p>
<p>teddy yeah maybe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his fucking problem</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>root of it right there</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why can i just why my last</p>
<p>point is the reason why that guy cho song we</p>
<p>shot up virginia tech</p>
<p>because his parents were just super</p>
<p>no suppressive his parents okay</p>
<p>always saw the kid talking to imaginary people</p>
<p>yeah in the park you know in like a park</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>now a normal parent would go</p>
<p>that is a mistake you know i mean that&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>right since the kid was getting good grades in school</p>
<p>they just go you know what he&rsquo;s getting good grades</p>
<p>right they never address the problem but he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy right right</p>
<p>like my parents you know i got bad grades</p>
<p>but i was always a good</p>
<p>guy like if i saw a homeless guy you know what i mean</p>
<p>i would give them a dime or</p>
<p>whatever i had in my pocket you know what i mean i was</p>
<p>never an evil person you know what i mean i had a good</p>
<p>heart right</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>acknowledge that part of me you know what i mean</p>
<p>of course they only acknowledge that is he getting good</p>
<p>grades what&rsquo;s colleges is</p>
<p>gonna go do right</p>
<p>so as soon as the guy shot up the school</p>
<p>the korean community harbored</p>
<p>okay this kid</p>
<p>that the appearance of the kid</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t find an interview online</p>
<p>with the parents</p>
<p>like what the fuck happened</p>
<p>right the koreans harbored</p>
<p>the parents so you couldn&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>media couldn&rsquo;t get to them</p>
<p>then they shipped them to korea</p>
<p>the ship the parents of</p>
<p>korea yeah the koreans don&rsquo;t live here anymore</p>
<p>wow they live in korea</p>
<p>hiding you know i mean</p>
<p>in pusong or something you</p>
<p>know i mean in some village it&rsquo;s kind of a fascinating</p>
<p>thing that when someone does something fucked up you</p>
<p>never blame who made them</p>
<p>you know like if my dog goes out and bites people</p>
<p>like all sudden you asshole</p>
<p>you know you did</p>
<p>what did you do with your dog why is your dog so mean</p>
<p>how come your dog wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>contained in</p>
<p>your yard yeah but if your kid goes out and fucking</p>
<p>shoots people and</p>
<p>shoots up a school</p>
<p>nobody like pulls you aside and go hey</p>
<p>what the fuck was</p>
<p>going on when this one was being made yeah</p>
<p>yeah i mean you</p>
<p>saw jeffrey dahmer&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>still you know</p>
<p>defend yeah</p>
<p>themselves like you can&rsquo;t defend that shit</p>
<p>you can but you you can&rsquo;t rather but</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s to say that someone can&rsquo;t just be broken</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s to say you can&rsquo;t just have normal people</p>
<p>and this kids just got a fucking wild</p>
<p>screw loose</p>
<p>period and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do</p>
<p>about it but</p>
<p>can i say something joe and i disagree with you on this</p>
<p>point okay because you know i met your</p>
<p>daughters right just</p>
<p>these well adjusted beautiful kids</p>
<p>right i guarantee you they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna eat it somebody</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah they will not eat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a poor example because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a few that worked out well we&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about the average person we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about there&rsquo;s like the thing</p>
<p>about dahmer is a perfect example because</p>
<p>apparently he was</p>
<p>never abused</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>but his parents</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t together</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t together but</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything and the father</p>
<p>when he saw</p>
<p>domer with a dead dog</p>
<p>i brought home a dead animal</p>
<p>right to my dad</p>
<p>i said look</p>
<p>daddy i found a cat</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>he beat the shit out of me till i</p>
<p>could no longer even move</p>
<p>really and i</p>
<p>never brought</p>
<p>home dead cats anymore did he make you eat it</p>
<p>right okay but this</p>
<p>is this is a</p>
<p>this is a guy that was killing a</p>
<p>bunch of things when he was really</p>
<p>young right yeah yeah but</p>
<p>from what the he&rsquo;s like one of the few cases that</p>
<p>from what i&rsquo;ve read online yeah</p>
<p>maybe you know more</p>
<p>about the case than i did yeah</p>
<p>but what from when i read it more</p>
<p>online there&rsquo;s no evidence that he was ever molested</p>
<p>never had any stories</p>
<p>about it yeah his parents were seemingly normal</p>
<p>yeah maybe you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know i mean it but i</p>
<p>think a lot of it has to do with up nurture yes</p>
<p>yeah a lot of it does but</p>
<p>maybe not all of it</p>
<p>i mean look if someone can be</p>
<p>completely psychotic</p>
<p>like that virginia text</p>
<p>shooter or like many</p>
<p>other serial killers i mean who knows</p>
<p>there might be a variety of</p>
<p>things that can go</p>
<p>wrong it might not just be nurture it</p>
<p>might also be nature that</p>
<p>might be possible but there also i mean</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>admit though that there is a mental</p>
<p>deficiency right sure something going on</p>
<p>and there are</p>
<p>medications out there right</p>
<p>but are there</p>
<p>medications that you can give you a soul</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people that are sociopaths and they</p>
<p>literally they have no feeling for</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>all they think</p>
<p>about themselves we know a</p>
<p>bunch of them we know a few</p>
<p>comics that are sociopaths yeah yeah</p>
<p>i mean c is a</p>
<p>clear sociopath</p>
<p>no no question</p>
<p>no question yeah you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a disconnect between you know</p>
<p>these people and reality</p>
<p>for whatever</p>
<p>reason and almost all of them it&rsquo;s some sort of sexual</p>
<p>abuse when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young yeah almost all of them well</p>
<p>yeah mensia</p>
<p>i guess it came</p>
<p>out in a different way that was what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>you know what i mean instead of like</p>
<p>slaughtering a</p>
<p>village well</p>
<p>you can come out in a</p>
<p>bunch of different ways you</p>
<p>can come out in drug addiction it can come out in you</p>
<p>know prostitution</p>
<p>girls who do porn you know</p>
<p>in my view but you know my view on mensia you know that</p>
<p>you know i see a side to him</p>
<p>that no one</p>
<p>like you guys don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>play the music i play no no</p>
<p>what music what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it give me some no no no no</p>
<p>give me some love music</p>
<p>i know you know i&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>for a long time yeah</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>the neighbor</p>
<p>that you know when well what was dom or like</p>
<p>well he was a nice guy he always said hi and yeah yeah</p>
<p>maybe i am the neighbor he&rsquo;s always kind to me yeah</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;m the neighbor</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the neighbor yeah</p>
<p>but the neighbor</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>look no one</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s evil is evil to everybody i mean fucking</p>
<p>maybe ed gein had a nice cat</p>
<p>you know that he</p>
<p>treated well</p>
<p>right fuck i</p>
<p>know that guy</p>
<p>correct that game</p>
<p>creepy do you</p>
<p>well in just in</p>
<p>sense that like</p>
<p>you know me inspiring these</p>
<p>huge movies like you</p>
<p>know silence the lambs and</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>scary thing is he was doing it back when there was no</p>
<p>other examples of it that was just what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy doing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like this guy learned</p>
<p>about it in</p>
<p>movies yeah</p>
<p>no he was making</p>
<p>clothes out of people</p>
<p>right right right</p>
<p>i think that i</p>
<p>think of making a lampshade</p>
<p>right is worse</p>
<p>than making</p>
<p>clothes they</p>
<p>found lampshades from</p>
<p>world war ii</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re made out of</p>
<p>nazis made out of jews</p>
<p>they found one recently</p>
<p>was preserved</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s horrendous</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s gonna buy that like how</p>
<p>could you put that out in your living room sick</p>
<p>or some people</p>
<p>did they make like</p>
<p>clothing to and i like</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;re just lampshades like that they&rsquo;ve ju</p>
<p>brawls i think they just fucking</p>
<p>slaughtered people</p>
<p>and did whatever they wanted to them who said don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever say to bras in</p>
<p>front of me again</p>
<p>do you have in your</p>
<p>house like a room devoted to kim jong io</p>
<p>like newspaper articles over wall wall circles</p>
<p>and some private</p>
<p>investigator photos</p>

<p>because it seems like he would be your</p>
<p>enemy right</p>
<p>now if i was you why because it seems like he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>everything right now</p>
<p>do you feel some kind of</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know anything</p>

<p>it was it wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>i was joking kind of</p>
<p>like can you get me one of</p>
<p>those two you know it wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>telling him what to do you know i was not a hockey</p>
<p>fan when i was a kid so i didn&rsquo;t know i knew bobby or</p>
<p>was like a name i know it was a big deal</p>
<p>and so i was working at the boston athletic club and</p>
<p>and bobby or used to come there and work out and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the one of the</p>
<p>first times i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>ever been around a professional athlete that had been</p>
<p>fucked up from his sport yeah</p>
<p>i did not know</p>
<p>how bad some dudes got jacked by</p>
<p>their sports but</p>
<p>bobby or had scars up and down both legs yeah</p>
<p>where he had some insane amount of knee</p>
<p>surgeries like 16 fucking knee surgeries</p>
<p>something crazy it</p>
<p>might even be more than that</p>
<p>but his knees were so bad</p>
<p>that he would play racketball</p>
<p>and if the ball went to the left or to the</p>
<p>right he would just lean</p>
<p>and fall to the ground</p>
<p>he literally couldn&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>it was the saddest shit ever man it was so</p>
<p>sad it was the saddest shit ever</p>
<p>and you know what a</p>
<p>versa climber is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a pole it&rsquo;s at an</p>
<p>angle it&rsquo;s got handles for your hands and for your feet</p>
<p>and you kind of</p>
<p>you go up and down up and down with this</p>
<p>thing and it</p>
<p>simulates that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>climbing something it&rsquo;s a lot of versatile</p>
<p>climbing you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do it i used to have to put him on this</p>
<p>thing i used to have to help him</p>
<p>what i used to do is to have to get behind him and i</p>
<p>would have to hold his</p>
<p>waist and he</p>
<p>would put one foot in one of the stirrups</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d have to kind of lift him a little so he</p>
<p>could get his foot into the next one</p>
<p>because his knees didn&rsquo;t bend</p>
<p>yeah his knees</p>
<p>literally didn&rsquo;t bend</p>
<p>they went from like</p>
<p>fully extended</p>
<p>to like one</p>
<p>quarter it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>johnny&rsquo;s arms</p>
<p>is way worse than that</p>
<p>well john mccain</p>
<p>seems like he can&rsquo;t move him past a certain point yeah</p>
<p>shoulders yeah it</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s got bad shoulders</p>
<p>needs to rehab that shit yeah</p>
<p>and he rotated</p>
<p>and i feel whenever i see him i feel bad because</p>
<p>asians did that to him</p>
<p>did they yeah is that what happened to them yeah</p>
<p>he was tortured for five years</p>
<p>really yeah they put them in</p>
<p>straps you know what i mean in rope</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what fucked up his shoulders</p>
<p>yeah really</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>happened mattresses and car bags</p>
<p>maybe slid into third</p>
<p>the bag with his hands</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what happened they fucked up his</p>
<p>shoulders yeah and when i played they made me play john</p>
<p>mccain what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>etie i can look it up how the fuck did</p>
<p>she play look it up</p>
<p>bobby lee jonathan that</p>
<p>sounds silly</p>
<p>right they got the call i got</p>
<p>the call that i want you to play john mccann i go no</p>
<p>they go why</p>
<p>because people like me torture them i&rsquo;m not playing him</p>
<p>too vietnamese</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty distant from koreans</p>
<p>but you know what i&rsquo;m saying though</p>
<p>right if someone said</p>
<p>vietnamese though you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>upset no i wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>vietnamese at all no i love them</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t love them yeah but you&rsquo;d be like you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>idiot you know the difference between</p>
<p>vietnamese and korean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference yeah there&rsquo;s a big difference okay</p>
<p>can i just say</p>
<p>something the reason why i said what i said</p>
<p>which part when</p>
<p>you guys put not you guys right</p>
<p>when he put</p>
<p>the video oh</p>
<p>that said that</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>oh that video is</p>
<p>a jungle news most</p>
<p>people have have no idea what we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t know if you read it online</p>
<p>yeah well most people</p>
<p>are not gonna read the</p>
<p>story about you online</p>
<p>bobby lee once was playing around and said something</p>
<p>about vietnamese</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s you as john mccain</p>
<p>you look like donald trump</p>
<p>fuck frank kelly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it looks like</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t it yeah look up bobby lee</p>
<p>is john mccain</p>
<p>and it does not look like john but</p>
<p>the reason why i said that was because of dad fan</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like that no i wanted to know</p>
<p>where my resentment</p>
<p>why i would say something like that in the</p>
<p>first place people</p>
<p>yeah and it was because at that time</p>
<p>he was way bigger than me</p>
<p>you know what i mean and i knew</p>
<p>in my heart that i could just destroy him you know</p>
<p>i mean as a stand up</p>
<p>and everyone was saying like</p>
<p>that bothered me then</p>
<p>right well it bothered</p>
<p>me then because they were saying he&rsquo;s the funniest</p>
<p>asian guy ever</p>
<p>right and i&rsquo;m like i know</p>
<p>koi i know mark rhodes</p>
<p>you know me i know a lot of</p>
<p>asian comics that are very funny</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>well you know what he had was a killer five minutes</p>
<p>you know and i saw dad fan i was the one of the judges</p>
<p>for last comic</p>
<p>standing yeah the fucking kid destroyed</p>
<p>man i mean he came out and destroyed it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the best material in the</p>
<p>world yeah it was like you know who</p>
<p>who cares you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like pop comedy that&rsquo;s what he was doing yeah but</p>
<p>he destroyed</p>
<p>and then for whatever reason me</p>
<p>really is really funny</p>
<p>but for whatever reason it just</p>
<p>never caught on</p>
<p>after that that was it</p>
<p>but the thing is that i know him on the club level</p>
<p>right and i</p>
<p>know exactly what he can do like in terms of like</p>
<p>if you were to put</p>
<p>that mi coi</p>
<p>like any of the</p>
<p>other asian guys</p>
<p>in armin that it</p>
<p>would you could</p>
<p>would be able to see</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think that that&rsquo;s corrosive</p>
<p>thinking don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think that that that kind of</p>
<p>thinking is detrimental</p>
<p>as a as a person to you like when you</p>
<p>worried about what</p>
<p>other people can do not</p>
<p>hearing yourself no no no no</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t i because i know what you&rsquo;re saying okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know ken john you know his</p>
<p>success i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>happy for him</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve done i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>went on tour with ken</p>
<p>you know man</p>
<p>right we did the</p>
<p>asian tour right</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s been on 15 16 sketches at mad tv</p>
<p>i know his level and i and he&rsquo;s a hard worker nice guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a talent</p>
<p>right okay and</p>
<p>you know i feel the same way</p>
<p>about joe coy or</p>
<p>steve byrne or any of</p>
<p>these guys right</p>
<p>no competitiveness with anybody</p>
<p>but i just i just know</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>at people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talent level</p>
<p>and i just felt that</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t deserve it</p>
<p>yeah but what do you care</p>
<p>this is my point like why are</p>
<p>no but joe i&rsquo;m better</p>
<p>about it now of course</p>
<p>i know but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still sort of defending it right</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m not really determined</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>what i asked is do you</p>
<p>think that behavior is corrosive by saying you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>better than that now you&rsquo;re saying yes it is negative</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s very negative and you know</p>
<p>it was a bad time</p>
<p>really bad time for me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tricky with comedians</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about someone else</p>
<p>early that gets jealous</p>
<p>about people there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>tricky with comics</p>
<p>for some reason when</p>
<p>comics see one person success</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;ve somehow another</p>
<p>think it is being</p>
<p>taking away something from them</p>
<p>yeah is that it&rsquo;s in and for me it&rsquo;s like i</p>
<p>i have accepted</p>
<p>you know mean</p>
<p>i accept what i have in</p>
<p>front of me i love my life</p>
<p>you know mean</p>
<p>but at the time</p>
<p>you know me it was in turmoil</p>
<p>like i wasn&rsquo;t really you know i mean</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know what i was doing you know i mean</p>
<p>right and i was</p>
<p>going you know i had just gotten sober</p>
<p>again you know i mean it was a</p>
<p>rough time you know i mean</p>
<p>just you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just sensitive you know i mean of course</p>
<p>and so yeah i mean</p>
<p>in retrospect it was</p>
<p>really ugly</p>
<p>yeah my point of view that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things you have to</p>
<p>learn from now you</p>
<p>know but you see it so much in the open mic night days</p>
<p>you remember when you were an open mic</p>
<p>night guy and</p>
<p>you were just</p>
<p>starting out and then</p>
<p>there would be guys you work with it</p>
<p>started getting work yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>dude everyone</p>
<p>would hate i</p>
<p>would hate i</p>
<p>totally hate on people that</p>
<p>would start i&rsquo;d be like this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be good fuck him</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>good enough to get a job like you know it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>him getting that job</p>
<p>is not taking anything away but this is yeah but the</p>
<p>thing that what you</p>
<p>learn over time though is is that</p>
<p>you realize there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>work out there right</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s i feel like there&rsquo;s enough for everybody</p>
<p>but at the time when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting jobs</p>
<p>you know mean</p>
<p>yeah you know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>funny sure it&rsquo;s just a difficult</p>
<p>transition course i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is it because that fans of</p>
<p>vietnamese is that have anything to do with it uh</p>
<p>no no no no no</p>
<p>because i know that from san diego</p>
<p>first of all he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>liar remember like</p>
<p>during the show you said he&rsquo;d been doing for two years</p>
<p>i started with the guy</p>
<p>your man in san diego</p>
<p>i mean i mean i have</p>
<p>photos with him your</p>
<p>man from back</p>
<p>in the nineties</p>
<p>so he had been doing a long time way long</p>
<p>you know i mean living</p>
<p>underneath the desk all</p>
<p>these things that he said he</p>
<p>claiming he was</p>
<p>doing you know mean it&rsquo;s not true to me was not true</p>
<p>and also marker cho</p>
<p>wrote him a letters because he&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>stolen the joke</p>
<p>from her what joke was that i don&rsquo;t know what joke</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>asian jokes is very</p>
<p>tricky it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a buddy of mine</p>
<p>my friend john tobin</p>
<p>from new york</p>
<p>used to say this that when you work with a bunch of</p>
<p>black guys he goes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always if there&rsquo;s three</p>
<p>comics and two guys are</p>
<p>white and one guy&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>black the black guy</p>
<p>is always like yeah man i was supposed to be closing</p>
<p>i heard that i was supposed to be closed</p>
<p>he goes unless</p>
<p>two black guys and the</p>
<p>black guy then they&rsquo;re like yeah i&rsquo;m supposed to open i</p>
<p>gotta get out</p>
<p>why yeah</p>
<p>that is so funny so</p>
<p>true because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much hack</p>
<p>shit that guys</p>
<p>would just rely on cause it would work</p>
<p>every time now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>white people looking around seeing if you</p>
<p>could laugh at this yeah it&rsquo;s like jewish material</p>
<p>every person that&rsquo;s a jew has to talk</p>
<p>about them being</p>
<p>a jew it&rsquo;s like they all do the same material</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when i went on tour with</p>
<p>the four three</p>
<p>koreans we did the kings of comedy was me</p>
<p>steve bernken</p>
<p>and kevin shay</p>
<p>and no one wanted to close</p>
<p>we would kind of</p>
<p>fight backstage like</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>close sometimes</p>
<p>you know what i mean and it was very difficult</p>
<p>because it was so much</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that we went</p>
<p>over the material it&rsquo;s just the fact that</p>
<p>all asian comics have at</p>
<p>least 10 minutes</p>
<p>right of their act</p>
<p>about being</p>
<p>asian right</p>
<p>the point of view</p>
<p>might be different</p>
<p>or the angle right</p>
<p>but you at all</p>
<p>those probably have the most material</p>
<p>right yeah the most material</p>
<p>but yeah but now i have</p>
<p>to kill her shit as asian</p>
<p>that do you</p>
<p>still do that bit</p>
<p>about the vietnamese guy hiding in the camp</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they</p>
<p>won the war</p>
<p>they can hide in</p>
<p>they can hide in trees for</p>
<p>three weeks</p>
<p>just a banana</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t it was a killer that was in that</p>
<p>video you were talking</p>
<p>about right just before that we put up that</p>
<p>the one that you got in</p>
<p>trouble for</p>
<p>yeah that video yeah didn&rsquo;t you talk</p>
<p>about it in that</p>
<p>video no no</p>
<p>no no no i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>blame you for the</p>
<p>video by the way</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>one of those</p>
<p>no it was just</p>
<p>well for a couple years i couldn&rsquo;t even look at you why</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be honest</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>can i just say this i just get this because we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t talked about it</p>
<p>i just want to</p>
<p>bring it up can i</p>
<p>bring it up sure anything okay</p>
<p>there was a time</p>
<p>about i don&rsquo;t know when</p>
<p>two of the years</p>
<p>that i felt</p>
<p>that there was</p>
<p>animosity between me</p>
<p>and your camp</p>
<p>what because you</p>
<p>never felt it for me</p>
<p>yes i did really</p>
<p>for me yeah i felt i felt that i honestly i felt that</p>
<p>could i be sure</p>
<p>is that i felt that there was a</p>
<p>weirdness because of the whole</p>
<p>the video that i had come out no</p>
<p>and and with ari</p>
<p>you know me me are we not getting along</p>

<p>brings me over</p>
<p>right and then i had like</p>
<p>six mexicans just sit</p>
<p>me down are you sure they were really max i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re japanese yeah you have to do some</p>
<p>japanese yeah</p>
<p>guatemala yeah</p>
<p>and you know carlos is there</p>
<p>ned and he just goes was he sitting in a</p>
<p>throne no it was outside and he just goes</p>
<p>you gotta do this for me</p>
<p>so i did it</p>
<p>you know what i mean and then that happened and then</p>
<p>you know what i mean the weirdest part</p>
<p>about the video though what sucked is is that</p>
<p>you made this</p>
<p>video that didn&rsquo;t even seem like you even knew the</p>
<p>video you were talking about</p>
<p>it almost seemed like whatever i can&rsquo;t remember the</p>
<p>actual words in it it</p>
<p>sounded like you were talking about a video</p>
<p>that you hadn&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>which it was even weirder because</p>
<p>i got caught between</p>
<p>two camps that i you know mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always had a relationship with right</p>
<p>joe and i have known</p>
<p>each other for so long i don&rsquo;t have a camp</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t mean people human</p>
<p>not camp you know what i&rsquo;m saying okay</p>
<p>and then you know mensia had a group his group</p>
<p>right and i felt like i was in the middle and that</p>
<p>you know i mean i felt like at a time</p>
<p>where i had to choose i felt like</p>
<p>i stayed on of it</p>
<p>you know me</p>
<p>for the most probably i for the longest time</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about it in</p>
<p>radio or anything like that because people</p>
<p>would bring it up</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d go on tour and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>so you know i mean and i&rsquo;d be like i don&rsquo;t want to talk</p>
<p>about it you know i mean</p>
<p>as far as just like the amount of</p>
<p>interest generated</p>
<p>by that that&rsquo;s probably one of the most controversial</p>
<p>videos in like</p>
<p>the history of comedy it probably was you</p>
<p>know it kind of</p>
<p>crazy it was insane</p>
<p>but you know what also kind of</p>
<p>crazy was you remember what the</p>
<p>environment was like before anybody called him on that</p>
<p>where everybody was on eggshells you&rsquo;re constantly</p>
<p>terrified of that guy walking in the room yeah was</p>
<p>crazy and then he was</p>
<p>becoming successful is</p>
<p>becoming successful and then just</p>
<p>yeah like i said you know i just don&rsquo;t see that part</p>
<p>you see the</p>
<p>movie i inform</p>
<p>you say that</p>
<p>how can you say that because you do you did because</p>
<p>it stole some</p>
<p>shit from you man i mean i know you had issues with</p>
<p>okay i know can i just say this though yes all right</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it is okay like we said before okay that it is like</p>
<p>you know one of</p>
<p>those situations where</p>
<p>he the guy when i was an open micro</p>
<p>right used to he bought me a car</p>
<p>it was a used car</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t have a car right</p>
<p>and then he took me on tour him and polly</p>
<p>shore like would rotate</p>
<p>like one guy</p>
<p>would take me one you know</p>
<p>i mean who was more fun to hang out with on the road</p>
<p>obviously polly</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t make me cry you know i mean but like</p>
<p>i used to get</p>
<p>pussy you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>pussy on a minsier show</p>
<p>why not because they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>married and</p>
<p>have 19 kids and you know what i mean and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>any man see offend</p>
<p>you know i love you but my point is</p>
<p>you know what i mean but my</p>
<p>point is is this that so how did he make you cry</p>
<p>well he would make me go to golf with him</p>
<p>what he like he plays golf and i hate golf</p>
<p>and i have to get</p>
<p>early and carry you know like</p>
<p>bring the golf back you</p>
<p>would have to</p>
<p>bring them i did it once or</p>
<p>twice and i stopped doing it you know i mean and then</p>
<p>tell you and then one</p>
<p>time oh no no no one time he let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>move over that</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>carry back the one time i had to</p>
<p>we played denver once and he made me</p>
<p>sleep i didn&rsquo;t give me a</p>
<p>hotel room this</p>
<p>is what he wasn&rsquo;t doing as well</p>
<p>he like it was in the beginning</p>
<p>and i had to</p>
<p>sleep in albert&rsquo;s closet</p>
<p>cut the fuck out of here</p>
<p>on the road with them and you didn&rsquo;t even get a</p>
<p>hotel this is he wasn&rsquo;t selling out at the time this is</p>
<p>literally in ninety six ninety five</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>wow but it&rsquo;s so you know you you know you he is like</p>
<p>he was always like you know a brother</p>
<p>in a sense you know i mean</p>
<p>you know regardless</p>
<p>he nurtured you</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t nurture me like i</p>
<p>think that the how</p>
<p>did you cry what made you cry</p>
<p>just having to like get</p>
<p>up and like you know there was a time we had to sell</p>
<p>merch and and as a</p>
<p>young comic</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to do you want to make it you know you what you</p>
<p>appreciate the stage time</p>
<p>and it was just</p>
<p>so he makes you work for him</p>
<p>and on top of just opening up for yeah but to be honest</p>
<p>a lot of guys do that shit dude really</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t when i because i have openers now and i</p>
<p>treat them with all those</p>
<p>okay yeah probably does all the time</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what it what it is this okay is</p>
<p>mency is one</p>
<p>thing but polly right</p>
<p>he specifically</p>
<p>made me a regular there</p>
<p>like he made his mom pass me</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>and so there is a specific relationship</p>
<p>no one on planet earth</p>
<p>talks to me like polly talks to me</p>
<p>in what way he</p>
<p>talks to me like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>literally his younger brother</p>

<p>and i understand it because you know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known him for so long</p>
<p>but in in the</p>
<p>world in the</p>
<p>world i&rsquo;m almost</p>
<p>forty you know i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t let anyone talk to me the way polly talks to</p>

<p>lived in his</p>
<p>house you know me you lived in his</p>
<p>house well he</p>
<p>charged me rent</p>
<p>but the thing</p>
<p>is is that you know any problem on the road so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a key really bad i&rsquo;ll be back in one</p>
<p>second okay</p>
<p>is that cool sure go ahead</p>
<p>so joe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get a</p>
<p>story straight it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go in there no i don&rsquo;t have my stories if i said</p>
<p>about polly</p>
<p>no no i&rsquo;m just kidding i&rsquo;m just kidding</p>
<p>turn around so joe i saw a</p>
<p>movie last night you</p>
<p>you already</p>
<p>bought it i guess yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>enter the void</p>
<p>and it is like somebody saw you talk</p>
<p>about dmt and</p>
<p>tried to write a</p>
<p>script around it around some</p>
<p>living in tokyo</p>
<p>i mean well</p>
<p>maybe they just did it</p>
<p>huh well no</p>
<p>it has a lot to do with dmt</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>maybe they did yeah but how they describe it in the</p>
<p>movie sounds like they&rsquo;re reenacting you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna fucking like the</p>
<p>movie was made for you it&rsquo;s really amazing</p>
<p>then it gets really annoying</p>
<p>but like the</p>
<p>first half of the</p>
<p>movie is like</p>
<p>wow this is fucking cool</p>
<p>they show a dmt</p>
<p>thing what would</p>
<p>it what it feels like to be on dmt</p>
<p>for the first half of the movie</p>
<p>and there gets parts where it</p>
<p>sounds exactly like how you describe it</p>
<p>and then whoever</p>
<p>directed the movie</p>
<p>which is name is</p>
<p>hold on i tell you one second</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s directed by gasper no</p>
<p>he is brilliant when</p>
<p>does it come out on dvd it came out tuesday</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on netflix</p>
<p>we already have it netflix</p>
<p>streaming hd 2 but it is</p>
<p>so amazing if i ever make a</p>
<p>movie i want to make my</p>
<p>movie look exactly like this guy</p>
<p>wow brilliant</p>
<p>but then it gets really</p>
<p>annoying and there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these like why&rsquo;d it get</p>
<p>annoying um well</p>
<p>one of the directors</p>
<p>things is like it does like the strobe light</p>
<p>thing through it</p>
<p>it gets so bad that i feel like i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>hypnotized like it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>movie was made by google</p>
<p>or the government and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see what</p>
<p>i mean like you&rsquo;ll sit there and like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have a seizure</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m having a seizure</p>
<p>wait i&rsquo;m being programmed to do something</p>
<p>all right this you know it&rsquo;s do you know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>olympic logo that they had</p>
<p>a poll because it was giving people epileptic seizures</p>
<p>wait what was that al</p>
<p>rocher thing</p>
<p>where al rocher</p>
<p>i listened to</p>
<p>it on opie and anthony it was pretty fucking funny</p>
<p>because opie and anthony were shitting on al rocher</p>
<p>because al rocher was making fun of epileptics</p>
<p>he said so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still watching</p>
<p>this if you&rsquo;re not flopping around on the ground</p>
<p>you know and so he</p>
<p>starts making fun of it and then the next</p>
<p>day he comes back and says i was only making fun of</p>
<p>the ad i was</p>
<p>never making fun of epileptics</p>
<p>right which is</p>
<p>total bullshit</p>
<p>when you see this though it&rsquo;s amazing that there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>fucking five warnings</p>
<p>on the dvd before you even</p>
<p>watch it cause</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so bad that it feels like you&rsquo;re being fucking</p>
<p>brainwashed</p>
<p>would you remember that dude that we had on the message</p>
<p>board that his wife was epileptic and she</p>
<p>would watch certain avatars on people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>screens they have</p>
<p>flashing avatars yeah</p>
<p>what was his name jim jim</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a nice guy i hung out with him he was</p>
<p>marilyn manson&rsquo;s webmaster</p>
<p>right really fucking good dude yeah</p>
<p>i hung with him and his wife and his wife has some</p>
<p>weird condition</p>
<p>where she if she sees anything</p>
<p>flashing strobing</p>
<p>those little animated gift files that flat</p>
<p>she would just</p>
<p>tongue rolls back</p>
<p>eyes roll back in her head</p>
<p>falls onto the ground this movie</p>
<p>would make her pregnant</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how bad it is i mean</p>
<p>fuck is it with people that</p>
<p>certain things just make your</p>
<p>brain shut off</p>
<p>like flashes and</p>
<p>strokes i can</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>like if you see this</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel sick</p>
<p>in your stomach</p>
<p>when you see parts of this movie</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have to turn away and</p>
<p>look at the ground for like but</p>
<p>is the movie good</p>
<p>the movie is the director</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll fall in love with the director the movie</p>
<p>is so good at the beginning and interesting and just</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>see anything like it in the trips the visuals if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stoned when you see it</p>
<p>you might have a</p>
<p>panic attack i</p>
<p>watched it in 3d last night</p>
<p>and i was like i am</p>
<p>tripping right now i feel like i&rsquo;m on acid</p>
<p>right now really it&rsquo;s so good</p>
<p>then it just gets</p>
<p>boring and confusing and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t tell me</p>
<p>why and why</p>
<p>would i want to watch it</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still i like it but it just kind of fades off</p>
<p>after it gets</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really cool and then it kind of just kind of well</p>
<p>you and i don&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>agree on movies there&rsquo;s probably a few</p>
<p>movies that you</p>
<p>ever seen the</p>
<p>movie irreversible</p>
<p>what irreversible</p>
<p>irreversible</p>
<p>no what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>movie played backwards</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s notorious because there&rsquo;s a five</p>
<p>minute rape</p>
<p>scene in it in a</p>
<p>tunnel which i</p>
<p>swear to god</p>
<p>the most brutal</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s online say it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst rape scene</p>
<p>ever you have to see it</p>
<p>so real this is a japanese</p>
<p>movie no it&rsquo;s german or</p>
<p>some shit like that nice yeah they&rsquo;re fucked up human</p>
<p>centipede not</p>
<p>not into that</p>
<p>not into watching people get raped</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>watched food ink the</p>
<p>other day great</p>
<p>and fucking</p>
<p>disturbing man i</p>
<p>watched it on the way home from west palm</p>
<p>beach florida</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s disturbing shit dude</p>
<p>when that lady</p>
<p>started talking</p>
<p>about her son dying</p>
<p>about her son got e coli</p>
<p>from jack in</p>
<p>the box burger and how he was suffering at the end</p>
<p>i had to shut it off</p>
<p>even in the 70s</p>
<p>jack in the box had a big controversy</p>
<p>where not only one person died but a</p>
<p>bunch of people died</p>
<p>yeah yeah from</p>
<p>their food dude food inc is</p>
<p>scary as fuck</p>
<p>you know and i&rsquo;ve had some people</p>
<p>email me and</p>
<p>tweet me saying that well it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>really that bad it&rsquo;s propaganda they&rsquo;re just trying to</p>
<p>shock you but</p>
<p>how can they be trying to</p>
<p>shock you if they&rsquo;re showing you reality</p>
<p>i mean if what they&rsquo;re showing</p>
<p>exists on any level</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrifying when they show</p>
<p>these cows that are caked in manure</p>
<p>and this one cow</p>
<p>there was a plastic ring and</p>
<p>his stomach was exposed</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>reaching into</p>
<p>his stomach</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like whoa what the fuck and how</p>
<p>about chickens man if you didn&rsquo;t know i mean look</p>
<p>if you like your cheeseburgers and you like to go to</p>
<p>wendy&rsquo;s two o&rsquo;clock in the morning and i do too man</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t watch this movie</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna fuck with</p>
<p>your head but this</p>
<p>these chickens they give</p>
<p>these chicken steroids and antibiotics and</p>
<p>all kinds of</p>
<p>things and they fuck with</p>
<p>their genetics somehow in</p>
<p>order to get them to grow</p>
<p>so ridiculously big and plump that they can&rsquo;t walk</p>
<p>and they die</p>
<p>all the time they just fall down and die not foster</p>
<p>farms people make fun of like chinese people</p>
<p>yeah they have</p>
<p>those commercials</p>
<p>about how they plump them up and put salts and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>and just make them really fat with like salt and</p>
<p>water and stuff</p>
<p>in foster farms that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>their whole advertising is</p>
<p>based on that so there are advertisers</p>
<p>based on they don&rsquo;t use hormones right oh</p>
<p>okay well that&rsquo;s good to know man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be a</p>
<p>humane way to make food if it costs a couple bucks more</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how much more it</p>
<p>would cost to not have cows</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m down with eating meat okay</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me wrong</p>
<p>but the way that they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>producing meat for you know for fast food and for</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally beyond</p>
<p>being humane</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beyond that it&rsquo;s gotten to this factory</p>
<p>consciousness less</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>just feelingless</p>
<p>place where they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>stuffing all</p>
<p>these animals in these</p>
<p>small areas and getting as much bang for</p>
<p>their buck as they can well they</p>
<p>make this food</p>
<p>like they make an ipod like it&rsquo;s a factory system</p>
<p>right and if there&rsquo;s no love or care or and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make the product</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people</p>
<p>make fun of chinese all the time for the</p>
<p>things that they eat</p>
<p>like if you ever</p>
<p>gonna do a chinese market</p>
<p>you can get anything</p>
<p>butterfly wings</p>
<p>or you know what i mean or you know what i mean</p>
<p>the shoulder of a meerkat or whatever</p>
<p>i mean like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat anything</p>
<p>but the thing is that americans eat way</p>
<p>worse right</p>
<p>with these cows you know i mean</p>
<p>just tainted meat</p>
<p>yeah you know i mean</p>
<p>people think that well also</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>china has a</p>
<p>billion people yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s self sustainable</p>
<p>china doesn&rsquo;t import food from anywhere else</p>
<p>right so that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>crazy yeah yeah even</p>
<p>of itself they&rsquo;re able to feed a</p>
<p>billion people when you feed a billion people like that</p>
<p>you got to eat bugs</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna there is a restaurant and bank on</p>
<p>that person</p>
<p>animal dick that&rsquo;s all they do and there&rsquo;s a six</p>
<p>month waiting</p>
<p>list to get on into this restaurant what animal dick</p>
<p>bangkok how do you order that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d whisper</p>
<p>there was a anthony bourdain show</p>
<p>the other day</p>
<p>where they were serving animal dick soup</p>

<p>right to headlining</p>
<p>man yeah i know and it was fucking hard i bet</p>
<p>fucking you see that</p>
<p>thing on the con</p>
<p>line i&rsquo;m getting booed</p>
<p>on stage yeah</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s that room</p>
<p>mm hmm that room is so retarded</p>
<p>what room is that</p>
<p>oh no what what</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>black crowds no no that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying what do you</p>
<p>say that&rsquo;s not exactly what i didn&rsquo;t say that at all</p>
<p>so what did you say</p>
<p>just those kind of rooms are</p>
<p>fucking hard</p>
<p>difficult i</p>
<p>retarded was the</p>
<p>wrong word black</p>
<p>crowds shock the</p>
<p>sundays no not</p>
<p>crowds do there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two kind start failing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not rooting for you to get back on your feet</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is that i go on</p>
<p>i go on the road</p>
<p>right and i get</p>
<p>black people to come to my show</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>legitimate fans right</p>
<p>and i love them dearly that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cultural thing</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>when you go to a certain areas like</p>
<p>south philly or whatever</p>
<p>right and you do a show</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>black right</p>
<p>even in the lineup</p>
<p>and you had to perform</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most difficult</p>
<p>situation ever</p>
<p>right for a guy like me</p>
<p>well you know it&rsquo;s a different kind of</p>
<p>crowd and i</p>
<p>think the good thing</p>
<p>about those</p>
<p>crowds is that they don&rsquo;t let you be indulgent</p>
<p>and they want your jokes to come quick</p>
<p>they wanna come</p>
<p>quick yeah they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna wait around they&rsquo;re also tonal</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>told you can&rsquo;t be monotone no</p>
<p>you gotta you know i mean</p>
<p>you know some</p>
<p>excitement attitude</p>
<p>total that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right you know me or whatever you know i mean</p>
<p>if i cause i now i&rsquo;m like i used to be more</p>
<p>energetic now i just kind of talk like this because</p>
<p>can would be</p>
<p>more myself</p>
<p>and no not only that is because</p>
<p>no is because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pace</p>
<p>right you know when i</p>
<p>first started headlining</p>
<p>i wanted to do what i did as an opener</p>
<p>which is go out in gung</p>
<p>ho get them</p>
<p>you know what i mean as a headliner</p>
<p>and then fifteen minutes in you&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>right you mean you just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do that pace for</p>
<p>forty five minutes well you you gotta</p>
<p>first of all it&rsquo;s not fun for the audience either you</p>
<p>gotta create a show</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like when you go to see a</p>
<p>movie it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>you know an opening gun</p>
<p>scene that lasts for ninety minutes and the</p>
<p>thing shuts off you like what the fuck did i just</p>
<p>watch yeah so now i</p>
<p>build you know i mean yeah but in</p>
<p>you have peaks and valleys yeah but in</p>
<p>black rooms</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no peeking</p>
<p>you just keep</p>
<p>hammering i just feel like you have to be like</p>
<p>earthquake and just</p>
<p>hammer it away</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s got to do it and what how long does</p>
<p>earthquake do 45</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like perfect</p>
<p>45 sprinting uphill</p>
<p>ah shooting all the way</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>throw your backpack back and</p>
<p>throwing lying your</p>
<p>and then once you lose them like in a</p>
<p>white room when you lose them you get them you</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ll get them back</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>getting black</p>
<p>crowds back yeah</p>
<p>wow i want to try it i want to try it</p>
<p>black you will die</p>
<p>you will die up there</p>
<p>son you will</p>
<p>get barbecued i did the most important</p>
<p>thing with black rooms is</p>
<p>economy of words</p>
<p>right as well and a</p>
<p>short attention span</p>
<p>you got to hammer them with bits i did</p>
<p>my black version</p>
<p>of my set once at</p>
<p>flappers in burbank</p>
<p>and it actually killed</p>
<p>it was like what do you mean the</p>
<p>black version</p>
<p>i just do it more like he said instead</p>
<p>of doing your jokes normal i kind of be like</p>
<p>i went to the</p>
<p>store the other day to get a hat</p>
<p>and my girlfriend</p>
<p>got the same one oh my</p>
<p>god kind of like it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>starting out</p>
<p>i see is he</p>

<p>and zari and zari</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s kind of like his his</p>
<p>whatever his character</p>
<p>is you know it&rsquo;s kind of like that but it worked</p>
<p>no it worked</p>
<p>though that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying he hears phantom</p>
<p>laugh still</p>
<p>first of all i don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what flappers is</p>
<p>flappers and burbank is it good</p>
<p>who played it</p>
<p>never been there yeah i may</p>
<p>never play there i</p>

<p>what do you mean you don&rsquo;t do well i don&rsquo;t do good in</p>
<p>ha ha the ha ha</p>
<p>yeah why not</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t know what it is it&rsquo;s just because i</p>
<p>think what it is is because it&rsquo;s free</p>
<p>oh the audience is</p>
<p>not paying to go there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying though is is that you&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>free set no that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m saying either what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is there&rsquo;s two types of audiences i feel okay</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why i don&rsquo;t comp when i do on the road go on the</p>
<p>road because of the fact that if you comp right</p>
<p>they just a general</p>
<p>feeling of like you know i mean it&rsquo;s not a good show</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not a good show</p>
<p>expect much exactly you know</p>
<p>me but when you have people pay</p>
<p>right people are respectful</p>
<p>yes you don&rsquo;t have it as many hecklers you know</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m fine i don&rsquo;t care who comes but the</p>
<p>thing is that haha</p>
<p>right they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>not only do they not pay you</p>
<p>but you have to pay for your drinks</p>
<p>right like can i get a red bull</p>
<p>they go three</p>
<p>dollars or whatever i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m playing it for free</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>already there&rsquo;s a sign</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a feeling</p>
<p>of disrespect now i don&rsquo;t know what flappers is like</p>
<p>but i just don&rsquo;t like that disrespect flowers</p>

<p>and he&rsquo;s alleging</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a drug that they gave him to</p>
<p>treat parkinson&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>that turned him into a gay sex and gambling addict</p>
<p>at 51 years old</p>
<p>the guy it said the 51 year old&rsquo;s lawyer says</p>
<p>their client&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>changed radically</p>
<p>after his first</p>
<p>administered a drug in 2003 for the illness</p>
<p>which caused his tremors</p>
<p>blah blah blah</p>
<p>the man is a</p>
<p>married father of two</p>
<p>says he has attempted suicide</p>
<p>three times</p>
<p>claims he became addicted to internet gambling</p>
<p>losing the family savings and</p>
<p>stealing to feed his habit</p>
<p>he also became a compulsive</p>
<p>gay sex addict</p>
<p>and began exposing himself on the internet and</p>
<p>cross dressing</p>
<p>this risky sexual behavior</p>
<p>the risky sexual encounters led to him</p>
<p>being raped his lawyer said</p>
<p>his behavior stopped when he</p>
<p>stopped taking the drugs in 2005</p>
<p>by then he had been</p>
<p>demoted in his defense ministry job and suffering from</p>
<p>psychological trauma</p>
<p>resulting from his addictions</p>
<p>so he just went on a gay sex</p>
<p>gambling rampage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what happened though</p>
<p>no but listen man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not right it&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>because i put this up on twitter and a</p>
<p>bunch of people who</p>
<p>neuropsychologists and a</p>
<p>bunch of different people are qualified</p>
<p>started sending me like i got like six or seven</p>
<p>tweets from people who</p>
<p>either studying it in</p>
<p>school or actually doctors in the</p>
<p>field and they were saying that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a dopamine agonist i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the word yeah and that</p>
<p>it does facilitate addiction and it can</p>
<p>interrupt your natural</p>
<p>patterns no</p>
<p>i agree with that</p>
<p>all right but what i&rsquo;m saying is that it does if</p>
<p>what if you have an addiction of</p>
<p>exposing yourself and doing gay sex</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s been hidden inside you for many years</p>
<p>so you think this was just it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>out of the yeah</p>
<p>out of the blue</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up i wanna suck</p>
<p>dick out of the blue he&rsquo;s taking a</p>
<p>crazy drug no not out of the blue</p>
<p>maybe it seemed more</p>
<p>exciting to him</p>
<p>maybe it never like regular sex he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fifty one years old</p>
<p>maybe regular sex was god</p>
<p>so tired of getting laid</p>
<p>i mean think</p>
<p>about another 11 years for you you&rsquo;re 40 years old</p>
<p>think about another 11 years from now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like god i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>tired of pussy is so boring</p>
<p>and then somebody gives you</p>
<p>the drug you&rsquo;re like why don&rsquo;t you go suck some cock</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like why don&rsquo;t i suck some cock i made you</p>
<p>dress up like a girl</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve heard this phenomenon</p>
<p>when people</p>
<p>are so jaded with sex like rock stars or whatever</p>
<p>or whatever that it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t mean they get so</p>
<p>tired of it</p>
<p>it just turns into dick you know what i mean</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with that either i</p>
<p>think dick was always in the</p>
<p>you know in the</p>
<p>picture yeah but i</p>
<p>think everybody&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>their own little</p>
<p>story about how i mean there was a lot of</p>
<p>bisexuality</p>
<p>going on in the 70s</p>
<p>according to</p>
<p>many people</p>
<p>mick jagger and</p>
<p>david bowie</p>
<p>and lou reed all that</p>
<p>stuff yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah but i think a lot of that was like</p>
<p>you know probably one</p>
<p>crafty gay dude talked all</p>
<p>these other</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just cool man yeah</p>
<p>yeah plus they&rsquo;re all doing acid and</p>
<p>experimenting with</p>
<p>their consciousness and</p>
<p>you know it is like one of those</p>
<p>lost taboos</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like okay well let&rsquo;s stop and look in the why is</p>
<p>gay sex such a</p>
<p>okay i agree</p>
<p>with this okay if you&rsquo;re fucked up</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re faded you&rsquo;re on you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking you&rsquo;re almost in a blackout</p>
<p>drunk you know what i mean</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re with</p>
<p>david boy and you&rsquo;re a big rock star</p>
<p>and dilly if</p>
<p>david boy pulls out his</p>
<p>penis right</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like suck</p>
<p>it you know i mean i don&rsquo;t know why do you have to be</p>
<p>blacked out</p>
<p>drunk what i was just saying was</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>experimenting with different ways of looking at the</p>
<p>world you know</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being an artist and being like</p>
<p>a rock star</p>
<p>being a creative person</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people that are created people that are willing to take</p>
<p>weird chances and and do</p>
<p>weird things to</p>
<p>see what maybe i&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with it</p>
<p>so what do you say you</p>
<p>know i mean i you know i have gay people that represent</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go there stop but what i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>racist i have</p>
<p>black friends no no okay</p>
<p>okay right you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m saying is this</p>
<p>that i don&rsquo;t have anything i know</p>
<p>against but you&rsquo;re convinced</p>
<p>though that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying this is because of the pills</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is that what&rsquo;s this guy&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>ted haggard</p>
<p>haggard right</p>
<p>just out of</p>
<p>the blue you know what i mean he does man he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never said out of the blue that he said he was gay the</p>
<p>whole time he</p>
<p>never said that he&rsquo;s been doing</p>
<p>interviews recently</p>
<p>where he says he was bisexual the whole time</p>
<p>yeah he said</p>
<p>what his issue is he said</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying though</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying you know what i&rsquo;m saying that the guy</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>okay but this guy that</p>
<p>never had an</p>
<p>exceptional</p>
<p>encounter he hit it</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what i would</p>
<p>think that bobby</p>
<p>what bobby&rsquo;s saying is probably true too</p>
<p>like he probably had it in the back of his head yeah</p>
<p>and because of</p>
<p>socialization</p>
<p>right he just he just refuses</p>
<p>right to address it and</p>
<p>i agree that the pill</p>
<p>did something to open his mind up</p>
<p>maybe you know what i mean</p>
<p>but i feel like that instinct is there yeah that</p>
<p>is okay that is a possibility but why</p>
<p>would you want</p>
<p>to decide one way or another without being that guy why</p>
<p>would you even make a judgment call like how the fuck</p>
<p>could you know</p>
<p>what caused this</p>
<p>guy to do gay sex and once you go into his past and</p>
<p>interview him and</p>
<p>find out have</p>
<p>you ever been attracted to guys did you ever have a</p>
<p>wrestling match</p>
<p>where you got a boner</p>
<p>unless you why even</p>
<p>it is possible</p>
<p>if attraction and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things are really</p>
<p>neurochemical reactions that we have inside of our mind</p>
<p>or inside of our brain</p>
<p>if we figure out a way to</p>
<p>stimulate certain parts of the brain</p>
<p>look i mean</p>
<p>think about what we</p>
<p>can do as far as like antidepressants and all sorts of</p>
<p>things that affect</p>
<p>mood and neurochemistry</p>
<p>what if they can give you</p>
<p>something that makes you attracted to the opposite sex</p>
<p>what if they</p>
<p>can give you something that you&rsquo;re gay and all of a</p>
<p>sudden you like girls</p>
<p>or give you something</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re heterosexual</p>
<p>they were trying to do that in iraq</p>
<p>they were trying to come out with a bomb the cia was</p>
<p>they actually put research and development into this</p>
<p>a gay bomb a bomb that they</p>
<p>would detonate</p>
<p>and it would be some sort of a chemical</p>
<p>agent that would go into the air</p>
<p>and it would make all</p>
<p>these soldiers become</p>
<p>rabidly attracted to each</p>
<p>other and they would lose</p>
<p>morale they</p>
<p>would just start fucking</p>
<p>but i even think i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>strongest of</p>
<p>ecstasy i never wanted to suck a dick</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>ecstasy we&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about it i know but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>like any drugs</p>
<p>no no no any drugs</p>
<p>has a very specific</p>
<p>affection reaction but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you sexually attracted to someone</p>
<p>it is possible that there</p>
<p>could be something</p>
<p>as strong as what excess</p>
<p>he does for you</p>
<p>in terms of affection and</p>
<p>sensitivity and feeling for</p>
<p>things and a loosening</p>
<p>of insecurities it&rsquo;s very possible that something else</p>
<p>could do it</p>
<p>another way that all of a</p>
<p>sudden makes you gay</p>
<p>i mean if you</p>
<p>talk to a gay guy like we have gay friends and</p>
<p>you and i together</p>
<p>we have gay friends we</p>
<p>go to the gym and go see</p>
<p>bobby lee hey bobby</p>
<p>go watch musicals</p>
<p>when you talk to them they</p>
<p>never feel like there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with them</p>
<p>you know they feel pretty fucking normal so</p>
<p>what is it that separates</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>his name but the dude who&rsquo;s our friends is the</p>
<p>piano guy from the store yeah</p>
<p>great fucking guy okay</p>
<p>so what is the difference between him and us</p>
<p>well the only difference is that he&rsquo;s attracted to men</p>
<p>well what is</p>
<p>where is the</p>
<p>connection in his mind is it</p>
<p>a chemical door that gets open</p>
<p>is it a chromosome</p>
<p>thing is it a genetic</p>
<p>thing what is it</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>theory there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a theory</p>
<p>about homosexuality</p>
<p>and one of the one of the more interesting theories</p>
<p>was they did a</p>
<p>study in rome</p>
<p>and what they</p>
<p>found is that when</p>
<p>women are promiscuous</p>
<p>especially like</p>
<p>habitually promiscuous</p>
<p>women that constantly</p>
<p>cheat on their men</p>
<p>they have a disproportionate amount of gay sons</p>
<p>and they believe</p>
<p>that what it is is a variation of the x chromosome</p>
<p>women have double x</p>
<p>chromosome men have x y</p>
<p>and they believe that there is a variation of the x</p>
<p>chromosome among certain</p>
<p>women that makes them</p>
<p>incredibly attracted to men</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where literally</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t even fucking control themselves like</p>
<p>their their number one obsession</p>
<p>is getting new</p>
<p>dick they just want to get new dick all the time</p>
<p>and this gets</p>
<p>transferred into</p>
<p>their sons and</p>
<p>their son all the</p>
<p>sudden has this incredible</p>
<p>attraction to men wow totally makes</p>
<p>sense yeah because</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t you met girls like that</p>
<p>no you never met a girl that&rsquo;s just a fucking freak</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ve all met girls that just</p>
<p>seemingly this poor girl&rsquo;s broken</p>
<p>and she just can&rsquo;t help fucking everybody yeah you know</p>
<p>but the only way to</p>
<p>truly find out</p>
<p>if this is true is for me to take that pill</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna do it what</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist but</p>
<p>i mean this drug</p>
<p>exists no by</p>
<p>the way this one</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s one guy okay</p>
<p>how many people took it and it just cured</p>
<p>their parkinsons</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying though</p>
<p>joe no no no but that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>anything this guy is good no no no no no</p>
<p>listen it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything because look</p>
<p>how many people are addicted to peanut butter i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>i just had peanut butter and i&rsquo;m fine</p>
<p>if you give peanut butter</p>
<p>to a guy&rsquo;s addicted to peanut butter he fucking dies</p>
<p>his throat closes up he can&rsquo;t get any air in</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a biological variation in</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>and you have to take that into account what if</p>
<p>for this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for whatever and</p>
<p>weird tweak</p>
<p>he takes this</p>
<p>fucking drug and goes on a gay sex rampage you</p>
<p>might be totally right he</p>
<p>might be a freak</p>
<p>and he might be</p>
<p>just a loser</p>
<p>he lost all his</p>
<p>money and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s suing this company okay how</p>
<p>about this how</p>
<p>about this how</p>
<p>about this can i say this</p>
<p>could be how</p>
<p>about this my</p>
<p>money is i take the pill let</p>
<p>some that guy</p>
<p>right i take the pill</p>
<p>i want a gay sex</p>
<p>get on the pill i go on a gay sex rampage</p>
<p>right right how</p>
<p>about me just not taking it ever again</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just that i&rsquo;m not taking the pill</p>
<p>again this guy also lost all his</p>
<p>money yeah and gambling i</p>
<p>think that he</p>
<p>hit his bottom don&rsquo;t take the pill anymore</p>
<p>right well you you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>twelve step guy so you understand</p>
<p>about all that that shit with people in denial</p>
<p>about that shit yeah</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing when you&rsquo;re around people that are in denial</p>
<p>about what caused</p>
<p>their issues</p>
<p>right yeah and there&rsquo;s also i know that doing drugs</p>
<p>and that kind of behavior isn&rsquo;t the root of the problem</p>
<p>the root of the problem is something else</p>
<p>those are just symptoms</p>
<p>right but if a guy is</p>
<p>or has been shown to be a fine</p>
<p>upstanding human being</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s history that&rsquo;s the problem with having this</p>
<p>stupid argument</p>
<p>or this conversation rather</p>
<p>when you lose that much</p>
<p>money in gambling</p>
<p>immediately that&rsquo;s a red</p>
<p>flag to me like okay this guy&rsquo;s probably but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>until after he became</p>
<p>gone on the</p>
<p>medication they</p>
<p>started gambling</p>
<p>apparently he didn&rsquo;t gamble before that</p>
<p>gamblers are</p>
<p>often you know</p>
<p>they tell the truth</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a problem with gambling but i easily</p>
<p>could have i was terrified of it</p>
<p>when i used to play pool</p>
<p>and i used to be around a lot of gambling addicts</p>
<p>i was around a lot of them guys</p>
<p>and i see them and i</p>
<p>would say this is</p>
<p>scary shit whatever</p>
<p>you obviously gambling is fun</p>
<p>and it becomes too much of an addiction to</p>
<p>these people whatever it</p>
<p>is don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t do whatever the fuck they&rsquo;re doing can</p>

<p>would have done yeah like i would have</p>
<p>physically assaulted an american indian holy fuck man</p>
<p>i would litter for the rest of my life make them cry</p>
<p>i would have</p>
<p>freaked out about that</p>
<p>i would have</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>issue man i</p>
<p>would still be</p>
<p>fighting that</p>
<p>whole thing yeah</p>
<p>your 2009 i live through it but no what you should</p>
<p>start doing is doing a bit</p>
<p>about it on</p>
<p>stage yeah well yeah yeah that&rsquo;s a bit</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a funny bit</p>
<p>in there something in there come on man there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny bit in that</p>
<p>you know because</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m so angry</p>
<p>they can take your fucking money</p>
<p>they had no problem with you gambling yeah so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re risking your</p>
<p>money but you can&rsquo;t get a</p>
<p>you know what you</p>
<p>should have done you</p>
<p>should have got</p>
<p>wait did he</p>
<p>print out a 2 000</p>
<p>ticket or you know because here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it is okay if you win you know at a slot machine</p>
<p>right out you get a</p>
<p>ticket right</p>
<p>anything other over 1200 right</p>
<p>that you win</p>
<p>is considered a jackpot</p>
<p>okay so they have to come out so then they have to</p>
<p>fill out irs forms into this that if i just would have</p>
<p>let made less than 8 800</p>
<p>less then i</p>
<p>would have been able to take my money</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>and then you know what i</p>
<p>would i mean i</p>
<p>would have had a good time i would have</p>
<p>spent it at the casino anyway</p>
<p>they would have had it in the end</p>
<p>then i would</p>
<p>have gone to a higher machine you know what i mean</p>
<p>i just want a good time</p>
<p>or put it back in the community</p>
<p>yeah or something like that</p>
<p>i always want to say it like that</p>
<p>the community</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucked up what is it</p>
<p>about black people</p>
<p>that they say community like that they see a lot of</p>
<p>things we look like</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s a big one community community</p>
<p>put it back in the community yeah they say that yeah</p>
<p>so so what happened</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no way you can get this</p>
<p>money back to this is gone you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>writing it off as a loss you got to do a bit about this</p>
<p>brown yeah i will but the</p>
<p>thing is is that</p>
<p>i called joel</p>
<p>how can he help you</p>
<p>well he owns the improv</p>
<p>right he has</p>
<p>a relationship with the hard one what did they say</p>
<p>joseph there&rsquo;s nothing i can do</p>
<p>yeah man and i&rsquo;m like but it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense because they know me</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about you now at</p>
<p>least you know</p>
<p>what the deal is oh i know what the deal is now</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also probably a rule that they can&rsquo;t circumvent</p>
<p>i mean who you&rsquo;re talking to is probably a guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going by corporate bylines and this is the rules</p>
<p>person doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>driver&rsquo;s license</p>
<p>i mean even though they know you they have to</p>
<p>kinda assume like who the fuck you</p>
<p>know if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write down a</p>
<p>valid driver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>license in the receipt</p>
<p>so that you can get taxed on it it just seems that they</p>
<p>should be able to hold it for you</p>
<p>like it seems like yeah you won</p>
<p>you have credit</p>
<p>2 000 credit you come back here with your license</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give you the fucking</p>
<p>money but until then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re holding it for you</p>
<p>yeah it seems like that&rsquo;s what casinos do anyways</p>
<p>cause they have</p>
<p>you know you go there like your jay z and</p>
<p>stuff like that you have like a</p>
<p>you know like almost a bank account with</p>
<p>these people your jay z</p>
<p>do you know what i thought</p>
<p>you know what i mean yeah you know what i</p>
<p>so i bet you can get your 2 000 no</p>
<p>i googled i</p>
<p>googled my name</p>
<p>googled your name in</p>
<p>front of them</p>
<p>like an asshole</p>
<p>oh did you really yeah i go listen i play this place</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a headliner</p>
<p>right googled your name yeah</p>
<p>and there was a</p>
<p>computer there</p>
<p>and i google</p>
<p>right and it went to my wikipedia page</p>
<p>right i went to my wikipedia i go</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my picture</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my birthday</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m almost forty</p>
<p>right you know i mean</p>
<p>because i had no idea</p>
<p>what i don&rsquo;t know what else to do</p>
<p>right right but they say</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t give a shit</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t care no hmm</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>a scam to me and news is in</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>you this who&rsquo;s the person saying it some american</p>
<p>india with beads in his hair you know what i mean</p>
<p>and he was upset at you or no it was just</p>
<p>basically just really cool</p>
<p>about him just like</p>
<p>i know who you are</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so sorry</p>
<p>these are the rules</p>
<p>well i guess</p>
<p>those are the rules</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the rules now you gotta</p>
<p>write a bit</p>
<p>about it i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>yeah you have to i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>make a 2 000 bet</p>
<p>makes me so fucking mad</p>
<p>that makes me mad</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need the</p>
<p>money i just it&rsquo;s just the principle of yeah</p>
<p>absolutely you mean i made i did it</p>
<p>yeah but it does make</p>
<p>sense i mean it does make</p>
<p>sense that they can&rsquo;t they can&rsquo;t hook you up kind to me</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it not to me no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense because joe if i work</p>
<p>i basically</p>
<p>work for that casino</p>
<p>sort of you work for joel</p>
<p>i work for joel</p>
<p>but he has a</p>
<p>relationship with them and it&rsquo;s not like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>play there every week you know i mean</p>
<p>you just sort of rents there</p>
<p>right he does rent</p>
<p>a rule you rent the rooms there</p>
<p>but you you</p>
<p>understand what i&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s like in a</p>
<p>sense i give them business</p>
<p>right you know i mean do you like</p>
<p>going on the road do you dig it</p>
<p>in some places yes some of them are</p>
<p>like i want to kill myself</p>
<p>for a long time you didn&rsquo;t go on i refuse to do it</p>
<p>yeah because remember when we were back in</p>
<p>when i was doing the</p>
<p>store we would talk</p>
<p>about it all the time you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t going i refuse to do it</p>
<p>and then we were somewhere recently like i</p>
<p>think it was san jose</p>
<p>and they would say yeah</p>
<p>bobby lee was just here pack the</p>
<p>place yeah yeah i was like damn</p>
<p>bobby lee that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only reason</p>
<p>now i go because when i used to go the road before</p>
<p>no one would come</p>
<p>right what changed that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know it was</p>
<p>it well here&rsquo;s what it was i</p>
<p>would go to a</p>
<p>market now what my</p>
<p>thing is is i go to a market</p>
<p>first and at first</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>know me or if they do they don&rsquo;t know that i do</p>
<p>stand up right</p>
<p>right so i do a weekend</p>
<p>for pretty much for free they give you a guarantee</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>second time back</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always better because i know that i deliver and</p>
<p>right you know what i mean</p>
<p>my show is good you know what i mean</p>
<p>and so the people that saw you they come to you they</p>
<p>bring more people than the</p>
<p>radio i love</p>
<p>radio well you come back like if you</p>
<p>say you do a gig how long before you come back a year</p>
<p>a year yeah</p>
<p>yeah and how much of your material will be new</p>
<p>in that year</p>
<p>maybe and i&rsquo;ll be honest with you not as much as</p>
<p>maybe the next guy but</p>
<p>about 10 15 minutes</p>
<p>10 15 must be</p>
<p>new in a year really</p>
<p>yeah because i&rsquo;m not that prolific</p>
<p>really but the</p>
<p>thing is here&rsquo;s the good</p>
<p>thing is is that</p>
<p>a lot of my</p>
<p>stuff now is improvised like</p>
<p>i have moments of just playing with the audience yeah</p>
<p>a lot of that</p>
<p>right and also my</p>
<p>thing is there&rsquo;s an element of</p>
<p>crazy in my show where</p>
<p>i usually go in the audience and i do</p>
<p>crazy shit like what</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>like if somebody will get up to go to the bathroom i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>chase them out of the room</p>
<p>and follow them</p>
<p>to the bathroom really yeah and then i&rsquo;ll yeah</p>
<p>while the audience is</p>
<p>they love it</p>
<p>yeah yeah i mean and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>pull my pants down i&rsquo;ll be my</p>
<p>underwear i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>fall them into the bathroom have you ever gotten in</p>
<p>trouble for pulling your</p>
<p>pants down at</p>

<p>the music was playing and i got were you on parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>medication no</p>
<p>and i got naked and i had a sack</p>

<p>homophobic really right</p>
<p>so there was the</p>
<p>music&rsquo;s playing and i jump on top of them</p>
<p>oh by literally</p>
<p>sitting on the stool</p>
<p>he literally picked my body</p>
<p>and threw me</p>
<p>to the ground</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>and i hit the ground you know me on my back</p>
<p>and i got knocked conscious for like a</p>
<p>split second</p>
<p>you know you hear</p>
<p>like stars did you hit your head no</p>
<p>but i heard wee wee</p>
<p>so what hit that made you see stars like that</p>
<p>i hit my back and my head</p>
<p>maybe a little bit</p>
<p>maybe your head</p>
<p>a little yeah but i also took the wind out of my body</p>
<p>right okay right so i</p>
<p>hit wee wee</p>
<p>right you like</p>
<p>jack yeah i got jack</p>
<p>and i jumped on top</p>
<p>you jumped on</p>
<p>him yeah because</p>
<p>you do that because nothing</p>
<p>he that he just took it because</p>
<p>the thing got a</p>
<p>laugh when he</p>
<p>threw me off of me</p>
<p>he got a laugh he got a</p>
<p>laugh so he</p>
<p>enjoyed it and i</p>
<p>stood back out and</p>
<p>i looked in his eyes</p>
<p>and he kinda went</p>
<p>he kinda liked the</p>
<p>laugh right so i did it</p>
<p>again right</p>
<p>cause he got addicted to the laugh</p>
<p>right because at</p>
<p>first it was hatred</p>
<p>right like get off me gook</p>
<p>you know kind of</p>
<p>whoa i don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s what he said</p>

<p>said but in the eyes i can tell that there was</p>
<p>get off me goop</p>
<p>so that when i</p>
<p>fell down we connected and i&rsquo;m like okay i can do it</p>
<p>again wow like a sense</p>
<p>right a sense</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the worst</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s around that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>right when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ad libbing with someone you don&rsquo;t know exactly</p>
<p>where this is</p>
<p>gonna go that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting you know it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>right yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also to you and i both came up in the</p>
<p>store and the</p>
<p>store we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this so many times in the podcast the</p>
<p>store for all its terrible qualities</p>
<p>the best thing</p>
<p>about it is the fact that no one was paying attention</p>
<p>ever there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>crowd control there&rsquo;s no one</p>
<p>the comics are forced to take care of</p>
<p>audiences themselves and sometimes you just deal with</p>
<p>incredibly hostile audiences</p>
<p>yeah yeah i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never worked at a club consistently</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s more insane shit happening</p>
<p>and people say like i hear</p>
<p>other comments go yeah this</p>
<p>tough room is tough</p>
<p>i go you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>not you don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah they don&rsquo;t even know if they</p>
<p>work the store like there&rsquo;s so many people that like</p>
<p>to go yeah the</p>
<p>place is evil i know i don&rsquo;t do the</p>
<p>store the store is evil</p>
<p>it is yes it is</p>
<p>but i would</p>
<p>say evil not there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some there&rsquo;s a quality of evil to it i</p>
<p>think that quality</p>
<p>is because the fact that it&rsquo;s searose</p>
<p>nightclub the fact that it was</p>
<p>bugsy seagulls</p>
<p>place you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>past the fact that people were murdered in that place</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s also has to do with the</p>
<p>color of the building</p>
<p>yeah i really</p>
<p>believe you know how they</p>
<p>say you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>paint your walls in your bedroom red like</p>
<p>blood red because psychologically it&rsquo;s not good for you</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>it makes you</p>
<p>angry it makes you</p>
<p>angry like silver too i try to</p>
<p>paint my room silver ones</p>
<p>and they go it&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trapped in a</p>
<p>you know main</p>
<p>spaceship i feel like</p>
<p>black you know like in a cage</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what it does i was</p>
<p>thinking of</p>
<p>painting these walls</p>
<p>black no you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>okay for a podcast</p>
<p>i would perfect</p>
<p>see this is the</p>
<p>color what walls but</p>
<p>these are neutral</p>
<p>colors yeah</p>
<p>these are nice relaxing i</p>
<p>feel very good</p>
<p>right now do you feel good yeah i feel like this is the</p>
<p>color i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>leave it here just for you bro like</p>
<p>like coffee it took</p>
<p>so long to get you on the podcast i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna leave</p>
<p>these and the reason why that was the case</p>
<p>right oh no no i know it was because i just was</p>
<p>yeah things</p>
<p>going on you know right</p>
<p>dude just look</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m as flaky as the next guy but the</p>
<p>store why don&rsquo;t you come back</p>
<p>come back where the</p>
<p>store no never</p>
<p>never i can&rsquo;t why</p>
<p>because i like the improv better</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no negativity there</p>
<p>the improv everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so super courteous though the</p>
<p>staff there are so friendly and and</p>
<p>thankful and kind</p>
<p>for years he dealt with at the store</p>
<p>them pretending that the</p>
<p>store was the star and you were</p>
<p>lucky to work there you were</p>
<p>lucky to help out no matter what you did you could</p>
<p>never do enough it was an energy when you were there</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m not even i</p>
<p>bring it everywhere else</p>
<p>i know but i&rsquo;m saying that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>because i used to either go up before</p>
<p>after you in the</p>
<p>studio right</p>
<p>it was hard to go up</p>
<p>after you but it sometimes it</p>
<p>would put me up after you</p>
<p>but there was</p>
<p>still an energy in the</p>
<p>or i swear to god</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than it is now not that that we don&rsquo;t get an audience</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different kind of vibe</p>
<p>you know well i was</p>
<p>bringing yeah</p>
<p>my specific</p>
<p>thoughts on comedy</p>
<p>my specific thoughts on life is let&rsquo;s have fun</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not take</p>
<p>things so fucking seriously let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>look at all this shit but let&rsquo;s be nice to each other</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s have a good fucking time yeah yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why one of the reasons why whenever anything</p>
<p>crazy would happen at the</p>
<p>store i would always make it a big</p>
<p>point to buy everyone in the audience a drink</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>when i kick somebody out</p>
<p>i mean i did that out</p>
<p>like a dozen times yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>i would kick people out and then i</p>
<p>would spend</p>
<p>thousands of dollars</p>
<p>buying 300 people drinks</p>
<p>you know yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s but what why</p>
<p>did you why did you</p>
<p>leave in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not mitzi sure&rsquo;s club anymore</p>
<p>see the whole</p>
<p>thing that happened was when the monsea</p>
<p>shit went down i called mitzi</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the owner of the club</p>
<p>and mitzi and i</p>
<p>about a relationship way back to 1994 when i</p>
<p>first met her when i</p>
<p>first came to hollywood and</p>
<p>to me she was</p>
<p>the queen of comedy</p>
<p>man the comedy</p>
<p>store was mecca to me</p>
<p>to me it was more important and this is not bullshit</p>
<p>to get past as a paid regular at the</p>
<p>store than it was the fact that i was on a sitcom</p>
<p>in california</p>
<p>i was on the sitcom and i was like</p>
<p>acting sucks</p>
<p>you know is a lot of</p>
<p>money i was making all this</p>
<p>money but i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m a fucking paid regular at the</p>
<p>store like holy shit</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t believe i was there i mean this is where</p>
<p>richard pryor had</p>
<p>started out and</p>
<p>david letterman</p>
<p>was there and kennison was there and all these</p>
<p>hicks had worked there for a while</p>
<p>so to me it was like all this history</p>
<p>so i mean not only had i worked there for free for all</p>
<p>those years</p>
<p>where i was on</p>
<p>fear factor</p>
<p>they put my name up on the marquee</p>
<p>it would say you know fear factor</p>
<p>is joe rogan</p>
<p>pack the place we</p>
<p>would promote</p>
<p>it on myspace</p>
<p>and to me it was just</p>
<p>i was just it was a workout room</p>
<p>i would get to fuck around and stay sharp do</p>
<p>a long set each friday and saturday</p>
<p>night so when i</p>
<p>would go on the road i always had material</p>
<p>i could still do specials and</p>
<p>still do fear factor at</p>
<p>the same time so it was a perfect situation for me and</p>
<p>i could help the</p>
<p>store i worked for free</p>
<p>and as a matter of fact even</p>
<p>money that they</p>
<p>owed me from years ago</p>
<p>i paid it back in the form of a tax free donation</p>
<p>and then i paid for the</p>
<p>whole sound</p>
<p>system into play yeah yeah you did i took out the</p>
<p>speakers i put in</p>
<p>a cd r burner</p>
<p>and a fucking</p>
<p>dat player and new</p>
<p>microphones and new</p>
<p>chords a whole deal right</p>
<p>and then when this</p>
<p>whole thing happened with monsea</p>
<p>which they knew</p>
<p>for the longest</p>
<p>time what he was doing everybody knew what he was doing</p>
<p>but they were making</p>
<p>money off of it so they turned a</p>
<p>blind eye towards comedy</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;ve always said was that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the business</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>agent or if you&rsquo;re a manager</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re a club owner</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re selling art</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and when you got one person who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stealing the art of the people that you&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>and then selling it again</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cannibalizing</p>
<p>you have to put a foot down and stop that</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t if you say</p>
<p>crazy shit like well</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s business and he&rsquo;s making a lot of money</p>
<p>well then you</p>

<p>man man man</p>
<p>man manci&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>confused manci</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know the fact</p>
<p>so it to me it was very</p>
<p>clear that there was like some situation</p>
<p>mitzi was no</p>
<p>longer making the decisions it was no longer her club</p>
<p>so there was</p>
<p>some other people whoever the fuck they are</p>
<p>tommy was at the mouthpiece</p>
<p>of whoever the fuck was making the decision and</p>
<p>clearly they had made a decision to go and</p>
<p>have mensea</p>
<p>headlined that weekend</p>
<p>and make a big deal out of it and he was on the radio</p>
<p>it was like for him to try to save face</p>
<p>and then have me banned</p>
<p>and so i said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never coming back</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you this</p>
<p>right now this is it i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never coming back</p>
<p>and so that was years ago and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never come back</p>
<p>but i it was</p>
<p>the best thing for me because</p>
<p>after i left there and then i</p>
<p>started working out at the improv my god</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so friendly here yeah</p>
<p>yeah the vibe is so much better yeah everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happy there the managers are</p>
<p>happy the comics are all it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a cool bar area</p>
<p>where everybody hangs out</p>
<p>yeah and then i</p>
<p>started doing sals and</p>
<p>more recently and just</p>
<p>you know what man i</p>
<p>just realized that there&rsquo;s comedy clubs out there that</p>
<p>appreciate comics</p>
<p>those are the only people that</p>
<p>you should hang out with i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thankful for my time at the store</p>
<p>i learned a lot there i</p>
<p>learned a lot about</p>
<p>hecklers and dealing bullshit and i</p>
<p>learned a lot</p>
<p>about i just</p>
<p>learned a lot</p>
<p>about the business from this whole</p>
<p>thing that happened</p>
<p>from getting fucked over</p>
<p>so for me it was</p>
<p>it was the best</p>
<p>thing the americas got better</p>
<p>tommy didn&rsquo;t go to anybody by the way</p>
<p>i think it was all him yeah i</p>
<p>mean tommy and i</p>
<p>whatever i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a regular there i get spots anytime i want to and</p>
<p>tommy is a friend i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never called them awful</p>
<p>the job i call him for</p>
<p>spots i mean</p>
<p>but i know that he makes decisions</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure he does but not that one</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t believe or he</p>
<p>or this happened</p>
<p>he went to mitsy</p>
<p>and he he didn&rsquo;t go to</p>

<p>people there</p>

<p>after them so it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>let me tell</p>
<p>you something dude it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m from that room</p>
<p>right right and i</p>
<p>started when were fred burns</p>
<p>sure yeah back when fred was running it</p>
<p>did fred die he died</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>um you know he</p>
<p>you know he had spinal bifida</p>
<p>yeah and his parents</p>
<p>were still alive and they took him on a cruise</p>
<p>like a cruise to go to the baja</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where they went right</p>
<p>and they told fred one</p>
<p>night they go fred</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;ll meet you down here at eight</p>
<p>for breakfast</p>
<p>fred burns goes all</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>and he never showed up to breakfast</p>
<p>and they opened up his room and he was dead wow just i</p>
<p>failure yeah failure</p>
<p>heart failure</p>
<p>body failure whatever it was</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awful that was he was a interesting guy he got</p>
<p>fired right for something no nothing nothing</p>
<p>but the family is</p>
<p>crazy man i mean</p>
<p>look i got no ill feelings for the</p>
<p>store i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the most interesting clubs in the country and i</p>
<p>think i learned a lot doing</p>
<p>stand up there but</p>
<p>the whole point of the</p>
<p>whole situation the</p>
<p>whole point of the</p>
<p>whole mensia</p>
<p>altercation</p>
<p>was supposedly to create a better environment to</p>
<p>stop someone who was</p>
<p>victimizing</p>
<p>other comedians</p>
<p>and when the</p>
<p>club supports that you can&rsquo;t support the club anymore</p>
<p>you know if the club supports that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a gray</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a gray area everybody knew what was</p>
<p>going on i know</p>
<p>everybody complained for years and years so</p>
<p>that decision the decision they made was like the worst</p>
<p>possible decision</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no way i</p>
<p>could go back there yeah</p>
<p>i mean it just</p>
<p>sucks the fact that like you know like bill burr</p>
<p>will show up and if mensee</p>
<p>is there he won&rsquo;t go up yeah i mean</p>
<p>those little</p>
<p>things you know i mean that</p>
<p>could fuck up</p>
<p>you know i love the</p>
<p>store you know it&rsquo;s like home you</p>
<p>could go up</p>
<p>right in front of minsea now it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>toothless now he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got no claws well it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s all over so sad</p>
<p>did you see the i am comic</p>
<p>what he said in that</p>
<p>movie no you</p>
<p>gotta see that that will open your mind</p>
<p>or open your eyes</p>
<p>dude i just fucked up listen</p>
<p>i just did a benefit with him a</p>
<p>month a month ago</p>
<p>your mean for the police the police force</p>
<p>right you know i mean</p>
<p>and you know i all the long as i&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>carlos he has</p>
<p>never did drugs or</p>
<p>drank that&rsquo;s a big thing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need it you know i mean right</p>
<p>natural high right</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know smoking pot</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll probably help him</p>
<p>yeah maybe maybe</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just i can just tell he&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>yeah your man well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and as a friend can&rsquo;t victimize</p>
<p>a friend you know you watch it and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i always try to play</p>
<p>call of duty with him on xbox because i feel bad</p>
<p>i always send him a friend</p>
<p>you feel bad so you want to kill him</p>
<p>yeah fuck up</p>
<p>listen man the positive aspects of working at the</p>
<p>store were so true</p>
<p>i mean i know what you say i just</p>
<p>think you should i</p>
<p>think you should just do it one</p>
<p>night or something no</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do it please it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never be the same</p>
<p>again how do you know</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;ll never be</p>
<p>what it used to be what it used to be was a lot of fun</p>
<p>it was used to be we look</p>
<p>there was a long time</p>
<p>where i was at the</p>
<p>store with a</p>
<p>store felt like</p>
<p>it did not have the environment that i envisioned</p>
<p>i always envisioned it being like i said comedy mecca</p>
<p>i was envisioned there&rsquo;s all these</p>
<p>great comics are</p>
<p>gonna perform there and this is</p>
<p>great environment</p>
<p>and then for a long time when i was there in like the</p>
<p>early 90s you know it wasn&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>should i say</p>
<p>i would tell defend it in a sense okay</p>
<p>since you left</p>
<p>it has changed</p>
<p>in this sense okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting a lot more new york guys on the list</p>
<p>right so you have bill burr</p>
<p>david off you know</p>
<p>all these new york guys</p>
<p>that moved here okay</p>
<p>sarah silverman was there yeah and the lineups like</p>
<p>the other night but who was it</p>
<p>rock and chappelle did they go up but they showed up</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s a different new york vibe</p>
<p>and what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>is this okay from two years ago that you were there</p>
<p>carlos never goes it&rsquo;s not carlos man</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>who run the club i know it&rsquo;s time whoever is running</p>
<p>club is the same people run in the club</p>
<p>i know tommy said some</p>
<p>stupid shit to</p>
<p>brian just the</p>
<p>other day when he went there and he called me a fag</p>
<p>tommy tommy&rsquo;s retarded</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a ding dong</p>
<p>that dude it was always</p>
<p>gonna be what he is you know</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s not this</p>
<p>what a comedy</p>
<p>store is is an idea okay</p>
<p>the idea is that there&rsquo;s this this mecca</p>
<p>of comedy where everybody&rsquo;s hanging out</p>
<p>crazy be like like that back</p>
<p>porch area yeah back parking lot</p>
<p>how much fucking fun did we have back there so much</p>
<p>craziness and hilarity</p>
<p>the greatest moments of my life have been</p>
<p>hilarious moments yeah yeah</p>
<p>just always everybody was doing something</p>
<p>funny joey diaz has got his fucking pants down</p>
<p>it was crazy</p>
<p>always something</p>
<p>chaos and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>crazy people coming back there and hanging out with</p>
<p>us and you don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>the fuck they are and who&rsquo;s this guy&rsquo;s guys nuts and he</p>
<p>thinks he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>angel and yeah</p>
<p>dress up as</p>
<p>jesus that hangs out there</p>
<p>jesus yeah the</p>
<p>cross the walks down down</p>
<p>sunset with</p>
<p>the fucking cross</p>
<p>like colonel sanders have you seen that yeah</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>colonel sanders yeah</p>
<p>that jesus and him together</p>
<p>are always the best combo</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting an argument you&rsquo;re like what are they</p>
<p>fighting about</p>
<p>the lord are</p>
<p>just crazier</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>that place is</p>
<p>awesome you know and but the idea of what the comedy</p>
<p>story is you</p>
<p>bring that everywhere with you man i bring that</p>
<p>everywhere on the road i</p>
<p>bring that everywhere</p>
<p>where i do stand up</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s is a perfect example what is</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s comedy hole</p>
<p>is this new</p>
<p>place that opened up on melrose is a guy from new york</p>
<p>he had a place on la brea</p>
<p>for a while but they had like a</p>
<p>liquor license</p>
<p>issue and now he reopened a new place</p>
<p>the fucking guy is</p>
<p>great he&rsquo;s got open mics like almost</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>super supportive of comedians</p>
<p>just wants people</p>
<p>to calm down he&rsquo;s always trying to feed you give you</p>
<p>drinks and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super consistently nice</p>
<p>really nice guy who loves comedy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to make a good comedy club okay</p>
<p>and because of that</p>
<p>comics are flocking to this</p>
<p>place diaz does it all the time</p>
<p>ari does it</p>
<p>brian does it all the time</p>
<p>really tonight his show</p>
<p>will have at</p>
<p>least 50 60</p>

<p>you can pack the</p>
<p>place yeah yeah it&rsquo;s super</p>
<p>sweet that&rsquo;s why</p>

<p>a new room maybe</p>
<p>when you go to the improv</p>
<p>and you go to</p>
<p>places like south</p>
<p>you realize okay well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>places that don&rsquo;t have this</p>
<p>crazy attitude that</p>
<p>the place is the star</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>tommy always had this attitude that the store</p>
<p>is the star and so did</p>
<p>remember who&rsquo;s the guy</p>
<p>who fucking</p>
<p>who used to run it</p>
<p>scott day remember</p>
<p>scott i love</p>

<p>the longest time</p>
<p>and he had to quit</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t want to be on pauly</p>
<p>shore&rsquo;s reality show</p>
<p>yeah yeah they wanted to put it on the reality</p>
<p>show and it was</p>
<p>so fun it was like</p>
<p>what the improv</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have though that the</p>
<p>store has is that wild west vibe</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>and that create</p>
<p>no because it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t go over the light</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s rules and that so you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>run across the</p>
<p>place in my</p>
<p>underwear if i want to</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>but at the store there&rsquo;s always</p>
