    <p>The following is a conversation with Yaron Brook,</p>
<p>one of the best known objectivist philosophers</p>
<p>and thinkers in the world.</p>
<p>Objectivism is the philosophical system developed by Ayn Rand</p>
<p>that she first expressed in her fiction books,</p>
<p>The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>and later in nonfiction essays and books.</p>
<p>Yaron is the current chairman of the board</p>
<p>at the Ayn Rand Institute, host of the Yaron Brook Show,</p>
<p>and the coauthor of Free Market Revolution,</p>
<p>Equal is Unfair, and several other books</p>
<p>where he analyzes systems of government, human behavior,</p>
<p>and the human condition from the perspective of objectivism.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that I first read Atlas Shrugged</p>
<p>and The Fountainhead early in college,</p>
<p>along with many other literary and philosophical works</p>
<p>from Nietzsche, Heidegger, Kant, Locke, Foucault,</p>
<p>Wittgenstein, and of course, all the great existentialists</p>
<p>from Kierkegaard to Camus.</p>
<p>I always had an open mind, curious to learn</p>
<p>and explore the ideas of thinkers throughout history,</p>
<p>no matter how mundane or radical</p>
<p>or even dangerous they were considered to be.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand was, and I think still is, a divisive figure.</p>
<p>Some people love her, some people dislike</p>
<p>or even dismiss her.</p>
<p>I prefer to look past what some may consider</p>
<p>to be the flaws of the person</p>
<p>and consider with an open mind the ideas she presents</p>
<p>and Jaron now describes and applies</p>
<p>in his philosophical discussions.</p>
<p>In general, I hope that you will be patient</p>
<p>and understanding as I venture out across the space of ideas</p>
<p>and the ever widening Overton window,</p>
<p>pulling at the thread of curiosity,</p>
<p>sometimes saying stupid things,</p>
<p>but always striving to understand</p>
<p>how we can better build a better world together.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jaron Rook.</p>
<p>Let me ask the biggest possible question first.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What are the principles of a life well lived?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s to live with thought,</p>
<p>that is to live a rational life, to think it through.</p>
<p>I think so many people are in a sense zombies out there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re alive, but they&rsquo;re not really alive</p>
<p>because their mind is not focused,</p>
<p>their mind is not focused on what do I need to do</p>
<p>in order to live a great life?</p>
<p>So too many people just go through the motions</p>
<p>of living rather than really embrace life.</p>
<p>So I think the secret to living a great life</p>
<p>is to take it seriously.</p>
<p>And what it means to take it seriously</p>
<p>is to use the one tool that makes us human,</p>
<p>the one tool that provides us with all the values</p>
<p>that we have, our mind, our reason,</p>
<p>and to use it, apply it to living.</p>
<p>People apply it to their work,</p>
<p>they apply it to their math problems,</p>
<p>to science, to programming.</p>
<p>But imagine if they used that same energy,</p>
<p>that same focus, that same concentration</p>
<p>to actually living life and choosing values</p>
<p>that they should pursue,</p>
<p>that would change the world,</p>
<p>and it would change their lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, I wear this silly suit and tie.</p>
<p>It symbolizes to me always,</p>
<p>it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m taking the moment really seriously.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And each one of us has different ways</p>
<p>to kind of condition our consciousness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious now, and for you, it&rsquo;s a suit and tie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conditioning of your consciousness</p>
<p>to now I&rsquo;m focused, now I&rsquo;m at work,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m doing my thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s terrific,</p>
<p>and I wish everybody took that.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, it&rsquo;s a cliche, but we only live once.</p>
<p>Every minute of your life, you&rsquo;re never gonna live again.</p>
<p>This is really valuable.</p>
<p>And when people don&rsquo;t have that deep respect</p>
<p>for their own life, for their own time, for their own mind,</p>
<p>and if they did, again, one could only imagine,</p>
<p>look at how productive people are.</p>
<p>Look at the amazing things they produce</p>
<p>and they do in their work.</p>
<p>And if they applied that to everything, wow.</p>
<p>So you kind of talk about reason.</p>
<p>Where does the kind of existentialist idea</p>
<p>of experience maybe, fully experiencing all the moments</p>
<p>versus fully thinking through?</p>
<p>Is there an interesting line to separate the two?</p>
<p>Why such an emphasis on reason for a life well lived</p>
<p>versus just enjoy, like experience the moment?</p>
<p>Well, because I think experience in a sense</p>
<p>is the easy part.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s how we experience the life that we live.</p>
<p>And yes, I&rsquo;m all with the take time to value what you value,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the problem of people out there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the problem is they&rsquo;re not taking time</p>
<p>to appreciate where they are and what they do.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t use their mind</p>
<p>in this one respect, in planning their life,</p>
<p>in thinking about how to live.</p>
<p>So the focus is on reason is because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our only source of knowledge.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other source of knowledge.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know anything that does not come</p>
<p>from our senses and our mind,</p>
<p>the integration of the evidence of our senses.</p>
<p>Now we know stuff about ourselves</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s important to know oneself</p>
<p>through introspection.</p>
<p>And I consider that part of reasoning is to introspect.</p>
<p>But I think reason is undervalued, which is funny to say,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s our means of survival.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how human beings survive.</p>
<p>We cannot, see, this is why I disagree</p>
<p>with so many scientists and people like Sam Harris.</p>
<p>You mentioned Sam Harris before the show.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not programmed to know how to hunt.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not programmed to do agriculture.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not programmed to build computers</p>
<p>and build networks on which we can podcast</p>
<p>and do our shows.</p>
<p>All of that requires effort.</p>
<p>It requires focus.</p>
<p>It requires energy and it requires will.</p>
<p>It requires somebody to will it.</p>
<p>It requires somebody to choose it.</p>
<p>And once you make that choice,</p>
<p>you have to engage that choice means</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re choosing to engage your reason</p>
<p>in discovery, in integration,</p>
<p>and then in work to change the world in which we live.</p>
<p>And human beings have to discover,</p>
<p>figure out, solve the problem of hunting.</p>
<p>Hunting, everybody thinks, oh, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the movie.</p>
<p>But human beings had to figure out how to do it, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t run down a bison and bite into it, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna catch it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna, you have no fangs to bite into it.</p>
<p>You have to build weapons.</p>
<p>You have to build tools.</p>
<p>You have to create traps.</p>
<p>You have to have a strategy.</p>
<p>All of that requires reason.</p>
<p>So the most important thing that allows human beings</p>
<p>to survive and to thrive in every value</p>
<p>from the most simple to the most sophisticated,</p>
<p>from the most material to, I believe, the most spiritual,</p>
<p>requires thinking.</p>
<p>So stopping and appreciating the moment</p>
<p>is something that I think is relatively easy</p>
<p>once you have a plan, once you&rsquo;ve thought it through,</p>
<p>once you know what your values are.</p>
<p>There is a mistake people make.</p>
<p>They attain their values and they don&rsquo;t take a moment</p>
<p>to savor that and to appreciate that</p>
<p>and to even pat themselves on the back that they did it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s screwing up the world.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s screwing up the world</p>
<p>is that people have the wrong values</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t think about them</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really focus on them</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have a plan for their own life</p>
<p>and how to live it.</p>
<p>If we look at human nature,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying the fundamental big thing</p>
<p>that we need to consider is our capacity,</p>
<p>like a capability to reason.</p>
<p>So to me, reason is this massive evolutionary achievement</p>
<p>in quotes.</p>
<p>If you think about any other sophisticated animal,</p>
<p>everything has to be coded.</p>
<p>Everything has to be written in the hard way.</p>
<p>It has to be there.</p>
<p>And they have to have a solution for every outcome.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s no solution, the animal dies typically,</p>
<p>or the animal suffers in some way.</p>
<p>Human beings have this capacity to self program.</p>
<p>They have this capacity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a tabula rasa in the sense</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>Obviously, we have a nature.</p>
<p>Obviously, our minds, our brains</p>
<p>are structured in a particular way.</p>
<p>But given that, we have the ability</p>
<p>to turn it on or turn it off.</p>
<p>We have the ability to commit suicide,</p>
<p>to reject our nature, to work against our interests,</p>
<p>not to use the tool that evolution has provided us,</p>
<p>which is this mind, which is reason.</p>
<p>So that choice, that fundamental choice,</p>
<p>you know, Hamlet says it, right, to be or not to be.</p>
<p>But to be or not to be is to think or not to think,</p>
<p>to engage or not to engage, to focus or not to focus.</p>
<p>You know, in the morning when you get up,</p>
<p>you kind of, you know, you&rsquo;re not really completely there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of out of focus and stuff.</p>
<p>It requires an act of will to say,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m awake, I&rsquo;ve got stuff to do.</p>
<p>Some people never do that.</p>
<p>Some people live in that haze,</p>
<p>and they never engage that mind.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re sitting and try to solve</p>
<p>a complex computer problem or math problem,</p>
<p>you have to turn something on.</p>
<p>You have to, in a sense, exert certain energy</p>
<p>to focus on the problem to do it.</p>
<p>And that is not determined in a sense</p>
<p>that you have to focus.</p>
<p>You choose to focus, and you could choose not to focus.</p>
<p>And that choice is more powerful than any other,</p>
<p>like, parts of our brain that we&rsquo;ve borrowed from fish</p>
<p>and from our evolutionary origins.</p>
<p>Like this, whatever this crazy little leap in evolution is</p>
<p>that allowed us to think is more powerful than anything else.</p>
<p>So I think neuroscientists pretend they know a lot more</p>
<p>about the brain than they really do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that we know. Shots fired.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know that much yet</p>
<p>about how the brain functions and what&rsquo;s a fish</p>
<p>and what, you know, all this stuff.</p>
<p>So I think what exists there</p>
<p>is a lot of potentialities.</p>
<p>But the beauty of the human brain is it&rsquo;s potentialities</p>
<p>that we have to manifest through our choices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there. It&rsquo;s sitting there.</p>
<p>And, yes, there&rsquo;s certain things</p>
<p>that are going to evoke certain senses, certain feelings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even saying emotions</p>
<p>because I think emotions are too complex</p>
<p>to have been programmed into our mind.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s this big issue of evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>is huge right now and it&rsquo;s a big issue.</p>
<p>You know, I find it to a large extent as way too early</p>
<p>and in storytelling about expo storytelling about stuff.</p>
<p>We still don&rsquo;t, you know, so for example,</p>
<p>I would like to see if evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>differentiate between things like inclinations,</p>
<p>feelings, emotions, sensations, thoughts, concepts, ideas.</p>
<p>What of those are programmed and what of those are developed</p>
<p>and chosen and a product of reason?</p>
<p>I think anything from emotion to abstract ideas is all chosen,</p>
<p>is all a product of reason.</p>
<p>And everything before that, we might have been programmed for.</p>
<p>But the fact is so clearly a sensation is not a product of,</p>
<p>you know, is something that we feel</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how our biology works.</p>
<p>So until we have these categories</p>
<p>and until we can clearly specify what is what</p>
<p>and where do they come from,</p>
<p>the whole discussion in evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>seems to be rambling.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be scientific.</p>
<p>So we have to define our terms, you know,</p>
<p>which is the basis of science.</p>
<p>You have to have some clear definitions</p>
<p>about what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>When you ask them these questions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never really a coherent answer</p>
<p>about what is it exactly.</p>
<p>And everybody is afraid of the issue of free will.</p>
<p>And I think to some extent, I mean, Harris has this,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to misrepresent anything Harris has</p>
<p>because, you know, I&rsquo;m a fan and I like a lot of his stuff.</p>
<p>But on the one hand, he is obviously intellectually active</p>
<p>and wants to change our minds.</p>
<p>So he believes that we have some capacity to choose.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he&rsquo;s undermining that capacity</p>
<p>to choose by saying it&rsquo;s just determines</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna choose what you choose.</p>
<p>You have no say in it, there&rsquo;s actually no you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, and that&rsquo;s to me completely unscientific.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s completely him, you know, pulling it out of nowhere.</p>
<p>We all experienced the fact that we have an eye.</p>
<p>That kind of certainty saying that we do not have</p>
<p>that fundamental choice that reason provides</p>
<p>is unfounded currently.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s a sense in which it can never be contradicted</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a product of your experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a product of your experience.</p>
<p>You can experience it directly.</p>
<p>So no science will ever prove that this table isn&rsquo;t here.</p>
<p>I can see it, it&rsquo;s here, right?</p>
<p>I can feel it.</p>
<p>I know I have free will because I can introspect it.</p>
<p>In a sense, I can see it.</p>
<p>I can see myself engaging it and that is as valid</p>
<p>as the evidence of my senses.</p>
<p>Now I can&rsquo;t point at it so that you can see</p>
<p>the same thing I&rsquo;m seeing,</p>
<p>but you can do the same thing in your own consciousness</p>
<p>and you can identify the same thing.</p>
<p>And to deny that in the name of science</p>
<p>is to get things upside down.</p>
<p>You start with that and that&rsquo;s the beginning of science.</p>
<p>The beginning of science is the identification</p>
<p>that I choose and that I can reason</p>
<p>and now I need to figure out the mechanism,</p>
<p>the rules of reasoning, the rules of logic.</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where science comes from.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s possible that science,</p>
<p>like from my place of AI would be able to,</p>
<p>if we were able to engineer consciousness or understand,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re so far away from it now,</p>
<p>but understand how the actual mechanism</p>
<p>that consciousness emerges.</p>
<p>And in fact, this table is not real,</p>
<p>that we can determine that it,</p>
<p>exactly how our mind constructs the reality</p>
<p>that we perceive, then you can start to make interesting.</p>
<p>But our mind doesn&rsquo;t construct the reality that we perceive.</p>
<p>The reality we perceive is there.</p>
<p>We perceive a reality that exists.</p>
<p>Now, we perceive it in particular ways</p>
<p>given the nature of our senses, right?</p>
<p>A bat perceives this table differently,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still the same table</p>
<p>with the same characteristics and the same identity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of, we use eyes,</p>
<p>they use a radar system to,</p>
<p>they use sound waves to perceive it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>Existence exists whether we exist or not.</p>
<p>And so you could create, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you could create a consciousness, right?</p>
<p>And I suspect that to do that,</p>
<p>you would have to use biology, not just electronics,</p>
<p>but way outside my expertise.</p>
<p>Because consciousness, as far as we know,</p>
<p>is a phenomenon of life,</p>
<p>and you would have to figure out how to create life</p>
<p>before you created consciousness, I think.</p>
<p>But if you did that, then that wouldn&rsquo;t change anything.</p>
<p>All it would say is we have another conscious being.</p>
<p>Cool, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But it wouldn&rsquo;t change the nature of our consciousness.</p>
<p>Our consciousness is what it is in respect.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very interesting, I think this is a good way</p>
<p>to set the table for discussion of objectivism is,</p>
<p>let me at least challenge a thought experiment,</p>
<p>which is, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with Donald Hoffman&rsquo;s work about reality.</p>
<p>So his idea is that we&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>our perception is just an interface to reality.</p>
<p>So Donald Hoffman is the guy you see on Vine?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve met Donald and I&rsquo;ve seen his video.</p>
<p>And look, Donald has not invented anything new.</p>
<p>This goes back to ancient philosophy.</p>
<p>Let me just state it in case people aren&rsquo;t familiar.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a fascinating thought experiment to me,</p>
<p>like of out of the box thinking, perhaps literally,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a gap between the world as we perceive it</p>
<p>and the world as it actually exists.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, for the philosophy,</p>
<p>objectivism is a really important gap to close.</p>
<p>So can you maybe at least try to entertain the idea</p>
<p>that there is more to reality than our minds can perceive?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t understand what more means, right?</p>
<p>Of course there&rsquo;s more to reality</p>
<p>than what our senses perceive.</p>
<p>That is, for example, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>certain elements have radiation, right?</p>
<p>Uranium has radiation.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t perceive radiation.</p>
<p>The beauty of human reason is I can,</p>
<p>through experimentation,</p>
<p>discover the phenomena of radiation,</p>
<p>then actually measure radiation.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t perceive the world</p>
<p>the way a bat perceives the world.</p>
<p>And I might not be able to see certain things,</p>
<p>but I can, we&rsquo;ve created radar,</p>
<p>so A, we understand how a bat perceives the world,</p>
<p>and I can mimic it through a radar screen</p>
<p>and create images like the bat,</p>
<p>its consciousness somehow perceives it, right?</p>
<p>So the beauty of human reason is our capacity</p>
<p>to understand the world beyond</p>
<p>what our senses give us directly.</p>
<p>At the end, everything comes in through our senses,</p>
<p>but we can understand things</p>
<p>that our senses don&rsquo;t provide us.</p>
<p>But what he&rsquo;s doing is he&rsquo;s doing something very different.</p>
<p>He is saying what our senses provides us</p>
<p>might have nothing to do with the reality out there.</p>
<p>That is just a random, arbitrary, nonsensical statement.</p>
<p>And he actually has a whole</p>
<p>evolutionary explanation for it.</p>
<p>He runs some simulations.</p>
<p>The simulations seem, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on this field,</p>
<p>but they seem silly to me.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem to reflect.</p>
<p>And look, all he&rsquo;s doing is taking</p>
<p>Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s philosophy,</p>
<p>which articulate exactly the same cause,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s giving it a veneer of evolutionary ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on evolution,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not an expert on epistemology,</p>
<p>which is what this is.</p>
<p>So to me, as a semi layman,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m actually,</p>
<p>you know, I have this Yaron Book Show.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m allowed to pitch it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve got this Yaron Book Show on YouTube.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the Yaron Book Show.</p>
<p>I listen to it very often.</p>
<p>As a small aside, the cool thing about reason,</p>
<p>which you practice,</p>
<p>is you have a systematic way of thinking</p>
<p>through basically anything.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so fun to listen to.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s rare that I think there&rsquo;s flaws in your logic,</p>
<p>but even then it&rsquo;s fun,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like disagreeing with the screen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great when somebody disagrees with me</p>
<p>and they give good arguments,</p>
<p>because that makes it challenging.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry.</p>
<p>You know, so one of the shows I want to do</p>
<p>in the next few weeks is one of my philosophy,</p>
<p>bring one of my philosophy friends to discuss the video</p>
<p>that Hoffman, where he presents his theory,</p>
<p>because it surprises me how seductive it is.</p>
<p>And it seems to be so,</p>
<p>first of all, completely counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but because, you know, somehow we managed to cross the road</p>
<p>and not get hit by the car.</p>
<p>And if our senses did not provide us any information</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s actually going on in reality,</p>
<p>how do we do that?</p>
<p>And not to mention build computers,</p>
<p>not to mention fly to the moon</p>
<p>and actually land on the moon.</p>
<p>And if reality is not giving us information about the moon,</p>
<p>if our senses are not giving us information about the moon,</p>
<p>how did we get there?</p>
<p>You know, and where did we go?</p>
<p>Maybe we didn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s nonsensical to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very bad place philosophically,</p>
<p>because it basically says</p>
<p>there is no objective standard for anything.</p>
<p>There is no objective reality.</p>
<p>You can come up with anything.</p>
<p>You could argue anything.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no methodology, right?</p>
<p>My, I believe that at the end of the day,</p>
<p>what reason allows us to do</p>
<p>is provides us with a methodology for truth.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, for every claim that I make,</p>
<p>I should be able to boil it down to see,</p>
<p>yeah, look, the evidence of the census is right then.</p>
<p>Once you take that away, knowledge is gone</p>
<p>and truth is gone.</p>
<p>And that opens it up to, you know, complete disaster.</p>
<p>So, you know, to me why it&rsquo;s compelling</p>
<p>to at least entertain this idea,</p>
<p>first of all, it shakes up the mind a little bit</p>
<p>to force you to go back to first principles</p>
<p>and, you know, ask the question, what do I really know?</p>
<p>And the second part of that that I really enjoy</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a reminder that we know very little</p>
<p>to be a little bit more humble.</p>
<p>So if reality doesn&rsquo;t exist at all,</p>
<p>before you start thinking about it,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really nice wake up call to think,</p>
<p>wait a minute, I don&rsquo;t really know much about this universe,</p>
<p>that humbleness.</p>
<p>I think something I&rsquo;d like to ask you about</p>
<p>in terms of reason, when you,</p>
<p>you can become very confident</p>
<p>in your ability to understand the world</p>
<p>if you practice reason often.</p>
<p>And I feel like it can lead you astray</p>
<p>because you can start to think,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, so I love psychology</p>
<p>and psychologists have the certainty</p>
<p>about understanding the human condition,</p>
<p>which is undeserved.</p>
<p>You know, you run a study with 50 people</p>
<p>and you think you can understand</p>
<p>the source of all these psychiatric disorders,</p>
<p>all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s similar kind of trouble</p>
<p>I feel like you can get into</p>
<p>when you overreach with reason.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there is such a thing</p>
<p>as overreaching with reason,</p>
<p>but there are bad applications of reason.</p>
<p>There are bad uses of reason</p>
<p>or the pretense of using reason.</p>
<p>I think a lot of these psychological studies</p>
<p>are pretense of using reason.</p>
<p>And the psychologists have never really taken</p>
<p>a serious stat class or a serious econometrics class.</p>
<p>So they use statistics in weird ways</p>
<p>that just don&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a miss, that&rsquo;s not reason, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just bad thinking, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think you can do too much good thinking.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what reason is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good thinking.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that you try to use reason</p>
<p>does not guarantee you won&rsquo;t make mistakes.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you won&rsquo;t be wrong.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you won&rsquo;t go down a rabbit hole</p>
<p>and completely get it wrong.</p>
<p>But it does give you the only existing mechanism to fix it.</p>
<p>Which is going back to reality,</p>
<p>going back to facts, going back to reason.</p>
<p>And getting out of the rabbit hole</p>
<p>and getting back to reality.</p>
<p>So I agree with you that it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>to think about these, what I consider crazy ideas</p>
<p>because it, oh wait, what is my argument about them?</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t really have a good argument about them,</p>
<p>then do I know what I know?</p>
<p>So in that sense, it&rsquo;s always nice to be challenged</p>
<p>and pushed and oriented.</p>
<p>You know, the nice thing about objectivism is</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s doing that to me all the time, right?</p>
<p>Because nobody agrees with me on anything.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m constantly being challenged,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in, by Hoffman on metaphysics</p>
<p>and epistemology, right?</p>
<p>On the very foundations of analogy and ethics,</p>
<p>everybody constantly, and in politics all the time.</p>
<p>So I find that it&rsquo;s part of, you know,</p>
<p>I prefer that everybody, there&rsquo;s a sense</p>
<p>in which I prefer that everybody agreed with me, right?</p>
<p>Because I think we&rsquo;d live in a better world.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a sense in which that disagreement makes it,</p>
<p>at least up to a point, makes it interesting</p>
<p>and challenging and forces you to be able to rethink</p>
<p>or to confirm your own thinking</p>
<p>and to challenge that thinking.</p>
<p>Can you try to do the impossible task</p>
<p>and give a whirlwind introduction to Ayn Rand,</p>
<p>the many sides of Ayn Rand?</p>
<p>So Ayn Rand the human being, Ayn Rand the novelist,</p>
<p>and Ayn Rand the philosopher.</p>
<p>So who was Ayn Rand?</p>
<p>Sure, so her life story is one that I think is fascinating</p>
<p>but it also lends itself to this integration</p>
<p>of all of these things.</p>
<p>She was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905</p>
<p>to kind of a middle class family, Jewish family.</p>
<p>They owned a pharmacy, her father owned a pharmacy.</p>
<p>And, you know, she grew up, she grew up,</p>
<p>she was a very, she knew what she wanted to do</p>
<p>and what she wanted to be from a very young age.</p>
<p>I think from the age of nine,</p>
<p>she knew she wanted to be a writer.</p>
<p>She wanted to write stories.</p>
<p>That was the thing she wanted to do.</p>
<p>And, you know, she focused her life after that</p>
<p>on this goal of I wanna be a novelist, I wanna write.</p>
<p>And the philosophy was incidental to that in a sense,</p>
<p>at least until some point in her life.</p>
<p>She witnessed the Russian Revolution,</p>
<p>literally it happened outside.</p>
<p>They lived in St. Petersburg</p>
<p>where the first kind of demonstrations</p>
<p>and of the revolution happened.</p>
<p>So she witnessed it.</p>
<p>She lived through it as a teenager,</p>
<p>went to school under the Soviets.</p>
<p>For a while, they were under kind of on the Black Sea</p>
<p>where the opposition government was ruling</p>
<p>and then they would go back and forth</p>
<p>between the commies and the whites.</p>
<p>But she experienced what communism was like.</p>
<p>She saw the pharmacy being taken away from a family.</p>
<p>She saw their apartment being taken away</p>
<p>or other families being brought</p>
<p>into the apartment they already lived in.</p>
<p>And it was very clear given her nature,</p>
<p>given her views, even at a very young age</p>
<p>that she would not survive the system.</p>
<p>So a lot of effort was put into how did she get out?</p>
<p>And her family was really helpful in this.</p>
<p>And she had a cousin in Chicago</p>
<p>and she had been studying kind of film at the university and&hellip;</p>
<p>This is in her 20s?</p>
<p>This is in her 20s, early 20s.</p>
<p>And Lenin, there was a small window</p>
<p>where Lenin was allowing some people</p>
<p>to leave under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>And she managed to get out to go do research on film</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>Everybody knew, everybody who knew her</p>
<p>knew she would never come back,</p>
<p>that this was a one way ticket.</p>
<p>And she got out, she made it to Chicago,</p>
<p>spent a few weeks in Chicago, and then headed to Hollywood.</p>
<p>She wanted to write scripts, that was the goal.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this short woman from Russia with a strong accent,</p>
<p>learning English, showing up in Hollywood</p>
<p>and I wanna be a script writer.</p>
<p>In English.</p>
<p>In English, writing in English.</p>
<p>And this is kind of one of these fairytale stories,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s true, she shows up at the Cecil B. DeMille Studios.</p>
<p>And she has a letter of introduction from her cousin</p>
<p>in Chicago who owns a movie theater.</p>
<p>And this is in the late 1920s.</p>
<p>And she shows up there with this letter and they say,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t call us, we&rsquo;ll call you kind of thing.</p>
<p>And she steps out and there&rsquo;s this massive convertible.</p>
<p>And in the convertible is Cecil B. DeMille.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s driving slowly past her</p>
<p>right at the entrance of the studio.</p>
<p>And she stares at him and he stops the car and he says,</p>
<p>why are you staring at me?</p>
<p>And she says, she tells him a story from Russia</p>
<p>and I wanna make it in the movies,</p>
<p>I wanna be a script writer one day.</p>
<p>And he says, well, if you want that, get in the car.</p>
<p>She gets in the car and he takes her to the back lot</p>
<p>of his studio where they&rsquo;re filming The King of Kings,</p>
<p>the story of Jesus.</p>
<p>And he says, here&rsquo;s a pass for a week.</p>
<p>If you wanna write for the movies,</p>
<p>you better know how movies are made.</p>
<p>And she basically spends a week in there.</p>
<p>She spends more time there.</p>
<p>She managed to get an extension.</p>
<p>She lands up being an extra in the movie.</p>
<p>So you can see Ayn Rand there is one of the masses</p>
<p>when Jesus is walking by.</p>
<p>She meets her future husband on the sets</p>
<p>of The King of Kings.</p>
<p>She lands up getting married,</p>
<p>getting her American citizenship that way.</p>
<p>And she lands up doing odds and ends jobs in Hollywood,</p>
<p>living in a tiny little apartment,</p>
<p>somehow making a living.</p>
<p>Her husband was an actor.</p>
<p>He was struggling actors were difficult times.</p>
<p>And in the evenings, studying English,</p>
<p>writing, writing, writing, writing,</p>
<p>and studying and studying and studying.</p>
<p>And she finally makes it by writing a play</p>
<p>that is successful in LA and ultimately goes to Broadway.</p>
<p>And her first novel is a novel called We The Living,</p>
<p>which is the most autobiographical of all her novels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a young woman in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful story, a very moving story,</p>
<p>and probably, if not the best,</p>
<p>one of the best portrayals of life under communism.</p>
<p>And how powerful.</p>
<p>So you would recommend the book?</p>
<p>Definitely recommend We The Living.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s her first novel.</p>
<p>She wrote it in the spring of 2000.</p>
<p>First novel she wrote in the 30s.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>Because if you think about the intelligentsia,</p>
<p>the people who matter, the people who wrote book reviews,</p>
<p>this is a time of Durante,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the New York Times guy in Moscow,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s praising Stalin to the hills and the success.</p>
<p>So the novel fails, but she&rsquo;s got a novel out.</p>
<p>She writes a small novelette called Anthem.</p>
<p>A lot of people have read that, and it&rsquo;s read</p>
<p>in high schools.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a dystopian novel,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t get published in the U.S.</p>
<p>It gets published in the U.K.</p>
<p>U.K. is very interested in dystopian novels.</p>
<p>Animal Farm in 1984,</p>
<p>84 is published a couple of years after, I think,</p>
<p>after Anthem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s reason to believe he read Anthem.</p>
<p>And George Orwell read Animal Farm.</p>
<p>Just a small aside, Animal Farm is probably top.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s weird to say,</p>
<p>but I would say it&rsquo;s my favorite book.</p>
<p>Have you seen this movie out now called Mr. Jones?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;ve got to see Mr. Jones.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Mr. Jones?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry for my ignorance.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s a movie, and it hasn&rsquo;t got any publicity,</p>
<p>which is tragic, because it&rsquo;s a really good movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both brilliantly made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made by a Polish director.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a true story,</p>
<p>and George Orwell&rsquo;s Animal Farm is featured in it</p>
<p>in the sense that during the story,</p>
<p>George Orwell is writing Animal Farm,</p>
<p>and the narrator is reading off sections of Animal Farm</p>
<p>as the movie is progressing.</p>
<p>And the movie is a true story</p>
<p>about the first Western journalist to discover</p>
<p>and to write about the famine in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And so he goes to Moscow, and then he gets on a train,</p>
<p>and he finds himself in Ukraine,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s beautifully and horrifically made.</p>
<p>So the horror of the famine is brilliantly conveyed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a true story, so it&rsquo;s a very moving story,</p>
<p>very powerful story, and just very well made movie.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s tragic, in my view,</p>
<p>that not more people are seeing it.</p>
<p>I was actually recently just complaining</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not enough content</p>
<p>on the famine in the 30s of stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much on Hitler.</p>
<p>I love the reading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading, it&rsquo;s so long, it&rsquo;s been taking me forever,</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it, but.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve got the book to compliment that,</p>
<p>that you have to read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called The Ominous Parallels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Lennon Peacock, and it&rsquo;s The Ominous Parallels,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about the causes of the rise of Hitler,</p>
<p>but a philosophical causes.</p>
<p>So whereas The Rise and Fall is more of a kind of,</p>
<p>the existential kind of what happened,</p>
<p>but really delving into the intellectual currents</p>
<p>that led to the rise of Hitler, highly recommend that.</p>
<p>Basically suggesting how it might rise another.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s The Ominous Parallels,</p>
<p>so the parallel he draws is to the United States,</p>
<p>and he says those same intellectual forces</p>
<p>are rising in the United States,</p>
<p>and this was published, I think, in, published in 82.</p>
<p>It was published in 82.</p>
<p>So it was published a long time ago,</p>
<p>and yet you look around us,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unbelievably predictive, sadly,</p>
<p>about the state of the world.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t finished Iron Man&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you want me to finish it.</p>
<p>No, no, no, but on that point, I&rsquo;ll have to,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s please return to it, but let&rsquo;s now,</p>
<p>for now, let&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>Let me also say, just because,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to forget about Mr. Jones,</p>
<p>it is true, the point you made,</p>
<p>there are tons of movies that are anti fascist,</p>
<p>anti Nazi, and that&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>but there are way too few movies that are anti communist,</p>
<p>just almost not, and it&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>and if you remind me later, I&rsquo;ll tell you a story about that.</p>
<p>But so she publishes Anthem, and then she starts,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s doing okay in Hollywood,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s doing okay with the play,</p>
<p>and then she starts on the book The Fountainhead,</p>
<p>and she writes The Fountainhead, and it comes out,</p>
<p>she finishes it in 1945,</p>
<p>and she sends it to publishers,</p>
<p>and publisher after publisher after publisher turn it down,</p>
<p>and it takes 12 publishers before this editor reads it,</p>
<p>and says, I want to publish this book,</p>
<p>and he basically tells his bosses,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t publish this book, I&rsquo;m leaving, right?</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t really believe in the book,</p>
<p>so they publish just a few copies,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do a mat lot,</p>
<p>and the book becomes a bestseller from word of mouth,</p>
<p>and they land up having to publish more and more and more,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s basically gone from this immigrant</p>
<p>who comes here with very little command of English,</p>
<p>and to all kinds of odds and ends jobs in Hollywood,</p>
<p>to writing one of the seminal, I think, American books.</p>
<p>She is an American author.</p>
<p>I mean, if you read The Fountainhead, it&rsquo;s not Russian.</p>
<p>This is not Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>It feels like a symbol of what America is</p>
<p>in the 20th century, and I mean, probably, maybe you can,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a famous kind of sexual rape scene in there.</p>
<p>Is that like a lesson you wanna throw in</p>
<p>some controversial stuff</p>
<p>to make your philosophical books work out?</p>
<p>I mean, why was it so popular?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense?</p>
<p>Or is it just?</p>
<p>Well, because I think it illustrated,</p>
<p>first of all, because I think the characters are fantastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a real hero, and I think the whole book</p>
<p>is basically illustrating this massive conflict</p>
<p>that I think went on in America then, is going on today,</p>
<p>and it goes on on a big scale, politics,</p>
<p>all the way down to the scale</p>
<p>of the choices you make in your life.</p>
<p>And the issue is individualism versus collectivism.</p>
<p>Should you live for yourself?</p>
<p>Should you live for your values?</p>
<p>Should you pursue your passions?</p>
<p>Or should you do what your mother tells you?</p>
<p>Should you follow your mother&rsquo;s passions?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, very much a book about individuals,</p>
<p>and people relate to that.</p>
<p>But it obviously has this massive implications</p>
<p>to the world outside,</p>
<p>and at the time of collectivism just having been defeated,</p>
<p>communism, well, fascism,</p>
<p>and the United States representing individualism</p>
<p>as defeated collectivism.</p>
<p>But where collectivist ideas are still popular</p>
<p>in the form of socialism and communism.</p>
<p>And for the individual, there&rsquo;s constant struggle</p>
<p>between what people tell me to do,</p>
<p>what society tells me to do,</p>
<p>what my mother tells me to do,</p>
<p>and what I think I should do.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s unbelievably appealing,</p>
<p>particularly to young people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to figure out what they wanna do in life,</p>
<p>trying to figure out what&rsquo;s important in life.</p>
<p>It had this enormous appeal, it&rsquo;s romantic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bigger than life, the characters are big heroes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very American in that sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about individualism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the triumph of individualism.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s what related,</p>
<p>and it had this big romantic element from the,</p>
<p>I mean, when I use romantic,</p>
<p>I use it kind of in the sense of a movement in art.</p>
<p>But it also has this romantic element</p>
<p>in the sense of a relationship between a man and woman</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s very intriguing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only that there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I would say almost rape scene, right?</p>
<p>I would say, but it&rsquo;s also that this woman</p>
<p>is hard to understand.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve read it more than once,</p>
<p>and I still can&rsquo;t quite figure out Dominique, right?</p>
<p>Because she loves him and she wants to destroy him</p>
<p>and she marries other people.</p>
<p>I mean, think about that too.</p>
<p>Here she&rsquo;s writing a book in the 1940s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of sex.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a woman who marries more than one person,</p>
<p>has having sex with more than one person,</p>
<p>very unconventional.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s having married, she&rsquo;s having sex with work</p>
<p>even though she&rsquo;s not married to work.</p>
<p>This is 1945.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very jarring to people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unexpected, but it&rsquo;s also a book of its time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about individuals pursuing their passion,</p>
<p>pursuing their life and not caring about convention</p>
<p>and what people think, but doing what they think is right.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I encourage everybody to read this, obviously.</p>
<p>So that was, was that the first time</p>
<p>she articulated something that sounded like a philosophy</p>
<p>of individualism?</p>
<p>I mean, the philosophy&rsquo;s there in We The Living, right?</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, the woman is,</p>
<p>the hero of We The Living is this individualist</p>
<p>stuck in Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s struggling with these things.</p>
<p>So the theme is there already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as fleshed out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as articulated philosophically.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly then Anthem, which is a dystopian novel</p>
<p>where this dystopia in the future has a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no I, everything is we.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about one guy who breaks out of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give it away, but breaks out of that.</p>
<p>So these themes are running and then we have,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been published,</p>
<p>some of the early Ayn Rand stories that she was writing</p>
<p>in preparation for writing her novel,</p>
<p>stories she was writing when she first came to America.</p>
<p>And you can see these same philosophical elements,</p>
<p>even in the male, female relationships and the passion</p>
<p>and the, you know, in the conflict,</p>
<p>you see them even in those early pieces.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s just developing them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s same philosophically,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s developing her philosophy with her literature.</p>
<p>And of course, after The Fountainhead,</p>
<p>she starts on what turns out to be her Magnus Opus,</p>
<p>which is Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>which takes her 12 years to publish.</p>
<p>By the time, of course, she brings that out,</p>
<p>every publisher in New York wants to publish it</p>
<p>because The Fountainhead has been such a huge success.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t quite understand it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what to do with Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re eager to get it out there.</p>
<p>And indeed it, when it&rsquo;s published,</p>
<p>it becomes an instant bestseller.</p>
<p>And the thing about the,</p>
<p>particularly The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>but true of even Anthem and We the Living,</p>
<p>she is one of the only dead authors</p>
<p>that sell more after they&rsquo;ve died</p>
<p>than when they were still alive.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s true maybe in music,</p>
<p>we listen to more Beethoven than when he was alive,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not true typically of novelists.</p>
<p>And yet here we are,</p>
<p>was it 50, 60 years after,</p>
<p>63 years after the publication of Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>and it sells probably more today than it sold</p>
<p>when it was a bestseller when it first came out.</p>
<p>Is it true that it&rsquo;s like one of the most sold books</p>
<p>in history?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this kind of statement.</p>
<p>Any Tom Clancy book comes out,</p>
<p>sells more than Atlas Shrugged.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve read, I&rsquo;ve heard statements like this.</p>
<p>So there was a very,</p>
<p>and I shouldn&rsquo;t say this, but it&rsquo;s the truth,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll say it,</p>
<p>a very unscientific study done by the Smithsonian Institute,</p>
<p>probably in the early 90s,</p>
<p>that basically surveyed CEOs and asked them,</p>
<p>what was the most influential book on you?</p>
<p>And Atlas Shrugged came out as number two,</p>
<p>the second most influential book on CEOs in the country.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many flaws in the study.</p>
<p>One was, you want to guess what the number one book?</p>
<p>Bible.</p>
<p>The Bible.</p>
<p>But the Bible was like,</p>
<p>so maybe they surveyed 100 people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the exact numbers were,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s 100 people,</p>
<p>and 60 said the Bible and 10 said Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>and there were a bunch of books over there.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, again, the psychology discussion</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re having right now.</p>
<p>Exactly, well, and it&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned,</p>
<p>and maybe COVID has taught me,</p>
<p>and there are very few people</p>
<p>who know how to do statistics,</p>
<p>and almost nobody knows how to think probabilistically,</p>
<p>that is, think in terms of probabilities,</p>
<p>that it is a skill, it&rsquo;s a hard skill,</p>
<p>and everybody thinks they know it.</p>
<p>So I see doctors thinking they&rsquo;re statisticians</p>
<p>and giving whole analyses of the data on COVID,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have a clue what they&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>not because they&rsquo;re not good doctors,</p>
<p>but because they&rsquo;re not good statisticians.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>People think that they have one skill,</p>
<p>and therefore it translates immediately into another skill,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been astounded at how bad people are at that.</p>
<p>For people who haven&rsquo;t read any of the books</p>
<p>that we were just discussing,</p>
<p>what would you recommend,</p>
<p>what book would you recommend they read,</p>
<p>and maybe also just elaborate</p>
<p>what mindset should they enter</p>
<p>the reading of that book with?</p>
<p>So I would recommend everybody</p>
<p>read Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.</p>
<p>And in one&hellip;</p>
<p>In that order?</p>
<p>So it would depend on where you are in life, right?</p>
<p>So it depends on who you are and what you are.</p>
<p>So Fountainhead is a more personal story.</p>
<p>For many people, it&rsquo;s their favorite,</p>
<p>and for many people, it was their first book,</p>
<p>and they wouldn&rsquo;t replace that, right?</p>
<p>Atlas Shrugged is a&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the world.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what impacts the world,</p>
<p>how the world functions,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s a bigger book in the sense of the scope.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in politics</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re interested in the world,</p>
<p>read Atlas Shrugged first.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re mainly focused on your life, your career,</p>
<p>what you wanna do with yourself, start with Fountainhead.</p>
<p>I still think you should read both</p>
<p>because I think they are&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, to me, they were life altering,</p>
<p>and to many, many people, they&rsquo;re life altering,</p>
<p>and you should go into reading them with an open mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, and with a&hellip;</p>
<p>Put aside everything you&rsquo;ve heard about Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>Put aside any&hellip;</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s true, just put it aside.</p>
<p>Even what I just said about Ayn Rand, put it aside.</p>
<p>Just read the book as a book,</p>
<p>and let it move you and let your thoughts,</p>
<p>let it shape how you think,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll either have a response to it or you won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but I think most people have a very strong response to it,</p>
<p>and then the question is,</p>
<p>are they willing to respond to the philosophy?</p>
<p>Are they willing to integrate the philosophy?</p>
<p>Are they willing to think through the philosophy or not?</p>
<p>Because I know a lot of people</p>
<p>who completely disagree with the philosophy, right?</p>
<p>Here in Hollywood, right?</p>
<p>Lots of people here in Hollywood,</p>
<p>love The Fountainhead.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Oliver Stone, who is, I think, a avowed Marxist, right?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s admitted to being a Marxist, he is.</p>
<p>His movies certainly reflect a Marxist theme,</p>
<p>is a huge fan of The Fountainhead,</p>
<p>and is actually his dream project, he has said in public,</p>
<p>his dream project is to make The Fountainhead.</p>
<p>Now, he would completely change it, as movie directors do,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s actually outlined what his script would look like,</p>
<p>and it would be a disaster for the ideas of The Fountainhead,</p>
<p>but he loves the story,</p>
<p>because to him, the story is about artistic integrity.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he catches on.</p>
<p>And what he hates about the story is the individualism.</p>
<p>And I think that his movie ends</p>
<p>with Howard Rourke joining some kind of commune</p>
<p>of architects that do it for the love</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t do it for the money.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>But so, yeah, so he can connect with you</p>
<p>without the philosophy,</p>
<p>and before we get into the philosophy,</p>
<p>staying on Ayn Rand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you sort of my own personal experience,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s one that people share.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced this with two people, Ayn Rand and Nietzsche.</p>
<p>When I brought up Ayn Rand when I was in my early 20s,</p>
<p>the number of eye rolls I got from sort of, you know,</p>
<p>like advisors and so on, that of dismissal,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that later in life about more specific concepts</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence and technical,</p>
<p>where people decide that this is a set of ideas</p>
<p>that are acceptable and these sets of ideas are not.</p>
<p>And they dismissed Ayn Rand</p>
<p>without giving me any justification</p>
<p>of why they dismissed her,</p>
<p>except, oh, that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re 19 or 20.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same thing people say about Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just something you do when you&rsquo;re in college</p>
<p>and you take an intro to philosophy course.</p>
<p>So, and I&rsquo;ve never really heard anybody cleanly articulate</p>
<p>their opposition to Ayn Rand,</p>
<p>in my own private little circles and so on.</p>
<p>Maybe one question I just wanna ask is,</p>
<p>why is there such a opposition to Ayn Rand?</p>
<p>And maybe another way to ask the same thing is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s misunderstood about Ayn Rand?</p>
<p>So, we haven&rsquo;t talked about the philosophy,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s harder to answer right now.</p>
<p>We can return to it if you think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the right way to go.</p>
<p>Well, let me give a broad answer</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll do the philosophy</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll return to it,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s important to know</p>
<p>something about her ideas.</p>
<p>She, I think her philosophy challenges everything.</p>
<p>It really does, it shakes up the world.</p>
<p>It challenges so many of our preconceptions.</p>
<p>It challenges so many of the things</p>
<p>that people take for granted as truth.</p>
<p>From religion to morality to politics</p>
<p>to almost everything,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never quite been a thinker like her</p>
<p>in the sense of really challenging everything</p>
<p>and doing it systematically</p>
<p>and having a complete philosophy</p>
<p>that is a challenge to everything that has come before her.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re on threads that connect,</p>
<p>they are, right?</p>
<p>In politics, there might be a thread</p>
<p>and in morality, there might be a thread,</p>
<p>but on everything, there&rsquo;s just never been like it.</p>
<p>And people are afraid of that</p>
<p>because it challenges them to the core.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s basically telling you to rethink almost everything.</p>
<p>And that is that people reject.</p>
<p>The other thing that it does,</p>
<p>and this goes to this point about,</p>
<p>oh yeah, that&rsquo;s what you do when you&rsquo;re 14, 15, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She points out to them that they&rsquo;ve lost something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve lost their idealism.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve lost the youthful idealism.</p>
<p>What makes youthfulness meaningful</p>
<p>other than we&rsquo;re in better physical shape,</p>
<p>starting to feel, because I&rsquo;m getting older.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>sometime in the teen years, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that happens to human consciousness.</p>
<p>We almost awakened and knew, right?</p>
<p>We suddenly discovered that we can think for ourselves.</p>
<p>We suddenly discovered that not everything our parents</p>
<p>and our teachers tell us is true.</p>
<p>We suddenly discovered that this tool, our minds,</p>
<p>is suddenly available to us to discover the world</p>
<p>and to discover truth.</p>
<p>And it is a time of idealism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a time of, whoa, I want to, you know,</p>
<p>the better teenagers, I want to know about the world.</p>
<p>I want to go out there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe my parents.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe my teachers.</p>
<p>And this is healthy.</p>
<p>This is fantastic.</p>
<p>And I want to go out there and experiment.</p>
<p>And that gets us into trouble, right?</p>
<p>We do stupid things when we&rsquo;re teenagers.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re experimenting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the experiential part of it, right?</p>
<p>We want to go and experience life.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the learning process.</p>
<p>And we become risk takers because we want to experience.</p>
<p>But the risk is something we need to learn</p>
<p>because we need to learn where the boundaries are.</p>
<p>And one of the damages that helicopter parents do</p>
<p>is they prevent us from taking those risks</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t learn about the world</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t learn about where the boundaries are.</p>
<p>So the teenage years are these years of wonder.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re depressing when you&rsquo;re in them</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>which I think primarily have to do with the culture,</p>
<p>but also with oneself.</p>
<p>But they are exciting, the periods of discovery.</p>
<p>And people get excited about ideas</p>
<p>and good ideas, bad ideas, all kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>And then what happens?</p>
<p>We settle.</p>
<p>We compromise.</p>
<p>Whether that happens in college</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re taught that nothing exists and nothing matters</p>
<p>and stop being an idealist, be a cynic, be whatever.</p>
<p>Or whether it happens when we get married and get a job</p>
<p>and have kids and are too busy</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t think about our ideals and forget</p>
<p>and just get into the norm of conventional life</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s because a mother pesters us</p>
<p>to get married and have kids</p>
<p>and do all the things that she wanted us to do.</p>
<p>We give up on those ideals.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sense in which Ayn Rand reminds them</p>
<p>that they gave up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully, that&rsquo;s so beautifully put and so true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s worth pausing on,</p>
<p>that this dismissal,</p>
<p>people forget the beauty of that curiosity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true in the scientific field too,</p>
<p>is that youthful joy of like everything is possible</p>
<p>and we can understand it with the tools of our mind.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Ayn Rand&rsquo;s ideas</p>
<p>at the end of the day all boil down to,</p>
<p>is that confidence and that passion</p>
<p>and that curiosity and that interest.</p>
<p>And if you think about what academia does</p>
<p>to so many of us, right?</p>
<p>We go into academia and we&rsquo;re excited about,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna learn stuff.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna discover things.</p>
<p>And then they stick you into sub sub field</p>
<p>and examining some minutia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insignificant and unimportant.</p>
<p>And to get published, you have to be conventional.</p>
<p>You have to do what everybody else does.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the tenure process of seven years</p>
<p>where they put you through this torture to write papers</p>
<p>that fit into a certain mold.</p>
<p>And by the time you&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in your mid thirties and you&rsquo;ve done nothing.</p>
<p>You discovered nothing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all in this minutia in this stuff</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s destructive.</p>
<p>And where&rsquo;s holding onto that passion,</p>
<p>holding onto that knowledge and that confidence is hard.</p>
<p>And when people do away with it, they become cynical</p>
<p>and they become part of the system</p>
<p>and they inflict the same pain on the next guy</p>
<p>that they suffered because that&rsquo;s part of how it works.</p>
<p>Yeah, this happens in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>This happens when like a young person shows up</p>
<p>and with like fire in their eyes and they say,</p>
<p>I want to understand the nature of intelligence.</p>
<p>And everybody rolls their eyes.</p>
<p>Well, for these same reasons,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve spent so many years</p>
<p>on the very specific set of questions</p>
<p>that kind of they compete over and they write papers over</p>
<p>and they have conferences about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true that incremental research</p>
<p>is the way you make progress answering the question</p>
<p>of what is intelligence exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p>But when you mock it, you actually destroy the realities.</p>
<p>When we look like centuries from now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll look back at this time</p>
<p>for this particular field of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>it will be the people who will be remembered,</p>
<p>will be the people who&rsquo;ve asked the question</p>
<p>and made it their life journey of what is intelligence</p>
<p>and actually had the chance to succeed.</p>
<p>Most will fail asking that question,</p>
<p>but the ones that like had a chance of succeeding</p>
<p>and had that throughout their whole life.</p>
<p>And I suppose the same is true for philosophy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in every field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s asking the big questions and staying curious</p>
<p>and staying passionate and staying excited</p>
<p>and accepting failure, right?</p>
<p>Accepting that you&rsquo;re not going to get it first time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get the whole thing.</p>
<p>But, and sometimes you have to do the minutia work</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not here to say nobody should specialize</p>
<p>and you shouldn&rsquo;t do the minutia, you have to do that.</p>
<p>But there has to be a way to do that work</p>
<p>and keep the passion and keep it all integrated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t live in a culture that integrates, right?</p>
<p>We live in a culture that is all about this minutia</p>
<p>and not, and medicine is another field</p>
<p>where you specialize in the kidney.</p>
<p>I mean, the kidney&rsquo;s connected to other things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to, and we don&rsquo;t have a holistic view</p>
<p>of these things and I&rsquo;m sure in artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to make the big leaps forward</p>
<p>without a holistic view of what it is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s the question of what is intelligence?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the kind of questions you have to ask</p>
<p>to make big leaps forward, to really move the field</p>
<p>in a positive direction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the people who can think that way,</p>
<p>who move fields and move technology,</p>
<p>who move anything, anything is, everything is like.</p>
<p>But just like you said, it&rsquo;s painful</p>
<p>because underlying that kind of questioning is,</p>
<p>well, maybe the work I&rsquo;ve done for the past 20 years</p>
<p>was a dead end and you have to kind of face that.</p>
<p>Even just, it might not be true,</p>
<p>but even just facing that reality is just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a painful feeling.</p>
<p>Absolutely, but it&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s part of the reason</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s important to enjoy the work that you do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that even if it doesn&rsquo;t completely work out,</p>
<p>at least you enjoy the process, right?</p>
<p>It was not a waste because you enjoyed the process.</p>
<p>And if you learn, as any entrepreneur knows this, right,</p>
<p>and if you learn from the waste of time,</p>
<p>from the errors, from the mistakes,</p>
<p>then you can build on them and make things even better.</p>
<p>Right, and so the next 20 years are a massive success.</p>
<p>Can we, another impossible task,</p>
<p>so you did wonderfully on talking about Ayn Rand,</p>
<p>the other impossible task of giving a whirlwind overview</p>
<p>of the philosophy of objectivism,</p>
<p>the philosophy of Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>Yeah, so luckily she did it in an essay.</p>
<p>She talks about doing a philosophy on one foot.</p>
<p>But let me integrate it with the literature</p>
<p>and with her life a little bit.</p>
<p>She wanted to be a writer, but her goal,</p>
<p>she had a particular goal in her writing.</p>
<p>She was an idealist, right?</p>
<p>She wanted to portray the ideal man.</p>
<p>So one of the things you do when you want to do something</p>
<p>is what is an ideal man?</p>
<p>You have to ask that question.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>You might have a sense of it.</p>
<p>You might have some glimpses of it</p>
<p>in other people&rsquo;s literature, but what is it?</p>
<p>So she starts reading philosophy to try to figure out</p>
<p>what do philosophers say about the ideal man?</p>
<p>And what she finds horrifies her</p>
<p>in terms of the view of most philosophers of man.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s attracted, certainly when she&rsquo;s young,</p>
<p>to Nietzsche, because Nietzsche at least has a vision</p>
<p>of grandeur for man, even though his philosophy</p>
<p>is very flawed and has other problems</p>
<p>and contradicts man in many ways.</p>
<p>But at least he has that vision of what is possible to man.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s attracted to that romantic vision,</p>
<p>that idealistic vision.</p>
<p>So she discovers in writing,</p>
<p>and particularly in writing Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>but even in the Fountainhead,</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s gonna have to develop her own philosophy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gonna have to discover what she can do</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s gonna have to discover these ideas for herself,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not fully articulated anywhere else.</p>
<p>The glimpses again of it in Aristotle, in Nietzsche,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not fully fleshed out.</p>
<p>So to a large extent, she develops a philosophy</p>
<p>for a very practical purpose, to write,</p>
<p>to write a novel about the ideal man.</p>
<p>And Atlas Shrugged is the manifestation of that.</p>
<p>By the way, sorry to interrupt, as a little aside,</p>
<p>she does, when you say man, you mean human.</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;ll bring this up often,</p>
<p>she does, maybe you can elaborate</p>
<p>of how she specifically uses man and he in the work.</p>
<p>We live in a time now of gender and so on.</p>
<p>Well, she did that in the sense that everybody did it</p>
<p>during her period of time, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only in modern times where we do he slash she, right?</p>
<p>Historically, when you said he, you meant a human being,</p>
<p>unless the particular context implied that it was a&hellip;</p>
<p>But in Ayn Rand&rsquo;s case, in this case, in this one sentence,</p>
<p>she probably meant man.</p>
<p>Not that, because she viewed that there are differences</p>
<p>between men and women, we&rsquo;re not the same,</p>
<p>which I know comes at a shock to many people.</p>
<p>But she&hellip;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s working on a character.</p>
<p>She was working on a particular vision, right?</p>
<p>She considered herself a man worshiper.</p>
<p>And a man, not human being, a male.</p>
<p>She worshiped manhood, if you will, the hero in man.</p>
<p>And she wanted to fully understand what that was.</p>
<p>Now, it has massive implications for ideal woman.</p>
<p>And I think she does portray the ideal woman</p>
<p>in Atlas Shrugged, in the character of Dagny.</p>
<p>But her goal is, I think her selfish goal</p>
<p>for what she wanted to get out of the novel</p>
<p>is that excitement, partially sexual,</p>
<p>about seeing your ideal manifest in reality</p>
<p>of what you perceive as that which you would be attracted to</p>
<p>fully, intellectually, physically, sexually,</p>
<p>in every aspect of your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s trying to bring into it.</p>
<p>So there was no ambiguity of gender, so there was a masculinity</p>
<p>and a femininity in her work.</p>
<p>Very much so.</p>
<p>And if you read the novels, you see that.</p>
<p>You see that.</p>
<p>Now, remember, this is in the context of, in Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>she is portraying a woman who runs a railroad,</p>
<p>the most masculine of all jobs you can imagine, right?</p>
<p>Running a railroad, better than any man can run it.</p>
<p>And achieving huge success,</p>
<p>better than any other man out there.</p>
<p>But, but for her, even Dagny needs somebody to,</p>
<p>needs a man, in some sense, to look up to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the character whose name I won&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>because it gives away too much of the plot.</p>
<p>But there has to be that.</p>
<p>I like how you do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, a lot of practice, a lot of practice.</p>
<p>Nothing, brilliant.</p>
<p>Because you convey all the important things</p>
<p>without giving away plot lines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a master.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s, so she&rsquo;s very much,</p>
<p>she, she described herself once as a male chauvinist.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She very, she likes the idea of a man opening a door for her.</p>
<p>But more metaphysically, she identifies something</p>
<p>in the difference between the way a man relates to a woman</p>
<p>and a woman relates to a man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not take too far of a tangent,</p>
<p>but I just, as a side comment, I, to me, she represented,</p>
<p>she was a feminist to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps there&rsquo;s a, perhaps technically,</p>
<p>philosophy, you disagree with that, whatever.</p>
<p>But the, you know, that to me represented strong,</p>
<p>like she had some of the strongest female characters</p>
<p>in the history of literature.</p>
<p>Again, this is, this is a woman running a railroad in 1957.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And not just a woman running a railroad,</p>
<p>and this is true of the Fountainhead as well.</p>
<p>A woman who is sexually, in a sense, assertive,</p>
<p>sexually open.</p>
<p>This is, this is not a woman who, you know,</p>
<p>this is a woman who, who, who embraces her sexuality.</p>
<p>And, you know, sex is important in life.</p>
<p>This is why it keeps coming up, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it was important to Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>It was, it&rsquo;s important in the novels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important in life.</p>
<p>And for her, one&rsquo;s attitude towards sex</p>
<p>is a reflection of one&rsquo;s attitude towards life.</p>
<p>And it, you know, and what attitude towards pleasure,</p>
<p>which is an important part of life.</p>
<p>And she thought that was an incredibly important thing.</p>
<p>And so she has these assertive, powerful, sexual women</p>
<p>who live their lives on their terms 100%,</p>
<p>who seek a man to look up to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it is psychologically complex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more psychology than philosophy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s psychologically complex and, you know,</p>
<p>not my area of expertise, but this is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something in, she would argue,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something fundamentally different</p>
<p>about a male and a woman, about a male and female,</p>
<p>psychologically in their attitude towards one another.</p>
<p>Yeah, but as a side note, I say that,</p>
<p>I would say that, I don&rsquo;t know philosophically</p>
<p>if her ideas about gender are interesting.</p>
<p>I think her other philosophical ideas</p>
<p>are much more interesting.</p>
<p>But reading wise, like the stories it created,</p>
<p>the tension it created, that was pretty powerful.</p>
<p>I mean, that was, that&rsquo;s pretty powerful stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll speculate that the reason it&rsquo;s so powerful</p>
<p>is because it reflects something in reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thread that at least.</p>
<p>And look, it&rsquo;s really important to say,</p>
<p>I think she was the first feminist in a sense.</p>
<p>I think in a sense, the feminists have</p>
<p>promoted feminism into something that it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>But in the sense of men and women are capable,</p>
<p>she was the first one who really put that</p>
<p>into a novel and showed it.</p>
<p>To me, as a boy, when I was reading Alice Shrugged,</p>
<p>I think I read that before Fountainhead,</p>
<p>that was one of the early introductions,</p>
<p>at least of an American woman,</p>
<p>I had examples of my own life of Russian women,</p>
<p>but of like a badass lady.</p>
<p>Like I admire, like I love engineering.</p>
<p>I had loved that she could, you know,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a lady that&rsquo;s running the show.</p>
<p>So that at least to me was an example</p>
<p>of a really strong woman, but objectivism.</p>
<p>Objectivism.</p>
<p>So, and so she developed it for a novel.</p>
<p>She spent the latter part of her life</p>
<p>after the publication of Alice Shrugged</p>
<p>really articulating her philosophy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what she did.</p>
<p>She applied it to politics, to life, to gender,</p>
<p>to all these issues from 1957 until she died in 1982.</p>
<p>So the objectivism was born</p>
<p>out of the later parts of Alice Shrugged.</p>
<p>Yes, definitely.</p>
<p>It was there all the time,</p>
<p>but it was fleshed out during the latter parts</p>
<p>of Alice Shrugged and then articulated</p>
<p>for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>So what is objectivism?</p>
<p>So objectivism, so there are five branches in philosophy.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m gonna just go through the branches.</p>
<p>She starts with, you start with metaphysics,</p>
<p>the nature of reality.</p>
<p>And objectivism argues that reality is what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of goes Hawkins back to Aristotle,</p>
<p>law of identity, A is A.</p>
<p>You can wish it to be B,</p>
<p>but wishes do not make something real.</p>
<p>Reality is what it is and it is the primary.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not manipulated, directed by consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness is there to observe,</p>
<p>to give us information about reality.</p>
<p>That is the purpose of consciousness.</p>
<p>That is the nature of it.</p>
<p>So in metaphysics, existence exists.</p>
<p>The law of identity, the law of causality,</p>
<p>things act based on their nature,</p>
<p>not randomly, not arbitrarily, but based on their nature.</p>
<p>And then we have the tool to know reality.</p>
<p>This is epistemology, the theory of knowledge.</p>
<p>A tool to know reality is reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our senses and our capacity</p>
<p>to integrate the information we get from our senses</p>
<p>and to integrate it into new knowledge</p>
<p>and to conceptualize it.</p>
<p>And that is uniquely human.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the truth from revelation.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know truth from our emotions.</p>
<p>Our emotions are interesting.</p>
<p>Our emotions tell us something about ourselves,</p>
<p>but our emotions are not tools of cognition.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t tell us the truth about what&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s in reality.</p>
<p>So reason is our means of knowledge</p>
<p>and therefore reason is our means of survival.</p>
<p>Only individuals reason,</p>
<p>just in the same way that only individuals can eat.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a collective stomach.</p>
<p>Nobody can eat for me and therefore nobody can think for me.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a collective mind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no collective consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bizarre that people talk about</p>
<p>these collectivized aspects of the mind.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t talk about collective feet</p>
<p>and collective stomachs and collective things.</p>
<p>But so we all think for ourselves</p>
<p>and it is our fundamental basic responsibility</p>
<p>to live our lives, to live, to choose.</p>
<p>Once we choose to live, to live our lives</p>
<p>to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>So in morality, she is an egoist.</p>
<p>She believes that the purpose of morality</p>
<p>is to provide you with a code of values and virtues</p>
<p>to guide your life for the purpose of your own success,</p>
<p>your own survival, your own thriving, your own happiness.</p>
<p>Happiness is the moral purpose of your life.</p>
<p>The purpose of morality is to guide you towards a happy life.</p>
<p>Your own happiness.</p>
<p>Your own happiness, absolutely.</p>
<p>Your own happiness.</p>
<p>So she rejects the idea</p>
<p>that you should live other people.</p>
<p>That you should live for the purpose</p>
<p>of other people&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>Your purpose is not to make them happier,</p>
<p>to make them anything.</p>
<p>Your purpose is your own happiness.</p>
<p>But she also rejects the idea</p>
<p>that you could argue maybe the Nietzschean idea</p>
<p>of you should use other people for your own purposes, right?</p>
<p>So every person is an end in himself.</p>
<p>Every person&rsquo;s moral responsibility is their own happiness.</p>
<p>And you shouldn&rsquo;t use other people for your own,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t exploit other people for your own happiness,</p>
<p>and you shouldn&rsquo;t allow yourself</p>
<p>to be exploited for other people.</p>
<p>Every individual is responsible for themselves.</p>
<p>And what is it that allows us to be happy?</p>
<p>What is it that facilitates human flourishing,</p>
<p>human success, human survival?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the use of our minds, right?</p>
<p>It goes back to reason.</p>
<p>And what does reason require in order to be successful,</p>
<p>in order to work effectively?</p>
<p>It requires freedom.</p>
<p>So the enemy of reason, the enemy of reason is force.</p>
<p>The enemy of reason is coercion.</p>
<p>The enemy of reason is authority, right?</p>
<p>The Catholic church doing what they did to Galileo, right?</p>
<p>That restricts Galileo&rsquo;s thinking, right?</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;s in house arrest,</p>
<p>is he gonna come up with a new theory?</p>
<p>Is he gonna discover new truths?</p>
<p>No, the punishment is too, you know, it&rsquo;s too dangerous.</p>
<p>So force, coercion are enemies of reason.</p>
<p>And what reason needs is to be free,</p>
<p>to think, to discover, to innovate,</p>
<p>to break out of convention.</p>
<p>So we need to create an environment</p>
<p>in which individuals are free to reason, free to think.</p>
<p>And to do that, we come up with a concept,</p>
<p>historically we&rsquo;ve come up with a concept</p>
<p>of individual rights.</p>
<p>Individual rights define the scope of,</p>
<p>define the fact that we should be left alone,</p>
<p>free to pursue our values, using our reason,</p>
<p>free of what?</p>
<p>Free of coercion, force, authority.</p>
<p>And that the job of government</p>
<p>is to make sure that we are free.</p>
<p>The whole point of government,</p>
<p>the whole point of when we come in a social context,</p>
<p>the whole point of establish a government in that context</p>
<p>is to secure that freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to make sure that I don&rsquo;t use coercion on you.</p>
<p>The government is supposed to stop me,</p>
<p>supposed to intervene before I can do that,</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;ve already done it,</p>
<p>to prevent me from doing it again.</p>
<p>So the purpose of government is to protect our freedom</p>
<p>to think and to act based on our thoughts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to leave individuals free to pursue their values,</p>
<p>to pursue their happiness, to pursue their rational thought,</p>
<p>and to be left alone to do it.</p>
<p>And so she rejects socialism, which basically assumes</p>
<p>some kind of collective goal,</p>
<p>assumes the sacrifice of the individual to the group,</p>
<p>assumes that your moral purpose in life</p>
<p>is the well being of other people rather than your own.</p>
<p>And she rejects all form of statism,</p>
<p>all form of government that is overly,</p>
<p>that is involved in any aspect</p>
<p>other than to protect us from forced coercion authority.</p>
<p>And she rejects anarchy, and we can talk about that.</p>
<p>I think you had a question in the list of questions</p>
<p>you sent me about anarchy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to discuss that.</p>
<p>I just talked to Michael Malice about anarchy,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with him.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m familiar with him.</p>
<p>So yeah, so she would completely reject anarchy.</p>
<p>Anarchy is completely inconsistent with her point of view,</p>
<p>and we can talk about why if you want.</p>
<p>So there is some perfect place where freedom is maximized,</p>
<p>so systems of government and that.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And she thought that the American system of government</p>
<p>came close in its idea,</p>
<p>obviously founded with original sin, with the sin of slavery,</p>
<p>but in its conception, the Declaration of Independence</p>
<p>is about as perfect a political document as one could write.</p>
<p>I think the greatest political document in human history,</p>
<p>but really articulated almost perfectly and beautifully.</p>
<p>And that the American system of government</p>
<p>with the checks as balances,</p>
<p>which is with its emphasis on individual rights,</p>
<p>with its emphasis on freedom,</p>
<p>with its emphasis on leaving individual freedom</p>
<p>to pursue their happiness,</p>
<p>an explicit recognition of happiness as a goal,</p>
<p>individual happiness, was the model.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>There are a lot of problems to a large extent</p>
<p>because the founders had mixed philosophical premises.</p>
<p>So there were alien premises introduced</p>
<p>into the founding of the country,</p>
<p>slavery obviously being the biggest problem.</p>
<p>But it was close.</p>
<p>And we need to build on that</p>
<p>to create an ideal political system</p>
<p>that will, yes, maximize the freedom of individuals</p>
<p>to do exactly this.</p>
<p>And then of course she had,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the manifestation of this individualism</p>
<p>in a political realm.</p>
<p>And she had a theory of art.</p>
<p>She had a theory of aesthetics,</p>
<p>which is the fifth branch of,</p>
<p>she have metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and politics.</p>
<p>And the fifth branch is aesthetics.</p>
<p>And she viewed art as an essential human need,</p>
<p>a fuel for the human spirit.</p>
<p>And that just like any human need,</p>
<p>it had certain principles that it had to abide by.</p>
<p>That is just like there&rsquo;s nutrition, right?</p>
<p>So some food is good for you</p>
<p>and some food is bad for you.</p>
<p>Some food, some stuff is poison.</p>
<p>She believed the same is true of art,</p>
<p>that art had an identity,</p>
<p>which is very controversial today, right?</p>
<p>If you put a frame around it, it is art, right?</p>
<p>If you put a urinal in a museum, it becomes art,</p>
<p>which she thought was evil and ludicrous,</p>
<p>and she rejected completely.</p>
<p>That art had an identity</p>
<p>and that it served a certain function</p>
<p>that human beings needed it.</p>
<p>And if it didn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>not only did it have the identity,</p>
<p>but that function was served well by some art</p>
<p>and poorly by other art.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a whole realm of stuff that&rsquo;s not art.</p>
<p>Basically, all of what today is considered modern art,</p>
<p>she would consider as not being art.</p>
<p>Splashing paint on a canvas, not art.</p>
<p>So she had very clear ideas.</p>
<p>She articulated them not,</p>
<p>so I would say not in conventional philosophical form.</p>
<p>So she didn&rsquo;t write philosophical essays</p>
<p>using the philosopher&rsquo;s language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why, partially why I think philosophers</p>
<p>have never taken it seriously.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually accessible to us.</p>
<p>We can actually read them.</p>
<p>And she integrates the philosophy</p>
<p>in what I think are amazing ways with psychology,</p>
<p>with history, with economics, with politics,</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s going on in the world.</p>
<p>And she has dozens and dozens and dozens of essays</p>
<p>that she wrote.</p>
<p>Many of them were aggregated into books.</p>
<p>I particularly recommend books like</p>
<p>The Virtue of Selfishness,</p>
<p>Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal,</p>
<p>and Philosophy Who Needs It.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful philosophy.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re big on love.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the philosophy of love.</p>
<p>We can talk about that.</p>
<p>Essentially, it&rsquo;s about love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the philosophy is all about</p>
<p>in terms of it applying to self.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s sad that so few people read it</p>
<p>and so few intellectuals take it seriously</p>
<p>and are willing to engage with it.</p>
<p>Let me ask, that was incredible.</p>
<p>But after that beautiful whirlwind overview,</p>
<p>let me ask the most shallow of questions,</p>
<p>which is the name Objectivism.</p>
<p>How should people think about the name being rooted?</p>
<p>Why not individualism?</p>
<p>What are the options?</p>
<p>If we had a branding meeting right now.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So she actually had a branding meeting.</p>
<p>So she did this.</p>
<p>She went through the exercise.</p>
<p>Objectivism, I do not think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the details,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think Objectivism was the first name</p>
<p>she came with.</p>
<p>The problem was that the other names were taken</p>
<p>and they were not positive implications.</p>
<p>So for example, rationalism could have been a good word</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s an advocate of rational thought or reasonism,</p>
<p>but reasonism sounds weird, right?</p>
<p>The ism because of too many Ss, I guess.</p>
<p>Rationalism, but it was already a philosophy</p>
<p>and it was a philosophy inconsistent with hers</p>
<p>because it was what she considered a false view</p>
<p>of reason, of rationality.</p>
<p>Reality ism, you know, just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So she came on Objectivism.</p>
<p>And I think actually, it&rsquo;s a great word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great name because it has two aspects to it.</p>
<p>And this is a unique view</p>
<p>of what objectivity actually means.</p>
<p>In Objectivism, in objectivity is the idea</p>
<p>of an independent reality.</p>
<p>There is truth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually something out there that we,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the role of consciousness, right?</p>
<p>There is the role of figuring out the truth.</p>
<p>The truth doesn&rsquo;t just hit you.</p>
<p>The truth is not in the thing.</p>
<p>You have to discover it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that a consciousness applied to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what objectivity is, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you discovering the truth in reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your consciousness interacting.</p>
<p>And thereby posing the individual in that sense.</p>
<p>And only the individual could do it.</p>
<p>Now, the problem with individualism</p>
<p>is it would have made the philosophy too political.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And she always said, so she said,</p>
<p>she said, I&rsquo;m an advocate of capitalism</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m really an advocate for rational egoism.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a advocate for rational egoism</p>
<p>really because I&rsquo;m an advocate for reason.</p>
<p>So she viewed the essential of her philosophy</p>
<p>as being this reason and her particular view of reason.</p>
<p>And she has a whole book.</p>
<p>She has a book called</p>
<p>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,</p>
<p>which I encourage any scientist, mathematician,</p>
<p>anybody interested in science to read</p>
<p>because it is a tour de force on,</p>
<p>in a sense, what it means to hold concepts</p>
<p>and what it means to discover new discoveries</p>
<p>and to use concepts and how we use concepts.</p>
<p>And she has a theory of concepts that is completely new,</p>
<p>that is completely revolutionary.</p>
<p>And I think is essential for the philosophy of science.</p>
<p>And therefore, ultimately,</p>
<p>the more abstract we get with scientific discoveries,</p>
<p>the easier it is to detach them from reality</p>
<p>and to detach them from truth,</p>
<p>the easier it is to be inside our heads</p>
<p>instead of about what&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>And there are probably examples</p>
<p>from modern physics that fit that.</p>
<p>And I think what she teaches in the book</p>
<p>is how to ground your concepts</p>
<p>and how to bring them into grounding in reality.</p>
<p>So Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,</p>
<p>note that it&rsquo;s only an introduction</p>
<p>because one of the things she realized,</p>
<p>one of the things that I think a lot of her critics</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give enough credit for,</p>
<p>is that philosophy is, there&rsquo;s no end, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always growing, there are always new discoveries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always, it&rsquo;s like science,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always new things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a ton of work to do in philosophy,</p>
<p>and particularly in epistemology and the theory of knowledge.</p>
<p>And she was actually,</p>
<p>given your interest in mathematics,</p>
<p>she actually saw a lot of parallels</p>
<p>between math and concept formation.</p>
<p>And she was actually, in the years before she died,</p>
<p>she was taking private lessons in mathematics,</p>
<p>in algebra and calculus,</p>
<p>because she believed that there was real insight</p>
<p>in understanding algebra in calculus</p>
<p>to philosophy and to epistemology.</p>
<p>And she also was very interested in neuroscience</p>
<p>because she believed that that had a lot to tell us</p>
<p>about epistemology, but also about music,</p>
<p>therefore about aesthetics.</p>
<p>So, I mean, she recognized the importance</p>
<p>of all these different fields</p>
<p>and the beauty of philosophy</p>
<p>is it should be integrating all of them.</p>
<p>And one of the sad things about the world in which we live</p>
<p>is again, we view these things as silos.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t view them as integrating.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have teams of people from different arena,</p>
<p>you know, different fields, you know, discovering things.</p>
<p>We become like ants, specialized.</p>
<p>So she was definitely like that.</p>
<p>And she was constantly curious,</p>
<p>constantly interested in new discoveries and new ideas</p>
<p>and how this could expand the scope of her philosophy</p>
<p>and the application of her philosophy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a million topics I could talk to you,</p>
<p>but since you mentioned math, I&rsquo;m almost curious.</p>
<p>We only got three hours.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost curious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with Gayle&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It was a powerful proof that any axiomatic systems,</p>
<p>when you start from a bunch of axioms,</p>
<p>that there will, in that system,</p>
<p>provably must be an inconsistency.</p>
<p>So that was this painful like stab</p>
<p>in the idea of mathematics that, no,</p>
<p>if we start with a set of assumptions,</p>
<p>kind of like Ayn Rand started with objectivism,</p>
<p>there will have to be at least one contradiction.</p>
<p>See, I intuitively am gonna say that&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>Philosophically, but in math, it&rsquo;s just true.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question about how you define,</p>
<p>again, definitions matter,</p>
<p>and you have to be careful on how you define axioms.</p>
<p>And you have to be careful about what you define</p>
<p>as an inconsistency and what that means</p>
<p>to say there&rsquo;s an inconsistency.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say more than that,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m suspicious that there is some&hellip;</p>
<p>And this is the power of philosophy.</p>
<p>And this is why I said before,</p>
<p>concept formation is so important.</p>
<p>And understanding concept formation is so important,</p>
<p>for particularly, again, mathematics,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such an abstract field.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so easy to lose grounding in reality</p>
<p>that if you properly define axioms,</p>
<p>and you properly define what you&rsquo;re doing in math,</p>
<p>whether that is true.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it is.</p>
<p>This is a&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll leave it as an open mystery,</p>
<p>because actually, this audience,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s literally over 100,000 people that have PhDs.</p>
<p>So they know Gaydo&rsquo;s The Compliance Theorem.</p>
<p>I have this intuition that there&rsquo;s something different</p>
<p>to mathematics and philosophy</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d love to hear from people.</p>
<p>Like, what exactly is that difference?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a precision to mathematics</p>
<p>that philosophy doesn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>but that precision gets you in trouble.</p>
<p>It somehow, it actually takes you away from truth.</p>
<p>Like, the very constraints of the language used</p>
<p>in mathematics actually puts a constraint</p>
<p>on the capture of truth that it&rsquo;s able to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna argue that that is a total product</p>
<p>of the way you&rsquo;re conceptualizing</p>
<p>the terms within mathematics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you would argue it&rsquo;s in the fact</p>
<p>that mathematics, in as much as it&rsquo;s detached from reality,</p>
<p>that you can do these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yes, and that mathematicians have come up with concepts</p>
<p>that they haven&rsquo;t grounded in reality properly</p>
<p>that allows them to go off in places</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t lead to truth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that don&rsquo;t lead to truth.</p>
<p>But I encourage you then, I encourage you</p>
<p>to do one of these podcasts with one of our philosophers</p>
<p>who know more about this stuff.</p>
<p>And if you move to Austin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got somebody I&rsquo;d recommend to you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got somebody I&rsquo;d recommend to you.</p>
<p>Can you throw a name out, or no?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I would talk to Greg Saumieri.</p>
<p>When you say our, can you say what you mean by our?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say people who are affiliated</p>
<p>with the Ironman Institute are philosophers</p>
<p>who are affiliated with objectivism.</p>
<p>And Greg is one of our brightest, and he&rsquo;s in Austin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just got a position at UT,</p>
<p>so at the University of Texas.</p>
<p>And he would want, Ankar Gatte would be another one</p>
<p>who works at the Institute and a chief philosophy officer</p>
<p>at the Institute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And there are others who specialize in philosophy</p>
<p>of science who I think Greg could probably give you a lead.</p>
<p>But these are unbelievably smart people</p>
<p>who know this part of the philosophy much better than I do.</p>
<p>What, can you just briefly perhaps say</p>
<p>what is the Ironman Institute?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the Ironman Institute was an organization founded</p>
<p>three years after Ironman died.</p>
<p>She died in 1982.</p>
<p>And it was founded in 1985 to promote her ideas,</p>
<p>to make sure that her ideas and her novels</p>
<p>continued in the culture and were relevant.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re relevant, but the people saw the relevance.</p>
<p>So our mission is to get people to read her books,</p>
<p>to engage in the ideas.</p>
<p>We teach, we have the Objectivist Academic Center</p>
<p>where we teach the philosophy,</p>
<p>primarily to graduate students and others</p>
<p>who take their ideas seriously</p>
<p>and who really want a deep understanding of the philosophy.</p>
<p>And we apply the ideas.</p>
<p>So we take the ideas and apply them to ethics,</p>
<p>to philosophy, to issues of the day,</p>
<p>which is more my strength and more what I tend to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never formally studied philosophy.</p>
<p>So all my education philosophy is informal.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m an engineer and a finance guy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my background.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a numbers guy.</p>
<p>Well, let me, I feel pretty undereducated.</p>
<p>I have a pretty open mind,</p>
<p>which sometimes can be painful on the internet</p>
<p>because people mock me or,</p>
<p>if I say something nuanced about communism,</p>
<p>people immediately kind of put you in a bin</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It hurts to be open minded to say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, to ask the question,</p>
<p>why is communism or Marxism so problematic?</p>
<p>Why is capitalism problematic and so on?</p>
<p>But let me nevertheless go into that direction with you.</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s talk about capitalism a little bit.</p>
<p>How does Objectivism compare,</p>
<p>relate to the idea of capitalism?</p>
<p>Well, first we have to define what capitalism is.</p>
<p>Cause again, people use capitalism in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And I know you had Ray Dalio on your show once.</p>
<p>I need to listen to that episode.</p>
<p>But Ray has no clue what capitalism is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s his big problem.</p>
<p>So when he says there are real problems today in capitalism,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not talking about capitalism.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talking about problems in the world today.</p>
<p>And I agree with many of the problems,</p>
<p>but they have nothing to do with capitalism.</p>
<p>Capitalism is a social, political, economic system</p>
<p>in which all property is privately owned</p>
<p>and in which the only role of government</p>
<p>is the protection of individual rights.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the ideal system.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the right system</p>
<p>for the reasons we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a system that leaves you as an individual</p>
<p>to pursue your values, your life, your happiness,</p>
<p>free of coercion and force.</p>
<p>And you get to decide what happens to you.</p>
<p>And I get to decide if to help you or not, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you fall flat on your face.</p>
<p>People always say, well, what about the poor?</p>
<p>Well, if you care about the poor, help them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t, you know, what do you need a government for?</p>
<p>You know, I always ask audiences, okay,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a poor kid who can&rsquo;t afford to go to school</p>
<p>and all the schools are private</p>
<p>because capitalism is being instituted</p>
<p>and he can&rsquo;t go to school,</p>
<p>would you be willing to participate in a fund</p>
<p>that pays for his education?</p>
<p>Every hand in the room goes up.</p>
<p>So what do you need government for?</p>
<p>Just let&rsquo;s get all the money together and pay for schooling.</p>
<p>So the point is that what capitalism does</p>
<p>is leave individuals free to make their own decisions.</p>
<p>And as long as they&rsquo;re not violating other people&rsquo;s rights,</p>
<p>in other words, as long as they&rsquo;re not using coercion force</p>
<p>on other people, then leave them alone.</p>
<p>And people are going to make mistakes</p>
<p>and people are gonna screw up their lives</p>
<p>and people are gonna commit suicide.</p>
<p>People are gonna do terrible things to themselves.</p>
<p>That is fundamentally their problem.</p>
<p>And if you want to help,</p>
<p>you under capitalism are free to help.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the only thing that doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>under capitalism is you don&rsquo;t get to impose your will</p>
<p>on other people.</p>
<p>Now, how&rsquo;s that a bad thing?</p>
<p>So the question then is how does the implementation</p>
<p>of capitalism deviate from its ideal in practice?</p>
<p>I mean, this is what is the question with a lot of systems</p>
<p>is how does it start to then fail?</p>
<p>So one thing maybe you can correct me or inform me,</p>
<p>it seems like information is very important.</p>
<p>Like being able to make decisions, to be free,</p>
<p>you have to have access, full access</p>
<p>of all the information you need to make rational decisions.</p>
<p>No, that can&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Because it can be right, because none of us has full access</p>
<p>to all the information we need.</p>
<p>I mean, what does that even mean?</p>
<p>And how big, how much of the scope do you wanna do?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just start there.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you need to have access to information.</p>
<p>So one of the big criticisms of capitalism</p>
<p>is this asymmetrical information.</p>
<p>The drug maker has more information about the drug</p>
<p>than the drug buyer, pharmaceutical drugs.</p>
<p>True, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder if one can think about,</p>
<p>an entrepreneur can think about how to solve that problem.</p>
<p>See, I view any one of these challenges to capitalism</p>
<p>as an opportunity for entrepreneur to make money.</p>
<p>And they have the freedom to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so imagine an entrepreneur steps in and says,</p>
<p>I will test all the drugs that drug companies make,</p>
<p>and I will provide you for a fee with the answer.</p>
<p>And how do I know he&rsquo;s not gonna be corrupted?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;ll be other ones and they&rsquo;ll compete.</p>
<p>And who am I to tell which one of these is the right one?</p>
<p>Well, it won&rsquo;t be you really getting</p>
<p>the information from them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be your doctor.</p>
<p>The doctors need that information.</p>
<p>So the doctor who has some expertise in medicine</p>
<p>will be evaluating which rating agency to use</p>
<p>to evaluate the drugs and which ones then</p>
<p>to recommend to you.</p>
<p>So do we need an FDA?</p>
<p>Do we need a government that siphons all the information</p>
<p>to one source that does all the research, all the thing,</p>
<p>and has a clear incentive, by the way,</p>
<p>not to approve drugs.</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t make any money from it.</p>
<p>Nobody pays them for the information.</p>
<p>Nobody pays them to be accurate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re bureaucrats at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And what is a bureaucrat?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the main focus of a bureaucrat?</p>
<p>Even if they go in with the best of intentions,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m sure all the scientists at the FDA</p>
<p>have the best of intentions, what&rsquo;s their incentive?</p>
<p>The system builds in this incentive not to screw up.</p>
<p>Because one drug gets value and does damage,</p>
<p>you lose your job.</p>
<p>But if a hundred drugs that could cure cancer tomorrow</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever get to market,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s gonna come after you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s not a mechanism,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s conducive to like&hellip;</p>
<p>You see, the marketplace is competition.</p>
<p>So if you won&rsquo;t approve the drug,</p>
<p>if I still think it&rsquo;s possible, I will.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not zero one.</p>
<p>You see the other thing that happens with the FDA</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s zero one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either approved or it&rsquo;s not approved.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s approved for this, but it&rsquo;s not approved for that.</p>
<p>But what if a drug came out and you said, right?</p>
<p>You told the doctors,</p>
<p>this drug in 10% of the cases can cause patients</p>
<p>an increased risk of heart disease.</p>
<p>You and your patients should,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not forcing you, but you should, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your medical responsibility to evaluate that</p>
<p>and decide if the drug is appropriate or not.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I get to make that choice</p>
<p>if I wanna take on the 10% risk of heart disease?</p>
<p>So there was a drug, and right now I forget the name,</p>
<p>but it was a drug against pain,</p>
<p>particularly for arthritic pain, and it worked.</p>
<p>It reduced pain dramatically, right?</p>
<p>And some people tried everything,</p>
<p>and this was the only drug that reduced their pain.</p>
<p>And it turned out that in 10% of the cases,</p>
<p>it caused the elevated risk.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t kill people necessarily,</p>
<p>but it caused elevated risk of heart disease.</p>
<p>Okay, what did the FDA do?</p>
<p>It banned the drug.</p>
<p>Some people, I know a lot of people who said</p>
<p>living with pain is much worse than taking on a 10% risk.</p>
<p>Again, probabilities, right?</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t think in those numbers.</p>
<p>10% risk of maybe getting heart disease.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I get to make that choice?</p>
<p>Why does some bureaucrat make that choice for me?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s capitalism.</p>
<p>Capitalism gives you the choice,</p>
<p>not you as an ignorant person.</p>
<p>You with your doctor and a whole marketplace,</p>
<p>which is not created to provide you with information.</p>
<p>And think about a world where we didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>all these regulations and controls.</p>
<p>The amount of opportunities that would exist</p>
<p>to create, to provide information,</p>
<p>to educate you about that information,</p>
<p>would mushroom dramatically.</p>
<p>Bloomberg, you know, the billionaire,</p>
<p>Bloomberg, you know, how did he make his money?</p>
<p>He made his money by providing financial information,</p>
<p>by creating this service called Bloomberg</p>
<p>that you buy a terminal and you get</p>
<p>all this amazing information.</p>
<p>And he was before computers, desktop computers.</p>
<p>I mean, he was very early on</p>
<p>in that whole computing revolution,</p>
<p>but his focus was providing financial information</p>
<p>to professionals.</p>
<p>And you hire a professional to manage your money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be.</p>
<p>You know, you have to have,</p>
<p>so you as an individual cannot have</p>
<p>all the knowledge you need in medicine,</p>
<p>all the knowledge you need in finance,</p>
<p>all the knowledge you need in every aspect of your life.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You have to delegate and you hire a doctor.</p>
<p>Now you should be able to figure out</p>
<p>if the doctor&rsquo;s good or not.</p>
<p>You should be able to ask doctors for reasons</p>
<p>for why you have to make the decision at the end.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why you have a doctor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have a financial advisor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have different people</p>
<p>who you&rsquo;re delegating certain aspects of your life to,</p>
<p>but you want choices.</p>
<p>And what the marketplace provides is those choices.</p>
<p>So let me then,</p>
<p>this is what I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make a dumb case for things</p>
<p>and then you shut me down</p>
<p>and then the internet says how dumb Lex is.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>This is how it works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good at shutting down and they&rsquo;re foolish</p>
<p>in blaming you for the question</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re here to ask me questions.</p>
<p>Let me make a case for socialism.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be bad because that&rsquo;s the only case</p>
<p>there is for socialism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s reality.</p>
<p>So perhaps it&rsquo;s not a case for socialism,</p>
<p>but just a certain notion that inequality,</p>
<p>the wealth inequality,</p>
<p>that the bigger the gap between the poorest</p>
<p>or the average and the richest,</p>
<p>the more painful it is to be average.</p>
<p>Psychologically speaking,</p>
<p>if you know that there is the CEOs of companies</p>
<p>make 300, 1000, 1 million times more than you do,</p>
<p>that makes life for a large part of the population</p>
<p>less fulfilling.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a relative notion to the experience of our life</p>
<p>that even though everybody&rsquo;s life has gotten better</p>
<p>over the past decades and centuries,</p>
<p>it may feel actually worse</p>
<p>because you know that life could be so,</p>
<p>so much better in the life of the CEOs</p>
<p>that yeah, that gap is fundamentally a thing</p>
<p>that is undesirable in a society.</p>
<p>Everything about that is wrong.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I like to start off like that.</p>
<p>Which, so I mean,</p>
<p>so my wife likes to remind me</p>
<p>that as well as we&rsquo;ve done in life,</p>
<p>we are actually from a wealth perspective</p>
<p>closer to a homeless person than we are to Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Just a math, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good ego check.</p>
<p>When I look at Bill Gates,</p>
<p>I get a smile on my face.</p>
<p>I love Bill Gates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met Bill Gates.</p>
<p>I love Bill Gates.</p>
<p>I love what he stands for.</p>
<p>I love that he has $100 billion.</p>
<p>I love that he has built a trampoline room in his house</p>
<p>where his kids can jump up and down in a trampoline</p>
<p>in a safe environment.</p>
<p>Can we take another billionaire?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s all kinds of conspiracy theories</p>
<p>about Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Well, but that&rsquo;s part of the story, right?</p>
<p>They have to pull him down</p>
<p>because people resent him for other reasons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s strange.</p>
<p>But yes, we can take Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>We can say my favorite, historically,</p>
<p>just because I like a lot about him, was Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>I mean, I love these people.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t, there are very few billionaires I don&rsquo;t love.</p>
<p>In the sense that I appreciate everything they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>for me, for people I cherish and love,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve made the world a better place.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Would it ever cross my mind that they make me look bad</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re richer than me</p>
<p>or that I don&rsquo;t have what they have?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve made me so much richer</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve made inventions that used to cost millions</p>
<p>and millions and millions of dollars accessible to me.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a supercomputer in my pocket.</p>
<p>Now, but think about it, right?</p>
<p>What is the difference between,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get to the essence of your point in a minute,</p>
<p>but think about what the difference is</p>
<p>between me and Bill Gates in terms of,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s true that in terms of wealth,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m closer to the homeless person,</p>
<p>but in terms of my day to day life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m closer to Bill Gates.</p>
<p>You know, we both live in a nice house.</p>
<p>His is nicer, but we live in a nice house.</p>
<p>His is bigger, but mine is plenty big.</p>
<p>We both drive cars.</p>
<p>His is nicer, but we both drive cars.</p>
<p>We both drive cars, cars, 100 years ago, what cars?</p>
<p>We both can fly, get on a plane in Los Angeles</p>
<p>and fly to New York and get there in about the same time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both flying private.</p>
<p>The only difference is my private plane</p>
<p>I share with 300 other people and his,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s accessible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s relatively comfortable.</p>
<p>Again, in the perspective of 50 years ago, 100 years ago,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unimaginable that I could fly like that</p>
<p>for such a low fee.</p>
<p>We live very similar lives in that sense.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t resent him.</p>
<p>So first of all, I&rsquo;m an exception to the supposed rule</p>
<p>that people resent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody, I don&rsquo;t think people do resent</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re taught to resent.</p>
<p>And this is the key.</p>
<p>People are taught and I&rsquo;ve seen this in America.</p>
<p>And this is to me the most horrible shocking thing</p>
<p>that has happened in America over the last 40 years.</p>
<p>I came to America, so I&rsquo;m an immigrant.</p>
<p>I came to America from Israel in 1987.</p>
<p>And I came here because I thought this was the place</p>
<p>where I could, where I&rsquo;d had the most opportunities</p>
<p>and it is, most opportunities.</p>
<p>And I came here because I believed</p>
<p>there was a certain American spirit of individualism</p>
<p>and exactly the opposite of what you just described.</p>
<p>A sense of I live my life, it&rsquo;s my happiness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking at my neighbor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not competing with the Joneses.</p>
<p>The American dream is my dream.</p>
<p>My two kids, my dog, my station wagon.</p>
<p>Not because other people have it, it&rsquo;s because I want it.</p>
<p>In that sense, and when I came here in the 80s,</p>
<p>you had that.</p>
<p>You had, you still had it.</p>
<p>It was less than I think it had been in the past.</p>
<p>But you had that spirit.</p>
<p>There was no envy.</p>
<p>There was no resentment.</p>
<p>There were rich people and they were celebrated.</p>
<p>There was still this admiration for entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and admiration for success.</p>
<p>Not by everybody, certainly not by the intellectuals,</p>
<p>but by the average person.</p>
<p>I have witnessed particularly over the last 10 years</p>
<p>a complete transformation</p>
<p>and America&rsquo;s become like Europe.</p>
<p>I know, are you Russian?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become Russian in a sense where,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;ve always done these studies.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll give you a hundred dollars</p>
<p>and your neighbor a hundred dollars</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll give you, what was it, I&rsquo;ll give you a thousand</p>
<p>dollars but your neighbor gets $10,000</p>
<p>and a Russian will always choose the hundred dollars, right?</p>
<p>He wants equality above being better himself.</p>
<p>Americans would always choose that gap.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s changing.</p>
<p>My sense is not anymore.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s changing because we&rsquo;ve been told it should change.</p>
<p>And morally you&rsquo;re saying that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no sense in which, let me put another spin.</p>
<p>I forget the book, but the sense of,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re working for Steve Jobs and your hands,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the engineer behind the iPhone</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a sense in which his salary</p>
<p>is stealing from your efforts.</p>
<p>Because I forget the book, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally the terminology is used, right?</p>
<p>This is straight out of Karl Marx.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s also straight out of Karl Marx.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no sense morally speaking</p>
<p>that you see that as the theft.</p>
<p>The other way around.</p>
<p>That engineer is stealing off of,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not stealing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>But the engineer is getting more from Steve Jobs</p>
<p>by a lot, not by a little bit,</p>
<p>than Steve Jobs is getting from the engineer.</p>
<p>The engineer, even if they&rsquo;re a great engineer,</p>
<p>there are probably other great engineers</p>
<p>that could replace him.</p>
<p>Would he even have a job without Steve Jobs?</p>
<p>Would the industry exist without Steve Jobs?</p>
<p>Without the giants that carry these things forward?</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re a scientist.</p>
<p>Do you resent Einstein for being smarter than you?</p>
<p>I mean, and VM, are you angry with him?</p>
<p>Would you feel negative towards him</p>
<p>if he was in the room right now?</p>
<p>Or would you, if he came into the room,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, oh my God.</p>
<p>I mean, you interview people who I think some of them</p>
<p>are probably smarter than you and me.</p>
<p>And your attitude towards them is one of reverence.</p>
<p>Well, one interesting little side question there</p>
<p>is what is the natural state of being for us humans?</p>
<p>You kind of implied education has polluted our minds,</p>
<p>but like if I, because you&rsquo;re referring to jealousy,</p>
<p>the Einstein question, the Steve Jobs question,</p>
<p>I wonder which way, if we&rsquo;re left without education,</p>
<p>we would naturally go.</p>
<p>So there is no such thing as the natural state</p>
<p>in that sense, right?</p>
<p>This is the myth of who so is a noble savage</p>
<p>and of John Walls is behind the veil of ignorance.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re ignorant, you&rsquo;re ignorant.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make any decisions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just ignorant.</p>
<p>There is no human nature that determines</p>
<p>how you will relate to other people.</p>
<p>You will relate to other people based on the conclusions</p>
<p>you come to about how to relate to other people.</p>
<p>You can relate to other people as values</p>
<p>to use your terminology from the perspective of love.</p>
<p>This other human being is a value to me</p>
<p>and I want to trade with them and trade,</p>
<p>the beauty of trade is it&rsquo;s win, win.</p>
<p>I want to benefit and they are going to benefit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to screw them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to screw me.</p>
<p>I want us to be win, win.</p>
<p>Or you can deal with other people as threats, as enemies.</p>
<p>Much of human history, we have done that.</p>
<p>And therefore, as a zero sum world,</p>
<p>what they have, I want, I will take it.</p>
<p>I will use force to take it.</p>
<p>I will use political force to take it.</p>
<p>I will use the force of my arm to take it.</p>
<p>I will just take it.</p>
<p>So those are two options, right?</p>
<p>And they will determine whether we live</p>
<p>in civilization or not.</p>
<p>And they are determined by conclusions people come to</p>
<p>about the world and the nature of reality</p>
<p>and the nature of morality and the nature of politics</p>
<p>and all these things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re determined by philosophy.</p>
<p>And this is why philosophy is so important</p>
<p>because the philosophy shapes,</p>
<p>evolution doesn&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just happen.</p>
<p>Ideas shape how we relate to other people.</p>
<p>And you say, well, little children do it.</p>
<p>Well, little children don&rsquo;t have a frontal cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not relevant, right?</p>
<p>What happens as you develop a frontal cortex,</p>
<p>as you develop the brain, you learn ideas.</p>
<p>And those ideas will shape how you relate to other people.</p>
<p>And if you learn good ideas,</p>
<p>you relate to other people in a healthy, productive win, win.</p>
<p>And if you develop bad ideas,</p>
<p>you will resent other people and you will want their stuff.</p>
<p>And the thing is that human progress depends</p>
<p>on the win, win relationship.</p>
<p>It depends on civilization, depends on peace.</p>
<p>It depends on allowing people,</p>
<p>going back to what we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>allowing people the freedom to think for themselves.</p>
<p>And anytime you try to interrupt that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re causing damage.</p>
<p>So this change in America is not some reversion</p>
<p>to a natural state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shift in ideas.</p>
<p>We still live, the better part of American society</p>
<p>and the world, still lives on the remnants</p>
<p>of the Enlightenment, the Enlightenment ideas,</p>
<p>the ideas that brought about this scientific revolution,</p>
<p>the ideas that brought about the creation of this country.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same basic ideas that led to both of those.</p>
<p>And as those ideas get more distant,</p>
<p>as those ideas are not defended,</p>
<p>as those ideas disappear, as Enlightenment goes away,</p>
<p>we will become more violent, more resentful,</p>
<p>more tribal, more obnoxious, more unpleasant,</p>
<p>more primitive.</p>
<p>A very specific example of this that bothers me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to get your comment on.</p>
<p>So Elon Musk is a billionaire.</p>
<p>And one of the things that really,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s almost a pet peeve,</p>
<p>it really bothers me when the press</p>
<p>and the general public will say,</p>
<p>well, all those rockets they&rsquo;re sending up there,</p>
<p>those are just like the toys,</p>
<p>the games that billionaires play.</p>
<p>That to me, billionaire has become a dirty word to use,</p>
<p>like as if money can buy or has anything to do with genius.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to articulate a specific line of question here</p>
<p>because it just bothers me.</p>
<p>I guess the question is how do we get here</p>
<p>and how do we get out of that?</p>
<p>Because Elon Musk is doing some of the most incredible things</p>
<p>that a human being has ever participated in.</p>
<p>Mostly, he doesn&rsquo;t build the rockets himself,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting a bunch of other geniuses together that have.</p>
<p>That takes genius.</p>
<p>But where do we go and how do we get back</p>
<p>to where Elon Musk is an inspiring figure</p>
<p>as opposed to a billionaire playing with some toys?</p>
<p>So this is the role of philosophy.</p>
<p>It goes back to the same place.</p>
<p>It goes back to our understanding of the world</p>
<p>and our role in it.</p>
<p>And if you understand that the only way</p>
<p>to become a billionaire, for example,</p>
<p>is to create value.</p>
<p>Value for whom?</p>
<p>Value for people who are gonna consume it.</p>
<p>The only way to become a billionaire,</p>
<p>the only way Elon Musk became a billionaire is through PayPal.</p>
<p>Now, PayPal is something we all use.</p>
<p>PayPal is an enormous value to all of us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s worth several billions of dollars</p>
<p>which Elon Musk could then earn.</p>
<p>But you cannot become a billionaire in a free society</p>
<p>by exploiting people.</p>
<p>You cannot because you&rsquo;ll be laughed.</p>
<p>Nobody will deal with you.</p>
<p>Nobody will have any interactions with you.</p>
<p>The only way to become a billionaire</p>
<p>is to do billions of win, win transactions.</p>
<p>So the only way to become a billionaire in a free society</p>
<p>is to change the world to make it a better place.</p>
<p>Billionaires are the great humanitarians of our time,</p>
<p>not because they give charity,</p>
<p>but because they make them billions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true that money and genius</p>
<p>are not necessarily correlated,</p>
<p>but you cannot become a billionaire</p>
<p>without being super smart.</p>
<p>You cannot become a billionaire by figuring something out</p>
<p>that nobody else has figured out</p>
<p>in whatever realm it happens to be.</p>
<p>And that thing that you figure out</p>
<p>has to be something that provides immense value</p>
<p>to other people.</p>
<p>Where do we go wrong?</p>
<p>We go wrong, our culture goes wrong</p>
<p>because it views billionaires as selfish.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sense in which,</p>
<p>not a sense, it&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>The billionaire doesn&rsquo;t ask for my opinion</p>
<p>on what product to launch.</p>
<p>Elon Musk doesn&rsquo;t ask others</p>
<p>what they think he should spend his money on,</p>
<p>what the greatest social wellbeing will be.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a sense in which the rockets are his toys.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which he chose</p>
<p>that he would be inspired the most.</p>
<p>He would have the most fun</p>
<p>by going to Mars and building rockets.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s probably dreamt of rockets</p>
<p>from when he was a kid</p>
<p>and probably always played with rockets.</p>
<p>And now he has the funds, the capital</p>
<p>to be able to deploy it.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s being selfish.</p>
<p>Obviously, he&rsquo;s being self interested.</p>
<p>This is what Elon Musk is about.</p>
<p>I mean, the same with Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no committee to decide whether to invest</p>
<p>in cloud computing or not.</p>
<p>Bezos decided that.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>they are the bosses,</p>
<p>they pursue the values they believe are good.</p>
<p>They create the wealth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their decisions, it&rsquo;s their mind.</p>
<p>And the fact is we live in a world</p>
<p>where for 2000 plus years,</p>
<p>self interest, even though we all do it,</p>
<p>just more extent to the less,</p>
<p>we deem it as morally apparent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, your mother probably taught you the same thing</p>
<p>my mother taught me.</p>
<p>Think of others first.</p>
<p>Think of yourself last.</p>
<p>The good stuff is kept for the guests.</p>
<p>You never get to use the good stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the focus of morality is.</p>
<p>Now, no mother, even no Jewish mother</p>
<p>actually believes that, right?</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t really want you to be last.</p>
<p>They want you to be first and they push you to be first.</p>
<p>But morally, they&rsquo;ve been taught their entire lives</p>
<p>and they believe that the right thing to say</p>
<p>and to some extent do</p>
<p>is to argue for sacrifice for other people, right?</p>
<p>So most people, 99% of people are torn.</p>
<p>They know they should be selfless,</p>
<p>sacrifice, live for other people.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really want to.</p>
<p>So they act selfishly in their day to day life</p>
<p>and they feel guilty and they can&rsquo;t be happy.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t be happy.</p>
<p>And Jewish mothers and Catholic mothers are excellent</p>
<p>at using that guilt to manipulate you.</p>
<p>But the guilt is inevitable</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got these two conflicting things,</p>
<p>the way you want to live</p>
<p>and the way you&rsquo;ve been taught to live.</p>
<p>And what objectivism does is that at the end of the day</p>
<p>provides you with a way to unite morality,</p>
<p>a proper morality with what you want</p>
<p>and to think about what you really want,</p>
<p>to conceptualize what you really want properly.</p>
<p>So what you want is really good for you</p>
<p>and what you want will really lead to your happiness.</p>
<p>So, you know, we reject the idea of sacrifice.</p>
<p>We reject the idea of living for other people,</p>
<p>but you see, if you believe that the purpose of morality</p>
<p>is to sacrifice for other people</p>
<p>and you look at Jeff Bezos,</p>
<p>when was the last time he sacrificed anything, right?</p>
<p>He was living pretty well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got billions that he could give it all away</p>
<p>and yet he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>How dare he?</p>
<p>You know, in my talks, I often position,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna use Bill Gates,</p>
<p>sorry guys, drop the conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all BS, complete and utter nonsense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a shred of truth.</p>
<p>You know, I disagree with Bill Gates</p>
<p>on everything political.</p>
<p>I think he politically is a complete ignoramus,</p>
<p>but the guy&rsquo;s a genius when it comes to technology</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just thoughtful even in this philanthropy.</p>
<p>He just uses his mind and I respect that</p>
<p>even though politically he&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Anyway, think about this.</p>
<p>Who had a bigger impact on the lives</p>
<p>of poor people in the world?</p>
<p>Bill Gates or Mother Teresa?</p>
<p>Bill Gates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even close.</p>
<p>And Mother Teresa lived this altruistic life to the core.</p>
<p>She lived it consistently.</p>
<p>And yet she was miserable, pathetic, horrible.</p>
<p>She hated her life.</p>
<p>She was miserable.</p>
<p>And most of the people she helped didn&rsquo;t do very well</p>
<p>because she just helped them not die, right?</p>
<p>And then Bill Gates changed the world</p>
<p>and he helped a lot by providing technology.</p>
<p>We even, philanthropy gets to them.</p>
<p>The food gets them, much fancier, more efficient.</p>
<p>Yet who is the moral saint?</p>
<p>Sainthood is not determined based on</p>
<p>what you do for other people.</p>
<p>Sainthood is based on how much pain you suffer.</p>
<p>I like to ask people to go to a museum</p>
<p>and look at all the paintings of saints.</p>
<p>How many of them are smiling and are happy?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve usually got arrows through them</p>
<p>and holes in their body</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just suffering a horrible death.</p>
<p>The whole point of the morality we are taught</p>
<p>is that happiness is immorality,</p>
<p>that happy people cannot be good people,</p>
<p>and that good people suffer</p>
<p>and that suffering is necessary for morality.</p>
<p>Morality is about self sacrifice and suffering.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>almost all the problems in the world</p>
<p>boil down to that false view.</p>
<p>So can we try to talk about,</p>
<p>part of it is the problem of the word selfishness,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about the virtue of selfishness.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start at the fact that for me,</p>
<p>I really enjoy doing stuff for other people.</p>
<p>I enjoy cheering on the success of others.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deep in that.</p>
<p>Well, think about it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I think you do know.</p>
<p>If I were to really think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to resort to like evolutionary arguments</p>
<p>or like this is somehow different.</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>So I can tell you why I enjoy helping others.</p>
<p>Maybe you can go there.</p>
<p>Like one thing,</p>
<p>cause we should talk about love a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you there&rsquo;s a part of me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit not rational.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a gut that I follow</p>
<p>that not everything I do is perfectly rational.</p>
<p>For example, my dad criticizes me.</p>
<p>He says like, you should always have a plan.</p>
<p>Like it should make sense.</p>
<p>You have a strategy.</p>
<p>And I say that,</p>
<p>I left, I stepped down from my full salary position</p>
<p>at MIT.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things I did without like a plan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I want to start a company.</p>
<p>Well, you know how many companies fail?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gut.</p>
<p>And the same thing with being kind to others is a gut.</p>
<p>I watched the way that karma works in this world</p>
<p>that the people like us,</p>
<p>one guy I look up to is Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>that he does stuff for others.</p>
<p>And that the joy he experiences,</p>
<p>the way he sees the world,</p>
<p>like just the glimmer in his eyes</p>
<p>because he does stuff for others</p>
<p>that creates a joyful experience.</p>
<p>And that somehow seems to be an instructive way to,</p>
<p>that to me is inspiring of a life well lived.</p>
<p>But you probably know a lot of people</p>
<p>who have done stuff for others who are not happy.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the doing stuff for others</p>
<p>that just brings the happiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why you do stuff for others</p>
<p>and what else you&rsquo;re doing in your life</p>
<p>and what is the proportion.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s why at the end of the day, which is,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>Look, you can maybe through a gut feeling say,</p>
<p>I wanna start a company,</p>
<p>but you better start doing thinking</p>
<p>about how and what and all of that.</p>
<p>And to some extent the why,</p>
<p>because if you really wanna be happy doing this,</p>
<p>you better make sure you&rsquo;re doing it for the right reason.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called fast thinking,</p>
<p>Carlman, the Daniel Kahneman.</p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman talks about,</p>
<p>and there is, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>all the integrations you&rsquo;ve made so far in your life</p>
<p>cause you to have specialized knowledge and certain things</p>
<p>and you can think very fast</p>
<p>and your gut tells you what the right answer is.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s your mind is constantly evaluating</p>
<p>and constantly working.</p>
<p>You wanna make it as rational as you can,</p>
<p>not in the sense that I have to think through</p>
<p>every time I make a decision,</p>
<p>but that they&rsquo;ve so programmed my mind in a sense</p>
<p>that the answers are the right answers,</p>
<p>you know, when I get them.</p>
<p>So, you know, I like, I view other people as a value.</p>
<p>Other people contribute enormously to my life,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a romantic love relationship</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s a friendship relationship</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos creating Amazon</p>
<p>and delivering goodies to my home when I get them.</p>
<p>And people do all that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>He gets the most credit,</p>
<p>but everybody in that chain of command,</p>
<p>everybody at Amazon is working for me.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I love the idea of a human being.</p>
<p>I love the idea that there are people capable</p>
<p>of being an Einstein, of being, you know,</p>
<p>and creating and building and making stuff</p>
<p>that makes my life so good.</p>
<p>You know, most of us like,</p>
<p>this is not a good room for an example.</p>
<p>Most of us like plants, right?</p>
<p>We like pets.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly, but people like pets.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>We like to see life.</p>
<p>Human beings are life on steroids, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re life with a brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, right, what they can do.</p>
<p>I love people.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean I love everybody</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>there are really bad people out there who I hate, right?</p>
<p>And I do hate.</p>
<p>And there are people out there that are just,</p>
<p>I have no opinion about.</p>
<p>But generally the idea of a human being</p>
<p>to me is a phenomenal idea.</p>
<p>When I see a baby, I light up</p>
<p>because to me there&rsquo;s a potential, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this magnificent potential</p>
<p>that is embodied in that.</p>
<p>And when I see people struggling and need help,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re human beings.</p>
<p>You know, they embody that potential.</p>
<p>They embody that goodness.</p>
<p>They might turn out to be bad,</p>
<p>but why would I ever give the presumption of that?</p>
<p>I give them the presumption of the positive</p>
<p>and I cheer them on.</p>
<p>And I enjoy watching people succeed.</p>
<p>I enjoy watching people get to the top of the mountain</p>
<p>and produce something.</p>
<p>Even if I don&rsquo;t get anything directly from it,</p>
<p>I enjoy that because it&rsquo;s part of my enjoyment of life.</p>
<p>So the word, to you, the morality of selfishness,</p>
<p>this kind of love of other human beings,</p>
<p>the love of life fits into a morality of selfishness.</p>
<p>Cannot, because there&rsquo;s no context</p>
<p>in which you can truly love yourself</p>
<p>without loving life and loving what it means to be human.</p>
<p>So, you know, the love of yourself is gonna manifest itself</p>
<p>definitely in different people, but it&rsquo;s core.</p>
<p>What do you love about yourself?</p>
<p>First of all, I love that I&rsquo;m alive.</p>
<p>I love this world and the opportunities it provides me</p>
<p>and the fun and the excitement of discovering something new</p>
<p>and meeting a new person and having a conversation.</p>
<p>You know, all of this is immensely enjoyable,</p>
<p>but behind all of that is a particular human character.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular human capability</p>
<p>that not only I have, other people have.</p>
<p>And the fact that they have it makes my life</p>
<p>so much more fun because, so it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you cannot view, you know, it&rsquo;s all integrated</p>
<p>and you cannot view yourself in isolation.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t place a moral commandment on me,</p>
<p>help everybody who&rsquo;s poor</p>
<p>that you happen to meet in the street.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t place a burden on me in a sense</p>
<p>that now I have this moral duty to help everybody.</p>
<p>It leaves me free to make decisions</p>
<p>about who I help and who I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people who I will not help.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people who I do not wish positive things upon.</p>
<p>Bad people should have bad outcomes.</p>
<p>Bad people should suffer.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And then you have the freedom to choose who&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s bad within your.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your decision based on your values.</p>
<p>Now, I think there&rsquo;s an objectivity to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a standard by which you should evaluate</p>
<p>good versus bad.</p>
<p>And that standard should be to what extent</p>
<p>do they contribute or hurt human life?</p>
<p>The standard is human life.</p>
<p>And so when I say, look at Jeff Bezos,</p>
<p>I say, he&rsquo;s contributed to human life, good guy.</p>
<p>I might disagree with him on stuff.</p>
<p>We might disagree about politics.</p>
<p>We might disagree about women.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what we agree.</p>
<p>But overall, big picture, he is pro life, right?</p>
<p>I look at somebody like, you know, to take like 99.9%</p>
<p>of our politicians and they are pro death.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pro destruction.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pro cutting corners in ways that destroy human life</p>
<p>and human potential and human ability.</p>
<p>So I literally hate almost every politician out there.</p>
<p>And I wish ill on them, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to be successful or happy.</p>
<p>I want them all to go away, right?</p>
<p>Leave me alone.</p>
<p>So I believe in justice.</p>
<p>I believe good things should happen to good people</p>
<p>and bad things should happen to bad people.</p>
<p>So I make those generalizations based on this one,</p>
<p>you know, on the other hand, if, you know,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say all politicians, right?</p>
<p>So if I, you know, I love Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>and George Washington, right?</p>
<p>I love Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>I love people who fought for freedom</p>
<p>and who believed in freedom, who had these ideas</p>
<p>and lived up to, at least in parts of their lives,</p>
<p>to those principles.</p>
<p>Now, do I think Thomas Jefferson was flawed</p>
<p>because he held slaves?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But the virtues way outweigh that in my view.</p>
<p>And I understand people who don&rsquo;t accept that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to also love</p>
<p>and hate the entirety of the person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s parts of that person that you&rsquo;re attracted to.</p>
<p>The major part is pro life and therefore I&rsquo;m pro that person.</p>
<p>And I think, and I said earlier</p>
<p>that objectivism is a philosophy of love.</p>
<p>And I believe that because objectivism is about your life,</p>
<p>about loving your life, about embracing your life,</p>
<p>about engaging with the world,</p>
<p>about loving the world in which you live,</p>
<p>about win win relationships with other people,</p>
<p>which means to a large extent loving the good</p>
<p>in other people and the best in other people</p>
<p>and encouraging that and supporting that</p>
<p>and promoting that.</p>
<p>So I know selfishness is a harsh word</p>
<p>because the culture has given it that harshness.</p>
<p>Selfishness is a harsh word</p>
<p>because the people who don&rsquo;t like selfishness</p>
<p>want you to believe it&rsquo;s a harsh word.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>It means focus on self.</p>
<p>It means take care of self.</p>
<p>It means make yourself your highest priority,</p>
<p>not your only priority,</p>
<p>because in taking care of self,</p>
<p>what would I be without my wife?</p>
<p>What would I be without the people who support me,</p>
<p>who help me, who I have these love relationships with?</p>
<p>So other people are crucial.</p>
<p>What would my life be without Steve Jobs, right?</p>
<p>A lot of things you mentioned here are just beautiful.</p>
<p>So one is win win.</p>
<p>So one key thing about this selfishness</p>
<p>and the idea of objectivism is the philosophy of love</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t want parasitism.</p>
<p>So that is unethical.</p>
<p>So you actually, first of all, you say win win a lot.</p>
<p>And I just like that terminology</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a good way to see life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tried to maximize the number of win win interactions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to see business actually.</p>
<p>Well, life generally, I think every aspect of life,</p>
<p>you wanna have a win win relationship with your wife.</p>
<p>Imagine if it was win lose.</p>
<p>Either way, if you win and she loses,</p>
<p>how long is that gonna sustain?</p>
<p>So win lose relationships are not in equilibrium.</p>
<p>What they turn into is lose lose.</p>
<p>Like win lose turns into lose lose.</p>
<p>And so the only alternative to lose lose is win win.</p>
<p>And you win and the person you love wins.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s better than that, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way to maximize, so like the selfishness</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re trying to maximize the win,</p>
<p>but the way to maximize the win is to maximize the win win.</p>
<p>Yes, and it turns out,</p>
<p>and Adam Smith understood this a long time ago,</p>
<p>that if you focus on your own winning</p>
<p>while respecting other people as human beings,</p>
<p>then everybody wins.</p>
<p>And the beauty of capitalism,</p>
<p>if we go back to capitalism for a second,</p>
<p>the beauty of capitalism is you cannot be successful</p>
<p>in capitalism without producing values</p>
<p>that other people appreciate</p>
<p>and therefore willing to buy from you.</p>
<p>And they buy them, and this goes back to that question</p>
<p>about the engineer and Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Why is the engineer working there?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s getting paid more than his time is worth to him.</p>
<p>I know people don&rsquo;t like to think in those terms,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>If his time is worth more to him than what he&rsquo;s getting paid,</p>
<p>he would leave.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s winning.</p>
<p>And is Apple winning?</p>
<p>Yes, because they&rsquo;re getting more productivity from him.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting more from him</p>
<p>than what he&rsquo;s actually producing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough because there&rsquo;s the human psychology</p>
<p>and imperfect information.</p>
<p>It just makes it a little messier</p>
<p>than the clarity of thinking you have about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, because for sure,</p>
<p>but not everything in life is an economic transaction.</p>
<p>It ultimately is close, but it&hellip;</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s not an economic transaction,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a relationship transaction,</p>
<p>when you get to a point with a friend</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not gaining from the relationship,</p>
<p>friendship&rsquo;s gonna be over.</p>
<p>Not immediately, because it takes time for these things</p>
<p>to manifest itself and to really absorb and to&hellip;</p>
<p>But we change friendships, we change our loves, right?</p>
<p>We fall in and out of love.</p>
<p>We fall out of love because we&rsquo;re not&hellip;</p>
<p>Love, so let&rsquo;s go back to love, right?</p>
<p>Love is the most selfish of all emotions.</p>
<p>Love is about what you do to me, right?</p>
<p>So I love my wife because she makes me feel better</p>
<p>about myself.</p>
<p>So, you know, the idea of selfless love is bizarre.</p>
<p>So Ayn Rand used to say, before you say, I love you,</p>
<p>you have to say the I.</p>
<p>And you have to know who you are</p>
<p>and you have to appreciate yourself.</p>
<p>If you hate yourself,</p>
<p>what does it mean to love somebody else?</p>
<p>So I love my wife because she makes me feel great</p>
<p>about the world.</p>
<p>And she loves me for the same reason.</p>
<p>And so Ayn Rand used to use this example.</p>
<p>Imagine you go up to be spoused the night before the wedding</p>
<p>and you say, you know, I get nothing out of this relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this purely as an act of noble self sacrifice.</p>
<p>She would slap you, as she should, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, we know this intuitively that love is selfish,</p>
<p>but we are afraid to admit it to ourselves.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Because the other side has convinced us</p>
<p>that selfishness is associated with exploiting other people.</p>
<p>Selfishness means lying, cheating, stealing,</p>
<p>walking on corpses, backstabbing people.</p>
<p>But is that ever in your self interest truly, right?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll often be in front of an audience to say,</p>
<p>okay, how many people have you ever been in a relationship</p>
<p>and say, okay, how many people here have lied?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kidding, right?</p>
<p>How many of you think that if you did that consistently,</p>
<p>that would make your life better?</p>
<p>Nobody thinks that, right?</p>
<p>Because everybody&rsquo;s experienced how shitty lying,</p>
<p>not because of how it makes you feel</p>
<p>out of a sense of guilt.</p>
<p>Existentially, it&rsquo;s just a bad strategy, right?</p>
<p>You get caught, you have to create other lies</p>
<p>to cover up the previous lie.</p>
<p>It screws up with your own psychology and your own cognition.</p>
<p>You know, the mind, to some extent, like a computer, right,</p>
<p>is an integrating machine.</p>
<p>And in computer science, I understand</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a term called garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>Lying is garbage in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not good strategy.</p>
<p>Cheating, screwing your customers in a business,</p>
<p>not paying your suppliers as a businessman,</p>
<p>not good business practices,</p>
<p>not good practices for being alive.</p>
<p>So win, win is both model and practical.</p>
<p>And the beauty of Heinemann&rsquo;s philosophy,</p>
<p>and I think this is really important,</p>
<p>is that the model is the practical</p>
<p>and the practical is the model.</p>
<p>And therefore, if you are a model, you will be happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why the application</p>
<p>of the philosophy of objectivism is so easy to practice.</p>
<p>So like, or to discuss, or possible to discuss.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you talk about all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so clear cut.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so vigorous about my view.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fundamentally practical.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the best of philosophies is practical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a sense, teaching you how to live a good life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s teaching you how to live a good life,</p>
<p>not just as you, but as a human being.</p>
<p>And therefore, the principles that apply to you</p>
<p>probably apply to me as well.</p>
<p>And if we both share the same principles</p>
<p>of how to live a good life, we&rsquo;re not gonna be enemies.</p>
<p>You brought up anarchy earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve kind of said politicians.</p>
<p>I mean, part of it is a little bit joking,</p>
<p>but politicians are not good people.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So, but we should have some.</p>
<p>So you have an opposition to anarchism.</p>
<p>So they, first of all, they weren&rsquo;t always not bad people.</p>
<p>That is, I gave examples of people</p>
<p>who engage in political life</p>
<p>who I think were good people basically.</p>
<p>And, but they think they get worse over time</p>
<p>if the system is corrupt.</p>
<p>And I think the system, unfortunately,</p>
<p>even the American system, as good as it was,</p>
<p>was founded on quicksand and have corruption built in.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t quite get it.</p>
<p>And they needed Ayn Rand to get it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not blaming them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they share any blame.</p>
<p>You needed a philosophy in order to completely fulfill</p>
<p>the promise that is America,</p>
<p>or the promise that is the founding of America.</p>
<p>So the place where corruption sneaked in</p>
<p>is the lack in some way of the philosophy</p>
<p>underlying the nation?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s Christianity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, not to hit on another controversial topic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s religion, which undercut their morality.</p>
<p>So the founders were explicitly Christian</p>
<p>and altruistic in their morality.</p>
<p>Implicitly, in terms of their actions,</p>
<p>they were completely secular,</p>
<p>and they were very secular anyway.</p>
<p>But in their morality, even, they were secular.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing in Christianity that says</p>
<p>that you have an inalienable right to pursue happiness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unbelievably self interested</p>
<p>and based on kind of a moral philosophy of ego,</p>
<p>of an egoistic moral philosophy.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t know how to ground it.</p>
<p>They implicitly, they had that fast thinking, that gut.</p>
<p>They told them that this was right.</p>
<p>And the whole enlightenment, that period,</p>
<p>from John Locke on to really to Hume,</p>
<p>that period is about pursuit of happiness,</p>
<p>using reason in pursuit of the good life, right?</p>
<p>But they can&rsquo;t ground it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really understand what reason is,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really understand what happiness requires.</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t detach themselves from Christianity.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not allowed to politically.</p>
<p>And I think conceptually,</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t make that big break.</p>
<p>Rand is an enlightenment thinker in that sense.</p>
<p>She is what should have followed right after, right?</p>
<p>She should have come there and grounded them</p>
<p>in the secular and in the egoistic</p>
<p>and the Aristotelian view of morality</p>
<p>as a code of values to basically to guide your life,</p>
<p>to guide your life towards happiness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Aristotle&rsquo;s view, right?</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>So I think that government is necessary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a necessary evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a necessary good, because it does something good.</p>
<p>And the good that it does</p>
<p>is it eliminates coercion from society.</p>
<p>It eliminates violence from society.</p>
<p>It eliminates the use of force</p>
<p>between individuals from society.</p>
<p>And that&hellip;</p>
<p>But see, the argument like Michael Malice would make,</p>
<p>give me a chance here,</p>
<p>is why can&rsquo;t you apply the same kind of reasoning</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve effectively used for the rest</p>
<p>of mutually agreed upon institutions</p>
<p>that are driven by capitalism,</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t also hire forces</p>
<p>to protect us from the violence,</p>
<p>to ensure the stability of society</p>
<p>that protects us from the violence.</p>
<p>Why draw the line at this particular place, right?</p>
<p>Well, because there is no other place to draw a line,</p>
<p>and there is a line.</p>
<p>And by the way, we draw lines at other places, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t vote.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t determine truth and science based on competition.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s a line.</p>
<p>But first of all, some people might say&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s competition in a sense</p>
<p>that you have alternate theories,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>whether you decide that he&rsquo;s right or he&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>is not based on the market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on facts, on reality, on objective reality.</p>
<p>You have to&hellip;</p>
<p>And some people will never accept that this person is right</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t see the string.</p>
<p>So first of all, what they reject,</p>
<p>what most anarchists reject,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t admit it or recognize it,</p>
<p>is they reject objective reality.</p>
<p>In which sense?</p>
<p>So like, okay, I get it, right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole&hellip;</p>
<p>So the whole realm of law</p>
<p>is a scientific realm</p>
<p>to define, for example, the boundaries of private property.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an issue of competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an issue of,</p>
<p>I have one system and you have another system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an issue of a big competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an issue of objective reality.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s more difficult than science in a sense</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more difficult to prove</p>
<p>that my conception of property is correct</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re correct.</p>
<p>But there is a correct one.</p>
<p>In reality, there&rsquo;s a correct vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more abstract.</p>
<p>But look,</p>
<p>somebody has to decide what property is.</p>
<p>So my property is defined by certain boundaries.</p>
<p>And I have a police force</p>
<p>and I have a judiciary system that backs my vision.</p>
<p>And you have a claim against my property.</p>
<p>You have a claim against my property.</p>
<p>And you have a police force and a judicial system</p>
<p>that backs your claim.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s right?</p>
<p>So our definitions of property are different?</p>
<p>Yes, our definitions of property</p>
<p>or our claim on the property is different.</p>
<p>So what if we just agree on the definition of property and&hellip;</p>
<p>But why should we agree, right?</p>
<p>Your judicial system is one definition of property.</p>
<p>My judicial system is not.</p>
<p>You think that there&rsquo;s no such thing</p>
<p>as intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>And your whole system believes that.</p>
<p>And my whole system believes there is such thing.</p>
<p>So you are duplicating my books</p>
<p>and handing them out to all your friends</p>
<p>and not paying me a royalty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>My judicial system and my police force think that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re both living in the same geographic area, right?</p>
<p>So we have overlapping jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Now, the anarchist would say, well, we&rsquo;ll negotiate.</p>
<p>Why should we negotiate?</p>
<p>My system is actually right.</p>
<p>There is such a thing as intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no negotiation here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And you should either pay a fine or go to jail.</p>
<p>Yeah, but why can&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a community, there&rsquo;s multiple parties</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a majority vote.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll hire different forces that says,</p>
<p>yeah, Yaron is onto something here</p>
<p>with the definition of property and we&rsquo;ll go with that.</p>
<p>So are anarchists pro democracy in the majority rule sense?</p>
<p>Well, I think so.</p>
<p>I think anarchy promotes like emergent democracy, right?</p>
<p>Like the&hellip;</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what it promotes.</p>
<p>It promotes emergent strife and civil war and violence,</p>
<p>constant uninterrupted violence.</p>
<p>Because the only way to settle the dispute between us,</p>
<p>since we both think that we are right</p>
<p>and we have guns behind us to protect that</p>
<p>and we have a legal system,</p>
<p>we have a whole theory of ideas,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re stealing my stuff.</p>
<p>How do I get it back?</p>
<p>I invade you, right?</p>
<p>I take over, and who&rsquo;s gonna win that battle?</p>
<p>The smartest guy?</p>
<p>Oh, the guy with the biggest guns.</p>
<p>See, but the anarchists would say</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re using implied,</p>
<p>like the state uses implied force.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already doing violence.</p>
<p>Because they take the state as it is today</p>
<p>and they refuse to engage in the conversation</p>
<p>about what a state should and could look like</p>
<p>and how we can create mechanisms</p>
<p>to protect us from the state using those.</p>
<p>But look, my view of anarchy is very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ridiculous position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s infantile.</p>
<p>I mean, I really mean this, right?</p>
<p>And sorry to Michael,</p>
<p>but and all the other very, very smart,</p>
<p>very, very smart anarchists.</p>
<p>Because anarchists is never,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t find a dumb anarchist.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because dumb people know it wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>You have to have, it&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>You have to have a certain IQ to be an anarchist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, they&rsquo;re all really intelligent.</p>
<p>All intelligence.</p>
<p>And the reason is that you have to create</p>
<p>such a mythology in your head.</p>
<p>You have to create so many rationalizations.</p>
<p>Any Joe in the street knows it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because they can understand what happens</p>
<p>when two people who are armed are in the street</p>
<p>and have a dispute and there&rsquo;s no mechanism</p>
<p>to resolve that dispute.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s objective.</p>
<p>And this is where it gets subjective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s objective.</p>
<p>The whole point of government is</p>
<p>that it is the objective authority</p>
<p>for determining the truth in one regard,</p>
<p>in regard to force.</p>
<p>Because the only alternative to determining it</p>
<p>when it comes to force is through force.</p>
<p>The only way to resolve disputes is through force</p>
<p>or through this negotiation, which is unjust</p>
<p>because if one party is right and one party is wrong,</p>
<p>why negotiate?</p>
<p>And this is the point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against competition of governance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for competition of governance.</p>
<p>We do that all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called countries.</p>
<p>The United States has a certain governance structure.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union had a governance structure.</p>
<p>Mexico has a governance structure.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re competing.</p>
<p>And we can observe the competition.</p>
<p>And in my world, you could move freely</p>
<p>from one governance to another.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t like your governance,</p>
<p>you would move to a better governance system.</p>
<p>But they have to have autonomy within a geographic area.</p>
<p>Otherwise what you get is complete and utter civil war.</p>
<p>The law needs to be objective.</p>
<p>And there needs to be one law over a piece of ground.</p>
<p>And if you disagree with that law,</p>
<p>you can move somewhere else where they may.</p>
<p>This is why federalism is such a beautiful system.</p>
<p>Even within the United States, we have states.</p>
<p>And on certain issues, we&rsquo;re allowed</p>
<p>to disagree between states, like the death penalty.</p>
<p>Some states do, some states don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>And now I can move from one state if I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s certain issues you cannot have disagreement.</p>
<p>Slavery, for example, this is why we had a civil war.</p>
<p>But let me, one other argument against anarchy.</p>
<p>Markets exist where force has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Sorry, can you say that again?</p>
<p>Markets exist where the rule of force has been eliminated.</p>
<p>The rule of force?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So a market will exist if we know</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t pull a gun on me and just take my stuff.</p>
<p>I am willing to engage in transaction with you</p>
<p>if we have an implicit understanding</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not gonna use force against each other.</p>
<p>So force has something special to it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special, it overrides,</p>
<p>because we are still agreeing we can manipulate each other.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But force we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Force kind of,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s something fundamental about violence.</p>
<p>Force is a fundamental force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the anti reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the anti life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the anti force against another person.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what it does is shuts down the mind.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So in order to have a market,</p>
<p>you have to extract force.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>How can you have a market in force?</p>
<p>When I, there&rsquo;s an Instagram channel called nature&rsquo;s metal</p>
<p>where it has all these videos of animals,</p>
<p>basically having a market of force.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But that shuts down the ability to reason</p>
<p>and animals don&rsquo;t need to because they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So the innovation that is human beings</p>
<p>is our capacity to reason.</p>
<p>And therefore the relegation of force to the animals.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do force.</p>
<p>Civilization is what we don&rsquo;t have force.</p>
<p>And so what you have is you cannot have a market in that,</p>
<p>which a market requires the elimination of it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t debate formally these guys,</p>
<p>but I interact with them all the time, right?</p>
<p>And you get these absurd arguments where,</p>
<p>David Friedman will say, that&rsquo;s Milton Friedman&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>He will say something like, well, in Somalia,</p>
<p>in the Northern part of Somalia</p>
<p>where they have no government,</p>
<p>you have all these wonderful,</p>
<p>you have these tribal tribunals of these tribes</p>
<p>and they resolve disputes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Barbarically, they use Sharia law.</p>
<p>They have no respect for individual rights,</p>
<p>no respect for property.</p>
<p>And the only reason they have any authority</p>
<p>is because they have guns and they have power</p>
<p>and they have force and they do it barbarically.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing civilizing about the courts of Somalian</p>
<p>and they write about pirates because they view force.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t view force as something unique</p>
<p>that must be extracted from human life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why anarchy has to devolve into violence</p>
<p>because it treats forces just,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the big deal with negotiating over guns?</p>
<p>So we covered a lot of high level philosophy,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to touch on the troubles, the chaos of the day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>And I really trying to find a hopeful path way out.</p>
<p>So one is the current coronavirus pandemic,</p>
<p>or in particular, not the virus,</p>
<p>but our handling of it.</p>
<p>Is there something philosophically, politically</p>
<p>that you would like to see,</p>
<p>that you would like to recommend,</p>
<p>that you would like to maybe give a hopeful message</p>
<p>if we take that kind of trajectory</p>
<p>we might be able to get out?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m kind of worried about the economic pain</p>
<p>that people are feeling that there&rsquo;s this quiet suffering.</p>
<p>I mean, I agree with you completely.</p>
<p>There is a quiet suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>I mean, I know people.</p>
<p>I go to a lot of restaurants.</p>
<p>One of the things we love to do is eat out.</p>
<p>My wife doesn&rsquo;t like cooking anymore.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have kids in the house anymore,</p>
<p>so she doesn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>So we go out a lot.</p>
<p>We go to restaurants.</p>
<p>And because we have our favorites and we go to them a lot,</p>
<p>we get to know the owners of the restaurant, the chef.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just heartbreaking.</p>
<p>These people put their life, their blood, sweat, and tears.</p>
<p>I mean, real blood, sweat, and tears into these projects.</p>
<p>Restaurants are super difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Most of them go bankrupt anyway.</p>
<p>And the restaurants, we go to a good restaurant.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve done a good job</p>
<p>and they offer unique value.</p>
<p>And they shut them down.</p>
<p>And many of them will never open.</p>
<p>Something like the estimate 50, 60% of restaurants</p>
<p>in some places won&rsquo;t open.</p>
<p>These are people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>These are people&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p>These are people&rsquo;s effort.</p>
<p>These are people&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Talk about love.</p>
<p>Love what they do.</p>
<p>Particularly if they&rsquo;re the chef as well.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s disappeared.</p>
<p>And what are they gonna do with their lives now?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna live off the government</p>
<p>the way our politicians would like them.</p>
<p>Bigger and bigger stimulus plans</p>
<p>so we can hand checks to people</p>
<p>to get them used to living off of us rather than.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting and it&rsquo;s offensive</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unbelievably sad.</p>
<p>And this is where it comes to this.</p>
<p>I care about other people.</p>
<p>I mean, this idea that objectivists don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I mean, I love these people who provide me with pleasure</p>
<p>of eating wonderful food in a great environment.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something inspiring about them too.</p>
<p>Like when I see a great restaurant owner,</p>
<p>I wanna do better with my own stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re inspiring.</p>
<p>Anybody who does it is excellent.</p>
<p>I love sports because it&rsquo;s the one realm</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;d still value and celebrate excellence.</p>
<p>But I try to celebrate excellence everything in my life.</p>
<p>So I try to be nice to these people.</p>
<p>And with COVID, we went more to restaurants,</p>
<p>we did more takeout stuff.</p>
<p>We made an effort, particularly the restaurants,</p>
<p>we really love to keep them going,</p>
<p>to encourage them, to support them.</p>
<p>The problem is philosophy drives the world.</p>
<p>The response to COVID has been worse than pathetic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s driven by philosophy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s driven by disrespect to science,</p>
<p>ignorance and disrespect of statistics,</p>
<p>a disrespect of individual human decision making.</p>
<p>Government has to decide everything for us.</p>
<p>And just throughout the process and a disrespect of markets</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t let markets work to facilitate</p>
<p>what we needed in order to deal with this virus.</p>
<p>If you look at the place, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that the only place on the planet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s done well with this are parts of Asia, right?</p>
<p>Taiwan did phenomenally with this.</p>
<p>And the vice president of Taiwan is an epidemiologist.</p>
<p>So he knew what he was doing.</p>
<p>And they got it right from the beginning.</p>
<p>South Korea did amazing, even Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is just very few deaths.</p>
<p>And the economy wasn&rsquo;t shut down in any of those places.</p>
<p>There were no lockdowns in any of those places.</p>
<p>The CDC had plans before this happened</p>
<p>on how to deal with good plans.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you ask people around the world before the pandemic</p>
<p>which country is best prepared for a pandemic,</p>
<p>they would have said the United States</p>
<p>because of the CDC&rsquo;s plans</p>
<p>and all of our emergency reserves and all that</p>
<p>and the wealth.</p>
<p>And yet all of that went out the window</p>
<p>because people panicked, people didn&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>go back to reason, people were arrogant,</p>
<p>refused to use the tools that they had at their disposal</p>
<p>to deal with this.</p>
<p>So you deal with pandemics, it&rsquo;s very simple</p>
<p>how you deal with pandemics.</p>
<p>And this is how South Korea and Taiwan and everywhere,</p>
<p>you deal with them by testing, tracing and isolating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And you do it well and you do it vigorously</p>
<p>and you do it on scale if you have to.</p>
<p>And you scale up to do it and we have the wealth to do that.</p>
<p>So one question I have, it&rsquo;s a difficult one.</p>
<p>So I talk about love a lot</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve just talked about Donald Trump,</p>
<p>I guarantee you though this particular segment</p>
<p>will be full of division from the internet.</p>
<p>But I believe that should be and can be fixed.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to in particular is the division</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve talked about the value of reason.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ve noticed on the internet</p>
<p>is the division shuts down reason.</p>
<p>So when people hear you say Trump,</p>
<p>actually the first sentence you said about Trump,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll hear Trump and their ears will perk up</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll immediately start in that first sentence,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say, is he a Trump supporter or a Trump?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not interested in anything else after that.</p>
<p>And then after that, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And what, how do, so my question is,</p>
<p>you as one of the beacons of intellectualism,</p>
<p>quite honestly, I mean, it sounds silly to say,</p>
<p>but you are a beacon of reason.</p>
<p>How do we bring people together long enough</p>
<p>to where we can reason?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no easy way out of this</p>
<p>because the fact that people have become tribal</p>
<p>and they have, very tribal.</p>
<p>And the tribe, in the tribe reason doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about emotion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about belonging or not belonging.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t wanna stand out.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna have a different opinion.</p>
<p>You wanna belong.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all about belonging.</p>
<p>It took us decades to get back to tribalism</p>
<p>where we were hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>It took millennium to get out of tribalism.</p>
<p>It took the enlightenment</p>
<p>to get us to the point of individualism,</p>
<p>where we think in reason, respect for reason.</p>
<p>Before that, we were all tribal.</p>
<p>So it took the enlightenment to get us out of it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been in the enlightenment for about 250 years,</p>
<p>influenced by the enlightenment and it&rsquo;s fading.</p>
<p>The impact is fading.</p>
<p>So what would we need to get out of it?</p>
<p>We need self esteem.</p>
<p>People join a tribe</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t trust their own mind.</p>
<p>People join a tribe</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid to stand on their own two feet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid to think for themselves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid to be different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid to be unique.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid to be an individual.</p>
<p>People need self esteem.</p>
<p>To gain self esteem,</p>
<p>they have to have respect for rationality.</p>
<p>They have to think and they have to achieve</p>
<p>and they have to recognize that achievement.</p>
<p>To do that, they have to have respect for thinking.</p>
<p>They have to have to respect for reason.</p>
<p>And we have to, and think about the schools.</p>
<p>We have to have schools that teach people to think,</p>
<p>teach people to value their mind.</p>
<p>We have schools that teach people to feel</p>
<p>and value their feelings.</p>
<p>We have groups of six year olds sitting around a circle</p>
<p>discussing politics.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re ignorant.</p>
<p>See, you don&rsquo;t know anything when you&rsquo;re ignorant.</p>
<p>Yes, you can feel,</p>
<p>but your feelings are useless as decision making tools.</p>
<p>But we emphasize emotion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about socialization and emotion.</p>
<p>This is why they talk about this generation of snowflakes.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t hear anything that they&rsquo;re opposed to</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve not learned how to use their mind,</p>
<p>how to think.</p>
<p>So it boils down to teaching people how to think two things,</p>
<p>how to think and how to care about themselves.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s thinking of self esteem and the connected,</p>
<p>because when you think, you achieve,</p>
<p>which gains you self esteem.</p>
<p>When you have self esteem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to think for yourself.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how you do that quickly.</p>
<p>I mean, I think leadership matters.</p>
<p>So, you know, part of what I try to do</p>
<p>is try to encourage people to do those things.</p>
<p>But I am a small voice.</p>
<p>You asked me when,</p>
<p>early on you said we should talk about</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m not more famous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not famous.</p>
<p>You know, my following is not big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very small in the scope of things.</p>
<p>Well, yours and objectivism and that question,</p>
<p>could you linger on it for a moment?</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t objectivism more famous?</p>
<p>I think because it&rsquo;s so challenging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not challenging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not challenging to me, right?</p>
<p>When I first encountered objectivism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like after the first shock</p>
<p>and after the first kind of,</p>
<p>none of this can be true.</p>
<p>This is all BS.</p>
<p>And fighting it, once I got it,</p>
<p>it was easy.</p>
<p>It required years of studying,</p>
<p>but it was easy in the sense of,</p>
<p>yes, this makes sense.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s challenging because it upends everything.</p>
<p>It really says what my mother taught me is wrong.</p>
<p>And what my politicians say left and right is wrong.</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a single politician</p>
<p>on which I agree with on almost anything, right?</p>
<p>Because on the fundamentals we disagree.</p>
<p>And what my teachers are telling me is wrong.</p>
<p>And what Jesus said is wrong.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>But the thing is,</p>
<p>so you talk about politics and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but you know, most people don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>The more powerful thing about objectivism</p>
<p>is the practical of my life,</p>
<p>of how I revolutionized my life.</p>
<p>And that feels to be like a very important and appealing,</p>
<p>you know, get your shit together.</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is why Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>is so much more successful than we are, right?</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Make your bed or whatever.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Make your bed.</p>
<p>Yeah, because his personal responsibility is shallow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s make your bed, stand up straight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my mother told me when I was growing up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing new about Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>He says, embrace Christianity.</p>
<p>Christianity is fine, right?</p>
<p>Religion is okay.</p>
<p>Just do these few things and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>And by the way, he says, happiness, you know,</p>
<p>you either have it or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s random.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t bring about your own happiness.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s given people an easy out.</p>
<p>People want easy outs.</p>
<p>People buy self help books</p>
<p>that give them five principles</p>
<p>or living in, you know, shallow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling them, think,</p>
<p>stand on your own two feet, be independent.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to your mother.</p>
<p>Do your own thing, but thoughtfully,</p>
<p>not based on emotions.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re responsible not just</p>
<p>for a set of particular habits and so on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responsible for everything.</p>
<p>Yes, and you&rsquo;re responsible.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the big one, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responsible for shaping your own soul.</p>
<p>Your consciousness,</p>
<p>you get to decide what it&rsquo;s going to be like.</p>
<p>And the only tool you have is your mind.</p>
<p>Your only tool is your mind.</p>
<p>Well, your emotions play a tool</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re properly cultivated.</p>
<p>They play a role in that.</p>
<p>And the tools you have is thinking, experiencing,</p>
<p>living, coming to the right conclusions,</p>
<p>you know, listening to great music</p>
<p>and watching good movies and art is very important</p>
<p>in shaping your own soul and helping you do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a crucial role in that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s lonely work</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s work you do with yourself.</p>
<p>Now, if you find somebody who you love</p>
<p>who shares these values and you can do with them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great, but it&rsquo;s mostly lonely work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s challenging, it ends your world.</p>
<p>The reward is unbelievable.</p>
<p>But even at that, think about the enlightenment, right?</p>
<p>So up until the enlightenment, where was truth?</p>
<p>Truth came from a book.</p>
<p>And there were a few people who understood the book.</p>
<p>Most of us couldn&rsquo;t read and they conveyed it to us.</p>
<p>And they just told us what to do.</p>
<p>And in that sense, life&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>It sucks and we die young and we have nothing</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t enjoy it, but it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>And the enlightenment comes around and says,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got this tool, it&rsquo;s called reason.</p>
<p>And it allows us to discover truth about the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in a book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually your reason allows you</p>
<p>to discover stuff about the world.</p>
<p>And I consider the first,</p>
<p>really the first figure of the enlightenment is Newton,</p>
<p>not Locke, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scientist.</p>
<p>Because he teaches us the laws of mechanics,</p>
<p>like how does stuff work?</p>
<p>And people go, oh, wow, this is cool.</p>
<p>I can use my mind.</p>
<p>I can discover truth.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that amazing?</p>
<p>And everything opens up once you do that.</p>
<p>Hey, if I can discover,</p>
<p>if I understand the laws of motion,</p>
<p>if I can understand truth in the world,</p>
<p>how come I can&rsquo;t decide who I marry?</p>
<p>I mean, everything was fixed in those days.</p>
<p>How come I can&rsquo;t decide what profession I should be in?</p>
<p>Right, everybody would belong to a guild.</p>
<p>How come I can&rsquo;t decide who my political leader should be?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s all reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, once you understand the efficacy of your own mind</p>
<p>to understand truth, to understand reality,</p>
<p>discover truth, not understand truth, discover it.</p>
<p>Everything opens up.</p>
<p>Now you can take responsibility for your own life</p>
<p>because now you have the tool to do it.</p>
<p>But we are living in an era where postmodernism tells us</p>
<p>there is no truth, there is no reality,</p>
<p>and our mind is useless anyway.</p>
<p>Critical race theory tells us</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re determined by your race</p>
<p>and your race shapes everything</p>
<p>and your free will is meaningless</p>
<p>and your reason doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>because reason is just shaped by your genes</p>
<p>and shaped by the color of your skin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most racist theory of all.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got our friend at UC Irvine telling them,</p>
<p>oh, your senses don&rsquo;t tell you anything about reality.</p>
<p>Anyway, reality is what it is.</p>
<p>So, you know, what&rsquo;s the purpose of reason?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to invent stuff, it&rsquo;s to make stuff up.</p>
<p>And then what use is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complete fantasy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve basically got every philosophical,</p>
<p>intellectual voice in the culture</p>
<p>telling them their reason is impotent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a Steven Pinker who tries,</p>
<p>and I love Pinker and he&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>and I love his books,</p>
<p>but, you know, he needs to be stronger about this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few people on kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few people partially in the intellectual dark web</p>
<p>and otherwise who are big on reason</p>
<p>but not consistent enough and not full understanding</p>
<p>of what it means or what it implies.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s little old me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little old me and it&rsquo;s me against the world</p>
<p>in a sense, because I&rsquo;m not only willing to accept,</p>
<p>to articulate the case for reason,</p>
<p>but then what that implies.</p>
<p>It implies freedom, it implies capitalism,</p>
<p>it implies taking personal responsibility over your own life.</p>
<p>And there are other intellectual dark web people</p>
<p>get to reason and then, oh, politics, you can be whatever.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t be a socialist and for reason.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually, those are incompatible.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t be a determinist and for reason.</p>
<p>Reason and determinism don&rsquo;t go together.</p>
<p>The whole point of reason is that it&rsquo;s an achievement</p>
<p>and it requires effort and it requires engagement,</p>
<p>it requires choice.</p>
<p>So it is, it does feel like a little old me</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>The allies I have are allies.</p>
<p>I have allies among some libertarians over economics.</p>
<p>I have some allies in the intellectual dark web</p>
<p>maybe over reason,</p>
<p>but none of them are allies in the full sense.</p>
<p>So my allies are the other objectivists,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not a lot of us.</p>
<p>For people listening to this,</p>
<p>for the few folks kind of listening to this</p>
<p>and thinking about the trajectory of their own life,</p>
<p>I guess the takeaway is reason is a difficult project,</p>
<p>but a project that&rsquo;s worthy of taking on.</p>
<p>Yeah, difficulties, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if difficulty is the right word</p>
<p>because difficult sounds like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I have to push this boulder up a hill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not difficult in that sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult in the sense that it requires energy</p>
<p>and focus, it requires effort,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s immediately rewarding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to do.</p>
<p>And it rewards immediate, pretty quick, right?</p>
<p>It takes a while to undo all the garbage that you have,</p>
<p>but we all have that I had that took me years</p>
<p>and years and years to get rid of certain concepts</p>
<p>and certain emotions that I had that didn&rsquo;t make any sense,</p>
<p>but it takes a long time to fully integrate that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want it to sound like it&rsquo;s a burden,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s hard in that sense.</p>
<p>It does require focus and energy.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want it to sound like a Dr. Spock.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say, and I don&rsquo;t think I do</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a pretty passionate guy,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want it to appeal like,</p>
<p>oh, just forget about emotions.</p>
<p>Emotions are how you experience the world.</p>
<p>You want to have strong emotions.</p>
<p>You want to live, you want to experience life strongly</p>
<p>and passionately.</p>
<p>You just need to know that emotions are not cognition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another realm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t mix the realms.</p>
<p>Think about outcomes and then experience them.</p>
<p>And sometimes your emotions won&rsquo;t coincide</p>
<p>with what you think should be.</p>
<p>And that means there&rsquo;s still more integration to be done.</p>
<p>Yaron, as I told you offline,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of yours for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been, I was a little starstruck early on,</p>
<p>getting a little more comfortable now.</p>
<p>I believe that&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that people</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t heard your work,</p>
<p>listen to it through the Yaron Brook Show.</p>
<p>The times I&rsquo;ve disagreed with something I&rsquo;ve heard you say</p>
<p>is usually a first step on a journey</p>
<p>of learning a lot more about that thing,</p>
<p>about that viewpoint.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been so fulfilling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a gift.</p>
<p>The passion, you talk about reason a lot,</p>
<p>but the passion radiates in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just contagious and uninspiring.</p>
<p>So thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve done for this world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly an honor and a pleasure to talk to you.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>And my reward is that if I&rsquo;ve had an impact</p>
<p>on you and people like you, wow.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>When you wrote to me an email saying you&rsquo;ve been a fan,</p>
<p>I was blown away because I had no idea</p>
<p>and completely unexpected.</p>
<p>And every few months I discover,</p>
<p>hey, I had an impact on this world</p>
<p>and people that I would have never thought.</p>
<p>So the only way to change the world</p>
<p>is to change your one mind at a time.</p>
<p>And when you have an impact on a good mind</p>
<p>and a mind that cares about the world</p>
<p>and a mind that goes out and does something about it,</p>
<p>then you get the exponential growth.</p>
<p>So through you, I&rsquo;ve impacted other people</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how you ultimately change everything.</p>
<p>And so in spite of everything,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic in a sense that I think</p>
<p>that the progress we&rsquo;ve made today</p>
<p>is so universally accepted,</p>
<p>the scientific progress, the technological progress,</p>
<p>it can just vanish like it did when Rome collapsed.</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s in the United States or somewhere,</p>
<p>progress will continue, the human project</p>
<p>for human progress will continue.</p>
<p>And I think these ideas,</p>
<p>the ideas of reason and individualism</p>
<p>will always be at the heart of it.</p>
<p>And what we are doing is continuing</p>
<p>the project of the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the project that will save the human race</p>
<p>and allow it to, for Elon Musk</p>
<p>and for Jeff Bezos to reach the stars.</p>
<p>Thank you for masterfully ending on a hopeful note.</p>
<p>Yaron, a pleasure and an honor.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark</p>
<p>in the hopeless swamps of the not quite,</p>
<p>the not yet, and the not at all.</p>
<p>Do not let the hero in your soul perish</p>
<p>in lonely frustration for the life you deserved</p>
<p>and have never been able to reach.</p>
<p>The world you desire can be one.</p>
<p>It exists, it is real, it is possible, it is yours.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
