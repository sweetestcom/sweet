    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Our card this week is Nicole Silvers, the Five of Diamonds from Colorado.</p>
<p>Nicole, who her friends all called Nikki, was a happy, free-spirited teenager juggling</p>
<p>a part-time job, high school classes, and a busy social life, when one day in the spring</p>
<p>of 2014, she vanished.</p>
<p>We sent our reporting team to her hometown in Colorado to speak with investigators currently</p>
<p>working her case, about why her story is so unique, and why the circumstances surrounding</p>
<p>her disappearance remain so baffling.</p>
<p>What we walked away with was a revelation law enforcement had previously not known about,</p>
<p>a dark secret one of Nikki&rsquo;s family members had been keeping for years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>Around 6.30 in the morning on April 10th, 2014, 16-year-old Dana Stouffer was just waking</p>
<p>up to get ready for school.</p>
<p>As she made her way down the hall and to the kitchen, Dana noticed something that made</p>
<p>her pause.</p>
<p>The bedroom door to her friend Nikki&rsquo;s room was wide open, like not just a little bit</p>
<p>cracked, completely open, which was weird considering Nikki normally kept her door closed.</p>
<p>When Dana looked through the open door, she noticed that her friend wasn&rsquo;t in her bed.</p>
<p>Even more strange was the fact that Nikki&rsquo;s bed was made.</p>
<p>Normally she never made her bed.</p>
<p>Not seeing Nikki in her room or anywhere in the house caused Dana to ask a lot of questions</p>
<p>in her mind.</p>
<p>Where was she?</p>
<p>Had she left for school early?</p>
<p>And if it was the latter, that was definitely odd because rarely was Nikki ever up before</p>
<p>Dana, let alone gone from the house.</p>
<p>Elk County, Colorado cold case detective Byron Castellan said each minute that ticked by,</p>
<p>Dana couldn&rsquo;t come up with a reason as to why Nikki was not where she should have been.</p>
<p>But before she did anything drastic, she poked around her friend&rsquo;s room and that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>she noticed something else.</p>
<p>All her clothes are gone, her guitar is gone, her shampoos and conditioners that I guess</p>
<p>were really high-end that she really meant a lot to her, like all of her stuff was gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mysterious.</p>
<p>As Dana looked around the room, she not only took note of what was missing, she also noticed</p>
<p>big items Nikki had left behind, her guitar case, and the one thing no teenager would</p>
<p>ever be caught without.</p>
<p>It is weird that the guitar was gone, but not the case.</p>
<p>And her cell phone charger was still there.</p>
<p>Her guitar was important to her.</p>
<p>She took the guitar, you&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;d put it in the case to keep it safe.</p>
<p>And if she was going to grab up all her possessions, it&rsquo;s strange that she would forget her phone</p>
<p>charger.</p>
<p>Now, Nikki and Dana weren&rsquo;t related, but they did live together.</p>
<p>The girls were both only 16 and went to the same high school.</p>
<p>Both of them lived with Dana&rsquo;s mom, Allison, in Allison&rsquo;s small one-story ranch house in</p>
<p>Longmont, Colorado, a small city about an hour north of Denver.</p>
<p>Nikki had parents and siblings of her own in the town of Firestone, about 25 minutes</p>
<p>east of Longmont.</p>
<p>But at the time, she wasn&rsquo;t getting along with her family, so she&rsquo;d gotten permission</p>
<p>to temporarily live with Dana and Allison.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re having problems, you know, teenage.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t seem like a super delinquent problem child, but just not getting along with mom</p>
<p>and dad.</p>
<p>Nothing like real big, just kind of a underlying not getting along a lot with dad, I think.</p>
<p>I know she, friends said that she had some complaints about her dad being overly strict.</p>
<p>Apparently, everyone involved with this situation was okay with the arrangement.</p>
<p>It kind of seemed like Nikki was following in the footsteps of her older sister, Jessica,</p>
<p>who had also grown estranged from the Silvers family.</p>
<p>Nikki wasn&rsquo;t paying rent at Allison&rsquo;s house while she stayed there.</p>
<p>Allison was just doing her daughter&rsquo;s friend a favor until Nikki could work out a living</p>
<p>arrangement with her mom and dad or find permanent housing elsewhere.</p>
<p>Nikki&rsquo;s parents figured their teenage daughter would move back home after she realized what</p>
<p>a lot of teens learn the hard way, that working and going to school full time without any</p>
<p>parental support is really hard and it adds up fast.</p>
<p>Nikki had been living with Dana and her mom for just a few weeks, and during that time,</p>
<p>at no point had Nikki talked about moving back in with her parents.</p>
<p>So her and a lot of her prized possessions being gone all of a sudden was weird.</p>
<p>Dana figured that if Nikki had decided to go home to her family, she would have at least</p>
<p>given her a heads up.</p>
<p>Plus, she hadn&rsquo;t even heard Nikki leave the night before.</p>
<p>Dana tried to think about the last time she&rsquo;d seen her friend, and she realized that she</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t seen her at all the day before.</p>
<p>Nikki kept a busy schedule between being a high school student and working as a cook</p>
<p>at a pizza place in Meade, Colorado, which was just a town over, so it wasn&rsquo;t completely</p>
<p>unusual for Dana and Nikki to go a day or so without seeing one another.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of looking around Nikki&rsquo;s room, Dana went to ask her mom Allison if</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d seen Nikki at all on Wednesday, April 9th, but Allison said no, she hadn&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>Nikki in at least two days.</p>
<p>They both agreed that neither of them had talked to Nikki about any plans for her to</p>
<p>move out, and how neither noticed any sounds of someone leaving during the night before.</p>
<p>So the whole thing felt weird, but Dana and Allison decided not to panic.</p>
<p>They figured that Nikki had just picked up some extra shifts at work and would maybe</p>
<p>fill them in on her plans later.</p>
<p>Allison briefly worried that maybe Nikki felt she&rsquo;d overstayed her welcome, which wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the case.</p>
<p>But Friday rolled around, and Nikki was a no-show at school and her job, which was especially</p>
<p>weird because that particular Friday, April 11th, was payday.</p>
<p>Here is Detective Castellan again.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the 11th when people started to think, well, this is odd, especially when</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t show up for work.</p>
<p>She was always good about showing up for work.</p>
<p>So the 11th, she doesn&rsquo;t show up for work.</p>
<p>Work calls and speaks with Dana or Allison, and that gets the ball rolling for talking</p>
<p>to family.</p>
<p>Mom and dad.</p>
<p>Mom and dad hadn&rsquo;t seen her.</p>
<p>And then by the 12th, they&rsquo;re like, okay, now it&rsquo;s been a couple of days, hasn&rsquo;t gone</p>
<p>to work.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not at the place where she was staying in Longmont.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not at mom and dad&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So we should get law enforcement involved.</p>
<p>Because she was 16, and I believe she had some previous runaway reports, it was treated</p>
<p>as a runaway.</p>
<p>Like Castellan said, after everyone talked to each other, on Saturday, April 12th, Nikki&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mom, Barbara, and sister, Sarah, called the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to report that</p>
<p>Nikki ran away again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear exactly how many times Nikki had taken off from her parents&rsquo; house before</p>
<p>leading up to her moving in with Dana and Allison.</p>
<p>But in every one of those instances, Nikki had always shown back up in a day or two after</p>
<p>cooling off, usually at a friend&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>When the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office got Barbara and Sarah&rsquo;s call reporting Nikki</p>
<p>as a runaway, they sent a deputy to the family&rsquo;s house to ask some follow-up questions.</p>
<p>At the time, no one in Nikki&rsquo;s family felt that she was in immediate danger.</p>
<p>So there wasn&rsquo;t a sense of urgency quite yet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d been down this road before, and they just wanted to make sure that they did</p>
<p>everything they could to keep tabs on Nikki in the event that she turned up or got into</p>
<p>any trouble.</p>
<p>There was no suspicion that any foul play had occurred.</p>
<p>It seemed like they thought that she was a runaway and just a private friend just wanted</p>
<p>her a report made so she could be entered in the system if she&rsquo;s contacted, that they</p>
<p>would know where she is and that she&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>Deputies filed a runaway report, which meant that if law enforcement in neighboring towns</p>
<p>or counties found Nikki or picked her up for something, Weld County would get notified</p>
<p>and deputies would be able to at least tell Nikki&rsquo;s family that she was alive and just</p>
<p>choosing not to come home.</p>
<p>So things briefly went back to business as usual by the end of the day on Saturday.</p>
<p>But by Sunday night, when Nikki still hadn&rsquo;t shown up anywhere, her friends, coworkers</p>
<p>and family were like, OK, something is definitely wrong.</p>
<p>After a few more days, as time goes on, it just gets more unusual, because as I said</p>
<p>before, when she&rsquo;s run away, it&rsquo;s not been very long.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s back now that she hasn&rsquo;t gone to work.</p>
<p>Family learns that all her possessions were gone out of the bedroom at Dana&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>So now they&rsquo;re like, oh, maybe she moved away.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s strange that she had a paycheck.</p>
<p>Friday was payday.</p>
<p>So if she was going to move to California, you&rsquo;d think she would have stuck around till</p>
<p>Friday and get her last paycheck.</p>
<p>Another cause for alarm was the fact that between Tuesday, April 8th and Friday, April</p>
<p>11th, friends and family had been trying to text and call Nikki&rsquo;s cell, but it kept going</p>
<p>straight to voicemail.</p>
<p>When their calls were still going straight to voicemail on Sunday night, Dana Allison</p>
<p>and the Silvers family started to really worry.</p>
<p>Her parents reached back out to the sheriff&rsquo;s office, and that&rsquo;s when the case went from</p>
<p>being a teen runaway report to an actual missing persons investigation.</p>
<p>That meant detectives started asking questions, the biggest one being, when was the last time</p>
<p>anyone saw Nikki?</p>
<p>The first two people authorities turned to for answers were Dana and Allison, and what</p>
<p>they told investigators shifted the focus of the investigation in a whole new direction.</p>
<p>When police sat down and interviewed Dana, she told them that the last time she saw Nikki</p>
<p>was around midnight on Tuesday, April 8th, the day before she disappeared.</p>
<p>Dana told police that Nikki was sitting in someone&rsquo;s car in their driveway.</p>
<p>Dana&rsquo;s mom, Allison, told the authorities the same thing, only she had woken up around</p>
<p>2 a.m. to get a glass of water and happened to just glance out front and saw Nikki sitting</p>
<p>in someone&rsquo;s passenger seat.</p>
<p>Allison described the car as an older, boxy-looking Oldsmobile.</p>
<p>Neither of them knew whose car it was, and they hadn&rsquo;t been able to see who&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>This information forced investigators to consider a different scenario.</p>
<p>Maybe Nikki didn&rsquo;t just run away.</p>
<p>Maybe she had been taken by someone that she thought she could trust.</p>
<p>As detectives questioned more and more people in Nikki&rsquo;s close circle of friends, including</p>
<p>her parents, Barbara and Kevin, they learned more valuable information.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, April 8th, the last day anyone saw her, Nikki went to work at Pizza Plus</p>
<p>in Mead.</p>
<p>At the time, Nikki&rsquo;s car had broken down, so she&rsquo;d been bumming rides from people</p>
<p>to get to and from school and work.</p>
<p>Her friends weren&rsquo;t sure where Nikki&rsquo;s broken-down car was.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have the money to fix it at the time, and she managed to get around without</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Sometimes she would get rides from friends, but a lot of times she resorted to hitchhiking,</p>
<p>ignoring warnings from friends and family about the dangers of a teenage girl getting</p>
<p>into cars with strangers.</p>
<p>Police learned from one of Nikki&rsquo;s co-workers named Jesse that he&rsquo;d driven her home to</p>
<p>Allison and Dana&rsquo;s house after work on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t his car that was spotted again at midnight and 2 a.m.</p>
<p>Allison and Dana said that after their last sighting of Nikki, they never heard her come</p>
<p>inside.</p>
<p>But to be fair, they would have been asleep.</p>
<p>The next day, Wednesday, April 9th, Dana and Allison said that they had not seen Nikki</p>
<p>at all, but they didn&rsquo;t think anything of it at the time.</p>
<p>The only person who was supposed to see Nikki on the 9th was her cousin Michelle.</p>
<p>Michelle told investigators that she had made lunch plans with Nikki that day and that Nikki</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t show up.</p>
<p>Michelle said she texted Nikki around noon asking her if she needed a ride, but Nikki</p>
<p>never responded.</p>
<p>At the time, Michelle just brushed it off as her cousin flaking.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the next morning on the 10th that Dana noticed Nikki&rsquo;s room was cleared</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>After conducting these interviews with Dana, Allison, and Michelle, police were starting</p>
<p>to get an idea of Nikki&rsquo;s last movements and what the teen&rsquo;s life was like.</p>
<p>Most importantly, her habits and her general lifestyle while living outside of her parents'</p>
<p>house.</p>
<p>Friends said that she smoked marijuana every once in a while, but she wasn&rsquo;t really getting</p>
<p>in trouble.</p>
<p>Too much, she wasn&rsquo;t really a big drinker.</p>
<p>You know, all her friends said that she was pretty bright, free spirit, used to describe</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>Musician, she played the guitar, so she liked music.</p>
<p>She was a loyal friend, she made friends fairly easy, she had close friends.</p>
<p>To detectives, Nikki sounded like a normal teenage girl.</p>
<p>And part of a lot of teenage girls&rsquo; lives is some kind of relationship or boyfriend.</p>
<p>Police wanted to know if Nikki had a boyfriend that they could interview.</p>
<p>Nikki&rsquo;s mom, Barbara, told detectives that her daughter had had a relationship with a</p>
<p>guy a few years older than her named Patrick.</p>
<p>She had a boyfriend at the time who had, they were kind of on a break because he was,</p>
<p>had moved to Mississippi, where he was from, and so he was there, but that they, that happened</p>
<p>like February.</p>
<p>He went out there in February.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing that she had talked about was going to Mississippi.</p>
<p>A lot of people speculated, oh, maybe she, you know, packed up and was going to hitchhike</p>
<p>to Mississippi or something.</p>
<p>Detectives wasted no time in contacting Nikki&rsquo;s maybe ex-boyfriend, Patrick, in Mississippi.</p>
<p>They connected with him over the phone, and he was shocked to learn that Nikki was even</p>
<p>missing.</p>
<p>He confirmed that he was hundreds of miles away from Colorado and had been for a few</p>
<p>months.</p>
<p>Police asked him if Nikki was there with him, and he said no.</p>
<p>They also asked him if Nikki had mentioned coming to see him, and he said not recently.</p>
<p>Patrick told investigators that he&rsquo;d moved to Mississippi in early 2014 because his grandpa</p>
<p>got sick.</p>
<p>He said Nikki had broken up with him after his move because she didn&rsquo;t want to do long</p>
<p>distance.</p>
<p>Patrick was 18, so not much older than Nikki, but he&rsquo;d already graduated high school.</p>
<p>Patrick said that he and Nikki had texted briefly during the first few days of April</p>
<p>and that everything seemed fine with her, but they hadn&rsquo;t spoken after April 8th.</p>
<p>He told detectives that he&rsquo;d let them and her family know if she contacted him again,</p>
<p>and in fact, he was so concerned for her that he dropped everything he was doing in Mississippi</p>
<p>and went back to Colorado to help Nikki&rsquo;s family search for her.</p>
<p>As detectives were continuing their investigation, Nikki&rsquo;s family members started to hit the</p>
<p>streets with flyers trying to spread the word about her disappearance.</p>
<p>Nikki&rsquo;s mom Barbara also spent time trying to think of anything that might help police,</p>
<p>anyone they could talk to, anywhere Nikki might have gone.</p>
<p>One other place popped up in her mind.</p>
<p>She mentioned to authorities that Nikki had a friend named Chandra who lived in Colorado</p>
<p>Springs, which is like two hours south of Longmont.</p>
<p>According to Barbara, before Nikki had left home to live with Dana and Allison, she tossed</p>
<p>around the idea of moving there.</p>
<p>So maybe Nikki had hitched a ride down there without letting anyone know?</p>
<p>But according to Detective Castellan, that lead never went anywhere.</p>
<p>She had talked with the friend in Colorado Springs and seemed to be considering moving</p>
<p>down there, but nothing really was set in stone.</p>
<p>Nikki had never told her any plans of running away or going anywhere.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have any information on anybody that had it out for her, that wanted to harm</p>
<p>her or anything like that.</p>
<p>Like all the friends, they&rsquo;re like, this is a crazy mystery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no idea what could have happened to her because she never talked about anything</p>
<p>that would give any clue as to why she would disappear.</p>
<p>And she seemed happy and content.</p>
<p>Within the first week of the investigation, right around when police learned Nikki&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cousin Michelle had texted her on April 9th and didn&rsquo;t get a response, they got a search</p>
<p>warrant for her phone records.</p>
<p>Investigators were hoping Nikki&rsquo;s phone calls or text logs might clue them in on her</p>
<p>last location or conversations.</p>
<p>The records confirmed that the text from Michelle asking where Nikki was had been received</p>
<p>by Nikki&rsquo;s phone on April 9th at 1227 p.m.</p>
<p>That message was the last text Nikki received before her phone either died or was turned</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>The rest of the records were unhelpful.</p>
<p>Turned out to be turned off.</p>
<p>So wherever that phone ended up, it was turned off fairly quickly.</p>
<p>No calls were, they got phone records, so no calls were made from it or anything to</p>
<p>it or from it shortly after that, like April 9th.</p>
<p>So that didn&rsquo;t produce any leads.</p>
<p>The contents of all the other text messages authorities could see Nikki&rsquo;s phone had</p>
<p>received or sent prior to April 9th seemed normal.</p>
<p>None of the messages indicated that she was making plans to leave her life in Longmont.</p>
<p>Police also checked Nikki&rsquo;s bank statements to see if there had been any activity in her</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p>Even though she was just 16, Nikki had her own account.</p>
<p>But Detective Castellan said that when police looked, they found that there was only a few</p>
<p>hundred dollars in it and no one had taken anything out of the account recently either.</p>
<p>So if Nikki had decided to just abandon her life and start fresh on her own, she had very</p>
<p>little cash to survive.</p>
<p>And again, what cash she had, she didn&rsquo;t even take.</p>
<p>And those financial records were important because remember, Nikki had that paycheck</p>
<p>waiting for her at Pizza Plus.</p>
<p>It was for $265.</p>
<p>So if police weren&rsquo;t already convinced that she had not just run away, this information</p>
<p>made them pretty sure that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>They were slowly leaning more and more toward the theory that she had been abducted.</p>
<p>But there were also issues with that line of thinking.</p>
<p>Most notably, the tidy bedroom she&rsquo;d left behind at Allison&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to abduct somebody, you&rsquo;re not going to typically break into their house</p>
<p>and have them pack their stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mystery that I can&rsquo;t unravel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange that if somebody forced her to leave, that&rsquo;s just very, I don&rsquo;t know, you</p>
<p>know, with two people sleeping in the house to go in and say, pack up all your stuff or</p>
<p>abduct her and then go in and take her stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s strange.</p>
<p>Even though police couldn&rsquo;t reconcile everything they&rsquo;d learned about Nikki&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>with the evidence in front of them, the sheriff&rsquo;s office decided to put out a press release</p>
<p>anyway.</p>
<p>They sent out a missing persons poster for Nikki to local media outlets and asked anyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d seen her to please call them.</p>
<p>The poster depicted what Nikki looked like at the time that she went missing with her</p>
<p>hair cut short and dyed bright red, though naturally she had light brown hair, rosy cheeks</p>
<p>and blue eyes.</p>
<p>The news of her case and her picture hit Colorado media publications pretty quickly after the</p>
<p>poster&rsquo;s release.</p>
<p>By April 20th, 11 days after anyone had last heard from her, tips started to come in from</p>
<p>across the state.</p>
<p>One man in Boulder told Weld County detectives that he&rsquo;d seen Nikki hanging out with some</p>
<p>people in a homeless camp a week after she&rsquo;d been reported missing.</p>
<p>Another woman in the nearby town of Johnstown called in to report a sighting of Nikki at</p>
<p>a fast food drive-thru.</p>
<p>One report said that Nikki had been spotted at a liquor store in Longmont.</p>
<p>Another said she&rsquo;d been walking toward a park in town.</p>
<p>These leads were pursued, either by sending detectives to investigate them or by reviewing</p>
<p>surveillance videos, but they all amounted to dead ends.</p>
<p>In the meantime, police turned to her school to learn more about her, and counselors at</p>
<p>Mead High School where Nikki was a sophomore said that she maintained decent grades and</p>
<p>excelled in her classes.</p>
<p>The only nugget of interesting information that police got from interviewing some of</p>
<p>her teachers was that one of them said they&rsquo;d signed Nikki up for a program where she could</p>
<p>get some clothing donations and things like that.</p>
<p>The teacher told investigators they&rsquo;d made the effort for Nikki to receive that charity</p>
<p>because they felt like she could have used it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know a ton about Nikki&rsquo;s home life before she went to live with Dana, but</p>
<p>Detective Castellon said the Silvers&rsquo; family was middle class and able to provide for their</p>
<p>kids, so it&rsquo;s interesting that a teacher would view Nikki as needing charity.</p>
<p>There were no reports of abuse or domestic violence at home, just a little bit of information</p>
<p>about Nikki not getting along with her parents to the point that she decided to move out.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there was no indication that things were extremely rough with Nikki&rsquo;s</p>
<p>upbringing or that the Silvers did not have the means to provide for her.</p>
<p>Detective Castellon said in the first few days of the investigation, Nikki&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>seemed quote, appropriately concerned about their missing daughter.</p>
<p>There were no signs that Barbara and Kevin Silvers didn&rsquo;t care about Nikki.</p>
<p>There were definitely signs that their relationship with her was strained, but something that</p>
<p>I find interesting is that even though police knew Nikki didn&rsquo;t get along with her dad</p>
<p>Kevin, detectives in 2014 never actually brought him in for a formal sit-down interview.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have any idea of where she might have gone.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t really talk about the issues that he had with her that was learned from friends.</p>
<p>I mean, she didn&rsquo;t get along with mom or dad, but more so with dad.</p>
<p>I wish I knew more about Nikki&rsquo;s relationship with her parents and why it was so bad that</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t want to live under their roof, but Detective Castellon said it seemed more</p>
<p>like just normal teenage stuff.</p>
<p>Her just not wanting to follow their rules, especially, you know, she had a lot of, according</p>
<p>to friends, she had a lot of complaints about dad just always being around and making her</p>
<p>do chores and stuff that she didn&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>This passed without any other sightings of Nikki and 2014 turned into 2015.</p>
<p>The one-year anniversary of her disappearance came and went and little changed in the case.</p>
<p>During that time, there was no activity noted in her bank account or on her cell or social</p>
<p>media.</p>
<p>The only tips that were still coming in were repeats that had already been investigated.</p>
<p>Then, in September 2016, a different law enforcement agency, the Longmont Police Department, came</p>
<p>across Nikki&rsquo;s broken-down car, just a few miles away from where she was last seen.</p>
<p>On September 7th, 2016, a Longmont police officer was on patrol when he noticed a car</p>
<p>that had been abandoned at 19th Avenue and Logan Street in the city of Longmont.</p>
<p>According to the Longmont Police Department, it was near a house that was known for drug</p>
<p>sales.</p>
<p>Because of the location, the officer had been keeping an eye on the car for a few days.</p>
<p>When the car didn&rsquo;t move after a few days, the officer was just like, okay, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enough.</p>
<p>And he went up to the front door and asked the tenants about it.</p>
<p>The people living at the house said that the car had been broken down for a long time and</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t even sure whose it was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when police ran the plates and saw that it belonged to Nicole Silvers.</p>
<p>In the officer&rsquo;s report, he wrote, quote, a missing person is associated with the plate,</p>
<p>end quote.</p>
<p>But for whatever reason, the Longmont Police Department did not notify the Weld County</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, which was the investigating agency in charge of Nikki&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>The car just sat in the impound lot at the city police department until an entire year</p>
<p>later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when in September 2017, a detective at the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office randomly</p>
<p>did a database search for the car and saw that it had been recovered a year before.</p>
<p>According to the towing company&rsquo;s records, there was nothing of evidentiary value found</p>
<p>inside the car.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure detectives with Weld County would have liked to make that determination</p>
<p>for themselves when it was found rather than a year later.</p>
<p>Now ultimately, after this year, they too weren&rsquo;t able to get anything valuable from</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But again, is that because there was nothing to begin with or that evidence was lost or</p>
<p>destroyed over time?</p>
<p>It was a question that just frustrated the investigators.</p>
<p>And ultimately, the car didn&rsquo;t provide any clues as to where she was.</p>
<p>Weld County authorities questioned the men who lived at the house where the car had been</p>
<p>left.</p>
<p>But when they showed them a photo of Nikki, none of them recognized her or thought she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>ever been there.</p>
<p>The case went cold after that, with another year passing and no new leads.</p>
<p>Then in 2018, two different people happened to suggest the same theory that gave detectives</p>
<p>a whole new angle to investigate.</p>
<p>Maybe Nikki was still alive, but had just run off to join a communal living society</p>
<p>or be part of a commune.</p>
<p>The first person to suggest this was someone Nikki used to work with.</p>
<p>Somebody had mentioned that since Nikki was such a free spirit and liked music and was</p>
<p>kind of a hippie chick, that maybe she would have gone off and joined this group called</p>
<p>the Rainbow People.</p>
<p>Not long after that loose lead came in, another relative of Nikki suggested the same thing</p>
<p>to police, and even sent a photo that she saw online of the backside of a woman who&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been photographed at a Rainbow People gathering.</p>
<p>They thought it could be Nikki.</p>
<p>The woman in the photo has blondish dreadlocks that are gathered in the back, and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wearing a black tank top with a sweater tied around her waist.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got gloves on and is holding some sort of metal bucket.</p>
<p>The reason Nikki&rsquo;s relatives thought that the girl in the photo was Nikki was because</p>
<p>of one of Nikki&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>It had a slight deformity.</p>
<p>According to investigators, it isn&rsquo;t super noticeable, but one earlobe is slightly smaller</p>
<p>than the other.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan sent us the photo, but he prefaced it by saying he has no way of</p>
<p>confirming the woman in the photo is Nikki.</p>
<p>You can see that photo on our website and on our Instagram, but honestly, if you zoom</p>
<p>in on the photo, it&rsquo;s too blurry to even really see this kind of detail.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan said even after looking into it, the woman could be anyone.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Rainbow People, also known as the Rainbow Family, are a group of people</p>
<p>who meet for summer gatherings on Forest Service land throughout the U.S. for annual campouts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a cult because the family doesn&rsquo;t have a leader or anyone that they worship,</p>
<p>and they aren&rsquo;t associated with politics or any specific religion.</p>
<p>According to their unofficial website, they celebrate peace and love, and they gather</p>
<p>to pray for more of that in the world.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan confirmed for our team that the Rainbow People were in northern Colorado</p>
<p>in the spring of 2014.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any organization to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just a group of people, and I searched regional news stories for anything around</p>
<p>that time, and there had been a stabbing up by red feathers where the Rainbow People</p>
<p>were having their encampment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an encampment and festival and concert and stuff, but it was a guy who stabbed another</p>
<p>guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, nothing coming up about, you know, any missing teenage girls.</p>
<p>As a theory, and it made sense because, yeah, I mean, most of her friends, when I talked</p>
<p>to them about that, about that possibility of her joining them, they were all like, oh,</p>
<p>yeah, she would&rsquo;ve loved that, but, you know, she never talked about it and made plans for</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Now, Detective Castellan has never ruled out the possibility of Nicky having run off with</p>
<p>the Rainbow family, but he&rsquo;s also had no luck finding her in the group.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2019 when Detective Castellan officially took over Nicky&rsquo;s case, and with</p>
<p>his fresh set of eyes, brought a big break in the case.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, he was able to identify and track down the owner of the mysterious</p>
<p>Oldsmobile that Dana and Allison had seen Nicky sitting in.</p>
<p>It turns out, when Nicky went missing in 2014, her older sister Jessica, who was estranged</p>
<p>from the family, was battling a heroin addiction, and Jessica had a 1988 Oldsmobile.</p>
<p>Not only that, when Castellan interviewed Jessica, he learned that she was with her</p>
<p>sister the night that Nicky vanished.</p>
<p>She said they went to Wendy&rsquo;s and had a late dinner and then just did a lot of catching</p>
<p>up because they hadn&rsquo;t seen each other in a long time.</p>
<p>The drugs were getting in the way of Jessie&rsquo;s, Jessica&rsquo;s life, which is why they hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seen each other in a while.</p>
<p>So I think it was during a moment of sobriety that she wanted to spend some time with Nicky.</p>
<p>In 2020, by the time Jessica had her first formal sit-down interview with the Weld County</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, she revealed to Detective Castellan that she was sober.</p>
<p>She went on to explain that the night Nicky vanished, she and her sister had been chatting</p>
<p>for hours in Allison and Dana&rsquo;s driveway.</p>
<p>Jessica said they talked about life and boys and future plans.</p>
<p>Around 3 a.m., Jessica said Nicky went into Dana and Allison&rsquo;s house and then she left.</p>
<p>Now this bit of information was a massive breakthrough in the case because for five</p>
<p>years no one knew whose car Nicky had been sitting in.</p>
<p>And not only that, Detective Castellan now had a brand new witness who could tighten</p>
<p>up the timeline leading up to Nicky&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>The other really important thing that Jessica was able to clarify for investigators was</p>
<p>why Nicky&rsquo;s car had been found broken down at the suspected drug house in Longmont.</p>
<p>Jessica said she had been the one to borrow it in late March or early April of 2014.</p>
<p>And when it had stopped being able to start, she&rsquo;d just abandoned it there.</p>
<p>So those pieces of information did bring a little bit of clarity to the case because</p>
<p>they filled in some gaps.</p>
<p>But nothing Jessica said pointed directly to any clues as to what happened to Nicky</p>
<p>after she went back inside Dana and Allison&rsquo;s house on April 9, 2014 around 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Jessica told Detective Castellan that her conversations with Nicky that night were normal.</p>
<p>She said Nicky had not mentioned any plans to move out of Dana&rsquo;s house and didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>any plans to leave Longmont.</p>
<p>Jessica also told the detective that Nicky was not struggling with substance use issues</p>
<p>like she was back then.</p>
<p>She knew her sister to be a good student and a pretty responsible teenager.</p>
<p>She said Nicky only partied socially and they were never together when Jessica was</p>
<p>using.</p>
<p>Also, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Jessica come forward with this information years earlier when it may have</p>
<p>actually been more useful?</p>
<p>Well, Detective Castellan said she was in a bad place back then.</p>
<p>And she said that&rsquo;s why she hadn&rsquo;t wanted to cooperate with police.</p>
<p>She was battling substance use issues alongside her boyfriend at the time, who actually ended</p>
<p>up later dying from an overdose.</p>
<p>Jessica claimed that her ongoing struggle with substance use in 2014 made her memories</p>
<p>fuzzy, and her entire attitude toward her sister&rsquo;s situation apathetic.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t till five years after her sister&rsquo;s disappearance that she got clean and felt</p>
<p>ready to talk to Detective Castellan.</p>
<p>After learning everything he could from Jessica, Castellan re-interviewed everyone involved</p>
<p>in the original case.</p>
<p>Nicky&rsquo;s parents, her ex-boyfriend Patrick, her friends, coworkers, Dana, and Allison.</p>
<p>He spent hours talking to each of them to be sure their statements hadn&rsquo;t changed,</p>
<p>and to make sure that he had all the information.</p>
<p>Everyone reiterated what they&rsquo;d originally said.</p>
<p>And despite so much time passing, no one had heard from or seen Nicky.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan came away from those interviews feeling conflicted about the evidence.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t believe, based on what he knows from the people who loved her, that Nicky</p>
<p>was capable of harming herself.</p>
<p>She never had any previous suicide attempts, so that was ruled out.</p>
<p>And for him, the evidence just didn&rsquo;t add up to her being a true runaway.</p>
<p>He thinks she would have said, hey, I think I want to move to California or Oregon or</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>But then, well, you put your guitar in your guitar case, you bring your phone charger</p>
<p>and you go get your last check.</p>
<p>Even if you didn&rsquo;t want to make a big deal, maybe you don&rsquo;t want to say goodbye to your</p>
<p>friends and family because it&rsquo;ll be too sad.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just going to move and you&rsquo;ll call them later while you get your last paycheck.</p>
<p>A stranger abduction is a theory that Castellan is not super sold on entirely, considering</p>
<p>Nicky appeared to have packed up her things and left.</p>
<p>But her tidy room doesn&rsquo;t rule out abduction completely.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan believes in his gut that something bad happened to Nicky, and that</p>
<p>she likely went with someone willingly before things turned deadly.</p>
<p>I think she was probably with somebody that she somewhat trusted enough to get her stuff</p>
<p>out of the house, into the vehicle with this person.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, she just forgot her guitar case and charger and then probably thought,</p>
<p>OK, well, I&rsquo;ll just go back for that.</p>
<p>But now this person&rsquo;s done something to me.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2020, Detective Castellan got assistance from a local dive team, and</p>
<p>they searched a lake at Lou Miller Park in Longmont.</p>
<p>There hadn&rsquo;t been a tip connected to the park, but that lake is just a stone&rsquo;s throw</p>
<p>away from Dana and Allison&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>The search was just an effort the investigators felt like they needed to take in order to</p>
<p>rule out a theory that maybe Nicky accidentally drowned in that lake or something.</p>
<p>The search took almost six hours, but they didn&rsquo;t find any human remains.</p>
<p>In order to keep the investigation active, Detective Castellan does weekly online checks</p>
<p>for anything associated with the case or the case evidence.</p>
<p>He looks for her guitar to see if it&rsquo;s been pawned anywhere.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have a serial number, but he knows the make and model.</p>
<p>Nothing has come of that yet, but he still checks all the time.</p>
<p>He also has Nicky&rsquo;s dental records and her DNA from a hairbrush she left at her parents'</p>
<p>house, so he does weekly searches in databases for unidentified remains around the country.</p>
<p>For young women that match her build and profile.</p>
<p>In November 2021, a young woman&rsquo;s remains were discovered in California.</p>
<p>So Detective Castellan did a DNA test against that, but it turned out not to be Nicky.</p>
<p>Nicky&rsquo;s disappearance continues to baffle her friends, family members, and investigators.</p>
<p>The fact that she was last seen with her sister, and her sister said that she saw Nicky go</p>
<p>back inside the house that night, and that Dana and Allison never heard her come in or</p>
<p>leave or anything, it&rsquo;s all left so many questions unanswered.</p>
<p>How does someone go missing from inside a small one-story house while people are home?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a major mystery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so bizarre that, you know, during that short timeframe she would disappear like that.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people out there who miss Nicky Silvers.</p>
<p>The spunky, free-spirited teenager brought a lot of joy to people in her life, and her</p>
<p>absence is still felt.</p>
<p>She would have turned 25 last week.</p>
<p>Nicky is described as 5 foot 8 inches tall and weighed 135 pounds when she went missing</p>
<p>eight years ago.</p>
<p>If you know anything about Nicky&rsquo;s whereabouts or what happened to her, please call the Weld</p>
<p>County Colorado Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 970-400-2827.</p>
