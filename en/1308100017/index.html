    <p>Listen up, listeners.</p>
<p>It is time to hear what you&rsquo;ve had it with on this special bonus episode of I&rsquo;ve Had</p>
<p>It Podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>But I like to call her Pops.</p>
<p>I do love, love, love the listener DMs.</p>
<p>I thought you were going to say, I do love, love, love the nickname you gave me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well then, speaking of an attitude of gratitude that you don&rsquo;t have, because everybody fucking</p>
<p>loves your name.</p>
<p>But you know what, Kylie, will you please play for us our first DM?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This one is from Adrian G.</p>
<p>Adrian.</p>
<p>Adrian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely tired of acronyms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting out of hand.</p>
<p>It was cute at first, but now everything is an acronym.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Out of office.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>It was that hard to type that?</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s, if you know, you know.</p>
<p>I had to look it up.</p>
<p>I am looking up acronyms weekly to figure out how to answer my emails or how to read</p>
<p>a message.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have to say, Adrian, I have the same problem exactly, and you&rsquo;re good at acronyms.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;ll send me an acronym and I will have to Google it.</p>
<p>Like what does this mean?</p>
<p>I have to Google them a lot too.</p>
<p>But then once you Google them, Adrian, and then you realize like LMK, let me know, then</p>
<p>I start using it all the time.</p>
<p>FSS, for fuck&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Oh, see, I didn&rsquo;t know that one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great one.</p>
<p>FML, fuck my life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s overused, I think.</p>
<p>That one, just in general, not related to this, but yes.</p>
<p>I just used that one when I lost the pickleball tournament, FML.</p>
<p>Perfect example of overuse.</p>
<p>No, I think that I can totally see where she&rsquo;s had it and it&rsquo;s true because the OOO, I recently</p>
<p>had to look that up.</p>
<p>Somebody put, it was like an auto reply email and I was like, I&rsquo;m currently OOO.</p>
<p>And I was like, what is OOO?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m constantly on the Urban Dictionary because there is a lot of acronym abuse.</p>
<p>100% acronym abuse.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>And OOO, that&rsquo;s ridiculous out of the office, especially on a professional email.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Sounds like she&rsquo;s getting them, too.</p>
<p>I bet the person that uses OOO-</p>
<p>Talks like this.</p>
<p>Engages in vocal fry and possibly a sign of baby Tom.</p>
<p>Let me ask you if you know what this one means, Angie.</p>
<p>G-O-A-T.</p>
<p>Greatest of all time, Tom Brady.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the sports acronyms.</p>
<p>Or do you think Tom Brady&rsquo;s the GOAT?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not go down a rabbit hole and turn this into a fucking sports podcast.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What about I-M-O?</p>
<p>In my opinion.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Did you just know that or did you-</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>Boomer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m-</p>
<p>Oh, fuck off, Nellie.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m as sharp as a tack.</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>I mean, I immediately sniffed that out.</p>
<p>Um, the baby of the podcast.</p>
<p>Kylie, do you- can you throw some out to see if we can get them?</p>
<p>I got one for you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>W-W-J-W-D.</p>
<p>What would Jennifer Welch do?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you guys regularly use an acronym every single day on your podcast?</p>
<p>C-U-N-T.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do.</p>
<p>So, Kylie, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We have to eat a little crow on that.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>Adrienne, we are a part of the problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of doing a play on words, though, a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little cheeky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little cheeky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little cheeky.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Well, I just, for the record, had no idea what that was.</p>
<p>C-U-N-T Tuesday.</p>
<p>Like, I legitimately did not know that.</p>
<p>You did not know until 2017 that C-U-N-T Tuesday was a way to call somebody a cunt?</p>
<p>Had no idea.</p>
<p>And this one just rubbed it in my face for weeks before she told me.</p>
<p>I think we need to resurrect that rubbing in the face.</p>
<p>Kylie, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got Lori.</p>
<p>Lori.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with stupidity.</p>
<p>I have no patience for it.</p>
<p>When do people lose common sense or just the ability to comprehend basic information or</p>
<p>directions?</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in a pharmacy for 27 years.</p>
<p>And as you know, when you pick up prescriptions, they all have directions on it.</p>
<p>Well, one time I had a client come in, pick up their prescription,</p>
<p>go home, and call right back.</p>
<p>Reason they were calling back is they had picked up a cream.</p>
<p>And on this cream, the direction said, apply locally to affected area.</p>
<p>I said, OK, what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>They were going out of town that weekend and wanted to know if they could still use the</p>
<p>cream.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Again, stupidity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Apply locally.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Lori.</p>
<p>God love you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>What a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and say that wasn&rsquo;t just a stupid question.</p>
<p>That was just a stupid person.</p>
<p>It was a stupid person asking a stupid question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I cannot get enough of it.</p>
<p>That shit is rock solid gold, 24 karat diamond encrusted.</p>
<p>Great shit right there.</p>
<p>I mean, that might go on the wall of fame.</p>
<p>Lori, I think you&rsquo;ll find this interesting as a pharmacist.</p>
<p>So Pumps had had all three of her kids and she decided she was going to get this procedure</p>
<p>called an ablation or something like this so she wouldn&rsquo;t have a period anymore.</p>
<p>And she asked me to drive her to the procedure.</p>
<p>I hate blood.</p>
<p>I hate hospitals.</p>
<p>I hate medical procedures.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never watched one second of ER despite thinking George Clooney is a total smoke show.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how much I don&rsquo;t like hospitals or hospital procedures.</p>
<p>But because I love Pumps, I selflessly drove her to her OBGYN appointment.</p>
<p>So they take her in and she&rsquo;s like, can Jenny sit right outside the room?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, we&rsquo;ll put a chair.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll sit right outside here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m literally right outside the door.</p>
<p>So the doctor goes in and then all of a sudden I hear this huge ruckus in the room.</p>
<p>Big ruckus.</p>
<p>A big brouhaha, if you will, right?</p>
<p>Everybody was dying laughing.</p>
<p>The nurse opens the door.</p>
<p>Angie&rsquo;s legs are in the stirrups and there&rsquo;s kind of a sheet over it.</p>
<p>And the gynecologist has his hands on her knees.</p>
<p>And then his head is bobbing up and down, dying in laughter.</p>
<p>I mean, it almost looks like he was performing oral sex.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s fucking dying laughing.</p>
<p>And I go, oh, God, what has she done?</p>
<p>And they said, well, we gave her a pill to take prior to the procedure.</p>
<p>So it would kind of open up the vagine a bit.</p>
<p>And I asked her if she took it.</p>
<p>And she said, yes, I did.</p>
<p>I stuck it right up my vagina one hour before the appointment, just like you told me.</p>
<p>And they said it was oral.</p>
<p>You were supposed to swallow it.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, my bad.</p>
<p>We have Angie over here cramming shit up her twat, you know?</p>
<p>And I think she, you know, I could see you falling prey to the local.</p>
<p>I mean, after my performance with the ablation, I can&rsquo;t throw too many stones.</p>
<p>I mean, but I have had it with stupid people not getting shit.</p>
<p>I mean, Laurie, please bring more of those to our yes.</p>
<p>Laurie might just have to be a weekly segment if she can put things like that up.</p>
<p>All right, Kylie, who&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>The next one is Jennifer J.</p>
<p>Jennifer J.</p>
<p>Jennifer J.</p>
<p>I have had it with the guy at the front desk at my office building.</p>
<p>I have to say good morning to him.</p>
<p>And then he says, how was your night?</p>
<p>And then when I go out at lunch, he says, have a good lunch.</p>
<p>Or if I stay in and fix lunch, he stands in there and talks to me and asks me what I&rsquo;m fixing.</p>
<p>Or if I go to the bathroom, he&rsquo;s like, how are you having a good day?</p>
<p>And when I leave at night, he says, have a good night.</p>
<p>I just want to say good morning to you and smile and not talk to you anymore the rest of the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I ask.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>I 100% agree, Jennifer.</p>
<p>100% agree.</p>
<p>This goes right into our wheelhouse of unnecessary interactions.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Unnecessary interactions in the office, in the house, with friends.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Those are all completely unnecessary interactions from this dude.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s hawking her out while she&rsquo;s making her lunch.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s just worse.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s grandstanding around the office.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s grandstanding around the office trying to be everybody&rsquo;s favorite.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s backfiring spectacularly because she got out her phone and sent a voice memo</p>
<p>to bitch about his ass, which I support, Jennifer J.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s completely right.</p>
<p>No small talk.</p>
<p>Do you remember that episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm where Larry has to go to the bathroom</p>
<p>and Richard Lewis&rsquo;s girlfriend&rsquo;s named Cha-Cha, and she keeps commenting,</p>
<p>hey, Larry, you going to the bathroom?</p>
<p>Boy, you were in there a long time, Larry.</p>
<p>I think there are these people at offices that are way, they&rsquo;ve got their pulse on way</p>
<p>too much in the office.</p>
<p>Go in, keep your head down, do your fucking job, crack a joke from time to time, and move</p>
<p>on down the road.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, agree.</p>
<p>I agree, Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Maybe we should get Jennifer a card that says, I&rsquo;ve had it podcast, and you flip it on the</p>
<p>other side, and she can just flash it on and it says, no small talk today.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next, Kylie?</p>
<p>Your last one is Amanda G.</p>
<p>Amanda.</p>
<p>I have had it.</p>
<p>Had it with people driving slow in the fast lane.</p>
<p>Move out of my way.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>This lane is for the people that can afford the speeding ticket.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 100% agree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>It is a great, I&rsquo;ve had it in there.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable how badly the people in this country, in particular, do not follow</p>
<p>that rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a law in certain states.</p>
<p>You cannot drive slow in the fast lane.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll pull you over for a ticket.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable how they just go, and they just take their time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started getting kind of aggressive because I have to drive to Dallas a lot for work.</p>
<p>Not you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shocking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such, I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>I will flash my brides at them to say, hey, I&rsquo;m here, you need to get your ass over because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staying in the left lane because that&rsquo;s what they do in Europe.</p>
<p>I mean, there is zero tolerance.</p>
<p>The left lane is to be used for passing only.</p>
<p>Everybody drives on the right, use the left to pass.</p>
<p>I mean, that is 100%.</p>
<p>It needs to be dealt with.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s applicable across the board.</p>
<p>Escalators, those trams that you take in the airport, all of it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on this.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying we&rsquo;ve touched on it.</p>
<p>But left lane is for passing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Across the board.</p>
<p>For people that want to move slowly.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s for people who want to move quickly.</p>
<p>Quickly.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>Almost had it.</p>
<p>You almost.</p>
<p>Almost had it.</p>
<p>You almost nailed it.</p>
<p>In so many ways.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I completely and totally agree.</p>
<p>I have had it with that.</p>
<p>The only thing I can see doing the aggressive light flash on the highway, but honestly,</p>
<p>if you do that in town, you don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re not going to road rage and shoot you.</p>
<p>I mean, that is the fear of any of this or the guns.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had it with the guns.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be a whole other episode.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Unto itself.</p>
<p>But that is a whole thing.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve told my boys, just pump the brakes on having any sort of road rage.</p>
<p>Because some people have guns and they&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>That reminds me of a story.</p>
<p>So when I was in high school, we piled in the car.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re 16.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re playing the music.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re loud.</p>
<p>I mean, we probably are the coolest people to ever be born in history.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m driving.</p>
<p>And this guy&rsquo;s going slow.</p>
<p>So of course, I&rsquo;m honk, honk, honk.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all like, fuck you, just totally being the biggest assholes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So then we stop at the stoplight.</p>
<p>That motherfucker got out of his car and banked on the window.</p>
<p>He is like, that is disrespectful.</p>
<p>That is rude.</p>
<p>And we were all just like tail between our legs.</p>
<p>Boy, did we find out how not cool we were.</p>
<p>Nowadays, he could have blown our heads off.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you got to really watch the bird and all that.</p>
<p>Did you just say nowadays?</p>
<p>Nowadays.</p>
<p>You really do prove again and again that you are the oldest person in the room.</p>
<p>And prettiest.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>But I get best dressed.</p>
<p>For 60, I think I&rsquo;m looking pretty good.</p>
<p>Listener, Pumps is starting this new thing where she&rsquo;s going to start telling everybody she&rsquo;s 60.</p>
<p>So that everybody&rsquo;s like, oh, my God, you look so good for 60.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty smart.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Amanda had the best sound design.</p>
<p>With the blinker.</p>
<p>With the blinker.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>We had some car sounds going and she had the blinker on, which made me think that she was so mad.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That someone was not getting over that she actually picked up her phone in the moment.</p>
<p>On the highway.</p>
<p>And just did it right there in the moment.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>So Amanda, great sound design on that.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Bonus points.</p>
<p>Yeah, bonus points.</p>
<p>For Amanda.</p>
<p>So listen up, listener.</p>
<p>We need these voice memos sent to I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast on Instagram, direct message.</p>
<p>What do they direct message?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>I thought you did say dot com afterwards, but you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What about, but what do we want them to direct message to us?</p>
<p>That direct, oh, a voice memo.</p>
<p>I mean, nails it.</p>
<p>Steel trap.</p>
<p>You guys, it&rsquo;s unbelievable how good Pumps is at delivering information.</p>
<p>Round of applause for her.</p>
<p>She delivers information to the listener.</p>
<p>A voice memo to our Instagram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve Had It.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>I mean, nailed it right there.</p>
<p>Dot com.</p>
<p>I was about to say it.</p>
<p>Okay, listener, we will see you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Or Thursday.</p>
<p>See you next Thursday.</p>
<p>But either way, what does that spell?</p>
<p>There you have it.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>All I can say about that is I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
