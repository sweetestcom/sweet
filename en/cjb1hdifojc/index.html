trusted credible and reliable that&amp;rsquo;s the topic of today now of course most people go online they do a search and usually whatever is first they pick that as the most credible or reliable information and so that&amp;rsquo;s what i did i actually went online and i typed in the best way to lose weight and then what i did is i ordered their booklet and so what we&amp;rsquo;re going to do today is we&amp;rsquo;re going to go through it and i&amp;rsquo;m not going to mention who it is whatever i&amp;rsquo;m just going to kind of go through it and i want to evaluate it from two viewpoints one from my viewpoint and two from a consumer&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint what you&amp;rsquo;re going to find out there is so much information and data in this booklet and really no emphasis on the most important things versus all the other stuff that may not matter what is the most important thing to know about this do i have to read the entire article an entire book and then do everything or do i just focus on one thing or two things that is a big issue so what makes something credible is that the number of studies that are backing it up the problem with studies is most people don&amp;rsquo;t read them they&amp;rsquo;re relying on second-hand information and also there&amp;rsquo;s a ton of manipulation and bias in the area of research what about testimonials i like testimonials especially if they&amp;rsquo;re video or picture because that doesn&amp;rsquo;t lie i think even though it&amp;rsquo;s anecdotal i think they&amp;rsquo;re credible also reviews they can be faked but if i see a comparison with two different products and one has a lot more views i&amp;rsquo;ll have a tendency to buy that product over this product over here and before i get into it i want to share with you a very interesting observation that i made just being in practice for 30 years whatever is touted as the most reliable information the most credible the most trustworthy information especially if it&amp;rsquo;s in the area of mainstream i usually look in the exact opposite direction i have found through experience that it ends up not being the most reliable information and what happens if someone has a fixed idea and knows everything about it it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to teach them anything because they won&amp;rsquo;t look at the information they already have their mind made up so when you evaluate something you have to look at the information yourself you have to ask yourself does it make sense you have to differentiate is it fact from opinion so let&amp;rsquo;s go through this this booklet i read the whole thing and the first thing we&amp;rsquo;re talking about there is no secret that two and three american adults way too much the question is why as it turns out there isn&amp;rsquo;t one simple answer darn it i was looking for that simple answer it starts with a combination of genes and environment we live in today okay so right there talking about genetics okay and a little bit later they they said that scientists have found 127 different genes related to obesity but that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it so now the point is okay what can you do if you have a genetic weakness there&amp;rsquo;s not much you can do so right there if it&amp;rsquo;s genetics and i&amp;rsquo;m a consumer reading this i&amp;rsquo;m like oh i guess i just have bad genes and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing i can do about it right and so then they talk about stubborn hormones they talk about leptin okay which has to do with appetite and then they get into consuming high calorie foods and too little exercise okay i mean we&amp;rsquo;ve heard that a million times right we know that going on a low calorie diet this does not work so then they get into the power of genetic influences could be up to 40 of your bmi which you know what that&amp;rsquo;s just opinion that&amp;rsquo;s not a fact i totally actually disagree with that but if i was a consumer i&amp;rsquo;m like oh geez i might have to go check my genetics there that could be why i&amp;rsquo;m not losing weight so any diet that i do and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work i can just blame it on my genes right all right next part here we&amp;rsquo;re talking about calories and portion control having again it&amp;rsquo;s like eating less calories it says right here in in one study researchers offered volunteers four different serving sizes of macaroni and cheese okay when served the largest portion the volunteers polished off 30 percent more food than when given the smallest portion they didn&amp;rsquo;t report feeling any more full than when they ate the smaller size now let me just say something about this right here this information is just very confusing because what they&amp;rsquo;re omitting is the fact that if you eat any carbs at all especially macaroni and cheese you&amp;rsquo;re going to stimulate insulin and insulin is going to cause hunger so as far as portion size whether you have a big bowl of macaroni and cheese or a little bowl it&amp;rsquo;s still going to make you hungry and this gives us no good advice or information and then here on this page it talks about metabolic syndrome okay that&amp;rsquo;s like when you have high blood pressure high cholesterol you&amp;rsquo;re pre-diabetic and you have visceral fat right here but nowhere in there do they talk about what causes that high levels of insulin so you&amp;rsquo;re omitting that piece of data they&amp;rsquo;re talking about you should lose weight to improve your metabolic syndrome just like right here lose weight keep it off and maintain a healthier weight my whole thing is let&amp;rsquo;s get healthy first so you can lose weight but that&amp;rsquo;s not their motto all right next page we have some tips brown bag it at least three times a week add two healthy foods to your shopping list rethink your drink all right these are all tips that are pretty low on the list of importance all right next page it says avoid ultra high calorie foods and they&amp;rsquo;re talking about fats right saturated fats well we know fats are necessary to be able to satisfy you so if you&amp;rsquo;re going low fat lean which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to in a little bit you&amp;rsquo;re just going to be actually more hungry because there&amp;rsquo;s nothing there to satisfy you especially if you&amp;rsquo;re doing snacks okay this next part they&amp;rsquo;re talking about strict calorie counting isn&amp;rsquo;t the best strategy okay well that&amp;rsquo;s good and then we get over here it says beating hungry with a high quality diet so there&amp;rsquo;s a quote here it says eating processed carbohydrates raises insulin levels and insulin drives calories into fat cells for storage well thank you right here is the most important sentence of the entire book but there&amp;rsquo;s no other mention of this okay so they&amp;rsquo;re actually telling us that you know process carbohydrates gonna raise insulin and you&amp;rsquo;re gonna store fat but the next part of the page it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s giving you all these carbohydrates you should be eating it says right here good carbohydrates although processed carbohydrates can lead to weight gain not all carbohydrates are bad in fact carbohydrate heavy foods such as peas beans lentils fruits vegetables and whole grains can be a healthy part of your weight loss well not if you&amp;rsquo;re the average person in america not if you have insulin resistance not if you are over the age of 40.'>

<p>﻿how does someone really know if information on 
health weight loss or whatever is trusted credible  </p>
<p>and reliable that&rsquo;s the topic of today now of 
course most people go online they do a search  </p>
<p>and usually whatever is first they pick that as 
the most credible or reliable information and  </p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what i did i actually went online 
and i typed in the best way to lose weight  </p>
<p>and then what i did is i ordered their booklet and 
so what we&rsquo;re going to do today is we&rsquo;re going to  </p>
<p>go through it and i&rsquo;m not going to mention who it 
is whatever i&rsquo;m just going to kind of go through  </p>
<p>it and i want to evaluate it from two viewpoints 
one from my viewpoint and two from a consumer&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>viewpoint what you&rsquo;re going to find out there is 
so much information and data in this booklet and  </p>
<p>really no emphasis on the most important things 
versus all the other stuff that may not matter  </p>
<p>what is the most important thing to know about 
this do i have to read the entire article an  </p>
<p>entire book and then do everything or do i just 
focus on one thing or two things that is a big  </p>
<p>issue so what makes something credible is that 
the number of studies that are backing it up the  </p>
<p>problem with studies is most people don&rsquo;t read 
them they&rsquo;re relying on second-hand information  </p>
<p>and also there&rsquo;s a ton of manipulation and bias 
in the area of research what about testimonials  </p>
<p>i like testimonials especially if they&rsquo;re video 
or picture because that doesn&rsquo;t lie i think even  </p>
<p>though it&rsquo;s anecdotal i think they&rsquo;re credible 
also reviews they can be faked but if i see a  </p>
<p>comparison with two different products and one has 
a lot more views i&rsquo;ll have a tendency to buy that  </p>
<p>product over this product over here and before 
i get into it i want to share with you a very  </p>
<p>interesting observation that i made just being 
in practice for 30 years whatever is touted as  </p>
<p>the most reliable information the most credible 
the most trustworthy information especially if  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the area of mainstream i usually look in 
the exact opposite direction i have found through  </p>
<p>experience that it ends up not being the most 
reliable information and what happens if someone  </p>
<p>has a fixed idea and knows everything about it 
it&rsquo;s almost impossible to teach them anything  </p>
<p>because they won&rsquo;t look at the information 
they already have their mind made up so when  </p>
<p>you evaluate something you have to look at the 
information yourself you have to ask yourself does  </p>
<p>it make sense you have to differentiate is it fact 
from opinion so let&rsquo;s go through this this booklet  </p>
<p>i read the whole thing and the first thing 
we&rsquo;re talking about there is no secret that  </p>
<p>two and three american adults way too much the 
question is why as it turns out there isn&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>one simple answer darn it i was looking for 
that simple answer it starts with a combination  </p>
<p>of genes and environment we live in today okay 
so right there talking about genetics okay and  </p>
<p>a little bit later they they said that scientists 
have found 127 different genes related to obesity  </p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s pretty much it so now the point is okay 
what can you do if you have a genetic weakness  </p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not much you can do so right there if 
it&rsquo;s genetics and i&rsquo;m a consumer reading this  </p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like oh i guess i just have bad genes and 
there&rsquo;s nothing i can do about it right and so  </p>
<p>then they talk about stubborn hormones they talk 
about leptin okay which has to do with appetite  </p>
<p>and then they get into consuming high calorie 
foods and too little exercise okay i mean  </p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve heard that a million times right we know 
that going on a low calorie diet this does not  </p>
<p>work so then they get into the power of genetic 
influences could be up to 40 of your bmi which  </p>
<p>you know what that&rsquo;s just opinion that&rsquo;s not 
a fact i totally actually disagree with that  </p>
<p>but if i was a consumer i&rsquo;m like oh geez i might 
have to go check my genetics there that could be  </p>
<p>why i&rsquo;m not losing weight so any diet that i do 
and it doesn&rsquo;t work i can just blame it on my  </p>
<p>genes right all right next part here we&rsquo;re 
talking about calories and portion control  </p>
<p>having again it&rsquo;s like eating less calories  </p>
<p>it says right here in in one study researchers 
offered volunteers four different serving sizes of  </p>
<p>macaroni and cheese okay when served the largest 
portion the volunteers polished off 30 percent  </p>
<p>more food than when given the smallest portion 
they didn&rsquo;t report feeling any more full than  </p>
<p>when they ate the smaller size now let me just say 
something about this right here this information  </p>
<p>is just very confusing because what they&rsquo;re 
omitting is the fact that if you eat any carbs  </p>
<p>at all especially macaroni and cheese you&rsquo;re going 
to stimulate insulin and insulin is going to cause  </p>
<p>hunger so as far as portion size whether you have 
a big bowl of macaroni and cheese or a little  </p>
<p>bowl it&rsquo;s still going to make you hungry and 
this gives us no good advice or information and  </p>
<p>then here on this page it talks about metabolic 
syndrome okay that&rsquo;s like when you have high blood  </p>
<p>pressure high cholesterol you&rsquo;re pre-diabetic 
and you have visceral fat right here but  </p>
<p>nowhere in there do they talk about what causes 
that high levels of insulin so you&rsquo;re omitting  </p>
<p>that piece of data they&rsquo;re talking about you 
should lose weight to improve your metabolic  </p>
<p>syndrome just like right here lose weight keep it 
off and maintain a healthier weight my whole thing  </p>
<p>is let&rsquo;s get healthy first so you can lose weight 
but that&rsquo;s not their motto all right next page we  </p>
<p>have some tips brown bag it at least three times 
a week add two healthy foods to your shopping list  </p>
<p>rethink your drink all right these are all tips 
that are pretty low on the list of importance  </p>
<p>all right next page it says avoid ultra high 
calorie foods and they&rsquo;re talking about fats right  </p>
<p>saturated fats well we know fats are necessary to 
be able to satisfy you so if you&rsquo;re going low fat  </p>
<p>lean which we&rsquo;ll get to in a 
little bit you&rsquo;re just going to be  </p>
<p>actually more hungry because there&rsquo;s nothing 
there to satisfy you especially if you&rsquo;re doing  </p>
<p>snacks okay this next part they&rsquo;re talking about 
strict calorie counting isn&rsquo;t the best strategy  </p>
<p>okay well that&rsquo;s good and then we get over here 
it says beating hungry with a high quality diet  </p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a quote here it says eating processed 
carbohydrates raises insulin levels and insulin  </p>
<p>drives calories into fat cells for storage 
well thank you right here is the most important  </p>
<p>sentence of the entire book but there&rsquo;s no other 
mention of this okay so they&rsquo;re actually telling  </p>
<p>us that you know process carbohydrates gonna raise 
insulin and you&rsquo;re gonna store fat but the next  </p>
<p>part of the page it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s giving you all 
these carbohydrates you should be eating  </p>
<p>it says right here good carbohydrates although 
processed carbohydrates can lead to weight gain  </p>
<p>not all carbohydrates are bad in fact carbohydrate 
heavy foods such as peas beans lentils fruits  </p>
<p>vegetables and whole grains can be a healthy 
part of your weight loss well not if you&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>the average person in america not if you have 
insulin resistance not if you are over the age  </p>
<p>of 40. you have to stop the q-tip when there&rsquo;s 
resistance here&rsquo;s the thing even when i wrote my  </p>
<p>first book i recommended consuming fruits this 
is probably i don&rsquo;t know maybe 10 years ago and  </p>
<p>i was eating apples every day those apples were 
keeping me overweight i think i weighed 211 pounds  </p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 180 now and all i did is remove the apples 
i mean so an apple has like 19 grams of sugar  </p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re recommending whole grains not 
a good idea all right next page here we get into  </p>
<p>consuming fiber foods again more 
grains one of the easiest ways  </p>
<p>to sneak more fiber into your diet is to increase 
the intake of whole grains what about vegetables  </p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t mention that people who on a regular 
basis consume whole grains tend to have lower  </p>
<p>bmi and less body fat than those who don&rsquo;t eat 
whole grains i would love to see that study and  </p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not talking about a questionnaire study i&rsquo;m 
talking about an actual study i will guarantee  </p>
<p>there is no study other than a questionnaire over 
five years aim for at least three servings every  </p>
<p>day for more ideas of boosting your fiber see 
page 10 okay and the recommending fruits right  </p>
<p>here okay then we get into lean proteins okay you 
should always have lean proteins skinless chicken  </p>
<p>breasts etc etc like the fats gonna really 
make you fat no no when you have lean protein  </p>
<p>you actually immediately increase the food&rsquo;s 
relationship to insulin you increase more insulin  </p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a scale called the insulin index and the 
leaner the protein the higher it is on that scale  </p>
<p>so the fattier the protein the lower the 
insulin response so an insulin index is those  </p>
<p>non-carbohydrate foods that trigger insulin 
compared to the glycemic index which is  </p>
<p>just carbs all right so here we have another 
one another sentence here i like this they go  </p>
<p>some research even hence this type of fat may 
increase the risk of type 2 diabetes we&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>talking about saturated fats i like that they 
don&rsquo;t tell you what research and all they say  </p>
<p>is it hints so it doesn&rsquo;t actually come 
out and say it so it might influence it  </p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s just a way of saying they don&rsquo;t 
really know okay what&rsquo;s more in late 2015  </p>
<p>an international panel of experts convened by 
the world health organization concluded that  </p>
<p>processed meats raised the risk of colon cancer 
instead stick with a healthier low saturated fat  </p>
<p>options such as chicken fish eggs tofu beans and 
lentils wait a second no no what if you&rsquo;re doing  </p>
<p>grass-fed beef that&rsquo;s high in saturated fat isn&rsquo;t 
that okay so that&rsquo;s not the type of processed  </p>
<p>foods that they&rsquo;re studied there actually is no 
study that i know about that&rsquo;s actually evaluating  </p>
<p>grass-fed beef or organic beef it&rsquo;s mainly 
processed meats with nitrates and other  </p>
<p>chemicals all right next part talking about power 
up your morning with you guessed it breakfast is  </p>
<p>the perfect way to start your day on the right 
track here&rsquo;s why breakfast can supply lots of  </p>
<p>foods and nutrients that are linked to less hunger 
well wait a second you just went to bed last night  </p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t eat the whole night you&rsquo;re in 
this fast and then you wake up many people aren&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>even hungry and then you&rsquo;re going to eat you&rsquo;re 
breaking the fast so guess what if you were just  </p>
<p>to keep going you would actually not be hungry 
maybe until noon so i just disagree with that  </p>
<p>okay so we have breakfast doesn&rsquo;t have to be a 
major meal work some extra fiber into your day by  </p>
<p>grabbing a couple of slices of whole wheat toast 
or a whole grain english muffin or if you have a  </p>
<p>few extra minutes pour yourself a bowl of whole 
grain cereal boy they&rsquo;re really pushing these  </p>
<p>grains aren&rsquo;t they so it&rsquo;s more carbs more carbs 
what&rsquo;s going to happen is about an hour and a half  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be hungry why because of insulin 
and this is what is missing in this publication  </p>
<p>someone without the knowledge that insulin is like 
the most important thing is going to read this  </p>
<p>and just be totally confused and say well yeah i 
already tried that 20 years ago it didn&rsquo;t work and  </p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s my genes right all right next part says 
the art of snacking okay it says that you may have  </p>
<p>heard that eating lots of small meals or snacks 
is the best way to curb your appetite the truth  </p>
<p>is this advice has been greatly exaggerated now 
on the second part of the page it&rsquo;s telling you  </p>
<p>when choosing snacks simply follow the same 
guidelines prioritize whole foods with minimal  </p>
<p>processing and look for healthier sources of fat 
carbs and protein so they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re saying that  </p>
<p>you know maybe snacking is not a good 
idea but then they&rsquo;re telling you  </p>
<p>to snack here&rsquo;s a good one it says hide snack 
foods if you keep your salty or sugary snacks  </p>
<p>on the kitchen counter find them a new home tucked 
away in the pantry if they&rsquo;re not in your line of  </p>
<p>vision every time you enter the kitchen you&rsquo;ll 
be less tempted to eat them that is not true  </p>
<p>i know people that will search out these 
carbohydrates every night looking for these snacks  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a big deal to go into the pantry and grab 
them why even buy these snacks in the first place  </p>
<p>don&rsquo;t buy them keep them out of the house or 
on on page 29 you can just if this doesn&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>work you can try cognitive behavior therapy 
okay so they give you that option they also  </p>
<p>give you an option of gastric bypass so 
here&rsquo;s the problem you have this document  </p>
<p>that gives you a lot of information with 
some true information some false information  </p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t tell you what is the most important 
information and that is this right here base the  </p>
<p>whole diet on keeping your insulin low and you 
will be successful all right talk to you later  </p>
<p>hey before you go real quick i have a course 
entitled how to bulletproof your immune system  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and 
here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you here is your environment</p>
<p>everyone is focused on this over here 
avoiding your environment but what about here  </p>
<p>what about strengthening your immune system 
that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show  </p>
<p>you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can 
tolerate and resist your environment much better  </p>

immune system i put a link  </p>
