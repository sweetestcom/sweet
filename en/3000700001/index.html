She has 9 Grammys.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s Oscar nominated, an
entrepreneur, a visionary, and</p>
<p>this Sunday at the Apple Music
Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show,</p>
<p>the wait is over!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 2,190 days.
Dude.</p>
<p>Rihanna, we waited for you.</p>
<p>You it&rsquo;s been over six years</p>
<p>since the nine-time Grammy
winner &ndash;</p>
<p>Rihanna.
RiRi, where have you been?</p>
<p>We have been impatiently
waiting for &ndash;</p>
<p>The fans just predicted the
end of Rihanna.</p>
<p>Has anyone &ndash;
Rihanna.</p>
<p>(Multiple voices talking at
once.)</p>
<p>‚ô™ You needed me ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ You needed me ‚ô™</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>From Apple Music Radio and o
&ndash; the host of &ldquo;The Nadeska</p>
<p>Show,&rdquo; please welcome our girl,
Nadeska Alexis!</p>
<p>(Applause)</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Good morning</p>
<p>and thank you all so much for
joining us here today.</p>
<p>For the past few years, I have
watched it press conference from</p>
<p>home on the couch in my pajamas.
So it&rsquo;s really nice to be here</p>
<p>with you all in person.
At Apple Music, we are very,</p>
<p>very, passionate about
celebrating and supporting</p>
<p>artists and about having
meaningful conversations around</p>
<p>music.
So we are thrilled to be joining</p>
<p>the NFL and Roc Nation to bring
the Apple Music Super Bowl LVII</p>
<p>Halftime Show to life.
And, of course, to see an icon</p>
<p>make her long-awaited return to
the stage.</p>
<p>Today, we get to hear what this
moment means to her directly</p>
<p>from her.
So please join me in welcoming</p>
<p>Rihanna!
(Cheers and Applause).</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Hello.
Hey, everyone.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Good morning.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Okay.
NADESKA ALEXIS: It&rsquo;s so nice</p>
<p>to have you here.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my pleasure.
It&rsquo;s my pleasure.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Listen, I
know you have been working</p>
<p>really, really hard to be
getting ready for this show and</p>
<p>probably haven&rsquo;t gotten enough
sleep.</p>
<p>You still have a glow, is that
the Fenty highlighter, or are</p>
<p>you just excited here.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Fenty highlighter is</p>
<p>helping today.
I have yet to sleep.</p>
<p>We were working at the venue all
last night and I kind of just</p>
<p>stayed there and ended up in a
prep and somehow I&rsquo;m here at a</p>
<p>press conference right now.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Here and</p>
<p>smiling at a press conference
and you still have a long day</p>
<p>ahead.
You have rehearsals later.</p>
<p>Going into a show like this, we
all know you are going to put on</p>
<p>an incredible show and we are so
excited but at the end of the</p>
<p>day, you are still a human,
right?</p>
<p>And you still need to get
yourself mentally ready for</p>
<p>this.
So how do you prepare for a date</p>
<p>like today?
I listened to &ldquo;Needed Me&rdquo; about</p>
<p>100 times this morning, and I
felt good to go, but you</p>
<p>probably have a better strategy.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: A day like today?</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: A day like
Sunday.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Now, that&rsquo;s the one.
I have been so focused on the</p>
<p>Super Bowl, I totally forgot
that my birthday is coming up.</p>
<p>I totally forgot about
Valentine&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just Super Bowl, Super Bowl,
Super Bowl.</p>
<p>So a lot of preparation.
A lot of moving parts and this</p>
<p>week, this is the week that it
really is being tested.</p>
<p>Everyone, we&rsquo;re just tightening
up everything.</p>
<p>Everybody is dialing in.
Everybody is do tuning up.</p>
<p>And a lot of moving parts.
It&rsquo;s literally 3 to 400 people</p>
<p>breaking the stage down and
building it back up and getting</p>
<p>it out in eight minutes.
It&rsquo;s incredible!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: But if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>impossible, that means you can
do it.</p>
<p>You have always been that person
who could do it.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: I don&rsquo;t know that I
can do that in eight minutes,</p>
<p>but we &ndash; we&rsquo;re excited to do
the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>We are.
We&rsquo;ve been working on it for a</p>
<p>while, and every day it just
gets closer and closer to the</p>
<p>finished product.
And today&rsquo;s a really big</p>
<p>rehearsal, really important one.
So that will be crucial for</p>
<p>Sunday.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: I&rsquo;m excited</p>
<p>to see that.
And, you know, I&rsquo;m a big</p>
<p>believer in timing, that some of
the most special and magical</p>
<p>moments in our lives, they line
up in a way that I think that we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t always anticipate and
predict.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the universe knows.
So I&rsquo;m wondering for you, what</p>
<p>does it feel like for this
performance to land at this</p>
<p>moment in your life and in your
career?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: It feels like it
could have only been now.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Yeah.
RIHANNA: I mean when I first</p>
<p>got the call to do it, again
this year, I was like&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you sure?
Like, I&rsquo;m &ndash; I&rsquo;m three months</p>
<p>post.
Um.</p>
<p>Should I be making major
decisions like this right now?</p>
<p>I might regret this.
When you become a mom, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that just happens
where you feel like you could</p>
<p>take on the world.
You can do anything.</p>
<p>And the Super Bowl is one of the
biggest stages in the world.</p>
<p>So as scary as that was because
I haven&rsquo;t been on stage in seven</p>
<p>years, there&rsquo;s something
exhilarating about the challenge</p>
<p>of it all.
And it&rsquo;s important for me to do</p>
<p>this this year.
It&rsquo;s important for</p>
<p>representation.
It&rsquo;s important for my son to see</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: It is.</p>
<p>You make taking on a new
challenge look easy.</p>
<p>And I know that it isn&rsquo;t
because, again, you are a human</p>
<p>being.
But you have always seemed so</p>
<p>brave and, you know, like one to
take risks.</p>
<p>And I actually want to share
something with you, because I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s important for you to
take a minute to reflect, which</p>
<p>you probably haven&rsquo;t been able
to do because you are so busy.</p>
<p>So for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know a
couple of years ago, Rihanna</p>
<p>released it beautiful coffee
table book and you got to take a</p>
<p>journey through her life.
My favorite part was an excerpt,</p>
<p>I think her grade school report
card.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what her teacher wrote
about her.</p>
<p>She is sure of herself and
displays a positive attitude.</p>
<p>I still see that today.
She&rsquo;s friendly.</p>
<p>She takes a leading role in
group activities.</p>
<p>She expresses her ideas clearly
and intelligently, and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very relaxed in acting out
ideas.</p>
<p>We have seen you evolve over the
years from your first album to</p>
<p>becoming a mom and a
businesswoman and a music</p>
<p>powerhouse, but you still very
much seem like that little girl</p>
<p>in that report card.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: That was trippy to</p>
<p>hear you read that out, because
I feel like you were kind of</p>
<p>describing me right now.
Especially the relaxed part.</p>
<p>(Laughter).
That&rsquo;s a Caribbean thing.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: It really is.
It seems like your values</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t changed over time,
although you have obviously</p>
<p>grown in a lot of other ways.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.
A lot of my core values have</p>
<p>never left me.
A lot of the lessons I have</p>
<p>learned my earliest years, I
have never gotten.</p>
<p>And I carry them throughout my
life and my career.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Your work
ethic is definitely one of those</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Thank you.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: You are
immensely talented, but it takes</p>
<p>a special kind of person to put
in the work that you have done</p>
<p>over the years and I think we&rsquo;re
going to see that displayed, you</p>
<p>know, at the Apple Music
Halftime Show on fund.</p>
<p>So tell me what it was like &ndash;
on Sunday.</p>
<p>So tell me what it was like to
put the show together, the</p>
<p>setlist.
You went on an incredible run</p>
<p>from first album, up until
&ldquo;Unapologetic&rdquo; where it seemed</p>
<p>like you never took a break or
took time off.</p>
<p>Now that you are a few years
removed from all of those songs,</p>
<p>what was it like to revisit
those to build the set list.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: The set list was the
biggest challenge.</p>
<p>That was the hardest, hardest
part.</p>
<p>Deciding how to maximize 13
minutes, but also celebrate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this show is going
to be, it&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>celebration of my catalog in the
best way that we could have put</p>
<p>it together.
And you only have 13 minutes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a challenge.
So you are trying to cram 17</p>
<p>years of work into 13 minutes.
So it&rsquo;s &ndash; it&rsquo;s difficult, but</p>
<p>we &ndash; you know, some songs we
have to lose because of that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to be okay.
But I think we did a pretty good</p>
<p>job of narrowing it down.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Was there</p>
<p>trial and error, you know, as
you started rehearsals.</p>
<p>Were you running through set
lists and realizing that this</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work in this moment?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably like 39
versions of the set list right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Wow!</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Yeah.
I think we&rsquo;re on our 39th.</p>
<p>I mean, every little change
counts.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Mm-hmm.
RIHANNA: Whether I want a</p>
<p>guitar cut out, something muted
or something added or just put</p>
<p>in a whole new song or take out
a whole song, like, every time I</p>
<p>make a change, something has to
be updated and that&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>version.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Well, like</p>
<p>you mentioned earlier, there are
a lot of moving parts to the</p>
<p>show, a lot of people involved,
but another thing I always</p>
<p>admired about you.
You seem to know the right</p>
<p>moment to step in and take
control.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s challenging for
women.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always nervous sometimes,
me personally of coming off too</p>
<p>controlling or too bossy, but
sometimes you know in your gut</p>
<p>what the right thing is for you.
So how much have you been really</p>
<p>getting into all of the details
of putting the show together?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: I&rsquo;m &ndash; I&rsquo;m
definitely not one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worried about coming off too
bossy.</p>
<p>I have been bossy all my life.
Ever since I was a little girl,</p>
<p>I promise you this.
Like hell uva annoying, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>writing on me.
There are a lot of people who</p>
<p>are a part of this show, and a
huge part of the reason why this</p>
<p>show is going to be as
incredible as it is.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t have done it
without them.</p>
<p>But, you know what, at the end
of the day, if it flops or it</p>
<p>flies, my name has to stand by
that.</p>
<p>And so I really get involved
with every aspect of anything</p>
<p>that I do, whether it&rsquo;s the
Super Bowl, whether it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>makeup product, whether it&rsquo;s
Savage longer ray.</p>
<p>I want to see the copy on the
website.</p>
<p>I want to name every lipstick
that I make.</p>
<p>Like, I care about it.
I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.
I really do.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: It all goes
back to the little girl, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you, from the report
card.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: The little bossy,
little girl.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Another thing
that goes into such a big</p>
<p>performance is the physical
stamina.</p>
<p>Exhaustion is a real thing,
right?</p>
<p>But then that&rsquo;s something that
you have to deal with and your</p>
<p>breath control and dancing on
stage and all of that,</p>
<p>especially postpartum.
I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Last year after I had my baby,
it took me months to wear</p>
<p>regular pants again.
This is one of those few</p>
<p>occasions.
What is it like physically</p>
<p>getting yourself ready for this?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: The physical</p>
<p>challenge has definitely been
immense, for many reasons, of</p>
<p>course.
But I haven&rsquo;t done this in a</p>
<p>minute.
That was first &ndash; first things</p>
<p>first.
So you are just running around</p>
<p>for 13 minutes trying to put,
like, a two-hour set in 13</p>
<p>minutes.
And you are going to see on</p>
<p>Sunday, it just &ndash; from the time
it starts, it just never &ndash; it</p>
<p>just never ends.
And until it&rsquo;s like the very</p>
<p>last second.
I know I&rsquo;m saying too much, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a jam-packed show and it
takes a toll on your body.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: You got this,</p>
<p>girl!</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Thank you.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: And I won&rsquo;t
press you to reveal any details.</p>
<p>We want to keep that under wraps
because you have been working so</p>
<p>hard.
As a Caribbean woman, and coming</p>
<p>from a tiny island like Grenada,
you made me feel so represented.</p>
<p>I always loved seeing you back
home at Barbados at Crop Over.</p>
<p>I wonder if you are
incorporating any Caribbean</p>
<p>culture in the performance?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: That&rsquo;s a big part</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s important for me to do
this show, representation,</p>
<p>representing for immigrants,
representing for my country,</p>
<p>Barbados.
Representing for Black women</p>
<p>everywhere.
I just &ndash; I think that&rsquo;s &ndash;</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important.
That&rsquo;s key for people to see the</p>
<p>possibilities and I&rsquo;m honored to
be here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored to be doing this
this year.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: I can&rsquo;t wait
to see it!</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re so excited to have you
back in music.</p>
<p>You know, of course we missed
you, but you have a whole human</p>
<p>beings to take care of now.
I know it sounds for you, that</p>
<p>work/life balance was not
necessarily a thing.</p>
<p>You always considered those the
same, but is that different now</p>
<p>having a child plus work?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Yes, it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>different.
The balance is almost impossible</p>
<p>because no matter how you look
at it, work is always something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to rob you of time
with your child.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the currency now.
And that&rsquo;s where it goes, the</p>
<p>magnitude of how much it weighs.
When you make decisions on what</p>
<p>you are going to say yes to, it
has to be worth it.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Mm-hmm.
And this is definitely a moment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worth it for you, right?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: For me, for sure.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: What is the
cultural significance for you of</p>
<p>performing at the Super Bowl
Halftime Show?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: I mean, it&rsquo;s a long
way from home, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long way from home.
It&rsquo;s a beautiful journey that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on, and I could have never
guessed that I would have made</p>
<p>it here.
So it&rsquo;s a celebration of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to do that, and I&rsquo;m
really excited to have Barbados</p>
<p>on the Super Bowl stage.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: It&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>moment for the whole Caribbean.
You have been a global superstar</p>
<p>for a long time, but I need to
say right now on the record,</p>
<p>Caribbean women, we claim you as
ours.</p>
<p>(Laughter).</p>
<p>RIHANNA: You better!</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Now, you have
taken a few years off of music.</p>
<p>You have been building the Fenty
empire, which has been</p>
<p>incredible to watch.
But now that you are making that</p>
<p>transition back to music, you
also took some time to just live</p>
<p>your life, to just take road
trips, like, things that you</p>
<p>deserved after working so hard.
So how was that period and do</p>
<p>you feel now refreshed and ready
to get back to music?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: The pandemic kind
of, in a weird way, forced me to</p>
<p>slow down.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: And then when you
have all of these boundaries and</p>
<p>restraints and rules and you
have to stay home, you kind of</p>
<p>get creative with ways to stay
entertained in a way.</p>
<p>And road tripping was one of
those things that I have always</p>
<p>loved.
I just usually road tripped</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m on tour.
So that&rsquo;s a road trip.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: That doesn&rsquo;t
count.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: So I got to feel the
things that I love about tour</p>
<p>without having the commitment of
the show every single day.</p>
<p>It was just nice to appreciate
that time.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it, actually.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: You deserved</p>
<p>it.
You seemed like a workaholic.</p>
<p>I think you deserved some time
off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking any questions
about when music is dropping.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any problems with
you or the Navy.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, you said
you were working on a project</p>
<p>that was reggae inspired, and
those are your roots and</p>
<p>something that would capture
where you are going forward in</p>
<p>the next chapter of your life.
When I talk with my friends, we</p>
<p>would take anything.
A classical album from Rihanna,</p>
<p>would be fire.
Would you tell us about this</p>
<p>chapter and how you are feeling
musically in general.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Musically, I&rsquo;m
feeling open.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling open to exploring,
discovering, creating, things</p>
<p>that are new, things that are
different, things that are</p>
<p>offer, weird, might not ever,
like, make sense to my fans, you</p>
<p>know, the people that know the
music that I put out.</p>
<p>I just want to play.
I want to have fun.</p>
<p>I want to have fun with music.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: You should</p>
<p>have fun with the music and have
fun on that Super Bowl stage on</p>
<p>Sunday.
You put in all of the work.</p>
<p>You are ready.
This is in your bones.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Thank you.
NADESKA ALEXIS: It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to go out and have a
good time.</p>
<p>Promise me you will have fun.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: I got you, girl.</p>
<p>I promise.
That&rsquo;s one of my main things, I</p>
<p>promised myself I would have
fun.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: That&rsquo;s great.
And now if it&rsquo;s cool with you,</p>
<p>some of your young fans have
some questions for you, if you</p>
<p>are cool to answer those.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Of course!</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: All right.
Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>First question is from Phoenix
Children&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Hi, Rihanna, I&rsquo;m in Phoenix
Children&rsquo;s Hospital and I like</p>
<p>dancing and playing golf and I
also love your makeup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>What was your favorite album to
record?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Oh!
RIHANNA: I was on the road</p>
<p>when I made both of next.
Was touring one album and making</p>
<p>the N. and then I came back and
toured that album and made the</p>
<p>next and then &ldquo;Anti&rdquo; was first
time I took my time making an</p>
<p>album, while not being on tour,
and that frustrated my fans a</p>
<p>bit and here I am doing it again
to them.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;Anti&rdquo; for sure, top
favorite album I ever made.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: A great
album.</p>
<p>Thank you, Annissa.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Thank you.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: And we have a
question from NFL Play 60 super</p>
<p>kid.</p>
<p>When you first started</p>
<p>pursuing music, what was the
most important thing you learned</p>
<p>in order to succeed in the
industry?</p>
<p>RIHANNA: To stay humble.
Stay humble, because if not,</p>
<p>this industry will humble you
one way or the other.</p>
<p>And, you know, my humility came
from my childhood growing up in</p>
<p>the Caribbean and growing up in
my household with my mom.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a very humble woman.
Her mom was a very humble woman,</p>
<p>and I have never lost sight of
that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very important to me.
I &ndash; I often fear the pedestal</p>
<p>that the world can put you on,
and I always want to feel my</p>
<p>feet on the ground.
That makes me feel safe.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Thank you.
That was such a great question.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: That was a great
question!</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Yes, and a
great answer and that&rsquo;s why we</p>
<p>appreciate you.
You always seem to grounded, no</p>
<p>matter what is going on around
you.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Thank you.
NADESKA ALEXIS: You will</p>
<p>never lose that magic.
Thank you so much again.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Thank you.
NADESKA ALEXIS: Congratulatio</p>
<p>ns.</p>
<p>RIHANNA: Thank you all.</p>
<p>NADESKA ALEXIS: Have an
incredible time.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to see the Apple
Music music Halftime Show and</p>
<p>while you wait, you can listen,
watch and sing all things</p>
<p>Rihanna.
And shortly after her</p>
<p>performance, you&rsquo;ll be able to
stream the full Halftime Show in</p>
<p>Spatial Audio only on Apple
Music.</p>
<p>But before Rihanna takes the
biggest stage in the world, we</p>
<p>want to share a film that takes
it back to where everything</p>
<p>started.
Premiering today, here is &ldquo;Run</p>
<p>This Town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s about time she</p>
<p>come back.</p>
<p>You know fans are waiting.</p>
<p>‚ô™ Feel it coming in the air ‚ô™
‚ô™ Hear the screams from</p>
<p>everywhere ‚ô™
‚ô™ I&rsquo;m addicted to the thrill ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ It&rsquo;s a dangerous love affair ‚ô™
‚ô™ Can&rsquo;t be scared when it goes</p>
<p>down ‚ô™
‚ô™ Got a problem, tell me now ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Only thing that&rsquo;s on my mind ‚ô™
‚ô™ Is who&rsquo;s gonna run this town</p>
<p>tonight ‚ô™
‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Is who&rsquo;s gonna run this town
tonight ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ We gonna run this town ‚ô™
‚ô™ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Hey, hey, hey, hey ‚ô™
‚ô™ Whassup ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Hey, hey, hey, hey ‚ô™
‚ô™ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ We gonna run this town
tonight ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ We&rsquo;re gonna run this town
tonight ‚ô™</p>
