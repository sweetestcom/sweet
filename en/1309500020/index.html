<p>crime and you like makeup i would</p>
<p>definitely suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>warning the following presentation is intended for</p>
<p>mature audiences</p>
<p>it contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of crime scenes</p>
<p>adult dialogue</p>
<p>and strong language</p>
<p>viewer discretion is advised</p>
<p>a lot of the</p>
<p>times you guys ask me bailey bailey bailey bailey</p>
<p>bailey are there any cases that really bother you</p>
<p>this story but this one is just</p>
<p>today i am going to talk about gary hyde nick</p>
<p>are you familiar</p>
<p>with this piece of crap</p>
<p>anyways i will shut up and just let&rsquo;s get into it okay</p>
<p>so gary hide nick</p>
<p>he was born in november of nineteen forty three</p>
<p>he was the oldest of two children raised by michael and</p>
<p>ellen hide nick his parents</p>
<p>but the kids weren&rsquo;t raised</p>
<p>in the home with both of their parents michael and</p>
<p>ellen divorced by the time gary was only</p>
<p>three years old</p>
<p>gary and his younger brother were raised by his</p>
<p>mother ellen</p>
<p>for about four years and then their father michael for</p>
<p>about seven years and then gary was sent to</p>
<p>a military academy</p>
<p>for about two years</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>hard upbringing i mean</p>
<p>kind of going back and forth between homes</p>
<p>gary claimed that he suffered a lot of emotional</p>
<p>abuse by his father</p>
<p>specifically due to his bed wetting</p>
<p>whatever reason gary continued to wet the bed for years</p>
<p>and years after moving in with his father</p>
<p>and according to gary it</p>
<p>would send his father into just</p>
<p>he was beyond livid he was so enraged so</p>
<p>pissed at gary for wetting his his sheets</p>
<p>that he would force gary</p>
<p>to take his sheets that he wet</p>
<p>and he would hang them outside</p>
<p>for all of the neighbors to see</p>
<p>so it was like a form of punishment but also</p>
<p>supposed to be like embarrassing to gary</p>
<p>so i guess he would stop wetting the bed</p>
<p>according to gary&rsquo;s father he&rsquo;s no longer</p>
<p>alive but when he was</p>
<p>alive gary&rsquo;s father heavily denied any type of abuse</p>
<p>going on so then gary was sent to military</p>
<p>school which was probably somewhat</p>
<p>nice compared to his home life because of how like</p>
<p>toxic it was</p>
<p>and in military</p>
<p>school they tested</p>
<p>gary&rsquo;s iq which was</p>
<p>between 130 and 148</p>
<p>so he was pretty</p>
<p>smart little cookie</p>
<p>and then in the army gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drill sergeant</p>
<p>rated him as</p>
<p>excellent and he was very</p>
<p>successful at</p>
<p>his training he was then</p>
<p>trained successfully as a</p>
<p>medic in texas</p>
<p>and was transferred to germany</p>
<p>where he served at the 46th army surgical hospital</p>
<p>everything seemed to be</p>
<p>going really well for gary like</p>
<p>doing really well</p>
<p>since going to military</p>
<p>school and in the army</p>
<p>and then things just</p>
<p>started to go downhill for gary</p>
<p>he began to feel really unwell</p>
<p>gary would call in sick to work complaining of nausea</p>
<p>headaches blurred vision and dizziness</p>
<p>not much is known</p>
<p>about gary&rsquo;s mental</p>
<p>state at this time</p>
<p>but by the time he saw a doctor</p>
<p>he was thought to have a full</p>
<p>blown mental illness and was prescribed anti</p>
<p>psychotic on drugs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little unclear as</p>
<p>to like how it went from feeling nauseous and dizzy to</p>
<p>a serious mental illness but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really not much i</p>
<p>could find about it</p>
<p>it was just kind of like oh yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dizzy nauseous</p>
<p>and then it was like mental illness i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i was confused on that part but</p>
<p>it is what it is</p>
<p>so once gary was prescribed</p>
<p>these anti psychotic</p>
<p>prescriptions i should say</p>
<p>he was then discharged from the military with</p>
<p>a full disability</p>
<p>pension and then</p>
<p>shortly after his</p>
<p>honorable discharge</p>
<p>gary went on to become a</p>
<p>licensed practical</p>
<p>nurse and he even worked at a va</p>
<p>psych hospital for a time before</p>
<p>being fired</p>
<p>and he got fired</p>
<p>because he had rude behavior</p>
<p>towards his patients</p>
<p>he was snapping and</p>
<p>he just he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doing a good job</p>
<p>so from 1962 to around 1987</p>
<p>gary spent majority of his time</p>
<p>in and out of</p>
<p>psychiatric hospitals</p>
<p>but this time he wasn&rsquo;t working he</p>
<p>was actually a patient himself he was prone to extreme</p>
<p>bouts of depression with</p>
<p>multiple suicide attempts</p>
<p>and it seemed</p>
<p>like depression</p>
<p>had run in the</p>
<p>hide nick family his</p>
<p>mother his brother i</p>
<p>think his father all had</p>
<p>struggled with</p>
<p>depression and all</p>
<p>tried to commit suicide at some</p>
<p>point which is</p>
<p>just awful in 1970 gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother she ended up committing suicide by</p>
<p>drinking mercuric</p>
<p>chloride i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>laughing because once</p>
<p>again i can&rsquo;t pronounce words we know this</p>
<p>right we know this by now</p>
<p>i have a speech impediment</p>
<p>okay and my mouth</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t move in certain ways it&rsquo;s very frustrating</p>
<p>but yes she made this poison mixture</p>
<p>she went down into like the basement she</p>
<p>drank it and then she died</p>
<p>things that i read</p>
<p>said that ellen the mother</p>
<p>she was in an abusive relationship and she wanted out</p>
<p>and she felt like the only way she</p>
<p>could get out was if she</p>
<p>killed herself</p>
<p>sadly so she</p>
<p>drank this poison</p>
<p>and ended it unclear</p>
<p>if gary was really</p>
<p>close with her at this</p>
<p>point but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s still here</p>
<p>her family so i&rsquo;m sure it still</p>
<p>is hard so then</p>
<p>later on gary went on to</p>
<p>marry and have children with several</p>
<p>women however the</p>
<p>relationships were</p>
<p>far from normal the first</p>
<p>marriage was to a woman</p>
<p>named betty some</p>
<p>reports say it was</p>
<p>she was a mail</p>
<p>order bride</p>
<p>she came from the philippines</p>
<p>how they met</p>
<p>not really sure but they were like writing letters</p>
<p>back and forth she really knew nothing about him</p>
<p>she came to the us from the philippines</p>
<p>they got married sadly she</p>
<p>entered into this very abusive relationship from gary</p>
<p>he would force</p>
<p>betty to watch as he had sex with</p>
<p>other women</p>
<p>and he repeatedly</p>
<p>would rape and assault her</p>
<p>numerous times until she</p>
<p>was able to escape</p>
<p>and she fleed back home to your country</p>
<p>at that time</p>
<p>when she fleed back home she was pregnant with his</p>
<p>child and this really</p>
<p>upset him so then gary had another</p>
<p>child with a woman</p>
<p>named an jeanette</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>mentally disabled</p>
<p>she had an iq of only forty</p>
<p>eight so she</p>
<p>was mentally disabled and he took advantage of her</p>
<p>um he got her pregnant and the</p>
<p>child was immediately</p>
<p>taken away they</p>
<p>found that she was too</p>
<p>unfit to take care of the</p>
<p>child so an</p>
<p>jeanette was more than just like a</p>
<p>sexual conquest for gary</p>
<p>she was his official</p>
<p>transition into the</p>
<p>crimes that would</p>
<p>becoming he liked the idea</p>
<p>of how he could control her because</p>
<p>she couldn&rsquo;t think for herself poor</p>
<p>thing so an jeanette gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>girlfriend at the time had a</p>
<p>sister and she was staying in a mental hospital</p>
<p>or institution and in 1978 he signed</p>
<p>his girlfriend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sister out of the mental institution</p>
<p>where she was living</p>
<p>she was brought back to the home</p>
<p>where gary and an jeanette</p>
<p>were living now gary decided to just keep her here the</p>
<p>sister for 10 days and he repeatedly raped</p>
<p>sodomized and tortured her now an</p>
<p>jeanette didn&rsquo;t like do anything because again she was</p>
<p>mentally ill</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t like fully</p>
<p>aware what was happening</p>
<p>or even like how to approach the situation and her</p>
<p>sister was the same way police went looking for</p>
<p>the sister because she was signed</p>
<p>out of this mental institution it was like a day pass</p>
<p>so you could take her for a couple of hours</p>
<p>normal ass people</p>
<p>would go out for</p>
<p>lunch or something</p>
<p>and he had her for 10 days so</p>
<p>the police were called</p>
<p>police went looking for her</p>
<p>gary was the</p>
<p>one that signed her out so of course they went to</p>
<p>his house and when police finally</p>
<p>found her she was</p>
<p>covered in blood and she was just</p>
<p>completely terrified and she was hiding in the basement</p>
<p>gary was charged with kidnapping rape</p>
<p>unlawful restraint</p>
<p>false imprisonment involuntary deviant</p>
<p>sexual and intercourse</p>
<p>and interfering with the custody</p>
<p>of a committed person</p>
<p>now when i read that i was like oh shit yeah he</p>
<p>would be locked up forever</p>
<p>right cause that&rsquo;s a long list of like some</p>
<p>effed up schismitz</p>
<p>nene of course</p>
<p>not gary&rsquo;s original sentence was overturned on appeal</p>
<p>and gary spent only</p>
<p>three years of his incarceration in mental institutions</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>so then in nineteen</p>
<p>seventy one gary was out</p>
<p>right and he moved</p>
<p>he moved to philadelphia</p>
<p>and while in philadelphia</p>
<p>gary was like you know what i</p>
<p>gotta like do something</p>
<p>right he really liked</p>
<p>controlling people</p>
<p>he was like i&rsquo;m kind of good at it</p>
<p>i should like</p>
<p>stick with that</p>
<p>so in 1971 gary</p>
<p>started the united church of</p>
<p>the ministers of god i have to add a side note because</p>
<p>i guess cause</p>
<p>i was kind of like looking up united church of</p>
<p>the ministers of god</p>
<p>which is quite a name</p>
<p>but i guess it&rsquo;s like an</p>
<p>actual church</p>
<p>right this is a</p>
<p>legit church</p>
<p>where people do</p>
<p>great things for one another it has</p>
<p>great community whatever</p>
<p>now gary took this</p>
<p>name and kind of created his own church so</p>
<p>if you see a church and it&rsquo;s called tonight church</p>
<p>of the ministers of god it has nothing to do with</p>
<p>gary he considered it to be a church and</p>
<p>and at first he had</p>
<p>about five followers</p>
<p>and a fifteen hundred dollar investment</p>
<p>who he got the investment from</p>
<p>no idea i have no idea</p>
<p>but he got it</p>
<p>things grew</p>
<p>pretty quickly for gary gary</p>
<p>ended up raising</p>
<p>about almost um</p>
<p>five hundred thousand dollars for his church</p>
<p>slash cult i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna call it what it is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>churches are cults</p>
<p>but what gary was doing</p>
<p>was essentially a cult</p>
<p>so he raised up</p>
<p>about five hundred thousand dollars from</p>
<p>people donating</p>
<p>their money</p>
<p>and at this time he seemed</p>
<p>to really master and</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>manipulate people</p>
<p>so according</p>
<p>to gary&rsquo;s neighbors the members of this colt</p>
<p>church they showed up</p>
<p>every sunday</p>
<p>for service inside of gary&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>and this is a quote from</p>
<p>the neighbor</p>
<p>in an interview they went on to say that everybody who</p>
<p>attended this</p>
<p>church they were usually</p>
<p>mentally ill</p>
<p>really sad okay</p>
<p>so gary did keep this church</p>
<p>cult thing going for</p>
<p>until he gets arrested</p>
<p>but he still like wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fully satisfied he wanted</p>
<p>those sexual</p>
<p>partners but non consenting partners he wanted that</p>
<p>again he wanted</p>
<p>new sex victims</p>
<p>but this time he wanted you know to not get caught</p>
<p>so gary went out</p>
<p>and in the area</p>
<p>where he lived there were a lot of sex workers</p>
<p>and he comes across this</p>
<p>woman named josefina</p>
<p>rivera and she was 25 at the time</p>
<p>she was heavily</p>
<p>addicted to drugs she was working as a sex worker for</p>
<p>quite some time</p>
<p>she had children as well but they were</p>
<p>taken into foster care i believe</p>
<p>because of her drug</p>
<p>abuse sadly</p>
<p>these are things that she she says</p>
<p>he lures her into his car by the promise of</p>
<p>money in exchange for sex</p>
<p>so while josephina was getting redressed</p>
<p>after doing whatever they did</p>
<p>sex i&rsquo;m assuming gary came up and choked her</p>
<p>until she passed out he then takes her back to his home</p>
<p>dragged her down to his basement</p>
<p>shackled her limbs together with</p>
<p>chains he sealed the bolts with super glue</p>
<p>so she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>escape now at this time you know</p>
<p>of course naturally</p>
<p>like any of us would</p>
<p>josephino was like</p>
<p>screaming just being very very loud</p>
<p>hoping somebody hears her</p>
<p>but this obviously pisses</p>
<p>gary off so then he just like</p>
<p>beats her with a stick</p>
<p>until she stops</p>
<p>screaming for help now gary had built this</p>
<p>thing in his basement or like</p>
<p>dug it up it was called like a pit</p>
<p>a big hole in the ground</p>
<p>and his thought process was he was</p>
<p>gonna put people in</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>board them up in these pits</p>
<p>so he had built</p>
<p>this pit already and he put josephina into</p>
<p>the pit or a pit</p>
<p>cause he had multiple</p>
<p>boarded it up and sealed her in there</p>
<p>so josephina was locked up there</p>
<p>for about three days</p>
<p>and then gary</p>
<p>shows up with another</p>
<p>woman named</p>
<p>sandra and she was 24</p>
<p>it was obvious</p>
<p>to josefina that she</p>
<p>sandra was mentally disabled</p>
<p>josefina asked</p>
<p>sandra like how did you get here</p>
<p>how did he get you</p>
<p>sandra said that she was</p>
<p>on a walk to the local</p>
<p>store like she wasn&rsquo;t even that far from her home</p>
<p>when gary had offered her a ride</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>knocked her out and took her back to his home</p>
<p>so same thing gary took</p>
<p>sandra and he</p>
<p>chained her</p>
<p>in the same fashion as</p>
<p>josephina and then disgustingly he</p>
<p>would force</p>
<p>the other women to</p>
<p>watch as he raped</p>
<p>each other how</p>
<p>awful how awful</p>
<p>this is a lot of our fears like</p>
<p>on new year&rsquo;s day in 1987</p>
<p>deborah was brought into the basement</p>
<p>now later it</p>
<p>would be said that</p>
<p>debra was more feisty</p>
<p>like she was confrontational</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t afraid to</p>
<p>stand up to gary and like</p>
<p>spit in his face and</p>
<p>stuff like he deserved</p>
<p>and she would yell at gary she needed tampons</p>
<p>she needed a shower</p>
<p>but she wasn&rsquo;t afraid of gary</p>
<p>and she was very confrontational</p>
<p>this forced gary to</p>
<p>make some changes so</p>
<p>he ended up purchasing a</p>
<p>portable toilet for the</p>
<p>women because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have one he also finally gave the</p>
<p>women tampons because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>since being in there</p>
<p>none of the girls had</p>
<p>taken a bath</p>
<p>he allowed them now to bathe</p>
<p>josephina she would</p>
<p>later say that</p>
<p>gary was very unpredictable</p>
<p>and you never knew what to</p>
<p>expect when he came down</p>
<p>the stairs one day</p>
<p>after gary realized that the girls</p>
<p>could hear him coming and</p>
<p>going out the front door</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t like that because he knew</p>
<p>like as soon as</p>
<p>if they knew that he left they</p>
<p>would be really loud and they</p>
<p>would try to escape</p>
<p>so gary decided</p>
<p>to this part is horrifying</p>
<p>but he well all of it is shut up bailey</p>
<p>he shoved screwdrivers into</p>
<p>their ears and punctured</p>
<p>their eardrums so they couldn&rsquo;t hear him anymore</p>
<p>so to the girls disobeying</p>
<p>gary was very dangerous</p>
<p>and they quickly</p>
<p>learned that</p>
<p>if you spoke back he would</p>
<p>beat them he</p>
<p>would rape them he was just</p>
<p>awful he was</p>
<p>disgusting and</p>
<p>they knew like to follow the rules or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna pay the</p>
<p>price gary would put them on punishment if they decided</p>
<p>to disobey him</p>
<p>which meant that they</p>
<p>would be starved</p>
<p>beaten and tortured</p>
<p>so january 18th 1987</p>
<p>there was one more</p>
<p>victim that was now</p>
<p>added to the mix that gary somehow got</p>
<p>her name was jacqueline</p>
<p>when she was 18 years old</p>
<p>and it seemed like at this point gary</p>
<p>was a little content</p>
<p>with the amount of girls he had in the basement</p>
<p>but then sandra</p>
<p>somehow disobeyed him</p>
<p>not sure what</p>
<p>she did but she disobeyed him as punishment he then put</p>
<p>sandra into the pit</p>
<p>which was like this hole in the ground</p>
<p>right and he</p>
<p>boarded her up</p>
<p>while gary was</p>
<p>like upstairs doing whatever</p>
<p>she tried to crawl</p>
<p>out of the pit that</p>
<p>gary had dug so since</p>
<p>sandra was disobeying him he then took</p>
<p>sandra and he</p>
<p>got her by her</p>
<p>wrist and hung her from</p>
<p>like a beam that was across the wall with handcuffs</p>
<p>and he then</p>
<p>starved her for days as part of her</p>
<p>punishment sandra was</p>
<p>bound by her</p>
<p>wrist like hanging from this beam but she was</p>
<p>standing if that makes</p>
<p>sense like her feet were still</p>
<p>barely on the ground when she was hanging</p>
<p>and she was left like this</p>
<p>for a week all the</p>
<p>other ladies in that basement were also</p>
<p>um bound and like</p>
<p>chained and</p>
<p>stuff so they couldn&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>her or like help her get down at all finally gary went</p>
<p>downstairs to take her off punishment i</p>
<p>guess he then was</p>
<p>going to give her food and finally</p>
<p>unchain her</p>
<p>so he takes her</p>
<p>down from this beam and</p>
<p>sadly she just like</p>
<p>fell to the</p>
<p>floor she was dead</p>
<p>once gary realized that</p>
<p>sandra was dead</p>
<p>he knew he couldn&rsquo;t just dump a body</p>
<p>like he would get caught so he brought</p>
<p>sandra&rsquo;s body upstairs</p>
<p>and he decided</p>
<p>that he needed to dismember</p>
<p>her body i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>clear as far as</p>
<p>which girls</p>
<p>it was from downstairs but he brought them upstairs</p>
<p>to help him dismember</p>
<p>sandra&rsquo;s body and he</p>
<p>convinced the girls that if the police came</p>
<p>saw that sandra was dead</p>
<p>that the girls</p>
<p>would be in</p>
<p>trouble too because they were</p>
<p>an accomplice</p>
<p>to gary&rsquo;s crime they</p>
<p>followed what gary had said and</p>
<p>they helped dismember</p>
<p>sandra&rsquo;s body gary used like a power saw</p>
<p>dismembered her like awful</p>
<p>he then took</p>
<p>sandra her dismembered body now</p>
<p>and he cooked her ribs in the oven</p>
<p>and then he boiled her head on the</p>
<p>stove now at this</p>
<p>point neighbors had complained that</p>
<p>there was a funky</p>
<p>smell coming from his</p>
<p>place they ended up calling police</p>
<p>police go by to gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house now i&rsquo;m not sure if they</p>
<p>smelled anything or what because police just go by the</p>
<p>house they ask gary like hey what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>your neighbors are complaining that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funky smell</p>
<p>and gary says oh i just i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i accidentally burnt a roast</p>
<p>and the police are just like okay well you know just</p>
<p>keep down the</p>
<p>smell and then they</p>
<p>leave so i&rsquo;m not sure like how did they not</p>
<p>smell it i mean according to</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>documentary you</p>
<p>watch your true</p>
<p>crime whatever they always say the</p>
<p>smell of a dead body is like so distinct and so</p>
<p>strong i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i guess i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>expecting too much</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just frustrating because like</p>
<p>they were so</p>
<p>close so once like</p>
<p>he convinces the police that he&rsquo;s just burning a roast</p>
<p>gary then goes back to his</p>
<p>cooking he then grounds</p>
<p>sandra&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>like all the meat up and he fed</p>
<p>pieces of sandra</p>
<p>to his dog he then mixes some of</p>
<p>sandra&rsquo;s body up with dog food he mixes it together</p>
<p>and then he fed</p>
<p>it to all of his captives that are down in the cellar</p>
<p>so one of the</p>
<p>other captives debra</p>
<p>she was punished and i</p>
<p>guess he would do this</p>
<p>with the other girls as well and he would</p>
<p>electrocute them</p>
<p>and he would create</p>
<p>in the pit that he dug up he would put</p>
<p>water in the pit</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would have the girls like sit in the</p>
<p>water and he would</p>
<p>electrocute them so he</p>
<p>would put like some kind of wire in the water</p>
<p>and it would</p>
<p>electrocute them</p>
<p>so deborah wasn&rsquo;t following the rules</p>
<p>he puts her into the pit</p>
<p>of water and then he</p>
<p>electrocutes her</p>
<p>sadly deborah</p>
<p>died so when deborah</p>
<p>died instead of dismembering her like he did</p>
<p>previously he</p>
<p>ended up just taking her body and</p>
<p>dumping it somewhere in</p>
<p>somewhere not that far away but he</p>
<p>yeah this compelled gary</p>
<p>to abduct another victim</p>
<p>and her name was agnes</p>
<p>and gary was familiar with agnes already</p>
<p>because she was a sex worker that he had hired before</p>
<p>so he picked up this new</p>
<p>victim and same</p>
<p>thing he brought her down there</p>
<p>chained her</p>
<p>now remember how i said gary had ran that church</p>
<p>i guess the church thing was</p>
<p>still going on</p>
<p>right and it was</p>
<p>going on up in gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>home they were down pretty far in his basement when</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>would come over for</p>
<p>their sunday service</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t hear anything</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unclear if any of the people who were</p>
<p>attending the</p>
<p>sunday service if</p>
<p>any of them were in on it as well they&rsquo;re not sure</p>
<p>about that but a lot of them were</p>
<p>mentally ill themselves so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to say</p>
<p>gary had expressed to his</p>
<p>victims that he wanted kids</p>
<p>and that his</p>
<p>goal was to get 10 girls down into his cellar</p>
<p>but he also wanted to get them all pregnant</p>
<p>and he wanted to have what he called</p>
<p>a baby farm</p>
<p>in his cellar</p>
<p>but at this</p>
<p>point one of gary&rsquo;s victims</p>
<p>started to figure him out like gary she was clever</p>
<p>she was a quick</p>
<p>judge of character</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>just motivated</p>
<p>by her goal</p>
<p>to get the f</p>
<p>out of there and</p>
<p>based on gary&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>patterns josefina</p>
<p>began to realize that gary had a desire for true</p>
<p>connection and he was just</p>
<p>like he was just lonely</p>
<p>he seemed to like</p>
<p>really want children and he just kind of wanted like a</p>
<p>sense of family like this is what josefina</p>
<p>the victim is noticing</p>
<p>so josefina had like a new goal okay she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stuck down here</p>
<p>she figured</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s obviously not just</p>
<p>gonna like let us go like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s realized that no matter how much she cries</p>
<p>screams there he&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>gonna let anybody go</p>
<p>so she needed a new plan</p>
<p>and josephina set out to befriend</p>
<p>and she needed</p>
<p>to convince him</p>
<p>that she was on his side</p>
<p>so she just did as he wished</p>
<p>she professed her</p>
<p>understanding whenever she had a chance eventually</p>
<p>gary allowed her to go upstairs and cook for him</p>
<p>and watch movies together before</p>
<p>chaining her back in the basement</p>
<p>so it was working it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quick it was taking some time this is</p>
<p>over like a period of time she just needed to convince</p>
<p>gary that she was there</p>
<p>to help him</p>
<p>and she was on his side like that was her goal</p>
<p>so then gary made josefina</p>
<p>fina the boss of the</p>
<p>other women</p>
<p>and it was gary&rsquo;s way of pitting the</p>
<p>women against</p>
<p>one another</p>
<p>if josefina did what he said</p>
<p>he would bring her hot chocolate</p>
<p>hot dogs and he</p>
<p>would let her</p>
<p>sleep outside of the hole</p>
<p>the dug up area gary</p>
<p>then decided to use josefina to lure in new victims</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>if she was successful at doing that or not but</p>
<p>he and josefina did say that that&rsquo;s what she was</p>
<p>doing like she was helping him</p>
<p>essentially so</p>
<p>could have josefina</p>
<p>escape during</p>
<p>those times when gary had allowed her up the stairs</p>
<p>probably maybe yes</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what</p>
<p>she did because</p>
<p>her goal wasn&rsquo;t to save herself it was to save</p>
<p>all of the women</p>
<p>that were trapped in that house</p>
<p>and josephina knew that if she</p>
<p>escaped and gary was there he</p>
<p>would immediately</p>
<p>kill the other women</p>
<p>because most likely she was</p>
<p>gonna go tell</p>
<p>somebody and they were</p>
<p>gonna come in the</p>
<p>house and he needed to get rid of all</p>
<p>these ladies</p>
<p>and she just felt like she couldn&rsquo;t take that risk</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>she just kind of went</p>
<p>along with it so</p>
<p>after some time josefina</p>
<p>convinced gary to take her to her family&rsquo;s house and</p>
<p>to say goodbye because</p>
<p>she was now</p>
<p>gonna be staying with gary forever</p>
<p>have their baby farm whatever</p>
<p>right this is what she convinced gary of</p>
<p>gary agrees to</p>
<p>take josefina back into the city</p>
<p>to let her say goodbye to her family</p>
<p>and gary then</p>
<p>decides to park at a gas station that was several</p>
<p>blocks from her home</p>
<p>she told him</p>
<p>not to pull up in</p>
<p>front of the home in case family members</p>
<p>identified the car and like called the cops</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what she told him so she&rsquo;s like park here</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;ll just walk</p>
<p>quickly over there say goodbye</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;ll come back gary</p>
<p>told josefina that she had 15 minutes or he was gonna</p>
<p>do something so josefina gets out of the car</p>
<p>and she walked calmly</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be right back playing it calm</p>
<p>and then she walks like around this corner and as soon</p>
<p>as she was out of gary&rsquo;s site she ran to the nearest</p>
<p>phone booth and called nine one</p>
<p>one luckily a</p>
<p>squad car was nearby</p>
<p>and she was able to convince</p>
<p>the officers that if they allowed gary to go home</p>
<p>the other girls would</p>
<p>most likely die on</p>
<p>march twenty fourth</p>
<p>nineteen eighty seven</p>
<p>gary was arrested in his</p>
<p>vehicle at the gas station where he</p>
<p>sat waiting for josefina</p>
<p>some say he went home</p>
<p>and then he was arrested</p>
<p>and then some reports</p>
<p>say he was at the gas station and was arrested so</p>
<p>not fully clear on that but he</p>
<p>was arrested</p>
<p>police then went into gary&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>and a lot of them were just</p>
<p>sick because the smell the</p>
<p>house was disgusting but they went down to the basement</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>able to save</p>
<p>lisa who was 19</p>
<p>jacqueline who was 18</p>
<p>agnes who was 24</p>
<p>and at that</p>
<p>point they had been in four</p>
<p>months of imprisonment</p>
<p>and torture</p>
<p>these women were finally</p>
<p>free thank god</p>
<p>josephina oh</p>
<p>thank god for her so gary was arrested and he</p>
<p>was attempting to get off on an insanity defense</p>
<p>but he was convicted</p>
<p>in july of 1988</p>
<p>and he was sentenced to death</p>
<p>he tried to kill himself the following january</p>
<p>and his family</p>
<p>tried to get him off of</p>
<p>death row in 1997</p>
<p>but that it just didn&rsquo;t work out for him</p>
<p>and then on july 6 1999</p>
<p>gary was executed by lethal injection</p>
<p>as for gary&rsquo;s cult</p>
<p>slash church</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to say how much they knew</p>
<p>or if they knew anything at all</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t imagine that they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>as far as the</p>
<p>victims go josefina has been the most</p>
<p>vocal and open</p>
<p>about her experience</p>
<p>throughout the</p>
<p>trial and for years</p>
<p>afterwards josephina was</p>
<p>painted by the</p>
<p>press as gary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actual accomplice</p>
<p>which was infuriating</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>and the media believed</p>
<p>that josephina</p>
<p>was indeed like helping gary</p>
<p>was his partner that she</p>
<p>should be in prison</p>
<p>when i read that i was like</p>
<p>what and the way the</p>
<p>media had played</p>
<p>it they made it seem like she was indeed</p>
<p>helping him out but josephina</p>
<p>stood by the fact that no i did what i had to do so i</p>
<p>could get out of there</p>
<p>i hate people</p>
<p>this poor woman</p>
<p>had just been held captive</p>
<p>and raped and tortured</p>
<p>she finally is free</p>
<p>and people are like oh</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re actually the bad guy</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>so a lot of people were just</p>
<p>against her and did not believe that she was an actual</p>
<p>victim oh my god she ended up</p>
<p>having to give</p>
<p>up her two youngest children for adoption</p>
<p>when she came out of the cellar</p>
<p>because she wasn&rsquo;t capable of caring for them</p>
<p>afterwards when she was free</p>
<p>sadly she picked up her drug habit</p>
<p>again for a number of years to cope with the ongoing</p>
<p>trauma and then finally in</p>
<p>2010 she says that she found the</p>
<p>right therapy</p>
<p>she was sober she was</p>
<p>clean she was reunited with her children</p>
<p>the latest article i</p>
<p>found was in</p>
<p>2013 and she was a</p>
<p>grandmother of six</p>
<p>she said she had</p>
<p>found peace</p>
<p>she married her long</p>
<p>term partner</p>
<p>josefina did</p>
<p>write a book</p>
<p>about her ordeal</p>
<p>she says she has been</p>
<p>clean for a number of years</p>
<p>she does say that she struggles with</p>
<p>nightmares and it&rsquo;s a constant struggle to deal with</p>
<p>again this was back in 2013</p>
<p>said she was living by the beach</p>
<p>with her partner</p>
<p>and she said</p>
<p>since living by the sea she felt</p>
<p>at peace she felt</p>
<p>safe and she felt free</p>
<p>this story makes me tear up</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cry don&rsquo;t cry joseph</p>
<p>is so strong</p>
<p>well all of them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sad when these</p>
<p>victims are set free there&rsquo;s no like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to set them up with like therapy and</p>
<p>like help they just set him free okay you&rsquo;re good to go</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re supposed to just go into normal life</p>
<p>like nothing happened like can we get some help for</p>
<p>these victims</p>
<p>sadly two of the women</p>
<p>their lives were lost by this</p>
<p>awful man and</p>
<p>just like i</p>
<p>would love to know your guys'</p>
<p>thoughts down below</p>
<p>thank you guys so much for hanging out with me</p>
