    <p>The real foundation of Marx&rsquo;s political philosophy was the economic argument that there would</p>
<p>be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and that tendency for the rate of profit to</p>
<p>fall would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder, paying them less than their</p>
<p>subsistence, a revolt by workers against this, and then you would get socialism on</p>
<p>the other side.</p>
<p>So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role in</p>
<p>his explanation of why socialism would have to come about.</p>
<p>If you look at Marx&rsquo;s own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen in England.</p>
<p>The advanced economies would be first to go through the revolution.</p>
<p>The socialist, the primitive economies would have to go through a capitalist transition,</p>
<p>and this is the difference between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>So the Mensheviks, when Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family, the Mensheviks</p>
<p>believed you had to go through a capitalist phase.</p>
<p>Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it becomes socialist.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Steve Keen, a brilliant economist that criticizes</p>
<p>much of modern economics and proposes new theories and models that integrate some ideas</p>
<p>and ditch others from very thinkers, from Karl Marx to John Maynard Keynes to Hyman</p>
<p>Minsky.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of our conversation is about Karl Marx and Marxian economics.</p>
<p>He has been a scholar of Karl Marx&rsquo;s work for many years, so this was a fascinating</p>
<p>exploration.</p>
<p>He has written several books I recommend, including The New Economics and Manifesto</p>
<p>and Debunking Economics.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Steve Keen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a big question.</p>
<p>What is economics?</p>
<p>Or maybe what is or should be the goal of economics?</p>
<p>Well, it should be I understand how human civilization comes about and how it can be</p>
<p>maintained.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s been at all.</p>
<p>So we have a discipline which has the right name and the wrong soul.</p>
<p>What is the soul of economics?</p>
<p>The soul of economics really is to explain how do we manage to build a civilization that</p>
<p>elevates us so far above the energy and consumption and knowledge levels of the base environment</p>
<p>of the Earth?</p>
<p>Because if you think about‚Äîand this is actually work I&rsquo;ve learned from Tim Garrett, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of my research colleagues who&rsquo;s an atmospheric physicist‚Äîand his idea is that we exploit</p>
<p>these high grade energy sources from the sun itself to coal, nuclear, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>which means we can maintain a level of human civilization well above what we&rsquo;d have if</p>
<p>we were just still running around with rocks and stones and spears.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that elevation above the base level of the planet, which is human civilization.</p>
<p>And if we didn&rsquo;t have this energy we were exploiting, if we didn&rsquo;t use the environment</p>
<p>to elevate ourselves above what&rsquo;s possible in the background, then you and I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be talking into microphones.</p>
<p>We might be doing drumbeats and stuff like this, but we wouldn&rsquo;t be having the sort</p>
<p>of conversation we have.</p>
<p>So to explain how that came about, that&rsquo;s what the economics should be doing, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>So this is the greatest thing that the Earth has ever created, is what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>this conversation?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re the most elaborate construction on the planet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;ve done, we&rsquo;ve denigrated the planet itself.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have respect for the fact that life itself is an incredible creation.</p>
<p>And my ultimate‚Äîif I had to see how humanity is going to survive what we&rsquo;re putting ourselves</p>
<p>through, then we&rsquo;d have to come out of it as a species which sees its role as preserving</p>
<p>and respecting life.</p>
<p>I like how you took my silly, incredible statement and made it into a serious one about how amazing</p>
<p>life is.</p>
<p>Life is incredible, and we humans don&rsquo;t respect it enough, we trash it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what economics, I think, has played a huge role in that.</p>
<p>Until I actually regard my discipline, I would never call it a profession, let alone a science.</p>
<p>My discipline has probably helped bring about the termination potential, the feasible termination</p>
<p>of human civilization.</p>
<p>Strong words.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s return to the basics of economics.</p>
<p>So what is the soul and the practice of economics?</p>
<p>What should be the goal of it?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re speaking very poetically, but we&rsquo;ll also speak pragmatically about the tools</p>
<p>of economics, the variables of economics, the metrics, the goals, the models.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, what are the goals of economics?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of the tools we use, we should be using the tools that engineers use, frankly.</p>
<p>And that sounds ridiculously simple, because you would expect that economists are using</p>
<p>up to date techniques that are common in other sciences, where you&rsquo;re dealing with similar</p>
<p>ideas of stocks and flows, and interactions between the environment and a system and so</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fundamentally systems engineering.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we should be using as the tools of economics.</p>
<p>Now if you look at what economists actually do, the sophisticated stuff involves difference</p>
<p>equations.</p>
<p>And like difference equations, you know, if you&rsquo;ve done enough mathematics as you have,</p>
<p>you know, difference equations are useful for like individual level processes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about autonomous, it&rsquo;ll go from state t to t plus one, t plus two,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>But not when you&rsquo;re talking at the aggregate level.</p>
<p>There you use differential equations to measure it all.</p>
<p>Economists have been using difference equations.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a book, I think it&rsquo;s by Sargent and one other, called Advanced Methods in</p>
<p>Economics Using Python, two volumes set.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about close to 2,000 pages, and four of those pages are on differential equations.</p>
<p>The rest is all difference equations.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re using entirely the wrong mathematics to start with.</p>
<p>For people listening, what is difference equations versus differential equations?</p>
<p>Difference equation is like you can do in a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have, this is the value for 1990, this is the value for 1991, 92, 93, 94.</p>
<p>So you have discrete jumps in time, whereas the differential equation says there&rsquo;s a process</p>
<p>moving through time.</p>
<p>And you will have a rate of change of a variable is a function of the state of itself and other</p>
<p>variables and rates of change of those variables.</p>
<p>And that is what you use when you&rsquo;re doing an aggregate model.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re modeling water, for example, or fluid dynamics, you have a set of differential</p>
<p>equations describing the entire body of fluid moving through time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t try to model the discrete motion of each molecule of H2O.</p>
<p>So at the aggregate level, you use differential equations for processes that occur through</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s economics.</p>
<p>It occurs through time.</p>
<p>You should be using that particular technology.</p>
<p>But some economists do learn differential equations, but they don&rsquo;t learn stability</p>
<p>analysis.</p>
<p>So they simply assume equilibrium is stable, and they work in equilibrium terms all the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And the technical level, it&rsquo;s an incredibly complicated way of modeling the world using</p>
<p>entirely the wrong tools.</p>
<p>OK, we&rsquo;ll talk about that because it&rsquo;s unclear what the right tools are.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s more clear to you, but I&rsquo;ve got to make it clear to an audience.</p>
<p>Well, so this is a very complicated world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex world.</p>
<p>You talk about there are some of the most complex systems on Earth are the human mind,</p>
<p>the economy and the biosphere.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll go, you know, we&rsquo;ll go to that place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by complex systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m humbled by them, even at their simplest level of like cellular automata.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the right tools are to understand that, especially when part of the complex</p>
<p>system is like a hierarchy of other complex systems.</p>
<p>So you said the economy is a fascinating complex system, but it&rsquo;s made up of human minds.</p>
<p>And those are interesting.</p>
<p>Those are interesting, perhaps impossible to model, but we can try and we can try to</p>
<p>figure out how to approximate them.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s the challenge of economics.</p>
<p>OK, we&rsquo;ll keep returning to the basics.</p>
<p>Let us try to learn something from history.</p>
<p>I also see as part of economics is us trying to figure out stuff.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few smart folks that write books throughout human history.</p>
<p>And sometimes they name schools of economics after them.</p>
<p>So let us take a stroll through history.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Can you describe at a high level what are the different schools of economics, perhaps</p>
<p>ones that are interesting to you, perhaps ones that the difference between which reveals</p>
<p>something useful or insightful for our conversation.</p>
<p>So you know, you could neoclassical, post Keynesian, Austrian, like the biophysical</p>
<p>economics and so on, other heterodox economic schools that you find interesting.</p>
<p>OK, I actually find interesting a school which went extinct about 250 years ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d like to start from.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re called the Physiocrats.</p>
<p>And the name itself implies where the knowledge came from, because if you go back far enough</p>
<p>in history, we didn&rsquo;t do autopsies.</p>
<p>But when you started doing autopsies, they found wires, they found tubes, etc., etc.</p>
<p>And they started seeing the body as a circulation system, and they applied the same sort of</p>
<p>logic to the economy.</p>
<p>And they came out of an agricultural economy, which was France, and they saw that the wealth</p>
<p>came effectively from the sun.</p>
<p>So their soil wealth comes from, like I said, the soil, but what they really mean is sun.</p>
<p>The soil absorbs the energy of the sun.</p>
<p>One seed plants, a thousand flea seeds come back.</p>
<p>There is no surplus.</p>
<p>We are simply mining what we can find out of the natural economy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we should have stayed and developed from that forward.</p>
<p>We then went through the classical school of economics, which comes out of Adam Smith.</p>
<p>And Smith, coming from Scotland, looked at what the Physiocrats said, and what the Physiocrats</p>
<p>argued was that agriculture is the source of all wealth, and the manufacturing sector</p>
<p>is sterile.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally the term they used to describe the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>What does sterile mean?</p>
<p>Sterile means you don&rsquo;t extract value.</p>
<p>You simply change the shape of value.</p>
<p>So the value comes from the soil.</p>
<p>Yeah, it comes from the soil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the free gift of nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally the phrase they used.</p>
<p>And we then distribute the free gift of nature around, and we need carriages, which was the</p>
<p>manufacturing term they used at the time, as well as wheat.</p>
<p>So to make the carriages, we take what&rsquo;s been taken from the soil, and we convert it to</p>
<p>a different form.</p>
<p>But there is no value added in manufacturing.</p>
<p>So Smith looked at that and said, well, I&rsquo;m from Scotland.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got these industries, and we make stuff, and it&rsquo;s machinery.</p>
<p>And he said, no, it&rsquo;s not land that gives us the source of value, it&rsquo;s labor.</p>
<p>Now, that led to the classical school of thought, and that said that all value comes from labor,</p>
<p>that value is objective, so it&rsquo;s the amount of effort you put in, that the price two things</p>
<p>will exchange for reflects the relative effort that&rsquo;s involved in the manufacturing.</p>
<p>So this computer takes two hours to make, and this bottle takes two minutes to make,</p>
<p>then this is worth 60 times as much as that.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t talk about marginal cost.</p>
<p>It was absolute cost, effectively.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t talk about utility as a subjective thing, they ridiculed subjective utility theory.</p>
<p>That led to Marx, and Marx is probably the most brilliant mind in the history of economics.</p>
<p>The only other competitor I&rsquo;d see is Schumpeter, possibly Keynes, but in my terms of ranking</p>
<p>of intellects, it would be Marx, Schumpeter, Keynes, in terms of the outstanding capacities</p>
<p>to think.</p>
<p>But Marx then turned that classical school, which was pro capitalism and anti feudal,</p>
<p>into a critique of capitalism, which led to the neoclassical school coming along as a</p>
<p>defense of capitalism.</p>
<p>But they defended it using the ideas of the subjective theory of value, so that value</p>
<p>does not reflect effort, it&rsquo;s the satisfaction individuals get from different objects that</p>
<p>determines their value, marginal utility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the marginal cost that determines how much they sell for.</p>
<p>Capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility, and the concepts of equilibrium</p>
<p>and marginal this and marginal that became the neoclassical school, and that&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>the dominant school now 150 years later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one that everybody learns.</p>
<p>When you first learn economics, if you don&rsquo;t have the critical background that I managed</p>
<p>to acquire, that&rsquo;s what you think is economics, the marginal utility, equilibrium oriented</p>
<p>analysis of mainstream economics, and for example, they ignore money.</p>
<p>People think economists, you must be an expert on money because you&rsquo;re an economist.</p>
<p>Well, in fact, economists learn literally in the first few weeks at university that</p>
<p>money is irrelevant.</p>
<p>They say money illusion.</p>
<p>They represent people&rsquo;s tastes using what they call indifference curves, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like isoquants on a weather map.</p>
<p>If you look at an isoquant, it shows you all the points of the same pressure.</p>
<p>So you can be here or you can be in Denver and the air pressure can be the same if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the same weather unit, so you just draw a cell that links together.</p>
<p>Well, they do the same thing with utility and say lots of bananas and very few coconuts</p>
<p>can give you the same utility as lots of coconuts and very few bananas, and you draw basically</p>
<p>like a hyperbola running down linking the two, and they&rsquo;ll say, well, that&rsquo;s your utility.</p>
<p>That describes your tastes, and then we have your income, and given your income, you can</p>
<p>buy that many bananas completely or that many coconuts or a straight line combination of</p>
<p>the two, and then if we double the nominal price of coconuts and double the nominal price</p>
<p>of bananas and double your income, what happens, and the correct answer is, oh, nothing, sir.</p>
<p>You stay at the same point of tangency between what your budget is and which particular utility</p>
<p>curve gives you the maximum satisfaction.</p>
<p>So that gets ingrained into them, and they think anybody who worries about money suffers</p>
<p>from money illusion.</p>
<p>You are therefore ignorant of the deep insights of economics if you think money actually matters.</p>
<p>So you have an entire theory of economics which presumes we exchange through barter.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll swap you that Microsoft Surface for, actually, I&rsquo;ll take two of those for</p>
<p>one of these.</p>
<p>We do this bartering type arrangement.</p>
<p>In fact, that only works if money plays no creative role in the economy, and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>you find, reading Schumpeter, the insight that&rsquo;s the school of thought that I come from</p>
<p>that says money is essential.</p>
<p>Money actually adds to demand, and we&rsquo;ll talk about that later on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the neoclassical school that ends up being subjective theory of value, nonmonetary,</p>
<p>as though everything happens in barter, and focusing on equilibrium, as though everything</p>
<p>happens in equilibrium, or if you get disturbed from equilibrium, you return back to it again.</p>
<p>And that mindset describes capitalism.</p>
<p>Its most interesting feature is that it reaches equilibrium.</p>
<p>Now what planet are we on to believe that?</p>
<p>Because if you look at the real world, the real exciting world of capitalism in which</p>
<p>we live, change is by far the most obvious characteristic of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no equilibrium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unstable.</p>
<p>And as a mathematician, it&rsquo;s easy to ‚Äì you work with stability analysis.</p>
<p>You work out what the Jacobian is.</p>
<p>You work out your Lyapunov exponents in a complex system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re used to the idea that equilibrium is unstable.</p>
<p>But economists get schooled into believing that everything happens in equilibrium, and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t learn stability analysis.</p>
<p>So all that stuff is missing.</p>
<p>So onto the schools of thought, treating the economy as an equilibrium system, which was</p>
<p>what the neoclassical school did, is what Keynes disturbed.</p>
<p>And he really disturbed it by talking about, fundamentally, that uncertainty determines</p>
<p>our decisions about the future.</p>
<p>So when we consume, you know if you like Pfizer or whatever particular drink we want to have,</p>
<p>you know the current situation.</p>
<p>But to invest, you must be making guesses about the future.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t know the future.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>You extrapolate what you currently know.</p>
<p>And as you said, this is a terrible basis on which to plan for the future.</p>
<p>But this is the only thing you can do where there is no possibility of solid calculation.</p>
<p>So investment is therefore subject to uncertainty, and therefore you will get volatility out</p>
<p>of investment.</p>
<p>You will get fads, of course, booms and slumps coming out of that, because people extrapolate</p>
<p>for the current conditions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the normal state of a capitalist economy.</p>
<p>And Schumpeter argued that that&rsquo;s what gives it its creativity as well, the fact that you</p>
<p>can perceive a potential demand, but first of all, you don&rsquo;t know whether that demand</p>
<p>is going to work.</p>
<p>Secondly, you don&rsquo;t know who your competitor is going to be, whether somebody is going</p>
<p>to be ahead of you or behind.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a fad, you&rsquo;ll overinvest.</p>
<p>All this stuff is the real nature of capitalism, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to capture,</p>
<p>the dynamic nonequilibrium monetary violence and creativity of capitalism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we should be analyzing.</p>
<p>And the post Keynesian school has gone in that orientation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been, in my opinion, inhibited by learning their mathematics from neoclassical</p>
<p>economists, so they don&rsquo;t have enough of the technology of complex systems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a really tiny handful of people working in complex systems analysis in post</p>
<p>Keynesian economics, but that is, to me, the most interesting area.</p>
<p>So their tools may be lacking, but they fundamentally accept the instability of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So let me try to summarize what you said, and then you say how stupid I am.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then there was the physiocrats that thought value came from the land.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Adam Smith, who said, nah, value comes from human labor.</p>
<p>That was the classical school.</p>
<p>And then neoclassical is value comes from bananas and coconuts, human preferences, like</p>
<p>human happiness, how happy a banana makes you.</p>
<p>And then the Keynesian and the post Keynesian were like, yeah, well, you can&rsquo;t, you can</p>
<p>never, the moment you try to put value to a banana and a coconut, you&rsquo;re already working</p>
<p>in the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always going to be chaos and stability.</p>
<p>And then you just, you&rsquo;re fishing in uncertain waters, and that&rsquo;s why we have to embrace</p>
<p>that and come up with tools that model that well.</p>
<p>And also Joseph Schumpeter, what school would you put him under?</p>
<p>Is he a Keynesian or is he Austrian economics?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an Austrian.</p>
<p>The Austrians deny.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the intriguing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s from Austria, but he&rsquo;s not an Austrian economist.</p>
<p>There are elements of the Austrian school of thought, which are worthwhile.</p>
<p>What is Austrian economics in this beautiful whirlwind picture that you painted?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Austrian economics grew out of the rebellion against the classical school.</p>
<p>So you had three intellects who mainly led the growth of the neoclassical school back</p>
<p>in the 1870s.</p>
<p>It was William Jevons from England, Menger, who&rsquo;s from Austria, and Vollras from France.</p>
<p>And Vollras tried to work out a set of equations to describe a multiproduct economy where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>numerous producers and numerous consumers.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s both a producer and a consumer, and you try to work out a vector of prices</p>
<p>that will give you equilibrium in all markets instantaneously.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s his equilibrium orientation.</p>
<p>Jevons is also one about equilibrium, but he worked more at the aggregate level.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a supply curve and a demand curve, and that&rsquo;s what Marshall ultimately codified.</p>
<p>Menger was pretty much saying that, well, yes, there might be an equilibrium, but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get disturbed from it all the time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be above or below the equilibrium.</p>
<p>And what came out of the Austrian school was an acceptance of that sort of vision that</p>
<p>a market should reach equilibrium, but then said, well, you&rsquo;ll get disturbed away from</p>
<p>the equilibrium.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what gives you the vitality of capitalism, because an entrepreneur will see</p>
<p>an arbitrage advantage and try to close that gap, and that will give you innovation over</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And Schumpeter went beyond that and saw the role of money and said that an entrepreneur</p>
<p>is somebody with a great idea and no money.</p>
<p>So to become a capitalist, you&rsquo;ve got to get money.</p>
<p>And therefore, you&rsquo;ve got to approach the finance sector to get the money, and the finance</p>
<p>sector creates money and also creates a debt for the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>And so you get this financial engine turning up as well, and you will get movements away</p>
<p>from equilibrium out of that.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t necessarily head back towards the equilibrium.</p>
<p>So Schumpeter has a rich vision of capitalism in which money plays an essential role, in</p>
<p>which you will be disturbed from equilibrium all the time.</p>
<p>And that is really, I think, a much closer vision of actual capitalism than anything</p>
<p>by even the leading Austrians, Hayek, et cetera, et cetera, and certainly Rombardo, I find</p>
<p>totally like reading a cardboard cutout version of The Wealth of Nations.</p>
<p>I find his work trivial.</p>
<p>But Schumpeter was rich, but with the same foundations as the Austrians.</p>
<p>But because he talked about the importance of money that took him away from the Austrian</p>
<p>vision, which is very much based on a hard money idea of capitalism, Schumpeter said</p>
<p>you needed the capacity of the financial sector to create money to empower entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very important vision.</p>
<p>So Schumpeter&rsquo;s argument is the deviation from equilibrium, that&rsquo;s where all the fun</p>
<p>happens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where all the magic happens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the magic of capitalism.</p>
<p>And like the Austrians, because they focus on the deviation from equilibrium, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>better than their classicals, but they still have this belief in the, you&rsquo;ll reach equilibrium</p>
<p>ultimately or you&rsquo;ll head back towards it, whereas they don&rsquo;t have an explanation of</p>
<p>capitalism that gives you cycles apart from having the wrong rate of interest.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no role for an accumulation of debt over time.</p>
<p>So what Schumpeter gave us was a vision of the creativity of capitalism being driven</p>
<p>by entrepreneurs who are funded by money creation by the finance sector.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fundamentally the world in which we live.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also the kids these days are all into modern monetary theory, what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>about?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Modern monetary theory is accounting.</p>
<p>I want to summarize it bluntly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply saying let&rsquo;s do the accounting because what money is, is a creature of double</p>
<p>entry bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s double entry bookkeeping?</p>
<p>This was invented back in the 1500s in Italy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve forgotten the particular merchant who did it based on some Arabic ideas as well.</p>
<p>But the thing is, if you want to keep track of your financial flows, then you divide all</p>
<p>the financial claims on you.</p>
<p>You divide into claims you have on somebody else, which are your assets, claims somebody</p>
<p>else has on you, which are your liabilities, and the gap between the two is your equity.</p>
<p>So you record every transaction twice on one row.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So for example, if you and I do a financial transfer, you have a bank account, I have</p>
<p>a bank account, your bank account will go down, mine goes up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the sum of the operation is zero.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, if I go to a bank and borrow money, then my account goes up, they</p>
<p>put money in my deposit account, the bank&rsquo;s assets go up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still the same sum applies, assets minus liabilities minus equity equals zero.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s simply saying money is an accounting, a creature of accounting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a creature of a commodity.</p>
<p>So if you think about how Austrians think about money, and how gold bugs think about</p>
<p>money and Bitcoin enthusiasts, if there are any left, think about money, what they see</p>
<p>is money is an object.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And you and I can both have more gold, if we&rsquo;re both willing to go to this mine somewhere</p>
<p>and dig a few holes and get a few specks of gold out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no competition or no interaction between you and me if money is gold.</p>
<p>And they think money should be an object, a commodity.</p>
<p>But money fundamentally is not a commodity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a claim on somebody else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s money&rsquo;s essence.</p>
<p>So when you do it, you must use double entry bookkeeping to do it.</p>
<p>And then when you do, you find all the answers that come out of thinking of money as a commodity</p>
<p>are wrong.</p>
<p>So for example, and I&rsquo;ve got Elon on this one.</p>
<p>So I want to get this with Elon because I saw him making a comment about this a few</p>
<p>weeks ago on Twitter.</p>
<p>He said that it&rsquo;s wrong for the government, effectively it seems wrong for the government</p>
<p>to always be in deficit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, when you look at it and say, well, how is money created?</p>
<p>How does money come about when it&rsquo;s not a commodity like gold, which you dig up out</p>
<p>of the ground, when it&rsquo;s actually social relations between people that create money?</p>
<p>Well, money is the fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector.</p>
<p>If we make a transfer between us, your deposit account goes down, my deposit account goes</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Deposit exchange is on the liability side of the banking sector.</p>
<p>But if we have a transaction with a bank, then if the bank lends us money, as its loans</p>
<p>go up, its deposits go up, again, that same balance.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to look and say, money therefore is fundamentally the liabilities of the banking</p>
<p>sector.</p>
<p>So how do you create additional liabilities?</p>
<p>You must have an operation which occurs both on the liability side and the asset side of</p>
<p>the banking sector.</p>
<p>So if you and I make a new transaction, no money is created.</p>
<p>Existing money is redistributed.</p>
<p>But if you go to a bank and take out a bank loan, then money is created by the bank loan.</p>
<p>So the liabilities of the banking sector rise, the assets rise, they&rsquo;re balanced, but more</p>
<p>liabilities of the banking sector means more money.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how private banks create money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I first started working on when I became an academic about 35 years ago,</p>
<p>the actual dynamics of private money creation.</p>
<p>But the government has the same sort of story.</p>
<p>If the government runs a deficit, it spends more money on the individuals in the economy</p>
<p>than it taxes them, which means their bank accounts increase.</p>
<p>So a government deficit creates money for the private sector.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where money creation occurs from the government.</p>
<p>So it puts more money into people&rsquo;s bank accounts by spending, by welfare payments than it takes</p>
<p>out by taxation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s creating new money.</p>
<p>And then on the other side on the bank, the money turns up in the reserve accounts of</p>
<p>the banks, which are basically the private bank&rsquo;s bank accounts at the central bank.</p>
<p>So rather than the asset of private money creation being loans, the asset of government</p>
<p>money creation is reserves.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Money creation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>So you mentioned a bunch of stuff like private money creation with the liabilities in the</p>
<p>banks and then how the government is doing, the reserves, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there&rsquo;s a bunch of printers that are printing money.</p>
<p>And then you also said something interesting, which is social relations between humans is</p>
<p>what creates money.</p>
<p>I think my mind was blown several times over the past minute.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s difficult for me to reconstruct the pieces of my mind back together.</p>
<p>But basic question, is money creation a good thing or a bad thing?</p>
<p>Money creation is a good thing because money creation is what allows commerce to happen.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a conservation of&hellip;</p>
<p>No, there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I had to have arguments with physicists over this and it took me a long time to answer</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So the sum total of all money is zero.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sum total of all assets and liabilities is zero.</p>
<p>So if you imagine your assets minus your liabilities is your equity and your asset is somebody</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s liability and your liability is somebody else&rsquo;s asset.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re talking about financial assets, and this is another mind blowing thing that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just recently solved myself.</p>
<p>So the sum total of all financial assets and liabilities is zero.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt you rudely.</p>
<p>What are assets?</p>
<p>What are liabilities?</p>
<p>Assets are your claims on somebody else.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Specific.</p>
<p>Give me an example of an asset.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you have a mortgage for this house?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m renting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re renting.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Well, if you had a mortgage, that&rsquo;d be your liability.</p>
<p>That would be my liability.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The mortgage with the bank&rsquo;s asset.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If you add the two together, you get zero.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s zero.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s zero.</p>
<p>So money is the liabilities side of the banking sector.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Assets are the&hellip;</p>
<p>The assets on the other side can be either created by the banking sector, which is where</p>
<p>you get bank loans, or created by the government, where you get reserves.</p>
<p>But money is the liabilities.</p>
<p>Money is&hellip;</p>
<p>If you think about protons and anti protons, in that sense, money is like the anti proton.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the negative, the liability.</p>
<p>But wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>The liability is the negative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that money?</p>
<p>I thought money is the positive.</p>
<p>What is the liability for the banking sector is an asset for you and me.</p>
<p>And assets includes money?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If you have a bank account, you&rsquo;d have a bank account, and you&rsquo;d have some cash.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Those are your assets.</p>
<p>But the bank account is a liability of the banking sector, and the cash is a liability</p>
<p>of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s money?</p>
<p>Well, money is the promise of a third party that we both accept to close our transaction.</p>
<p>And this is&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a bank with a liability?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bank.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One of the most important works I&rsquo;ve ever read is a work by a wonderful, now unfortunately</p>
<p>deceased, Italian economist called Augusto Graziani.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the most wonderful personality.</p>
<p>Augusto, I met him on a few occasions, is one of the few human beings who can speak</p>
<p>in perfectly formed paragraphs, okay, superbly eloquent.</p>
<p>And what he did was write a paper called The Monetary Theory of Production.</p>
<p>You can find it, download it on the web, it&rsquo;s pretty much open source now.</p>
<p>And what he said is, what distinguishes a monetary economy from a barter economy?</p>
<p>So he said, in a barter economy, what we do is, you know, I&rsquo;ll give you two of these for</p>
<p>one of those.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, barter.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a relative price, there are two of us involved, and there are two commodities.</p>
<p>So with money, money is a triangular transaction, okay?</p>
<p>There is one commodity, I want to buy that can of drink off you, two people, and the</p>
<p>price that&rsquo;s worked out ends up being in a transfer from the promises to pay the bank</p>
<p>that the buyer has to the promises to pay the bank that the seller has.</p>
<p>So if I, so what you have is a monetary transaction in a capitalist economy involves three agents,</p>
<p>the buyer, the seller, and the bank.</p>
<p>So the bank always has to be part of it.</p>
<p>Well, the bank has to be part of it.</p>
<p>When I hand you the money, you accept that as you&rsquo;ve now got, rather than it&rsquo;s the bank</p>
<p>promising to pay me something, it&rsquo;s now the bank promising to pay you something.</p>
<p>And we exchange the promises of banks, and that&rsquo;s fundamentally money.</p>
<p>So money is fundamentally a threesome, and everybody gets fucked.</p>
<p>Is that a good way to put it?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>It leaves it, it leaves it for the guy to be like, oh no, I can use French in this conversation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not French, that&rsquo;s a different language, I&rsquo;ll explain it to you one day.</p>
<p>You Australians will never understand.</p>
<p>Okay, if I can return to, we&rsquo;ll jump around if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Karl Marx as one of the great intellects, economic thinkers ever.</p>
<p>He might be number one.</p>
<p>You study him quite a bit, you disagree with him quite a bit, but you still think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a powerful thinker.</p>
<p>A powerful mind.</p>
<p>So first of all, let&rsquo;s just explore the human.</p>
<p>Why do you say so?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting in that mind?</p>
<p>In the way he saw the world, what are the insights that you find brilliant?</p>
<p>Marx once described his major work as, towards a critical examination of everything existing.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a modest bastard.</p>
<p>So he wanted to understand and criticize everything.</p>
<p>And even, he wasn&rsquo;t trained directly by Hegel, but his teachers were Hegelian philosophers.</p>
<p>And what Hegel developed was a concept called dialectics.</p>
<p>And dialectics is the philosophy of change.</p>
<p>And when most people hear the word dialectics, they come up with this unpronounceable trio</p>
<p>of words called thesis, antithesis, synthesis.</p>
<p>I can barely get the words out myself.</p>
<p>And that actually is not Hegel at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another German philosopher.</p>
<p>Kant?</p>
<p>Fichte.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought it was Kant.</p>
<p>No, Fichte.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I mix them up.</p>
<p>All Germans look the same to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but if you look, there&rsquo;s a beautiful book called Marx and Contradiction.</p>
<p>You want to find a great explanation for Marx&rsquo;s philosophy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve forgotten the author.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Wild, W I L D E, Marx and Contradiction.</p>
<p>And he points out the actual origins of Marx&rsquo;s philosophy, but I didn&rsquo;t know that when I</p>
<p>first read Marx.</p>
<p>So I became exposed to Marx when I was a student at Sydney University.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d had a strike at the university over the teaching of philosophy.</p>
<p>And what happened was the philosophy department had a lot of radical philosophers in it and</p>
<p>a conservative chief philosopher.</p>
<p>And the radicals wanted to have a course on what they called philosophical aspects of</p>
<p>feminist thought.</p>
<p>And the staff voted in favor of it.</p>
<p>This is back in the days when university departments were democratic.</p>
<p>The professor opposed it.</p>
<p>He got it blocked at a high level.</p>
<p>The staff lipfrogged over that, and then finally the vice chancellor blocked it.</p>
<p>So that led to a strike over the teaching of philosophy at Sydney University, which</p>
<p>at one stage, over half the students were on strike.</p>
<p>Economics began out of that.</p>
<p>Over teaching of a philosophy of feminism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>God, it&rsquo;s good to be a student.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a different life to what we&rsquo;re living now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the academic milieu in which I developed all my ideas.</p>
<p>And I had become a critic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone from being a believer of mainstream economics when I was a first year student</p>
<p>to disbelieving it halfway through first year.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I then spent a long time trying to change it, getting nowhere.</p>
<p>And then this philosophy strike happened and we took it on in economics and we formed what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the political economy movement and had a successful strike.</p>
<p>We actually managed to pressure the university into establishing a department of political</p>
<p>economy at Sydney University, as well as a department of economics.</p>
<p>What was the foundational ideas?</p>
<p>Were you resistant to the whole censorship of why can&rsquo;t you have a philosophy of anything</p>
<p>kind of course?</p>
<p>Well, it was much more libertarian in the genuine sense of the word, period of time,</p>
<p>at the end of the 60s, beginning of the 70s than the word libertarian has been corrupted</p>
<p>since then.</p>
<p>But it really was about free thought.</p>
<p>And you went to university to learn.</p>
<p>It was about education.</p>
<p>I remember having a fight with my father once where dad was angry about the marks I was</p>
<p>getting for some of my courses.</p>
<p>And he said, if you don&rsquo;t get a decent result, you won&rsquo;t get a decent job.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m not here to get a job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to get an education.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, the thing is, ultimately, it&rsquo;s been a pretty good job for me as well.</p>
<p>This is in Sydney, by the way, and Sydney in summer is absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>And what does a bunch of lefties decide to do during summer but read Karl Marx?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On the beach or?</p>
<p>Actually, inside the room of the philosophy department at the University of Sydney in</p>
<p>the main quadrangle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sandstone all around us, and we have a bunch of about 20 or 30 of us reading our</p>
<p>way through Marx.</p>
<p>Capital?</p>
<p>Which capital?</p>
<p>It was volume one capital.</p>
<p>And I remember walking off to that meeting with one of my friends who&rsquo;s a law student.</p>
<p>And this was a period of a huge construction boom in Sydney, so the whole skyline, which</p>
<p>we could see from the campus, was full of what they call kangaroo cranes, which were</p>
<p>an Australian invention, that are cranes that can be leapfrogged over each other to build</p>
<p>a skyscraper.</p>
<p>So, here you are reading Karl Marx, looking at the mechanisms of capital.</p>
<p>And I looked at those mechanisms, and I knew Marx argued that labor was the only source</p>
<p>of value.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he said machinery doesn&rsquo;t add value.</p>
<p>So, the cranes are worthless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at these cranes and thinking, I want a very good explanation by Marx as</p>
<p>to why these cranes don&rsquo;t add value.</p>
<p>So, reading through the first seven chapters of Capital, what you found was Marx applying</p>
<p>this dialectic.</p>
<p>And like the Fichte and stuff is bullshit.</p>
<p>That is not how Marx thought at all.</p>
<p>I was reading, trying to find the thesis and the synthesis, and it&rsquo;s not there at all in</p>
<p>any of Marx&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve read everything he&rsquo;s ever written on economics from 1844 to 1894, when his last</p>
<p>books were published.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one word of mention of that.</p>
<p>What he does talk about is foreground and background and tension.</p>
<p>And his idea of a dialectic is that a unity will exist in society, and that unity can</p>
<p>be individual, it can be a commodity, anything at all.</p>
<p>The unity will be understood by that society.</p>
<p>One particular aspect will be focused upon.</p>
<p>So, if you think about the human being in capitalism, the focus on the human being as</p>
<p>an object is their capacity to work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a worker, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s put in the foreground.</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;re human and you want to play a guitar and go surfing and make love</p>
<p>and all the other things that humans do is pushed into the background.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tension between the two of those.</p>
<p>And that can transform that unity over time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a beautiful dynamic vision of change.</p>
<p>So dialectics is a philosophy of change.</p>
<p>So synthesis, antithesis is what does every idea have a counter argument?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a positive and negative and you bring them together somehow.</p>
<p>And then Marx has this foreground, background, and tension.</p>
<p>Foreground is all what we think of as economics and background is all the lovemaking we do</p>
<p>as humans.</p>
<p>That sort of thing.</p>
<p>And why is there a tension?</p>
<p>Because if you imagine the unity, like if you take a human in a, any preview, like</p>
<p>if you go back to Cro Magnum days, when we&rsquo;re living in caves and we&rsquo;ve got to go hunting</p>
<p>and cook food and stuff like that, but there&rsquo;s no social hierarchy.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve become used to, so you don&rsquo;t get labored as a worker or a capitalist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a human in that situation.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got more an integrated view of who you are.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the appeals of a tribal, a genuine tribal culture that you</p>
<p>get treated for the whole of who you are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve certainly categorized you&rsquo;re male, you&rsquo;re female, you&rsquo;re young, you&rsquo;re old,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a hunter, you&rsquo;re a tool maker, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re treated as more an integrated object.</p>
<p>When you get put in a complex society, like a capitalist society, then one side of you&rsquo;s</p>
<p>emphasized and the others are deemphasized.</p>
<p>So is it fair to say that the background is like our basic fundamental humanity and the</p>
<p>foreground is the machine of capitalism?</p>
<p>Effectively.</p>
<p>And when you look at it in terms of a human, but what Marx did is apply this to a commodity.</p>
<p>So he said, what is the essential unity in a capitalist economy?</p>
<p>And the essential unity is a commodity.</p>
<p>The essential unit.</p>
<p>The essential unity.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s unity?</p>
<p>Unity is an object in society.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So he started from the point of view of trying to understand how exchange occurs.</p>
<p>How do we set prices?</p>
<p>And his starting vision was to say that a commodity is a unity in a capitalist economy.</p>
<p>The part of the unity that we focus upon is the exchange value.</p>
<p>A capitalist produces a commodity, not because of its qualitative characteristics, but because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be sold for a profit.</p>
<p>So the foreground aspect of a commodity is its exchange value.</p>
<p>The background aspect of it, it won&rsquo;t succeed as a commodity unless it has a use value.</p>
<p>So the background is the utility thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, if you made something which didn&rsquo;t work, okay, then you might be able to sell it, but</p>
<p>it has no utility.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make that into a commodity.</p>
<p>A broken thing can&rsquo;t be sold.</p>
<p>Does that have the subjective?</p>
<p>Yeah, it has to have the subjective side as well as the objective.</p>
<p>So the objective is what capitalists worry about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you my favorite counter example of that.</p>
<p>I took a bunch of Australian journalists to China way back in the period when the Gang</p>
<p>of Four was being on trial, and we did a tour of the Forbidden City in Beijing.</p>
<p>And at that stage, all the artifacts of the royal family, the emperor, were actually in</p>
<p>the building still.</p>
<p>And we walked past one of them, and it was this gold, solid gold bar about this long,</p>
<p>shaped like a fist, turned over like this.</p>
<p>And on this side, there were rubies, emeralds, diamonds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d never seen gemstones.</p>
<p>I mean, gems that big, okay?</p>
<p>And one of the journalists asked me what I thought it was, and I said, oh, it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>Jane is a backscratcher, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>I walked away.</p>
<p>She caught up with me about 20 minutes later, said, I asked one of the guides, it is a backscratcher.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a backscratcher for the emperor made of solid gold with diamonds and rubies</p>
<p>and emeralds during the scratching.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a commodity in a feudal society, okay?</p>
<p>The cost doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You want the most elaborate, beautiful thing because you are the emperor.</p>
<p>So in a feudal society, the commodity, what&rsquo;s focused upon is the utility.</p>
<p>And the cost of production when you&rsquo;re the emperor is immaterial.</p>
<p>Capitalism reverses that.</p>
<p>So the commodity in a capitalist economy is a plastic $2.00 scratchy you can get from</p>
<p>Kmart or Target.</p>
<p>And so the use value is necessary but irrelevant to forming the price.</p>
<p>Now, that was a completely different vision of exchange in capitalism to what I found</p>
<p>in the neoclassical theory because that says it&rsquo;s the marginal utility and the marginal</p>
<p>cost of everything that determines the exchange ratio.</p>
<p>And the crazy thing about that is not so much the marginal utility, but the argument in</p>
<p>the neoclassical theory is that the price ratio, the price will, when there&rsquo;s an exchange</p>
<p>going on, there&rsquo;s two person, two commodity exchange of two commodities between two people.</p>
<p>The price will change until such time as the ratio of the marginal utilities is equal to</p>
<p>the ratio of the marginal costs that&rsquo;s supposed to be the equilibrium.</p>
<p>And Marx says that&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a previous society where you exchange stuff that you happen to have for stuff somebody</p>
<p>else happened to have without any real production mechanism being involved.</p>
<p>And he said that&rsquo;s like when you have two ancient tribes meeting for the very first</p>
<p>time and one tribe can make something the other tribe can&rsquo;t make.</p>
<p>And they will therefore, the price they were willing to pay will reflect how unique this</p>
<p>other object is that this one tribe can make and the other can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So for example, the story of Manhattan being sold for 40 glass beads, it&rsquo;s actually 40</p>
<p>glass trading beads, I believe it is a true story.</p>
<p>But the thing is the Indians couldn&rsquo;t make glass beads.</p>
<p>So they valued the glass beads at the island of Manhattan, okay, which is a utility based</p>
<p>comparison.</p>
<p>And what Marx said, that&rsquo;s the very initial contact over time, even if you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the technology.</p>
<p>Over time, you start to realize how much work goes involved to making what they&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>you versus what you&rsquo;re selling to them.</p>
<p>And you start making stuff specifically for sale.</p>
<p>So you know, Elon&rsquo;s not losing personal utility each time a Model 3 goes out the door.</p>
<p>He might get utility out of the fact that he&rsquo;s created that vehicle, that concept and</p>
<p>manufactures it and so on, but he&rsquo;s not losing utility each time a Model T Ford goes out</p>
<p>the door, going back for the ancient commodity there.</p>
<p>So the utility plays no role in setting price in Marx&rsquo;s model.</p>
<p>Whereas it&rsquo;s essential in the neoclassical model.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between utility and marginal utility?</p>
<p>What does the word marginal mean?</p>
<p>And why is it such a problem?</p>
<p>It turns marginal utility or utility itself has different meanings than the two schools</p>
<p>of thought.</p>
<p>If you take the classical school of thought, which when Marx comes from, utility is effectively</p>
<p>objective.</p>
<p>So the utility of a chair is that you can sit in it, okay, not how comfortable it makes</p>
<p>you feel.</p>
<p>Okay, now if you think about the utility of the chairs, we&rsquo;re both sitting and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>identical from a classical point of view, we&rsquo;re both sitting.</p>
<p>But from a neoclassical point of view, it&rsquo;s how comfortable it makes you feel.</p>
<p>And that depends upon your subjective feelings of comfort.</p>
<p>You might be far more comfortable in the identical chair that I&rsquo;m sitting in than I am.</p>
<p>And therefore, the comparison is difficult.</p>
<p>And therefore, working out a ratio involves you&rsquo;ve got a decline in your, each time you</p>
<p>give away a chair in exchange for an iPhone, you have a fall in your utility, okay?</p>
<p>And then therefore, you want a higher return because you&rsquo;re losing more utility each time.</p>
<p>The more chairs you give away, the less utility you&rsquo;re getting from chairs.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a decline in your utility.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your marginal utility.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s including your subjective valuation in setting the price.</p>
<p>And what Marx pointed out is this is a caricature of actual change in a capitalist economy because</p>
<p>we have, in a capitalist economy, huge factories turning out huge quantities, specifically</p>
<p>for sale.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got no utility to the seller unless they&rsquo;re sold, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very different vision of how price is set.</p>
<p>And Marx used that to explain where profit comes from, but he made a mistake.</p>
<p>And his argument was that talking about a worker, as now your unity, this foreground</p>
<p>background tension thing, the foreground is that you hire a worker for their cost of production.</p>
<p>And the cost of production is a subsistence wage, okay?</p>
<p>Their utility to the buyer is the fact that they can work in a factory.</p>
<p>Now, it might take six hours, let&rsquo;s say, to make the means of subsistence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the exchange value, and that&rsquo;s what the capitalist pays as a wage to the</p>
<p>worker.</p>
<p>But they can work in the factory for 12 hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the utility.</p>
<p>12 minus 6 is 6 surplus of value hours, and that&rsquo;s where profit comes from.</p>
<p>And that was Marx&rsquo;s argument.</p>
<p>And I thought it was brilliant, but it also applied to machinery.</p>
<p>Right, okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s blink on that.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Deep is good.</p>
<p>You just want to define terms.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take that statement out of context, the internet, please.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You said buyer, seller, worker in a factory, who&rsquo;s the seller, who&rsquo;s the buyer?</p>
<p>Why is the worker the buyer?</p>
<p>The worker is the commodity in this case.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re going to make stuff in a factory, you&rsquo;ve got to hire workers.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And what Marx is saying, the buyer in that situation is a capitalist.</p>
<p>So what does the buyer pay?</p>
<p>He says he pays the exchange value.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s back to the commodity thing, because that&rsquo;s the starting point.</p>
<p>He said the essential unity in a capitalist economy is the commodity.</p>
<p>A commodity has two characteristics, exchange value and use value.</p>
<p>Exchange value of a commodity in a capitalist economy will be its cost of production.</p>
<p>The use value is what you do with it, okay, once you&rsquo;ve purchased it.</p>
<p>But labor is a commodity?</p>
<p>In this case, when a worker is being hired for a job, yes.</p>
<p>So the worker&rsquo;s labor has an exchange value and a use value as well?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, yeah.</p>
<p>Use value.</p>
<p>Use value of a worker&rsquo;s labor.</p>
<p>Exchange value.</p>
<p>Let me think about that.</p>
<p>So the hours they put in is the use value.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So what does the worker want in this?</p>
<p>What are the motivations?</p>
<p>Are we not considering the worker in this context as a human being?</p>
<p>Well, you come in and that&rsquo;s actually, that&rsquo;s the next layer.</p>
<p>What Marx gives us is like a layered cake, starting from a foundation of saying straight</p>
<p>commodity exchange, and then saying, well, you&rsquo;re treating a worker as a commodity.</p>
<p>Now a commodity is something like this, okay, that has, so far as I&rsquo;m aware, no soul, okay?</p>
<p>Not going to be complaining if I turn it upside down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll fall over.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no soul there as a human, is both a commodity and a noncommodity.</p>
<p>And therefore there&rsquo;ll be a tension in the person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being treated as a commodity here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being paid just enough to stay alive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a wife and kids back at home.</p>
<p>So that is another layer of thinking in Marx, and on that layer he then says, well, workers</p>
<p>will therefore demand more than their value.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when you get like political.</p>
<p>You get political and you get money coming above that and so on.</p>
<p>But the basic idea starts from the commodity is the fundamental unity in capitalism.</p>
<p>The important commodity in Marx&rsquo;s thinking was the worker, because that&rsquo;s where he said</p>
<p>profit came from, okay?</p>
<p>And then that explains the motivation of the capitalist, and that ultimately is the labor</p>
<p>theory of value and Marx&rsquo;s arguments about how capitalism will come to an end.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>So first of all, what is the labor theory of value?</p>
<p>And actually before that, what is value?</p>
<p>Is that, this is like me asking what&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to say about trying to define value?</p>
<p>You vary, and this is a huge problem in economics is arguments of what does value mean?</p>
<p>And the neoclassicals came down as that it&rsquo;s subjective.</p>
<p>Its value is whatever you get out of it, but it&rsquo;s your personal evaluation of something,</p>
<p>your personal feelings.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got that very subjective idea of value, whereas the Marxists, being inheritors</p>
<p>of classical school, talk in terms of objective value.</p>
<p>So the value is the number of hours it takes to make something, or the effort.</p>
<p>Value is the effort that goes into making something in the classical school.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just one measure of objective.</p>
<p>Where do you fall?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Where do you fall?</p>
<p>I fall on&hellip;</p>
<p>Subjective versus objective spectrum of value.</p>
<p>I think you have to have the capacity to move between one and the other in a structured</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>The K model of value.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, my base model is the objective, okay?</p>
<p>But above that, as soon as you start talking, you said about the worker, for example, then</p>
<p>you get involved in the subjectivity, because a worker will be angry, and justifiably so,</p>
<p>about being treated as a commodity, because I&rsquo;m not a commodity, I&rsquo;m a human being, okay?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where Marx saw political organization coming from.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s subjective now.</p>
<p>And then when you get to money itself, Marx actually said, well, what&rsquo;s the value of money?</p>
<p>Now if you use an objective theory of value, you would say, well, the value of money is</p>
<p>its cost of production.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the cost of producing a dollar?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about two cents.</p>
<p>So he said it can&rsquo;t be, the value of money cannot be its cost of production.</p>
<p>Or the most value, I think if I remember the phrase properly, is value here as it must</p>
<p>mean the, effectively, uncertain expectations or subjective valuation.</p>
<p>Uncertain expectations or subjective valuation.</p>
<p>Okay, but he&rsquo;s okay with that?</p>
<p>He was okay with that, because he could move between different levels, because he had a</p>
<p>structured foundation of this dialectical vision of foreground, background tension,</p>
<p>commodity, having use value, exchange value, and a gap between the two when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about machines, when you&rsquo;re buying stuff for production.</p>
<p>And then at the next level, he could look at workers, worker organization, and say that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>driven by being treated as a commodity when you&rsquo;re a noncommodity.</p>
<p>So the basic labor theory of value that is described to Karl Marx is that value at the</p>
<p>base layer fundamentally comes from the labor you put into something.</p>
<p>And you say, well, there&rsquo;s some deep truth there, except he misses one fundamental point,</p>
<p>which is machines can also bring value to the world.</p>
<p>He was saying they don&rsquo;t, the only thing that matters is human labor, not labor.</p>
<p>How do you measure what&rsquo;s the role of whatever value machines bring to the world?</p>
<p>This is another intriguing history, because Marx, when he first started, had what you</p>
<p>can call an exclusivist explanation for why labor created value.</p>
<p>And that was to say that labor is the only commodity with both what he called commodity</p>
<p>and commodity power.</p>
<p>So you have labor and labor power.</p>
<p>Labor is the, and I get fuzzy about this, I haven&rsquo;t read it for something like 30 years,</p>
<p>but labor has both commodity and commodity power.</p>
<p>The commodity is you can buy labor, which is the means of subsistence.</p>
<p>Labor power is the capacity to work inside a factory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between the two, therefore that difference will give rise to surplus.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no other commodity that has this essence of commodity and commodity power.</p>
<p>So that was his exclusivist argument.</p>
<p>In the middle of 1857, he was visited by a guy called Otto Brau in his home in Chelsea.</p>
<p>And Otto returned to Marx a copy of Hegel&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s called Phenomenology of Right,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read it, but that&rsquo;s the book.</p>
<p>And Marx was then at that stage reading through all the classical theorists again.</p>
<p>And he was, suddenly he read Hegel again.</p>
<p>And if you know Hunter S. Thompson, okay, okay.</p>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t know Hunter S. Thompson?</p>
<p>Somebody who hasn&rsquo;t had enough drugs, obviously.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But Hunter S. Thompson.</p>
<p>He comes to you in a dream after you take your first puff of&hellip;</p>
<p>Mescaline or&hellip;</p>
<p>Or whatever.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;ve all&hellip;</p>
<p>If you know your drugs well enough, you can tell, okay, he&rsquo;s stoned, okay, he&rsquo;s on cocaine,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>But suddenly, his writing style in the middle of a book called The Grundrisse completely</p>
<p>changed.</p>
<p>He switched from weed to cocaine.</p>
<p>He switched from Ricardo to Hegel, okay.</p>
<p>And what in Ricardo, he had this exclusivist argument about labor, and suddenly Hegel is</p>
<p>back talking in terms of dialectics, not actually using a word, but foreground and background</p>
<p>and tension.</p>
<p>And then he&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where this use value, exchange value, attention thing came from, is rereading Hegel</p>
<p>13 years after he stopped reading philosophy, because made in 44, he was reading just The</p>
<p>Economists.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying Karl Marx is human after all.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s human.</p>
<p>He could be&hellip;</p>
<p>I would love to have a beer with Karl.</p>
<p>For a wine.</p>
<p>For Karl?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Karl to you?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Mr. Marx to me.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be Karl to me, I&rsquo;m afraid, after all these years.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had quite a journey together.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where after Hegel, his interpretation of the dialectic comes in the form of background,</p>
<p>foreground, and background.</p>
<p>And then on page 267 of the Penguin edition of the Grundrisse.</p>
<p>What early?</p>
<p>Your memory&hellip;</p>
<p>One and a half pages long footnote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hard to forget.</p>
<p>Because when I did this, when I first read Marx way, way back when I was&hellip;</p>
<p>How old was I?</p>
<p>20.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I tried to explain my explanation of Marx&rsquo;s use value, exchange value stuff to my colleagues</p>
<p>in this philosophy discussion room at Sydney University during a beautiful summer that</p>
<p>we were inside, concrete and sandstone walls discussing Marx.</p>
<p>And I went to say, look, the use value, exchange value argument can be applied to a machine.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the exchange value of a machine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cost of manufacturing it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s its use value?</p>
<p>Its capacity to produce goods for sale.</p>
<p>No relation between the two, there&rsquo;ll be a gap, a machine can be a source of profit.</p>
<p>Now, I said that and I got laughed at and I quite literally laughed at.</p>
<p>So when I went back to university 13 years later to do my master&rsquo;s degree, I chose to</p>
<p>read through and find in Marx where he first came across this insight.</p>
<p>So my first master&rsquo;s thesis failed, by the way, and justifiably so.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the level of academic discourse necessary.</p>
<p>I had an advisor who didn&rsquo;t understand what I was writing.</p>
<p>He got me to write for his New Keynesian audience and it was a mess and it got failed.</p>
<p>So I got rid of him.</p>
<p>Did it get failed?</p>
<p>Why do you think?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a good thesis.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the level.</p>
<p>It was written for an audience my supervisor thought that I should be writing for, and</p>
<p>it was a mess.</p>
<p>And so I met another guy, Jeff Fishburne, as a lecturer at New South Wales University.</p>
<p>And Jeff was open minded.</p>
<p>He was not a conventional neoclassical thinker.</p>
<p>And I realized I&rsquo;d throw out the half that Bill had got me to do, focused just on Marx.</p>
<p>And so I decided to read Marx in chronological sequence from his very first works of economics,</p>
<p>which are called the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844.</p>
<p>And he wrote those in a garret in Paris after he&rsquo;d been expelled from Prussia.</p>
<p>And so he decided to read having been an expert on philosophy and regarded it as the towering</p>
<p>intellect of Hegelian philosophy in Prussia, but driven out because he was a radical.</p>
<p>He ended up running a newspaper or being writing for a newspaper, and he was reporting about</p>
<p>the eviction of peasants from the forests, taking away their feudal rights.</p>
<p>And so this is where his passion for economics and humanity came from.</p>
<p>And he was a poet as well.</p>
<p>I mean, he loved poetry to Jenny von Westhalen.</p>
<p>His first published works were pretty much in poetry.</p>
<p>He was a rouse about, he was a wild character.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d probably fight like crazy, I imagine, if we met.</p>
<p>Over the beers?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slightly, even though I can be, I can get involved in an argument like nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>No, really?</p>
<p>No, really.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a bit more peaceful of personality.</p>
<p>Oh, you think Marx is feistier than you?</p>
<p>He was feisty, but feisty with, he could be arrogant.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve got an intellectual arrogance, I&rsquo;ve come to accept that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s like a fundamental humility to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying Marx is like, has ego that&rsquo;s hard to control.</p>
<p>A bit too big ego, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m never going to meet him.</p>
<p>Well, the beard says ego to me.</p>
<p>The beard is huge, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is interesting.</p>
<p>So you went chronologically right through his works, the development of the human being</p>
<p>through his works.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I was trying to find the point at which he discovered this use value exchange value</p>
<p>idea.</p>
<p>And it occurs in a footnote on page 267 to 268 of the Penguin edition of the Guindrisa,</p>
<p>which his notes he was taking literally not meant for publication, literally sitting at</p>
<p>a stall inside the British Museum, I think, reading all the classical authors in chronological</p>
<p>sequence.</p>
<p>And then somebody throws Hegel at him, and suddenly he&rsquo;s talking in Hegelian terms.</p>
<p>And he suddenly says, is not, because it&rsquo;s whole value issues, what is value?</p>
<p>Is it exchange value, use value?</p>
<p>How do they relate to each other?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he was thinking about.</p>
<p>And he said, is not use value, which was left out of the classical school, a fundamental</p>
<p>aspect of the commodity?</p>
<p>Is there not a tension between the use value and exchange value?</p>
<p>Just so we&rsquo;re clear in that context, use value is kind of the subjective thing, exchange</p>
<p>value is the objective thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Marx was, found a way to integrate the two.</p>
<p>He was focused on labor being the only thing that can generate both the use value and the</p>
<p>exchange value.</p>
<p>But, no.</p>
<p>If you look at the classical school, they focus on exchange value, objective.</p>
<p>Look at the neoclassical, they focus upon use value, subjective, or they call it utility.</p>
<p>So Marx, coming from the Ricardian tradition, basically dismissed the role of utility.</p>
<p>And then when he reads Hegel, he&rsquo;s suddenly starting to think in terms of unities.</p>
<p>And exchange value and use value is the unity of the commodity.</p>
<p>And he thinks, well, I can&rsquo;t ignore use value.</p>
<p>So rather than leaving it out completely, which is what Ricardo and Smith does, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to somehow bring it in.</p>
<p>And this Hegelian insight occurs to him.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s remarkable, I really recommend taking a look at the book, even just to look at that</p>
<p>particular page, because what it would have been, as shown as a footnote, but it would</p>
<p>have been him saying, oh, wow, and his asterisk, asterisk, is not use value, a fundamental</p>
<p>aspect of the unity of a commodity.</p>
<p>So in the notes, you see the discovery of an idea in the human mind, the integration</p>
<p>of an idea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And he actually writes, does this have significance in economics, question mark.</p>
<p>And then he probably went home that night, and that idea changed him.</p>
<p>Yeah, it changed him completely.</p>
<p>And from that point on, his writing was completely different.</p>
<p>But he still had this idea from the Ricardian days of saying that labor is the only source</p>
<p>of value, using an exclusive argument to say there&rsquo;s something unique about labor that</p>
<p>explains why it&rsquo;s a source of value.</p>
<p>But suddenly, this insight occurs to him, and he thinks, I can get a positive derivation.</p>
<p>I can use use value and exchange value and the fact they&rsquo;re not related to each other</p>
<p>as a dialectical tension to explain surplus value.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he does.</p>
<p>So he goes from a negative explanation of where value comes from to a positive explanation</p>
<p>on that page of the Guindarisa.</p>
<p>He then triumphantly uses it to explain why labor is a source of value.</p>
<p>You buy it for its exchange value.</p>
<p>You use its use value.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re unrelated.</p>
<p>The use value will be bigger.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where profit comes from.</p>
<p>Then he does exactly the same thing for machinery, about 30 pages on.</p>
<p>He says it also has to be contemplated, which was not done before.</p>
<p>This is wrote nice to himself, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written really in a colloquial style, that the use value of a machine is significantly</p>
<p>greater than its exchange value.</p>
<p>He actually left out the word is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used to be a translation into English of the German, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the original notes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see them.</p>
<p>But he says, he leaves out the word is.</p>
<p>It also has to be contemplated that the use value is significantly greater than its exchange</p>
<p>value, i.e. that the contribution of the machine to production exceeds its depreciation.</p>
<p>That was an insight which undermined his explanation for revolution.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can you say that again?</p>
<p>The cost of production exceeds its depreciation?</p>
<p>Can you linger on that?</p>
<p>Well, what Marx argued, and you read this in Capital, and I read this in Capital when</p>
<p>I first saw the contradiction in his own thought.</p>
<p>He said that no matter how useful a machine is, whether it took a hundred hours to make</p>
<p>or cost 150 pounds, it cannot under any circumstances add more to production than 150 pounds, which</p>
<p>in his old exclusivist logic he could justify, and which in his post 1857 argument is bullshit.</p>
<p>Can you steel man his case?</p>
<p>Can we go to the mind of Marx and thinking if a machine costs a hundred bucks, it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be ever more, bring more value than a hundred bucks to the world?</p>
<p>But that contradicts his previous logic, because what he said is commodities are the essential</p>
<p>unity in capitalism.</p>
<p>Capitalism focuses upon the exchange value.</p>
<p>That pushes the use value into the background, and there&rsquo;s a tension between the two.</p>
<p>What that means is the exchange value of a commodity sets its price.</p>
<p>The use value is independent.</p>
<p>He called them incommensurable.</p>
<p>He literally used the word incommensurability between exchange value and a use value, whereas</p>
<p>neoclassicals make them commensurable.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s saying exchange value and use value incommensurable, and that normally means that</p>
<p>exchange value is objective, like the number of hours it takes to make something.</p>
<p>Use value is subjective, how comfortable the chair is, the fact that you can sit in a chair.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s incommensurability, but when you apply it in production, the exchange value</p>
<p>of something is objective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how many hours it takes to make a machine or how many hours it takes to make the means</p>
<p>of subsistence for a worker.</p>
<p>The use value is also objective.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making commodities for sale, and the worker does six hours.</p>
<p>Six hours of work will make the means of subsistence for the worker, but the worker will work a</p>
<p>twelve hour day, and the six hours becomes a gap.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s incommensurability between use value and exchange value of labor, but when</p>
<p>you look at what he said about no matter how long it takes to make a machine or how many</p>
<p>pounds it costs, he&rsquo;s saying they&rsquo;re identical, and that&rsquo;s contradicting his own logic.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the use value of a machine?</p>
<p>The fact that it can produce goods for sale, exactly the same as the worker.</p>
<p>Now in my modern reinterpretation of Marx, which brings in my work on energy, I see both</p>
<p>labor and machinery as a means to harness energy and produce useful work, and they can</p>
<p>both do that.</p>
<p>In fact, they do it together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a collective enterprise.</p>
<p>Okay, so, and we&rsquo;ll go to that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no fundamental difference from an exchange value and use value perspective</p>
<p>between a human and a machine.</p>
<p>And therefore, they&rsquo;re using the same logic that can both be a source of surplus, which</p>
<p>is what Marx contradicted because his explanation for where socialism would come from is that</p>
<p>only profit comes from, like profit comes only from labor.</p>
<p>Over time, we&rsquo;ll add more machinery than labor that will mean a falling rate of profit and</p>
<p>therefore a tendency towards socialism.</p>
<p>And what he did in that insight in 1857 is contradict his own idea about what would lead</p>
<p>to socialism, and he couldn&rsquo;t cope with it.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s the difference between Marxian economics and Marxist political ideology?</p>
<p>The gap between the two, the overlap, the differences, what?</p>
<p>The real foundation of Marx&rsquo;s political philosophy was the economic argument that there would</p>
<p>be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall.</p>
<p>And that tendency for the rate of profit to fall would lead to capitalists battening down</p>
<p>on workers harder, paying them less than their subsistence, a revolt by workers against this,</p>
<p>and then you would get socialism on the other side.</p>
<p>So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role in</p>
<p>his explanation for why socialism would have to come about.</p>
<p>He was saying it would have to come about, or is it a good thing for it to come about?</p>
<p>He had a should, but he was trying to say it must.</p>
<p>So if you look at Marx in the history of radical thought, he was preceded by what were called</p>
<p>utopian socialists.</p>
<p>Saint Simon, even the Cadbury&rsquo;s company came out of utopian socialist, and they had an</p>
<p>idea about a perfect society in the future where people were properly rewarded, were</p>
<p>treated as human beings rather than cogs in a machine and all this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>And they said socialism should come about because it treats humans better than capitalism</p>
<p>does.</p>
<p>Marx said, I can prove that socialism must come about.</p>
<p>So he preferred, he had a utopian vision of a future society, but he thought he could</p>
<p>prove that it had to come about.</p>
<p>And the proof relied critically upon tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and that relied</p>
<p>upon labor being the only source of profit.</p>
<p>What was his utopian view?</p>
<p>So this idea from each according to his ability to each according to his needs.</p>
<p>Is that the utopian?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s utopian in the context of our modern world.</p>
<p>It says that rather than being rewarded, like Jeff Bezos gets enormous fortune, you get</p>
<p>what you need, not what you want, necessarily.</p>
<p>All needs is fulfilled.</p>
<p>It was a vision of utopia where you could be a fisherman in the morning, a poet in</p>
<p>the afternoon, and a chef at night, this paraphrasing one of his phrases.</p>
<p>So he did have a utopian vision of a future society, and he did think human creativity</p>
<p>would be much, much greater under socialism than it was under capitalism.</p>
<p>He was wrong.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s explore in different ways where he was wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a fundamental flaw in the logic, but also if we can explore high</p>
<p>level philosophical concepts of socialism too, like the dreams of a utopia.</p>
<p>So first of all, what is socialism?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another loaded term.</p>
<p>Socialism particularly in America is a very loaded term.</p>
<p>What Americans call socialist is a large amount of provision of services by the state, which</p>
<p>is commonplace in Europe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still moderately commonplace in my own home country of Australia.</p>
<p>And that Americans will call public education socialist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a total parody of the word.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, what socialism meant is the public ownership of the means of production,</p>
<p>no private ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>What is the means of production?</p>
<p>Machine factories.</p>
<p>Factories.</p>
<p>So all the goods that are produced in factories, no, the means of producing the goods is owned</p>
<p>by a centralized entity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Centrally planned.</p>
<p>This is what actually was done under Gold&rsquo;s plan under the Soviets.</p>
<p>And even with the collective farms as well.</p>
<p>You no longer own your land.</p>
<p>The state owns the land.</p>
<p>You worked on the land.</p>
<p>And this was supposed to be a utopia.</p>
<p>Now it didn&rsquo;t turn out to be one.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about maybe your ideas of why it didn&rsquo;t turn out to be one.</p>
<p>So the fascists did the same.</p>
<p>So is this fascism also central?</p>
<p>Fascism, so called national socialism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a kind of socialism.</p>
<p>So yeah, but there was no, it wasn&rsquo;t a public owner, there was public direction.</p>
<p>So the state would tell factories what to do, but there&rsquo;s still a private profit.</p>
<p>And a large part of why the Nazis succeeded was the extent to which they managed to coopt</p>
<p>major manufacturers in Germany.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know.</p>
<p>Direction versus ownership.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A dictatorial, I mean, that&rsquo;s a very particular implementation.</p>
<p>So you have to consider the full details of the implementation, but it&rsquo;s basically dictator</p>
<p>guided.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you want to take a proper vision, then you have to say it&rsquo;s the ownership of the</p>
<p>means of production by the state.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Versus the ownership by private.</p>
<p>That rules out the Nazi period.</p>
<p>Use the word that, again, they&rsquo;re bastardizing as much as Americans do in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Well, what does ownership exactly mean?</p>
<p>Well, it became incredibly complicated.</p>
<p>And this is actually the best work on this is done by recently deceased Hungarian economist</p>
<p>called Janos Kornai.</p>
<p>And Kornai tried to explain why socialism failed.</p>
<p>Because why did socialism fail in your view?</p>
<p>In his view, in Janos&rsquo;s view, in your view.</p>
<p>I think Janos is 100% correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant piece of work, so I&rsquo;m going to be really paraphrasing his view.</p>
<p>And he imagined an ideal socialist society, and there wasn&rsquo;t a Stalin, there weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>purges, and you lived up to all the ideals that Marx had for socialism.</p>
<p>So he said, but you do it in a context of an economy which is incredibly primitive,</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Because if you look at Marx&rsquo;s own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen</p>
<p>in England.</p>
<p>The advanced economies would be first to go through the revolution.</p>
<p>The socialist, the primitive economies would have to go through a capitalist transition.</p>
<p>And this is the difference between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>So the Mensheviks, when Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family, the Mensheviks</p>
<p>believed you had to go through a capitalist phase.</p>
<p>Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it becomes socialist.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go, bypass the capitalist phase, do</p>
<p>the development under socialism rather than under capitalism.</p>
<p>And this is what Yanis was actually analyzing.</p>
<p>You start from a primitive feudal economy, very little industrialization, and you want</p>
<p>to jump to an advanced industrial society from that foundation.</p>
<p>So he said what you have then for is a whole range of industries, all of which need as</p>
<p>much resources as you can get for them.</p>
<p>So you want to develop agriculture, mining, industry, every little division of it.</p>
<p>They all have legitimate demands on the resources of the country and the state.</p>
<p>That means that all your resources are fully employed and are probably over employed.</p>
<p>So you have a resource constraint in that society.</p>
<p>The easiest way to cope with a resource constraint is to produce last year&rsquo;s commodity, not to</p>
<p>innovate, not to make change.</p>
<p>So what they will give you is as you start to add, you invest so you now have the beginnings</p>
<p>of a steel industry, beginnings of a car industry, and so on, you start investing, but you continue</p>
<p>producing the same product you made last year.</p>
<p>And I have a perfect personal example of that, which I&rsquo;ll throw in now if you like a pretty</p>
<p>heavy conversation.</p>
<p>I know my first major girlfriend had a brother who wanted to get a motorbike, but he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>afford a Honda or a Kawasaki.</p>
<p>At the time, they cost about $3,000 for a 650 cc Japanese motorbike.</p>
<p>He found he could buy a Cossack for $650, $1 per cc.</p>
<p>So I was there when he got this is in suburban Sylvania waters in Sydney.</p>
<p>So this crate arrives with a Cossack motorbike inside it.</p>
<p>So we take it apart, it&rsquo;s then got all these wooden palings, we have to pull off the wooden</p>
<p>palings to open it up.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s oil soaked rag over this thing, which is tied on a wooden base.</p>
<p>We take the oil soaked rag off and we stare in all its glory in a 1942 BMW.</p>
<p>It was exactly the same as Steve McQueen in The Great Escape.</p>
<p>So the Russians for 30 years were making the same bloody motorbike.</p>
<p>It had a bicycle seat.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how they cope.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve just made the same damn machine every year.</p>
<p>And he said, so that&rsquo;s the outcome.</p>
<p>You actually want the best possible world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to build as fast as possible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying workers as high wages as you possibly can.</p>
<p>And that leads to a world where you don&rsquo;t innovate.</p>
<p>But he said capitalism, on the other hand, pure capitalist economy, you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>pay workers as little as possible.</p>
<p>You have competitive industries.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to take demand away from your rivals.</p>
<p>You have Kawasaki versus Honda versus BMW, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The way you get demand away from your competitors is by innovating.</p>
<p>So what you will get is cycles and booms and slumps, but you&rsquo;ll innovate and change over</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>So what you find was this huge gap between socialist volume production with no innovation</p>
<p>and capitalism with innovation.</p>
<p>So that was the fundamental failing that Janos Korneis saw, so why did socialism not innovate?</p>
<p>Because if you go back to this famous historical incident with Khrushchev in the United Nations,</p>
<p>bangs Texophe Shewan, bangs the desk, says, we will bury you.</p>
<p>He literally meant we&rsquo;re going to bury you in commodities.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to produce more output than you are.</p>
<p>And he was wrong.</p>
<p>Because fundamentally, in the long term, to bury somebody in commodity production, you</p>
<p>have to innovate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also another remarkable Soviet engineer who was given the job of interpreting</p>
<p>Marx&rsquo;s ideas of industrial sectors.</p>
<p>So he had the commodity sphere, the industry sphere, sector one, sector two, sector three.</p>
<p>Sector one producing consumer goods, sector two producing capital goods, sector three</p>
<p>producing luxury goods for capitalists.</p>
<p>And so he had a three sector model of the economy, and he was talking about the dynamics</p>
<p>between them.</p>
<p>And what Feldman did was reinterpret this as an engineer would reinterpret it, which</p>
<p>was brilliant work.</p>
<p>So what he said was, you need to produce the means of production.</p>
<p>If you want to grow quickly, you focus on producing the means of production rather than</p>
<p>commodities.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t make cars, you make car factories.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>You make a few cars, but most of the effort goes into expanding how many factories you</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>And what he did was do a mathematical model where you start off with very low levels of</p>
<p>consumer good output, but then you would just go exponential.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Now, I took a look at that back when I was doing my master&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>And the training in mathematics, I took Feldman&rsquo;s equations and then looked at what was actually</p>
<p>driving it was he was imagining correctly a huge pool of unemployed labor.</p>
<p>If you go back to the earliest stages of Soviet industrialization back in 1917, post the Second</p>
<p>World, post the First World War, you had all these unemployed workers, you had all these</p>
<p>peasants you could take off the land and put into factories.</p>
<p>So you had a huge supply of workers.</p>
<p>What you had to do was build the factories.</p>
<p>See building the factories, but at a certain point you exhaust the supply of lowly employed</p>
<p>or unemployed labor.</p>
<p>And so rather than having this exponential takeoff, you hit a ceiling and then you can</p>
<p>only grow as fast as the population because you&rsquo;re not innovating.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what actually hit the Soviet system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why they never buried the Western consumer goods.</p>
<p>And instead why Western consumers looked in envy at the goods being purchased by their</p>
<p>Western people and said, if that&rsquo;s exploitation, we want exploitation.</p>
<p>So okay, there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting stuff to ask here, which is, so Marx&rsquo;s vision for</p>
<p>the socialist utopia is you have to go through capitalism.</p>
<p>The Mensheviks were true to Marx&rsquo;s original idea.</p>
<p>So is there a case to be made that in the long arc of human history on like human civilization</p>
<p>on earth that we&rsquo;re going to live out Marx&rsquo;s vision for utopia, which is like, will we</p>
<p>run into a wall with capitalism?</p>
<p>I think we are running into a wall with capitalism.</p>
<p>In fact, I think we&rsquo;ve already gone through the wall and we haven&rsquo;t yet realized we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>smashed our skulls.</p>
<p>But on the other side, we&rsquo;re bleeding and everything like that.</p>
<p>Does Marx have any insights on what the other side of capitalism, what is beyond capitalism?</p>
<p>I think that beautiful phrase of from each according to his ability to each according</p>
<p>to his needs describes what we should end up with.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually, if I think about, you know, I&rsquo;m an Elon Musk fan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think is partially going to be the nature of society if we build one that</p>
<p>functions on Mars.</p>
<p>Because and I&rsquo;ve actually seen the interview with the Italian who&rsquo;s involved in designing</p>
<p>what the future colony will look like.</p>
<p>He was actually asked this question, can there be enormous inequality in Martian civilization?</p>
<p>The guy said, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Because the resources, again, resource constraint applies.</p>
<p>You simply can&rsquo;t give somebody underground bunker 100 times the size of somebody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>100 underground bunker.</p>
<p>Because the scarcity of resources imposes a need for equality overall.</p>
<p>Is that always?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, the scarcity of resources, wait, but I feel like that&rsquo;s a contradiction.</p>
<p>I thought.</p>
<p>Are you thinking neoclassical about scarcity?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m barely thinking at all.</p>
<p>So wait, I thought scarcity, the best way to build on top of scarcity is a capitalist</p>
<p>type of machine.</p>
<p>No, this is where, again, our vision of what scarcity is, is wrong.</p>
<p>Because and Ricardo said this, but it&rsquo;s actually better than Marx.</p>
<p>Because Ricardo said, there are some products whose value is determined entirely by their</p>
<p>scarcity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Paintings, rare wines, et cetera, et cetera, they are things you cannot reproduce in a</p>
<p>factory.</p>
<p>He said, the essence of capitalism is what you can make in a factory.</p>
<p>And therefore, for these unique objects, these rare objects, Picasso painting a beautiful</p>
<p>bottle of wine, et cetera, et cetera, then the utility, it can&rsquo;t be reproduced easily.</p>
<p>So its price will be determined by subjective valuation.</p>
<p>He said, what we&rsquo;re talking about in capitalism is the stuff you can make en masse.</p>
<p>And that is the true focus of the capitalist economy.</p>
<p>And that is not about scarcity.</p>
<p>That is about, the only scarcity applies when you don&rsquo;t have the resources to make them</p>
<p>anymore or you can&rsquo;t use the energy involved because you&rsquo;ll damage the biosphere too much,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve already done.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, the scarcity that neoclassicals have been able to think about and Austrians</p>
<p>think about as well is nonreproducible.</p>
<p>But the essence of capitalism is the commodity, the backscratcher, the two buck backscratcher,</p>
<p>anybody can, you know, the cheapest chips to make, and that&rsquo;s why it can make a profit</p>
<p>out of them.</p>
<p>Not the elaborate gold thing with diamonds and rubies that only the king gets.</p>
<p>So we think our vision of scarcity has been perverted by neoclassicals analyzing the exception</p>
<p>to capitalism and calling it capitalism.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>So, you know, let&rsquo;s put Mars aside because I think there&rsquo;s a lot of strange factors that</p>
<p>have to do with a whole nother planet, civilization, that we don&rsquo;t quite understand.</p>
<p>Think how economics works with different geographic locations, one of which have new challenges,</p>
<p>which is what essentially this is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can apply the same economic theory.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying your question, I think we&rsquo;ll be forced into that ultimately by having to</p>
<p>make a compromise with the ecology.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been ruthless about the ecology of this planet, and we&rsquo;re going to pay the</p>
<p>price for it.</p>
<p>So if you have a planet where you can&rsquo;t be ruthless, okay, you have to mind it as carefully</p>
<p>as possible, then that utopian might be imposed upon you for the needs for survival on that</p>
<p>planet.</p>
<p>Back here, Marx&rsquo;s utopia was still the one that ignored the ecology.</p>
<p>And I think if I have a vision of a utopia in future, it&rsquo;s got bugger all to do about</p>
<p>what humans get out of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what humans respect.</p>
<p>They have to respect life.</p>
<p>So I see that as a one eyed utopia, a utopia for a single species, as if it can exist on</p>
<p>its own, which we should know it can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Quick bathroom break?</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be great.</p>
<p>We took a little bit of a break and now we&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>We needed to take a break because my brain broke and I&rsquo;m piecing it back together.</p>
<p>You mentioned ecology and life and the value of all of that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to it if we can.</p>
<p>But first, we said why this kind of, this idea of why socialism failed, can we linger</p>
<p>on this a little bit longer in how did the ideas of Karl Marx lead to Stalinism?</p>
<p>So this particular implementation, is there something fundamental to these ideas that</p>
<p>leads to a dictator and that leads to atrocities?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the mechanism of the bureaucracy that&rsquo;s built that leads to a human</p>
<p>being that&rsquo;s able to attain, integrate absolute power and then start abusing that power?</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like some of the history of the 20th century, is that inextricably connected to the ideas</p>
<p>of Karl Marx?</p>
<p>I think to some extent it is, but I&rsquo;m going to also say that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the</p>
<p>Bolsheviks interpreting Marx and saying we can reach socialism without going through</p>
<p>capitalism, then it might not have happened.</p>
<p>So if you look at the, like the Mensheviks were a rival political group in Russia and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where Hyman Minsky, who&rsquo;s a huge inspiration for me.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s an economist who was maybe, can we take a little attention, who was Hyman Minsky?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hyman Minsky was the person who developed an analysis of capitalism based on financial</p>
<p>instability.</p>
<p>And he was actually the PhD student of Joseph Schumpeter and an Austrian economist as well</p>
<p>whose name I&rsquo;ve forgotten temporarily.</p>
<p>And he asked him, his parents were both refugees from Russia during the Stalinist period because</p>
<p>the Mensheviks were being wiped out in Russia, just like any other opponents to the Bolsheviks</p>
<p>were being eliminated.</p>
<p>So I think his parents met in Chicago, still remain socialist, still remain politically</p>
<p>active, and he was educated in a family that was just imbued with Marx as his vision.</p>
<p>He ended up fighting in the Second World War on the American side, coming back to America</p>
<p>and studying mathematics and then also doing an economics degree leading to a PhD.</p>
<p>And the question he posed for himself is what causes Great Depressions?</p>
<p>And he put it beautifully, he said, can it happen again, it being the Great Depression?</p>
<p>And if it can&rsquo;t happen, then what has changed between the society before the First and Second</p>
<p>World War and after that makes a depression impossible?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the answer to those two questions?</p>
<p>Can it happen again?</p>
<p>His answer was yes, it can happen again, but what has prevented it happening by the time</p>
<p>he started writing about it, which was the late 50s to the mid 80s, late 80s.</p>
<p>We met once, but only once.</p>
<p>Over a beer?</p>
<p>No, he gave a seminar at New South Uni and he&rsquo;s a bit of an obstreperous bastard.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>A stripper?</p>
<p>Obstreperous.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>It means argumentative and likely to dismiss you.</p>
<p>So like a good mate of mine was the guy who brought him out to Australia, a guy called</p>
<p>Graham White.</p>
<p>G&rsquo;day, Graham.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still good mates.</p>
<p>G&rsquo;day, Graham.</p>
<p>I love your language and your accent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great&hellip;</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s a really good TikTok I saw earlier today with an Aboriginal guy saying</p>
<p>he loves the Australian language because it&rsquo;s absolutely ironic.</p>
<p>You ask an Australian a question and he&rsquo;ll give you an answer, which is the opposite</p>
<p>of what he means, and you&rsquo;ve got to work out the rest for yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he goes up to another Aboriginal mate and says, G&rsquo;day, mate.</p>
<p>He says, how are you?</p>
<p>Oh, not bad.</p>
<p>What have you been doing recently?</p>
<p>Oh, not much.</p>
<p>When are we going?</p>
<p>Not too far?</p>
<p>Not too soon?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>Oh, not too far away?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All negatives.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a beautiful, beautiful rendition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the cool thing about the internet culture.</p>
<p>They appreciate that ironic side.</p>
<p>Like for example, the best compliment you can give as an Aboriginal to somebody else</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s deadly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s deadly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a compliment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s deadly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got another mate of mine and this comes to the Australian language.</p>
<p>If I call you a bastard, that&rsquo;s a compliment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Depending on how I insinuate the word bastard.</p>
<p>Bastard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s deadly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something, unfortunately, there&rsquo;s something about the British accent that makes</p>
<p>people sound maybe brilliant, maybe sophisticated, wise.</p>
<p>But actually pompous.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s unfortunately the downside of that is you can sound pompous.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the Australian accent that you just can&rsquo;t sound brilliant.</p>
<p>It humbles you.</p>
<p>You sound like you&rsquo;re having a lot of fun.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all that good stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you just can&rsquo;t be like Karl Marx in an Australian accent would just not come off.</p>
<p>That is a very good point.</p>
<p>He would not be able to pull off the beard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that the accent determines something about the person.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the chicken and the egg too.</p>
<p>It drives the way of the discourse.</p>
<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s a lot of brilliance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of brilliance in your work, but it sounds like you&rsquo;re always having fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And look, this, Pat Poncho has got a lot of Australian mates here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He spent, what about, how long in Australia?</p>
<p>Year and a half.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got all these mates here who play Aussie rules football in Austin.</p>
<p>You should join them one day.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a very creative sport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different than rugby?</p>
<p>Oh, very.</p>
<p>Rugby is hopeless.</p>
<p>Rugby is two morons smashing their bodies against each other.</p>
<p>Easy now.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>We did not mean to offend the rugby fans in the audience.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s too simplistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too simplistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, there&rsquo;s skill in it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some really skillful rugby union and rugby league players in my day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it, fundamentally, if you hit somebody hard enough, they go down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Whereas in Aussie rules, it&rsquo;s about catching the ball and then kicking the ball and pass.</p>
<p>More skill, less pass.</p>
<p>More skill.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, and the bodies of the athletes, I can actually get off and measure what a sport</p>
<p>is like by the bodies it creates.</p>
<p>And you get these incredibly elegant lithe muscular forms out of Aussie rules.</p>
<p>Such beautiful words you have in your vocabulary, lithe, I don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll assume you know what it means and maybe somebody in the audience.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, all right, fine, fine.</p>
<p>We should also mention that you, in your youth, you know, like last year, have had Olympic</p>
<p>weightlifting as part of your life.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>A long time ago.</p>
<p>And like you said, tennis.</p>
<p>I also played tennis for many, many, many, many years.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite game.</p>
<p>Karl Marx and Stalin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how do we get onto Aussie football in Australia and the accent?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure you talked about the way I said something about Karl Marx and with</p>
<p>Karl Marx.</p>
<p>Anyway, we got there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We got there and now we return.</p>
<p>But back to Marx.</p>
<p>I think&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the destination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the journey.</p>
<p>I think Marx, the failure of socialism with Janos Kornei captured beautifully.</p>
<p>This idea already called demand constrained versus resource constrained economies.</p>
<p>And capitalism is demand constrained.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And this is, again, where neoclassical theory is completely wrong, empirically completely</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>So the neoclassicals have a vision of capitalism being resource constrained, and it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>maximizing your usage of resources subject to constraints.</p>
<p>And as Kornei said, that&rsquo;s really what happened to socialism.</p>
<p>What happens under capitalism is that you have 15, 20 companies producing automobiles.</p>
<p>They are all trying to capture as much of the market as they can.</p>
<p>If you add up their marketing plans, you&rsquo;re going to get 120, 130% of the actual market.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re all going to have excess capacity.</p>
<p>When you build a factory, you&rsquo;re building it with a plan for it to exist for five, 10,</p>
<p>15 years.</p>
<p>You have to have excess capacity in the factory.</p>
<p>So that means that capitalism has far greater productive capacity than it actually uses.</p>
<p>And then the way that you manage to get demand into your factories to innovate and produce</p>
<p>something nobody else does, or you&rsquo;re producing in volume and when somebody produces like</p>
<p>a bung tire, comes out of Firestone, then Goodyear is ready to expand its production</p>
<p>and take advantage of that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the actual nature of competition in capitalism.</p>
<p>And that means that we get a cornucopia of goods, even if we&rsquo;re lowly workers.</p>
<p>The variety of goods in capitalism is overwhelming, and that just doesn&rsquo;t happen in socialism.</p>
<p>You get your 1942 Cossack as your motorbike, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>When you put your money down to buy a refrigerator, it&rsquo;ll arrive in 10 years because the factory&rsquo;s</p>
<p>already fully constrained.</p>
<p>So all these resource constraints mean that people aren&rsquo;t happy under socialism.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of people that aren&rsquo;t happy, then the best way to control</p>
<p>them is to suppress them.</p>
<p>So I think in that sense, ultimately, yes, it does lead to something like Stalinism.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier to give happy people freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, happy people get pretty silly outside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly, the extent to which Americans overuse and distort the word freedom</p>
<p>drives me balmy.</p>
<p>All of these words can be distorted, but they all, at the core, have some fundamental power</p>
<p>and beauty, and then we just distort on the surface for the fun of it, just to start battles</p>
<p>on Twitter and so on.</p>
<p>But what citizens of the Soviet world didn&rsquo;t feel was freedom.</p>
<p>Not just in, first of all, it wasn&rsquo;t freedom to buy commodities.</p>
<p>The commodities that were supposed to be on the shops weren&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>The volume couldn&rsquo;t be produced.</p>
<p>And what you then got out of that as well was the classic Soviet joke, they pretend</p>
<p>to pay us and we pretend to work.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re not motivated.</p>
<p>Oh, look, I went to Cuba about eight years ago, invited to give a talk there.</p>
<p>And staying in a hotel itself, the hotel&rsquo;s a story.</p>
<p>There was one day my meetings were canceled, so I thought I might go down to the beach.</p>
<p>And in the hotel, they had a wing, which is the tourist office, and there were three women</p>
<p>working inside the office.</p>
<p>So I thought I&rsquo;d just go up and ask them, you know, how do I get to the beach?</p>
<p>And one of them says to me, and I stood there, just stood in the room, waiting to see if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d make eye contact with me.</p>
<p>Three women, nobody else in the place.</p>
<p>None of them looked at me.</p>
<p>So I finally went up to one of them and said, I want to go to the beach and do some surfing</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>She said, I can get a taxi outside.</p>
<p>Now, fundamentally, she was saying, well, I&rsquo;m being paid shit money here, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to work, I&rsquo;m not going to do anything apart from sit here and qualify for my time.</p>
<p>And as much as there are reasons the Cubans have suffered from American embargoes and</p>
<p>all that sort of stuff, you&rsquo;ve still got that fundamental shortage economy that Cornet spoke</p>
<p>about coming out of the structure of central ownership and central control of distribution</p>
<p>and investment.</p>
<p>It breaks my heart because I think some of the effects of that persist throughout time.</p>
<p>It become part of the culture too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>Negative culture.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, from the Western perspective.</p>
<p>Well, even from the people living through it.</p>
<p>I mean, I had enough conversation with Cubans, you know, meeting them on the street, hopping</p>
<p>in a cab.</p>
<p>There was one guy I was talking to, he was an industrial chemist and he&rsquo;d got a bit of</p>
<p>money being a cab driver because he could make money out of taking foreign tourists</p>
<p>from the airport to the city.</p>
<p>By the way, this episode is brought to you by delicious Coca Cola.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want to have it on camera, but anyway.</p>
<p>No, maybe they&rsquo;ll actually sponsor.</p>
<p>You want to make sure you rotate the label to show, this is capitalism.</p>
<p>What are we talking about here?</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s red.</p>
<p>Red and black is actually anarchist.</p>
<p>I should tell you, I don&rsquo;t know if you know who Michael Malice is.</p>
<p>Michael.</p>
<p>Michael Malice.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an anarchist and he lives next door.</p>
<p>Does he?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve lost touch with anarchist philosophy.</p>
<p>I actually used to read, you know, Kropotkin and Bakunin and so on, and I enjoyed their</p>
<p>philosophy and then I helped organize an anarchist conference once, and that was the</p>
<p>biggest antidote possible to being an anarchist.</p>
<p>That sounds like an entry point to a joke, helped to organize an anarchist party.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I mean, we literally spent three days arguing over whether there should or should not be</p>
<p>a chairperson for conversations.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that may be that.</p>
<p>Monty Python&rsquo;s Life of Brian lived out live.</p>
<p>Look at the bright side of life.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So part of that explains why, for example, even to this day, in some of those parts of</p>
<p>the world, entrepreneurship does not flourish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a spirit in the people to start businesses, to launch new endeavors and all</p>
<p>those kinds of things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just taking all kinds of strange little strolls, but how do you explain the mechanisms</p>
<p>of China today, where there&rsquo;s quite a bit of sort of flourishing of businesses and so</p>
<p>on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very peculiar kind of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>They got away from central control, but they still manage central political control, but</p>
<p>diversified economic control.</p>
<p>So you could, it is possible to draw a line between politics and economics.</p>
<p>It is possible, and I think in some ways, China&rsquo;s more likely to survive as a society</p>
<p>going into the future than Western capitalist societies are.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, if we do the Karl Marx, the foreground and the background, you can centralize</p>
<p>the politics, the humanity, the subjective stuff, and then distribute the objective stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to have the goods, and the big change from Mao Zedong Xiaoping was the characterizing</p>
<p>that little saying that I don&rsquo;t care whether you have a black cat or a white cat, so long</p>
<p>as it catches mice.</p>
<p>And there was a level of pragmatism to the Deng Xiaoping revolution over Mao and Madame</p>
<p>Mao in particular, and that was manifest in the desire to get as much of those Western</p>
<p>goods as possible.</p>
<p>And I was actually in China in 1981, took a group of journalists there, as I mentioned</p>
<p>earlier, for a tour, and we ended up going to the Sichuan Free Trade Zone, and that gave</p>
<p>us an idea of why China was going to succeed, because they had a rule that you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just come in and exploit the cheap wages, you had to also have a Chinese partner, and</p>
<p>within five years, the Chinese partner had to earn 50 percent of the business, which</p>
<p>is huge.</p>
<p>And that gives you an idea of the reduction in wages these American corporations were</p>
<p>looking at.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d shut down the factory in what&rsquo;s now the Rust Belt of America that might be paying</p>
<p>somebody there at that time maybe $2 an hour, and they come across to China and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>paying two cents an hour.</p>
<p>So the enormous amount of wages that they dropped, they were willing to forego half</p>
<p>the profits and the ownership of the firm.</p>
<p>So what the Chinese were doing wasn&rsquo;t just exploiting their labor force, it was also</p>
<p>building a capitalist class, and that meant that you had this, that&rsquo;s where all the Chinese</p>
<p>corporations have come from.</p>
<p>So they were building a capitalist system within a socialist command political system,</p>
<p>and that worked, and it&rsquo;s still working.</p>
<p>So there was the centralization of the economic stuff, the Gosplan approach.</p>
<p>I think that was where the Soviets failed.</p>
<p>And what the Chinese realized after what they went through under Mao was you have to have</p>
<p>that capitalist period, but they weren&rsquo;t going to abandon the communist control politically</p>
<p>of the country at the same time.</p>
<p>And that worked out brilliantly, and there&rsquo;s a huge amount of innovation taking place in</p>
<p>China today.</p>
<p>And they also will do gigantic infrastructure projects, breathtaking planning going into</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>You would have seen videos of building a skyscraper in a day.</p>
<p>The planning that has to go into that, the pre preparation that&rsquo;s necessary is enormous.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a real respect for engineers as well in that society, which does not apply</p>
<p>on the West.</p>
<p>What do you think about, from the Western perspective, the destructive effects of centralized</p>
<p>control of the populace, of the ideas of the discourse, of the censorship and the surveillance,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like we were talking about Russia to some extent beforehand, with centralized</p>
<p>versus decentralized corruption.</p>
<p>And when you had the centralized political stuff, it means you know you can&rsquo;t criticize</p>
<p>within China.</p>
<p>But so long as you don&rsquo;t criticize, you can do what you like.</p>
<p>And how destructive is that to the human spirit?</p>
<p>From the American perspective, that feels destructive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to China quite a few times over my life, a lot in the last, not for about</p>
<p>four years, but for the six years before that, a few visits.</p>
<p>And staying in second and third and fourth tier cities, so populations of only four million</p>
<p>people, which is quite small on Chinese standards.</p>
<p>And I had a lot of happy people that I was interacting with.</p>
<p>My girlfriend at the time, her social circle.</p>
<p>And you can feel when people can&rsquo;t discuss a political issue.</p>
<p>For example, in Thailand, you can&rsquo;t discuss the king.</p>
<p>They still have, you know, les majestes laws, so you can actually be jailed for discussing</p>
<p>the king.</p>
<p>And you can feel that to some extent, and it is a political issue in Thailand now.</p>
<p>But in China, what I got back from most people, it was a bit like a benevolent big brother.</p>
<p>But then when you get things out like the lockdown, which was applied recently, then</p>
<p>you get the failings of the Soviet system is still there in the Chinese system.</p>
<p>In that, the easiest way to avoid criticism as an underling carrying out instructions</p>
<p>of people above you is to carry those instructions out to the letter beyond what the people actually</p>
<p>want you to do at the top.</p>
<p>So we had a classic illustration of that when I took these journalists.</p>
<p>There was a news report saying that China&rsquo;s output of light industry had grown by 17 percent</p>
<p>in the previous year, but heavy industry had fallen by 7 percent.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t compute.</p>
<p>So we kept on asking, why did this happen?</p>
<p>Every time we asked a question, this is back in 1981, the answer would be the initial answer,</p>
<p>we followed the directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>We finally got a guy to elaborate and say what that was.</p>
<p>He said, well, the Central Committee sent out a directive to promote light industry.</p>
<p>So what did you do?</p>
<p>Quote unquote, we stripped heavy industry factories and turned them into light industry.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s destructive of everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the overlay that you&rsquo;ve still got sitting over the top of China.</p>
<p>But a huge part of the industrialization was simply saying, produce whatever you can, make</p>
<p>goods, market them, sell them.</p>
<p>And you get that innovative component of humanity is respected and the goods turn up and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well fed.</p>
<p>Food in Russia is far better than food in America.</p>
<p>So in terms of material satisfaction and freedom, for example, enjoy dancing.</p>
<p>We went to, I think, somewhere in Shanghai, and there&rsquo;s this line of people involving</p>
<p>a woman who would have been close to her 90s and a kid who was about six or four.</p>
<p>Partying it up?</p>
<p>Partying it up in the open air and doing this Chinese collective dance.</p>
<p>You have to be really careful about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So in terms of measuring the flourishing of a people by looking at their happiness, I</p>
<p>have so many thoughts on this, but I&rsquo;m imagining North Korea.</p>
<p>And if you talk to people in North Korea, I think they would say they&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, let me try to complete this argument, not an argument, but a sort of challenge to</p>
<p>your thought, which especially in the bigger cities, because they don&rsquo;t know the alternative.</p>
<p>So what else do you need?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough food on the table.</p>
<p>We have a leader that loves us and we love him.</p>
<p>Our hearts are full of love.</p>
<p>Our table is full of food, they would say, because it&rsquo;s enough food.</p>
<p>What else do you want from life?</p>
<p>No, I think, okay, like that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So let me sort of chat, because like&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an alternative.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve spent time in Romania.</p>
<p>So let me sort of complete that, sorry.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m taking the most challenging aspect.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s centralized control of information, that you don&rsquo;t know the alternative, that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know how green the grass is on the other side.</p>
<p>And so your idea of happiness might be very constrained.</p>
<p>So you could also argue that is happiness, if you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss.</p>
<p>And then so is happiness really the correct measure for the flourishing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>But I mean, there&rsquo;s actually a classic book, a movie as well, called Mao&rsquo;s Last Dancer.</p>
<p>And that is a young man explaining his progression from being a dancer in the Cultural Revolution</p>
<p>through to a leading dancer in American and ultimately Australian ballet.</p>
<p>And he explicitly says at one point that he&rsquo;s told that the Chinese people have the highest</p>
<p>standard of living in the world.</p>
<p>And the reaction of him and his kids, like his fellow six year olds, is, God, it must</p>
<p>be miserable elsewhere in the world then.</p>
<p>So they knew.</p>
<p>They still know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as that complete ignorance.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m talking about is experiences in China say back in about 2016, 2014, there</p>
<p>was a feeling of freedom within limits that you didn&rsquo;t want to transgress because the</p>
<p>system was working.</p>
<p>So if you like, it&rsquo;s kind of like marriage, it&rsquo;s kind of like marriage, hey, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s limits.</p>
<p>You can have fun within those limits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And people did have fun and they did feel free, but they didn&rsquo;t want to go and get divorced.</p>
<p>But that dilemma was accommodated because the boundaries, until you started hitting</p>
<p>restrictions were wide.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And like when you look at it, I mean, look at the, again, with the Chinese Communist</p>
<p>Party, the administrators of that are often highly qualified engineers who can then make</p>
<p>intelligent decisions about what should be done as infrastructure and so on.</p>
<p>And you go to China and you&rsquo;ve got incredible high speed rail, fantastic infrastructure,</p>
<p>internet, telecommunications and so on, rapidly evolving solar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a range of things there that are so well done that reflect the fact that the selection</p>
<p>process that gives you your political elite is partially focused upon sucking up, et cetera,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still there, but it&rsquo;s also focused upon your skill levels.</p>
<p>And you get people making decisions who damn well know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Like Australia&rsquo;s got a classic example, the internet in Australia sucks.</p>
<p>The reason it sucks is that the Labour Party, which is our version of the Democrats, was</p>
<p>in control during the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>And as part of that, they wanted to bring in optical fiber connections to the house.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have an optical fiber backbone and an optical fiber right to your T100 output</p>
<p>from your home.</p>
<p>And the Liberal Party fought that and said, that&rsquo;s going to be too expensive, it&rsquo;d take</p>
<p>too long to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do cable to the node and then have a copper network linking from a node</p>
<p>on a street to all the houses in the street.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be cheaper and faster, have it more soon, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>It was a total technical fuck up.</p>
<p>And Australia now has internet that&rsquo;s about 50 or 60 years fast in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dreadful for the internet.</p>
<p>Two political figures made that decision, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, rivals and</p>
<p>leaders of the Conservative Party we call Liberal over there.</p>
<p>Now that was shitty decisions that wouldn&rsquo;t happen in a country like China because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got actual engineers making the decisions.</p>
<p>They say you can&rsquo;t get decent speed if you link optical fiber to copper.</p>
<p>So what you get is even though you can&rsquo;t make the decisions yourself, a vast majority of</p>
<p>the decisions are made intelligently and therefore you expect it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, but don&rsquo;t you worry about the corrupting aspects of power?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>That you start, you know, you have engineers making intelligent decisions, but at which</p>
<p>point does the fat king start saying, oh, these engineers are annoying.</p>
<p>I have good internet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Bring me the grapes.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, you know, you get your colligular effects.</p>
<p>That can happen.</p>
<p>Like Z from what I&rsquo;ve seen has got elements of that.</p>
<p>So friends of mine who are Caucasians can get away with it.</p>
<p>They have a game that they play at conferences, scoring how often people use with Z&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>in a presentation and giving extra points for the number of photographs of Z that turn</p>
<p>up in the whole thing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this sort of personality cult coming along as well.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the planning for the infrastructure that&rsquo;s being built, the social</p>
<p>services, the general freedom that exists is so great.</p>
<p>And like any Chinese person alive today, like somebody who&rsquo;s Chinese my age, would have</p>
<p>been an adult under the early period of, the late period of Mao.</p>
<p>And God almighty, the change, the improvement they&rsquo;ve seen in their lives, that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>think about.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the, if you just look at the history of the 20th century, your intuition would</p>
<p>say that some of the mechanisms we see in China now will get you into trouble in the</p>
<p>long term.</p>
<p>So it seems to be working really well in many ways in terms of improving the quality of</p>
<p>life of the average citizen in China, but you start to get worried about how does this</p>
<p>go wrong?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>But at the same time, maybe, I mean, often people will say, you know, what&rsquo;s your vision</p>
<p>for the future?</p>
<p>And what they mean is what vision for the future do you have that I&rsquo;m going to like?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What if you have a vision of the future that you don&rsquo;t like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dreadful.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the ecological crisis I think we&rsquo;re walking blindfolded into.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That part of the picture we&rsquo;ll have to talk about how fundamental of a problem that is.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But what does that have to do with the future of China?</p>
<p>What it has to do is that if you wish to impose dramatic controls on the consumption of the</p>
<p>rich, which would be necessary to reduce our consumption burden so that we can get closer</p>
<p>to the ecological envelope we&rsquo;ve destroyed already, then you&rsquo;re going to make more likely</p>
<p>successful doing that with a centralized system where people accept centralized political</p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re in a country where it&rsquo;s all diversified and you scream freedom between every point</p>
<p>in a tennis match.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve literally seen that when I was in Philadelphia some time back.</p>
<p>So the ideology that accepts a collectivist attitude may be more successful in controlling</p>
<p>our reducing human consumption levels.</p>
<p>Because when we talk about democracy, I mean, who&rsquo;s voting here?</p>
<p>How many horses and elephants and birds get to vote?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a bird?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see them around here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very human centric vision we have of this planet.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to pay a price for that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying to deal with global catastrophic events, centralized planning might be&hellip;</p>
<p>I think will work better, period.</p>
<p>But there is some centralized stuff in the United States, for example.</p>
<p>Oh, your military.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s that feisty Australian.</p>
<p>So besides the military, that&rsquo;s the ideal of the federal government in the United States</p>
<p>is that there is some centralized infrastructure building.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some big&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough of it, yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some.</p>
<p>The question is, when you deal with greater and greater global catastrophic events, like</p>
<p>the pandemic that we&rsquo;re just living through, that the government would be able to step</p>
<p>up and impose enough centralized planning to allow us to deal, sort of enable, empower</p>
<p>the citizenry to deal with these catastrophic events.</p>
<p>In the case of the pandemic, a lot of people argue that the, first of all, the world, but</p>
<p>also the United States failed to effectively deal with the pandemic.</p>
<p>On the medical side, on the social side, on the financial side, the supply chain, everything.</p>
<p>In terms of communication, in terms of inspiring the populace with the power of science and</p>
<p>all the fronts.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>They failed.</p>
<p>But the ideal is that we&rsquo;d be able to succeed.</p>
<p>You would have to have a small, efficient, the ideal, the American ideal is you have</p>
<p>a small, efficient government that&rsquo;s able to take on tasks precisely like the pandemic.</p>
<p>But the thing is, maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t have been as small as it was.</p>
<p>I mean, my favorite instance of that actually involves the UK because the whole neoliberal</p>
<p>approach is about small, efficient government.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Well, small, efficient government works when you face small, efficient challenges.</p>
<p>When you face something systemic rather than episodic, then it&rsquo;s going to break down.</p>
<p>And like this is, I mean, one of the things I greatly respect is Taleb&rsquo;s idea of antifragile.</p>
<p>You want a society which is antifragile, not easily broken, whereas neoliberalism has pushed</p>
<p>us towards this vision of efficiency, but it&rsquo;s easily snapped.</p>
<p>Like in the UK, I&rsquo;ve forgotten the government minister involved, but she was, she asked</p>
<p>her expert committee, how many, this is before, well before the pandemic, how many masks should</p>
<p>we have on hand in case of a pandemic?</p>
<p>And the answer from the experts was about a billion.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 50 masks, that&rsquo;s 20 masks per person.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s too many.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just make 50 million masks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one mask per person.</p>
<p>It was gone in a matter of a day.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And therefore that&rsquo;s why they told us, well, masks don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>You know, what they meant was we don&rsquo;t have enough masks for our health people, let alone</p>
<p>for you and the public.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to bullshit you and tell you those masks don&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>And then people don&rsquo;t wear masks and then we&rsquo;ve got enough masks, we rush up the production</p>
<p>job.</p>
<p>And by the time it comes along, people have got the skepticism about masks.</p>
<p>So who does, can you elaborate, who does the blame in that case go on to?</p>
<p>The blame comes down to the philosophy that says government should always be small.</p>
<p>No, but do you, do you really think that bigger government would be the solution to the mask</p>
<p>issue?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So let me, let me push back.</p>
<p>Sort of it&rsquo;s possible that that&rsquo;s capitalism solves that problem.</p>
<p>Well, not, not if there&rsquo;s no money in really longterm planning and capitalism.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s money, there&rsquo;s money in the, isn&rsquo;t it possible to construct, isn&rsquo;t possible for</p>
<p>capitalism to construct the system that ensures against catastrophic events?</p>
<p>Not when they&rsquo;re systemic, you can ensure against episodic events.</p>
<p>If you occasionally have a really bad storm, but in general the weather&rsquo;s not so bad that</p>
<p>all the infrastructure is being destroyed, then you can share that around on a percentage</p>
<p>basis.</p>
<p>If you have a Gaussian distribution for your events and you don&rsquo;t, the mean doesn&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>around too much and the standard deviation doesn&rsquo;t change all that much, then insurance</p>
<p>works fine.</p>
<p>But if you have an, if that&rsquo;s episodic, if you have systemic stuff where the climate</p>
<p>is changing completely and you&rsquo;re going to wipe out your agricultural capabilities, you</p>
<p>simply can&rsquo;t do insurance on that front.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make a profit out of catastrophe and capitalism.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that example of climate change, let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you mentioned that the human brain, the economy, and the biosphere are three of the</p>
<p>most complex systems we know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And you also criticize the economics community for looking at the effects of climate change</p>
<p>when measured as the effect on the GDP.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s a catastrophic thing that the biggest challenge our society, our</p>
<p>world is facing.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If the economists disagree with you, the effects on the GDP will be minor.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll deal with it when it comes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the argument against, that&rsquo;s the devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, no, it is a thing that will change our world forever in ways that we should</p>
<p>really, really, really be thinking about.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Make the case of why you disagree with the economists.</p>
<p>The case is simple.</p>
<p>Economists have made up their own numbers to say that it&rsquo;s trivial.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t even tried to make the numbers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading what the scientists write.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And what the economists have done, and like this is William Nordhaus in particular, Nobel</p>
<p>Prize winner, ex president of the American Economic Association, literally assumed that</p>
<p>a roof will protect you from climate change.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t say it in those words.</p>
<p>What he said was 87% of American industry occurs in carefully controlled environments,</p>
<p>which will not be subject to climate change.</p>
<p>Now the only things that all of manufacturing, all of services, he included mining as well,</p>
<p>meaning about open cut mining, government activities, and the finance sector, all they</p>
<p>have in common is they happen beneath a roof.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s basically saying climate affects the weather, climate is weather.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now that is not at all what is meant by climate change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing the entire pattern of the weather system of the planet.</p>
<p>For example, the most extreme form of climate change would be a breakdown in the three circulation</p>
<p>cells that exist in each hemisphere.</p>
<p>The Hadley cell, the Ferrer cell, I think it&rsquo;s called, and the polar cell, 0 to 30,</p>
<p>30 to 60, 60 to 90, those are the main bubbles, if you like, in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now if we get enough increase in the energy in the atmosphere, just like you turn the</p>
<p>temperature up on a stove and you have nice bubbles occurring in a pot of soup and then</p>
<p>turn the temperature up and they all break down and you&rsquo;ve got bubbles everywhere, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the equitable climate.</p>
<p>If that happens, then most of the rainfall is going to occur between 0 and 20 and 70</p>
<p>and 90, and the middle is going to be dry, except for extreme storms.</p>
<p>We built our societies in a period of extreme stability of the climate, and when you look</p>
<p>at the long term temperature records, it&rsquo;s up and down like a seesaw, like a sawtooth</p>
<p>blade between, say, one degree warmer than now and four degrees or six degrees cooler</p>
<p>over the last million years.</p>
<p>When you look at where we evolved, it&rsquo;s just at a turning point on the peak of one of those</p>
<p>ups and downs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve forgotten the name of the cycles, but the cycles are caused by changes in the Earth&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rotation around the sun, and so we evolved our civilization just at the top, so coming</p>
<p>up from a cold period, and then we&rsquo;re going to head down to another cold period, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when human civilization came along.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a period of about 12,000 years.</p>
<p>So across that period, the temperature has changed by not much more than half a degree</p>
<p>up and down.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re blasting it well and truly out of those confines, and my way of interpreting</p>
<p>what climate change means is the stability of that climate that enables to build sedentary</p>
<p>civilizations and not be a nomadic species is being destroyed.</p>
<p>So the challenge, and by the way, I&rsquo;m playing devil&rsquo;s advocate right here.</p>
<p>The question is, is there something fundamentally different now about human civilization that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to build technology that alleviates some of the destructive effects that we have</p>
<p>on the climate?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to find out the hard way.</p>
<p>And the uncertainty, you think, would be very costly.</p>
<p>Extremely.</p>
<p>Like, many of the trajectories we might take would be much more costly than they&rsquo;re profitable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like, when we&rsquo;re seeing some of the storms that are happening now in Europe, the ones</p>
<p>that washed away a village in Germany some time ago, the firestorm that hit Canada of</p>
<p>all places, I&rsquo;ve forgotten the name of the town that was burnt down, but enormous temperatures</p>
<p>in Canada, again, the storms that have been happening back in Australia.</p>
<p>These are all manifestations of a complete shift in the weather patterns of the planet.</p>
<p>And they can wipe out, like a village just disappears, just wiped out by unprecedented</p>
<p>rains, and this keeps on happening.</p>
<p>We are still living in a sedentary lifestyle when we&rsquo;re a nomadic species.</p>
<p>So to be able to maintain that sedentary lifestyle, we do need to engineer the planet.</p>
<p>We need to keep it within that range of plus half a degree Celsius, minus half a degree,</p>
<p>which is really what it&rsquo;s been like for the last 10,000, 12,000 years, instead we&rsquo;re blasting</p>
<p>it right out of that range.</p>
<p>And we know some of the past climates that have existed then.</p>
<p>We can model what they imply for our food production systems, for example.</p>
<p>Not the only example, but obviously crucial.</p>
<p>So when you look at what are called global climate models produced by scientists, one</p>
<p>of the examples, and it was published by the OECD last year, 2021, in the chapter on what</p>
<p>would happen if we lose what&rsquo;s called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,</p>
<p>or AMOC, and people would colloquially know that as the Gulf Stream.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what distributes heat around all the oceans of the planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a huge chain called the thermohaline circulation.</p>
<p>But the part that goes across from the equator to the North Atlantic, that&rsquo;s called the AMOC</p>
<p>and Gulf Stream colloquially, if that disappears in the context of a two and a half degree</p>
<p>Celsius increase in average global temperature, then the proportion of the Earth&rsquo;s surface,</p>
<p>which is suitable for producing wheat, will fall from 20% to 7%.</p>
<p>Proportion for corn, similar sort of fall.</p>
<p>The proportion suitable for rice will go from 2% to 3%.</p>
<p>Now that means a catastrophic, and that&rsquo;s the word used in the report, catastrophic</p>
<p>collapse in food production.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re toying with.</p>
<p>And we are one and a half, we&rsquo;re actually less than, we&rsquo;re about halfway there to that</p>
<p>two degrees, 2.5.</p>
<p>And economists, on the other hand, and this is Richard Toll, published a paper 2016, claiming</p>
<p>using what he calls an integrated assessment model that economists developed, that losing</p>
<p>the Gulf Stream would increase global GDP by 1.1%.</p>
<p>Now his model, this is what really pisses me off about these people, it&rsquo;s the worst</p>
<p>work I&rsquo;ve read in 50 years of being a critic of neoclassical economics.</p>
<p>The GCMs, the one scientists produce, of course include precipitation as well as temperature.</p>
<p>The IAMs that the economists produce, and this is stated yet again in a paper in 2021,</p>
<p>do not include precipitation, they simply have temperature.</p>
<p>So they assume that if temperature improves by moving towards a temperature which is better</p>
<p>for producing aquaculture, okay, then so will precipitation.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s completely wrong, they&rsquo;ve left out a crucial, imagine trying to model the</p>
<p>climate while ignoring the fact that there&rsquo;s rainfall.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So their work is so bad, so dreadfully bad, it should never have been published.</p>
<p>So they over, all right, all right, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna go for them, sorry, this is&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, no, no, 100% as they deserve it, so it&rsquo;s an oversimplification, but I also want</p>
<p>you to steel man people you disagree with and criticize people you agree with, if possible,</p>
<p>to be sort of intellectually honest here.</p>
<p>You do say, sort of to push back on the catastrophic thinking about climate change, that the ecology,</p>
<p>the biosphere is a complex system, economics, the economy is a complex system.</p>
<p>So how can we make predictions about complex systems?</p>
<p>How can we make a hope of having a semi confident predictions about the complex system?</p>
<p>So the scientific community is very confident about the complex system that is the biosphere</p>
<p>and the crisis that&rsquo;s before us on the horizon.</p>
<p>And then the economists are, as a community, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know what percentage,</p>
<p>but&hellip;</p>
<p>Too much.</p>
<p>Too much, that part of the community is very confident looking at the economics complex</p>
<p>system in saying that, no, this system we have of labor and money and capital and so</p>
<p>on, we&rsquo;ll be able to deal with that crisis and any other crisis.</p>
<p>And they kind of construct simplified models that justify their confidence.</p>
<p>So how do we know who to believe?</p>
<p>For a start, if you believe the economists, you need your head read.</p>
<p>Because when you&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an argument.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not an argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a summary of an argument.</p>
<p>And that is the&hellip;</p>
<p>No, that sounds a lot like an opinion and an emotional&hellip;</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so angry about it.</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;ll tell you where I stand.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve begun looking, studying the climate change much more.</p>
<p>I used to be on things I don&rsquo;t understand, have not spent time on.</p>
<p>I have so many colleagues that are scientists that I deeply respect, and I trust their opinion.</p>
<p>I have seen the lesser angels of my colleagues on the pandemic side, on the COVID side.</p>
<p>The confidence, the arrogance that in part blinded, I believe, the jump between basic</p>
<p>scientific research to public policy.</p>
<p>And then, so I&rsquo;ve become a little bit more cautious in my trust on climate change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in the same place, and I don&rsquo;t mean climate change, on anything scientists say.</p>
<p>I become a little bit, wait a minute.</p>
<p>How does the basic scientific facts of our reality map to what we should do as a human</p>
<p>civilization?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There, I want to be a little bit careful.</p>
<p>So whenever now I see arrogance and confidence, I become suspicious.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m the same, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m being angry about The Economist, because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible arrogance, incredible stupidity at the arrogance, assumptions which you look</p>
<p>at it and think, how did anybody let that get published?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the economic analysis of the effects of climate change are poor, in many cases.</p>
<p>Incredibly poor.</p>
<p>And this is like, Bjorn Lomborg styles himself as the skeptical environmentalist and criticizes</p>
<p>the environmental models.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t take a look.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t criticize the work come out by economists.</p>
<p>You look at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so bad.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do good economics modeling of the effects of climate change?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is possible.</p>
<p>Very difficult.</p>
<p>Or is it like one complex systems tech?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two modes.</p>
<p>In that case, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, like to me, what you should be looking at is saying, what are the scientists saying</p>
<p>are the consequences, probable consequences, not guaranteed, but probable consequences</p>
<p>of increasing the energy level of the atmosphere by the amount we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>What can the scientists say in terms of like, the effects, because it&rsquo;s so complicated,</p>
<p>the effects of sort of shifting resources, so basically, what are the effects of climate</p>
<p>change?</p>
<p>How can we really model that?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s basically you&rsquo;re looking through the fog of uncertainty because they&rsquo;re rising</p>
<p>sea levels.</p>
<p>How can we know what effect that has?</p>
<p>Well, we know there&rsquo;ll be a lot of change.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t actually, I think the sea level one is a poor argument, and I don&rsquo;t focus</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>What I mainly focus upon is the weather patterns, okay?</p>
<p>And if you look at, like we&rsquo;ve got the, the wheat belt in America goes through what Idaho</p>
<p>and countries, places like that, and you&rsquo;ve got an incredibly deep topsoil, like Ukraine</p>
<p>is another classic example.</p>
<p>The depth of the topsoil in Ukraine is remarkable, and that&rsquo;s the wheat bowl of Europe.</p>
<p>And that requires both the right temperature for growing wheat and the right rainfall for</p>
<p>growing wheat.</p>
<p>Now, when you look at the models that climate scientists are building of that, you have</p>
<p>pretty much, your ultimate foundation is the Lorenz model of turbulent flow.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s the first model which we saw chaos theory, complexity, that beautiful</p>
<p>simple model, three variables, three parameters, an incredible complexity out of the system.</p>
<p>But and what that meant was you also had an exponential decay in the accuracy of your</p>
<p>model over time.</p>
<p>So if you have, if you&rsquo;re accurate to a thousand decimal places, then in a thousand days, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have no data whatsoever, because each time you&rsquo;re losing an order of magnitude of accuracy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the point about the inability to predict for the very long future.</p>
<p>But what you can do is say, well, there&rsquo;s a prediction horizon.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re close enough to the, if our statistical measurement of where we are is close enough</p>
<p>to where we actually are, and our forecast horizon is narrow enough to not extrapolate</p>
<p>too far, then for this direction forward, we can make a reasonable fist of predicting</p>
<p>what the weather&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the foundation of meteorological, the stuff we watch on TV.</p>
<p>You know, most of the time, the forecasts are going to be correct these days.</p>
<p>40, 50 years ago, most of the time, the forecasts were wrong.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the background foundation to these GCMs.</p>
<p>But even they&rsquo;ve got to massively simplify the world.</p>
<p>So you have this enormous sphere of where they might divide it down to 100 kilometer</p>
<p>by 100 kilometer by 10 kilometer cube, rectangles, whatever, oblongs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re modeling the transition of where they&rsquo;re from one location to another.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got a chunky vision of the planet, which they have to.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t model it now down to the last molecule.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re losing it.</p>
<p>Not yet, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting better, better, better, better.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just too much processing power.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re going to have some confines.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go, I mean, if you look at the models to do the weather, they used to be of that</p>
<p>100 kilometer, I think they&rsquo;re about 10 kilometer grids now, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So the processing powers let us get more and more precise that way.</p>
<p>I do know that the models now include chemical mixing that occurs above cities.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve added that complexity to them over time.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking at the increasingly accurate models of weather patterns, the effect they</p>
<p>have on agriculture, on food.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s a lot of possibilities in which that&rsquo;s going to be really destructive</p>
<p>to society on the food production side.</p>
<p>And if you have that increase in temperature, you&rsquo;re going to get a change in precipitation.</p>
<p>And it could mean that where the rainfall and the sunshine are adequate for growing</p>
<p>wheat is an area where there&rsquo;s no topsoil.</p>
<p>Like a huge part of the models, the models the economists use, which only use temperature,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t include precipitation.</p>
<p>They predict that a large amount of the wheat output of the world is going to occur in Siberia</p>
<p>in the frozen tundra.</p>
<p>What about, so that&rsquo;s a straightforward criticism of oversimplified models.</p>
<p>What about the idea that we innovate our way out of it?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s totally new, what is the, there&rsquo;s a silly, poor example at this time perhaps,</p>
<p>but lab grown meat, sort of engineered food.</p>
<p>So a completely shifting source of food for civilization.</p>
<p>So therefore alleviating some of the pressure on agriculture.</p>
<p>That comes down to the difference that Elon makes between producing a prototype and mass</p>
<p>producing the prototype.</p>
<p>You can develop the idea very rapidly to put that into production on the scale that&rsquo;s necessary</p>
<p>to replace what we&rsquo;re currently doing.</p>
<p>Six years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t got years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got, we might have decades.</p>
<p>We certainly haven&rsquo;t got centuries.</p>
<p>So in the timeframe we&rsquo;ve got, I can&rsquo;t see that engineering going from prototype to production</p>
<p>levels to replace what we&rsquo;re currently doing in the stable environment they&rsquo;re currently</p>
<p>destroying.</p>
<p>What do you think about the sort of the catastrophic predictions that people that have thought</p>
<p>have written about climate have made in the past that haven&rsquo;t come to people?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mainly unfortunately involving Paul Ehrlich and the population bomb and the predictions</p>
<p>Paul was making.</p>
<p>A few individuals or the one individual in that case.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m mostly playing devil&rsquo;s advocate in this conversation and enjoying doing so.</p>
<p>I do think I&rsquo;m in agreement with the majority of the scientific community.</p>
<p>But you still see that argument made.</p>
<p>I still see the argument made.</p>
<p>And I also am a little bit worried about the arrogance and the ineffectiveness of the arrogance.</p>
<p>This is the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ineffective.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what worries me because it&rsquo;s all been put into the sort of sea level rise,</p>
<p>temperature changes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not put into the fragility of the system in which we currently live.</p>
<p>And the Earth will survive.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a wonderful science fiction book called The Earth Abides about a world in which</p>
<p>humans get wiped out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a tiny little band left and then the Earth reasserts itself.</p>
<p>So the Earth&rsquo;s going to survive us.</p>
<p>Will we survive what we do to the Earth?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>And my feeling is that we have underplayed the extent to which the civilizations were</p>
<p>built have depended upon a relatively stable climate.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s then there&rsquo;s that turning point in the global average temperature that we evolved</p>
<p>right on the top of it.</p>
<p>And if we had done nothing, we could find that heading back down towards another ice</p>
<p>age could equally destroy the possibility of sedentary life.</p>
<p>So for example, if we&rsquo;d never developed fossil fuel based industries, we&rsquo;d never built superphosphate,</p>
<p>so our population would never have reached one billion people, and we were still living</p>
<p>like fairly sophisticated animals, but like 17th century level of load on the planet,</p>
<p>then we would have gone down that decline.</p>
<p>And the approaching ice age would have started to wipe out our farming areas, the glaciers</p>
<p>would have encroached, and we would have been driven out of like an agricultural sedentary</p>
<p>civilization by that change.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just the fact that we evolved on this stable period in the overall temperature cycle</p>
<p>of the planet.</p>
<p>And that stability is something which just reflects the turning point in the regular</p>
<p>cycle of Malicevich cycle, I think it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve forgotten the actual name, but it&rsquo;s a cycle caused by change in the Earth&rsquo;s orbit</p>
<p>around the sun, reflectivity and so on.</p>
<p>That cycle, it&rsquo;s just that tiny top bit that we evolved in.</p>
<p>So what we should have done is, well, that&rsquo;s really useful for us, we should stay at that</p>
<p>level.</p>
<p>Now, if we hadn&rsquo;t done it, we&rsquo;d go back down here and that&rsquo;d be the end of our civilization</p>
<p>by an ice age.</p>
<p>Instead, we&rsquo;re going up here really rapidly, and we&rsquo;re causing a change in temperature</p>
<p>compared to that long term cycle 100,000 times faster.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, my biggest worry is even subtle changes in climate might result in</p>
<p>geopolitical pressures that then lead to nuclear war.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s an argument that&rsquo;s actually behind, to some extent, not</p>
<p>the Ukraine war so much, but the Arab Spring, the wars in Syria, which partially has led</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And our weapons are getting more and more powerful and more and more destructive.</p>
<p>More and more nations are having these destructive weapons.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re entering cyberspace, where it&rsquo;s even easier to be destructive.</p>
<p>And hyperbaric weapons, which didn&rsquo;t exist in the Second World War.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need nuclear weapons to have catastrophic attacks on each other.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s incredibly scary that the warlike side of human nature could be extremely enhanced</p>
<p>by climate breakdown.</p>
<p>So in this world, on a happy note, I don&rsquo;t know how we went from Marxism and Stalinism</p>
<p>to ecology, but all those are beautiful, complex systems.</p>
<p>What is the best form of government, would you say?</p>
<p>We talked about the economics of things.</p>
<p>You ran for office, so you care about politics too.</p>
<p>How can politics, what political systems can help us here?</p>
<p>I think we first of all have to appreciate we&rsquo;re one species on a planet out of millions.</p>
<p>And as the intelligent species, we should be enabling a harmonious life for those other</p>
<p>species as well.</p>
<p>Can we actually linger on that?</p>
<p>What is, you mentioned that we need to acknowledge the value of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Can we integrate the labor theory of value, can we integrate into that the value of life?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s human life, and there&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>If you take that structure that I talked about of Marx&rsquo;s use value, exchange value, dialectic,</p>
<p>and foreground background, that only exists, that only works because we&rsquo;re exploiting the</p>
<p>free energy we find in the universe.</p>
<p>There could be no production system without free energy, which is the first law of thermodynamics</p>
<p>that exists.</p>
<p>There is free lunch, after all, and it&rsquo;s grounded in the energy that&rsquo;s provided to us by the</p>
<p>universe.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s the free lunch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re exploiting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only free lunch we get.</p>
<p>You know Ginsburg&rsquo;s summary of the laws of thermodynamics, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Allen Ginsberg?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>The laws of thermodynamics are summarized as A, you can&rsquo;t win, B, you can&rsquo;t break even,</p>
<p>C, you can&rsquo;t leave the game.</p>
<p>Beautiful summary.</p>
<p>But the fact that it exists in the first place is the free lunch.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re exploiting the free lunch.</p>
<p>But to be able to do it, we can&rsquo;t put waste back into that system so much that it undermines</p>
<p>the free lunch.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>And once you respect the fact that we have to, living on the biosphere, the planet we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually on, we have to enable that biosphere to survive us.</p>
<p>Because if it doesn&rsquo;t survive us, we won&rsquo;t survive it disappearing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not that realization in humanity in general.</p>
<p>And when you say the value of life, you know, all the different living organisms on Earth</p>
<p>are part of that biosphere.</p>
<p>So in order to maintain the biosphere, we have to respect, like pragmatically speaking,</p>
<p>what that means is actually respecting all of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Even the mosquitoes?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some, no.</p>
<p>Parasites.</p>
<p>I mean, we are a parasite.</p>
<p>When you look at it, we&rsquo;re the mosquitoes of the large organizations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a fan of the Matrix movies at all?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m wearing.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I was wondering what the inspiration was.</p>
<p>I was thinking&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really inspiration.</p>
<p>We are living in a simulation, and I have a conversation offline to have with you about</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been misbehaving, and we&rsquo;re going to have to put you back in line.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s Agent Smith says when he&rsquo;s got Morpheus in his possession, he said, I&rsquo;ve been trying</p>
<p>to classify your species, and I&rsquo;ve decided you&rsquo;re a virus.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s truth to that.</p>
<p>We have intruded into everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve taken over every element of the biosphere, and we think we can continue doing that.</p>
<p>And the thing is, we&rsquo;re breaking that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re exporting it so much, we&rsquo;re breaking it down.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s E.O. Wilson who argued the 50 percent rule.</p>
<p>He believed that we should reserve 50 percent of the planet for nonhuman species.</p>
<p>In other words, we make 50 percent of it off limits.</p>
<p>Humans cannot go there.</p>
<p>And we just let that evolve as it does.</p>
<p>And then we control the other 50 percent.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably giving too much to us.</p>
<p>I think we should actually save like 20 percent, 25 percent max on the rest of the planet.</p>
<p>We let life go on and evolve as it does without our interference, without our dominance.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s neither a democratic system nor an authoritarian one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one which starts off with saying the first thing humans have to do is respect life</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So would we do that?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done it, obviously.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Soviets would have done it if we had a generally Soviet system.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done it under a capitalist.</p>
<p>We continue intruding.</p>
<p>So I think we have to go through something like a Star Trek, a Star Trek, you know, catastrophic</p>
<p>200 years to realize that ultimately if we&rsquo;re going to survive as a species, we have to</p>
<p>respect life in general.</p>
<p>And then that means parts of the planet we can no longer touch, while we also try to</p>
<p>maintain the planet at the temperature that we found it in what we now call the Anthropocene.</p>
<p>So politically, we have to have, like in many ways what native societies often have, a vision</p>
<p>of the cycle of life, not this exponential progression we&rsquo;ve developed over the last</p>
<p>250 years.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll use another movie, the Avatar type respect for the cycle of life.</p>
<p>We need to have that as part of our innate nature.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, the political system comes out.</p>
<p>Now that political system has to be one that lets us feel like we have a say in the direction</p>
<p>of society while that part is sacrosanct.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>But we also, because we are now living with so many challenges created by our own civilization,</p>
<p>I mean, the main threat to the existence of human civilization is the existence of human</p>
<p>civilization.</p>
<p>Is both a feature and a bug.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And therefore, we need to have people who can understand complex systems making those</p>
<p>decisions.</p>
<p>Now that means it isn&rsquo;t a political system as much as it is an appreciation that the</p>
<p>world is a complex system.</p>
<p>And therefore, effects, which we think are direct effects, will actually come through</p>
<p>an oblique fashion.</p>
<p>And we cannot, there&rsquo;s no simple linear progression from where we are to where we want to be.</p>
<p>So you have to see how everything feeds together in a systemic way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, one reason I designed this off where I&rsquo;m wearing the tshirt for now,</p>
<p>Minsky, is to have, it&rsquo;s nowhere near to this scale, I hope it one way will be, but something</p>
<p>which means we can bring together all that complexity, all those systems, and perceive</p>
<p>them on an enormous screen where we have all the various interacts and we can see what</p>
<p>a potential future is.</p>
<p>And that then guides us.</p>
<p>So it isn&rsquo;t a case of democracy and, you know, our side wins a vote and therefore we ban</p>
<p>abortion or we don&rsquo;t, you know, whatever else happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s seeing what the, respecting the fact that we&rsquo;re in a complex system, and being</p>
<p>uncertain about the consequences, and not making the bold, expansionary ideas that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing.</p>
<p>So like, being a little bit more, uh, humble.</p>
<p>Humble.</p>
<p>Humble is a good word.</p>
<p>But wouldn&rsquo;t you like to apply that same humility both to the considerations of the pros of</p>
<p>capitalism and to the catastrophic view of the effects of climate change?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also, like, I think we can afford to be bold in space.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one reason I respect the practical vision of Musk and so far impractical vision</p>
<p>of Bezos, that if we&rsquo;re going, we look for the very far future, the only way we can continue</p>
<p>expanding our knowledge of the universe is to move our civilization, the productive side</p>
<p>of off the planet.</p>
<p>Offsite backup.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So can you actually linger on this?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s actually talk about this.</p>
<p>So first of all, you have the new book, uh, humbly named, uh, named The New Economics</p>
<p>A Manifesto.</p>
<p>Publisher chose the title.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;m joking, but, um, maybe I will ask you about why Manifesto, but we&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>through some of the ideas in this book.</p>
<p>We have been already, uh, so some of it is embracing the fact that the economy, our world,</p>
<p>our mind is a complex system.</p>
<p>So this t shirt that you&rsquo;re wearing, yep, take it out, yeah, is, uh, the software I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do that.</p>
<p>There you go, there you go, you&rsquo;re wearing a, what is this, an infomercial?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a t shirt that says Minsky, um, after not, not, not my Minsky, it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>Minsky.</p>
<p>Not Hyman.</p>
<p>So no, the Hyman Minsky, not Marvin Minsky.</p>
<p>Not Marvin Minsky, right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, so AI Minsky is, is Marvin and then, uh, Harman, uh, it all rhymes.</p>
<p>So stability is free open source system dynamic software invented by Mr. Steve Keen, uh, coded</p>
<p>by Russell Standish, it&rsquo;s on SourceForge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s destabilizing.</p>
<p>Stability is destabilizing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of embracing the, the complex aspect of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how can you model the economy?</p>
<p>What are some of the interesting, whether detailed or high level, big picture ideas</p>
<p>behind your efforts of Minsky?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Minsky, um, meaning the software, the modeling software that, that models the dynamic system.</p>
<p>Basically what Minsky is doing is system dynamics modeling.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, if anybody&rsquo;s used Stellar or Vensim or Simulink, um, then they&rsquo;ve used exactly</p>
<p>the same family of software that Minsky is part of.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t invent that.</p>
<p>It was invented by Jay Forrester, who&rsquo;s one of the great intellects, one of the great</p>
<p>engineers, uh, in American history.</p>
<p>And the idea of, of, of Forrester&rsquo;s system was, uh, complex interactions.</p>
<p>So he was doing his work in the fifties, um, uh, if people don&rsquo;t know Forrester&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>he actually built the models of the, um, uh, the, the mathematics for the gun turrets on</p>
<p>American warships in the second world war mechanical systems, obviously.</p>
<p>So he had to work out, you know, how to give a feedback system that meant when the boat</p>
<p>rolled in one direction, the, the tower did not roll the other way.</p>
<p>All that stuff was his work.</p>
<p>So marvelous engineering.</p>
<p>And then he realized if you want to look at a, even like a factory, a factory is a complex</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>And so you get cycles generated out of the interaction between different components of</p>
<p>the factory that he was first involved in taming, that he built the software to model</p>
<p>complex interactive systems.</p>
<p>So Minsky is that, the thing that Minsky adds, which is unique is the Godley table.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the double entry bookkeeping.</p>
<p>So you can model the financial system, Godley, the economist, Godley, the economy, Wynn Godley,</p>
<p>another great, great man.</p>
<p>So there, there&rsquo;s like this, so you&rsquo;re modeling it as like a state diagram.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Fundamentally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it is circuit diagrams.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what engineers have been using for decades, almost a century.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re using a circuit diagram to model the economy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the, so other factories have done it.</p>
<p>What they, what they haven&rsquo;t had in the circuit diagram is a way of handling the dynamics</p>
<p>of the financial system.</p>
<p>So what the Godley table does is bring it financial flows as being everything goes from</p>
<p>somewhere and ends up somewhere.</p>
<p>So you have a positive and a negative, if you&rsquo;re looking on the liability side, a positive</p>
<p>and a positive or negative and a negative, you&rsquo;re looking at assets and liabilities side</p>
<p>and Minsky gets the accounting right for that.</p>
<p>So you can do an enormous complex model looking at the economy financially from the point</p>
<p>of view of a dozen different actors in the economy and know that the mathematics is right.</p>
<p>Even though what you&rsquo;re building is set of differential equations, which might be 50</p>
<p>differential equations with 350 terms in them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got the Godley tables right, you know the mathematics is correct.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the main innovation that Minsky adds.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re operating there at the macroeconomics level.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely macro.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not agent based.</p>
<p>And then this, I&rsquo;m just open on random page that I think is very relevant here.</p>
<p>The process, this is referring to Minsky, not the software, maybe the software.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The process can be captured in an extremely simple causal chain.</p>
<p>Capital determines output, output determines employment.</p>
<p>The rate of employment determines the rate of change of wages.</p>
<p>Output minus wages and interest payments determines profit.</p>
<p>The profit rate determines the, there&rsquo;s a very nice circuit here.</p>
<p>The profit rate determines the level of investment, which is the change in capital, which takes</p>
<p>us back to the beginning of this causal chain.</p>
<p>And the difference between investment and profits determines the change in private debt.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some nice, the Keen Minsky model and the intermittent route to chaos on page</p>
<p>86 of your book.</p>
<p>These are, do these come from the software?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was a mathematician back in 1992, August, 1992.</p>
<p>Mathematics is another amazing piece of software.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I find it, it&rsquo;s very much a programmer&rsquo;s approach to mathematics.</p>
<p>I prefer like a program called Mathcad, which is what I&rsquo;m using for all my, when I do my</p>
<p>mathematics on the computer, I write in Mathcad.</p>
<p>CAD or CAB?</p>
<p>CAD.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been ruined by bad management.</p>
<p>They chucked out all the good engineers and I&rsquo;m still using a version which is 12 years</p>
<p>old.</p>
<p>If only engineers ruled the world.</p>
<p>If only engineers, rather than this particular case, there was a bunch of marketers for CAD</p>
<p>software agreed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely a fan of engineers.</p>
<p>What are the plots that we&rsquo;re looking at here?</p>
<p>Growth rate, private debt ratio, employment versus wages, employment versus debt, income</p>
<p>distribution.</p>
<p>So this is across years, like different trade offs.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to say about the plots and the insights from those plots</p>
<p>that are generated by the software?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a particular parameter value is to give that outcome.</p>
<p>But what happened when I first simulated the model, I took a model by a guy called Richard</p>
<p>Goodwin who&rsquo;s one of the great neglected economists, American Marxist, mathematical Marxist.</p>
<p>And what he did was build a model of cycles.</p>
<p>And he actually wrote a paper called, it&rsquo;s only about a five page paper published in</p>
<p>a book and a very, very obscure conference paper.</p>
<p>And what he was doing was trying to build a model of Marx.</p>
<p>So he wrote it in 1967 and it was putting into mathematical form a model that Marx came</p>
<p>up with in 1867.</p>
<p>So it was a centenary birthday present to Marx.</p>
<p>And what Marx had argued in chapter 25, I think, of volume one of Capital, section three,</p>
<p>he built a verbal model of a cyclical system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite out of character with the rest of the book.</p>
<p>So when you read volume one of Capital, people think Marx has got a commodity view of money.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>The idea was he had like an onion, you start off on the middle level and you ignore the</p>
<p>outer layer, then you bring the outer layer and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Anyway, in this model, in volume one of Capital, he normally just assumed work has got a subsistence</p>
<p>wage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>In this little chapter, he said that if the economy is, effectively he said, the economy</p>
<p>is booming, then workers will demand wage rises.</p>
<p>And the wage rises will cut into the profit so that capitalists will not get the level</p>
<p>of profit they&rsquo;re expecting.</p>
<p>Therefore they will invest less and the economy will slump.</p>
<p>And the slump will mean workers become unemployed and have to accept wage cuts.</p>
<p>And it was a model of a cyclical economy.</p>
<p>And as it happens, Marx spent his later years trying to learn enough calculus to be able</p>
<p>to model it himself mathematically.</p>
<p>And he never managed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Marx&rsquo;s mathematical notes on calculus, which are quite fun to read if you have a</p>
<p>mathematical background.</p>
<p>Did he get far?</p>
<p>Far?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He got too caught up in the whole philosophy and never really got to build the model.</p>
<p>But what Goodman realized was a predator prey model.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The Locta Volterra model was the basis of the idea.</p>
<p>So the idea is you have a prey, and the example that Locta actually used initially was grass.</p>
<p>Grass is the prey.</p>
<p>And then you have a predator, and the predator were cows.</p>
<p>So you start off with a very few cows, lots of grass.</p>
<p>And then because of lots of grass, the numbers of cows grow.</p>
<p>And then because the cows grow, they start to eat the grass.</p>
<p>So the grass runs out, so the cows starve, and you get a cycle.</p>
<p>And what Locta was amazed by was that the cycles were persistent.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t die out.</p>
<p>So Goodman got that vision, and he then built a predator prey model.</p>
<p>And I, first of all, read Goodman and really found it really hard to follow his writing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a very good writer, but a guy called John Blatt, who was a professor of mathematics</p>
<p>at New South Wales University, wrote a brilliant explanation of Goodman&rsquo;s model in a book called</p>
<p>Dynamic Economic Systems.</p>
<p>And I read that.</p>
<p>It was superb, and he said a way he could extend this was to include finance.</p>
<p>So I thought, okay, what I&rsquo;m going to have is that what Goodman presumed is capitalists</p>
<p>invest all their profits.</p>
<p>So you get a boom when there&rsquo;s a high rate of profit because they invest all that money,</p>
<p>and then a slump when there&rsquo;s low profit because depreciation will wipe away capital and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go boom and slump.</p>
<p>So I simply added in, well, capitalists will invest more than their profits during a boom,</p>
<p>but less than their profits during a slump.</p>
<p>And that therefore means they had to borrow money to finance the gap and pay interest</p>
<p>on the debt.</p>
<p>So I ended up with a model with just three systems states, the income share, the wages</p>
<p>distribution of income between workers, capitalists, and bankers, the level of employment, and</p>
<p>the level of private debt.</p>
<p>And those three equations are fundamentally like going from the Locke to Volterra model</p>
<p>with just two equations, and therefore you get a fixed cycle, to the Lorenz model where</p>
<p>you have three.</p>
<p>And therefore what I got out of it was a chaotic outcome.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re seeing is a manifestation of chaos, complexity in those plots.</p>
<p>But one of the many fascinating parts about it was that as the level of private debt rose,</p>
<p>in my model I had capitalists being the only ones who borrowed, but the people who paid</p>
<p>for the high level of private debt were the workers.</p>
<p>The rising banker&rsquo;s share corresponded exactly to a falling worker&rsquo;s share.</p>
<p>So you can infer from that that the workers are the ones paying.</p>
<p>Effectively, the workers end up paying for it.</p>
<p>They get a lower level of wages.</p>
<p>And the basic dynamic is that capitalists, when you have a three social class system,</p>
<p>your income goes between workers, capitalists, and bankers.</p>
<p>Now in the system, the good one did, they&rsquo;re just workers and capitalists.</p>
<p>So if workers share rose, capitalists share had to fall.</p>
<p>But when you have three social classes, then capitalists share can remain constant while</p>
<p>workers fall and bankers rise.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what actually happened.</p>
<p>Because capitalists, the simple way I modeled it was there&rsquo;s a certain rate of profit at</p>
<p>which capitalists invest all their profits.</p>
<p>Above that they borrow more, below that they pay off debt.</p>
<p>So what would happen is when you got back to that point, then the level of investment</p>
<p>would be a precise share of GDP.</p>
<p>And therefore you&rsquo;d get a precise rate of economic growth.</p>
<p>But if there was a higher percentage going to bankers and offset by a lower share going</p>
<p>to workers, it didn&rsquo;t affect the capitalists.</p>
<p>So what you get is the cycles sort of diminish for a while because there&rsquo;s the income distribution</p>
<p>effect is important.</p>
<p>So the workers pay for the increasing level of debt.</p>
<p>But the other side of it was that the cycles would diminish for a while.</p>
<p>Now what you get is a period of diminishing cycles, then leading to rising cycles.</p>
<p>And technically this is known as the Pomeranville route to chaos, and it&rsquo;s one particular element</p>
<p>of Lorenzo&rsquo;s equations of fluid dynamics.</p>
<p>So what they found was in examining laminar flow in a fluid, you have a period where the</p>
<p>laminar flow got more laminar, and then suddenly it&rsquo;d start to get less laminar and go turbulent.</p>
<p>And this is what actually goes on in the model, so in my model of Minsky.</p>
<p>So what you have is a period where there&rsquo;s big berms and cycles, and then as the debt</p>
<p>level rises, the berms and slumps get smaller.</p>
<p>And that looks like what neoclassical economists call the Great Moderation.</p>
<p>So when I first modeled this in 1982, I finished up my paper, which was published in 95, with</p>
<p>what I thought was a nice rhetorical flourish, saying the chaotic dynamics of this paper</p>
<p>should warn us against regarding a period of relative stability in a capitalist economy</p>
<p>as anything more than a lull before the storm.</p>
<p>Now I thought it was a great speed of rhetoric, I didn&rsquo;t think it was going to fucking happen.</p>
<p>But it did, because you had this period from 1990 through to 2007 where there were diminishing</p>
<p>cycles, and the neoclassicals labeled that the Great Moderation, and they took the credit</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>They thought that the economy was being managed by them to a lower rate of inflation, a lower</p>
<p>level of unemployment, less instability over time, and they literally took credit for it.</p>
<p>And I was watching that and thinking, that&rsquo;s like my model running, and I&rsquo;m scared as</p>
<p>shit that there&rsquo;ll be a breakdown.</p>
<p>I ended up not working in the area for a while because I wrote Debunking Economics, and I</p>
<p>got involved in a fight over the modeling of competition in neoclassical theory that</p>
<p>took me away for about four or five years.</p>
<p>And then I got asked to do a court case in 2005, end of 2005, and I used Minsky as my</p>
<p>framework for arguing that somebody who was involved in predatory lending should be able</p>
<p>to get out of the debt they were in.</p>
<p>And I explained Minsky&rsquo;s theory, and I used this throwaway line of saying debt levels</p>
<p>of private debt have been rising exponentially.</p>
<p>And then I thought, well, I can&rsquo;t, as an expert, just make a claim like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to check the data.</p>
<p>And the debt ratio was rising exponentially, and I thought, holy shit, we&rsquo;re in for a financial</p>
<p>crisis, and somebody has to warn about it, and at least in Australia, I was that somebody.</p>
<p>So can you, given this chaotic dynamics idea, can you talk about the crises ahead of us</p>
<p>in the future?</p>
<p>So one of the things, I mean, it&rsquo;s a fundamental question of economics.</p>
<p>Is economics about understanding the past or predicting the future?</p>
<p>Because you can construct models that do poetic, like in 95, poetic, you know, yeah, and then</p>
<p>you can, you know, watch years fly by, and some of the predictions in retrospect that</p>
<p>you make turn out to be true, but, you know, all kinds of gurus throughout history have</p>
<p>done that kind of thing, and you can call yourself right and forget all the many times</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been wrong.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the future.</p>
<p>What kind of stuff, you mentioned about the importance of the biosphere, but what are</p>
<p>the crises that are ahead of us that a chaotic dynamics view allows us to predict and be</p>
<p>concerned about?</p>
<p>Getting out of it, leaving aside the ecological, wasn&rsquo;t a crisis, it was stagnation.</p>
<p>Because what we got out of the crisis was caused by a rising level of private debt.</p>
<p>Now you reach a peak level where the willingness to take on debt collapses.</p>
<p>And so you go to a period where debt is rising all the time.</p>
<p>So credit, which is the annual change in debt, and that&rsquo;s credit as part of aggregate demand</p>
<p>and aggregate income.</p>
<p>So credit goes from positive to negative, and that causes a slump.</p>
<p>So can you describe why that causes a slump?</p>
<p>So credit goes to negative.</p>
<p>If you ask Paul Krugman, he&rsquo;ll tell you credit plays no role in aggregate demand.</p>
<p>Give me a second.</p>
<p>Credit plays no role in aggregate demand.</p>
<p>So the vision that the neoclassicals have for the banking system is what they call learnable</p>
<p>funds.</p>
<p>Is Paul Krugman, by the way, the knight at the front of the army that is the neoclassical</p>
<p>economist?</p>
<p>Yeah, fundamentally.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s politically reasonable, which makes him more dangerous than those that aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s politically&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s quite a lot of people that would disagree with that characterization of Paul</p>
<p>Krugman as he&rsquo;s politically reasonable.</p>
<p>You should see the people behind him.</p>
<p>The alternatives.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not a negative or positive statement, that&rsquo;s just he can be feisty as well.</p>
<p>Oh, he can.</p>
<p>He can.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s like the human face of neoclassical economics.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t deserve having a human face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s anti human theory.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s the human face.</p>
<p>Tell me what you really think.</p>
<p>I got you.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, so but the credit does not have any effect on aggregate demand.</p>
<p>In their model.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s not the case at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely crucial to aggregate demand.</p>
<p>So what they model is, again, the example of you lending to me or vice versa.</p>
<p>If I lend money to you, I can spend less, you can spend more.</p>
<p>So credit is the change in debt.</p>
<p>So if I lend money to you, then there&rsquo;s a level of private debt rises.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an increase in credit.</p>
<p>But that increase in credit comes at an expense of my spending power.</p>
<p>So you can spend what I&rsquo;ve lent you, but I can&rsquo;t spend what I&rsquo;ve lent you.</p>
<p>So credit cancels out.</p>
<p>When you look at that&rsquo;s learnable funds.</p>
<p>But in the real world, and the Bank of England has said this is the real world and the textbooks</p>
<p>are wrong categorically in 2014.</p>
<p>When the bank lends, it adds to its asset side and says, you owe us more money.</p>
<p>And it adds to its liability side and says, here&rsquo;s the money in your bank account.</p>
<p>Now you spend that money.</p>
<p>So what happens when you do your sums, credit is part of aggregate demand and aggregate</p>
<p>income.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I first solved in 2019, I think, 2000, I only recently proved it mathematically.</p>
<p>So what that means is credit is a component of aggregate demand, and credit is also very</p>
<p>volatile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like consumption demand never goes negative, investment demand never goes negative, but</p>
<p>credit can go from positive to negative.</p>
<p>And when you take a look at the long run of American history after the Second World War,</p>
<p>there was no period until 2007 where credit was negative.</p>
<p>It was a positive number, therefore, when you do it as a percentage of GDP, it was a</p>
<p>positive percentage of GDP.</p>
<p>It peaked at 16% of GDP in 2006, 2007.</p>
<p>It fell to minus 5% in 2008, 2009.</p>
<p>So you had a 20% of GDP turnaround in aggregate demand.</p>
<p>Now when you plot that against unemployment, the correlation of credit to unemployment</p>
<p>across the period from about 1990 to 2010 is about minus 0.9, okay?</p>
<p>Enormous negative correlation.</p>
<p>Now according to the neoclassicals, it should be close to zero.</p>
<p>Empirically it&rsquo;s bleedingly obvious it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And it applies to every country in the world that had a financial crisis at that period.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s bleedingly obvious in the data.</p>
<p>And they ignore it because credit&rsquo;s not part of their model.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s causation.</p>
<p>It is causal.</p>
<p>Today we sit there, it&rsquo;s extremely high inflation.</p>
<p>What role does inflation play in this picture?</p>
<p>Is a little bit of inflation good?</p>
<p>We talked about money creation at the beginning.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a little bit of inflation good or bad?</p>
<p>A lot of inflation good or bad?</p>
<p>How concerned are you about?</p>
<p>A little bit is good for a simple reason that, like again, it&rsquo;s taken me a while to get my</p>
<p>head around this.</p>
<p>But if you think about how people say, what are the functions of money?</p>
<p>They say money, it&rsquo;s a unit of account, so you&rsquo;re measuring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a means of exchange, okay?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a store of value, okay?</p>
<p>Now yes, okay, it has those three roles, but the last one is contradictory to the previous</p>
<p>two.</p>
<p>Because, and this is where you see this with the Bitcoin phenomenon, if you want to hang</p>
<p>onto money as a store of value, then if prices are falling, the value of money is rising.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually in your interests as a store of value to hang onto it and not spend it.</p>
<p>So that contradicts its role as a means of exchange.</p>
<p>Now if you have money which depreciates, and this was actually tried in the Austrian town</p>
<p>of Wargel during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>If you have money that depreciates, then if you don&rsquo;t use it, you lose it fundamentally.</p>
<p>So it has a high rate of circulation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a monetary theorist called Silvio Gazzell, and he wrote this proposal that money</p>
<p>should depreciate.</p>
<p>And he was ridiculed and opposed and derided, but Keynes said he was a great intellect.</p>
<p>And the mayor of the town of Wargel in Austria during the Great Depression was facing an</p>
<p>unemployment rate of 25% pretty much.</p>
<p>Germany had the worst experience in the Great Depression in the world, as bad as America,</p>
<p>slightly worse than America.</p>
<p>And so he thought, how can I stimulate demand here?</p>
<p>So he produced a script which could only be used for buying goods and services in Wargel.</p>
<p>And it could be used to pay your local rates.</p>
<p>But it was depreciated by putting a stamp on the money if you didn&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>So what happened was people would pay their rates, they needed to pay the rates using</p>
<p>this money, so the script, so they used the script.</p>
<p>And because it depreciated, you&rsquo;d use it rapidly.</p>
<p>So people were using that money, this alternative to the Austrian shilling, and the economic</p>
<p>activity in town took off, and unemployment fell to zero.</p>
<p>And it was an absolute miracle, and everybody loved a Wargel experiment, and the Austrian</p>
<p>central bank sued them for establishing an alternative form of money and shut it down.</p>
<p>Unemployment went back up to 25% again, and Austria voted 99.6% for the Nazis, something</p>
<p>crazy number like that when Hitler marched in.</p>
<p>So the Wargel experiment showed that a depreciating currency led to a high rate of circulation.</p>
<p>But of course, we&rsquo;re not talking Weimar Republic levels of inflation.</p>
<p>So when you get that much inflation, and that&rsquo;s normally caused by, as the Weimar inflation</p>
<p>was caused by, the reparation terms imposed on Germany, fundamentally by France at the</p>
<p>Treaty of Versailles, they paid a large part of that with just basically printing the notes,</p>
<p>and you went into this crazy period of hyperinflation.</p>
<p>So hyperinflation almost always occurs when there&rsquo;s a massive destruction of physical</p>
<p>resources, and the monetary authority tries to paper, literally, over it, and then you</p>
<p>get hyperinflation, that&rsquo;s total social breakdown.</p>
<p>So a moderate level of inflation inspires the means of exchange usage of money, but</p>
<p>undermines the store of value usage of money.</p>
<p>And that dilemma is why we have this antagonistic attitude towards inflation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you&rsquo;re describing it as a tension, but it nevertheless is, like money is a store</p>
<p>of value and a means of exchange, and I don&rsquo;t, you know, to push back, it&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a tension, it&rsquo;s just that depending on the dynamics of this beautiful economic</p>
<p>system of ours, it&rsquo;s used as one more than the other.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s inflation, you&rsquo;re using it more for the means of exchange, there&rsquo;s deflation</p>
<p>using more for store of value, but that doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t see that as a tension, that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a, how much you use it for those different, like&hellip;</p>
<p>But it ends up saying that overall, the level of effective commerce, a bit of inflation</p>
<p>is a good thing, because that&rsquo;s depreciating the money slightly and encourage its use.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so the argument that some Bitcoin folks use or gold standard folks, again, HODL</p>
<p>is not an argument, is that having an inflation of zero is actually achieving that balance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So like, yeah.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re actually in favor of negative, they want it to be appreciated rapidly, and</p>
<p>because of the negative inflation, the value of the money rising relative to commodities,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they want, that&rsquo;s the HODL philosophy.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s more of like an investment, I don&rsquo;t know if that, that&rsquo;s more of investment</p>
<p>philosophy than the fundamental principles of why they believe in cryptocurrency, in</p>
<p>forced scarcity, it&rsquo;s a model.</p>
<p>The concern there is that when you print money, the public policy is detached from the actual</p>
<p>value.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, this is where, again, it matters to get money creation right, because</p>
<p>the government&rsquo;s not the only money creator, banks are as well, private banks.</p>
<p>And if we obsess too much about limiting government money creation, what we end up getting, if</p>
<p>there is money creation going on, it&rsquo;s private banks doing it, and you get an increase in</p>
<p>private debt, and fundamentally, private debt and its collapse, the collapse of credit,</p>
<p>when it stops growing, that&rsquo;s the fundamental cause of financial crises.</p>
<p>So yeah, but the question is, what&rsquo;s the cause for the collapse of the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I think this is like the Austrian thinking leaves out the debt deflation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like, I think one of the most important papers ever written was by Irving Fisher called</p>
<p>the Debt Deflation Theory of Great Depressions.</p>
<p>Fisher was somebody who accepted the neoclassical vision.</p>
<p>He wrote the pre Efficiency Market Hypothesis, Efficiency Market Hypothesis.</p>
<p>He had his own PhD called the Theory of Interest.</p>
<p>And in that, he argued effectively for a supply and demand analysis of the financial system.</p>
<p>And he argued for equilibrium, he said when you&rsquo;re working with a commodity market, then</p>
<p>the sale and the transaction and the exchange occur at the same point in time.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re working with the financial market, then the exchange occurs through time.</p>
<p>So he said he assumed that debts are repaid, all debts are repaid, and he assumed that</p>
<p>equilibrium through time was an essential part of his assumption.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;and then the Great Depression comes along.</p>
<p>And he has become a major shareholder in the rank Xerox because he invented the Roller</p>
<p>Dex.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a tinkerer.</p>
<p>And so he had taken out shares on margin, and he was worth about 100 million in modern</p>
<p>terms when the Great Depression hit.</p>
<p>And 90% of that was share market valuation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d taken out margin debt just like everybody else.</p>
<p>And with margin debt, you could put down $100,000 and buy a million dollars worth of shares.</p>
<p>So you got this huge leverage into debt.</p>
<p>Now that when the financial crisis hit, the level of margin debt in America had risen</p>
<p>from half a percent of GDP in 1920 to 13% of GDP in 1929.</p>
<p>It then fell to zero again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the stock market crash in 1929 was so devastating, that scale of margin lending.</p>
<p>And everybody was being wiped out, they were selling Rolls Royces for 20 quid.</p>
<p>You literally have photographs showing people doing that.</p>
<p>Because a margin call comes in, you&rsquo;ve got to liquidate everything.</p>
<p>So he said the danger of a debt deflation is what we have to avoid.</p>
<p>And that means you don&rsquo;t want too much private debt to accumulate, and you don&rsquo;t want falling</p>
<p>prices because the falling prices will amplify the impact of being insolvent to begin with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we saw in the Great Depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partially what we saw in 2007.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t have anything like the level of margin debt.</p>
<p>Margin debt was reduced from 90% to 50% ratio after the Great Depression.</p>
<p>So there were limits on how bad it was in 2007.</p>
<p>But the danger is still the period of deflation amplifies your debts.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I call it Fisher&rsquo;s Paradox, he didn&rsquo;t write those terms himself.</p>
<p>But he wrote a line saying the more debtors pay, the more they owe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And this is because you&rsquo;re liquidating to try to meet your own debts.</p>
<p>When you liquidate, the price level falls.</p>
<p>You will end up having a lower level of monetary debt, but a higher level of debt when you</p>
<p>deflate it using the price level.</p>
<p>So the biggest danger in capitalism is the debt deflation, far more dangerous than inflation.</p>
<p>And the cause of debt deflation is?</p>
<p>Too much lending.</p>
<p>Too much bank lending.</p>
<p>Too much private money creation.</p>
<p>And if you take a look at the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge explained the boom of the 1920s on</p>
<p>his surplus.</p>
<p>He said, my government running a surplus of 1% of GDP pretty much from 1922 through to</p>
<p>1930 is the foundation of our stability.</p>
<p>It should be continued.</p>
<p>What he didn&rsquo;t look at was that over that same time period, on average, Americans were</p>
<p>borrowing 5% of GDP per year from the private banks.</p>
<p>So you had a housing bubble at the beginning of the 1920s, which Richard Vague covers beautifully</p>
<p>in the brief history of doom.</p>
<p>And then you had this huge rise in margin debt as well, gigantic increase in margin</p>
<p>debt.</p>
<p>So all this borrowed money was being spent into the economy, and this is where credit</p>
<p>becomes part of aggregate demand.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s both not just for goods and services, it&rsquo;s also for shares and houses and so on.</p>
<p>So a huge valuation effect.</p>
<p>But then when the margin debt turned around, when people would not take out margin debt</p>
<p>anymore, the demand for margin debt disappeared.</p>
<p>And then it was, you know, what we call badly a positive feedback loop is actually an amplifying</p>
<p>feedback loop.</p>
<p>And that caused a collapse.</p>
<p>So what elements of that do you see today that we need to fix and how do we fix it?</p>
<p>We have to regard the level of private debt as a target of economic policy, just as much</p>
<p>as the rate of inflation or the rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>What is the moderate amount of private debt that&rsquo;s good?</p>
<p>I would say something of anywhere between 30 and 70% of GDP.</p>
<p>What is it currently?</p>
<p>In America, it&rsquo;s 170%.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Of GDP.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got, we&rsquo;ll have to talk after we talk, but I can show you the data in this.</p>
<p>And it is just this huge increase in private debt that first of all caused the boom, but</p>
<p>then financing the credit causes, ultimately causes the slump.</p>
<p>And so if we remove the rate level at which debt can reach and we stop speculative lending</p>
<p>and basically have a lending for both innovation, investment and essential consumption items,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t have the slump on the other side.</p>
<p>We can get rid of financial instability.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t stop financial cycles, but we can stop financial breakdown.</p>
<p>So we should really be focusing on the instability and getting that under control.</p>
<p>By the way, as you point to your laptop, my laptops, I have a lot of, how many computers</p>
<p>do I have?</p>
<p>I have a lot of them, but my little Surface, whatever the heck this thing is, is getting</p>
<p>definite size envy because your laptop, you said is 18 something inches.</p>
<p>18.4 inches.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen one that big and I&rsquo;ll give the internet that one.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for the graphics.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a gaming laptop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gaming laptop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a desktop.</p>
<p>It probably weighs like 40 pounds and you have to.</p>
<p>Eight kilos?</p>
<p>Eight kilos.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>You reckon eight or?</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Eight kilos.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, you&rsquo;re pushing 40 pounds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen the power supply for it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over there somewhere.</p>
<p>The power supply weighs about twice as much as your laptop.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you have to power it on with a crank.</p>
<p>Pretty close.</p>
<p>You have to like pull it.</p>
<p>Is it gas powered or is it coal?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I feel like it&rsquo;s a nuclear power station.</p>
<p>Nuclear.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A nuclear diamond in the back there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let me, before I forget, just let me ask you about, we&rsquo;ve covered brilliantly the</p>
<p>nuanced disagreements you have and the wisdom you&rsquo;ve drawn from Karl Marx.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also, like you mentioned in popular discourse, a kind of a distorted use of different</p>
<p>terms and one of them is Marxism today.</p>
<p>Is there something you could just speak to about, you know, increased use of that word</p>
<p>and is it misused?</p>
<p>Does it concern you that there&rsquo;s a lot of actually young people that say they&rsquo;re sort</p>
<p>of proudly Marxist?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are they misusing the term?</p>
<p>They are definitely misusing the term if they don&rsquo;t understand the use value exchange</p>
<p>value dialectic I went through earlier.</p>
<p>So if I could.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If I could just pause, the idea of socialism and Marxism is used in sort of popular lingo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, you know, a lot of people have a disproportionately hard life.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we help them out?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we be kind to our fellow man?</p>
<p>Kind of that&rsquo;s a short embodiment of an idea as opposed to some super complicated elaborate</p>
<p>model of the economy and politics and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, we could do that by using the insights that come out of modern monetary theory, which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve confirmed just using my simple Minsky models.</p>
<p>And that is that, to use the term, usually a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>A government running a deficit is a feature of a well functioning mixed fiat credit economy,</p>
<p>not a bug.</p>
<p>The government should normally run a deficit because that&rsquo;s how the government creates</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also had this obsession from mainstream economists of running a surplus, which is</p>
<p>what caused the Great Depression, Calvin Coolidge doing it for eight years.</p>
<p>Because of that obsession, we&rsquo;ve cut back on social services, we&rsquo;ve cut back on health,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve cut back on education, we&rsquo;ve cut back on infrastructure.</p>
<p>Now all that stuff predominantly affects the poor because the rich can afford to buy it</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>So if we had, Sonovich, realized that the government should run a deficit, it&rsquo;s a feature,</p>
<p>not a bug of a fiat money system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where Elon&rsquo;s made one mistake recently, I&rsquo;m not going back to funded first principles.</p>
<p>That deficit enables you to provide enough of a decent standard of living for those who</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t come out on top in the capitalist game.</p>
<p>And with that, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the angst of the young people.</p>
<p>Now we still have the climate parameters within which we have to survive, but a decent level</p>
<p>of government funding would mean the angst that you get where people say, I want to be</p>
<p>a Marxist, and they&rsquo;ve got what I call a cardboard cutout version of Marx in their minds.</p>
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be happening.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s potential to have a good society where the government runs a deficit that finances</p>
<p>the needs of the poor, where the rich get enough to indulge and take care of themselves,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get this breakdown.</p>
<p>If you try to cause the government running a surplus, then the burden of that is borne</p>
<p>by the poor, middle class and poor, and that will lead to the angst we&rsquo;re now seeing.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>That was a beautiful whirlwind exploration of all of economics and economics history.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, you tweeted, I think, we are the opposite of ants.</p>
<p>Individually intelligent, collectively stupid.</p>
<p>You need to develop systems thinking fast to counter our limitations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Do you really believe we&rsquo;re individually intelligent and collectively stupid?</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate?</p>
<p>I mean, some of that is just cheeky tweets, but&hellip;</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cheeky tweet I&rsquo;ve had in my mind for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that actually went moderately viral, not enough, but moderately viral for me.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you could analyze it as if it&rsquo;s some deep, profound statement you made</p>
<p>in a book.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Well, the reason is that we are the incredibly individually intelligent, things like these</p>
<p>devices we&rsquo;re playing with now.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the creation of individual minds.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Creative individual mind and a collective labor over centuries that led to this level</p>
<p>of technology, and that has to be respected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible stuff.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I think what humans are, if you want to distinguish humans from</p>
<p>other species on the planet, we don&rsquo;t weave webs, okay, we don&rsquo;t make bird calls.</p>
<p>What we do is we share beliefs.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now&hellip;</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a catalyst for intelligence?</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a catalyst.</p>
<p>But what it means is we can delude ourselves as much as we can inform ourselves.</p>
<p>So because we share beliefs, we can do things in a collective way.</p>
<p>And if we believe that if we take the incantations of the witch doctors and we happen to have</p>
<p>a couple of spears and things, we can go and attack the local herd, a tribe of lions and</p>
<p>drive them out, and we become the dominant species.</p>
<p>So it works at the stage where we were in competition with other species on the planet.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re the dominant species, then our beliefs get in the way.</p>
<p>LW. So you agree with Einstein, who said there are only two things that are infinite, the</p>
<p>universe and human stupidity.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t sure about the universe.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t sure about the universe.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t sure about the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you think that the collective, I mean, there&rsquo;s an infinity to the destructive</p>
<p>and the stupid, the inhumane that&rsquo;s possible when we humans get together, but it feels</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s more trajectories, there&rsquo;s more possibility for creation.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>There are.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s why we have to, I say if we were built around the idea that our</p>
<p>role as a species is to maintain and extend life on the planet and if not find it elsewhere,</p>
<p>then seed it elsewhere, then that is a vision which makes us creative and confines the worst</p>
<p>elements of our capacities to share beliefs.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I, my hope is that we&rsquo;ll reach that stage, but I think we&rsquo;ve overshot it</p>
<p>so badly that my real fear is we&rsquo;ll end up blaming technology for the type of world we</p>
<p>find ourselves living in in the next 20 to 50 years.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>So you think technology is going to be one of the, part of the solution?</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Part of the solution.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But if we go through and blame it, which is quite possible, we&rsquo;ll blame the technology</p>
<p>rather than blaming too much of the technology and the too much comes down to what economists</p>
<p>have told us, that we can just continue consuming infinitely on a finite planet.</p>
<p>And Kenneth Boulding said that beautifully.</p>
<p>If somebody believes that you can have exponential growth on a finite planet, they&rsquo;re either</p>
<p>mad or they&rsquo;re an economist.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, you made a long journey for which I&rsquo;m deeply honoured from, from, this distant</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Antibodies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s myth.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to go there one day, you&rsquo;d enjoy it.</p>
<p>If I go there, I will stay forever.</p>
<p>And so&hellip;</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a bit too, there&rsquo;s more vitality back in this economy.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d come back.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not a fan of the economy or money or any of that.</p>
<p>Nature calls me.</p>
<p>Let me, so I&rsquo;m honoured that you make that trip.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also said that while you&rsquo;re here in Austin, you&rsquo;re going to go to this American</p>
<p>factory that makes cars here in Austin and also visit Starbase.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about expanding out into the universe.</p>
<p>Is that something that excites you?</p>
<p>You mentioned about the economics of it, do you think, what do you think Marx would think</p>
<p>about this?</p>
<p>Like what, economically speaking, what is this?</p>
<p>Is it a good thing?</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s vital.</p>
<p>I mean, we can have capitalism in outer space far more successfully than we can have it</p>
<p>on the planet because we don&rsquo;t face, when we dump the waste, it ends up in the sun.</p>
<p>Not a problem, okay?</p>
<p>So it means the potential, we don&rsquo;t undermine our own productive capacity if we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it in outer space.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>So the destructive element of waste has a lesser impact in outer space.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Far lesser, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, who cares if we throw a bit of our iron back into the sun again?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d take a fair bit of it to turn it into what would be the next stage, it&rsquo;d be a red</p>
<p>giant.</p>
<p>And we have to get away because if there&rsquo;s a red giant at some stage, the sun will head</p>
<p>out past the orbit of Mars, I think, certainly past the orbit of Earth.</p>
<p>So to have longevity of just human life, life that evolved on this planet, we have to be</p>
<p>able to take it off planet, ultimately.</p>
<p>So if you think in the really long term, then it&rsquo;s our responsibility, we&rsquo;re going to want</p>
<p>to maintain life, is to establish life off the planet.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>What do you think about robots and AI as part of the expanding out into the universe?</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we have to.</p>
<p>I mean, that ends labor.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go for a, you know, your daily joint can&rsquo;t be from here to the asteroid belt and</p>
<p>back again for dinner with your family.</p>
<p>So production would be entirely mechanized.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d have to be a handful of people who service the machines.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about production and automation.</p>
<p>What about elements of consciousness that make humans so special, what about that persisting</p>
<p>within the machine?</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>That, I mean, I&rsquo;m still a skeptic about us ever being able to create a machine which</p>
<p>is truly conscious.</p>
<p>If I can throw my, it&rsquo;s only two cents worth.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>That would really piss off Karl Marx, by the way, if we create machines that are conscious.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>This is actually part of the, there&rsquo;s two good logical arguments against the labor theory</p>
<p>of value.</p>
<p>One of what it becomes, machines become intelligent, and the other was that if the declining rate</p>
<p>of profit applies in socialism, it&rsquo;ll apply as a rate of accumulation, sorry, in capitalism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll apply as a rate of socialism as well.</p>
<p>A guy called Khalid made that argument.</p>
<p>So his argument was just unsound.</p>
<p>But yeah, intelligent machines would completely screw Marx up, you know?</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you not like that world where machines have not only intelligence, but a consciousness,</p>
<p>a soul?</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s one of your interests, one of your potential endeavors, and the Kurtz will</p>
<p>argue that there&rsquo;s some singularity we&rsquo;re approaching as we just get increasing processing</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not processing power, it&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>And I think‚Äî</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Whatever the heck that means.</p>
<p>RG.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Whatever the heck that means, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you would have had imaginative insights.</p>
<p>I mean, your papers on, like, in automating motoring between the hyperintelligent machine</p>
<p>or the machine human interface where the standards can be lower for the machine and higher for</p>
<p>the human, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an insight you would have had at some point, and then you&rsquo;ve worked it further.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had insights like that as well, and I have no idea where they come from.</p>
<p>They just hit me in the head, and I just write them down, and they solve a problem that I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even know my mind was working on, okay?</p>
<p>So how can we get a machine to do that?</p>
<p>And I do not know the answer, but one thing I think is the potential is I think we have</p>
<p>to create AI that has feelings, AI that wants to survive.</p>
<p>Because if you think how our intelligence evolved, it&rsquo;s on this planet in a struggle</p>
<p>between predator and prey, and intelligent became a survival technique.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>I find the ideas of Ernest Becker with denial of death really powerful, which is that humans</p>
<p>not only have emotions and are trying to survive, they&rsquo;re able to ponder out in the distant</p>
<p>future their mortality, and that is a driving force for even greater creation that animals</p>
<p>are able to do, more primitive animals.</p>
<p>So there is some element where I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think for AI systems to have something like consciousness, they have to fear their mortality.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, if you do it then, you can&rsquo;t produce an AI whose behavior you can</p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>I mean, when you have kids.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t control their behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the tradeoff.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>You give life to an anarchist.</p>
<p>Like one of my favorite instances in my family life is one of my favorite, I like all my</p>
<p>nurses and nephews, but one&rsquo;s got a real quirk to her, and I was standing over her cot when</p>
<p>she was literally like about six months old, and she was gurgling away to herself.</p>
<p>And her father waved his fingers and said, stop making that noise.</p>
<p>And this little six month old kid goes, and I said, boy, you&rsquo;re going to have issues with</p>
<p>that one, mate.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>An anarchist was born.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t control this life you give birth to, and that&rsquo;s, I think, the threat of AI.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrifying and exciting.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And I think we should take that risk at some stage.</p>
<p>But I think to do it with what actually let artificial intelligence involve in this environment</p>
<p>in which it fears its own death.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of beauty there, but there&rsquo;s also a lot of destruction that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So you have to be extremely careful, but that&rsquo;s kind of the cutting edge of which we all often</p>
<p>operate as a humanity.</p>
<p>Let me ask you for advice.</p>
<p>Can you give advice to young people in high school and college?</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re interested in economics.</p>
<p>Maybe they have other career ideas.</p>
<p>What advice would you give them about a career they can have that they can be proud of or</p>
<p>a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>LW. Mainly in a career, I say don&rsquo;t do an economics degree.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>I say if you&hellip;</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little book.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Econ Comics.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>Econ Comics, Taking the Con Out of Economics.</p>
<p>So they should start with that and then say screw it to an economics degree.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Yeah, because what you learn is an obsolete technology.</p>
<p>Learning economics at a university is like learning to make astronomy.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Earth centric, equilibrium, you know, epicycles being added to make your models fit the data.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that economics is not a discipline worth deeply studying, it&rsquo;s that the university</p>
<p>education around economics is bad.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Is so bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say learn system dynamics.</p>
<p>Do a course in system dynamics which you can apply in any field and then apply what you</p>
<p>learn out of system dynamics to the issues of economics if that&rsquo;s what interests you.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>So get a sort of base engineering&hellip;</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>&hellip;education.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>A base engineering education.</p>
<p>That is far better than doing an economics degree.</p>
<p>In terms of life, my life is pretty chaotic in many, many ways.</p>
<p>My friends and family will tell me that at every opportunity.</p>
<p>But the thing is, I once had a, I&rsquo;ll tell you an example of a really funny incident</p>
<p>that occurred to me because I led this student revolt at Sydney University as I mentioned</p>
<p>when I was 20 years old.</p>
<p>LW.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>RL.</p>
<p>So I was at a restaurant one night and I found a bunch of guys, all guys, who&rsquo;d done accounting</p>
<p>at the university but had also been part of the student revolt.</p>
<p>So they hadn&rsquo;t seen me for about a decade and they said, what have you been doing, Steve?</p>
<p>And I talked about what I&rsquo;d done.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d been a school teacher for a while.</p>
<p>I then worked in overseas aid.</p>
<p>I was doing computer programming at the time and had forgotten what else I was doing at</p>
<p>that point.</p>
<p>So I explained it to all of them and they were at a Bucks night, one of them having</p>
<p>a wedding coming up the next week.</p>
<p>And one of them said, I wish I&rsquo;d done that.</p>
<p>And there was silence around the table, it was obviously a silent agreement.</p>
<p>And I looked at them and said, hang on, guys, look at the downside of my life.</p>
<p>You know, like you&rsquo;re getting married, I don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend right now, you&rsquo;ve all got</p>
<p>secure jobs, I&rsquo;m unemployed, okay, you own a house, I haven&rsquo;t even got a car, you know,</p>
<p>look at the downside of my life.</p>
<p>And the bloke was the kingpin of that group, they&rsquo;re a very innovative bunch of guys in</p>
<p>the student revolt.</p>
<p>And so he said, Steve, we would still all rather have done what you have done.</p>
<p>And they did a county because it was safe, you always get a job, and they were bored</p>
<p>shitless.</p>
<p>Did you have a sense that the chaos you&rsquo;re always jumping into was dangerous or was it</p>
<p>just the pull of it?</p>
<p>I simply couldn&rsquo;t not do it.</p>
<p>It was part of me that I couldn&rsquo;t swallow this economic stuff.</p>
<p>Once I was exposed to why it was so wrong, then I was on a crusade to make it right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been part of my nature all through my life, I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t that I made a choice to do it, it&rsquo;s that I couldn&rsquo;t be true to myself without</p>
<p>doing it.</p>
<p>And I find a lot of people get caught in a life where they&rsquo;re doing it because it works</p>
<p>for some financial or other reason, but they&rsquo;re not being true to themselves.</p>
<p>And as messy as my life is, as much shit I&rsquo;ve got myself caught up in, and there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of that in my personal and financial life right now, which is a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>I would rather have had that nature than not.</p>
<p>You would rather take the pain in the ass than not.</p>
<p>Let me ask a dark question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the darkest place you&rsquo;ve ever gone to in your mind?</p>
<p>So in all that rollercoaster of life, have there been periods where it&rsquo;s been really</p>
<p>tough?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to cope with depression in the last five years since I started reading Neoclassical</p>
<p>Economists on Climate Change.</p>
<p>Sorry to laugh.</p>
<p>Got to come back to that one.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where my wife&rsquo;s going to come into this story.</p>
<p>So I was reading Richard Toll, a paper from 2009 called The Economics of Climate Change,</p>
<p>Journal of Economic Perspectives, I think.</p>
<p>And I read this section where he says that one of the ways they tried to calibrate what</p>
<p>climate change was due is they assumed that the relationship between GDP and temperature</p>
<p>over space would apply over time as well.</p>
<p>And I read that and thought, that is so fucking stupid, because all it&rsquo;s saying is that if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a 10 degree temperature difference between New York and Florida and a 20% difference</p>
<p>in income, then a 10 degree increase in temperature will cause GDP to fall by 20%.</p>
<p>It is so insanely stupid.</p>
<p>So when I read that line, I just did this.</p>
<p>I was in shock at how stupid it was.</p>
<p>My wife, who&rsquo;s Thai and brings in treats for me all day, walks into the room and she speaks</p>
<p>in a staccato English and says to me, why are you like this?</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m just doing this work on climate change.</p>
<p>And she interrupts me and says, oh, why you do that stuff?</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s interested in climate change.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do anything to change it.</p>
<p>If we die, we die.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s perfect Buddhist grounding.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, I can&rsquo;t argue with her again.</p>
<p>So that sort of stopped me on the depression, but that&rsquo;s the darkest point when I looked</p>
<p>at it and I thought that this arrogance, this stupidity, this humbug in the economists meant</p>
<p>that we were potentially jeopardizing the lives of billions of people and Christ knows</p>
<p>how many other life forms.</p>
<p>And having that knowledge is the most depressing experience of my life.</p>
<p>That ideas, simple models combined with arrogance can lead to the potential destruction of human</p>
<p>civilization.</p>
<p>That was a very heavy.</p>
<p>And then your wife came in with Nature Wins in the End and sort of accept the flow of</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>I really enjoy that book, The Earth Abides, because it&rsquo;s got that same beautiful sense</p>
<p>to it.</p>
<p>Life will survive whatever we do.</p>
<p>I mean, they talk about the people, I was actually talking with a good mate of mine,</p>
<p>an ex geologist, and he&rsquo;s now a professor of economics.</p>
<p>And he said as a geologist, he really hated people talking about the Anthropocene epoch.</p>
<p>And I said, well, it shouldn&rsquo;t be the Anthropocene epoch, it&rsquo;ll be the Anthropocene event.</p>
<p>Anthropocene epoch is millions of years and a huge period of life on the planet.</p>
<p>And we might be snuffed out in 10,000 years of human civilization.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not much slower than the meteors wiping out the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The dinosaurs lasted for a long time after that event.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d just be a layer in the surface of the planet with plastics and strange metals</p>
<p>like that at some point.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just an epoch.</p>
<p>Life will abide.</p>
<p>Life will survive us.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so much life we&rsquo;re going to take down with us in this whole period.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many of our own lives we&rsquo;re going to terminate for no good reason.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at this Richard Toll character.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll definitely have to look at some of his papers.</p>
<p>It does look like, boy, is he oversimplifying and do a lot of people.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Check his one on how good it&rsquo;ll be to lose Amok.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m going to approach all of these topics with humility.</p>
<p>And I would like to have some conversations if people can recommend.</p>
<p>My default position is always with the scientists, but even above that, my default position is</p>
<p>with those who are humble versus those who are arrogant.</p>
<p>This idea that because you&rsquo;re a quote unquote expert, you deserve to have arrogance is a</p>
<p>silly idea to me.</p>
<p>Again, going to the broader view of life on earth, nature.</p>
<p>Nature&rsquo;s the only one that gets to be arrogant and it chooses not to.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about love.</p>
<p>What role does love play in this whole thing?</p>
<p>Did Karl Marx have a model for that?</p>
<p>Oh, Marx was madly in love with Jenny von Westphalen and wrote love poetry to her long</p>
<p>before he wrote Das Kapital.</p>
<p>And he was infatuated with her.</p>
<p>He ended up also impregnating his housekeeper.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a son of Karl Marx, who was the son of the housekeeper, not the Jenny.</p>
<p>There are numerous daughters.</p>
<p>So he had a complicated view of love.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dialectic on love there.</p>
<p>He had an idealistic view with Jenny and he was rejected because he wasn&rsquo;t, not by Jenny,</p>
<p>she was madly in love with him as well.</p>
<p>So it was a real passionate love affair from the very outset.</p>
<p>But then of course you have children, lots of them die.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of tragedy in his life as well.</p>
<p>He and Jenny were forced out of Chelsea by a cholera epidemic.</p>
<p>My vision for London back in the 1850s and 60s was Calcutta in the 1970s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what life was like.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of hardship in his life as well.</p>
<p>And he was always poor.</p>
<p>So only Ingalls kept him alive financially.</p>
<p>He applied for one job outside of, he never got an academic job.</p>
<p>He was pushed out of Prussia as a newspaper author, but he also applied for a job as a</p>
<p>clerk in the British railway system, was turned down because they couldn&rsquo;t read his handwriting.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m a bit similar there.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of love and passion.</p>
<p>But in general, what do you think is the role of love in the human condition?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vital.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, that feeling of passionate desire and respect for somebody else.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s perverted forms of love as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll leave that out, but somebody having a really, a deep bond, which goes beyond just</p>
<p>sexual attraction.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve had that four or five times in my life with different women at different times.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve stuffed up the most important one very early on.</p>
<p>And that feeling is incredible.</p>
<p>And you couldn&rsquo;t have life worth living without that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an essential part of who we are.</p>
<p>But what we have to do is to transfer it, not just to the rest of our species, but to</p>
<p>all the species.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think, what&rsquo;s vital.</p>
<p>And how do we maintain that over generations?</p>
<p>And I think that idea that we can actually hang on to that general sense of respect and</p>
<p>not lose it again.</p>
<p>Because the amount of life we&rsquo;ve terminated on this planet, the warlike side of humanity,</p>
<p>that is too much of a defining feature of our species.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opposite of love, it&rsquo;s hate.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s pleasure and inflicting pain on others.</p>
<p>When you see people killing others in a warlike environment, they&rsquo;re enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rarely, sometimes it&rsquo;s self defense.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, when I&rsquo;ve spoken to people who&rsquo;ve been involved in combat and been involved</p>
<p>in riots and said, when you see somebody rioting, bashing people up, they&rsquo;re enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not anger they&rsquo;re feeling, it&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dark aspect to human nature.</p>
<p>Very dark.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the capacity to rise above that.</p>
<p>And I think, like I put us on a spectrum between chimpanzees at one extreme and bonobos at</p>
<p>the other.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re too close to the chimpanzees.</p>
<p>Bonobos are just having fun, having lots of sex.</p>
<p>Every time they do anything, they fuck first and do the work later and then fuck afterwards</p>
<p>to celebrate.</p>
<p>Fuck first, ask questions later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that Scent of a Woman, one of my favorite films, where Al Pacino gives advice</p>
<p>to a cat.</p>
<p>He says, when in doubt, fuck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good life advice for a cat, especially.</p>
<p>We mentioned that death seems to be maybe fundamental to creating a conscious AI.</p>
<p>All right, do you think about your own death?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of going through it.</p>
<p>Not the other side?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not afraid of being on the other side?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is an other side.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m agnostic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m atheist when pressed and agnostic.</p>
<p>The one thing that I think I can understand why religion exists is that the whole thing</p>
<p>that something exists is itself a dilemma.</p>
<p>You have to take on faith that reality exists, whether it&rsquo;s a simulation or actual reality,</p>
<p>it exists, and that itself can&rsquo;t be explained in any scientific manner.</p>
<p>I mean, you can talk about anti protons and protons and the sun being zero and so on,</p>
<p>but why did it even happen in the first place?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s part you simply have to take on faith.</p>
<p>So there was darkness before, and there&rsquo;s darkness after.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re going to be alive on the other side of that darkness.</p>
<p>I think individually, no, but the way you can live on is by what you do to human consciousness.</p>
<p>How do you hope people remember you?</p>
<p>As someone who managed to integrate economics with an appreciation for life.</p>
<p>Well, I have to say, as a bit of a callback, you&rsquo;re one deadly bastard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would come down and talk to me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a brilliant person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a hilarious person.</p>
<p>The humility shines through.</p>
<p>The brilliance shines through.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for spending this time.</p>
<p>You do the same for humanity.</p>
<p>I mean, when I saw that email from you, my eyes popped out of my head.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, you should hold your judgment.</p>
<p>I got to show you the sex dungeon I have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for an invitation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send my wife over.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay, mate.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Steve Keen.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.</p>
<p>To be radical is to grasp things at their root.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
