    <p>Can I tell you a funny story? So I, I was in, I was in. And</p>
<p>then I, when I landed, there was a, an assistant message on the</p>
<p>plane. And then the pilot texts me like, Hey, bad news. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to be able to take you tomorrow. There&rsquo;s an air</p>
<p>message. And if we can&rsquo;t resolve it, we can&rsquo;t fly. Okay. So I</p>
<p>text sacks. I&rsquo;m like, Hey, dude, I&rsquo;m in a really tough spot. Is</p>
<p>there any way that I, you know, I could catch a flight, you</p>
<p>know, with you tomorrow? Absolute dead silence. Three</p>
<p>hours later, Paul pilot Paul texts me and says, Good news.</p>
<p>Cleared us. We&rsquo;re going tomorrow. I text sacks right</p>
<p>away. Hey, no worries. It&rsquo;s all resolved. In eight seconds. He</p>
<p>responds. Awesome. With an exclamation mark.</p>
<p>He had zero intention of bringing me and my family with</p>
<p>it. Zero.</p>
<p>I filibustered. He filibustered.</p>
<p>No, the truth is the plane was with me. I was using it. I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>happy to let you borrow the plane if I&rsquo;m not using it. Here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sacks. The last time we went to dinner. Ready? The check comes</p>
<p>Miller and Lux lands on the table. Here&rsquo;s sacks. What</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing. See that? You know what that is? sacks going</p>
<p>for his wallet. You can just count it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic because I can&rsquo;t remember the last time. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>over the last time you picked up a check. J Cal. What do you</p>
<p>every time I pick it up on the way in maybe for a slice of</p>
<p>pizza.</p>
<p>sacks is one of the most generous people I know. I</p>
<p>remember we went to a bar once. We barely had time to get a</p>
<p>glass of still water, a diet Coke and some of the free nuts.</p>
<p>And then J Cal was like, guys, it&rsquo;s on me.</p>
<p>I pulled out a 20. I gave it right to the bartender.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. My turn. My turn.</p>
<p>I got</p>
<p>Jamaa, you got the the white truffles and the filet mignon</p>
<p>last week. I think these bar nuts are on me. It&rsquo;s only fair.</p>
<p>Yeah, throw in some cashews to throw in the cashews and</p>
<p>raisins, a trail mix. I&rsquo;ll get the trail mix. Because you got</p>
<p>the truffles last time to month.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, welcome to the all in podcast. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still here. Episode 105. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw boys last</p>
<p>week, the pod hit a new high watermark 16th overall in the</p>
<p>world. So congratulations.</p>
<p>I thought we peaked at 14. Actually, was it 1414 people</p>
<p>listen to this pod when I was in DC this week, I had a bunch of</p>
<p>meetings and so many of the of the staffers listen to the pod.</p>
<p>And they came up to me. They&rsquo;re like, Hey, love you guys listen</p>
<p>every week. It&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s really crazy. Actually, the</p>
<p>reach of this thing. It&rsquo;s really cool. Now when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>DC, how gleeful were they about sacks is absolute shellacking</p>
<p>last week that must have been high fives all over the dams</p>
<p>like they won twice, Trump announced and sacks lost.</p>
<p>Listen, we, we talked a lot about are they about SPF and how</p>
<p>much money he gave them in order to stop that red wave.</p>
<p>I talked to a lot of folks, folks. And what I would say is</p>
<p>we talked a lot about energy policy, life, life sciences,</p>
<p>obviously, two areas that I invest a lot of money in, and</p>
<p>foreign policy. And actually, David, you&rsquo;d be surprised by how</p>
<p>many fans you have there.</p>
<p>Cool. Well, I mean, like General Milley, like we talked about</p>
<p>last week, he&rsquo;s come around Jake Sullivan just this week, said</p>
<p>that he told the Ukrainians, it was reported that they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have Crimea back get realistic. So Jake Sullivan and Milley are</p>
<p>like the voices of reason now, the administration on this, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just saying the same thing I&rsquo;ve been saying, for</p>
<p>which I was excoriated by the foreign policy establishment.</p>
<p>And I got into a little Twitter spat with Ian Bremner this week,</p>
<p>because all of a sudden he posted Oh, everybody has been</p>
<p>privately saying that we need to negotiate. No, no, you haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You were criticizing you were denouncing Elon as a Kremlin</p>
<p>agent when he posted that Twitter poll suggesting that</p>
<p>the Ukrainians should negotiate. So you were publicly denouncing</p>
<p>those of us who are calling for negotiations. And now all of a</p>
<p>sudden, you&rsquo;re saying, well, this has always been the</p>
<p>position. But I think what&rsquo;s significant about that is the</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s just a weather vane for the blob and the foreign policy</p>
<p>establishment. And so the weather vane is now pointing</p>
<p>towards negotiation. So that&rsquo;s the good news here.</p>
<p>Do you think that if DeSantis wins the presidency, you will be</p>
<p>nominated as Secretary of State? Treasury? What would you take</p>
<p>Treasury? State? If you were offered a cabinet position,</p>
<p>would you take you should you should take what you what you</p>
<p>have to understand is that my position on foreign policy or</p>
<p>Ukraine specifically is not it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not adopted by either</p>
<p>party. I mean, McConnell and the Senate Republican leadership are</p>
<p>very much on board with the Biden administration&rsquo;s policy on</p>
<p>this. They are very, very hawkish. It&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>uniparty on this issue. There&rsquo;s really just one consolidated</p>
<p>blob.</p>
<p>Okay, but back to the question, would you? Would it be a dream</p>
<p>of yours? Would you find great joy in having a White House</p>
<p>position? To serve your country? Would you serve?</p>
<p>Would I serve if if if the president of the United States</p>
<p>calls you up and asks you to do something, obviously, you have</p>
<p>to serve your country, but it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a yes.</p>
<p>What if he asked you to serve as the US ambassador to Burkina</p>
<p>Faso? Where? What? The ambassador roles are so funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have to compete for the good ones. And then some</p>
<p>people get stuck with the bad ones. Those are those are</p>
<p>available for purchase. Yeah,</p>
<p>yeah, exactly. You know, there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s like a menu of</p>
<p>these things like these ambassadorships. Like, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like written down anywhere. But it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>unspoken. It&rsquo;s like, if you want the ambassadorship to the UK,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like $10 million. And then, you know, like,</p>
<p>the thing was, with UK and France, it&rsquo;s every every</p>
<p>embassy, every ambassadorship comes with an annual budget. But</p>
<p>the cost of actually running that embassy and really throwing</p>
<p>the parties is much more so for the UK and France. The gap is 10</p>
<p>million a year that you have to fund out of pocket. So you got</p>
<p>to be really willing, you know, to put the money up. But</p>
<p>apparently, you got to pay for the parties. My friend, my</p>
<p>friend was was the ambassador to the UK, under Obama, and I</p>
<p>went to a party there. It&rsquo;s unbelievable. And he has the</p>
<p>best life because like, you know, he was meeting everybody</p>
<p>in the world, you can imagine goes through the UK and then</p>
<p>wants to meet the US ambassador. It was a great job for him.</p>
<p>Right. But the money I&rsquo;m talking about is the cost of buying one</p>
<p>of these synacures. You have to typically raise that bundle.</p>
<p>Yeah, you bundle that much money for whoever. This is what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know. This is what I&rsquo;ve heard is that</p>
<p>does that mean that SPF parents if Elizabeth Ward wins the</p>
<p>presidency, it&rsquo;s gonna get some passership right now. The</p>
<p>Illuminati right now just revoked all of our Illuminati</p>
<p>cards. We&rsquo;re not supposed to talk about this, guys, that you</p>
<p>can buy an ambassadorship. But speaking of buying politicians</p>
<p>and coverage, let&rsquo;s get an update on FTX. So what about</p>
<p>Trump? Speaking of politics, I mean, you know, you bring it up</p>
<p>because if I bring it up, I didn&rsquo;t want to tell five minutes,</p>
<p>the only thing I want to bring up is, I think I&rsquo;m entitled to</p>
<p>and I told you so on this, there was a story where the FBI</p>
<p>said that the reason why Trump kept the boxes in his basement,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve now the FBI has definitively said, it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>he was just trying to preserve mementos, not try to sell state</p>
<p>secrets to the Saudis or something like that, like some</p>
<p>people were making wild conspiracy theories about so</p>
<p>Jake, it looks like I was I was right about that. In fact, I</p>
<p>think we had that very discussion on this pod.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we I said, I thought he was keeping it for</p>
<p>like, keepsakes, like mementos. That was my position, too,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t support this.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question, because I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past</p>
<p>him. He&rsquo;s a maniac. I think if you believe that this was about</p>
<p>mementos, which the FBI is now said it was, I think you also</p>
<p>have to say that the FBI&rsquo;s approach and rating his home</p>
<p>with armed, you know, soldiers was heavy handed. Now, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying they didn&rsquo;t have the legal right to do it. I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>they checked all the right boxes, but it was heavy handed.</p>
<p>But look, that brings me to another point. Why do they do</p>
<p>it? I actually suspect now that what the Biden administration&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to do is keep Trump in the news. I think they actually</p>
<p>want to provoke want him to run. They want. It&rsquo;s the exact. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the exact same thing. Remember the the 50 million that went</p>
<p>into Republican primaries to support the you know, the</p>
<p>election denier candidate. Turns out that was a successful</p>
<p>strategy for them as much as I hate to admit it. It&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>reckless as I think that was, and hypocritical because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you can be out there claiming that these candidates</p>
<p>are a threat to democracy at the very same time you&rsquo;re funding</p>
<p>them. So I think it was completely hypocritical and sort</p>
<p>of Machiavellian, but it worked. And I think in a similar way,</p>
<p>what the Democrats are going to try to do over the next year is</p>
<p>keep Trump in the news as much as possible. And in fact, CNN</p>
<p>ran his entire speech, announcing last Tuesday, I think</p>
<p>for this reason,</p>
<p>if Trump wins the Republican nomination, he&rsquo;s going to, then</p>
<p>he will lose the presidency. Because if you look at all of</p>
<p>these exit polls that came out of these midterms, he&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>massively unfavorable. But that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>you know, litigated in the primaries and the primaries,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just Republican on Republican. And there are a</p>
<p>non trivial number of paths where Trump actually beats</p>
<p>DeSantis. And I think that&rsquo;s very scary to the Republicans</p>
<p>who want to just move on and have a chance of actually</p>
<p>consolidating power. And it&rsquo;s gleefully blissful for the</p>
<p>Democrats. Because if again, and we saw this, look, if the</p>
<p>Democrats were able to fund and field MAGA candidates in the</p>
<p>Republican primaries that then lost in the general election,</p>
<p>well, the best MAGA candidate of all is Trump. So it David Sachs</p>
<p>is completely right now, like the balance of power here should</p>
<p>be if you&rsquo;re the Democrats, whatever you can do to keep him</p>
<p>in the news, whatever you can do to induce him to run, makes a</p>
<p>lot of sense, because he will kill cripple the Republican</p>
<p>Party. He&rsquo;ll split, he&rsquo;ll split.</p>
<p>Look at how Jake has got a big read. He&rsquo;s admitting to the</p>
<p>hypocrisy, which is for years, he&rsquo;s screaming about what is</p>
<p>your life. Hold on a second. You&rsquo;ve been screaming about what</p>
<p>a threat to democracy is how he&rsquo;s secretly on the payroll of</p>
<p>the Kremlin or foreign governments. And yet, and yet</p>
<p>you want to keep him in the news. You want to be the</p>
<p>and you Republicans don&rsquo;t have the common sense to kick him out</p>
<p>of the party. Oh, I do. Come on. I was on the DeSantis train</p>
<p>before the midterms election.</p>
<p>You on this pod will never kick him out of the party. You should</p>
<p>say how am I supposed to kick him out? You guys should all</p>
<p>disavow him, publicly disavow him.</p>
<p>How? I&rsquo;ve already said I support DeSantis. I said it before the</p>
<p>midterms. What else do you want me to do? But by the way, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I think you&rsquo;re I think you and many other people</p>
<p>on the democratic side in the media are being very hypocritical</p>
<p>about this because you want to claim that he&rsquo;s this unique</p>
<p>threat to democracy while playing this game, where you</p>
<p>want to keep him in the news, you want to basically provide</p>
<p>him with as much oxygen as possible, because you think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more beatable. And by the way, I agree that he&rsquo;s less electable</p>
<p>than DeSantis, which is why part of the reason why I&rsquo;m on the</p>
<p>DeSantis train. I also think DeSantis would get more</p>
<p>done. But look, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the nominee. Did you see the new polling that came</p>
<p>out after the midterms? DeSantis is now the favorite in among</p>
<p>Republican primary voters among every different slicing that you</p>
<p>want to do, of whether it&rsquo;s likely Republican voters,</p>
<p>primary voters, whether it&rsquo;s Fox News viewers, and on and on and</p>
<p>on. DeSantis is now ahead of Trump by about</p>
<p>Okay, wait, hold on, I need to be able to state my position</p>
<p>because Saxton interrupted me seven times. I just would like</p>
<p>to get my position on here. Number one, you all backed</p>
<p>somebody who is a horrible human being who made terrible</p>
<p>decisions. And now you guys keep supporting him at some point,</p>
<p>you have to put your foot down and say, Listen, we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>this guy. You have to publicly say, January 6, you know, and</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s approach, the election denial, you guys have</p>
<p>to come out and just say, we don&rsquo;t want this person to run. I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ve been hedging too much. I think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem. Now, who am not? How can I think party? Yeah, no, you</p>
<p>always were a little bit like, because I did. Hold on, on this</p>
<p>very pot, I asked you, if he run, would you support him?</p>
<p>Would you ever vote for him again? And you were like, well,</p>
<p>and you would vote for me again. If he wins the nomination,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll vote for him. That&rsquo;s the truth. Republicans will still</p>
<p>vote for him.</p>
<p>Look, you know that before it was popular before the midterms,</p>
<p>I was on the DeSantis train. I was saying so on this pod for</p>
<p>over a year when it was very unpopular, certainly in the area</p>
<p>in which I live. And so you know, and there are a lot of</p>
<p>Republicans now most Republicans now agree with me on this issue,</p>
<p>according to the polling that just took place.</p>
<p>But if he wins the nomination, you will vote for Jason is that</p>
<p>you want us to buy into every bullshit narrative that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever told about this January six and bullshit. No, it was</p>
<p>let him finish. Let him finish. He&rsquo;s interrupting me every two</p>
<p>seconds. Stay out of it. Freeburg. I just want you guys</p>
<p>to guys, I just want you guys to speak and then let the other</p>
<p>person speak. That&rsquo;s it. I don&rsquo;t come on.</p>
<p>My point is, here we go again. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t want to rehash</p>
<p>every single thing in the past. But But look, the point is that</p>
<p>I think we have more electable candidates. I think we have</p>
<p>candidates that would get more done in office. But and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already said so. But I you know, but I don&rsquo;t that doesn&rsquo;t mean I</p>
<p>believe this whole like threat to democracy thing. I think that</p>
<p>is massive inflation of the actual threat. But But look, if</p>
<p>you want me to say that we have more electable candidates, we</p>
<p>have candidates who will get more done, who frankly would be</p>
<p>less alienating to moderates and independents and could even win</p>
<p>over some moderate Democrats the way that DeSantis didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Florida to win by 19 points. Yes, happy to say that. And I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been saying that.</p>
<p>I will just say, if I if I&rsquo;m if I&rsquo;m if freeberg allows me to</p>
<p>make a point, I would like to say, it is a threat to</p>
<p>democracy, January 6, an election denial. Those two</p>
<p>things are acute.</p>
<p>Party fund over $50 million to those candidates.</p>
<p>cynical, because they want it to win cynicism, pure cynicism.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re on the same page about that. Yeah, it&rsquo;s pure</p>
<p>cynicism. But do you let me ask you a question. And then we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>wrap on this because I know it&rsquo;s uncomfortable for free bird to</p>
<p>watch mommy and daddy fight.</p>
<p>Some childhood trauma drama is okay. Mommy daddy still love</p>
<p>each other even if we fight sometimes. It just makes me want</p>
<p>to turn the volume down. Go ahead.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost done anyway. I do think fielding moderate</p>
<p>candidates is the path and I think you brought this up a ton</p>
<p>of times who it&rsquo;s the race to whoever can get that moderate</p>
<p>middle and I hope that they feel better candidates. But do</p>
<p>you think sacks he&rsquo;s running? This is one of the cynical takes</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s running because it will help all the legal cases</p>
<p>against him. Do you think there&rsquo;s anything to that?</p>
<p>My guess is that that they see him as an easier candidate to</p>
<p>beat and they&rsquo;re going to do everything they can to try and</p>
<p>keep him in the news. And I don&rsquo;t, I actually I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your position. I actually think that you&rsquo;re being sincere</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want him to win a second term. I mean, remember,</p>
<p>like we don&rsquo;t know, I think we all believe that we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have a pretty severe recession next year. So just because the</p>
<p>democrat cynical strategy in the midterms of promoting, you know,</p>
<p>what they call it election deniers in the primary that</p>
<p>happened to work, but just because it worked last time</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s going to work next time.</p>
<p>And abortion absolutists and a whole bunch of other things. I</p>
<p>think I think the point is pretty much this, which is that</p>
<p>people gave Trump a lot of credit for being an idiot</p>
<p>savant. But it looks like he&rsquo;s more of an idiot savant minus</p>
<p>the savant. Okay, this is a, this is kind of a goofball, who</p>
<p>has a brilliant media strategy, and he had his finger on the</p>
<p>pulse in a moment. And then he just couldn&rsquo;t execute couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>put two and two together couldn&rsquo;t put one foot in front</p>
<p>of the other. And he was way too divisive, and he got booted out</p>
<p>and he lost fair and square. And now what the republicans have to</p>
<p>realize is if they don&rsquo;t figure out how to field somebody out of</p>
<p>the primaries, that is different than Trump, the democrats will</p>
<p>win. Because if it is Trump, whoever the democratic candidate</p>
<p>is, I don&rsquo;t think it really matters. We&rsquo;ll crush Trump.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I think that&rsquo;s likely correct. I mean, I think</p>
<p>I think that we talked about it last week, you cannot win the</p>
<p>presidency with call it 45% of the vote. I mean, Trump has</p>
<p>capped at that amount. And the scary thing for republicans, by</p>
<p>the way, is Trump does a much better job than anybody else in</p>
<p>getting his base activated. So the thing that all these polls</p>
<p>get wrong, and I think they&rsquo;ve consistently gotten wrong, and</p>
<p>as a result have underestimated him is they don&rsquo;t give him the</p>
<p>credit he deserves duly for being able to curate a fervent</p>
<p>base of that 30 or 40% of America that will show up for</p>
<p>him. And even if they didn&rsquo;t show up as much in the midterms,</p>
<p>they sure as hell showed up in the primaries for his candidates</p>
<p>oftentimes. So I just think it&rsquo;s a very dangerous cocktail that</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t sleep on. So the republicans have to take this</p>
<p>really serious moderate republicans want to have a</p>
<p>chance of winning. You guys have to figure out how to beat</p>
<p>Trump in a ground game. Because if his base shows up, he has a</p>
<p>decent chance of winning the nomination, but then you will</p>
<p>lose the general.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s pretty much spot on. I</p>
<p>think republicans really have to be smart and disciplined and</p>
<p>think about, we have to nominate the the most electable</p>
<p>candidate. But here&rsquo;s the thing is, we&rsquo;re not even debating</p>
<p>policy right now. No one, no one really says that, hey, on a</p>
<p>policy basis, there&rsquo;s a huge difference between, say, Trump</p>
<p>and DeSantis or some other folks, it&rsquo;s all about personal</p>
<p>style. And is it really worth it to the republicans to potentially</p>
<p>lose the next election, based on personal based on style points,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a silly reason to lose, you know, William F. Buckley, a long</p>
<p>time ago said that he would always support the most</p>
<p>electable, conservative candidate, he didn&rsquo;t always go</p>
<p>with the most conservative candidate, he wanted to go with</p>
<p>the most electable candidate who met a basic policy bar. And</p>
<p>he sometimes got in trouble for that. For example, he supported</p>
<p>Bush 41 over jack Kemp. I know I&rsquo;m going back a long way. But</p>
<p>but in any event, you know, having thinking about</p>
<p>electability is just really important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one silver lining here, the head of the Republican</p>
<p>Party, Rupert Murdoch has absolutely dissed Trump. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you saw the New York Post, but he put on the cover</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a little lower, like 10 Florida man makes</p>
<p>announcement. And on page 26, he had the announcement of</p>
<p>Trump running for president. And the funny thing was the last</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch, he didn&rsquo;t even name Trump as the president of</p>
<p>the absolute last line of that column. And he said, Oh, and he</p>
<p>also happened to be the 45th President of the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was very funny.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing a lot of Republicans saying, I think</p>
<p>correctly, is that if you want to win elections, you have to</p>
<p>look out the windshield, you know, not in the rearview</p>
<p>mirror. And what we saw in the midterms is that even talking</p>
<p>about 2020 was at minimum, a giant waste of time and a</p>
<p>distraction and at maximum potentially cause these</p>
<p>candidates to lose. I mean, the fact of the matter is that that</p>
<p>a lot of candidates including some I supported in battleground</p>
<p>states who got lured into trying to re litigate 2020. They all</p>
<p>got vaporized. And I just think it&rsquo;s stupid to be talking about</p>
<p>the past. Voters want you to focus on the future. And</p>
<p>especially when there&rsquo;s no policy outcome, that matters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at stake for you to be talking about a past election,</p>
<p>instead of the future and the question is just politically</p>
<p>stupid.</p>
<p>Freeberg, if I may bring you into this discussion</p>
<p>uncomfortably, as it might as uncomfortable as it might be.</p>
<p>Would you vote for Biden? Incredibly old? I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be at one or 82. And the next election to vote for</p>
<p>Biden, or DeSantis</p>
<p>as I go through the list of things I&rsquo;m most concerned about</p>
<p>in the world today. Number one is the debt and spending cycle</p>
<p>of the federal government. In the US. I&rsquo;m I think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most kind of scary set of facts and conditions that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting set up for kind of a major crisis 10 to 15 years from</p>
<p>now. Because you can&rsquo;t afford all the debt that we&rsquo;ve taken on</p>
<p>as a country, as well as the entitlement as well as defense.</p>
<p>And so something&rsquo;s got to give and there&rsquo;s a bunch of paths</p>
<p>that could emerge from that set of conditions that are all</p>
<p>really scary paths and not good. I&rsquo;m more concerned about that</p>
<p>than I am about nuclear war, or climate change. Just to be</p>
<p>clear, because I think that the social effects and the global</p>
<p>geopolitical effects that arise from the US kind of destructuring</p>
<p>because of our debt and spending cycle that we&rsquo;re in right now,</p>
<p>are far more significant than what we&rsquo;ll experience over the</p>
<p>same period of time. And again, I do think that technology is</p>
<p>going to resolve a lot of our issues with climate change. And</p>
<p>I think nuclear war, cool heads will prevail. Everyone&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>family. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m most concerned about. So any kind of</p>
<p>voting decision I make is made with that lens, which is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best path to supporting some some sort of responsibility,</p>
<p>setback or step back to resolve those issues. As Charlie Munger</p>
<p>said so well in this interview that was published this week.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said it a few times on the show, but he did. He&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>much better speaker than I uses far fewer words. But you know,</p>
<p>in democracy, eventually, the populace realizes they can vote</p>
<p>themselves all the money. And, you know, that&rsquo;s what we see</p>
<p>happen in an accelerated way. In Latin America, we&rsquo;ve seen that</p>
<p>with a lot of these democracies that ultimately resolve to kind</p>
<p>of socialism. And in the US, we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of this</p>
<p>behavior where we&rsquo;re kind of voting ourselves all the money</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re putting in place politicians and the populace is</p>
<p>saying I want I want I want, and more money comes out. And it it</p>
<p>totally decreases the strength and the resiliency of our nation</p>
<p>and our economy. And it&rsquo;s the most concerning thing to me,</p>
<p>because the incredible innovation and economic engine</p>
<p>that is the United States is threatened. And it really</p>
<p>threatens a lot of stability in the world today.</p>
<p>Tremont, any any final thoughts here as we wrap up the political</p>
<p>discussion? You&rsquo;re obviously a democrat. So you&rsquo;re voting for</p>
<p>Biden, but you also care about fiscal responsibility. So where</p>
<p>are you at? With your vote for 2024?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we know who&rsquo;s actually running on either ticket</p>
<p>yet, just to be completely honest. So that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>perspective. My other comment is, I think what David said is</p>
<p>so spot on the single biggest issue that we have is that we</p>
<p>have made a huge decision to de globalize. And that de</p>
<p>globalization has the risk of introducing a hyperinflation</p>
<p>loop. And we won&rsquo;t know how bad that is for another year or two.</p>
<p>Why would it do that? Why would it? Well, think about it this</p>
<p>way. Inflation costs today. So today, let&rsquo;s just say you buy a</p>
<p>chip to make the iPhone, you buy that chip from, you know, TSMC</p>
<p>that makes it in Taiwan ships it to China. And the entire world</p>
<p>is serviced with that supply chain that keeps that chip as</p>
<p>cheap as possible. Now, with the chips act, as an example, we</p>
<p>will build resilient supply chains, where now instead of one</p>
<p>place, it&rsquo;ll come from six places, five of those six will</p>
<p>be in allied territories, the United States, Western Europe,</p>
<p>potentially Mexico. The thing with that is that that now is</p>
<p>six x more equipment that you&rsquo;re buying. Right? Instead of one</p>
<p>machine, you now have six machines. Instead of one person</p>
<p>operating the machine in one country, you have six people in</p>
<p>six countries. As you can imagine, when you layer up all</p>
<p>these costs, there is no world in which that chip is as cheap</p>
<p>as it was before. And so the cost of that has to be born</p>
<p>either by the consumer who pays a higher price, that&rsquo;s measured</p>
<p>as inflation, or by the government who subsidizes it at</p>
<p>the point of import, that&rsquo;ll be measured by debt. And so one way</p>
<p>or the other, in our in our path now towards more resiliency, and</p>
<p>national security, which by the way, I think is the absolute</p>
<p>right decision. Okay. Energy independence, all of this stuff</p>
<p>we have to do today, we are at risk of a hyper inflationary</p>
<p>loop, if not managed well. And so you have to be really on the</p>
<p>levers of the economy, and you have to understand it deeply.</p>
<p>The person that deserves the most credit of preventing this</p>
<p>hyper inflationary loop right now is Joe Manchin. And</p>
<p>hopefully the history books, whatever Jay Powell does, I</p>
<p>think has been good. But the fact that Manchin prevented 6</p>
<p>trillion more dollars of being pumped into the economy in the</p>
<p>last two years, is probably the single thing that prevented</p>
<p>inflation instead of being peaking at nine, from peaking at</p>
<p>15 or 16. I think it would have been a national disaster without</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>Chamath is right that extra 6 trillion that Manchester would</p>
<p>have been a national disaster. But let&rsquo;s also give credit to</p>
<p>every Republican because they also voted against it. I mean,</p>
<p>the fact that the pressure was on Manchin to do the thing and</p>
<p>see the forest from the trees and he did that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, look, I agree. I agree that I encourage, I agree that</p>
<p>he was in the hot seat. Well, so was cinema, by the way, cinema</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go for the three and a half trillion build back better.</p>
<p>But then Manchin, you went along with the $750 billion version of</p>
<p>BBB, which they renamed the Inflation Reduction Act, that</p>
<p>was kind of a disappointment. So, frankly, like I give more</p>
<p>credit to the Republicans, they were against all of it, and the</p>
<p>Democrats jammed it through. So if you&rsquo;re worried about all of</p>
<p>this trillions and trillions of unnecessary spending, why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you give the</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the delta between what was spent and what</p>
<p>could have been the entirety of the gap is really was prevented</p>
<p>by Joe Manchin.</p>
<p>I know, but it was Joe Manchin siding with the Republicans. My</p>
<p>point is, look, we got your point perfect on spending. They</p>
<p>both want to spend too much money. But at this particular</p>
<p>moment in time, the Republicans are more restrained about</p>
<p>spending than the Democrats.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to number one issue for each person. Hold on. Number one</p>
<p>issue for Freeberg is fiscal responsibility. I was going to</p>
<p>say the same thing. It is my number one issue in this next</p>
<p>election. I want to see austerity fiscal responsibility</p>
<p>and get this spending under control so that our kids do not</p>
<p>inherit, you know, stagflation, hyperinflation, or whatever</p>
<p>cocktail of disastrous economic policies we are handing to them.</p>
<p>What is your number one issue? sacks for 2024? If you had to</p>
<p>pick a number one issue? What would it be for David Sachs?</p>
<p>Look, I think it&rsquo;s simple. The President&rsquo;s job is to ensure</p>
<p>peace and prosperity. So you guys are talking about the</p>
<p>prosperity side, I think we do need fiscal responsibility, we</p>
<p>need to have a good economy. There&rsquo;s like a bundle of</p>
<p>policies that go into that starting with, I think, greater</p>
<p>fiscal restraint. And then on the peace side, I think we need</p>
<p>to adjust America&rsquo;s foreign policy to be less</p>
<p>interventionist. We&rsquo;re, you know, we&rsquo;re involving ourselves</p>
<p>here, there and everywhere all over the world. And I, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hopeful that what I&rsquo;m hearing out of the administration the</p>
<p>last couple weeks from Jake Sullivan for Millie, these are</p>
<p>some good things that I&rsquo;m hearing. But, you know, I would</p>
<p>like to see us dial back on the foreign interventionism.</p>
<p>If you had to 6040, that or whatever is one more important</p>
<p>the other or they both equal and then we&rsquo;ll go to both equal for</p>
<p>you, which one&rsquo;s more important?</p>
<p>Both? I mean, look, how can you have a successful United States</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re either in a recession or at war? You don&rsquo;t want any</p>
<p>either of those situations.</p>
<p>So those are your top two equally? What is it for you?</p>
<p>Chamath? What are you there?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a third one, which is culture, Jake out. So this</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s a little bit hard to categorize. But I do think</p>
<p>culture matters. And, you know, I want us to have a culture of</p>
<p>excellence. I want in the schools, for example, I think</p>
<p>schools should have grades, they should have advanced math, we</p>
<p>should hold our kids to a high standard, I think that we want</p>
<p>to have safe cities, we want to, you know, have cities where</p>
<p>crimes are out of control, we need to have, you know, a sound</p>
<p>border policy. So I think there&rsquo;s like a collection of</p>
<p>policies there under, you know, schools, crime border that are</p>
<p>sort of broadly cultural, I guess. But or maybe you could</p>
<p>call them quality of life issues. So you know, yeah, we</p>
<p>need to have a good economy, we need to stay out of foreign</p>
<p>wars, but also we need to have a high quality of life.</p>
<p>Can I steel man something for you? Because I, I really agree</p>
<p>with those three things, David, that you said, but I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spent a lot of time thinking about this. And my formation is</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s one thing that allows us to solve all three, if</p>
<p>you bear with me for a second. And I think that that is the</p>
<p>energy independence of the United States. If you look</p>
<p>inside of what&rsquo;s happening in the US today, the cost of</p>
<p>generating energy is effectively as cheap as it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever been, and as close to zero as it ever has been, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only going to get cheaper. The problem that we have is that we</p>
<p>have all of these decrepit laws and infrastructure and</p>
<p>regulatory capture, that causes us to always be in an imbalance.</p>
<p>And as a result, we do all kinds of crazy things. We borrow</p>
<p>enormous amounts of money to create subsidies, we go when we</p>
<p>fight all of these, you know, foreign wars that don&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense. We wrap the energy problem and set in climate</p>
<p>change language, which causes this cultural division. But my</p>
<p>belief, quite honestly, is that the reason the IRA was so</p>
<p>important is as it is the most clarified piece of legislation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen, that essentially puts all forms of energy on a</p>
<p>level playing field and has the chance to get America to</p>
<p>permanent energy independence. And if the cost of energy is</p>
<p>zero, and we can abundantly created in the United States,</p>
<p>what I think happens, David, is we have energy to rebuild our</p>
<p>supply chain much cheaper. So inflation gets under control, we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t borrow as much, we have a completely different lens on</p>
<p>foreign policy, so that this interventionism and fighting</p>
<p>over resources is much harder to justify. And we put the climate</p>
<p>change language aside, and we use energy independence as a</p>
<p>form of national security, which gives us the courage to battle</p>
<p>all these other cultural taboos that we otherwise have to say we</p>
<p>agree with, even if they don&rsquo;t necessarily make any sense. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of them. So I don&rsquo;t know my, my, my, my answer</p>
<p>to your question, Jason, is that one thing, if we accomplish in</p>
<p>the next five to 10 years, has a chance to really change the</p>
<p>course of the United States.</p>
<p>Right, man. So I&rsquo;m guessing then Biden&rsquo;s your vote, because if it</p>
<p>is, in fact, Biden, because Biden is the one who pushed for</p>
<p>these clean energy tax credits, and this policy in it, freeway,</p>
<p>but he also canceled, he also canceled our energy</p>
<p>independence. I mean, look, we were energy independent based on</p>
<p>fracking, you may not like fracking, but it did get us</p>
<p>energy independent, you may think that there&rsquo;s environmental</p>
<p>consequences to it that you don&rsquo;t like, and that has to be</p>
<p>balanced. But we did have</p>
<p>energy against fracking, I believe in that gas, I believe</p>
<p>in coal, actually, as a bridge fuel, I believe in all of these</p>
<p>things. I believe that these are all more important than going</p>
<p>off to all of these foreign lands, and trying to justify</p>
<p>spending trillions of dollars and putting 10s of 1000s of</p>
<p>American lives at risk, essentially for resources that</p>
<p>we can actually create for ourselves at home.</p>
<p>Well, I agree with you on that 100%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with, I mean, I&rsquo;ll tell you, like clean fracking as a</p>
<p>way as a bridge, go ahead to getting to, you know, more</p>
<p>independence through nuclear and renewables. Go ahead, freeberg.</p>
<p>Like I said before, China&rsquo;s declared that they&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>450 nuclear power plants, the net cost, effective cost of</p>
<p>electricity production out of a nuclear power plant is somewhere</p>
<p>between one and five cents per kilowatt hour, the US on average</p>
<p>is paying 11 to 15 cents per kilowatt hour. Nuclear is just</p>
<p>three utilities. So freeberg, that&rsquo;s with all the regulatory</p>
<p>capture and all that trash that you have to spend. For example,</p>
<p>we have to spend $220 billion a year to replace the power lines</p>
<p>in America by law. That&rsquo;s $2.2 trillion just there.</p>
<p>Right. And so the cost for solar and wind off grid, I think is</p>
<p>around three to seven cents a kilowatt hour in that range.</p>
<p>Right. So it gets nowadays, it&rsquo;s gotten much more competitive.</p>
<p>But I think that the nuclear solution is just not even being</p>
<p>engaged in the conversation. Now, I want to go back to the</p>
<p>previous point, which is because I didn&rsquo;t state the numbers</p>
<p>before. So I just want to state them because they&rsquo;re so shocking.</p>
<p>And this is what shocks me. The current federal debt is $30</p>
<p>trillion, our GDP is around 23 trillion 5% interest rates on</p>
<p>$30 trillion is one and a half trillion dollars in interest</p>
<p>payments alone every year. And our social security, so one and</p>
<p>a half trillion dollars, I mean, that alone is about 6%, 7% of</p>
<p>GDP. So you have to tax every transaction in the country by</p>
<p>six or 7%, just to pay the interest payments on the debt.</p>
<p>And then we have Medicare, and Social Security, which</p>
<p>that math is wrong, because you have maturities of all different</p>
<p>types with different yield to maturities and different coupons.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not today&rsquo;s numbers, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>over time. So as you look out, and you look at the, the yield</p>
<p>on treasuries, and you apply that to the current debt level</p>
<p>and the increment in the debt level, you&rsquo;ll get to that level,</p>
<p>right, you&rsquo;ll get to a trillion five a year, in interest</p>
<p>payments that need to be made, plus another call it three, four</p>
<p>or $5 trillion a year in mandatory spending. And so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the country starts to run into a problem. Because</p>
<p>at some point when you have to tax so much to cover the cash</p>
<p>payments that need to be made by the federal government, the</p>
<p>economy really gets hurt, and things start to cripple. And</p>
<p>then if you were to take those entitlements away, Social</p>
<p>Security, Medicare, you have a real problem with people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to support themselves in an economy where they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>working. These are elderly retired people. So there is a</p>
<p>mate at work to pay these expensive medical bills. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a major crash coming if we don&rsquo;t figure out how to</p>
<p>bridge our way to this gap. So if someone wants my vote, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to run for president, they would put up a</p>
<p>simple chart like Bill Clinton used to do, and show me a 10 to</p>
<p>30 year plan and just say, here&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed. And</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And that chart alone, I think can win the vote.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s pull up the chart then. So here is the federal</p>
<p>debt total public debt as a percentage of gross domestic</p>
<p>product. As you can see, in the 70s and 80s, we were at under</p>
<p>50%. The 90s, we started, you know, growing, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>this matters. I think everybody, every self proclaimed</p>
<p>intellectual looks at this chart and says, Oh, my God, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>exceeded 100%. You know, the the empire is going to go to</p>
<p>ruin. That&rsquo;s not why the empire goes to ruin, we have the</p>
<p>reserve currency of the of the world. And there&rsquo;s an enormous</p>
<p>amount of power that comes from that position. So what the right</p>
<p>number is, is TBD. That&rsquo;s the most honest way to think about</p>
<p>it. It was 100. It&rsquo;s at 150. It could go to 200. Many countries</p>
<p>operate at levels above us and still haven&rsquo;t imploded, per se.</p>
<p>The real thing is what part of what Friedberg said is, look, if</p>
<p>you really want to look at what we pay, today, we pay $400</p>
<p>billion this year, that&rsquo;s the interest payments, okay, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you calculate all of the different maturities we have,</p>
<p>with all of the different coupons we have, that&rsquo;s what we</p>
<p>owe today. And David is right, mathematically, that if interest</p>
<p>rates go to 5%, and stay there forever, but we know that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not how economies work, they ebb and flow. Okay. So the real</p>
<p>problem that we have to understand is how do you</p>
<p>actually create enough growth. And then the next time that we</p>
<p>have a meaningful fall in interest rates, like every other</p>
<p>person does, you know, look, a lot of people in America know</p>
<p>how to refi their credit cards, refi their home loans, refi</p>
<p>their mortgages, the United States could have had a much</p>
<p>more aggressive and thoughtful strategy of refi by pushing out</p>
<p>these maturities way into the future. And again, Trump</p>
<p>actually suggested that but because he sounded like a</p>
<p>goofball, everybody said absolutely no way. But in</p>
<p>hindsight, that one move would have saved us trillions of</p>
<p>dollars over the next decade if we had done it. And this time</p>
<p>around, we have to have politicians who are smart enough</p>
<p>and have the wherewithal to say, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where this</p>
<p>idea came from. It&rsquo;s really smart. rates are now back to 2%</p>
<p>or one and a half percent. Let&rsquo;s now issue 50 and 100 year bonds.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s refi this problem out into the future. That makes a</p>
<p>ton of sense. And we have to do it.</p>
<p>The refi makes a ton of sense. Just to pull up a chart here.</p>
<p>And to counter your position there that it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>tomorrow. Maybe you can respond to if you look at GDP ratios</p>
<p>here. Number one, two, and three, Japan, Venezuela, Greece,</p>
<p>Sudan. And, you know, you know, some smaller countries there,</p>
<p>but United States,</p>
<p>none of these countries, none of these countries, look, this</p>
<p>entire world runs on the US dollar complex. Whenever we</p>
<p>raise rates, yes, it is true that on the one hand, our</p>
<p>interest payments go up, but proportionately and on a</p>
<p>relative basis, he I think I think maybe let me take a step</p>
<p>back, look, what are the most important things in investing,</p>
<p>which is appropriate here is that people ask, what is the</p>
<p>price of a stock? Well, before you go public, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>calculating what the intrinsic value of a company is, okay, all</p>
<p>the things that they do all the money that they make, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what we think it&rsquo;s theoretically work worth. But the minute</p>
<p>it goes public, the intrinsic value no longer matters. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what is it valued relative to everything else. Okay. The</p>
<p>United States is a relative, if it&rsquo;s a stock, if all these</p>
<p>countries are stocks, we are valued relatively to others, not</p>
<p>not intrinsically. And the reason why we have so much power</p>
<p>is because everybody else is actually valued relative to us.</p>
<p>So this is why I think the right thing to look at Jason is the</p>
<p>rate of change of debt to GDP for the entire G eight, or G 20</p>
<p>or the rest of the world. And what you&rsquo;ll see is something</p>
<p>that goes up into the right. Nobody in the world has been</p>
<p>rewarded for not investing in their populations and bought and</p>
<p>basically borrowing from tomorrow to invest in today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>human capital. Okay, so we have a disagreement here. Freeberg,</p>
<p>you think this is a major issue? Yeah, because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>manageable. Freeberg. Yeah, for</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s two things that are missing. One is the</p>
<p>inflationary effect. So you look at that list of countries that</p>
<p>are there, they&rsquo;re paying higher interest, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>paying in the form of inflation. So they have less that they can</p>
<p>spend on their people. And ultimately, what ends up</p>
<p>happening, it&rsquo;s just simple arithmetic. It&rsquo;s not about</p>
<p>relative value of a currency. It&rsquo;s the arithmetic that we have</p>
<p>a check we have to write every month to pay for Medicare and</p>
<p>Social Security. And it is written into law, what that</p>
<p>check needs to be. And the rate at which we&rsquo;re having to write</p>
<p>those checks, the increment of those checks is going up so</p>
<p>significantly that when you add on the interest payments, and you</p>
<p>look at those checks, and then you add on defense, something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got to give because you cannot raise taxes in the amount that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>needed to fund all of that outlay without this causing</p>
<p>either number one, massive inflation, if you just take on</p>
<p>more debt, or number two, you know, significant loss of</p>
<p>services, either Social Security, Medicare or defense,</p>
<p>and so something&rsquo;s going to give and the distribution I think is</p>
<p>not being discussed.</p>
<p>So I just want just one point the President&rsquo;s budget.</p>
<p>Anybody who is a president of the United States gets hold of</p>
<p>their annual budget, it&rsquo;s about five and a half trillion dollars</p>
<p>this year. So you&rsquo;re talking about interest payments that are</p>
<p>still less than 10% of their total budget. Now that includes</p>
<p>the entitlement payments, okay, so about $3 billion, $3 trillion,</p>
<p>sorry, three and a half trillion is what you have to pay for 20%</p>
<p>now $3 trillion is the sum of Medicare and Social Security.</p>
<p>Okay, so the President still has one and a half to $2 trillion</p>
<p>of leeway, of which a quarter are debt payments. So my</p>
<p>perspective, quite honestly, is mathematically, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>room to run here, before these things get really out of</p>
<p>control. And even if they do, I think the relative problem is</p>
<p>for the rest of the world will be so egregious, that the</p>
<p>ability for the United States to go to those banks and those</p>
<p>economies, and basically sell in more us debt is quite high</p>
<p>because they cannot afford to own debt in their own country.</p>
<p>So if you think that the United States is bad, go back to that</p>
<p>list. Guess what those central banks in those countries are</p>
<p>going to be buying us dollars faster than they can go out of</p>
<p>stock unless we see some union of India, China, Saudi Arabia,</p>
<p>Russia, Japan, Brazil, obviously not Japan, but some some of that</p>
<p>consortia will become a closer trading partner, and perhaps</p>
<p>could cause a shift in the balance of the dominance of the</p>
<p>US dollar. And that&rsquo;s one path to consider.</p>
<p>Saks, what do you think of the balance sheet here? Obviously,</p>
<p>we have two opposing opinions here from Chamath and Friberg.</p>
<p>Where do you stand on the United States balance sheet?</p>
<p>Over our skis?</p>
<p>Yes, the balance sheet is a disaster. What are we at like</p>
<p>130% of debt to GDP? I mean, we have like 30. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even stable. I mean, we</p>
<p>27% of GDP right now 27% it should be 15%. Right. So the</p>
<p>spending, where does that number come from? Why? There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bunch of economists who have shared these papers.</p>
<p>morons, morons, fake experts, fake experts.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on. If you look at sex, if you look at government</p>
<p>tax receipts over time, with all different kinds of tax rates,</p>
<p>including very, very different top marginal tax rates, what you</p>
<p>see is that federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP is in the</p>
<p>17 to 19% range. And like the best years you make 19% it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually in a good economy. And in a bad economy, it&rsquo;s like 17%.</p>
<p>And it really it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether Reagan was president or</p>
<p>Clint, Bill Clinton, and so on. So there&rsquo;s only so much blood</p>
<p>you can get from a stone. And historically, spending was</p>
<p>around 19% of GDP. And so you would have a one or 2% you know,</p>
<p>deficit every year. And that really accelerated first, you</p>
<p>had the financial crisis of 2008. And then you had COVID.</p>
<p>And free works, right, you know, we we went from call it, you</p>
<p>know, 20% of GDP spending to roughly 30% or more during</p>
<p>COVID, as kind of this emergency measure. But like</p>
<p>everything else in government, you know, the emergency measure</p>
<p>becomes a permanent program. So now we&rsquo;re at 27%. It doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to be going down. And the Democrats want a lot more. I</p>
<p>mean, we talked about it build back better would have been</p>
<p>three and a half trillion, instead of 750 billion, if they</p>
<p>just had one or two more votes. So hold on. So so free burgers,</p>
<p>right, there&rsquo;s like nothing stable about the point we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the point we&rsquo;re at is bad on its own terms, having 30</p>
<p>trillion of debt, let&rsquo;s say that interest rates stabilize</p>
<p>at 3%. That&rsquo;s still a trillion a year of debt service, which is</p>
<p>more than not a trillion. If interest rates stabilize at 3%,</p>
<p>which is optimistic, and we&rsquo;re servicing a trillion, sorry, 30</p>
<p>trillion of debt, that&rsquo;s roughly a billion dollars a year of debt</p>
<p>service payments. That could be spent on other things. Guys</p>
<p>keep saying billion when it&rsquo;s a trillion.</p>
<p>The average yield to maturity needs to be factored in there.</p>
<p>So over a 15 year period, David, you would be right</p>
<p>mathematically, if all matured, but that&rsquo;s not what this is,</p>
<p>because you we are you&rsquo;d have to refi and reissue a bunch of debt</p>
<p>that is at lower yield right now at these interest rates. I want</p>
<p>to be clear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how any of this is good. I mean, remember,</p>
<p>I understand. Let your mouth say why I&rsquo;m good or not. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying that this is a good or it&rsquo;s a trend. What I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>I have this issue that all of a sudden people make up and you</p>
<p>guys are doing it now. An arbitrary number with no</p>
<p>rooting in history or fact and say this is bad. And all I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is, I know it feels bad to us. And I think we would all</p>
<p>run this country differently. If we could control the balance</p>
<p>sheet, I would as well. I would try to get debt way way down. I</p>
<p>would try to get deficits way way down. But all I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>using this justification of an arbitrary number always falls</p>
<p>flat. So I&rsquo;m encouraging us all. Let&rsquo;s find a better model of</p>
<p>reasoning. Because every time we point to some randos book and</p>
<p>say 127% is bad. Nobody listens. And I think the message</p>
<p>that you should take away is is because it&rsquo;s imprecise, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not rooted in any actual logic. And if there&rsquo;s a better, the</p>
<p>reason I believe that this is concerning is, I look at the top</p>
<p>10 countries that have, you know, debt ratios that seem out</p>
<p>of whack. And I think, wow, what is their fortune been for the</p>
<p>last 10 years vis a vis Japan and Venezuela, the right</p>
<p>comparison, the right comparison. Okay, go back and</p>
<p>say, look, look at the British Empire. And when and what was</p>
<p>the debt to GDP when it started to actually fall off?</p>
<p>collapsed.</p>
<p>I know lapsed. No, I&rsquo;m saying, okay, was it triggered? Was it</p>
<p>triggered by debt to GDP? And I think your answer will be in</p>
<p>part, I, again,</p>
<p>ruinous, they took on ruinous debt, and they couldn&rsquo;t maintain</p>
<p>their empire anymore. And the whole thing collapsed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just asking for some numerical specificity.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>The last time there was a lot of numerical specificity, there</p>
<p>was a ton of work that&rsquo;s been done on</p>
<p>pulling shit out of their ass. So tell us that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>historically the best way to manage the growth in an in a in</p>
<p>a country is to have deficit spending be equal to or less</p>
<p>than the growth rate of the economy of that country. So for</p>
<p>example, if your income, the the tax revenue that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>generated by the government is equal to say 15% of GDP, you do</p>
<p>not want your spending to be more than 17 or 18%. If the</p>
<p>economic growth rate is two to 3%. That&rsquo;s it. If you do</p>
<p>anything more than that, what happens? No, if you do anything</p>
<p>more than that you&rsquo;re borrowing from the future to pay for</p>
<p>today. That&rsquo;s the simple truth. Okay, so what happens? And when</p>
<p>you do that the rates go up and the prices go up and eventually</p>
<p>your currency doesn&rsquo;t work. So you&rsquo;re making a bet. Read the</p>
<p>book that I talked about last year, the most recent Ray Dalio</p>
<p>book, he goes through six stories with the economic data</p>
<p>to prove it, the factual data, the history of what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>with six empires over the last 500 years, where this exact same</p>
<p>scenario has played out. This isn&rsquo;t some random arbitrary</p>
<p>story. I read that book. And everyone in that everyone had</p>
<p>the exact same perspective that you have when they were living</p>
<p>in those days. And they said, You know what, we&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>okay, because we&rsquo;re the reserve currency. And the world loves</p>
<p>us. And we&rsquo;re the empire. And we have influence everywhere. And</p>
<p>they all lost primacy, and their currencies collapsed. And they</p>
<p>all broke apart. And I&rsquo;m not saying that that can&rsquo;t happen in</p>
<p>America. What I&rsquo;m saying is, you get so full throated. I read</p>
<p>that book. It&rsquo;s great narrative, but the numbers are brittle.</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re fragile, and they&rsquo;re mostly made up.</p>
<p>Everyone can read it on that.</p>
<p>So I so all I&rsquo;m saying is, in the absence, in the absence of</p>
<p>numerical specificity, I agree with you that this trend is</p>
<p>alarming, and it&rsquo;s bad. I agree with you. And I agree that we</p>
<p>should spend a lot less. What I&rsquo;m saying is when you say to</p>
<p>the world, stop spending because XYZ number is bad. You have no</p>
<p>credibility because it&rsquo;s not something that you can actually</p>
<p>back up. And all I&rsquo;m saying is, if you could find a better</p>
<p>logical argument, you would probably get a lot more people</p>
<p>to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just being ignorant. You&rsquo;re ignoring it. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying you don&rsquo;t want to actually believe it. The</p>
<p>numbers are there. I&rsquo;m not saying ignorant in a</p>
<p>disparaging way. I&rsquo;m saying you&rsquo;re literally just ignoring</p>
<p>the data.</p>
<p>Show me the numbers.</p>
<p>Show them to me.</p>
<p>They get upset at us for fighting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make you a PDF, Jamal. I&rsquo;ll send it to you tonight. I</p>
<p>promise. And I&rsquo;ll post it on our friggin thing so people can</p>
<p>watch it.</p>
<p>All right, listen, the group chat is going to be on fire this</p>
<p>weekend. Saks, final word for you.</p>
<p>Okay, final word. Okay.</p>
<p>Final word, please.</p>
<p>Jamal and I have never gotten into it before like this, but</p>
<p>yeah, obviously we&rsquo;re on opposite sides.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I still respect and love you, Jamal. Go ahead.</p>
<p>If you go back in history and look at debt to GDP levels, the</p>
<p>only other time where anything remotely like the level we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>right now is right after World War Two, when we had just saved</p>
<p>the world from Nazism. Okay, that was worth going into debt</p>
<p>for. You look today, what is it that we&rsquo;ve gotten into this</p>
<p>130% debt to GDP? What is this $30 trillion of debt for? What</p>
<p>have we bought with all that money? Huge amounts of it have</p>
<p>been squandered.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And Biden wanted more. If the courts didn&rsquo;t stop him, he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t spend a trillion for giving a bunch of student loans</p>
<p>to for basketball degrees or liberal studies or whatever.</p>
<p>Graduate degrees at Brown.</p>
<p>Let me finish. That&rsquo;s point number one is that this money is</p>
<p>being squandered at levels we&rsquo;ve never seen before. And the</p>
<p>squandering is continuing. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ve reached a steady</p>
<p>state. It just keeps going and going.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t precisely say when it&rsquo;s going to break, but I do know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to break. The other thing, point number two, is</p>
<p>about consequences today. There is a phenomenon economists call</p>
<p>crowding out, where when interest rates go up, more and</p>
<p>more money flows into the risk free rate of return. And then</p>
<p>that crowds out investment capital. And we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>it on the last pod where if the risk free rate is 5%, and then</p>
<p>like high quality corporate bonds are offering eight to 10%.</p>
<p>Now equity investments must generate 15%. And VC must</p>
<p>generate 20%. And there are very few VC investments that can</p>
<p>generate that kind of IRR. So what happens, the money flows</p>
<p>out of VC, and there&rsquo;s less money for risk capital. What</p>
<p>drives our economy risk taking?</p>
<p>David on for North ship. So hold on a second. So this massive</p>
<p>debt service that we have, which drives up interest rates will</p>
<p>crowd out the very kind of economic activity that the</p>
<p>United States needs to stay on the cutting edge.</p>
<p>rebuttal to the rebuttal to the rebuttal. No, you&rsquo;re so right.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you just bookend the argument exactly the way you</p>
<p>just did. My point is not that you said it just before that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know at what upper bound these things break or don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break. And all I&rsquo;m saying is every time you throw up a random</p>
<p>number, you guys sound like the boy who cries wolf, okay, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re shouting into a vacuum is, is just the is the advice</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to give you guys, I agree with you. I spend</p>
<p>my entire days investing in and trying to figure out what is the</p>
<p>risk adjusted rate of return of the things that I&rsquo;m doing. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to tell you as somebody with some reasonable</p>
<p>financial numeracy, every time I hear you or Ray Dalio, or</p>
<p>somebody else say, this number is where it all breaks, and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t, you lose a little bit of credibility, then you go to</p>
<p>this number, and you&rsquo;re like, Oh, I know 127.</p>
<p>Okay, we get your point.</p>
<p>No, let me put it back. How much is too much? How much debt can</p>
<p>we handle? And how much spending as a percentage GDP should we</p>
<p>handle? What is the limit in your mind? And how do you decide</p>
<p>what that limit can or should be?</p>
<p>I think the honest answer is every time that I have been</p>
<p>alarmed that we had hit a threshold that was meaningful.</p>
<p>So for example, like I think under Obama, we passed 100. And</p>
<p>it felt very scary, because I was like, wow, that seems like a</p>
<p>demarcation. It turned out to not be a demarcation at all.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s relative to every other country and what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through. And I understand that you don&rsquo;t want to believe</p>
<p>that. But I do think that America&rsquo;s economic vitality is</p>
<p>not an independent function, it is a dependent function on</p>
<p>everybody else, we are relative to everybody else, if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>different cosmos and a different planet somewhere, maybe this</p>
<p>will all reset, but right now it&rsquo;s not. And so we all trade</p>
<p>relative to the United States. And in as much, I would like to</p>
<p>just say, I don&rsquo;t know enough to guess what this number is. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather focus on what David said, which is, there are things</p>
<p>that we need to do that we need to incentivize people to invest</p>
<p>in extreme risk taking that create new businesses that move</p>
<p>the world forward. You can have that conversation without belly</p>
<p>aching and crying to mommy about a GD debt to GDP number because</p>
<p>every time you throw it out there, nobody knows what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about. Nobody knows what reaction to have. And everybody</p>
<p>feels over time, David Friedberg, that you&rsquo;re crying</p>
<p>wolf. So all I&rsquo;m saying is, I get that it&rsquo;s concerning to you</p>
<p>and it creates anxiety. But every time you and you probably</p>
<p>this is not the first time you&rsquo;ve had anxiety, you probably</p>
<p>had anxiety at 5075 100125. Guess what, I bet you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>anxiety at 150. I don&rsquo;t know what it means. I do know what</p>
<p>sacks means, though, which is that right now we have a risk</p>
<p>free rate that&rsquo;s going to five, we have corporate bonds, it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be a 10. We have equity investing, the most risk taking,</p>
<p>which is the early stage venture that has to return 25. And that</p>
<p>is an incredibly high bar. But we need to do it. And we need to</p>
<p>do maybe fewer investments, quite honestly, with fewer</p>
<p>participants with less dollars that are more effectively put to</p>
<p>work. Okay, maybe this is a good jumping off point to talk about</p>
<p>all the waste in Silicon Valley. And that stuff can happen</p>
<p>without debating incessantly, this debt to GDP number, which</p>
<p>honestly,</p>
<p>all right, Freiburg sacks, and then we&rsquo;re gonna move. Go. I</p>
<p>agree. I&rsquo;ve never had anxiety about debt to GDP. It&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>been anything on my radar. The conversation I&rsquo;m trying to have</p>
<p>today is the amount of spending the federal spending, including</p>
<p>interest payments, as a percent of the GDP as a percent of how</p>
<p>much we can tax to pay all those to make all those payments every</p>
<p>year. And so what I&rsquo;m concerned about is the ballooning cost of</p>
<p>paying out all the obligations the federal government has to say</p>
<p>something different than what you were just saying. That&rsquo;s if</p>
<p>you were cared about only that, then refinancing the debt is an</p>
<p>equally valid proposition and changing the rate expense. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the only expense. So interest payments are ballooning. In</p>
<p>addition to interest payments, Social Security and Medicare</p>
<p>payments are also ballooning, and defense out of control</p>
<p>spending. Everybody has their hand out. Everybody wants an air</p>
<p>drop those four big categories together. You don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>room left.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about discipline in spending in defense. Great. I</p>
<p>agree. You&rsquo;re talking about discipline and capping health</p>
<p>care costs. Great. I agree. What does that have to do with this</p>
<p>other orthogonal thing you&rsquo;ve been talking about, which is</p>
<p>this random number debt to GDP. It doesn&rsquo;t mean let&rsquo;s move on</p>
<p>from that discussion.</p>
<p>One final point that we can move on. So so look, I think time for</p>
<p>the final point. Go. It&rsquo;s important discussion. Apparently</p>
<p>luck in the in the interest of bestie harmony. I will partially</p>
<p>agree with the point that your mouth is making, which is that</p>
<p>for a long time in American politics, people have sort of</p>
<p>cried wolf about debt to GDP. For example, if you remember way</p>
<p>back in 1992, Ross Perot, basically based his candidacy on</p>
<p>the idea that the US was racking up way too much debt. You know</p>
<p>what debt to GDP was in 1992? 41%. Okay, so people used to</p>
<p>care a lot about this. I remember when Reagan was</p>
<p>president and jet to GDP was 30%. People were saying that he</p>
<p>was this like, you know, wild spender. Okay. But I think that</p>
<p>precisely because nothing broke at 3040 80% 100%, you then had</p>
<p>the rise of this theory called MMT or modern monetary theory,</p>
<p>which said that the debt to GDP debts don&rsquo;t matter. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the reserve currency, you can print as much money as you want.</p>
<p>And so people started indulging in this. And so now I actually</p>
<p>think we are at a point I can&rsquo;t say precisely where it breaks.</p>
<p>But I do think that because debt to GDP didn&rsquo;t seem to matter for</p>
<p>so long, I actually think we got carried away. And now we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>levels which are just going to be ruinous, if for no other</p>
<p>reason than our debt service is going to crowd out. Whether you</p>
<p>want more guns or more butter in our federal budget, if you want</p>
<p>more defense spending, you want more entitlements, you want more</p>
<p>discretionary spending, there&rsquo;s no question that debt service is</p>
<p>getting bigger and bigger is going to crowd out those</p>
<p>programs, there&rsquo;s no question we need to spend less, I 100% agree</p>
<p>with you. Okay. But all I&rsquo;m saying is, we should spend less</p>
<p>on defense, because we have different ways of defending</p>
<p>ourselves. That should be the logical argument for less</p>
<p>energy independence is defense, and a balanced budget could be</p>
<p>defense as well. If you look at the IRA, that was less than a</p>
<p>trillion dollars over a decade. Okay, that has the potential to</p>
<p>shift trillions of dollars a year in defense spending. Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, okay. So let me wrap. Okay, let me wrap here for a</p>
<p>second. Thank you. You can look at these bills in and of</p>
<p>themselves, and try to actually do the right thing. Without</p>
<p>wrapping up all of these random arguments. And I by the way, just</p>
<p>to be clear, I don&rsquo;t believe in it. Don&rsquo;t do it. Don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s worst moderator. Come on.</p>
<p>Actually, during the Obama presidency, we had a thing</p>
<p>called the sequester. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember this.</p>
<p>Yeah. Republicans and Democrats agreed that basically that</p>
<p>because we had just had like these trillion dollar deficits</p>
<p>because of the 2008 global financial crisis, they got</p>
<p>together and said, Listen, we&rsquo;re going to hold the line on</p>
<p>spending. And there&rsquo;ll be no increase on defense spending in</p>
<p>exchange for no increase in discretionary spending social</p>
<p>programs. And for a few years, we held the line on spending</p>
<p>actually. And then of course, both Democrats, Republicans</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want that for different reasons. And the sequester went</p>
<p>away. We need to go back to something like that.</p>
<p>There are two things.</p>
<p>One detail, like when you go and send a bill, so look the way you</p>
<p>pass a bill, right, you have to send it to the CBO to get</p>
<p>scored. One of the things that I learned this week is that</p>
<p>sometimes the CBO and they&rsquo;re not really empowered to actually</p>
<p>tell you how things get offset. So for example, like if you have</p>
<p>a medicine, what they will do is say, well, we&rsquo;ll look at at the</p>
<p>population level, how much would this medicine cost if it&rsquo;s taken</p>
<p>by the population. But if that medicine then all of a sudden</p>
<p>has the potential to actually off ramp you over here, those</p>
<p>savings are not really factored in as well. So David, to your</p>
<p>point, another way that we can refine how we build budgets to</p>
<p>make sure that we&rsquo;re not overspending is to actually</p>
<p>improve the toolkit and the data that like the CBO is given so</p>
<p>that when they score things, they can actually look at the</p>
<p>total impact. Like for example, like the IRA. Again, one of the</p>
<p>biggest benefits will be to defend spending. If we choose to</p>
<p>make those cuts, you will be able to do it differently once</p>
<p>we have, you know, no reliance on foreign energy.</p>
<p>Okay, to wrap this segment, the first segment, which took 57</p>
<p>minutes. So obviously, really, well, I think it&rsquo;s an important</p>
<p>discussion. Hey, Jake, how would you vote for DeSantis to be</p>
<p>promises fiscal responsibility?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing, I am going to take a look at the</p>
<p>candidates, I&rsquo;m going to make the best decision in terms of</p>
<p>what I think is that that&rsquo;s for the country.</p>
<p>Giving no answer to this.</p>
<p>If DeSantis gives you everything you want a fiscal policy, why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you vote for him?</p>
<p>If he stays out if he if he&rsquo;s in favor of a woman&rsquo;s right to</p>
<p>choose</p>
<p>for the first 15 weeks, that&rsquo;s Florida policy. Are you? Yes.</p>
<p>You know, I would take a look. I would take a look.</p>
<p>I honestly would take a look not to vote for him 15 weeks right</p>
<p>to choose, combined with fiscal responsibility.</p>
<p>I I&rsquo;m voting for a moderate this time. And tax cuts. Okay, but</p>
<p>to wrap up here, the two things that matter, I believe, and</p>
<p>based on our panels discussion, austerity and excellence are</p>
<p>what are going to get us out of this mess. Here&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>platform seems to be shaping up our 2024 platform control</p>
<p>spending. Everybody here thinks that&rsquo;s important. Energy</p>
<p>independence. Everybody here thinks that&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>Stop fighting unnecessary wars, and maybe rethinking our foreign</p>
<p>policy. I think we all agree on that. And the cultural focus on</p>
<p>excellence, not excess. This is shaping up to be a little bit of</p>
<p>an all in platform here. Great discussion, everybody. Speaking</p>
<p>of austerity measures, I think, you know, we should just talk</p>
<p>right, right up top here about what&rsquo;s going on at Google. Chris</p>
<p>hone, I believe is how you pronounce his name. Chris own,</p>
<p>he sent a letter to Google and Amazon, Amazon today, after</p>
<p>already announcing 10,000 layoffs. They just said again,</p>
<p>and he said, prepare for more layoffs in 2023. And these are</p>
<p>not factory workers. These are white collar, high paying jobs</p>
<p>that are being laid off here. They&rsquo;re surplus elites, surplus</p>
<p>elites. It is definitely a part of the zeitgeist right now. So</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to reduce headcount massively. But in this</p>
<p>letter to shareholders, he points out, notably, not just</p>
<p>hey, Google needs to do a riff a reduction in force. But he</p>
<p>points out a more granular point that I want the panel to talk</p>
<p>about here, which is, he says, Hey, you need to reduce the</p>
<p>actual salaries at Google, the average salary being $296,000 67%</p>
<p>higher than an incredibly well paying workforce, Microsoft</p>
<p>quote, we acknowledge that alphabet employs some of the</p>
<p>most talented and brightest computer scientists and</p>
<p>engineers. But these represent only a fraction of the employee</p>
<p>base, many employees are performing general sales</p>
<p>marketing and administrative jobs, who should be compensated</p>
<p>in line with other technology companies. And he says we need</p>
<p>to establish an EBITDA margin target, as you can see in this</p>
<p>chart, and reduce the losses on other bets, perhaps increasing</p>
<p>share buybacks as well. So what we&rsquo;re looking at here. Now after</p>
<p>what an incredible business, my god, I mean, the business is</p>
<p>nuts. freeberg, you worked there, what in this rings true</p>
<p>to you? Or not? And then how many people does Google need to</p>
<p>employ to operate the business and invest in the future of the</p>
<p>business in your mind? They have 187,000 employees at Google.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s grown 24.5% rounded up 25% year over year, they grew 25%</p>
<p>year over year in their business. How many people need</p>
<p>to run this business to have it aggressively grow?</p>
<p>Look, I think there are two main drivers of the issue that</p>
<p>Google maybe meta, maybe Twitter, prior to Elon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>involvement, and really Silicon Valley as a whole, the bigger</p>
<p>companies have faced the first is the war for talent. The war</p>
<p>for talent started, I mentioned this last time around 2004 2005.</p>
<p>Because prior to that, there weren&rsquo;t as many grads coming out</p>
<p>of undergrad with computer science degrees, right? I think</p>
<p>10% of grads in the Bay Area schools were finishing with</p>
<p>computer science degrees. Today, the number is like 60%. So you</p>
<p>know, around that time, the war for talent led organizations,</p>
<p>particularly Google down a path of offering more perks and</p>
<p>benefits to their employees to create a workplace that was more</p>
<p>competitive. And that ends up being a slippery slope, because</p>
<p>then other organizations try and find parity, and then other</p>
<p>organizations try and overdo it and push it even further. So</p>
<p>this leads to both wage inflation across the, the</p>
<p>ecosystem, but it&rsquo;s also led to almost like the acceptance or</p>
<p>the allowance for degrees of complacency. And so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying that the workforce is all complacent. But I do think that</p>
<p>complacency is forgiven some amount of complacency, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to take a Friday off, I&rsquo;m going to take two Fridays off, all of</p>
<p>a sudden, I&rsquo;m not working any Fridays. The other thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened is as this workforce has aged, I worked at Google 20</p>
<p>years ago. And a lot of the folks I work with almost all of</p>
<p>them now have families at the time, everyone was young. And as</p>
<p>the demographics of Silicon Valley has matured, you have</p>
<p>more people that are less about killing themselves and giving</p>
<p>everything that they have to their organization. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more interested in being with their families and now spending</p>
<p>less time at work, especially in light of the fact that</p>
<p>compensation has ballooned to a point that you can now live a</p>
<p>very, very comfortable lifestyle. And you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>have a big payday in order to be able to take really good care of</p>
<p>your family, which was the case as a startup. And then the other</p>
<p>issue is just one of innovation. At Google, if you work on a new</p>
<p>project, and it doesn&rsquo;t work, there&rsquo;s no loss, you still have</p>
<p>your job. And they&rsquo;ve started programs, or they&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>equity and new startup ideas, or they&rsquo;ll give you all this stuff.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll give you upside, if you win, they&rsquo;ll give you bonuses</p>
<p>if it succeeds, but there&rsquo;s no downside. And so the pain and the</p>
<p>burn that you would feel as a startup founder, or as someone</p>
<p>building a new business isn&rsquo;t experienced or realized. And I</p>
<p>cannot I don&rsquo;t need to tell you guys this. But for anyone else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s listening that may not really be fully aware, the lack</p>
<p>of pain, the lack of risk, the lack of downside, the lack of</p>
<p>having no safety net and, and falling through the pits removes</p>
<p>all so much of the incentive to succeed, and to drive and to</p>
<p>innovate. And I think that&rsquo;s become part of the complacency</p>
<p>problem. That&rsquo;s caused larger organizations to simply say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s throw more heads at the problem. And when you just throw</p>
<p>more heads at the problem, you have more of kind of talent war</p>
<p>problem that I mentioned, number one,</p>
<p>what is the average salary? 280,000? 300,000? Rounded up?</p>
<p>Yeah. That doesn&rsquo;t cloud. I don&rsquo;t know if that includes</p>
<p>benefits, whatever. Let&rsquo;s just call it 300,000. Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that those people should</p>
<p>all get fired. But I know it speak, it speaks to the fact I</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re wonderful people. They&rsquo;re some of my best friends</p>
<p>work at Google. It&rsquo;s a great organization. People do</p>
<p>incredible work there. But in terms of return of dollars</p>
<p>invested as a shareholder, that&rsquo;s the question. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the analysis. That&rsquo;s the scope that the shareholder is</p>
<p>looking at is do I want to spend $1 to make $1 five? Or do I only</p>
<p>want to spend $1 where I know I&rsquo;m going to get $1 80 back. And</p>
<p>so if you just bucketed where the dollars are going, you would</p>
<p>end up saying you know what, I&rsquo;d rather just focus on the places</p>
<p>where I spend $1 and I get $2 back or $1 80 back. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to do any of the stuff where I spend $1 make $1 five</p>
<p>back. And that&rsquo;s called ROIC or return on invested capital. And</p>
<p>that includes return on invested human capital. And so the</p>
<p>analyst in the stock that that&rsquo;s an investor in the stock will</p>
<p>look at it through that lens. Whereas everyone that&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>there is still contributing meaningfully, they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>doing valuable work. But in terms of return on invested</p>
<p>capital, a good chunk of the projects are not driving the</p>
<p>majority of the value, a minority of the projects and</p>
<p>minority of the headcount is driving almost all the value.</p>
<p>I mean, if you sensitize that to what you said, David, a, if it</p>
<p>was just 75, or a half that number, then, you know, the</p>
<p>stock goes up 35% overnight. And if it goes up to the full</p>
<p>number, yep, the stock goes up 65% overnight.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s totally feasible. And then and then I think what</p>
<p>you do is you take $10 billion a year, and you have a high</p>
<p>accountability model that you speak to the street about. And</p>
<p>you say, here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to hold ourselves accountable</p>
<p>to investing the $10 billion every year, and not just have</p>
<p>everything be a nebulous 15 year project. And then it&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>15 year project. And you&rsquo;re always just burning cash to go</p>
<p>after those projects that are highly nebulous.</p>
<p>If you had to steel man the other side, I think the</p>
<p>argument would be I would say they would make probably three</p>
<p>arguments. Argument number one is like, look, don&rsquo;t get overly</p>
<p>distracted by other bets, because it&rsquo;s a small category of</p>
<p>spend. And we&rsquo;ve contained that cost pretty rationally, relative</p>
<p>to the rest of the core business. The second thing that</p>
<p>they would probably say is, there&rsquo;s an enormous amount of</p>
<p>work that is never seen by Wall Street that explains how good</p>
<p>our services, whether that&rsquo;s, you know, in early iterations of,</p>
<p>you know, technical capability, like GFS, and Bigtable to things</p>
<p>like TPU, to things like TensorFlow. And all of that</p>
<p>builds up all the things that DeepMind does all the compute we</p>
<p>have to throw against search to support that. So I think they</p>
<p>would probably say, well, people probably don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>great sense of today, that it&rsquo;s not just 25% of the team that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>required. And then the third thing is what they would</p>
<p>probably say is, it&rsquo;s very hard to explain, but Google has all</p>
<p>kinds of other things that they do for free, to create the</p>
<p>ecosystem so that the internet works well. You know, I heard</p>
<p>this one thing where somebody was explaining that Google is</p>
<p>like, you know, the DNS server, right? Google is the time</p>
<p>server, and all of this stuff they do for free. And all of it</p>
<p>is just about making the internet work more efficiently.</p>
<p>And that has some cost. So that&rsquo;s probably how they would</p>
<p>steel man how to build back up to some number. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably there&rsquo;s still a gap between that number, David, and</p>
<p>what the prevailing headcount is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I think that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s totally true. Because the</p>
<p>infrastructure team led by ours is the most remarkable</p>
<p>engineering organization on planet Earth, in my opinion. And</p>
<p>they have laid fiber lines across the Atlantic, they have</p>
<p>built their own data center infrastructure, their own</p>
<p>switches, their own silicon, like everything is built by this</p>
<p>team from the ground up from first principles, and it gives</p>
<p>extraordinary moats and advantages to the business, it</p>
<p>makes the internet a better place, it allows, you know,</p>
<p>ultra fast, super cheap YouTube video viewing across the</p>
<p>internet. I mean, there&rsquo;s just so much of these core advantages</p>
<p>in the business. But if you look at the headcount over time, you</p>
<p>have to ask yourself the question, you know, how many of</p>
<p>these investments that are core, are really, you know, captured</p>
<p>in the headcount that blossomed from 2013 47,000 people so that</p>
<p>the business has gone up in headcount by four x in the last</p>
<p>nine years, one of the things that Jeff Bezos was always so</p>
<p>incredible at, and I saw him give a speech on this at one</p>
<p>point, Bezos gave a speech that I saw and he said, we are really</p>
<p>good at failing. And he showed all these projects that Amazon</p>
<p>tried. And he said, we tried a nine, we tried to do our own</p>
<p>search, we tried to build our own cell phone, the fire phone,</p>
<p>we tried to do this, we tried to do that. When they don&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>we kill them. And when they did work, they became 100 multi</p>
<p>hundred billion dollar enterprise value craters for</p>
<p>them, like AWS, which was one of these projects. And so Amazon</p>
<p>was so good at taking the stuff that wasn&rsquo;t working, knowing</p>
<p>when it wasn&rsquo;t working and ending it. And they were still</p>
<p>able to drive an innovation engine. One of the challenges I</p>
<p>see with alphabet is that they are so good at bringing the best</p>
<p>talent to work on these innovation problems. But where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not good is saying, you know what, this isn&rsquo;t working,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to move on. And if they did just that, if they</p>
<p>added that one disciplinary capability, then I think this,</p>
<p>as you said, the market cap would go up by $600 billion.</p>
<p>What about this? I just want your reaction to this thing that</p>
<p>a lot of people whisper in Silicon Valley, which is part of</p>
<p>what the big companies should do. It&rsquo;s part of the positive</p>
<p>game theory is to not let these talented people actually leave,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to pay them 300,000 or 200,000 or whatever and stay</p>
<p>at Microsoft and meta. And Google or whatnot, then go off</p>
<p>and start up, build a startup that could actually then disrupt</p>
<p>them. And so you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a cost worth bearing, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually mitigating strategy as it&rsquo;s a blocker</p>
<p>strategy. Yeah. But what do you think about that? super</p>
<p>interesting idea. I think that the people that are likely going</p>
<p>to actually be able to execute on that are going to leave and</p>
<p>do it anyway. Right? They&rsquo;re surely aggressive entrepreneurs</p>
<p>are not going to look I was not super I had made a little money</p>
<p>when I worked at Google. But I was not super wealthy. And I</p>
<p>left the last the vast majority of my stock options and RSUs on</p>
<p>the table when I left Google in 2006. Here&rsquo;s our climate core</p>
<p>because I could not help but do that. I could not help myself. I</p>
<p>had to go do that thing. Of course, I think the kinds of</p>
<p>people that are going to succeed in entrepreneurism cannot help</p>
<p>themselves. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money is being thrown</p>
<p>at them. Here&rsquo;s the chart. Basically, these companies have</p>
<p>been correlating their spend, and their headcount to their</p>
<p>revenue, not what&rsquo;s necessary. You look at alphabet total</p>
<p>employee changes 2018 95.36%. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know that looks</p>
<p>pretty good to revenue 132%. It doesn&rsquo;t look like they were</p>
<p>massively overhiring. If you ask me, totally, totally. So what</p>
<p>are you guys talking about? So maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. I will say</p>
<p>look, a big part of Larry pages decision to shift the company</p>
<p>from Google to alphabet was he believed that the core business</p>
<p>at some point would ultimately be disrupted that the core</p>
<p>advertising engine was going to be disrupted. And there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to be the sustaining long term growth advantage in that</p>
<p>business. Maybe he&rsquo;s been disproven, or maybe the it</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been just it hasn&rsquo;t been proven yet. But the concept was</p>
<p>we need to find the next Google, and we need to build the next</p>
<p>Google. And so we want to allocate capital within a</p>
<p>portfolio of bets, and have some number of those things, maybe</p>
<p>not all of them, maybe not even a lot of them, maybe just one or</p>
<p>two of them turn into the next $100 billion revenue line for</p>
<p>us. Now, he always said that that&rsquo;s going to take a long</p>
<p>time, he definitely underestimated the quality of</p>
<p>Google search and the dominance of it. Now, it&rsquo;s probably it</p>
<p>probably stands to reason that if we have enough innovation at</p>
<p>the fundamental model level in AI, particularly like a bunch of</p>
<p>really powerful multimodal models, the new form of search</p>
<p>can disrupt Google. But the problem is, they are so ahead of</p>
<p>everybody else with respect to those models as well. So the</p>
<p>real question is, even that next big leapfrog isn&rsquo;t going to</p>
<p>happen without billions of dollars of capital invested. And</p>
<p>you know, the most likely folks that are able to do it, I think</p>
<p>open AI at some level, but again, they&rsquo;re going to always</p>
<p>have to raise money from other folks. Google can self fund it,</p>
<p>and it makes an enormous amount of sense to drive that</p>
<p>technical moat. So it just seems like Larry, what are we</p>
<p>think is going to happen here? Any? Are they going to make the</p>
<p>cuts or not? You think they&rsquo;ll make to have the ability to not</p>
<p>make cuts and just ignore a 6% shareholder Chamath? Or are</p>
<p>they just going to make them and then we&rsquo;re going to go on to</p>
<p>your dynamic will be how much Ruth is able to convict Ruth</p>
<p>Porat is the CFO. And she&rsquo;s hardcore. She&rsquo;s hardcore. She&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredibly everyone on that leadership team is incredibly</p>
<p>impressive. But she has a very particular lens, a Wall Street</p>
<p>lens, and she understands what the shareholders are thinking</p>
<p>and looking at. And she will convey these points to the</p>
<p>board. And, and there will be engineers and Sundar is an</p>
<p>engineer, and he will, and he&rsquo;s a very good, he&rsquo;s very good at</p>
<p>gathering the different points of view and having balance</p>
<p>around this. And he will share his points of view with the</p>
<p>board. And I think ultimately, it will come down to, my guess</p>
<p>is like we just talked about some portfolio allocation</p>
<p>decisions, which is how much risk and how much beta how much</p>
<p>alpha? And do we have the right mix in our portfolio? And it is</p>
<p>inevitable, there&rsquo;s going to be some cutting. So I think that</p>
<p>there will likely be some reduction.</p>
<p>5% 10% tank 10,000 employees. That seems like the number that</p>
<p>people are going with.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I guess. Okay, sacks. What is your take on austerity measures</p>
<p>and moving to an age of excellence and efficiency, which</p>
<p>is happening inside of the tech industry as we speak?</p>
<p>I think freeberg&rsquo;s right that these companies could operate a</p>
<p>lot more efficiently. I think there&rsquo;s an economic argument</p>
<p>there. But I want to up level it and talk about the cultural</p>
<p>aspect of this for a second. And also bring in two of the huge</p>
<p>stories this week, the, the SPF story, the interviews he did</p>
<p>with the New York Times and Vox, and then this hysteria around</p>
<p>well, you know, what&rsquo;s happening at Twitter. Look, I think that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something clearly has hit a nerve here in this last</p>
<p>week, where you have all of these employees who have</p>
<p>voluntarily left, creating all of this drama. And, you know,</p>
<p>Antonio Garcia Martinez had a good quote about this. He said,</p>
<p>What Elon is doing is a revolt by entrepreneurial capital</p>
<p>against the professional managerial class regime that</p>
<p>otherwise everywhere dominates. And that same PMC, which includes</p>
<p>the media is treating it as an act of last measure state.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another version of this that came out a couple weeks</p>
<p>ago. And by the way, let&rsquo;s mess just a just means like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>insulting the monarch, the</p>
<p>insulting the crown. There was a good one here. There&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>article on compact magazine, a couple weeks ago, where the</p>
<p>editor Jeff Schellenberger tweeted, the layoffs at Twitter</p>
<p>are no different than what&rsquo;s happening across Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>But because the ideological antagonism of the professional</p>
<p>left Musk, they make clear what&rsquo;s at stake, the collapse</p>
<p>of a jobs program for surplus elites. And then. And then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great quote from this article, which again, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so hard hitting. I know. It&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s a deep nerve. I&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>into one differently. Yeah, exactly. So a quote from this</p>
<p>article said, one of the biggest and least talked about social</p>
<p>questions in the West is how to economically provide for our own</p>
<p>modern version of Francis impecunious nobles. That is how</p>
<p>to prop up high status people who can&rsquo;t really do much</p>
<p>economically productive work. Wow. I mean, like, this was</p>
<p>brutal. Yeah. Yeah. So I think this is really hitting a nerve</p>
<p>because the fundamental quid pro quo of our civilization is that</p>
<p>in order to achieve economic and social advancement, you go to</p>
<p>college and get a degree and you submit to voluntary re</p>
<p>education of yourself at one of these woke madrasas, one of</p>
<p>these re education camps, that&rsquo;s a good pro quo. You get some</p>
<p>did your punch up guy write that intro? No, this is this is what</p>
<p>I believe for a while now. There are some number of people who</p>
<p>get useful degrees like computer science or engineering, but huge</p>
<p>numbers of people get degrees in like we talked about the basket</p>
<p>weaving or whatever the politically correct degree is</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re and they graduate with a quarter million dollars</p>
<p>in debt and no marketable skills, right? And right. And</p>
<p>what was propping up all of these people were these</p>
<p>fantastically wealthy monopolies, tech companies that</p>
<p>were hiring huge numbers of these people. Now, all of a</p>
<p>sudden, we get to a point where we&rsquo;re in an economic recession.</p>
<p>And these companies are starting to do layoffs, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to do a little bit more soul searching about who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really adding value. And people are starting to get laid off.</p>
<p>And I think this hysteria is coming from a place of deep</p>
<p>insecurity. You had all these people go to college, they did</p>
<p>not learn critical thinking skills. What they learned was</p>
<p>that, listen, if we pay lip service to the right platitudes,</p>
<p>then we will have career advancement. And now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>learning that that may not be true. And actually, the person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s pulled the mask off this entire regime is not other than</p>
<p>SPF. And he did it in an interview with Vox, and we have</p>
<p>to go to this, okay. He said, Yeah, he&rsquo;s the devil. But he</p>
<p>basically pulled the mask off this whole civilizational</p>
<p>quiproquo that is a sham. Okay. And here&rsquo;s what he said, that</p>
<p>the Vox reporter said you were really good about talking about</p>
<p>ethics for someone who kind of saw it all as a game with</p>
<p>winners and losers. What did SPF said? Yeah, he he, I had to be</p>
<p>is what reputations are made of to some extent. I feel bad for</p>
<p>those who get fucked by it. Basically, all these people who</p>
<p>incurred a quarter million dollars in debt and think they</p>
<p>can just spouse the right platitudes. He says, by this</p>
<p>dumb game, we woke Westerners play where we say all the right</p>
<p>so everyone likes us. How stupid does the New York Times feel</p>
<p>right now? How stupid do all these nonprofits and</p>
<p>foundations who received all this money from SPF, he played</p>
<p>them, all he had to do was say the right words that say the</p>
<p>magic woke words, and they would basically cover for the most</p>
<p>enormous grift that&rsquo;s ever been perpetrated. That is basically</p>
<p>the quiproquo of our civilization is be woke and you</p>
<p>will have indefinite career opportunities, no matter how</p>
<p>virtuous signaling would be another way to say it. I mean,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be the work woke ideology, but</p>
<p>virtue signal and give donations to people. This has been a</p>
<p>playbook of grifters for a long time. Bernie Madoff gave a ton</p>
<p>of, you know, donations, and he used the same donations that he</p>
<p>gives the Republican Party. None. They&rsquo;re not part of the</p>
<p>regime. How many how many conservative? Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>this is a poll. I don&rsquo;t know that this is right. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>making a political point. I&rsquo;m making a cultural point. Okay,</p>
<p>good. Who were the charities that he donated to? It was all</p>
<p>the right what causes not, you know, it was not a demic one was</p>
<p>not woke. He was passionate about the pandemic stuff. Are</p>
<p>you kidding me? freaking out about the pandemic? No, no, he</p>
<p>wanted a pandemic. As he explained it to me, the</p>
<p>neurosis, it was the No, no, that was not what he was funding</p>
<p>sex. I actually talked to him about this when I interviewed</p>
<p>him. He said he wanted to do pandemic prevention and early</p>
<p>warning systems and wanted to invest in strategies to fight</p>
<p>the next. And definitely freaking out about COVID is was</p>
<p>essential neurosis of the professional managerial class</p>
<p>for the last couple of years. It is. But that&rsquo;s not what he was</p>
<p>funding. I just want to make that point. Yeah. Whatever. I</p>
<p>mean, he wanted to prevention. I mean, you can frame it as not</p>
<p>but I actually literally talked to him about it. He wanted to</p>
<p>do pandemic prevention in the future. He wanted to steal</p>
<p>money from California taxpayers via ballot initiative to fund</p>
<p>his brother&rsquo;s organization, which would have dispersed the</p>
<p>money in who knows what ways, probably not legitimate, out of</p>
<p>a professed concern about the next pandemic. Why? Because the</p>
<p>PMC is neurotic about the last pandemic. Come on. This is</p>
<p>to them. I understand. Of course. Yes, thank you. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pandering. It&rsquo;s absolutely pandering. Now listen, why?</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second. Why did this work? Why did this work</p>
<p>virtue signaling work? And again, why were they only</p>
<p>charities and causes that appeal to the sort of the left is</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the ones with the power in our society and in</p>
<p>our culture to define what virtue is. When you&rsquo;re virtue</p>
<p>signaling, who are you signaling to the people with the power to</p>
<p>decide what is virtue? And what is vice, right? That is why</p>
<p>people go to work at the New York Times, that is why they</p>
<p>basically go into, you know, all these influential jobs at</p>
<p>nonprofits and foundations. They&rsquo;re the ones deciding what</p>
<p>virtue is. They&rsquo;re the dupes are the ones who are fooled. And</p>
<p>now what&rsquo;s happening is there&rsquo;s an economic consequence to it,</p>
<p>which is, it is coming out, these people have no marketable</p>
<p>skills, and companies are tightening their belts. And now</p>
<p>all of a sudden, they&rsquo;re starting to become deeply</p>
<p>insecure about their own future.</p>
<p>My comment is that, you know, when you look at Twitter, as an</p>
<p>example, Bill Gurley had a really powerful quote as well,</p>
<p>which is when companies cut, you know, they don&rsquo;t cut nearly</p>
<p>enough, and they and they miss estimate and underestimate how</p>
<p>resilient to company is back in, you know, Twitter had 200</p>
<p>million ma you, they had only 1000 employees. And so clearly,</p>
<p>at that point, they knew what they were doing. And now the</p>
<p>business has, you know, increased in ma you by call it</p>
<p>50% to 300 million. But the employee base increased by seven</p>
<p>and a half x. So clearly, something is misaligned. And I</p>
<p>think the thing that, you know, people are going to find out is</p>
<p>all the way with contractors, probably 12 x, right. So I think</p>
<p>that, well, there you go. So I think that the thing that</p>
<p>frustrates a lot of folks that are leaving or that are trying</p>
<p>to throw bombs is they don&rsquo;t want Elon to be right. Because I</p>
<p>think to David&rsquo;s point, if Elon is successful, he has uncovered</p>
<p>this very uncomfortable truth that was frankly hiding in plain</p>
<p>sight, which is that many of these technology companies using</p>
<p>technology, get so much operational leverage, that they</p>
<p>have some enormous efficiencies. And then it&rsquo;s only a decision</p>
<p>by the professional managerial class to reward themselves with</p>
<p>fiefdoms, and kingdoms of employees. And you know, the</p>
<p>surfs that work for them. I mean, it&rsquo;s really quite crazy if</p>
<p>you think about it.</p>
<p>Well, freeberg made this, you know, early on in the history of</p>
<p>this podcast. Well, hold on, I&rsquo;m going to add to your position.</p>
<p>freeberg said something that adds to your position, which is</p>
<p>early in this podcast, he said the nature of organizations is</p>
<p>they want to grow. And that&rsquo;s government or even these</p>
<p>departments you&rsquo;re talking about. Anybody who runs a</p>
<p>department is never going to say my department needs to be 20%</p>
<p>less. So we can hit the bottom line, they&rsquo;re gonna say give me</p>
<p>20% more because everybody else is getting 20%. Go ahead.</p>
<p>And then if you if you if you layer in the Charlie Munger</p>
<p>quote, show me the incentive, and I&rsquo;ll show you the outcome.</p>
<p>You can understand why because the professional managerial</p>
<p>class is rewarded by compensation that is actually</p>
<p>independent of dilution. Right? Because if you look at these</p>
<p>compensation plans, all of these professional stock owners, they</p>
<p>complain all the time about stock based comp, right. And</p>
<p>these companies have budgets between two and 5% a year that</p>
<p>they give away. And so you have this situation where an</p>
<p>engineer or an engineering manager or a sales manager or a</p>
<p>marketing manager, in success at 1000 people can grow to 5000 or</p>
<p>10,000, their compensation doesn&rsquo;t change in any other</p>
<p>organization, their compensation would change</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s say that it&rsquo;s a percentage of the profits that</p>
<p>are distributed, unless the company is phenomenally growing.</p>
<p>Eventually, you&rsquo;ll see it in the bottom line of what you take</p>
<p>home. And so these folks are incentivized to have these</p>
<p>status signals of value. I have a 50 you know, you guys have</p>
<p>heard this. I have a 50 person team. I oversee 3500 employees</p>
<p>and you and everybody is conditioned to think, oh my god,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible, you must be really important. And so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to sort of now see in real time, a questioning of that</p>
<p>belief system. And if Elon proves to be right, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really important decision point for a lot of other technology</p>
<p>companies, because if you are an 80 to 90% gross margin business</p>
<p>built on software, maybe you have a bigger responsibility</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;ve discovered to date to your shareholders and to the</p>
<p>existing employees to find the efficient rate of return, right?</p>
<p>What is the efficient frontier of headcount? The other thing is,</p>
<p>it now allows let&rsquo;s just say that now Twitter goes to making</p>
<p>up a number 2000 employees after this whole Google Form thing.</p>
<p>The great thing about the 2001st employee for the 2000 employees</p>
<p>and for the shareholders is that that 2001st new employee is 100%</p>
<p>aligned because they&rsquo;re coming into something eyes wide open.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s also an interesting thing that isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>getting enough recognition is he&rsquo;s putting out there what he</p>
<p>stands for this hardcore culture, irrespective of whether</p>
<p>we think it&rsquo;s right or wrong, all the people that stay are</p>
<p>voting that it&rsquo;s right. And you know, as long as it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>breaking any laws, he&rsquo;s allowed to do that. And so if people now</p>
<p>want to join that organization, they should be allowed to do</p>
<p>that too, just like the people who don&rsquo;t want to should be</p>
<p>allowed to leave sacks, you and I came up and we talked about</p>
<p>this, I think on last week&rsquo;s show, or maybe it was two weeks</p>
<p>ago, we talked about what the expectation was in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley at a startup, what startup culture was, in terms of</p>
<p>just the effort that was required to build a winning</p>
<p>company. And we all said 60 hours a week was the baseline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that, you know, has been I think a lot of</p>
<p>people, you mentioned this trim off people working two jobs for</p>
<p>30 hours a week and taking two salaries from two of the fine</p>
<p>companies.</p>
<p>10 episodes, go into tick tock, and search for, you know,</p>
<p>engineering salaries, you&rsquo;ll see some of the craziest tick</p>
<p>tocks, kids are making 350 k, working 30 hours a week, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nuts. Yeah.</p>
<p>And so I think we&rsquo;re gonna have is a I think we&rsquo;re gonna have a</p>
<p>cultural divide here, there are going to be a series of</p>
<p>companies that say this is classic Silicon Valley, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna we&rsquo;re gonna crush it, we&rsquo;re gonna work aggressively,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna put in 50 6070 hours a week, and we&rsquo;re all going to</p>
<p>benefit from that. And then there&rsquo;ll be another class of</p>
<p>companies that says, Hey, no, we want to have a more lifestyle</p>
<p>business. And if people want to work 3040 hours a week, and they</p>
<p>contribute, we don&rsquo;t need to be perfectly efficient. And you</p>
<p>know what, the playing field of the playing field of capitalism</p>
<p>will show who is right sex.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I actually went out of town a few days ago.</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t keeping up with, you know, every detail of what was</p>
<p>happening at Twitter. And I started getting all these text</p>
<p>messages about how Twitter was dead or dying or whatever, like</p>
<p>the site had been unplugged, or what have you. And I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>what is going on? And you know, you tweeted this morning, hey,</p>
<p>is this working? And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, like, like, yes, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working. Like, and this morning, is this working? And so what my</p>
<p>tweet went through? Yeah. So I came to learn what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about is that all Ilan did was give a voluntary offer</p>
<p>that if you didn&rsquo;t want to stay, you could take three months</p>
<p>severance. Now, remember, last week, they had a riff, you know,</p>
<p>which was basically economically required, in which they gave</p>
<p>employees three months severance, which is 50% more</p>
<p>than what he had to it was generous. Now, it seems to me</p>
<p>that what if you&rsquo;re one of the employees in the other half that</p>
<p>made the cut, but yet you&rsquo;re not really motivated to stay. And</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t really want to operate like a startup. I mean,</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s basically saying we&rsquo;re going to go back to working and</p>
<p>operating like a startup. That means that you might have to</p>
<p>work nights and weekends like a startup. What if that&rsquo;s not what</p>
<p>you signed up for? You may be sitting there at Twitter saying,</p>
<p>Oh, man, I wish I gotten riff. Well, now Elon is offering you</p>
<p>the opportunity to take the same package. So I&rsquo;m like, how</p>
<p>can this possibly be a bad thing? It&rsquo;s actually the great</p>
<p>management technique that Tony Shay rest in peace from Zappos</p>
<p>created, he would say when people went through their first</p>
<p>couple of months of training, he&rsquo;d say, Now, if you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>this job, I will pay you a month&rsquo;s salary. This is on their</p>
<p>first day after they went through training their first like</p>
<p>day on the job. He said, Okay, now that you&rsquo;ve gone through the</p>
<p>training, I&rsquo;ll pay you I think it was $5,000 or $3,000 to not</p>
<p>take the job. And something like one out of five people</p>
<p>would do it. And so he said, Listen, I don&rsquo;t have to fire</p>
<p>them later on, this is going to make my management easier. It</p>
<p>was, it&rsquo;s, it is actually a kind thing to do to give people the</p>
<p>opportunity to leave</p>
<p>and how giving employees an option to opt out.</p>
<p>The reason people are upset, let&rsquo;s be honest, sacks, is some</p>
<p>people, you know, live to work, and some people work to live and</p>
<p>the people who are working to live, find it crazy that hustle</p>
<p>culture even exists. And people who are part of hustle culture,</p>
<p>like the four people in this podcast,</p>
<p>find it crazy. It&rsquo;s just working.</p>
<p>hustle culture is working above the hours you&rsquo;re being paid for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s basically what hustle culture. That&rsquo;s how most</p>
<p>people would define it.</p>
<p>A salary is actually not you work for 40 hours, a salary</p>
<p>means you get your job done.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s how we look at it. That is not how other people</p>
<p>look at it. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that Elon is going to raise</p>
<p>if we lose American primacy. It&rsquo;s because of that. Not</p>
<p>because I agree with you. I&rsquo;m just giving the other side. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still made on the other side. People look at their salary. And</p>
<p>they look at themselves as getting compensated for 40 hours</p>
<p>in every hour above that. But do you know, this generation&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>looks as hustle culture. There are people that are not agreeing</p>
<p>with it. There are people that are working 60 7080 hours a week</p>
<p>as a teacher to make 3040 k firefighters, you know, working</p>
<p>on oil rigs and to hear somebody like hustle culture at a</p>
<p>startup where you&rsquo;re making 350 grand and you&rsquo;re upset because</p>
<p>like the matcha lot ran out or whatever. It&rsquo;s just so out of</p>
<p>touch. I&rsquo;m not disagreeing.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, my view on it is that people need to love their</p>
<p>jobs and love what they&rsquo;re working on. Because I think the</p>
<p>only way to be successful is to work hard. But the only way to</p>
<p>work hard and be happy is to really love what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s a lot of people at this company or others who</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really love it, and they are just there to pay the bills</p>
<p>or whatever, then I actually think it&rsquo;s extremely generous</p>
<p>for Elon to be offering them a package, the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how giving them an option was anything but</p>
<p>positive. And yet the media has gone berserk on it. Meanwhile,</p>
<p>while giving SBS a virtual pass on the largest one of the</p>
<p>largest frauds in history and made off level fraud. You read</p>
<p>a legend. No, there&rsquo;s no alleged dude. It&rsquo;s come out. He loaned</p>
<p>himself like this is just one data point. He loaned himself a</p>
<p>billion dollars. And he loaned the head of engineering $500</p>
<p>million off the balance sheet. Nothing to see here. What</p>
<p>possible justification? And you know, an SBF interview reason</p>
<p>to say the word to say the hard part out loud. The reason why</p>
<p>these same publications are not covering this is because they</p>
<p>were complicit in his reputation laundering. Yes, the New York</p>
<p>Times before that article put out this other puff piece where</p>
<p>they talked to him. And they were excoriated on Twitter</p>
<p>because it was like not a single question about the fraud, or</p>
<p>alleged fraud, alleged, alleged fraud, allegedly, obviously,</p>
<p>allegedly slash obviously, billion dollars suddenly goes</p>
<p>missing and no one knows where it is. I&rsquo;m willing just to call</p>
<p>that a fraud. You&rsquo;re willing to jump the fence. They&rsquo;re busy</p>
<p>scrambling to sort of save their own reputations, which is why</p>
<p>they are trying to like, hide the cheese effectively and point</p>
<p>over here and say, Hey, look at what&rsquo;s happening. Elon sent an</p>
<p>email worth only one button. Yes. I mean, let&rsquo;s be</p>
<p>intellectually honest.</p>
<p>I love that meme that Elon tweeted out. Do you see the two</p>
<p>rhinos?</p>
<p>You know, this is all gonna get reblogged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too funny. It&rsquo;s too funny. It&rsquo;s too good. It&rsquo;s too good to</p>
<p>not put up on the screen. I mean, that&rsquo;s that nature</p>
<p>photographer is the New York Times. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay. Yeah, we don&rsquo;t see it. There are two rhinos. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fornicating copier and copier. Yeah, they don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>formulating is like it&rsquo;s to 2000 pound animals. populating doggy</p>
<p>style 10 feet behind a nature. It&rsquo;s your mom. Behind I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to be the world&rsquo;s major photographer, a nature</p>
<p>photographer with a $6,000 tele you know, photo lens that</p>
<p>cameras. But he&rsquo;s 10 feet behind him are the two rhinos. The two</p>
<p>rhinos that says FT x losing over a billion dollars of</p>
<p>client funds. And the the photographer is centers calling</p>
<p>for the FTC to investigate.</p>
<p>The important thing is the photographer is pointing in</p>
<p>completely the wrong direction. You&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>The thing that is obviously right in front of his face,</p>
<p>right that he should be photographing. Yes, he&rsquo;s using</p>
<p>that long telephone. And that is that is the New York Times that</p>
<p>Warren, that&rsquo;s the point. See,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the arrow in the right direction. Yes, point the camera</p>
<p>in the right direction is the point. I just want to point out</p>
<p>my one biology tweet on this in this regard. Oh, God. He&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>capable of one tweet. That&rsquo;s gonna be 76 tweets in a store.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna pluck your eyes. But it&rsquo;s a really good one.</p>
<p>He says, think of a regulator as a binary classifier. What&rsquo;s our</p>
<p>false positive and false negative rate? btf Bitcoin ETF</p>
<p>block for years, FT x ignored for years. The actual filter is</p>
<p>not. Is this a scam? The actual filter is? Is this a scam? Who</p>
<p>spicy? It&rsquo;s not consumer protection. It&rsquo;s reelection.</p>
<p>Young Spielberg make a banger out of that. It is a banger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not consumer protection. It&rsquo;s real. Listen, if you are</p>
<p>part of these interlocking power structures that we call the</p>
<p>regime, it&rsquo;s the New York Times, it&rsquo;s the regulatory state. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a democratic party. You get a big public and hold on, let&rsquo;s be</p>
<p>clear. Your, your team now controls the house. And so</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s team? David? Oh, David&rsquo;s team. David. Yeah, I understand.</p>
<p>But starting in January, you know, there&rsquo;s any amount of</p>
<p>congressional oversight.</p>
<p>No, no, hold on a second. Let me say this right now. The first</p>
<p>investigation by the House of Representatives needs to be SPF</p>
<p>and FTX, not Hunter Biden. SPF makes Hunter Biden look like a</p>
<p>piker. I mean, yeah, you know, Hunter Biden was what a couple</p>
<p>million dollars of grift. This is $10 billion plus a grift. So I</p>
<p>think it also touches regulators, it could touch, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s a big, it&rsquo;s a big failure. It&rsquo;s a party. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>be honest here. I mean, that is the issue. I just think the</p>
<p>quote of the week goes to John Jay Ray. He&rsquo;s FTX his new CEO,</p>
<p>he famously oversaw the liquidation of Enron. And he</p>
<p>says, I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring</p>
<p>experience. I have been the chief restructuring officer and</p>
<p>or chief executive officer in several of the largest corporate</p>
<p>failures in history. I have supervised situations involving</p>
<p>allegations of criminal activity and malfeasance and run. Nearly</p>
<p>every situation in which I have been involved has been</p>
<p>characterized by deficits of some sort in internal controls,</p>
<p>regulatory compliance, human resource and system integrity.</p>
<p>Never in my career. Have I seen such a complete failure of</p>
<p>corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy</p>
<p>financial information as occurred here. This is the</p>
<p>person who oversaw Enron saying this is unprecedented. Enron was</p>
<p>the previous unprecedented situation, which is now being</p>
<p>framed as manageable by none other than john j. Ray, what a</p>
<p>great name. Congratulations on being the chief restructuring</p>
<p>officer of FTX. There was an article that showed Nick, if you</p>
<p>could please throw the picture up on the screen of, of all the</p>
<p>people that invested the universe of SPF. And oh my god,</p>
<p>what and they and the article headline was it&rsquo;s a who&rsquo;s who of</p>
<p>VC and my comment is actually no, this list is a who&rsquo;s who of</p>
<p>people who did no diligence. Yeah. So ever. And I just want to</p>
<p>call one person, Nick, if you look at the Alameda research,</p>
<p>this, this firm called one inch, J Cal invested in a firm named</p>
<p>after the length of his penis.</p>
<p>Maybe coming out of the cold plunge. Okay, but you&rsquo;re that</p>
<p>cold plunge this shrinkage. You know, this shrinkage was that an</p>
<p>listen, I&rsquo;m a show or not. I&rsquo;m a grower, not a shower. All right,</p>
<p>listen, you guys coming out. Everybody knows coming out of</p>
<p>the cold plunge. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not going to be the best performance</p>
<p>for any of us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lost the script on the show. Please, we got a wrap. I</p>
<p>mean, it&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>Do you guys not think that all these investors receive audited</p>
<p>financials? And no, you know, they got they had a lawyer, a</p>
<p>legal firm that represented these financials.</p>
<p>Did you guys see who FTX is auditing firm was it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>Frager Metis. And that says it&rsquo;s based in the metaverse. This is</p>
<p>like the Hollywood upstairs Medical College of the auditing</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Their address is in decentral and Bernie Madoff. I think his</p>
<p>brother in law ran the accounting firm that did their</p>
<p>audits, right? It was like, and it was on a dead floor in the</p>
<p>lipstick building. It was in the same building, right?</p>
<p>On the lipstick building to have like a secret floor with nobody</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, even in that case, people relied on an audit from a</p>
<p>CPA that said here are the numbers. And those numbers were</p>
<p>fraudulently conveyed. And I think that there&rsquo;s probably some</p>
<p>you know, some forgiveness necessary here that there was</p>
<p>maybe there may have been serious fraud that took place.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to be too disparaging of all the people</p>
<p>that we bring on this that work at these investment firms made</p>
<p>an investment and they all got duped and the LPs got duped. And</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think this is just fundamentally like a failure of</p>
<p>diligence. So we we we were part of the process where they tried</p>
<p>to show I have to be careful. My lawyers reminded me that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still under NDA actually with FTX. So but what I can tell you</p>
<p>is we did not get any financials. So we were verbally</p>
<p>going on when you ask for it when you</p>
<p>we sent a two pager of stuff. Anyways, I can&rsquo;t say more than</p>
<p>that. But yeah, don&rsquo;t get yourself in trouble. Oh, I want</p>
<p>to I want to say something else, by the way. Last Friday. David</p>
<p>and I were at Yuri Milner&rsquo;s birthday party. And there was a</p>
<p>chess tournament. And Magnus Carlsen was there. And anyways,</p>
<p>David was in the finals. Okay, it was David and his partner</p>
<p>look at the smile on David versus versus Matt. Hold on.</p>
<p>Wait, I&rsquo;m getting to a great punch line versus Magnus</p>
<p>Carlsen and his partner. David won. Wow. My partner was was</p>
<p>should I say Yuri&rsquo;s daughter who I think is probably what like</p>
<p>10 years old. She&rsquo;s incredible. Yeah, she&rsquo;s like second in</p>
<p>America. Yeah, she&rsquo;s good. She&rsquo;s good. She&rsquo;s incredible. Anyway,</p>
<p>yeah, thank you to Yuri. That was a really unique partner</p>
<p>chess. My partner was Prajna Nanda, who&rsquo;s an Indian</p>
<p>grandmaster who&rsquo;s like a superstar. Yeah. And look</p>
<p>playing, you know, with Magnus Carlsen was obviously that was a</p>
<p>real thrill. Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>So when you rank this with the birth of your children, your</p>
<p>marriage, and this, where would that rank on the scale of one</p>
<p>through five? This is for your poor kids. But you know what,</p>
<p>speaking of the pause, Zach is happy. Oh my god, I haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>him that happy since Trump won. Guys, look at look at that</p>
<p>document I just sent you before we can wrap this up. But I want</p>
<p>to show you this. Basically, I pulled all IPOs since 2020. So</p>
<p>this excludes all SPAC mergers, and real estate finance material</p>
<p>energy utilities are kind of the big bulky private equity type</p>
<p>stuff. So it&rsquo;s mostly tech consumer 627 IPO since 2020.</p>
<p>More than half of them are basically half of them are</p>
<p>trading at less at point two times the total cash they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>burned. So they&rsquo;re, you know, you can kind of look at total</p>
<p>lifetime capital burned by these companies in the retained</p>
<p>earnings line on the balance sheet. And so when you pull out</p>
<p>the retained earnings, it shows you right how much money they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>burnt over their lifetime. And so the total money burnt by half</p>
<p>of these companies is about $107 billion. And the market cap of</p>
<p>those companies is only $26 billion in aggregate. So a point</p>
<p>two times return on capital invested to date in terms of</p>
<p>enterprise value, divided by total capital invested in. Let</p>
<p>me say let me say it in English. And you tell me if I said it</p>
<p>right. So 627, non SPAC, non real estate, non finance</p>
<p>companies went public. So basically 627 startups companies</p>
<p>went public since 2020. So two years. Yep. And of those 627</p>
<p>tech companies, almost half or 300 of them 48% of them are</p>
<p>today worth about point two times all the money that went</p>
<p>into them. Yep. My gosh, wow. Yep. And then on the other half,</p>
<p>the other half is, is the ones that have worked. So this kind</p>
<p>of goes back to a power law point. But like as a venture</p>
<p>industry, you think once you get a company public, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>successful. And the reality is that many of these companies</p>
<p>from a from an economic perspective, are still not</p>
<p>successful. It looks like half and perhaps much more if you</p>
<p>include all the SPAC mergers, which is another couple 100. And</p>
<p>I would guess the vast majority of those meet this criteria are</p>
<p>trading at less than the total cash that&rsquo;s been invested in</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>freeberg. This speaks to the age of excess that we just went</p>
<p>through. We just weren&rsquo;t as efficient as we needed to be in</p>
<p>running these companies. And now we&rsquo;re in the age of efficiency,</p>
<p>austerity, excellence. But it&rsquo;s this great setup for a rebound,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it freeberg? Like, I don&rsquo;t know these</p>
<p>look, I mean, one way to read this, I was speaking with</p>
<p>someone who I you can bleep him out. I was talking with two</p>
<p>weeks ago, three weeks ago, and he showed me in there. How much</p>
<p>should I say here, this is a big investment firm, and they have a</p>
<p>big growth portfolio, less than they have about 160 investments,</p>
<p>180 investments in their growth portfolio. 85% of the returns</p>
<p>are generated by 10 companies of the 180. And that&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>growth portfolio. These are supposedly de risk businesses</p>
<p>power exists, even in our law exists in growth. And as you can</p>
<p>see here, the power law exists quite dramatically post IPO, as</p>
<p>well. So you know, as you can see here, only 9% of these</p>
<p>businesses have generated positive earnings over time. 43%</p>
<p>about half of them are worth more than the total cash that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been invested in them. And that multiple production board study</p>
<p>here, by the way, this is your done by your family. Yeah, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all public data. So the, the multiple on the value of the</p>
<p>companies that are worth more than their cash invested is 5.5</p>
<p>times. So in aggregate, IPO since 2020, are worth 4.3 times</p>
<p>the total cash that&rsquo;s been invested in them over their</p>
<p>lifetime. But the crazy statistic is half of them are</p>
<p>worth significantly less than the cash that&rsquo;s been invested in</p>
<p>them only point two times. So the power law dominates both</p>
<p>early growth and clearly being public. But I think to your</p>
<p>point, Jake, how it also seriously speaks to the amount</p>
<p>of excess and it&rsquo;s really going to rationalize probably based on</p>
<p>the conversations we had today about Twitter, meta, Google,</p>
<p>Amazon, Amazon, and this as well. So certainly, also the</p>
<p>good news here is freeberg and correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here,</p>
<p>Jamal, we want more companies to go public and have that</p>
<p>discipline of being a public company. This was the big</p>
<p>critique of this quiet era of companies taking 1012 14 years</p>
<p>to go public. This is going to be a strength for these</p>
<p>entrepreneurs to have to fight it out in the public market</p>
<p>under scrutiny. Correct?</p>
<p>100% I think like the Chris home letter, I think that there are a</p>
<p>lot of VCs on boards of companies who would love to say</p>
<p>the equivalent thing to their private private company. And</p>
<p>part of the the dynamics as as freebird just said, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a power law and people believe that, you know, you</p>
<p>being with other VCs are really important. It turns out that</p>
<p>most of these VCs abandoned their role on these boards and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really hold people accountable because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worried it will affect their deal flow. So the problem is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a negative reflexive loop. It&rsquo;s but so these companies do</p>
<p>poorly. And then as a result, they&rsquo;re viewed as not an</p>
<p>effective board member. And so the next deal they get is a poor</p>
<p>and poor quality. So the highly correlated portfolios in</p>
<p>Silicon Valley are the ones that will get torched because most of</p>
<p>those companies will receive very poor or no advice. And then</p>
<p>the few that will get to the end is because they have hard nosed</p>
<p>people on the board that will force them to make really hard</p>
<p>decisions. Yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>sacks. Any thoughts here on the public markets?</p>
<p>Oh, sorry. Wait, last thing. And by the way, Sequoia, who has had</p>
<p>exceptional returns has always been known to be hard nosed. You</p>
<p>know, a lot of people that critique against Sequoia from</p>
<p>founders, which would be that, oh, if I take Sequoia&rsquo;s money,</p>
<p>they may fire me. Well, yeah, because if you&rsquo;re not good,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the mission of the business is bigger than your ability to</p>
<p>be the CEO. And so, you know, you just have to remember, like,</p>
<p>there is no free lunch, we were not giving out free money here.</p>
<p>For you pendulum swung one direction too far. They used to</p>
<p>the tradition Silicon Valley used to be you always replace</p>
<p>the CEOs, the founders, the founders with a professional CEO</p>
<p>and Google being the turning point there, or maybe the last</p>
<p>one. And then it became founders will control their companies</p>
<p>with super voting shares forever. Hopefully, the pendulum</p>
<p>now swings to some equilibrium sex. What are you seeing in</p>
<p>private markets? The program for surplus elites is going away.</p>
<p>managerial classes under pressure. Yes, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>If you went woke, you may go broke because you have no</p>
<p>marketable skills.</p>
<p>Man, you&rsquo;re a bunch of</p>
<p>somebody in the room with a bunch of guy Dean&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s got somebody</p>
<p>myself up.</p>
<p>Who Jackie the joke like Jackie the joke man Marling handing you</p>
<p>little notes.</p>
<p>All right for the Sultan of science, David Friedberg and also</p>
<p>the executive producer of all in summit 2023. And the rain man</p>
<p>himself, chess master and champion, David Sachs, as well as</p>
<p>the dictator, I&rsquo;m going to go on a little road trip. Aren&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>dictator a little road trip for the dictator and Jake out? Yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be fun. I am the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator who</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t control the panel today. I&rsquo;ll do better next week.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see you next time.</p>
<p>In podcast. Happy Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man David</p>
<p>we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>Love you.</p>
<p>What your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like sexual</p>
<p>tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be</p>
<p>waiting to get</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going</p>
