<p>Ôªøall right welcome welcome to the webinar
we&rsquo;re going to talk about midsection</p>
<p>weight and cortisol so the first thing I
want to cover is that the weight in your</p>
<p>midsection is very very different than
other types of fat around your body so</p>
<p>what you were dealing with is it&rsquo;s a
type of hormonal fat and it&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>from a hormone called cortisol there is
another hormone involved it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>insulin but we&rsquo;re going to talk about
that on the fourth seminar so this</p>
<p>seminar is all about cortisol and the
effects that it creates on your body I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to be using this reference book
CIPA encyclopedia of endocrinology by</p>
<p>Frank knitter and we&rsquo;re going to give
you a lot of data it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>interesting subject especially if you
want to get rid of your belly fat so</p>
<p>without further ado let&rsquo;s get started
I&rsquo;m going to turn on my screen saver to</p>
<p>show you see we could yeah okay good so
you can pretty much see that alright so</p>
<p>what I want to talk about is some what
is this cortisol thing okay the purpose</p>
<p>of cortisol is to adapt adapt the body
to stress for survival purposes so the</p>
<p>purpose of the body is to survive but
your adrenals tend to change the</p>
<p>different functions to handle the
environmental stress okay that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what it does and if you&rsquo;re being chased
by a tiger you can imagine you got pulse</p>
<p>rate blood pressure blood to your
muscles you have oxygen opening up in</p>
<p>your lungs you have your your mental
acuity is very very aware of everything</p>
<p>you have more blood flow to the heart
all these things are stressed States so</p>
<p>that would be one of the purposes
cortisol but I know a lot of people want</p>
<p>to get rid of their course all because
it&rsquo;s creating the belly fat</p>
<p>but really you need this thing for
survival of mechanisms so we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>it to be too low and we don&rsquo;t want it to
be too high because there&rsquo;s just as many</p>
<p>problems with low cholesterol as there
are high cholesterol okay and if you</p>
<p>have people that have symptoms of high
cholesterol and low cholesterol mixed</p>
<p>you know you try to do research on that
and you won&rsquo;t really find too much data</p>
<p>and I have my theories because you have
these people that present with like for</p>
<p>example belly fat but they&rsquo;re showing
symptoms of a low cortisol not a high</p>
<p>cortisol why is that like they might
have allergies or a high blood pressure</p>
<p>where they might have inflammation or
itching or acid reflux well I think</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really happening is that cortisol
is too high in the beginning and then it</p>
<p>tries to connect to a receptor like an
indifferent like all these hormones</p>
<p>connect to different body parts and they
cut they plug into these little tiny</p>
<p>receptors kind of like a like
information goes into your ear well if</p>
<p>that cortisol that stress hormone is too
high it will cause the receptor to adapt</p>
<p>and downgrade very similar to insulin
being resistant because there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>insulin and your body just adapts and it
just won&rsquo;t it blocks the insulin so so I</p>
<p>think you have this thing called
cortisol resistance it&rsquo;s the only thing</p>
<p>that makes sense so when you have a
situation when you have high levels of</p>
<p>stress over a period of time sustained
stress all these receptors downgrade and</p>
<p>now we have symptoms of high cortisol
and symptoms of low cortisol not a good</p>
<p>situation so the course all is produced
from a gland on top of your kidney</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two of them and they&rsquo;re little
tiny glands that sit on top of the</p>
<p>kidney right in the central part of your
body and these glands take a beating</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re rugged they basically are going
to send messages through the body to</p>
<p>handle the amount of stress so it keeps
the body alive now the interesting thing</p>
<p>about the adrenal is that it has two
arts and inside and outside the outside</p>
<p>is just all gland tissue and that&rsquo;s
where cortisol is made but the inside of</p>
<p>the gland is all nerve tissue is it
weird isn&rsquo;t it so it&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>nervous system that&rsquo;s called the
autonomic nervous system it&rsquo;s just a new</p>
<p>word the orb you know it&rsquo;s kind of like
the system that works on automatic you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think about it we call autonomic
you can call automatic but it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system and and that&rsquo;s
the part of the nervous system inside</p>
<p>the adrenal that makes neurotransmitters
now what is the neurotransmitter it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a hormone that travels through the
nervous system so here we have hormones</p>
<p>that travel through the blood and
they&rsquo;re just communication particles</p>
<p>that travel through the blood but then
you have communications that travel</p>
<p>through the nervous system so you have
two ways that the adrenal can</p>
<p>communicate through the nerves in the
blood so it really innervates every</p>
<p>single part of your body there is a
device that can measure the autonomic</p>
<p>nervous system and you can get clues on
what&rsquo;s going on to the inside of the</p>
<p>adrenal and I have that device and I&rsquo;m
going to talk about it in a second but I</p>
<p>want to explain this autonomic nervous
system thing okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really simple its purpose is to
help balance the inside of the body all</p>
<p>the different functions and keep it on
regulated properly so it adapts to the</p>
<p>environment to keep the inside of the
body at a Curt a certain constant state</p>
<p>they call that homeostasis where your
body is trying to balance itself out so</p>
<p>you have like all these things that
speed up and turn on and then you have</p>
<p>all these parts of the body that can
turn off and one part of the system of</p>
<p>the autonomic nervous system is called
the sympathetic division that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all the flight-or-fight that would be
like if you&rsquo;re being chased by a tiger</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting stressed all those
reactions</p>
<p>come out of this autonomic nervous
system like its electrical circuits that</p>
<p>come out of your if you look at the
words locate it&rsquo;s located in your middle</p>
<p>back of the spinal column so that&rsquo;s
where all those wires come out and cause</p>
<p>different reactions that turn on but
look it over here we have the opposite</p>
<p>division the off switch we call that
call that the parasympathetic division</p>
<p>and that turns things off and look where
that comes out of that comes out of the</p>
<p>top of the neck we&rsquo;re going to come back
to this so just remember the on switches</p>
<p>are on the mid-back and off switches in
the top of the neck okay but there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>less thing and I know it&rsquo;s hard to see
this so there there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>connection of this on switch to the
adrenal gland right here but if we look</p>
<p>over here on the off switches there is
no connection to the adrenal with the</p>
<p>off switch so the adrenal doesn&rsquo;t have
an off switch which explains a lot it</p>
<p>this explains why people can&rsquo;t turn off
so you have people that are under</p>
<p>sustained stress for many years and they
get maybe they retire and they where</p>
<p>they go on vacation or they go to bed at
night and they try to go to sleep and</p>
<p>their body will not shut off so the
accumulation of stress builds up and it</p>
<p>can get stuck in the body and it can
cause you to be on 24/7 especially with</p>
<p>your head it&rsquo;s just going going going
going going it can&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re not thinking</p>
<p>solving problems so the nature of the
adrenal is survival so what that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to do is put you in a survival mode
where you&rsquo;re always solving problems</p>
<p>your attention is on bringing problems
up solving them constantly and when it</p>
<p>gets even it gets to the extreme where
you find that your body gets stuck in</p>
<p>that you you lose your tolerance for
stress so things start to get to you</p>
<p>especially anything that&rsquo;s the opposite
of survival</p>
<p>like the opposite of lot being logical
competent same order so you&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>low tolerance to any incompetency out of
order situation slope you just won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the patience and that&rsquo;s one of the
symptoms that of adrenal overload</p>
<p>because the person can feel subjectively
that they&rsquo;re very highly critical and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not their personality that&rsquo;s just
the adrenals affecting their personality</p>
<p>I mean how many relationships are
affected by having the adrenal overload</p>
<p>where the person just is just like back
and forth back and forth no patients I</p>
<p>mean it can get so bad you&rsquo;re in a room
and the clock is ticking and you just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t stand that I mean it&rsquo;s like they
have to go to sleep with up with the TV</p>
<p>white noise to kind of filter out stuff
but they&rsquo;re multitaskers they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking all the time and so that&rsquo;s one
of the problems with the adrenal is that</p>
<p>it can create a cognitive effect that is
very undesirable</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s um let&rsquo;s go back to the
slides I&rsquo;m going to show you this right</p>
<p>here all right so so does that make
sense we have the autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system we have the part of the autonomic
nervous system that turns things on it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called sympathetic and then you have the
other part that don&rsquo;t they call that</p>
<p>rest and digest that&rsquo;s called the
parasympathetic set and it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>parasympathetic connection to that
adrenal so there is no off switch</p>
<p>fascinating okay so let&rsquo;s talk about can
the adrenal glands or let&rsquo;s just say</p>
<p>this can we measure a part of the
adrenal gland generally speaking to see</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on yes you can there&rsquo;s a
technology out there called heart rate</p>
<p>variability and I don&rsquo;t want to get into
the technological aspects of this but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a fancy test that
measures the that part of the nervous</p>
<p>system and
two things one is stress states and it</p>
<p>measures a cumulative stress and it also
measures recovery or that that turn off</p>
<p>switch so it measures the on switch in
the off switch</p>
<p>okay now the on switch or the
flight-or-fight is this long I&rsquo;ll right</p>
<p>here it should be normally straight up
and down plumb not to stress not to</p>
<p>burnt down and then the off switch or
the recovery mechanism should always be</p>
<p>twice as high because you need a buffer
if you are being chased by a tiger in</p>
<p>the wilderness you need some reserve to
get away you can&rsquo;t just be right on the</p>
<p>edge because there also you would stand
up and pass out so you need a good nice</p>
<p>robust recovery mechanism to handle
stress now let&rsquo;s show you something when</p>
<p>you have this tall now let&rsquo;s say the
tall that is too high remember it should</p>
<p>be straight up and down this person is
pretty jacked up on inside of their body</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re revved up um they&rsquo;re
stressed out but look at this person</p>
<p>might not feel too bad because their
recovery dial is so high that&rsquo;s the all</p>
<p>the brake pads so they&rsquo;re all gas pedal
but they have good brakes to handle it</p>
<p>so this person is an abstain of they&rsquo;re
not burnt out but they&rsquo;re burning out so</p>
<p>just a matter of time before it burns
out okay so they&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>problem sleeping and excessive thinking
that type of thing now if we get down</p>
<p>over here we have that not too bad with
the tall dial okay so there may be a</p>
<p>little bit of flair to fight but look at
this recovery it&rsquo;s way way down here so</p>
<p>this person is really not doing good
because recovery is necessary for</p>
<p>metabolism for sleep for handling stress
and for the heart to handle exercise so</p>
<p>this person should not be exercising any
high intensity because they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>feel dizzy they might have
stress on the heart I take them a long</p>
<p>time to recover and there&rsquo;s this
recovery is an active recovery so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to prevent them from getting into
the deep sleep they&rsquo;re going to be very</p>
<p>not very tolerant to stress so I just
wanted to kind of show you what these</p>
<p>two mean because you can kind of
visualize not just subjectively feeling</p>
<p>stress but you can see the stress
accumulated stress so both of these</p>
<p>people here if you go into their history
I always ask two vital questions that</p>
<p>you should always focus on if you have
any problems you want to solve your</p>
<p>problem is find out like when did you
start having this problem when did you</p>
<p>start gaining weight in this section
what happened just before that there</p>
<p>will always always be something that
triggered it and you know sometimes you</p>
<p>ask the doctor and they&rsquo;ll go oh no you
know I know you started having</p>
<p>projectile vomiting when I gave you
those medications but that couldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>it I mean it&rsquo;s the only obvious thing
you took the medication you vomited okay</p>
<p>so this is like the obvious thing what
happened right before it and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get clues as to your adrenal
stress your belly fat um I mean I had</p>
<p>one lady um and she has these itching in
her body almost like a yeast infection</p>
<p>and I said when did you get that she
told me it was like a I think was like</p>
<p>three weeks ago I said what did you do
just before that and she just she</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t think of anything and so I just
told her I just started asking her said</p>
<p>well did you have antibiotics she goes
no I said did you take any nutritional</p>
<p>yeast she goes oh my gosh yes I did
I said ding-ding-ding so because</p>
<p>sometimes when you get the wrong type of
nutritional yeast which is a supplement</p>
<p>for people it can create some yeast
issues if you take too much okay so</p>
<p>anyway that&rsquo;s just an example of of you
know finding out what caused</p>
<p>something is okay so now the next thing
we talk about is stress stress is a</p>
<p>little bit different for a lot of people
um but typically people get stressed out</p>
<p>from physical stress injury surgery a
change of environment change of diet um</p>
<p>being in a bad marriage being in a
better having a bad job but out of all</p>
<p>the stresses that I that I observe
people go through I think the biggest</p>
<p>thing that I see is stress with other
people once you agree so we can pretty</p>
<p>much just take people and put them in
two boxes number one the people that</p>
<p>bring you up and number two the people
that bring you down okay um the people</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re around and they stress you
out and you&rsquo;re connected to them you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to either improve the
situation or not be around them because</p>
<p>all day long I&rsquo;m constantly trying to
help people change their environment and</p>
<p>it just boils down to being in this this
situation where they&rsquo;re around this</p>
<p>person who is it could even be a family
member but what&rsquo;s happening is that this</p>
<p>family member is being so destructive
that&rsquo;s killing this person but they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to not be around because
they&rsquo;re family and blah blah blah so I</p>
<p>want to just explain one personality
type that I think you could identify</p>
<p>with it&rsquo;s called the passive-aggressive
this is the person that told you they</p>
<p>stood up for you but they actually
ruined your reputation</p>
<p>they they will say to you like a nice
comment like hey I like your hair was it</p>
<p>did you get it at cheap cuts you know
your haircut a cheap</p>
<p>really I would never say that or that&rsquo;s
a nice jacket was that on sale like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a little bit of a kind of a
destructive comment so they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>degrading but they&rsquo;re doing it in a nice
way and they&rsquo;ll smile at you as they say</p>
<p>are you feeling okay you look a little
bit tired I had this person say to me</p>
<p>once some hey congratulations you
graduated from Chiropractic College hey</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you want to become a real
doctor so that&rsquo;s just interesting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just something that you probably
wouldn&rsquo;t say but it&rsquo;s a very destructive</p>
<p>I was in a seminar one day and had all
these people said in here and this lady</p>
<p>raises her hand and she just smiles at
me and she says dr. Berg um we love you</p>
<p>but how do we know that you&rsquo;re not a
real quack I&rsquo;m like what that is so rude</p>
<p>um first of all how do we like who&rsquo;s we
we as you everyone wants to be there so</p>
<p>sometimes people are very very um
destructive</p>
<p>covertly and those are the people that
you need to avoid like the plague they</p>
<p>will mess with your adrenals guaranteed
okay now I talked a little bit about</p>
<p>tolerance for stress but as the Drina
glands get weaker and weaker you lose</p>
<p>your patience you lose your tolerance
you fly off the handle easily you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tolerate slow people on the freeway you
don&rsquo;t tolerate um incompetent people</p>
<p>that make mistakes you walk in a room
you&rsquo;ll find that thing that&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>quite right your your attention goes on
it Moore&rsquo;s because your body at your</p>
<p>mind is fixated on problems 24/7 so even
if you had a wonderful day your</p>
<p>attention will go to that one thing that
wasn&rsquo;t quite right so it&rsquo;s hard to be</p>
<p>happy because your attention is just so
stuck in these issues so that&rsquo;s just an</p>
<p>example of
an adrenal issue and if we measure that</p>
<p>on that graph that dial the low dial
would be all the way to the left okay so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of effects of cortisol
that I want to talk about because I mean</p>
<p>this virtually blows my mind how many
issues can occur from the adrenal so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to read from you this in this book
called Sivir this encyclopedia on</p>
<p>endocrine system medical illustrations
by Frank knitters and MD this is enough</p>
<p>pretty much all the medical schools um
but check it can cause belly fat</p>
<p>diabetes muscle atrophy in fact let me
just show you a page page 84 right in</p>
<p>this book and I&rsquo;m just gonna I have my
book it&rsquo;s hard to read this but I will</p>
<p>send you the slides um but here&rsquo;s the
thing you have a problem with high</p>
<p>cholesterol the adrenals are very
destructive on protein so it&rsquo;ll break</p>
<p>down your muscle protein your collagen
and it will turn that into fat you can</p>
<p>pretty much see it on this graph you see
this lady with these skinny legs in the</p>
<p>big belly
well the adrenals will start taking you</p>
<p>proteins from the thigh muscle and
converting them into sugar and then fat</p>
<p>into the belly because the body is in
the state where it thinks is starving</p>
<p>regardless of the all-you-can-eat buffet
down the street it just thinks it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>starting and then after it depletes this
little go after the butt muscles and</p>
<p>turn that into belly it&rsquo;s very
destructive so proteins collagen joints</p>
<p>fall apart high cholesterol cholesterol
will go high because cholesterol is</p>
<p>needed to build adrenal hormones low
vitamin D levels Wow</p>
<p>immune system the white blood cell which
protects you against infections are all</p>
<p>controlled by the adrenal that&rsquo;s why
they give adrenal hormones in the form</p>
<p>of cortisone or hydrocortisone or
steroids or prednisone</p>
<p>for pretty much all really bad
infections so if you look at what</p>
<p>conditions someone would take prednisone
or a steroid or cortisol 4 you can get</p>
<p>an idea of the function of cortisol it&rsquo;s
an anti-inflammatory they give it to</p>
<p>allergies heart conditions coronary
problems immune problems and the big one</p>
<p>autoimmune problems we&rsquo;ll get into that
in a little bit but on this page in the</p>
<p>bottom it talks about viruses coming out
of remission with it with high levels of</p>
<p>cortisol I mean it&rsquo;s it just blows my
mind how many issues that people have</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really they&rsquo;re treating all
these separately they&rsquo;re not going after</p>
<p>the root issue
yeah allergies asthma inflammation</p>
<p>arthritis bursitis tendinitis excessive
brain activity acid reflux</p>
<p>diabetes hypoglycemia other than that it
won&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t affect anything I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>being sarcastic poor wound healing
Buffalo Hump in the background face red</p>
<p>cheeks it&rsquo;s rosacea moonface belly fat
high blood pressure insomnia sleep apnea</p>
<p>oh my gosh it goes on and on and on okay
so those are all the symptoms of the</p>
<p>adrenal craving for salt chocolate and
even sugar so the adrenal gland has a</p>
<p>lot of effects and a lot of people have
a few of the effects but not all of them</p>
<p>because it starts off small and it might
gradually get more and more more so when</p>
<p>you go to the doctor they rarely check
for cortisol and the problem is that if</p>
<p>you get one test that measures your
cortisol it doesn&rsquo;t really do you any</p>
<p>good because cortisol works on a
circadian wave through the day and night</p>
<p>you really to measure this correctly you
would have to measure it every four</p>
<p>hours throughout a 24-hour cycle to get
a better impression and I believe that</p>
<p>saliva is one of the good
is to do that but here&rsquo;s the thing when</p>
<p>they even if you test positive you would
have to have the majority of these</p>
<p>symptoms before someone does something
about it like the doctor and they only</p>
<p>use a drug on a compassionate basis so
really they don&rsquo;t have a solution okay</p>
<p>so now that&rsquo;s in this book right here
but there&rsquo;s some other things that I</p>
<p>want to show you because there&rsquo;s also a
condition called it&rsquo;s a low adrenal I</p>
<p>showed you all the symptoms for hygiene
or a member you could be a mix but check</p>
<p>this out
this person loses weight they get</p>
<p>atrophy they shrink and they get tanned
Dewayne you get tanked okay you might</p>
<p>like that right but it&rsquo;s a very
unhealthy state and you probably hear</p>
<p>people that go through stress and lose
weight that&rsquo;s not healthy but this</p>
<p>person has vertigo
that&rsquo;s an adrenal Michael Jackson mine</p>
<p>losing the pigment their immune system
is completely destroyed and they have a</p>
<p>lot of inflammation John F Kennedy had
this condition called Addison&rsquo;s which is</p>
<p>load renal and have to be injected by
with adrenal hormones so a lot of</p>
<p>autoimmune issues so the adrenals can
also affect bruising and male pattern</p>
<p>baldness facial hair I mean acne I mean
think about how many people have these</p>
<p>conditions and so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s huge so we
have this one gland that affects so many</p>
<p>issues and it&rsquo;s basically triggered by
stress so stress is a huge culprit in</p>
<p>destroying our lives in our health and
especially with weight loss a lot of</p>
<p>people on a diet and exercise well you
can get some changes with diet and</p>
<p>exercise but there&rsquo;s some other things
that you need to know about to help your</p>
<p>belly fat that go beyond diet and
exercise that very few people are</p>
<p>talking about we&rsquo;ll get into that</p>
<p>all right so I covered the effects of
cortisol okay stress accumulates</p>
<p>pregnancy hysterectomy tonsillectomy
infections see when you were a kid you</p>
<p>may had your tonsils out
you had respiratory infections you had</p>
<p>sore throats and now you&rsquo;re an adult and
you might think well that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an issue that was in the past
all that stuff does affect your adrenals</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you have this accumulative
number of applications on your desktop</p>
<p>computer like right here all these
applications on your desktop can slow</p>
<p>down the computer it&rsquo;s the exact same
thing with the adrenal it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>accumulation of stress and a physical
mental emotional the people that I talk</p>
<p>to that have never really experienced
that much stress they always can lose</p>
<p>weight easily and they don&rsquo;t have a lot
of health problems it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>connection so personally I&rsquo;ve had
probably more injuries and infections</p>
<p>then any patient that ever came my
office my whole life I had sore throats</p>
<p>council issues lung issues digestive
issues sleep issues arthritis</p>
<p>inflammation mg chronic fatigue issues
I&rsquo;ve had fractures of my leg my arm my</p>
<p>elbow I&rsquo;ve had Falls on the head
whiplashes motorcycle accidents</p>
<p>wrestling injuries and fractures
fractured my neck several times so all</p>
<p>that stress accumulates and that&rsquo;s what
drove me to figuring out some of this</p>
<p>stuff because I personally had a lot of
these problems</p>
<p>okay so visceral fat visceral fat is a
different type of fat it&rsquo;s the fat</p>
<p>around the organs
it&rsquo;s the fat around the liver it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>superficial and it can be measured and
that&rsquo;s coming from cortisol</p>
<p>so so the question is how do you lower
cortisol you don&rsquo;t want to necessarily</p>
<p>you want to balance cortisol by lowering
the the impression that it left on the</p>
<p>body
cortisol well let me just get into that</p>
<p>in a second I wanted to touch on this
next slide here first and then I&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>into what to do about it I don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;re
talking about autoimmune conditions a</p>
<p>lot of people have them lupus rheumatoid
MS you name it there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>autoimmune conditions and there&rsquo;s a lot
of theories out there and what causes</p>
<p>them well I&rsquo;m going to tell you right
now my theory on this is that I think</p>
<p>that autoimmune diseases are related to
the adrenal and the reason I say that is</p>
<p>because you can take any autoimmune case
100% of them and ask them when did it</p>
<p>start and what happened just before that
and there is always some stress event</p>
<p>that occurred right before the
autoimmune condition whether a loss of a</p>
<p>loved one which by the way losses will
affect the adrenal a thousand times more</p>
<p>deadly than physical trauma divorce loss
of a loved one multiple losses I mean</p>
<p>the problem is everyone is around people
that eventually they&rsquo;re going to lose</p>
<p>all these people so eventually they&rsquo;re
going to have adrenal issues it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>matter of time I&rsquo;ve been very lucky my
family very few people have died one</p>
<p>person very close to me my grandmother
but that&rsquo;s about it</p>
<p>but the point is that autoimmune cases
always have this huge stress usually a</p>
<p>loss right before it so that means that
the adrenal gland is involved okay so</p>
<p>what I want to show you next is there&rsquo;s
some data that I&rsquo;m going to share with</p>
<p>you and this data is has to do with
another interesting finding with</p>
<p>autoimmune cases okay this is
research is but been done on this guy by</p>
<p>the name of Marshall called the Marshall
protocol and here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>simplicity of it he found that or not he
does he just observe this and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>connecting the dots he found that the
vitamin D is heavily influenced with</p>
<p>auto immune and immunity so in other
words vitamin D is intimately connected</p>
<p>with your immune system and he found
that the vitamin D receptor is inside</p>
<p>the cell and the difference between
vitamin D and other vitamins is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fat Seibel vitamin that in can go inside
the cell more than a water-soluble</p>
<p>vitamin so it goes deep down into the
DNA of a cell and what&rsquo;s fascinating is</p>
<p>that he found that the receptor for
vitamin D called vitamin D receptor vdr</p>
<p>gets blocked and then you can&rsquo;t absorb
vitamin D anymore</p>
<p>okay and then the person has this
Associated finding with autoimmune and</p>
<p>this is what he does he gives someone
the vitamin D receptor VD are analog</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another word I want to explain
what it means I&rsquo;ll define it an analog</p>
<p>is something that kind of mimics
something so it acts like something so a</p>
<p>vdr analog would be something that could
help open up the receptor so it can it</p>
<p>can help mimic and open up the receptor
okay so what he found is that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>medication called benicar which is high
blood pressure medication that is a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a some type of remedy that helps
reverse the receptor problem that the</p>
<p>block receptor okay allowing vitamin D
to go in there and helping the</p>
<p>autoimmune system and I don&rsquo;t agree with
this because it&rsquo;s a drug and he also</p>
<p>uses heavy duty antibiotics for a long
creative time I think for like a year</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not from my viewpoint it&rsquo;s not a
good solution but what&rsquo;s interesting is</p>
<p>the vitamin D does get blocked so now
let&rsquo;s take that into this book right</p>
<p>here Frank neder page 84 right here
cortisol counters vitamin D levels it</p>
<p>blocks vitamin D I don&rsquo;t know if you can
see that so in other words the question</p>
<p>is why does vitamin D get blocked in the
first place</p>
<p>Marshall talks that it&rsquo;s a microbe that
does it and that&rsquo;s totally could be true</p>
<p>but what about the adrenal because it&rsquo;s
a stress the adrenal is the thing that</p>
<p>triggers the whole event because it&rsquo;s a
stress event now if you do a search on</p>
<p>the vitamin D receptor analogues and I
know I&rsquo;m giving you some words here so</p>
<p>just hang in hang tight there is another
thing that I think is very natural that</p>
<p>can act to help open up this vitamin D
receptor and I stumbled on it and you</p>
<p>can use bile salts yeah from the gall
bladder purify bile salt do help open up</p>
<p>that vitamin D so you can absorb more
vitamin D at the receptor level which is</p>
<p>fascinating because that&rsquo;s where they
need to be doing research not been a car</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s is too many side effects
and also my bio helps you break down the</p>
<p>fat side of a vitamin vitamin D helping
you your immune system so I just found</p>
<p>that kind of an interesting connection
and I want to bring that up if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anyone listening to pass autoimmune you
should research using bile in your diet</p>
<p>and vitamin D together to see if that
can help you on in addition to also</p>
<p>looking at what you can do to improve
the adrenal functional role I just want</p>
<p>to make make a disclaimer here that I&rsquo;m
not claiming to cure any adrenal</p>
<p>diseases okay I&rsquo;m not here to do that
all I&rsquo;m here to do is give you the</p>
<p>information so you can do research
and you can know where to focus on and</p>
<p>get with your doctor to help yourself
okay so that&rsquo;s my disclaimer all right</p>
<p>so check this out you guys heard a
roundup roundup ready monsanto GMO right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a herbicide that they use on GMO to
be able to it&rsquo;s because GMO is like they</p>
<p>made it resistant to Roundup Ready and
herbicide so it&rsquo;s genetically modified</p>
<p>food well I just found in this
toxicology reports that there&rsquo;s Roundup</p>
<p>Ready creates a major problem to the
adrenal gland yeah interesting it</p>
<p>disrupts the endocrine system of the
adrenal gland in male rats of course I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know it could affect humans too
what do you think but I just want to</p>
<p>bring it up because in this stuff came
out in 1996 which is date coincidence to</p>
<p>a lot of people getting sick shortly
after that so I&rsquo;m curious this could be</p>
<p>a huge connection to a lot of adrenal
issues from people consuming genetically</p>
<p>modified food without even knowing it
and that would be in all the soy and the</p>
<p>corn but also in the animal products
that eat the soy in the corn which is</p>
<p>huge it&rsquo;s all over the place okay so now
I&rsquo;m going to talk about some tips to</p>
<p>reduce stress alright
because what we want to do is we want to</p>
<p>you know not take on just a pill to
lower core so we want to look at the</p>
<p>whole body we want to find out what to
eat of course we want to find some way</p>
<p>to deal with this issue and so there&rsquo;s a
couple things that you can do overall</p>
<p>because yes we want to correct the
problem but we also want to correct your</p>
<p>environment and so it doesn&rsquo;t keep going
on um so there are techniques that you</p>
<p>can extract stress from the body I&rsquo;ll
cover a few even injuries but what</p>
<p>happens with the adrenal is that it
creates a lot of situations</p>
<p>in your head a lot you&rsquo;re thinking
you&rsquo;re analyzing I mean who you are at</p>
<p>work in front of a computer right now
you&rsquo;re watching a computer and then you</p>
<p>go to bed but there&rsquo;s not a lot of space
going on so with stress what stress does</p>
<p>is it kind of it&rsquo;s it collapses your
space and that&rsquo;s why when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stressed you might even say I need some
space because you don&rsquo;t have space so</p>
<p>one of the remedies for stress is to get
space so hiding in space go outside go</p>
<p>hiking go in a park get lots of space go
to the beach all this is very</p>
<p>therapeutic you might say it&rsquo;s the salt
water you might say it&rsquo;s the Sun it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the space that you need and so going to
a gym behind a treadmill looking at the</p>
<p>computer screen is very hurt bad um I&rsquo;m
not against meditation but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting there meditating focusing on
something and maybe your meditation is</p>
<p>something different but that&rsquo;s how I
some people that do it totally but and</p>
<p>it works for them but the point is that
if you were to extrovert your body and</p>
<p>not necessarily focus on any thing but
just observe things in your environment</p>
<p>you know temperature site sounds without
analyzing everything that would be very</p>
<p>therapeutic if you did it every single
day because all day long you&rsquo;re solving</p>
<p>problems with your work we have to
reverse that and extrovert your body or</p>
<p>your stress okay so that&rsquo;s one thing
with space another thing let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to the screen share here more sleep now
some people have a problem sleeping I</p>
<p>had a problem sleeping really bad and so
one of the common remedies for helping</p>
<p>with the adrenal and stress is to get
more sleep so now let&rsquo;s talk about sleep</p>
<p>how do you fix sleep first of all sleep
there&rsquo;s several different causes to</p>
<p>sleep problems you can have
flashes for example you can have</p>
<p>problems with stress that you&rsquo;re
thinking and you can&rsquo;t wind down easily</p>
<p>your night out you have a problem where
you sleep for two hours and wake up at</p>
<p>2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and you&rsquo;re
laying there bright awake yet during the</p>
<p>day at 2:00 or 3:00 you&rsquo;re completely
exhausted okay because your circadian</p>
<p>waves your rhythms are off so what I
like to do is I like to make sure the</p>
<p>eating is right so there&rsquo;s nothing
interfering</p>
<p>I also recommend doing various
treatments either</p>
<p>go to a doctor that I trained come to my
office or if you&rsquo;re not avail to do it</p>
<p>to do a version of do yourself version
of this technique which is the neck you</p>
<p>pressure technique and I&rsquo;m going to show
you a couple techniques I I do</p>
<p>acupressure on myself every night before
to sleep my practitioners work on me as</p>
<p>well of course all the injuries that add
right but there&rsquo;s a tool that I want to</p>
<p>show you a lot of you watching this have
this tool already</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an acupressure tool it has three
widths so it&rsquo;s good for different body</p>
<p>shapes but I use the widest one we work
right back here so now what I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>show you sleep that will really blow
your way okay let me see if I could find</p>
<p>the immature okay what I want to show
you is that remember when we showed you</p>
<p>at the beginning of the webinar the
sympathetics the on switch and then the</p>
<p>parasympathetic off switch
and the off switch basically is in the</p>
<p>brainstem up here in the top of the
nerves in the top of the neck right here</p>
<p>well the name of that nerve is called
the vagus nerve okay that&rsquo;s the name of</p>
<p>it and it comes from the Latin word
which means wandering because it travels</p>
<p>all the way up to you&rsquo;re up to your neck
down to your your organs let me just</p>
<p>quickly just go back over that because I
this</p>
<p>important I want to show you something
yeah right here you see this nerve</p>
<p>coming out it goes all the way to the
face the lungs the heart the stomach the</p>
<p>pancreas deliver the intestines goes all
into these organs right here right so</p>
<p>check this out</p>
<p>where am i hair okay so there is a
there&rsquo;s a treatment nowadays it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>that actually it stimulates the vagus
nerve and it&rsquo;s called the vagus nerve</p>
<p>stimulation and I just wanna let you
know I disagree with this treatment and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why because it&rsquo;s sending
impulses into this nerve and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of side effects if you if you use
this technique there&rsquo;s a much easier way</p>
<p>to stimulate the nerve without having to
send electricity some shockwave through</p>
<p>your nervous system but look at the FDA
even approved it for for um depression</p>
<p>and epilepsy but it&rsquo;s also used for
anxiety and stress and Alzheimer&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>migraines in fibromyalgia even obesity
why would it be used for obesity because</p>
<p>the vagus nerve is the turn off switch
it relaxes the body increases recovery</p>
<p>and it helps lower court to solve okay
tinnitus with ringing the ears look at</p>
<p>this atrial fibrillation autism bulimia
chronic heart failure hiccups coronary</p>
<p>heart disease why would it be used for
all these things because it can it can</p>
<p>organs it&rsquo;s like you have this circuit
that connects you organs so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using electrical stimulation to this but
here&rsquo;s what I use let me show you what</p>
<p>you can do and I didn&rsquo;t think a lot of
people realize what this is doing when</p>
<p>you do this technique they built entire
chiropractic techniques around adjusting</p>
<p>the first cervical vertebra in your neck
okay called a hole-in-one the Atlas y</p>
<p>because it creates such effects on the
rest of the body with relaxation so the</p>
<p>technique I develop I use my hands and I
get in there so but a lot of times if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to place where there&rsquo;s no one
to work on me that sucks so I built this</p>
<p>after my hand
I mean modeled after my hand it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>exact width of my hand but look at how
big my thumb&rsquo;s are right I have huge</p>
<p>thumbs and that&rsquo;s why I made this really
thick so what I do is you put this in</p>
<p>the back of your couch or a tall back
chair and you kick back your feet and</p>
<p>you just lean back and you let this
thing connect right underneath your</p>
<p>skull and you let gravity pull you back
and you can push your head back and</p>
<p>relax guarantee if you did that for two
minutes you&rsquo;d be probably ready for bed</p>
<p>why because it stimulates the vagus
nerve naturally it relaxes all the neck</p>
<p>muscles it helps the nervous system
which is the off switch this is turning</p>
<p>on the off switch which will then turn
off the cortisol because it will affect</p>
<p>that flight or fight mechanism so so yes
there are techniques out there to turn</p>
<p>off the on switch but this is like
triggering the off switch okay so we do</p>
<p>both we work on both now the other
technique I can&rsquo;t really do it here</p>
<p>because I do it in my bed
then I should create a video on that but</p>
<p>you use this on your back that middle
back part like from your upper back down</p>
<p>to the lower part you can use this
because you would use this part right</p>
<p>here to hit all the way down your spine
one and you just let gravity you lay</p>
<p>back on your bed and you work on that
that&rsquo;s what I do every single night and</p>
<p>I go to sleep right after that um my
wife&rsquo;s like are you always going to be</p>
<p>using that thing why don&rsquo;t you massage
my back right but I have to do my back</p>
<p>first right so that is something that a
lot of you already have but if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have it I highly recommend you get one
um okay so now let me go back to my</p>
<p>slides here
okay so so I just wanted to show you</p>
<p>that there is a vagus nerve stimulation
thing I don&rsquo;t agree with it but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing now but there&rsquo;s all
these different techniques that you can</p>
<p>do you can work on the adrenal glands
you can work on the mid-back you can</p>
<p>work on the tissues in the front these
are all the points that I use to extract</p>
<p>stress from the body okay
and what am i doing is I&rsquo;m using this to</p>
<p>put myself in the Delta wave sleep so
acupressure is a really good way to help</p>
<p>someone sleep to get better sleep to get
deeper sleep and turn the body off so</p>
<p>when you go to bed every part of your
body can finally turn off okay so we</p>
<p>talked about space we talked about sleep
let&rsquo;s talk about being too serious</p>
<p>okay there&rsquo;s a word I want to teach you
it&rsquo;s a French word which means</p>
<p>institutions this means carefree non
serious untroubled unworried okay let me</p>
<p>just so I can talk to you about this the
adrenal case is put you in a state where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re solving problems 24 days you get
really really serious anytime you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really serious you increase stress on
your body a good way to reduce that</p>
<p>would be to be very institution but I
would write that on some paper to put on</p>
<p>your refrigerator and be very carefree
about things go through the day and just</p>
<p>be light joking but not degrading but
just very very playful that viewpoint</p>
<p>and attitude is the best viewpoint to
reduce stress the people that have the</p>
<p>hardest time with losing weight are the
most serious people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like calling their calories and
they&rsquo;re stressed out and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>weighing herself I had one lady comes in
and she&rsquo;s freaking out cuz she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>losing weight and she&rsquo;s trying
everything nothing&rsquo;s working and I can</p>
<p>see she&rsquo;s very serious about everything
so I said this is this is what I want</p>
<p>you to do I want you to promise me for
one week when I start I explained the</p>
<p>definition of the solution see carefree
I want you to do this for one freaking</p>
<p>week okay I want you to stop being so
damn serious I want you to stop weighing</p>
<p>yourself I want you to have fun I want
you not to care about your weight just</p>
<p>do the duck eating plan do the things I
say and don&rsquo;t worry about it 24/7 why</p>
<p>because all that worry is triggering the
adrenals adrenals think way too much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in their head and all that just
stirs up the Drina</p>
<p>24/7 so again we have to extract the
stress we have to have the attitude of</p>
<p>being in solution and carefree do
something getting involved in some games</p>
<p>games is a very great way to be in
solution to play folk don&rsquo;t watch the</p>
<p>news before bed watch money okay
something like that</p>
<p>so in soutien is a playful caring none I
mean carefree way to go about life then</p>
<p>the people that I know that are the most
successful are the most institution okay</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s number three okay now we&rsquo;re
going to talk about potassium there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another interesting little point here
all right so I&rsquo;ve got my little book</p>
<p>right here page 84 as you know I this is
like a hobby for me</p>
<p>I love endocrinology that&rsquo;s all I study
24/7 weekend&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m into it my wife&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like aren&rsquo;t you interest in any other
books like no she was one glad you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>interested in because I don&rsquo;t think
anyone else is but there is one thing on</p>
<p>this page that talks about potassium
deficiencies so with adrenal you lose</p>
<p>potassium not to mention you probably
don&rsquo;t get enough from your diet because</p>
<p>if you watch it in my videos you you
require 4700 milligrams of potassium</p>
<p>every single day
4700 one banana is 300 you need 12 bananas</p>
<p>or 11 bananas so here&rsquo;s the point that
I&rsquo;m trying to make potassium is a</p>
<p>physiological tranquilizer it&rsquo;s a
calming thing of the nervous system</p>
<p>without potassium your nervous system
can&rsquo;t calm down and chill out it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing that lowers the pulse rate and
even blood pressure if you&rsquo;re deficient</p>
<p>in potassium your pulse rate goes up try
to sleep with your pulse rate in the 90s</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work so it will help calm you
down</p>
<p>so what food is high in potassium
vegetables so there we can work back to</p>
<p>the big salad you need a lot of
potassium to calm those adrenals down so</p>
<p>you need huge salads twice a day lunch
and dinner</p>
<p>no fail just stick it in there sea
vegetables don&rsquo;t just have potassium</p>
<p>they have the vitamin C complex that you
need see most of the vitamin C in your</p>
<p>body is stored in the adrenals and most
vitamin C that people buy is synthetic</p>
<p>so you in ascorbic acid in high dosages
will create a vitamin C deficiency</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s synthetic and it depletes
you of the good parts of the vitamin C</p>
<p>complex so what you need to get is a
food based vitamin C or just the food</p>
<p>itself if you eat that much vegetable
like maybe huge to huge salads a day or</p>
<p>plates the vegetable before you have the
protein you will have all the vitamin C</p>
<p>that you need another thing that vitamin
C deficiency is will she will show up is</p>
<p>pink bleeding gums loss of collagen so
we talked about in the seminar a</p>
<p>nutrient absorption we talked about
having an acid stomach to digest</p>
<p>collagen but now you need vitamin C to
build collagen so that&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>vegetable family okay so we need a
potassium and we need the vitamin C um</p>
<p>potassium is in abaca dose so one
avocado is 800 so I have like probably</p>
<p>half an avocado every other day but I do
a lot of salads I go to the farmers</p>
<p>market I get my lettuce and I always cut
red cabbage and I stick a little kale in</p>
<p>there
I like the dinosaur kale and I will do</p>
<p>that every single day if I don&rsquo;t do that
I find my sleep is not as good as it</p>
<p>should be okay now when you eat a lot of
protein that stimulates your body but</p>
<p>you need the vegetables to counter the
body counter that that revved up protein</p>
<p>action all right
so now the next thing we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>talk about is b1 okay so b1 vitamin b1
is the magical vitamin for stress but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple of things you need to
know about it number one the more stress</p>
<p>that you go through the more be one that
you burn up b1 is necessary for your</p>
<p>nervous system if you&rsquo;re very deficient
in vitamin b1 you will have a condition</p>
<p>called berry berry and I&rsquo;m just typing
this up right now so you can so I can</p>
<p>just show you the actual name of this of
this condition that affects the psyche</p>
<p>we see yeah look at this when you&rsquo;re
when you&rsquo;re deficient berry berry you</p>
<p>get this condition we have neurological
and psychiatric symptoms yeah depression</p>
<p>severe anxiety doom and gloom Wow
yeah so if you ever want to see all the</p>
<p>symptoms you can look up berry berry but
um you can look at that up later but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing be one most the time is
made synthetically so you have to find a</p>
<p>natural b1 now it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s very
expensive to make I like to get my b1 in</p>
<p>nutritional yeast the problem is most
nutritional yeast is made synthetically</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s enriched synthetically with b1 so
you need to get an enriched yeast that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not has this enriched with synthetics
and there is one product that I do have</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the adrenal de formula okay and I
have in here a natural b1 but I also</p>
<p>have the entire vitamin C complex that
the adrenal needs and all the minerals</p>
<p>that the adrenal needs and several
herbal things with the adrenal needs but</p>
<p>this is interesting because when you
take this within I would say about five</p>
<p>minutes maybe less you&rsquo;re going to feel
like just the stress this kind of goes</p>
<p>right away this is a great thing to take
if you have that nervous tension</p>
<p>build-up that you&rsquo;re going to explode if
you have people around you that have</p>
<p>that just look one of those in their
coffee and they&rsquo;ll just be so nice to</p>
<p>you so the people that are hyper
critical the people that are have low</p>
<p>tolerance to stress take three of these
take nine of these a day but I think</p>
<p>three would be fine sprout to the day of
it taken as needed and you&rsquo;ll feel it</p>
<p>change because it affects the nervous
system it pulls stress out you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird it&rsquo;s like sometimes when I when I
don&rsquo;t take it for like a week I&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>like a little buildup of stress and then
I&rsquo;ll just take it because I I run my</p>
<p>body and I do all sorts of exercise
stressful things and so I&rsquo;m burn up b1</p>
<p>all the time but b1 naturally comes from
wheat grain but not the type of grain</p>
<p>that you get from the grocery store if
you were to grind your grain and eat the</p>
<p>grain right away
it might be a problem for your weight</p>
<p>but it has all the big complexes be one
so I don&rsquo;t need grains so I need to get</p>
<p>my grains from something so the adrenal
de formula is the stress formula for the</p>
<p>adrenal it has the b1 in there it has
all to be complex and it comes from the</p>
<p>type of nutritional use that&rsquo;s
unfortified and it doesn&rsquo;t have the the</p>
<p>yeast effect that will cause a yeast
infection so it&rsquo;s a really good stress</p>
<p>relieving product that helps with stress
and energy and focus and also nightmares</p>
<p>when your deficient and B one you get
nightmares and heavy vivid dreaming</p>
<p>so that would be indication that you
need that as well okay so b1 is very</p>
<p>very necessary for any type of stress
events or stress symptoms or any</p>
<p>psychiatric problem and they should be
giving b1 um you know they label people</p>
<p>with a DD and attention deficits order
and schizophrenia and bipolar it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a lot of its b1 deficiency and
adrenal stress that&rsquo;s what it is okay um</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s the one that I use for sleep
and I use this I developed this formula</p>
<p>for myself I take one before bed
sometimes I&rsquo;ll take two rarely but you</p>
<p>just need one before bed adrenal my
formula</p>
<p>this formula has been changed many many
times and I perfected it to the point</p>
<p>where you get the optimum wonderful
sleep where you just turn off go to</p>
<p>sleep for seven hours when you wake up
feel refreshed you don&rsquo;t feel groggy but</p>
<p>it really helps people sleep it&rsquo;s a very
popular thing so I take one of these and</p>
<p>I take three of these through the day
it&rsquo;s a great combination if you want to</p>
<p>find something that helps you naturally
sleep but this is not treating cortisol</p>
<p>this is supporting a healthy dream and
it helps you sleep - the whole night so</p>
<p>you can rejuvenate so this the effects
that you get from the sleep help</p>
<p>rejuvenate cortisol
but this helps you sleep okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the combination that I would recommend
all right so now let me go back to this</p>
<p>for a second</p>
<p>alright so there&rsquo;s a book that comes
with this massage tool that shows you</p>
<p>all of the different techniques that you
can use but also if you even go to this</p>
<p>my website dr. Berg calm for / massage -
tool - manual you can watch the videos</p>
<p>on how to do the technique you need the
device but at least you could see that</p>
<p>the technique and you can probably do a
few of them to help yourself tonight</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going to sleep for today
okay so here are some different things</p>
<p>we talked about the turn off switch the
vagus nerve now we&rsquo;re going to talk</p>
<p>about your eating plan now in previous
seminars I&rsquo;ve talked about ketosis um</p>
<p>ketosis is your body&rsquo;s burning fat but
the problem is if you&rsquo;re an adrenal type</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some problems with ketosis
because the problem with the adrenal is</p>
<p>that adrenal puts your body in the state
of making new sugar it&rsquo;ll basically</p>
<p>convert your protein to your sugar the
name of that is called gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>which is basically sugar new making of
making new sugar that&rsquo;s what it means so</p>
<p>with doing an eating plan with the
adrenal you have to make sure you have</p>
<p>enough protein if your body is breaking
down protein if you go on a low protein</p>
<p>diet or a vegetarian diet with adrenal
your body will have a tendency to eat up</p>
<p>your own proteins and that&rsquo;s where you
see collagen loss you&rsquo;ll see your legs</p>
<p>get thinner your muscles get weaker so
we always need to make sure that we have</p>
<p>at least some protein with each
okay the next thing that the adrenal</p>
<p>case needs is or what doesn&rsquo;t need is
they need zero sugars they cannot do</p>
<p>sugar why because your body&rsquo;s already
making too much sugar as it is and so we</p>
<p>got to put them in a state where there&rsquo;s
no sugar we&rsquo;ve talked about that in the</p>
<p>ketosis webinar it&rsquo;s X zero sugar a good
amount of protein and plenty and plenty</p>
<p>of high potassium food that&rsquo;s the
vegetables okay now here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to talk about in the
problem with ketosis of the meal plan is</p>
<p>this
you know ketosis allows you to have a</p>
<p>lot of fat the problem if you&rsquo;re an
adrenal tight and your metabolism is</p>
<p>slow is that when you check the urine
you may be in fat burning no doubt but</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re burning is not the
fat in your body it&rsquo;s the fat that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating it&rsquo;s the dietary fat that
is what we don&rsquo;t want to be burning</p>
<p>necessarily in high quantities because
we want to strength your body so with</p>
<p>adrenal cases they can do a modified
ketosis diet but they have to increase a</p>
<p>lot more vegetables with potassium keep
the sugars down but the amount of fat</p>
<p>that they can eat is somewhere between
moderate and low okay not extremely low</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t get away with high
amounts of you know fatty things because</p>
<p>they just need to be able to burn their
own fat and so that is the twist on that</p>
<p>ketosis diet so I like to start out with
a little more fat and then slowly</p>
<p>decrease it until you&rsquo;re burning your
own fat and you will know that when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the scale if you do the key to
ptosis diet and you&rsquo;re purely in ketosis</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not losing any weight do we
know you&rsquo;re just burning the fat that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating you might not be gaining
weight but we want you to lose weight</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s just a clarification on
the adrenal eating plan now the other</p>
<p>point I want to make on is the Paleo
diet paleo that&rsquo;s really good but for</p>
<p>adrenal cases
I found that you can&rsquo;t do the fruit and</p>
<p>the berry and it&rsquo;s a little bit
restrictive but listen you may have 20</p>
<p>or 30 pounds to lose in your belly or
ten pounds of fat or maybe five pounds</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different type of fat it&rsquo;s not
going to come off with traditional</p>
<p>balanced diets and I&rsquo;m going to say
something that kind of goes against my</p>
<p>philosophy and I think it doesn&rsquo;t really
go against it but it might a little bit</p>
<p>you know I talk about good healthy lose
weight not lose weight to get healthy on</p>
<p>some of the adrenal cases you can&rsquo;t have
a so-called healthy diet where it can be</p>
<p>healthy but it&rsquo;s the traditionally
thought of as healthy see people think</p>
<p>of healthy diets is oh you can do fruits
and berries and whole grains none in a</p>
<p>row the type of eating plan that you
need for the adrenal would be some fat</p>
<p>just a little bit lower okay
not low fat between moderate and low you</p>
<p>need high potassium foods you need a
moderate amount of protein not too much</p>
<p>and you want to make sure you have zero
sugars that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the diet that will</p>
<p>help you but you&rsquo;re going to have to
also pull out this stress now I have a</p>
<p>chart here and I&rsquo;m going to you look at
the bottom of this video you&rsquo;ll see a</p>
<p>link for these slides you can kind of
study this and you can have all these</p>
<p>lines but here&rsquo;s the diet that I
recommend for the adrenal now this is</p>
<p>the kale shake I change the recipe for
the kale shake I&rsquo;m no longer</p>
<p>recommending berries if you&rsquo;re in dream
but if you have a high metabolism or or</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have a male body and
you&rsquo;re 30 years old you could probably</p>
<p>do fruit you can do paleo you can do
higher fat you will still lose weight</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not talking about those people
I&rsquo;m talking about the menopausal woman</p>
<p>that is struggling they need to be a
little bit stripped on this so I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to explain what you should be eating
the kale is just a way to get the cow on</p>
<p>your body
we used to recommend putting a</p>
<p>combination of a handful of kale and
berries in water now I&rsquo;m recommending</p>
<p>put the kale on there put the stevia
berry flavored liquid stevia ok it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>taste like berries it&rsquo;s kind of sweet
and you can drink it down to shake if</p>
<p>you want to get if you want to drink
your um your salad ok for breakfast it</p>
<p>you must have a protein breakfast a
protein and some fat whether it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little steak some eggs a little cheese
avocado chunks maybe a burger patty</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an avocado and an egg these are
all really good breakfast foods and if</p>
<p>you consume the protein for breakfast it
will stabilize your blood sugars in the</p>
<p>evening one of the triggers for cortisol
is a low blood sugar hypoglycemia</p>
<p>so just by if you skip breakfast or you
eat the wrong thing for breakfast you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to trigger Cora salt in the
evening so I&rsquo;m showing you what you</p>
<p>should do to keep the cortisol level in
check for lunch we do the big salad we</p>
<p>do a little bit of protein fish shrimp
seafood chicken don&rsquo;t worry about taking</p>
<p>the skin off we&rsquo;re not worried about low
fat okay for dinner</p>
<p>do the same thing do some vegetable dish
with some protein if you&rsquo;re not hungry</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat because within 48 hours - -
one week - possibly a little long it in</p>
<p>one week if you do this then you&rsquo;re
limiting the sugars your body will start</p>
<p>to convert its enzymes its machinery for
burning fat so it takes a while to get</p>
<p>into fat burning ok but it will burn fat
and you won&rsquo;t be as hungry and you won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>crave as much ok now is a little snack
in the evening you could do a little</p>
<p>hummus with cucumbers or celery a little
cheese a little bit of nuts don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>crazy with the nuts
I think people eat way too many nuts and</p>
<p>too much peanut butter as a snack
because it does have a little bit of</p>
<p>carb
and then we got the celery with the</p>
<p>peanutbutter little cheese and this is a
keto bomb I have these recipes on my</p>
<p>website but those are some things that
you can do to keep it really really</p>
<p>simple a couple points with the keto
bombs they&rsquo;re really delicious they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very filling they&rsquo;re very fattening only
take them as needed so don&rsquo;t try to eat</p>
<p>the whole thing and that&rsquo;s why you want
to make them in small batches so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have them sitting around but there
they don&rsquo;t have any sugar so but if you</p>
<p>do this you won&rsquo;t crave sugar your sugar
cravings will go away very fast okay so</p>
<p>that is what you&rsquo;re going to be eating</p>
<p>okay so we have the adrenal night
formula in the day formula on my</p>
<p>webinars I always give people a discount
if they want to get the kit so either</p>
<p>adrenal kit and I&rsquo;m going to show you

<p>right here okay so this is the adrenal

<p>formula pulls the stress out this is the
Drina night formula take one before bed</p>
<p>take three during the day some people
need six at least and it comes with the</p>
<p>massage tool a book how to use this in
