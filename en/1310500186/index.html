    <p>The following is a conversation with John Donoher,</p>
<p>widely acknowledged as one of the greatest coaches</p>
<p>and minds in the martial arts world,</p>
<p>having coached many champions in jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>submission grappling, and MMA,</p>
<p>including Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonin, Nick Rodriguez,</p>
<p>Craig Jones, Nicky Ryan, Chris Weidman,</p>
<p>and George St. Pierre.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Onnit, SimpliSafe, Indeed, and Linode.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that John</p>
<p>is a scholar of not just jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>but judo, wrestling, Muay Thai, boxing, MMA,</p>
<p>and outside of that, topics of history, psychology,</p>
<p>philosophy, and even artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>as you will hear in this conversation.</p>
<p>After this chat, I started to entertain the possibility</p>
<p>of returning back to competition as a black belt,</p>
<p>maybe even training with John and his team</p>
<p>for a few weeks leading up to the competition.</p>
<p>For a recreational practitioner such as myself,</p>
<p>the value of training and competing in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>is that it is one of the best ways to get humbled.</p>
<p>To me, keeping the ego in check is essential</p>
<p>for a productive and happy life.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with John Donoher.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an easy question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no warmup?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p>No warmup.</p>
<p>No jumping jacks?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break that down into two questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a human being, and like any human being,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m biologically programmed to be terrified of death.</p>
<p>Every physical element in our bodies</p>
<p>is designed to keep us away from death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no different from anyone else in that regard.</p>
<p>If you throw me from the top of the Empire State Building,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna scream all the way down to the concrete.</p>
<p>If you wave a loaded firearm in my face,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna flinch away in horror</p>
<p>the same way anyone else would.</p>
<p>So in that first sense of, are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>My body is terrified of injury leading to death</p>
<p>the same way any other human being would.</p>
<p>So when death is imminent, there&rsquo;s a terror that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I go through the same adrenaline dumps</p>
<p>that you would go through.</p>
<p>But on the other hand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also asking a much deeper question,</p>
<p>which is presumably, are you afraid of nonexistence?</p>
<p>What comes after your physical death?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the more interesting question.</p>
<p>No, I should start by saying from the start,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a materialist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that we have an immortal soul.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a life after our physical death.</p>
<p>In this sense, from someone who starts</p>
<p>from that point of view,</p>
<p>you have to understand that everyone has two deaths.</p>
<p>We always talk about our death as though there was only one,</p>
<p>but we all have two deaths.</p>
<p>There was a time before you were born when you were dead.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t afraid of that period of nonexistence.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even think about it.</p>
<p>So why would you be afraid of your second period</p>
<p>of nonexistence?</p>
<p>You came from nonexistence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go back into it.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t afraid of the first.</p>
<p>Why are you somehow afraid of the second?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to me</p>
<p>as to why people would be afraid of nonexistence.</p>
<p>You dealt with it fine the first time.</p>
<p>Deal with it the second time.</p>
<p>But your mind didn&rsquo;t exist for the first death.</p>
<p>And it won&rsquo;t exist after you die either.</p>
<p>But it does exist now enough to comprehend</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this thing that you know nothing about</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming, which is nonexistence.</p>
<p>Actually, you do know about it,</p>
<p>because you know what it was like before you were born.</p>
<p>It was just nothing.</p>
<p>Every time you go to sleep at night,</p>
<p>you get a sneak preview of death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this kind of nothing happens.</p>
<p>You wake up in the morning, you&rsquo;re alive again.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not about the sleeping.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the falling asleep.</p>
<p>And every night when you fall asleep,</p>
<p>you assume you&rsquo;re going to wake up.</p>
<p>Here you know you&rsquo;re not waking up.</p>
<p>And the knowledge of that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a whole step from that</p>
<p>to the idea of fearing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fully aware that there&rsquo;s gonna be a time</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wake up.</p>
<p>But are you gonna be afraid of it?</p>
<p>Is there some mortal terror you have of this?</p>
<p>No, you didn&rsquo;t have it before.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have it when you sleep.</p>
<p>Going from the fact that you know you won&rsquo;t wake up</p>
<p>to terror is two different things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an extra step.</p>
<p>And at that point, you&rsquo;re making a choice at that point.</p>
<p>What about what some people in this context</p>
<p>we might call like the third death,</p>
<p>which is when everybody forgets the entirety</p>
<p>of consciousness in the universe</p>
<p>forgets that you&rsquo;ve ever existed,</p>
<p>that John Donahue ever existed.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a cosmic death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everything goes, yeah.</p>
<p>Not just, I would say it&rsquo;s like knowledge.</p>
<p>The history books forget about who you are</p>
<p>because the history books.</p>
<p>This is inevitable, by the way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all very, very small players in a very big game.</p>
<p>And inevitably, we&rsquo;re all going to go at some point.</p>
<p>Yeah, but doesn&rsquo;t, so you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disappointing, of course.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not even, it would be arrogance to say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed in the idea that I will disappear.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s far greater things than me that will disappear.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s crushing to think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s going to come a time</p>
<p>where no one will ever hear Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonies again.</p>
<p>That the mysteries of the pharaohs will be lost</p>
<p>and no one will even comprehend that they once existed.</p>
<p>Humanity has come up with so many amazing things</p>
<p>over its existence.</p>
<p>And to think that one day this is just all happening</p>
<p>on a tiny speck in a distant corner of a very small galaxy</p>
<p>and among millions of galaxies,</p>
<p>that this is all for nothing.</p>
<p>Okay, I can understand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of dread that comes with this.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a sense in which the moment you&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>and the moment you can think about these things,</p>
<p>you know this is your inevitable fate.</p>
<p>Is it so inevitable?</p>
<p>So if we look at, we&rsquo;re in Austin</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a guy named Elon Musk.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s hoping, in fact, that is the drive</p>
<p>behind many of his passions,</p>
<p>is the human beings becoming a multi planetary species</p>
<p>and expanding out, exploring and colonizing</p>
<p>the solar system, the galaxy,</p>
<p>and maybe the rest of the universe.</p>
<p>Is that something that fills you with excitement?</p>
<p>As a project, it&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>
<p>The whole, I mean, we all grew up with science fiction,</p>
<p>the idea of exploration.</p>
<p>The same way human beings in earlier centuries</p>
<p>were thrilled at the idea of discovering a new world,</p>
<p>you know, America or some other part of the world</p>
<p>that they sail to and come back.</p>
<p>But now instead of sailing oceans,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sailing solar systems and ultimately even further.</p>
<p>So of course that&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>But as far as relieving us from non existence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just playing a delaying game</p>
<p>because ultimately, even the universe itself,</p>
<p>if the laws of thermodynamics are correct,</p>
<p>will ultimately die.</p>
<p>Of course, we might not understand most of the physics</p>
<p>and how the universe functions.</p>
<p>You said laws of thermodynamics,</p>
<p>but maybe that&rsquo;s just a tiny little fraction</p>
<p>of what the universe actually is.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s multiple dimensions,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s multiple universes,</p>
<p>maybe the entirety of this experience.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s guys like Donald Hoffman</p>
<p>that think that all of this is just an illusion</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t, like human cognition and perception</p>
<p>constructs a whole, it&rsquo;s like a video game</p>
<p>that we construct that&rsquo;s very distant</p>
<p>from the actual reality.</p>
<p>And maybe one day we&rsquo;ll understand that reality,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;ll be like the matrix kind of thing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of different possibilities here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a philosopher named Ernest Becker.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who that is.</p>
<p>He wrote Denial of Death.</p>
<p>And his idea, he disagrees with you, but he&rsquo;s dead now,</p>
<p>is that he thinks that the terror of death,</p>
<p>the terror of the knowledge that we&rsquo;re going to die</p>
<p>is within all of us and is in fact the driver</p>
<p>behind most of the creativity that we do.</p>
<p>Exploring out into the universe,</p>
<p>but also you becoming one of the great scholars</p>
<p>of the martial arts, the philosophers of fighting</p>
<p>is because you&rsquo;re actually terrified of death</p>
<p>and you want to somehow permeate your knowledge,</p>
<p>your ideas, your essence to permeate human civilization</p>
<p>so that even when your body dies, you live on.</p>
<p>I would agree with him insofar as death</p>
<p>is the single greatest motivator for action.</p>
<p>But going beyond that and saying it&rsquo;s somehow terrifying,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an extra step on his part.</p>
<p>And not everyone&rsquo;s going to follow him on that step.</p>
<p>I do believe that death is the single most important element</p>
<p>in life that gives value to our days.</p>
<p>If you think, for example, of a situation</p>
<p>where a God came to you and gave you immortality,</p>
<p>life would be very, very different for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a talented research scientist, you work to a schedule.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because ultimately you know your life is finite</p>
<p>and actually very finite.</p>
<p>And could be even more so if fate plays its hand</p>
<p>and you die an early death or what have you.</p>
<p>We never know what&rsquo;s going to happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>As such, we get work done as soon as we can.</p>
<p>The moment you gain immortality,</p>
<p>you can always put every project off.</p>
<p>You can always say, I don&rsquo;t need to do this today</p>
<p>because I can do it four centuries from now.</p>
<p>And as you extend artificially a human life,</p>
<p>the motivation to get things done here and now</p>
<p>and work industriously and excel fades away</p>
<p>because you can always come back to the idea</p>
<p>that you can do this in the future.</p>
<p>And so what gives value to our days is ultimately death.</p>
<p>And value, it&rsquo;s not the only reason behind value,</p>
<p>but a huge part of what we consider value is scarcity.</p>
<p>And death gives us scarcity of days</p>
<p>and is probably the single greatest motivator</p>
<p>for almost every action we partake in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of tragic and beautiful</p>
<p>that what makes things amazing is that they end.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it would actually be a terrible burden</p>
<p>to be immortal.</p>
<p>Life would be in many ways very hollow and meaningless,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>People talk about death taking away the meaning of life,</p>
<p>but I think immortality would have a very similar effect</p>
<p>in a different direction.</p>
<p>So given this short life, we can think about jujitsu,</p>
<p>we can think about any kind of pursuit.</p>
<p>What do you think makes a great life?</p>
<p>Is it the highest peak of achievement?</p>
<p>You know, you think about like an Olympic gold medal,</p>
<p>the highest level of performance,</p>
<p>or is it the longevity of performance,</p>
<p>of doing many amazing things and doing it for a long time?</p>
<p>I think the latter is kind of what we talk about</p>
<p>in at least American society.</p>
<p>You know, we want people to be healthy, balanced,</p>
<p>perform well for a long time.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s maybe like the gladiator ethic,</p>
<p>which is the highest peak is what defines.</p>
<p>You asked an initial question,</p>
<p>which what makes a great life,</p>
<p>but then pointed towards two options,</p>
<p>one of longevity versus degree of difficulty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be a lot more than that, surely.</p>
<p>I mean, think about, first of all,</p>
<p>we have to understand from the start</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s never gonna be an agreed upon set of criteria</p>
<p>for this is a great life from all perspective.</p>
<p>If you look from the perspective of, say, Machiavelli,</p>
<p>then Stalin lived a great life.</p>
<p>He was highly successful at what he did.</p>
<p>He started from nothing.</p>
<p>So the degree of difficulty in what he did</p>
<p>was extraordinarily high.</p>
<p>He had massive impact upon world history.</p>
<p>He oversaw the defeat of almost all of his major enemies.</p>
<p>He lived to old age and died of natural causes.</p>
<p>So from Machiavelli&rsquo;s point of view, he had a great life.</p>
<p>If you ask the Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s</p>
<p>whether he lived a great life,</p>
<p>you get a very different answer.</p>
<p>So everything&rsquo;s gonna come</p>
<p>from what perspective you begin with this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to look out at the world</p>
<p>with a given point of view,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna make your judgments.</p>
<p>Was this a great life or was this a terrible life?</p>
<p>Going back to your point, you were actually,</p>
<p>I think, focusing the question on more</p>
<p>in terms of great single performances</p>
<p>versus longevity of performances.</p>
<p>Presumably, this isn&rsquo;t really a question</p>
<p>about what makes a great life, then,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much more than that to a great life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna push back on that.</p>
<p>So I think the parallels are very much closer</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;re making them seem.</p>
<p>I think, let&rsquo;s compare Stalin.</p>
<p>Stalin is an example of somebody who held power,</p>
<p>considered by many to be one of the most powerful men ever.</p>
<p>He held power for 30 years.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m referring to, longevity.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a few people,</p>
<p>I wish my knowledge of history was better,</p>
<p>but people who fought a few great battles,</p>
<p>and they did not maintain power, but they were.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s contrast, say, for example, Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>who died at 33 from probably unnatural causes,</p>
<p>had around four to five truly defining battles in his life,</p>
<p>which responsible for the lion&rsquo;s share of his achievements,</p>
<p>and burned very bright, but didn&rsquo;t burn long.</p>
<p>Stalin, on the other hand, started from nothing,</p>
<p>and quietly, methodically worked his way</p>
<p>through the revolutionary phase,</p>
<p>and gained increasing amounts of power,</p>
<p>and as he said, went all the way to the end of his career.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s definitely something to be said</p>
<p>for longevity, but as to which one is greater than the other,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t give a definition, or a set of criteria,</p>
<p>which will definitively say this is better than that.</p>
<p>But when you look&hellip;</p>
<p>Ultimately, we look at Alexander as great,</p>
<p>but in a different way, and we look at Stalin.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think many people would say</p>
<p>Stalin was a great person,</p>
<p>but from the Machiavellian point of view,</p>
<p>you would say he was great also.</p>
<p>But when you think about beautiful creations</p>
<p>done by human beings in the space of, say,</p>
<p>martial arts, in the space of sport,</p>
<p>what inspires you, the peak of performance?</p>
<p>I see where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>For me, it always comes down to degree of difficulty,</p>
<p>but things are difficult in different ways, okay?</p>
<p>A single, flawless performance in youth</p>
<p>is still that wins a gold medal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example, Nadia Comaneci</p>
<p>won the Olympic gold medal in gymnastics,</p>
<p>the first person ever to get a perfect score.</p>
<p>If she had disappeared after that,</p>
<p>we would still remember that as an incredible moment.</p>
<p>And the degree of difficulty to get a perfect score</p>
<p>in Olympic gymnastics is just off the charts.</p>
<p>And contrast that with someone who went to four Olympics</p>
<p>and got four silver medals.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re both incredible achievements.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just different.</p>
<p>The attributes that lead to longevity</p>
<p>typically tend to conflict with the attributes</p>
<p>that bring a powerful, single performance.</p>
<p>One is all about focus on a particular event.</p>
<p>The other is on spreading your resources over time.</p>
<p>Both present tremendous difficulties.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to say one is better than the other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also just, for me personally,</p>
<p>the stories of somebody who truly struggled</p>
<p>are the most powerful.</p>
<p>I know a bunch of people don&rsquo;t necessarily agree,</p>
<p>because you said perfection.</p>
<p>Perfection is kind of the antithesis of struggle.</p>
<p>But I look at somebody, okay, my own life,</p>
<p>somebody I&rsquo;m a fan, oh, I&rsquo;m a fan of everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying not to be nervous here.</p>
<p>But somebody I&rsquo;m a fan of in the judo world</p>
<p>is Travis Stevens.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a remarkable fellow, by the way.</p>
<p>A remarkable human being.</p>
<p>Insane in the best kinds of ways.</p>
<p>I think I started judo, I really started martial arts.</p>
<p>I wrestled, if you consider those martial arts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been in my blood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Russian, so.</p>
<p>But beyond that, the whole pajama thing we wear, the gi,</p>
<p>I started by watching Travis in 2008 Olympics.</p>
<p>Was that accidental, or did you know Travis</p>
<p>prior to watching him?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I just tuned in.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s an unusual choice.</p>
<p>It was just random, you just tuned in</p>
<p>and you saw Travis Stevens.</p>
<p>I tuned in to the Olympics,</p>
<p>and I was wondering what judo is.</p>
<p>And then I started watching.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all proud of our countries and so on,</p>
<p>so I started watching.</p>
<p>He was, I think, the only American</p>
<p>in the Olympics for judo.</p>
<p>Maybe the, so this Kayla Harrison was 2012.</p>
<p>Rhonda was there too, so I watched Rhonda and Travis.</p>
<p>But obviously, sort of, I was focused on somebody</p>
<p>who also weighed the same as I did,</p>
<p>so there was a kinda, I think, 81 kilograms.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a connection, but also there&rsquo;s an intensity</p>
<p>to him, like, he would get angry at his own failures</p>
<p>and he would just refuse to quit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that kinda Dan Gable mentality.</p>
<p>I just, that was inspiring to me, that he&rsquo;s the underdog.</p>
<p>And the way people talk about him, the commentators,</p>
<p>that it was an unlikely person to do well, right?</p>
<p>And I, the FU attitude behind that,</p>
<p>saying, no, I&rsquo;m gonna still win gold.</p>
<p>Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t do well in 2008,</p>
<p>but that was somehow inspiring.</p>
<p>And I just remember he pulled me in,</p>
<p>but then I started to see this sport,</p>
<p>I guess you can call it,</p>
<p>of effortlessly dominating your opponent in throwing.</p>
<p>Because to me, wrestling was like a grind.</p>
<p>You kind of control, you slowly just break your opponent.</p>
<p>The idea that you could, with like a foot sweep,</p>
<p>was fascinating to me, that just because of timing,</p>
<p>you can take these like monsters, giant people,</p>
<p>like incredible athletes, and just smash them.</p>
<p>With, it just doesn&rsquo;t, there was no struggle to it.</p>
<p>It was always like a look of surprise.</p>
<p>Judo, dominance in Judo has a look,</p>
<p>like the other person is like, what just happened?</p>
<p>This is very different from wrestling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built into the rule structure too,</p>
<p>the whole idea of an epon,</p>
<p>of a match being over in an instant.</p>
<p>And that creates a thrilling spectator sport,</p>
<p>because you can, as you say, with Ashiwaza,</p>
<p>the foot sweeps, you can take someone out</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s heavily favored, and if you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>Judo is the most unforgiving of all the grappling sports.</p>
<p>If you have a lapse of concentration for half a second,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>If those guys get a grip on each other,</p>
<p>any one of them can throw the other.</p>
<p>The idea, when you see someone like Nomura,</p>
<p>who won three Olympic gold medals,</p>
<p>to win across three Olympics,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an incredible achievement,</p>
<p>given how many ways there are to lose</p>
<p>in the standing position in Judo,</p>
<p>and how unforgiving it is as a sport,</p>
<p>it shows an incredible level of dominance.</p>
<p>And I think when I was also introduced at that time</p>
<p>to the idea, just like in Judo,</p>
<p>I think in Jiu Jitsu is the same,</p>
<p>a lot of sports is probably the same,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s ways to win that include kind of,</p>
<p>if I were to use a bad term, stalling,</p>
<p>which is like use strategy to slow down,</p>
<p>to destroy all the weapons your opponent has,</p>
<p>and just to wait it out,</p>
<p>to sort of break your opponent by,</p>
<p>yeah, shutting down all their weapons,</p>
<p>but not using any of your own.</p>
<p>And now, Travis was always going for,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s of course really good at gripping</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t do that whole game,</p>
<p>but he was going for the big throws.</p>
<p>And he was almost getting frustrated</p>
<p>by a lot of the opponents.</p>
<p>I remember Ola Bischoff, I think.</p>
<p>Yes, from Germany.</p>
<p>From Germany.</p>
<p>Very talented.</p>
<p>Very incredible.</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;s very good at doing big throws</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an incredible judoka,</p>
<p>but he was also incredible</p>
<p>at just frustrating his opponents</p>
<p>with gripping and strategy and so on.</p>
<p>And I just remember feeling the pain of this person,</p>
<p>like Travis, who went through just,</p>
<p>he broke like every part of his body.</p>
<p>He went through so many injuries.</p>
<p>Just this person who dedicated his entire life</p>
<p>to this moment in 2008 and then 2012 and 2016,</p>
<p>just gave everything.</p>
<p>You could see it on his face</p>
<p>that his weapons are being shut down</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s still pushing forward.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still with that, both the frustration and the power.</p>
<p>I mean, the kind of throw he does is his main one,</p>
<p>I think, is the standing, it was called Seoi Nage.</p>
<p>Ippon Seoi Nage.</p>
<p>But that was the other thing is like,</p>
<p>the techniques he used was these big throws</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something to me about the Seoi Nage.</p>
<p>I fell in love with that throw.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my main throw, standing Seoi Nage.</p>
<p>That is like&hellip;</p>
<p>Why do you favor the standing variation?</p>
<p>Because of the amplitude?</p>
<p>You get a more powerful wind up.</p>
<p>Yeah, power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you a fan of Koga?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I, Travis,</p>
<p>so Koga and Travis opened up my&hellip;</p>
<p>Travis uses the same gripping patterns</p>
<p>for Seoi Nage as Koga.</p>
<p>All the same, and the way he uses his hips and turns.</p>
<p>And I remember going to my judo club</p>
<p>and other judo clubs and they were all saying,</p>
<p>this is the wrong way to do it.</p>
<p>The way Travis does it is the wrong way to do it.</p>
<p>And I remember&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been amazed by this, by the way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to cut you off,</p>
<p>but I could literally fill 20 hours</p>
<p>of reproductions of people who will tell me</p>
<p>that either my students or other great world champions</p>
<p>are doing things wrong.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at them and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>who would I rather trust here in their judgment?</p>
<p>Koga, who was one of the greatest throwers of all time,</p>
<p>or you, a recreational guy who couldn&rsquo;t throw my grandmother.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m supposed to take your word over his.</p>
<p>Well, say, don&rsquo;t listen to what people say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you a piece of advice here.</p>
<p>Watch what the best people do, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you get superior athletic performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say that again.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to what people say.</p>
<p>Watch what they do,</p>
<p>particularly under the stress of high level competition,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when you see their real game,</p>
<p>what they really do under pressure, okay?</p>
<p>And if you can emulate that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be very successful.</p>
<p>I guess what I was frustrated with, to your point,</p>
<p>is that the argument against Koga</p>
<p>is he has a very specific body type</p>
<p>and he figured out something that worked for him.</p>
<p>The statement is that might not be applicable to you</p>
<p>or to the general public of judo players</p>
<p>that wanna succeed.</p>
<p>That, by the way, at the shallow level, might be true.</p>
<p>The point is there might be a body of knowledge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s yet to be discovered and explored that Koga opened up</p>
<p>that I wanted to understand why his technique worked.</p>
<p>It made no sense to me that with a single foot,</p>
<p>like the way you turn the hip,</p>
<p>the single foot that steps in, why does that work?</p>
<p>Because it was actually very difficult to make work</p>
<p>for me as a white belt in the very beginning.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Like people just, they don&rsquo;t get loaded up onto your hip.</p>
<p>Anyway, for people who don&rsquo;t watch Koga highlights,</p>
<p>watch Travis Stevens highlights,</p>
<p>but the details of the technique don&rsquo;t make sense,</p>
<p>but when mastered, it feels like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something fundamental there</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been explored yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Koga and Travis made me think</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know most of the body mechanics involved</p>
<p>in dominance in judo.</p>
<p>Like we just kind of found a few pockets</p>
<p>that work really well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Yamada, there&rsquo;s these different throws, Osorogari.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s like totally cool new things</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t discovered.</p>
<p>And that Seinagi gave a little peak</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s very few people that I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>that do it the way Travis and Koga did.</p>
<p>May I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The choice of standing Seinagi,</p>
<p>I should say this for your listeners.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably thinking,</p>
<p>what the hell are these two guys talking about?</p>
<p>Seinagi is one of the more high percentage throws</p>
<p>in the Olympic sport of judo.</p>
<p>Probably Uchimata is probably number one</p>
<p>and variations of Seinagi would be</p>
<p>in the top five for sure.</p>
<p>The basic choice you have in modern competition</p>
<p>is the more difficult standing Seinagi</p>
<p>where you literally are up on your feet</p>
<p>and you perform a shoulder throw</p>
<p>that takes your opponent over from a full standing position.</p>
<p>The most popular form of Seinagi</p>
<p>in modern competition by a landslide</p>
<p>is not the standing version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a drop Seinagi where you go down to your knees.</p>
<p>This means you have a much easier time</p>
<p>getting underneath your opponent&rsquo;s center of gravity.</p>
<p>The defining feature of any Seinagi</p>
<p>is getting underneath your opponent&rsquo;s center of gravity</p>
<p>and lifting them.</p>
<p>Seoi literally means to lift and carry.</p>
<p>Why did you choose the more difficult version?</p>
<p>What was your motivation?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re a smart kid.</p>
<p>You know right from the start</p>
<p>that for every standing Seinagi,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 20 drop Seinagis in modern competition.</p>
<p>One is obviously more high percentage.</p>
<p>One obviously works for a wider variety of body types.</p>
<p>The number of people who are successful</p>
<p>with standing Seinagi is dramatically lower.</p>
<p>And it appears to be a move which is completely absent</p>
<p>in the heavyweight divisions</p>
<p>and rarely seen in the lightweight divisions.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>What was the motivation?</p>
<p>Why did you willingly adopt the less high percentage</p>
<p>over the more high percentage?</p>
<p>And this would be very interesting.</p>
<p>I would love you to break it apart</p>
<p>because I apply the same kind of thinking</p>
<p>to basically everything.</p>
<p>I mentioned to you offline,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these Boston Dynamics Spot Robots.</p>
<p>When I first met Spot, I fell in love.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what exactly,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s magic there.</p>
<p>And I just got excited by it.</p>
<p>And that fire burns.</p>
<p>I wanna work with these robots.</p>
<p>I wanna work with the robots.</p>
<p>I want to, I felt like there&rsquo;s something special there</p>
<p>that I could build something interesting with,</p>
<p>create something interesting with.</p>
<p>And the same with the standing Seinagi</p>
<p>from Koga and Travis.</p>
<p>I just fell in love with that technique.</p>
<p>Just even watching,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know what the hell to do with it.</p>
<p>Was it aesthetic?</p>
<p>The standing Seinagi is more beautiful in execution.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>In my own, we&rsquo;re talking about love here, right?</p>
<p>In my own definition of aesthetic, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just beauty.</p>
<p>Cause you could argue there&rsquo;s more elegant sort of Uchimata</p>
<p>is very beautiful and effortless.</p>
<p>I love something about the dominance of it.</p>
<p>I love the idea in sport of two people</p>
<p>that are the best in the world.</p>
<p>And one of them dominating the other.</p>
<p>And to me, the standing Seinagi, you&rsquo;re lifted off your feet</p>
<p>and especially when it&rsquo;s done perfectly</p>
<p>and with really strong resistance from the other person,</p>
<p>it results in a big slam.</p>
<p>And that was like beautiful to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Alexander Karelian like big pickups.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, you&rsquo;re correct in so far as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just going with aesthetic</p>
<p>and the sense of beauty, but also,</p>
<p>but you are making as it were value judgments</p>
<p>about the throw.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fascinating to me</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s two elements to any grappling sport.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always insistent upon the idea</p>
<p>that Jiu Jitsu is both an art and a science, okay?</p>
<p>It has scientific elements in so far as it works</p>
<p>according to the laws of physics</p>
<p>and lever and fulcrum, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it also has an aesthetic element</p>
<p>in so far as you&rsquo;re making choices with technique.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re expressing who you are as a person.</p>
<p>You have 10,000 different variations of moves you could use,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re specifically choosing these.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an element of choice and self expression on your part.</p>
<p>And in so far as that is true,</p>
<p>combat sports are not just a science,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also an art.</p>
<p>So most combat sports have this sense</p>
<p>which they have the features of both an art and a science.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about high percentage in your case.</p>
<p>I mean, me personally, I&rsquo;m obsessed with percentages.</p>
<p>What are the ways to make you win?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the science part.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s also choices involved, yeah.</p>
<p>But there is an undeniably aesthetic element</p>
<p>to martial arts where you, as it were,</p>
<p>express who you are as a person</p>
<p>in terms of the techniques you&rsquo;re ultimately going to choose.</p>
<p>Does that get in the way?</p>
<p>Do you allow yourself to enjoy</p>
<p>the aesthetic beauty of a technique?</p>
<p>Of course, yeah.</p>
<p>When martial arts are done well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most beautiful sport in the world, okay?</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s done poorly, it&rsquo;s the ugliest.</p>
<p>But a beautifully applied submission hold, a perfect throw,</p>
<p>a superbly set up takedown are among</p>
<p>the most difficult techniques to execute in all of sports.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re done well, they&rsquo;re magic to observe.</p>
<p>But do you prefer certain techniques over others</p>
<p>because of their, like for example,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, for me, chokes of all sorts</p>
<p>with the gi, without the gi,</p>
<p>probably with the gi is the most beautiful to me, personally.</p>
<p>I value them above all others.</p>
<p>People mostly associate myself and my students with leg locking.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually rather surprised to learn</p>
<p>that I actually value strangle holds far above leg locks.</p>
<p>But not for aesthetic reasons, for effectiveness.</p>
<p>We can talk about that later if you wish.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s step back.</p>
<p>Sorry, we drifted awfully far off topic there.</p>
<p>I think this is beautiful.</p>
<p>We drifted along the river of life and martial arts.</p>
<p>Can you explain the fundamentals of jiu jitsu?</p>
<p>Yes. If I couldn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a coach.</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu is an art and science</p>
<p>which looks to use a combination of tactical</p>
<p>and mechanical advantage to focus a very high percentage</p>
<p>of my strength against a very low percentage</p>
<p>of my opponent&rsquo;s strength at a critical point on their body,</p>
<p>such that if I were to exert my strength</p>
<p>upon that critical point,</p>
<p>they could no longer continue to fight.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s about weapons and defenses.</p>
<p>But then, is there something more to be said</p>
<p>about the set of tools that we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the art comes in.</p>
<p>Because ultimately, you have a set of choices,</p>
<p>and those choices that you make will be an act</p>
<p>of self expression on your part.</p>
<p>Some will prefer this, some will prefer that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you come in as an individual.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an overall definition of jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>of being a set of choices that where you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>the things you&rsquo;re powerful in versus the things</p>
<p>your opponent is weak in.</p>
<p>No, I was only talking about percentages of body strength.</p>
<p>If I have, for example, let&rsquo;s say we have two athletes,</p>
<p>athlete A and athlete B.</p>
<p>Athlet A has 100 units of strength,</p>
<p>however we define that overall.</p>
<p>Athlet B has 50.</p>
<p>OK, so ostensibly, athlete A is twice as strong as athlete B.</p>
<p>But athlete B can maneuver his body</p>
<p>into a set of positions focused around a critical point</p>
<p>of his opponent&rsquo;s body, where he can apply 40 units of strength</p>
<p>out of his total of 50.</p>
<p>His opponent can only defend with 20 units of strength</p>
<p>out of his total of 100.</p>
<p>You have now completely reversed the strength discrepancy.</p>
<p>Originally, athlete A was twice as strong as B.</p>
<p>Now, on that one localized point, the knee, the elbow,</p>
<p>the neck, B is now twice as strong as A.</p>
<p>Under those circumstances, B should win.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to get at, by the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really beautifully said, is what you just said</p>
<p>could be applied to other games, other battles.</p>
<p>It could be applied to the game of chess.</p>
<p>It could be applied to war, most obviously in war.</p>
<p>I think about, for example, the American strategic bombing</p>
<p>campaign in World War II.</p>
<p>The Eighth Army Air Force was tasked</p>
<p>with the idea of destroying German industry.</p>
<p>Did they attack all of German industry?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>That would be stupid.</p>
<p>They attacked the ball bearing industry.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because almost all of modern machines</p>
<p>require ball bearings in order to operate.</p>
<p>In order for the mechanical interfaces of machines</p>
<p>to operate, you have to reduce friction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done through ball bearings.</p>
<p>If you knocked out one tiny component of German industry,</p>
<p>the ball bearing industry, the rest of it couldn&rsquo;t operate.</p>
<p>So too with the human body.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to fight your whole body.</p>
<p>I just have to fight your left knee.</p>
<p>If I can break your left knee, the rest of your body</p>
<p>is irrelevant to me.</p>
<p>But then isn&rsquo;t the art of jiu jitsu discovering</p>
<p>the left knee, discovering the weak points?</p>
<p>Yeah, a huge part of jiu jitsu is understanding</p>
<p>the strengths and weaknesses of the human body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s parts of the human body that are shockingly robust</p>
<p>and there are other parts that are shockingly vulnerable.</p>
<p>The major joints, and of course the most vulnerable of all,</p>
<p>the unprotected neck.</p>
<p>So if we take something I&rsquo;m not familiar with</p>
<p>but I was incredibly impressed by is the body lock</p>
<p>that I saw Nick Rodriguez use last time a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>But then I also got to hang out with Craig Jones</p>
<p>who showed that.</p>
<p>He also has a very good body lock.</p>
<p>So that was, I don&rsquo;t know if this body lock applies</p>
<p>to all positions, but I was seeing it from when Craig</p>
<p>is on top of the opponent and trying to pass in the guard,</p>
<p>use the body lock as a controlling position.</p>
<p>The principle behind it is that it shuts down,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve spoken about, it shuts down the weapons</p>
<p>of a very strong opponent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely correct.</p>
<p>In the case of guard position, what makes guard position</p>
<p>dangerous, what makes someone a powerful guard player</p>
<p>is the movement of their hips forward and backward</p>
<p>and side to side.</p>
<p>Body locking is designed to shut down that movement</p>
<p>and does a very fine job of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see all of my students excel at it.</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan is probably the single best body lock</p>
<p>guard passer I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Nicky Ryan is outstanding with it.</p>
<p>Nick Rodriguez is very good.</p>
<p>Craig Jones is outstanding.</p>
<p>All of my students use this for a very simple reason.</p>
<p>Understand what is the central problem of shutting down</p>
<p>a dangerous guard player, it&rsquo;s his hips.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes him a dangerous leg locker.</p>
<p>You go up against a dangerous leg locker,</p>
<p>body lock guard pass, single best way to shut down</p>
<p>most of his entries.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all strong in leg locks.</p>
<p>So in our gym, you gotta control the hips</p>
<p>as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Otherwise it&rsquo;s gonna be a very difficult thing</p>
<p>to avoid leg entanglements as you go to pass.</p>
<p>And across the board, my students excel</p>
<p>in body lock guard passing.</p>
<p>They understand what&rsquo;s the most dangerous feature</p>
<p>their opponent has, the lateral movement of their hips.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the single best way to stop that body lock</p>
<p>and then work from there.</p>
<p>So if this asymmetry of power is fundamental to jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>how do you discover that?</p>
<p>How did you discover the body lock?</p>
<p>That as one of many methodologies</p>
<p>of achieving this asymmetry.</p>
<p>It would be an overstatement to say</p>
<p>we discovered the body lock.</p>
<p>Body lock passing has been around longer</p>
<p>than we&rsquo;ve been around.</p>
<p>But what I would say is that in a room full</p>
<p>of dangerous leg lockers, you&rsquo;ve gotta have a way</p>
<p>to shut down the hips.</p>
<p>And so once we started using body locks,</p>
<p>we saw that was one excellent way</p>
<p>to get around that problem.</p>
<p>But as with all development, it comes from trial and error.</p>
<p>You will often see people teach the technique</p>
<p>to a certain level and you see the teaching,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, there&rsquo;s a lot of inadequacies there.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t cover a lot of the problems</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re encountering.</p>
<p>And so trial and error is the single most important part</p>
<p>of the development.</p>
<p>Trial and error in?</p>
<p>In the training room amongst ourselves.</p>
<p>In hard training or?</p>
<p>No, it never begins with hard training or everything.</p>
<p>Techniques are born the same way we&rsquo;re born.</p>
<p>Weak and in need of nutrition.</p>
<p>You have to build them up organically like children.</p>
<p>And you start with minimal resistance</p>
<p>and you make progress over time.</p>
<p>When you first go to the gym, do you put 500 pounds</p>
<p>on the bench press and try to bench press it?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;ll be killed.</p>
<p>You start off with the bar, you build over time</p>
<p>and then one day, five years from now,</p>
<p>you really are lifting 500 pounds.</p>
<p>But only a forward attempt, they&rsquo;re on their first attempt.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re born like children in your mind first?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a spark of an idea.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s always a spark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like scientific development on a subject matter</p>
<p>which is intrinsically simpler.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a sense in which naive</p>
<p>and overly simplistic assessments</p>
<p>of scientific method may not work well</p>
<p>at advanced levels of science, but they work damn well</p>
<p>in the training room with jiu jitsu</p>
<p>where the subject matter is inherently simpler</p>
<p>than it is in research science.</p>
<p>And as a result, there&rsquo;ll be a spark.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see something, there&rsquo;s possibilities there.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s puzzle this out, let&rsquo;s work with this.</p>
<p>And you run into a lot of failures.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve suddenly been, oh man, if I put my hip this way,</p>
<p>this works really well.</p>
<p>And then suddenly you just try and spar</p>
<p>and you get caught in a simple, normal platter.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, okay, that didn&rsquo;t work as well</p>
<p>as I thought.</p>
<p>And then you look to rectify things.</p>
<p>If things go in promising research directions,</p>
<p>you keep them.</p>
<p>If not, you discard them.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny you say science.</p>
<p>It feels more like art.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody I really admire</p>
<p>that talks about this kind of ideas.</p>
<p>Johnny I from Apple, he&rsquo;s the lead designer.</p>
<p>He recently left, but he was the designer</p>
<p>behind most of the products we know and love from Apple.</p>
<p>When you say designer, be more precise.</p>
<p>What exactly was he working on in Apple?</p>
<p>The iPhone.</p>
<p>Which parts of the iPhone did he work on?</p>
<p>The entirety of it.</p>
<p>Was he a leader of a research team</p>
<p>or was he the person personally responsible</p>
<p>for the development?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of, I would say, very similar to your position.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the last, the person executing</p>
<p>the fine, the manufacturer, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s the, he&rsquo;s somebody that&rsquo;s very hands on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay, so he worked obviously</p>
<p>extremely close to Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs has this idea.</p>
<p>We should have a computer that&rsquo;s as thin</p>
<p>as a sheet of paper, and then you start to play</p>
<p>with ideas of like, what does that actually look like?</p>
<p>The reason I bring it up is because he talked about,</p>
<p>he had these ideas that he would not tell Steve</p>
<p>because he talked about in the same exact language</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re saying, is there&rsquo;s like a little baby</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very fragile.</p>
<p>It needs time to grow.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And then Steve Jobs would often roll in.</p>
<p>Was too ruthless?</p>
<p>Too ruthless.</p>
<p>This is, he would destroy ideas.</p>
<p>Because Johnny Ive and the team didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>actually good responses to the criticism at first.</p>
<p>Because when they&rsquo;re babies, you can&rsquo;t defend the baby.</p>
<p>But you need a time to develop.</p>
<p>You need to sleep on it.</p>
<p>You need to rethink it, dream things</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating you say this, Lex,</p>
<p>because this is actually the entire history</p>
<p>of scientific development is literally the story</p>
<p>of the juxtaposition between the need to protect</p>
<p>and nurture new theories versus the need</p>
<p>to rigorously test them with harsh testing</p>
<p>that either verifies them or falsifies them.</p>
<p>And learning to find a satisfactory compromise</p>
<p>between those two is a very, very difficult thing.</p>
<p>When you look at the history of science,</p>
<p>you will see that there&rsquo;s some pretty damn chaotic moments</p>
<p>anytime there&rsquo;s major theory change</p>
<p>where all kinds of apparently undesirable tricks</p>
<p>are used to protect certain theories</p>
<p>with ad hoc hypotheses, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And ultimately, only time and success over time</p>
<p>will justify a theory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually a period where when one theory goes in</p>
<p>to replace another, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>of a battle between competing groups of scientists, some</p>
<p>of whom advocate theory A, some who advocate theory B.</p>
<p>They often use seemingly unscrupulous methods</p>
<p>to protect or attack another person&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>They dig for proofs.</p>
<p>And usually, some period of time has to go by.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in some cases, it simply</p>
<p>involved older scientists protecting an initial theory</p>
<p>dying off and new scientists just replacing them</p>
<p>with numbers.</p>
<p>And this is a common, common theme.</p>
<p>And the same applies in jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>So many times, especially when I first</p>
<p>started working with leg locks, I would show things</p>
<p>I had worked on to even world champion black belts.</p>
<p>And they would try it once or twice and fail and be like,</p>
<p>yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be like, you tried it once on another guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also a world champion who has a strong ability to resist it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>No more.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And then five years later, they would</p>
<p>see my students finishing world champions with it.</p>
<p>And in some cases, finishing the very people</p>
<p>who said that the technique would never work.</p>
<p>I mean, if there was ever a refutation of a statement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pretty clear example.</p>
<p>And there has to be a sense in which you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be too forgiving.</p>
<p>You have to test hypotheses.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, you can&rsquo;t be too ruthless either.</p>
<p>You have to look for promise.</p>
<p>And my advice is start slow.</p>
<p>Again, the analogy of lifting weights.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t lift the heaviest weights on your first day.</p>
<p>You build up.</p>
<p>You work progressively over time.</p>
<p>Now, you also have to have some common sense here.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be too forgiving to a technique</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s repeatedly failing and good people have tried it</p>
<p>and multiple good people have tried it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just not working out, then, OK, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time to dismiss it.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t be too quick.</p>
<p>Is this where your idea of training with lower belts</p>
<p>quite a bit comes from?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually just, as a side comment,</p>
<p>and maybe you can elaborate, the place, the gym,</p>
<p>Balanced Studios with Phil and Rick McGarry&rsquo;s where I got</p>
<p>my black belt, where I grew up as a jujitsu person</p>
<p>in Philadelphia, they have a huge number of black belts,</p>
<p>but they have a huge number of all other ranks.</p>
<p>And the way they picked sparring partners,</p>
<p>people you train with, is very ad hoc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very loose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those places, one of those gyms</p>
<p>where you can train for like three, four hours.</p>
<p>And you could take a break or you could jump back in.</p>
<p>Very informal.</p>
<p>And you can go to war with black belts,</p>
<p>but then you can also play around</p>
<p>with the purple and the blue belts and so on.</p>
<p>And that was really beneficial for growth.</p>
<p>And you can pick which, because everybody has a style,</p>
<p>and you can pick which style you really want to work on.</p>
<p>And then I came to Boston, Broadway Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>with John Clark, who I love.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a good friend.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a little bit more formal.</p>
<p>And I found myself, it was a very interesting journey.</p>
<p>I would be training with black belts the whole time.</p>
<p>And it was a very different experience.</p>
<p>I found myself exploring much less.</p>
<p>I found myself learning much less.</p>
<p>I mean, part of that is on me,</p>
<p>but part of it was also realizing that,</p>
<p>wow, there&rsquo;s a value to training with people</p>
<p>that are much worse than you.</p>
<p>Yes, is there a philosophy you could speak to on that?</p>
<p>Yeah, you probably know it already.</p>
<p>You know from your studies in artificial intelligence</p>
<p>that all human beings are naturally risk averse.</p>
<p>This is a bias which is deeply seated in all of us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re well read on people like Tversky and et</p>
<p>cetera, who talk about this all the time.</p>
<p>For your viewers, there are numerous psychological</p>
<p>experiments that are showing that most people,</p>
<p>to the point of irrationality, fear loss more</p>
<p>than they are excited at the prospect of an equivalent gain.</p>
<p>So for example, if you have $100 in your wallet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more worried about the idea of losing the $100</p>
<p>that you have now than you would be</p>
<p>excited by the prospect of gaining $100 that I could</p>
<p>potentially offer you.</p>
<p>This comes out whenever you get black belt versus black belt</p>
<p>confrontations or any kind of similar skill level.</p>
<p>Whenever you get similar skill levels,</p>
<p>the chances of defeat get very, very high.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you&rsquo;re a white belt</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going against a black belt, you&rsquo;ll take risk.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no shame in losing to a black belt</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a white belt.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll play more lightheartedly</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have a more fun role.</p>
<p>But when you have very similar skill levels,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to come back to what?</p>
<p>The techniques that are most likely to get you a win.</p>
<p>That number of techniques is usually pretty small.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re always battling with the same tough opponents</p>
<p>every day, where if you make even a single error,</p>
<p>it will cost you that match inspiring</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t like losing, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to stay with a very small set of moves.</p>
<p>You might get slightly better at direct execution over time,</p>
<p>but you as an individual will not grow.</p>
<p>Growth, as it does in organic life forms,</p>
<p>comes from small beginnings and builds over time.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take an untested, untried move</p>
<p>and get it on a world champion black belt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get crushed, so it&rsquo;s not ready for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a lion cub being thrown out</p>
<p>into the Serengeti plains.</p>
<p>A lion cub is just too small and too ineffective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lion, but it&rsquo;s a cub.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not until it grows into maturity</p>
<p>that it can be a lion that can dominate the Serengeti plains.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I always encourage my students to play</p>
<p>with a variety of belt types and spend</p>
<p>the majority of their time with lesser belts</p>
<p>for development purposes.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re getting closer to a competition,</p>
<p>you obviously want to change that.</p>
<p>You want to be getting more a competitive sense</p>
<p>of hard work, but you must learn to divide up your training</p>
<p>cycles into non competition cycles</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re presumably working with people</p>
<p>who are slightly lower in level than yourself,</p>
<p>and in some cases, quite a bit lower than yourself.</p>
<p>And then competition cycles where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working with people much closer to your own skill level.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about the flip side of that,</p>
<p>which is when you&rsquo;re training with people at the same skill</p>
<p>level, being OK losing to them?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You have to see training for what it is.</p>
<p>Training is about skill development,</p>
<p>not about winning or losing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to understand that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to win every battle.</p>
<p>You only need to win the battles that count.</p>
<p>And the battles that count are in the world championship</p>
<p>finals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one that counts.</p>
<p>Think about that win.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one you&rsquo;re going to be remembered for.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be remembered for the battle you</p>
<p>lost on Tuesday afternoon at 3 PM in some nameless gym</p>
<p>with some guy that no one cares about.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s going to remember that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be remembered for your peak performances,</p>
<p>not your everyday performances.</p>
<p>Focus your everyday performances on skill development</p>
<p>so that your peak performances you can focus on winning.</p>
<p>This is not a therapy session, but if I could just speak.</p>
<p>Every session&rsquo;s a therapy session.</p>
<p>There is still an ape thing in there.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>You think I don&rsquo;t feel it?</p>
<p>You think everyone in the room doesn&rsquo;t feel it?</p>
<p>Because, for example, you have never seen me roll.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s people, I&rsquo;ve seen the look in people&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>when they see me train.</p>
<p>And I could see, maybe it&rsquo;s me projecting,</p>
<p>but they think, I thought you were supposed to be good.</p>
<p>I thought you were supposed to be a black belt.</p>
<p>That look, they&rsquo;re like studying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you some therapy.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Do you know how many people have come up</p>
<p>to me over the years who have visited the training</p>
<p>halls that I work in, and they come up to me and they go,</p>
<p>man, I rolled with Gary Tonin.</p>
<p>I did really well with him, like really well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, that&rsquo;s very good, very impressive.</p>
<p>And then I see them talking to their friends, like, man,</p>
<p>I tapped out Gary Tonin.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sitting there going, yeah.</p>
<p>And you can see that they&rsquo;re just like, whoa, dude,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m way better than I thought I was.</p>
<p>Gary Tonin, all of my students, I</p>
<p>push them in the direction of giving up bad positions</p>
<p>so that they practice working, getting out</p>
<p>of critical situations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge part of our training program.</p>
<p>But Gary Tonin takes that to a level</p>
<p>that just no one else even gets close.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>He will put himself in impossible situations</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a fully locked strangle, 100% on with both</p>
<p>his arms behind his back.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll try to work out from there.</p>
<p>And seven times out of 10, he does.</p>
<p>But three times out of 10, he gets caught.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of handicap training,</p>
<p>where you handicap yourself to work on skills.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s took that to heart to a level that few people, I</p>
<p>believe, can match.</p>
<p>I just wonder what his psychology is like, because there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It goes back to what we talked about before, Lex.</p>
<p>You have to understand it&rsquo;s skill development.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take it personally.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>I hear where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all got what you call the ape reflex, where</p>
<p>we want to be dominant, OK?</p>
<p>We all do.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s thousands of white belts out there</p>
<p>that have tapped Gary Tonan, and they&rsquo;re walking around,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re posting online.</p>
<p>I tapped Gary Tonan.</p>
<p>Gary Tonan&rsquo;s one of the best in the world,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m one of the best in the world.</p>
<p>And does Gary get upset about this?</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>Because Gary knows that when it counts on stage,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to be going 100% with a set of skills</p>
<p>that very few people can match.</p>
<p>He can go into an EBI overtime at the 205 pound weight</p>
<p>division against an ADCC champion,</p>
<p>starting in a full arm lock position,</p>
<p>and effortlessly get out with no problems in seconds.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s been in that situation 25,000 times</p>
<p>with varying degrees of skilled opponents.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just no panic, no fear.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just doing what he&rsquo;s done so many thousands of times.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fine, fine example of a guy</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t give a damn what happened in the training room,</p>
<p>but when it counted on the stage, in front of the cameras,</p>
<p>it kicked in.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s an incredible inspiration, actually.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a practitioner of something you&rsquo;ve recently</p>
<p>talked quite a bit about, which is the power</p>
<p>of escaping sort of bad positions.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve talked about it,</p>
<p>which is really interesting framing,</p>
<p>is escaping bad positions is one of the best ways,</p>
<p>if not the best way, to demonstrate dominance</p>
<p>psychologically over your opponent.</p>
<p>That anything they throw at you,</p>
<p>like their weapons are useless against you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of Lex Friedman</p>
<p>kicking through on this question.</p>
<p>Your obsession with dominance is skewing your point of view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a therapy session, it&rsquo;s a therapy session.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming from a wrestling perspective.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not just Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Dan Gable.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s dominant.</p>
<p>The Gary Tonin ethic, it just goes against everything</p>
<p>wrestling is about.</p>
<p>You never put yourself in a bad position.</p>
<p>And the fact, it&rsquo;s a, philosophically,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a total reframing of showing dominance</p>
<p>by escaping any bad position.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the idea of what is the value of escapes?</p>
<p>Why do I put this in as the first skill</p>
<p>that every Jiu Jitsu student must master?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, when I talked about how it</p>
<p>pertains to dominance,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s its smallest value.</p>
<p>Its greatest value has nothing to do with dominance.</p>
<p>It has to do with confidence.</p>
<p>You can train someone and teach them technique</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re blue in the face.</p>
<p>But at some point, the athlete in question</p>
<p>has to go out there on the stage and pull the trigger</p>
<p>when the time is right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to give you that ability</p>
<p>to go from the physical skills that you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>to execution under pressure is confidence.</p>
<p>I always talk about skill development.</p>
<p>And yes, skill development is the absolute bedrock</p>
<p>of my training programs.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t finish at that level.</p>
<p>There has to be something more than that.</p>
<p>And you have to go from the physical element of skill</p>
<p>into the psychological element of confidence.</p>
<p>I can teach you an armbar all day.</p>
<p>You can get to a point where you can flawlessly execute</p>
<p>armbars in drilling and even in a certain level</p>
<p>of competition.</p>
<p>But if you believe that you can do it,</p>
<p>in a certain level of competition, but if you believe</p>
<p>that in attempting an armbar on a dangerous opponent</p>
<p>with good guard passing skills,</p>
<p>say the armbar has been performed from guard position,</p>
<p>that if the armbar fails and your opponent uses that failure</p>
<p>to set up a strong pass and get into a side pin,</p>
<p>possibly into the mount, and you don&rsquo;t have the ability</p>
<p>to get out of that side pin or mount,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t pull the trigger on the armbar.</p>
<p>And so even though you had all the requisite physical skills</p>
<p>to perform the technique, when push came to shove</p>
<p>and the critical moment came, you backed down.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t pull the trigger.</p>
<p>Building that confidence is the key</p>
<p>to championship performance.</p>
<p>And the single best way to do it is to take away</p>
<p>the innate fear that we all have of bad outcomes</p>
<p>that makes us naturally risk averse.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t believe you can be pinned,</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t believe your guard can be passed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll take risks because there&rsquo;s no downside</p>
<p>to your actions.</p>
<p>An unpinnable person and an unpassable person</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have much to fear in a jiu jitsu match.</p>
<p>You can come out and fire with all guns blazing</p>
<p>because then you know at the end of the day,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s gonna hold you down,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s gonna pass you guard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your first two goals in jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the most boring goals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not exciting to learn.</p>
<p>No one wants to come in and their first thing we&rsquo;re told,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;re gonna practice escapes</p>
<p>for the next year of your life.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s not going, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what you gotta have, that&rsquo;s your first skill.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I push upon all of my students.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see almost all of them are very, very strong</p>
<p>in escape skills.</p>
<p>They know that if things go wrong,</p>
<p>they can always get out.</p>
<p>They can always live to fight another day.</p>
<p>And that is what gives them the ability</p>
<p>to attack without fear.</p>
<p>I think that is so profound and so rare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so rare to hear this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the most painful thing to do.</p>
<p>Always ask yourself,</p>
<p>when you enter a jiu jitsu match,</p>
<p>you already know ahead of time,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to lose, how you&rsquo;re going to lose.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s only a certain number of realistic submissions</p>
<p>that work in the sport of jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>The number is very small.</p>
<p>So ahead of time, you already know</p>
<p>the most likely methods of submission loss in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>are gonna be things like heel hook,</p>
<p>armbar, rear naked strangle, guillotine, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Just work backwards from that knowledge.</p>
<p>So start off learning how to defend all of those things.</p>
<p>You know what the major losing positions are in jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Someone gets mounted on you, rear mount,</p>
<p>side control, knee on belly.</p>
<p>Those positions you can only lose from.</p>
<p>So work backwards from there,</p>
<p>getting out of those positions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I always start.</p>
<p>I always say with my students,</p>
<p>I teach beginners from the ground up</p>
<p>and I teach experts backwards.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>When a young student comes to me with no skills,</p>
<p>they learn from the ground up.</p>
<p>They start on their backs, defending pins.</p>
<p>Then they start on their backs working</p>
<p>from half guard bottom,</p>
<p>then on their backs working from variations of guard.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even get to see top position</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re strong off their backs.</p>
<p>Then they go onto their knees and they start passing,</p>
<p>start standing and passing.</p>
<p>And then they work their pins and transitions.</p>
<p>And then ultimately they stand up to their feet</p>
<p>and they work standing position on their feet.</p>
<p>So they work from ground back on the floor</p>
<p>to ground knees on the floor,</p>
<p>ground standing and then both athletes standing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gradual progression over time</p>
<p>where they work from the bottom to the top.</p>
<p>With regards to experts, I teach them end game first.</p>
<p>They must become very, very strong</p>
<p>in what finishes the match, which is submission holds.</p>
<p>Okay, in chess, we always talk about end game.</p>
<p>I do the same thing in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>I start experts just looking at the mechanics</p>
<p>of breaking people and all the submission holds that I teach.</p>
<p>You should know that I teach only</p>
<p>a very small number of submission holds, around six.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that my students have by far and away</p>
<p>the highest submission rate in contemporary Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>but they only learn around six to seven submission holds.</p>
<p>I start them with mechanics where they learn the end game,</p>
<p>how to break someone.</p>
<p>Once they develop in their mind,</p>
<p>the belief that if, the conditional if,</p>
<p>they can get to one of those six positions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very high likelihood they&rsquo;ll win.</p>
<p>If they truly believe then, when it&rsquo;s competition time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll fucking find a way to get to those positions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s confidence.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t believe, let&rsquo;s say you believe,</p>
<p>man, if I get to a finishing position,</p>
<p>an armbar or a strangle,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only like a 20% chance I&rsquo;ll finish with it.</p>
<p>How hard are you gonna fight to get to that position?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Why, why would you?</p>
<p>But if you believe there&rsquo;s a 98% chance,</p>
<p>if you get to that position, you&rsquo;ll finish.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find a way to get there.</p>
<p>That is so powerful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain things,</p>
<p>it may be going back to Judo a little bit,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a clock choke for people who are listening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with the gi when a person is in a turtle position,</p>
<p>in a crouching position.</p>
<p>And this is something that&rsquo;s done in Judo quite a bit.</p>
<p>But I have, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the technique is,</p>
<p>I have a belief in my head</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not a person in the world</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t choke with that clock choke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good belief to have.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done that.</p>
<p>And that it was, it built on itself.</p>
<p>The belief made the technique better and better and better.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re onto something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly the mindset that I&rsquo;m trying to coach.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s step one.</p>
<p>You have to believe that once you get there.</p>
<p>But you gotta start somewhere.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s step one.</p>
<p>But then you have to create a system</p>
<p>how to get there. But it&rsquo;s a damn important step.</p>
<p>So you coach the end game first,</p>
<p>and then you fill in the details afterwards.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a huge confidence builder.</p>
<p>But I just, I have to say, to admit,</p>
<p>and it makes me sad, but I think I&rsquo;m not alone.</p>
<p>I think a majority of Jiu Jitsu people are like this,</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t do the beginner step that you talk about,</p>
<p>which is focusing on escapes.</p>
<p>I think I learned the wrong lessons from losing.</p>
<p>I remember in a blue belt competition long ago,</p>
<p>I was, I think it was, yeah,</p>
<p>it was the finals of Atlanta IBJJF tournament.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a person that passed my guard and he took mount.</p>
<p>And he stayed in mount for a long time.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>And it was like one of those things</p>
<p>where I was truly dominated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been dominated in Jiu Jitsu match</p>
<p>quite like that before or after.</p>
<p>And the lesson I learned from that is I&rsquo;m not gonna let,</p>
<p>like as opposed to working on escapes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna let anyone pass my guard.</p>
<p>What you learned is don&rsquo;t take risks.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take risks.</p>
<p>Which is ultimately what kills you.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you become the best you can,</p>
<p>you gotta take risks.</p>
<p>As they say, nothing risk, nothing gain.</p>
<p>Failure usually makes us even more risk averse</p>
<p>than we started.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already mentally biased,</p>
<p>being human beings in that direction.</p>
<p>And failure tends to reinforce that.</p>
<p>I work hard in my training programs</p>
<p>to try and correct that fault.</p>
<p>Is it still possible for a person who&rsquo;s a black belt</p>
<p>to then just go back to that beginning journey, I guess?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably gonna catch a lot of flack for saying this.</p>
<p>I have a belief.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say something, I won&rsquo;t call it knowledge</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not known, but I have a fervent belief.</p>
<p>That human beings in most skill activities,</p>
<p>not all skill activities, but I will say combat sports,</p>
<p>for sure, can reinvent themselves in five year periods.</p>
<p>Now you might be saying five years?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s magical about five years?</p>
<p>Mike Tyson was 13 years old</p>
<p>when he was taken in by custom auto.</p>
<p>By the age of 18, he was beating world class boxers</p>
<p>in the gym and had already made a strong name for himself</p>
<p>in international boxing.</p>
<p>He was already a known figure.</p>
<p>It was five years.</p>
<p>Yasuhiro Yamashita, the judo player, began judo at 13.</p>
<p>He placed silver in the All Japans at 17.</p>
<p>I could go on all day with examples of athletes</p>
<p>who within a five year timeframe of starting a sport</p>
<p>were competing at world championship level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you a rough and ready definition</p>
<p>of sport mastery, okay?</p>
<p>I believe that if you can play a competitive match</p>
<p>against someone ranked in the top 25 in your sport,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a serious international sport,</p>
<p>I would call you someone who&rsquo;s mastered that sport.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re damn good.</p>
<p>If you can go with the number 25 wrestler in the world</p>
<p>and give them a hard competitive match in the gym,</p>
<p>you may not win it, but they had a good workout,</p>
<p>you know, they had a good workout.</p>
<p>You have shown mastery of wrestling</p>
<p>or indeed any other combat sport you care to name.</p>
<p>There are numerous examples of people doing far better</p>
<p>than that in five years, winning medals</p>
<p>at world championships and even Olympic games</p>
<p>in that five year period.</p>
<p>This is not an unrealistic goal.</p>
<p>There is a lot of empirical evidence to show</p>
<p>that people have done this in the past, a lot of it.</p>
<p>So if you fully immerse yourself in a sport</p>
<p>with a well worked out, well planned training program,</p>
<p>there is a mountain of evidence to show</p>
<p>that in a five year period,</p>
<p>you can go from a complete beginner</p>
<p>to like very, very impressive skill level</p>
<p>to the point where you&rsquo;re competitive</p>
<p>with some of the best people on the planet.</p>
<p>You can reinvent yourself in these five year periods.</p>
<p>What happens with most people is they get to a certain level</p>
<p>and they get complacent, they get lazy</p>
<p>and they just keep doing the same old thing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re diligent and you&rsquo;re purposeful,</p>
<p>five years, you can accomplish an awful lot</p>
<p>and as I said, there&rsquo;s a mountain of evidence to show it.</p>
<p>By the way, as a small aside,</p>
<p>somebody who&rsquo;s mentioned Tversky and Yamashita</p>
<p>in the same conversation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the most impressive people I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to.</p>
<p>But as a small aside,</p>
<p>so if there&rsquo;s this complete beginner,</p>
<p>this is really interesting.</p>
<p>There is empirical evidence</p>
<p>that you can achieve incredible things</p>
<p>in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a complete beginner standing before you</p>
<p>and that beginner has fire in their eyes</p>
<p>and they want to achieve mastery.</p>
<p>Where do you place most of the credit</p>
<p>for a journey that does achieve mastery?</p>
<p>Is it the set of ideas they have in their mind?</p>
<p>Is it the set of drills or the way they practice?</p>
<p>Is it genetics and luck?</p>
<p>Those are all good insights.</p>
<p>All of those factors you&rsquo;ve mentioned play a definite role.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with luck, okay?</p>
<p>We are all subject to fortune</p>
<p>and fortune can be good and fortune can be bad.</p>
<p>Life is in many ways beautiful, but life is also tragic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had students who showed enormous promise</p>
<p>and just tragic events occurred in their lives.</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of fortune can be</p>
<p>a wonderful thing in your life</p>
<p>and they can be a terrible tragedy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had students who died for various reasons</p>
<p>who could have gone on to become world champions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had students who on a much lighter note</p>
<p>just fell in love and just wanted to have kids</p>
<p>and move away and that&rsquo;s a wonderful thing,</p>
<p>but different direction.</p>
<p>You just never know.</p>
<p>So luck does play some role.</p>
<p>Even things like where you&rsquo;re born, the location of,</p>
<p>your physical location in the world</p>
<p>or even the socioeconomic location can play a role</p>
<p>which could be detrimental or favorable.</p>
<p>So yeah, luck does play some role.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it&rsquo;s one of the smaller elements.</p>
<p>And I do believe that a truly resourceful mind</p>
<p>can overcome the majority of what fortune throws at us</p>
<p>and get to goals provided you&rsquo;re sufficiently</p>
<p>mentally robust.</p>
<p>Other things you mentioned, genetics.</p>
<p>I do believe in certain sports,</p>
<p>genetics really do play a powerful, powerful role.</p>
<p>For example, in any sport where power output</p>
<p>and reaction speed, ability to take physical damage,</p>
<p>then there are genetic elements which will help.</p>
<p>For example, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine a world</p>
<p>in which even if I have a crippled leg,</p>
<p>so even if I grew up in a world where my leg was normal</p>
<p>and I had normal legs and everything was fine with my body,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that I could win the Olympic gold medal</p>
<p>in 100 meter sprinting, for example.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t have enough fast twitch muscle fibers.</p>
<p>But the more a sport involves skill and tactics,</p>
<p>the less you will see genetics playing a role.</p>
<p>If you look at the medal podiums in jiu jitsu, for example,</p>
<p>you will see that no one body type</p>
<p>is definitively superior to another.</p>
<p>You will see every variation of body type</p>
<p>and the medal platforms in jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>As skill and tactics become more and more important</p>
<p>and things like just power output over time</p>
<p>become less and less important,</p>
<p>then you will see that genetics play</p>
<p>less and less of a role.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to say that the sport of jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>the evidence seems pretty clear</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no one dominant body type</p>
<p>in the sport of jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Rather, there&rsquo;s just advantages for one type</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s advantages for another.</p>
<p>You just have to learn to tailor your game to your body.</p>
<p>With regards to training program,</p>
<p>yes, I believe with all my heart and all my soul</p>
<p>that your training program does make a difference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dedicated my life to that.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m biased in this regard.</p>
<p>I do believe that all of the students that I taught</p>
<p>who became world champions would have been great athletes</p>
<p>whether or not they had met me or not.</p>
<p>I believe that.</p>
<p>But I do also believe it would have taken them a lot longer</p>
<p>and they may not have gotten to the level that they did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they would have been impressive,</p>
<p>but I do believe that the nature of a training program</p>
<p>plays an enormous difference.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say this in an arrogant way.</p>
<p>I believe that there&rsquo;s, again,</p>
<p>a mountain of evidence to suggest this is true</p>
<p>because you see it in many different sports.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk, for example, about your country, Russia,</p>
<p>and its wrestling program.</p>
<p>Russia is an enormous country,</p>
<p>but the location where Russia&rsquo;s wrestling program comes from</p>
<p>is actually very small</p>
<p>and the population is actually very small.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t verify this, but I was told once,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t verify this, but the number of people</p>
<p>who wrestle in Russia is actually significantly smaller</p>
<p>than the number of people who wrestle in the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not part of the school athletics</p>
<p>and it is in the United States.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a different point.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come back right to that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s also an important point.</p>
<p>But if you look at the actual numbers of people there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually pretty small.</p>
<p>So ostensibly, if it comes down to a numbers game,</p>
<p>America should dominate at the Olympics</p>
<p>because we have more wrestlers.</p>
<p>Now, the story gets more complicated</p>
<p>because America has a different style of wrestling,</p>
<p>the collegiate style than the international freestyle.</p>
<p>That is a complicating factor.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, what you see there</p>
<p>is that numbers aren&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>Rather, the manner in which people are trained</p>
<p>clearly has an impact.</p>
<p>And we know very little about the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little reliable information</p>
<p>about the training program for wrestling</p>
<p>in the Russian States.</p>
<p>But one thing is incontestable is the amount of success</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve had in international world championship</p>
<p>and Olympic competition.</p>
<p>They are disproportionately successful</p>
<p>despite their relatively small numbers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing genetically special about them.</p>
<p>You can talk about performance enhancing drugs,</p>
<p>but those are a worldwide phenomenon.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any access to technology</p>
<p>that the rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>At some point, you gotta start asking,</p>
<p>what are they doing differently in the training room?</p>
<p>And there are many other examples of similar situations.</p>
<p>My country, New Zealand, has an insanely successful</p>
<p>rugby program, the sport of rugby,</p>
<p>which they have dominated for literally generations</p>
<p>despite the fact that our population is very, very small</p>
<p>compared with the rest of the country.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t excel in many other sports.</p>
<p>New Zealand does fairly well in sports overall,</p>
<p>but nothing like they do in rugby.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got to ask yourself, is there a culture there</p>
<p>which built this up?</p>
<p>And the world is full of examples of seemingly small</p>
<p>and unpromising areas or locations</p>
<p>putting out disproportionately high numbers</p>
<p>of successful athletes.</p>
<p>And that points to the idea that different training programs</p>
<p>have different success rates.</p>
<p>And so I truly believe with all my heart and all my soul</p>
<p>that how you train does make a significant difference.</p>
<p>I would even go further and say</p>
<p>it makes the most difference.</p>
<p>Is it the only thing?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already talked about fortune.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about genetics.</p>
<p>If you wanna get nasty, you can even talk about things</p>
<p>like performance enhancing drugs</p>
<p>that obviously plays a role in modern sports.</p>
<p>But I do believe that the majority of what creates success</p>
<p>is the interaction between the athlete</p>
<p>and the training program.</p>
<p>Now, the training program is one thing.</p>
<p>I do believe that&rsquo;s the single most important,</p>
<p>but right behind it is the athlete themselves.</p>
<p>In my own experience, people talk about athletes</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve trained successfully,</p>
<p>but they never talk about athletes</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve trained unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>Always remember that for every champion coach produces,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always going to be a difference.</p>
<p>Always remember that for every champion a coach produces,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hundred people that they coach</p>
<p>that no one ever heard of, and this is completely normal.</p>
<p>A coach can never take the lion&rsquo;s share of the credit.</p>
<p>A coach creates possibilities,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the athlete who actualizes the possibilities.</p>
<p>And so building that rapport and finding the right people</p>
<p>to excel in your training program is also a big part of it.</p>
<p>What makes the difference between the successful,</p>
<p>your successes and your failures as a coach?</p>
<p>A range of reasons.</p>
<p>The single most important is persistence.</p>
<p>People will point to all kinds of virtues amongst athletes.</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s the most courageous.</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s the strongest.</p>
<p>These are all virtues,</p>
<p>but the one indispensable virtue is persistence,</p>
<p>the ability just to stay in the game long enough</p>
<p>to get the results you seek.</p>
<p>But what does persistence really look like?</p>
<p>If we can just break that apart a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, this is a great question you&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>because most people see it</p>
<p>as a kind of simplistic doggedness</p>
<p>where you just show up every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not it.</p>
<p>The most important form of persistence</p>
<p>is persistence of thinking,</p>
<p>which looks to push you in increasingly efficient,</p>
<p>more and more efficient methods of training.</p>
<p>Famously, people talk about the idea</p>
<p>that the hardest work of all is hard thinking,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Okay, coming into the gym</p>
<p>and just doing the same thing for a decade</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to make you better.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to make you better</p>
<p>is progressive training over time</p>
<p>where you identify clear goals marked out</p>
<p>in time increments, three months, six months,</p>
<p>12 months, five years,</p>
<p>and build those short term goals</p>
<p>into a program of long term goals,</p>
<p>making sure that the training program changes over time</p>
<p>so that as your skill level rises,</p>
<p>the challenges you face in the gym</p>
<p>become higher and higher.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t kill them at the start</p>
<p>with challenges that are too hard for them</p>
<p>to deal with, they get discouraged and leave.</p>
<p>Build them slowly over time,</p>
<p>but make sure they don&rsquo;t just get left in a swamp</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just doing the same thing</p>
<p>they were doing three years ago and they get bored.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two ways you can leave in a gym.</p>
<p>You can leave from adversity, it was too tough,</p>
<p>or you can leave from boredom.</p>
<p>Everyone talks about the first,</p>
<p>no one talks about the second.</p>
<p>Most people, when they get to black belt,</p>
<p>they get bored.</p>
<p>They know what their game is,</p>
<p>they know what they&rsquo;re good at,</p>
<p>they know what they&rsquo;re not good at.</p>
<p>When they compete, they stick with what they&rsquo;re good at,</p>
<p>and they avoid what they&rsquo;re not good at,</p>
<p>and they get bored.</p>
<p>They reach a plateau, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>My whole thing is to make sure it&rsquo;s not so tough</p>
<p>at the start that they leave because of adversity,</p>
<p>and then for the rest of their career</p>
<p>to make sure it&rsquo;s not boring</p>
<p>so they leave because of boredom.</p>
<p>Travis Stevens actually said something</p>
<p>that changed the way I see training.</p>
<p>He said it as a side comment,</p>
<p>but he said that at the end of a good training session,</p>
<p>your mind should be exhausted, not your body.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve, for most of my life,</p>
<p>saw good training sessions where my body was exhausted.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe that&rsquo;s the case with most people.</p>
<p>You should come out of the training session</p>
<p>with your mind buzzing with ideas,</p>
<p>like possibilities for tomorrow.</p>
<p>And by the way, on that note,</p>
<p>I would go further and say that the training session</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t finish when your body stops moving.</p>
<p>It finishes when your mind stops moving,</p>
<p>and your mind shouldn&rsquo;t stop moving.</p>
<p>After that session, there should be analysis.</p>
<p>What did I do well?</p>
<p>What did I do badly?</p>
<p>How could I do better with the things that I did well?</p>
<p>Can I ask you about something that I truly enjoy</p>
<p>and I think is really powerful,</p>
<p>but most people don&rsquo;t seem to believe in that,</p>
<p>but is drilling?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe people are different, but I love the idea,</p>
<p>maybe even outside of jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>of doing the same thing over and over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Jiro dreams of sushi.</p>
<p>I love doing the thing that nobody wants to do</p>
<p>and doing it 10 times, 100 times, 1,000 times</p>
<p>more than what nobody wants to do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge fan of drilling.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not a professional athlete,</p>
<p>but I feel like if I actually gave myself,</p>
<p>if I wanted to be really good at jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>like reach the level of being in the top 25</p>
<p>when I was much younger, like really strive,</p>
<p>I think I could achieve it by drilling.</p>
<p>I had this belief untested.</p>
<p>Can you challenge this idea or agree with it?</p>
<p>First off, fascinating.</p>
<p>However, we&rsquo;re going to have to disagree.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna have to start to understand</p>
<p>what are we talking about when we talk about drilling?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very vague term.</p>
<p>Okay, at this moment, many of your listeners</p>
<p>are probably having the same thought process,</p>
<p>which is, oh, drilling.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know what that is.</p>
<p>We go into the gym and we pick a move</p>
<p>and we practice it for a certain number of repetitions.</p>
<p>And if I do that, I&rsquo;m gonna get better at the technique.</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to have a much more in depth understanding</p>
<p>of what the hell we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>when we talk about drilling.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any movement in the gym</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t improve the skills you already have</p>
<p>or build new skills is a waste of time,</p>
<p>a waste of resources.</p>
<p>Everything you do should be done with the aim</p>
<p>and the understanding that this is gonna make me better</p>
<p>at the sport I practice.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not, shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>The majority of what passes for drilling</p>
<p>in most training halls will not make you better,</p>
<p>including some of the most cherished forms of drilling,</p>
<p>which is repetition for numbers.</p>
<p>The moment you say to someone,</p>
<p>I want you to do this a hundred times,</p>
<p>what are they really thinking about?</p>
<p>Volume.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying, okay, I&rsquo;m at repetition 78.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at 80, 20 more to go.</p>
<p>All they&rsquo;re talking, their primary thought process</p>
<p>is on numbers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the point of drilling.</p>
<p>The point is skill acquisition.</p>
<p>When people drill, don&rsquo;t get them focused on numbers,</p>
<p>get them focused on mechanics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they have to worry about.</p>
<p>I never have my students drill for numbers ever.</p>
<p>Just one, two, three, get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Like how are you gonna get better with that?</p>
<p>Okay, get them working on the sense of gaining knowledge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my job.</p>
<p>I have to give them knowledge.</p>
<p>I have to explain to them what they&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>That starts them on the right track.</p>
<p>But knowledge is one thing.</p>
<p>Skill is another.</p>
<p>If jiu jitsu was just about knowledge,</p>
<p>then all the 60 and 70 year old red belts</p>
<p>would be the world champions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu isn&rsquo;t won by knowledge, it&rsquo;s won by skill.</p>
<p>Knowledge is the first step in building skill.</p>
<p>So my job as a coach is to transmit knowledge.</p>
<p>Then I have to create training programs</p>
<p>with a path from knowledge to polished skill</p>
<p>is carried out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the interface between me and my students.</p>
<p>And so I give them drills where the whole emphasis</p>
<p>is upon getting a sense where they understand</p>
<p>what are the problems they&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>
<p>and working towards practical solutions.</p>
<p>They never work with numbers.</p>
<p>They work with mechanics and feel.</p>
<p>Then you have to bring in the idea of progression.</p>
<p>When you drill, there&rsquo;s zero resistance.</p>
<p>When you fight in competition, there&rsquo;s 100% resistance.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go from zero to 100.</p>
<p>There has to be progress over time</p>
<p>where I have them work in drills</p>
<p>with slightly increasing increments of resistance.</p>
<p>And just as we talked about earlier with the weightlifter</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t start with 500 pounds,</p>
<p>but who begins with the bar and then over time</p>
<p>builds the skills that one day out there in the future</p>
<p>he will lift 500 pounds.</p>
<p>So too, that Jujikutami that you&rsquo;re working on today</p>
<p>is feeble and pathetic, but five years from now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll win a world championship with it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have this naive idea of drilling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something you just come out,</p>
<p>you randomly pick a move and you work for numbers</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;ve satisfied a certain set of numbers</p>
<p>that your coach threw at you</p>
<p>and then think you&rsquo;re gonna get better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even dangers with drilling.</p>
<p>There is no performance increase that comes</p>
<p>once you get to a certain level</p>
<p>and you just keep doing the same damn thing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example, you come out</p>
<p>and you hit a hundred repetitions of the arm</p>
<p>by Jujikutami from guard position.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re all proud of yourself</p>
<p>because you hit a hundred repetitions</p>
<p>and your body&rsquo;s tired and you&rsquo;re telling yourself,</p>
<p>man, I got a good workout.</p>
<p>And you come in tomorrow, you do exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>You come in the day after that and a week goes by</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve done the same thing.</p>
<p>Then a year later, you do the same thing.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, has your Jujikutami really gotten better?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;ve performed literally thousands</p>
<p>and thousands of repetitions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spent an enormous amount of training time</p>
<p>and energy that could have gone in different directions</p>
<p>on something which didn&rsquo;t make you any better.</p>
<p>Drills have diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Once you get to a certain skill level,</p>
<p>if you just keep hammering on the same thing</p>
<p>in the same fashion for the same amount of time,</p>
<p>you stop getting better.</p>
<p>Can I, partially for fun, partially for Dallas Advocate,</p>
<p>but partially because I actually believe this</p>
<p>to push back on some points, is it possible?</p>
<p>So everything you said, I think is beautiful and correct.</p>
<p>But the asking yourself the question, am I getting better?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really important one</p>
<p>and you could do that in training.</p>
<p>Is there a set of techniques,</p>
<p>maybe a small subset of all the techniques</p>
<p>that are in Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>where you can have significant skill acquisition</p>
<p>if you put in the numbers or the time, whatever,</p>
<p>on a technique against an opponent who&rsquo;s not resisting?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s, let me elaborate.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve, in my, maybe I&rsquo;m different.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably have to finish an example.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let me first make a general statement</p>
<p>and then I can give examples.</p>
<p>The general statement is I found that through repetitions,</p>
<p>and this is high repetitions combined with training,</p>
<p>but high repetitions against a non resisting opponent,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to understand the way my body moves,</p>
<p>the way I apply pressure on a human.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not actually zero resistance.</p>
<p>The opponent&rsquo;s still laying there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still keeping their legs up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still doing, they might not be resisting,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still creating a structure.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A non dynamic structure.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re presenting a target.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not dynamic.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t master the timing of things,</p>
<p>but you can master the, not master,</p>
<p>but I felt like I could gain an understanding</p>
<p>of how to apply pressure to the human body</p>
<p>over thousands of repetitions.</p>
<p>Now, for example, I just, just to give you an example</p>
<p>to know what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Saulo Herbaro and Shanji Herbaro</p>
<p>that have this, I guess, I already forgot,</p>
<p>but the headquarters position or something like that.</p>
<p>But putting pressure as you pass guard,</p>
<p>like medium passing distance kind of pressure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve did thousands of repetitions of that</p>
<p>to understand what putting pressure with my hips feels like.</p>
<p>To truly understand that movement,</p>
<p>I felt like I was getting much better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s hard to put into words,</p>
<p>but that skill acquisition is so subtle.</p>
<p>Just the way you turn your hips.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re already talking about</p>
<p>a better form of drilling now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going beyond the basic numbers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting the sense of feel and mechanics,</p>
<p>which is what we want in drilling.</p>
<p>But the reason I say numbers,</p>
<p>and maybe you can speak to this,</p>
<p>but this might be an OCD thing,</p>
<p>but it allows you to take a journey</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t just last a week or two weeks,</p>
<p>but a journey where you stay with the technique</p>
<p>for two, three years.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a dedication to it.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s a long term commitment</p>
<p>to where you&rsquo;re forcing yourself,</p>
<p>perhaps there&rsquo;s other mechanisms,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re forcing yourself to stay with a technique</p>
<p>longer than most people around you</p>
<p>are staying with whatever they&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re taking that long journey.</p>
<p>And the numbers somehow enforce that persistence</p>
<p>and that dedication.</p>
<p>First thing, that journey&rsquo;s a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>And if that technique is a crucial part of what you do,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s time well invested.</p>
<p>But always understand</p>
<p>that it comes at an opportunity cost.</p>
<p>That by spending that amount of time on that one technique,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve sacrificed other things</p>
<p>that you could have learned that could have won you matches.</p>
<p>So understand that every focus upon one element of the game</p>
<p>comes at the opportunity cost of other elements.</p>
<p>Now, as long as you&rsquo;re playing a part of the game</p>
<p>where, okay, this is central to what I do.</p>
<p>Yes, okay, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But just be aware of the danger of opportunity cost.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something no one talks about in the training room,</p>
<p>but it becomes very important.</p>
<p>Secondly, the other question you have to start</p>
<p>asking yourself is, okay,</p>
<p>that training clearly had benefits for you early on.</p>
<p>But when the point of diminishing return starts coming</p>
<p>and if you feel you&rsquo;re just doing the same thing,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s time to switch.</p>
<p>Now, if you feel you&rsquo;re still getting benefit from it,</p>
<p>by all means, continue.</p>
<p>That will be a call on your part.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been playing this game a long time now,</p>
<p>so I would trust your call on that.</p>
<p>But my job as a coach is to look out and say,</p>
<p>okay, this kid&rsquo;s been working</p>
<p>cross Ashigarami for six months</p>
<p>and I feel he&rsquo;s gotten to a good skill level.</p>
<p>If he stays any further on it,</p>
<p>the opportunity cost becomes greater</p>
<p>than the expected benefits of continuing it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my job as a coach,</p>
<p>is to direct things in that fashion.</p>
<p>If I can do a good job with that,</p>
<p>then I can take them to the next level of drilling</p>
<p>and start amping it up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I keep progress over time.</p>
<p>My biggest fear is to have students</p>
<p>run past the point of diminishing returns,</p>
<p>staying stagnant where opportunity costs comes in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not making the progress they could</p>
<p>in the time that they&rsquo;ve been working.</p>
<p>I mean, that was,</p>
<p>it was almost a philosophical question for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was always on a search on</p>
<p>because I know my mind is likes drilling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like relying on other people for improvement</p>
<p>and drilling allows me to do something</p>
<p>that is 100% me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting Lex,</p>
<p>you say you don&rsquo;t like relying on other people in drilling,</p>
<p>but in drilling, you really do rely a lot on your partner.</p>
<p>One of the first things I do when I coach people</p>
<p>is I teach them how to drill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a skill in itself.</p>
<p>And drilling is in a sense,</p>
<p>the opposite of sparring.</p>
<p>Drilling is a cooperative venture</p>
<p>where you work as dance partners,</p>
<p>complimenting each other&rsquo;s movement.</p>
<p>If I drill with Gordon Ryan and I want him to work on bars,</p>
<p>I will move my body in ways</p>
<p>which make it an interesting exercise for Gordon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just sitting there and he does a repetition</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m, okay, he does 10.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for this to be over so I can do my 10</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t wait for all this to be over</p>
<p>so we can just spar and get over all this bullshit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sad truth of most drilling in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which when good people drill,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like watching good people dance.</p>
<p>They move in unison and compliment each other&rsquo;s movement</p>
<p>and make each other look better.</p>
<p>Sparring, on the other hand, is the exact opposite of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s resistance where you&rsquo;re trying to make</p>
<p>the other person look as bad as possible.</p>
<p>And once you understand the different directions</p>
<p>in which drilling and sparring go,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when things start getting interesting.</p>
<p>You start getting fast progress.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I think I was not very eloquent describing what I mean.</p>
<p>I found myself not able to find in Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>too many people that are willing to dedicate</p>
<p>a huge amount of time to a particular technique.</p>
<p>I concur with you on Netflix.</p>
<p>Now, answer the interesting question, why?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you get people to drill with you?</p>
<p>By the way, if I could just shout out</p>
<p>the people that did drill with me</p>
<p>is usually blue belt women because they&rsquo;re smaller,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like training because they get their ass kicked</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re much smaller.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re willing to invest a significant amount of effort</p>
<p>into training.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good, but their motivation for doing so is not good.</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>But your motivation for drilling is</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to get your ass kicked.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good motivation. No black belt ever.</p>
<p>I could never find a black belt</p>
<p>that I could drill with like this.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s go back to that question, why?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean this, I am somebody</p>
<p>who likes to say nice things about people.</p>
<p>So let me answer for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Two reasons, because they find it boring.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And secondly, perhaps more importantly,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t believe it works.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are good answers.</p>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s go further</p>
<p>and ask the truly interesting question.</p>
<p>Why do they believe that?</p>
<p>If I were to answer it in the context of Russian wrestling,</p>
<p>where drilling is much bigger part,</p>
<p>is I think culturally that was knowledge</p>
<p>that everybody tells each other in Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>that drilling doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Because they never taught how to drill.</p>
<p>No one ever sits you down one day and says,</p>
<p>okay, this is how you drill.</p>
<p>And so the exercise feels futile.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t feel their skill level is going up.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t associate drilling with increased skill level.</p>
<p>They associate sparring with increased skill level,</p>
<p>but not drilling, which is a tragedy</p>
<p>because it is a fantastic way to introduce</p>
<p>and expand the repertoire of a developing student.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an essential part of every workout I teach.</p>
<p>I always say the game of Jiu Jitsu begins with knowledge</p>
<p>and builds up to skill.</p>
<p>Who wins is the one who has greater skill</p>
<p>and nine times out of 10.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s a tragedy that what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>breaks my heart to hear that you couldn&rsquo;t get a black belt</p>
<p>to drill with you, that&rsquo;s shameful.</p>
<p>But I understand, I sympathize with those black belts too</p>
<p>because the way in which most people are told to drill</p>
<p>does feel ineffective and it is damn boring.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d rather just spar.</p>
<p>They feel like they get more out of the workout.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, if anything, an indictment</p>
<p>upon most of the training programs around the nation.</p>
<p>Would you say that drilling,</p>
<p>if you were to build a black belt world champion,</p>
<p>would drilling be, what percent of their training,</p>
<p>in the entirety of their career would be drilling?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first put a proviso on it</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t do the same thing for all athletes.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s got a different personality.</p>
<p>And like Nicky Rod, I can only hold his attention</p>
<p>for two minutes at a time.</p>
<p>And Gary Tonin, five minutes.</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan, five hours.</p>
<p>Like George St. Pierre, five hours.</p>
<p>Travis Stevens, five hours.</p>
<p>They are just laser focused.</p>
<p>So everyone&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put that down as our first proviso.</p>
<p>You probably knew those answers already.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>But as a general rule,</p>
<p>if I run a two and a half hour class,</p>
<p>you can expect an hour and a half of it to be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use the word drilling,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also going to say that this is too complex</p>
<p>of a story to give now with words.</p>
<p>I would need to demonstrate it.</p>
<p>But the way in which we drill</p>
<p>is not your standard method of drilling.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s into sparring.</p>
<p>But if you give me a choice</p>
<p>between a bad drilling partner and sparring,</p>
<p>I could make the same choice that most black belts make,</p>
<p>which I would go with sparring.</p>
<p>Because you can create drilling</p>
<p>within the sparring environment.</p>
<p>Like good drilling is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Bad drilling is just a worthless waste of time.</p>
<p>Okay, before, I have a million questions for you,</p>
<p>but I have to ask,</p>
<p>can you, we&rsquo;ve described the fundamentals of jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Can we describe the principles, the fundamentals</p>
<p>of one of the interesting systems you&rsquo;ve developed,</p>
<p>which is the leg lock system?</p>
<p>Yeah, anything in particular</p>
<p>or just like a general understanding</p>
<p>of what are some of the major principles of it?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like me coming to Miyamoto Musashi and asking,</p>
<p>can you describe the principles of sword fighting?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re too generous.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with some context.</p>
<p>When I began the sport of jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>I was taught a fairly classical approach to jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>which leg locks were a part of it,</p>
<p>but not an emphasized part of it.</p>
<p>The overall culture of the times is the mid 1990s.</p>
<p>The overall culture of the time saw leg locks</p>
<p>as largely ineffective.</p>
<p>It was, we were told that against good opposition,</p>
<p>they just didn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>They were low percentage techniques.</p>
<p>We were also told that they were tactically unsound</p>
<p>because if you ever attempted them</p>
<p>and you lost control of the leg lock,</p>
<p>your opponent would end up on top of you</p>
<p>or in some kind of good position</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be in terrible trouble.</p>
<p>And we were also told that they were unsafe,</p>
<p>that if they were applied in the gym,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be far too many injuries</p>
<p>and people would be badly hurt.</p>
<p>And that was the received wisdom of that time.</p>
<p>And so I didn&rsquo;t even work with them at all.</p>
<p>And they would be shown occasionally in the gym</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d learn them, you&rsquo;d drill them.</p>
<p>But in sparring, I showed no interest.</p>
<p>You probably know that change when I met</p>
<p>the great American grappler, Dean Lister,</p>
<p>who early in his career was using Achilles locks</p>
<p>with considerable success.</p>
<p>I met him in the gym, wonderful fellow.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Achilles locks is like a straight full lock.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s correct, yes.</p>
<p>And he went on to become a heel hooker</p>
<p>and win 280 CCs later on in his career.</p>
<p>But we never met again after that.</p>
<p>And that opened some doors of inquiry and&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, he asked this first principles question</p>
<p>is why would you only use half the body in a game</p>
<p>that involves the human body?</p>
<p>Perfect sense.</p>
<p>So that opened doors to inquiry.</p>
<p>And if you looked around the Jiu Jitsu world at that time,</p>
<p>the number of specialized leg lockers was very small.</p>
<p>And most of them were from outside of conventional Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>For example, you could look around and see people</p>
<p>like Romina Sato had sharp leg locks</p>
<p>for that time period in the 1990s.</p>
<p>So they were out there, they existed.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d see people like Ken Shamrock</p>
<p>would use heel hooks in competition</p>
<p>and he had some good success with them.</p>
<p>When I began experimenting in the gym,</p>
<p>fairly soon, certain truths started to become evident.</p>
<p>And the most important of these</p>
<p>can be understood very quickly.</p>
<p>And they were relatively easy to discover.</p>
<p>The first was that most people,</p>
<p>when they went to understand and study leg locking.</p>
<p>And when I talk about leg locking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna talk about one specific type,</p>
<p>which is the most high percentage type.</p>
<p>This is leg locks, which are performed</p>
<p>with entanglements of your opponent&rsquo;s legs with your legs.</p>
<p>There are other forms of leg lock,</p>
<p>but these are relatively low percentage</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t figure heavily in competition.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll ignore them.</p>
<p>Most people made no distinction</p>
<p>between the mechanism of control</p>
<p>versus the mechanism of breaking.</p>
<p>The heel hook is what ultimately breaks the ankle.</p>
<p>But the mechanism of control</p>
<p>is the entanglement of your legs to your opponent&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>The Japanese term ashigurami</p>
<p>literally just means like leg entanglement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a generic term.</p>
<p>It could apply to any form of entanglement.</p>
<p>There are many options.</p>
<p>My idea was let&rsquo;s focus on the entanglement first</p>
<p>and worry about the breaking mechanism second.</p>
<p>This was analogous to the idea of position before submission.</p>
<p>Only you couldn&rsquo;t talk about it</p>
<p>in terms of conventional positions</p>
<p>because ashigurami doesn&rsquo;t really fit</p>
<p>into the traditional hierarchies,</p>
<p>positional hierarchies of jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>So the conversation was switched from position to submission</p>
<p>to control to submission.</p>
<p>Now, wrapping two of your legs</p>
<p>around one of your opponent&rsquo;s legs</p>
<p>gives you many different options.</p>
<p>You can do it with your feet on the outside,</p>
<p>so called 50, 50 variations.</p>
<p>You can do it with your feet on the inside</p>
<p>and form what we call inside foot position.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s pros and cons to both.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also methods of harmonizing the two.</p>
<p>So you have one foot on the inside</p>
<p>and one foot on the outside.</p>
<p>You can do it with a straight leg</p>
<p>where you heel hook from the outside</p>
<p>or you can bring the leg across your center line</p>
<p>and heel hook from the inside.</p>
<p>You will start to notice</p>
<p>as you work through these different variations</p>
<p>that some present advantages over others.</p>
<p>All of them come at a price to some degree,</p>
<p>regardless of which ashigurami option you use.</p>
<p>There will be some degree of foot exposure</p>
<p>on my part to my opponent</p>
<p>and some degree of back exposure</p>
<p>on my part relative to my opponent.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the downside of it.</p>
<p>Variations within those different ashigurami</p>
<p>enable you to lessen danger in some respects</p>
<p>and at the price of gaining dangers in others.</p>
<p>So you get this wide array of choices.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not this kind of simplistic hierarchy</p>
<p>that you see in the basic position.</p>
<p>The basic positions of jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>but there are hierarchies.</p>
<p>I do, for example, generally favor inside heel hooks</p>
<p>over outside heel hooks.</p>
<p>If I feel my opponent is very good at exposing my back</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m in ashigurami,</p>
<p>I generally prefer 50, 50 situations.</p>
<p>If I believe my opponent is very good at counter leg locks,</p>
<p>I generally prefer my feet on the inside</p>
<p>working with variations of insides and kaku,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there are broad heuristic rules</p>
<p>that we can give to work in these situations.</p>
<p>Once you start to understand</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a variety of entanglements you can use,</p>
<p>then you start getting into the really interesting ideas</p>
<p>that as you perform one given attack, one given heel hook,</p>
<p>you can flow through different forms of ashigurami</p>
<p>where you can create new dangers</p>
<p>and avoid possible pitfalls in a very short timeframe</p>
<p>as you switch from one ashigurami to another over time.</p>
<p>So that as your opponent&rsquo;s lines of resistance</p>
<p>to an initial attack change,</p>
<p>you can accommodate those</p>
<p>by switching to another form of ashigurami</p>
<p>so that your mechanism of control</p>
<p>is always pointing in opposite directions of his escape.</p>
<p>And if you focus on this idea of control through the legs,</p>
<p>you can completely change the nature of leg locking</p>
<p>and take it away from what it was in the 1990s</p>
<p>an opportunistic method of attack</p>
<p>based upon surprise, speed and power</p>
<p>into one based on control.</p>
<p>If you can do this,</p>
<p>you can undermine many of the basic criticisms</p>
<p>of leg locking which were prevalent when I began.</p>
<p>I began the sport of jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>For example, if I can completely control and immobilize you,</p>
<p>I can perform the lock very, very safely.</p>
<p>If my only way of breaking your leg</p>
<p>is to be faster and more powerful than you,</p>
<p>nine times out of 10 when I apply it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna hurt your leg as much by accident as anything.</p>
<p>But if I can completely immobilize you</p>
<p>and as every attempt you make to escape,</p>
<p>I can follow you and immobilize you in new directions,</p>
<p>then I can apply the lock with as much force</p>
<p>or as little force as possible.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll see in our training room</p>
<p>despite over considerably more than two decades,</p>
<p>sorry, a decade and a half now</p>
<p>of heel hooking using these methods,</p>
<p>the number of people severely injured by heel hooks is tiny.</p>
<p>I would say I&rsquo;ve seen more people injured by far</p>
<p>by kimuras in the time I&rsquo;ve been training</p>
<p>than I have by heel hooks,</p>
<p>despite them having a similar twisting dynamic to them.</p>
<p>If you build a culture where people focus on control</p>
<p>rather than speed of execution,</p>
<p>then the injury rate goes down appreciably.</p>
<p>The whole idea of positional loss,</p>
<p>everyone was critical of leg locks.</p>
<p>Now, if you go for leg locks and they don&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>well, now you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>The guy&rsquo;s gonna be on top of you.</p>
<p>They never make that criticism with armbars.</p>
<p>Okay, you can be in the mounted position,</p>
<p>go for an armbar, end up on bottom,</p>
<p>lose the armbar and lose position,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone criticize armbars</p>
<p>on that account.</p>
<p>More importantly, I believed from early on</p>
<p>that the best place to attack leg locks is not top position,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bottom position.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that over 90% of my athletes</p>
<p>attack leg locks from underneath people,</p>
<p>not on top of people.</p>
<p>So there is no positional loss.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already underneath them.</p>
<p>And so that criticism was null and void.</p>
<p>And by focusing on this idea of breaking down</p>
<p>and distinguishing between the mechanism of control</p>
<p>and the mechanism of breaking,</p>
<p>that created something new and something interesting.</p>
<p>There was also another advantage that I had</p>
<p>in terms of creating influence with leg locking.</p>
<p>When you look at the great leg lockers of the past,</p>
<p>they were basically iconoclasts.</p>
<p>They were people who came out of nowhere</p>
<p>who just had this remarkable success with leg locks.</p>
<p>But they were just seen as unique individuals.</p>
<p>They had their game and they were good at it.</p>
<p>What was unique about the squad</p>
<p>is you had not just one person,</p>
<p>but a team of people who came out</p>
<p>and did pretty much the same thing.</p>
<p>These people had very different body types</p>
<p>and very different personalities.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t that one kind of body type was good at it.</p>
<p>You had tall people like Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>You had short people like Nikki Ryan.</p>
<p>You had someone in the middle like Gary Tonin.</p>
<p>You had fast people like Gary Tonin.</p>
<p>You had slow people like Gordon.</p>
<p>There was every kind of body type involved.</p>
<p>And it was like, people could see this was different</p>
<p>because it worked for an entire team</p>
<p>as opposed to a unique individual</p>
<p>who had unique attributes.</p>
<p>And then started to foster the belief</p>
<p>that if it can work for a team, it can work for anyone,</p>
<p>which means it can work for me.</p>
<p>And I think that had a big effect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I owe a lot to those early students,</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonin, Eddie Cummings, and Nikki Ryan.</p>
<p>And those four kids came from nowhere.</p>
<p>Gary had some success in grappling,</p>
<p>like low level success in grappling</p>
<p>before becoming a full time member of the squad.</p>
<p>But the others were just nobodies who no one had known.</p>
<p>And yet within a five year timeframe,</p>
<p>they were all going up against world championship competition</p>
<p>and doing exceedingly well.</p>
<p>And which gives further credence</p>
<p>to the idea of the five year program.</p>
<p>And I think by operating as a team,</p>
<p>those young men did an incredible job</p>
<p>of convincing the grappling world</p>
<p>that this wasn&rsquo;t just about, well, they&rsquo;re just different</p>
<p>or it works for their body type or them as individuals.</p>
<p>It was like, no, if a team can do it, anyone can do it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what really convinced people</p>
<p>that this was something worth studying.</p>
<p>This is something that could be a big part of their lives.</p>
<p>But also convinced you and convinced each other</p>
<p>in those early days when you&rsquo;re developing the science.</p>
<p>Essentially what was missing</p>
<p>is an entire science and system of leg locks.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not like you knew for sure</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot here to be discovered</p>
<p>in terms of control.</p>
<p>You perhaps hadn&rsquo;t, just like you said, an initial intuition,</p>
<p>but you have to have enough,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s perseverance required to take,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the Johnny Ive thing to take from the initial idea</p>
<p>to an entire system.</p>
<p>Is there a sense you have about how complicated</p>
<p>and how big this world of control in leg locks is?</p>
<p>How complicated is it?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve achieved a lot of success.</p>
<p>You have a lot of powerful ideas</p>
<p>in terms of inside, outside,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s high percentage, what&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s higher reward, what&rsquo;s a low risk,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then you also mentioned kind of transitions,</p>
<p>not transitions, but how you move with your opponent</p>
<p>to resist their escape through control.</p>
<p>How much do you understand about this world?</p>
<p>This is a fascinating question.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the most powerful developments</p>
<p>are always at the onset of a project, okay?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give an example.</p>
<p>The jet engine was, I believe, first conceived</p>
<p>in the late 1930s, just around the time of World War II.</p>
<p>It was developed with great pace because of World War II.</p>
<p>Obviously, military research was a huge thing back then.</p>
<p>And first fielded, I believe, by the jet engine,</p>
<p>first fielded, I believe, by the Germans in around 1943.</p>
<p>Jet aircraft didn&rsquo;t play a big role in World War II.</p>
<p>They were there at the end</p>
<p>and they did play a significant role,</p>
<p>but in terms of numbers, they just weren&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>So by around 1945, you had the onset of the jet age</p>
<p>and the jet engine began to replace the piston engine</p>
<p>in most aircraft.</p>
<p>It was the new way of doing things.</p>
<p>If you look at the pace of development</p>
<p>of jet engine aircraft technology from 1945 to 1960,</p>
<p>it is unbelievable.</p>
<p>There was a solid decade where they were gaining</p>
<p>almost 100 miles an hour per year for a decade.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a form of growth that, I mean,</p>
<p>in the world of engineering,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only time you see growth like that</p>
<p>is in things like Bitcoin and that&rsquo;s about it, okay?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put things in perspective, okay?</p>
<p>In World War II, the standard US aircraft bomber</p>
<p>was the B17, which was a midsize bomber</p>
<p>with a fairly limited load capacity</p>
<p>and I think top speed well below 300 miles an hour.</p>
<p>Just 10 years later, you had the B52,</p>
<p>which could fly across continents</p>
<p>and deliver nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and carry bomb loads of up to 70,000 pounds.</p>
<p>In a decade, that happened.</p>
<p>If you took a B17 pilot in 1943</p>
<p>and put them inside a B52 a decade later,</p>
<p>he would literally think he was on a UFO,</p>
<p>a ship from another planet.</p>
<p>That was the speed of development.</p>
<p>Now, contrast that with the speed of modern development.</p>
<p>If I took you in a time machine</p>
<p>and I put you in a civil airliner in 1972,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a Boeing 737,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that different from what you fly in today.</p>
<p>Flies at the same speed, has the same range,</p>
<p>flies at the same altitude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that different.</p>
<p>The amount of progress between 1973 and 2020</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t very impressive,</p>
<p>but the amount of progress from 1945 to 1955,</p>
<p>or even better, 1960 was staggering.</p>
<p>And so the initial progress tends to be meteoric,</p>
<p>but after that, it tends to be incremental.</p>
<p>That said, there&rsquo;s a guy named Elon Musk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been almost no development</p>
<p>in terms of space rocket propulsion</p>
<p>and rocket launches and going out into orbit</p>
<p>or going out into deep space.</p>
<p>And one guy comes along,</p>
<p>one John Donahue type character,</p>
<p>and says, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense why we don&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>reusable rockets, why we don&rsquo;t make them much cheaper,</p>
<p>why we don&rsquo;t launch every week</p>
<p>as opposed to every few years.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense why we don&rsquo;t go to the moon again</p>
<p>over and over and over.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense why we don&rsquo;t go to Mars</p>
<p>and colonize Mars.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s not just a single jump to a B52.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a series of these kinds of jumps.</p>
<p>So the question is, is there another leap</p>
<p>within the leg locking system?</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>
<p>I do believe that we&rsquo;re in a phase now</p>
<p>where the really big jumps have already been made</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in the incremental phase at this point.</p>
<p>What I do believe is that you will start</p>
<p>to see new directions start to emerge,</p>
<p>where you start to see the interface</p>
<p>between leg locking and race link, for example.</p>
<p>The interface between leg locking and back attacks.</p>
<p>And that will provide new avenues of direction</p>
<p>which will create new spurts of growth.</p>
<p>But in terms of breaking people&rsquo;s legs,</p>
<p>just the simple act of breaking legs,</p>
<p>I believe we&rsquo;re in the incremental phase now</p>
<p>rather than the meteoric phase.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a ridiculous question.</p>
<p>How hard is it to actually break a leg?</p>
<p>Is this something you think about?</p>
<p>I remember, because I&rsquo;m a big fan</p>
<p>of the straight foot lock, not, again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about to the standing Seoi Nage.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s my Russian roots with Samba</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the Dean Lister, Achilles lock.</p>
<p>But I love, maybe it&rsquo;s my body, something like that.</p>
<p>I just love the squeeze of it, the control</p>
<p>and the power of a straight foot lock.</p>
<p>And I remember trying to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few people in competition</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t want to tap.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I remember in particular, there was one person,</p>
<p>again, the finals match, Purple Belt.</p>
<p>I remember it was a straight foot lock, it was perfect.</p>
<p>Everything just perfect.</p>
<p>And I remember going all in and there was a pop, pop, pop.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t do anything more.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t breaking.</p>
<p>It was just bending and bending and bending.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s damage to it of some kind.</p>
<p>But I wanted to like, you know, I wanted to see,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s very difficult psychologically</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, can I be violent here?</p>
<p>That was a whole nother thing.</p>
<p>With adrenaline, you can&rsquo;t really think that fast.</p>
<p>But I also thought like, where else is there to go?</p>
<p>Like, is it the shin going to break?</p>
<p>What is it supposed to break?</p>
<p>So I wondered that.</p>
<p>Yeah, in the case of the Achilles lock,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be the anterior tibialis tendon.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, it runs down, there&rsquo;s two of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be the minor one that runs on the outside</p>
<p>of the front of the ankle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be the Achilles tendon.</p>
<p>A lot of people promulgate this absurdity.</p>
<p>The Achilles tendon can rupture, but not from pressure.</p>
<p>Does the tendon or the bone, it&rsquo;s going to break?</p>
<p>The bone won&rsquo;t break.</p>
<p>I have seen on one occasion,</p>
<p>a shin bone break from an Achilles lock,</p>
<p>but there was an enormous size and strength disparity.</p>
<p>And there may have been other complicating factors too.</p>
<p>But in the vast majority of cases,</p>
<p>the Achilles lock doesn&rsquo;t really do tremendous damage.</p>
<p>It can do significant damage.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll definitely feel it the next day,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, of all the major locks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the one where it is most likely</p>
<p>a psychologically strong opponent</p>
<p>will be able to absorb damage and go on to win a match.</p>
<p>In answer to your first question,</p>
<p>how difficult is it to break a leg?</p>
<p>Not very difficult.</p>
<p>It will come down to what is the skill level</p>
<p>of my opponent&rsquo;s resistance?</p>
<p>If your opponent is not resisting</p>
<p>and you have an inside heel hook,</p>
<p>it is absurdly easy to break a man&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>Not a challenge at all.</p>
<p>You can be a 105 pound woman,</p>
<p>could easily snap the relevant knee ligaments</p>
<p>in a 240 pound man&rsquo;s leg</p>
<p>if he doesn&rsquo;t know how to defend himself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an easy thing, very easy to accomplish.</p>
<p>So the basic answer is yes, it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>If your opponent does know how to defend</p>
<p>and they can position their foot,</p>
<p>play tricks of lever and fulcrum,</p>
<p>it becomes significantly more difficult.</p>
<p>It becomes still more difficult under match conditions</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re actively looking to position their body</p>
<p>and work their way out of the lock,</p>
<p>then it can become very difficult indeed.</p>
<p>Always bear in mind that there have been some cases</p>
<p>in our history as a team where people have literally</p>
<p>just let their knees snap and continue fighting.</p>
<p>Always remember that submission is a choice</p>
<p>when it comes to the joint locks.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had some people who just made the choice</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m willing to let my knee break</p>
<p>so that I can continue in this match.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough decision to make and I admire their bravery.</p>
<p>Is there something about that,</p>
<p>just to speak to that, that you admire?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s mental toughness.</p>
<p>Would I agree with it, would I advocate it?</p>
<p>No, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t admire aspects of it.</p>
<p>Who is the greatest grappler ever?</p>
<p>You were very astute in the way you asked that question.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t say the greatest jiu jitsu player of all time,</p>
<p>you specified grappler.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the bigger category?</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu is the bigger category.</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu has four faces.</p>
<p>There is gi competition, there is no gi competition,</p>
<p>there is mixed martial arts competition,</p>
<p>and there is self defense.</p>
<p>So jiu jitsu has four aspects.</p>
<p>Grappling typically refers only to the no gi</p>
<p>aspect of jiu jitsu, so it&rsquo;s one out of four possibilities.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s the greatest jiu jitsu practitioner ever,</p>
<p>and then who is the greatest grappler ever?</p>
<p>I believe that the greatest jiu jitsu player,</p>
<p>certainly that I ever met, and I believe of all time,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sound arrogant on that</p>
<p>because really you can only go with your own experiences</p>
<p>and there are some great athletes that other people mention</p>
<p>that I just never met.</p>
<p>So, but in my estimation, the greatest jiu jitsu player</p>
<p>is Haja Gracie, my reasoning for that is</p>
<p>out of the four faces of jiu jitsu, he excelled in three.</p>
<p>And in two of them in particular,</p>
<p>he was the best of his generation by a landslide.</p>
<p>In gi grappling, no gi grappling,</p>
<p>Haja dominated his generation to a degree</p>
<p>that is truly impressive.</p>
<p>What do you attribute that dominance to, by the way?</p>
<p>Is there something, if you were to analyze him?</p>
<p>Fascinating question, I&rsquo;ll come back to it.</p>
<p>In mixed martial arts, he was at his peak,</p>
<p>I believe ranked in the top 10</p>
<p>in the world of mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t the best in mixed martial arts</p>
<p>the way he was in grappling, but he was damn good.</p>
<p>And he beat some significant people.</p>
<p>So he showed tremendous versatility,</p>
<p>gi, no gi, mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not really known in the world of self defense,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no real criteria by which</p>
<p>you would become dominant in self defense.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of a, you can&rsquo;t really judge people by that.</p>
<p>Believe me, if Haja got into a fight in the street,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he would do just fine.</p>
<p>So I have no concerns about that.</p>
<p>So I would say that if you look at jiu jitsu</p>
<p>for what I believe it is, a sport with four faces,</p>
<p>I believe you have to go with Haja Gracie</p>
<p>as the one who went out and empirically proved</p>
<p>his ability to go across those elements</p>
<p>and do extraordinarily well in all of them.</p>
<p>He even made the extraordinary step</p>
<p>of coming out of retirement and beating the best</p>
<p>of the generation that came after him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Asha?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a truly difficult feat.</p>
<p>That was incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, and a sport which progresses very, very rapidly,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a truly impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>If you ask the question who is the greatest grappler</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever seen, I would say I&rsquo;ve never seen</p>
<p>anyone better than Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>Now people are gonna jump when I give these two names.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna say, well, Dan, you&rsquo;re close friends</p>
<p>with Haja and you&rsquo;re close friends with Gordon,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re biased.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t answer them to that, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good friends with both of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a notoriously cold and unemotional person</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m saying this based upon things that I&rsquo;ve observed.</p>
<p>If I honestly believed that I&rsquo;d seen other people</p>
<p>who were better, I would have said it.</p>
<p>Will that convince the people who criticize me</p>
<p>are biased, probably not, but those are the two names</p>
<p>that I will mention.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an uncontroversial statement to say</p>
<p>that Gordon Ryan is one of the greatest grappler ever.</p>
<p>Yeah, Gordon&rsquo;s obviously a very polarizing figure</p>
<p>and people tend to react to Gordon on an emotional level</p>
<p>rather than a statistical level</p>
<p>and that colors a lot of people&rsquo;s minds,</p>
<p>but I also have the benefit that I&rsquo;ve seen both</p>
<p>of these guys extensively in the gym</p>
<p>and that adds a whole new perspective.</p>
<p>If you think those guys are dominant on the stage,</p>
<p>wait till you see them in the gym.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even a different level of domination</p>
<p>above and beyond what they did in competition.</p>
<p>Have they trained against each other in the gym?</p>
<p>No, they never trained together.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been in the same gym, I think, only on one occasion.</p>
<p>When Hodger was stopped by New York,</p>
<p>he came by to say hello and Gordon was here at the time.</p>
<p>They shake hands, they know each other</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both wonderful people in their own way.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to talk to you about Gordon,</p>
<p>Hodger and George GSP.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first talk about what do you think,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very different from my perspective,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me, but very different artists,</p>
<p>masters of their pursuits.</p>
<p>So what makes Hodger so good?</p>
<p>Hodger was probably the living embodiment</p>
<p>of someone who played a classical jiu jitsu game</p>
<p>based around the fundamental four steps of jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>And like if you took someone</p>
<p>who had taken introduction lessons in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>for three months, they would recognize the outlines</p>
<p>of Hodger&rsquo;s game with many of the techniques</p>
<p>they learned in those first three months.</p>
<p>Hodger was the best example of the dichotomy</p>
<p>between the fundamentals of jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>but also a kind of hidden sophistication</p>
<p>underneath those fundamentals.</p>
<p>People always say, oh, Hodger&rsquo;s game was so basic.</p>
<p>No, the outlines of Hodger&rsquo;s game were basic,</p>
<p>but the degree of sophistication</p>
<p>and the application was extraordinary, and his ability</p>
<p>to refine existing technology was truly impressive.</p>
<p>I never saw anyone in his generation</p>
<p>that even came close to his ability,</p>
<p>both in competition and in the gym.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Hodger Gracie basically used, just like you said,</p>
<p>a very simple techniques on the surface</p>
<p>from the outsider&rsquo;s perspective that most people learn</p>
<p>when they start jiu jitsu, like passing guard</p>
<p>in a very simple way, taking mount and choking from mount.</p>
<p>Also, when he&rsquo;s on his back, it&rsquo;s closed guard</p>
<p>and all the basic submissions from closed guard,</p>
<p>arm bar and triangle, and just, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And being able to dominate, shut down, and submit.</p>
<p>So control and submit the best people in the world</p>
<p>for many, many years, just like you said,</p>
<p>including coming out of retirement and beating the best,</p>
<p>perhaps by far the best of the next generation.</p>
<p>So that just kind of lays out the story.</p>
<p>Is there some lessons about his systems</p>
<p>that you learn in developing your own systems?</p>
<p>Excellent question.</p>
<p>The thing which always impressed me the most about Hodger</p>
<p>was his relentless pursuit of position to submission.</p>
<p>Everything was done with the belief</p>
<p>that no victory was worthwhile</p>
<p>if it didn&rsquo;t involve submitting his opponent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mindset that I tried very, very hard</p>
<p>to imbue in my students.</p>
<p>The easiest path to victory in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>is the one which takes the least risk.</p>
<p>So for example, you will see many modern athletes</p>
<p>focus on scoring the first point or the first advantage,</p>
<p>and then doing the minimum amount of work</p>
<p>to eke out a victory once they&rsquo;ve done that.</p>
<p>They get a small tactical advantage,</p>
<p>they realize they&rsquo;re ahead, take no more risks,</p>
<p>and just do the minimum amount of work to get the victory.</p>
<p>Hodger&rsquo;s mindset was always to take</p>
<p>the riskier gambit of submission,</p>
<p>which entails a lot more work,</p>
<p>and in many cases, a lot more skill.</p>
<p>What I always liked about Hodger</p>
<p>is he never tried to play tactics.</p>
<p>It was always just go out there</p>
<p>and try to win by submission.</p>
<p>And that more than anything,</p>
<p>that mindset of looking for the most perfect victory</p>
<p>rather than the victory that takes the least skill</p>
<p>and the least effort is probably the thing</p>
<p>I took from his career the most</p>
<p>and tried to work on in my students.</p>
<p>I always wonder what are the little details</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing under there when he&rsquo;s in mount,</p>
<p>the little adjustments.</p>
<p>But perhaps that&rsquo;s almost indescribable,</p>
<p>the details of that control.</p>
<p>What makes Gordon Ryan, the greatest grappler of all time,</p>
<p>so good?</p>
<p>With Gordon, he&rsquo;s also very strong on fundamentals,</p>
<p>all of my students are,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also obviously a member</p>
<p>of a new generation of no geek grapplers</p>
<p>that also bring in technologies</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t really emphasized</p>
<p>in previous generations specifically.</p>
<p>The prolific use of lower body attacks,</p>
<p>especially from bottom position.</p>
<p>This means that he can play a game</p>
<p>between upper body and lower body,</p>
<p>which was not really a part of Hodges game.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you will also see significant similarities.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a very strong and crushing passing game to mount</p>
<p>and a very strong and crushing passing game to the back.</p>
<p>You will see that the major differences</p>
<p>between the two are from bottom position.</p>
<p>Hodges bottom game is essentially based</p>
<p>around his close guard.</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan&rsquo;s game is based around his butterfly guard.</p>
<p>So one is based on outside control</p>
<p>and one is based on inside control.</p>
<p>One focuses almost entirely on the classical notion</p>
<p>of getting past the legs to the upper body</p>
<p>and the other one works between the two as alternatives</p>
<p>and sees them as competing alternatives</p>
<p>where the stronger you become at one,</p>
<p>the more your opponent has to overreact</p>
<p>and become vulnerable to the second.</p>
<p>So they have strong similarities in top position</p>
<p>but are very different in bottom.</p>
<p>He has, from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>a calm to him in the heat of battle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s inspiring and confusing.</p>
<p>Is there something you could speak</p>
<p>to the psychological aspect of Gordon Ryan?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>People will talk all day about sports psychology</p>
<p>and they will often have heated arguments</p>
<p>as to what&rsquo;s the right psychological state to be in</p>
<p>when you go out to compete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen any one school of thought</p>
<p>which gave noticeably better sports performance than another.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen any psychological mindset</p>
<p>prove to be reliably more efficient</p>
<p>or effective than another.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen fighters that were scared out of their minds</p>
<p>when they went out every time to fight</p>
<p>and yet they were very successful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen fighters go out who were relaxed and calm</p>
<p>and they too can be successful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen both mindsets win, I&rsquo;ve seen both mindsets lose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen every extreme between them.</p>
<p>What I generally recommend</p>
<p>with regards your mind and preparation going in,</p>
<p>find what works for you.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to give a one size fits all</p>
<p>in something as vague and confusing as the human mind.</p>
<p>Having said that, my preference,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t force it on people because everyone&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>but my preference is to try and advocate</p>
<p>for a mindset of unexceptionalism.</p>
<p>Most people see competition as something exceptional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your everyday grappling session.</p>
<p>You train 300 times for every time you compete</p>
<p>and so they see competition as something exceptional,</p>
<p>different, scarier, more nerve wracking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a crowd watching, there&rsquo;s cameras.</p>
<p>My reputation is on the line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be observed and judged</p>
<p>and so they see it as this exceptional event.</p>
<p>My general preference is to see it</p>
<p>as an unexceptional event, to see everything else,</p>
<p>the noise, the cameras, the crowd as illusions.</p>
<p>The only reality is a stage,</p>
<p>an opponent on the other side of it</p>
<p>and a referee adjudicating you</p>
<p>and to make it as unexceptional as possible.</p>
<p>Gordon does an extraordinarily good job of doing that.</p>
<p>Gordon looks more tense in most of his training sessions</p>
<p>than he does in his competitions</p>
<p>because he knows his training partners</p>
<p>are typically better than the people</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s actually going out to compete against.</p>
<p>And you see it in his demeanor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of just complete calm.</p>
<p>It also goes back to what we talked about earlier</p>
<p>about the power of escapes.</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan is almost impossible to control</p>
<p>for extended periods of time</p>
<p>in most of the inferior positions in the sport</p>
<p>and most of the submissions.</p>
<p>So he goes out in the full knowledge</p>
<p>that the worst case scenario isn&rsquo;t that bad for him</p>
<p>and so nothing could really go that badly wrong.</p>
<p>He can always recover from any given mistake</p>
<p>and go on to victory.</p>
<p>When you believe those things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a calm demeanor.</p>
<p>Then if you look at somebody who is quite a bit different</p>
<p>than that, George St. Pierre,</p>
<p>who at least in the way he describes it,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s basically exceptionally anxious</p>
<p>and terrified approaching a fight</p>
<p>and he loves training.</p>
<p>And hates fighting.</p>
<p>So and just like you said, he made it work for him.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s somebody, he speaks very highly of you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s worked with you quite a bit in training.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve studied him.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve worked with him.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve coached him.</p>
<p>Interesting, I&rsquo;ve actually coached George</p>
<p>for twice the length of any of the squad members.</p>
<p>So my knowledge of him is far greater than it is</p>
<p>for the contemporary squad.</p>
<p>So can you speak to what makes George St. Pierre,</p>
<p>who I think even though I&rsquo;m Russian</p>
<p>and a little bit partial towards Fedor and the Russians,</p>
<p>but I think he is in the four categories you mentioned,</p>
<p>the greatest mixed martial artist of all time.</p>
<p>What makes him so good?</p>
<p>His approach, his techniques, his mind.</p>
<p>His approach is certainly part of it.</p>
<p>George started mixed martial arts at a time when the sport</p>
<p>was in a pretty wild phase.</p>
<p>It was illegal to show on most American TV networks.</p>
<p>And there was talk about it being banned as a sport.</p>
<p>In his native Canada, it was banned.</p>
<p>You could only fight on Indian reservations in Canada.</p>
<p>I believe his first fight may have</p>
<p>been on an Indian reservation.</p>
<p>So the sport at that stage was very much in its infancy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably fair to say that most</p>
<p>of the athletes involved in the sport</p>
<p>came from a training program that would probably</p>
<p>describe as unprofessional in the contemporary scene.</p>
<p>George is one of a handful of people</p>
<p>who started approaching the sport in a truly</p>
<p>professional fashion.</p>
<p>It was like, OK, here&rsquo;s what great athletes</p>
<p>in other sports do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to emulate that.</p>
<p>And his ability to invest in himself.</p>
<p>In my own experience, for example,</p>
<p>George, when I first met him, was a garbage man.</p>
<p>And he would jump on a bus from Montreal to New York.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a long bus ride.</p>
<p>He would come down on a Friday afternoon</p>
<p>when he finished work as a garbage man,</p>
<p>stay for the weekend, and then late on Sunday night,</p>
<p>he would jump on a bus all the way back to Montreal</p>
<p>and work as a garbage man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an extraordinary commitment</p>
<p>for a young man to make.</p>
<p>And George was a blue belt at the time.</p>
<p>And so he would come down.</p>
<p>And we had a very talented room.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t do well in the room when he first came in.</p>
<p>He was inexperienced in jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>And the people who went against were considerably better</p>
<p>than him at jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>So imagine investing 25% of your weekly income, maybe even more.</p>
<p>New York&rsquo;s an expensive town, 50%,</p>
<p>to come down and just get your ass kicked month by month.</p>
<p>Yeah, that says a lot about who he is.</p>
<p>Tells you a lot.</p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s talk about the whole idea</p>
<p>of delayed gratification here.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s saying,</p>
<p>this is highly unpleasant.</p>
<p>But I have a vision of myself in the future.</p>
<p>And I have to go through this extreme case</p>
<p>of delayed gratification to get to that distant goal, which</p>
<p>may never happen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a level of commitment and self belief,</p>
<p>which is just extraordinary.</p>
<p>I always laugh when people say, oh, George was afraid,</p>
<p>so he was mentally weak.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a very, very shallow understanding</p>
<p>of mental strength and weakness.</p>
<p>George felt anxiety.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s understand from the start,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different kinds of mental strength.</p>
<p>And the most important kind isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>whether you feel fear or don&rsquo;t feel fear</p>
<p>before you step into fight.</p>
<p>The most important form of mental strength</p>
<p>is discipline and training.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where most people break.</p>
<p>I know dozens of people who are fearless to fight,</p>
<p>but you couldn&rsquo;t get them to come into the gym</p>
<p>for three months in a row and work on skills.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re mentally strong one way, they don&rsquo;t feel fear.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re mentally weak in another,</p>
<p>which is to instill the discipline which keeps you</p>
<p>on a road to progress over time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much tougher than not feeling fear</p>
<p>before you go out to fight.</p>
<p>Understand also that when George talks about fear,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not afraid of his opponent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s afraid of failure.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got high standards.</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s got high standards can change the world.</p>
<p>His standards were very, very high.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he was afraid of.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of his opponents.</p>
<p>And yet, that&rsquo;s always been the misinterpretation.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t mentally weak.</p>
<p>He was mentally strong as an ox.</p>
<p>To stay in his training regimen year after year after year</p>
<p>and do so while he became one of the first stars</p>
<p>in mixed martial arts to actually make money.</p>
<p>And it gets tough to stay in the training gym</p>
<p>with people who are young and hungry</p>
<p>and want to punch you in the face.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re coming out of a luxury room,</p>
<p>living in finery towards the end of his career</p>
<p>and still training as hard as ever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an impressive thing.</p>
<p>And always he valued perfection.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, the fear was not achieving the perfection.</p>
<p>Is there something you&rsquo;ve observed</p>
<p>about the way he approaches training that stands out to you?</p>
<p>Or is it simply the dedication?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s never just about dedication.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of dedicated people in the world,</p>
<p>but most of them are unsuccessful.</p>
<p>If you want to be the best in the world at anything,</p>
<p>you have to do, out of the many skills of whatever industry</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in, you have to take at least one of those skills</p>
<p>and be the best in the world at it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many skills in mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>But George identified one skill, which</p>
<p>is the skill of striking to take downs.</p>
<p>He calls it shootboxing.</p>
<p>Shootboxing was barely even a category of skill</p>
<p>when George began.</p>
<p>It was just the idea that wrestlers grabbed people</p>
<p>and took them down the same way they did in wrestling.</p>
<p>And you threw some punches before you did it.</p>
<p>George largely pioneered the science</p>
<p>of creating an interface between striking and take downs.</p>
<p>He did it at a time where no one else before him</p>
<p>had made it into a system or a science.</p>
<p>He did it largely on his own.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always said George is the only athlete</p>
<p>that I ever coached who taught me more than I taught him.</p>
<p>And almost singlehandedly, he created this strong sense</p>
<p>of shootboxing as a science, which</p>
<p>enabled him throughout his career</p>
<p>to determine where the fight would take place.</p>
<p>Would it be standing, or would it be on the ground?</p>
<p>And that, more than anything else,</p>
<p>was the defining characteristic of his success.</p>
<p>I will always be immensely impressed</p>
<p>by his accomplishment in that regard.</p>
<p>He was an innovator.</p>
<p>He did things differently.</p>
<p>This is such an important point.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go out there in combat sports</p>
<p>and do the same things that everybody else is doing</p>
<p>and expect to get different results.</p>
<p>Life doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>If you want to be dominant, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to find one important part of the sport,</p>
<p>and preferably more important than the rest of the sport,</p>
<p>and preferably more than one, and be the best in the world</p>
<p>at it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be weak at anything, but you can&rsquo;t be strong</p>
<p>at everything either.</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s not long enough for us to develop</p>
<p>a truly complete skill set.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to be good at everything,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got to be the best at at least one thing.</p>
<p>And George was the best at two.</p>
<p>In his era, he was the best at striking to takedowns,</p>
<p>and he was the best at integrating striking</p>
<p>and grappling on the floor.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a completely ridiculous question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a fascinating one for me</p>
<p>from an engineering and a scientific perspective.</p>
<p>When I look at a sport, really any problem,</p>
<p>one way to ask how difficult is this problem</p>
<p>is to see how can I build a machine that competes</p>
<p>with a human being at that problem.</p>
<p>You can look at chess.</p>
<p>You can look at soccer, Robocup,</p>
<p>and then you can look at grappling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about when you start to think,</p>
<p>how would I build an AI system, a robot that defeats somebody</p>
<p>like a Gordon Ryan, where it forces you to really think</p>
<p>about formalizing this art as an engineering discipline</p>
<p>in the same way you do, but you still have some art</p>
<p>injected in there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no space for art when you actually have</p>
<p>to build the system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a ridiculous question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a damn interesting question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put aside, like I mentioned</p>
<p>with the Boston Dynamics spot robots,</p>
<p>what people don&rsquo;t realize is the amount of power</p>
<p>they can deliver is huge.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take that weapon aside,</p>
<p>just the amount of force you&rsquo;re able to deliver.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re specifying that.</p>
<p>So essentially, your question is, can a talented group</p>
<p>of engineers create a robot which could defeat Gordon Ryan?</p>
<p>On the face of it, as you just pointed out,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the easiest project in the world,</p>
<p>just create a robot that carries a nine millimeter automatic</p>
<p>and shoot them five times in the chest.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s it, Gordon Ryan&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not the interesting question.</p>
<p>The interesting question, and if I understand you correctly,</p>
<p>is if we had the ability to create a robot</p>
<p>whose physical powers were identical to Gordon Ryan,</p>
<p>not inferior and not superior, what would it take</p>
<p>to create a mind inside that robot that would beat</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan in the majority of matches?</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s two ways to build AI systems.</p>
<p>This is true for autonomous driving, for example,</p>
<p>which has been quite contested recently.</p>
<p>So one is you basically, one way to describe it</p>
<p>is you have a giant set of rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this tree of rules where you apply</p>
<p>in different condition when there&rsquo;s a pattern you see,</p>
<p>you apply a rule and they&rsquo;re hard coded in.</p>
<p>You basically get like a John Donr type of character</p>
<p>who tries to encode, hard code into the system,</p>
<p>all the moves you should do in every single case.</p>
<p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t actually do that fully.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to be taking shortcuts,</p>
<p>what are called heuristics,</p>
<p>just a basic kind of generalizations</p>
<p>and apply your own expertise as an expert of,</p>
<p>in this case, grappling,</p>
<p>to see how that can be coded as a rule.</p>
<p>Now, the other approach,</p>
<p>Elon Musk and Tesla are taking this approach,</p>
<p>which is called machine learning,</p>
<p>which is create a basic framework</p>
<p>of the kind of things you should be observing</p>
<p>and what are the measures, metrics of success,</p>
<p>and then just observe and see which things lead to success,</p>
<p>more success and which lead to less success.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a delta.</p>
<p>Like when you see a thing,</p>
<p>first of all, the way machine learning works</p>
<p>is you predict, you see a position or you see a situation</p>
<p>and then you predict how good that is</p>
<p>and then you watch how it actually turns out</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s worse or better, you adjust your expectations.</p>
<p>And through that process, you can learn quite a lot.</p>
<p>The challenge is,</p>
<p>and this might be a very true challenge in grappling,</p>
<p>is like in driving, you can&rsquo;t crash.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a physical world.</p>
<p>In chess, for example,</p>
<p>where this approach has been exceptionally successful,</p>
<p>you can work in simulation.</p>
<p>So you can have AI system that, for example,</p>
<p>as in the case with AlphaZero by DeepMind,</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s DeepMind,</p>
<p>it can play itself in simulation millions of times,</p>
<p>billions of times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to know if it&rsquo;s possible to do that</p>
<p>in simulation for anything that involves human movement,</p>
<p>like grappling.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, my sense is,</p>
<p>if we first look at the hard encoding,</p>
<p>if you were to try to describe Gordon Ryan to a machine,</p>
<p>how many rules are in there, do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, first off, let me tell you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the most fascinating questions</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever been asked.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m tremendously happy to answer this.</p>
<p>How about what we do is,</p>
<p>this is a massive question you&rsquo;ve asked.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of ways</p>
<p>this could get very interesting and very confusing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s set some ground rules for the discussion.</p>
<p>Lex alluded to the idea of man versus machine and chess.</p>
<p>Okay, and I think that&rsquo;s a really good place</p>
<p>for us to start the discussion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna just tell people about a little bit,</p>
<p>the history of man versus chess,</p>
<p>to give you guys some background on this.</p>
<p>In 1968, there was a party in which a highly ranked,</p>
<p>not a world champion, but a highly ranked chess player,</p>
<p>his name was Levy,</p>
<p>and he met a computer engineer at a party,</p>
<p>and they had a lighthearted bet</p>
<p>that in a 10 year timeframe,</p>
<p>a human chess player would be defeated by a computer.</p>
<p>Now, you gotta remember, 1968,</p>
<p>computing power was very, very low.</p>
<p>The computers that got America to the moon</p>
<p>were actually pretty damn primitive.</p>
<p>Your iPhone would kick all of their asses.</p>
<p>So computational power was very, very low in those days.</p>
<p>So interestingly, the chess player fully believed</p>
<p>that no computer could beat him in the 10 year timeframe,</p>
<p>and the computer engineer was very optimistic</p>
<p>that he was wrong, and in fact,</p>
<p>10 years, the computer would win.</p>
<p>10 years later, they had a competition,</p>
<p>and the human won, decisively, in fact.</p>
<p>So computational power simply hadn&rsquo;t risen to that level yet.</p>
<p>Through the 1980s, computational power increased,</p>
<p>but not sufficient to get to championship level.</p>
<p>There were computer programs in the 1980s</p>
<p>which were competitive with good, solid chess players,</p>
<p>but not world beaters.</p>
<p>Understand right from the start</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a fundamental problem here.</p>
<p>The number of options that the two players in a chessboard</p>
<p>can run through is astronomically high.</p>
<p>There are 64 squares on a chessboard.</p>
<p>The number of possible options that could work</p>
<p>or could play out on a chessboard,</p>
<p>and this is a truly shocking thing for you to think about,</p>
<p>the number of possible options is higher</p>
<p>than the number of atoms in the known universe.</p>
<p>Think about that for a second in terms of complexity, okay?</p>
<p>The number of atoms on this table is massive, okay?</p>
<p>That is an unbelievably large number.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a situation where if a computer</p>
<p>had to go through all the options at the onset of a match,</p>
<p>they would have to run numbers greater</p>
<p>than the number of atoms in the known universe.</p>
<p>The number of galaxies in our universe is vast, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s measured in the billions.</p>
<p>Like, the number of atoms,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a number so mind blowing it&rsquo;s impossible, okay?</p>
<p>So no computer is ever going to be able to work</p>
<p>with those kinds of numbers, okay?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know future generations of quantum computers</p>
<p>could work with those kinds of numbers.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the fundamental problem, okay?</p>
<p>The number of options in a chess match</p>
<p>is just so astronomically large</p>
<p>that no computer could ever figure out</p>
<p>all the available options</p>
<p>and make decisions in a given timeframe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the fundamental problem.</p>
<p>So as Lex correctly pointed out,</p>
<p>the way you get around this is by the use of heuristics.</p>
<p>These are rules of thumb,</p>
<p>which give general guidelines to action.</p>
<p>So for example, in jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>I could give you a general rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t turn your back on your opponent, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a solid piece of advice.</p>
<p>There are obviously some exceptions to that rule,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good solid piece of advice to give a beginner.</p>
<p>The moment you give that heuristic rule,</p>
<p>you rule out a lot of options, okay?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already told someone don&rsquo;t turn your back,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t turn your back on someone.</p>
<p>So a lot of possibilities</p>
<p>have just been turned away right there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve cut the number of options in half right there</p>
<p>just by giving one heuristic rule, okay?</p>
<p>If you were decent at chess, not great, but decent,</p>
<p>and you knew enough to give say 10 heuristic rules,</p>
<p>you could chop that initially vast number of options down</p>
<p>by a vast amount.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re starting to get to a point</p>
<p>where if a computer had sufficient computational power,</p>
<p>it could start getting through the number of options</p>
<p>in that acceptable timeframe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the general pattern of the development.</p>
<p>Now, things started getting very interesting</p>
<p>in the mid 1990s with IBM&rsquo;s computer Deep Blue.</p>
<p>There was a great chess champion of the late 1980s</p>
<p>and early through the 1990s called Gary Kasparov,</p>
<p>who had been more or less undefeated for a decade.</p>
<p>In 1996, he took on IBM&rsquo;s computer Deep Blue.</p>
<p>Just to correct the record, he was undefeated.</p>
<p>I apologize, Russian, gotta make sure.</p>
<p>They get very nationalistic about their chess.</p>
<p>Be careful of these guys.</p>
<p>Deep Blue lost the first confrontation, I believe, in 1996.</p>
<p>It was competitive, but lost.</p>
<p>Then in 1997, Deep Blue won.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t a complete walkover.</p>
<p>Kasparov, I believe, won one of the matches.</p>
<p>But they did, Deep Blue unequivocally won the confrontation.</p>
<p>And it was seen as like this watershed moment</p>
<p>where a computer beat the best human chess player</p>
<p>on the planet, and that was it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no coming back from that.</p>
<p>I think it would be remembered as one of the biggest moments</p>
<p>in computing history, is really when the first time</p>
<p>a machine beat a human at a thing</p>
<p>that humans really care about</p>
<p>in the domain of intellectual pursuits.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a powerful, powerful moment.</p>
<p>Now, not only was that a powerful moment,</p>
<p>but things started getting truly interesting</p>
<p>from that moment forward,</p>
<p>because then you started having</p>
<p>different areas of development.</p>
<p>The general way in which the progress is made</p>
<p>from those early starts in 1968,</p>
<p>all the way through to Deep Blue&rsquo;s victory,</p>
<p>was of the use of heuristic rules</p>
<p>that brought down the number of potential options</p>
<p>to a manageable level.</p>
<p>As computer power increased,</p>
<p>then it could make faster and faster</p>
<p>and wiser and wiser decisions,</p>
<p>and make them at a rate which no human,</p>
<p>even the best human, could keep up with.</p>
<p>So that was the general way in which the debate went.</p>
<p>But things got more interesting after this,</p>
<p>with the advent of computers that, as you pointed out,</p>
<p>make use of so called machine learning.</p>
<p>There were, a company put out a program, AlphaZero,</p>
<p>which can look at the basic rule structures of chess,</p>
<p>and then ultimately play itself in trials,</p>
<p>and make trial and error assessment</p>
<p>of what are good and bad strategies,</p>
<p>so that with no human intervention,</p>
<p>a computer could start doing remarkable things.</p>
<p>Not only did this company create AlphaZero,</p>
<p>and there were some other ones too,</p>
<p>they fought not only in chess,</p>
<p>but in the much more complex Asian game of Go,</p>
<p>which has far more potential options</p>
<p>than chess does, by a very significant margin.</p>
<p>These machine learning programs,</p>
<p>not only easily defeat any human in chess,</p>
<p>but in Go as well.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s truly remarkable</p>
<p>is they weren&rsquo;t just beating them.</p>
<p>When AlphaZero took on a rival chess program,</p>
<p>which by itself was already superior to any human,</p>
<p>it only required four hours,</p>
<p>starting from learning the rules of chess,</p>
<p>to figuring out how to beat</p>
<p>the second most powerful chess program in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally like taking a human,</p>
<p>telling the rules of chess,</p>
<p>they play some games with themselves for four hours,</p>
<p>and they go out and beat Garry Kasparov.</p>
<p>This is, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>this is, to me, this is a truly exciting development,</p>
<p>far beyond even what Deep Blue did.</p>
<p>I like how you said exciting, not terrifying,</p>
<p>because I agree with you on the exciting.</p>
<p>Now, things also get exciting in a different direction.</p>
<p>There is another possibility,</p>
<p>which few people foresaw after the Deep Blue episode.</p>
<p>This is where a new form of chess started to emerge,</p>
<p>sometimes called cyborg chess or centaur chess,</p>
<p>where humans of moderate chess level playing ability,</p>
<p>not world champions, just decent, but not great,</p>
<p>I guess you might say like purple belts in jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>allied themselves with computers.</p>
<p>So the humans and computers worked as a cyborg team.</p>
<p>The humans supplied the heuristic insight.</p>
<p>The computers supplied the computational power.</p>
<p>And fascinatingly, they proved to be superior</p>
<p>to both the best humans and the best chess programs.</p>
<p>The united force of human insight with heuristics,</p>
<p>with computers ability to go through numbers</p>
<p>in far more rapid form than any human could ever hope to do,</p>
<p>proved to be one of the strongest combinations</p>
<p>and enabled that pairing of human and computer</p>
<p>to overwhelm both the best single human</p>
<p>and the best single computer.</p>
<p>That adds a whole new level of fascination to this topic.</p>
<p>So to wind things up here,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got this fascinating initial question from Lex,</p>
<p>the idea of could there be a computer inside a robot</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t have any special physical properties?</p>
<p>This is mind versus mind</p>
<p>because the bodies negate each other.</p>
<p>The robot is the same body as Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>This is a thought experiment.</p>
<p>What would it take to create a mind</p>
<p>that would defeat the mind of Gordon Ryan?</p>
<p>Based on the chess example,</p>
<p>it would appear that this is entirely feasible</p>
<p>at some point in the future.</p>
<p>And in fact, I would go further and say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually quite likely</p>
<p>based on what we&rsquo;ve seen from the example of chess.</p>
<p>The rate of progress in AI in the last 20 years</p>
<p>has dwarfed anything from the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>And the rate continues to increase.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking now at a level where the machine learning</p>
<p>of defeating world champions in chess and Go in four hours,</p>
<p>like just from starting from the rules of the sport,</p>
<p>this is gonna be difficult for humans to keep up with.</p>
<p>Now in humans favor, could we take Gordon Ryan</p>
<p>and put a chip inside his brain</p>
<p>that created the same cyborg effect</p>
<p>as we saw in centaur chess and cyborg chess,</p>
<p>and then take Gordon Ryan to a new level</p>
<p>and suddenly his computational powers</p>
<p>were massively increased.</p>
<p>He still has his heuristic insight,</p>
<p>but he has vastly augmented computational powers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the interesting battle.</p>
<p>You asked a great question, Lex.</p>
<p>Let me give you my initial push for an answer</p>
<p>would be that if it&rsquo;s just Gordon Ryan</p>
<p>versus your robot technology,</p>
<p>in 10 years, I would say with machine learning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say you guys win every time.</p>
<p>But if it is cyborg Gordon Ryan,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s part Gordon Ryan with heuristics</p>
<p>and part machine, then, and now that&rsquo;s where I throw</p>
<p>the question back at you, young man, what do you think?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m fascinated to hear your answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting because there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of different ways you can build a cyborg Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>So one is there&rsquo;s the Neuralink way,</p>
<p>which is basically doing what you&rsquo;re suggesting,</p>
<p>which is expanding the computational capabilities</p>
<p>of Gordon Ryan&rsquo;s brain,</p>
<p>like directly being able to communicate</p>
<p>between a computer and the brain.</p>
<p>So you preserve most of what there is in the human body,</p>
<p>including the nervous system and the computing system</p>
<p>we currently have that&rsquo;s biological</p>
<p>and expanding over the computer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also on the cyborg chess front,</p>
<p>like Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion in chess,</p>
<p>he studies AlphaZero games.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not a regular thing for high level grandmasters.</p>
<p>From what I understand, almost every chess master</p>
<p>now studies computer games for inspiration.</p>
<p>Like just as great chess players from the past</p>
<p>used to go back into old leather bound books</p>
<p>of previous grandmasters and study games and books.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most people, when they wanna study</p>
<p>the most perfect games,</p>
<p>they actually study programs like AlphaZero.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not just for inspiration, it&rsquo;s education.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s literally part of their training regimen.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t like a fun side thing.</p>
<p>This is the main way to get better.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain element there</p>
<p>where even our human brains can be trained</p>
<p>by observing the partial explorations</p>
<p>of an AI systems in the space of grappling.</p>
<p>That could be actually in simulation.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be in the physical world.</p>
<p>It could be in, if we construct sufficiently good</p>
<p>biomechanical models of human beings,</p>
<p>machines can learn how they grapple.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a bit of that already.</p>
<p>OpenAI has the system of, they&rsquo;re like sumo wrestlers</p>
<p>with some basic goals of pushing each other off of a platform.</p>
<p>And you know nothing from the, you don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>So you have a basic model of a bipedal system.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even know in the beginning how to stand up.</p>
<p>It just falls, right?</p>
<p>So it has to learn how to get up</p>
<p>and they do that through self play.</p>
<p>They learn how to get up, they learn how to move</p>
<p>enough to achieve the final goal</p>
<p>which is to push your opponent off of the thing.</p>
<p>So they learn that.</p>
<p>Now OpenAI is not, those folks are currently</p>
<p>not that interested in the grappling world.</p>
<p>So they kind of stop there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very possible in simulation to then develop ideas.</p>
<p>In fact, this is something that I should probably do,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty natural to do it easy,</p>
<p>is ideas of control and submission and all the,</p>
<p>you add the ability to, I don&rsquo;t know how to put it nicely,</p>
<p>but to choke your opponent</p>
<p>and to break their body parts off,</p>
<p>which is what jiu jitsu is.</p>
<p>Add that in and what kind of ideas it&rsquo;ll come up with</p>
<p>is very fascinating.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know, until this conversation,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I never even thought about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very obsessed with just like walking</p>
<p>and running and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>like evolving different strategies</p>
<p>for when you have a bunch of,</p>
<p>so one difficult thing for robots</p>
<p>is when you have uneven terrain</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s uncertainty about the terrain</p>
<p>is how to keep walking.</p>
<p>Or when there&rsquo;s a bunch of things being thrown at you,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>and you learn through self play</p>
<p>how to be able to navigate those uncertain environments</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a lot of weird objects</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t just do that</p>
<p>with submissions and so on in simulation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be actually fascinating.</p>
<p>But once we might be surprised</p>
<p>by the kind of strategies in simulation</p>
<p>these AI systems will develop,</p>
<p>and that might make a much better Gordon Ryan</p>
<p>and much better John Donahar</p>
<p>in asking the Dean Lister question of like,</p>
<p>why are we only using,</p>
<p>why are we not doing X?</p>
<p>But on the actual sort of grappling event</p>
<p>in the physical space,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very surprised and a little bit disappointed</p>
<p>by how difficult it&rsquo;s to build</p>
<p>a system that&rsquo;s able to have the body of Gordon Ryan</p>
<p>or a human being actually,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s not just the biomechanics</p>
<p>which is very difficult to do,</p>
<p>but also all of the senses that are involved.</p>
<p>Be able to perceive the world as richly,</p>
<p>to be able to, there&rsquo;s something called soft robotics,</p>
<p>which is incredibly difficult to do through touch,</p>
<p>understand the hardness of things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand as human beings</p>
<p>just how much we&rsquo;re able through touch</p>
<p>to experience the world and to manipulate the world.</p>
<p>Like the process of picking up a cup</p>
<p>is very similar to the process of grappling.</p>
<p>All the feeling that you do,</p>
<p>all the leverage that you&rsquo;re applying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many degrees of freedom</p>
<p>in both the, in the interactive sense,</p>
<p>in the sensing and the applying,</p>
<p>sensing and applying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that through so much of your body,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just going to be very difficult</p>
<p>to build a system that&rsquo;s able to experience the world</p>
<p>and act onto the world as richly as we humans can.</p>
<p>Yeah, if picking up a cup</p>
<p>is a seemingly insurmountable challenge,</p>
<p>then taking someone down, controlling them,</p>
<p>getting past their legs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be one hell of a project.</p>
<p>Exactly, I mean, there could be shortcuts,</p>
<p>but I mean, currently that&rsquo;s the field</p>
<p>called robotic manipulation, which is picking up objects.</p>
<p>Usually they have like a ball and a triangular object</p>
<p>and your whole task is to like pick it up</p>
<p>and move it around.</p>
<p>Generalizing that to the human body is harder,</p>
<p>but perhaps not as hard as we might think.</p>
<p>The question is, how do you construct experiments</p>
<p>where you can do that safely?</p>
<p>In chess, that&rsquo;s very easy,</p>
<p>but here it&rsquo;s very, very problematic.</p>
<p>I guess you could just have robot versus robot</p>
<p>teamed up with each other and then they learn</p>
<p>and then they go out to take on a human opponent.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, so you have two physical robots</p>
<p>that interact with each other.</p>
<p>Everything you&rsquo;ve said so far suggests</p>
<p>that many of the problems, these tactile elements,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re easy tasks for humans.</p>
<p>So which becomes more powerful more quickly?</p>
<p>Robots that are taught to think like humans</p>
<p>or humans that are given the computational power</p>
<p>of computers and robots themselves,</p>
<p>which wins first, a cyborg Gordon Ryan</p>
<p>or an artificial robot Gordon Ryan?</p>
<p>Really, really strong question,</p>
<p>and I think by far the cyborg Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking here.</p>
<p>The problems you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>with regards to the robots, those are deep problems.</p>
<p>Like if picking up a cup is problematic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be damn difficult,</p>
<p>but to a human, a two year old can do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re highlighting a very important difference</p>
<p>is human beings have something called common sense</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know how to build into computers currently.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what picking up the cup is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some basic rules about the way this world works.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re able to, this is when we&rsquo;re children</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll crawl around and we pick up.</p>
<p>What humans don&rsquo;t have that machines have</p>
<p>is incredible computational power</p>
<p>and access to infinite knowledge.</p>
<p>Computers can do that.</p>
<p>So if you have a Gordon Ryan with the infinite knowledge</p>
<p>and compute power, that&rsquo;s just going to,</p>
<p>because we know how to do that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to blow out of the water</p>
<p>a robot that&rsquo;s trying to learn to crawl.</p>
<p>Has there been any update on the phenomenon</p>
<p>of cyborg or centaur chess?</p>
<p>There was some debate as to whether or not</p>
<p>cyborg chess teams could stay competitive</p>
<p>with the latest machine learning.</p>
<p>Has there been any update on that?</p>
<p>I believe at this point machines dominate</p>
<p>over the machine human pairs.</p>
<p>With the human pairs, when they first came out,</p>
<p>they were good chess players, but not great chess players.</p>
<p>Does it make any difference if you have, say,</p>
<p>Garry Kasparov and a computer working in unison</p>
<p>versus Joe Blow from?</p>
<p>It does make a huge difference,</p>
<p>but yeah, both are destroyed by machines at this point.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even competitive now?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not competitive.</p>
<p>But they also lost interest in this kind of idea.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s still competitions</p>
<p>between human machine pairs versus human machine pairs,</p>
<p>almost like to see how the two work together.</p>
<p>But in terms of machine versus human machine pair,</p>
<p>machines still dominate.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So, and now we&rsquo;ve retrieved back as human beings</p>
<p>caring mostly about human versus human competitions,</p>
<p>which is probably what the future will look like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting to think,</p>
<p>but like that in chess happened really quickly.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t happen, and it wasn&rsquo;t so painful in chess</p>
<p>because we care about chess,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not so fundamental to human society.</p>
<p>And when you started talking about cyborg Gordon Ryans,</p>
<p>which really beyond grappling is referring</p>
<p>to robots operating physical space</p>
<p>or human robot hybrids operating physical space,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about our society is now full of cyborgs.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that transition might be very painful</p>
<p>or transformative in a way we can&rsquo;t even predict.</p>
<p>And that very much has applications</p>
<p>as both China and US now have legalized</p>
<p>is autonomous weapon systems.</p>
<p>So use of these kinds of systems in military applications.</p>
<p>So it used to be, there&rsquo;d been a big call</p>
<p>in the AI community to ban autonomous weapons.</p>
<p>So the use of artificial intelligence in war,</p>
<p>just like bioweapons are banned internationally.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not allowed to use bioweapons in war.</p>
<p>And actually most people, even terrorists,</p>
<p>have kind of agreed on this ban.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, there&rsquo;s been a quiet agreement,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re not going to be doing this</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s gonna get really pissed off.</p>
<p>With autonomous weapon systems, that&rsquo;s not been the case.</p>
<p>China has said that they&rsquo;re going to be using AI</p>
<p>in their military.</p>
<p>And the US in 2021 just released a report</p>
<p>saying that they&rsquo;re going to add</p>
<p>increasing amounts of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>into our military systems.</p>
<p>Into drones, into just everything that&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>any kind of both strategic and actual bombing</p>
<p>and defense systems.</p>
<p>I presume a drone army would easily defeat</p>
<p>a human army in the near future.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, just off the top of my head,</p>
<p>just think about the implication of kamikaze drones</p>
<p>versus a naval fleet.</p>
<p>I mean, kamikazes was humans in World War II,</p>
<p>did terrible damage to our navy.</p>
<p>Imagine swarms of mechanical kamikazes</p>
<p>which have no fear, no remorse, I mean.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very inefficient.</p>
<p>Kamikaze is very inefficient.</p>
<p>You want to be very, like war is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same discussion to jiu jitsu, right?</p>
<p>You want to be, you want to create an asymmetry of power</p>
<p>and you want to be efficient is in the way you deliver</p>
<p>that power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually goes back to the picking up a cup.</p>
<p>Currently, a lot of things we do in war,</p>
<p>like most of the drones that you hear about,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not autonomous, not most, all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually piloted by.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re piloted remotely by humans.</p>
<p>And humans are really good at this kind of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s necessary to deliver the most damage,</p>
<p>targeted damage, effective as part of the largest strategy</p>
<p>you have about bombing the area or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how difficult that is to automate.</p>
<p>I think the biggest concern,</p>
<p>I actually have a sense that it&rsquo;s very difficult to automate.</p>
<p>The biggest concern is almost like</p>
<p>an incompetent application of this</p>
<p>and consequences that are not anticipated.</p>
<p>So you have a drone army where you say,</p>
<p>we want to target,</p>
<p>you give it power to target a particular terrorist.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some bug in the system</p>
<p>that has a, like for example,</p>
<p>has a large uncertainty about the location of that terrorist.</p>
<p>And so it decides to bomb an entire city.</p>
<p>You know, almost like there&rsquo;s a bug, a software bug.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more concerned about like bad programming</p>
<p>and software engineering than I am about</p>
<p>like malevolent AI systems that destroy the world.</p>
<p>So the more we rely on automation,</p>
<p>this is the lesson of human history.</p>
<p>The more we give to AI, to software, to robotic systems,</p>
<p>the more we forget how to supervise</p>
<p>and oversee some of the edge cases,</p>
<p>all the weird ways that things go wrong.</p>
<p>And then the more stupid software bugs</p>
<p>can lead to huge damage.</p>
<p>Like, you know, even like nuclear explosions,</p>
<p>those kinds of things.</p>
<p>If we add AI into the launch systems</p>
<p>for nuclear weapons, for example,</p>
<p>I think human history teaches us that software bugs</p>
<p>is what will lead to World War III,</p>
<p>not malevolent AI or human beings.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>By the way, I deeply appreciate how knowledgeable you are</p>
<p>about the history of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>
<p>Oh no, it&rsquo;s fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>You know, I remember reading when I was a child</p>
<p>about, you know, Turing tests and things like this,</p>
<p>and visionaries from the 1950s had ideas.</p>
<p>To see it come this far is just so fascinating to me.</p>
<p>Okay, so what can we as jiu jitsu players</p>
<p>take away from this?</p>
<p>We saw that when it comes to computers versus humans</p>
<p>in chess tournaments,</p>
<p>humans had something truly valuable</p>
<p>to give to the computers.</p>
<p>That was heuristic rules.</p>
<p>In every coaching program that I run,</p>
<p>I make an endless quest to search out</p>
<p>and find effective heuristic rules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basis of a good training program.</p>
<p>Heuristic rules and principles</p>
<p>give vast informational content,</p>
<p>which can rapidly increase your performance on the mat,</p>
<p>just as they rapidly increase the performance</p>
<p>of chess computers to overcome their human adversaries.</p>
<p>The great human weakness is computational power.</p>
<p>Most people vastly overestimate their ability</p>
<p>to reason and problem solve under stress.</p>
<p>In fact, numerous psychological studies have shown</p>
<p>that humans can balance a relatively small number</p>
<p>of competing options in stressful decision making.</p>
<p>But what we do have,</p>
<p>what is the great and unique human gift</p>
<p>is this idea to come up and arrive</p>
<p>at heuristic rules and principles,</p>
<p>which turn out to be very effective guides to behavior</p>
<p>for both human behavior</p>
<p>and artificially intelligent behavior.</p>
<p>Make that your focus in study.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to remember 10,000 different details on a move.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s human weakness, not human strength.</p>
<p>Our strength is heuristics.</p>
<p>Make that your focus,</p>
<p>not endless computations over 25 details here</p>
<p>merged with 27 details here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what humans are good at.</p>
<p>The uniquely human strength is arriving</p>
<p>at these heuristic rules and principles</p>
<p>which guide our behavior,</p>
<p>which provides simplifications,</p>
<p>which enable us to take vast amounts of information</p>
<p>and parry it down to a few simple rules</p>
<p>that effectively guide our behavior.</p>
<p>Take that core insight from the discussion</p>
<p>that Lex and I just had.</p>
<p>It was a complex discussion.</p>
<p>We both apologize for going a little bit overboard.</p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>
<p>Then dragging you into some details there,</p>
<p>but take that away from it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make you better at jujitsu.</p>
<p>Sorry, Lex.</p>
<p>That was a really exciting discussion,</p>
<p>and the depths of knowledge</p>
<p>in the dimensions of knowledge you have</p>
<p>and interests you have is just fascinating.</p>
<p>Is there advice you have for complete beginners,</p>
<p>for white belts that are starting jujitsu,</p>
<p>that are listening to this,</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t done jujitsu?</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who are super curious to start.</p>
<p>Is there advice you would give them on their journey?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m just gonna talk about</p>
<p>just getting better on the mat, okay?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a thousand other things</p>
<p>you can talk about in terms of morale and persistence</p>
<p>and how often that you&rsquo;re trained</p>
<p>is a thousand things you&rsquo;d give.</p>
<p>Break up with your girlfriend or boyfriend.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put that aside.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the best advice we could give.</p>
<p>It goes back to what we said earlier.</p>
<p>I always advocate start your training from the ground up.</p>
<p>Okay, your first sessions in jujitsu,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find to your horror</p>
<p>that everyone gets on top of you and you can&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a dispiriting, crushing kind of feeling</p>
<p>that you just have no skills</p>
<p>and you have no prospects in the sport.</p>
<p>So your first skill is the skill of being able</p>
<p>to free yourself from positional pins.</p>
<p>Most of the escapes in jujitsu go to guard position.</p>
<p>And so once you get someone in your guard,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be looking to pass your guard</p>
<p>and get back into those positional pins</p>
<p>that you just escaped from.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just as crushing as getting pinned.</p>
<p>You feel like every time you try to hold someone in guard,</p>
<p>they just effortlessly pass you by.</p>
<p>So your first two skills,</p>
<p>you got to be able to get out of any pin</p>
<p>and you got to be able to hold someone in your guard.</p>
<p>So pin escapes and guard retention</p>
<p>are your first two skills.</p>
<p>I generally advocate the idea of learning to fight</p>
<p>from your back first and then learning to fight</p>
<p>from on top second.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the brute fact is when you first start off,</p>
<p>you just don&rsquo;t have enough skills to hold top position</p>
<p>or gain top position through a takedown.</p>
<p>So inevitably you&rsquo;re going to end up underneath people</p>
<p>for most of your training time.</p>
<p>Your training should reflect that in the early days</p>
<p>as a white belt.</p>
<p>Start with the first two skills you need.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the most exciting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not sexy skills that are going to make you look</p>
<p>like a stud in the training room,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re going to keep your life long enough</p>
<p>to learn those sexy skills in the future</p>
<p>that will make you look like a stud.</p>
<p>Start with pin escapes, go to guard retention</p>
<p>and focus heavily on those two.</p>
<p>When you start to get into offense,</p>
<p>start with bottom position.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a clear continuity between your pin escapes,</p>
<p>your guard retention, and then your guard itself.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got different options with guard.</p>
<p>Some of you are going to like closed guard.</p>
<p>Some of you are going to like variations of open guard.</p>
<p>Some of you are going to like to be seated.</p>
<p>Some of you are going to like to be supine.</p>
<p>Some of you are going to like half guard.</p>
<p>As a general rule, this is a heavy generalization,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to give it to you.</p>
<p>In my experience, most people benefit the most</p>
<p>by starting with half guard first.</p>
<p>I know that traditionally Jiu Jitsu has been taught</p>
<p>closed guard first,</p>
<p>and then all the other guards come after that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in the idea of start with pin escapes,</p>
<p>then go to guard retention,</p>
<p>and then start with half guard bottom.</p>
<p>That way you get a nice continuity</p>
<p>between your first three skills,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll make good progress</p>
<p>over those first critical six months in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>What does it take to get a black belt in Jiu Jitsu?</p>
<p>Very little.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha.</p>
<p>To show up, pay your fees.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t set your goals low, okay?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even ask yourself that question.</p>
<p>No one cares if you&rsquo;ve got a black belt, okay?</p>
<p>The only thing that counts is the skills you have.</p>
<p>I know plenty of black belts that suck, okay?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of them out there.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lower your standards by saying,</p>
<p>I want to get a black belt.</p>
<p>Ask yourself something much more important.</p>
<p>How good do I want to be?</p>
<p>You want to be damn good, right?</p>
<p>You want to do something in this time,</p>
<p>and you want to be the best you can.</p>
<p>Wearing a belt around your waist doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that.</p>
<p>Build skills, focus on that.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the fourth thing</p>
<p>in facet face of Jiu Jitsu, which is self defense.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the bigger things,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s called self defense.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it street fighting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it fighting, okay?</p>
<p>Maybe you can contest that terminology.</p>
<p>How about non sport fighting?</p>
<p>Non sport fighting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, like street fighting.</p>
<p>What happens if you go out on a playground,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fighting on grass?</p>
<p>Is there no longer street fighting?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like tennis.</p>
<p>You have like Wimbledon, like grass courts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a whole nother thing.</p>
<p>What do you think is the best martial art</p>
<p>for street fighting?</p>
<p>What is the best set of,</p>
<p>we talked about advice for white belts</p>
<p>to advance in grappling in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>What is the set of techniques,</p>
<p>maybe martial art that is best for street fighting?</p>
<p>Okay, again, you&rsquo;re asking some</p>
<p>truly fascinating questions here.</p>
<p>The way this gets framed as a question</p>
<p>is often condemns you to bad answers from the start.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>As a questioner, I&rsquo;m trying to achieve asymmetry of power.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m winning.</p>
<p>Put you in a bad position.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry so much about&hellip;</p>
<p>People are always gonna say,</p>
<p>you know, is this martial art better?</p>
<p>Or is this martial arts better?</p>
<p>The truth is there&rsquo;s only one way to say this.</p>
<p>Combat sports are your best option for self defense.</p>
<p>There are many martial arts,</p>
<p>and there is a rough divide between the two.</p>
<p>Those that fall into combat sports,</p>
<p>and those that fall into non sporting martial arts,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no competitive live sparring element,</p>
<p>where most of the knowledge is limited</p>
<p>to theoretical knowledge reinforced by passive drilling.</p>
<p>If you have a choice between a combat sport</p>
<p>versus a non sporting art</p>
<p>based around theoretical knowledge and passive drilling,</p>
<p>go with a combat sport.</p>
<p>Nothing will prepare you for the intensity</p>
<p>of a genuine altercation better than combat sports.</p>
<p>Many people, as I say these words,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably horrified to hear me say this,</p>
<p>and immediately going to rebut and say,</p>
<p>no, combat sports is exactly the wrong thing for you to do</p>
<p>because they have safety rules, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>which would easily be exploited in a real fight.</p>
<p>And if I fought a world championship boxer,</p>
<p>I would just poke him in the eye</p>
<p>or kick him in the groin, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard these arguments a thousand times.</p>
<p>Yes, there is some validity to these things,</p>
<p>but as a general rule,</p>
<p>if you ask me to bet in any form of street fight,</p>
<p>call it what you want,</p>
<p>between a combat sport adherent</p>
<p>versus someone who simply trains with drills</p>
<p>and talks in terms of theories</p>
<p>of what they would do in a fight,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go with the combat sport guy every single time.</p>
<p>Now, having said that,</p>
<p>combat sports need to be modified</p>
<p>for the use of self defense street fighting.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t agreed on a term yet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll figure it out later.</p>
<p>What does this modification consist of?</p>
<p>Well, some of it is technical, okay?</p>
<p>For example, a boxer in a street fight</p>
<p>now has to punch without wrapped or gloved hands,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s problematic, okay?</p>
<p>Your hands are not really designed</p>
<p>for heavy extended use of clubbing hard objects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very high likelihood of breaking your hands.</p>
<p>Mike Tyson was one of the finest punchers that ever lived,</p>
<p>but in one of his more famous street fights</p>
<p>against Mitch Green in the late 1980s,</p>
<p>he broke his hand with one punch</p>
<p>that he threw at his opponent.</p>
<p>He hit the wrong part of the head and broke his hand,</p>
<p>and he was one of the most gifted punchers of all time.</p>
<p>If he can do it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll certainly have trouble protecting your hands</p>
<p>when you go to throw blows.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this was easily modified,</p>
<p>and so a boxer can throw with open hands or with elbows,</p>
<p>and so just a small modification and technique</p>
<p>can overcome that problem.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ll find is that the general physical,</p>
<p>mental conditioning, and skill development</p>
<p>that comes from combat sports</p>
<p>allied with technical modifications,</p>
<p>and then the most important of all,</p>
<p>tactical modifications will provide your best hope</p>
<p>in altercations outside of sports in the street</p>
<p>or wherever you find yourself.</p>
<p>The least effective approaches to self defense</p>
<p>that I have observed in my life</p>
<p>have been those where, as I said,</p>
<p>people talked theory, drilled on passive opponents,</p>
<p>and generally had no engagement in live competition</p>
<p>or sparring in their training programs.</p>
<p>The most effective by a landslide</p>
<p>were those that put a heavy emphasis on live sparring</p>
<p>and sporting competition modified both technically</p>
<p>and tactically for the circumstances</p>
<p>in which they found themselves.</p>
<p>People talk, for example, about how, you know,</p>
<p>and with some validity that weapons</p>
<p>will change everything in a street fight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolute truth to that,</p>
<p>but this extends into weapons as well, okay?</p>
<p>The most effective forms of knife fighting that you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>will be those who come from a background in fencing</p>
<p>because it has sparring and a competitive sport aspect to it,</p>
<p>but would pure fencing be the appropriate thing?</p>
<p>Of course not, you&rsquo;d have to modify it,</p>
<p>but the reflexes, endurance, physical mobility</p>
<p>that you gain from the sport of fencing</p>
<p>could easily be modified to bladecraft in a fight situation.</p>
<p>What you want to look for with regards street</p>
<p>and self defense is not, okay, which style should I choose?</p>
<p>Should I choose taekwondo?</p>
<p>Should I choose karate?</p>
<p>Should I choose this variation of kung fu?</p>
<p>No, focus on the most important thing.</p>
<p>Does it have a sport aspect to it?</p>
<p>Then once you&rsquo;ve made sufficient progress</p>
<p>in the sport aspect of that martial art,</p>
<p>start asking yourself, what are the requisite modifications</p>
<p>and technique and tactics that I have to use</p>
<p>or to input to make it effective for street situations?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the advice that I give.</p>
<p>Let me zoom in on a very particular aspect</p>
<p>of street fighting where, with all due respect,</p>
<p>I disagree with Mr. Joe Rogan and George St. Pierre on,</p>
<p>which is the suit and tie situation.</p>
<p>Now, to criticize GSP, yeah, yeah,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very accomplished and everything,</p>
<p>but to criticize him for a bit,</p>
<p>he made claims about how dangerous the tie is</p>
<p>in a street fighting situation</p>
<p>without ever having used it in a fighting situation.</p>
<p>So he made sort of broad proclamations</p>
<p>without understanding the fundamentals.</p>
<p>So I thought I would go to somebody who thinks in systems.</p>
<p>What do you think, is it dangerous to wear a tie</p>
<p>or not in a grappling situation</p>
<p>versus all the other weapons?</p>
<p>Yeah, but we would do it in a street fight, yeah.</p>
<p>It would be rather strange to wear a tie</p>
<p>in a grappling competition.</p>
<p>It would be, it would be.</p>
<p>Yes, in a street fight situation.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan thinks it is like the most dangerous,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it becomes your weakest point</p>
<p>if you wear a tie because it&rsquo;s very easy to choke.</p>
<p>George St. Pierre seemed to have agreed with that.</p>
<p>Also, George added that you can grab the tie</p>
<p>and pull the person down to a knee.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the go to.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan will go for the choke,</p>
<p>George St. Pierre will go for the tie to the knee,</p>
<p>which I was saying is ridiculous.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>Okay, first off, I actually can speak with experience</p>
<p>on this because I worked as a bouncer for over a decade</p>
<p>and most of the clubs I worked at</p>
<p>did not require a suit and tie,</p>
<p>but occasionally they did.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s first differentiate</p>
<p>between the kinds of threats when you wear a tie.</p>
<p>If you wear a tie, if there is gonna be a threat,</p>
<p>by far the more important threat is not strangulation.</p>
<p>Okay, being strangled by your tie is possible,</p>
<p>but it is a poor choice.</p>
<p>There are many other ways to strangle people</p>
<p>that are far more efficient.</p>
<p>If I strangle by your tie, I&rsquo;m literally in front of you.</p>
<p>That means as I go to apply the strangle hold,</p>
<p>I can easily be eye gouged, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna strangle people in the street,</p>
<p>do it from behind and there&rsquo;s just much better ways</p>
<p>to do it than that.</p>
<p>Hear that, Joe Rogan?</p>
<p>With regards to the snap down question,</p>
<p>that is more a problem.</p>
<p>I always recommend if you are going to work as a bouncer</p>
<p>with a tie, wear a clip on tie</p>
<p>so it just comes off immediately.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like clip ons, then you can use a bow tie.</p>
<p>I used to work for years in hip hop clubs</p>
<p>with members of the Nation of Islam security team.</p>
<p>They were known, they had various factions,</p>
<p>but the one I worked with were the X Men,</p>
<p>and they would always wear bow ties,</p>
<p>which of course can&rsquo;t be grabbed.</p>
<p>Now, the bow tie was a recognizable part of their brand</p>
<p>as security guards, so everyone knew</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what they wore.</p>
<p>If I wore a bow tie in a security situation,</p>
<p>people would probably think that I was some kind</p>
<p>of Nancy boy and want to fight with me,</p>
<p>so I couldn&rsquo;t wear one.</p>
<p>So I would always wear a tie</p>
<p>which you should become familiar with, Mr. Freeman.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Texas bolo tie, which is a kind of shoestring tie</p>
<p>which is very, very thin, almost like shoestring</p>
<p>and rather short and just has a simple pendant in the middle.</p>
<p>This is perfect if you need to wear a tie</p>
<p>in a situation where you believe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a high likelihood of you being grabbed.</p>
<p>Because it can&rsquo;t be grabbed.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s nothing to grab.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally like string.</p>
<p>Like if you pulled it,</p>
<p>it would just slip through your hand.</p>
<p>That tie that you&rsquo;re wearing now,</p>
<p>that would give me tremendous control of your head,</p>
<p>and I could easily turn it into a hockey fight situation</p>
<p>where your head was being pulled down out of balance,</p>
<p>and you would have a hard time recovering.</p>
<p>So strangulation, not really a problem.</p>
<p>Getting pulled down, possible problem.</p>
<p>Solutions, clip on tie, bow tie,</p>
<p>or if you don&rsquo;t want to look like a Nancy boy,</p>
<p>wear a bolo tie.</p>
<p>Beautiful, so you disagree with Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>agree with George St. Pierre, I love it.</p>
<p>I feel like this is an instruction we put together</p>
<p>here on street fighting and the tie.</p>
<p>Speaking of Joe Rogan, let me ask the following question.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s currently doing a podcast with Gordon Ryan,</p>
<p>and probably going to try to convince him and you,</p>
<p>as he&rsquo;s already been doing, to move to Austin.</p>
<p>What are the chances of the Donoher Death Squad</p>
<p>coming to Austin and opening a school in Austin</p>
<p>and making Austin home so I can attend the classes there?</p>
<p>I would definitely have to think about that.</p>
<p>I do know that I personally love New York,</p>
<p>but every single person in the squad despised New York</p>
<p>and wanted to leave for a long time.</p>
<p>What was the nature of your love for New York, by the way?</p>
<p>It was truly an international city.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in the idea of breadth of experience,</p>
<p>and if you want, breadth of experience</p>
<p>usually requires extensive travel,</p>
<p>but training people means you have to be in a fixed location</p>
<p>working according to a schedule,</p>
<p>and those two push in different directions.</p>
<p>New York was the compromise</p>
<p>where everyone from around the world came there</p>
<p>so you had breadth of experience of world culture,</p>
<p>but at the same time, you had a fixed location</p>
<p>so you could run a training program</p>
<p>that produced world champions,</p>
<p>so it was the ideal compromise.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating thing to teach classes</p>
<p>of over 120 people where literally the entire world</p>
<p>was represented on the map</p>
<p>and go outside and see the same thing.</p>
<p>It was truly the world&rsquo;s leading international city.</p>
<p>It was like the world&rsquo;s unofficial capital,</p>
<p>a fascinating place to live,</p>
<p>so I loved it, but the squad hated it.</p>
<p>For them, it was like an expensive thing.</p>
<p>They never actually lived in Manhattan.</p>
<p>They always lived in New Jersey or Long Island,</p>
<p>had to commute in,</p>
<p>so all they ever saw was the bridges and the tunnels,</p>
<p>the expensive daily parking fees.</p>
<p>They only saw the worst of New York,</p>
<p>and despite my pleas for them to move into Manhattan,</p>
<p>they never did, and so they hated it</p>
<p>because when all you see of New York</p>
<p>is the bridges and the tunnels</p>
<p>and the parking garage, that&rsquo;s not a pleasant thing,</p>
<p>so I understand where they&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>so then when COVID broke out,</p>
<p>they wanted to move to Puerto Rico and work there.</p>
<p>Now, Puerto Rico is a beautiful alternative to New York.</p>
<p>In many ways, it has many advantages over New York.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s physically beautiful.</p>
<p>The people are wonderful,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a wonderful place to spend time.</p>
<p>Freedom, low taxes, all those kinds of things</p>
<p>that Puerto Rico stands for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Texas, on the other hand.</p>
<p>I know everyone in the squad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a compromise, right?</p>
<p>Texas is a compromise between those two.</p>
<p>Actually, I must say that everyone on the squad,</p>
<p>myself included, loves Texas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about that.</p>
<p>I know Gordon loves it, Gary, Craig, Nicky,</p>
<p>everyone who comes here just loves Texas.</p>
<p>That is incontestable.</p>
<p>Of course, in Texas, there&rsquo;s many great cities.</p>
<p>Austin has always been one of my favorites.</p>
<p>I love Dallas, I love Austin,</p>
<p>and it has the advantages of better infrastructure</p>
<p>as a place to train.</p>
<p>It has a much higher population density</p>
<p>so that you could get a larger number</p>
<p>of prospective students and form a larger squad.</p>
<p>It would definitely be a fantastic place to open up a gym.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t give an answer off the top of my head.</p>
<p>It would be a big move if we did make that move,</p>
<p>but the basic idea would be very agreeable</p>
<p>to everyone on the team, I will say that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll just have to call on my Russian connections</p>
<p>to threaten the right kind of people,</p>
<p>and I definitely would love,</p>
<p>the way you approach training,</p>
<p>the way you approach the martial arts</p>
<p>is something that I deeply admire</p>
<p>as a scholar of these arts,</p>
<p>so it would be amazing if you do come here,</p>
<p>but either way, it&rsquo;d be amazing to train together.</p>
<p>Let me ask a big, ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>We talked about at the beginning of the conversation</p>
<p>about death and the fear of it.</p>
<p>The other big question we ask about life is its meaning.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a meaning to our existence here</p>
<p>on this little spinning ball?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ve thrown some powerful questions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most powerful.</p>
<p>For most of human existence,</p>
<p>the meaning of life was very, very simple, survival.</p>
<p>The only thing that humans cared about was just surviving</p>
<p>because it was so damn difficult</p>
<p>for the early years of human existence on this Earth.</p>
<p>If you look at ourselves as biological agents,</p>
<p>everything about our body is set up for one mission,</p>
<p>and that is survival.</p>
<p>Every reflex we have, every element of our structure</p>
<p>is just built up on the battle to survive.</p>
<p>And then humans did something remarkable.</p>
<p>They elevated themselves through the use of technology</p>
<p>and social structure to the top of the food chain</p>
<p>so that they went from extremely vulnerable.</p>
<p>If you take a naked human being alone</p>
<p>and put them in the Serengeti Plains in Africa,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in some deep shit.</p>
<p>If you look at a human being as a survival organ,</p>
<p>just by itself, naked, they are among the most feeble</p>
<p>at that task in the entire animal kingdom.</p>
<p>You compare us with predatory animals.</p>
<p>We are weak and soft and easily killed.</p>
<p>But if you take that same human and put them in the Serengeti</p>
<p>human and put them in a group,</p>
<p>and you give them basic technology,</p>
<p>steel, a spear, a knife,</p>
<p>he goes from the bottom of the food chain</p>
<p>to pretty much at the top.</p>
<p>And so humanity found itself in a crisis</p>
<p>that emerged out of its own success.</p>
<p>For most of its history, their only interest</p>
<p>was the battle to survive, and they did it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how they did it, but they did it.</p>
<p>They got through ice ages, droughts, famines,</p>
<p>disease, everything, and they found a way</p>
<p>to get to the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it all got interesting.</p>
<p>Because an organism whose only interest was in survival</p>
<p>had for the first time in their history</p>
<p>a more or less guaranteed survival.</p>
<p>And so the big question now is, now what?</p>
<p>We survived.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more danger.</p>
<p>The average human being finds himself in a world now</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s almost zero danger from predatory animals,</p>
<p>where getting a meal is the easiest thing ever,</p>
<p>where getting to and from work is not problematic at all,</p>
<p>where the majority of infectious diseases,</p>
<p>medical complaints can be resolved</p>
<p>in a hospital fairly easily.</p>
<p>And so they start casting their mind around,</p>
<p>okay, what do I do now?</p>
<p>And so the minute mankind&rsquo;s existence</p>
<p>became more or less guaranteed,</p>
<p>the problem shift from survival to meaning.</p>
<p>And we found ourselves grappling with a whole new issue</p>
<p>that had never occurred to our ancient forefathers,</p>
<p>but which now becomes one of the centerpieces</p>
<p>of our modern lives.</p>
<p>I mean, when you look at your own life,</p>
<p>when you look back, you think, I did a hell of a good job.</p>
<p>You know, Hunter S. Thompson has this line</p>
<p>that I often think about,</p>
<p>that life should not be a journey to the grave</p>
<p>with the intention of arriving safely</p>
<p>in a pretty and well preserved body,</p>
<p>but rather to skid in roadside in a cloud of smoke,</p>
<p>thoroughly used up, totally worn out,</p>
<p>and loudly proclaiming, wow, what a ride.</p>
<p>Which is the complete opposite of survival.</p>
<p>Well, not complete opposite of survival,</p>
<p>but basically embracing danger, embracing risk,</p>
<p>going big, just living life to the fullest.</p>
<p>So within that context,</p>
<p>what would make you proud of a life well lived?</p>
<p>When you look back, you, John Donahart,</p>
<p>looking back at your life.</p>
<p>First, I will address that question,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s first look at why Hunter Thompson could say that.</p>
<p>Why Hunter Thompson could say that?</p>
<p>Because his life was more or less guaranteed and safe.</p>
<p>If you look at animals in the animal kingdom,</p>
<p>the pattern of their life is very simple.</p>
<p>They take the least risk possible to secure their existence.</p>
<p>Lions are powerful creatures, but when they go hunting,</p>
<p>they typically go for the weakest animals they can kill</p>
<p>in order to eat,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want to take the risk</p>
<p>of injuring themselves, knowing that if they do, they die.</p>
<p>So the brute reality is the only people</p>
<p>who can talk about having casual danger in their lives</p>
<p>are those whose lives are guaranteed.</p>
<p>And a fascinating small tangent,</p>
<p>Hunter Thompson took his own life.</p>
<p>So that seems like a deeply human thing, suicide.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating question in itself.</p>
<p>If you look at the number of suicides per year,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a shocking, shocking statistic</p>
<p>that gets almost no recognition.</p>
<p>And yes, uniquely human.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, very, very few animals, you see,</p>
<p>killing themselves because their whole thing</p>
<p>is just survival.</p>
<p>And that humans paradoxically,</p>
<p>when survival is more or less guaranteed,</p>
<p>are killing themselves in vast numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually linked back to the idea of meaning</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so hard.</p>
<p>It was hard to win the battle for survival,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s 10 times harder to win the battle for meaning.</p>
<p>When I think about it,</p>
<p>first off, I&rsquo;ll say right from the bat,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never going to be an agreed upon sense of meaning.</p>
<p>As I said, there was one thing</p>
<p>that our physical bodies agreed upon</p>
<p>and which is hardwired biologically into us</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s survival.</p>
<p>But once we got to a more or less guaranteed survival,</p>
<p>then all bets were off.</p>
<p>At that point, you just have to start</p>
<p>listing your own criteria</p>
<p>and what one person will describe as a meaningful life,</p>
<p>another person will decry as meaningless or wasted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something terrible about the idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re sitting around waiting for meaning</p>
<p>to show up on our doorstep.</p>
<p>But what I find the best people do</p>
<p>is they take charge of it</p>
<p>and they look at their lives in a form of authorship</p>
<p>where they see their life as a tale to be written</p>
<p>and they do their best to write that tale</p>
<p>and put as much control over the direction of the story</p>
<p>as they can.</p>
<p>In the end, we all have to just try and write our own story.</p>
<p>We all have our own interests.</p>
<p>I try to bring in the sense that even though I&rsquo;m an atheist,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that we go on to live after this.</p>
<p>I believe that there&rsquo;s a possibility of God in an afterlife.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s impossible,</p>
<p>but in order for me to believe that they exist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to see better evidence than I see currently.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I do believe that there is a great value</p>
<p>in the idea of living for something bigger than yourself.</p>
<p>The moment you see yourself as the be all</p>
<p>and end all of your existence,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in for a meaningless life</p>
<p>and nothing will ever satisfy you.</p>
<p>You can have all the money in the world.</p>
<p>You can have all the power in the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be empty inside.</p>
<p>I do believe that humans have a deep and abiding need</p>
<p>to follow the interests of a group</p>
<p>bigger than themselves as an individual.</p>
<p>Is it ideal?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is it an answer to the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Nope, because eventually that group will itself die out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense in which it just plays</p>
<p>a kind of delaying game.</p>
<p>But I do believe that in order to live a happy life,</p>
<p>meaning is a central part of that.</p>
<p>And the deepest sense of meaning,</p>
<p>not a fully complete answer, but a better answer</p>
<p>than most people give is to find something</p>
<p>which hopefully does very little harm</p>
<p>to the people around you and mostly benefits them,</p>
<p>which enables you to become part of a community</p>
<p>and to live, as I said,</p>
<p>for something larger than you as an individual.</p>
<p>If there is such a thing as a perfect conversation,</p>
<p>it would be a conversation on death, meaning, and robots</p>
<p>with the great John Donoher.</p>
<p>John, I&rsquo;ve been a fan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would waste all your time today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lynx.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with John Donoher, and thank you to Onnit,</p>
<p>SimplySafe, Indeed, and Linode.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you some words</p>
<p>from John Donoher himself.</p>
<p>In fighting and competition, the objective is victory.</p>
<p>In training, the objective is skill development.</p>
<p>Do not confuse them.</p>
<p>As such, one of the best ways to train</p>
<p>is to identify the strengths of your various partners</p>
<p>and regularly expose yourself to those strengths.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
