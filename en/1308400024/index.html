    <p>Hi friends, so this episode is all about making you some friends. I&rsquo;m gonna teach you everything</p>
<p>I fucking know and it&rsquo;s a whole bunch</p>
<p>I promise and I hope I&rsquo;m able to share some things that you haven&rsquo;t heard of before and I really really hope at the end</p>
<p>of this episode you feel a little bit more excited and</p>
<p>prepared and like equipped with the knowledge and ideas to go out and make some goddamn friends because I know exactly how it is to</p>
<p>Feel lonely as shit and these are all the things I&rsquo;ve learned and I hope they can help you</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna start off with a couple tips and just general things and then I&rsquo;m gonna get straight into</p>
<p>Where to meet motherfuckers and where to actually make friends where to go what to do and how to do it</p>
<p>But the first thing I want to say is like a reassuring thing. You&rsquo;re not the only one looking for connection</p>
<p>I promise you that you&rsquo;re not the only one that&rsquo;s looking for friends</p>
<p>I know it feels like that sometimes but you&rsquo;re not the only one that wants to make friends and that&rsquo;s looking for people</p>
<p>To have in their life</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more common than you think people just don&rsquo;t talk about it</p>
<p>Like for some reason it&rsquo;s weird to want to make friends like there&rsquo;s just a weird fucking stigma around it</p>
<p>But I want to reassure you that you&rsquo;re not crazy and you&rsquo;re not alone and other people are looking for friends, too</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just you</p>
<p>Because the messages I&rsquo;ve received in the last like six months</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had at least 50 people ask me to make a podcast episode about making friends</p>
<p>Since I started this fucking thing and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exaggerating like at least 50 at least 50 people have messaged me asking for it. So here it fucking is</p>
<p>So the first thing I really need you to get is that there is a potential for connection all around you all the time</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Realized this at the beach the other day</p>
<p>I went to the beach with a couple of my friends and I was just looking around at all the people on the beach</p>
<p>And I was like Leo you literally could walk up to any of these people right now</p>
<p>Start talking to them and maybe become friends with any of them that possibility is there but I&rsquo;m choosing not to</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m choosing to sit here on my little fucking towel and hang out with my little group and not</p>
<p>Go out and find more friends, which is fine</p>
<p>but my whole point of bringing this up is to make it clear that</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s potential for connection all around you</p>
<p>But you need to realize you&rsquo;re choosing not to act on it. You&rsquo;re choosing not to go up to people</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s plenty of reasons why I fucking get it, but we got to realize</p>
<p>What is actually in our control so that we can feel empowered to do something about it?</p>
<p>But that is in our control. I could have gotten up and talked to any fucking buddy</p>
<p>I wanted to but I did it but that was my choice and reminding myself and seeing it as a choice</p>
<p>Is what&rsquo;s gonna make you feel better about moving forward with everything?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to say like you have to take accountability first</p>
<p>So go into where to meet friends. You need to get clear with yourself on what kind of friend you want</p>
<p>Do you want a friend that you go to the gym with do you want like a fit friend like a workout friend?</p>
<p>Do you want a business friend someone that&rsquo;s like an entrepreneur and doing their shit? Do you want successful friends?</p>
<p>Do you want party friends friends to go party with and go get fucked up and like go to clubs and shit?</p>
<p>Is that a type friend you want or do you want a friend that&rsquo;s just gonna hang out with you in your day-to-day?</p>
<p>and have deep talks and whatever it is like just get clear on what you want a friend for and</p>
<p>What you want your friend to be able to do because I&rsquo;m just gonna tell you it&rsquo;s a lot more difficult than you think</p>
<p>to find</p>
<p>Friends with range. I have a couple thank fucking God, but I do a lot of shit like I&rsquo;m into fitness</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m into business</p>
<p>I like to party sometimes when it&rsquo;s not gonna fuck up the rest of the shit that I&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>But I like to go to raves and concerts and stuff. I like to travel</p>
<p>I like to have really deep talks as you fucking know</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very like clean with the way that I eat and I&rsquo;m very conscientious about my health</p>
<p>But I do all of those things and it&rsquo;s very difficult to find someone with that level of range</p>
<p>Cuz typically the people that party a lot</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take into consideration their health and the people that are fucking fitness nuts are not</p>
<p>Really gonna be down to go out and party with you</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like you got to figure out what you want friends for and then find different friends to fill different slots</p>
<p>So if you want a workout friend and a fit friend focus on finding a fit friend</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be different places. You can go to meet these type people</p>
<p>Versus if you want a party friend or a friend that&rsquo;s gonna travel with you or you want another friend</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very into deep talks</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my first step is get clear on what you want a friend for and realize one friend is not enough because</p>
<p>People do not have typically the range</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>Some people do that are into a lot of things and if you only have one friend that does have range</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be fucking lonely when they&rsquo;re busy. So you need multiple</p>
<p>You need a lot of</p>
<p>resources and people to like</p>
<p>hang out with and do shit with because when one&rsquo;s busy you got another one and when you have a falling out with one of</p>
<p>Them where you have an argument or whatever</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the end of the fucking world and you&rsquo;re not gonna get too enmeshed or too like</p>
<p>Treating it like a relationship and shit, you know</p>
<p>So when you go to make friends, this is my first fucking tip and it&rsquo;s a bigger tip than most people realize</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>Says a lot and can help you a lot</p>
<p>So when you go out and you&rsquo;re in the mood to go like meet new people and have friends</p>
<p>Where what the fuck is gonna make you feel confident?</p>
<p>But also wear something a little weird or something that expresses a certain interest of yours</p>
<p>So some people are in the fucking anime. I don&rsquo;t fuck with anime</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it, but some people are into that shit</p>
<p>So wear something fucking anime</p>
<p>So that other people that like anime will see it on you and they&rsquo;ll see you have something in common and then they&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>Instantly drawn to you. And if you&rsquo;re not someone that&rsquo;s very outgoing</p>
<p>That gives someone like me who is outgoing a reason to come up and talk to you</p>
<p>If you look cool or you seem interesting or whatever</p>
<p>It is like give people a reason to come and talk to you. Give them a conversation opener if you&rsquo;re not very outgoing</p>
<p>Another good idea is having merch for some of your favorite shit like the podcast call her daddy</p>
<p>They have merch and it&rsquo;s like the daddy gang</p>
<p>So like when you see people out in public that are wearing the call her daddy merch, you know</p>
<p>Their brain works a certain way, you know, they have a certain set of knowledge</p>
<p>You know, they have a certain sense of humor and you know, you&rsquo;ll get along if you both enjoy listening to that same podcast</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;ll easily make you feel like</p>
<p>Connected to people but you have to wear shit to let them know that you have something in common</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t do nothing crazy. Don&rsquo;t be out there with it and don&rsquo;t be a fucking weirdo about it</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a good way for people to open up conversation or you can open up conversation with other people</p>
<p>about it like mentioning something that they&rsquo;re wearing that you both have in common and</p>
<p>Also, if you look fucking cute, it gives someone an opportunity to compliment you</p>
<p>So girls trying to make friends that are girls like bitch wear something cute be hot and don&rsquo;t worry about girls being intimidated by you</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want friends that are intimidated</p>
<p>Anyways, you want friends that are gonna hype you up and tell you you look fucking hot if you look fucking hot</p>
<p>so like dress where you feel confident, but dress like</p>
<p>Complimentable and then wear something that is like letting people know you have something in common like express your interests through what you&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>A little bit. I&rsquo;m not the motherfucker to ask about that. I wear all black. I don&rsquo;t like logos. I don&rsquo;t like branding</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like you to be able to tell like what shit is on me. So I don&rsquo;t want anyone to know my interests</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not like the one to</p>
<p>Practice what I preach on this one</p>
<p>But this is a really good idea for other people because I&rsquo;m someone that&rsquo;s very outgoing and I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable letting people know things</p>
<p>About me, but people wearing shit that I know of it makes me feel confident and comfortable to go up and talk to them</p>
<p>And open up conversation because if I see someone wearing teal swan merch that she&rsquo;s a spiritual guru</p>
<p>I fucking love that bitch with my whole heart if I saw someone wearing her merch</p>
<p>I would run up to them immediately and I&rsquo;m not letting you walk away not being friends with me</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna get your number. We&rsquo;re gonna fucking hang out. I did that one time</p>
<p>Actually, I saw someone wearing a mask when kovat was like a fucking thing</p>
<p>And I was like, oh my god, it&rsquo;s a teal swan fucking frequency mask and I went up to the guy and I was like</p>
<p>Yo, I was like, is that a teal swan mask?</p>
<p>And he was like, I don&rsquo;t know my sister gave it to me like what is that?</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, never mind, but my point is I saw someone</p>
<p>Wearing something that I thought was from someone I was so interested in and I ran up to them immediately</p>
<p>So give people the chance to do that by expressing what the fuck you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>Okay, so my next tip is to go places regularly</p>
<p>So if you go to a coffee shop go to the same fucking coffee shop if you go to like a little restaurant</p>
<p>Go to the same places like over and over and become like a familiar face in these places</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a couple reasons I say this and one of them is because if you get along well with the staff and</p>
<p>You start like shooting shit every day or like there&rsquo;s this bar</p>
<p>I go to downtown and the girl behind the counter her name&rsquo;s Shania and like we get along so well and we just bullshit</p>
<p>But like we&rsquo;re friends now because I&rsquo;ve consistently gone in there</p>
<p>Like she&rsquo;s fun as fuck and like we just shoot shit back and forth but getting to know the staff at places</p>
<p>Can help you a lot</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Another thing with that is like go alone like going out to eat alone if you like your waiter and they&rsquo;re like all these they</p>
<p>Seem fucking cool. There&rsquo;s a lot of young people that are waiters and waitresses if you&rsquo;re young looking for friends</p>
<p>But if you hit it off with a waiter or a waitress</p>
<p>Fucking be like, oh my god, you&rsquo;re fun as shit. Let&rsquo;s be friends like at the end like I&rsquo;m leaving my number</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna check for you. Let&rsquo;s be friends like you can just hit it off with people</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just kind of an example of like how to meet someone but being consistent as my point on this one is like go to places</p>
<p>Regularly, it&rsquo;s like the coffee shop go to the same fucking one</p>
<p>Talk to the same people get known by people or even just become a frequent face that people see because when people see you</p>
<p>Consistently they see a familiar face. You&rsquo;re familiar to them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re comfortable with you being there and that opens up the possibility</p>
<p>For them to relax and break the communication barrier if you don&rsquo;t first, so that&rsquo;s another point</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get into is breaking the communication barrier and I&rsquo;m gonna teach you some ways to fucking do that</p>
<p>but being a familiar face is more important than you think and especially with</p>
<p>Like more like trendy places</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s this restaurant that I go to called George Bistro and I&rsquo;ve gone there for a long time</p>
<p>you know my sister and my dad like we fucking love that place and</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten to know the waitstaff and my personality</p>
<p>I get along with fucking everybody and if we get along we get the fuck along like if you get my humor bitch</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re besties. So there&rsquo;s been multiple times that the staff like they&rsquo;re cute at that restaurant. They&rsquo;ll go out together</p>
<p>so like at the end of their shifts on weekends and shit a</p>
<p>Couple of the staff will like go out together</p>
<p>Like go to a bar and go hang out and they&rsquo;ve invited me a couple of times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been busy and I really want to go hang out with them because they&rsquo;re cool as fuck</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just something that is an easy way to make friends</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re going to eat at these places you become friends with the staff you become like familiar with them</p>
<p>They see your personalities cool you get along</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a perfect way to go and meet friends and hang out with people because if you go</p>
<p>With this certain waiter or two waiters waitresses that you really like you&rsquo;ll meet other ones. You&rsquo;ll meet friends</p>
<p>You already know you bond. You already know that you&rsquo;re comfortable with each other. You&rsquo;re a familiar face. They seem like</p>
<p>Familiar to you because they are so that&rsquo;s easy fucking gold for making friends. Is that</p>
<p>Okay. So remember when I just talked about breaking the communication barrier</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna talk about this at the gym because the gym is a great place to meet friends and</p>
<p>Especially if you want someone that&rsquo;s into fitness and into like a healthy lifestyle and working on their goals and shit</p>
<p>So at the gym, it&rsquo;s the same kind of thing if you go to the gym at the same time</p>
<p>Relatively every day you&rsquo;re gonna start seeing the same people that go at that time</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna start becoming familiar to you. You&rsquo;re gonna start becoming a familiar face to them now</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a lot easier to break the communication barrier with them. So a big fucking tip I have</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>Anything anywhere not just at the gym. I cannot tell you how fucking far it goes just to acknowledge</p>
<p>Someone exists if you look at them in their eyes and smile at them</p>
<p>Just smiling at them and looking them in their eyes lets them know that you see them</p>
<p>okay, that&rsquo;s bigger than you fucking think because everybody&rsquo;s so busy busy busy go go go and just</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s an acknowledgement as looking them in their eyes and smiling at them. That&rsquo;s acknowledging them</p>
<p>you can even say hi just fucking saying hi with a smile is</p>
<p>Bigger than you realize you don&rsquo;t have to like say hi expecting a conversation</p>
<p>You can just say hi like and keep walking or whatever it is or just like get back to whatever you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>That person now feels comfortable with you because this woman did it to me</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve talked about this on the podcast yet</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>This woman did it to me on my flight to Cabo like typically when you get in a plane you just sit down and shut</p>
<p>The fuck up. Well, that&rsquo;s what I do</p>
<p>but this woman like went and sat down next to me and she just looked at me and smiled real big and was like</p>
<p>Hi, like just a real friendly. Hi, and I was like hi and then she just finished putting her shit away</p>
<p>I went back to like fucking with my air pods and then we just sat there</p>
<p>But I felt so comfortable because there wasn&rsquo;t that awkward silence of like, oh we haven&rsquo;t acknowledged each other</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it was broken</p>
<p>She broke that and made it comfortable and then we ended up talking and like I initiated</p>
<p>Conversation because I felt comfortable too because she acknowledged my fucking existence and then we ended up talking a lot throughout the flight and</p>
<p>I fucking miss her and I love her and like we bonded</p>
<p>But just saying hi and acknowledging someone is bigger than you think so, especially at the fucking gym</p>
<p>This is gonna get easier and easier</p>
<p>So for guys and girls, you&rsquo;re able to like look at each other and smile just a friendly fucking smile</p>
<p>Whatever that&rsquo;s great smile as as the days go by and you start seeing people more smile at them say hi</p>
<p>Say what&rsquo;s up? Acknowledge them? Whatever like guys with a little fucking like chin up at each other like what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very common. So that&rsquo;s a good thing. That&rsquo;s acknowledgement</p>
<p>but a couple things you can say at the gym to break the communication barrier is</p>
<p>Tell someone you like their shoes</p>
<p>Ask someone where they got something be like yo, that&rsquo;s sick</p>
<p>Where did you get that whether whatever the fuck it is?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if they have a fucking slim Jim like it just find something about them</p>
<p>You like or something that they&rsquo;re wearing that you like me like yo, that&rsquo;s sick</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d you get it because you&rsquo;re gonna make them feel good and you asked where&rsquo;d you get it?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to have a full fucking conversation</p>
<p>All you need to do when you break the barrier of communication is just break the barrier</p>
<p>So like this guy I told one time at the gym</p>
<p>I was like, yo, your sleeves are sick and he was like, oh, thank you, bro</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah most people with sleeves like the sleeves be wearing them</p>
<p>But you wearing the fuck out of those they look good and I made him laugh and then I like he was like, thanks</p>
<p>And he got like flat our knees cool and whatever and then it&rsquo;s like I left</p>
<p>I had no intention of having any further conversation</p>
<p>Like I just wanted to let him know that his fucking sleeves were cool break that barrier cuz it&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re alone in the</p>
<p>Locker room, it&rsquo;s fucking weird. So I&rsquo;ll just like speak to you. So like I made him feel good about himself</p>
<p>He likes his tattoos</p>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s like whenever we see each other at the gym, it&rsquo;s like what&rsquo;s up, buddy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the barrier was broken and now it&rsquo;s cool. And now it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the point is just fucking speak to them speak at them</p>
<p>Another thing you can ask someone in the gym to break that barrier</p>
<p>You just want to talk to them is walking up to them if they&rsquo;re on a machine between sets</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking do it in the middle of their set and</p>
<p>Be like yo, are you using this and point to something next to them and get on it or be like yo</p>
<p>How many sets you got left and then just be like, okay cool. No rush. No worries</p>
<p>Just let it fucking be but you broke that communication, you know</p>
<p>like you fucking talked to them and now you can walk off like you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>Go into making friends and like have a full fucking conversation with people</p>
<p>You can just acknowledge them break that communication barrier and then see them the next day</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna escalate like every day you see them after you break the communication barrier</p>
<p>Just find a way to acknowledge them every day every other day, whatever it is, but it&rsquo;s just gonna get more and more in-depth</p>
<p>And you never know what&rsquo;s gonna come of it</p>
<p>Like you literally have no fucking clue because I&rsquo;ve been invited to shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been invited to parties and it&rsquo;s like girl like thanks, but like fuck no</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go to no strangers parties</p>
<p>but my whole point is you never know where it&rsquo;s gonna go where it&rsquo;s gonna lead to and you don&rsquo;t have to have a</p>
<p>Full conversation when you go to meet somebody that&rsquo;s a big thing</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to just acknowledge them and keep moving keep on your fucking way. You don&rsquo;t have to have a full conversation</p>
<p>Let it happen organically</p>
<p>Let it happen naturally if it&rsquo;s you like you keep seeing people at the same place like the gym now</p>
<p>If you see someone out one time and you know, they&rsquo;re probably not gonna see them again</p>
<p>you need to like put a little more effort into having more of a conversation but like at the gym you can just like</p>
<p>Bullshit and see where it goes</p>
<p>okay, so my next tip for finding a friend look at what you&rsquo;re into find your hobbies or your interests or whatever it is because</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple things that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to try and I&rsquo;m like, I know they&rsquo;re on my list</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>but making friends is not my priority right now, but a couple things on my list are yoga because I really want to try yoga</p>
<p>And the people that do yoga are usually like with it to a certain extent like awareness wise so or they&rsquo;re spiritual</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like a good place to meet people like that. I thought about volleyball because I&rsquo;m I love a volleyball</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very competitive like tennis and shit</p>
<p>Um, my town does a run club every Wednesday like they everyone meets downtown at a certain spot and day</p>
<p>Everybody just runs like three miles together girl. I ain&rsquo;t running no three fucking miles right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to fucking work my endurance up before I try and go join some fucking run club</p>
<p>Like who do I think I am?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a good way to get around people</p>
<p>But to have an activity to do same with cycling classes like if you want to go to a cycle class</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re around people with an activity so that&rsquo;s like a really really good and comfortable thing is</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re fucking around people, but you have something to do so you have a reason to interact</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not your only reason for talking to them</p>
<p>Like you does that make sense like you have an activity to do and you can talk but talking is not the only reason that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re near each other and interacting. It&rsquo;s like walking up to someone at a bar</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like bitch have something to do don&rsquo;t just come up and talk to me because it&rsquo;s awkward</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about people in general. Like if you guys ever recognize me in public come fucking say hi. I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck how weird is it? I&rsquo;ll buy you a drink. Well if I could take a picture</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever be scared to come up to me</p>
<p>but make it clear that you know me from like my podcast or tick-tock or something because I&rsquo;m not approachable in</p>
<p>Like bars or like out in public. So like if you recognize me just if you see me looking like a fucking asshole</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how I am. That&rsquo;s just my external shell. So if you come up to him like hey, it&rsquo;s like Leo</p>
<p>I know you from tick-tock or I know you from your podcast or like a whatever</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll immediately drop that like facade and I&rsquo;ll be like, oh my god. Hi</p>
<p>But I have that facade so people leave me the fuck alone. But yeah, that&rsquo;s just my heads up on that</p>
<p>But yeah, my point with going to all these classes and shit is like that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s plenty of places to meet people</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s things to do and with finding things to do another thing that kind of goes along with that is</p>
<p>Like finding someone that you can do an activity with so</p>
<p>examples of this are like an acting coach if you want some kind of coach or like</p>
<p>shit for acting or singing or whatever or a fucking trainer at the gym or a</p>
<p>Lash lady a nail lady your barber your hairstylist, whatever it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like these people that you&rsquo;re around you&rsquo;re forced to be around them and</p>
<p>Communicate with them and talk to them and engage and interact it&rsquo;s so much easier to make a connection off of that</p>
<p>opposed to like I said before of just not having a reason to be around each other because you have a chance to get to</p>
<p>Know each other for a certain amount of time like when I go to my barber</p>
<p>Me and him are cool as fuck me and him are like friends as shit because I&rsquo;m with you</p>
<p>For an hour every fucking week like we&rsquo;re gonna hang out</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get to know each other and like we haven&rsquo;t hung out like outside of the chair yet</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just busy and he catches me at the wrong fucking time and he got a wife and shit and like we&rsquo;d be partying</p>
<p>in different ways so</p>
<p>Like we try to hang out a lot</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t line up but my point is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like get to know the people that you have to be around because it&rsquo;s like school friends</p>
<p>like you know when you were in school and you all had to be around each other and it was just easy to fucking like</p>
<p>Make friends because you were forced to be around each other use those opportunities</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re trained to make friends from growing up like being around people at school</p>
<p>You were forced to be around them</p>
<p>So use that to your advantage</p>
<p>Be friends with all the people you have to be around and my other little thing about that is like jobs like your co-workers and shit</p>
<p>You have to be around them might as well make it fucking fun</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;ve worked with certain people for a long time and you don&rsquo;t really know how to like</p>
<p>Bring up hanging out like just throw it in fucking conversation</p>
<p>Like oh my god, we should hang out or like if someone comes to you about gossip like oh bitch the way you talk shit</p>
<p>We need to hang out</p>
<p>We need to get drinks or like say something like that</p>
<p>but also if there&rsquo;s people at your work that you want to talk to that you&rsquo;re just like around but</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really how to talk to them</p>
<p>Just fucking find a way to break the communication</p>
<p>Like I said, if you need something if you need to ask them for something do it</p>
<p>but the more you can see them and the more you can like put yourself around them the better and</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s just like this unspoken person you want to hang out with and you&rsquo;ve seen them for a long time be like, yo</p>
<p>You intrigue me for some reason I feel drawn to you. So let&rsquo;s hang out</p>
<p>I think we meant to be friends like just say some kind of fucking joke or like open it up</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m gonna come sit by you today like something just something to like get around them</p>
<p>Something I just thought about that is the most bonding experience and is the best way to meet someone new is</p>
<p>Fucking smoking a blunt together</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re someone that smokes bitch, that is your way in tell someone you want to smoke with them</p>
<p>Because that is a fat-ass compliment because there&rsquo;s certain people you just can&rsquo;t smoke with you know</p>
<p>I mean like you want to be in good company when you&rsquo;re smoking a fucking blunt and that&rsquo;s just such a bonding experience</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cutesy and you guys could talk about all kind of shit because your brains both gonna start like tweaking</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be thinking all kind of shit. So that&rsquo;s perfect. Literally just tell someone you want to smoke with them</p>
<p>But if they don&rsquo;t smoke be like, oh, whatever. Let&rsquo;s get drinks then and if I say, oh, I don&rsquo;t drink</p>
<p>Okay, then what do you do? Cuz clearly I&rsquo;m trying to be a friend. You know what I mean? Like just be funny</p>
<p>So my next piece of advice for people that want to find like business friends. This is what I&rsquo;ve thought of to do</p>
<p>So, you know how there&rsquo;s like business seminars and shit and like people will put on big like group events</p>
<p>And you can go like watch people speak and it&rsquo;s just like little business events and you have to pay</p>
<p>Some of them are like a hundred bucks and some of them are like five thousand bucks to go to I ain&rsquo;t going to the</p>
<p>Fucking expensive ones. Yeah, like I&rsquo;m tripping over like 150 all the fucking tickets</p>
<p>But those are great places to go network and meet people that are business minded and are trying to grow their business</p>
<p>Or become an entrepreneur</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been looking into recently is finding out where upcoming seminars are gonna be and then planning to travel to them because</p>
<p>Even if you meet people that are in different places than you you never know where they&rsquo;re from and it&rsquo;s good to have</p>
<p>Connections everywhere because you never know where you&rsquo;re gonna end up because right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a place where I want to fucking move and I&rsquo;m thinking Houston, but I&rsquo;m not sure for sure where I want to move</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like if I go to a seminar and I meet some really fucking cool people and I&rsquo;m like, where do you live?</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, oh Chicago or</p>
<p>California I&rsquo;m like, okay. Well here I come like now I want to move there because now I have people there, you know</p>
<p>So you never know what&rsquo;s gonna come of it?</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t just immediately shut it off in your mind</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a really good place to go to meet business minded people is seminars and little events and shit</p>
<p>And what I said about having connections and meeting people that could be anywhere. That&rsquo;s where social media will come in</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great way to make friends is social media</p>
<p>Finding people that have the same interests as you Facebook groups are really fucking underrated thing because there&rsquo;s local Facebook groups</p>
<p>For all kind of shit like any interest you have is a fucking Facebook group for it</p>
<p>So literally go on any fucking Facebook group that you find an interest in and join it and just talk shit</p>
<p>See who&rsquo;s in there post some shit like just see who you meet and see you like who catches your attention</p>
<p>But when you immediately have something to bond over you don&rsquo;t have to fake conversation. You have something to talk about</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also local groups</p>
<p>Like I said, so if you find people that are in your city or in a city nearby</p>
<p>You can fucking travel and see them or like hang out with them if they&rsquo;re in your city</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great way to make friends</p>
<p>but like also social media like not even just Facebook groups like Instagram tik-tok like there&rsquo;s plenty of ways to meet people and</p>
<p>Me posting on tik-tok has helped me meet a lot of cool-ass people</p>
<p>like I have a lot of internet friends now because I&rsquo;ve gotten online and</p>
<p>Posted shit and like revealed my personality and people just like what I have to say and they like me</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s made it really easy</p>
<p>Honestly, so even though other people live in different cities when I travel to different cities</p>
<p>We can hang the fuck out like I have people to hang out with</p>
<p>Anywhere I go if I travel somewhere and that&rsquo;s the best fucking feeling ever like to feel like you have someone somewhere</p>
<p>Anywhere you could go visit like that&rsquo;s the fucking best shit ever</p>
<p>And even if I didn&rsquo;t have someone I could make a post like yo who the fuck is in whatever city</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hang out or I&rsquo;m gonna be here. Let&rsquo;s hang out</p>
<p>So, yeah</p>
<p>Definitely utilize social media</p>
<p>Put effort into the connections that are with the people that you want or with people that are working towards the same shit as you</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>One thing I just thought of people are like obsessed with their fucking pets</p>
<p>So take your pet out if you have a dog take your fucking pet out</p>
<p>People have like a weird obsession with like their animals. I love cat. Okay, I love animals</p>
<p>I would never hurt an animal but some people have like a weird fucking fetish for their dog. I don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t get it but use that to your advantage if you want to go out and like meet people</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good way to like break</p>
<p>The tension and break the awkward like people will approach any fucking animal they see and if you&rsquo;re on the other end of the leash</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like boom you instantly have a reason to start talking to them</p>
<p>And if they seem cool, and if they have a dog be like, oh my god</p>
<p>They need to have a playdate like and then just hang out with them and but make it about that fucking dog</p>
<p>You know what? I mean? Like there&rsquo;s plenty of ways to</p>
<p>convert that into a friendship</p>
<p>But like if you don&rsquo;t want someone that&rsquo;s obsessed with their fucking animal</p>
<p>Then probably don&rsquo;t because I don&rsquo;t have no goddamn dog</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want no friends with dogs because I don&rsquo;t want no friends what responsibilities holding them down like that</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like people with kids like people my age with kids</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have friends that have kids like we don&rsquo;t hang out</p>
<p>Like I know people and I&rsquo;m not mean to people just because they have a kid but that does not mesh with my lifestyle</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not someone that wants the responsibility of oh</p>
<p>I need to remember to go home and take my fucking dog out so we can go piss or I have a whole</p>
<p>Ass baby at home. I can&rsquo;t do XYZ</p>
<p>I like the freedom of being able to get the fuck up and run away any moment</p>
<p>I want and I can&rsquo;t do that if I have a child or if I have a dog or like some animal that I cannot just</p>
<p>Throw in a little fucking carrier and run away cuz cat can come with me</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s very low maintenance and I love it</p>
<p>But does that make sense like if you want a friend you need to find out who&rsquo;s compatible with you as a friend because if</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re someone that&rsquo;s 24 and you meet some other bitch. That&rsquo;s 24 and she has a child like you&rsquo;re on very different pages</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a lot more to take into consideration</p>
<p>It is not gonna be able to do as much as you could do</p>
<p>So they could be a good friend to have but they might not be your like closest friend and that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>And another thing about being picky with the friends that you have</p>
<p>You need to make a list of like non-negotiables or like shit that you are</p>
<p>Looking for and shit that you would not put up with and a friend</p>
<p>The types of friends that I stay away from now are people that are constantly partying or</p>
<p>Drinking on weekdays, like why the fuck are you drinking on weekdays that are not Friday?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>Like I I&rsquo;m too busy and doing too much shit to have like my mental state altered or to feel hungover</p>
<p>Like on a weekday like sure two years ago, and I was going through a lot of shit. I was like drinking non-stop. I was</p>
<p>Entertaining extracurricular things. I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to call it</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m free to I have like free speech on my podcast, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know like doing drugs bitch. So like there was a time in my life where I was going through so much shit</p>
<p>I just had to escape my reality and cope through it. It&rsquo;s the only way I felt like I could do it</p>
<p>Like I was like drinking and drugging like every fucking weekend and it would like bleed into the weekdays sometimes</p>
<p>But the friends I made that I was doing that with are no longer the friends that I have</p>
<p>I no longer hang out with them because I&rsquo;ve changed and I want more for my life and I&rsquo;m now</p>
<p>Incompatible to those people because I don&rsquo;t drink and drug every weekend</p>
<p>I drink like every other weekend maybe but I don&rsquo;t get drunk like I used to and don&rsquo;t do drugs often</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t do Molly and coke and shit. Like it&rsquo;s not my fucking thing. It stresses me the fuck out</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it. Like I&rsquo;ve stopped doing it at festivals and shit too</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll do mushrooms or I&rsquo;ll do like acid, but I&rsquo;m not doing like crazy fucking shit anymore</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just over it</p>
<p>But my whole point behind that is the friends that you make when you&rsquo;re doing that type shit when you want more from life</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to make new friends and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve had to do</p>
<p>Now I believe in balance. Okay, cuz I still do certain things. I still drink. I still party. I still have fun</p>
<p>I do raves, but I also prioritize what the fuck I&rsquo;m doing and I want people around me that also are able to do that</p>
<p>But yeah</p>
<p>I had a big period where I was fucking alone with nobody because all the friends I had</p>
<p>Were just party friends and they didn&rsquo;t know how to like</p>
<p>Not be under the influence of something</p>
<p>So like when I tried to get my shit together and when I started like making</p>
<p>Different decisions and I started trying to make a business and grow my social media</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I didn&rsquo;t have time to do those things anymore</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of my non-negotiables now is like I don&rsquo;t want friends that</p>
<p>Drink every fucking day or do drugs and a very frequent basis. Like I don&rsquo;t want that shit</p>
<p>I want people that are like level-headed and driven and working towards shit like I am but will let loose when they want to you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>Another thing like I said is kids like someone that has kids</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna not be friends with you because you have a kid but you&rsquo;re not gonna be a very close close friend to me</p>
<p>That I hang out with all the time because kids are fucking inconvenient for the lifestyle that I want to live</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t have one</p>
<p>Like I want fucking kids so bad</p>
<p>But I know the way that I want to live and I know what I need to put my energy into right now</p>
<p>So finding friends on the same page as you and finding friends that want to invest their time and energy into the same things as</p>
<p>You with like similar priorities is your best bet. So find the ones</p>
<p>That are on the same fucking path as you because if you don&rsquo;t and you try and force</p>
<p>Friendships with people that are not working towards the same thing. You are they&rsquo;re gonna snatch you away from what you want to do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just how it goes. It&rsquo;s not gonna seem like obvious but</p>
<p>Skipping what you&rsquo;re wanting to do to go out and party or whatever</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only gonna happen so many times before it starts like really fucking with your progress and like holding you back from what you want</p>
<p>but another non-negotiable for me is someone who only fucking works out and is a health nut like</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t have fun and like let loose and do shit with me if you&rsquo;re always just gonna be uptight and boring and</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go to a fucking restaurant because you have to like weigh your fucking meals</p>
<p>Oh my god, bro</p>
<p>Like I have to fucking eat only four ounces of chicken</p>
<p>Like no, I&rsquo;m not I don&rsquo;t fucking hang out with people like that like a little perfectionist</p>
<p>No, I like to actually feel like it&rsquo;s okay to be human and being around people like that. It ain&rsquo;t fun</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a non-negotiable for me too. Like I&rsquo;m very fucking picky with my friends, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with it at all because I&rsquo;m gonna encourage you to be the same way</p>
<p>Because friends really have the potential to hold you back or help you move forward</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very very important that you fucking choose wisely</p>
<p>so my next tip is</p>
<p>Go to shit you&rsquo;re invited to and even if you seem like oh my god</p>
<p>I really just don&rsquo;t want to fucking go to this you never know who you&rsquo;re gonna meet and you never know what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>So start saying yes to shit. Okay. I mean if you really are just like no</p>
<p>This is not gonna go anywhere good and you just like resent it and you really do not want to do it</p>
<p>Then don&rsquo;t go but if you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>Then make yourself go because you never know who you&rsquo;re gonna fucking meet and that&rsquo;s one of my best tips for like</p>
<p>Going out and doing shit, even if you have a friend that you&rsquo;re not like super close with</p>
<p>like kind of use them to</p>
<p>Get you out and about so whenever I&rsquo;m out in public by myself. I&rsquo;m a lot more</p>
<p>Hesitant to talk to people than I am when I&rsquo;m with someone so like when I feel safe and comfortable</p>
<p>Like I have someone with me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lot more outgoing and willing to talk and shoot shit and like engage in conversation and start up conversation</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that is</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re the same way</p>
<p>use a friend that you have to go be social in other settings and like to go do things like I</p>
<p>Call it having a home base. Like when I go out, I like to have the people</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m gonna be out with</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;ll like go frolic around and like meet new people</p>
<p>Flirt fuck around and like I&rsquo;ll just do my thing like I&rsquo;ll just like social butterfly my ass around</p>
<p>But I feel comfortable to do that because I have my home base of the people. I know I&rsquo;m out with</p>
<p>But do that</p>
<p>So like even if you don&rsquo;t want to go to this fucking event or you don&rsquo;t want to go to this thing or whatever it</p>
<p>Is if you have one friend that you know, that&rsquo;s going then go with them because they&rsquo;re gonna be your little home base</p>
<p>For when you&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel comfortable to just talk to other people that are there and shoot shit and you don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re gonna meet</p>
<p>so you never know the connections you&rsquo;re gonna make fucking go because the nights that I&rsquo;ve met people that I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>the tightest with are</p>
<p>The nights where I&rsquo;m like, I really just don&rsquo;t feel like I fit in</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I fucking belong and I&rsquo;ve met some really cool fucking people</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my biggest tip is use the fucking friends you got and go to the shit. You&rsquo;re invited to</p>
<p>so this next tip is</p>
<p>My biggest one after you make a connection with somebody you need to fucking hang out with them very soon</p>
<p>After like next day two days later</p>
<p>You need to fucking set up some time for you to hang out again</p>
<p>If you meet someone out partying or whatever schedule a fucking like let&rsquo;s hang out tomorrow or let&rsquo;s hang out in two days</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go grab lunch. Whatever the fuck it is find a way to</p>
<p>Stay connected to them and stay like on their mind and like I swear just hang out fucking quick because if you don&rsquo;t hang out</p>
<p>Quick right after you meet them. You&rsquo;re not gonna fucking hang out. I don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this weird fucking like cosmic thing, but you don&rsquo;t meet someone and then hang out a month later</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t hang out with them relatively quickly after you met them for the first time and establish that connection</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna lose it. I&rsquo;m just gonna go ahead and warn you. I&rsquo;ve been through that shit too many fucking times and</p>
<p>also, if you&rsquo;re gonna meet someone that&rsquo;s out like</p>
<p>Partying or whatever and they&rsquo;re drunk and they talk about hanging out and it&rsquo;s like if you make an effort to hang out with them</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re not drunk and they kind of blow it off. Let it go. Let it fucking go</p>
<p>Do not try and force it because a lot of people talk shit and run their fucking mouth</p>
<p>About hanging out when they&rsquo;re drunk</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re gonna make plans make them when you&rsquo;re sober and make them when other people are sober. Oh</p>
<p>another tip remember when I said about</p>
<p>Wearing something cool and wearing something that you can like relate to people with or something that people could talk to you about</p>
<p>Look at people&rsquo;s fucking tattoos because if someone got something tattooed on them, it&rsquo;s very important to them</p>
<p>So make sure you like look at people&rsquo;s tattoos and take an interest in them</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something a lot of people don&rsquo;t do is you can like ask people about their tattoos what they are</p>
<p>What they mean if you recognize something that you like see that you both have something in common great</p>
<p>That means it&rsquo;s very important to them</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your fucking shoe in with them have how to open up conversation how to talk to them</p>
<p>Whatever it is or like walk up to someone with a tattoo like yo, is that XYZ?</p>
<p>What I like an anime fucking shit is the best example like yo, is that fucking I don&rsquo;t even know animation</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even give me an example</p>
<p>But like you get what I mean</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s like a symbol that you fucking recognize or whatever like yo, is that that and they&rsquo;ll be like, yeah</p>
<p>and then most people will like go into a story or go into something about it and they&rsquo;ll keep the</p>
<p>Conversation going or you can just be like, yo, it&rsquo;s fucking sick</p>
<p>I love XYZ to or be like, I know that&rsquo;s how your coolest shit. We need to be friends and be like, here&rsquo;s my number</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hang out. You literally have to just fucking go for it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as fucking awkward as you think and people are just as excited as you are</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking to them about something that they&rsquo;re interested in because like if someone came up to me about</p>
<p>One of my tattoos I have no tattoos, honestly</p>
<p>But like if I had some spiritual shit tattooed on me and someone came up to me and recognized what it was</p>
<p>I would be like, oh my fucking god, like I would be so excited that someone just recognized it</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my reassurance to you is like when you&rsquo;re talking to someone or you&rsquo;re noticing something about them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re instantly gonna feel close and bonded and like drawn to each other for it. I promise you just gotta fucking do it</p>
<p>But another thing with that is like how I said, let&rsquo;s be friends</p>
<p>Like you have to tell people like yo, like let&rsquo;s be fucking friends. You&rsquo;re cool as shit</p>
<p>You have to express that you want to be friends</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s scary and it&rsquo;s risky</p>
<p>But like I said with the whole familiar thing if you keep seeing people and you get more comfortable and familiar with them</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot easier to say that but if you just throw the word friend in you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in talking further express that if you&rsquo;re interested in hanging out again</p>
<p>Express that but yo, let&rsquo;s get lunch. You seem cool as shit</p>
<p>I want to keep talking but let them know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Interested in getting to know them better and be friends or whatever it is people love that shit</p>
<p>Like if someone fucking said that to me like I instantly fucking love you</p>
<p>You know, like oh my god, you like me the fact that people like me makes me like them</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how everybody is. It&rsquo;s human psychology. So remember that</p>
<p>so I have a couple more tips, but a really really big one is</p>
<p>Be your fucking self</p>
<p>Do not try to be</p>
<p>What you think people would like or what other people would want you to be don&rsquo;t try to be that</p>
<p>Be fucking you because when you meet people</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you want them to meet you want them to like you for who you are and the way you show up</p>
<p>Genuinely not for some image you&rsquo;re putting on that&rsquo;s creates distance</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna feel close to people like that and</p>
<p>It will speed up the full process of you finding friends that actually will be like good friends to you and will like you for</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>Like it will make it so much easier for you to make friends and find friends because the people that like you for you are</p>
<p>Getting to experience you right off the bat. So the people that like who you truly are are gonna be drawn to you</p>
<p>Immediately, so you&rsquo;re fucking good, you know</p>
<p>And when you meet new people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much easier to set up boundaries with them than it is to set up boundaries with people that</p>
<p>Already know you or like you have a past with because they just it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s harder to like go back and act different than what?</p>
<p>They know</p>
<p>Versus setting something up from the get-go of like these are my boundaries. This is what I like</p>
<p>This is what I don&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;s easier to do that with new people</p>
<p>Like out the gate so they know what to expect and they know what they&rsquo;re getting into</p>
<p>They know how to treat you from the fucking get-go. That&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very important and it&rsquo;s easy to do when someone&rsquo;s meeting you for the first time</p>
<p>So when I say be you be you set your fucking boundaries be clear about what you do and don&rsquo;t like don&rsquo;t be fucking mean</p>
<p>But like just give people the chance to get to know the actual you and see if the true</p>
<p>You is who they want to be friends with and you have to do the same to them</p>
<p>Like you want them to show you them?</p>
<p>So you can see if you actually want to be friends or not, like don&rsquo;t fucking catfish them</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re worried about rejection and shit, this is something that happened to me the other day when I was at the beach</p>
<p>So there were these volleyball nets and I wanted to play volleyball so fucking bad and like me and my friends were walking up to</p>
<p>Go to the bathroom and order drinks and shit and we had to walk past the volleyball court and there was four guys</p>
<p>Playing so two on each side and when I walked by I was like, yo</p>
<p>if you guys find a third like I want to play so they all looked at me and</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t say a fucking word and I just kept walking</p>
<p>Like they literally like blew me the fuck off. Like I didn&rsquo;t just say shit, but I expressed my interest in playing</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always mean you&rsquo;re gonna line up with people that are gonna be receptive to that or will be nice to you</p>
<p>Like they didn&rsquo;t acknowledge me, but I don&rsquo;t give a fuck that says more about them than it says about me like, okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go ask the next fucking group to play volleyball suck my dick, you know</p>
<p>But just because someone doesn&rsquo;t like return the favor, it doesn&rsquo;t fucking mean anything like it&rsquo;s not a big deal</p>
<p>Like you guys are just little shits like fuck you</p>
<p>Like I really like I genuinely didn&rsquo;t care like I just thought to myself. Okay, you fucking dumb fucks</p>
<p>I think I said that out loud, but I didn&rsquo;t say where they could hear it</p>
<p>But like I just kept walking going about my fucking day</p>
<p>Like I wasn&rsquo;t like fucked up by it or hurt by it. Like I was just like, oh like</p>
<p>whatever</p>
<p>But one day those boys are gonna get to a place where they&rsquo;re looking for connection</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re gonna have to go and try to find people to be friends with</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna have to go try to put their selves out there and then they&rsquo;re gonna be faced with exactly what they fucking did to</p>
<p>Me because that is how the universe works. You learn through fucking contrast. So the way that people treat you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna line up with the same shit. So just know that and just fucking keep your little ass moving. Don&rsquo;t get upset</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get insecure. Don&rsquo;t freak out if someone doesn&rsquo;t want to be friends with you</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t freak out if someone is like rude to you or whatever or just like doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge you like fuck you</p>
<p>Then like fuck you and just keep walking. You know, I mean, it&rsquo;s literally a numbers game</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fucking numbers game of how many people you can talk to I swear to God</p>
<p>Like if you just commit to talking to five new people a day like smiling and just like looking at someone in their eyes</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to talk to them or you could just say hi if you just commit to</p>
<p>Every day saying hi and smiling at five different people every day</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time</p>
<p>Before one of those smiles leads to something so much more if you want to make it ten people a fucking day</p>
<p>Then make it ten people. But if you&rsquo;re just playing the numbers game</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s eventually gonna flip like something&rsquo;s gonna change but not acknowledging people not talking to people not doing anything</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna keep getting you what you&rsquo;ve been getting. So if you just say I&rsquo;m gonna smile at fucking five people every day</p>
<p>Just see what happens and trust me</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be more shocked than you think but I guarantee you someone out of this group of people is</p>
<p>Going to like that about you that you just smiled at them and probably will say something and speak to you and you never know</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s gonna go. You never know where that initial</p>
<p>Acknowledgement of someone is going to lead</p>
<p>So just keep taking the fucking chance and literally every day just smile at five new people</p>
<p>I swear to God just fucking do it and see what happens because if you keep track for like a month</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hundred fifty fuck of people you just engaged with in one month and I guarantee you</p>
<p>More than you expect will talk to you and you might end up with a couple of friends at the end of the month</p>
<p>You never fucking know. So just give it the goddamn chance, but I promise you it&rsquo;s a numbers game</p>
<p>So increase your odds increase your chances and you&rsquo;re fucking good. Like it&rsquo;s gonna happen. It&rsquo;s a fucking numbers game</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you go to the casino and you just keep playing you&rsquo;re gonna hit eventually</p>
<p>You just gotta keep hitting the button</p>
<p>so keep smiling keep acknowledging people and just fucking take the chances that you can and</p>
<p>Do it and eventually one of them is gonna hit and I promise you it fucking will</p>
<p>Okay, my last thing this is what I&rsquo;m gonna leave y&rsquo;all off on because this podcast long as fuck</p>
<p>Go to a local therapist or counselor or whoever like just start talking to them about your little friend issue and</p>
<p>See if they have any ideas for what the fuck you could do places</p>
<p>You can go events you could attend just see cuz they&rsquo;re local don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in the area</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something my counselor helped me with like she thought of some new ideas of shit back in the day</p>
<p>That helped me and it like it&rsquo;s just a new perspective. It&rsquo;s new ideas</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s new thoughts and it&rsquo;s someone that&rsquo;s local</p>
<p>so they know what the fuck is going on and they probably can give you some more insight than I could because it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>Specific to your area. So go see a fucking counselor or a therapist or whatever it is</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just once go in there and talk to them about wanting to make friends and ask them their ideas of what you</p>
<p>Could do how to do it and then just see where the fuck it leads</p>
<p>But you got this. I promise I hope you take something away from this episode</p>
<p>And I hope you feel a little bit more like ready and prepared to go meet some fucking friends, bitch</p>
<p>Cuz you got this like it&rsquo;s literally a numbers game</p>
<p>I promise you got this so much and if you&rsquo;re listening to me you got</p>
<p>Personality and even if you don&rsquo;t just fucking copy some shit that I said and make people laugh</p>
<p>If you like this podcast, I just have one request and it&rsquo;s that you go leave me a five-star rating</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>
<p>If you want to keep up with me all of my social media will be linked in the description of this podcast</p>
<p>Also, if you are interested in one-on-one coaching with me I have now created an application process</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s no longer just free to schedule. I&rsquo;m doing applications now to keep up with the demand because it just got too high</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m screening people</p>
<p>Basically to see who&rsquo;s a good fit and who&rsquo;s not because I want to work with action takers</p>
<p>I want to work with people that are serious about transforming their life because the shit that I say y&rsquo;all know</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for and where I specialize is with the people that have been looking for answers</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find and the people that have been trying shit, and it&rsquo;s just not working</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the person that those people can go to</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in that I will put the link to the application in the description box also</p>
<p>And I want to make it very clear that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already got what it takes to get through what you&rsquo;re dealing with or to improve your life or to reach your goals</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll help you see that and it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot easier when you got me in your corner because that&rsquo;s exactly how</p>
<p>I want it to feel I want it to feel like you have someone that has your back and like I&rsquo;m in your corner because</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is. Like I&rsquo;m there for you, and I&rsquo;m there to do shit with you</p>
<p>But anyways, thank you so much for listening. Please stay safe and take care of yourself, and I will talk to you next Sunday</p>
