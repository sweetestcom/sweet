things yesterday but</p><p>welcome back anything that I say is</p><p>definitely not meant to</p><p>diagnose you or cure you this is just</p><p>for your information check with your</p><p>doctor before implementing any of the</p><p>tips that I&rsquo;m going to suggest in this</p><p>hour</p><p>so let&rsquo;s just Dive Right In Steve and</p><p>see what kind of questions that people</p><p>have this week hopefully they&rsquo;re easier</p><p>than last week yeah no kidding well uh</p><p>Happy Black Friday everyone uh we live</p><p>in a little development over the the</p><p>shopping area and uh boy they&rsquo;re just</p><p>jammed out there and I can always tell</p><p>that the joy of the holidays is with us</p><p>when you can hear the horns honking out</p><p>there they&rsquo;re all furious with each</p><p>other over parking spaces Etc and now to</p><p>social media Pamela from YouTube what</p><p>can I eat exactly on a Keto Plan I&rsquo;m so</p><p>hungry that I get frustrated because I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know exactly what will work and</p><p>what whoa doctor</p><p>well that&rsquo;s a broad question what to eat</p><p>well the fact that you&rsquo;re hungry tells</p><p>me you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not in ketosis you</p><p>definitely need to be in ketosis so the</p><p>the way that you get rid of The Hunger</p><p>So you&rsquo;re satisfied is you have to drop</p><p>your carbs really low so I would keep</p><p>your carbs under</p><p>20 to 30 grams per day so just don&rsquo;t eat</p><p>any carbs or starches or sugars and just</p><p>give it three days and uh that would be</p><p>the simplest uh answer to that question</p><p>um so now Bread&rsquo;s pasta syrup crackers</p><p>biscuits waffles or sugar and then your</p><p>body will uh adapt and it&rsquo;ll start</p><p>burning your own fat</p><p>and then um and then you can learn uh</p><p>the details of uh you know all the</p><p>different things that you</p><p>do to make it easier to make it healthy</p><p>on my website</p><p>um just type under I think Dr Berg and</p><p>then videos and I have step one two</p><p>three four it explains exactly what to</p><p>do but if you&rsquo;re hungry if you&rsquo;re</p><p>craving on keto all that means is your</p><p>your carbs aren&rsquo;t low enough or you&rsquo;re</p><p>eating too frequently and you just give</p><p>it time and your body will start to</p><p>shift over and uh magically your hunger</p><p>will go away</p><p>and so it&rsquo;ll make it easy to do very</p><p>good well Pamela there&rsquo;s good news</p><p>because one of our questions today</p><p>surrounds eggs and I think he&rsquo;s going to</p><p>let you have eggs delicious eggs that</p><p>can be part of your wonderful diet so</p><p>stay tuned for that question and Trey</p><p>from YouTube is it true that eating raw</p><p>salad can lead to a condition called oh</p><p>neurocularosis</p><p>neurocytic cirrhosis did I say that</p><p>closely does that make any sense to you</p><p>Doctor</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what that condition is</p><p>um but the only time you wouldn&rsquo;t want</p><p>to consume greens or vegetables is if</p><p>you have a gut issue which is then it&rsquo;s</p><p>usually caused by consuming things like</p><p>grains gluten omega-6 fatty acid type</p><p>stuff so um</p><p>in that case you&rsquo;re going to have a hard</p><p>time digesting um</p><p>vegetables because just the uh you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to be more sensitive to them</p><p>because the microbiome is disrupted</p><p>so anything related to that yeah you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to have to go carnivore for a</p><p>while because your gut has been</p><p>disrupted so you know</p><p>generally speaking for most people you</p><p>can you can do these vegetables but</p><p>there are people that can&rsquo;t tolerate</p><p>because as soon as it hits their gut you</p><p>either have you know small intestinal</p><p>bacteria overgrowth and that gives them</p><p>fiber or you don&rsquo;t have the microbes to</p><p>break down the fiber and it creates a</p><p>lot of gas and things like that</p><p>ouch well uh shrey we hope that you find</p><p>some relief from that and if you&rsquo;ve got</p><p>some more details</p><p>um uh you know please send that in and</p><p>we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t uh further explore</p><p>your condition okay what is the best</p><p>treatment this is from YouTube for</p><p>severe uh endometriosis I said that</p><p>right my 21 year old daughter is</p><p>struggling so much please help doctor</p><p>that usually involves</p><p>um the over consumption of estrogen and</p><p>that could come from birth control pills</p><p>it could come from consuming too much</p><p>hidden soy products like the soy protein</p><p>isolates in a lot of the veggie burgers</p><p>and and it&rsquo;s in protein weight loss</p><p>shakes and all these little places that</p><p>you wouldn&rsquo;t suspect them because the</p><p>the uh refined soy products kind of can</p><p>stir up your estrogen and kind of feed</p><p>that that um growth of the scar tissue</p><p>that&rsquo;s developing or extra tissues</p><p>growing in and around the uterus so you</p><p>know</p><p>anything you want to shrink like</p><p>something tissue growing you want to</p><p>decrease hormones that are anabolic so</p><p>you want to decrease the stress you want</p><p>to decrease the estrogen and Insulin so</p><p>you want to go on low carb and then also</p><p>there&rsquo;s some key foods to help regulate</p><p>your estrogens and that would be that</p><p>cruciferous vegetables that will help</p><p>you</p><p>um</p><p>is there a uh let&rsquo;s see it&rsquo;s uh is there</p><p>a peptase uh it&rsquo;s another enzyme you</p><p>could take to help with the scar tissue</p><p>but probably after all that being said</p><p>if you do uh prolonged fasting</p><p>that probably will help you most because</p><p>it&rsquo;ll</p><p>it&rsquo;ll get rid of um damaged proteins and</p><p>extra growths of like anytime you want</p><p>to shrink a tumor a polyp endometriosis</p><p>a fibroid you go on a fast like several</p><p>day fast watch how that affects you</p><p>that&rsquo;ll greatly help you</p><p>wonderful very encouraging why don&rsquo;t we</p><p>kick off with the first</p><p>post holiday question there it is</p><p>okay question what is the most</p><p>researched</p><p>anti-cancer food</p><p>I dig into it audience just like you dug</p><p>into the turkey yesterday and speaking</p><p>of tradition many people are have food</p><p>hangovers I&rsquo;m sure this morning not me I</p><p>just had Melba toast and warm water</p><p>that&rsquo;s all I had for Thanksgiving but</p><p>for the others good luck to you and then</p><p>yeah there&rsquo;s people that</p><p>um you know have different Traditions</p><p>around the world and let&rsquo;s find out</p><p>where they&rsquo;re at so let&rsquo;s say a good</p><p>morning to all our viewers uh joining</p><p>today from the UK Canada Mexico Jordan</p><p>Switzerland Italy Finland Ireland the</p><p>Philippines Romania Germany India</p><p>Algeria Bermuda the Netherlands Poland</p><p>Greece Ghana South Africa Nepal I</p><p>haven&rsquo;t heard from them for a while</p><p>Pakistan Taiwan the Czech Republic Egypt</p><p>Australia Brazil Trinidad and Tobago</p><p>Sweden France Uganda Bolivia Spain</p><p>Nigeria the United Arab Emirates</p><p>Scotland Cyprus Dubai Colombia Israel</p><p>Oman good grief Nicaragua Belgium can</p><p>you believe this Austria Peru Georgia</p><p>not that Georgia boss Bosnia Malaysia</p><p>Qatar Iran Bali and all across these</p><p>beautiful United States and I think</p><p>we&rsquo;re short a lot of turkeys this</p><p>morning so we&rsquo;ll give a moment of</p><p>silence to them</p><p>and then we&rsquo;ll move on let&rsquo;s see any</p><p>answers in the question not yet let&rsquo;s go</p><p>back to social media PN as he or she</p><p>calls themselves from YouTube what is</p><p>the role of probiotics in treating</p><p>eczema are they useful</p><p>absolutely because most of these</p><p>problems are related to your gut</p><p>so uh you definitely want to um use</p><p>probiotics and um anything with skin</p><p>related is going to be related to the</p><p>gut so there&rsquo;s inflammatory thing and</p><p>that you know there&rsquo;s various things</p><p>that happen when your skin starts to act</p><p>up like that and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p><p>treatments that people go after but the</p><p>first thing to do is to make clean up</p><p>the diet make sure that um</p><p>you&rsquo;re not eating anything to trigger</p><p>that and that could be gluten would be</p><p>at the top of the list and then anything</p><p>related to grains could do it as well</p><p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a gluten</p><p>you know intolerance or analogy and then</p><p>you start building up your pro your</p><p>friendly Flora</p><p>in your gut and then that&rsquo;s like a very</p><p>smart action but do it slowly because if</p><p>you overdo it you chances are you can</p><p>have an immune reaction</p><p>all right</p><p>let&rsquo;s move along here uh Hill dog from</p><p>YouTube drinking your lemon electrolyte</p><p>powder as we speak and loves it so thank</p><p>you for that thumbs up one of the many</p><p>great products I love it as well Lisa</p><p>from Facebook PCOS seems to be a</p><p>confusing topic what is the best</p><p>treatment if you are insulin resistant</p><p>well it&rsquo;s to do the ketogenic diet</p><p>intermittent fasting because that those</p><p>androgens that are</p><p>creating the problem are coming from</p><p>estrogen and estrogen too much estrogen</p><p>so we want to lower estrogen how do you</p><p>do that lower carbs lower your frequency</p><p>of eating</p><p>and then outside of vinegar with water</p><p>will help berberine cinnamon all these</p><p>things will help lower insulin</p><p>but that&rsquo;s what you you do to treat this</p><p>more than any any other action that will</p><p>help you</p><p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go to our</p><p>first uh contestant if we were to call</p><p>them that uh and Dave is interesting you</p><p>can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s going on with Dave but</p><p>he has a huge lineup of your products</p><p>and he said that&rsquo;s only about a third of</p><p>them and he&rsquo;s got one question for you</p><p>Dr Berg Dave you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p><p>yeah hi hi</p><p>um yeah thank you for taking the time on</p><p>this four day weekend for most people</p><p>and you&rsquo;re taking time out of your</p><p>schedule for us we appreciate that</p><p>um over the past several months I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been introducing keto to try to just</p><p>improve my my health in general and I</p><p>made a lot of progress on symptoms</p><p>especially like acid reflux not an issue</p><p>anymore got it fixed but</p><p>um having an awful lot of muscle</p><p>weakness and just generally very weak</p><p>and no Motion in a digestive system it&rsquo;s</p><p>just not moving it goes in and it sits</p><p>there</p><p>um and uh you know it&rsquo;s as if the sugar</p><p>burning has has been cut out but the fat</p><p>burning isn&rsquo;t kicked in and now I&rsquo;m not</p><p>burning anything except refuse you know</p><p>everything that&rsquo;s going through me is</p><p>just getting burned up because I have no</p><p>final movement so maybe I&rsquo;m just not</p><p>patient enough but what do I need to do</p><p>to try to get the digestive motion back</p><p>in play and the energy back into the</p><p>muscles because I just feel so weak all</p><p>the time</p><p>so so you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re backed up</p><p>you&rsquo;re constipated right</p><p>yeah very very few but not painful</p><p>constipation it&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p><p>feel plugged up but nothing&rsquo;s coming out</p><p>no no no movements okay and uh so it&rsquo;s</p><p>not painful but two things</p><p>okay just slow the two things uh that</p><p>relate to that both um the peristalsis</p><p>the pumping action of the colon plus</p><p>um also the the energy of the muscle</p><p>because it&rsquo;s a muscle related uh the</p><p>most likely deficiency of is B1 and I</p><p>would just try to add a lot of B1 to see</p><p>if that doesn&rsquo;t fix it because that&rsquo;s</p><p>really behind</p><p>um especially if you start keto and then</p><p>you start becoming backed up you might</p><p>just need B1 and that can solve</p><p>everything because that&rsquo;s really uh the</p><p>high level uh nutrient that feeds that</p><p>gives you energy that turns your food</p><p>into energy and that could be why you&rsquo;re</p><p>running into that problem then the</p><p>second thing I would look at is um</p><p>despite potassium as electrolyte that&rsquo;s</p><p>another thing because that&rsquo;s also</p><p>involved in energy powering the muscles</p><p>as well as the nervous system so those</p><p>are two things but in the meantime</p><p>you know sometimes those two things take</p><p>a while to to work on so in the meantime</p><p>I would probably find some type of uh</p><p>natural herb just as a a laxative to get</p><p>the bowels going temporarily until you</p><p>can figure this out because</p><p>um</p><p>that just being backed up can make you</p><p>tired as well</p><p>but</p><p>um the last thing I would recommend is</p><p>make sure you&rsquo;re consuming enough</p><p>sodium from the sea salts because</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re on keto a lot of</p><p>people don&rsquo;t have enough salt and they</p><p>just feel tired and they have weakness</p><p>in the muscle that&rsquo;s a a big one and of</p><p>course there&rsquo;s one more and I&rsquo;m not</p><p>telling you all of these are your</p><p>problem but it&rsquo;s going to be one of</p><p>these problems is that you may be low in</p><p>vitamin D which can create achiness in</p><p>the muscle constipation and definitely</p><p>fatigue as you go into the winter months</p><p>excellent</p><p>excellent so when you say a heavy dose</p><p>of vitamin B</p><p>are we talking three or four tablets a</p><p>day or something or whatever yeah</p><p>something like that yeah yeah</p><p>yeah yeah okay yeah that&rsquo;s great now</p><p>don&rsquo;t forget the uh recommendation for a</p><p>video Dave we&rsquo;re all very excited to</p><p>hear what you want to doctor bird to</p><p>produce</p><p>I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of people when</p><p>they see your videos they say aha well</p><p>that applies to me but well that applies</p><p>to me and you get torn in many many</p><p>directions and you play around and</p><p>you&rsquo;re bouncing around and sometimes</p><p>you&rsquo;d like to say stop reset could you</p><p>recommend a regime or something that</p><p>somebody could go through that has maybe</p><p>microbes totally imbalanced no bile uh</p><p>enzymes oh God that terrible leaky got</p><p>and everything okay we&rsquo;re gonna just</p><p>drink water and electrolytes three days</p><p>then we&rsquo;re gonna add a poached egg and</p><p>then the next day maybe an avocado and</p><p>and we&rsquo;ll put in you know somehow a</p><p>regime that&rsquo;s not going to kill somebody</p><p>but there&rsquo;s a good chance if they&rsquo;re</p><p>totally screwed up getting him towards</p><p>the direct path uh better path where</p><p>they could then make progress uh because</p><p>I find so many videos that make good</p><p>sense it&rsquo;s kind of hard</p><p>so basically what you&rsquo;re saying is</p><p>create a video that is very very simple</p><p>just telling people what to eat to get</p><p>started or did I get that wrong</p><p>more than that it&rsquo;s assuming the worst</p><p>that their system is totally screwed up</p><p>so you want to clear it out clear out</p><p>the biomes because you can&rsquo;t believe</p><p>that any of them are good you know and</p><p>don&rsquo;t assume they&rsquo;re making bile don&rsquo;t</p><p>assume they&rsquo;re making enzymes uh here&rsquo;s</p><p>a way to sort of start a system</p><p>yeah yeah so like the worst case</p><p>scenario you&rsquo;re if you have all these</p><p>problems what would be the thing you</p><p>would start on to be the crate the</p><p>greatest bang for your buck and just to</p><p>really turn things around</p><p>yeah yeah yeah yeah right I like that</p><p>less terrific good idea for a video</p><p>because I um I focused some ideas on</p><p>that</p><p>um so thank you yeah that&rsquo;s great thank</p><p>you so much uh Dave we appreciate it and</p><p>you know Dr Burke does not take those</p><p>things lightly you want wait and see</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to see something to get you</p><p>all revved up in in short order so let&rsquo;s</p><p>see why don&rsquo;t we uh answer the first</p><p>quiz question of the post Thanksgiving</p><p>holiday in America and it asks what is</p><p>the most researched anti-cancer food and</p><p>60 of a respondents said garlic 10 say</p><p>broccoli or broccoli Sprouts ten percent</p><p>say blueberries love them 10 say</p><p>turmeric and 10 say cruciferous veggies</p><p>okay the answer is um</p><p>um it&rsquo;s sulforaphane in broccoli Sprouts</p><p>okay so you know if you&rsquo;re not familiar</p><p>with that research there&rsquo;s so much so</p><p>much hardcore data in fact to the to the</p><p>degree that even</p><p>um</p><p>Hopkins if I&rsquo;m not mistaken try to get</p><p>the patents on Broccoli Sprouts because</p><p>they found wow this actually really does</p><p>work on cancer but since they were</p><p>denied you can&rsquo;t get patents on Broccoli</p><p>Sprouts</p><p>um because there&rsquo;s a lawsuit involved uh</p><p>it&rsquo;s a natural product so then they</p><p>basically</p><p>um you know you don&rsquo;t really hear much</p><p>about it as much as you should</p><p>um because there&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t really make</p><p>money on that product but think about</p><p>this Steve it&rsquo;s a product that costs</p><p>probably</p><p>two dollars and 35 cents for a pack you</p><p>know you&rsquo;re at the grocery store anyway</p><p>you might as well stick it in your cart</p><p>and just add it to the list because if</p><p>you have that a few times a week think</p><p>about the amount of um sulforaphane and</p><p>broccoli Sprouts is literally 10 to 50</p><p>times more than regular broccoli as far</p><p>as the amount of sulforaphane which has</p><p>um it causes the cancer cells to commit</p><p>suicide it um it turns on all sorts of</p><p>epigenetic things for your um</p><p>your immune system</p><p>I mean it the amount of things that it</p><p>does to help you prevent cancer is just</p><p>off the chart so it&rsquo;s a no-brainer it&rsquo;s</p><p>inexpensive and everyone could do it and</p><p>you won&rsquo;t even you just mix in with your</p><p>salad you won&rsquo;t even taste it so I will</p><p>be creating a video on this to</p><p>um also show you</p><p>how to even take it to the next level</p><p>and then triple that amount just by</p><p>doing a couple little easy things to</p><p>your broccoli sprouts and if you buy the</p><p>seeds and make it yourself you&rsquo;re</p><p>talking about pennies so no one can say</p><p>well I can&rsquo;t afford that well um yeah</p><p>you can</p><p>and if you combine that with fasting</p><p>and out of the park I think what I&rsquo;ll do</p><p>is I&rsquo;m going to create a video</p><p>worst case scenario you&rsquo;ve just been</p><p>diagnosed with stage four</p><p>um cancer and it&rsquo;s spreading into all</p><p>your organs</p><p>what would you do what would you eat</p><p>and to help turn things around because</p><p>that way we can um</p><p>you know give people</p><p>um the worst case scenario so if anyone</p><p>is not that bad they can eat that diet</p><p>and really improve but it&rsquo;s always you</p><p>know it&rsquo;s always good to learn what to</p><p>do to have like the the most powerful</p><p>impact to these these bad diseases you</p><p>know I think it&rsquo;s important to know that</p><p>no that&rsquo;s encouraging and so by the way</p><p>just for clarification is that</p><p>broccoletti is it letter or whatever or</p><p>Sprouts uh</p><p>no it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s broccoli sprouts and it&rsquo;s a</p><p>baby form of the broccoli plant and what</p><p>is fascinating is that you have this</p><p>super survival</p><p>um thing that happens with this broccoli</p><p>sprout and with a lot of other Sprouts</p><p>is that when they start getting like the</p><p>four day old little Sprout that&rsquo;s when</p><p>you have the release that&rsquo;s most of</p><p>these phytonutrients which are defense</p><p>compounds protective compounds that um</p><p>can greatly</p><p>um help the survival of that growing</p><p>baby and um and then as it gets older</p><p>you it loses the strength of those</p><p>compounds so what we can do is we can</p><p>just capture that</p><p>and eat those and some people are going</p><p>to say</p><p>oh I heard someone say that these toxic</p><p>chemicals in Plants will are very bad</p><p>for our body and they can give us cancer</p><p>right or give us problems</p><p>um if you actually read the research on</p><p>this um</p><p>sulforaphane is selective which means it</p><p>affects certain cells but not other</p><p>cells it&rsquo;s selective to cancer cells so</p><p>you are not going to ever develop cancer</p><p>by eating broccoli Sprouts it&rsquo;s not</p><p>going to happen</p><p>just the reverse that&rsquo;s wonderful well</p><p>that&rsquo;s very encouraging I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>start filling my basket with it let&rsquo;s</p><p>see so how about</p><p>we kick off uh the next speaking of eggs</p><p>the next question here you are Dr Berg</p><p>okay so why are egg yolks so uh powerful</p><p>for brain power</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking primarily</p><p>memory Focus</p><p>alertness concentration</p><p>and the ability to learn</p><p>all right dig into it audience we know</p><p>egg yolks will help you but why what&rsquo;s</p><p>in the egg yolks that can help you</p><p>interesting and we&rsquo;re going to find out</p><p>okay confessions again here Nikki from</p><p>YouTube since I started fasting and</p><p>clean eating my blood pressure is the</p><p>lowest it&rsquo;s ever been and my liver is no</p><p>longer considered fatty thank you Dr</p><p>bird what wonderfulness it was good for</p><p>you Nikki awesome glad you&rsquo;re coming</p><p>around let&rsquo;s see in uh</p><p>passing Paya isn&rsquo;t this person&rsquo;s name</p><p>somehow from Facebook how about polyps</p><p>how can we keep them from coming back</p><p>very well there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re</p><p>eating that is stimulating the growth of</p><p>those many tumors and so first of all</p><p>you need to do like a three-day fast to</p><p>make them go bye-bye okay and then you</p><p>need to stay and change your diet onto</p><p>keto low carb because insulin is an</p><p>anabolic hormone coming from the carbs</p><p>and then also of course they have a</p><p>clean the healthy version of the</p><p>ketogenic diet so that way we&rsquo;re adding</p><p>uh more</p><p>um vegetables that have factors in them</p><p>to help</p><p>um</p><p>clean up these polyps and kind of make</p><p>sure they don&rsquo;t come back it boils down</p><p>to the basic</p><p>eating plan</p><p>and so</p><p>I have this on my site you can just</p><p>watch the videos as a sweet as a</p><p>sequence of video step one two three</p><p>four and we&rsquo;ll show you how to do it if</p><p>you&rsquo;re new to my channel</p><p>very good okay uh let&rsquo;s go to YouTube</p><p>Gordon is asking what is better for</p><p>keeping your arteries clean flaxseed oil</p><p>or uh hang on it just jumped on me</p><p>flaxseed oil or ground flaxseed</p><p>if I only have that</p><p>um choice</p><p>um</p><p>it depends on how fresh the oil is but I</p><p>think I would go with the ground seed</p><p>because it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re going to get it&rsquo;s</p><p>more of a whole whole food and you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to have slightly a different more</p><p>more com it&rsquo;s a more you&rsquo;re eating it as</p><p>a whole food but it&rsquo;s ground down of</p><p>course make sure it&rsquo;s like uh fermented</p><p>or sprouted sprouted would be good that</p><p>way you&rsquo;ll actually have less Inhibitors</p><p>but there are some good properties for</p><p>flax flax seeds which do various things</p><p>um</p><p>but you know as far as your arteries go</p><p>uh there are better things to focus on</p><p>uh one is if you think about what</p><p>happens to your arteries when you start</p><p>developing plaque is you have a</p><p>combination of fibrous tissue Scar</p><p>Tissue inflammation and calcium and</p><p>biofilms which are part of the calcium</p><p>mechanism which you have this uh kind of</p><p>a disinfection going on deep inside</p><p>which could be</p><p>um part of a whole mixture but here&rsquo;s</p><p>the thing that&rsquo;s interesting</p><p>um</p><p>this whole thing started after some some</p><p>rep after some original root cause and</p><p>now the body is trying to repair</p><p>so when you see this plaquing you know</p><p>we think oh my gosh why do I have this</p><p>this is terrible but it&rsquo;s part of the</p><p>repair process</p><p>so why is your body doing this because</p><p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s not looking long term</p><p>it&rsquo;s just like let&rsquo;s patch up this</p><p>damage thing right now so we have this</p><p>ongoing inflammation we have um</p><p>fibrous tissue just like even you injure</p><p>yourself in your joints or something you</p><p>could develop Scar Tissue your body&rsquo;s</p><p>not thinking long-term function it&rsquo;s</p><p>just trying to mobilize the thing right</p><p>now it&rsquo;s trying to put a patch on it</p><p>your body&rsquo;s trying to help you the most</p><p>important thing to do is to understand</p><p>the these triggers in the original cause</p><p>and make sure that&rsquo;s corrected and</p><p>that&rsquo;s corrected usually from the diet</p><p>getting rid of the omega-6 fatty acids</p><p>getting rid of the oxidizers like sugars</p><p>and refined carbs and Grains and things</p><p>like that that irritate the lining of</p><p>your arteries</p><p>[Music]</p><p>um</p><p>the junk Foods that&rsquo;s like the most</p><p>important versus adding flaxseed oil</p><p>which on top of a an incomplete diet is</p><p>not going to help you</p><p>so I just wanted to make that point</p><p>very good all right uh we&rsquo;ve got some</p><p>the lightning Squad out there and</p><p>answering our various questions and this</p><p>is about wire eggs so powerful for your</p><p>brain power and 75 say it&rsquo;s the choline</p><p>in the eggs 20 say it&rsquo;s omega-3</p><p>and uh five percent say it&rsquo;s just the</p><p>healthy fats</p><p>okay well the answer is choline choline</p><p>is not just going to help you prevent a</p><p>fatty liver</p><p>but it&rsquo;s also going to turn into</p><p>acetylcholine which is the most</p><p>important neurotransmitter in your brain</p><p>that gives you that cognitive power</p><p>but it also helps your um your</p><p>parasympathetic nervous system which is</p><p>all about rest and digestion</p><p>so it&rsquo;s really like spreading out all</p><p>over the place so in one of the videos I</p><p>will release</p><p>possibly this next week is going to be</p><p>on all the different ways you can</p><p>increase acetylcholine in your diet and</p><p>in your life and so it&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>very</p><p>powerful but if you don&rsquo;t know what</p><p>choline does</p><p>um</p><p>that might be a barrier so it&rsquo;s if you</p><p>want to improve your cognitive function</p><p>then watch that video</p><p>but um egg yolks are a great source but</p><p>there&rsquo;s other sources as well</p><p>and they&rsquo;re delicious okay nirja from</p><p>YouTube what are the best foods to</p><p>promote hair growth</p><p>it depends on the cause again so if</p><p>you&rsquo;re um if you&rsquo;re if it&rsquo;s autoimmune</p><p>then you might need some herb okay</p><p>um</p><p>that will inhibit certain hormonal</p><p>factors</p><p>um if it&rsquo;s uh uh a micronutrient</p><p>deficiency like Trace mirrors like zinc</p><p>zinc iron leaving calcium which is not a</p><p>trace mineral it&rsquo;s a regular mineral</p><p>um those are real powerful in helping</p><p>the stimulation of the hair growth and</p><p>then the other one is the B vitamins B</p><p>vitamins um uh promote your hair and</p><p>that does include biotin but the rest of</p><p>the B complex as well but</p><p>I always want to um you should always</p><p>ask like when did it start what happened</p><p>just before it was a distress event it</p><p>could be stress</p><p>that high cortisol can literally make</p><p>you lose your hair but here&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>um by the time you lose your hair</p><p>um it&rsquo;s a delayed response so you might</p><p>not connect the dots so let&rsquo;s say you go</p><p>through this massive stress loss now</p><p>like a loss or something and then</p><p>three months later your hair falls out</p><p>you&rsquo;re not connecting the dots but there</p><p>is a delay a lot of times so</p><p>um</p><p>so that&rsquo;s not even a nutritional</p><p>handling it&rsquo;s like you have to handle</p><p>the um the stress so not everything</p><p>comes down to diet it&rsquo;s uh you have</p><p>stress you also have infections</p><p>but the diet actually helps you resist</p><p>stress and helps you resist infections</p><p>and microbes that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a big</p><p>foundational part but you do need other</p><p>things too</p><p>very good well in our Green Room sort of</p><p>is Christine and she&rsquo;s in Clearwater but</p><p>I&rsquo;m worried about her I see the road</p><p>flying by so we&rsquo;re not going to take</p><p>your question while you&rsquo;re driving so I</p><p>want you to pull over and as soon as I</p><p>see that you&rsquo;re safe and there&rsquo;s no</p><p>buildings going by then then we will now</p><p>we can&rsquo;t hear you right now uh Christine</p><p>so pull over and then we&rsquo;ll uh we&rsquo;ll</p><p>take your call in the meantime pulling</p><p>over right now</p><p>you know what she&rsquo;s not driving okay I</p><p>got it let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s put her on hang on</p><p>just I said boy she is really insistent</p><p>there okay I got it uh Christine you&rsquo;re</p><p>not driving forgive me your camera&rsquo;s</p><p>backwards so it looked like you were</p><p>go ahead with your question Christine</p><p>my question is do do my dietary Insanity</p><p>for 69 years I&rsquo;ve ended up with extreme</p><p>insulin resistance and I&rsquo;ve been using</p><p>keto and intermittent fasting to handle</p><p>it but now I&rsquo;ve lost too much weight</p><p>and I want to know besides keto balls</p><p>keto bombs and nuts what can I start</p><p>eating so I don&rsquo;t lose any more weight</p><p>yeah it really has the as boils down to</p><p>calories and unfortunately the the food</p><p>that has the most dense calories is fats</p><p>so maybe you can um not necessarily just</p><p>do keto bombs but do more olive oil on</p><p>your salad do um</p><p>um</p><p>a little bit larger you know serving</p><p>sizes of your like your salmon or your</p><p>protein that type of thing and and then</p><p>a bigger salad these are all things that</p><p>I would do but I do have the same</p><p>problem how do you handle some of this</p><p>losing too much weight</p><p>um you know you just have to make sure</p><p>because so many people are Downing the</p><p>uh a little bit too many keto snacks and</p><p>they may are doubting too much butter</p><p>for example but one thing I will do</p><p>Christine is I found a local</p><p>farm that sells me um raw milk and raw</p><p>cream I don&rsquo;t buy the raw milk I buy the</p><p>raw cream and I get a whole quart okay</p><p>and I consume and some some people are</p><p>going to go are you crazy I consume a</p><p>whole cork a week</p><p>and um as my little dessert I&rsquo;ll put uh</p><p>I think uh some sugar-free chocolate</p><p>chips right they&rsquo;re keto friendly I&rsquo;ll</p><p>put some uh</p><p>macadamia nuts or maybe even a walnuts</p><p>or sometimes pecans as my nut and I&rsquo;ll</p><p>mix that with this raw cream okay and I</p><p>will consume that as my little dessert</p><p>and boy does that give me extra calories</p><p>and a pleasure moment so</p><p>I might do that for a while then I might</p><p>switch it up and I might not do that but</p><p>um it&rsquo;s a lot of fat but I&rsquo;m able to</p><p>digest it and handle it um</p><p>um I&rsquo;m not I don&rsquo;t have any bad effects</p><p>off that at all so</p><p>all right well thank you Christine and</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry for accusing you of driving</p><p>that was an awful thing but we just we</p><p>just worry about our guests we want to</p><p>make sure they&rsquo;re safe so anyway thank</p><p>you thank you you bet thanks for joining</p><p>us and get back in touch with us and let</p><p>us know uh how your health continues to</p><p>improve well you know she can drive with</p><p>her knee uh Steve you know I drive you</p><p>know I could steer with my knee all the</p><p>time and I can do two things at once so</p><p>I&rsquo;m just being sarcastic well I can</p><p>drive with my knee but you see I&rsquo;ve</p><p>lived a full life so it really doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>matter at this point uh you know I&rsquo;ve</p><p>already I&rsquo;ve already won the game so</p><p>let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s move on here and thanks</p><p>again uh Christine and let&rsquo;s see</p><p>um</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think we asked this no here go</p><p>ahead doc here&rsquo;s the next one</p><p>okay so which type of stress is the most</p><p>damaging to your immune system out of</p><p>all the types of stress out there</p><p>okay and Terry is up updated as usual</p><p>when we we do a shout out for the</p><p>viewers others say what about us so</p><p>Lithuania Ukraine uh Bangladesh Kenya</p><p>United Arab Emirates Sudan and and</p><p>Tahiti for goodness sakes all right well</p><p>welcome folks glad you&rsquo;re uh listening</p><p>Reuben from YouTube what are the best</p><p>foods to reverse elevated enzyme levels</p><p>in the liver</p><p>yeah well there uh if you take</p><p>um</p><p>milk thistle that&rsquo;s just an herb but as</p><p>far as foods go</p><p>um you know as soon as you start cutting</p><p>out the carbs</p><p>um you can have apple cider vinegar with</p><p>your water and you start doing the</p><p>cruciferous vegetables and you start to</p><p>put things Back in Balance those liver</p><p>enzymes will go go away it just tells us</p><p>that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re stressing out the</p><p>liver you&rsquo;re having too much uh</p><p>inflammatory foods</p><p>um so it&rsquo;s a combination of</p><p>a good quality vegetables with good</p><p>quality protein with good quality fat</p><p>and then no extra</p><p>things</p><p>um on top of that and doing intermittent</p><p>fasting that should help you</p><p>um there is some</p><p>another thing that you can do as a</p><p>remedy</p><p>um niacin niacin for example which is</p><p>fantastic for your heart and your</p><p>arteries</p><p>also just happens to be very beneficial</p><p>to your liver too and then the other</p><p>product that&rsquo;s really good for high</p><p>liver enzymes is tadka tadka okay that&rsquo;s</p><p>a type of bile salt that&rsquo;s um very</p><p>fascinating what it does</p><p>a lot of people even Healthcare</p><p>practitioners that even doctors have</p><p>never heard about it</p><p>if you watch my video in Tucka</p><p>um I talk about all the different</p><p>things that it does</p><p>it&rsquo;s fascinating I don&rsquo;t recommend any</p><p>brand names so just search out a good</p><p>one based on reviews or something and</p><p>then take that but it&rsquo;s like if in doubt</p><p>if you can&rsquo;t seem to</p><p>figure out what&rsquo;s going on with you or</p><p>you have some weird symptoms it&rsquo;s not</p><p>going away add a little Tut cup and</p><p>Watch What Happens because that&rsquo;s like</p><p>kind of my go-to for</p><p>really tough cases all right very good</p><p>now Rachel is shooting back from</p><p>Facebook she goes so if your aorta is</p><p>calcified should I stop eating egg yolks</p><p>she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s after the egg yolks</p><p>um honestly um</p><p>there&rsquo;s kind of a yes and no</p><p>if you have some type of genetic</p><p>thing that kind of uh like you can&rsquo;t</p><p>you can&rsquo;t get rid of cholesterol for</p><p>example or you can&rsquo;t or you have</p><p>things that are um</p><p>an allergy to eggs or something that can</p><p>tell you that you know that could be bad</p><p>then of course yes but generally</p><p>speaking</p><p>um those eggs are not going to worsen</p><p>the situation they&rsquo;re going to help you</p><p>because it&rsquo;s going to help the ins the</p><p>inside of the arteries even think about</p><p>this some of the key nutrients for the</p><p>heart would be vitamin E vitamin D</p><p>vitamin K2 in order to build up</p><p>uh</p><p>the bile that helps you absorb that you</p><p>need cholesterol and eggs are a great</p><p>great source of cholesterol plus they</p><p>have uh choline they have lecithin which</p><p>is the antidote to cholesterol so</p><p>um</p><p>from my viewpoint eating egg yolks is</p><p>going to help you more than hurt you so</p><p>it&rsquo;s a good good source of protein and a</p><p>lot of other nutrients</p><p>all right very good now I&rsquo;m concerned</p><p>with Matthew he&rsquo;s got a tough condition</p><p>from YouTube is there a good way to</p><p>battle chronic fatigue from MS</p><p>yeah I think um the most important thing</p><p>would be to do is to really raise up</p><p>your vitamin D levels because</p><p>um</p><p>all these autoimmune diseases especially</p><p>Ms</p><p>um</p><p>are</p><p>have inflammation as part of their</p><p>mix-up right and if you can just</p><p>not necessarily focus on trading in the</p><p>disease but just dropping the</p><p>inflammation</p><p>you can literally put the person in a</p><p>state where they don&rsquo;t even feel like</p><p>they have MS anymore they might be have</p><p>a mess but they don&rsquo;t feel it because</p><p>the inflammation is gone the damage from</p><p>autoimmune is the collateral damage from</p><p>your own immune system attacking itself</p><p>so why not get rid of that inflammation</p><p>and the best way to do it is to take</p><p>vitamin D you could do a drug with um</p><p>drug wise with prednisone but you end up</p><p>destroying the immune system so vitamin</p><p>D is like a natural prednisone without</p><p>the side effects</p><p>so I would do higher amounts I would do</p><p>30 or 40 000 I use every day</p><p>and um</p><p>so that&rsquo;s what I would do and that</p><p>probably is going to help increase your</p><p>energy too because when you have this</p><p>immune reaction this inflammation and</p><p>you got these releases of histamines and</p><p>all sorts of things those are fatigue</p><p>poisons it&rsquo;s going to make you tired so</p><p>that could be a situation so but I do</p><p>have a video in Ms that you should watch</p><p>for more details yeah Matthew please do</p><p>and we&rsquo;re all rooting for you and hope</p><p>that you can get some relief from those</p><p>those symptoms okay we&rsquo;ve got an answer</p><p>uh</p><p>already as usual for the latest question</p><p>which asks which type of stress is the</p><p>most damaging to your immune system and</p><p>60 68 of our respondents say emotional</p><p>stress 20 say oxidative stress and 12</p><p>say stress caused by injuries pain or</p><p>illness</p><p>okay so the very specific type of stress</p><p>is bereavement which is uh a loss of a</p><p>loved one that type of stress</p><p>compared to any other stress</p><p>is has the greatest impact on your</p><p>immune system and if you study that</p><p>stress that type of stress or just look</p><p>at the type of research they do a lot of</p><p>it is connected to your immune system</p><p>because think about your shocking the</p><p>immune system and you&rsquo;re paralyzing the</p><p>immune system so you basically</p><p>inactivate the immune system and all</p><p>sorts of things can then happen as a</p><p>result of that including autoimmune so a</p><p>lot of people develop these conditions</p><p>after that loss so you know I</p><p>um</p><p>you got to do whatever you can to</p><p>you know</p><p>get your mind off that loss</p><p>by doing long walks in nature and just</p><p>you know try not to remind yourself of</p><p>that loss and just to kind of cope and</p><p>get yourself back but that is the most</p><p>damaging stress out of anything</p><p>well you know it&rsquo;s interesting well no</p><p>it&rsquo;s actually awful but you know you&rsquo;ll</p><p>hear of some wonderful couple where one</p><p>of them dies and shortly thereafter the</p><p>other one passes too I mean I wonder</p><p>probably roughing them up there&rsquo;s an</p><p>increased risk of uh dying</p><p>from that have being in that state</p><p>absolutely yeah so yeah I mean even even</p><p>I had a pet llama okay I had two pet</p><p>llamas and um one died</p><p>and they always kind of come prepared</p><p>and the other one died within</p><p>a week</p><p>I mean like what are the odds of that</p><p>but they they don&rsquo;t tend to do well</p><p>individually they they like each other</p><p>so</p><p>that was wild</p><p>wow interesting okay let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s uh</p><p>let&rsquo;s go back to our green room and</p><p>Majid if you would flip on your camera</p><p>we&rsquo;re going to take you up next with uh</p><p>Dr Berg boy he&rsquo;s lickety-split you must</p><p>work in a broadcast business okay and</p><p>here let&rsquo;s see now let me do my part and</p><p>uh do you see me yeah now we do look at</p><p>that here you&rsquo;re on the air thank you so</p><p>great for for the time you gave me your</p><p>team as well so I had a gallbladder</p><p>attack in last month and and half three</p><p>times I&rsquo;ve been to ER they took the</p><p>blood test and the all the scan uh</p><p>ultrasound</p><p>City and MRI</p><p>so they didn&rsquo;t find anything in the in</p><p>this ultrasound but in the MRI anal CTS</p><p>can they found something common which is</p><p>the I can read from here</p><p>um</p><p>non-distended goal rather with the few</p><p>small gallstone diffuse gallbladder wall</p><p>thickening that was the the gist of the</p><p>the result so a German surgeon wanted to</p><p>remove my gallbladder I said no I&rsquo;m not</p><p>ready yet I just want to study this is</p><p>more so the question I had what caused</p><p>the gallbladder thickening uh and and</p><p>and what is there any diet medication</p><p>um</p><p>solution so so</p><p>um the thing that um you should watch my</p><p>videos on is uh the term is choleostasis</p><p>that is a kind of a sluggishness of your</p><p>bile it&rsquo;s not moving it&rsquo;s thickened</p><p>start developing tiny little stones and</p><p>in the bile ducts and um they can</p><p>eventually start to cause distention of</p><p>those Ducks and the what causes that is</p><p>a deficiency of bile salts</p><p>so we get this sludge going on so we</p><p>need to add more of those bile salts as</p><p>an immediate thing and that the best</p><p>remedy for that is tadka okay it&rsquo;s a</p><p>product it&rsquo;s a type of bile salt you can</p><p>get take two an empty stomach twice a</p><p>day okay Monday morning one afternoon</p><p>okay you do that for a while that&rsquo;ll</p><p>make you feel better and then you need</p><p>to start to learn more about the foods</p><p>that help produce bile and things that</p><p>inhibit bile for example you may not</p><p>have enough microbiome to make your</p><p>secondary bile it could be coming from</p><p>your gut or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve been in a</p><p>low-fat diet because you need fat to</p><p>stimulate the release about or it could</p><p>be a fatty liver which means you need to</p><p>go on the ketogen diet or it could be</p><p>that</p><p>um you&rsquo;re eating Foods stimulating</p><p>estrogen that could block it or Foods</p><p>increasing cortisol or a medication that</p><p>gives you cortisol there&rsquo;s so many</p><p>different reasons that could</p><p>limit your production of making bile</p><p>that&rsquo;s what you need to learn see where</p><p>you need to focus on but in the meantime</p><p>tadka would be the answer because once</p><p>they take out the gallbladder it&rsquo;s too</p><p>late they can&rsquo;t put it back in and then</p><p>what happens I mean now we have a</p><p>usually an even more deficiency of bile</p><p>and yeah you won&rsquo;t have the same problem</p><p>but it converts to a different problem</p><p>you can&rsquo;t absorb the fat soluble</p><p>vitamins from your food so that&rsquo;s the</p><p>question that um you know a solution</p><p>should not involve giving you another</p><p>big problem you know</p><p>thank you so much can I add something</p><p>more if I have time so I just I watch</p><p>your video and I I ordered.com and also</p><p>a stone breaker</p><p>and the gold Brad is support from your</p><p>product and the milk thistle and also</p><p>Colleen I studied for four days</p><p>and I felt so pain in my body I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know maybe dosage was a problem</p><p>and then I stopped so I thought maybe I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t take too much acid</p><p>um I I&rsquo;m scared so I stopped um those</p><p>tatka and also the milk Crystal</p><p>um so I don&rsquo;t know uh maybe the I don&rsquo;t</p><p>have the dried dosage or but when I stop</p><p>the pain now I still have pain here but</p><p>it&rsquo;s going already</p><p>this is the typical thing that a lot of</p><p>people do including myself a long time</p><p>ago is I&rsquo;ll start ordering a whole bunch</p><p>of things and take them all at once and</p><p>then if it doesn&rsquo;t work I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>what&rsquo;s causing what so I would add one</p><p>thing at a time to find out what the</p><p>problem is and I would start with tadka</p><p>see if that doesn&rsquo;t help you okay if</p><p>that if that um helps you good then</p><p>maybe put it to the side and take the</p><p>next thing because you can get</p><p>information</p><p>um on what&rsquo;s wrong by let&rsquo;s say you you</p><p>took the stone breaker for example which</p><p>by the way is more for kidney stones not</p><p>gallstones so that may not be the right</p><p>thing you need and it could create a</p><p>problem</p><p>um but um</p><p>in addition to those things</p><p>make sure that you um</p><p>get your diet correct corrected and work</p><p>on that and also learn my massage</p><p>technique which you&rsquo;re massaging both</p><p>the left and right side underneath your</p><p>uh rib cage at least to give yourself</p><p>some relief right now and then lastly</p><p>and this is something I&rsquo;ll be doing a</p><p>lot of videos on</p><p>um</p><p>okay</p><p>and I I&rsquo;m and I&rsquo;m not going to even</p><p>recommend that people go get a DNA test</p><p>right now because</p><p>um I want to create videos to teach</p><p>people how to read them or at least</p><p>understand the basics because if you get</p><p>a DNA test it&rsquo;s great but who&rsquo;s going to</p><p>interpret it and are they interpreting a</p><p>way that you understand it and does it</p><p>all correlate with your symptoms so</p><p>that&rsquo;s the area that I&rsquo;m I want to go</p><p>into because</p><p>I wish I had that tool in practice when</p><p>I would evaluate people to see let&rsquo;s say</p><p>we could find something going on with a</p><p>weakness within your um</p><p>something with your liver or or the bile</p><p>ducts that then will give us the</p><p>solution a DNA test would be very</p><p>valuable and your ability to process</p><p>fats for example and um</p><p>um give you it can give us a lot of data</p><p>so stay tuned for more of that but</p><p>um that&rsquo;s something down the road that</p><p>um be good to take to look at your DNA</p><p>to go oh</p><p>no wonder</p><p>I&rsquo;ll give you just a quick simple</p><p>example</p><p>um on my DNA test one of the problems I</p><p>had was</p><p>um I have genes that are um</p><p>can handle a lot of</p><p>intense exercise like a real explosive</p><p>powerful exercise</p><p>but I also on the flip side have a</p><p>weakness with generating a tremendous</p><p>amount of inflammation if I over train</p><p>so</p><p>what does that mean it means that</p><p>when I do workouts and exercise man I</p><p>should not I should be very cautious</p><p>about over training or else I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>be down for the count for several days</p><p>in a row which is totally what happens</p><p>so it gives you data to help you design</p><p>your own exercise program to prevent</p><p>problems from over training and all the</p><p>things that I did wrong for many many</p><p>years and it&rsquo;s now it all makes sense so</p><p>when you start learning about your DNA</p><p>you can learn about</p><p>um how to better optimize your life</p><p>basically well that&rsquo;s great well listen</p><p>Majid thank you so much and we would</p><p>really love to hear what your research</p><p>finds so as the doctor says one at a</p><p>time and let&rsquo;s find out uh what is</p><p>kicking you in the side there and I&rsquo;m</p><p>sure that would help the thousands of</p><p>people that that are watching as well</p><p>and appreciate you being on with us now</p><p>let&rsquo;s see we better get to our final uh</p><p>respondent to the quiz not to the quiz</p><p>question but to being on a line where do</p><p>we go</p><p>um Denny is that you oh there she is</p><p>okay stand by let me get her up here and</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to unmute you and I hope you</p><p>do too and you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p><p>okay well thank you</p><p>um</p><p>um I had a prophylactic gastrectomy six</p><p>months ago because of a diffuse stomach</p><p>cancer my brother had and he had it was</p><p>discovered he has the gene cdh1</p><p>both he uh both his daughter and I</p><p>tested positive and without it our risk</p><p>was very high to develop a few stomach</p><p>cancers so I had a gastrectomy a</p><p>prophylactic gastrectomy and about six</p><p>months ago and about seven weeks ago my</p><p>stools started floating</p><p>not always but most of the time and it</p><p>turns out that fat malabsorption can be</p><p>an issue in month five or six post</p><p>gastrectomy yeah</p><p>um</p><p>yeah and I&rsquo;m doing a lot of research</p><p>um I I did the surgeon did say I had</p><p>fatty liver my liver enzymes are very</p><p>slightly elevated</p><p>so I&rsquo;m eating beets and carrot and apple</p><p>and radish and dandelion and my glucose</p><p>is a little bit High because for a long</p><p>time I couldn&rsquo;t really eat cruciferous</p><p>vegetables</p><p>because my body had to be adjusting</p><p>now I can so my question is all of the</p><p>things that you just said to the</p><p>previous person using tadka or</p><p>um you know um it&rsquo;s not clear to me and</p><p>I it&rsquo;s been hard to get help from my</p><p>gastroenterologist and the surgeon about</p><p>whether I can use those kinds of</p><p>remedies without a stomach and of course</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have any hydrochloric acid</p><p>so that was my Steve said ask one</p><p>question so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s my one</p><p>question okay yeah so that&rsquo;s a little</p><p>that&rsquo;s a quite a complexity because</p><p>um</p><p>here we here we don&rsquo;t have</p><p>um</p><p>the function of the stomach and we&rsquo;re</p><p>trying to digest so there&rsquo;s um there&rsquo;s</p><p>triggers in the stomach that trigger the</p><p>release of bile so right there we</p><p>probably don&rsquo;t have the the triggering</p><p>of this bile so now the stool is going</p><p>to float because you&rsquo;re not breaking</p><p>down fats uh we don&rsquo;t have the</p><p>hydrochloric acid so we can&rsquo;t break down</p><p>protein and we don&rsquo;t have the</p><p>hydrochloric acid so it&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>really hard to kill microbes that are</p><p>coming in from this side that could end</p><p>up a problem down the road so it&rsquo;s going</p><p>to be kind of like a a testing</p><p>um to test your own dosages and</p><p>different things to see what&rsquo;s going to</p><p>work for you you&rsquo;re probably going to</p><p>have to with like with your food</p><p>um maybe add a little betaine</p><p>hydrochloride with your food</p><p>eat more</p><p>um like maybe some sauerkraut it would</p><p>probably be very very good because</p><p>that&rsquo;s fermented so it&rsquo;s easier to</p><p>digest right it has more enzymes more</p><p>microbes more everything</p><p>um versus something else that is we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to acquire a tremendous amount of</p><p>enzymes and help from your GI system</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to eat food like</p><p>Protein that&rsquo;s easier to digest like</p><p>maybe egg or seafood for example maybe</p><p>good but make sure it doesn&rsquo;t have any</p><p>microbes in it and then so kind of</p><p>probably you&rsquo;re gonna have to add get</p><p>some help and test it out with what&rsquo;s</p><p>going to work better maybe add some</p><p>tadka some betaine hydrochloride maybe</p><p>some enzymes with certain foods see how</p><p>that does make some adjustments because</p><p>um you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p><p>stay right what did you say right after</p><p>tadka</p><p>um betaine hydrochloride</p><p>yeah protein hydrochloride is like is</p><p>like the best um substitute for</p><p>hydrochloric acid</p><p>so you can take that right before you</p><p>eat and you can and it&rsquo;ll help it&rsquo;ll</p><p>help break down that food the other</p><p>thing that some people have to do</p><p>especially if they don&rsquo;t have a stomach</p><p>is</p><p>they they end up becoming deficient in</p><p>some amino acid because they don&rsquo;t get</p><p>the complete breakdown so</p><p>um a good amino acid supplement might be</p><p>necessary</p><p>um</p><p>and I have something on my website on</p><p>that too that can give you those amino</p><p>acids to make sure at least that you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting all the essential ones</p><p>um</p><p>to make the proteins which is going to</p><p>be very important so</p><p>um</p><p>and then also</p><p>um</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s always like it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to try to figure out how to</p><p>get um those building blocks</p><p>um as the bare minimum without having to</p><p>do all the work to break it down</p><p>um so something that is fermented is a</p><p>good idea something that is maybe</p><p>Blended like if you took a some of the</p><p>cruciferous vegetables like kale and</p><p>you&rsquo;ve blended it up and let it um</p><p>kind of break down that way the these</p><p>things might just help you so</p><p>those are a couple tips but I think</p><p>takka is going to be helping and you</p><p>take uh take that until your stool does</p><p>no longer floats okay and then one last</p><p>tip as an extra bonus that there&rsquo;s no</p><p>charge for this one</p><p>um probably a good good probiotic</p><p>because if you&rsquo;re not getting the</p><p>digestion up here then might as well</p><p>um strengthen the lower part of your</p><p>digestive system so it can assist and</p><p>adapt to take over</p><p>in the in the large bowel it&rsquo;s great</p><p>well Danny thank you so much and boy we</p><p>have some real life struggles today and</p><p>uh Denny that&rsquo;s certainly a big one and</p><p>I&rsquo;m glad that you uh we&rsquo;re all glad that</p><p>you probably uh curtailed any cancer</p><p>development uh but boy what a struggle</p><p>after the fact so please do keep in</p><p>touch with us as we ask all the other</p><p>folks let&rsquo;s see if we can knock out some</p><p>of the a couple more quick questions the</p><p>true false you cannot you can hit that</p><p>fast coffee with caffeine gives your</p><p>body more energy is that true or false</p><p>please oh please oh please</p><p>chugging that stuff all right let&rsquo;s go</p><p>back to social media uh Peter from</p><p>YouTube can you share thoughts on the</p><p>production of excess earwax particularly</p><p>in Western countries</p><p>um</p><p>you know I I don&rsquo;t um there&rsquo;s not a lot</p><p>of research on that I don&rsquo;t have an</p><p>answer for that one I know some people</p><p>have that and I have not figured that</p><p>one out so that&rsquo;ll be something on the</p><p>list to keep looking at to see if I</p><p>could eventually see if there&rsquo;s anything</p><p>that I find but I just have not I never</p><p>found anything on the earwax problem all</p><p>right</p><p>well that is an individual thing let&rsquo;s</p><p>see</p><p>um</p><p>oh this poor this happens a lot Hall</p><p>from YouTube can we take protein powder</p><p>on the healthy keto diet doesn&rsquo;t say</p><p>what type I bet he&rsquo;s got his fingers</p><p>crossed</p><p>yeah you can</p><p>um I don&rsquo;t recommend it though</p><p>especially if someone&rsquo;s taking uh like</p><p>the um</p><p>you know even uh especially the soy</p><p>protein powder but even like um</p><p>the other protein powders it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re</p><p>eating a refined product and it&rsquo;s not</p><p>coming from the natural source and a lot</p><p>of times it doesn&rsquo;t give you a complete</p><p>essential protein profile I&rsquo;ve noticed a</p><p>lot of problems with people getting</p><p>bloating and</p><p>um but</p><p>if if we if we compare that to doing</p><p>nothing great then do it but it&rsquo;s not</p><p>something I would do on a regular basis</p><p>or rely on</p><p>um</p><p>especially even the pea protein even</p><p>though I have it in one of my products I</p><p>I that&rsquo;s great as a kind of a backup</p><p>once in a while but I don&rsquo;t um on a</p><p>regular basis recommend it</p><p>um</p><p>unless you absolutely have to</p><p>or who is the best most studied audience</p><p>in the world why it&rsquo;s yours Dr Burke</p><p>because we already have answer to that</p><p>question in about 10 seconds which asks</p><p>true false</p><p>coffee or cafe coffee with caffeine</p><p>gives you more energy and they weren&rsquo;t</p><p>fooled by this at least 98 of them said</p><p>it&rsquo;s false two percent are sticking with</p><p>it that is true</p><p>yeah it might appear like it gives you</p><p>more energy but it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s nothing in</p><p>coffee that has energy to give you all</p><p>it&rsquo;s doing it&rsquo;s uh the caffeine in that</p><p>coffee is manipulating your own body&rsquo;s</p><p>chemicals</p><p>and especially the ones that make you</p><p>sleepy so you can feel less sleepy so</p><p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily an energy</p><p>it&rsquo;s a lack of sleepiness now there is</p><p>um</p><p>the caffeine also stimulates</p><p>noradrenaline</p><p>which is going to rev up your motor but</p><p>it&rsquo;s not giving you energy it&rsquo;s just</p><p>causing your own body to work a little</p><p>faster</p><p>to generate energy or to make you feel</p><p>like you have more energy</p><p>mentally so um good good answer on</p><p>everyone everyone answered that correct</p><p>um almost everyone but uh</p><p>well done</p><p>it&rsquo;s wonderful let&rsquo;s see if at the end</p><p>of our show here we can help Jesse</p><p>because we just talked about how great</p><p>broccoli is but she wants to know what</p><p>cruciferous vegetables are good for</p><p>someone with IBS broccoli and</p><p>cauliflower mess with her IBS</p><p>yeah I don&rsquo;t think any of them are going</p><p>to help you with IBS unfortunately I</p><p>think you may want it I lied I lied yes</p><p>there is one and that&rsquo;s going to be and</p><p>this is a probability so just try it out</p><p>but cabbage cabbage and uh and in</p><p>sauerkraut try either one but there are</p><p>some properties of cabbage with</p><p>digestive system but let&rsquo;s say you have</p><p>cabbage and you still have a problem</p><p>then you&rsquo;re gonna have to go carnivore</p><p>because</p><p>um again like I said before your body</p><p>just can&rsquo;t handle those fibers but out</p><p>of all the vegetables um cabbage is a</p><p>has a very unique thing for your it&rsquo;s</p><p>great for gastritis</p><p>probably because of the sulfpirophane</p><p>and the Cabbage that kills the H pylori</p><p>that&rsquo;s just my guess but it has other</p><p>properties for ulcers and it most people</p><p>that have digestive problems seem to be</p><p>able to tolerate that more than others</p><p>including myself</p><p>um if I consume raw broccoli I will be</p><p>on the floor in pain myself</p><p>but not broccoli Sprouts but broccoli</p><p>itself so I do also have an issue with</p><p>that which is a whole different topic um</p><p>but yes I hope I answered that</p><p>that&rsquo;s terrific sufficiently for you and</p><p>I have some highly exciting news for the</p><p>audience we&rsquo;re going to finally have a</p><p>Graphic next week uh that talks about</p><p>your terrific app which helps people</p><p>sort through the videos and so on and</p><p>it&rsquo;s up there so you can find it</p><p>certainly on the Apple Apple App Store</p><p>and I&rsquo;m sure on uh Android and so on but</p><p>we&rsquo;re going to have a demonstration of</p><p>that visually for you next week and I&rsquo;m</p><p>afraid we&rsquo;re about out of time doc well</p><p>um for those of you watching it&rsquo;s</p><p>actually uh it is Black Friday and so uh</p><p>if you haven&rsquo;t realized that we have a</p><p>Black
