    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Chris Palmer.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Palmer is a medical doctor</p>
<p>specializing in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>He is the world expert in the relationship</p>
<p>between metabolic disorders and psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>He treats a variety of different conditions,</p>
<p>including psychosis, including schizophrenia,</p>
<p>as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,</p>
<p>obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>anxiety disorders, and depression, among others.</p>
<p>He is best known for understanding the relationship</p>
<p>between how metabolism</p>
<p>and these various disorders of the mind interact.</p>
<p>And indeed, today, he describes</p>
<p>not only his own fascinating journey</p>
<p>into the field of psychiatry,</p>
<p>but also his clinical and research experience using diet</p>
<p>that is different forms of nutrition</p>
<p>in order to treat various psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>He describes some remarkable case studies</p>
<p>of individuals and groups of people</p>
<p>who have achieved tremendous relief</p>
<p>from the types of psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>that I just mentioned a few moments ago,</p>
<p>as well as new and emerging themes</p>
<p>as to how metabolism and the mind interact</p>
<p>to control things like obesity.</p>
<p>Indeed, he raises the hypothesis</p>
<p>that perhaps obesity in many cases</p>
<p>is the consequence of a brain dysfunction</p>
<p>as opposed to the consequence of a metabolic dysfunction</p>
<p>that then impacts the brain.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>he shares with us his overriding hypotheses</p>
<p>about the critical roles</p>
<p>that mitochondrial function and dysfunction</p>
<p>play in mental health and mental illness,</p>
<p>and how various particular types of diets,</p>
<p>ranging from the ketogenic diet to modified ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>and even just slight adjustments in carbohydrate intake</p>
<p>can be used in order to change mitochondrial function</p>
<p>and bring relief for various psychiatric illnesses.</p>
<p>He also highlights the essential and important theme</p>
<p>that various diet interventions,</p>
<p>including the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>were not first developed for sake of weight loss,</p>
<p>but rather were developed as treatments</p>
<p>for neurologic conditions such as epilepsy.</p>
<p>Today, he shares with us</p>
<p>how the foods that we eat alone and in combination,</p>
<p>and how fasting, both intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and more lengthy fasts,</p>
<p>can interact with the way that our brain functions</p>
<p>to strongly control the way that we think, feel, and behave.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wonderful is that Dr. Palmer</p>
<p>not only explains the science and his clinical expertise,</p>
<p>but also points to various actionable measures</p>
<p>that people can take</p>
<p>in order to improve their mental health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to mention that Dr. Palmer</p>
<p>is also the author of a terrific new book.</p>
<p>The title is,</p>
<p>Brain Energy, A Revolutionary Breakthrough</p>
<p>in Understanding Mental Health</p>
<p>and Improving Treatment for Anxiety, Depression,</p>
<p>OCD, PTSD, and more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read the book and it is a terrific read.</p>
<p>I came away from this book</p>
<p>with a much evolved understanding</p>
<p>of how the various psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>that I just described, as well as ADHD, emerge in people.</p>
<p>And it has completely revised my understanding</p>
<p>about the possible origins of various psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>and the best ways to treat them,</p>
<p>including both with medications,</p>
<p>but also with nutritional approaches.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about Dr. Palmer&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>and the book, please go to chrispalmermd.com.</p>
<p>We also provide links to the book</p>
<p>and to his website in our show note captions.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>for the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe, based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training,</p>
<p>to get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Chris Palmer.</p>
<p>Chris, Dr. Palmer, thank you for being here.</p>
<p>Thank you, Andrew, for having me.</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions for you,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really excited about this topic</p>
<p>because I think most people know what mental illness is,</p>
<p>or they have some idea what that is.</p>
<p>Most people have some idea what nutrition is.</p>
<p>Fewer people certainly know</p>
<p>how closely those things can interact.</p>
<p>And I think everybody is familiar with the feeling of a food</p>
<p>or the ingestion of a food,</p>
<p>making them feel good in the short term.</p>
<p>You know, we eat a food that tastes delicious to us</p>
<p>or that we associate with something nice,</p>
<p>and we feel good mentally and physically.</p>
<p>Whereas when we eat something that gives us food poisoning</p>
<p>or maybe even something that just doesn&rsquo;t taste that great</p>
<p>or that we associate with a bad experience,</p>
<p>we feel less good in the short term.</p>
<p>But I believe that very few people understand</p>
<p>or are familiar with the fact that nutrition</p>
<p>and our mental health interact in this very intimate,</p>
<p>maybe even causal way.</p>
<p>And that is something that occurs over long periods of time,</p>
<p>meaning what I ate yesterday, the day before,</p>
<p>maybe even 10 years ago,</p>
<p>could be impacting the way that my brain and body</p>
<p>are making me feel now.</p>
<p>So if you would, I&rsquo;d love for you to just tell us</p>
<p>about a little bit of the history,</p>
<p>in particular your history,</p>
<p>with exploring the relationship</p>
<p>between nutrition and mental health.</p>
<p>And then we can dive into some of the more particulars</p>
<p>of ketogenic diets versus other diets,</p>
<p>and some of the truly miraculous findings</p>
<p>that you and others are coming up with</p>
<p>based on real patients and real experiences of people</p>
<p>who suffer and then find relief by altering their nutrition.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>This story really starts with my own personal story.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t need to go into great detail,</p>
<p>but to set the stage, when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I definitely had mental illness.</p>
<p>Started with OCD.</p>
<p>A series of events happened in my family.</p>
<p>My mother had a horrible, kind of psychotic break.</p>
<p>And all sorts of adverse childhood events for me.</p>
<p>She and I were actually homeless together for a while.</p>
<p>I went on to have subsequent depression,</p>
<p>suicidality, all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But somehow or another, I pulled myself together</p>
<p>and got through medical school,</p>
<p>actually did quite well in medical school,</p>
<p>got an award for being one of the top students,</p>
<p>and then was doing my internship and residency at Harvard.</p>
<p>And at that point in time,</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>So I had high blood pressure,</p>
<p>horrible lipids, and prediabetes.</p>
<p>And I was doing everything right, supposedly.</p>
<p>I was on a low-fat diet</p>
<p>and I was exercising regularly.</p>
<p>And year after year, my doctor kept telling me</p>
<p>diet and exercise.</p>
<p>I kept asking him what diet, what exercise.</p>
<p>I was doing everything he kept telling me to do.</p>
<p>Everything was getting worse.</p>
<p>My blood pressure kept going higher.</p>
<p>And at some point, he kind of said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to go on medication.</p>
<p>I need to put you on something for your prediabetes,</p>
<p>something for your cholesterol,</p>
<p>and something for your blood pressure.</p>
<p>So three pills out of the gate.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m only in my 20s.</p>
<p>Were you overweight?</p>
<p>No, technically no.</p>
<p>I had a gut, so that&rsquo;s a sign of insulin resistance.</p>
<p>I know now.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know it then.</p>
<p>And he actually kind of leaned in at one point</p>
<p>and said, do your parents have diabetes?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do your parents have high blood pressure?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are your parents overweight?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m really sorry, it&rsquo;s genetic.</p>
<p>Basically, you&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your genes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just gonna have to bite the bullet and take meds.</p>
<p>And as a physician, I knew what that meant.</p>
<p>I knew that I&rsquo;m in my 20s.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m already on three meds for metabolic syndrome,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be screwed by the time I&rsquo;m 40 or 50,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m probably gonna be having heart attacks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d heard through the rumor mill</p>
<p>that the Atkins diet could somehow help people</p>
<p>improve their cholesterol and pre-diabetes.</p>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t really believe it.</p>
<p>I was highly skeptical.</p>
<p>And I believed everything I was taught in medical school.</p>
<p>Why would my professors lie to me</p>
<p>that they knew what they were talking about?</p>
<p>Low-fat diet was the thing to do.</p>
<p>And the Atkins diet was clearly dangerous and reckless.</p>
<p>But I had been trying the medical dogma for years,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t working for me.</p>
<p>And so for whatever reason, I decided</p>
<p>this is gonna be my last attempt at something different.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll just bite the bullet and go on meds.</p>
<p>So I tried the Atkins diet.</p>
<p>I did my own special version of it.</p>
<p>I still avoided red meat</p>
<p>because I was terrified of red meat.</p>
<p>I tried to do a healthy version,</p>
<p>which is probably more like the South Beach diet.</p>
<p>This was before the South Beach diet was invented.</p>
<p>But within three months,</p>
<p>my metabolic syndrome was completely gone.</p>
<p>So blood pressure normalized, lipids normalized.</p>
<p>Did your weight change?</p>
<p>Or you mentioned that you were of healthy weight,</p>
<p>but that you had a bit of abdominal fat.</p>
<p>So I lost the abdominal fat.</p>
<p>I probably lost about 10 pounds through this process.</p>
<p>But everything got normal.</p>
<p>And when I went back to my doctor, he was shocked.</p>
<p>He actually said, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>During the time before you switched to this new diet,</p>
<p>how was your mental health, if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking?</p>
<p>Because it sounded like you&rsquo;re very clear</p>
<p>that there was metabolic syndrome,</p>
<p>or you were headed towards more severe metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>You mentioned OCD.</p>
<p>I actually am familiar with this as a kid.</p>
<p>I had a low-level kind of Tourette&rsquo;s grunt</p>
<p>and probably maybe obsessive still to some extent,</p>
<p>although not full-blown clinically diagnosed OCD.</p>
<p>So I can relate somewhat.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing, what was the context of all that</p>
<p>before and after this nutritional switch?</p>
<p>So before the nutritional switch,</p>
<p>I was still struggling with low-grade depression and OCD.</p>
<p>I, again, it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily interfering</p>
<p>with my ability to function,</p>
<p>because I was functioning at a high level.</p>
<p>I mean, anybody looking from the outside,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a top student,</p>
<p>you just got into one of the most competitive,</p>
<p>actually at that point, it was the most competitive</p>
<p>residency program in the country for psychiatry.</p>
<p>So they would have looked at me and said, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t, I was actually on medications.</p>
<p>I was trying different medications,</p>
<p>trying to figure out how to feel better,</p>
<p>how to stop obsessing so much, how to not be so depressed.</p>
<p>And I found that those medications,</p>
<p>they actually came with more side effects for me</p>
<p>than benefits.</p>
<p>I was on Prozac for a long time,</p>
<p>it totally messed up my sleep.</p>
<p>And then the psychiatrist was like,</p>
<p>you need pills to help you sleep now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not really resonating</p>
<p>very well with me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m now a psychiatrist, I&rsquo;m in my psychiatry residency.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking, you know what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not sitting well with me,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna prescribe more and more meds</p>
<p>for all the side effects that you&rsquo;re causing.</p>
<p>And yet at the same time, I wanted to feel better.</p>
<p>And I was learning chemical imbalances.</p>
<p>This is what we do to get rid of depression and OCD.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to take your pills.</p>
<p>And so I was taking my pills.</p>
<p>I was in psychotherapy.</p>
<p>I had been in psychotherapy on and off for years.</p>
<p>I had received much more intensive treatment</p>
<p>when I was younger.</p>
<p>And that was essentially worthless for me.</p>
<p>It actually probably just caused harm</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis?</p>
<p>Various psychotherapies, not psychoanalysis per se,</p>
<p>but some of them were psychoanalytically oriented.</p>
<p>Psychotherapies, I was actually hospitalized at one point.</p>
<p>Had been put on lithium and imipramine,</p>
<p>which is a tricyclic antidepressant and other things.</p>
<p>And they were actually horrible.</p>
<p>They were horrible.</p>
<p>They did nothing beneficial for me.</p>
<p>I gave them a decent amount of time to work.</p>
<p>I really wanted to feel better.</p>
<p>So at the time that I tried this diet,</p>
<p>I certainly wasn&rsquo;t impaired in the same way.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t struggling that much,</p>
<p>but I still had these low-grade symptoms,</p>
<p>was trying to feel better.</p>
<p>And the thing that was the most striking to me</p>
<p>after doing the diet for three months</p>
<p>was not the fact that my metabolic syndrome was gone.</p>
<p>That was my goal.</p>
<p>And it was a seemingly miraculous achievement</p>
<p>because I got rid of everything with one dietary change.</p>
<p>But the thing that I noticed was dramatic improvement</p>
<p>in my mood, energy, concentration, and sleep.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life,</p>
<p>I started waking up before my alarm went off</p>
<p>and feeling rested.</p>
<p>That never happened to me before.</p>
<p>I was meticulous about planning when my alarm went off</p>
<p>and how many times I could push the snooze button</p>
<p>in order to be on time for wherever I needed to be,</p>
<p>whether it was school or the hospital or whatever.</p>
<p>I had a good system.</p>
<p>I was never late for anything.</p>
<p>But that was shocking to me that I felt so good.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I&rsquo;ve often said to people,</p>
<p>prior to the diet,</p>
<p>I always felt like there are two types of people</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>There are haves and have-nots.</p>
<p>There are these happy peppy people</p>
<p>who just are so positive and they&rsquo;ve got energy</p>
<p>and they have this saying,</p>
<p>they like to work hard and play hard.</p>
<p>And I always understood working hard.</p>
<p>I totally got that because I was a hard worker</p>
<p>and I understood the value of hard work</p>
<p>and you gotta do something useful with yourself.</p>
<p>But I never understood who the hell wants to play hard.</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s got energy for that?</p>
<p>Like, aren&rsquo;t you tired from working so hard?</p>
<p>How on earth do these people have energy</p>
<p>to go and play hard?</p>
<p>And I assumed that they were just part of the haves</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And they were just lucky and privileged.</p>
<p>They either had good genetics</p>
<p>or maybe they had good childhoods or good parents</p>
<p>or something, something that I didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>The kids with genuine smiles in the yearbooks.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>The rest.</p>
<p>And by the way, I really appreciate you sharing</p>
<p>some of your personal story</p>
<p>because I think it is very important</p>
<p>for people to hear and understand</p>
<p>that people like yourself</p>
<p>who are extremely high functioning and accomplished,</p>
<p>that the road was, from everything I&rsquo;m hearing</p>
<p>and understanding, very choppy internally at times</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ve overcome a lot in order to get there.</p>
<p>And also have been going through</p>
<p>what sounds like a very long iterative process</p>
<p>of trying to figure out what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>to finally arrive at a solution</p>
<p>and then make that the basis of much of the work</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing today for other people.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>because I think many people share with you this notion</p>
<p>that there are indeed two groups,</p>
<p>a happy group and then fated to be unhappy group.</p>
<p>And it speaks to the fact that your story,</p>
<p>or rather speaks to the fact</p>
<p>that what we see is not always</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on internally with people.</p>
<p>And that this notion of there just being two groups,</p>
<p>the happy or the haves and the have nots,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be the way that it works.</p>
<p>And there are probably many more people suffering</p>
<p>than we realize.</p>
<p>And that there is an important need for tools</p>
<p>to overcome that suffering.</p>
<p>So I really just here, even early in our discussion,</p>
<p>I just want to extend a genuine thanks</p>
<p>because so much of what I hear from people</p>
<p>is questions about health and mental health</p>
<p>and physical health,</p>
<p>but that clearly point to the fact</p>
<p>that many people are struggling to varying degrees.</p>
<p>And even the people who are in this category</p>
<p>of great childhood and happiness could do far better</p>
<p>for themselves and then also for other people.</p>
<p>So thank you for that.</p>
<p>I want to know at the point where you realized</p>
<p>that nutrition can play a profound role</p>
<p>in how you feel and operate in a large number of domains,</p>
<p>you were still a student or a resident at that point?</p>
<p>I was a resident.</p>
<p>At that point, did you decide</p>
<p>that you were going to explore this</p>
<p>in a professional context?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Okay, so what was the journey forward</p>
<p>into the work that you&rsquo;re doing now?</p>
<p>So the next step was that I just had friends and family</p>
<p>who saw me, saw that I had improved my health,</p>
<p>saw that I lost some weight pretty easily.</p>
<p>In particular, I remember my sister and sister-in-law,</p>
<p>they got really pissed at me one Thanksgiving</p>
<p>because I could resist all the pumpkin pie</p>
<p>and apple pie and everything else.</p>
<p>They were like, how the hell are you doing that?</p>
<p>How are you resisting all of this food?</p>
<p>I said, I don&rsquo;t crave it anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having turkey and green beans</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>So I got them to do the diet</p>
<p>and they too noticed dramatic improvement in their moods</p>
<p>and energy and sleep and everything else.</p>
<p>So within a few years,</p>
<p>the primary thing I noticed</p>
<p>is this powerful antidepressant effect.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m an attending physician.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got all these patients in my clinical practice</p>
<p>with treatment-resistant mental illness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a tertiary care hospital.</p>
<p>So I almost never get somebody off the street</p>
<p>with their first episode of depression.</p>
<p>Out of the gate, as part of my career,</p>
<p>I get treatment-resistant mental disorders.</p>
<p>So I get people who&rsquo;ve already been</p>
<p>to six plus psychiatrists, therapists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve usually tried dozens of different medications.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been in decades of psychotherapy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve often had ECT and other things</p>
<p>and nothing&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking, well, we&rsquo;re kind of out of options</p>
<p>for these other people and this diet</p>
<p>is having this really powerful antidepressant effect.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m gonna try it and just see</p>
<p>if any of my patients are game to try it,</p>
<p>to see if it might help them.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it did.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t help everyone and not everybody was interested</p>
<p>and or able to do it.</p>
<p>But some of the ones who were able to do it</p>
<p>ended up having a remarkable</p>
<p>and powerful antidepressant effect.</p>
<p>One woman actually became hypomanic within a month</p>
<p>and she had been depressed pretty much nonstop</p>
<p>for over five years, chronically depressed,</p>
<p>suicidal, in and out of hospitals.</p>
<p>And I saw her become hypomanic and I&rsquo;m thinking,</p>
<p>wow, this really is a powerful antidepressant effect.</p>
<p>Like this is amazing.</p>
<p>This is like a medication but better</p>
<p>because it actually is working for her.</p>
<p>But I laid low at that point</p>
<p>because at that point we didn&rsquo;t have many clinical trials</p>
<p>of the safety or efficacy of the Atkins diet</p>
<p>for even weight loss or diabetes,</p>
<p>let alone any mental disorders.</p>
<p>And so I really actually felt like I&rsquo;m on the fringe here</p>
<p>and this is not going to be met with praise by anyone.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna lay low.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna offer it to patients.</p>
<p>And I went along that way up until</p>
<p>2016.</p>
<p>And may I just ask about the diet?</p>
<p>When you say Atkins diet,</p>
<p>so this is low to zero starch.</p>
<p>So low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And was it traditional Atkins?</p>
<p>Were you tailoring it to the individual patient</p>
<p>depending on their psychiatric symptoms,</p>
<p>whether or not they were overweight or not overweight?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re not a nutritionist.</p>
<p>So how did you prescribe a nutrition plan for your patients</p>
<p>and what was involved in making sure</p>
<p>that they adhered to that?</p>
<p>Maybe even some of the things you observed</p>
<p>in terms of who was more willing to try this</p>
<p>or not try this, any observations or maybe even data.</p>
<p>So early on, I was winging it.</p>
<p>And I was, you know, the first few patients,</p>
<p>it was try this Atkins diet.</p>
<p>I wanna see ketosis.</p>
<p>So I was going for ketones.</p>
<p>So they were pricking their finger</p>
<p>and they were doing a blood ketone test?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about blood ketone monitors</p>
<p>if they existed back then.</p>
<p>So we were using urine strips.</p>
<p>Which are not quite as accurate,</p>
<p>but still useful as a general guide from what I understand.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And so I was strongly recommending</p>
<p>that patients achieve urinary ketosis.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is I noticed a pattern</p>
<p>that when they were trying the diet</p>
<p>and not getting ketones,</p>
<p>they often did not get a clinical benefit.</p>
<p>It was once they got into ketosis</p>
<p>that I began to notice the clinical benefit</p>
<p>and the powerful antidepressant effect.</p>
<p>So probably any nutrition plan, aka diet,</p>
<p>that elevated ketones in the urine</p>
<p>to the point where you would say this person is in ketosis</p>
<p>or they would say, I&rsquo;m in ketosis.</p>
<p>That was a step in the right direction,</p>
<p>independent of exactly what they were eating</p>
<p>or not eating to get there, including fasting.</p>
<p>At that time, probably fasting wasn&rsquo;t as popular.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the incredible work,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And he is a former colleague</p>
<p>and I know there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy about fasting,</p>
<p>but I think for many people,</p>
<p>fasting is a powerful tool.</p>
<p>For others, it&rsquo;s a less useful tool,</p>
<p>but Sachin Panda and others.</p>
<p>But fasting certainly will limit your carbohydrate intake</p>
<p>and get you into ketosis, correct?</p>
<p>It will.</p>
<p>Did you have any patients fast or do intermittent fasting?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I had some patients who did what Atkins had called a fat fast</p>
<p>where they eat primarily fat.</p>
<p>So they either fast and or they eat primarily fats</p>
<p>to try to get into a state of ketosis.</p>
<p>So for some patients,</p>
<p>it was actually quite easy to get into ketosis,</p>
<p>especially overweight and obese patients.</p>
<p>They have a lot of fat stores on their body</p>
<p>and actually limiting carbohydrates</p>
<p>usually results in high levels of ketosis for them.</p>
<p>And they probably feel better too, I imagine,</p>
<p>because when we limit our starch intake,</p>
<p>we start to excrete a lot of water.</p>
<p>People can get some pretty quick weight loss</p>
<p>that even though it may not be fat loss,</p>
<p>makes them feel literally a little lighter</p>
<p>and maybe a little more energetic.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And as the years went on,</p>
<p>the field was advancing, more research was coming out.</p>
<p>People were getting a little more sophisticated</p>
<p>with blood ketone monitoring,</p>
<p>with different versions of ketogenic diets.</p>
<p>And I was evolving my practice.</p>
<p>The thing that completely upended everything</p>
<p>that I knew as a psychiatrist though</p>
<p>was when I helped a patient in 2016 lose weight.</p>
<p>So this was a patient,</p>
<p>33 year old man with schizoaffective disorder.</p>
<p>He had been my patient for eight years now.</p>
<p>Could you clarify for people what schizoaffective disorder is?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a clinician, but as I recall,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a low level of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>So there might be some auditory hallucinations.</p>
<p>If I met this person,</p>
<p>I might think they&rsquo;re kind of different,</p>
<p>quote unquote weird,</p>
<p>but they would not seem necessarily</p>
<p>scary to me and typically to other people.</p>
<p>And I mean that with respect, of course,</p>
<p>but oftentimes people with schizophrenia</p>
<p>can seem just like you don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>how to interact with them</p>
<p>because their world seems so altered</p>
<p>because they have all these so-called positive symptoms,</p>
<p>hallucinations, and they&rsquo;re talking to people</p>
<p>that no one else can see, et cetera.</p>
<p>Is that schizoaffective?</p>
<p>So no, actually.</p>
<p>So schizoaffective is the same as schizophrenia essentially.</p>
<p>The only difference is it&rsquo;s schizophrenia</p>
<p>with superimposed mood episodes.</p>
<p>Oh, so it&rsquo;s actually more severe than-</p>
<p>It can be.</p>
<p>Okay, so I have it backwards.</p>
<p>So schizoaffective disorder is essentially schizophrenia</p>
<p>plus some mood episodes.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m thinking of schizotypal.</p>
<p>Schizotypal is the low grade kind of mild paranoia</p>
<p>or kind of eccentric beliefs and other things.</p>
<p>Okay, so folks out there,</p>
<p>I have my nomenclature backwards.</p>
<p>Schizotypal is the quote unquote low level schizophrenia</p>
<p>or schizoaffective is as or more so.</p>
<p>Full-blown schizophrenia plus full-blown,</p>
<p>usually bipolar symptoms.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s absolutely clear</p>
<p>who the clinician in the room is.</p>
<p>Thank you for that reminder.</p>
<p>No worries.</p>
<p>So this man had schizoaffective disorder.</p>
<p>He had daily auditory hallucinations.</p>
<p>He had paranoid delusions.</p>
<p>He could not go out in public without being terrified.</p>
<p>He was convinced that there were these powerful families,</p>
<p>that they had technologies that could control his thoughts.</p>
<p>They could broadcast his thoughts to other people.</p>
<p>They were trying to hurt him.</p>
<p>They had targeted him for some reason.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure why.</p>
<p>He had some suspicions and beliefs</p>
<p>about maybe when he did this bad thing</p>
<p>when he was 11 years old,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they decided to target him.</p>
<p>This man was tormented by his illness, tormented.</p>
<p>It ruined his life.</p>
<p>He had already tried 17 different medications</p>
<p>and none of them stopped his symptoms,</p>
<p>but they did cause him to gain a lot of weight.</p>
<p>These are the medications, as I recall,</p>
<p>for schizophrenia, the classical ones</p>
<p>are dopamine receptor blockers,</p>
<p>cause people to, huge increases in prolactin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why sometimes men will get breast development</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll put on a lot of weight</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be catatonic or movement disorders.</p>
<p>They make you feel like, I have to imagine,</p>
<p>given how good most things that release dopamine</p>
<p>make us feel that blocking dopamine receptors</p>
<p>with antipsychotics makes people feel lousy.</p>
<p>Horrible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a huge challenge in our field</p>
<p>because a lot of patients don&rsquo;t want to take them.</p>
<p>And then you get these rebound effects</p>
<p>if patients are on them for several months</p>
<p>and then they stop them cold turkey,</p>
<p>they can get wildly psychotic and ill,</p>
<p>end up aggressive or hospitalized or sometimes dead.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s him, he weighs 340 pounds</p>
<p>and for whatever reason he gets it in his head,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna get a girlfriend if I don&rsquo;t lose some weight.</p>
<p>He also recognizes I&rsquo;m never gonna get a girlfriend</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m a loser, I&rsquo;m schizophrenic,</p>
<p>I live with my father, I have nothing going for me,</p>
<p>but I could at least try to address</p>
<p>one of these awful, horrible things about myself</p>
<p>and maybe I could lose some weight.</p>
<p>So he asked for my help.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, we ended up deciding</p>
<p>to try the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Now at this point, I have no anticipation</p>
<p>that the ketogenic diet is gonna do anything</p>
<p>for his psychiatric symptoms</p>
<p>because this man has schizoaffective disorder,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not depression.</p>
<p>Depression is very different,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re totally different disorders.</p>
<p>So he decides to give it a try.</p>
<p>Within two weeks, not only does he start losing weight,</p>
<p>but I begin to notice this dramatic antidepressant effect.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making better eye contact, he&rsquo;s smiling more,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking a lot more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking like, what&rsquo;s gotten into you,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re coming to life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard you talk this much,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen you so excited or present or alive.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t changed his meds at all.</p>
<p>The thing that upended everything</p>
<p>that I knew as a psychiatrist was six to eight weeks in,</p>
<p>he spontaneously starts reporting,</p>
<p>you know those voices that I hear all the time?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going away.</p>
<p>And he says, you know how I always thought</p>
<p>that there were all these families</p>
<p>who were controlling my thoughts and out to get me</p>
<p>and they had targeted me and I&rsquo;m thinking,</p>
<p>oh yeah, we&rsquo;ve been talking about that for eight years,</p>
<p>we could talk about that again.</p>
<p>He says, you know what?</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And now that I say it, it sounds kind of crazy.</p>
<p>It probably never was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably had schizophrenia all along</p>
<p>like everybody&rsquo;s been trying to tell me</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s going away.</p>
<p>That man went on, he&rsquo;s now lost 160 pounds</p>
<p>and kept it off to this day.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>He was able to do things he had not been able to do</p>
<p>since the time of his diagnosis.</p>
<p>He was able to complete a certificate program.</p>
<p>He was able to go out in public and not be paranoid.</p>
<p>He performed improv in front of a live audience.</p>
<p>At one point he was able to move out of his father&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>and live independently.</p>
<p>And that completely blew my mind as a psychiatrist</p>
<p>and I went on a scientific journey</p>
<p>to understand what in the hell just happened.</p>
<p>That is indeed mind blowing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens now called AG1</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics</p>
<p>that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of our body&rsquo;s nutrients are being absorbed</p>
<p>that make sure that all of my foundational</p>
<p>nutritional needs are met.</p>
<p>And it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions.</p>
<p>First of all, did he stay on any kind of antipsychotic</p>
<p>or other medication?</p>
<p>If so, were the dosages adjusted, excuse me,</p>
<p>while undergoing this remarkable transition?</p>
<p>Because as we know, it&rsquo;s not an either or medication</p>
<p>or nutrition changes, it can be both.</p>
<p>And then the other question is one of adherence.</p>
<p>You know, I think about someone</p>
<p>with schizoaffective disorder who&rsquo;s suffering</p>
<p>from all the sorts of things that you described.</p>
<p>How does somebody like that organize themselves</p>
<p>in order to stay on a ketogenic diet?</p>
<p>And I say this with all the seriousness in the world.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of people who do not have</p>
<p>schizotypal or schizoaffective disorder who have trouble,</p>
<p>they claim, adhering to a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the easiest diet, certainly in its extreme form.</p>
<p>At first, it&rsquo;s not the easiest diet to stick to.</p>
<p>So how did he do it?</p>
<p>This sounds like a remarkable individual.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d also like to just know your general thoughts</p>
<p>about adherence to things</p>
<p>when people are back on their heels mentally.</p>
<p>You know, how do they get motivated and stick to something?</p>
<p>So the questions were medication, yes or no?</p>
<p>If yes, dosage adjusted, yes or no?</p>
<p>And if people are suffering from depression</p>
<p>or full-blown psychotic episodes,</p>
<p>how does one ensure that they continue to adhere to a diet?</p>
<p>So in terms of medications, he has remained on medication.</p>
<p>So early on, I wasn&rsquo;t adjusting anything.</p>
<p>I was just in disbelief and shocked that this was happening.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.</p>
<p>Over the years, we have slowly but surely</p>
<p>tried to taper him off his meds.</p>
<p>He has been on meds for decades.</p>
<p>He started medications when he was a young child.</p>
<p>His brain has developed in response</p>
<p>to all sorts of psychiatric medications.</p>
<p>And it has not been easy to try to get him off.</p>
<p>So we continue to try to get him off medication.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s challenging and difficult.</p>
<p>And I just want to say for any listeners,</p>
<p>it is getting off your meds is very difficult and dangerous</p>
<p>and you need to do it with supervision,</p>
<p>with a mental health professional or a prescriber,</p>
<p>because it is dangerous.</p>
<p>When people reduce their meds too much,</p>
<p>they can get wildly symptomatic.</p>
<p>Is that true for depression as well?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true for any psychiatric medication.</p>
<p>The brain makes adaptations</p>
<p>in response to psychiatric medications.</p>
<p>And when you stop them cold turkey,</p>
<p>some people are fine,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend finding out</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen patients,</p>
<p>when they stop antidepressants,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen patients get floridly depressed</p>
<p>and suicidal within three months.</p>
<p>I had one patient almost quit her job</p>
<p>because she became convinced that,</p>
<p>well, my life sucks and it&rsquo;s all because of my boss.</p>
<p>And I know that she&rsquo;s just a horrible human being</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s abusing me.</p>
<p>And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>I think this is related to your medication change.</p>
<p>We got her back on her meds.</p>
<p>Within three days, she said,</p>
<p>oh my God, I can&rsquo;t believe that happened.</p>
<p>Like I almost quit my job.</p>
<p>And that would have been the most illogical</p>
<p>and irrational decision I&rsquo;ve ever made in my entire life.</p>
<p>But somehow it seemed so real just several days ago.</p>
<p>And now that I&rsquo;m back on this medication,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t mean that she needs the meds,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that he needs the meds.</p>
<p>It means that meds need to be adjusted very safely</p>
<p>and cautiously and gradually.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the medication piece.</p>
<p>The adherence piece was not easy</p>
<p>for him and for other patients.</p>
<p>It is very rare that I have a patient</p>
<p>who I can say, do the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>come see me in three months and let me know how it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>That almost never happens.</p>
<p>It has happened, I think on two occasions.</p>
<p>But that is, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>what perhaps not you,</p>
<p>but many psychiatrists do with medication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s your prescription.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk in a month or three months.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a variable that is probably worth us</p>
<p>exploring a little bit here as the conversation continues.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, that frequent contact</p>
<p>and making micro adjustments or macro adjustments</p>
<p>to medication or nutrition could be meaningful.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So with this particular patient,</p>
<p>early on, he was actually pretty adherent.</p>
<p>I was seeing him once a week.</p>
<p>And so I could do a lot of education.</p>
<p>I was weighing him.</p>
<p>I was checking his ketones.</p>
<p>I was checking his glucose levels.</p>
<p>At that point, I had a blood ketone monitor in my office.</p>
<p>So I knew whether he was compliant or not,</p>
<p>which is so beneficial in doing clinical work</p>
<p>and research on this diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only diet where within seconds,</p>
<p>I can have an objective biomarker of compliance</p>
<p>or non-compliance.</p>
<p>Such a key point.</p>
<p>And again, it brings to mind for me</p>
<p>the parallel with medication.</p>
<p>I mean, a patient can say they&rsquo;re taking their medication</p>
<p>and unless they&rsquo;re in a hospital setting</p>
<p>where somebody is checking under their tongue</p>
<p>and you know, all of this,</p>
<p>they very well could not be taking it or taking more.</p>
<p>And you and I both know</p>
<p>that blood draws for neurotransmitter levels</p>
<p>are complicated because you wanna know what&rsquo;s in the brain</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s functional in the brain.</p>
<p>So, and I have to imagine that most people</p>
<p>that are prescribed drugs</p>
<p>for any number of different psychiatric conditions</p>
<p>are not giving blood every time they talk</p>
<p>to their psychiatrist or psychologist.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, and when we&rsquo;ve looked at, you know, on that front,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve looked at studies of compliance,</p>
<p>the majority of patients are at least somewhat non-compliant</p>
<p>with prescription medications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not on purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s forget, they forgot.</p>
<p>They take it at night.</p>
<p>They were out late.</p>
<p>They were off their routine.</p>
<p>They forgot to brush their teeth</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when they take their meds.</p>
<p>And so because they, you know, it was so late,</p>
<p>they just crashed when they got home.</p>
<p>They forgot to take their meds.</p>
<p>Happens all the time.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a medication that people take more than once a day,</p>
<p>the non-compliance rates are much higher</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just easy to forget.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that people are willfully, you know,</p>
<p>disobeying their doctors or anything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard to remember</p>
<p>to take meds consistently every day.</p>
<p>When you say measuring ketones,</p>
<p>I want to drill into this a little bit</p>
<p>because it does seem that the presence of ketones</p>
<p>and somebody being quote unquote in ketosis</p>
<p>turns out to be the key variable.</p>
<p>Certainly in your book,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the major takeaways,</p>
<p>although there were many important takeaways,</p>
<p>that people get into ketosis.</p>
<p>Do they have to stay in ketosis?</p>
<p>So for instance, I&rsquo;ve followed the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t any longer,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve tried in the past</p>
<p>the so-called cyclic ketogenic diet</p>
<p>where every third or fourth day,</p>
<p>get some pasta or rice, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that was interesting as an experiment,</p>
<p>but to stay in ketosis,</p>
<p>what sort of blood levels of ketones</p>
<p>do you like to see in your patients?</p>
<p>What is the range</p>
<p>that you think most people could aspire to?</p>
<p>So it really depends on the patient</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m treating, quite honestly.</p>
<p>So, and I don&rsquo;t think every patient</p>
<p>needs the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>For some patients, simply getting rid of junk food</p>
<p>can make a huge difference</p>
<p>in a mood disorder, for instance.</p>
<p>So a junk food, meaning highly processed food,</p>
<p>food that could last on the shelf a very long time.</p>
<p>Highly processed foods that are usually high</p>
<p>in both sugar, carbohydrate, carbs, and fats.</p>
<p>Those seem to be the worst foods.</p>
<p>That combination, high sugar, high fat,</p>
<p>seems to be the worst combination for metabolic health.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, we&rsquo;ve got emerging data</p>
<p>that strongly suggests it&rsquo;s also bad for mental health.</p>
<p>Depression and anxiety</p>
<p>are the most common mental disorders.</p>
<p>And so we have the best data for those disorders.</p>
<p>But we actually have a lot of data</p>
<p>with even bipolar disorder and schizophrenia</p>
<p>that insulin resistance in particular</p>
<p>and insulin signaling in the brain</p>
<p>is impaired in people with chronic mental disorders</p>
<p>kind of across the board.</p>
<p>All the way from chronic anxiety, depression,</p>
<p>to bipolar, to schizophrenia, and even Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>We know that patients with all of those disorders</p>
<p>have impaired glucose metabolism</p>
<p>and that the insulin signaling system in the brain,</p>
<p>which is different than insulin signaling in the periphery,</p>
<p>seems to somehow possibly be playing a role.</p>
<p>So to step back from that.</p>
<p>So for some patients,</p>
<p>I might just wanna decrease glucose and insulin levels</p>
<p>and I can do that by getting rid of sweets.</p>
<p>For other patients,</p>
<p>like patients with schizoaffective disorder</p>
<p>or schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s chronic,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m using it as a brain treatment,</p>
<p>then I do want a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and I usually want reasonably high levels of blood ketones.</p>
<p>Usually for depression,</p>
<p>I wanna see at least greater than probably 0.8 millimole.</p>
<p>For psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>I usually wanna see levels greater than 1.5.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m shooting for, if at all possible.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d go for.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, and sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to imply</p>
<p>that people need to be in ketosis</p>
<p>in order to see some mental health benefits</p>
<p>from changing their diet.</p>
<p>You make very clear in your book,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll go into this in more detail,</p>
<p>that avoiding insulin resistance,</p>
<p>reversing insulin resistance,</p>
<p>and essentially trying to reverse</p>
<p>what earlier you described as this metabolic syndrome,</p>
<p>which is a bunch of different things, is the target.</p>
<p>And for some people,</p>
<p>getting rid of highly processed foods</p>
<p>and focusing mainly on non-processed</p>
<p>or minimally processed foods will really help.</p>
<p>For others, going straight</p>
<p>to the full-blown ketogenic diet will be of most benefit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to back up a little bit in history</p>
<p>and get to something which I find incredibly interesting,</p>
<p>which is epilepsy and the longstanding use</p>
<p>of ketogenic diet and fasting to treat epilepsy.</p>
<p>And the reason I want to kind of rewind</p>
<p>to that point in history is that I think that</p>
<p>for a lot of listeners and people out there</p>
<p>who are familiar with how changing your diet</p>
<p>or changing your exercise can positively impact sleep</p>
<p>and weight and all these things,</p>
<p>and it cascades into feeling better,</p>
<p>that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>But for a lot of the world still,</p>
<p>the idea that changing or using nutrition</p>
<p>as a dissection tool or as a treatment tool</p>
<p>to understand and treat mental illness</p>
<p>is still a kind of heretical idea,</p>
<p>that to them it kind of falls in the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a woo science or something like that.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, you&rsquo;re a board-certified physician</p>
<p>and psychiatrist at arguably one of the finest</p>
<p>medical schools in the world, Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>You know, even though I&rsquo;m on the Stanford side,</p>
<p>we acknowledge our East Coast friends.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the Harvard of the West Coast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to talk count.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to talk count.</p>
<p>Or we&rsquo;re the Stanford of the East Coast.</p>
<p>That argument could go back and forth a number of times,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re a serious clinician</p>
<p>and a serious scientist, and you&rsquo;re a serious thinker.</p>
<p>But for a lot of people out there,</p>
<p>the notion of using diet, they immediately think,</p>
<p>ah, well, that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Or I think there&rsquo;s a category of people who think,</p>
<p>well, yeah, didn&rsquo;t Atkins diet have a heart attack?</p>
<p>You know, I hear that a lot, you know?</p>
<p>So like, that was crazy.</p>
<p>You know, like people immediately discard</p>
<p>the Atkins diet for that reason,</p>
<p>which I do think is throwing the baby out</p>
<p>with the bath water,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an interesting thing nonetheless.</p>
<p>And then I think that the majority of people</p>
<p>sit in the middle and just want to see science and medicine</p>
<p>come up with treatments that work.</p>
<p>And I have to say, I&rsquo;m very relieved</p>
<p>to hear what you said earlier, which was,</p>
<p>you never said that people should come off their medication</p>
<p>and just become, go on a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and everything will be cured.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re certainly not saying that.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And rather you&rsquo;re saying, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>that nutrition needs to be considered</p>
<p>one of the major tools in the landscape of effective tools,</p>
<p>and that it can be very effective,</p>
<p>evidenced by the story that you shared,</p>
<p>and there are many other stories in there as well,</p>
<p>of truly miraculous transformations.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about epilepsy and how the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>is not just used for epilepsy,</p>
<p>but is one of the oldest, if not the oldest examples</p>
<p>of the use of nutrition to treat a condition</p>
<p>of the nervous system that can be incredibly debilitating,</p>
<p>even deadly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the reality is that this literature</p>
<p>and this clinical history and all of the research we have</p>
<p>was the godsend that I needed to do the work that I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Otherwise I would have been discredited on day one.</p>
<p>Chris Palmer&rsquo;s claiming that a dietary change</p>
<p>can influence schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a quack.</p>
<p>But the thing that immediately got me credibility</p>
<p>was I didn&rsquo;t focus on it as a diet.</p>
<p>I did a deep dive into the epilepsy literature.</p>
<p>So the ketogenic diet, unbeknownst to most people,</p>
<p>was actually developed 100 years ago, 1921,</p>
<p>by a physician for one and only one purpose,</p>
<p>to treat epilepsy.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t developed as a weight loss diet.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t developed as the diet</p>
<p>that all human beings should follow.</p>
<p>And the reason it was developed</p>
<p>is because of this longstanding observation</p>
<p>since the time of Hippocrates,</p>
<p>that fasting can stop seizures.</p>
<p>Now fasting is not a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Fasting is the process of no diet.</p>
<p>So we now understand a tremendous amount of science.</p>
<p>Most people think going without food is bad</p>
<p>and they equate it with starvation.</p>
<p>But in fact, when we go without food,</p>
<p>it causes tremendous shifts in metabolism,</p>
<p>both brain and body metabolism.</p>
<p>And it puts the body into a mode of autophagy</p>
<p>and conservation of resources and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>That are beneficial to human health.</p>
<p>And this is why fasting has been used</p>
<p>as a therapeutic intervention in almost every culture</p>
<p>and almost every religion for millennia.</p>
<p>But for the most part,</p>
<p>that was all thought to be religious folklore.</p>
<p>That was just crazy talk.</p>
<p>And those stupid people way back then,</p>
<p>thought God cured everything.</p>
<p>And so they fasted</p>
<p>and they just assumed that they were getting better.</p>
<p>Well, in 1921,</p>
<p>one physician used intermittent fasting</p>
<p>on a child with seizures and found that,</p>
<p>oh, lo and behold, this religious folklore stuff</p>
<p>has something to it.</p>
<p>It actually worked.</p>
<p>The problem with fasting is that you can only fast</p>
<p>for so long before you starve to death.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a very effective treatment.</p>
<p>And this child was ingesting water, correct?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Food elimination fasting.</p>
<p>Food elimination.</p>
<p>So no special diet.</p>
<p>But the problem with fasting for epilepsy</p>
<p>is that as soon as people start eating a normal diet again,</p>
<p>their seizures usually come right back.</p>
<p>Oftentimes with a vengeance.</p>
<p>And so it can be a good short-term intervention.</p>
<p>The fasting can take a few days</p>
<p>because it can take a few days to get ketosis.</p>
<p>And then you can get some relief from chronic seizures.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not a good long-term treatment</p>
<p>because, again, people will starve to death.</p>
<p>As soon as they start eating, seizures come back.</p>
<p>So it was actually Dr. Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic</p>
<p>who developed the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>with one and only one purpose.</p>
<p>He wanted to see, can we mimic the fasting state</p>
<p>using this special diet</p>
<p>to see if it might stop seizures long-term?</p>
<p>And lo and behold, it worked.</p>
<p>Early results were extraordinarily positive.</p>
<p>50% of patients who used the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>became seizure-free.</p>
<p>And another 35% had a 50% or greater reduction</p>
<p>in their seizure frequency.</p>
<p>So about 85% efficacy rate.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to do that there.</p>
<p>Was it just for pediatric epilepsy</p>
<p>or for adult epilepsy as well?</p>
<p>So back in the 1920s,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have many anti-epilepsy treatments.</p>
<p>And a lot of adults were struggling as well.</p>
<p>So they were using it on anybody who would do the diet.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, pharmaceuticals were coming out</p>
<p>and we had many more anti-combulsant treatments.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no question, they work for a lot of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And taking a pill is so much easier than doing this diet.</p>
<p>So the diet pretty much fell out of favor</p>
<p>and nobody was using it from the 1950s to about the 70s.</p>
<p>But lo and behold, even to this day,</p>
<p>people with epilepsy, about 30% don&rsquo;t respond</p>
<p>to the current treatments that we have available.</p>
<p>30% will have treatment-resistant epilepsy,</p>
<p>which means they continue to have seizures</p>
<p>no matter how many anti-combulsants they&rsquo;re taking.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;ve had brain surgery,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t stop their seizures.</p>
<p>And so in the 1970s,</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet was resurrected at Johns Hopkins</p>
<p>for these treatment-resistant cases.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, it works.</p>
<p>Not for all of them, but it works.</p>
<p>And about one third become seizure-free.</p>
<p>And these are people who&rsquo;ve tried everything</p>
<p>and nothing&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>So one third becomes seizure-free.</p>
<p>Another third get a clinical benefit,</p>
<p>meaning a 50% or greater reduction</p>
<p>in their seizure frequency.</p>
<p>And the other third, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always clear if that&rsquo;s because of non-compliance</p>
<p>or if that&rsquo;s because the diet&rsquo;s just not working.</p>
<p>But about a third, a third, a third.</p>
<p>Seizure freedom, reduction in seizures,</p>
<p>or it just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And so the reality, the godsend for me</p>
<p>is that we have decades of neuroscience research</p>
<p>on the ketogenic diet and what it is doing to the brain.</p>
<p>We know that the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>is influencing neurotransmitter levels,</p>
<p>in particular glutamate, GABA, adenosine.</p>
<p>It changes calcium channel regulation and calcium levels,</p>
<p>which is really important in the function of cells.</p>
<p>It changes gene expression.</p>
<p>It reduces brain inflammation.</p>
<p>It changes the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And gut microbiome is a huge topic right now.</p>
<p>And there are some researchers who argue</p>
<p>that is the primary benefit of the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing the gut microbiome in beneficial ways.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s doing a lot of things.</p>
<p>It obviously improves insulin resistance,</p>
<p>lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels,</p>
<p>which improves insulin signaling.</p>
<p>The key for my research that I&rsquo;ve outlined,</p>
<p>the real magic is that this diet</p>
<p>stimulates two processes that relate to mitochondria.</p>
<p>It stimulates a process called mitophagy,</p>
<p>which is getting rid of old and defective mitochondria</p>
<p>and replacing them with new ones.</p>
<p>And it also stimulates a process</p>
<p>called mitochondrial biogenesis,</p>
<p>which means that after people have done</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet for a while, months or years,</p>
<p>many of their cells in their bodies and brains</p>
<p>will have more mitochondria</p>
<p>and those mitochondria will be healthier.</p>
<p>And I believe that is the reason</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet is such a powerful treatment,</p>
<p>not only for epilepsy,</p>
<p>but also for people with chronic mental disorders.</p>
<p>Would you mind listing off a few of the mental disorders?</p>
<p>And I know this is not meant to be inside ball,</p>
<p>but we should distinguish between psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>and neurological symptoms and diseases.</p>
<p>The fields of psychiatry and neurology,</p>
<p>hopefully someday we&rsquo;ll just merge.</p>
<p>But for instance, typically if somebody is presenting</p>
<p>with something that looks like Alzheimer&rsquo;s, dementia,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll talk to a neurologist.</p>
<p>Whereas if somebody is presenting with symptoms</p>
<p>like schizophrenia, bipolar, they&rsquo;ll talk to a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>But if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind wearing a dual hat,</p>
<p>could you just quickly list off</p>
<p>some of the neurologic and psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>for which ketogenic, or let&rsquo;s just say nutrition changes</p>
<p>have been shown to improve symptoms significantly.</p>
<p>And then maybe we can dive into a couple of these</p>
<p>as well as get more deeply into</p>
<p>these two very interesting aspects</p>
<p>of mitochondrial function and repair and turnover.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the field, you know,</p>
<p>in terms of nutritional psychiatry, it&rsquo;s a broad field</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in its infancy is the real answer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for randomized controlled trials,</p>
<p>documenting efficacy in large numbers of patients</p>
<p>with these disorders, we don&rsquo;t have them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re underway now, but we don&rsquo;t have them yet.</p>
<p>What we do have are case studies.</p>
<p>We have a lot of mechanistic science papers</p>
<p>by some of the leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists</p>
<p>in the world and neurologists in the world</p>
<p>kind of outlining, this is everything we know</p>
<p>that the ketogenic diet&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>These are the problems in the brains of people</p>
<p>with these chronic mental or neurological disorders.</p>
<p>So we know that they should work.</p>
<p>But the disorders range from chronic depression to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a trial underway for PTSD.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got one actually decent pilot trial</p>
<p>from the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>for the ketogenic diet for alcohol use disorder</p>
<p>of all things, and we can go into that a little more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a couple of pilot trials</p>
<p>of the ketogenic diet for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got, and those are randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got case studies of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>for chronic depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The largest study that we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>in that mental health sphere is a pilot study</p>
<p>of 31 patients admitted to a French hospital.</p>
<p>The 28 of those patients were able to do the diet</p>
<p>and stay on the diet.</p>
<p>So 10% off the bat, non-compliant, couldn&rsquo;t do the diet.</p>
<p>So we need to include that.</p>
<p>But of the 28 patients who were able to do,</p>
<p>and these are 28 patients</p>
<p>with treatment-resistant mental disorders,</p>
<p>chronic depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Of the patients who were able to do the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>100% had at least some improvement in symptoms.</p>
<p>46% had remission of illness.</p>
<p>That does not happen with current treatments.</p>
<p>And 64%, I think, were discharged on less medicine</p>
<p>than they went into the hospital on.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t that the people</p>
<p>were prescribing more medicine,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they were being discharged</p>
<p>on less medication.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got at least, again,</p>
<p>a lot of the hardcore scientists are gonna say,</p>
<p>show us the randomized controlled trials</p>
<p>with hundreds of patients.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got five randomized controlled trials</p>
<p>underway now, funded primarily through philanthropy.</p>
<p>I can tell you that, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about that one index patient,</p>
<p>but at this point, I have now treated dozens of patients,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve heard from hundreds of patients</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been treated by other clinicians, researchers,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve just heard from patients from around the world</p>
<p>who have shared stories of complete remission</p>
<p>of long, chronic mental disorders,</p>
<p>like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia,</p>
<p>off of psychiatric meds, some of them, not all of them,</p>
<p>but some of them are able to get off all psychiatric meds</p>
<p>and remain in remission.</p>
<p>Again, I think, I didn&rsquo;t say this before,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really important to mention.</p>
<p>For people who might be unfamiliar</p>
<p>with the mental health field</p>
<p>and its connection with epilepsy,</p>
<p>the reason that it&rsquo;s such an important connection</p>
<p>is that we use epilepsy treatments</p>
<p>in psychiatric patients every day</p>
<p>in tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>So a lot of people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll list off some names</p>
<p>that a lot of your listeners may have heard of,</p>
<p>and they probably know them as psychiatric drugs,</p>
<p>but in fact, these are epilepsy drugs.</p>
<p>Depakote, Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax,</p>
<p>Neurontin or Gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax.</p>
<p>Those are all medications that stop seizures,</p>
<p>and many of them were developed initially for seizures,</p>
<p>but we in the mental health field quickly steal them</p>
<p>and start using them in tens of millions of people,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re off-label.</p>
<p>So that means we don&rsquo;t have research studies</p>
<p>documenting that they&rsquo;re effective,</p>
<p>but we go ahead and use them anyway</p>
<p>because the reality is far too many patients</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t getting better with the FDA-approved treatments</p>
<p>that we do have to offer.</p>
<p>So psychiatrists are just winging it in some cases,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just throwing whatever we can at them,</p>
<p>and we absolutely include epilepsy treatments.</p>
<p>So in many ways, using the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>as a treatment for serious mental disorders</p>
<p>is nothing new at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an established evidence-based treatment for epilepsy.</p>
<p>We use evidence-based treatments for epilepsy</p>
<p>across the board for a wide range of mental disorders,</p>
<p>and so in many ways, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>with the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>It just happens to be a diet.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it, and I should say I love it</p>
<p>because we had a guest on here early days of the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a colleague of mine at Stanford.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bioengineer and a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>a phenomenal scientist and psychiatrist,</p>
<p>Karl Deisseroth, who won the Lasker Prize</p>
<p>and so on and so forth,</p>
<p>and he made a really important point,</p>
<p>which should have been obvious to me,</p>
<p>but wasn&rsquo;t until he said it,</p>
<p>which was the psychiatrist has tools</p>
<p>just like the surgeon has tools,</p>
<p>but the tools are language and observing behavior.</p>
<p>Those are the dissection tools</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s going on in someone&rsquo;s brain,</p>
<p>and then as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators,</p>
<p>and you mentioned that there are these tools</p>
<p>of altering brain chemistry,</p>
<p>which are of the sorts of drugs you just listed off</p>
<p>or antidepressants or antipsychotics</p>
<p>that fall into these major bins of adjusting dopamine</p>
<p>or adjusting serotonin or some combination</p>
<p>of dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, adenosine,</p>
<p>and on and on and on,</p>
<p>and it seems to me it&rsquo;s an incredible field,</p>
<p>that the field is still very much in its infancy,</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t but 100 years ago</p>
<p>that people were measuring bumps on the head</p>
<p>as a way to diagnose phrenology,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s still so much to learn,</p>
<p>and so when I hear you say,</p>
<p>adjusting nutrition or putting people</p>
<p>into a ketogenic state</p>
<p>or even just eliminating highly processed foods,</p>
<p>sugars, et cetera,</p>
<p>taking care of metabolic syndrome</p>
<p>and then observing tremendous relief</p>
<p>in clinical syndromes or symptoms, rather,</p>
<p>of psychiatric disorders,</p>
<p>it makes perfect sense to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yet another dissection tool</p>
<p>and a tool for altering brain chemistry.</p>
<p>I think that if I think about the landscape,</p>
<p>the sort of sociology out there of,</p>
<p>again, it seemed to be these bins,</p>
<p>like a third of people saying,</p>
<p>of course, diet and exercise and social connection</p>
<p>and limiting stress,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the good stuff,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the stuff that we know really works,</p>
<p>and then about a third of people are sort of unclear,</p>
<p>and then a third of people think,</p>
<p>well, if it&rsquo;s not a prescription drug,</p>
<p>then it just has no place in medicine,</p>
<p>and hopefully that&rsquo;s changing,</p>
<p>and certainly the work that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is gonna be important in that transition</p>
<p>that I think we will see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about mitophagy</p>
<p>and mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>
<p>I think most people learn that the mitochondria</p>
<p>are the energy factories of cells</p>
<p>and that indeed they are.</p>
<p>As a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>what I know about them</p>
<p>is that they are present everywhere in neurons,</p>
<p>not just in the so-called cell body,</p>
<p>but you can find mitochondria</p>
<p>in the furthest little bits of neurons,</p>
<p>and neurons can be quite big,</p>
<p>very large, in fact, meters long or more in some cases,</p>
<p>in some species, including us,</p>
<p>depending on how tall somebody is,</p>
<p>could be many meters or several meters rather,</p>
<p>and that mitochondria do a lot of stuff</p>
<p>besides just produce energy,</p>
<p>because I think people hear mitochondria energy</p>
<p>and they think, oh, so these patients felt better,</p>
<p>they lost weight, they have more energy,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re doing better,</p>
<p>but here we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>remission of auditory hallucinations,</p>
<p>people feeling suicidal</p>
<p>and then changing their diet</p>
<p>and feeling like life is something they can deal with</p>
<p>and maybe even function extremely well and et cetera.</p>
<p>So maybe we could just talk about mitochondria for a moment</p>
<p>and then talk about these two major effects.</p>
<p>What are some of the other things</p>
<p>that mitochondria are important for in neurons</p>
<p>and maybe other cells of the brain?</p>
<p>Because as an access point for all this,</p>
<p>I think it would be great if people could learn</p>
<p>a little mitochondrial biology.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, so I guess the first thing that I&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>is that, you know, this field</p>
<p>is one of the most cutting edge fields</p>
<p>in medicine right now.</p>
<p>20 years ago or so, I think the majority</p>
<p>of research scientists thought of mitochondria</p>
<p>as nothing more than little batteries.</p>
<p>They take food and oxygen and turn it into ATP</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Yeah, we get that, but they&rsquo;re just little batteries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all they are.</p>
<p>And so one of the reasons that this work is so important</p>
<p>is because it combines cutting edge research</p>
<p>in the metabolic field and the aging field</p>
<p>and we can start to pair it with the mental health</p>
<p>and neurological health field.</p>
<p>So mitochondria, you know, one scientist</p>
<p>gave me this analogy.</p>
<p>He said, if you think of the cell as a computer,</p>
<p>a lot of people think of mitochondria</p>
<p>as the power cord to that computer</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re providing the power</p>
<p>and they are in fact the power cord to that computer.</p>
<p>But actually their real function is the motherboard</p>
<p>of that computer.</p>
<p>So mitochondria are directing and allocating resources</p>
<p>throughout a cell.</p>
<p>That is their primary function</p>
<p>and then they happen to be powerhouses as well.</p>
<p>And so to give some clear examples,</p>
<p>mitochondria play a direct role in the production</p>
<p>and release and regulation</p>
<p>of some really key neurotransmitters</p>
<p>including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Those are pretty powerful neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>I would consider those the,</p>
<p>I know you listed more than three,</p>
<p>but the sort of primary colors of neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Any one of those in excess or deficiency</p>
<p>is going to have profound negative effects</p>
<p>on a nervous system</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s gonna alter the way that people and animals feel,</p>
<p>think, move, remember, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so mitochondria are providing</p>
<p>both some of the building blocks, if you will,</p>
<p>for some of those molecules.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re part of the Krebs citric acid cycle.</p>
<p>Some of the intermediate products</p>
<p>actually go into making those neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Much more importantly, mitochondria provide the energy</p>
<p>for the production of those neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and fascinatingly, mitochondria are directly related</p>
<p>to the release of neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>ATP alone is not enough.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been some research studies</p>
<p>that have actually found that mitochondria</p>
<p>move along the membrane of the synapse</p>
<p>to release batches of vesicles of neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and that if the mitochondria are removed from the synapse</p>
<p>and researchers flood that cell with ATP,</p>
<p>neurotransmitters usually are not getting released.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are doing other things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t entirely even understand what all they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>or how they&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re doing other things</p>
<p>than just providing the power.</p>
<p>Another really important example</p>
<p>is that mitochondria are actually</p>
<p>the primary regulators of epigenetics.</p>
<p>If you look at any one factor,</p>
<p>so one study actually found that they&rsquo;re responsible</p>
<p>for the expression of about 60% of the genes in a cell.</p>
<p>Mitochondria do this through a lot of ways</p>
<p>that have been known for years and sometimes decades.</p>
<p>So mitochondria are directly related</p>
<p>to the levels of reactive oxygen species in a cell.</p>
<p>They are managing calcium regulation in cells.</p>
<p>And we know that those things play a role</p>
<p>in epigenetic expression.</p>
<p>We know the levels of ATP to ADP or AMP also play a role</p>
<p>and mitochondria are doing those things.</p>
<p>But it turns out mitochondria</p>
<p>are actually doing much more sophisticated things</p>
<p>than even those in terms of gene expression.</p>
<p>Mitochondria at least play a role</p>
<p>in all of the aspects of the human stress response.</p>
<p>So when humans are stressed,</p>
<p>either physically or psychologically,</p>
<p>there are several things that happen.</p>
<p>Increased cortisol, increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,</p>
<p>inflammation, and gene expression</p>
<p>in particular in the hippocampus occur</p>
<p>with the stress response.</p>
<p>And one group of researchers actually</p>
<p>genetically modified mitochondria in four different ways</p>
<p>and found that all of the stress response,</p>
<p>all those four buckets of stress response</p>
<p>were impacted in one way or another,</p>
<p>implying that mitochondria</p>
<p>are somehow playing a role in those.</p>
<p>In terms of their role in cortisol,</p>
<p>we know that mitochondria actually have the enzyme required</p>
<p>for the synthesis of steroid hormones.</p>
<p>So that includes cortisol, estrogen,</p>
<p>testosterone, and progesterone,</p>
<p>some names that maybe everybody&rsquo;s heard of.</p>
<p>And so that means that if mitochondria</p>
<p>are in short supply or dysfunctional,</p>
<p>the production of those hormones may become dysregulated.</p>
<p>Mitochondria play a direct role in inflammation</p>
<p>and they turn the inflammatory system both on,</p>
<p>or they at least play a role</p>
<p>in turning the inflammatory system both on and off.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to quote</p>
<p>the exact study and author,</p>
<p>but one paper in Cell actually identified mitochondria</p>
<p>as the key regulator</p>
<p>in turning certain inflammatory cells off.</p>
<p>And that when you inhibit mitochondrial function,</p>
<p>those cells don&rsquo;t turn off.</p>
<p>That mitochondrial levels of reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>are a key signaling process</p>
<p>to turn the inflammatory process off.</p>
<p>Another study found that macrophages,</p>
<p>so macrophages are an important immune cell</p>
<p>that play a role in healing.</p>
<p>So if you cut yourself,</p>
<p>your body will send inflammation that way</p>
<p>and send immune cells that way to try to heal your skin.</p>
<p>And macrophages play an important role in that healing.</p>
<p>One group of researchers tried to figure out</p>
<p>how do macrophages know to switch</p>
<p>between the different phases of wound healing?</p>
<p>Because the macrophages do different things</p>
<p>in the different phases of wound healing.</p>
<p>And the conclusion of all of their research</p>
<p>was that it&rsquo;s mitochondria.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are sending the essential signals</p>
<p>that change the state of the macrophages</p>
<p>to induce these different phases of wound healing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve just talked about neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation.</p>
<p>For anybody familiar with the mental health field,</p>
<p>they know these are like some of the key variables</p>
<p>that researchers have been struggling with for decades,</p>
<p>trying to figure out how do these fit together?</p>
<p>We know that all of those buckets</p>
<p>can be disrupted in people with mental disorders.</p>
<p>And our field has struggled to understand</p>
<p>but how do they fit together?</p>
<p>How can we make sense of this disruption?</p>
<p>And I believe once you understand the science of mitochondria</p>
<p>you can actually connect all of the dots</p>
<p>of the mental illness puzzle.</p>
<p>Super interesting little sub-cellular goodies</p>
<p>these mitochondria are.</p>
<p>I come from a field where people are often divided</p>
<p>into lumpers and splitters and I&rsquo;m somewhere in between.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>lumpers are people that like to make things really simple,</p>
<p>lists of no more than three functions</p>
<p>or dividing brain areas into no more than three.</p>
<p>Splitters are people that like to subdivide</p>
<p>into a ton of detail.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a history of scientists being splitters</p>
<p>in order to be able to name things after themselves</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s more territory to go around</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re splitting than if you&rsquo;re lumping.</p>
<p>But we are doing neither here.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m hearing is that mitochondria,</p>
<p>in addition to being important sources</p>
<p>of energy production and output in cells,</p>
<p>which of course they are, probably have other roles</p>
<p>and that maybe someday what we call mitochondria</p>
<p>will actually be two or three different</p>
<p>little sub-cellular organelles.</p>
<p>Like there may be little bits in there</p>
<p>that are controlling gene expression</p>
<p>and little bits in there</p>
<p>that are controlling neurotransmitter production.</p>
<p>At least for now, the name is mitochondria.</p>
<p>And thank you, by the way,</p>
<p>for illustrating some of the other things that they do</p>
<p>because in the landscape of science education,</p>
<p>oftentimes people think, okay, energy production,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a picture or a cartoon of mitochondria</p>
<p>like flexing its muscles.</p>
<p>People go, okay, energy, mitochondria, mighty mitochondria.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll think,</p>
<p>oh, you know, they&rsquo;re just sort of like</p>
<p>a dumb jock portion of the cell, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not doing anything sophisticated.</p>
<p>And everything you listed off</p>
<p>is that they are doing many sophisticated,</p>
<p>intricate things within cells.</p>
<p>So I think how things are cartooned and discussed</p>
<p>actually has an impact</p>
<p>and not just on the general public,</p>
<p>but on the medical field and on the science fields.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s more science sociology.</p>
<p>But now that everyone is well aware</p>
<p>that mitochondria are doing a large number</p>
<p>of very important things in a very regulated way,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about mitophagy.</p>
<p>You know, a few years ago,</p>
<p>because a Nobel prize was given for autophagy,</p>
<p>sometimes called autophagy.</p>
<p>Look, people, you can say it either way.</p>
<p>People know hopefully what it means is more important,</p>
<p>which is the gobbling up of one&rsquo;s own cells</p>
<p>that are dead or injured.</p>
<p>And this idea of autophagy,</p>
<p>of cells being eaten up or within a system,</p>
<p>nervous system or other system,</p>
<p>has come up again and again.</p>
<p>I actually wasn&rsquo;t aware that mitophagy</p>
<p>could be such an important lever.</p>
<p>So tell us about mitophagy,</p>
<p>which I have to presume is the intentional</p>
<p>or not gobbling up of mitochondria,</p>
<p>presumably to replace them</p>
<p>with newer, healthier mitochondria.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>So in many ways, mitophagy is a subset of autophagy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s got its own name</p>
<p>because it is specific to mitochondria.</p>
<p>There do appear to be some unique regulators of mitophagy</p>
<p>compared to autophagy more broadly.</p>
<p>Mitochondria actually are playing a role</p>
<p>in autophagy itself.</p>
<p>And this makes sense because one of,</p>
<p>so the global picture of autophagy</p>
<p>is stimulated by fasting states or fasting mimicking states.</p>
<p>So when your body senses that you don&rsquo;t have enough food,</p>
<p>it actually hunkers down</p>
<p>and starts to recycle dead old parts</p>
<p>in this kind of carefully orchestrated way.</p>
<p>And it takes them to lysosomes, they get degraded,</p>
<p>and then those degradation products get used</p>
<p>for either energy or to build new things.</p>
<p>Autophagy is always occurring at a low level,</p>
<p>but you can really hyper-stimulate the process</p>
<p>through fasting, calorie restriction,</p>
<p>fasting mimicking diets, other things.</p>
<p>And this is why fasting and calorie restriction</p>
<p>is so kind of such hot topics in the medical field now</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;ve been shown to induce longevity</p>
<p>and we think it&rsquo;s probably through that process</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re stimulating the body</p>
<p>to kind of become lean and conservative</p>
<p>in terms of its allocation of resources.</p>
<p>And the body doesn&rsquo;t just destroy the healthiest tissue</p>
<p>along with the old dead stuff.</p>
<p>It has these processes that identify</p>
<p>the old and defective parts first and they go first</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s beautiful about the whole thing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why fasting is so important.</p>
<p>So mitophagy we know plays a really important role</p>
<p>because so there&rsquo;s this term called mitochondrial dysfunction</p>
<p>which some researchers are actually wanting to get rid of</p>
<p>and move away from because as you just said,</p>
<p>mitochondria do so many different things</p>
<p>and different mitochondria even within the same cell</p>
<p>may very well be specializing in different tasks</p>
<p>and mitochondria from one cell to another</p>
<p>are sometimes doing very different things.</p>
<p>Like not all mitochondria can produce cortisol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s specific to specific cells</p>
<p>where those genes are getting turned on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like all mitochondria are producing cortisol</p>
<p>just the ones in your adrenal gland for instance</p>
<p>are producing cortisol.</p>
<p>But there is this term mitochondrial dysfunction</p>
<p>and it has long been known for decades</p>
<p>that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated</p>
<p>with everything that ails us essentially.</p>
<p>So in the 1950s we had a theory of aging</p>
<p>that was based on reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>and that essentially and that&rsquo;s where all the inflammation</p>
<p>is bad for you comes from.</p>
<p>And where all the noise about antioxidants.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like in the 90s it was like it contains antioxidants.</p>
<p>Not to say antioxidants are bad</p>
<p>but they are certainly not the be all end all of health.</p>
<p>They are not but that&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>where that research came from</p>
<p>is that researchers were narrowing in</p>
<p>on these reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>are highly, highly correlated with all of the diseases</p>
<p>of aging and poor health outcomes.</p>
<p>Turns out they&rsquo;re also highly, highly correlated</p>
<p>with all chronic mental disorders interestingly.</p>
<p>And so researchers used antioxidants to see</p>
<p>if well maybe if we can stop somehow tame</p>
<p>these reactive oxygen species will improve health outcomes.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
<p>By the 1970s our understanding of mitochondria</p>
<p>and their role in the production</p>
<p>of reactive oxygen species expanded</p>
<p>and that led to the mitochondrial theory of aging.</p>
<p>So in the 1970s we had this mitochondrial theory of aging</p>
<p>based primarily and exclusively on reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of decades that was disproven</p>
<p>because we now know reactive oxygen species aren&rsquo;t all bad.</p>
<p>They actually serve a signaling process.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a normal part of human functioning</p>
<p>and cellular function.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not all bad but we still know high levels</p>
<p>of reactive oxygen species are bad for you.</p>
<p>Fast forward to just I think maybe last year</p>
<p>with this expanded role of all of the different things</p>
<p>mitochondria are doing.</p>
<p>So David Sinclair published a paper</p>
<p>in one of the cell journals I think</p>
<p>saying that oh mitochondria are actually the unifying link</p>
<p>of everything that we know about aging.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are the cause or defective mitochondria</p>
<p>or defective mitochondrial function,</p>
<p>mitochondrial dysfunction is possibly the unifying cause</p>
<p>of aging and all of the aging related disorders.</p>
<p>So mitophagy is trying to address all that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to say okay this is bad,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want defective mitochondria</p>
<p>and how can we get rid of old ones or defective ones</p>
<p>and replace them with new ones.</p>
<p>And I think the most powerful signal</p>
<p>and tool that we have right now is in fact related to diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s calorie restriction that is the oldest,</p>
<p>truest kind of best proven way to prevent aging</p>
<p>in a wide variety of animal species.</p>
<p>Fasting and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and again you can only do those things for so long</p>
<p>and then fasting mimicking diets</p>
<p>can also stimulate this process of mitophagy.</p>
<p>Before we talk about mitochondrial biogenesis,</p>
<p>if and I certainly accept the idea</p>
<p>that mitochondria are extremely important</p>
<p>in physical health and mental health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for me is a straightforward conclusion at this point</p>
<p>based on what you&rsquo;ve said, what I&rsquo;ve read elsewhere,</p>
<p>et cetera and if various diets,</p>
<p>including ketogenic diet, including fasting,</p>
<p>reducing sugar intake, et cetera</p>
<p>can assist in mitochondrial function and mitophagy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s at least one of the levers</p>
<p>by which diet can positively impact mental health</p>
<p>and physical health.</p>
<p>Can we conclude that there&rsquo;s something special</p>
<p>about low blood glucose in the brain, right?</p>
<p>I mean that the sort of common pathway</p>
<p>of all of those things, fasting, ketogenesis</p>
<p>for some people maybe they,</p>
<p>maybe some people manage have great insulin management.</p>
<p>So just removing sweets, refined sugars,</p>
<p>brings down their blood glucose level substantially.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to go on a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>in order to relieve a low level depression</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It seems like the common theme here</p>
<p>is that glucose levels in the brain need to be reduced,</p>
<p>which for me is surprising because neurons love glucose.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some really nice studies,</p>
<p>one that I can think of recently</p>
<p>that was published in Neuron.</p>
<p>If you just look at the tuning of a neuron,</p>
<p>how well a neuron in the brain</p>
<p>represents some visual image in the environment</p>
<p>in terms of, here we can just generalize</p>
<p>and saying more action potentials,</p>
<p>more electrical signals from the neuron</p>
<p>generally correlates with better high fidelity representation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like sort of, you have everyone&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>someone says shout and then someone shouts</p>
<p>the neuron is like the one responding to the order</p>
<p>and these neurons just when there&rsquo;s high glucose,</p>
<p>they are faithful representatives</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s out there in the world.</p>
<p>But then when you fast an animal,</p>
<p>they become less faithful representatives</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>And yet when I&rsquo;ve done intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and I do a kind of modified version of it,</p>
<p>my mental clarity is far better</p>
<p>than when I&rsquo;ve had a big bowl of pasta,</p>
<p>probably for other reasons,</p>
<p>related to serotonin and tryptophan.</p>
<p>And so I think for the typical listener out there,</p>
<p>I have to imagine it&rsquo;s gotta be a little confusing, right?</p>
<p>We hear neurons love glucose, they live on glucose.</p>
<p>And here we&rsquo;re saying, let&rsquo;s deprive them of some glucose</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s just bring glucose levels down</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s switch the fuel source of the brain</p>
<p>from glucose to ketones.</p>
<p>And now the brain really works the way it&rsquo;s supposed to.</p>
<p>So this raises a little bit of a just so story question,</p>
<p>like why would it be the case that neurons love glucose</p>
<p>and yet if there&rsquo;s too much glucose around,</p>
<p>they become sick?</p>
<p>And of course with any, why would it be story?</p>
<p>As I always say, I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to presume</p>
<p>that you weren&rsquo;t consulted the design phase either.</p>
<p>And that if any of us say that we are,</p>
<p>then we are probably the patients that need evaluation.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a name for that, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s delusion, right?</p>
<p>Okay, I threw up my first correct clinical assessment</p>
<p>of myself.</p>
<p>So how do I get my head around this, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got me sold on mitochondria,</p>
<p>not that I needed to be sold, but that&rsquo;s an easy,</p>
<p>like, yes, yes, absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>The idea that diet can impact mental health</p>
<p>and physical health.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, by way of mitochondria, at least in part.</p>
<p>Great, but then neurons love glucose.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on or what do you think is going on?</p>
<p>I am not convinced that glucose is the real story.</p>
<p>Glucose may in fact be a symptom.</p>
<p>So we know that parts of the brain,</p>
<p>there have been a couple of studies</p>
<p>that just came out in the last couple of weeks, I think,</p>
<p>documenting that actually astrocytes in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>play a key role in glucose regulation throughout the body.</p>
<p>And it appears to be a metabolic role,</p>
<p>which in my mind implies that the mitochondria</p>
<p>in those astrocytes are probably playing a key role</p>
<p>because we know mitochondria play a key role</p>
<p>in sensing glucose levels.</p>
<p>They play a key role in the release of insulin</p>
<p>from the pancreas.</p>
<p>But mitochondria in the brain is also playing a role</p>
<p>in kind of balancing how much glucose is around.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a difficult question</p>
<p>because I think in some cases,</p>
<p>high glucose levels are actually a symptom</p>
<p>of metabolic dysfunction somewhere in the body or brain.</p>
<p>And when I think about, well, what does that mean?</p>
<p>In my mind, most of the evidence currently</p>
<p>is pointing to mitochondrial dysfunction</p>
<p>somewhere in the body or brain</p>
<p>that is the most likely cause of that dysregulation</p>
<p>of glucose levels.</p>
<p>But we know that if you consume massive amounts</p>
<p>of junk food, sugar, and other things,</p>
<p>that you can get dysregulation of glucose levels.</p>
<p>The conundrum though is that that&rsquo;s not a universal response.</p>
<p>And what about the typical person?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve never really liked junk food that much.</p>
<p>Maybe as a kid, I can recall liking candy,</p>
<p>but I was a sandwich for lunch person for a long time.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve changed that out for salad</p>
<p>and maybe a small piece of meat with my salad</p>
<p>or something like that, I feel far better during the day,</p>
<p>far more alert, but I do eat carbohydrates.</p>
<p>I eat starches typically at night,</p>
<p>but I tend to do some very hard training</p>
<p>at some point during the day.</p>
<p>So I imagine I have some glycogen to repack.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>I only mentioned that because I&rsquo;m not in ketosis</p>
<p>as far as I know, unless you brought the strips.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the blood glucose test today.</p>
<p>So what about the typical person who&rsquo;s an omnivore</p>
<p>eating some rice, some pasta, pasta salads,</p>
<p>people that are eating not junk food,</p>
<p>massive amounts of sugar,</p>
<p>but have blood glucose that&rsquo;s in kind of moderate range.</p>
<p>Do you think, and here, feel free to speculate,</p>
<p>do you think that those people might feel far better</p>
<p>or even a little bit better</p>
<p>if they were in a lower glucose state?</p>
<p>And I ask this because I think there are a lot of people</p>
<p>out there who suffer from full-blown depression,</p>
<p>but there are also a lot of people who suffer</p>
<p>from like moodiness and feeling not so great,</p>
<p>subclinical depression.</p>
<p>Yes, burnout is what I would call it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just feeling like some days are great</p>
<p>and then other days they feel lousy</p>
<p>for reasons they don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And those make for less dramatic case studies,</p>
<p>and yet I have to assume that that description</p>
<p>will net a large fraction of the general public.</p>
<p>So the way that I kind of break this field,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m probably getting too nerdy right now,</p>
<p>but I kind of break this field into cause,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the actual root cause,</p>
<p>and what are effective treatments?</p>
<p>And I really see them as two separate things.</p>
<p>Just because the ketogenic diet is an effective treatment</p>
<p>does not imply that the cause of the problem</p>
<p>was eating carbohydrates.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a really important distinction.</p>
<p>There are many people who disagree with me on that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s heard people say,</p>
<p>sugar is the cause of everything that ails you,</p>
<p>or carbs are the cause of everything that ails you.</p>
<p>If everybody does a low carb diet or a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>and then they go to, so it must be sugar that was the cause.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it as clearly black and white as that.</p>
<p>The calorie restriction, ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>carbohydrate restriction,</p>
<p>are inducing metabolic changes in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And regardless of what the person was eating,</p>
<p>they are inducing metabolic changes</p>
<p>that can be really beneficial to brain health.</p>
<p>So let me just give a clear black and white example of this,</p>
<p>and then I can speak to the broader topic</p>
<p>that you brought up about just the general population.</p>
<p>The easy example of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>being an effective intervention</p>
<p>for somebody who was not following a bad diet</p>
<p>is an infant with epilepsy.</p>
<p>There are lots of infants who have uncontrollable seizures.</p>
<p>They are drinking breast milk.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge,</p>
<p>that is the primary most beneficial food source,</p>
<p>an infant could be consuming.</p>
<p>Now, some might say, well, maybe the mother&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>whatever, I don&rsquo;t buy that.</p>
<p>The mother&rsquo;s breast milk is in fact</p>
<p>the optimal food source for that infant,</p>
<p>and yet that infant is still seizing.</p>
<p>If we put that infant on a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>a lot of those infants seizures will stop.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that the cause of the infant seizures</p>
<p>was a bad diet,</p>
<p>but it means a dietary intervention</p>
<p>can change brain metabolism</p>
<p>and improve symptoms in that person.</p>
<p>So going to your broader question about adults modern day,</p>
<p>the real answer is, you know,</p>
<p>there was just this conference in London,</p>
<p>the Royal College of Obesity Medicine</p>
<p>or something like that, that&rsquo;s not the name,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something along those lines.</p>
<p>The conclusion of that conference,</p>
<p>it invited the greatest minds in obesity medicine.</p>
<p>The overarching conclusion of that conference was,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what causes obesity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important that we sit with that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what causes obesity.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think excess caloric intake</p>
<p>beyond one&rsquo;s daily metabolic needs is causing obesity.</p>
<p>Some will argue that,</p>
<p>and so some will say, yes, it&rsquo;s all energy balance,</p>
<p>but why do we have an epidemic of obesity?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the gazillion dollar question.</p>
<p>And junk, some will say it&rsquo;s all the junk food,</p>
<p>but we had junk food in the 1970s.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, I grew up on Kool-Aid</p>
<p>and Twinkies and King Dongs and Ho-Hos.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m re-watching the Mad Men series now.</p>
<p>I love that series and I&rsquo;m re-watching it.</p>
<p>And I happen to know someone who worked on that series.</p>
<p>They research everything for the props</p>
<p>and the costumes and everything, but right down to diet.</p>
<p>And if you look at the diet, it was terrible.</p>
<p>It was mostly, yes, there was a lot of excessive amounts</p>
<p>of drinking and cigarette smoking,</p>
<p>but the diets were terrible.</p>
<p>It was prepackaged foods.</p>
<p>It was frozen dinners.</p>
<p>I mean, that really came to prominence</p>
<p>in the 70s and 80s, but even in the 50s.</p>
<p>And from what I&rsquo;ve been reading, even in the 30s and 40s,</p>
<p>people were not eating grass-fed meat and Brazil nuts</p>
<p>with a little bit of broccoli rabe on the side.</p>
<p>That is not the typical intake.</p>
<p>So something out there, or maybe multiple things</p>
<p>are at play to increase obesity.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, I believe,</p>
<p>some will call this speculative,</p>
<p>but I actually think we&rsquo;ve got a tremendous amount</p>
<p>of evidence that continues to point in this direction.</p>
<p>I believe that mitochondria are the key</p>
<p>to the obesity epidemic,</p>
<p>that there is something in our environment.</p>
<p>So that is either our food, environmental toxins,</p>
<p>stress levels, poor sleep, not getting adequate sunlight,</p>
<p>whatever you wanna speculate on, all of the above.</p>
<p>All of those things are known</p>
<p>to impair mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>And if parts of your brain that regulate metabolism</p>
<p>and that regulate eating behaviors</p>
<p>are not metabolically healthy,</p>
<p>it means that they will not stop you from eating,</p>
<p>or it means that your metabolism will not rise</p>
<p>to the challenge of 10 doughnuts.</p>
<p>Because some people can eat 10 doughnuts</p>
<p>and go on staying thin and healthy.</p>
<p>I totally agree, although I would just like to say</p>
<p>that it seems to me that compared to when I was growing up,</p>
<p>and again, I haven&rsquo;t run the statistics,</p>
<p>there are fewer and fewer of those individuals around now.</p>
<p>Just as when I was growing up,</p>
<p>it was one or two kids in class that were quite overweight.</p>
<p>And then there were some that were mildly overweight,</p>
<p>but most were of healthy weight.</p>
<p>Nowadays, that&rsquo;s dramatically altered.</p>
<p>The landscape is dramatically altered</p>
<p>in the other direction.</p>
<p>It is rare when I encountered</p>
<p>one of those can-eat-anything type people.</p>
<p>I know one, he&rsquo;s actually an employee at Stanford.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on our media team at Stanford.</p>
<p>And this guy, when I take him to lunch,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s in his early 70s and he can eat</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s incredibly lean.</p>
<p>He exercises a little bit,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s one of these mutants</p>
<p>that just can eat and eat and eat.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s lean and he&rsquo;s vital and it&rsquo;s wild.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s an expensive lunch.</p>
<p>But those people seem rare.</p>
<p>And even those kids are now seem rare.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting increasingly rare.</p>
<p>And that leads me to think it may be epigenetic factors</p>
<p>in the womb environment,</p>
<p>so that kids are actually coming out</p>
<p>predisposed to obesity.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about that</p>
<p>because I had a note here to ask this later,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to interrupt you now</p>
<p>in order to capture this moment.</p>
<p>My understanding is that, well, as everyone knows,</p>
<p>we inherit DNA.</p>
<p>We get genes from both of our parents and they mix.</p>
<p>Although there are incredible data</p>
<p>from Catherine Duloc&rsquo;s lab at Harvard</p>
<p>and others showing that we actually have entire regions</p>
<p>of our brain that carry neurons</p>
<p>that are purely of mom&rsquo;s or of dad&rsquo;s DNA,</p>
<p>depending on the brain region.</p>
<p>This is a wild finding, but it&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>And this has actually been known about</p>
<p>in terms of heritability of disease, et cetera.</p>
<p>Maternal DNA, DNA from mom,</p>
<p>genes from our mother,</p>
<p>not to place blame on mothers at all.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the mitochondrial DNA</p>
<p>come exclusively through the maternal side.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great question and I&rsquo;ve been asked this before</p>
<p>and yeah, psychiatrists are known for blaming mothers</p>
<p>and some might say that I&rsquo;m like trying to redo</p>
<p>that whole thing and blame mothers again.</p>
<p>The data are the data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to blame mothers here.</p>
<p>Mothers play an essential role in everything.</p>
<p>But if it is true that mitochondria</p>
<p>are the linchpin of all this</p>
<p>and maternal DNA is what determines the mitochondrial DNA,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an important place to look.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important question.</p>
<p>And the answer is unequivocally no,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the way it works.</p>
<p>Well then, vindication for anyone that was asserting that.</p>
<p>And so let me explain it.</p>
<p>So mitochondria have 36 genes unto themselves.</p>
<p>13 of those genes code for some of the mitochondrial</p>
<p>machinery of making ATP</p>
<p>and the other 36 play roles in epigenetic regulation,</p>
<p>play roles in whole body metabolism and other things.</p>
<p>But so that is what you&rsquo;re inheriting from your mom</p>
<p>is the mitochondria and those 36 genes for the most part.</p>
<p>But the majority of proteins that make up mitochondria</p>
<p>over I think 1,300 genes that make up mitochondria</p>
<p>are actually encoded in the nuclear DNA.</p>
<p>And so you inherit a copy</p>
<p>from both your mother and your father.</p>
<p>So the majority of people who have mitochondrial defects</p>
<p>or rare mitochondrial diseases</p>
<p>actually could inherit them from either mom or dad</p>
<p>because it can be a defect in the nuclear genes</p>
<p>that code for proteins that make up mitochondria.</p>
<p>The much bigger issue,</p>
<p>so when I talk about mitochondrial dysfunction</p>
<p>being a primary driver of mental illness, metabolic illness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that people inherit a defective mitochondrion</p>
<p>or mitochondria from mom</p>
<p>and then that just ruins their life forever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not the way it works.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing about this theory</p>
<p>is that it connects all of the risk factors</p>
<p>that we already know play a role in mental health</p>
<p>but also metabolic health.</p>
<p>Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria</p>
<p>and mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>Stress, high levels of stress and trauma</p>
<p>impair mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>Drug and alcohol use,</p>
<p>alcohol, tobacco definitely in terms of the smoke</p>
<p>and marijuana, THC in particular,</p>
<p>all impair mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>THC directly or the smoke?</p>
<p>THC directly.</p>
<p>Those studies have been done.</p>
<p>And so mitochondria actually have CB1 receptors</p>
<p>right on them.</p>
<p>And various researchers,</p>
<p>a couple of studies from Nature actually documented this,</p>
<p>that the mitochondrial CB1 receptors</p>
<p>are primary kind of primary points</p>
<p>of the influence of marijuana</p>
<p>on human behaviors and effects.</p>
<p>So because when they remove CB1 receptors in animal models,</p>
<p>these changes don&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So the CB1 receptors,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got some large studies of adolescents</p>
<p>who use a lot of marijuana.</p>
<p>And the areas where the mitochondria</p>
<p>have the greatest number of CB1 receptors</p>
<p>are areas of their brains that actually are atrophied</p>
<p>or shrunk compared to normal healthy controls.</p>
<p>So that means their brain tissue is aging prematurely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shrinking prematurely.</p>
<p>But the CB1 receptors on mitochondria</p>
<p>also seem to play a role in the memory impairment</p>
<p>that can be induced from THC.</p>
<p>And they also play a role in the kind of lack of motivation,</p>
<p>the behavioral amotivational state from THC.</p>
<p>Now again, for people who want to chillax,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna remember anything.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna think.</p>
<p>They wanna be spaced out.</p>
<p>They wanna relax.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important that they know</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actually harming the mitochondria</p>
<p>in their brain cells.</p>
<p>And that although there&rsquo;s always an opportunity</p>
<p>to repair mitochondria and always an opportunity</p>
<p>to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis,</p>
<p>so you can get it back.</p>
<p>But if you keep doing it chronically,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not helping your overall</p>
<p>mental or metabolic health.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m glad you brought up THC.</p>
<p>We did an episode on cannabis.</p>
<p>We also did one on alcohol.</p>
<p>Probably lost some friends from that one.</p>
<p>I mean, when you look at the data, it&rsquo;s very clear.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not arguing that people dislike the effects</p>
<p>of these compounds when they take them.</p>
<p>But it is clear that, at least to me, based on the data,</p>
<p>that regardless of what people have read about red wine,</p>
<p>that not drinking any alcohol is going to be healthier</p>
<p>than drinking alcohol</p>
<p>and that the thresholds for alcohol ingestion</p>
<p>before people start to negatively impact their health</p>
<p>is about one or two per week.</p>
<p>And then THC, because of the very high concentrations of THC</p>
<p>that are present in a lot of products now,</p>
<p>vaping and smoking THC and even edibles,</p>
<p>that it can be problematic.</p>
<p>You mentioned adolescence,</p>
<p>predisposition to brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.</p>
<p>In any case, because you mentioned alcohol</p>
<p>and because it is a commonly used substance,</p>
<p>I heard you give a talk in which,</p>
<p>I think I have this right,</p>
<p>in which alcohol can disrupt the way</p>
<p>that the brain uses fuels of all kinds,</p>
<p>which may disrupt one&rsquo;s response to alcohol,</p>
<p>make alcohol seem more rewarding</p>
<p>to those that drink alcohol.</p>
<p>So drinking alcohol makes alcohol more rewarding</p>
<p>to the brain&rsquo;s alcohol drinkers,</p>
<p>but that it also might alter glucose metabolism,</p>
<p>that basically alcohol is not good for our brains.</p>
<p>Do I have that correct?</p>
<p>You do have that correct.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What happens if you take an alcoholic</p>
<p>or somebody that just drinks two to four nights a week,</p>
<p>a couple of drinks,</p>
<p>which I think is pretty common out there,</p>
<p>and you put them on a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Has that experiment been done?</p>
<p>That experiment has been done.</p>
<p>And led by none other than a woman named Nora Volkow,</p>
<p>who is one of the leading neuroscientists</p>
<p>and addiction researchers in the world.</p>
<p>She is the director</p>
<p>of the National Institute of Drug Abuse.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been hot on the trail of metabolic abnormalities</p>
<p>in the brains of people with alcohol use disorder,</p>
<p>which I will just refer to as alcoholics</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what everybody knows it as.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s been hot on this trail for many, many years.</p>
<p>And as you said,</p>
<p>it turns out that the reward pathways in particular</p>
<p>are metabolically compromised in alcoholics.</p>
<p>And the metabolic compromise essentially in a nutshell</p>
<p>means they aren&rsquo;t getting enough fuel from glucose.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that when people drink alcohol,</p>
<p>your liver converts alcohol into a molecule called acetate.</p>
<p>That acetate travels up to the brain</p>
<p>and fuels brain cells,</p>
<p>in particular some of these reward pathway cells</p>
<p>more than others.</p>
<p>And so chronic alcoholics have this chronic deprivation</p>
<p>of energy in these cells.</p>
<p>And so Nora Volkow and other researchers</p>
<p>at National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>did a study in which they set out to see</p>
<p>if we can change this brain metabolic problem in alcoholics,</p>
<p>will that affect clinical symptoms of alcoholism</p>
<p>and will it do anything that&rsquo;s clinically useful?</p>
<p>And so they actually did a pilot randomized controlled trial,</p>
<p>admitted alcoholics to a detox unit.</p>
<p>Half of the patients got a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>The other half got the standard American diet.</p>
<p>And everybody else, all of them got the same detox protocol.</p>
<p>The patients who got the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>required fewer benzodiazepines for their detox.</p>
<p>Despite that, they had fewer withdrawal symptoms</p>
<p>from the alcohol.</p>
<p>They reported fewer cravings for alcohol.</p>
<p>And the researchers did brain scans</p>
<p>which showed improved brain metabolism</p>
<p>in these key areas that they were looking at.</p>
<p>And their brains showed reduced levels of neuroinflammation</p>
<p>which was also something they were really interested in.</p>
<p>And so that one study says to us</p>
<p>that even though most people would think</p>
<p>alcoholism has nothing to do with diet,</p>
<p>alcohol is just drinking too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of willpower</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s addictive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got an addictive personality and it&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>You come out of the womb with an addictive personality</p>
<p>and those people are novelty seekers and they&rsquo;re impulsive</p>
<p>and they have no patience.</p>
<p>They have no discipline.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t sustain any kind of rewarding experience.</p>
<p>Or childhood trauma.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a story there, which there very well may be.</p>
<p>And there may be.</p>
<p>And but what that research study strongly suggests,</p>
<p>and again, yes, maybe we need larger controlled trials</p>
<p>but this is one of the leading neuroscientists in the world</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s hot on this trail.</p>
<p>This is what she believes and this is what I believe,</p>
<p>is that if we can correct the brain metabolic defects</p>
<p>from chronic alcohol use,</p>
<p>we might be able to help people be sober</p>
<p>and give them a fighting chance or give them an edge up</p>
<p>or pull a lever that we can use in their favor</p>
<p>for their benefit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one caution to all of this research</p>
<p>that I really do want to highlight.</p>
<p>And so now I&rsquo;m going to get hate mail</p>
<p>from all the keto community.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I mean, anytime I admire you</p>
<p>for talking about nutrition at all</p>
<p>because anytime one talks about nutrition,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get hate mail from somebody, but.</p>
<p>So the caveat to all of this is that as part of the research</p>
<p>that those researchers were doing,</p>
<p>they actually wanted to see what will happen</p>
<p>to alcohol levels if an animal consumes alcohol</p>
<p>while on a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t do this in humans yet.</p>
<p>This is a fairly easy study to do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hoping somebody will do this study soon.</p>
<p>But they instead put rats, half of them on a standard diet</p>
<p>and half of them on a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>And then they exposed them</p>
<p>to the exact same amount of alcohol.</p>
<p>The rats who were on the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>had a five-fold increase in blood alcohol levels.</p>
<p>Five-fold increase.</p>
<p>Meaning they drank more or it was metabolized differently.</p>
<p>It was metabolized differently.</p>
<p>The rats all got the same amount of alcohol.</p>
<p>So for people out there who are ketogenic,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m chuckling, but who are not alcoholics,</p>
<p>please, alcoholics, please do something about it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so detrimental.</p>
<p>I guess, does this mean that they can drink less</p>
<p>in order to get the effect of alcohol</p>
<p>that most people are seeking?</p>
<p>Cheap dates.</p>
<p>Cheap date is what you call that.</p>
<p>You only need a half a drink instead of three drinks.</p>
<p>I would think the keto community would thank you for this</p>
<p>unless they somehow have a stake in the alcohol industry.</p>
<p>The reason that I put it as a caution</p>
<p>is that if anybody is struggling with alcoholism</p>
<p>and thinks, hey, I need an edge up,</p>
<p>I need a lever to pull</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m really struggling to give this stuff up,</p>
<p>I just find myself going back.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re telling me my brain metabolism is messed up</p>
<p>and this might help it, I&rsquo;m all in favor of that.</p>
<p>And yes, that&rsquo;s what the researchers are pursuing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying with the following caveat</p>
<p>that if you relapse while on a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>you better not drink the same amount of alcohol</p>
<p>that you think you can drink.</p>
<p>Could be deadly.</p>
<p>It could be deadly and or it could be really deadly</p>
<p>to you or someone else because unfortunately,</p>
<p>a lot of times when people drink,</p>
<p>they get behind the wheel</p>
<p>and they think that they can handle two drinks safely</p>
<p>and they think, well, I can go out for dinner</p>
<p>and have two glasses of wine and drive home safely.</p>
<p>I know myself.</p>
<p>If you go to a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t drive with the same two drinks</p>
<p>because it means your blood alcohol level,</p>
<p>if it models anything that we found in the rat study,</p>
<p>your blood alcohol levels may be five times higher</p>
<p>than they would normally be.</p>
<p>And that means you are really wasted</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re probably not safe to be driving.</p>
<p>Probably the same is true</p>
<p>for drinking on an empty stomach, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s a very important point</p>
<p>and thank you for raising that.</p>
<p>I mean, I hear this again about mitochondria,</p>
<p>about blood glucose.</p>
<p>You mentioned astrocytes</p>
<p>and for those of you who heard that earlier,</p>
<p>astrocytes are a non-neuron cell type in the brain,</p>
<p>a glial cell type that my postdoc advisor</p>
<p>was known for sort of popularizing</p>
<p>the modern science of glia, which include astrocytes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say that they do,</p>
<p>they are considered the cells</p>
<p>that hold everything together in the brain</p>
<p>and are kind of passive observers,</p>
<p>but they do many things actively there.</p>
<p>I think now people appreciate the astrocytes</p>
<p>at least as important as the neurons.</p>
<p>And certainly for disease,</p>
<p>they are often implicated in warding off of disease, et cetera.</p>
<p>Everything that you&rsquo;re telling me about,</p>
<p>the fact that the brain can regulate things</p>
<p>that are happening in the body, metabolism, et cetera,</p>
<p>organ health, obesity, et cetera.</p>
<p>To me as a neuroscientist, that&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>All of it just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,</p>
<p>hypothalamus, because here you&rsquo;re telling me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s regulating these basal functions like metabolism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s regulating how much we crave things.</p>
<p>And of course, hypothalamus is involved</p>
<p>in motivation and craving.</p>
<p>There are other areas too,</p>
<p>other areas of the brain too, of course.</p>
<p>But I would imagine that someone ought to,</p>
<p>or has mapped out where the receptors</p>
<p>for all this business are in the brain.</p>
<p>And I guess that raises the question</p>
<p>of when one goes on a ketogenic</p>
<p>or low blood glucose diet or fast,</p>
<p>has anyone observed changes in the brain?</p>
<p>Has anyone had neuroimaging of humans and their brains</p>
<p>under conditions of ingesting one diet or another,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re suffering</p>
<p>from a psychiatric disorder or not?</p>
<p>I would think that&rsquo;s where the gold is.</p>
<p>We do have some of those studies.</p>
<p>When you do a neuroimaging study,</p>
<p>you can measure a lot of different things.</p>
<p>So one thing with a PET scan,</p>
<p>you can measure glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>So a researcher, Stephen Cunane,</p>
<p>is doing that research in particular</p>
<p>in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease patients</p>
<p>and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease models, but in humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we know that,</p>
<p>again, a common finding in patients</p>
<p>with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is this glucose hypometabolism.</p>
<p>Some people are attributing it</p>
<p>to insulin signaling impairment.</p>
<p>And so some people are calling it type three diabetes.</p>
<p>The end of the day, I think the clearest signal that we have</p>
<p>is that cells aren&rsquo;t getting enough energy</p>
<p>from glucose as a fuel source.</p>
<p>That is something that I think I can confidently say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s backed by numerous research studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s debate in the research field</p>
<p>about whether that&rsquo;s a primary driver of the illness.</p>
<p>I happen to believe it is.</p>
<p>And if you ask the question,</p>
<p>why would cells not be getting enough fuel from glucose?</p>
<p>You have to focus on mitochondria</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the ones producing the fuel</p>
<p>from that glucose.</p>
<p>So somehow you have to implicate mitochondria</p>
<p>in that process one way or another.</p>
<p>Others will say, no, that&rsquo;s just a side effect</p>
<p>of whatever&rsquo;s causing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>But so Stephen Cunane has done studies</p>
<p>where he even gives ketone supplements.</p>
<p>These are liquid ketone esters.</p>
<p>So yeah, ketone esters or ketone salts.</p>
<p>And it has actually found that these brain metabolism</p>
<p>deficits can be corrected at least short term</p>
<p>by giving a ketone supplement.</p>
<p>Is this in the context of people</p>
<p>also ingesting some carbohydrate?</p>
<p>Because I confess, I&rsquo;ve tried the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>I probably did it wrong.</p>
<p>This was years ago.</p>
<p>And then the cyclic ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>But in the last year or so,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started using liquid ketone esters.</p>
<p>And I do eat some carbohydrates each day,</p>
<p>usually in proportion to how much high intensity exercise</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Those liquid ketone esters for me, at least subjectively,</p>
<p>I feel like greatly increased my energy levels</p>
<p>and my ability to focus mentally.</p>
<p>And they improve my sleep.</p>
<p>This is my observation, tracking some data,</p>
<p>but just again, subjectively.</p>
<p>So in this example, are you talking about people</p>
<p>taking ketone esters or ketone salts</p>
<p>on a backdrop of a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>or on the backdrop of a more typical diet?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s done both.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s done studies where patients</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t doing anything special with the diet.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re eating whatever they normally eat,</p>
<p>absolutely non-ketogenic,</p>
<p>giving them a ketone salt or ester,</p>
<p>and then noticing immediate and direct changes</p>
<p>in the metabolism of these</p>
<p>metabolically compromised brain cells</p>
<p>as measured by pet imaging.</p>
<p>These are not household pets, by the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, we have to just,</p>
<p>Petri, positron emission tomography, not pets.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m sure that there are people out there</p>
<p>who have their dogs or cats or whatever,</p>
<p>or their pet kangaroos, whatever you might own</p>
<p>on ketogenic diets.</p>
<p>Okay, not today.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s actually moved further.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done a pilot trial in a nursing home, actually,</p>
<p>where he did not put the patients on a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>He simply reduced carbohydrate consumption</p>
<p>at breakfast and lunch.</p>
<p>They still got the same dinner as everyone else.</p>
<p>And simply reducing carbohydrate consumption</p>
<p>at breakfast and lunch resulted in cognitive improvement</p>
<p>in a statistically significant way</p>
<p>in some of those subjects.</p>
<p>Oh, I love that result.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I just have to highlight this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge believer in directing carbohydrates</p>
<p>to specific portions of the day</p>
<p>when one needs to be less focused and alert</p>
<p>and yet can replenish glycogen.</p>
<p>Limiting carbohydrates most of the time during the day</p>
<p>for me has been a game changer</p>
<p>in terms of maintaining alertness, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware that I have age-related cognitive decline,</p>
<p>but then again, people around me may argue otherwise.</p>
<p>Let me say, you are Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>There is no way you have cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>Although you didn&rsquo;t know me as a six-year-old.</p>
<p>If you have cognitive impairment, we&rsquo;re all screwed.</p>
<p>Well, I have plenty of flaws and impairments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m well over 3,000 documented by people very close to me.</p>
<p>But this is very interesting, I think,</p>
<p>in the context of everything we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>because could it be that supplementing with liquid ketones</p>
<p>or prescribing liquid ketones</p>
<p>to people who are challenged with mood disorders</p>
<p>or things of that sort could be beneficial</p>
<p>even if they are not willing or able</p>
<p>to adhere to a ketogenic diet?</p>
<p>That is the million-dollar question right now,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have good trial data to say yes or no.</p>
<p>My speculation, my hunch,</p>
<p>having tried that clinically with patients</p>
<p>is it doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same thing.</p>
<p>The bigger reason for my feeling confident in saying that</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve had ketone salts and esters</p>
<p>available for over a decade now.</p>
<p>We have tens of thousands of children and adolescents</p>
<p>who are following a strict,</p>
<p>ridiculously strict ketogenic diet to control their epilepsy.</p>
<p>Those kids would love to be off the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Their parents would love to have them off the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Yeah, no birthday cake, no ice cream.</p>
<p>There is not one case report</p>
<p>of any child controlling his or her seizures</p>
<p>using exogenous ketones</p>
<p>without also doing the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>I just find it hard to believe</p>
<p>that at least some of those people</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t tried it out to see.</p>
<p>I do know some patients with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and even schizophrenia</p>
<p>who are doing extraordinarily well on a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>They have tried to switch off the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>using exogenous ketones.</p>
<p>Their symptoms came back,</p>
<p>and so they found that it just wasn&rsquo;t effective.</p>
<p>Again, those are anecdotes.</p>
<p>My scientific speculation about why</p>
<p>is because the ketogenic diet is actually</p>
<p>not necessarily about ketones themselves.</p>
<p>Ketones are one of a multifaceted story there.</p>
<p>And so when people do a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also improving, they&rsquo;re lowering glucose levels,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re improving insulin signaling,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ramping up mitochondrial biogenesis,</p>
<p>in particular in the liver,</p>
<p>because mitochondria actually make ketones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re made,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re primarily made in the liver mitochondria.</p>
<p>So when somebody&rsquo;s in a fasting state</p>
<p>or on a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>their liver mitochondria go through the roof</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re being called to action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, body&rsquo;s in starvation mode, get to work.</p>
<p>And so the mitochondria, the cell senses,</p>
<p>we need more mitochondria to process fat,</p>
<p>to turn it into ketones,</p>
<p>so that those ketones can get up to the brain</p>
<p>and keep the brain fueled,</p>
<p>because fatty acids can&rsquo;t fuel the brain.</p>
<p>Only ketones can.</p>
<p>Now, so my sense is that,</p>
<p>and the gut microbiome changes and everything,</p>
<p>the changes in hormones.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re eating a lot of donuts</p>
<p>and drinking a bottle of ketones,</p>
<p>the donuts are going to prevent your body</p>
<p>from lowering glucose levels.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still gonna have the high glucose levels</p>
<p>from the donuts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still gonna probably have</p>
<p>the impaired insulin signaling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably still going to possibly have</p>
<p>some inflammation from the inflammatory effects</p>
<p>of that food.</p>
<p>And so just drinking ketones alone won&rsquo;t be enough.</p>
<p>I think for people who are metabolically healthy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll include you in that,</p>
<p>I think ketones can play a really beneficial role,</p>
<p>no doubt.</p>
<p>I think exogenous ketones may in fact</p>
<p>prove invaluable in clinical use</p>
<p>for patients who maybe can&rsquo;t follow</p>
<p>a super strict ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>but maybe could do a low carb diet.</p>
<p>And then given the research that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with alcohol use disorder,</p>
<p>I could imagine a situation,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the million dollar tip</p>
<p>to whoever wants to go out and get this</p>
<p>if it actually turns out to be true.</p>
<p>I could imagine a scenario where we use</p>
<p>exogenous ketones with alcoholics</p>
<p>and that every time they have a severe craving for alcohol,</p>
<p>they drink ketones instead.</p>
<p>Which sort of tastes like alcohol.</p>
<p>The ketone esters, when I take them,</p>
<p>I drink them straight.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll put them in seltzer</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not a big drinker.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I might have an alcoholic drink</p>
<p>every once in a while.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t ever crave it.</p>
<p>I just do it every maybe,</p>
<p>I think 2020 was the last time I had a drink of alcohol.</p>
<p>And so obviously I&rsquo;m not a good representative example.</p>
<p>But the ketones taste good to me</p>
<p>and they obviously don&rsquo;t get you drunk.</p>
<p>They do seem to flick on my alertness pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And my understanding is that they are</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s preferred fuel source,</p>
<p>meaning they are going to be the first fuels</p>
<p>used by the brain when there&rsquo;s a buffet of fuels available.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s glucose in my bloodstream,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s circulating liquid ketones,</p>
<p>that ketones would be used first or preferentially.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a complex question.</p>
<p>I mean, some research that we have</p>
<p>suggests that there are brain areas or brain cells</p>
<p>that require glucose and cannot use ketones.</p>
<p>So 100% of the brain cannot be fueled with ketones</p>
<p>as far as we can tell.</p>
<p>So there are some areas that require glucose</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably the reason we have gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>is to keep the body going</p>
<p>and keep the brain going no matter what.</p>
<p>But when ketones are available,</p>
<p>especially if ketones are high,</p>
<p>the way I think about it is not that ketones</p>
<p>are like the preferred fuel source</p>
<p>and glucose goes to the wayside.</p>
<p>But the way I think about it is that</p>
<p>you have a range of cells</p>
<p>with varying degrees of metabolic health.</p>
<p>And some of those cells are gonna be extraordinarily healthy</p>
<p>with appropriate, healthy, abundant mitochondria.</p>
<p>And those cells are probably going to continue</p>
<p>to use glucose as a fuel source.</p>
<p>But if ketones happen to be there,</p>
<p>sure, they&rsquo;ll use that too.</p>
<p>Like, why not?</p>
<p>But the real money is metabolically compromised tissues,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s brain cells or other tissues.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking about the brain.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve got metabolically compromised brain cells,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not across the board,</p>
<p>like with Alzheimer&rsquo;s brain scans,</p>
<p>there are specific regions</p>
<p>that are more metabolically compromised than others.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we see patterns of atrophy</p>
<p>in specific brain regions,</p>
<p>is because those regions are dysfunctional</p>
<p>metabolically for whatever reason.</p>
<p>And we can get into why that might be.</p>
<p>But my sense is that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got a metabolically compromised cell,</p>
<p>that cell is sending out a distress signal.</p>
<p>That cell is calling resources from the body,</p>
<p>like, feed me, give me something.</p>
<p>And if it can&rsquo;t use glucose effectively,</p>
<p>it is gonna suck up those ketones</p>
<p>and then start running on all cylinders or closer to it.</p>
<p>And that process is so critical</p>
<p>because what it means is that</p>
<p>if that cell was barely getting by on 60%,</p>
<p>of its real ATP requirement,</p>
<p>it means that it doesn&rsquo;t have enough energy</p>
<p>for maintenance and repair functions.</p>
<p>As soon as you give that cell 100% energy or close to it,</p>
<p>even if you get it up to 90% of its preferred energy amount,</p>
<p>it can start to repair itself.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the beauty of the human body</p>
<p>and living organisms,</p>
<p>is that they have a priority list of what they&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>And if that cell senses that there are defective molecules,</p>
<p>defective proteins in this cell that need to be replaced,</p>
<p>once it gets enough fuel,</p>
<p>it will start repairing itself and doing that work.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>Thank you for that clarification.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and age-related cognitive decline generally.</p>
<p>I know many people out there are just terrified</p>
<p>of losing their memory for the obvious reasons,</p>
<p>memory sets context, et cetera.</p>
<p>And many people have relatives that suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or other forms of dementia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that the ketogenic diet and diets like it</p>
<p>can be very effective for helping to offset</p>
<p>some of the symptoms of Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>In fact, I even have a friend,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t out him by institution,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the chair of cardiology,</p>
<p>who contacted me of all people,</p>
<p>asking whether or not I was aware of any studies</p>
<p>or whether or not I knew of anybody</p>
<p>who had benefited from ketogenic diet for Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And I thought,</p>
<p>well, why don&rsquo;t you ask one of your colleagues in neurology?</p>
<p>But his response was really interesting.</p>
<p>He said, there are many books out there</p>
<p>for the general public.</p>
<p>There are a lot of online discussions about this.</p>
<p>There are a lot of assertions about this</p>
<p>in some animal studies.</p>
<p>But again, these are his words.</p>
<p>There are very few, if any, controlled clinical trials</p>
<p>exploring the role of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>for the treatment or reversal of Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that statement was incorrect</p>
<p>or soon will be incorrect</p>
<p>because those trials are ongoing.</p>
<p>But he said, yeah, the people who are most popular</p>
<p>for telling us about the important role</p>
<p>and positive role of being in ketosis for Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>for some reason, they just won&rsquo;t do a clinical trial.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been frustrating to the community.</p>
<p>So this is a very educated, very accomplished person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a physician of heart medicine</p>
<p>as opposed to something else related to the brain.</p>
<p>But what is the story there?</p>
<p>And for goodness sake,</p>
<p>why aren&rsquo;t there clinical trials</p>
<p>on ketogenic diet and Alzheimer&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect you to be responsible for that fact,</p>
<p>but goodness, I would think this would be</p>
<p>the obvious thing for NIH.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the study section,</p>
<p>but not for these sorts of experiments.</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t money just avalanching into this area</p>
<p>based on all the anecdotal evidence</p>
<p>that people are talking about?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a couple of small pilot clinical trials.</p>
<p>The best one was a randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>I think it only included 26 subjects, something like that.</p>
<p>Randomized to 12 weeks of a low fat diet,</p>
<p>10 week washout, 12 weeks of ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Some of the participants got keto first and then low fat.</p>
<p>Other participants got low fat then keto.</p>
<p>And that trial actually found that</p>
<p>when patients were in ketosis,</p>
<p>they had statistically significant improvement</p>
<p>in activities of daily living and quality of life.</p>
<p>And they did have improvement in cognitive function,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>That improvement did not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got other trials.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got several animal models</p>
<p>showing that the ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers</p>
<p>of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in Alzheimer&rsquo;s models.</p>
<p>So it can reduce plaques and tangles,</p>
<p>can even improve cognitive impairment in animal models.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a couple of other small pilot trials</p>
<p>of ketogenic diet in humans</p>
<p>showing that it improves biomarkers</p>
<p>compared to say the low fat diet</p>
<p>or the American Heart Association diet.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got those.</p>
<p>I think one of the biggest challenges</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll just share openly,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m somebody who&rsquo;s pretty passionate about this research</p>
<p>and I believe it has a lot of potential,</p>
<p>but Johns Hopkins researchers attempted</p>
<p>to do exactly this kind of a study.</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients, ketogenic diet versus the,</p>
<p>I think American Academy of Aging</p>
<p>or something like that diet as the control diet.</p>
<p>Which presumably has starches in there.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the key variable.</p>
<p>Probably lots of, yeah.</p>
<p>Lots of whole grains.</p>
<p>Lots of whole grains.</p>
<p>Yeah, some potatoes.</p>
<p>And they spent, I believe over three years,</p>
<p>they screened over 1,300 participants.</p>
<p>People who expressed interest.</p>
<p>The end of the day,</p>
<p>I think they only got 27 people to enroll</p>
<p>and only 14 of those people completed the study.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Despite that, what they found was that</p>
<p>the subjects who achieved ketosis had cognitive improvement.</p>
<p>But people on study section</p>
<p>are gonna look at a study like that</p>
<p>and say, even if the science is there,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t get people to do this diet,</p>
<p>why would we spend money on researchers</p>
<p>trying to get people to do this diet?</p>
<p>I should mention study section</p>
<p>is this closed door panels of 40 or so people.</p>
<p>There are many of these panels.</p>
<p>Different divisions of the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>use different panels and then grants are evaluated</p>
<p>in a very small,</p>
<p>because of the size of the federal budget for research,</p>
<p>a very small percentage,</p>
<p>usually about 10% of these studies are funded.</p>
<p>The rest don&rsquo;t, generally don&rsquo;t end up happening.</p>
<p>That is very informative.</p>
<p>What you just described is very informative</p>
<p>because now it makes sense to me</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no conspiracy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like big pharma, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>is trying to suppress trials</p>
<p>of ketogenic diets on Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because I would imagine the first thing</p>
<p>that pharma would want to do is to see that study done</p>
<p>so they didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>And then the moment it was done,</p>
<p>if it showed a positive effect,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d probably wanna isolate the molecule</p>
<p>and wrap it up in something that people would take.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any active suppression by pharma.</p>
<p>I think pharma would probably be cheering from the sidelines</p>
<p>because they could capitalize on it</p>
<p>because ultimately the studies are done by scientists,</p>
<p>but the treatments are generally doled out</p>
<p>by pharmaceutical companies and or physicians.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a conspiracy there.</p>
<p>That is very interesting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of amazing given our discussion of earlier,</p>
<p>which is that you had a patient</p>
<p>that was having schizophrenic symptoms</p>
<p>who managed to stay on this diet.</p>
<p>So is there something special about Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients</p>
<p>and people with age-related cognitive decline?</p>
<p>Presumably they&rsquo;re very dependent on others</p>
<p>to cook for them and shop for them.</p>
<p>I think that this is a almost perfect controlled environment</p>
<p>for getting this study done.</p>
<p>I think that is the key issue.</p>
<p>So again, I get patients with bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people</p>
<p>to do this diet and stay with it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m providing</p>
<p>like a weekly session for them.</p>
<p>And I imagine this study did not provide</p>
<p>that kind of intensive support.</p>
<p>So I think in the pilot trial that I described to you,</p>
<p>they actually got, I think, over 90% compliance</p>
<p>with the different dietary interventions.</p>
<p>So some of it is gonna be dependent on the research group</p>
<p>and does the research group understand</p>
<p>that this is not, it&rsquo;s not like prescribing a pill.</p>
<p>Here, take this pill and take it every day</p>
<p>and come back in three weeks.</p>
<p>And even then we don&rsquo;t know for sure</p>
<p>that the patient took the pill every day.</p>
<p>We just assume they took the pill every day</p>
<p>and studies say they probably didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But so I think when we think about a dietary intervention,</p>
<p>we need to think about more intensive support and education.</p>
<p>And that support could be a health and wellness coach.</p>
<p>It could be a dietician.</p>
<p>It could be education of the family.</p>
<p>It might even be providing them with dietary like meals</p>
<p>that maybe for six months,</p>
<p>we actually provide them with ketogenic meals once a week,</p>
<p>put them in your freezer, microwave them when needed</p>
<p>to make this diet as easy and doable as possible.</p>
<p>Because if we can get people to do the diet,</p>
<p>if we can get them through the first couple of months,</p>
<p>most people can learn how to do this diet</p>
<p>more importantly, I didn&rsquo;t mention this before,</p>
<p>but the number one reason I am so successful</p>
<p>at getting patients to stay on this diet for years</p>
<p>is because of the consequences to them</p>
<p>when they go off of it.</p>
<p>That is the reason I can get schizophrenic patients</p>
<p>and bipolar patients to do this diet.</p>
<p>Whereas other people can&rsquo;t get an everyday human being</p>
<p>to do it for weight loss</p>
<p>because the weight loss patient</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t experience devastating, tormenting symptoms</p>
<p>when they break the diet.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they are rewarded.</p>
<p>They eat something they really enjoy</p>
<p>and they get a little bit of a dopamine rush from it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re off to the races.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m gonna, oh, I&rsquo;ve already cheated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll cheat again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get back on it someday.</p>
<p>And they never get around to it.</p>
<p>My patients, when they go off the diet,</p>
<p>they start hallucinating within 24, 48 hours.</p>
<p>And they quickly realize</p>
<p>that was a really stupid thing to do.</p>
<p>That piece of cake was not at all worth</p>
<p>the torment that I&rsquo;m experiencing now.</p>
<p>So they get back on the diet.</p>
<p>I suspect with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>we might notice something similar.</p>
<p>These people, some of these people have very mild symptoms.</p>
<p>So maybe they won&rsquo;t have that kind of a reinforcement</p>
<p>or negative reinforcing kind of experience.</p>
<p>But I think some of them will.</p>
<p>Some of them recognize that they are impaired cognitively.</p>
<p>And if this diet could help them remember better,</p>
<p>if this diet could help them function better.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s what the pilot trial showed</p>
<p>is activities of daily living.</p>
<p>That means these people are able to go to the bathroom</p>
<p>on their own.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to get themselves dressed,</p>
<p>whereas they needed help with those things before.</p>
<p>Those are actually really important things</p>
<p>to both the patient and the caregiver.</p>
<p>And if they go off the diet</p>
<p>and then quickly revert into a more symptomatic state,</p>
<p>that might be reinforcing enough</p>
<p>for them to figure out a way to do the diet on their own.</p>
<p>And if we think about,</p>
<p>if this really is an effective intervention,</p>
<p>then yes, we need longer trials, larger trials, all of that.</p>
<p>Because there are plenty of stories in the medical field</p>
<p>where pilot trials looked really spectacular and promising,</p>
<p>and then larger trials just failed to show the benefits.</p>
<p>I believe based on all the science of metabolism,</p>
<p>mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, all of that,</p>
<p>I believe the science makes this an obvious treatment</p>
<p>that has real potential.</p>
<p>So, you know, people will call me biased.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ve got my bias.</p>
<p>No, based on clinical observation</p>
<p>and extensive clinical observation at that.</p>
<p>I think biases that are simply</p>
<p>because we want to feel a certain way</p>
<p>or believe something are worth critiquing,</p>
<p>but bias based on observation.</p>
<p>Here, I should mention that, you know,</p>
<p>most of what we know about human memory</p>
<p>was sparked by one patient, a famous HM,</p>
<p>who I think was living in Harvard Medical,</p>
<p>in one of the hospitals around there,</p>
<p>many hospitals on Longwood Campus, but one patient.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason we associate the hippocampus with memory</p>
<p>is because we knew that HM&rsquo;s hippocampus was damaged,</p>
<p>intentionally damaged for epilepsy treatment, right?</p>
<p>So this idea that everything has to be</p>
<p>a randomized clinical trial to me is crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, of course that&rsquo;s a gold standard and it&rsquo;s essential,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much information in textbooks,</p>
<p>medical textbooks in particular,</p>
<p>that are gleaned from single patient case studies</p>
<p>or from three patient neurostimulation in the brain</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>So to me, I&rsquo;m still perplexed as to, you know,</p>
<p>why there&rsquo;s this insistence on only one form of evidence.</p>
<p>Clearly what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>the important work that you&rsquo;re doing clinically</p>
<p>and in the research side and in public communication</p>
<p>is assisting this.</p>
<p>I have a question about,</p>
<p>or more of a statement slash question</p>
<p>about the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Based on everything that we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>seems to me that the ketogenic diet for weight loss</p>
<p>is a very interesting aspect of the diet,</p>
<p>as is intermittent fasting for weight loss,</p>
<p>even though it might just be by way of caloric restriction.</p>
<p>Caloric restriction that occurs with fasting.</p>
<p>But then in some ways,</p>
<p>the effects of the ketogenic diet on weight loss</p>
<p>are a bit of a decoy for most people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where their mind goes.</p>
<p>This person lost X amount of weight.</p>
<p>Maybe that made them feel better.</p>
<p>Maybe that actually made them underweight.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve talked about it for some people</p>
<p>that can actually bring them underweight.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad that we got the chance to dive</p>
<p>into the description of ketogenic diet for epilepsy,</p>
<p>because it really is a medical intervention</p>
<p>that has a side effect of weight loss,</p>
<p>or could be used to treat obesity and induce weight loss.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really about far more than that.</p>
<p>And that raises a question for me,</p>
<p>which is, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about the ketogenic diet as one thing,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard you discuss this before,</p>
<p>where, you know, just as a physician</p>
<p>will prescribe different dosage ranges of a given drug,</p>
<p>you can prescribe different dosage ranges</p>
<p>of a nutritional plan, a diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not one thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily zero carbohydrates</p>
<p>or 100 grams or 50 grams.</p>
<p>It depends on the patient and a lot of other factors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard you list off various things, classic keto.</p>
<p>Maybe you could just briefly tell us what that typically is,</p>
<p>because I think most people think</p>
<p>it means eating a lot of meat and not carbohydrates,</p>
<p>but it might not be that.</p>
<p>Fasting, and then some of the other,</p>
<p>you mentioned Atkins earlier.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to go into each of these in detail.</p>
<p>And I know in your book,</p>
<p>you talk about not just the science and clinical background,</p>
<p>but also some actionable steps that people could consider</p>
<p>so they can refer there for more detail.</p>
<p>But for somebody who, let&rsquo;s say, is depressed,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had some rounds of depression,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re on antidepressants, maybe not,</p>
<p>and they want to try something like this.</p>
<p>Obviously, this has to be done in concert</p>
<p>with a physician observing all this.</p>
<p>But what is the typical thing that you probe with first?</p>
<p>Just like with a drug,</p>
<p>you might probe with 20 milligrams of a drug.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your typical initial dietary intervention probe?</p>
<p>Terrible languaging, I realize,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m criticizing myself for that,</p>
<p>but I think people get the idea.</p>
<p>The real answer is that I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a one-size-fits-all recommendation for any person.</p>
<p>So the first thing that I&rsquo;m going to assess with the patient</p>
<p>is what symptoms are they having?</p>
<p>What is their current diet like?</p>
<p>And what are they willing to do?</p>
<p>I try to meet them where they&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>So if somebody, and I want to point out,</p>
<p>like you mentioned the all-meat version of this diet,</p>
<p>which is often referred to as the carnivore diet.</p>
<p>A very controversial diet.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that exists,</p>
<p>and some people swear by it.</p>
<p>They swear that they&rsquo;ve tried other versions</p>
<p>of ketogenic diets,</p>
<p>and only when they went to a carnivore diet</p>
<p>did they get benefits.</p>
<p>But there are vegetarian and vegan versions</p>
<p>of the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>So in my mind, this is not at all about the diet wars</p>
<p>of animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about inducing a state of ketosis,</p>
<p>which is mimicking the fasting state.</p>
<p>That is what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>And you can do that by not eating anything,</p>
<p>by fasting and or intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>and you get your results.</p>
<p>So no diet is a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about the foods</p>
<p>or the types of foods that you&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about inducing a state of ketosis.</p>
<p>The first variable I&rsquo;m going to look at</p>
<p>when I recommend this or prescribe this</p>
<p>is the person&rsquo;s current weight.</p>
<p>If somebody&rsquo;s obese versus somebody who&rsquo;s thin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use different dietary strategies</p>
<p>for those two situations.</p>
<p>In the obese patient,</p>
<p>they have tons of fat stores on their body already.</p>
<p>Usually it is a goal of theirs to tap into some of those,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d like to lose some weight</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re going to try a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>for brain health anyway.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to use that.</p>
<p>So that person, really, the diet is carbohydrate restriction</p>
<p>and that usually is a sufficient intervention.</p>
<p>Both simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars,</p>
<p>and fructose also?</p>
<p>Fructose, definitely.</p>
<p>So no added sugars, essentially.</p>
<p>You can have added natural sweeteners</p>
<p>like stevia or monk fruit.</p>
<p>You might use artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably, years after doing this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably recommend steer away from them if you can</p>
<p>because I think they tend to stimulate cravings</p>
<p>for high carb foods.</p>
<p>So if you can kind of get through a couple of weeks</p>
<p>without sweet things,</p>
<p>your cravings for those will go down</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll make the diet easier</p>
<p>and a little more sustainable.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say you can have your artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you really want.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to say less than 20 grams of carbs a day</p>
<p>for those people.</p>
<p>They can have all the protein they want.</p>
<p>They can have vegetables</p>
<p>and they can have all the fat they want,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to push fat on those people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell them eat a lot of fat at the same time</p>
<p>because I want to use the fat on their body</p>
<p>as the fat source, at least early on.</p>
<p>Are you encouraging healthy fats like monounsaturated fats</p>
<p>like olive oil or are you encouraging people</p>
<p>to eat a little less butter, et cetera?</p>
<p>I tend to encourage,</p>
<p>again, a wide range of fats</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to depend on the person.</p>
<p>A lot of times people come to me with very specific ideas,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to tend to encourage olive oil,</p>
<p>avocados, nuts,</p>
<p>which are usually considered</p>
<p>even by the American Heart Association,</p>
<p>healthy sources of fat.</p>
<p>The more controversial thing</p>
<p>are things like coconut oil or coconut cream,</p>
<p>which the American Heart Association might say</p>
<p>is not a healthy fat.</p>
<p>I kind of disagree with that</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unhealthy at all actually.</p>
<p>And when you look at the epidemiological studies</p>
<p>of saturated fat causing heart disease</p>
<p>or causing adverse outcomes at best,</p>
<p>maybe increases your risk 10 to 15% at best.</p>
<p>How much coconut oil can people ingest anyway</p>
<p>before they either develop diarrhea, no joke,</p>
<p>or just sort of get tired of coconut oil?</p>
<p>But anyway, your point is taken.</p>
<p>But they can eat meat if they like meat</p>
<p>or they could eat eggs</p>
<p>or if they don&rsquo;t like meat and eggs,</p>
<p>they could eat sardines or things of that sort.</p>
<p>I mean, I personally can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>yeah, I can&rsquo;t even stomach the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even like the word sardine.</p>
<p>I have nothing against the actual fish,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>But obviously people have,</p>
<p>I say this because people have different preferences, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eat a steak, but I&rsquo;m not gonna eat a sardine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna go with that.</p>
<p>And again, there are vegan sources of protein</p>
<p>that people can eat tempeh and other things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the obese person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s carb restriction is the primary initial phase.</p>
<p>The thin person is gonna need to eat a lot of fat</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have a lot of fat stores on their body.</p>
<p>And if I want them in ketosis, clinical ketosis,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to feed them fat.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the person that I&rsquo;m gonna say,</p>
<p>make sure you get in avocados, olive oil, butter,</p>
<p>maybe a cream, heavy cream.</p>
<p>So heavy cream is delicious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a delicious way to get your fats in.</p>
<p>And I have one patient who just drinks it straight</p>
<p>to just try to get it in.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had an appetite for sweets.</p>
<p>I absolutely love savory fatty food.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, I was thin,</p>
<p>so I was able to do this,</p>
<p>but I used to drink half and half.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and drink it just because it tastes so, so good.</p>
<p>It does taste good.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re on a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna push them away from half and half</p>
<p>and toward heavy whipping cream.</p>
<p>And so you can whip that up.</p>
<p>You can freeze it.</p>
<p>It turns into ice cream.</p>
<p>You can add vanilla.</p>
<p>You can add cocoa powder.</p>
<p>You can add all sorts of things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re off to the races with shakes</p>
<p>and ice cream and mousse</p>
<p>and all sorts of things that you can have.</p>
<p>With any of these patients,</p>
<p>the beauty of this diet is I have objective biomarkers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have them measuring ketones</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to adjust the diet</p>
<p>based on their state of ketosis</p>
<p>and or the clinical benefits that I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an average person</p>
<p>who is not currently under psychiatric care,</p>
<p>not taking prescription medicines,</p>
<p>but is saying, I&rsquo;m burned out, I&rsquo;m exhausted,</p>
<p>I want some of that brain energy</p>
<p>that Andrew Huberman&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>He talks about feeling good.</p>
<p>I want some of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably actually gonna recommend</p>
<p>the protocol you described,</p>
<p>which is let&rsquo;s see if we can just carb restrict for a while</p>
<p>and see if that produces clinical benefit.</p>
<p>I have one, he&rsquo;s not even a patient,</p>
<p>just somebody who read my book.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell him anything.</p>
<p>He came away from it saying</p>
<p>he was ready to start an antidepressant for his anxiety.</p>
<p>He had chronic anxiety.</p>
<p>He was trying meditation, was trying all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Nothing, those things weren&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>He was ready to go on prescription medicine.</p>
<p>He read an early copy of the book.</p>
<p>He took it upon himself without consulting with me</p>
<p>to restrict carbohydrates alone.</p>
<p>He did not go ketogenic.</p>
<p>He is a vegetarian.</p>
<p>He restricted carbs.</p>
<p>Within three weeks said,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need prescription medicine.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how much better I feel.</p>
<p>And all I did was cut out</p>
<p>some of the high carb foods in my diet.</p>
<p>So I think for some people it can be that simple.</p>
<p>For people with serious mental disorders,</p>
<p>if they are chronically depressed,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re on lots of prescription meds,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re disabled by their symptoms,</p>
<p>and certainly if you&rsquo;re bipolar</p>
<p>or have schizophrenia or something,</p>
<p>those are the people I really do want them</p>
<p>to work with a medical professional</p>
<p>because meds may need to be adjusted.</p>
<p>They really need a real shot at this diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like weight loss.</p>
<p>Weight loss, everybody wings it.</p>
<p>And either you&rsquo;re successful or you aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You look on the internet or you read a book</p>
<p>or you do, even the colleague that you mentioned,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably just reading,</p>
<p>who knows whether it&rsquo;s credible information or not.</p>
<p>And just winging it and seeing whether it works or not.</p>
<p>For people with serious mental disorders,</p>
<p>I want you to treat it like you have epilepsy.</p>
<p>Because you do have a serious brain disorder.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s impairing your ability to function in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impairing your health and happiness.</p>
<p>You deserve a competent medical treatment.</p>
<p>And we have that.</p>
<p>We have a hundred year evidence base.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got dieticians who know this</p>
<p>like the back of their hand.</p>
<p>They can monitor your level of ketosis.</p>
<p>They can help look for vitamin and nutrient deficiencies</p>
<p>that can be a consequence of the diet</p>
<p>and make sure that you&rsquo;re not developing those.</p>
<p>They can help tweak the diet if needed.</p>
<p>They can give you ideas</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting bored with eggs every morning.</p>
<p>They can give you ideas for what else you might have.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re using it to treat a serious disorder,</p>
<p>I think you need serious help.</p>
<p>A couple of questions, a little more detailed,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of people will have this on their mind.</p>
<p>Is it ever the case that you&rsquo;ll prescribe somebody</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet in conjunction with intermittent fasting?</p>
<p>So eat keto, but eat between the hours of whatever,</p>
<p>11 a.m. and 8 p.m. or something like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first question.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So, and I have one patient with type two diabetes</p>
<p>and chronic depression,</p>
<p>and he will try to follow a diet</p>
<p>and he will try to follow the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and sometimes his blood sugars are still very high.</p>
<p>And sometimes I will ask him to do either intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or even a three or four day water fast.</p>
<p>And it is shocking.</p>
<p>When he does a three or four day water fast,</p>
<p>you know, the first day or two feels like crap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say up front,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do it if you&rsquo;ve got an important meeting</p>
<p>or business trip or any like, don&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>So this is just consuming water.</p>
<p>This is just consuming water.</p>
<p>No black coffee.</p>
<p>I usually tell him he can have plain black coffee or tea,</p>
<p>but&hellip;</p>
<p>You have mercy after.</p>
<p>I have a tiny ounce of mercy,</p>
<p>but when he does it,</p>
<p>his blood sugars plummet in a good way.</p>
<p>Like his blood sugars are normalizing.</p>
<p>But the last time he did it,</p>
<p>he actually got to seven days at one point.</p>
<p>And he said, I feel great.</p>
<p>I want to keep going.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;m not hungry,</p>
<p>but I am not hungry at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t miss food at all.</p>
<p>And at seven days, I kind of cut the cord.</p>
<p>I was like, no, no, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You got to eat.</p>
<p>Well, I find it really interesting</p>
<p>that the intermittent fasting, of course,</p>
<p>controversial at some level,</p>
<p>but as to whether or not it&rsquo;s just beneficial</p>
<p>by way of caloric restriction,</p>
<p>because it is one way to achieve caloric restriction,</p>
<p>whether or not it has additional benefits.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m very interested in the neural side of it.</p>
<p>And it does seem that the fasted state</p>
<p>can start to take on its own rewarding properties</p>
<p>where people get dopamine release,</p>
<p>not from eating as most everyone does,</p>
<p>but from abstaining from food.</p>
<p>Now this can be pathologic</p>
<p>in the sort of example of anorexia nervosa,</p>
<p>which is, we both know,</p>
<p>is the most deadly psychiatric illness.</p>
<p>But for non-anorexics,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting to note</p>
<p>that eventually not eating</p>
<p>can have its own rewarding properties to it</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t just related to weight loss,</p>
<p>but in the short term, feeling,</p>
<p>in other words, feeling really good</p>
<p>by way of abstaining from eating.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, and that&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>it raises an important risk that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned yet,</p>
<p>but at least in psychiatric patients,</p>
<p>but even in some patients</p>
<p>who just use the keto diet for weight loss,</p>
<p>I have seen definite hypomania.</p>
<p>So these are people that aren&rsquo;t sleeping very much.</p>
<p>Are they also getting kind of delusional thinking?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to run for president?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So the distinction between hypomania and mania,</p>
<p>so mania, you might become psychotic and delusional.</p>
<p>Mania, by definition, is problematic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s causing a problem in some way or another.</p>
<p>And if you have psychotic symptoms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely called mania, full-blown mania.</p>
<p>Hypomania, for better or worse,</p>
<p>is something every human being probably craves.</p>
<p>So it is feeling extraordinarily good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting by on less sleep,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need the sleep.</p>
<p>Who needs sleep?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got things to do.</p>
<p>My brain is running on all cylinders.</p>
<p>I feel so creative.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been lots of famous people through the ages</p>
<p>who have been bipolar, probably bipolar,</p>
<p>and some of their most productive periods of time,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s art or creating scientific models</p>
<p>or what have you, were probably during hypomanic episodes.</p>
<p>So what do you do in that case?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m obsessed with getting sufficient quality sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of a repeating theme in our podcasts</p>
<p>and on many of my social media posts.</p>
<p>And I always recommend behavioral tools first,</p>
<p>then exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,</p>
<p>the appropriate times,</p>
<p>avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera.</p>
<p>And occasionally, for people who are doing all that</p>
<p>and still struggle with sleep supplementation,</p>
<p>one of the things that I&rsquo;ve seen some data on</p>
<p>is that for people who are following</p>
<p>a low-carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>that inositol in particular can be helpful</p>
<p>for getting into sleep,</p>
<p>probably because it has a bit of an anti-anxiety effect.</p>
<p>But presumably there are other things out there too.</p>
<p>The magnesiums will generally do that.</p>
<p>A hot bath will do that too, for that matter.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re talking about is people who are going,</p>
<p>what, a day and a half without sleep,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re just two hours of sleep a night?</p>
<p>I have, so the worst case I saw</p>
<p>was actually a mental health professional</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t recognize it initially.</p>
<p>He went six months with two to four hours</p>
<p>of sleep every night.</p>
<p>Because they were on a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>He was on a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>was getting by on two to four hours of sleep every night,</p>
<p>did not initially recognize that this was a problem.</p>
<p>He was feeling great.</p>
<p>He was feeling that keto high.</p>
<p>And he was actually waking up</p>
<p>and like at 4 a.m. going for 10 to 20 mile runs most days.</p>
<p>He finally stopped the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>after about six months</p>
<p>because he said, I can&rsquo;t maintain my weight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing too much weight.</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt.</p>
<p>So what do you, I was just thinking</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some social media personalities</p>
<p>that are associated with nutrition that might be hypomanic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you do the clinical evaluation.</p>
<p>So what does somebody do in that case?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve ever been hypomanic,</p>
<p>but as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;ve done a very high intensity workout</p>
<p>early in the day and I need to replenish carbohydrates,</p>
<p>I typically eat meat, fruit, and vegetables</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>Minimum amounts of fruit, but some.</p>
<p>And then at night I switch over to mainly carbohydrate.</p>
<p>It really helps me sleep.</p>
<p>It replenishes glycogen stores.</p>
<p>I sleep really well.</p>
<p>Wake up the next morning, repeat.</p>
<p>And of course, this goes against a lot of the dogma that,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re not supposed to eat carbohydrates late in the day.</p>
<p>And this is what works for me.</p>
<p>And so I do it.</p>
<p>For somebody like this mental health professional</p>
<p>who was hypomanic,</p>
<p>would going off the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>entirely be the best idea?</p>
<p>Or could it be that adjusting when they eat</p>
<p>their carbohydrates would be advantageous</p>
<p>in order to make sure that they felt alert</p>
<p>and great during the day,</p>
<p>maybe not hypomanic,</p>
<p>but then could have a four to eight hours a night sleep</p>
<p>as opposed to a two to four hours a night,</p>
<p>which is really very little sleep.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be healthy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not healthy.</p>
<p>Even if you can do it and feel great,</p>
<p>I imagine that the brain is suffering.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And the body is suffering.</p>
<p>And your friends and family are suffering.</p>
<p>The body is repairing itself with sleep.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s is not a patient,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not a mental health patient,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not using the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>as a mental health treatment,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re simply doing it for whatever.</p>
<p>I actually start with everything you&rsquo;ve just outlined.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with behavioral measures first.</p>
<p>And the first intervention is education.</p>
<p>You need at least six hours of sleep a night, period.</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s non-negotiable.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not getting at least six hours of sleep a night,</p>
<p>we need to consider this a problem.</p>
<p>So figure out a way to get six hours of sleep.</p>
<p>For some people, that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>Just the education.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get out of bed at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>It might take them an hour to fall back to sleep.</p>
<p>They fall back to sleep.</p>
<p>For most people, if you can get three nights</p>
<p>of decent sleep in a row, the hypomania goes away.</p>
<p>That is the way to extinguish it.</p>
<p>And then they still go on feeling a high from it.</p>
<p>They feel great.</p>
<p>Their brain feels good in terms of memory,</p>
<p>concentration, motivation, all of those things.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not hypomanic anymore.</p>
<p>And then I might use supplements, melatonin,</p>
<p>others that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Magnesium is a big one.</p>
<p>And for some, I will recommend exactly what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Eat some carbohydrates in the evening</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;re going to bed.</p>
<p>Either have them at dinner and then wait a few hours</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;re gonna go to bed</p>
<p>or have them right before you&rsquo;re gonna go to bed</p>
<p>just to try to calm your body down and get it going.</p>
<p>For when I&rsquo;m using this as a clinical intervention,</p>
<p>especially with patients with serious mental illness,</p>
<p>I actually want them in a state of ketosis long-term.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna do the carbohydrate intervention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try all the other ones.</p>
<p>But if they still can&rsquo;t sleep even with supplements,</p>
<p>over-the-counter supplements,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m probably gonna go with prescription</p>
<p>sleeping medicines as a temporary stopgap</p>
<p>to try to get them three to seven days of decent sleep</p>
<p>that usually breaks the hypomanic cycle.</p>
<p>And then they stay on the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>because it ends up resulting</p>
<p>in all of these other improvements that I&rsquo;ve described.</p>
<p>Their illness can sometimes go into full remission.</p>
<p>Is it low-dose trazodone as a first-line prescription?</p>
<p>I would not use trazodone.</p>
<p>I would actually specifically avoid trazodone</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an antidepressant</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re already hypomanic,</p>
<p>and I certainly don&rsquo;t wanna push that further.</p>
<p>So as long as it&rsquo;s somebody without a history of addiction,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna use a benzodiazepine</p>
<p>or either commonly called the Z medicines for sleep,</p>
<p>Zolpidem or Ambien or something like that.</p>
<p>Those tap into the opioid pathway, GABA-opioid.</p>
<p>GABA, GABA.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m probably, I usually start with something</p>
<p>like Ativan or Klonopin or something like that,</p>
<p>probably Ativan because it&rsquo;s shorter acting.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m only looking to use it short-term.</p>
<p>I let them know that upfront.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for three to seven days of decent sleep</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re gonna try to get them off that medicine.</p>
<p>And usually people are off to the races</p>
<p>and can sustain it well.</p>
<p>A question about hormones.</p>
<p>Many of the Hubern Lab podcast listeners will ask,</p>
<p>anytime we&rsquo;re talking about something like exercise</p>
<p>or drug treatment or behavioral treatment,</p>
<p>people will say, what about the menstrual cycle?</p>
<p>How is that impacted by this?</p>
<p>And how does this impact,</p>
<p>how does the menstrual cycle impact its efficacy, et cetera?</p>
<p>Carbohydrates and caloric restriction</p>
<p>have been implicated in different interaction,</p>
<p>are known to interact with the endocrine system.</p>
<p>So what do you do if you have a patient</p>
<p>who is depressed or could have psychotic symptoms,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s go with depression</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s probably a bit more familiar to most people.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re on a low carbohydrate</p>
<p>or full ketogenic diet, but their menstrual cycles cease.</p>
<p>How do you deal with those adjustments?</p>
<p>And I guess we could expand this conversation</p>
<p>and say, what about male fertility also?</p>
<p>Because sub-caloric diets seem to,</p>
<p>my understanding is that sub-maintenance caloric diets,</p>
<p>so weight loss diets,</p>
<p>will improve testosterone, estrogen ratios</p>
<p>in males that are obese,</p>
<p>but for someone that&rsquo;s not obese</p>
<p>to go on a sub-caloric diet</p>
<p>that it can start to impair testosterone levels</p>
<p>and probably not render them infertile,</p>
<p>but certainly adjust that whole axis.</p>
<p>So what about interactions between ketosis diets, et cetera,</p>
<p>and the endocrine system?</p>
<p>The real answer is I don&rsquo;t think anybody knows</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not a one size fits all answer</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen examples</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m aware of science</p>
<p>to back up polar opposite conclusions.</p>
<p>So the first general observation that I&rsquo;ll make,</p>
<p>I know so many couples,</p>
<p>husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends,</p>
<p>heterosexual couples</p>
<p>who have tried the ketogenic diet to lose weight together.</p>
<p>And end up with a baby.</p>
<p>Almost universally, the men have a much easier time</p>
<p>with it than the women.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not across the board,</p>
<p>but I know so many examples where the women say,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tolerate that diet.</p>
<p>It did not make me feel better.</p>
<p>It actually made me feel worse.</p>
<p>And I think in those cases,</p>
<p>it probably does relate to hormones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of animal models of mice in particular,</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and mouse models.</p>
<p>One researcher shared with me,</p>
<p>the thing that was striking</p>
<p>is that the female mice never got pregnant</p>
<p>on the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Whereas the mice on the standard diet</p>
<p>were just having babies right and left.</p>
<p>And it was just shocking, the difference.</p>
<p>On the surface, it makes sense.</p>
<p>The ketogenic diet is mimicking the fasting state.</p>
<p>Women who are trying to reproduce should not be fasting.</p>
<p>If your body is in a fasting state,</p>
<p>it probably does not wanna expend resources,</p>
<p>metabolic resources, calories, nutrients,</p>
<p>and other things to creating a baby</p>
<p>because your very life is being threatened</p>
<p>by quote unquote fasting or starvation.</p>
<p>That even though the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>is a sustainable non-starvation diet,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really using that diet to trick the body</p>
<p>into thinking that it is in a fasting or starvation state.</p>
<p>And so just from a kind of evolutionary stance,</p>
<p>it makes sense that women&rsquo;s bodies</p>
<p>may actually have significant changes in hormonal status</p>
<p>to prevent pregnancy</p>
<p>because a woman should not be having a baby</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s starving to death.</p>
<p>I know of examples of women who are the opposite though,</p>
<p>who have benefited dramatically</p>
<p>and tremendously from the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>have put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder</p>
<p>into full remission.</p>
<p>And I do actually know of one case, at least one case,</p>
<p>a woman infertile, she and her husband</p>
<p>had been trying for three years, no pregnancy,</p>
<p>she went keto, within four months she was pregnant.</p>
<p>How do I make sense of that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think we really have</p>
<p>good controlled data on what does the ketogenic diet do</p>
<p>to male hormonal systems?</p>
<p>What does the ketogenic diet do to female hormonal systems?</p>
<p>But, you know, clearly I think changes are happening</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have a way to predict it at least.</p>
<p>If somebody else has great insights, I welcome them,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t seen them published.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a terrific answer because when things are</p>
<p>all over the place and bi-directional,</p>
<p>depending on one circumstance or the other,</p>
<p>I think it screams for controlled studies</p>
<p>and more descriptions of case studies</p>
<p>and anecdotal data too.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s an excellent answer.</p>
<p>It also calls to mind the important</p>
<p>public service announcement that</p>
<p>because of these bi-directional effects that you describe,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t use fasting or the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>as a reliable form of contraception.</p>
<p>Yes, please don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I have a final question, which relates to something</p>
<p>that is very much starting to get buzzed now</p>
<p>and maybe more so for people that hang out</p>
<p>in the Twitter space or the nutrition space.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a new class of drugs that I think initially</p>
<p>were developed to treat diabetes,</p>
<p>but are now being evaluated for their efficacy</p>
<p>to treat obesity.</p>
<p>And these are the semi-glutide drugs</p>
<p>that are involved in,</p>
<p>they tap into these glucagon-related GLP-1 pathways.</p>
<p>And as is a story that we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>a little bit on the podcast before,</p>
<p>but many people I imagine probably</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t heard that conversation.</p>
<p>I would just simply like to know</p>
<p>what you think about these drugs.</p>
<p>They obviously adjust the way that glucose and insulin</p>
<p>are managing energy, both in the body and the brain,</p>
<p>and can produce weight loss.</p>
<p>So that to me, when I look at the data,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s impressive, but a good,</p>
<p>you know, a good logical shift in diet and exercise</p>
<p>could achieve similar weight loss,</p>
<p>but a lot of people just won&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So the question I have is,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on semi-glutide and other GLP,</p>
<p>I think I might&rsquo;ve said GLT before, excuse me,</p>
<p>GLP-1-related compounds?</p>
<p>And do you ever prescribe these</p>
<p>in conjunction with these dietary shifts?</p>
<p>Because it seems to me they would fall right in</p>
<p>with the catalog of other approaches</p>
<p>that you have available.</p>
<p>The real answer is I am not at all an expert</p>
<p>on these medications.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts about them?</p>
<p>I mean, they seem to be weight loss drugs,</p>
<p>not unlike the fen-fen drugs of the 90s</p>
<p>that then were banned because a few people</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t handle them well.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>And, you know, we had fen-fen,</p>
<p>and even before that in the 1950s and 60s and 70s,</p>
<p>dexedrine.</p>
<p>Amphetamine.</p>
<p>Amphetamine.</p>
<p>Mother&rsquo;s little helper.</p>
<p>Was, yes, was the treatment of choice</p>
<p>for women across the United States</p>
<p>to keep their slim figures.</p>
<p>And we created addicts and all sorts of problems,</p>
<p>but they were widely used in probably millions of women</p>
<p>because they work.</p>
<p>Because they kill appetite.</p>
<p>They kill appetite.</p>
<p>My overall thoughts are this.</p>
<p>There is zero doubt in my mind</p>
<p>that the obesity epidemic is a threat to human health</p>
<p>and potentially the human species.</p>
<p>If it keeps going at the rate it&rsquo;s going,</p>
<p>it is a threat to our species.</p>
<p>We have to figure out what on earth is happening</p>
<p>and what can we do about it.</p>
<p>These medications in early studies</p>
<p>are highly effective over a year or two.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s promising.</p>
<p>I am worried, though,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not attacking the root cause of obesity.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>if the root cause of obesity ends up being</p>
<p>some kind of poisoning of the metabolic machinery</p>
<p>in the brain or body,</p>
<p>and I would argue that probably relates</p>
<p>to mitochondrial health and mitochondrial function,</p>
<p>I have every reason to believe that taking a medication</p>
<p>that helps you lose weight</p>
<p>may not be addressing that problem</p>
<p>and therefore may not be addressing</p>
<p>all of the negative health consequences</p>
<p>of what we call obesity.</p>
<p>So obesity in and of itself,</p>
<p>we know that excess fat can become inflammatory</p>
<p>and can cause problems in and of itself,</p>
<p>but I actually see obesity as a symptom.</p>
<p>I see obesity as a symptom of metabolic derangement</p>
<p>in the body or brain.</p>
<p>And that is why people become obese.</p>
<p>And that if we&rsquo;re really going to get anywhere,</p>
<p>we need to identify what is causing</p>
<p>that metabolic derangement.</p>
<p>Using a symptomatic treatment like a GLP-1,</p>
<p>you know, medication,</p>
<p>to the best of my knowledge,</p>
<p>is not addressing that core problem.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just ignoring it.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll be wrong,</p>
<p>and maybe these will be the wonder drug</p>
<p>that saved the human species</p>
<p>and everybody will be thin and healthy forever and ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hopeful,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve had so many promising drugs come along,</p>
<p>Fen-Phen, Dexagen, other things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had so many promising drugs.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>when you try to muck with human metabolism</p>
<p>using a single processed molecule, man-made,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of even one example</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s been great for large numbers of people.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly manufacturing insulin</p>
<p>is life-saving for people with type 1 diabetes,</p>
<p>so that would be an example.</p>
<p>But giving massive doses of insulin</p>
<p>to people with type 2 diabetes</p>
<p>actually is a downward spiral.</p>
<p>I would much rather see people with type 2 diabetes</p>
<p>control their diabetes through diet and lifestyle,</p>
<p>and that might be a ketogenic diet or a low-carb diet</p>
<p>or exercise or good sleep or all of the other thing,</p>
<p>all of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather see that,</p>
<p>because when people try to control their type 2 diabetes</p>
<p>with a molecule,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s a natural molecule, insulin,</p>
<p>we know that that results in really poor health consequences,</p>
<p>results in higher rates of cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>higher rates of mental disorders,</p>
<p>higher rates of premature mortality.</p>
<p>Do I think GLP-1 molecules are going to be different?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t have any reason to think they are going to be.</p>
<p>So that would be buying two cents,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll see, time will tell.</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I want to thank you for doing</p>
<p>what is, without question, pioneering work.</p>
<p>I mean, again, I&rsquo;m not a clinician,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been around this space long enough</p>
<p>to know that, indeed, there are no wonder drugs, right?</p>
<p>There are drugs that certainly can help alleviate symptoms</p>
<p>in some individuals,</p>
<p>but that lifestyle, and in the case of your work in particular</p>
<p>and the discussion today,</p>
<p>diet and the ketogenic diet in particular,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear can have incredible effects,</p>
<p>miraculous effects in some individuals</p>
<p>and positive effects in others</p>
<p>that might not be of the same magnitude,</p>
<p>but nonetheless are extremely important.</p>
<p>So I, on behalf of myself and the listeners,</p>
<p>and certainly just on behalf of everybody out there,</p>
<p>because everyone does need to be concerned</p>
<p>about mental health issues,</p>
<p>whether or not they have them in their family themselves</p>
<p>or otherwise, because they impact everybody.</p>
<p>Just really want to thank you</p>
<p>for doing the work that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>because it really is pioneering and it&rsquo;s brave.</p>
<p>And I can see now, based on our discussion,</p>
<p>why it would work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given us a lot of hints into the underlying mechanisms</p>
<p>that suggest as to why it would work.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve given us examples as to how it has worked</p>
<p>in patients that you&rsquo;ve worked with.</p>
<p>And this field is expanding fast.</p>
<p>I think this is an area of psychiatry</p>
<p>and medicine in general,</p>
<p>meaning behavioral and nutritional interventions</p>
<p>that is expanding very fast.</p>
<p>So thank you for being brave and for taking this on</p>
<p>and doing it in such a structured way</p>
<p>and for communicating it here today</p>
<p>and with the general public through your book</p>
<p>and your online presence.</p>
<p>We will certainly point people in the direction</p>
<p>of those valuable resources.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you, Andrew, for being brave</p>
<p>and having me on your show and for a great conversation.</p>

<p>I hope you found it to be as an informative,</p>
<p>actionable and exciting in terms of the various treatments</p>
<p>that we can now think about</p>
<p>when considering treatments for psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>During today&rsquo;s episode, we did not discuss supplements,</p>
<p>but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>we do discuss supplements</p>
<p>because while supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing sleep and focus</p>
<p>and hormone augmentation and so forth.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered</p>
<p>with Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>because they are of the very highest quality</p>
<p>and they ship internationally.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>they have single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that allow you to devise the supplement regimen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most effective and most cost-effective for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements discussed</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>please go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab also has a zero-cost newsletter</p>
<p>that you can access.</p>
<p>It includes summaries of podcast episodes</p>
<p>as well as summaries of various protocols</p>

<p>I provide science and science-related tools</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with information</p>
<p>covered on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but often which is distinct from information</p>
<p>covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>So again, that&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on Instagram,</p>
<p>Twitter, and Facebook.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for joining me</p>
