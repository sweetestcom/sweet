    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>If you&rsquo;re just tuning in, go back and listen to part one because we unpacked a lot in the</p>
<p>last episode.</p>
<p>I told you about the investigation into the murder of 14-year-old Jenny Lynn, whose brutal</p>
<p>killing in 1994 shook the quiet community of Castro Valley, California, and it has left</p>
<p>investigators searching for her killer for 28 years.</p>
<p>When we left off last time, police were four months into their investigation and struggling</p>
<p>to find a viable suspect.</p>
<p>But a written questionnaire they passed out in the Lynn&rsquo;s neighborhood brought out the</p>
<p>most promising tip they&rsquo;d received yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>One of the responses to the questionnaire was from a woman who was part of the neighborhood</p>
<p>crime watch.</p>
<p>She said that she had talked to a neighbor of the Lynn&rsquo;s, and this neighbor told her</p>
<p>that she saw something the day Jenny was killed.</p>
<p>The neighbor was outside watering her rose bushes when she saw a man in front of the</p>
<p>And then, moments later, she heard glass shattering.</p>
<p>Now this was huge for investigators, a potential eyewitness, maybe someone who could give a</p>
<p>description of the killer.</p>
<p>So police tracked down the neighbor who allegedly saw this.</p>
<p>Police asked us not to use her real name, so we&rsquo;re going to call her Greta.</p>
<p>She lived across the street from the Lynn&rsquo;s, just a few houses down, but the story she</p>
<p>told police was a bit different and not very helpful.</p>
<p>She said she did see a man that day, but she didn&rsquo;t get a good look at his face, so</p>
<p>she couldn&rsquo;t offer that great of a description.</p>
<p>And she also completely denied hearing any glass break.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Smith again.</p>
<p>She was very, as the investigators would state, is she was very hesitant and wasn&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>cooperative in the interview, did not want to give this information up.</p>
<p>And she was in fear if she, when they&rsquo;re trying to get this information out of her, she was</p>
<p>in fear that if she said something that something was going to happen to her.</p>
<p>So what they did was they went back with an FBI agent who spoke in her native language.</p>
<p>She spoke in Arabic language and she&rsquo;s saying she&rsquo;s watering her roses.</p>
<p>She saw a man that she previously described, short, wearing a dark jacket, walk in front</p>
<p>of the Lynn home and then stop.</p>
<p>She said the man walked back and forth in front of the house and looked at it, but she</p>
<p>never saw him walk to the front door, never saw him go into the side yard and denied hearing</p>
<p>glass break.</p>
<p>Police wondered if Greta was walking back her initial statement because she was so scared</p>
<p>of retribution by the killer.</p>
<p>After their conversation with her, police got a hold of Greta&rsquo;s son, who said that</p>
<p>he saw his mom later that same day, but he said that his mom wasn&rsquo;t wearing her glasses</p>
<p>and Greta&rsquo;s eyesight without her glasses was extremely poor.</p>
<p>So her son was implying that anything she did see during that time might not have been</p>
<p>accurate since she couldn&rsquo;t see well.</p>
<p>After that, police encouraged Greta to let them know if she recalled anything else, but</p>
<p>it seemed unlikely.</p>
<p>So they decided that it was in their best interest to pursue other leads.</p>
<p>In December, so just over six months after Jenny&rsquo;s murder, detectives decided to revisit</p>
<p>their first suspect, Doug.</p>
<p>And in the four months since police had spoken to him, his story had changed, like majorly.</p>
<p>He told detectives that on May 27th, he was at his job at a local car wash until 6pm,</p>
<p>then went home and got cleaned up, and then picked up his girlfriend at around 8.</p>
<p>But if you remember from the last episode, his initial statement to police was that he</p>
<p>was at home alone the entire day until he picked up his girlfriend from work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a big thing not to remember, and a silly thing to lie about, because detectives</p>
<p>were easily able to do some fact-checking.</p>
<p>Police went straight to Doug&rsquo;s employer, and sure enough, they said he did not work on</p>
<p>May 27th.</p>
<p>So this made police even more suspicious of Doug, because if he didn&rsquo;t kill Jenny, why lie?</p>
<p>Police quietly continued investigating Doug&rsquo;s background, and a couple months later in February,</p>
<p>investigators asked him to come back to the station for a polygraph.</p>
<p>Initially he was reluctant, but he eventually agreed, and he also consented to something</p>
<p>a bit less conventional.</p>
<p>He agreed to rip some pieces of duct tape for them.</p>
<p>You see, they wanted to see if Doug tore the duct tape in the same way that the tape they</p>
<p>found on Jenny had been torn.</p>
<p>They had him do this, the FBI analyzed Doug&rsquo;s ripped duct tape and compared it to the ripped</p>
<p>tape in Jenny&rsquo;s case, and they concluded that the ripping wasn&rsquo;t similar.</p>
<p>And listen, I don&rsquo;t know this guy, I don&rsquo;t know how smart he was, but I don&rsquo;t think it</p>
<p>would take a genius to realize what police are getting after here, and I&rsquo;m sure it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be that hard to fake something like that, or to rip it differently than if you were</p>
<p>the person, you knew how you ripped it then, or how you always rip it, to do it differently,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, to me, I don&rsquo;t know what this really proves.</p>
<p>But after the tape experiment, Doug must have been spooked because he was like, you know,</p>
<p>that whole polygraph thing you wanted me to do?</p>
<p>Never mind, not into it anymore.</p>
<p>Doug said he wanted to consult a lawyer about it, so police had to let him, and they let</p>
<p>him go.</p>
<p>And there was nothing more they could really do with Doug, so they decided to look into</p>
<p>other tips that were coming in on Jenny&rsquo;s case over the next year.</p>
<p>But all the while, they kept Doug on their radar.</p>
<p>And by February of 1996, they circled back to Doug, and he finally did agree to take</p>
<p>a polygraph.</p>
<p>Doug also allowed police to search his car.</p>
<p>Detectives collected fibers from his car to compare against fibers that were found on</p>
<p>the duct tape used to bind Jenny.</p>
<p>And that polygraph?</p>
<p>It did, in fact, indicate deception.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the fibers weren&rsquo;t a match to anything.</p>
<p>So once again, police had to let Doug go.</p>
<p>The next big lead didn&rsquo;t come for another year.</p>
<p>In February of 97, that&rsquo;s when someone called in a tip.</p>
<p>But not a tip directly about the Jenny Lin case.</p>
<p>This tipster told the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office that there was a law enforcement impersonator</p>
<p>in their midst.</p>
<p>He said that a man, who we&rsquo;re going to call Alan, was going around claiming to be a detective</p>
<p>with the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, flashing a badge and requesting information about certain people.</p>
<p>After this complaint, police located Alan, and as part of the whole impersonation investigation,</p>
<p>they got a warrant to search his car.</p>
<p>And in the trunk of his car, detectives found something that made them wonder if Alan was</p>
<p>more than an impersonator.</p>
<p>He could actually be the murderer they&rsquo;ve spent the last three years looking for.</p>
<p>Because they found a roll of duct tape.</p>
<p>But not just any duct tape.</p>
<p>It was the exact brand of duct tape that was used to bind Jenny.</p>
<p>Police sent it off to the FBI lab to be analyzed.</p>
<p>And want to know what else they learned about Alan while the tape is getting looked at?</p>
<p>He actually lived in the same neighborhood as the Lins.</p>
<p>Even more than that, he lived with his wife and their children in that home.</p>
<p>And it was the exact same model as the Lins home, just in reverse.</p>
<p>Detectives also found out that Alan actually knew Jenny.</p>
<p>She and his daughter went to the same school, and Alan would sometimes drive them both to</p>
<p>school.</p>
<p>So, listen, this is one too many coincidences for police.</p>
<p>So armed with this information, detectives sat down with Alan to ask him some questions.</p>
<p>By the way, in this clip, Detective Smith refers to Alan as A because he&rsquo;s concealing</p>
<p>his real identity.</p>
<p>He has a question about the tape.</p>
<p>He says, you know, he used tape around the house, and not uncommon for him to have it</p>
<p>in his car and his house.</p>
<p>Question about the brand.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t always buy the same brand, just looks for whatever&rsquo;s on sale.</p>
<p>When Sergeant Nice is questioning him, and he&rsquo;s questioning about the Lin case, obviously</p>
<p>as the questioning starts to move forward without directly accusing him, A gets perturbed</p>
<p>thinking he&rsquo;s being questioned as a suspect.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s basically saying, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think I actually did this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how he&rsquo;s coming off to him.</p>
<p>Alan told police that he remembered the night Jenny died.</p>
<p>He was at home with his family when they heard sirens blaring.</p>
<p>They stepped outside and saw a bunch of police officers just down the street, right in front</p>
<p>of the Lin&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Detectives asked Alan to take a computer voice stress analyzer test, or a CVSA test, which</p>
<p>is basically a test along the same lines as a polygraph.</p>
<p>Its goal is to detect whether or not the subject is lying, again, just by using like</p>
<p>your voice rather than your heartbeat and sweat or whatever.</p>
<p>Alan agrees to take the test and he passes.</p>
<p>No deception indicated, though it is worth noting that in the years since Alan&rsquo;s CVSA</p>
<p>test was administered, the accuracy of voice stress analysis has been called into question.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Justice did a big study on this, and they found that these tests</p>
<p>only had a roughly 50% accuracy rate.</p>
<p>We actually linked to that study in our blog post for this episode, which you can find</p>
<p>on our website.</p>
<p>But like, listen, to be fair, polygraphs, which again is the alternative to a CVSA test,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t reliable 100% either.</p>
<p>According to APM reports, estimates of their reliability range from 70 to 90%, so more</p>
<p>reliable than CVSA tests, but neither option is perfect by any means.</p>
<p>Anyway, pretty shortly after Alan passed his CVSA test, the results came back from the</p>
<p>FBI about the tape found in his car.</p>
<p>It was not the same tape used on Jenny.</p>
<p>The FBI did find that the tear on Alan&rsquo;s tape and the tears on the tape in Jenny&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case had similarities, but they definitely proved that the tape used to bind Jenny did</p>
<p>not originate from the roll found in Alan&rsquo;s car, which, I mean, we&rsquo;re talking years</p>
<p>later, right?</p>
<p>I have no doubt the real killer is still rolling around with the same roll of duct</p>
<p>tape in their car.</p>
<p>So I was more interested in the findings when they compared the tear marks.</p>
<p>Because I think that&rsquo;s even more telling than the experiment they did with Doug.</p>
<p>Because again, if you&rsquo;re just someone pulling from the tape that you have in your car, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not planning on having that analyzed.</p>
<p>Like someone might be who is asked to tear the tape in front of police, you know?</p>
<p>And police were obviously kind of on the same page because just because it wasn&rsquo;t the same</p>
<p>roll or tear or whatever, they weren&rsquo;t ready to just write Alan off.</p>
<p>So police gathered fibers from Alan&rsquo;s car and sent those off to the FBI to be tested</p>
<p>and compared to the fibers that were found on the tape in Jenny&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But just like the fibers they took from Doug&rsquo;s car, they were not a match.</p>
<p>Police did find an old reserve deputy badge and ID in Alan&rsquo;s car, which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, okay, well, at least you got this guy on impersonating an officer.</p>
<p>But not so fast.</p>
<p>You see, Alan had previously been a reserve deputy for the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office,</p>
<p>the very agency interrogating him about Jenny&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Awkward.</p>
<p>But police couldn&rsquo;t prove that he&rsquo;d been flashing the badge, pretending to still be</p>
<p>a deputy.</p>
<p>So without any physical evidence, once again, they were back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>It took another full year for anything new to happen in Jenny&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But in 1998, police got a lead that would hand them the most promising suspect they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>ever had.</p>
<p>On February 20th, 1998, four years since Jenny was murdered, Sebastian Shaw, the guy that</p>
<p>I told you about in part one who was found sleeping in that stolen car with handcuffs</p>
<p>and duct tape and stuff in his trunk.</p>
<p>This guy came back on police&rsquo;s radar because he was arrested in Oregon for sexually assaulting</p>
<p>a 22-year-old woman at gunpoint three years earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how, but somehow police in Oregon had gotten a hold of Sebastian&rsquo;s DNA, which</p>
<p>matched the DNA from the woman&rsquo;s sexual assault forensic exam.</p>
<p>And that crime wasn&rsquo;t the only crime Sebastian was connected to through DNA.</p>
<p>His DNA had also been found at the scene of a 1992 double murder in Portland.</p>
<p>18-year-old Donna Ferguson and 29-year-old Todd Ruediger had been stabbed to death and</p>
<p>bound with cords.</p>
<p>Donna had also been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Sebastian was then also connected to the 1991 murder of 40-year-old J. Rick Beal, who had</p>
<p>also been bound with cords.</p>
<p>Sebastian was given three life sentences plus 30 years for the three murders, the sexual</p>
<p>assault and the attempted murder.</p>
<p>After he was convicted of those crimes, investigators with the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>started taking a closer look at Sebastian as a suspect in Jenny&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Remember, this guy had ties to California and Alameda County law enforcement knew that</p>
<p>he had been in their area in May of 1994 when Jenny was killed.</p>
<p>So they went to Oregon to actually question him, but he denied any involvement.</p>
<p>Though Sebastian&rsquo;s denial convinced no one, so they eventually turned to DNA testing.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, detectives gathered some of the items taken from the car Sebastian</p>
<p>stole in the 90s and sent them off for DNA testing.</p>
<p>But the results showed that none of the items contained Jenny&rsquo;s DNA.</p>
<p>After that, there wasn&rsquo;t much else police could do to connect Sebastian to Jenny&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>So once again, Jenny&rsquo;s case went back on the shelf to collect dust.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t stay there long.</p>
<p>Because in 2005, police got another big tip involving Sebastian, one that could potentially</p>
<p>connect him to Jenny&rsquo;s murder once and for all.</p>
<p>Detectives got a call from a former cellmate of Sebastian&rsquo;s who claimed that Sebastian</p>
<p>had bragged to him that he killed at least 10 people.</p>
<p>This inmate told our investigators that Shaw had admitted to him that he committed several</p>
<p>unsolved murders in several Western states and possibly one on the East Coast.</p>
<p>Shaw allegedly told this inmate he likes to bind his victims with duct tape, likes to</p>
<p>sexually assault his victims, likes to steal cars and switch license plates to avoid apprehension,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d like to cut and stab his victims to death.</p>
<p>He allegedly told this inmate how he&rsquo;d like to use a knife to cut off the victim&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>So in January of 2006, detectives with the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office went to get</p>
<p>a DNA swab from Sebastian.</p>
<p>Now you might be wondering why they had to get a swab from him at all.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a convicted killer, so his DNA was already in CODIS.</p>
<p>But Detective Smith told us that getting a hit in CODIS can be used for probable cause</p>
<p>to arrest someone.</p>
<p>But it actually gets trickier to use that hit in a court of law to get a conviction.</p>
<p>Things can get messy with chain of custody, like what agency put the DNA into CODIS, what</p>
<p>person did the swab, did they do it correctly, and the defense could potentially use that</p>
<p>to poke holes in the case.</p>
<p>So really, detectives were saving time by getting a swab directly from him.</p>
<p>Anyway, while police were there getting the swab, Sebastian made an alarming announcement,</p>
<p>seemingly unprovoked.</p>
<p>He told the detectives the exact same thing he&rsquo;d allegedly told his cellmate, that he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>killed at least 10 people.</p>
<p>Investigators saw this as their opportunity to press.</p>
<p>They asked if he was somehow involved with a murder out of Castro Valley, California.</p>
<p>But Sebastian denied ever killing someone in that area.</p>
<p>And the detectives reported that he dodged their questions about Jenny specifically.</p>
<p>Later that same year, Sebastian was publicly identified as a suspect in Jenny&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>He was the first suspect, whose name was made public.</p>
<p>But Sebastian adamantly maintained his innocence.</p>
<p>In a Statesman Journal article, Sebastian&rsquo;s attorney implied that investigators were biased</p>
<p>against Sebastian because of his record.</p>
<p>He said, quote, it&rsquo;s easy for them to look towards someone like my client with his other</p>
<p>convictions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen any physical evidence to suggest he was involved in the Jenny Lin case.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Police didn&rsquo;t reach out to Sebastian again until several months later, when they asked</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;d be willing to be formally questioned about Jenny&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>At first, Sebastian agreed.</p>
<p>But when detectives arrived at the prison for the interview, he refused to talk to them.</p>
<p>Even though he was already serving three life sentences up in Oregon, but now he was accused</p>
<p>of killing a 14-year-old girl.</p>
<p>That when you&rsquo;re in prison, of course, doesn&rsquo;t go over well.</p>
<p>So he was very angry about that.</p>
<p>So when they, our investigators, got up there and talked to him, he basically said, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not talking to you guys.</p>
<p>You guys put me on blast.</p>
<p>After a major lull in the investigation, Jenny&rsquo;s dad, John, took matters into his own hands.</p>
<p>By the fall of 2008, it had been 14 years since his daughter was murdered.</p>
<p>Sebastian was the most promising suspect police had, and John was determined to get answers.</p>
<p>So he wrote a letter to Sebastian, who was still incarcerated at a maximum security prison</p>
<p>in Salem, Oregon.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a voice actor reading an excerpt from John&rsquo;s first letter to Sebastian.</p>
<p>November 12th, 2008.</p>
<p>To Sebastian Alexander Shaw, Oregon State Penitentiary.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw, it is with great pain that I write this letter to you.</p>
<p>I am the father of the slain victim, Jennifer Lynn, who was murdered in my own home in Castro</p>
<p>Valley, California on May 27th, 1994.</p>
<p>And finally, the detectives have identified you as the prime suspect of the murder.</p>
<p>For the past 14 years, or more than 5,000 days, I woke up every morning and the first</p>
<p>picture came to mind was my daughter&rsquo;s brutal death.</p>
<p>I have so many things I wish to say to you, however, nothing I can say now will bring</p>
<p>my daughter back.</p>
<p>I want you to think back 14 years and answer the following questions.</p>
<p>Why did you target my daughter?</p>
<p>How did you get into my house?</p>
<p>Why did you have to kill her?</p>
<p>Even though you haven&rsquo;t admitted it, it&rsquo;s clear in my mind that you did it.</p>
<p>So why can&rsquo;t you just admit it and be responsible for your own act?</p>
<p>Did you ever feel sorry and remorseful for killing my daughter?</p>
<p>You have relatives yourself, and can you imagine the impact of losing your own relatives to</p>
<p>violent crimes?</p>
<p>Jennifer&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Sebastian used an Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s PO Box as his return address.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure if Sebastian would even bother to write him back.</p>
<p>But a little over a week later, a letter appeared.</p>
<p>November 21st, 2008.</p>
<p>Dear Jennifer Lynn&rsquo;s father, first of all, I want you to know that in the past I&rsquo;ve received</p>
<p>letters for journalists in that area, and I take your letter with Jennifer Lynn&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>with a huge grain of salt, roughly the size of a cow lick.</p>
<p>You may or may not be Jennifer Lynn&rsquo;s father, who knows.</p>
<p>I have asked sources in the past to get me in touch with Jail&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Would you be amenable to a face-to-face meeting here in Oregon?</p>
<p>If I could meet you and talk with you and afterwards in the same room take a lie detector</p>
<p>test in your presence and look you in the eye as I answer those questions you want to</p>
<p>ask, need to ask.</p>
<p>The law is a pit bull, and the sheer tenacity of those detectives who hunt monsters are</p>
<p>to be greatly admired.</p>
<p>I understood the concept of duty.</p>
<p>To this day, if the military need me to serve at a highly dangerous job, I would do it.</p>
<p>So please, if you are indeed Jail&rsquo;s father, write me and I will gladly correspond with</p>
<p>you and help you clear this misdirected conception that the ever so tenacious lawmen have put</p>
<p>into your head.</p>
<p>My sincere regrets that you were a victim of such horrendous violence.</p>
<p>It is a real travesty of the natural law to outlive one&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>Give me your telephone number and once I have verified that it is indeed you, I will put</p>
<p>you on my allowed to call list and we&rsquo;ll talk.</p>
<p>Until then, God keep you and your safe and blessed.</p>
<p>S.</p>
<p>John felt compelled to respond to Sebastian&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>By the way, we have the full copies of these letters that you can read in their entirety</p>
<p>on our website.</p>
<p>February 18th, 2009.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw, I am disappointed at your disbelief that I am not Jennifer&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>And no, her name is not JL.</p>
<p>Her name is Jennifer, if you still have the conscience to call her by name.</p>
<p>It took a lot of praying to be able to write to you to begin with.</p>
<p>I do not feel comfortable at this time to give you my personal phone number or see you</p>
<p>face to face.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw, I am a father looking for answers.</p>
<p>I believe you have the answers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done quite a bit of study on your past crimes with help by the Sheriff&rsquo;s detectives.</p>
<p>I am pretty certain that you are responsible for my daughter&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>I know you stole a car in San Ramon, California around the time when my daughter was murdered.</p>
<p>Why did you choose this house and area to commit your crime?</p>
<p>John Lin.</p>
<p>February 24th, 2009.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Lin, I am disappointed in your disappointment at my disbelief on whether you are Jennifer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>father or not.</p>
<p>Are you kidding?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but the fact of the matter is anyone can print out any letter on a computer, put</p>
<p>a little ink on the bottom, and call himself such and such.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t convinced me yet.</p>
<p>Okay, as to the fact you have studied my past crimes, none of them did I ever use duct tape.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>Not one.</p>
<p>An anger and frustration I have killed, and it&rsquo;s usually something I do at the spur of</p>
<p>the moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that has always been a part of my psyche.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unhealthy, very destructive, and causes me no end of grief.</p>
<p>Part of it, I believe, is an anger at my&hellip;</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s another time.</p>
<p>As to my having duct tape in my car, I was living out of that car at the time.</p>
<p>What person does not have a roll of duct tape in their garage?</p>
<p>The killer who slayed Jennifer was an organized killer, something of which I have never been</p>
<p>accused of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very tragic that you lost your daughter at such a young age.</p>
<p>I pray that you come to peace with it.</p>
<p>Modern day shows like CSI and others of its kind make it seem so easy to solve crimes</p>
<p>and the motives of the killer so clear.</p>
<p>Sometimes things happen with such weird coincidence that it makes it easy to come to a conclusion,</p>
<p>albeit a wrong one.</p>
<p>If I wronged you, then I would ask for forgiveness.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have a need to ask Mr. Lin for his forgiveness, because I never wronged him.</p>
<p>So there it is.</p>
<p>Give up your quest for vengeance.</p>
<p>Believe me when I say revenge doesn&rsquo;t give very much satisfaction.</p>
<p>I give you my prayers.</p>
<p>May you find your way back.</p>
<p>Yours truly, S.</p>
<p>After this, John made one last attempt at getting information straight from the suspect&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>April 16th, 2009 Mr. Shaw, I don&rsquo;t think I need to spend any more effort convincing</p>
<p>you that I am Jennifer&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>You should have come to that conclusion yourself as you read through my letters, which could</p>
<p>only come from a tireless father continuing his quest for his daughter&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw, my heart ached as I was holding your letter.</p>
<p>It gave me such a chill as I thought of the senseless crimes that you committed, as you</p>
<p>put it, at the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>Was Jennifer&rsquo;s death the result of your brutal acts at the spur of the moment?</p>
<p>You state in your letter that Jennifer was killed by an organized killer.</p>
<p>How can you make that assumption if you were not there?</p>
<p>As far as I know, investigators have not released any type of information that would</p>
<p>lead anyone to that conclusion.</p>
<p>And even if it was an organized killer, it still doesn&rsquo;t mean you weren&rsquo;t the one responsible.</p>
<p>Based on what I read about you, I can tell that you are a very capable individual, one</p>
<p>who has great ability to organize an evil plan at the spur of the moment and execute</p>
<p>it well.</p>
<p>Plus, there were just too many coincidences for me to not think of you as Jenny&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>Tell me why you were in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Why San Ramon?</p>
<p>Where were you on Friday afternoon before the memorial weekend of 1994?</p>
<p>How did you choose your victims?</p>
<p>Why did you slash their throats?</p>
<p>Are there other victims the police do not know about?</p>
<p>Other families that suffer as my family, not knowing who killed their loved ones, waiting</p>
<p>for justice?</p>
<p>John Lynn.</p>
<p>Sebastian never responded and John never wrote to him again.</p>
<p>They never spoke on the phone and they never met face to face.</p>
<p>There had been lulls in the investigation in prior years, but for the next seven years,</p>
<p>there was zero developments in Jenny&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>In 2015, law enforcement took one more shot at Sebastian, but he denied being involved,</p>
<p>just as vehemently as he did in 1994 and 1998.</p>
<p>He continued to cling to his innocence until he died in October of 2021.</p>
<p>Even though their most promising suspect is dead, police haven&rsquo;t given up their quest</p>
<p>for justice.</p>
<p>They still have some foreign DNA that was collected from the Lynn&rsquo;s house nearly 30</p>
<p>years ago.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re hoping will bring answers to the mystery that&rsquo;s haunted the</p>
<p>Bay Area for decades.</p>
<p>The last time the DNA was tested was just earlier this year.</p>
<p>And Detective Smith says they&rsquo;re not done trying.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at the tape again.</p>
<p>There are some other things that we&rsquo;re looking at as well.</p>
<p>Other items of evidence that we&rsquo;re looking into.</p>
<p>So this really hasn&rsquo;t stopped as far as how we&rsquo;re trying to find evidence, largely DNA</p>
<p>evidence from the evidence that we have.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re coming up with a plan of where we want to go from here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy just to say, well, let&rsquo;s take this piece of evidence and send it over to him</p>
<p>and ask him to analyze it.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;ve looked at a lot of things multiple times, you know, you really got to</p>
<p>put some thought into how you attack this evidence.</p>
<p>Because number one, science could change.</p>
<p>We know how fast science is changing and how sensitive equipment is changing from year</p>
<p>to year.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to necessarily do something that is like the Hail Mary all for one shot.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing something that might affect future testing.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re sitting back and not doing anything.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just being thoughtful in the way we go about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating because these things take time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like on TV where you can submit something and 50 minutes later we&rsquo;re getting the results.</p>
<p>It takes time and it&rsquo;s very frustrating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating for the family most of all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating to myself, but hopefully one day we&rsquo;re going to get there.</p>
<p>Even though Detective Smith doesn&rsquo;t know who killed Jenny that fateful day, he has little</p>
<p>doubt about how it happened.</p>
<p>But his theory that Jenny&rsquo;s killer was lying in wait in the Lynn home gives me chills.</p>
<p>When you look at the totality of this, of Jenny&rsquo;s case and the facts of it, you know,</p>
<p>I believe that the suspect did enter through that window.</p>
<p>He attempted to get in upstairs through the balcony, did get into the window, tried to</p>
<p>conceal that entry and was actually in the house before Jenny got home from school.</p>
<p>When you think about it, if Jenny had been home and that window broke, if someone was</p>
<p>home and you&rsquo;re breaking windows, and we know that when Jenny was home, she was playing</p>
<p>on the piano, which was right next to the window, she was talking on the phone, she</p>
<p>was watching TV downstairs, the TV was on, she was right there.</p>
<p>Play the scenario out.</p>
<p>If she was home and that happened, if for some reason the suspect was so quick that</p>
<p>he was able to get there before she could get out, I don&rsquo;t believe he would have seen</p>
<p>the cover up of the window.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t make any logical sense to believe that that happened, that entry made</p>
<p>while she was home.</p>
<p>Detective Smith&rsquo;s working theory is that after Jenny got off the phone with her friends,</p>
<p>she turned on the TV and went into the kitchen.</p>
<p>He thinks Jenny was standing in the kitchen making her microwave dinner when she heard</p>
<p>some commotion upstairs and went to investigate.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t think that was an accident.</p>
<p>His theory is that she was purposefully drawn up there and was caught by surprise.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, Detective Smith strongly believes that Jenny&rsquo;s killer was either someone who</p>
<p>surveilled the Lins for a while, or a friend, maybe someone who knew the family well enough</p>
<p>to know their routines.</p>
<p>They probably watched, knew the comings and goings.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a random attack.</p>
<p>They came prepared.</p>
<p>The tape was forwarded to the house.</p>
<p>They obviously had some kind of knife.</p>
<p>They took some time.</p>
<p>There was some planning that went into this.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve researched Jenny&rsquo;s case, every twist and turn has left my head spinning.</p>
<p>And I think one of the things that&rsquo;ll be keeping me up at night is the man that John saw at</p>
<p>the BART station a few weeks before Jenny&rsquo;s murder, the man who told John he had his daughter.</p>
<p>Again, detectives think it was just a coincidence, but I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that maybe it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, the timing was almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>But as soon as I convince myself that it&rsquo;s connected, I ask again, why?</p>
<p>What would have been the point?</p>
<p>Because that man, whoever he was, didn&rsquo;t have either of John&rsquo;s daughters.</p>
<p>What was he doing?</p>
<p>Was he testing something?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, though, that neither of the composite sketches that were done of this</p>
<p>man resemble any of the suspects or persons of interest or anyone we talked about in these episodes.</p>
<p>So maybe that weird interaction at the BART station was just a coincidence, or maybe not.</p>
<p>After the case, Detective Smith hasn&rsquo;t given up hope for catching Jenny&rsquo;s killer,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s one of the suspects already known to police or someone who has yet to</p>
<p>come on their radar.</p>
<p>Detective Smith&rsquo;s been working Jenny&rsquo;s case since 2018, and he&rsquo;s as determined to solve</p>
<p>the case today as he was four years ago.</p>
<p>Well, you just look at this, and here&rsquo;s this 14-year-old girl, life snuffed out brutally.</p>
<p>I have kids.</p>
<p>You see the lens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amazing people, amazingly strong people.</p>
<p>So you put yourself in their shoes, and that&rsquo;s what keeps you motivated.</p>
<p>I think we all get into this job because you want to, you know, you&rsquo;d love to be able to</p>
<p>prevent the crime, but, you see, in my line of work, the only thing you can do is try</p>
<p>to find the perpetrators and at least help render some sort of justice.</p>
<p>That motivation, when you see something like this, you just know what it means to the family,</p>
<p>what it means to her friends.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what motivates me, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this over, you know, over a decade, and it&rsquo;s hard to let that stuff</p>
<p>go because you know the cases you&rsquo;re leaving behind.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m under any illusions that I can solve them all, but that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just hoping that we find something that is a piece of evidence that identifies one</p>
<p>person that&rsquo;s, you know, an intimate piece of evidence that ties somebody to a crime</p>
<p>scene that&rsquo;d be something that you&rsquo;d be having a hard time explaining your way out of, particularly</p>
<p>when, you know, if it does come from the crime scene of a 14-year-old murder victim</p>
<p>in her own home, inside her parents&rsquo; bathroom, most people would have a tough time explaining</p>
<p>how that got there.</p>
<p>In the years since Jenny&rsquo;s murder, John and Mei Lin have been left to mourn their daughter</p>
<p>who never got to grow up, never got to experience life and change the world.</p>
<p>But despite their unspeakable loss and sorrow, the Lins chose to create something positive</p>
<p>out of their living nightmare.</p>
<p>After Jenny was killed, John and Mei Lin founded the Jenny Lin Foundation to promote</p>
<p>child safety and youth music education.</p>
<p>The foundation sponsors events like Free Music Camp and Safety Awareness Education.</p>
<p>They also aim to help law enforcement fight and solve crimes against children.</p>
<p>Well, at the time, of course, we were all heartbroken.</p>
<p>We were devastated and we really would not have any ability to even pick up the kind</p>
<p>of mission like what we have done in the past.</p>
<p>But through the help of our friends, our classmates, they really gave us enough, a lot of encouragement,</p>
<p>a lot of support and thought that in order to keep to find this killer, in order to keep</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s memory alive, the best way is to form a foundation and keep working on getting to</p>
<p>the bottom of this case.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>So with the help of our friends and family members, we formed the foundation and started</p>
<p>this mission.</p>
<p>The foundation also holds the Jenny Lin Walk every year on the anniversary of Jenny&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>So we do the walk to keep the public aware.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to make sure that you be careful with your children.</p>
<p>Just be aware of your surroundings and support the child safety activity and just keep the</p>
<p>environment safe.</p>
<p>We wanted the public to know that loss of a child is just priceless.</p>
<p>We cannot afford to have any child lost through violence.</p>
<p>We asked John and Mei-Lin if they still think that Sebastian was responsible for what happened</p>
<p>to their daughter.</p>
<p>Well, I can only go by what the investigation team&rsquo;s conclusions and their conclusion was</p>
<p>pretty much inconclusive.</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;m kind of grateful that this guy got locked up and was unable to do any more</p>
<p>damage to society, I&rsquo;m still very frustrated that someone out there who killed Jenny may</p>
<p>still be free walking on the street.</p>
<p>Every time when they zero in on someone, it gave us hope that this could be the person</p>
<p>that could close the case.</p>
<p>Of course, we would be very anxious to know the results, to hope that the police would</p>
<p>keep going and keep digging and keep getting to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>So it really gave us hope.</p>
<p>A lot of times, the police couldn&rsquo;t really give us any new information, and that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>we feel like, are they still doing investigation or not?</p>
<p>I know that they have been treating this as a very pretty high priority case, even after</p>
<p>all these years, but it&rsquo;s really very frustrating to just keep waiting and waiting for even</p>
<p>this long time, 28 years.</p>
<p>Any moment to us is too long.</p>
<p>What else can we do?</p>
<p>What else can we do other than just keeping patient and hope that the police will do their</p>
<p>best for us?</p>
<p>One of the things that Jenny&rsquo;s parents miss about her the most is her hugs.</p>
<p>Maylynn said Jenny was such a hugger.</p>
<p>She gave those big, meaningful hugs to her family all the time, and her family hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>felt one of those hugs in 28 years.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s death left a hole in the Lynn&rsquo;s lives that can never be filled.</p>
<p>John, Maylynn, and Rhoda have waited long enough for justice for their beloved Jenny.</p>
<p>Somebody somewhere knows something, and it could be that final piece of the puzzle law</p>
<p>enforcement needs to close this case for good.</p>
<p>If that someone is you, if you have any information about the murder of Jenny Lynn on May 27,</p>
<p>1994, please contact the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 510-667-3636, or call the Jenny</p>
<p>Lynn hotline at 855-4JENNYLYNN, that&rsquo;s 855-453-6695.</p>
<p>Again, there is currently a $200,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and</p>
<p>conviction of Jenny&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know anything about her murder, but you&rsquo;d still like to help in some way,</p>
<p>you can donate to the Jenny Lynn Foundation at JennyLynnFoundation.org.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have that linked in the show notes.</p>
