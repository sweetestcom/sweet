    <p>There are no right answers for anything involved in art.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all trying experiments to find a way.</p>
<p>And even for the things that I work on,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a set way that I do anything.</p>
<p>I come to every project blank.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re just a meat vehicle</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re channeling ideas from somewhere else.</p>
<p>I believe we know close to nothing,</p>
<p>close to nothing, about anything.</p>
<p>If we embrace that not knowing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have a healthier experience going through life.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Rick Rubin,</p>
<p>one of the greatest music producers of all time,</p>
<p>known for bringing the best out of anyone he works with,</p>
<p>no matter the genre of music or even the medium of art,</p>
<p>or just the medium of creating</p>
<p>something beautiful in this world.</p>
<p>And the list of musicians he produced includes many,</p>
<p>many, many of the greats over the past 40 years,</p>
<p>including the Beastie Boys, Eminem, Metallica,</p>
<p>LL Cool J, Kanye West, Slayer, Tom Petty,</p>
<p>Johnny Cash, Dixie Chicks, Aerosmith, Adele,</p>
<p>Danzig, Red Hot Chili Peppers,</p>
<p>System of a Down, Jay Z, Black Sabbath.</p>
<p>I can keep going for a very long time here.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Rick is just an amazing human being.</p>
<p>We became fast friends, which is surreal to say,</p>
<p>and is just an incredible honor.</p>
<p>I felt truly heard as a person</p>
<p>when I spent the day with him</p>
<p>eating some delicious Texas barbecue,</p>
<p>talking about life, about music, about art, about beauty.</p>
<p>This was a conversation and experience I will never forget.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>

<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>Are you nervous?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not shaky, but I would say I feel uneasy.</p>
<p>And I feel like the sooner we start talking,</p>
<p>the more relaxed we&rsquo;ll get.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we should sit in this moment</p>
<p>and enjoy the nervousness of it.</p>
<p>Let me start with Nietzsche.</p>
<p>He said, without music, life would be a mistake.</p>
<p>What do you think he means by that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk some philosophy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to analyze Friedrich Nietzsche from a century ago.</p>
<p>It seems like music has the ability</p>
<p>to bring us so much depth in our soul</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard to access any other way.</p>
<p>And without it, there would be a loss</p>
<p>beyond the pleasure of it.</p>
<p>Feels like it&rsquo;s a window into something else.</p>
<p>Something that no other medium</p>
<p>can express quite the same way.</p>
<p>I would say not as automatically.</p>
<p>Something about music can do it automatically.</p>
<p>Maybe poetry or maybe certain abstract forms</p>
<p>can get us there.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about music</p>
<p>that really can get us there quickly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the time, the place, the history.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about, like a lot of my family&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in Philly, there&rsquo;s something about driving</p>
<p>through Jersey and listening to Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>And then you just, I&rsquo;ll get emotional.</p>
<p>Like listening to I&rsquo;m On Fire.</p>
<p>That like, one of my favorite Bruce Springsteen songs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a haunting kind of strumming to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a strumming, it&rsquo;s actually picked.</p>
<p>It has a country feel to it,</p>
<p>almost like a Johnny Cash feel actually.</p>
<p>And it, I don&rsquo;t know, makes me feel,</p>
<p>so for people who don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m On Fire.</p>
<p>That song is, I guess, a love song to a woman</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t have because she&rsquo;s married</p>
<p>or she&rsquo;s with somebody else,</p>
<p>which I guess is quite a lot of love songs.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about the haunting nature</p>
<p>of the guitar and then it has to be driving through Jersey.</p>
<p>And I feel like everyone has fallen in love</p>
<p>with a Jersey girl at one point in their life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true for her,</p>
<p>but I feel like that.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t either, but I just feel like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about Bruce Springsteen is like,</p>
<p>yeah, I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>And that just takes you to a place of emotion</p>
<p>that you just, that captures love,</p>
<p>that captures longing, that captures the heartbreak</p>
<p>of just the way time flows in life</p>
<p>and the fact that it&rsquo;s finite</p>
<p>and just all of that in a single simple song.</p>
<p>What else can capture that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s a connection</p>
<p>both between time and place and music.</p>
<p>And I, certain music growing up on the East Coast</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really resonate with me</p>
<p>until I spent time on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Eagles being an example.</p>
<p>When I lived in New York,</p>
<p>the Eagles didn&rsquo;t really speak to me.</p>
<p>ZZ Top didn&rsquo;t really speak to me.</p>
<p>And then when I started spending time in California</p>
<p>and driving through Laurel Canyon,</p>
<p>all of a sudden the music of the Eagles felt</p>
<p>appropriate somehow.</p>
<p>And I started listening to it more.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So not until you went out West</p>
<p>can you understand the sounds of the West.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really like New York has a sound.</p>
<p>What other places have a sound in the United States?</p>
<p>I think every place does.</p>
<p>And that said, sometimes we can get an experience</p>
<p>through music of a place.</p>
<p>Like we can resonate with the music and not understand why.</p>
<p>And then maybe when we go to the place</p>
<p>where it was created,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like we have a knowingness of that place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a strange place anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, Stevie Ray Vaughan with blues and Texas blues.</p>
<p>You can just listen to Texas Flood and just,</p>
<p>again, this is like a woman you&rsquo;re missing,</p>
<p>a broken heart and somehow that connects to the place.</p>
<p>The Eagles, what song with the Eagles connects with you?</p>
<p>Are we talking about like Take It Easy</p>
<p>or are we talking more like Hotel California?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking Take It Easy, but both are great.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s certain songs</p>
<p>when I started learning guitar when I was young</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, I would like to be the kind of person</p>
<p>that not only knows how to play this song,</p>
<p>but understands the song and like have that song</p>
<p>be something I played 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve lived with that song for a while.</p>
<p>Like Hotel California is an example.</p>
<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s the solo,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the soulfulness of the lyrics,</p>
<p>which I still don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And it could be about anything.</p>
<p>And as you get older,</p>
<p>I feel like the meaning of the song could be anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the beauty of them.</p>
<p>I think when the person wrote them,</p>
<p>they may have had one interpretation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not contingent on us getting that interpretation</p>
<p>to like it or resonate with it or feel it.</p>
<p>In some ways, the best art is open enough</p>
<p>where the artist gets to have their experience</p>
<p>when they make it</p>
<p>and then the audience gets to have their experience</p>
<p>when they listen and they don&rsquo;t have to be the same.</p>
<p>And then it connects thousands</p>
<p>or millions of people together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a togetherness of music when you share that music,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re listening to stuff together, like in a car.</p>
<p>First of all, the car is a sacred place.</p>
<p>So I work in part on autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>And you start to think, well,</p>
<p>what are the things you lose</p>
<p>when the car stops being the central part of American life?</p>
<p>The car ownership.</p>
<p>It just feels like the car, when you&rsquo;re alone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a therapist thing, session,</p>
<p>because you get angry at other humans</p>
<p>and then you get to like sit in your own anger and emotion.</p>
<p>You get to listen to the song on a long road trip</p>
<p>and remember, like run through your memories, the heartbreak.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the one that got away,</p>
<p>but also like the beautiful moments, all of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and all of that in the car.</p>
<p>Yeah, driving also serves another purpose.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the things that we can do</p>
<p>that we have to pay attention enough not to crash,</p>
<p>but typically can essentially run on autopilot enough</p>
<p>where we could be thinking about something else</p>
<p>or concentrating on something else.</p>
<p>And the difference between concentrating on something</p>
<p>or trying to solve a problem</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re solely trying to solve a problem</p>
<p>versus when you have some little task</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s keeping you occupied,</p>
<p>I find if I have something slight to take care of,</p>
<p>it frees a more creative side of my mind</p>
<p>to better solve problems.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m kind of jealous of people</p>
<p>that found that in painting, for example.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be drawing or painting and listening to,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the small task you do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re coloring in the lines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this gentle, peaceful, slow process</p>
<p>that requires just a small fraction of your mind</p>
<p>and then you can listen.</p>
<p>Some people listen to podcasts that way.</p>
<p>Some people listen to music that way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you do it?</p>
<p>How do you free your mind?</p>
<p>Yeah, running is one of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a process.</p>
<p>So most freeing of the mind for me</p>
<p>has to go through a process of a bit of pain for a bit.</p>
<p>So doing something difficult,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like an airplane taking off or something.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like, for example, running.</p>
<p>The first few miles would just be,</p>
<p>just first of all, the physical aspect,</p>
<p>which is like, ah, you&rsquo;re so fat.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re out of shape.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, this is the getting old, this, that.</p>
<p>Okay, that slowly dissipates.</p>
<p>And then the demons come in who are like,</p>
<p>you should be getting this and that and this done.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t gotten it done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like breaking promises,</p>
<p>all those kinds of voices coming in.</p>
<p>And after that, maybe mile four,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, fuck it.</p>
<p>You just run, run with the wind at a very slow pace,</p>
<p>but with the wind, and then you could think.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the footsteps, the physical activity.</p>
<p>Then you could deeply think about stuff, ideas,</p>
<p>sort of design, whether it&rsquo;s program design stuff</p>
<p>or like high level life decisions, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I would say running.</p>
<p>I used to build bridges from toothpicks.</p>
<p>I used to be a thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an engineering.</p>
<p>I guess some people like glue together airplanes</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But the bridges, it&rsquo;s such deeply honest work</p>
<p>because at the end of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to test that bridge</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna see how good your work was.</p>
<p>The little details, but also the big picture.</p>
<p>Do you use glue or no?</p>
<p>Yeah, use glue.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not pure physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s materials engineering too.</p>
<p>Because the way you want to do it is</p>
<p>you actually split the wood as thin as possible</p>
<p>and then glue it back together</p>
<p>because the glue is really strong,</p>
<p>except for the arches and things like that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re building arch bridges,</p>
<p>which is a whole nother skill</p>
<p>because you have to bend the wood.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so cool</p>
<p>because the thing can hold thousands of times its weight.</p>
<p>And then you get to watch it explode at a certain point</p>
<p>from the pressure and when you do a really good job,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t explode in a kind of some weak point</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t anticipate just kind of starts cracking.</p>
<p>Everything cracks, everything explodes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just pieces fly everywhere.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s literally hundreds of hours of work</p>
<p>just explode in front of you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a metaphor for life maybe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all for nothing,</p>
<p>except for the journey that you took to get there.</p>
<p>And no one understands.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, back to Nietzsche,</p>
<p>these questions are ridiculous.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna have to try to figure out</p>
<p>what the heck I&rsquo;m trying to do here.</p>
<p>So Nietzsche also said,</p>
<p>a line I love, which is,</p>
<p>and those who were seen dancing</p>
<p>were thought to be insane</p>
<p>by those who could not hear the music.</p>
<p>Do you, Rick Rubin, ever feel crazy?</p>
<p>Or maybe you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s sane</p>
<p>and everybody else is crazy.</p>
<p>You know that the dancing, the joy of the music,</p>
<p>of just feeling the music</p>
<p>and everybody else just doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And this doesn&rsquo;t have to be literally about music.</p>
<p>This is about art, about creation.</p>
<p>I would say I feel different</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like which side of the equation is crazy, you know?</p>
<p>Did you ever find a group of people</p>
<p>that you get, they get you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is that what producing is essentially?</p>
<p>Is you try to find the moments</p>
<p>when you just get each other?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would say there are definitely certain artists</p>
<p>with certain temperaments.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re around them,</p>
<p>it feels like you can finish each other&rsquo;s sentences.</p>
<p>You know, just see the world the same way.</p>
<p>Comedians as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not essential for the two of you together</p>
<p>creating something special.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>So it could be attention too?</p>
<p>It could be anything.</p>
<p>It could be any, there&rsquo;s no rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be like, think of it like a coach.</p>
<p>A coach could bring what they have to bring</p>
<p>to any talented individual</p>
<p>and help them find their way.</p>
<p>And sometimes the right coach for the right athlete</p>
<p>really works and other times there&rsquo;s a mismatch.</p>
<p>Have you seen the movie Whiplash?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I saw it when it came out</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t really remember it well, but I did see it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a coach type of figure.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Who is pushing a drummer to create,</p>
<p>to grow as a musician, but also to create something special.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s even special music skill wise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a special moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s trying to create.</p>
<p>From one perspective, it&rsquo;s just an abusive,</p>
<p>a person who selfishly gets off on being abusive</p>
<p>to those he&rsquo;s with.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, the way I saw that movie,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s just the two right humans finding each other</p>
<p>at the right moment in life</p>
<p>and risking destroying each other in the process,</p>
<p>but maybe something beautiful will come of it.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a toxic relationship?</p>
<p>Or is there, does some of that movie resonate with you</p>
<p>as that sometimes is required to create art?</p>
<p>That kind of suffering.</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s suffering involved,</p>
<p>but not that kind of suffering.</p>
<p>Not for me.</p>
<p>There are some people who that&rsquo;s their process</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s whatever works.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no right answers for anything involved in art.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all trying experiments to find a way.</p>
<p>And even for the things that I work on,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a set way that I do anything.</p>
<p>I come to every project blank</p>
<p>and see,</p>
<p>I really listen to what the artist plays and says</p>
<p>and through what they explain they wanna do,</p>
<p>help find the best way to get there.</p>
<p>Was it implicit in the movie</p>
<p>that the mean teacher liked being a mean teacher?</p>
<p>You said the way you described it was</p>
<p>that he got off on treating people this way.</p>
<p>Do we know that to be the case?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember that in the movie.</p>
<p>No, but we sometimes project that onto people,</p>
<p>people who are really rough on students.</p>
<p>You start to think, well, maybe,</p>
<p>maybe that is fundamentally who they are</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s fundamentally who they are,</p>
<p>that there must be some pleasure in it</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s an addiction of some sort.</p>
<p>But it could be also a deliberate choice</p>
<p>made by the teacher.</p>
<p>It also could be a lineage.</p>
<p>Like in the Zen tradition,</p>
<p>there are sort of the mean Roshi&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who if you do something wrong, take a physical action.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just in the lineage,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s considered that&rsquo;s how you teach.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come from that lineage.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m much more of a,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s more of a collaboration</p>
<p>between people working together to make the best thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a boss slave relationship at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more of a let&rsquo;s find our way.</p>
<p>And we agree at the beginning of the process</p>
<p>that if either of us or any of us</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like what&rsquo;s happening, we say it.</p>
<p>And the goal is to keep working</p>
<p>till we get to a point where we&rsquo;re all really happy with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if we make something</p>
<p>that an artist likes and I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>or that I like and they don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t gone far enough.</p>
<p>In terms of lineage,</p>
<p>the ones that seek destruction</p>
<p>and the ones that seek happiness</p>
<p>all come from the same lineage.</p>
<p>We all came from fish.</p>
<p>So somewhere in you, deep down there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the other stuff too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that you haven&rsquo;t been yet, by the way,</p>
<p>because you said every new project,</p>
<p>including maybe starting today,</p>
<p>is an opportunity to channel, to plug into something</p>
<p>that was always there</p>
<p>and you haven&rsquo;t gotten a chance to plug into.</p>
<p>You mentioned listening.</p>
<p>How do you listen to a person?</p>
<p>How do you hear a person?</p>
<p>When you first come in, like we just met,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the analysis happening?</p>
<p>But I mean, with me is one thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an artist of sorts.</p>
<p>I program and I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m human, I guess.</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;re all creating art.</p>
<p>How do you see, like, how do I bring out?</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I mean, obviously everyone knows</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve produced some of the greatest records ever,</p>
<p>but the way I see that is you just brought out the best</p>
<p>in a lot of interesting artists.</p>
<p>And so in order to bring out the best in them,</p>
<p>you have to understand them.</p>
<p>You have to hear the music of their soul,</p>
<p>hopefully not being too romantic here,</p>
<p>but just like, is there something you can say</p>
<p>of how difficult that is, if there&rsquo;s a process,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s tricks, if it&rsquo;s luck?</p>
<p>I think it starts with this, again, coming in blank,</p>
<p>like not having any preconceived ideas,</p>
<p>being open and really listening,</p>
<p>listening and not thinking about what you&rsquo;re gonna say next</p>
<p>or what your opinion is or any, you know,</p>
<p>not basically being a recorder</p>
<p>and just hearing what comes in.</p>
<p>And then once you hear what comes in,</p>
<p>processing that information</p>
<p>and trying our best to do that</p>
<p>without any of the beliefs that we might have</p>
<p>to impact what that is.</p>
<p>If I ask you a question, I don&rsquo;t wanna hear what,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna listen to you</p>
<p>and have any reaction happening when you&rsquo;re speaking.</p>
<p>I wanna be as neutral as possible.</p>
<p>For me, my goal is not to form an opinion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to understand.</p>
<p>So if anything, I would draw you out further</p>
<p>and just ask questions to really understand.</p>
<p>And if you say, or if you say something</p>
<p>that somehow triggers me in a way that that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I wonder how he came to that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t challenge you, I would ask,</p>
<p>like, how did you find that?</p>
<p>You know, how did you get to that place?</p>
<p>From a place of curiosity, you would try to figure out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanna understand who the person is.</p>
<p>And through questioning, we can usually get there.</p>
<p>Or through just spending time together,</p>
<p>you find out who the person is.</p>
<p>What about finding out and figuring out</p>
<p>how to then take the next steps</p>
<p>of bringing out the best in them?</p>
<p>Like, is it just trial and error?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s try this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely trial and error.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always trial and error.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of making a mistake?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s add this instrument,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s remove this instrument.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add this line, let&rsquo;s remove this line.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be open.</p>
<p>So one of the, we don&rsquo;t really have rules,</p>
<p>but one of the agreements in the studio is</p>
<p>any idea that anyone has will always demonstrate it,</p>
<p>will always try it.</p>
<p>Because I can describe to you an idea</p>
<p>and you can think, that&rsquo;s a terrible idea,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not do that.</p>
<p>And then I can play you the idea</p>
<p>and then you can say, oh, that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s completely different because we,</p>
<p>when we hear, when we&rsquo;re told something,</p>
<p>we have to imagine what that is</p>
<p>and the way you see something and imagine it</p>
<p>and the way I see something and imagine it</p>
<p>are completely different.</p>
<p>So you say a thing and now there&rsquo;s two humans</p>
<p>that play that thing in their mind differently,</p>
<p>in their imagination, and then there&rsquo;s a cool creative step</p>
<p>and when you actually do it,</p>
<p>to see how it differs in the imagination,</p>
<p>and then the difference or the commonality</p>
<p>will be like an exciting little discovery together.</p>
<p>Well, so many groups of people</p>
<p>making things together in a room,</p>
<p>one person will suggest something</p>
<p>and someone else in the room say,</p>
<p>ah, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a good idea,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not do that, and then they move on.</p>
<p>The testing of every idea is really important</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how you get to see,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s not at all what I thought it was gonna be.</p>
<p>Happens to me all the time, I know,</p>
<p>because someone will suggest, why don&rsquo;t we do it like this?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll think, that sounds bad,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll think, okay, let&rsquo;s try it,</p>
<p>and then we hear it, and then eight times out of 10,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nothing like I imagined and great.</p>
<p>And then you try not to have an ego</p>
<p>about the fact that you thought</p>
<p>it was not a good idea in your head.</p>
<p>There can&rsquo;t be any ego in this.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, if everyone&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>with the purpose of making the best thing we can,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing else.</p>
<p>There are no, there can&rsquo;t be any boundaries to that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a moment I saw with,</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t love talking</p>
<p>about previous things you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s cool to dive in there every once in a while.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine to talk about anything.</p>
<p>To sample it, anything?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I have this pain I gotta talk now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll think of something ridiculous</p>
<p>that would make you change your mind.</p>
<p>You mentioned, I saw a video of you with Jay Z</p>
<p>at Workaround 99 Problems where you suggested acapella,</p>
<p>opening the song with acapella,</p>
<p>just no instruments, just voice.</p>
<p>That to me, I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the characteristics</p>
<p>of the things, of the ways you&rsquo;ve brought out</p>
<p>the best in artists is doing less.</p>
<p>Sort of the tending towards simplicity in some kind of way.</p>
<p>So that choice of acapella is really interesting</p>
<p>because I could see a lot of people think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a bad idea,</p>
<p>but it turned out to be a really powerful idea.</p>
<p>Can you maybe talk about the simplicity,</p>
<p>how to find simplicity, why you find simplicity is beautiful.</p>
<p>It does appear to be beautiful.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know where it comes from.</p>
<p>It has been with me from the beginning of my work,</p>
<p>the very first album I ever produced,</p>
<p>the credit I took was reduced by me</p>
<p>instead of produced by me for that reason.</p>
<p>I like the idea of getting to the essential</p>
<p>and I have a better idea now that I&rsquo;ve done it for a while,</p>
<p>but at the time it was purely an instinctual thing.</p>
<p>And part of it is a sonic, there&rsquo;s a sonic benefit,</p>
<p>which is the less elements you have, you can hear each</p>
<p>of the ones that are there and they can sound better.</p>
<p>And the less there are, the more space they could have</p>
<p>around them and the more you can hear their personality.</p>
<p>If you were to record 10 people playing the same guitar part</p>
<p>and you listened to it, it would sound like guitar.</p>
<p>And if you record one person playing a guitar part,</p>
<p>it sounds like a person playing the guitar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different than just guitar.</p>
<p>And often in the studio, the idea of building upon things</p>
<p>and adding layers to thicken, to make it sound bigger,</p>
<p>sometimes the more things you add, the smaller it gets.</p>
<p>So a lot of it is counterintuitive</p>
<p>until you just in practice see what works.</p>
<p>Try it, to try removing stuff until it&rsquo;s just right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Einstein thing, make it as simple as possible,</p>
<p>but not simpler.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a, like finding a stopping place,</p>
<p>just keep chopping away and chopping away.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something we also like to do</p>
<p>called the ruthless edit, which is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re at a point where it can work for anything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll give you the example with an album.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recorded 25 songs.</p>
<p>We think the album is gonna have 10.</p>
<p>Instead of picking our favorite 10,</p>
<p>we limit it to what are the five or six</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t live without.</p>
<p>So going past even the goal to get to the real heart of it</p>
<p>and then see, okay, we have these five or six</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t live without.</p>
<p>Now, what would we add to that</p>
<p>that makes it better and not worse?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it puts you in a different frame</p>
<p>when you start with building instead of removing.</p>
<p>And you might find that there&rsquo;s nothing you need to add.</p>
<p>Sometimes, sometimes something happens</p>
<p>when you get to the real essence.</p>
<p>Then when you start adding things back,</p>
<p>it becomes clear that it was just supposed to be</p>
<p>this tight little thing.</p>
<p>Can I ask you like a therapy session question?</p>
<p>So you mentioned somewhere that one way</p>
<p>to kind of think about music to get into music</p>
<p>is to look at the top like 100 albums of all time</p>
<p>and just go down the list and like,</p>
<p>just take it all in like one piece of artwork.</p>
<p>So I was doing that for a while.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cool experiment,</p>
<p>because unfortunately I have to admit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten lazy and stopped taking in albums as albums.</p>
<p>And I looked at one interesting top 100 list,</p>
<p>top 500 actually, which is put together by Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>And they put, this is the therapy session part,</p>
<p>and this has to do with simplicity too.</p>
<p>They put Marvin Gaye&rsquo;s What&rsquo;s Going On at number one.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to maybe get your opinion on that choice.</p>
<p>The reason that Marvin Gaye is really interesting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d actually be cool to play What&rsquo;s Going On in a second,</p>
<p>but when you just listen to his like acapella,</p>
<p>just listen to his voice, it is really good.</p>
<p>Like people, it makes me wonder if it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to pull off like most of his songs with no instruments.</p>
<p>Like in many parts, there&rsquo;s so much soul</p>
<p>in just Mercy, Mercy, Me, What&rsquo;s Going On.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many songs that you could just be like,</p>
<p>I wonder if you could just like, just go raw,</p>
<p>or maybe in parts, or maybe do what you do with Jay Z,</p>
<p>just open up with nothing.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s something so powerful</p>
<p>to a great soulful voice.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I play it real quick?</p>
<p>No, please.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>This is probably one of my favorite songs.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s up there.</p>
<p>Hey, what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up, brother?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>Hey, how you doing?</p>
<p>Hey man.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Hey man.</p>
<p>Mother, mother,</p>
<p>That voice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many of you to cry.</p>
<p>Brother, brother, brother.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s far too many of you to die.</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some just very subtle backing vocals</p>
<p>this one hurts</p>
<p>father father we don&rsquo;t need to escalate</p>
<p>i wonder who the father he&rsquo;s talking about is</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s interesting i mean i have so for people who don&rsquo;t know his his own father ended up</p>
<p>uh killing marvin gay yeah i mean that one is really pain i mean for a lot of people your</p>
<p>relationship with your father your mother i mean there&rsquo;s different dynamics but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like part of life is resolving some kind of complex puzzle you have</p>
<p>or the people you love the people close to you or the people who are not there all those kinds</p>
<p>of things that&rsquo;s so much pain in that we don&rsquo;t need to escalate father father i never thought</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s i always thought it&rsquo;s his father directly yeah i don&rsquo;t get that it could be but i don&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>feel like it&rsquo;s a more um masculine spirituality like a father figure or just broadly some kind</p>
<p>of spirituality could be like god father god mother god you know like could be i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so much it&rsquo;s like both hope and melancholy you seeing war is not the answer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you you don&rsquo;t tell your father war is not your your blood father war is not the answer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s strange conversation it&rsquo;s a bigger conversation they&rsquo;re not personal don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think it feels like war if one is personal what&rsquo;s the difference between is the war is personal too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only leaders think about war in a geopolitical sense yeah when people that fight wars you lose</p>
<p>your brothers you lose i mean you death is just right there so it might feel just like that but</p>
<p>yeah there is a dance between like the personal and like talking to the entirety of the society</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like john lennon imagine like also a song where is that is that a hopeful is that cynical</p>
<p>is it like melancholy like heartbroken like you you hope you wish things would be a certain way</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not yeah i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know john lennon is giving up on the world in imagine</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know you know it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s an interesting question there&rsquo;s another uh</p>
<p>john lennon lyric um in let me think of what it is take me a second</p>
<p>and different songs keep coming into my head the one that i&rsquo;m looking and you keep pressing next</p>
<p>um across the universe um nothing&rsquo;s going to change my world and when i hear that</p>
<p>i hear it as hopeless but i don&rsquo;t think i don&rsquo;t believe that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well it may be how he meant it but i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s normally taken</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also the taker is important i&rsquo;m generally optimistic and hopeful so i i always like look for</p>
<p>the hope and the actually the harshest love uh heartbreak songs are always somehow hopeful to me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a love song uh to me like a song about losing love is is a song about the great capacity</p>
<p>for love in the human heart that&rsquo;s what i hear so to me losing love is exciting because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that means you really cared that means you felt something you feel something you can sit in</p>
<p>that pain and that pain is a reminder what it means to be human when you&rsquo;re that um what is it uh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just listening uh the only man who could have reached me was the son of a preacher man</p>
<p>so see um it&rsquo;s like that early love or something or partially sexual or whatever that&rsquo;s not as</p>
<p>interesting to me it&rsquo;s fun it&rsquo;s great but it&rsquo;s not as interesting to me as it is to me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun it&rsquo;s great but it&rsquo;s that heartbreak that&rsquo;s the reminder that it can go deep</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a damn good song have you ever heard the uh detroit mix of the marvin gay album</p>
<p>no call it up how by far better mind blowing i just heard it recently blew my mind</p>
<p>oh wow reverb distant</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s far too many of you</p>
<p>it feels like it&rsquo;s all around the room more</p>
<p>to bring some loving here today</p>
<p>more voices more voices</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s layering his own vocals</p>
<p>just like there&rsquo;s multiple people singing</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t punish me with brutality talk to me so you can see oh what&rsquo;s going on that&rsquo;s beautiful yeah</p>
<p>seems to have more energy if you if you listen to the whole album even even though you just said</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t listen albums anymore the detroit mix of the whole album changes the album a lot</p>
<p>i mean that that felt uh so that&rsquo;s the opposite of a cappella i would say yes because it&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s um there&rsquo;s layers there&rsquo;s um and that maybe i don&rsquo;t know if you remember but</p>
<p>if memory serves me uh correct here he produces this own album here marvin gay was the producer</p>
<p>on this i believe i believe so and this one sounds more like it&rsquo;s a get together and the</p>
<p>whole album sounds more like a get together where it&rsquo;s a group of people in a room playing music</p>
<p>together whereas the album version sounds more like an out like a recording this sounds less</p>
<p>like a recording and a little more like a party now you had a series of conversations with paul</p>
<p>mccartney which is amazing that people should should watch but is is there this is continuing</p>
<p>our therapy session is there a case to be made that uh what&rsquo;s going on is number one album above</p>
<p>the beatles uh white album or abbey road above pet sounds can you still manage case there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a case i mean there&rsquo;s always a case every there&rsquo;s no uh in reality in art there is no</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s no metric that makes sense so um you could put numbers on things but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>is this apple better than this peach like it&rsquo;s not really a fair comparison but if you just had</p>
<p>to keep one to represent the human species that&rsquo;s the way i think to the aliens so i think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very personal decision i don&rsquo;t i think you can make you can make your choice to represent the</p>
<p>human species and i&rsquo;ll make mine you know well i would pick the beatles over the beach boys so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my if i became dictator of the world i was talking to the aliens but i do think that</p>
<p>aliens but i don&rsquo;t know the full historical context to the impact of the music i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if that&rsquo;s something to consider like this kind of thought experiment of imagine what it was</p>
<p>like back then to create to go into the studio to do such interesting work in the studio</p>
<p>as opposed to like listening to just as a pop song almost from because i&rsquo;ve never been able</p>
<p>to understand uh beach boys god only knows the song god only knows god only knows but all of</p>
<p>it the album the pet sounds just in my room was uh in my room that&rsquo;s all um is that what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>favorite on the album that sounds album that sounds um the opening track do you mind if i</p>
<p>play it please it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s too fun that&rsquo;s part of their trip though the you uh you open</p>
<p>the heart with the fun it&rsquo;s possible original mono and stereo mix versions i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the opening song wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice yeah that&rsquo;s the song</p>
<p>we could say good night and stay together wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice</p>
<p>wake up together but we&rsquo;re not there&rsquo;s heartbreak in this one too</p>
<p>still to me like george harris like um uh is that the way that album while my guitar gently weeps</p>
<p>i mean that um with the beatles it&rsquo;s so hard to depending on the day i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll say a very different</p>
<p>song that&rsquo;s my favorite song but i often return to while my guitar gently weeps is my favorite song</p>
<p>spectacular spectacular anything george harrison honestly something something in the way she moves</p>
<p>the bet i what would you classify that there&rsquo;s like several beatle songs categories of beatles</p>
<p>categories of beatles songs so that&rsquo;s like the melancholy love songs or ballads or something like</p>
<p>that um yesterday let it be what&rsquo;s do you have favorites so from your like how have you changed</p>
<p>as a man as a human being as a musician and music producer ever having done that lengthy interaction</p>
<p>with with mccartney hmm anytime you&rsquo;re around someone who&rsquo;s such a hero and you spend time</p>
<p>with them and they&rsquo;re a human being it helps put perspective on everything you know that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just human that well obviously i mean every everyone&rsquo;s just human and um but i remember</p>
<p>the first time i got to see paul mccartney play live it was in a stadium of 70 000 people</p>
<p>and he started playing and i started crying and i couldn&rsquo;t believe i was in even with 70 000 people</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t believe i that this man walks the earth and that i&rsquo;m in the same place as him</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s the person who wrote that and played that and now he&rsquo;s here playing it for us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mind blowing that&rsquo;s the voice that&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s overwhelming is it inspiring or is it um</p>
<p>like because sometimes when you have and i&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to me i mean i love people in</p>
<p>general like every every person is fascinating to me but yeah when you&rsquo;ve been a fan for a long time</p>
<p>and you meet a person uh sort of uh i&rsquo;ll just remove present company is you um it&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just human so there&rsquo;s both it&rsquo;s both inspiring that just a simple human can achieve</p>
<p>such beautiful things but it&rsquo;s also like almost wishing there were gods moving in around us it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somehow peaceful this is it&rsquo;s more uh comforting to know that there&rsquo;s you know uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s bigger fish i&rsquo;m just a small fish and then there&rsquo;s bigger fish and it will take care</p>
<p>of the ocean for us i think we&rsquo;re all capable of being big fish i don&rsquo;t think that there are</p>
<p>special people i don&rsquo;t think it it&rsquo;s like that i i would make a case so the variety</p>
<p>of artists that you worked with and brought the best out of it does seem the year out of this</p>
<p>world so do you think you would know like if you&rsquo;re the same kind of species maybe you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just a meat vehicle and you&rsquo;re channeling ideas from somewhere else i feel like i&rsquo;m channeling</p>
<p>ideas from somewhere else 100 but i think have you asked questions about where from i believe</p>
<p>we i believe we all are though you know i believe we are um we&rsquo;re vehicles for information that when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ready to come through it comes through and the people who have good antennas pick up the</p>
<p>signal but um if i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve had an experience in your life where you&rsquo;ve had an idea for something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve not acted on it and eventually someone else does it and it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re doing it because you had the idea and they stole your idea it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>the time has come for that idea and if you don&rsquo;t do it someone else is going to it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being broadcast by whatever the source whatever the source is uh yeah i tend to</p>
<p>i tend to see humans as not quite special in that way yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s different kinds of antennas</p>
<p>walking around listening to ideas and ideas that are i like the the notion of uh richard dawkins of memes</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s kind of the ideas of the organisms and they&rsquo;re just using our brains to multiply to</p>
<p>to select to compete to to evolve and humans we really want to hold on to the</p>
<p>specialness of our body of our mind but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really the ideas so for a group when was born</p>
<p>two centuries ago you wouldn&rsquo;t be a music producer you&rsquo;d be or i mean maybe but you have an antenna</p>
<p>and if no signal is coming in uh or you&rsquo;d be hearing a potentially a different signal</p>
<p>is there um i think we all have our own antenna for whatever it is that we you know maybe not</p>
<p>everyone has tuned into their antenna to see what it is that their strength and bringing through is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m lucky in that it found me because i didn&rsquo;t know that it was a i didn&rsquo;t even know this was a job</p>
<p>i sometimes wonder i mean a lot of young people a lot of people wonder like what&rsquo;s the purpose</p>
<p>and the the specs of my antenna what am i put on this earth to do like if um you know i i</p>
<p>can live a thousand lives there&rsquo;s so many trajectories and imagine the greatest possible</p>
<p>trajectory that reveals the the most beautiful thing i can possibly create in this world live</p>
<p>the most beautiful way uh what is that i feel like that&rsquo;s a good exercise to think about</p>
<p>um because it&rsquo;s also liberating to think that you can do anything i mean that</p>
<p>um more and more i suppose that&rsquo;s kind of life it&rsquo;s like society is pushing conformity on you</p>
<p>you know i thought i i had my own flavor of conformity i thought i&rsquo;m supposed to be following</p>
<p>and then early on i would say like in the late 20s you realize wait a minute you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>tell you don&rsquo;t have to do what teachers tell you to do what parents tell you to do what</p>
<p>society tells you do you can like um i would never wear a suit if i listened to like my colleagues</p>
<p>and community who think a suit is like the symbol of uh what is it a symbol of conformity actually</p>
<p>which is hilarious but uh it&rsquo;s actually a kind of rebellion and everything else like of that nature</p>
<p>doing doing these silly podcasts like um i have a question i have to ask sure because you brought</p>
<p>up the suit yeah uh do you wear the suit is this your daily uniform outside of podcasting so uh for</p>
<p>the longest time it was some kind of suit and then recently i mean coinciding with going to texas</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a i&rsquo;m such a loner i&rsquo;m an introvert and there&rsquo;s a bit of a hiding from the world when i</p>
<p>wear other stuff i really want to um to not make fame recognition</p>
<p>money all those things a motivation at all and the world kind of wants you to make those motivations</p>
<p>not not the world but i would say maybe the western world and maybe america maybe a capitalist system</p>
<p>does but that&rsquo;s a choice to buy into that or not right it takes a brave person a person of character</p>
<p>to not buy in and i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m like a like a baby deer trying to find his legs you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>buy in because i love people and i think i&rsquo;m kind of an idiot and so when other people</p>
<p>say do this and do that it uh there&rsquo;s a there is a pressure there it&rsquo;s actually very difficult to</p>
<p>not listen necessarily to the advice of others and yet keep yourself fragile and open to the world</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to be like i&rsquo;m always right you know just kind of sticking a ground but if you want</p>
<p>to be like vulnerable if you want to connect with people and just wear your heart on your sleeve</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to listen to them i mean that&rsquo;s the double edged sword of it and uh but then again</p>
<p>that pain like if you don&rsquo;t let it destroy you can grow grow from that has fame affected you at all</p>
<p>did you unplug from the system at some point same i&rsquo;ve always been sort of removed i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel like i&rsquo;m part of any system do you feel famous um i&rsquo;m aware that when i go out people</p>
<p>will you know say nice things to me which is great but that&rsquo;s about it that&rsquo;s about as far as</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t affect your art about your creativity or your thoughts like when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting alone and thinking about the world it can&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s a destructive force the the thing</p>
<p>the reason that you&rsquo;re who you are and the reason that you&rsquo;re finding the success you&rsquo;re finding</p>
<p>is because you&rsquo;ve been true to yourself to get to that stage so to start changing that</p>
<p>to conform to either conform to someone else&rsquo;s idea what you should be doing</p>
<p>it just seems like uh it doesn&rsquo;t make sense do you have a sense of who you are because i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily have a i don&rsquo;t know i i know that i really like making good things and i know that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>um crazy about it in that um it&rsquo;s like an obsession and i want things to be as good as</p>
<p>they could be whatever it is and if i&rsquo;m if i finish a music project and i have a window of</p>
<p>time where i&rsquo;m not working on music i might be moving the furniture around in the house you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always looking for a prod a creative outlet to find a way to make something better or there</p>
<p>was a period of time where i was in a weird corporate situation that was uh</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t allow me to flourish and i turned i focused the creativity and on myself and i</p>
<p>lost a bunch of weight and changed my life and so that was the kind of art like the you&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>through a whole process of losing weight getting in shape getting healthy that was a kind of creative</p>
<p>act it certainly was it wasn&rsquo;t an intentional creative act but i had a lot of energy and i just</p>
<p>a series of events happened i read a book at the time that was my heaviest i weighed about 318</p>
<p>pounds yeah and i&rsquo;d never been i&rsquo;d been sedentary my whole life basically laying on a couch working</p>
<p>on music so i&rsquo;ve never been physically active in my life and i read a book about a guy named stew</p>
<p>middleman a runner who ran a thousand miles in 11 days and i thought wow i you know get out of</p>
<p>breath walking to the corner and another human being can run a thousand miles in 11 days i feel</p>
<p>like i have bad information you know i&rsquo;m doing clearly i&rsquo;m doing something wrong and um and i</p>
<p>reached out to a person that stew mentioned in the book phil maffatone who&rsquo;s a legend i i really</p>
<p>appreciate him as well he&rsquo;s math 180 method too he&rsquo;s such an interesting i think he focuses on</p>
<p>heart rate uh training and he was the first person to talk about um essentially a</p>
<p>low carbs paleo yeah keto diet 40 40 years ago for a person who&rsquo;s going to be healthy who can</p>
<p>exercise and actually perform at an early level he&rsquo;s the first person when i um you know talked</p>
<p>about heart rate training him and other endurance athletes he influenced he gave me permission to</p>
<p>like run slower yeah it&rsquo;s the first time i realized oh i can run long distances if i just</p>
<p>run slower and then take that seriously and i actually fell in love with running very much so</p>
<p>because for me everyone&rsquo;s different but for me the love of running happens in the longer distances</p>
<p>yeah did you read born to run great book amazing book there is something special about running</p>
<p>and everybody has their own their own journey with it and even ultra marathon running those</p>
<p>kinds of things it&rsquo;s a it is like many journeys one that can pull you in like you won&rsquo;t be the</p>
<p>same person after and i i try to be deliberate about making deliberate about making choices</p>
<p>after which you&rsquo;ll not be the same person and so i&rsquo;m nervous about like the ultra marathon running</p>
<p>world i have to talk to you about johnny cash i mean when people ask me what my</p>
<p>favorite musical thing is of all time i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a very difficult question to answer of course but i&rsquo;m pretty quick</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m not allowed to pick anything by tom ways i&rsquo;m pretty quick to say hurt by johnny cash</p>
<p>the performance the whatever you call it whatever the heck that is because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just a song covered by an artist that&rsquo;s a human being at the end of their life</p>
<p>that the rawness of that the i mean just the there&rsquo;s also a music video which for a lot of</p>
<p>people adds a lot to it uh for me just the music alone is i mean the guitar every choice on that</p>
<p>see the the few things i&rsquo;ve heard about it it seemed like almost accidental i mean like little</p>
<p>subtle choices here and there can you maybe comment on that um to to the degree i i think</p>
<p>you had a huge role in sort of bringing johnny cash back from from a different part of his life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like bringing something out that wasn&rsquo;t there before and it was it was it was incredible</p>
<p>it was a celebration of a really special musician and a totally new kind of celebration now hurt is</p>
<p>just one of the songs that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s an amazing celebration of johnny cash but hurt is</p>
<p>like at the at the at the peak of that so what was that like putting that song together okay maybe</p>
<p>maybe uh it might be nice to listen to it because i freaking love that song and as a guitarist</p>
<p>i just the simplicity of it uh it seems like every choice contributes to the greatness of the song</p>
<p>simple it&rsquo;s crisp but it&rsquo;s dark too</p>
<p>i hurt myself today it&rsquo;s one of the greatest opening lines of any song</p>
<p>to see if i still feel yeah i&rsquo;m talking about the lyrics i don&rsquo;t even mean the performance the words</p>
<p>but those words out of Trent Reznor are not the same they have a different meaning</p>
<p>coming out of johnny cash&rsquo;s mouth</p>
<p>try to kill it all away but i remember everything</p>
<p>what have i become what have i become my sweetest friend</p>
<p>written probably for a young man i think he was 20 when he wrote it</p>
<p>the way the guitarist played the choice of instrument the layers there</p>
<p>the uh the freedom to give him to use the voice that&rsquo;s um fading it&rsquo;s not fading it&rsquo;s changing</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s losing some aspects of his voice and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost like shaking a little bit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little bit out of tune in parts</p>
<p>uh how much of that was deliberate how much was like how do you give johnny castor freedom to</p>
<p>to do that how do you find that together is there any insights you can give i think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>case almost of like the right pairing the right role with the right actor you could say the the</p>
<p>song lyrics that the reason we chose the song was because the lyrics purely about the lyrics</p>
<p>and at that point in time both johnny and i would send each other songs of possible</p>
<p>ideas to record and um that was one that i sent him and he didn&rsquo;t respond to initially i sent i</p>
<p>would send him see at that time we would burn cds and i would send him like cd of 20 songs or 25</p>
<p>songs and then and he would send them to me he burned a cd for johnny cash and you sent him</p>
<p>uh of different songs of like songs to consider recording yeah um and we would send these back</p>
<p>and forth and then that i had hurt on one of the ones that i sent him and he didn&rsquo;t respond and</p>
<p>usually if he didn&rsquo;t respond we didn&rsquo;t go back to it you know and that one i remember i sent it</p>
<p>again and i put it first on the next on the next cd and um and when when we spoke about when he</p>
<p>listened to cd again he didn&rsquo;t respond i said check out that first song and i really feel like that one</p>
<p>could be good what did you see in that song it&rsquo;s the lyrics it&rsquo;s the lyrics because i feel like</p>
<p>nobody there&rsquo;s very few people in the world that would see these lyrics in johnny cash&rsquo;s mouth and</p>
<p>think this is a good idea including for president yeah i know that trant was trant had trepidations</p>
<p>in the evening um but if you listen to the words if you forget the music and if you get what if</p>
<p>you forget what nine ish nail sounds like and you just read it like a poem and then you imagine</p>
<p>a 70 year old man reading these lyrics it&rsquo;ll be it&rsquo;ll be profound it&rsquo;s profound so that was the</p>
<p>based on lyrics that started the journey and then at this point in time johnny was not in great</p>
<p>health and uh sometimes i would go to nashville and record with him at his house sometimes he</p>
<p>would come to california but he was coming to california less regularly and because there was</p>
<p>there were so many songs we wanted to try he would start sometimes recording just a straight</p>
<p>acoustic version like you&rsquo;d have someone play guitar he would sing and they would send those</p>
<p>to me and we would discuss like is this one to build on um and that was when we said i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to record this one until we&rsquo;re together i feel like we should do this one together</p>
<p>so on the next trip to california we recorded it at my at my old house</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i mean all the songs we recorded felt special so i can&rsquo;t say this one felt special</p>
<p>but lyrically it just it&rsquo;s more the the lyrics have such a profound</p>
<p>sense of regret what have i become yeah and to hear when you&rsquo;re 20 years old talking about regret</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s heartbreaking but it&rsquo;s heartbreaking in a different way because you have your whole</p>
<p>life to figure it out when you&rsquo;re looking back over your life at the end of your life with regret</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s brutal yeah it&rsquo;s brutal so that was the initial spark of doing it and then we when we</p>
<p>recorded it i believe it was um two guitar players if i remember correctly maybe even three um smoky</p>
<p>hormel matt sweeney and mike campbell i believe and ben montench was playing the piano in my living</p>
<p>room as we were doing it and we cut the basic track and with johnny singing and then johnny</p>
<p>probably sang over that basic track a few more times and then we comped his vocal and then</p>
<p>built up the drama and you didn&rsquo;t get to the part but at the end of the song it gets very loud the</p>
<p>music gets very loud it&rsquo;s subtle because it&rsquo;s not anything that takes your ear and the vocal is so</p>
<p>powerful that you don&rsquo;t really think about what&rsquo;s going on but it&rsquo;s building the whole time it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>building and it even gets distorted at the end it gets really uh like over overpowering and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>part of the emotion of it you know it&rsquo;s uh i hear almost anger and frustration</p>
<p>and it just rings out the clean vocal i mean it&rsquo;s so simple so incredible and it&rsquo;s interesting to</p>
<p>have a young man&rsquo;s lyrics in in an old johnny cash voice and heart and mind i had um are you</p>
<p>a fan of tom waits of course uh tom waits when he was younger had his this is a song called martha</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a bunch of songs he&rsquo;s written when he was young it&rsquo;s like how does a young man</p>
<p>have that like melancholy wisdom the song martha is about uh an older man calling a woman he used</p>
<p>to love that she&rsquo;s now married and he&rsquo;s married and they&rsquo;re having that conversation they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spoken for 30 years and they realize that there&rsquo;s still love there and it could have been a different</p>
<p>life a different world where they could have been together and here&rsquo;s like a 23 year old tom waits</p>
<p>writing so beautifully about something that&rsquo;s very uh i&rsquo;ve had a lot of people like tell me how</p>
<p>real that uh as an older person looking back at that love that you had and realizing it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it was really it&rsquo;s still there inklings of that love are still there i think there&rsquo;s a um</p>
<p>when a young person writes a sad song</p>
<p>they almost seem more willing to go to a more hopeless place</p>
<p>because they have they have a so much time ahead and older artists tend to want to look at the</p>
<p>bright side of things which which also i think comes from the wisdom of aging it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a more</p>
<p>realistic position so it&rsquo;s not uncommon for younger people to write i think even in the</p>
<p>beatles you&rsquo;ll see like they&rsquo;re very heavy lyrics um middle to late era beatles which is still you</p>
<p>know they&rsquo;re in their 20s you know early 20s i guess wow that&rsquo;s hard to think about so much</p>
<p>accomplished unbelievable and they they went through the full journey from fun to darkness</p>
<p>in the span of a few years uh you mentioned lyrics um so you&rsquo;ve obviously produced</p>
<p>albums with incredible lyrics i think you&rsquo;ve mentioned the interesting characteristics of</p>
<p>hip hop of rap is that you&rsquo;re writing poetry to rhythm versus writing poetry to melody so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like one way to think about it and i&rsquo;m a fan i mean tom waits let it go i&rsquo;m a fan of</p>
<p>poetry period is there something um about highlighting the poetry of it the power of</p>
<p>words as you did with with heart if uh like if i have to play it again it&rsquo;s one uh a tom waits song</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like less than a minute long that i always go back to it&rsquo;s one i really love and</p>
<p>has just a few lines it&rsquo;s called i want you and all it is is him saying i want you</p>
<p>i want you this is a 22 year old Tom Waits</p>
<p>all i want is you</p>
<p>give you stars above</p>
<p>the sun on the brightest day</p>
<p>giving you all my love</p>
<p>if only you would see that i want you you you</p>
<p>you all i want is you you you and then he hums for 20 more seconds beautiful so so</p>
<p>simple man that young man like low and but for people who don&rsquo;t know tom waits you should</p>
<p>definitely listen to him and his voice sounds very different now and it&rsquo;s interesting to see</p>
<p>the evolution of a human voice the the artist over time because that&rsquo;s a young like boy like voice</p>
<p>hopeful less clever less witty more simple that simplicity is there and he&rsquo;s not i mean that</p>
<p>takes guts to be so simple i would say lyrically and uh musically is there um sort of laying that</p>
<p>out on the table is there ways to that you like to highlight the voice the lyrics or there&rsquo;s no one</p>
<p>rule so do you what is the thing that makes music special is it the rhythm the melody the</p>
<p>uh or is ultimately the lyrics are always there or the idea you just asked me five different</p>
<p>questions i don&rsquo;t care i&rsquo;ll just get that it&rsquo;s not about you you don&rsquo;t want the answers i&rsquo;ll listen</p>
<p>uh i look forward to your comments the internet okay uh you have the greatest producer of all</p>
<p>time in front of you and you can&rsquo;t shut the hell up that&rsquo;s right friends uh is but you do value</p>
<p>lyrics is there a way to celebrate lyrics i value lyrics if the lyrics are important i&rsquo;m not a lyric</p>
<p>person i&rsquo;m very much uh whatever the thing that makes the thing good is the thing that i&rsquo;m drawn</p>
<p>to for me um for a long time lyrics meant very little i would say from me really yes yes from</p>
<p>the earliest days for your right to party beastie boys yeah it was it was fun i thought they were</p>
<p>good lyrics but it wasn&rsquo;t what was important i mean it was in a in a almost a novelty way</p>
<p>not in a serious way early in my career i was much more focused on the rhythm first the rhythm</p>
<p>and i would if the lyrics weren&rsquo;t good enough i would be aware of it but it wasn&rsquo;t the driving</p>
<p>force for me and eventually over time then melody became an important piece which it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t in the beginning and then uh lyrics became more important over time but it&rsquo;s always been a</p>
<p>always changing what what draws me in and one of the things i found as it relates to lyrics that</p>
<p>that can give a lyric a different power has to do with rhythm where if there&rsquo;s no drum</p>
<p>um the lyrics tend to mean more</p>
<p>so earlier what you were saying about if it was just acapella</p>
<p>you felt you felt marvin gay in a different way hearing the acapella</p>
<p>can you comment on i mean in terms of one of the greatest albums ever why does it sound so raw</p>
<p>her voice she&rsquo;s just a great singer but this is that you&rsquo;re not doing anything else you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>the uh there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s strumming and then there&rsquo;s just a single beat</p>
<p>and then it builds</p>
<p>starting in my heart</p>
<p>this gets simpler but it feels like it&rsquo;s a giant orchestra</p>
<p>we almost had it all the scars of your love they leave me breathless i can&rsquo;t help feeling</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s backing vocals</p>
<p>the anger i love it</p>
<p>i just there&rsquo;s something about uh such a powerful voice and the instruments not getting in the way</p>
<p>i mean the same with the with hurt and johnny cash it is there um why does it sound so</p>
<p>like raw it&rsquo;s the same as hurt there&rsquo;s a it feels like you&rsquo;re in the room with them it feels like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not even singing they&rsquo;re like uh they&rsquo;re literally freshly mad and angry i think those are</p>
<p>the things that make great singers sound like great singers it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not anything that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in the studio i mean we&rsquo;re i would say the only thing that us in the studio</p>
<p>can do is kind of get out of the way and not not ruin it you know it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what comes through of these these people i should also before i forget there is a lot of song choices</p>
<p>on that cd i would love to see the full options on the cd that you sent to johnny cash that i love</p>
<p>so solitary man is one of my favorite choices made there uh is it is that a neil damon song</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny you talk about them as songs because i tend to i tend to listen more to albums than</p>
<p>songs so if you really you&rsquo;re that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing your head you&rsquo;re pulling up the album</p>
<p>essentially no i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m going to that song but i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;ve never listened to that song</p>
<p>but i know that when that when that song comes up in the sequence of the album</p>
<p>um it has a really powerful effect in me let&rsquo;s see what it does if you just started</p>
<p>if you could read my so interesting wow</p>
<p>i could tell just like an old time movie about a ghost from a wishing well in a castle dark</p>
<p>or a fortress strong with chains around my feet you know that ghost is me</p>
<p>and i will never be set free as long as there&rsquo;s a ghost that you can see</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beautiful such a beautiful choice beautiful melody such a beautiful melody</p>
<p>and haunting words sung so simply i i have to um i mean so uh i was born in the soviet union</p>
<p>when when you when you&rsquo;re growing up uh there&rsquo;s a few bands that kind of i mean they&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>forbidden still but they seep in and you get like uh bootlegged and and they somehow take over the</p>
<p>culture of the young of the young folk such as myself so uh on the metal side it was metallica</p>
<p>and iron maiden and uh on the i don&rsquo;t know what you call them but beastie boys i remember hearing</p>
<p>uh fight for your right and it was just like for some reason that stuck as it did for a lot of</p>
<p>people in russia it&rsquo;s like wow america is when you get to say fuck you to the man the rebellion the</p>
<p>freedom um i probably heard it uh a few years after it was released because it kind of it</p>
<p>dissipates to the culture you get the bootlegged i mean it&rsquo;s hard to get your hands on but i just</p>
<p>remember me i i wanted to kind of bring that up because it was such a personally important song</p>
<p>to me and yet probably you didn&rsquo;t even think of that you probably thought of it as its role in</p>
<p>the culture here in the united states like in terms of musically but i was you know 20 21 years old</p>
<p>and we just well you were that kid too right we&rsquo;re just making fun songs for our friends there was</p>
<p>no there was no uh expectation that&rsquo;s just a fun song yeah no one thought we never imagined anybody</p>
<p>would like any of it one of the greatest albums ever yeah i have to it&rsquo;s i love this so much i</p>
<p>just remember this is america i didn&rsquo;t even know i didn&rsquo;t even understand the lyrics to be honest</p>
<p>and the lyrics are ridiculous</p>
<p>so hearing that and hearing metallica master puppets i was like i knew i&rsquo;m gonna have to end</p>
<p>up in america one day i mean maybe now that i&rsquo;m more mature or maybe a little bit more mature i</p>
<p>realized like that was kind of the longing for freedom it felt like at least at the time if this</p>
<p>is allowed that anything is allowed yeah and i think that uh the rebellion of it the uh is i</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s also fun i just i just loved it is there if you look back to that because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re uh uh i mean you were that person not just the producer it feels like yes and no like it was</p>
<p>even to us then it was still like satirical you know it wasn&rsquo;t oh absolutely but isn&rsquo;t like music</p>
<p>in part like you&rsquo;re dancing in the line is part satirical part serious in in the sense like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>losing yourself in the satire like when you have anytime you go over the top isn&rsquo;t that part of the</p>
<p>or is this is it explicitly satirical you make it fun i mean girls there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>ridiculous songs in that album i don&rsquo;t know i just think it&rsquo;s it was definitely to make each</p>
<p>other laugh like we were trying to make each other laugh we weren&rsquo;t trying to make a point we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to make each other laugh but that person how&rsquo;s that person different than the person today</p>
<p>in you the the person that produced that i wouldn&rsquo;t say so different it&rsquo;s like it really is</p>
<p>that that um i like things that make me laugh you know i like ridiculous things it&rsquo;s the same person</p>
<p>still i think so that is a strange just how many incredible i mean i wouldn&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t think i would</p>
<p>make that today but i understand why we made it when we did it&rsquo;s uh in the vocabulary of of um</p>
<p>ridiculous that would make sense to do you know for the right artist today could make something</p>
<p>ridiculous and gives you that feeling i mean there&rsquo;s just a sense when you make so many</p>
<p>many different albums then you look back at that creation and it can feel like a different person</p>
<p>created that but you&rsquo;re making it seem like if you travel back in time or maybe do a memory replay</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to hang out with the with a teenage and the 20s recruitment i think yeah i i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i was so different honestly that&rsquo;s hilarious it&rsquo;s funny i ran into someone um recently</p>
<p>in costa rica who i hadn&rsquo;t seen in a long time and who i knew from the new york days when</p>
<p>those days and um and we spent a couple of hours talking and she said you&rsquo;re exactly</p>
<p>the same person that you were then so i have a short you know a recent confirmation that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the case that&rsquo;s beautiful was it tim ferris asked you about like who&rsquo;s the most successful person</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the definition of success i would say it&rsquo;s exactly the same person you haven&rsquo;t lost</p>
<p>yourself and or rather you found yourself early on i would say there there are aspects of me that</p>
<p>have changed for sure um but i but i can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s necessarily better it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different um at that i would say at that time i was more confident than i am now and i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>confident now but then i had an unrealistic um confidence and i think now it&rsquo;s a little more</p>
<p>um based in reality at that point in time i had never been depressed and then once you go through</p>
<p>a depression you well some people i know in my case and when i went through depression afterwards</p>
<p>i was a different person than i was before and i and i feel more um grounded now than i did then</p>
<p>and i probably relate to the artists who so many of the artists i work with suffer so many artists</p>
<p>suffer because that&rsquo;s part of what makes an artist great is their level of sensitivity</p>
<p>that this the same thing that makes uh an artist uncomfortable other people don&rsquo;t feel at all</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t feel at all the time you were depressed what was the darkest moments of your</p>
<p>life what took you there how did you get out it was triggered by a person making a comment about</p>
<p>something to do with work that didn&rsquo;t matter you know it was like uh to anyone else they would</p>
<p>hear that and it would just be like okay we&rsquo;ll deal with it next week whatever but for some</p>
<p>reason i took it in a way that um i felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me even beyond</p>
<p>the rational part of it of understanding you know even after the problem that came up was solved</p>
<p>it somehow undermined something in me and made me feel very vulnerable in a way that i hadn&rsquo;t felt</p>
<p>before and it spiraled how did you get out i did a lot of different kinds of therapy i did um</p>
<p>starting with alternative therapies i was seeing i would say between seven and eight</p>
<p>doctors and or therapists a week um acupuncture uh talk therapy um herbs or any any possible</p>
<p>modality tried everything for a long time and um and and nothing seemed to have an impact and then</p>
<p>finally um i&rsquo;m wary of taking any western medicine i&rsquo;m not a drug taker and or drinker</p>
<p>partier in any way and um i found a a psychopharmacologist who was a psychic</p>
<p>but because she was a psychic i was okay to see her because she&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll do i&rsquo;ll listen</p>
<p>to a psychic yeah but i&rsquo;m not going to listen to a psychopharmacologist but the fact that she had</p>
<p>the the psychic uh that made her fit into my world view and um and she recommended antidepressant which</p>
<p>went terribly wrong in the first night that i took it and then i that set me on a journey</p>
<p>of looking for the right antidepressant which was a long and painful process heck of a journey</p>
<p>every one that i took made me sick everyone and then finally i don&rsquo;t know five months later six</p>
<p>months later i found the magic one that worked for me and it um it shifted me out of the depression</p>
<p>i took it for my camera was six months or a year and then weaned off and was okay and then i had</p>
<p>another event some years later i think i took it again for a short period of time and got out of it</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve not needed it since were you able to kind of introspect the triggers that led to the events</p>
<p>is there something or is it random events of life i think it&rsquo;s more that um</p>
<p>because of the way that i grew up i never had to deal with much controversy</p>
<p>ah and um when i when i was challenged i didn&rsquo;t have any ability to deal with it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like um you know jonathan hight talks about it&rsquo;s like that so you&rsquo;ve actually also mentioned</p>
<p>like business sometimes gives you stress so these this was business related stuff yeah</p>
<p>it was a business related thing it just made me feel bad it&rsquo;s one of the sadder things about art</p>
<p>and music is that it&rsquo;s often interleaved with business folk i suppose that&rsquo;s the way of the</p>
<p>world if you have a capitalist system but it makes that business folks rubbing up against artists</p>
<p>um can sometimes destroy a fragile mind and soul like uh to me like one of the best representations</p>
<p>of an artist honestly johnny i have the designer from apple and he&rsquo;s just so fragile with his</p>
<p>ideas and you talked about like when he has ideas he really wouldn&rsquo;t show it to steve jobs or anybody</p>
<p>except for a small design team because he was so nervous that it would it would break let&rsquo;s give</p>
<p>it a chance let it give it a chance to grow and it seems like the outside world uh business people</p>
<p>pr people people kind of um have not lost themselves in the passion of creating but instead</p>
<p>of kind of representing or like making deals all that kind of stuff they they can kind of trample</p>
<p>on those little ideas and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s sad to see yeah it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s really heartbreaking to</p>
<p>see because you know how much trampling there&rsquo;s going on it&rsquo;s one of the main jobs my jobs as a</p>
<p>record producer is to um keep the keep the voices away from the artist from all the people who are</p>
<p>really on their side but don&rsquo;t know you know like the uh whether it be people um anyone on the</p>
<p>business side who doesn&rsquo;t make things they&rsquo;re excited to do their part you know they&rsquo;re excited</p>
<p>if when you deliver the thing the the art that you make to me then we can start the project yeah um</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s nothing to sell if the art doesn&rsquo;t happen in the right way and it has to be protected</p>
<p>and it can&rsquo;t happen on the same kind of a timetable that um that business can it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>different thing it doesn&rsquo;t art doesn&rsquo;t come in a quarterly way and that doesn&rsquo;t apply just to music</p>
<p>or it applies to art it applies to all creative pursuits like this is generally the case like at</p>
<p>mit it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s the administration and then there is the professors and students and the</p>
<p>professors students are the creative folk yeah they create stuff they dream they have wild ideas</p>
<p>that go on tangents and so on they they uh they have hopes and they they go with those and they</p>
<p>get like on these weird passionate pursuits and then the administration can often just trample on</p>
<p>that um and they they set up bars on all kinds of in all kinds of ways that you think you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>actually hurting um but you really are and you know i won&rsquo;t mention why but because this happens</p>
<p>to everybody and i have a large amount of leverage at mit now but even i get a little bit of pressure</p>
<p>in such stupid ways to like don&rsquo;t like be careful be careful like we really want your career to</p>
<p>succeed be careful and that little pressure to an artist you know do you want to go acapella</p>
<p>do you want to go do you want to do a country record like be careful like you&rsquo;re already a</p>
<p>superstar be careful yeah and then in that way you kind of push people like flock of fish into</p>
<p>one fish tank where they&rsquo;re all the same and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s sad to see and it&rsquo;s obviously in the modern</p>
<p>world there&rsquo;s nice mechanism to protect to let artists flourish a little bit more because they</p>
<p>get to put themselves to the world and get a little bit more confidence maybe different funding</p>
<p>mechanisms all that kind of stuff but tremendous problem that the the voices that don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>interfering with the process is huge the other side of it is in success there can be a lack of</p>
<p>there can be a lack of reality where all of the people around the successful person just tell</p>
<p>them everything they do is great and then they they don&rsquo;t have anything to bump up against anymore</p>
<p>have a realistic uh sense of what&rsquo;s what how things work or how how it how the how things measure you</p>
<p>know um so both sides are really important both both avoiding the voices getting in the way</p>
<p>and having a trusted group of you know a sangha a group of people who can say you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if that&rsquo;s as good and you can still you know say i don&rsquo;t care what you think that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>but it helps to hear it you know it helps to have if someone who you respect tells you something</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t good enough it&rsquo;s helpful when you know it comes from a place of love when it comes from a</p>
<p>place of wisdom 100 percent and not from a place of fear not from a place of oh this doesn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s going to do as well as your last thing that&rsquo;s yeah that&rsquo;s not the point the point is on</p>
<p>this uh quest for greatness are you living up to your ability by the way is there something</p>
<p>interesting to say about your world view because you mentioned psychic and instead of the ways</p>
<p>we can be healthy the ways we can grow and how much maybe medicine or science or has</p>
<p>um has the answers is there is there some interesting way to describe that world view</p>
<p>i would just say i&rsquo;m open mind i believe anything&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>and if i was going to trust in any practical information it would be something thousands</p>
<p>of years old there&rsquo;s wisdom in that history yeah well it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more tested it&rsquo;s not always right</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s at least it&rsquo;s been somewhat tested so science is also tested the thing i&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>bit skeptical of sometimes is just the hubris that often comes with the modern with the latest</p>
<p>the newest the this this feeling like you figured it all out everything that&rsquo;s been done in the past</p>
<p>has no wisdom and uh we basically solved every problem uh you know there&rsquo;s nothing else to be</p>
<p>solved this i mean that&rsquo;s the defining characteristic of any age is like we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>solved all the problems there are we have the final answers and our parents are all stupid</p>
<p>that kind of energy yeah and that you have to be extremely extremely careful with that when it</p>
<p>talks about when you think about something as complex as the human body or the human mind</p>
<p>you have to be very very very we know close to nothing yeah exactly close to nothing that&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>anything about anything about anything that place of humility is a good place to start to figure</p>
<p>to figure it all out and in the end we&rsquo;ll still know almost nothing yeah i don&rsquo;t think we need to</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s like we need to see what works and we need to see what works for us it&rsquo;s interesting to</p>
<p>know i i know on the art side knowing how it works isn&rsquo;t what makes it work you know isn&rsquo;t the magic</p>
<p>of it isn&rsquo;t how it works the magic is the magic and the magic happens in a way that&rsquo;s intuitive</p>
<p>and accidental at times or uh incidental where you&rsquo;re trying many things all of a sudden something</p>
<p>works and um and you don&rsquo;t know why and it&rsquo;s okay not to know why it doesn&rsquo;t matter it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really matter why as long as it does the thing that you want it to do whatever that is yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so weird when you know the components you don&rsquo;t you still yeah the magic what&rsquo;s the magic</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the magic like we know the components for stuff i care about artificial intelligence we know</p>
<p>the components of a powerful computing machinery where does consciousness come from what is that</p>
<p>uh where does the uh brilliant moments of insight come from what&rsquo;s that when uh even in simple games</p>
<p>of chess or in simple where do those breakthrough ideas of taking the big risk that doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense and then all of a sudden it becomes something beautiful yeah we don&rsquo;t need to understand why it</p>
<p>just happens it just happens and often the things that end up breaking through don&rsquo;t break through</p>
<p>in the way we thought or turn out to be a third iteration of something that we thought was an</p>
<p>entirely different thing or we don&rsquo;t know you know it&rsquo;s and i i think it&rsquo;s if we embrace that not</p>
<p>knowing we&rsquo;ll have a healthier experience going through life you made a lot it&rsquo;s not just music</p>
<p>everything rearranging the chairs the furniture as well you&rsquo;ve done like i said the documentary</p>
<p>i guess you would say with paul mccartney and um you&rsquo;ve done a podcast yourself uh broken</p>
<p>record podcast and just you&rsquo;ve done conversation too so what have you learned from that process</p>
<p>about the art of conversation and also maybe what advice would you give to this uh to me about how</p>
<p>what to do with conversation like what is interesting to you about conversation one of the</p>
<p>things that i i like is to not feel like it&rsquo;s there is any stakes or that it&rsquo;s actually almost</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not happening like the fact that when i came in you were setting up cameras made it less</p>
<p>good from for me i knew that that would impact the conversation in a negative way the best version</p>
<p>of it would be if we didn&rsquo;t see the cameras and if we were and we didn&rsquo;t see any technology</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t see any technology and we were just sitting at this table having a conversation</p>
<p>maybe even if we were miked beforehand would be okay if it was necessary but then we were just</p>
<p>sitting here having a conversation no people in the room nothing and feeling like we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>having a conversation i feel like it would get closer to um closer to the relaxed feeling same</p>
<p>thing we do in the studios like you know you&rsquo;ve heard of red light fever you know when uh artists</p>
<p>get nervous when like they play a song great and then the tape starts rolling and they can&rsquo;t play</p>
<p>it and it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re all we&rsquo;re all to some degree like that when you were with paul mccartney i mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re did were you cognizant of cameras we had the room black everybody who was working there</p>
<p>was dressed in black everything was invisible that we were lit in a way where even though</p>
<p>there were probably 20 people between 12 and 20 people working in the room within three minutes</p>
<p>of starting the conversation paul and i were alone in the room so it that was the the feeling</p>
<p>on occasion you&rsquo;d hear a noise and it would be weird people we also had nobody was allowed to</p>
<p>wear shoes because it had to we were trying to create this intimate space and and i know from</p>
<p>in the recording studio when we&rsquo;re recording if even one person is there that&rsquo;s just watching</p>
<p>and not working you know like does like there&rsquo;s usually i&rsquo;m usually there and an engineer is there</p>
<p>technically making it happen if anyone else is in the room it&rsquo;s different because then it goes from</p>
<p>this moment where the person&rsquo;s doing a performance to the sense or where the person is</p>
<p>is feeling something internally and we&rsquo;re capturing it to the the other version is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re performing for someone it&rsquo;s so interesting so like to push back in the alternatives here so</p>
<p>one about the third person not to make people self conscious but i find that i&rsquo;m so torn on that</p>
<p>because sometimes when that person uh like um so evan is in the room here he&rsquo;s been in the</p>
<p>room before he&rsquo;s a huge fan of yours by the way uh so he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll nod yeah he&rsquo;ll get excited he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like and you can see that nodding and for some reason for me he&rsquo;s like yeah yeah you get it like</p>
<p>yeah you get excited together i mean that&rsquo;s that third person can be like a really special so</p>
<p>having an audience uh when it&rsquo;s a friend or somebody that has that love in them it depends</p>
<p>on the performer right yeah some people really thrive in front of an audience and you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>you like that simple intimacy well i like the reality of it not being i want it to be as far</p>
<p>from a performance as possible got it and if if someone i&rsquo;ll tell you a story a story that just</p>
<p>happened and it was viewed as kind of a it seemed uncool in the moment to the person that it happened</p>
<p>to it wasn&rsquo;t at all um we were recording the new chili peppers album which is coming out i think</p>
<p>any day now like uh i don&rsquo;t know what today&rsquo;s date is but within the next it maybe by the</p>
<p>time this airs it will be out and um the band was playing in the studio and it was ripping</p>
<p>because they play they&rsquo;re incredible and um one of the members walked through the control room</p>
<p>after a particularly great performance and um the engineer said wow that solo is really great</p>
<p>and the person who heard this said please don&rsquo;t say that and walked away it&rsquo;s like it it was</p>
<p>not it it just changed yeah this feeling of we&rsquo;re in this place where we&rsquo;re doing this thing and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there is no outside world yeah you know we&rsquo;re doing this for us we&rsquo;re going as deep as</p>
<p>we can for us and as soon as there&rsquo;s an acknowledgement to someone else in a way</p>
<p>it breaks the concentration of being inside of it that&rsquo;s so well told and but it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about saying wow that&rsquo;s always great is is uh shows the it reminds you that there&rsquo;s an outside</p>
<p>world but i feel like there&rsquo;s a way to enter the inside world as an audience so you just have to</p>
<p>do that so it matters what you say it matters how you look it matters uh so there&rsquo;s like these</p>
<p>generic compliments not generic but they they sound in the way an outside world would interact</p>
<p>as opposed to in that creative thing where you&rsquo;re dancing around the fire together or something</p>
<p>it was actually i can tell you there&rsquo;s another interesting one that happened to me and i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know this until i saw the film of it which was a strange one um we were recording with the avid</p>
<p>brothers and um the song was called no hard feelings and it was this recording of no hard</p>
<p>feelings</p>
<p>when my body won&rsquo;t hold me anymore</p>
<p>it finally lets me free well i&rsquo;ll be ready</p>
<p>when my feet won&rsquo;t walk another such a great voice so beautiful</p>
<p>kissed goodbye will my hands be steady when i lay down my fears my hopes and my doubts</p>
<p>the rings on my fingers and the keys to my house with no hard feelings</p>
<p>when the sun hangs low in the west and the light in my chest won&rsquo;t be kept</p>
<p>hell today any longer</p>
<p>when the jealousy fades away so bright so hopeful so lighthearted</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just hallelujah and love involved love in the words</p>
<p>love in the songs they sing in the church and no hard feelings</p>
<p>Lord knows they have it done</p>
<p>much good for anyone kept me afraid and cold</p>
<p>with so much to have and more</p>
<p>when my body won&rsquo;t hold me anymore it finally lets me free</p>
<p>is he sound as good as good, yeah? yes, every bit</p>
<p>of snow from the heavens will i join with the ocean blue or run into the savior true</p>
<p>and shake hands laughing and walk through the night straight to the light</p>
<p>holding the love i&rsquo;ve known in my life and no hard feelings</p>
<p>Lord knows they have it done much good for anyone kept me afraid and cold</p>
<p>with so much to have and more</p>
<p>under the burning sky i&rsquo;m finally learning why</p>
<p>it matters for me and you to say it and mean it too</p>
<p>life is loneliness</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s loneliness</p>
<p>good as it&rsquo;s been to me</p>
<p>i have no enemies</p>
<p>you</p>
