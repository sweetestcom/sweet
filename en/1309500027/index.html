    <p>hi guys how are you today</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Syrian</p>
<p>and today it&rsquo;s Monday</p>
<p>which means murder mystery and makeup</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m way too excited</p>
<p>but if you are new here</p>
<p>every Monday I&rsquo;ve been doing a murder</p>
<p>mystery and makeup video where I sit down</p>
<p>I get ready</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like a get ready with me</p>
<p>and we talk about a true crime</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that and just a little disclaimer</p>
<p>before we get started</p>
<p>today is like it&rsquo;s pretty bad and it&rsquo;s pretty gory</p>
<p>be aware okay</p>
<p>okay in the comment section</p>
<p>I kept seeing this name pop up over and over again</p>
<p>um so naturally I was like let me look into this</p>
<p>this lady is intense</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get into it okay</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re going to be talking about Catherine Knight</p>
<p>are you familiar</p>
<p>you probably are</p>
<p>she was a big deal</p>
<p>I think she still is</p>
<p>but not really</p>
<p>shut up Bailey</p>
<p>get to the point</p>
<p>okay so Catherine Knight lived in Aberdeen</p>
<p>New South Wales</p>
<p>which is north of Sydney Australia</p>
<p>a little background</p>
<p>she worked in a slaughterhouse in 1971</p>
<p>she then worked on animal carcasses</p>
<p>and she would work in the boning room</p>
<p>so she would get all the meat off of the animals</p>
<p>and she would cut the marrow off as well</p>
<p>her co workers would say like</p>
<p>she was really good with a knife</p>
<p>and she was really good at her job</p>
<p>based off of reports</p>
<p>it seemed like she also really enjoyed it</p>
<p>Catherine though</p>
<p>she in her personal life</p>
<p>had a string of bad relationships</p>
<p>first marriage</p>
<p>while working as a boner in the butcher shop</p>
<p>Catherine met a guy named David</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call him David K</p>
<p>David K His last name is Klett</p>
<p>I think Klett</p>
<p>David was reported to be a raging alcoholic</p>
<p>and prone to fist fights</p>
<p>or just fighting</p>
<p>so he would drink</p>
<p>and then he would</p>
<p>he would fight</p>
<p>it was reported that David would try to beat Catherine</p>
<p>but she could hold her own</p>
<p>so David quickly learned that Catherine actually</p>
<p>could throw down</p>
<p>she never backed down</p>
<p>and she always would fight back</p>
<p>so if he tried to attack her</p>
<p>she would come at him 10 times harder</p>
<p>in 1974 Catherine convinced David to get married</p>
<p>even though they had problems in the relationship</p>
<p>marriage seemed like a good idea</p>
<p>so they got married</p>
<p>and throughout the marriage they</p>
<p>David was obviously drunk</p>
<p>because he was an alcoholic</p>
<p>which would cause issues in the relationship</p>
<p>and anyone&rsquo;s relationship</p>
<p>really on their wedding night</p>
<p>after love making</p>
<p>David fell asleep</p>
<p>and Catherine got really upset</p>
<p>so it triggered something in her</p>
<p>and some people reported that</p>
<p>it had to do with hearing friends and family</p>
<p>um saying we did it</p>
<p>03:57 times a night</p>
<p>on our wedding night</p>
<p>so she was like</p>
<p>comparing her wedding night</p>
<p>to what she&rsquo;s heard</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to be like</p>
<p>so when they only did it one time</p>
<p>and then David fell asleep</p>
<p>it made Catherine really upset</p>
<p>so she then decided to strangle him</p>
<p>because that</p>
<p>I guess that just made sense to her</p>
<p>but he ended up waking up</p>
<p>and he fought Catherine off of him</p>
<p>so despite Catherine Almost killing David</p>
<p>on the first night of their marriage</p>
<p>they ended up staying together for 10 years</p>
<p>in those 10 years</p>
<p>they had 2 daughters also</p>
<p>in that 10 years</p>
<p>David ended up leaving one time</p>
<p>so apparently</p>
<p>David had snuck out of the house</p>
<p>in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to try and leave Catherine</p>
<p>and when he left</p>
<p>it sent Catherine into a really deep depression</p>
<p>at one point</p>
<p>Catherine ended up staying in a psychiatric hospital</p>
<p>for a couple of months</p>
<p>after she had gone to a mechanic</p>
<p>who had worked on david&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>she tried to fight him</p>
<p>or she threatened to kill him</p>
<p>you see she was upset with a mechanic</p>
<p>because the mechanic had fixed david&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>which helped</p>
<p>get David away from Catherine</p>
<p>so she was upset at the mechanic</p>
<p>because how dare he help David get away from her</p>
<p>in her mind</p>
<p>it made sense to us</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like girl no</p>
<p>and once she got out</p>
<p>her and David actually ended up back together again</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t last long though</p>
<p>and then they ended up separating once</p>
<p>Catherine and David had been separated for a while</p>
<p>then Catherine met another David</p>
<p>named David Saunders</p>
<p>and they ended up in a relationship</p>
<p>David number 2</p>
<p>a few months after meeting</p>
<p>David and Catherine</p>
<p>ended up moving in together</p>
<p>so everything was moving very quick</p>
<p>but he also kept his own apartment</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s kind of living in 2 places</p>
<p>at one time</p>
<p>David did not want to move in with Catherine</p>
<p>he liked having his own place</p>
<p>and this pissed</p>
<p>Catherine off to her</p>
<p>it meant that he was living this double life</p>
<p>he obviously had his</p>
<p>like a whole</p>
<p>another separate life</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t want to combine his life with hers</p>
<p>it probably means that he&rsquo;s cheating on her</p>
<p>it made her mad</p>
<p>because it meant that</p>
<p>he just didn&rsquo;t want to spend time with her</p>
<p>it really set her off</p>
<p>and made her just very upset</p>
<p>to a degree</p>
<p>that you and I probably don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>because what she did</p>
<p>to prove that she was upset</p>
<p>is just like what</p>
<p>in an argument</p>
<p>Catherine took their 2</p>
<p>month old puppy</p>
<p>she slit the</p>
<p>puppy&rsquo;s throat</p>
<p>in front of David</p>
<p>just to show him</p>
<p>what she was capable of</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s not a red flag</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is</p>
<p>after some time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for laughing</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t funny</p>
<p>but this parts</p>
<p>kind of funny</p>
<p>you see her</p>
<p>the her reasoning behind slitting the puppy&rsquo;s throat</p>
<p>was that she was just cranky</p>
<p>like that was her excuse</p>
<p>that she was just cranky</p>
<p>despite all like</p>
<p>that happening</p>
<p>they ended up having a daughter together</p>
<p>and shortly</p>
<p>after the daughter was born</p>
<p>there was an altercation</p>
<p>they got into a fight</p>
<p>and Catherine</p>
<p>stabbed David</p>
<p>with a pair of scissors</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure what the fight was</p>
<p>and if he reported it or not</p>
<p>I guess I could have dug a little bit deeper</p>
<p>on that one</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that relationship ended</p>
<p>so then Catherine</p>
<p>gets into another relationship</p>
<p>his name is John</p>
<p>Chillingworth</p>
<p>they actually had a relationship</p>
<p>for about 3 years</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>much abuse going on</p>
<p>in this new relationship</p>
<p>they ended up having a son together</p>
<p>and it said that</p>
<p>this relationship was really calm</p>
<p>and good because</p>
<p>most of the time</p>
<p>Catherine was</p>
<p>cheating on John</p>
<p>with another man</p>
<p>whose name was John Price</p>
<p>it said that</p>
<p>her relationship was good</p>
<p>because she was having an affair</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>there was no reports of</p>
<p>her being crazy</p>
<p>so John was 45</p>
<p>at the time</p>
<p>and this would just be the relationship</p>
<p>that really pushed her</p>
<p>over the edge</p>
<p>when the relationship</p>
<p>first started</p>
<p>it was going really well</p>
<p>they would go out</p>
<p>um socially</p>
<p>have some drinks</p>
<p>with friends</p>
<p>at the local pub</p>
<p>John had 2 wait</p>
<p>are these all the same names</p>
<p>John had 2 children</p>
<p>who lived with him</p>
<p>they were a little bit</p>
<p>older though</p>
<p>so they weren&rsquo;t young</p>
<p>and the children</p>
<p>reported to really</p>
<p>like Catherine</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have any issues with her</p>
<p>John worked in the</p>
<p>local mines</p>
<p>and he made</p>
<p>pretty good money</p>
<p>and he did really well</p>
<p>for himself</p>
<p>but Catherine</p>
<p>did suggest</p>
<p>to John that</p>
<p>they get married</p>
<p>but John actually declined</p>
<p>he was like no this is</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t a good idea</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really want to get married</p>
<p>and when he declined</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>obviously things</p>
<p>once again just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go so</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when friends</p>
<p>would notice</p>
<p>that Catherine</p>
<p>started to become</p>
<p>very verbally</p>
<p>abusive towards</p>
<p>him mentally</p>
<p>she was always</p>
<p>in his head</p>
<p>she would also become</p>
<p>physically abusive</p>
<p>with John as well</p>
<p>so she was just</p>
<p>beating the poor guy up</p>
<p>the worst thing about</p>
<p>well not the</p>
<p>this is the worst</p>
<p>thing about her</p>
<p>but the thing</p>
<p>with Catherine is</p>
<p>when she was</p>
<p>upset she would</p>
<p>always fight</p>
<p>with vengeance</p>
<p>like she wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just fight with you</p>
<p>like a normal person</p>
<p>with Catherine</p>
<p>she would like</p>
<p>she was just cut throat</p>
<p>like one thing</p>
<p>she had done was</p>
<p>John took home</p>
<p>1/1 aid kit</p>
<p>from his work</p>
<p>and Catherine</p>
<p>took video of it</p>
<p>showing that the</p>
<p>first aid kit</p>
<p>was in his possession</p>
<p>and then she sent that</p>
<p>to john&rsquo;s boss</p>
<p>which then got him</p>
<p>fired because</p>
<p>to the company</p>
<p>it was seen as him</p>
<p>stealing property</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>so she did that</p>
<p>because she was mad at him</p>
<p>that he wouldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>married to her</p>
<p>but then she ended</p>
<p>she ended up</p>
<p>getting him</p>
<p>fired so now</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>I mean it turns out</p>
<p>the first aid</p>
<p>kit was only</p>
<p>worth like 20</p>
<p>so it was really</p>
<p>upsetting to John</p>
<p>and John actually</p>
<p>ended up kicking her out</p>
<p>of the house</p>
<p>that they lived in</p>
<p>which was john&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>so John was</p>
<p>fired from his job</p>
<p>and then he kicked Catherine out</p>
<p>they actually</p>
<p>were apart for</p>
<p>about 3 months</p>
<p>but somehow</p>
<p>Catherine would always</p>
<p>weasel her her</p>
<p>way back in</p>
<p>with these guys</p>
<p>so Catherine</p>
<p>would constantly</p>
<p>pressure John</p>
<p>to marry her</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what it is with her</p>
<p>in marriage</p>
<p>like she just</p>
<p>wanted to be married</p>
<p>John refused</p>
<p>and it would just</p>
<p>lead to more</p>
<p>and more fights</p>
<p>their friends</p>
<p>and their family</p>
<p>started to notice</p>
<p>it even more</p>
<p>anytime that</p>
<p>there was an altercation</p>
<p>though with</p>
<p>between Catherine and John</p>
<p>John would go</p>
<p>tell a friend</p>
<p>what was going on</p>
<p>that way he always</p>
<p>had a witness</p>
<p>or somebody</p>
<p>who knew what happened</p>
<p>just in case</p>
<p>Catherine wanted</p>
<p>to flip the script</p>
<p>and act like</p>
<p>she was the victim</p>
<p>in the relationship</p>
<p>so at least</p>
<p>he was kinda smart</p>
<p>in that sense</p>
<p>like he was</p>
<p>trying to let</p>
<p>people know</p>
<p>like this is</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>if you hear</p>
<p>something else</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s a lie</p>
<p>so eventually</p>
<p>John ended up</p>
<p>calling the police</p>
<p>because he wanted Catherine</p>
<p>out of the house</p>
<p>he wanted her gone</p>
<p>and she wouldn&rsquo;t leave</p>
<p>so he called the police</p>
<p>thinking that</p>
<p>they could pretty much</p>
<p>escort Catherine</p>
<p>out of the household</p>
<p>he could get rid of her</p>
<p>just remove her</p>
<p>from my house</p>
<p>but the police came back</p>
<p>saying that he</p>
<p>John needed a</p>
<p>court order</p>
<p>to get her removed</p>
<p>from the house</p>
<p>in February of 2000</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>fight between</p>
<p>Catherine and John</p>
<p>which ended</p>
<p>with a chest wound</p>
<p>so Catherine</p>
<p>tried to stab John</p>
<p>and she ended up</p>
<p>going to police</p>
<p>and reported</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>being violent</p>
<p>towards her</p>
<p>and it was in</p>
<p>self defense</p>
<p>she then took</p>
<p>a restraining order out</p>
<p>against him</p>
<p>but these restraining orders</p>
<p>no matter like</p>
<p>who got one</p>
<p>they would always</p>
<p>end up back</p>
<p>together I think</p>
<p>John knew that</p>
<p>something was</p>
<p>going to happen</p>
<p>because he ended</p>
<p>up telling co</p>
<p>workers he ever</p>
<p>goes missing</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>happens to him</p>
<p>that it was</p>
<p>Catherine Catherine</p>
<p>would kill him</p>
<p>so he was telling co</p>
<p>workers this</p>
<p>and really just like</p>
<p>being open about it</p>
<p>he also sent</p>
<p>down his boss</p>
<p>and told his boss</p>
<p>everything that</p>
<p>was going on</p>
<p>as well and</p>
<p>the same thing</p>
<p>if anything</p>
<p>had happened to him</p>
<p>that it was</p>
<p>Catherine the</p>
<p>bitch is crazy</p>
<p>so John ends up</p>
<p>going to the</p>
<p>courts because</p>
<p>he wants to</p>
<p>get Catherine</p>
<p>removed from the</p>
<p>house and also</p>
<p>a restraining order</p>
<p>against her</p>
<p>so he goes to the courts</p>
<p>he tells them</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and he left</p>
<p>there with a</p>
<p>straining order</p>
<p>which would</p>
<p>limit contact</p>
<p>from Catherine</p>
<p>but of course</p>
<p>they went ignored</p>
<p>by Catherine</p>
<p>like she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give 2 shits</p>
<p>so a little</p>
<p>while later</p>
<p>John comes home</p>
<p>from work and</p>
<p>he has like</p>
<p>a home routine</p>
<p>where he goes</p>
<p>to the neighbors</p>
<p>he says hello</p>
<p>checks in with everybody</p>
<p>and then he ends up</p>
<p>falling asleep</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to bed at 11 pm</p>
<p>Catherine came home</p>
<p>shortly after that</p>
<p>she made herself dinner</p>
<p>she watched some TV</p>
<p>she took a shower</p>
<p>and then she</p>
<p>went up to bed</p>
<p>and she woke</p>
<p>John up they had</p>
<p>sexual relations</p>
<p>and then they went</p>
<p>back to bed</p>
<p>well John went</p>
<p>back to bed</p>
<p>Catherine kept</p>
<p>a butcher&rsquo;s</p>
<p>knife in her bed</p>
<p>stand next to</p>
<p>the bed in one</p>
<p>of the drawers</p>
<p>suspicious and</p>
<p>then this is</p>
<p>when everything</p>
<p>just goes bad</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what exactly</p>
<p>triggered this</p>
<p>something was triggered</p>
<p>so Catherine</p>
<p>opens up her</p>
<p>nightstand she grab</p>
<p>she takes out</p>
<p>her butcher</p>
<p>knife and then</p>
<p>she proceeds</p>
<p>to stab John</p>
<p>37 times and</p>
<p>according to</p>
<p>blood evidence</p>
<p>it seemed that</p>
<p>John definitely</p>
<p>like try to</p>
<p>fight back and he</p>
<p>tried to make</p>
<p>a run for it</p>
<p>but eventually</p>
<p>he passed away</p>
<p>after killing John</p>
<p>she then took a</p>
<p>bunch of pills</p>
<p>lay down and</p>
<p>I think she</p>
<p>tried to kill herself</p>
<p>or she was just</p>
<p>putting on like</p>
<p>a chauffeur</p>
<p>police we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know</p>
<p>the next day</p>
<p>um john&rsquo;s co</p>
<p>workers you know</p>
<p>took his word for it</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t show</p>
<p>up for work</p>
<p>that day they were</p>
<p>like John said</p>
<p>if he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come up to like</p>
<p>if he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come to work</p>
<p>to call the police</p>
<p>because Catherine</p>
<p>killed him so</p>
<p>John doesn&rsquo;t show</p>
<p>up for work</p>
<p>and his co workers</p>
<p>being great</p>
<p>people call</p>
<p>the police police</p>
<p>go to the house</p>
<p>then go do it</p>
<p>a check see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on now</p>
<p>police knock</p>
<p>at the door</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re knocking</p>
<p>an answer they see</p>
<p>that john&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truck is there</p>
<p>so you know</p>
<p>obviously he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>home they knock</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s answering</p>
<p>so then they look</p>
<p>through the</p>
<p>little people</p>
<p>not the people</p>
<p>where they put the mail</p>
<p>the mail slot</p>
<p>they look through</p>
<p>the mail slot</p>
<p>just to see</p>
<p>if they can</p>
<p>see anything</p>
<p>the police reported</p>
<p>that all he</p>
<p>could see was</p>
<p>a big curtain</p>
<p>hanging and</p>
<p>it was blocking</p>
<p>his view so</p>
<p>after no response</p>
<p>the police go inside</p>
<p>of the home</p>
<p>and they proceed inside</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re walking</p>
<p>towards this</p>
<p>big curtain</p>
<p>the other police</p>
<p>officer thought</p>
<p>it was a big</p>
<p>blanket that</p>
<p>was kind of</p>
<p>covering the</p>
<p>way they could</p>
<p>automatically see</p>
<p>when they walked in</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just blood</p>
<p>everywhere right</p>
<p>so they know</p>
<p>something went</p>
<p>down in here</p>
<p>okay they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>walking towards</p>
<p>this curtain</p>
<p>the police pushes</p>
<p>the curtain aside</p>
<p>so they proceed</p>
<p>into the room</p>
<p>so he uses his</p>
<p>left arm to</p>
<p>push it aside</p>
<p>the police looks down</p>
<p>and realizes</p>
<p>his whole arm</p>
<p>is covered in blood</p>
<p>so he looks at</p>
<p>this curtain</p>
<p>that he just</p>
<p>pushed aside</p>
<p>he looks at</p>
<p>the curtain</p>
<p>he realizes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a curtain</p>
<p>this is serious</p>
<p>he looks and he realizes it&rsquo;s not a curtain</p>
<p>nae nae it&rsquo;s skin</p>
<p>skin hanging from the door frame just skin</p>
<p>then he looks down on the ground</p>
<p>and sees a torso on the ground</p>
<p>no head side note</p>
<p>I know a police officer is supposed to be you know</p>
<p>brave and strong</p>
<p>but any of us would have ran out of there</p>
<p>so quick screaming hell no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like something you would just see in a movie</p>
<p>not real life</p>
<p>uh uh so the officer keeps walking</p>
<p>and sees that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s blood all over the walls</p>
<p>just splattered everywhere</p>
<p>floor was covered in blood</p>
<p>then the officers walk into the kitchen</p>
<p>and they see plates of food being prepared</p>
<p>like there was vegetables</p>
<p>there was meat cooked</p>
<p>they searched the house</p>
<p>they went upstairs into the hallway</p>
<p>and then they heard someone snoring</p>
<p>bitch run you know</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Catherine was on the bed sleeping</p>
<p>police officers tried to wake her up</p>
<p>but she wasn&rsquo;t responding</p>
<p>they then picked her up</p>
<p>carried her outside and put her on the back lawn</p>
<p>so police go back into the home</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when they start to just see more</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t want to see</p>
<p>so they realized that</p>
<p>the skin was hanging from butchers</p>
<p>hooks on the door frame</p>
<p>just skin john&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>because his torso was on the ground</p>
<p>and there was no head</p>
<p>they found his head</p>
<p>and it was cooking in a stew in the kitchen</p>
<p>so it was on the stove</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s head was on the stove</p>
<p>forensic investigators show up to the house</p>
<p>and instantly they notice a sweet smell</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like that sweet smell</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s a body I guess</p>
<p>anyway so they walk into the house</p>
<p>and and instantly they notice the flesh</p>
<p>the skin hanging from the meat hooks in the doorway</p>
<p>so forensic investigators determined that</p>
<p>based off of the blood spatters again</p>
<p>blood spatters tell a lot more than I thought</p>
<p>based off the blood spatters</p>
<p>they could tell that</p>
<p>okay John was on the bed right</p>
<p>Catherine stabbed him</p>
<p>shit ton of times</p>
<p>John then tried to get up</p>
<p>make a run for it</p>
<p>so he gets up off of the bed</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s blood on the light switch</p>
<p>so they are like okay</p>
<p>so he must have been like</p>
<p>reaching for the light switch</p>
<p>they then noticed like down the hallway</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s blood on swipes down the hallway</p>
<p>so they see okay</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s trying to run down the hallway</p>
<p>as it proceeded downwards</p>
<p>they noticed that the blood spatters</p>
<p>were getting lower and lower</p>
<p>so John was like</p>
<p>slowly falling downwards</p>
<p>probably because he&rsquo;s getting weaker and weaker</p>
<p>then they noticed that the front door</p>
<p>had blood on the screen</p>
<p>so he made it</p>
<p>John made it to the front door</p>
<p>but then they saw on the ground</p>
<p>that there was like this dragging motion of blood</p>
<p>so Catherine must have grabbed him</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>dragged him</p>
<p>drug him no</p>
<p>dragged him back to wherever she was going with it</p>
<p>in the lounge room</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the torso was found</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where like</p>
<p>the biggest pool of blood was</p>
<p>so I guess Catherine just laid him on the ground</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where she skinned him</p>
<p>and at first</p>
<p>I was like dang</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d she know how to skin him</p>
<p>well back when she was skinning the animals and stuff</p>
<p>in the butcher place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where she learned her little tricks I guess</p>
<p>so she skinned John</p>
<p>and then she took his skin off</p>
<p>and she placed it onto the carpet</p>
<p>like next to her</p>
<p>and then they know that the head was still on the body</p>
<p>when he was on the ground</p>
<p>because that there was like</p>
<p>an outline on the carpet</p>
<p>or the floor</p>
<p>of where his head was</p>
<p>forensic investigators assumed</p>
<p>okay well she then cut his head off</p>
<p>and then she carried it to the kitchen</p>
<p>because there were blood stains</p>
<p>now leading into the kitchen</p>
<p>where they assumed</p>
<p>she carried his head</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like hard to believe honestly</p>
<p>it just sounds like something from a movie</p>
<p>right like what</p>
<p>I made the mistake of looking up the images</p>
<p>so then in the kitchen</p>
<p>is where she cut a big piece of muscle</p>
<p>from his back</p>
<p>so like your big back muscle</p>
<p>she cut that into 5 separate pieces</p>
<p>like 5 little mini steaks</p>
<p>and then she cooked it in the oven</p>
<p>350 degrees</p>
<p>for about 45 minutes</p>
<p>they saw that</p>
<p>she had 4 plates made</p>
<p>and then the dog outside</p>
<p>had the 5th piece of meat that she had cut up</p>
<p>so then they also noticed that there were</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it called</p>
<p>table settings</p>
<p>table was made</p>
<p>because she was gonna have dinner</p>
<p>guests over</p>
<p>so there was little nameplates</p>
<p>and it was all the nameplates</p>
<p>of their children</p>
<p>so Catherine</p>
<p>was planning on</p>
<p>I guess having people over</p>
<p>and feeding them</p>
<p>their own father</p>
<p>did she think that people were gonna come over</p>
<p>and not notice</p>
<p>like the blood everywhere</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a crazy</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna know</p>
<p>so police um</p>
<p>investigators</p>
<p>obviously took all of the items</p>
<p>in the house</p>
<p>that had blood on it</p>
<p>look like it had been touched</p>
<p>look like she had used</p>
<p>as evidence</p>
<p>so police investigators were saying</p>
<p>cause this is the timeline</p>
<p>that they put together</p>
<p>once she killed John</p>
<p>she then took a shower</p>
<p>she changed</p>
<p>she then took john&rsquo;s wallet</p>
<p>and she ran to do some errands</p>
<p>and they know this</p>
<p>because at 12 a m</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s bank card</p>
<p>was used to</p>
<p>take money out</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re assuming it was Catherine</p>
<p>that she took his card</p>
<p>and she took out 1 000</p>
<p>what she planned to do</p>
<p>with the money</p>
<p>nobody knows</p>
<p>they ended up</p>
<p>never finding the money</p>
<p>that she took out</p>
<p>so they assumed that</p>
<p>she took out this money</p>
<p>and then she buried it somewhere</p>
<p>so she was gonna go back and get the money</p>
<p>but they just</p>
<p>they never found it</p>
<p>so Catherine</p>
<p>was immediately detained</p>
<p>and she was in a coma</p>
<p>I believe for 4 days 5 days</p>
<p>so they couldn&rsquo;t interview her</p>
<p>until she woke up</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>when she woke up</p>
<p>and she was being interviewed</p>
<p>she had no memory</p>
<p>of what happened</p>
<p>before they never do the whole interview</p>
<p>she just wasn&rsquo;t giving anything away</p>
<p>she does eventually accept the fact</p>
<p>that she killed John</p>
<p>she claimed that she killed him</p>
<p>due to the long string of abuse</p>
<p>that she was</p>
<p>receiving from John</p>
<p>throughout their relationship</p>
<p>they never get</p>
<p>like a clear</p>
<p>story from her</p>
<p>like what happened</p>
<p>but she does</p>
<p>admit that she killed him</p>
<p>um catherine&rsquo;s brother said that</p>
<p>she told him</p>
<p>she was going to kill John</p>
<p>and get away with it</p>
<p>because she was going to act crazy</p>
<p>which is exactly what she proceeded to do</p>
<p>Catherine originally in court</p>
<p>pled not guilty</p>
<p>and then midway through the</p>
<p>court trial</p>
<p>she ended up</p>
<p>changing her plea to guilty</p>
<p>but she didn&rsquo;t give any reason</p>
<p>as to why she did that</p>
<p>nothing at all</p>
<p>she just was like</p>
<p>I wanna change it</p>
<p>and she change it to guilty</p>
<p>the judge was nervous about that</p>
<p>because he knew exactly what she was</p>
<p>gonna try and do</p>
<p>she was going to appeal the case</p>
<p>saying that she pled guilty</p>
<p>because she was insane</p>
<p>at the time</p>
<p>when she pled guilty</p>
<p>so she was just</p>
<p>gonna say that</p>
<p>she was not in the</p>
<p>right mental state</p>
<p>to plead guilty</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>she just knew what she was doing</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>smart cookie</p>
<p>give her that</p>
<p>psychiatrist</p>
<p>actually ended up doing an</p>
<p>evaluation on her</p>
<p>and determined that</p>
<p>she was definitely</p>
<p>in her right mind</p>
<p>that she was not</p>
<p>mentally unstable</p>
<p>like she was saying</p>
<p>she was what</p>
<p>kind of test</p>
<p>they gave her</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I think we can all agree</p>
<p>that she was</p>
<p>mentally ill</p>
<p>because who</p>
<p>in the right mind</p>
<p>would do that</p>
<p>right but Nene</p>
<p>you should not</p>
<p>get off lightly</p>
<p>for that cause</p>
<p>that is disturbing</p>
<p>throughout court</p>
<p>she did not show</p>
<p>any type of emotion</p>
<p>she was just like</p>
<p>then out of nowhere</p>
<p>she randomly started</p>
<p>acting crazy</p>
<p>she would start screaming</p>
<p>at the top of her lungs</p>
<p>rocking back and forth</p>
<p>trying to portray this</p>
<p>not I&rsquo;m sick</p>
<p>you know which</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s never done this</p>
<p>throughout her</p>
<p>her entire life</p>
<p>and so people knew that</p>
<p>she was just acting</p>
<p>she just want to</p>
<p>manipulate the situation</p>
<p>and the judge knew that</p>
<p>he was really smart</p>
<p>and there was an interview on YouTube</p>
<p>that I watched</p>
<p>where he was like</p>
<p>breaking it all down</p>
<p>and he just knew</p>
<p>exactly what</p>
<p>she was doing</p>
<p>the judge determined that</p>
<p>she would get</p>
<p>life in prison</p>
<p>without the possibility of parole</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first woman</p>
<p>in Australia</p>
<p>to get a life sentence</p>
<p>with no chance</p>
<p>of parole so</p>
<p>good for you</p>
<p>Catherine no one</p>
<p>fully knows</p>
<p>what took place that night</p>
<p>because Catherine still</p>
<p>to this day</p>
<p>like has not</p>
<p>talked about it</p>
<p>and no one knows</p>
<p>like what she did</p>
<p>with the money</p>
<p>what did she do</p>
<p>when she left the house</p>
<p>what the hell was she doing</p>
<p>like what in 2006</p>
<p>Katherine did</p>
<p>apply to appeal</p>
<p>she claimed</p>
<p>that her life</p>
<p>sentence was too severe</p>
<p>for her crime</p>
<p>she did obviously rejected this appeal and said no</p>
<p>Catherine no</p>
<p>but Judge has said</p>
<p>like this is the worst thing we&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>in our lives</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>psychologists have examined Catherine</p>
<p>determined that killing and dismembering</p>
<p>John was premeditated</p>
<p>and an act of revenge</p>
<p>plus it just got her off on her perverted pleasure</p>
<p>Catherine really enjoyed</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just a sick sick lady in prison</p>
<p>Catherine attends church on a regular basis</p>
<p>and she sings in a woman&rsquo;s choir</p>
<p>I was reading different articles about Catherine</p>
<p>like in jail</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s the boss bitch around there</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>that everybody listens to her</p>
<p>she calls the shots</p>
<p>and she I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;ll ever</p>
<p>come clean about what she did that night</p>
<p>and that concludes the story about Catherine Knight</p>
<p>so I think we can all agree that Catherine was not well</p>
<p>and poor John</p>
<p>his life was taken from him</p>
<p>because of Catherine I don&rsquo;t know why she was that way</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of us will</p>
<p>really know why she was that way</p>
<p>so let me know what you think down below</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really not much you can say</p>
<p>other than what the F</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the takeaway is with this</p>
<p>because I felt like John did everything that he was</p>
<p>supposed to do</p>
<p>he told his friends</p>
<p>he told his boss</p>
<p>he told his family</p>
<p>like what was going on with Catherine</p>
<p>he tried to get the police involved</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never a smooth process</p>
<p>with going to the police and whatnot</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s all I have to say</p>
<p>I hope that you have a great day today</p>
<p>make good choices</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go murdering anybody okay</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t go eating them</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think you should do that</p>
<p>I will see you guys later bye</p>
