<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>hey welcome back everyone</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here with another show a lot of a</p>
<p>lot of great questions lined up</p>
<p>um in social media so we&rsquo;re gonna Dive</p>
<p>Right In anything that I say is</p>
<p>definitely not meant to diagnose or</p>
<p>treat you or replace your medical care</p>
<p>check with your</p>
<p>competent position before implementing</p>
<p>any of these suggestions</p>
<p>all right Steve good morning and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Dive Right In good morning to you sir</p>
<p>and we will Terry has been dutifully</p>
<p>passing along the questions from social</p>
<p>media so let&rsquo;s start with Susan from</p>
<p>YouTube when someone has lost so much</p>
<p>weight that their eyes look sunken in</p>
<p>how can they restore their eye area to</p>
<p>its normal look and I&rsquo;ll tell you I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known some people docked that I knew for</p>
<p>years that were very obese and and they</p>
<p>really did look sort of hollow when they</p>
<p>went down and kept it off it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting phenomena</p>
<p>well the thing that comes to mind with</p>
<p>that is if you I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m guessing</p>
<p>you use the type of</p>
<p>plan that I recommend because I I will</p>
<p>say that um there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>types of Keto right you do dirty keto</p>
<p>you have all different types of like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s for example</p>
<p>um Ideal Protein that&rsquo;s keto that&rsquo;s low</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s low carb but it&rsquo;s also low fat</p>
<p>and in the type of foods that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using are are really</p>
<p>um processed type packaged foods which</p>
<p>you end up losing weight but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really look vibrant and healthy so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know about that</p>
<p>question so</p>
<p>um I would</p>
<p>um but let&rsquo;s say you did the healthy</p>
<p>version of the ketogenic diet and you</p>
<p>still look Hollow there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things that you can do to</p>
<p>to kind of fill out things to make</p>
<p>um make you look healthier and of course</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that come to</p>
<p>mind you know like get out in the sun a</p>
<p>lot more</p>
<p>um consume Foods</p>
<p>um with the healthy fats make sure you</p>
<p>do not go low fat because we need that</p>
<p>healthy glow and that healthy those</p>
<p>healthy fat sitting from your diet I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about Omega</p>
<p>Three fatty acids like the cod liver oil</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be afraid to have</p>
<p>cholesterol in your diet from eggs and</p>
<p>butter because</p>
<p>um that is going to</p>
<p>support the endocrine system</p>
<p>and help especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>postmenopausal and in the skin and the</p>
<p>um collagen</p>
<p>um all these factors so you&rsquo;re you know</p>
<p>people think of the um your skin or</p>
<p>hydration as the main thing that fills</p>
<p>things out and you&rsquo;re if it&rsquo;s sunken in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dehydrated dehydrated it&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of the um the fat balance in</p>
<p>your diet and also if you go low fat</p>
<p>people tend to look very unhealthy so I</p>
<p>would start eating more healthy fats and</p>
<p>just and get more sun and more exercise</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how I would counter it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>data I have well Susan we hope that</p>
<p>helps uh and let&rsquo;s uh here&rsquo;s typical of</p>
<p>Dr Berg&rsquo;s hate mail so Louise from</p>
<p>YouTube I&rsquo;ve been taking Dr Berg&rsquo;s hair</p>
<p>formula for four months now and my hair</p>
<p>has stopped thinning I also take a cup</p>
<p>of green two of green tea daily thank</p>
<p>you Dr Berg so that&rsquo;s some more uh</p>
<p>information from out in the field I love</p>
<p>you doc let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go into</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s first question and Doc here it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>all right so which hormone is mostly</p>
<p>involved with hair loss</p>
<p>all right team uh climb on that audience</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll move on and why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>really move on all the way to the United</p>
<p>Arab Emirates where we have Ahmad a</p>
<p>patiently waiting for us and a mod if</p>
<p>you unmute yourself you&rsquo;re wrong with Dr</p>
<p>Byrd yes hello can you hear me yes</p>
<p>perfectly</p>
<p>uh thank you my question is that</p>
<p>actually I took finest ride for hair</p>
<p>loss and I am maintaining severe side</p>
<p>effects from that medicine because I</p>
<p>took it for around two and a half months</p>
<p>uh I have a lot of things so some kind</p>
<p>of pains in every area I couldn&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m just in my hands and</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>what can you advise me to do or what is</p>
<p>the right thing to make</p>
<p>so that medication blocks an enzyme</p>
<p>called five Alpha reductase which</p>
<p>basically stops the conversion of</p>
<p>testosterone into DHT which is the type</p>
<p>of estrogen that binds more tightly to</p>
<p>The receptors okay and then the because</p>
<p>it binds more tightly The receptors</p>
<p>it can inhibit the growth of hair and so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s just true is basically</p>
<p>allowing you to have less DHT right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s doing but the problem</p>
<p>is that when you have low DHT which is</p>
<p>the form of testosterone you have just</p>
<p>as many side effects</p>
<p>um as you have with too much DHT</p>
<p>the real problem with DHT is not</p>
<p>necessarily with that enzyme it&rsquo;s with</p>
<p>the Androgen receptor being more</p>
<p>sensitive it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a genetic um</p>
<p>issue with those receptors so what can</p>
<p>you do now how can you make that</p>
<p>receptor not so sensitive of absorbing</p>
<p>this DHT right there&rsquo;s several things</p>
<p>you can do one</p>
<p>um is that you can do things to increase</p>
<p>oxygen like for example</p>
<p>um exercise can definitely help</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re anemic</p>
<p>that erecting that can increase oxygen</p>
<p>and how do you do that well iron B12</p>
<p>folate very very important and also can</p>
<p>help you with hair hair growth</p>
<p>um also making sure there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>inflammation in your scalp so how do you</p>
<p>do that vitamin D</p>
<p>vitamin D in itself</p>
<p>and actually uh help regulate that</p>
<p>oversensitivity situation and lower the</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>um also the amino acid um</p>
<p>a lysine also can help that problem as</p>
<p>well and that comes from mainly</p>
<p>um red meat animal products and versus</p>
<p>people that try to eat too many nuts or</p>
<p>seeds or grains or beans they get more</p>
<p>of the other</p>
<p>Arginine which actually can block that</p>
<p>L-lysine so</p>
<p>so again if you have the animal products</p>
<p>and fish and things I think you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>the iron you&rsquo;ll get the B12 you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>the L-lysine and that can help you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then um</p>
<p>the other thing is like um it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>Palmetto is a natural thing to take I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re taking that that</p>
<p>would be something that you could</p>
<p>benefit from like like what</p>
<p>uh saw palmetto</p>
<p>uh-huh yeah that&rsquo;s a good one I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take any of these</p>
<p>so I would start to look at my videos in</p>
<p>relationship to this uh this this</p>
<p>receptor for Androgen and start working</p>
<p>on that because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily want to completely</p>
<p>block</p>
<p>uh that that receptor you want to</p>
<p>balance it because there&rsquo;s a genetic</p>
<p>weakness in that area uh like for women</p>
<p>um you ever hear that after they get</p>
<p>like pregnancy like they might actually</p>
<p>grow hair during pregnancy but right</p>
<p>after pregnancy they lose their hair or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in their menstrual cycle certain</p>
<p>times they might lose their hair that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because they have a dip in estrogen so</p>
<p>this the hormones can be a big factor as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so anyway I just wanted to give you a</p>
<p>few tips there but I have a lot more if</p>
<p>you go to my YouTube videos so thank you</p>
<p>very much you&rsquo;re welcome all right</p>
<p>thanks for joining us from the UAE we</p>
<p>really appreciate it and we hope that</p>
<p>you uh do great in your uh pursuit of</p>
<p>healthy hair and doc I hate to say this</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re absolutely after you this</p>
<p>morning Don Louis and Jennifer from</p>
<p>YouTube are doing well with your help</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost 26 pounds in six months and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just five pounds from my uh from my</p>
<p>ideal weight thank you Dr Berg so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to let you alone today</p>
<p>awesome awesome okay so uh Michael from</p>
<p>YouTube I had double bypass surgery</p>
<p>about three weeks ago I&rsquo;m a type 2</p>
<p>diabetic how much d3k2 and cod liver oil</p>
<p>should I be taking not to clog up my</p>
<p>arteries again uh and what other</p>
<p>suggestions might you have to offer to</p>
<p>Michael</p>
<p>you know I would just recommend use the</p>
<p>recommended dosage on the back of the</p>
<p>label it&rsquo;s those two nutrients are not</p>
<p>going to clog your arteries up okay</p>
<p>um and you&rsquo;re probably referring to the</p>
<p>cod liver oil because it&rsquo;s a fat it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to clog your arteries up it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in fact it&rsquo;s going to thin the blood</p>
<p>prevent</p>
<p>um plot formation it&rsquo;s uh it helps to</p>
<p>decrease the platelet stickiness it</p>
<p>helps to thin the blood so it does the</p>
<p>opposite of that</p>
<p>um also it&rsquo;s a great anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re getting rid of inflammation</p>
<p>that could could be the reason why you</p>
<p>you know that if someone develops</p>
<p>lacking or clot clotting so I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the right track so I I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be concerned about it those</p>
<p>things clotting you at all very good we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait to see the new you after that</p>
<p>process really takes hold all right Dr</p>
<p>Berg we have an answer for the first</p>
<p>question today which asks which hormone</p>
<p>is mostly involved with hair loss speak</p>
<p>of the devil and uh 55 percent of our</p>
<p>respondents say is testosterone you</p>
<p>spoke of that 40 say estrogen and five</p>
<p>percent say insulin who&rsquo;s correct</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re all correct um but specifically I</p>
<p>was looking for that hormone I actually</p>
<p>just mentioned DHT what the heck is DHT</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a type of testosterone that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is more powerful</p>
<p>and normally like if we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>hair</p>
<p>um you should have like 10 of that</p>
<p>testosterone be DHT</p>
<p>um but again like I said before if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more of a sensitivity to that</p>
<p>receptor it binds</p>
<p>more so uh normally it binds like five</p>
<p>times more so let&rsquo;s say it binds 10</p>
<p>times more and it gets in the way and</p>
<p>then it interferes with the growth of</p>
<p>hair so really</p>
<p>um a good</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>thing to focus on if you have pattern</p>
<p>baldness if you&rsquo;re women or if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>guy or a girl you need to start to look</p>
<p>at that area more than other areas like</p>
<p>how can I regulate that DHT better</p>
<p>not completely block it because then it</p>
<p>comes with the package you start getting</p>
<p>you know side effects from um you know</p>
<p>like um decrease libido and things like</p>
<p>that so we want just to regulate it and</p>
<p>unfortunately some people have that</p>
<p>genetic issue so you know I&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about that before I&rsquo;ll be talking more</p>
<p>about it but there&rsquo;s things that you can</p>
<p>do to overcompensate which I&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>mentioned with the first guest</p>
<p>all right very good now we move on to</p>
<p>fried frog from YouTube and Mr Frog I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have a word with your parents for</p>
<p>their terrible naming convention that</p>
<p>must be so embarrassing anyway Mr Frog</p>
<p>asks I get vestibular migraines what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best way to eliminate them</p>
<p>I have no idea but um for headaches or</p>
<p>migraines in general there&rsquo;s several</p>
<p>things that I recommend</p>
<p>um the first thing I would do</p>
<p>is I would evaluate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a common cause of these headaches or</p>
<p>migraines could relate to your bile</p>
<p>ducts which is underneath the rubber rib</p>
<p>cage and so if you were to have a</p>
<p>migraine and massage underneath your rib</p>
<p>cage and that migraine went away or the</p>
<p>headache went away then we know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>related to that then you&rsquo;d want tadka as</p>
<p>a remedy and then you&rsquo;d want to get on</p>
<p>the right eating plan other causes for</p>
<p>migraines could be a deficiency of</p>
<p>sodium in which case having more salt</p>
<p>could help you</p>
<p>and I think I did a video I listed um</p>
<p>nine different causes and you can watch</p>
<p>that but as far as the vestibular type</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what&rsquo;s behind that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever done a video on</p>
<p>that specific issue so</p>
<p>sorry</p>
<p>all right very good well Mr Frog We wish</p>
<p>you well and let&rsquo;s talk about who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tuning in this morning beyond the people</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already heard from a good morning</p>
<p>to all of our viewers joining us today</p>
<p>from the UK Canada Mexico New Zealand</p>
<p>Jordan Ireland Jamaica France Germany</p>
<p>Serbia Oman Egypt Italy Pakistan Japan</p>
<p>Chile Argentina Norway Ukraine South</p>
<p>Africa Greece Olive Tree alatria</p>
<p>Nigeria Bermuda Slovenia Denmark the</p>
<p>Czech Republic Russia United Arab</p>
<p>Emirates thank you so much from our</p>
<p>guests there uh let&rsquo;s see and that</p>
<p>caused me to lose my place</p>
<p>Bermuda Slovenia Denmark the Czech</p>
<p>Republic United Air was there I caught</p>
<p>up Emirates India Algeria the Virgin</p>
<p>Islands Peru Dominican Republic in</p>
<p>Switzerland Scotland Israel Australia</p>
<p>Ethiopia Poland Morocco the Netherlands</p>
<p>Iran Greenland Brazil Spain Nepal</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago</p>
<p>Nicaragua Kenya Armenia Bosnia Finland</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a guest from up that way</p>
<p>Lithuania turkey Romania Sweden</p>
<p>Uganda Sri Lanka Portugal the</p>
<p>Philippines Belgium and all across the</p>
<p>United States of America and as usual</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet we&rsquo;ll hear in from a few others</p>
<p>jealous that their wonderful country was</p>
<p>not named so bring it on okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to Frank from Facebook I uh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a breast cancer survivor should I be</p>
<p>taking spirulina and sea kelp</p>
<p>well I think you should definitely take</p>
<p>seek help and probably something called</p>
<p>Dem dim is a constant concentrated</p>
<p>cruciferous product that can help</p>
<p>inhibit estrogen but the sea kelp is</p>
<p>also interesting</p>
<p>angle because it that that natural</p>
<p>compound which is a iodine it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>protein bound iodine so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>really safe you take that that can also</p>
<p>help regulate the excess amount of</p>
<p>estrogen which is definitely related to</p>
<p>breast cancer in men and women so um the</p>
<p>other thing to really be careful about</p>
<p>is the soy milk or the soy protein</p>
<p>isolates</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been known to create some issues</p>
<p>as well so um</p>
<p>there you have it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s some good tips very good</p>
<p>okay and this is interesting I hear a</p>
<p>lot of this stuff Jim from YouTube will</p>
<p>coffee Replacements like mud or wtr</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t heard of that Spike insulin are</p>
<p>there any other coffee Replacements that</p>
<p>you would recommend</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so I don&rsquo;t think they have</p>
<p>anything</p>
<p>bad in them I think they might be pretty</p>
<p>good you can do the green tea that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good coffee replacement tachino is</p>
<p>another one that I had long ago</p>
<p>um which is a blend of um</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not mistaken they&rsquo;re just kind of</p>
<p>roasted herbs and um and they it tastes</p>
<p>just very similar to coffee so you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>surprised and doesn&rsquo;t have any caffeine</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>I guess nowadays people are doing more</p>
<p>the the mushroom type drinks which</p>
<p>actually are adaptogens and they can</p>
<p>increase energy so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things you can take but green tea would</p>
<p>be also at the top of the list because</p>
<p>of the benefits that green tea has on so</p>
<p>many different things okay very good and</p>
<p>next Quiz question Dr Burke here it is</p>
<p>okay which biomarker is the best cardio</p>
<p>best for cardiovascular problems</p>
<p>is that the LDL or the triglycerides</p>
<p>climate audience we know you&rsquo;ll come up</p>
<p>with a great answer let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um how about Mr</p>
<p>DJ health so Mr health is asking I got a</p>
<p>zero score on my CAC test but the scan</p>
<p>report indicated a calcified</p>
<p>renaloma in the left lower lobe should I</p>
<p>be concerned also my blood glucose is</p>
<p>110 after a 10 hour fast how come he</p>
<p>says</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s talking about the the coronary</p>
<p>artery calcification test and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great that it&rsquo;s zero that is awesome but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s concerned because there&rsquo;s calcium</p>
<p>um in the left lobe of the liver the uh</p>
<p>sorry the the lung</p>
<p>um which is probably that something that</p>
<p>occurred after inflammation in the lung</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>honestly I I would say I wouldn&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about it</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s not like you have calcium in the</p>
<p>arteries anymore</p>
<p>so um I mean I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;ll ever</p>
<p>go away but there is a lot of people who</p>
<p>have these little calcium deposits</p>
<p>throughout the body</p>
<p>um but the question is why was there</p>
<p>damage there at some point was there</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>um and sometimes the body heals with</p>
<p>this calcification and it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>difficult to have the completely be</p>
<p>removed I&rsquo;m glad that it&rsquo;s not in your</p>
<p>your kidneys or your arteries anymore so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good or if it was that would be</p>
<p>bad but the point is that um calcium is</p>
<p>uh sometimes very pathogenic if it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the wrong place and the thing that</p>
<p>controls calcium is that vitamin K2</p>
<p>vitamin K2 so it&rsquo;s important to have</p>
<p>that in sufficient quantities and I did</p>
<p>recently a video on the foods that are</p>
<p>highest in K2 you can watch that</p>
<p>um the other reason why you get</p>
<p>calcification is there&rsquo;s inflammation in</p>
<p>the arteries in other parts of your body</p>
<p>so how do we get rid of that we emo we</p>
<p>avoid</p>
<p>this omega-6 fatty acid which is</p>
<p>competitive for the Omega-3</p>
<p>so you have to get rid of and this is so</p>
<p>important the omega-6 fatty acids that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the corn oil</p>
<p>the soy oil the cotton seed the um</p>
<p>um safflower seed and just remove those</p>
<p>from the diet they&rsquo;re in the salad</p>
<p>dressings they&rsquo;re on a lot of deep fried</p>
<p>foods going to restaurants it&rsquo;s in all</p>
<p>the fast foods</p>
<p>um that stuff it&rsquo;s in the corn chips</p>
<p>that stuff just is inflammatory and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Steve recently we um we adopted uh five</p>
<p>new pigs as a rescue mission goodness</p>
<p>I I&rsquo;m gonna create a video on on these</p>
<p>pigs when I do a video on sleep apnea</p>
<p>because they have probably the most</p>
<p>severe sleep apnea snoring problem I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever heard in my life I mean they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the barn I&rsquo;m talking like probably 300</p>
<p>feet away and I can hear them</p>
<p>from that location okay and these these</p>
<p>poor goats who have to sleep in the barn</p>
<p>now sleep outside the barn because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re too noisy so um they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>definitely an issue but they&rsquo;re obese</p>
<p>and so whoever raised them kept them in</p>
<p>a small pen and fed them of course the</p>
<p>high level of omega-6 fatty acids in</p>
<p>this corn</p>
<p>they lived on corn and they just got so</p>
<p>fat they could barely walk so we&rsquo;ll put</p>
<p>them on a program and then we&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>videos over time and help them lose</p>
<p>weight and um</p>
<p>yeah just you know it&rsquo;s just terrible so</p>
<p>anyway stay tuned for that video well we</p>
<p>sure will and I would suggest that for</p>
<p>their bedtime help them adjust their</p>
<p>CPAP mask because that I think is the</p>
<p>basis of the problem very long snouts to</p>
<p>help you get that to work I will do that</p>
<p>okay uh and also let&rsquo;s see the is now</p>
<p>obligatory hey what about us uh just</p>
<p>came through so an additional shout out</p>
<p>to our other viewers from Somalia</p>
<p>Bulgaria Saint Lucia Yemen Palestine</p>
<p>South Korea Liberia Cambodia and Saudi</p>
<p>Arabia welcome all so I&rsquo;ve got the world</p>
<p>pretty well covered I think okay why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go to quiz question number two</p>
<p>which we asked and it asks the audience</p>
<p>which biomarker is the best for</p>
<p>cardiovascular problems LDL or</p>
<p>triglycerides and the audience astutely</p>
<p>said or at least 60 percent of them are</p>
<p>respondents say triglycerides and the</p>
<p>other 40s say LDL any winners</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the answer is LDL and what I&rsquo;m sorry not</p>
<p>LDL price list right ta-da I was gonna</p>
<p>say LDL is a marker uh definitely</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some issues but not as severe as</p>
<p>when you do a triglyceride test now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very important to note that when you</p>
<p>test for glycer like uh glasses for um</p>
<p>triglycerides you must do a fasting</p>
<p>triglycerides don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t eat right</p>
<p>before you go do the test you want to do</p>
<p>a good you know a good fasting level</p>
<p>test or else you&rsquo;re just going to show</p>
<p>up from the food that you just ate</p>
<p>um but the indication for high</p>
<p>triglyceride the cardiovascular health</p>
<p>is um is going to be a better biomarker</p>
<p>than LDL</p>
<p>now that being said LDL is a marker</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely a biomarker for the</p>
<p>cardiovascular but there&rsquo;s two types of</p>
<p>LDL and um I&rsquo;ve done videos on that and</p>
<p>one is pathogenic and the other is not</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um definitely um when you get your test</p>
<p>done you know if you have high</p>
<p>triglycerides and high are</p>
<p>um that that that&rsquo;s a worse uh</p>
<p>indication that there&rsquo;s a problem and</p>
<p>that really relates primarily to the</p>
<p>level of carbs that you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>because the carbs turn into</p>
<p>triglycerides uh way more than the</p>
<p>actual dietary fat</p>
<p>okay very good and Dr Burke did speak of</p>
<p>his videos and here&rsquo;s a way to have a</p>
<p>world of health information in your</p>
<p>pocket and that&rsquo;s with his uh free app</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s available both on Apple system</p>
<p>and Android so run there and get it now</p>
<p>and then when any of your friends ask</p>
<p>you a question you can whip that out and</p>
<p>hit them with an answer so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific doc thanks for working so hard</p>
<p>on that for all of us okay let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to social media uh Tammy from Facebook</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 62 I&rsquo;ve been getting mammograms</p>
<p>since uh she was 36 I&rsquo;m currently due</p>
<p>for my yearly exam but I&rsquo;m debating</p>
<p>getting it uh I I suspect it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>been clean any suggestions</p>
<p>all right so</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you to get it or not get it</p>
<p>okay don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t take my advice</p>
<p>but if it were me okay</p>
<p>if I had that out I was in your same</p>
<p>situation</p>
<p>um I would just really</p>
<p>question do that that frequently or even</p>
<p>to do it at all because of the damage</p>
<p>that some of these mammograms</p>
<p>potentially can create and I mean think</p>
<p>about it what what causes cancer it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>damage to the mitochondria well if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting your breasts in a plate</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s pressure and there&rsquo;s trauma</p>
<p>could that potentially</p>
<p>rate damage in the breasts uh like</p>
<p>physical trauma I think he could</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s debatable but it&rsquo;s something to</p>
<p>look at and uh do you want to put</p>
<p>yourself through that</p>
<p>um I have done a video on that before</p>
<p>you should watch that because there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot more to be said about that</p>
<p>um the best thing to do</p>
<p>um is to eat as if you have a propensity</p>
<p>to get cancer</p>
<p>to prevent cancer and also if your</p>
<p>parents have cancer or had cancer I</p>
<p>would get a DNA test to see if you have</p>
<p>some genetics that um</p>
<p>are also going to give you a</p>
<p>susceptibility to getting cancer and</p>
<p>then you know what it&rsquo;s going to tell</p>
<p>you to do is pretty much what I just</p>
<p>said you know like act more aggressively</p>
<p>to prevent it by consuming cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables on a regular basis uh making</p>
<p>sure that you&rsquo;re um</p>
<p>your diet is in check I think</p>
<p>you know the best thing to do because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know um if you people just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize unless you do the DNA test</p>
<p>what is your weak links so</p>
<p>um you really just need to get on the</p>
<p>healthy version the ketogenic diet and</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been suggesting and then</p>
<p>thousands of videos and you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to worry about it you&rsquo;re bulletproofed</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my suggestion good deal and I</p>
<p>have other people that are just my life</p>
<p>is my own again I&rsquo;m not going to fill</p>
<p>the whole thing with people that have</p>
<p>benefited from the keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting but they are out there so anyone</p>
<p>on YouTube can read that let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>another question uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Samar from Facebook is it true that</p>
<p>taking vitamin D not accompanied by</p>
<p>calcium can be harmful</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s just the opposite it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>opposite vitamin D helps you absorb</p>
<p>calcium by a factor of 20x in your</p>
<p>intestine right so when you take calcium</p>
<p>with Vitamin D</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>these studies were done in women</p>
<p>postmenopausal you can increase the risk</p>
<p>of getting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>cardiovascular problems why</p>
<p>well usually because you&rsquo;re taking a lot</p>
<p>of calcium because the you&rsquo;re taking a</p>
<p>thousand milligrams of calcium and then</p>
<p>you take the vitamin D you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>putting these rocks in your body</p>
<p>um I really don&rsquo;t believe we need as</p>
<p>much calcium as they say we need</p>
<p>especially you know they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>prevent bone loss but there&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>flimsy research to show that taking</p>
<p>calcium will prevent fractures if any</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done a video on that recently</p>
<p>so but they actually can increase your</p>
<p>risk of getting</p>
<p>um calcium in the arteries and creating</p>
<p>a problem so</p>
<p>um yeah I wouldn&rsquo;t I would not</p>
<p>worry about that taking you have to take</p>
<p>calcium okay by the way here&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if we&rsquo;ve ever had this situation</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s a wonderful and all of our</p>
<p>guests in The Green Room are from uh</p>
<p>Europe and abroad no uh no homegrown</p>
<p>folks here and to that end let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Dora who is coming to us from Denmark on</p>
<p>mute yourself door if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>already you&rsquo;re wrong with Dr Byrd</p>
<p>go ahead hi</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>Hi and nice to meet you Dr Berg</p>
<p>nice to meet you too</p>
<p>I am from Denmark originally I&rsquo;m from</p>
<p>Hungary by the way</p>
<p>and I have a question so recently I have</p>
<p>been watching your videos and basically</p>
<p>the first time of my life I got full</p>
<p>understanding what was going on in my</p>
<p>body the last 40 Years thank you very</p>
<p>much for that and my question is I</p>
<p>recognize from your videos that I have</p>
<p>this sibo sickness</p>
<p>and I took uh the last five years I took</p>
<p>a lot of vegetables in vegetable tour</p>
<p>mix and now honestly I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>to eat because I&rsquo;m bloated as a pig and</p>
<p>uh and gas everywhere so it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>and please tell me exactly what should I</p>
<p>eat because should I take a slow juicer</p>
<p>and do the vegetables with that or</p>
<p>should I eat only meat or I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>now what should I eat</p>
<p>so sibo is called stands for small</p>
<p>intestinal bacterial overgrowth okay and</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a situation where you have the</p>
<p>microbes in the wrong place they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the small intestine they shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>there because now they&rsquo;re competing</p>
<p>by taking your nutrition and they can</p>
<p>create a lot of gas because their your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s now fermenting in the wrong place</p>
<p>now how do these microbes ferment well</p>
<p>usually from the fiber in the vegetables</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re giving them so I think she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>asking if I&rsquo;m not mistaken um how do I</p>
<p>know if it&rsquo;s gone now and what do I need</p>
<p>to eat well just start having a small</p>
<p>amount of um salads and see if you still</p>
<p>bloat</p>
<p>um and if you don&rsquo;t then guess what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably good and you can start</p>
<p>doing that and</p>
<p>remember this is also they&rsquo;re gonna you</p>
<p>add probiotics that can also create the</p>
<p>same situation so so if you don&rsquo;t bloat</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re good if you do blow then you</p>
<p>maybe have you still have a problem with</p>
<p>that in which case</p>
<p>um you either dramatically lower the</p>
<p>amount of vegetables that you have</p>
<p>or just go carnivore completely now what</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>the juice from like wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder or the juice from vegetables well</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have the fiber so that</p>
<p>could give you the nutrition and one</p>
<p>little factor I like about that is that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a lot of phytonutrients</p>
<p>that can actually indirectly kill</p>
<p>pathogens and that can actually help you</p>
<p>as well but there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very very important for sibo and that</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>acidifying the stomach and taking bile</p>
<p>salts on an empty stomach because the</p>
<p>bile stealths tend to go down the small</p>
<p>intestine and act as a detergent peeling</p>
<p>off the microbes in the small intestine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the purposes of it so</p>
<p>apparently at some point you lost that</p>
<p>ability to produce bile to help do that</p>
<p>function which could come from your</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid in your stomach which</p>
<p>you might not have enough of so the</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid in the stomach and the</p>
<p>bile salts are two little factors that</p>
<p>um that I would pay attention to and</p>
<p>maybe start increasing those right now</p>
<p>so you can do that with betaine for the</p>
<p>chloride and then the Oxbow and you take</p>
<p>one before the meal one after meal and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna have to test the</p>
<p>waters and um you can</p>
<p>test different types of foods to see if</p>
<p>you still have a problem with it or not</p>
<p>okay thank you very much that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>appreciate it thanks Dora for coming on</p>
<p>with us and a question here I&rsquo;m ashamed</p>
<p>Dr Burke I don&rsquo;t know remember if you</p>
<p>have a probiotic product but I do know</p>
<p>that most uh cabinets medicine cabinets</p>
<p>have probiotic gummies in them Across</p>
<p>America and maybe Beyond I mean can you</p>
<p>really trust that is that a hard thing</p>
<p>to believe in those products that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually doing some good or what what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your on how to deal with I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>gummies because they they come with a</p>
<p>package they come with these extra</p>
<p>tapioca fibers and the corn fibers and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re localizing even if you</p>
<p>can add sugar to them uh some of them</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t but I don&rsquo;t like I don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>I think um you know the kind of a fad</p>
<p>thing that people are going through it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like oh yeah cool the gummies in there</p>
<p>it tastes great and they&rsquo;re gummy bears</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re so cute but</p>
<p>um the question is at the expense of</p>
<p>these synthetic fibers that our bodies</p>
<p>are not really designed to deal with</p>
<p>um they call them prebiotics but in</p>
<p>nature we&rsquo;d never have this type of</p>
<p>things we we have like fiber from actual</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>but not these all these new</p>
<p>synthetic synthesized new fibers that</p>
<p>are in our diets which are in a lot of</p>
<p>the keto plants so they haven&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>tested very long I don&rsquo;t trust them I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend them</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is a small amount gonna kill you no</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>I definitely would not um do a lot of</p>
<p>them if I were you okay thank you sir</p>
<p>all right here we go next question</p>
<p>number three a true falser</p>
<p>okay true false chronic loneliness and</p>
<p>social isolation can increase your risk</p>
<p>of cancer just as much as smoking and</p>
<p>obesity that&rsquo;s very sad can&rsquo;t wait to</p>
<p>hear the audience&rsquo;s reaction to that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to uh social media shazo</p>
<p>Ali from YouTube I&rsquo;ve had trouble</p>
<p>sleeping after starting keto and iaf</p>
<p>what can I do to restore my normal sleep</p>
<p>pattern</p>
<p>I mean what what I would do is I would</p>
<p>start to make sure you&rsquo;re taking the</p>
<p>electrolytes number one and one one</p>
<p>mineral or two minerals that can help</p>
<p>sleep is calcium and magnesium</p>
<p>so some people take my electrolyte</p>
<p>powder and that helps give them energy</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not a lot of calcium</p>
<p>in that electrolyte powder so if they</p>
<p>take it over a longer period of time</p>
<p>they may they might need a little more</p>
<p>calcium before bed in which case you</p>
<p>just need to add some and it can help</p>
<p>you go to sleep</p>
<p>but that being said there&rsquo;s also to be</p>
<p>vitamins when you go on keto the</p>
<p>requirement for B vitamins go up</p>
<p>especially for B1 and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in B1 that potentially could</p>
<p>keep you up so but this is why I</p>
<p>recommend like taking nutritional yeast</p>
<p>or the B vitamins and electrolytes when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on keto to prevent these these</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but I do have a lot of videos on sleep</p>
<p>and so if if you try B1 or you try um</p>
<p>this magnesium or calcium and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work I have plenty of additional</p>
<p>suggestions</p>
<p>all right very good I guess we&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>midst of Lent so here&rsquo;s an appropriate</p>
<p>question Terry from Facebook will</p>
<p>fasting for 20 hours affect the fasting</p>
<p>test for triglycerides</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what you it would be a good thing</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;d get a true</p>
<p>um number of what your triglycerides are</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t take in consideration the the</p>
<p>um the dietary food that can affect</p>
<p>triglycerides so yeah that would be a</p>
<p>good good fasting period to then go get</p>
<p>your triglycerides tested</p>
<p>very good okay here&rsquo;s an unusual Nancy</p>
<p>from YouTube She&rsquo;s 71 and suffers from</p>
<p>hot flashes and high blood pressure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good I&rsquo;m 20 pounds overweight</p>
<p>what measures would you recommend for me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot to do for hot flashes but</p>
<p>um the fact that you have both hot</p>
<p>flashes and high blood pressure the</p>
<p>first thing that I would try if I were</p>
<p>you would be um</p>
<p>I would try vitamin D and I would do</p>
<p>that because that could kill two birds</p>
<p>with one stone I always like to do that</p>
<p>vitamin D other things that can cause</p>
<p>hot flashes could be a lack of vitamin E</p>
<p>in which case I would take the version</p>
<p>called tocotranals or hot flashes</p>
<p>another thing that can help hot flashes</p>
<p>is some C kelp</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then the other thing that can help</p>
<p>hot flashes is just the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>post-menopausal and your body is just</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t have enough of the the sex</p>
<p>hormones anymore in which case you want</p>
<p>to feed the body more raw material to</p>
<p>make estrogen progesterone and even</p>
<p>cortisol and even testosterone to some</p>
<p>degree and the way to do that is to add</p>
<p>more cholesterol to the diet and now we</p>
<p>talk about the grass-fed butter eggs the</p>
<p>fat of your Meats which is a really good</p>
<p>thing for postmenopausal women to make</p>
<p>sure they have the raw material to feed</p>
<p>these hormones because you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>go uh I mean just take a look at women</p>
<p>that take statins that block cholesterol</p>
<p>boy there goes the hormones even more</p>
<p>just tank right down here so again</p>
<p>you really want to um take a a broad</p>
<p>look at the whole mechanism here and</p>
<p>and do the right thing instead of just</p>
<p>start to well I&rsquo;m just going to block</p>
<p>cholesterol because cholesterol is</p>
<p>affecting the heart and which is totally</p>
<p>false so</p>
<p>all right very good so Cindy from</p>
<p>Facebook what are your thoughts about</p>
<p>kombucha drinks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s basically the make it out</p>
<p>of um black tea and sugar okay and then</p>
<p>it ends up with a smaller amount of</p>
<p>sugar because the microbes eat it and it</p>
<p>helps you with your digestion</p>
<p>personally it&rsquo;s very difficult to find</p>
<p>Kombucha tea with just two grams of</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>mostly a lot of times it&rsquo;s six grams per</p>
<p>serving size or or even 10 grams 11</p>
<p>grams which you don&rsquo;t need that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need that extra sugar so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>crazy about the kombucha drinks simply</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re consuming sugar</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now that being said other people benefit</p>
<p>from kombucha and so and they still do</p>
<p>fine and maybe they don&rsquo;t have a really</p>
<p>major insulin problem go for it go for</p>
<p>it just make sure that the ingredients</p>
<p>um that come from really good</p>
<p>ingredients for example</p>
<p>um most of the sugar in America is beet</p>
<p>sugar which is GMO</p>
<p>well you don&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do kombucha make sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from actual sugar cane</p>
<p>organic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and try to find something with the</p>
<p>lowest amount of sugar possible</p>
<p>very good okay you know uh boy in the</p>
<p>news constantly are these new designer</p>
<p>drugs that end up in your corner gas</p>
<p>station Supermarket the latest one</p>
<p>causes necrosis of the skin while they</p>
<p>get high doctors are trying to keep</p>
<p>their legs skin from falling off I tell</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s such a you know a slippery</p>
<p>slope when you go in there and they are</p>
<p>quote unquote legal if you will because</p>
<p>you can grab them out of those places</p>
<p>but boy buyer beware I guess there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some really really dangerous stuff and I</p>
<p>guess until someone gets hold of it and</p>
<p>says no that should not be illegal it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legal so you know of course that goes</p>
<p>beyond what you&rsquo;re talking about with</p>
<p>kombucha but it&rsquo;s really scary I hope</p>
<p>people learn not to trust that it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>for them just because it&rsquo;s on the Shelf</p>
<p>next to the cash register</p>
<p>terrible you mean you mean even the</p>
<p>candy bars are safe because they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the Shelf that&rsquo;s what I thought well</p>
<p>yeah they haven&rsquo;t killed me yet but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve come close so anyway okay so uh</p>
<p>quiz question number three uh asked true</p>
<p>false chronic loneliness and social</p>
<p>isolation can increase your risk of</p>
<p>cancer just as much as smoking and</p>
<p>obesity</p>
<p>and 98 of our respondents say that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely true two percent are</p>
<p>holding out and say no way it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually true which is interesting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually that much so</p>
<p>um what&rsquo;s happening when you have</p>
<p>chronic loneliness social isolation is</p>
<p>you you probably are</p>
<p>you have a very spiking spike in</p>
<p>cortisol which paralyzes the immune</p>
<p>system which then lowers your defense</p>
<p>against cancer</p>
<p>um so you&rsquo;re very susceptible to having</p>
<p>a lot of health problems when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>that state so yeah that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely true I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>releasing a video on on that and that</p>
<p>would be one unusual cause of cancer</p>
<p>that you probably have not really uh</p>
<p>looked at yet but there&rsquo;s actually going</p>
<p>to be more which is actually</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about in an upcoming</p>
<p>video should be interesting very good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to our International</p>
<p>followers in the green room and Lionel</p>
<p>is coming to us from Romania and and he</p>
<p>looks very cheery all the time so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been smiling the whole time Lionel what</p>
<p>is making you so happy go ahead with</p>
<p>your question hello I&rsquo;m very happy that</p>
<p>finally have the chance to to talk with</p>
<p>Dr Beck I&rsquo;m Janelle from Romania I live</p>
<p>in a town from Transylvania my early</p>
<p>medical condition so far that I&rsquo;m aware</p>
<p>of is the Hashimoto under hormone</p>
<p>treatment with D4 old problem but no</p>
<p>symptoms thanks God the usual test for</p>
<p>blood sugar are upper normal range for</p>
<p>instance glucose level is 98 glycated</p>
<p>hemoglobin is 5.7 but I have a Homa</p>
<p>index measured last year in November</p>
<p>that is way too high 5.3 clearly my</p>
<p>Endocrinology said no worries blood</p>
<p>analysis for glucose are in range so for</p>
<p>the moment no worries but you know in</p>
<p>November when and I started to follow</p>
<p>you I started to cut sugar white bread</p>
<p>to a certain degree starches increased</p>
<p>fat do almost every day my 10K steps</p>
<p>intermittent fasting for the moment only</p>
<p>two times a week</p>
<p>the good news is that now BMI is exactly</p>
<p>25 at the edge of normal last three</p>
<p>kilos I just did a new set of blood</p>
<p>tests like you said in your videos LDL</p>
<p>went up but I have a very good ratio of</p>
<p>triglycerides to HDR that is 1.8 now you</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s good but but insulin it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still unfortunately 22 still very big</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t change at all so my question</p>
<p>specifically would be what&rsquo;s wrong and</p>
<p>specifically if you can maybe recommend</p>
<p>an ideal percentage of my daily</p>
<p>nutrients I started to count them in</p>
<p>this moment I&rsquo;m like 100 grams of carbs</p>
<p>not sure too much or to to to low for my</p>
<p>condition considering I have also</p>
<p>Hashimoto well to be honest my wife is</p>
<p>pushing me to cut some of the fats and</p>
<p>for a while stay only on vegetables and</p>
<p>and lean meat</p>
<p>and I have also a question if</p>
<p>supplements like berberine could help in</p>
<p>my my case or we&rsquo;ll just hide the</p>
<p>problems or and fool me well I&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that this was a one quick</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>um so um a couple things that uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s talking about his uh</p>
<p>his Homer IR is too high and that is a</p>
<p>test that measures insulin resistance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re looking at the fasting</p>
<p>glucose and the fasting insulin test and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little ratio there</p>
<p>um so that that home IR tells us that</p>
<p>his insulin resistance is still a</p>
<p>problem however is A1C uh is in uh I</p>
<p>think five point something is pretty</p>
<p>good which tells us that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not eating</p>
<p>um a lot of sugar</p>
<p>um and that&rsquo;s good that&rsquo;s good uh I</p>
<p>still think the fact that the a um home</p>
<p>IR is high</p>
<p>tells me that he better bring his uh</p>
<p>carbs down even more because 100 grams</p>
<p>is just a little too high I would bring</p>
<p>it down to 50 grams for sure</p>
<p>um now the other Factor that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>messing things up is this this thyroid</p>
<p>issue</p>
<p>um and I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s Hashimoto&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>so he needs um to really focus on that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;ll if you have a thyroid</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>and you go get your cholesterol and</p>
<p>those other values tested boy it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be off the charts because the thyroid</p>
<p>can be causing the cholesterol so if you</p>
<p>have a thyroid problem don&rsquo;t even worry</p>
<p>about testing your your lipids even</p>
<p>though his are fine because it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>going to be messed up do you want to fix</p>
<p>the thyroid with selenium and I have a</p>
<p>lot of videos on the nutrients that you</p>
<p>want to support the thyroid with</p>
<p>selenium it could be because your liver</p>
<p>is fatty that could be interfering with</p>
<p>the thyroid so you&rsquo;d have to fix that</p>
<p>but with choline and maybe some bile</p>
<p>salts that would help that always helps</p>
<p>the thyroid bile salts are a great</p>
<p>remedy for that</p>
<p>um the other factor to look at</p>
<p>um is just how long he had insulin</p>
<p>resistance it could be a long time which</p>
<p>could take some time to correct</p>
<p>um other reasons why what can affect the</p>
<p>insulin resistance is stress I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know his stress level but that&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>a big big factor okay with this stress</p>
<p>now he is his wife is selling him to</p>
<p>lower his cholesterol and fats which</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the secondary thing because</p>
<p>really needs to fix the thyroid rather</p>
<p>than try to fix the thyroid with</p>
<p>lowering the fats</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>how do we increase this insulin</p>
<p>resistance how can we um do that well</p>
<p>berberine is a great remedy apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar is essential</p>
<p>potential for that it&rsquo;s going to help</p>
<p>you greatly</p>
<p>um also</p>
<p>um potassium and vitamin D are also</p>
<p>really important especially potassium</p>
<p>higher levels of potassium to help you</p>
<p>fix this insulin resistance problem</p>
<p>exercise is essential</p>
<p>um so I just gave you a lot of things to</p>
<p>do there&rsquo;s other things to do in my</p>
<p>video so that should at least get you</p>
<p>started for the next few days</p>
<p>thank you you&rsquo;re welcome Lionel thank</p>
<p>you so much for being such a great</p>
<p>representative of lovely Romania</p>
<p>appreciate it love to hear back from you</p>
<p>with all your uh remedies or your good</p>
<p>reports rather from these things okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go to uh quiz question</p>
<p>number four which is a true false or Dot</p>
<p>okay true false apple cider vinegar can</p>
<p>turn into ketones in your body and give</p>
<p>you energy</p>
<p>interesting and that sounds sort of</p>
<p>exciting somehow let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media uh</p>
<p>oh Natalie from Facebook I suffer from a</p>
<p>fast heart rate I&rsquo;ve been on keto and</p>
<p>Aya for eight weeks I thought it would</p>
<p>help but it doesn&rsquo;t appear to do</p>
<p>anything I get these episodes one to two</p>
<p>times a day</p>
<p>yeah what I would do if I were you</p>
<p>is it could be related to</p>
<p>uh your Pacemaker and electrolytes which</p>
<p>is a common issue when you start keto if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get on a good electrolyte</p>
<p>blend then it kind of you know you could</p>
<p>be deficient in electrolytes and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already going into this program</p>
<p>deficient in electrolytes this can</p>
<p>aggravate the problem so I would start</p>
<p>taking the electrolytes especially the</p>
<p>potassium and the magnesium in which</p>
<p>case it can actually be the thing you</p>
<p>needed to kind of calm down the pulse</p>
<p>rate I do know when someone is potassium</p>
<p>deficient their pulse rate goes up this</p>
<p>is why when you do a lot of carbs for</p>
<p>example you deplete your potassium and</p>
<p>all of a sudden you end up with this</p>
<p>higher pulse rate there&rsquo;s other things</p>
<p>that can also increase the pulse rate</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s B1 the other thing that you I</p>
<p>always recommend to take more of when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the ketogenic plan so</p>
<p>potassium and B1 and maybe magnesium are</p>
<p>the three things I would recommend to</p>
<p>bring this pulse rate down the normal</p>
<p>State</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I mean when you think about it</p>
<p>what are you gonna what else are you</p>
<p>gonna do you&rsquo;re going to go back to</p>
<p>carbs is that going to help how can that</p>
<p>help your pulse rate</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it does I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the solution I think the solution</p>
<p>is just to get these other nutrients in</p>
<p>your body so you can naturally</p>
<p>control the rate of your your heart</p>
<p>very good well we hope that helps and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s move on the audience as usual has</p>
<p>really ripped through the questions our</p>
<p>fourth question was true false apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar can turn into ketones in</p>
<p>your body and give you energy sounds</p>
<p>exciting uh the audience 68 of them say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s true 32 percent say that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true at all</p>
<p>about I&rsquo;d say two weeks ago</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I was a little bit tired and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>wow I didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t change anything</p>
<p>except I dropped down my apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar right and then I&rsquo;m like I put it</p>
<p>back in and I&rsquo;m like wow I had more</p>
<p>energy</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s various reasons that I</p>
<p>thought</p>
<p>that apple cider vinegar helped your</p>
<p>energy</p>
<p>or as far as the the mechanics of it you</p>
<p>know with because the bloating or</p>
<p>digestion and maybe acidifying and</p>
<p>helping with blood sugars but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another reason which I recently learned</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know this</p>
<p>um acetic acid which is the acid and</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar the main one it</p>
<p>um turns into acetone which is one of</p>
<p>the three types of ketones</p>
<p>so it is true that acetic acid can</p>
<p>actually give you energy by the fact</p>
<p>that it increases your ketones</p>
<p>it also can be converted to the other</p>
<p>Ketone called beta hydroxy butyrate and</p>
<p>so that is the why it can give you</p>
<p>energy not to mention our bodies also</p>
<p>make acetic acid it&rsquo;s a small chain</p>
<p>fatty acid that um</p>
<p>that can help um</p>
<p>you get energy which is fascinating so</p>
<p>if you want more energy it&rsquo;s the really</p>
<p>simple thing to do one to two</p>
<p>tablespoons of this apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>and water maybe a big glass of water</p>
<p>once or twice a day and I bet you</p>
<p>anything your energy will start to go up</p>
<p>and now you know why wow that&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>well I care what we&rsquo;re gonna go to Sonia</p>
<p>our final guest from UK however we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to kick off a quiz question number</p>
<p>five before we do</p>
<p>all right true or false</p>
<p>if a product you buy says zero trans</p>
<p>fats</p>
<p>it means there&rsquo;s zero trans fats in</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>well yes or no audience true or false</p>
<p>true or false and here we go all the way</p>
<p>from the UK is Sonia you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>Byrd</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke thank you for taking my</p>
<p>inquiry</p>
<p>um yeah uh basically I had the</p>
<p>hysterectomy three months ago</p>
<p>um kept the ovaries up and now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to have symptoms of menopause</p>
<p>um so uh the worst some somehow there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a bit of answering 10 of my</p>
<p>questions from the previous uh previous</p>
<p>um inquiry but um yeah I&rsquo;m having hot</p>
<p>flashes and chill flashes as well for</p>
<p>just as it has the very hot one it</p>
<p>follows the chill one and um and then</p>
<p>yeah I was just wondering what uh should</p>
<p>be aware of and how I can support this</p>
<p>transition in my body what Naturals</p>
<p>so yeah so can I ask you um why why did</p>
<p>you have a hysterectomy in the first</p>
<p>place</p>
<p>so I had fibroids I had a very bulky</p>
<p>uterus</p>
<p>uh sadly he had to go</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>um so there&rsquo;s a couple things that I</p>
<p>would recommend as a remedy</p>
<p>um to help with this this these symptoms</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically it&rsquo;s not not any of</p>
<p>my products it&rsquo;s a product from standard</p>
<p>processors too and it&rsquo;s called eutrophin</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>over trophin PMG so eutrophin and over</p>
<p>trophin PMG and you take</p>
<p>um one of each before bed</p>
<p>and I think that</p>
<p>will really really help you that that</p>
<p>tends to balance out the ovaries in</p>
<p>relationship to the ovary</p>
<p>and the uterus and it helps to balance</p>
<p>that out to the system where your your</p>
<p>pituitary now has this direct link</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of like if you have</p>
<p>this you have this whole communication</p>
<p>cycle going on between the pituitary</p>
<p>and the ovaries and even the uterus and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a this whole feedback system and</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>you only have part of that system</p>
<p>and so now there&rsquo;s just like this short</p>
<p>circuit thing that just it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>working anymore so</p>
<p>taking these two nutritional products</p>
<p>will tend to</p>
<p>um normalize</p>
<p>that circuit in a way that can reduce</p>
<p>the problem that you have</p>
<p>um the other thing to do and you already</p>
<p>got this from other answers is that you</p>
<p>definitely want a beef up no pun</p>
<p>intended your cholesterol which will</p>
<p>give you the raw materials for some of</p>
<p>these hormones because now your adrenals</p>
<p>have to take up the slack even more and</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re just uh they&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>like hey what about me I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>overworked underpaid so I need some help</p>
<p>so you want to support the adrenals you</p>
<p>can also do that with adaptogens</p>
<p>um like ashwagandha</p>
<p>and also more cholesterol in the diet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>thank you thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thank you so much you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great the audience can&rsquo;t see them</p>
<p>in there but uh Lionel and Sonia are</p>
<p>taking copious notes while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking so that&rsquo;s great they&rsquo;re serious</p>
<p>about their health and uh you know</p>
<p>appreciate the time that you take with</p>
<p>them so it&rsquo;s obviously going to put it</p>
<p>into good use so anyway our final</p>
<p>question of the day true false if a</p>
<p>product says zero trans fat does it mean</p>
<p>zero trans fat and there is a strong</p>
<p>opinion on that 98 of our respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s false two percent are holding</p>
<p>out that it&rsquo;s true dog who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>hmm</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s uh this is a loophole</p>
<p>um the the FDA</p>
<p>in America</p>
<p>their definition</p>
<p>of zero trans fats</p>
<p>is it has to have less than 0.5</p>
<p>grams so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>half of a gram and then it can be called</p>
<p>zero trans fats when wait a second what</p>
<p>is wrong with that picture it&rsquo;s not zero</p>
<p>trans fats there&rsquo;s some in there now</p>
<p>this is per serving size okay if you</p>
<p>take a look at</p>
<p>did you ever eat those Cheez-Its before</p>
<p>I would never do okay yes</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s Cheez-Its they&rsquo;re little</p>
<p>these crackers right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s partially hydrogenated oil so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s trans fats in there so how many</p>
<p>Cheez-Its</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a serving size I don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a little handful right</p>
<p>and or even like Ruffles potato chips</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like two tablespoons of</p>
<p>chips equal one serving size</p>
<p>Steve have you ever in your life eaten</p>
<p>Ruffles potato chips</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of them I&rsquo;ve heard of them</p>
<p>but now I prefer raw broccoli</p>
<p>right okay but you probably know people</p>
<p>you know anyone that can just do one two</p>
<p>tablespoons of those potato chips in one</p>
<p>certain just like walk away from it bet</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t eat just one remember the old</p>
<p>lays Challenge and they were right I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think so they&rsquo;re pretty addictive</p>
<p>and also uh Pringles</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just do a few I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I have to do the whole thing boom</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>when you multiply and start adding up</p>
<p>the amount of serving sizes that people</p>
<p>have with trans fats they&rsquo;re walking</p>
<p>away with a tremendous amount of trans</p>
<p>fats which are very very very damaging</p>
<p>to the heart increasing risk of cancer</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;ll be doing a video on that too</p>
<p>these these synthetic fats that were</p>
<p>basically we&rsquo;re replacing our saturated</p>
<p>fats when they found oh yeah well you</p>
<p>know sorry we were wrong they created</p>
<p>more problems</p>
<p>yeah we knew that 80 years ago when they</p>
<p>had Crisco but it taken years to</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>you know say it&rsquo;s bad but even now</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s in our food supply so I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>doing a video stay tuned on that but um</p>
<p>when you read the back the label and it</p>
<p>says arsenally hydrogenated that means</p>
<p>trans fats now what if it says fully</p>
<p>hydrogenated is that trans fats</p>
<p>dancers know but it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>healthier</p>
<p>like what do I mean by that well you</p>
<p>start off with this corn oil which is</p>
<p>unsaturated and they use high Heats with</p>
<p>hydrogen under pressure with uh with a</p>
<p>metal like nickel for example and then</p>
<p>they go through this process where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re adding hydrogens to this fat and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to make it thicker they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to make it thicker they&rsquo;re turning</p>
<p>this unsaturated into a saturated fat so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to do this and so they go</p>
<p>through this process and it goes from</p>
<p>the the first phase is unsaturated but</p>
<p>all the trans fats and then we heat it</p>
<p>for a longer period of time and it turns</p>
<p>into a fully hydrogenated</p>
<p>dick fat right like margarine something</p>
<p>like that um but it no longer has some</p>
<p>partially hydrogen it&rsquo;s fully</p>
<p>hydrogenated does that make it healthier</p>
<p>I would say no it&rsquo;s still going to</p>
<p>create problems maybe not from a trans</p>
<p>fat angle but definitely from</p>
<p>the way that that fat is turned into</p>
<p>this very unhealthy artificial thing</p>
<p>okay very good I&rsquo;m just saying you</p>
<p>should probably avoid both and um so I</p>
<p>will be creating a video on that and</p>
<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s in a lot of foods and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even listed listed in like a</p>
<p>restaurant food so you don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting at restaurant Foods</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably where you&rsquo;re getting it</p>
<p>from and it&rsquo;s in all the institutional</p>
<p>Foods so that would be like in the</p>
<p>schools</p>
<p>and and I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s in all but</p>
<p>it can be because they just there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>regulation schools hospitals nursing</p>
<p>homes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>prisons</p>
<p>so if you end up in prison you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna you&rsquo;re probably gonna get trans</p>
<p>fats which is not a good thing so you</p>
<p>might want to not go to prison because</p>
<p>of that reason wow interesting okay</p>
<p>David from YouTube what is the first</p>
<p>thing to eat after doing an extended</p>
<p>fast let me jump in here Pringles I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>now a very small amount of food so um</p>
<p>you do a maybe a little um maybe half an</p>
<p>egg a little tiny bit of salad</p>
<p>um and you wait a little bit and then</p>
<p>you have a little bit more maybe a</p>
<p>couple pickles and then wait a little</p>
<p>bit maybe have</p>
<p>um a little bit of nuts and then you can</p>
<p>slowly introduce food so over a course</p>
<p>of uh maybe two or three days you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gradually increasing the amount of food</p>
<p>to the point where you&rsquo;re back on track</p>
<p>again</p>
<p>and especially do not consume refined</p>
<p>carbs or sugar if you&rsquo;re coming off of a</p>
<p>fast why because that can severely</p>
<p>create a shift in your potassium levels</p>
<p>and you can end up with um</p>
<p>a very</p>
<p>deadly condition with this shift in</p>
<p>potassium which I should probably do a</p>
<p>video just on that point because it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s something that could be</p>
<p>dangerous if you don&rsquo;t understand it you</p>
<p>know like if you come off a a three or</p>
<p>four or five day fast and you eat it you</p>
<p>start eating donuts and sugar</p>
<p>boy that would be very bad</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s no good okay probably our</p>
<p>last question of the day Zoid gerg he</p>
<p>calls himself from YouTube how can I get</p>
<p>rid of ringworm</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done videos on this there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many different remedies</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um or ringworm and other</p>
<p>sites and things like that uh tea tree</p>
<p>oil is a is a good one</p>
<p>um but that would be more actually for a</p>
<p>fungus on your toenail so I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend that I think oregano oil would</p>
<p>be much better garlic I&rsquo;m Sage all these</p>
<p>are very potent</p>
<p>anti-worm anti-parasitic there&rsquo;s many</p>
<p>others like black walnut Halls that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good one</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>wormwood extract is another good one</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many different ones what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting to me is nearly all the</p>
<p>remedies</p>
<p>or anti-worm remedies are also good for</p>
<p>cancer</p>
<p>all the anti-parasitic are good for</p>
<p>cancer which is fascinating to me but um</p>
<p>so if you want to kill two birds with</p>
<p>one stone</p>
<p>you know take the anti</p>
<p>worm natural herbs and things and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be in good shape</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very good on that note Steve</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made some really good questions</p>
<p>today I hope you guys learn a couple</p>
<p>good tips I appreciate your attention</p>
<p>for staying this long have a wonderful</p>
<p>weekend and definitely see you next week</p>
<p>not to mention in the videos coming up</p>
