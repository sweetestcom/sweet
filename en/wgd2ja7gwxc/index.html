<p>mornings at 9 o&rsquo;clock a.m. there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>some questions that people wanted me to</p>
<p>do this later in the day because in</p>
<p>other parts of the country I&rsquo;m looking</p>
<p>at that right now I&rsquo;m just not set up to</p>
<p>do that so unfortunately you won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to get up in the middle of the</p>
<p>morning and 3 o&rsquo;clock and call in but</p>
<p>anyway so the first call we have is</p>
<p>Diana from Arizona go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question about hair loss good morning</p>
<p>mr. Byrd um yeah um I&rsquo;m an adrenal type</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m taking all this supplements I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking a vitamin D at 3 and k2 and your</p>
<p>film Emma for a hair loss</p>
<p>I mean your hair and I&rsquo;m taking a sink</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s jobs that there has copper in it</p>
<p>that way because my aunt our split ends</p>
<p>as well but my hair is key I keep losing</p>
<p>my hair ok I&rsquo;m in ketosis as well and I</p>
<p>dream it admitted fast in as well ok so</p>
<p>the first question we want to know again</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just use this as an example when</p>
<p>exactly did you start losing hair um</p>
<p>like a month ago pack over ok now what</p>
<p>happened exactly just before this what</p>
<p>did you start a facet you changed</p>
<p>something what a</p>
<p>or just before you start losing here</p>
<p>well I stopped weaning ketosis I went</p>
<p>off the diet and I didn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s out of</p>
<p>the festival the vacation was over I</p>
<p>went back to the diet ok so that shaven</p>
<p>even up the change was you went off the</p>
<p>ketogenic de or you went back on it I</p>
<p>went off for a little bit but yeah it</p>
<p>was awesome to lose hair just right</p>
<p>before I went off the guy I stopped on</p>
<p>taking your what&rsquo;s called your minerals</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>trace minerals if I run out of it so I</p>
<p>stopped taking there and then start</p>
<p>taking it when I got the new order ok</p>
<p>great so there&rsquo;s a couple tips I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to recommend you know it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>amazing it&rsquo;sit&rsquo;s when you think about</p>
<p>its really simple you want to find out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a change it occurs just</p>
<p>before the change and in your case you</p>
<p>ran out of the trace minerals the trace</p>
<p>minerals basically are there to help</p>
<p>proteins form in the body you cannot</p>
<p>make proteins hair nail skin muscle</p>
<p>without trace minerals and so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that activates the enzymes to initiate</p>
<p>it so obviously hopefully you put that</p>
<p>back in but when you go into ketogenic</p>
<p>diet and you really get into ketosis and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it for a period of time</p>
<p>your proteins should normally improve on</p>
<p>your body ok so if they don&rsquo;t then that</p>
<p>means you haven&rsquo;t gotten into ketosis</p>
<p>yet I like to combine in a minute</p>
<p>fasting with ketosis because that will</p>
<p>really severely increase hormones like</p>
<p>growth hormone to preserve muscle mass</p>
<p>protein loss and all that so like even</p>
<p>take a diabetic they&rsquo;re in what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>a catabolic state where your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>breaking down protein fashion is</p>
<p>building back up so we&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>switching way over here getting rid of</p>
<p>the insulin resistance getting rid of</p>
<p>problems of insulins increasing growth</p>
<p>hormone and so I think you want to add</p>
<p>the raw material which is the trace</p>
<p>minerals make sure you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>collagen make sure you&rsquo;re doing B</p>
<p>vitamins you might</p>
<p>mean more nutritional yeast and that</p>
<p>should bring it back but whatever</p>
<p>actually improved the hair will keep</p>
<p>improving you just got to go back to the</p>
<p>successful actions but typically it</p>
<p>sounds like the change was you dropped</p>
<p>out the amino acids so put that back in</p>
<p>and touch base with us Nestle next week</p>
<p>to see if if that helped you okay so we</p>
<p>have another question from North</p>
<p>Carolina</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s rubia you to question are</p>
<p>you on the air yes good morning good</p>
<p>morning hi okay I have two questions</p>
<p>about the ketogenic diet so I&rsquo;ve been on</p>
<p>it for about three months and I have</p>
<p>seen many benefits I&rsquo;ve lost about 25</p>
<p>pounds and but every since every time</p>
<p>you know whenever I started I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>experiencing some constipation like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a ball my bowel movement</p>
<p>every three or so days and I wanted to</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m taking a lot of potassium your</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice and I&rsquo;ve you know</p>
<p>worked on getting more probiotic and and</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t seen any changes this is</p>
<p>my first question my second question is</p>
<p>my husband who does not need to lose</p>
<p>weight he also wanted to to start the</p>
<p>diet just for health but you know he was</p>
<p>on it for like two days and he lost like</p>
<p>five pounds so you know what can we do</p>
<p>for him to be on a diet on the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet and not lose weight okay good</p>
<p>question I have a quick question for you</p>
<p>as far as we look at before you won the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and after the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet tell me what&rsquo;s the big difference</p>
<p>with you are you eating a lot more</p>
<p>vegetables than you normally do are you</p>
<p>adding vegetables that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>normally eat like kale now I did kale in</p>
<p>the first week and that did not do well</p>
<p>with me so doing more like spinach</p>
<p>cabbage sauerkraut and you know just</p>
<p>vegetables that I used to eat before</p>
<p>like cucumbers and tomatoes and</p>
<p>mushrooms and things so with the kale</p>
<p>did not do well okay so is there any</p>
<p>change with the vegetables on now that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a ketogenic that you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>before or was everything exactly saying</p>
<p>before and after well I would say just</p>
<p>be a mouse before I would eat like a</p>
<p>little salad and now I&rsquo;m eating salad</p>
<p>for you know lunch and dinner okay salad</p>
<p>okay so what we&rsquo;re going to do is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to just test it out</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a couple causes of</p>
<p>constipation you&rsquo;re already doing a lot</p>
<p>of potassium that&rsquo;s great that could</p>
<p>that could handle but apparently in your</p>
<p>case it&rsquo;s not healing you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>probiotics what happens though when you</p>
<p>go on this this program that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>recommending I&rsquo;m recommending seven to</p>
<p>ten cups of vegetables these fibers and</p>
<p>the vegetables feed the microbes and if</p>
<p>these microbes are not used to that much</p>
<p>food you can overwhelm them and you can</p>
<p>pretty much kind of shut them down and</p>
<p>everything kind of backs up because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not able to keep up with the</p>
<p>digestion so chances are the reason why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constipated it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>overwhelming the system with so much</p>
<p>fiber from the vegetables so do an</p>
<p>experiment for three days cut down the</p>
<p>quantity of vegetables keep in the</p>
<p>fermented ones maybe steamed some but as</p>
<p>far as the raw ones cut down the</p>
<p>quantity and see if that doesn&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>the constipation okay that should handle</p>
<p>it and in the meantime well just do that</p>
<p>and in the meantime if that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>handle it call back next week we&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you what to do but in the meantime</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to take some type</p>
<p>of laxative healthy natural laxative to</p>
<p>keep things going because it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>dangerous to be backed up for three days</p>
<p>than it is to take a laxative okay now</p>
<p>as far as your husband goes I always</p>
<p>like to add in a minute fasting with</p>
<p>ketogenic diet the problem is you will</p>
<p>lose a lot of body fat doing this for</p>
<p>some people that&rsquo;s not a problem but for</p>
<p>some people they&rsquo;re trying to gain</p>
<p>weight unfortunately if you if you want</p>
<p>to really kind of keep your weight up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to either increase</p>
<p>the quantity of food that he&rsquo;s eating</p>
<p>adds a little bit more fat and he may</p>
<p>need to add berries and maybe a sweet</p>
<p>potato to this program</p>
<p>now it might pump amount of ketosis but</p>
<p>still for some</p>
<p>people that are trying to gain some</p>
<p>weight that might be the area to go</p>
<p>after okay so that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend hey Mike you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Pennsylvania go ahead hi dr.</p>
<p>Bergen yeah I just want to say thanks</p>
<p>for all the videos that you put out too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great source of information my</p>
<p>pleasure and my question is about apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar a few months ago my</p>
<p>glucose levels were way out of control</p>
<p>so I immediately started eating low carb</p>
<p>and that was working to a point and then</p>
<p>once I found out about apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar I started taking in it was</p>
<p>actually working so it got me back down</p>
<p>to normal but my main concern is with</p>
<p>its effect on the tooth enamel so what I</p>
<p>do is I drink it through a straw try to</p>
<p>keep it off my teeth as best as I can</p>
<p>and I rinse my mouth afterwards but but</p>
<p>still I&rsquo;m kind of concerned that you</p>
<p>know if I&rsquo;m taking this long term I</p>
<p>guess one of my questions is it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>to do long-term and is there anything</p>
<p>else I can do to make sure that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to wear my teeth enamel away yeah</p>
<p>good question Mike here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things you can do yes</p>
<p>when you do this outside of vinegar and</p>
<p>by the way episode the vinegar is a pH</p>
<p>of 2.5 I mean that&rsquo;s close to battery</p>
<p>acid it&rsquo;s so acidic your stomach page is</p>
<p>between 1 &amp; 3 absolute vinegar is 2.5 so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extremely acid and so you always</p>
<p>want to drink it through a straw you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want that stuff in your in your</p>
<p>mouth because it can break down the</p>
<p>calcium because acid tends to release</p>
<p>calcium from the system it makes calcium</p>
<p>more mobilizing you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>that so yeah a straw will be fine now</p>
<p>you also have this acid going down your</p>
<p>esophagus for most people it is not a</p>
<p>problem because you&rsquo;re diluting the</p>
<p>outside of vinegar in water 1 to 2</p>
<p>teaspoons per glass of water I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about 12 ounce not an 8 ounce so now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not getting the concentration of</p>
<p>acid anymore okay so it&rsquo;s pretty much</p>
<p>doing so it should be fine down the</p>
<p>south because if used a straw there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>going to be any problem if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>concerned then you just get it as a as a</p>
<p>pill form that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why</p>
<p>I created something called them it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called op cider vinegar plus I added a</p>
<p>powdered upset uh vinegar with the</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride which is um Siddha</p>
<p>fire in a tablet and it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>protected so there&rsquo;s not a lot of acid</p>
<p>on the outside so you swallow it goes in</p>
<p>the stomach boom you&rsquo;re fine there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>more problem it won&rsquo;t create any</p>
<p>irritation at all but it keeps your</p>
<p>stomach acid but I will say that as you</p>
<p>age the pH of the stomach goes more</p>
<p>alkaline more alkaline you lose your</p>
<p>stomach acid that&rsquo;s why an older person</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t digest you know red meats they</p>
<p>have problems with gas they start</p>
<p>becoming anemic they can&rsquo;t get the amino</p>
<p>acid so it&rsquo;s just really really</p>
<p>important add that and there&rsquo;s a plus to</p>
<p>help with a fatty liver plus to offset</p>
<p>some of the fat that you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>from the ketogenic diet so you want to</p>
<p>keep it in there but I wouldn&rsquo;t be too</p>
<p>concerned unless you have a tension on</p>
<p>it okay so those are some options that</p>
<p>you might want to try thanks Mike hey</p>
<p>Susan you&rsquo;re on the air from Michigan go</p>
<p>ahead hi thanks so much for taking my</p>
<p>call</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling for a couple of reasons I</p>
<p>have followed on your plan for a year</p>
<p>and I felt great and I&rsquo;ve advised others</p>
<p>and got a lot of people that I know</p>
<p>feeling wonderful the last six months</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been just wonderful started</p>
<p>gaining still feel great but just</p>
<p>gaining and I know that it&rsquo;s because of</p>
<p>the death of my dad but I was just</p>
<p>wondering is doing intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and adding that extra stress on my body</p>
<p>is that possibly what&rsquo;s going on and</p>
<p>then also if you could speak about left</p>
<p>shoulder pain sure okay so I have a</p>
<p>question six months ago you remember</p>
<p>when you started gaining weight right</p>
<p>okay was it dead I started yeah with add</p>
<p>a coincidence with adding in a minute</p>
<p>fasting or no I&rsquo;ve done intermittent</p>
<p>fasting no I did intermittent fasting</p>
<p>for like a year and a half now okay so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a new thing</p>
<p>no so the new thing is you lost your dad</p>
<p>correct okay yeah so that just kind of</p>
<p>narrows it down to the what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with cortisol and the adrenals and</p>
<p>stress so let&rsquo;s just talk about that you</p>
<p>know if we take all the stresses that</p>
<p>you can experience losses will hit the</p>
<p>adrenals damaged Reno&rsquo;s more than</p>
<p>physical trauma now if we take emotional</p>
<p>trauma or physical trauma</p>
<p>what really damages is that is the</p>
<p>suddenness of the shock someone telling</p>
<p>you very fast you know this verse is</p>
<p>kind of slowly easing in and letting you</p>
<p>kind of process it or even in a car</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting in the car and you get</p>
<p>rear-ended you don&rsquo;t even see the car</p>
<p>coming and next thing you know you wake</p>
<p>up in the hospital that is very very</p>
<p>serious stress versus you see the car</p>
<p>coming you&rsquo;re bracing yourself you get</p>
<p>hit that&rsquo;s much less of a stress so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really the shock of a loved one being</p>
<p>lost or the shock of being impacted what</p>
<p>that does to the adrenal is it it causes</p>
<p>the adrenal to raise cortisol cortisol</p>
<p>then releases insulin causes and bumps</p>
<p>you out of ketosis that&rsquo;s probably the</p>
<p>most likely cause so there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things you can do number one every</p>
<p>single day you have to do long hour</p>
<p>walks that&rsquo;s the type of exercise you</p>
<p>need long walks you&rsquo;re not listening to</p>
<p>the music you&rsquo;re not with anyone you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just getting space you&rsquo;re just looking</p>
<p>out there just getting your space okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s number one number two make sure</p>
<p>in your house you don&rsquo;t have too many</p>
<p>things reminding of your dad like</p>
<p>pictures on the wall because it just</p>
<p>kind of keeps it going number three you</p>
<p>want to make sure that you add another</p>
<p>hour of sleep do things enhance the</p>
<p>quality of sleep that you have now to</p>
<p>work on the physical adrenals you</p>
<p>probably already have my massage tool</p>
<p>but I would recommend doing acupressure</p>
<p>for the adrenal system</p>
<p>I would also nutritional recommend</p>
<p>product called adrenal and cortisol</p>
<p>relief I just released something called</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue advanced formula don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take that one that one&rsquo;s for a low</p>
<p>cortisol you have probably high cortisol</p>
<p>so that one is for more r3</p>
<p>this really burnt out people people that</p>
<p>have no more cortisol left you have too</p>
<p>much so those are some things that I</p>
<p>think that are going wrong I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>the problem is with your eating I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think in a minute fasten is going to be</p>
<p>more of a stress to you it takes stress</p>
<p>off the body especially if you do it</p>
<p>correctly and you&rsquo;re not hungry and you</p>
<p>lost your appetite and you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>great so I would keep in the things that</p>
<p>were successful but just focus on the</p>
<p>adrenal probably the acupressure is</p>
<p>going to be the most helpful to you all</p>
<p>right thanks Susan all right so then we</p>
<p>have a dori dori tah from Florida go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>good morning that&rsquo;s the work I love your</p>
<p>program and I have a question about the</p>
<p>nutritional eat type nutritionally I was</p>
<p>I find out I&rsquo;m allergic to eat a couple</p>
<p>years ago so I&rsquo;m wondering if I still</p>
<p>consume goats no personally I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>yeah yeah you&rsquo;re going to be you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to you&rsquo;re going to react to that</p>
<p>because you have an allergy to yeast</p>
<p>unfortunately you can&rsquo;t do the yeast so</p>
<p>now the problem is why you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get your B vitamins so you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to find some other sources non</p>
<p>yeast make sure they&rsquo;re natural you can</p>
<p>have to look at the label get the B</p>
<p>vitamins that are the cofactors they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called cofactor B vitamins but</p>
<p>unfortunately that&rsquo;s one source the</p>
<p>other source of B vitamins that are</p>
<p>really healthy believe it or not is</p>
<p>liver now you can do actual grass-fed</p>
<p>liver saute with onions or you can take</p>
<p>grass-fed liver pills to get your B</p>
<p>vitamins just a tip you don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>that but I&rsquo;m just trying to give you an</p>
<p>idea all right thanks for calling hate</p>
<p>Milan you sound familiar I think you</p>
<p>call before go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>yes thanks dr. Berg about two weeks ago</p>
<p>I came down with an a urinary tract</p>
<p>infection and while trying to fight the</p>
<p>infection I drank a lot of water with</p>
<p>your electrolyte powder in it and by the</p>
<p>end of the second day my kidneys started</p>
<p>hurting so I stopped taking the powder</p>
<p>and it went away you know after</p>
<p>a day so I was just wondering if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible to have like an overdose of</p>
<p>that electrolyte powder where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>too hard on your kidneys or something</p>
<p>good question so are you a hundred</p>
<p>percent sure that you had a UTI the</p>
<p>symptoms seemed to point that way I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go to a doctor because you know</p>
<p>have an aversion to doctors I did the de</p>
<p>Manos and cranberry juice and all that</p>
<p>stuff but I was drinking a lot of water</p>
<p>and also the electrolyte powder can you</p>
<p>tell me the symptoms yeah go ahead tell</p>
<p>me the size I so unable to control my</p>
<p>urine and you know so I had to stay real</p>
<p>close to the bathroom</p>
<p>burning and and that type of thing okay</p>
<p>and then of course I had like fever type</p>
<p>symptoms too or is just me I was down I</p>
<p>was sick okay did you have any type of</p>
<p>pain uh in your abdomen anywhere not not</p>
<p>not necessarily no not that I could</p>
<p>think of now was it was there any blood</p>
<p>in the urine</p>
<p>no not that I&rsquo;m aware of I did not see</p>
<p>any okay but it was sort of cloudy you</p>
<p>know like it gets with attract</p>
<p>infections the first one I&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>in my life so yeah my wife&rsquo;s had them in</p>
<p>so we sort of you know figured out what</p>
<p>it was yeah so so it&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>with electrolyte powder it has the thing</p>
<p>that it has that&rsquo;s different than other</p>
<p>electrolytes powers it has a lot of</p>
<p>potassium potassium is usually</p>
<p>protective on the kidney so typically</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily cause pain I mean I</p>
<p>guess you took massive amounts it could</p>
<p>but typically what that will do it tends</p>
<p>to flush the kidney it tends to help</p>
<p>clean stuff out of the kidney so maybe</p>
<p>it maybe was flushing something out but</p>
<p>the point I was going to make on some</p>
<p>people and this happens with the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet is there&rsquo;s issue with</p>
<p>stones kidney stones and when you start</p>
<p>a ketogenic diet when you do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>sometimes you can it could increase your</p>
<p>tendency to get stones</p>
<p>actually if you&rsquo;re doing some of the</p>
<p>foods like even too many nuts or spinach</p>
<p>things like that are chocolate that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even on Sweden some of those are high in</p>
<p>oxalic so either you can develop oxalate</p>
<p>stones or uric acid stones now what will</p>
<p>happen this symptoms from a urinary</p>
<p>tract infection are very similar</p>
<p>sometimes to stones I mean you can even</p>
<p>have a fever feel nauseous almost</p>
<p>vomiting from a kidney stone and what</p>
<p>happens is kind of at you but the thing</p>
<p>that kind of struck me that was</p>
<p>different is you didn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>abdominal pain like normally would have</p>
<p>within stone maybe because it can cause</p>
<p>back pain but it can also create all</p>
<p>sorts of problems with like if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>stone coming out and what happens is</p>
<p>what you want to take is electrolyte</p>
<p>power because of the amount of potassium</p>
<p>citrate that will literally dissolve the</p>
<p>stones and when it dissolve the stones</p>
<p>it can push crap out of the ureters and</p>
<p>the kidney into the bladder the key is</p>
<p>just drinking a little more water to</p>
<p>flush that thing out but it will help</p>
<p>dissolve stones the other thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting too is if you go for a jog</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re jogging and that stone is up</p>
<p>into the kidney and it&rsquo;s kind of sharp</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s bouncing up and down it can</p>
<p>create blood in your urine so that could</p>
<p>be a way that you have blood in here and</p>
<p>Orick started having symptoms that are</p>
<p>kind of weird so anyway that&rsquo;s just my</p>
<p>two cents I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what</p>
<p>happened but I hope that answered the</p>
<p>question that thanks for calling hey</p>
<p>Lisa you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Virginia Beach go ahead yes I did</p>
<p>question um just about a black cumin</p>
<p>seed oil yeah and I know it has a lot of</p>
<p>mega sick and mega three and mega nine</p>
<p>how good is that oil well black seed</p>
<p>black currant seed oil is awesome</p>
<p>awesome awesome</p>
<p>no cumin cumin seed oil cumin seed black</p>
<p>human feed okay well okay so that oil</p>
<p>black cumin seed oil is</p>
<p>mainly really good to get your</p>
<p>unsaturated fats which basically are</p>
<p>good for skin immune system also good</p>
<p>for the heart and providing more oxygen</p>
<p>they also help interact with calcium to</p>
<p>mobilize calcium and transport calcium</p>
<p>especially at people that get too much</p>
<p>Sun they can get sun intoxication if</p>
<p>they add that oil or any type of</p>
<p>unsaturated fatty acid oil like that</p>
<p>that will actually help protect them but</p>
<p>the other real big benefit is for</p>
<p>females and going through menopause</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know it sounds like you</p>
<p>could be going through something like</p>
<p>that I think that would be good for you</p>
<p>to take as well because it helps the</p>
<p>transition when a woman goes to</p>
<p>menopause they lose the function of</p>
<p>their ovaries and it puts more stress up</p>
<p>on the pituitary and we have this whole</p>
<p>hormonal stress so they do need more</p>
<p>oils they need more vitamin E they need</p>
<p>more nut oil seed oils so that also will</p>
<p>help you in the transition making going</p>
<p>through menopause so I would I would</p>
<p>recommend it I think it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>did you have another question about</p>
<p>fasting okay yeah is that all your</p>
<p>questions no I know it has a lot more</p>
<p>omega-6 than it has a mega three and</p>
<p>mega nine right so you want to offset</p>
<p>about that you want to add a little flax</p>
<p>oil to that to get to omega-3 or fish</p>
<p>alas all right yeah okay okay right</p>
<p>thank you thanks all right hey Kim</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Michigan go ahead hi dr.</p>
<p>Berg good morning morning nice to talk</p>
<p>with you I just I want to thank you</p>
<p>really quick for all that you do for</p>
<p>everyone I&rsquo;m down here about 15 15</p>
<p>minutes from Detroit and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>trying to search out an natural doctor</p>
<p>that would be supportive in helping me</p>
<p>keep my gallbladder every integrative</p>
<p>doctor I went to they said remove the</p>
<p>gallbladder because mine is full of</p>
<p>stones so I wondered if you have a</p>
<p>product or something you can suggest to</p>
<p>me of a way that I can keep my</p>
<p>gallbladder and get rid of all of the</p>
<p>stones because it is almost full</p>
<p>all okay all right so Kim let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>talk about that and again I have to say</p>
<p>this anything that I say anything I</p>
<p>recommend is not meant to curity medical</p>
<p>diseases probably check with your doctor</p>
<p>first this is just information food for</p>
<p>thought entertainment or data you can</p>
<p>present to your doc okay all right now</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing with the if your</p>
<p>gallbladder is completely filled it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bit of a borderline situation but</p>
<p>if you want to try to salvage that I</p>
<p>would start doing the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula in the gallbladder formula I</p>
<p>have it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s loaded with something</p>
<p>called purified bile salts that is the</p>
<p>very reason why you have stones in the</p>
<p>first place it&rsquo;s a deficiency of bile so</p>
<p>you want to start taking that it also</p>
<p>has stuff to lubricate the valve so the</p>
<p>bile can still get through from the</p>
<p>gallbladder to the small intestine it</p>
<p>has stone root to help dissolve stones</p>
<p>as Petain hundred Lord has a whole bunch</p>
<p>of things to help with stone and I would</p>
<p>take probably two of those after a meal</p>
<p>I would also take the opposite of</p>
<p>vinegar Plus that I have because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to acidify your stomach to</p>
<p>increase your release of your own bile</p>
<p>through the liver without the Petain</p>
<p>without a strong acid stomach you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>release bile so we need a combination of</p>
<p>stomach and gallbladder the other thing</p>
<p>you need to do during the as far as</p>
<p>during the day is at least one a nice</p>
<p>blended shake with kale with beet tops</p>
<p>and parsley and maybe a cup of berries</p>
<p>okay and you blend it up with water</p>
<p>drink that that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to need is to really support that liver</p>
<p>to start flushing out some of these</p>
<p>stones and start dissolving the stones I</p>
<p>would get an ultrasound I would test an</p>
<p>ultrasound every six weeks to make sure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re shrinking and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>backing anything up your diet is going</p>
<p>to have to be absolutely perfect I</p>
<p>highly recommend in a minute fasting</p>
<p>because in a minute fasting is something</p>
<p>that will cause less eating less</p>
<p>aggravation to the gallbladder and more</p>
<p>concentration of bile itself so do those</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll be quite happy hey guys</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to take just a couple second</p>
<p>a couple minute break and we&rsquo;ll be right</p>
<p>back after these short messages from my</p>
<p>no message commercial thanks</p>
<p>okay guys we are back for that short</p>
<p>break that short commercial break that</p>
<p>was pretty much no commercial hey Jill</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from North</p>
<p>Carolina go ahead hey dr. Berg I take</p>
<p>all your take all your supplements I</p>
<p>have for about a year and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>transitioning into intermittent fasting</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing it for a couple of weeks</p>
<p>um and I had watched your video on what</p>
<p>to drink that&rsquo;s appropriate for</p>
<p>intermittent fasting in the morning and</p>
<p>I wanted to find out is it is it okay to</p>
<p>do your organic raw wheatgrass juice in</p>
<p>the morning and it not kick you out of</p>
<p>your fast and I also do maca powder and</p>
<p>noni powder if you know anything about</p>
<p>those is it okay to do those in the</p>
<p>morning and is it okay to do those on</p>
<p>ketogenic great Thanks thanks for your</p>
<p>question so yeah absolutely I do the</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder I mean the</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a lot of sugar it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s mixed in a what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a liquid it&rsquo;s a drink it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>seriously concentrated nutrient infused</p>
<p>drink that you can you can do and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking like a teaspoon it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to bump you go to ketosis I take it as a</p>
<p>multivitamin mineral trace mineral amino</p>
<p>acid everything and that&rsquo;s my vitamin so</p>
<p>you mix it with water a teaspoon it will</p>
<p>not bump you out of ketosis it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good thing you can also add your</p>
<p>maca powder and your no need powder not</p>
<p>a problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a powerful antioxidants nothing to</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>and just one point about that the one</p>
<p>teaspoon is equivalent to one tray of</p>
<p>wheatgrass</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s actually a very very good thing</p>
<p>to take when you&rsquo;re enjoying a minute</p>
<p>fasting and ketosis because it allows</p>
<p>more of a cleansing effect to decrease</p>
<p>any type of potential for bad breath</p>
<p>that you might get from the all the</p>
<p>waste products coming off of the body so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a purify or a detoxifier but mainly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s for the nutrition</p>
<p>for your skin and it&rsquo;s like kind of a</p>
<p>substitute for coffee because it will</p>
<p>bring your energy up so I would</p>
<p>definitely recommend it okay thanks</p>
<p>hey Denise you&rsquo;re on the air from</p>
<p>Mississippi hey dr. bird</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing the ketosis for about</p>
<p>three weeks now and I started doing an</p>
<p>intermittent fasting the last week and a</p>
<p>half I was thinking about adding the</p>
<p>wheatgrass powder but I am on coumadin</p>
<p>for factor v Laden and with it being</p>
<p>dark green I don&rsquo;t know is that</p>
<p>something that does have a lot of that</p>
<p>vitamin K where it would interact with</p>
<p>coumadin yeah good question yeah it is</p>
<p>loaded with vitamin K so some people</p>
<p>what they do is they just take one</p>
<p>teaspoon and they get with their doctor</p>
<p>to adjust the dosages of chromatin</p>
<p>unfortunately cumin is an a vitamin k</p>
<p>blocker and so it&rsquo;s there because</p>
<p>vitamin K is a clotting factor so they</p>
<p>doctors don&rsquo;t want you taking it so I</p>
<p>would just check with your doctor said</p>
<p>listen if I take this can I just raise</p>
<p>the curtain a little bit and keep taking</p>
<p>because the benefits of wheatgrass are</p>
<p>huge but if not then you can&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so loaded with vitamin K I</p>
<p>mean it is the vitamin K product</p>
<p>unfortunately there&rsquo;s a video I did on</p>
<p>all the foods that you can consume that</p>
<p>low in vitamin K so you might want to</p>
<p>search out that video I think it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>search dr. Bergin kuma Tim thanks Denise</p>
<p>okay Jonathan you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Oregon</p>
<p>thanks hermit butter burger I have to</p>
<p>simple I hope questions for you but</p>
<p>quite diverse one is to do with</p>
<p>potassium and I started taking some</p>
<p>potassium tablets five of them but I</p>
<p>noticed that that&rsquo;s about 10% of the</p>
<p>daily recommended dose and I just</p>
<p>thought to myself any recommendations of</p>
<p>foods that might be rich in potassium</p>
<p>and I could you use food rather than</p>
<p>top-end on that side that&rsquo;s question</p>
<p>one in question - Jonathan you clicked</p>
<p>off can you hear me okay I can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>hear you but I&rsquo;m just going to answer</p>
<p>the question so I don&rsquo;t know your second</p>
<p>question but I can see it&rsquo;s cycling</p>
<p>versus walking so maybe I&rsquo;ll just guess</p>
<p>on that but the first question is how do</p>
<p>you get your potassium from food and</p>
<p>this is I do a lot of videos on this</p>
<p>what you need to do is you need to</p>
<p>consume seven to ten cups of vegetables</p>
<p>as your base okay now you can get also a</p>
<p>potassium that might not even hit your</p>
<p>your maximum potassium but your other</p>
<p>foods that you eat even protein will</p>
<p>give you potassium chicken fish beef</p>
<p>like a serving of that well it&rsquo;s 300</p>
<p>milligrams potassium believe it or not</p>
<p>so that will add to you their nuts will</p>
<p>add more potassium but if you want to</p>
<p>get a lot of potassium you want to do</p>
<p>beet tops beet tops kale make the shake</p>
<p>with a little bit of berries with water</p>
<p>blended up you will get some serious</p>
<p>potassium from that I mean a lot but</p>
<p>basically you have to start eating more</p>
<p>vegetables okay now the question about</p>
<p>cycling versus walking I think you need</p>
<p>a combination of both I do cycling I</p>
<p>brought my bike everyday it doesn&rsquo;t rain</p>
<p>and snows but I will do biking I do</p>
<p>sprints and then I&rsquo;ll coast back and</p>
<p>forth I just love it and then I also do</p>
<p>a lot of walks I mean maybe not every</p>
<p>single day but I will go on a 45-minute</p>
<p>walk almost every single day and just</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s different than my workout it</p>
<p>might be just before or after I do the</p>
<p>other biking but I really do well on</p>
<p>those walks so I would recommend both</p>
<p>hey Kristin you&rsquo;re from Tennessee go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air Kristin okay</p>
<p>Kristin we&rsquo;ll come back to you let me</p>
<p>just make sure okay can you hear me from</p>
<p>Dallas okay so let&rsquo;s take a one-minute</p>
<p>break sorry about this we&rsquo;ll come right</p>
<p>back and one</p>
<p>minute</p>
<p>all right hey Kirsten can you hear me</p>
<p>Kristen all right</p>
<p>Kristen you can&rsquo;t hear me right now so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to figure that out let me</p>
<p>see if KK can you hear me now yeah so we</p>
<p>basically have a little technical</p>
<p>difficulty apparently the internet a</p>
<p>little bit slow unfortunately but tell</p>
<p>you what just we&rsquo;re going to do one more</p>
<p>break okay I want to try to fix this</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go away I&rsquo;ll be right back</p>
<p>hey guys hey listen we&rsquo;re just still</p>
<p>trying to figure out this Darrin phone</p>
<p>thing but in the meantime let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>the board and do a little presentation</p>
<p>here because I have another board under</p>
<p>camera that we can actually continue</p>
<p>give you a little more education anyway</p>
<p>one thing I wanted to point out and I</p>
<p>just created a video on this is a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all been a lot of confusion on</p>
<p>using your own like your blood tests</p>
<p>your urine test and to be able to</p>
<p>analyze those so in the next probably I</p>
<p>guess two weeks I&rsquo;m going to be creating</p>
<p>a lot of videos on that topic but if you</p>
<p>take a look at it you know you drive a</p>
<p>car you have a dashboard you have the</p>
<p>gas pedal you have the overheating</p>
<p>indicator you have the fuel gauge of the</p>
<p>speedometer you have all these</p>
<p>indicators that you can allow you drive</p>
<p>your car right so you and you want to</p>
<p>use those as feedback to see if things</p>
<p>are working right and what happens is in</p>
<p>medicine we also have indicators we have</p>
<p>a1c which is the average blood sugars</p>
<p>for three months you have blood sugars</p>
<p>sugars so this should be like five or</p>
<p>less blood sugar should be a hundred or</p>
<p>less and then you have blood pressure</p>
<p>120 over 80</p>
<p>you have pulse rate that should be 72</p>
<p>you have temperature which should be</p>
<p>ninety eight point six C of all these</p>
<p>indicators that give you feedback to</p>
<p>know if your body is working correctly</p>
<p>the problem with medicine is they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>use these indicators to see why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>abnormal they don&rsquo;t look at what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behind what they represent they may</p>
<p>basically treat the indicator they treat</p>
<p>the dashboard speedometer like for</p>
<p>example your a1c is high they give you a</p>
<p>drug high blood pressure there&rsquo;s a drug</p>
<p>high pulse rate a drug a fever an</p>
<p>aspirin that is the problem</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t use these indicators as</p>
<p>clues in polling a string so what we</p>
<p>want to do is we want to realize that</p>
<p>these are indicators these are symptoms</p>
<p>but the problem is they&rsquo;re not very</p>
<p>profitable to find out the real reason</p>
<p>and corrected the real profit is keeping</p>
<p>these things confused and managed so you</p>
<p>can be on that pill and that&rsquo;s why they</p>
<p>kind of design these medications to last</p>
<p>24 hours so that you can keep taking</p>
<p>them so it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s like very very</p>
<p>expensive to get help get people healthy</p>
<p>nowadays puts a lot of people out of</p>
<p>jobs but anyway I mentioned really</p>
<p>interesting on a recent video on LDL</p>
<p>that being bad cholesterol and and when</p>
<p>you go on a ketogenic diet or you go on</p>
<p>intermittent fasting sometimes your LDL</p>
<p>will go higher and that freaks people</p>
<p>out and so like oh my gosh my</p>
<p>cholesterol my bad cholesterol is going</p>
<p>up LDL is the cholesterol going from the</p>
<p>liver to the arteries okay in the cells</p>
<p>HDL the good cholesterol is from the</p>
<p>cells or your arteries back to the liver</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re really not bad or good so</p>
<p>LDL is just an indicator that your body</p>
<p>is requiring more cholesterol in the</p>
<p>cells and the arteries for some reason</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s really two types there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pattern a and there&rsquo;s pattern B pattern</p>
<p>a is like the large buoyant fluffy</p>
<p>cholesterol that&rsquo;s not LDL that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessarily to worry about because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just floating through the body and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>required by themselves pattern B is the</p>
<p>real small little cholesterol very dense</p>
<p>that can get into the cells and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>involved in the clotting mechanism and</p>
<p>repair action and so when you have high</p>
<p>LDL s you don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t differentiate</p>
<p>a from B it&rsquo;s basically telling you the</p>
<p>combat combination so if you have more a</p>
<p>than B then that&rsquo;s normal and you might</p>
<p>be on a medic</p>
<p>agent for no reason so the question is</p>
<p>how do you determine if you have more a</p>
<p>than B or more B than a what you do is</p>
<p>you look at your triglycerides that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the blood fat if the triglycerides are</p>
<p>high and the HDL is low then that means</p>
<p>that you have more B okay so B would be</p>
<p>high triglycerides low HDL okay so</p>
<p>really honestly all you really need to</p>
<p>do is make sure your triglycerides are</p>
<p>normal or low and your HDL s are high or</p>
<p>normal okay and then you have to worry</p>
<p>about it because that means that your</p>
<p>body is is it&rsquo;s not the bad type of</p>
<p>cholesterol it&rsquo;s not even bad it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the cholesterol that&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>any type of repair at that point if your</p>
<p>LDL is high and your triglycerides are</p>
<p>normal or low I&rsquo;ll just put a decrease</p>
<p>here and your HCL&rsquo;s are normal or or</p>
<p>high then you have the a and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really matter how much LDL you have even</p>
<p>if your cholesterol is real high it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter because think about it</p>
<p>when you are losing weight okay a fat</p>
<p>cell is composed of triglycerides and</p>
<p>cholesterol so you&rsquo;re burning all these</p>
<p>triglycerides but you don&rsquo;t burn</p>
<p>cholesterol it&rsquo;s not burn so that</p>
<p>cholesterol has to release from the fat</p>
<p>cells well guess what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>to your blood you&rsquo;re going to have high</p>
<p>levels of cholesterol so you have high</p>
<p>levels of cholesterol because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming out of the fat cell through the</p>
<p>liver through the gallbladder being</p>
<p>dismantled by bile that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>we want that to go out of the body so</p>
<p>anything extra you buy to either recycle</p>
<p>or get rid of so that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to freak out with this cholesterol</p>
<p>problem really the only danger is that</p>
<p>you have high B and what causes high B</p>
<p>is sugar high insulin refined</p>
<p>carbohydrates mainly</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re doing the right evening</p>
<p>plan you&rsquo;re going to be fine you have to</p>
<p>worry about it the benefit of in a</p>
<p>minute fasting is that you don&rsquo;t spike</p>
<p>insulin you actually eat less frequent</p>
<p>you keep insulin low you heal insulin</p>
<p>and the cholesterol eventually goes down</p>
<p>because everything starts healing</p>
<p>because what happens is like</p>
<p>carbohydrates that you eat convert to</p>
<p>cholesterol insulin turns sugar in to</p>
<p>cholesterol and triglycerides okay so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing and then the other</p>
<p>point I was going to make is the purpose</p>
<p>of cholesterol and I have a whole video</p>
<p>series on this I think it&rsquo;s like four</p>
<p>different series the purpose of</p>
<p>cholesterol is to help heal and we&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>back to the camera now well is to help</p>
<p>heal the body of any type of lesions</p>
<p>provide for steroid health provide for</p>
<p>cell membrane material and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>necessary thing and your body makes</p>
<p>303,000 cap milligrams every single day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of cholesterol so people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize that they need that</p>
<p>cholesterol alright let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see if</p>
<p>this works now Margie you&rsquo;re from Denver</p>
<p>go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air okay</p>
<p>hi dr. Burdine I&rsquo;ve been taking your</p>
<p>products for over a year or two now and</p>
<p>my question is what would you recommend</p>
<p>for dry skin my face is super dry yeah</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s a really good question</p>
<p>Margie what you should take you need you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need more water you need more oils</p>
<p>you need I would take a combination of</p>
<p>flax oil and maybe chia seed oil okay</p>
<p>start taking that and maybe even fish</p>
<p>oils but those oils are the oils that</p>
<p>you need to make the skin less dry okay</p>
<p>good question now Elaine you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>air you&rsquo;re from Virginia go ahead hey</p>
<p>dr. Berg like the only Nielson here and</p>
<p>suck hard jigna oh hey I&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>good news for</p>
<p>riah but I&rsquo;m happy guess why why because</p>
<p>for the first time in a year I woke up</p>
<p>with no pain I&rsquo;ve had an impingement or</p>
<p>for the past year and so it makes</p>
<p>working out hard</p>
<p>Wow but I have some some good news for</p>
<p>you and I have a question for you okay</p>
<p>one is I&rsquo;ve been using the electrolyte</p>
<p>powder with the wheatgrass lemon uh-huh</p>
<p>and I put it in the blender with some</p>
<p>lettuce like a huge handful of lettuce</p>
<p>okay and I put two scoops of each add a</p>
<p>little bit of water in ice and that</p>
<p>makes the best smoothie and then my</p>
<p>energy is just off the charts Wow okay</p>
<p>so what kind of lettuce want them to</p>
<p>know that I made a small video because</p>
<p>people have been asking me about put it</p>
<p>on my youtube not YouTube but um</p>
<p>Facebook page it&rsquo;s like maybe a minute</p>
<p>long 30 seconds something like that but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s in there and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all I need to get me through the</p>
<p>day so you put lettuces and like regular</p>
<p>lettuce it&rsquo;s uh the spring to spring</p>
<p>that I never thought about that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great idea I&rsquo;ll have to see that video</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s huge and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>fistful and so I&rsquo;m getting everything I</p>
<p>need Wow great so for some of the</p>
<p>supplements I take but here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing up because I&rsquo;m really psyched</p>
<p>about this okay so I&rsquo;m really going to</p>
<p>be hitting it hard now with my</p>
<p>exercising because I really haven&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>anything of two months okay just because</p>
<p>of the shoulder I mean I really had to</p>
<p>take it easy</p>
<p>but anyway so here&rsquo;s the question when I</p>
<p>take my supplement and I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting um when is the best</p>
<p>time to take these supplements yeah good</p>
<p>question Alain let me just answer that</p>
<p>now typically most the supplements don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to be taken with food unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking something that&rsquo;s related to</p>
<p>digestion like the gall bladder formula</p>
<p>so all the other ones could be taken</p>
<p>anytime now if you take any type of fat</p>
<p>soluble products like vitamin D vitamin</p>
<p>k2 d3 k - that type of thing those must</p>
<p>be taken with like a meal like when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating some fat okay so because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fat soluble but most of the</p>
<p>vitamins it really doesn&rsquo;t make a big</p>
<p>difference so take them</p>
<p>anytime unless so related to digestion</p>
<p>thanks for your question I&rsquo;m looking</p>
<p>forward to watching that video - hey k</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from Dallas hi</p>
<p>dr. Berg hi I love you I love your</p>
<p>product I haven&rsquo;t been able to sleep for</p>
<p>years and years and my nasal congestion</p>
<p>is a big problem that I have experienced</p>
<p>watching all your videos and taking the</p>
<p>cortisol and the day and the night has</p>
<p>helped a lot and even changing all my</p>
<p>night I&rsquo;m a vegetarian</p>
<p>I eat between 6 &amp; 7 and it had helped me</p>
<p>a lot a lot but the left side of my</p>
<p>nasal cavity</p>
<p>I still struggle and I had I have had</p>
<p>breathing problems like struggle</p>
<p>breathing because I don&rsquo;t sleep I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been sleeping well but I now</p>
<p>with these products it has helped and I</p>
<p>have slept well in last couple of weeks</p>
<p>but the cavity the nasal cavity is still</p>
<p>life and I have used nasal drop for</p>
<p>years and years and years and last two</p>
<p>weeks some nights I haven&rsquo;t used I feel</p>
<p>good about that I have slept well but</p>
<p>the nasal cavity is still there</p>
<p>sometimes not every day but some day so</p>
<p>is there any advice on there sure let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk about that cake couple things one</p>
<p>is that you want to do a neti pot with a</p>
<p>little bit of garlic a little bit of</p>
<p>garlic juice in there and oregano oil</p>
<p>those two are really good antifungal and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll go up in there and then I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>help that the other thing is I just</p>
<p>created a video I didn&rsquo;t release it yet</p>
<p>on a a really amazing thing for your</p>
<p>sinuses and your lungs for a mucus and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically called a salt inhaler</p>
<p>search it on Amazon and get one they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very inexpensive they&rsquo;re a little</p>
<p>inhaler you take this little looks like</p>
<p>a neti pot and you put salt in there sea</p>
<p>salt in the bottom and it breathes</p>
<p>because it has holes in it and you</p>
<p>breathe it in through your mouth and you</p>
<p>let it out to your nose and what happens</p>
<p>all these ions from 84 to 90</p>
<p>we trace minerals go into the system and</p>
<p>dissolve as an antibacterial the mucus</p>
<p>and the fungus and they make it so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very a natural way to be able to open up</p>
<p>your passages and breathe and especially</p>
<p>before bed you would do this for about</p>
<p>5-10 minutes make sure you just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>breathe like too deeply because you</p>
<p>might get hyperventilate you just want</p>
<p>to breathe normal and just let it get</p>
<p>through the whole system the lungs and</p>
<p>the sinuses you&rsquo;re going to sleep really</p>
<p>good when you do that because it&rsquo;ll help</p>
<p>you with with congestion anywhere in the</p>
<p>respiratory and it&rsquo;s great for people</p>
<p>with sleep apnea so go ahead and get one</p>
<p>is called a salt flush okay</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s called the salt inhaler that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right use the Himalayan salt and it</p>
<p>comes in a kit thanks Kay hey Dale</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from Orlando um</p>
<p>hi dr. Berg thanks for taking my call</p>
<p>sure but for the longest time I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>getting some very severe cramps in my</p>
<p>calf at night and I have I think that</p>
<p>most days I eat the quantity of</p>
<p>vegetables that you suggest I also take</p>
<p>400 milligrams of magnesium glycinate</p>
<p>every night before bed about three weeks</p>
<p>ago I added your adrenal night formula</p>
<p>and your wheatgrass and your</p>
<p>electrolytes powder which I do two</p>
<p>wheatgrass and electrolyte during the</p>
<p>day I heard once that you occasionally</p>
<p>recommend calcium for calf cramp these</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t eased up on me and I was just</p>
<p>wondering of what you would suggest give</p>
<p>it a good question down so you had to</p>
<p>think about these these muscle cramps</p>
<p>typically it&rsquo;s potassium or magnesium</p>
<p>okay and you&rsquo;re taking the electrolyte</p>
<p>power that shouldn&rsquo;t get rid of that</p>
<p>because those electrolytes are involved</p>
<p>in the muscle contraction relaxation but</p>
<p>calcium is another it&rsquo;s also in there in</p>
<p>small amounts but calcium could be</p>
<p>another reason why you you&rsquo;re twitching</p>
<p>or even sodium so it could be one of</p>
<p>them you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>hit it eventually but you may want to</p>
<p>just try some calcium and see if it goes</p>
<p>away calcium citrate that&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>electrolytes but it&rsquo;s not as much my</p>
<p>electrolyte powder is heavy on the</p>
<p>potassium which is the most common</p>
<p>reason but now let&rsquo;s say you do all</p>
<p>these things and the twitching still</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go away then we know your pH is</p>
<p>off and we need to add outside of</p>
<p>vinegar to acidify you to mobilize these</p>
<p>electrolytes but go ahead and try some</p>
<p>calcium and see if it doesn&rsquo;t zap it and</p>
<p>make a go bye-bye and it&rsquo;s rare but that</p>
<p>could be a common thing okay hey thanks</p>
<p>for your call hey Andrea you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Illinois go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>Audrey oh um Audrey yeah hi dr. Burke um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having like severe bloating</p>
<p>after like I ingest pretty much anything</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one reason I switched even</p>
<p>just once a day um I don&rsquo;t know what is</p>
<p>causing it I I was taking the apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar plus but after I ran out I</p>
<p>started doing the tablespoon of apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar and water 30 minutes</p>
<p>before my meal and I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>nutritional yeast about a tablespoon and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been adding the radishes because I</p>
<p>heard that root vegetables are good for</p>
<p>digestion so I&rsquo;m just kind of stumped on</p>
<p>what the problem is because I I blowed</p>
<p>up and I end up looking like nine months</p>
<p>pregnant okay ha you said you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>just one today yeah okay and you&rsquo;re but</p>
<p>you bloated after that now question do</p>
<p>you have constipation no okay</p>
<p>are you eating a lot of vegetables that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t normally eat uh no actually</p>
<p>the only vegetables I really eat are</p>
<p>just salad and radishes okay I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have much Christopher is really okay is</p>
<p>there any food that you know is more</p>
<p>bloating than other foods no actually</p>
<p>anything will bloat me like even if I</p>
<p>have like a bulletproof coffee in the</p>
<p>morning that old that&rsquo;ll do it yeah okay</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the thing there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;re doing the right</p>
<p>thing without soda vinegar and some</p>
<p>people they have something called</p>
<p>hypochloride ria which is just low</p>
<p>stomach acids and they need to take more</p>
<p>of the outside of vinegar plus and some</p>
<p>people i mean you might even have to</p>
<p>take five with a meal just to start to</p>
<p>acidify you so you can start to work and</p>
<p>then also add the gall bladder formula</p>
<p>which is the bile after the meal to add</p>
<p>that I mean that&rsquo;s the main one that</p>
<p>handles bloating is the gall bladder</p>
<p>formula I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>that but that&rsquo;s something that I would</p>
<p>highly recommend so let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example you do that and it works great</p>
<p>good problem solved you take it over a</p>
<p>period of time and then you might not</p>
<p>need it after that because your body has</p>
<p>adjusted but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>bloating okay then I would look at</p>
<p>building up your floor out your good</p>
<p>bacteria in your gut to help you with</p>
<p>bloating let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;re still bloating</p>
<p>then I would check for food allergies</p>
<p>and make sure that there&rsquo;s no nothing</p>
<p>that is that you&rsquo;re allergic to that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating a problem okay and so those are</p>
<p>things that you can do as a quick quick</p>
<p>tip but that should help all right</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re doing once a day</p>
<p>because that will give you a system a</p>
<p>chance to reset hey Jackie you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Miami go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>hey dr. Berg thank you so much for</p>
<p>taking my call oh my goodness I am</p>
<p>trying to get a grasp on this</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and three meals a</p>
<p>day no snacking concept for I&rsquo;m you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 53</p>
<p>for the past I mean before I turned 50</p>
<p>that is I was able to manage my weight I</p>
<p>felt great with eating every three hours</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what they would tell us</p>
<p>for a fast metabolism if you don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>every three hours you&rsquo;re going to kick</p>
<p>yours are going to kill your metabolism</p>
<p>some kind of freaking out yeah so okay</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>I just want to make sure yeah I just</p>
<p>want to make sure that my I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>killing my metabolism okay I&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>to the board and explain this okay so</p>
<p>check this out this is a very important</p>
<p>thing here</p>
<p>very important intimate of fasting is</p>
<p>probably one of the most powerful tools</p>
<p>you can eat and conventionally the</p>
<p>traditional diets say eat every three</p>
<p>hours right wow that&rsquo;s one way to create</p>
<p>diabetes three hours I mean if you think</p>
<p>about it our bodies were not designed to</p>
<p>eat that frequent and so every time and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the data every time you eat you</p>
<p>spike insulin okay</p>
<p>diabetes is too much insulin</p>
<p>pre-diabetic is too much insulin too</p>
<p>much insulin will create insulin</p>
<p>resistance which is a pre-diabetic so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you eat you spike you spike</p>
<p>insulin insulin comes in there and</p>
<p>pushes your blood sugars down now you</p>
<p>end up with a little bit of a lower</p>
<p>blood sugar guess what you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be hungry you&rsquo;re going to have more</p>
<p>appetite to eat more so eating makes you</p>
<p>more hungry it slows your metabolism</p>
<p>because it raises insulin if you want to</p>
<p>lose weight you have to lower insulin so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s false data that you need to eat</p>
<p>every three three days it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>worst advice I mean take a look at a</p>
<p>sumo wrestler what do they do the fat</p>
<p>themselves they eat three every like two</p>
<p>hours okay it&rsquo;s a great way to gain</p>
<p>unhealthy fat so you go from every three</p>
<p>hours to three meals a day that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first goal no snacks how do you do it</p>
<p>you add more fat at the end of the meal</p>
<p>to go longer okay you do that until your</p>
<p>body feels comfortable with that then</p>
<p>you take it one step further than you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat in the morning until you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hungry and you try to go for hours in</p>
<p>the morning and till your first meal do</p>
<p>that for a while until you feel</p>
<p>comfortable you&rsquo;re adapting to that what</p>
<p>are you eating at this point you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating your own fat because you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the fast okay Suzie you&rsquo;re going to know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be hungry it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>throw out the fast but you want to keep</p>
<p>going until you can go all the way in to</p>
<p>the point where like you might not eat</p>
<p>until 12:00</p>
<p>like 11 or 12 and that&rsquo;s your first meal</p>
<p>okay is that bad no it&rsquo;s good and then</p>
<p>you can you can then eat and the</p>
<p>eight-hour window okay or and then start</p>
<p>shortening until you have like five hour</p>
<p>window and then a four hour window so</p>
<p>now you get to the situation where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you have a four hour window of</p>
<p>eating doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re grazing all</p>
<p>the time but you&rsquo;re eating within that</p>
<p>period of time then you&rsquo;ve got a 20 a 20</p>
<p>hour fasting period can you imagine</p>
<p>fasting for 20 hours what that does to</p>
<p>growth hormone belly fat weight loss</p>
<p>brain cells it actually increases brain</p>
<p>cells so I&rsquo;ll go back over here</p>
<p>neurogenesis is I mean fast intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and fasting will cause</p>
<p>neurogenesis which is an increase of</p>
<p>your brain cells incredible so I hope</p>
<p>that helped Jackie hey Christian you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the air you&rsquo;re from Nashville go</p>
<p>ahead yeah hi dr. Bowen so happy to talk</p>
<p>to you I&rsquo;m so thankful for all your</p>
<p>videos you&rsquo;ve taught me so much and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>read your book and I&rsquo;ve been on this</p>
<p>health journey for about six years but I</p>
<p>have a lot of back and neck problems but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve gotten so much better but my</p>
<p>biggest question is today is I have this</p>
<p>foot that just hurts all the time now it</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t seem to go away and it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the middle of my left foot on the top</p>
<p>part like if you came up the top of my</p>
<p>foot right in the middle and it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>more on the side where my two toes are</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s calm outside and it just aches</p>
<p>and aches and aches and I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>rested it up propped it up I just I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing wrong I take</p>
<p>lots of vitamins I take lots of healthy</p>
<p>foods and um I don&rsquo;t eat sugar and I</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t know where to go from here</p>
<p>okay there&rsquo;s two two things for that</p>
<p>number one in some cases with doing</p>
<p>heated diet and intermittent fasting you</p>
<p>can have high levels of uric acid that</p>
<p>could be coming coming in from the</p>
<p>kidney and that can create foot pain in</p>
<p>that area possibly so it could be uric</p>
<p>acid if that&rsquo;s the case then all you do</p>
<p>is you</p>
<p>more potassium citrate the electrolyte</p>
<p>stuff you may be takin that already that</p>
<p>might flush it out secondly the other</p>
<p>thing that you want to do is take some</p>
<p>have someone do this or you do it in</p>
<p>massage the opposite calf okay not the</p>
<p>same side the calf and you go up into</p>
<p>your Achilles tendon into the back of</p>
<p>the calf and massage it&rsquo;s kind of hard</p>
<p>to do on yourself but you could do like</p>
<p>a little roller or a massage - or</p>
<p>something like that but you want to work</p>
<p>that calf out it&rsquo;s going to be really</p>
<p>tender keep working the calf out and</p>
<p>what will happen is the pain will go</p>
<p>away on the left side so you always work</p>
<p>on the opposite side but in your case to</p>
<p>fix the foot you work on the opposite</p>
<p>calf and that should make the pain go</p>
<p>away all right so it&rsquo;s pretty actually</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be amazed I wish we you were here</p>
<p>we can do the demo but thanks for</p>
<p>calling hey Jeanette you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>you are from Cleveland go ahead you are</p>
<p>the last caller go ahead to questions</p>
<p>where you want potatoes to internment</p>
<p>fasting and the other to the ACV drink</p>
<p>intermittent fasting I&rsquo;m new to it and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading conflicting information</p>
<p>about it I just wanted to know pretty</p>
<p>much in a nutshell is there a guideline</p>
<p>as far as women doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting versus men in the the non eating</p>
<p>hours good did you have any other</p>
<p>questions on that that&rsquo;s it for the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and then the</p>
<p>questions pertaining to apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar is there a guideline as far as</p>
<p>maybe 15-20 minutes before a meal or</p>
<p>just first thing in the morning or the</p>
<p>last thing at night when to take it okay</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>well the opposite of vinegar drinks</p>
<p>should be I like to take it with the</p>
<p>meal right right at the meal right</p>
<p>before it doesn&rsquo;t have to be five</p>
<p>minutes before it could be right during</p>
<p>but right before is fine now as far as</p>
<p>in a minute fasting between men and</p>
<p>women there&rsquo;s really no information on</p>
<p>one versus the other as far as anything</p>
<p>special but the pattern it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to affect your hormones I mean if you</p>
<p>have this</p>
<p>certain pattern of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>versus some other pattern and I know</p>
<p>there is some data out there but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not really based on anything other than</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s opinion which I totally</p>
<p>disagree with but the point within a</p>
<p>minute fasting is that there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>things one is it&rsquo;s incredibly beneficial</p>
<p>for your health for brain regenerating</p>
<p>nerve cells losing weight fixing insulin</p>
<p>helping diabetes all that stuff and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s really good but the problem with</p>
<p>it is that people jump into it a little</p>
<p>too fast because they&rsquo;re not ready for</p>
<p>it they&rsquo;re going too fast you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to crash and burn with your blood</p>
<p>Sugar&rsquo;s so you want to first go to three</p>
<p>meals a day and some people can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>do that but the way you do it is you add</p>
<p>more fat with a meal and you do that</p>
<p>until you can do it comfortably with no</p>
<p>hunger and note no blood sugar symptoms</p>
<p>okay so that might take some weeks then</p>
<p>you take it one step further and in the</p>
<p>morning if you&rsquo;re not hungry you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat so you try to go longer and longer</p>
<p>and longer so you get up and you wait an</p>
<p>hour two three four five and to you you</p>
<p>can go longer and longer in the morning</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not hungry okay and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be your size you&rsquo;ll see after like a</p>
<p>period of time you&rsquo;re like wow I&rsquo;m not I</p>
<p>have no hunger no appetite and I can go</p>
<p>longer okay and then as soon as you</p>
<p>start eating then you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>hungry so now and then you eat and then</p>
<p>you have this window of eating like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you start with eight hours you</p>
<p>have your three meals so you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>doing three meals but you&rsquo;re shortening</p>
<p>them to eight hours okay and then you</p>
<p>shorten them to seven hours then you</p>
<p>shorten them to six five and four will</p>
<p>be the ultimate so now you have 20 hours</p>
<p>of fasting and 4 hours of eating window</p>
<p>now why am I saying that that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>thing to work up to if you really want</p>
<p>to have the full benefits some people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to go to that level some</p>
<p>people eat within a five-hour window</p>
<p>sometimes six and they are totally fine</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re comfortable and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to lose as much weight or they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to improve that much health</p>
<p>but the point is that if you do this</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find you like all of a</p>
<p>sudden your hunger goes away your</p>
<p>appetite goes away your body&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>fish</p>
<p>your muscles do better everything does</p>
<p>better but you won&rsquo;t know it until you</p>
<p>do it so it&rsquo;s kind of like something</p>
<p>that you have to experience it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>gonna give you your fork feeling okay so</p>
<p>you should try it thanks for your column</p>
<p>Jeanette hey you guys I want to thank</p>
<p>you for your patience and your questions</p>
<p>you know what let&rsquo;s talk next week</p>
<p>Friday same time and look forward to</p>
<p>talking to you thank you so much</p>
