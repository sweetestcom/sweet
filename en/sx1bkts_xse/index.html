<p>started there&rsquo;s a lot of people signing</p>

<p>have any questions feel free to ask me</p>
<p>so let me see here not hearing anything</p>
<p>with computer speakers need to call in</p>
<p>yeah you need some speakers on your</p>
<p>computer or some type of headphone</p>
<p>probably to hear me okay good so yeah</p>
<p>this will be cool so I want to talk</p>
<p>about debugging very stubborn weight</p>
<p>loss so I&rsquo;ll be asking you questions and</p>
<p>because I want to help you but I want to</p>
<p>give you a little background of some</p>
<p>insights that I&rsquo;m finding I&rsquo;m writing a</p>
<p>new book and the title of the book is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s healthy lose weight not lose weight</p>
<p>to get healthy and it&rsquo;s a very unique</p>
<p>book because it&rsquo;s very different than</p>
<p>any other weight loss book out there</p>
<p>when people come in to see me they</p>
<p>usually are in their mind they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to change their eating they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>find out what to eat they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>find out how to exercise and they&rsquo;ll try</p>
<p>this and try that and it&rsquo;s not working</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a couple reasons why I think</p>
<p>that is number one most people have just</p>
<p>too much information on the web it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s so conflicting it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>snowstorm of data just coming in and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really know what is credible</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s workable and you end up doing</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s maybe not important</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work so you end up not seeing</p>
<p>results and so I usually see people at</p>
<p>the tail end of that so the</p>
<p>you need to know is that we need a</p>
<p>foundation we need some foundation we</p>
<p>need a viewpoint to position everything</p>
<p>because if you think about in a</p>
<p>snowstorm this might be the yeah I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna take this call I&rsquo;m gonna turn this</p>
<p>off right here because I&rsquo;m talking to</p>
<p>you so sorry about that so the principle</p>
<p>the foundation that we want to build on</p>
<p>is we want to build on a foundation of</p>
<p>and you probably already know this it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good healthy to lose weight and not lose</p>
<p>weight to get healthy and I wanted to</p>
<p>find what that means because when you go</p>
<p>to the doctor he&rsquo;ll do tests and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re healthy when in fact if you</p>
<p>were healthy you wouldn&rsquo;t crave so many</p>
<p>sweets or carbohydrates if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>healthy you would be able to sleep if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re healthy you wouldn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>little stress tolerance you&rsquo;d be able to</p>
<p>digest so there&rsquo;s seven factors that I</p>
<p>want to revolve you&rsquo;re our best health</p>
<p>indicators and I&rsquo;m going to pull up a</p>
<p>little screen share in here and just</p>
<p>show you so this is my definition of</p>
<p>health when you have energy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sleeping like baby you can digest you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not craving anything you have no</p>
<p>inflammation you have no pain in your</p>
<p>menstrual cycle and reproductive organs</p>
<p>are intact and they are working so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you have those then you are</p>
<p>healthy so that&rsquo;s the point of reference</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re gonna base everything not in</p>
<p>calories but on how healthy you are I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never met one person who had a stubborn</p>
<p>weight problem who didn&rsquo;t have at least</p>
<p>one of those seven items so that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be talking about and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna help you to debug your own weight</p>
<p>loss but I want to really take it really</p>
<p>really simple in the book I get into</p>
<p>high-level principles we go really</p>
<p>really deep into the details of like the</p>
<p>seven reasons why you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>sleep and then you can pick out the one</p>
<p>that applies to you so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be pretty cool it&rsquo;s taking a</p>
<p>lot of work though because there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of different variables I want to keep</p>
<p>trying</p>
<p>make it simpler and simpler so I think</p>
<p>the next thing I want to really bring up</p>
<p>is this I had a lady come in yesterday</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s just really frustrated she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting older she&rsquo;s getting bigger and</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s working and when I assess her</p>
<p>she had all of the symptoms of hormonal</p>
<p>stuff and she&rsquo;s so focused on her weight</p>
<p>but I told her her problem is not the</p>
<p>way to go it&rsquo;s not the weight and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like yes it is I said actually you have</p>
<p>a weight symptom and you&rsquo;ve been solving</p>
<p>the weight as a problem and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>getting where anywhere it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>the dr. Oz effect where you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>supplements to stimulate the metabolism</p>
<p>or burn the fat directly it&rsquo;s just going</p>
<p>to be expensive urine so you need to</p>
<p>know and look at weight is a symptom and</p>
<p>not as a problem or a cause of something</p>
<p>and of course right now they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to make obesity a disease because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of profit in that but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really not a disease it&rsquo;s an effect of</p>
<p>other things those seven items so what I</p>
<p>want to do right now if you can do me a</p>
<p>big favor is I want you to type in let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>look at let me just open that back here</p>
<p>if I open up these seven items I want</p>
<p>you to type in not all of them but the</p>
<p>one thing that you feel is the worst</p>
<p>problem that you have relating to your</p>
<p>energy level your sleep cycle your</p>
<p>digestion your cravings your</p>
<p>inflammation that includes autoimmune</p>
<p>any pain in your body the inflammation</p>
<p>could also include inflammation in the</p>
<p>colon in the sinus and the lung it could</p>
<p>be any type of fibromyalgia and then we</p>
<p>have pain and then reproduction if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a male body let&rsquo;s how about your</p>
<p>your performance or a female what about</p>
<p>your libido what about your menstrual</p>
<p>cycle is that a problem and if we want</p>
<p>to include under energy also wanna</p>
<p>include memory and stress tolerance so</p>
<p>go ahead and just type out</p>
<p>any of those items that you have and</p>
<p>just type in the chat box I&rsquo;m just going</p>
<p>to look at that as you&rsquo;re typing I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try to open up this chat I press</p>
<p>the button and I close it</p>
<p>let me just open this thing back up here</p>
<p>oh there we go okay good okay so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just gonna read down the list as people</p>
<p>that wow this is good good feedback</p>
<p>energy sleep craving sleep sleep energy</p>
<p>cravings digestion inflammation lack of</p>
<p>sleep energy energy inflammation</p>
<p>reproduction sleep inflammation</p>
<p>reproduction joint pain stress tolerance</p>
<p>okay yeah sleep energy I think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>huge problem with energy and cravings</p>
<p>Wow okay cravings sleep this is good</p>
<p>all of them soundly last six years</p>
<p>energy inflammation stress tolerance Wow</p>
<p>memory sleep cravings Wow okay so I</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good data alright so now that we</p>
<p>I isolated maybe the key area we need to</p>
<p>look we&rsquo;re not done with that yet we</p>
<p>want to evaluate what&rsquo;s causing your</p>
<p>sleep problems or your energy but I have</p>
<p>a shortcut and I&rsquo;m going to show you</p>
<p>what that shortcut is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another very very important</p>
<p>thing I do when I evaluate people and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a simple simple simple question</p>
<p>that no one asks which they should ask</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the most important thing and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically this when did you first</p>
<p>notice you started developing a weight</p>
<p>problem specifically a stubborn weight</p>
<p>problem okay there will always be</p>
<p>something a stress event pregnancy</p>
<p>change and diet so now what I want you</p>
<p>to type in is type in what age you were</p>
<p>when you noticed that your weight</p>
<p>started to pick back up and if you if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not if you don&rsquo;t have a weight</p>
<p>problem that&rsquo;s fine then what I want you</p>
<p>to do is that one that you type like the</p>
<p>fatigue and energy tell me when that</p>
<p>started if you have digestive problems</p>
<p>when you start having digest problems</p>
<p>when you have start having sleeping</p>
<p>problems so someone said tilt your</p>
<p>camera down</p>
<p>okay good how is that thank you I just</p>
<p>went back up all right so yeah if you</p>
<p>have a few have memory problems when did</p>
<p>it start going down right type down the</p>
<p>age okay 35 47 years old 45 38 42 okay</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>pregnancy 40 50 18 after birth control</p>
<p>pills child hysterectomy gallbladder</p>
<p>removal this is so typical</p>
<p>lupus marriage divorce stress event</p>
<p>interesting do the blood pressure</p>
<p>medications Wow</p>
<p>3045 40s eight years old okay Wow okay</p>
<p>so now we have we have two things we</p>
<p>have your primary weakling underneath</p>
<p>the weight which could be usually</p>
<p>fatigued sleep and and things like that</p>
<p>and then number two we have when your</p>
<p>weight loss or weight gain started you</p>
<p>can do this with anything you can do</p>
<p>this with a symptom but it gives us a</p>
<p>lot of good data because it then tells</p>
<p>us the location of what we need to work</p>
<p>on and I&rsquo;m going to explain location in</p>
<p>a second so we have two problems right</p>
<p>here we have what to eat to lose weight</p>
<p>how to exercise and then over here we</p>
<p>have your body&rsquo;s reaction to the things</p>
<p>that you do I want to put more attention</p>
<p>on the body&rsquo;s reaction because when you</p>
<p>probably 18 years old you can eat what</p>
<p>you want and you just lose weight pretty</p>
<p>easily but as you age things become more</p>
<p>difficult because the body is no longer</p>
<p>responding to those triggers there are</p>
<p>six fat burning hormones and there are</p>
<p>three fat making hormones and the fat</p>
<p>making hormones are the dominating</p>
<p>hormones in a presence of a little bit</p>
<p>of those hormones all of these fat</p>
<p>burning hormones get squashed nullified</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t work and that means that all</p>
<p>it takes is a little bit of sugar a</p>
<p>little bit of stress and a little bit of</p>
<p>estrogen to really just kind of stop all</p>
<p>your work all your progress so what we</p>
<p>want to do is we want to figure out a</p>
<p>way to speed that up and remove the</p>
<p>barriers and if we take and look at a</p>
<p>lot of people the weight starts after a</p>
<p>stress event okay so let&rsquo;s just talk</p>
<p>about stress for a second because</p>
<p>stressful it&rsquo;s the number one thing that</p>
<p>affects your sleep your memory your</p>
<p>cognitive function your energy the</p>
<p>function of your glands and especially</p>
<p>belly fat okay so yes we have sugar and</p>
<p>food and junk food but stress is</p>
<p>probably a really big one</p>
<p>especially as you age and you get into</p>
<p>menopause had lady come in I did a video</p>
<p>on her today I&rsquo;m gonna post it in a few</p>
<p>days but she came from Ohio and she</p>
<p>stayed for three days and she she was</p>
<p>doing fine until she hit 834 and she was</p>
<p>married to a psychotic person for a long</p>
<p>time but because she lived close to a</p>
<p>support structure with her family she</p>
<p>was able to cope but then they moved</p>
<p>away and then in a matter of a year they</p>
<p>had about 19 people died around them and</p>
<p>four suicides it was just crazy so as</p>
<p>soon as that she got her husband out of</p>
<p>the picture she just withered completely</p>
<p>burnt out couldn&rsquo;t sleep cannot relax</p>
<p>and just gained all this weight so she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the healthcare field and she&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>everything but nothing&rsquo;s worked</p>
<p>so she came in and I it was a lot of</p>
<p>emotional stress so emotional stress is</p>
<p>probably a thousand times more damaging</p>
<p>the physical stress because it really</p>
<p>shuts down the adrenal gland so we did</p>
<p>acupressure on her her adrenal glands</p>
<p>for every every hour and a half for</p>
<p>three days in a row and I did a video</p>
<p>and you could you&rsquo;ll see how she feels</p>
<p>now she&rsquo;s basically feels like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely renewed she can sleep she has</p>
<p>tons of energy she has a sense of</p>
<p>relaxation that she&rsquo;s never experienced</p>
<p>in her life she&rsquo;s going to start losing</p>
<p>weight now because we&rsquo;re pulling the</p>
<p>stress out so what I like to do is I</p>
<p>like to isolate what was the trigger and</p>
<p>the trigger being was at pregnancy was</p>
<p>it a surgery was it a gallbladder</p>
<p>surgery was it a menopausal thing and</p>
<p>then what we want to do is we want to</p>
<p>take the location of where that trauma</p>
<p>is now affecting your body if you had a</p>
<p>lot of menstrual periods every month for</p>
<p>your whole life that was very very</p>
<p>cramping and bleeding him and then you</p>
<p>had DNC&rsquo;s and you know pregnancies and</p>
<p>tubal ligations and then a fibroid and</p>
<p>hysterectomy you have a lot of trauma in</p>
<p>that area of the body and your private</p>
<p>and that that area that trauma can</p>
<p>affect severely the adrenal because the</p>
<p>Drina was the backup so you would want</p>
<p>to remove that trauma from the body</p>
<p>because it impinges and it gets stuck in</p>
<p>the body so there&rsquo;s a couple ways that</p>
<p>we do it we do it with acupressure we do</p>
<p>with food we do a nutrition do with</p>
<p>exercise if the person had a gallbladder</p>
<p>removal that in Anna started gaining</p>
<p>weight how do you remove that injury we</p>
<p>do acupressure on that I&rsquo;ll touch on</p>
<p>that in a little bit but I want to kind</p>
<p>of give you an overview of that we have</p>
<p>we have the underlying seven factors and</p>
<p>then we have the triggers that are found</p>
<p>out by date coincidence when did it</p>
<p>start what happened just before and then</p>
<p>we have the location of the body that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re holding most stress so those are</p>
<p>some of the things that that we work on</p>
<p>had another lady she was she started</p>
<p>gaining weight when she was nine years</p>
<p>old that was her first period it was a</p>
<p>bit early and she started noticing she</p>
<p>started getting pretty large breasts at</p>
<p>9:00 when she hit 13 she got a double D</p>
<p>she had a breast surgery at 13 and</p>
<p>estrogen started going more and more and</p>
<p>more and more and she had a lot of</p>
<p>weight in the lower part of her body and</p>
<p>breast and upper body so estrogen makes</p>
<p>the fat in the hips and eventually in</p>
<p>the arms back here and that&rsquo;s what she</p>
<p>looks like</p>
<p>exactly another patient came in she came</p>
<p>in Monday here&rsquo;s another example and</p>
<p>this is a case that a person has gained</p>
<p>weight her whole life and she&rsquo;s when she</p>
<p>was four years old she was somewhat okay</p>
<p>her sister about the same size and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Asian so she normally her family is very</p>
<p>petite and small and she she&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>the big one in the family but what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting about her she had earlier</p>
<p>infections of the throat the lung the</p>
<p>sinus really really bad but her sister</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have it so what happened is that</p>
<p>she started gaining more weight more</p>
<p>weight stomach and then now she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably in her 30s right now and</p>
<p>has a pretty big stomach so she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>trying to lose weight nothing&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>and the earlier trigger was the earlier</p>
<p>infections back when she was four years</p>
<p>old that is still affecting the body you</p>
<p>have to look way way back the thing that</p>
<p>really gets her is her sister is not</p>
<p>only America she&rsquo;s actually mrs.</p>
<p>universe she does bodybuilding and it</p>
<p>just eats her up because to have your</p>
<p>own sister so beautiful and she&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>big one and she&rsquo;s trying this as hard</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s eating even better than her</p>
<p>sister is very crushing to her morale so</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to do with that case is</p>
<p>we are going to basically work with the</p>
<p>earlier infections and work on the</p>
<p>location of where she had all the</p>
<p>respiratory and sinus because she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sleeping it&rsquo;s just equivalent to a lot</p>
<p>of the applications in the desktop that</p>
<p>we need to close down to speed things up</p>
<p>so what I want to do right now because I</p>
<p>kind of gave you some principles I want</p>
<p>to answer some questions specifically in</p>
<p>your cases I know there&rsquo;s been a lot of</p>
<p>questions the thing it&rsquo;s coming in</p>
<p>really really fast because there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people on the webinar so I have to</p>
<p>kind of pick and choose so I want to</p>
<p>find out if you have some quick</p>
<p>questions relating to your body in</p>
<p>situations you&rsquo;re running into so I can</p>
<p>give you some advice on what to do but</p>
<p>maybe you want to talk about questions</p>
<p>on like your energy problem or your your</p>
<p>fatigue I mean I&rsquo;m sorry your sleep</p>
<p>problems or your digestive problems and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll help give us some advice so sorry</p>
<p>for the loss of your son Jen must have</p>
<p>been awful oh I didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t lose any</p>
<p>family members my son&rsquo;s still alive I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know I know what someone&rsquo;s staying</p>
<p>there okay</p>
<p>unless I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>there okay so Jan says I&rsquo;ve gained</p>
<p>weight four decades ago I&rsquo;m 70 energy is</p>
<p>an issue my lab tests are currently good</p>
<p>no indicator shows inflammation or</p>
<p>hypothyroid or diabetes I cope with the</p>
<p>family losses and live alone the trigger</p>
<p>was the death of my son oh that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>I remained off medications okay now here</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the thing that those</p>
<p>losses the stress gets stuck in your</p>
<p>body as well I&rsquo;m going to talk about the</p>
<p>body stress it&rsquo;s usually in the adrenal</p>
<p>glands itself and you need to probably</p>
<p>learn how to do some acupressure on your</p>
<p>dreams there&rsquo;s a device that I have I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>show you it so it looks like this it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an acupressure device I have them in all</p>
<p>my rooms that you can do your neck you</p>
<p>know as you&rsquo;re sitting in a tall back</p>
<p>chair or you can do it on your Drina</p>
<p>glands and I teach people how to do it</p>
<p>at home if you&rsquo;re not in the area so you</p>
<p>can do that and it&rsquo;ll actually help to</p>
<p>kind of deflate some of the distress</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the gland the glands are</p>
<p>little muscles that secrete hormones and</p>
<p>so if the hormone is too high high</p>
<p>cortisol the gland needs to be worked on</p>
<p>to get it to pump again you can do it on</p>
<p>diabetics you can do it Andriy know you</p>
<p>can do it on thyroid you can you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>ovary to help regulate the hormone</p>
<p>output versus working on the actual</p>
<p>hormone itself which rarely really works</p>
<p>you have to work on the gland okay so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that I would recommend</p>
<p>to do Jan because that would give you a</p>
<p>lot of relief for sleeping and just high</p>
<p>tolerance so you can you can move on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a physical body you know correction</p>
<p>the other thing that I want to mention</p>
<p>on the side know if you&rsquo;re stressed out</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not sleeping or if your</p>
<p>adrenal cases and you have belly fat</p>
<p>hands down the absolute best exercise</p>
<p>that you can possibly do would be</p>
<p>walking not even is much yoga but</p>
<p>walking long walks getting space looking</p>
<p>at a tree a bird and a cloud because</p>
<p>what happens we need to extract you</p>
<p>that computer is you&rsquo;re on the computer</p>
<p>all day are watching you know like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to work and you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>computer you&rsquo;re thinking thinking</p>
<p>thinking because I don&rsquo;t know if I can</p>
<p>pull this up I&rsquo;m gonna try something I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna draw a little picture here I have</p>
<p>no idea if this is gonna work I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>try this here let me just try something</p>
<p>here this may work okay all right so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what happens a little diagram</p>
<p>this person is totally thinking all day</p>
<p>long can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t turn it off</p>
<p>excessive analyzing okay so they need to</p>
<p>go and not in a gym on a treadmill they</p>
<p>need to go out there and basically get</p>
<p>space get their attention going out</p>
<p>looking at birds clouds and trees but</p>
<p>without analyzing in them gives them a</p>
<p>lot of space and then the adrenals which</p>
<p>see when you&rsquo;re thinking you&rsquo;re turning</p>
<p>on all these pictures that are memories</p>
<p>and they have stress in them and that</p>
<p>keeps the adrenals just really just kind</p>
<p>of wired so that&rsquo;s just one point that I</p>
<p>think is very very important okay so now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve another person that says</p>
<p>hypothyroid but I feel my body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fatigued and I have adrenal issues I</p>
<p>have a lot of stress in my life now</p>
<p>forty eight coming through menopause</p>
<p>struggling with biggie tummy can&rsquo;t fall</p>
<p>asleep at night and have low energy</p>
<p>during the day ok so this is this is a</p>
<p>perfect person to analyze they have</p>
<p>hypothyroidism that&rsquo;s gonna cause</p>
<p>fatigue absolutely but let me show you</p>
<p>something because there&rsquo;s there is three</p>
<p>types of so we&rsquo;re gonna pull the string</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s fatigued so we have energy</p>
<p>problems okay and now we know that the</p>
<p>thyroid hypothyroidism this is a really</p>
<p>good picture now the thyroid is always</p>
<p>secondary to something else unless there</p>
<p>is a primary injury or radiation therapy</p>
<p>typically what happens is the thyroid</p>
<p>will not be able to convert its hormones</p>
<p>t4 to the liver okay because there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>digestive problem it&rsquo;s usually low bile</p>
<p>b IL e in that case if you took some</p>
<p>aisle salts</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice your thyroid kick in and</p>
<p>how do you know you have low bile</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bloated you&rsquo;re constipated you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you have you can&rsquo;t get satisfied when</p>
<p>you eat you get right shoulder pain</p>
<p>those are all symptoms of low bile okay</p>
<p>the other symptom could be high estrogen</p>
<p>from the ovaries so you have this high</p>
<p>estrogen that can come and block the</p>
<p>thyroid so do you have a history of</p>
<p>heavy periods but did you have in</p>
<p>history of a lot of menstrual issues so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s two and then the third</p>
<p>one would be autoimmune that&rsquo;s adrenal</p>
<p>yeah so let&rsquo;s talk about Ottoman just</p>
<p>for a second I&rsquo;m just using her as an</p>
<p>example this book right here it might be</p>
<p>backwards I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s called CIPA</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s volume four and this is interesting</p>
<p>if we look at the adrenal hormones</p>
<p>called cortisol it says right here that</p>
<p>it for cells to high your antibodies</p>
<p>will start to be released and you become</p>
<p>very susceptible to all sorts of</p>
<p>autoimmune conditions and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>most autoimmune cases we are treated</p>
<p>with steroids what&rsquo;s a steroid in</p>
<p>adrenal hormone so all the immune</p>
<p>problems are adrenal triggered so again</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to necessarily treat the</p>
<p>disease we want to get the adrenal</p>
<p>glands up and get it working better so</p>
<p>oh okay so some people can&rsquo;t see the</p>
<p>drawing okay</p>
<p>well darn it let me just try it now yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not probably not going to be able</p>
<p>to see it because the my writing is very</p>
<p>small so sorry about that I&rsquo;ll have to</p>
<p>well you know what here&rsquo;s what here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I did</p>
<p>I I created about seven thyroid videos</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be releasing them on YouTube every</p>
<p>day for the next seven days so you can</p>
<p>go on there and watch as much as you</p>
<p>want to cover all this data but if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know the YouTube channel just go</p>
<p>to my blog dr. Berg comm and then click</p>
<p>the blog and then to all YouTube videos</p>
<p>you just click right into the YouTube</p>
<p>and then you can see my my page dr. Eric</p>
<p>Berg 1 2 3 okay that&rsquo;s the channel name</p>
<p>alright says my husband is a thyroid</p>
<p>with a health condition on meds years</p>
<p>trying to lose weight and nothing well</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not autoimmune it&rsquo;s either a</p>
<p>gall bladder problem or it&rsquo;s an estrogen</p>
<p>problem chances are it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>estrogen for him and so he needs if you</p>
<p>just had him take some bile salts you</p>
<p>can either get gall bladder formula or</p>
<p>just go to the store and get bile salts</p>
<p>purify bile salts you can find that t4</p>
<p>will start converting the t3 a lot</p>
<p>better when you go from t4 to t3 it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>what happens is t4 is the number of</p>
<p>iodine molecules and that&rsquo;s an inactive</p>
<p>form and then once taken off becomes t3</p>
<p>and then it becomes the active form bio</p>
<p>helps that conversion without bile you</p>
<p>will have a big problem with converting</p>
<p>the thyroid hormones in fact if you take</p>
<p>a little bile you just might find that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need as much medication in</p>
<p>your thyroid it&rsquo;s one of the most the</p>
<p>simplest thing that you can do where do</p>
<p>you get bio sauce you can get them from</p>
<p>the health food store I have them in a</p>
<p>product called gall bladder formula on</p>
<p>my website you can do that if you want</p>
<p>okay so okay so if you&rsquo;re on synthroid</p>
<p>yeah okay this is good</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking centroid you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>thyroid medication and you&rsquo;re not having</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not losing weight and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still tired we know for a fact that you</p>
<p>are secondary it&rsquo;s not primary</p>
<p>so in other words it&rsquo;s not gonna work</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not feeling any better</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just treating a secondary problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not gonna work how does the</p>
<p>how does it help conversions well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two there&rsquo;s two main thyroid</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually three or four different</p>
<p>thyroid hormones but you have the</p>
<p>inactive version and then you have the</p>
<p>active version synthroid is an inactive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a t4 and so the question is how do</p>
<p>we turn it into t3 to make it work</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s done through your liver and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in you need bile B il e to be</p>
<p>able to strip off the iodine to make it</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>okay so yes it traces back to digestion</p>
<p>so here we have the situation you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to lose weight you got a you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tired</p>
<p>you got a thyroid problem but even</p>
<p>deeper we got a digestive problem this</p>
<p>is all going to be in the book that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>writing now because you have to pull a</p>
<p>string and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;d have to ask</p>
<p>questions and you can&rsquo;t just start</p>
<p>treating things higher on the list</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not going to work but</p>
<p>you have to know the right questions to</p>
<p>ask and the doctors just do not ask</p>
<p>these questions deep enough they pretty</p>
<p>much treat the tip of the iceberg so you</p>
<p>have to go deeper okay good dr. burr got</p>
<p>a hysterectomy ten months ago kept one</p>
<p>over I&rsquo;m taking kelp</p>
<p>chase treat for the past two months I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what to do anymore okay so</p>
<p>she had a hysterectomy all right</p>
<p>this is good because the hysterectomy</p>
<p>all that did is he removed a lot of your</p>
<p>parts and it forced your body to force</p>
<p>your adrenals to work twice as hard the</p>
<p>adrenal gland is the back up to the</p>
<p>ovary and the uterus when you have those</p>
<p>organs dismantled and taken out the</p>
<p>adrenal gland has to work harder and</p>
<p>harder and harder and harder and harder</p>
<p>so what you need to do is support the</p>
<p>adrenal gland you can do it with the</p>
<p>duty of acupressure or you can also do</p>
<p>with a product I have it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>adrenal support it&rsquo;s a recovery nutrient</p>
<p>but whatever you do</p>
<p>your goal is to improve the adrenal of</p>
<p>the back up to the ovary because those</p>
<p>organ parts are gone so you I think you</p>
<p>have one ovary that&rsquo;s gonna probably</p>
<p>help you lose weight</p>
<p>way more than treating the ovary itself</p>
<p>so because you have the backup organ</p>
<p>okay so yeah I know here&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>person who no change with taking thyroid</p>
<p>medication well you know it&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>the right thing if you get the right</p>
<p>problem and the right solution you will</p>
<p>feel better and it shouldn&rsquo;t take twenty</p>
<p>years and I have people that are on</p>
<p>sense right for 20 years and the doctors</p>
<p>will just keep taking it okay okay so I</p>
<p>have have my little notes right here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my notes from my book you can read</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s backwards this is a very rough</p>
<p>draft by the way it&rsquo;s just so I can wrap</p>
<p>my head around what I&rsquo;m doing but yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s them I&rsquo;m gonna be doing some</p>
<p>more webinars so I just want to touch on</p>
<p>this but like for sleep for example</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some common reasons why people</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t sleep the adrenals burnt out okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a given they have sleep apnea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different problem that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>sinuses they can&rsquo;t breathe they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>breathe through the Sunnis is because</p>
<p>they have sleep apnea in the mucous</p>
<p>membranes are swollen on the nose so the</p>
<p>air doesn&rsquo;t get in so they basically</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re there actually can&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t breathe high flashes</p>
<p>is another a common cause to sleep but</p>
<p>you know even a bigger more common cause</p>
<p>of sleep problems is digestion problems</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bloating it&rsquo;s basically trying to</p>
<p>go to sleep with your stomach all</p>
<p>bloated because you ate the wrong foods</p>
<p>or or other reasons if you eat the wrong</p>
<p>foods or you&rsquo;re eating too much fiber</p>
<p>and healthy if you even like cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables even even some people do the</p>
<p>kale shake they get bloated and then</p>
<p>what happens is they&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>able to sleep why because the brain</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a second brain in your gut and a</p>
<p>lot of the nerve</p>
<p>go up from the gut up into the head and</p>
<p>only 10% goes down at 90% goes up so</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s going on in your gut is going</p>
<p>on in your head so if you have brain fog</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t rest at night chances are it</p>
<p>could be your digestive system and then</p>
<p>we have high blood pressure or high</p>
<p>pulse right that can keep you up and</p>
<p>then your bladder I just did a bit video</p>
<p>on bladder problems I will release that</p>
<p>this week as well so there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>urinary bladder problems it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>keep you up and then we have muscle</p>
<p>cramps so we got adrenal sleep apnea hot</p>
<p>flashes bladder high blood pressure and</p>
<p>crimps in digestion so that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>much kind of what we&rsquo;re gonna go is</p>
<p>gonna go deeper and deeper and deeper</p>
<p>and deeper and deeper okay so let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>here what do you think of a high fat low</p>
<p>carb diet to lose weight okay Jennifer I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a great great idea because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna stimulate fat burning and</p>
<p>yes the fat is going to force you to</p>
<p>lose weight and so is the low carb the</p>
<p>only thing you got to make sure with</p>
<p>that Jennifer&rsquo;s you have to make sure</p>
<p>that your liver and gallbladder can</p>
<p>digest that that so if you start to feel</p>
<p>bloated or stuffed or even right</p>
<p>shoulder pain then we know that your</p>
<p>gallbladder needs some support so just</p>
<p>take into consideration that you might</p>
<p>want to add more bile salts as you</p>
<p>increase more on that fat other than I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s something good to lose</p>
<p>weight I think it&rsquo;ll help you does the</p>
<p>gallbladder formula I have the bile</p>
<p>salts yes it does it&rsquo;s called by the</p>
<p>formula where the bile salts help with</p>
<p>dissolving stones yes it does in my gall</p>
<p>bladder formula I have something called</p>
<p>stone root and a lot of other nutrients</p>
<p>to help break down stones</p>
<p>why do you adrenal types lose their</p>
<p>buttocks mine&rsquo;s almost flat I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just age well good question</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s open CIPA and I&rsquo;ll show you what</p>
<p>happens</p>
<p>so you can see this body right here it</p>
<p>says right here the overall catabolic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a breakdown effect of the</p>
<p>adrenals brings about marked muscle</p>
<p>wasting of the quadricep and the</p>
<p>gluttonous Maximus so what happens</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your butt muscle in your leg</p>
<p>muscles the way to know that you have a</p>
<p>problem with that is that you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>deep squats and climb properly because</p>
<p>your legs and your butt are becoming</p>
<p>atrophied your body is taking a stealing</p>
<p>protein in converting it into sugar in</p>
<p>the gut as a survival mechanism okay dr.</p>
<p>Berg has a video on cramps check it on</p>
<p>YouTube calcium yeah there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really three causes of cramps one is too</p>
<p>much calcium with too low magnesium so</p>
<p>we got low magnesium high calcium okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one the way to fix that is take</p>
<p>some magnesium number two is low</p>
<p>potassium that&rsquo;s C that&rsquo;s a no-brainer</p>
<p>just consume the amount of vegetables</p>
<p>that you need and then you&rsquo;ll actually</p>
<p>be fine and number three it&rsquo;s a side</p>
<p>effect for medications that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>common one as well so those are the</p>
<p>three causes of cramps there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>ones they&rsquo;re not as common okay lyndie</p>
<p>asked what about probiotics okay yeah</p>
<p>now that that&rsquo;s a whole different video</p>
<p>the probiotics is probably the number</p>
<p>one thing people really need because of</p>
<p>the fact that you have a hundred</p>
<p>trillion microbes living around and in</p>
<p>your body right now and you only have a</p>
<p>hundred say no it&rsquo;s a hundred no it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thousand trillion microbes living in</p>
<p>your cells which are only a hundred</p>
<p>trillion</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re basically only one-tenth of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s on your body and you have a lot</p>
<p>of other things in there and these</p>
<p>microbes really really help you they can</p>
<p>hurt you but they can help you they</p>
<p>break down waste they make vitamins they</p>
<p>help protect your immune system and they</p>
<p>actually do a lot of the digest</p>
<p>of your fibers in your colon I do want</p>
<p>to make mention this when people do a</p>
<p>chapter 10 on my diet a lot of times</p>
<p>they I tell them to do about 7 cups of</p>
<p>vegetables but then they figure if I do</p>
<p>that much more is going to be better so</p>
<p>they do more and more and more and more</p>
<p>and more until they come in and their</p>
<p>gut is just completely distended because</p>
<p>all that they don&rsquo;t have enough microbes</p>
<p>to digest all that fiber so you might</p>
<p>want to lower the fiber and see how much</p>
<p>even vegetable fiber to see what you can</p>
<p>tolerate I have a sleep problem take two</p>
<p>to three hours fall asleep again happens</p>
<p>twice each night stay in bed for as long</p>
<p>as it takes</p>
<p>as far as sleeping goes let&rsquo;s pull up to</p>
<p>the chat sheet on that so if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have sleep apnea then you have hot</p>
<p>flashes do you have a bladder problem</p>
<p>you have high blood pressure cramps you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have those then we know it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>adrenal so you want to support the</p>
<p>adrenal there&rsquo;s a couple things that I</p>
<p>do before bed and I just want to show</p>
<p>you this actually acupressure device I</p>
<p>built this from China that mimics my</p>
<p>hand and then I do this on patients all</p>
<p>the time I put this right at the top of</p>
<p>the back of my head right here and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s at a location of the major the</p>
<p>recovery points in your body so you</p>
<p>could just tack this up you can put this</p>
<p>on your your couch and you can just sit</p>
<p>back and let gravity just do all the</p>
<p>work and about a couple of minutes like</p>
<p>two or three minutes I&rsquo;ll be like ready</p>
<p>to go to bed so I do this every night</p>
<p>for a little bit it&rsquo;s a great torture I</p>
<p>mean treatment device you can do it on</p>
<p>your adrenals as well why the adrenal</p>
<p>body types can&rsquo;t do intense exercise if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re recommending to activate fat</p>
<p>burning it has to do with this and I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m going to try this one more</p>
<p>time I&rsquo;m gonna try to pop this open</p>
<p>right here and show you maybe you might</p>
<p>be able to see this maybe not</p>
<p>but let me just show you something</p>
<p>when you exercise you stress your body</p>
<p>out and then you stop</p>
<p>so you exercise and then you stop and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re supposed to recover after</p>
<p>that well adrenal cases don&rsquo;t recover so</p>
<p>the more exercise they do without</p>
<p>recovery they actually slow down their</p>
<p>ability to lose weight so you the</p>
<p>benefits of exercise only occurs after</p>
<p>the workout when you&rsquo;re recovering if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re recovering the best exercise of</p>
<p>the low-intensity until you can actually</p>
<p>recover so if you&rsquo;re not if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>sleeping if you&rsquo;re tired you should go</p>
<p>over there light especially if you have</p>
<p>an adrenal problem is it possible to get</p>
<p>back the lost buttocks just when you</p>
<p>begin to heal yeah absolutely</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;ve had people with complete</p>
<p>atrophy on their body and after</p>
<p>menopause when their body is so far down</p>
<p>and you start working with him you get</p>
<p>him sleeping you get these the energy</p>
<p>back the in the adrenals back get the</p>
<p>health back get the food back in and</p>
<p>then over time they actually get younger</p>
<p>and then some I have a test that</p>
<p>measures the biological age and then I</p>
<p>had a gal I haven&rsquo;t seen her for a</p>
<p>couple years and she came in she was</p>
<p>when I first saw her she was 211 she a</p>
<p>lot of health problems atrophy shrinkage</p>
<p>of muscles no but and she took off her</p>
<p>coat this was in the in the wintertime</p>
<p>and I my jaw dropped I was like what let</p>
<p>me get my camera gorgeous body she</p>
<p>gained all this muscle mass and she</p>
<p>looked very very very great I mean I</p>
<p>just couldn&rsquo;t even believe that was her</p>
<p>so yeah it can happen but you have to</p>
<p>you have to not focus on the weight as a</p>
<p>problem of a bit of symptom you have to</p>
<p>work on the inner health and get your</p>
<p>health back it&rsquo;s hard because you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>focused on the weight but the way it</p>
<p>always comes off as a side effect yeah</p>
<p>Lori says I can&rsquo;t eat all the vegetables</p>
<p>required I know I know because the</p>
<p>digestive system so you you might want</p>
<p>to have additional vegetables so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that you have a lot of</p>
<p>bloating I&rsquo;ll just mention some of the</p>
<p>vegetables that were be good for you so</p>
<p>you probably can&rsquo;t do cruciferous</p>
<p>cabbage broccoli cauliflower but what</p>
<p>you can do is sue Keaney you can do</p>
<p>tomato spinach you can do squash you can</p>
<p>do celery carrot asparagus pickles</p>
<p>fermented foods sauerkraut so yeah you</p>
<p>can do those vegetables and I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be fine I know there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>questions and I know I would love to</p>
<p>answer all of them but there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>here is it possible to stop taking</p>
<p>thyroid meds oh yeah even after 20 years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people come off I had a</p>
<p>four-star general she came off after</p>
<p>being 20 years on synthroid it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>working so she got better and she came</p>
<p>off with help of her doc of course I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not telling you to come off this juicing</p>
<p>give me enough fiber I&rsquo;m not opposed to</p>
<p>vegetable juice as long as you don&rsquo;t add</p>
<p>carrot or anything sweet in there but if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t if you want to get the</p>
<p>nutrition from the vegetables juice them</p>
<p>and because sometimes the fiber might</p>
<p>irritate you so that is a situation yes</p>
<p>so your weight is a symptom okay what do</p>
<p>I do when I have a thyroid problem big</p>
<p>all over and just found out tonight it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably not my primary issue well</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you do if it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>autoimmune okay then it has to be a bio</p>
<p>problem or estrogen so if you want to</p>
<p>find out if it&rsquo;s an estrogen problem do</p>
<p>you have any thyroid highest return</p>
<p>symptoms do you have heavy periods do</p>
<p>you have history of fibroids do you have</p>
<p>any meetry osis do you have heavy cramps</p>
<p>do you bleed you have irregular periods</p>
<p>you have infertility do you have if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have those maybe you have a lot of</p>
<p>bloating with your gallbladder so find</p>
<p>out which blends that you have a problem</p>
<p>I can go ahead and address that and see</p>
<p>if you get better and you proud</p>
<p>well okay</p>
<p>you mentioned trauma how do you heal</p>
<p>from trauma I&rsquo;m gonna give you a little</p>
<p>tip on that I should probably whole</p>
<p>seminar but there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s physical</p>
<p>trauma and emotional trauma I work on</p>
<p>the physical but I also work on the</p>
<p>physical the the imprint that that</p>
<p>emotional cause on the physical which is</p>
<p>the adrenals so we actually do a lot of</p>
<p>adrenal work we help rejuvenate the</p>
<p>adrenal but if you have surgery trauma</p>
<p>head injuries infections I&rsquo;m gonna give</p>
<p>you a little principle of what I do to</p>
<p>release it because if you had a</p>
<p>gallbladder surgery and you gained all</p>
<p>this weight and if I were to do active</p>
<p>pressure on your gallbladder and press</p>
<p>into your gallbladder that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have that would make things worse okay</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna traumatize the</p>
<p>person or if you had a problem with the</p>
<p>uterus and you had that out I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna press in uterus or if you had a</p>
<p>problem with your thyroid I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>press in your thyroid so how do you</p>
<p>release stress in the body you would use</p>
<p>the principle of opposites and you can</p>
<p>even apply this to make it more real to</p>
<p>yourself if you want to try a really</p>
<p>cool experiment with a friend or family</p>
<p>member go ahead and find a friend or</p>
<p>that has pain anywhere in the body I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s in the foot if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in a bunion if it&rsquo;s in the shoulder or</p>
<p>the back and let&rsquo;s say they have</p>
<p>shoulder pain right here if you were to</p>
<p>do acupressure</p>
<p>on the opposite side you can get rid of</p>
<p>this pain you&rsquo;re not gonna believe me</p>
<p>unless you try it but it will work so</p>
<p>anywhere where the person hurts work on</p>
<p>the opposite side it&rsquo;s very very simple</p>
<p>very powerful I mean the same thing goes</p>
<p>with injuries if you had your</p>
<p>gallbladder out on the right side where</p>
<p>it is you would want to do acupressure</p>
<p>on the left side I&rsquo;m not going to get</p>
<p>into why that works but it will release</p>
<p>so much stress on your gallbladder you</p>
<p>just have to try it believe me because</p>
<p>it works so it&rsquo;ll release it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like closing down the application on</p>
<p>your desk</p>
<p>and by the way if you had your</p>
<p>gallbladder out your other organs have</p>
<p>to work twice as hard especially the</p>
<p>pancreas so yeah so that&rsquo;s one thing all</p>
<p>right so let&rsquo;s see 5-htp something</p>
<p>necessary 5-htp is not a bad thing to</p>
<p>take before bed if you want to calm the</p>
<p>adrenals and you want to help yourself</p>
<p>sleep so 5htp or l-tryptophan those are</p>
<p>precursors that turn into serotonin the</p>
<p>sleep hormone so it&rsquo;s not a bad idea I</p>
<p>have no problem with it I like it better</p>
<p>than melatonin actually okay Julie</p>
<p>pregnancy 31 Parkinson&rsquo;s fatigue head</p>
<p>injury severe so you would want to find</p>
<p>out what was it on the left was on the</p>
<p>top and you want to do the opposite and</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s interesting when you</p>
<p>work on the opposite it&rsquo;ll hurt twice as</p>
<p>much on the opposite side</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t ask me why okay rare</p>
<p>genetic disease at 73 decreasing vision</p>
<p>over 10 to 20 years now and have a huge</p>
<p>craving for sweets and now I&rsquo;m 268</p>
<p>pounds okay so we have that we have okay</p>
<p>fatty liver gall stones obstructive</p>
<p>sleep apnea all right okay so let me</p>
<p>just there&rsquo;s a lot there to chew on but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you something if no colon</p>
<p>or probiotic probiotics still help</p>
<p>helpful yes but if you have a fatty</p>
<p>liver if you have gall stones if you</p>
<p>have obstructive sleep apnea there is</p>
<p>something that I think I&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>recommend for you Julie that would be</p>
<p>create more of an effect on your body</p>
<p>because we need to get you to sleep we</p>
<p>need to or help you shrink this the</p>
<p>sinuses only help to help really have to</p>
<p>help you with your gall bladder to help</p>
<p>it convert your thyroid so that can work</p>
<p>I think the most important thing to do</p>
<p>would be to take the bile salts that I</p>
<p>talked about gall bladder formula and</p>
<p>take that for one week then add in some</p>
<p>of the fat soluble vitamins because</p>
<p>one of the things that it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>very very therapeutic to the mucous</p>
<p>membranes and the sinus is the fish oils</p>
<p>but the one that I really like is the</p>
<p>fish oil called DHA you can get it the</p>
<p>hell fast or it&rsquo;s in 500 milligrams 500</p>
<p>milligrams DHA DHA and it&rsquo;s a type of</p>
<p>fish oil that&rsquo;s amazing you I mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing they&rsquo;re regenerating brain</p>
<p>cells it&rsquo;s good for memory cognitive</p>
<p>brain injury but it&rsquo;s also good for the</p>
<p>mucous membranes it&rsquo;s good for the</p>
<p>retina of the eye good for sex hormones</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good for the mucous membranes</p>
<p>internally in your respiratory and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good if you&rsquo;re trying to sleep</p>
<p>and your head won&rsquo;t go to sleep</p>
<p>so if you are tired at night but your</p>
<p>head doesn&rsquo;t go to sleep take DHA and a</p>
<p>little calcium you can take calcium</p>
<p>citrate wherever be right before a bed</p>
<p>boom</p>
<p>watch what happens you&rsquo;ll go right to</p>
<p>sleep okay cuz that&rsquo;s nice for like an</p>
<p>overactive head</p>
<p>I have tendinitis in my wrists there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>magnetic bracelets work I mean they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna affect the electrical conductivity</p>
<p>but try this experiment okay let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the right wrist press on the</p>
<p>opposite one wherever it is in the</p>
<p>opposite side work that out and it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get rid of the pain but you may want to</p>
<p>try one more thing</p>
<p>if if you hurt on the wrist and the</p>
<p>right you want to work on the opposite</p>
<p>forearm muscles okay that will get rid</p>
<p>of the wrist if you have right knee pain</p>
<p>work on the opposite thigh muscle okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little tip and just kind of</p>
<p>teaching you guys how to do acupressure</p>
<p>alright so let&rsquo;s see Shaun changes his</p>
<p>eating plan I could also have a</p>
<p>condition okay looks like my assistant</p>
<p>and dr. Monica</p>
<p>dr. J she&rsquo;s on the chat but she&rsquo;s not on</p>
<p>the actual wife to debug that I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>that the link didn&rsquo;t quite work this is</p>
<p>like kind of my first time doing this so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a good experiment working</p>
<p>out the bugs next time we&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>I want to do a lot of live webinars I</p>
<p>have some questions that I want to ask</p>
<p>you I know we ran at a time by a half</p>
<p>hour but I want to do more seminars but</p>
<p>I also want to find out what you want to</p>
<p>talk about specifically so I&rsquo;m not all</p>
<p>over the place</p>
<p>this kind of was just like kind of a</p>
<p>test to see how this works if you want</p>
<p>to me to do more stuff Rose will be</p>
<p>happy to do it you just have to tell me</p>
<p>the different subjects and I will send</p>
<p>you a kind of a survey and ask you for</p>

<p>want weekly videos or would you want</p>
<p>daily short little video a tip because I</p>
<p>mean for the time I take doing videos I</p>
