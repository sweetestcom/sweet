    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Our cards this week are Stuart Simmons and Margaret Walden,</p>
<p>the Ace of Diamonds and the Ace of Hearts from Colorado.</p>
<p>With the help from the lead detective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you the bizarre tale about these two people</p>
<p>who were murdered in the 80s</p>
<p>and went unidentified for almost 30 years.</p>
<p>And now, law enforcement needs your help to find their killer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On September 19th, 1982, a rancher working his land</p>
<p>near the San Juan River on the border of northern New Mexico</p>
<p>and southern Colorado was out looking for a flock of geese</p>
<p>on his property when he saw what he thought was a dummy</p>
<p>on an island in the river.</p>
<p>The rancher&rsquo;s name was Frank Chavez,</p>
<p>and he was riding his horse,</p>
<p>so he went down to the river&rsquo;s edge to get a closer look.</p>
<p>When he got close and hopped off his horse,</p>
<p>he saw that it was actually a woman&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Pagosa Springs Sun newspaper,</p>
<p>initial reports described the woman as a 30-year-old white female,</p>
<p>5'5&quot;, with brown hair and a medium build.</p>
<p>She was wearing Wrangler blue jeans, a blue quilted jacket,</p>
<p>a purple halter top, a gold heart necklace,</p>
<p>and a horn-shaped pendant.</p>
<p>Frank immediately rode back to his house and called 911.</p>
<p>When officers arrived,</p>
<p>they realized they had a jurisdictional issue on their hands.</p>
<p>No one could tell for sure if the body was in New Mexico or Colorado,</p>
<p>because that area of the San Juan River could be in either state</p>
<p>depending on where you&rsquo;re standing.</p>
<p>But they ultimately decided the woman&rsquo;s body was a few yards</p>
<p>over the New Mexico state line,</p>
<p>so it was taken there for autopsy.</p>
<p>The New Mexico office of the medical investigator</p>
<p>ruled it homicide by strangulation,</p>
<p>but there was no ID with her to help them identify the woman.</p>
<p>From the autopsy report,</p>
<p>investigators learned that she was partially decomposed</p>
<p>and still had some skin and clothing on her.</p>
<p>When they searched her pockets,</p>
<p>they found a piece of paper with a woman&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>and a Farmington, New Mexico phone number written on it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when police called the number,</p>
<p>the lady who answered couldn&rsquo;t provide them</p>
<p>with any information about the woman they had found.</p>
<p>She also couldn&rsquo;t recall any reason that her name and phone number</p>
<p>would end up in a dead woman&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>According to all of the research material we could find,</p>
<p>this woman from Farmington was cleared as a suspect pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Authorities sent out the usual bulletin</p>
<p>with the Jane Doe&rsquo;s information on it to drum up leads,</p>
<p>but not much came in.</p>
<p>Then, a month later, on October 22nd, 1982,</p>
<p>a family walking the northern bank of the San Juan River</p>
<p>near Pagosa Springs, Colorado found another body,</p>
<p>this time a man&rsquo;s, and it was badly decomposing.</p>
<p>He was about a mile further down the river</p>
<p>from where Jane Doe had been discovered a few weeks before.</p>
<p>He was fully clothed, wearing corduroy pants,</p>
<p>Converse tennis shoes, and a t-shirt with the words</p>
<p>Lazy B. Guest Ranch written on the front breast pocket.</p>
<p>The man was classified as a John Doe because he also had no ID on him.</p>
<p>The only thing investigators could try and use as a clue</p>
<p>was the writing on his shirt.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s autopsy revealed he&rsquo;d also been murdered,</p>
<p>but not the same way as Jane Doe.</p>
<p>John Doe was shot with .22 caliber bullets.</p>
<p>The medical examiner determined that his ribs</p>
<p>were likely broken before he was shot,</p>
<p>indicating he might&rsquo;ve been in a fight shortly before his death.</p>
<p>Right away, police wondered if the murders were connected,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t until they released sketches</p>
<p>and started interviewing people around town</p>
<p>that they got their confirmation.</p>
<p>Some locals told police that they&rsquo;d seen a man and a woman together</p>
<p>at bars and restaurants in the area,</p>
<p>but nobody knew their names.</p>
<p>Because of state-line jurisdictional issues,</p>
<p>any hope to find out who Jane and John Doe were</p>
<p>or who killed them was bleak.</p>
<p>Investigators did some more interviews and filed them away,</p>
<p>but a crime scene was never established.</p>
<p>Because of their location, though,</p>
<p>police figured the bodies were tossed off the nearby Caracas Bridge.</p>
<p>Not much evidence was collected,</p>
<p>and the bodies ended up being buried</p>
<p>in separate unmarked plots in New Mexico graveyards.</p>
<p>Back then, at least in New Mexico,</p>
<p>unidentified murder victims got buried,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t much fanfare to their funerals.</p>
<p>They usually just got buried in the cheapest way possible</p>
<p>due to the absence of family or loved ones</p>
<p>showing up to claim them.</p>
<p>Decades passed, and the John and Jane Doe&rsquo;s cases went cold.</p>
<p>That is, until 2008, when in Pagosa Springs, Colorado,</p>
<p>a retired drug enforcement agent named George Barter</p>
<p>was considering getting back into detective work.</p>
<p>George had heard stories about the bodies</p>
<p>that were found in the San Juan River decades before,</p>
<p>and he wanted to take a crack at solving the case.</p>
<p>I got sort of, I don&rsquo;t know if it was obsessed,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d lay awake at night</p>
<p>thinking about these two kids under the bridge</p>
<p>and thinking about how to walk into the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and say, hey, I want to work on this.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, George&rsquo;s wife, Jennifer,</p>
<p>got a job as an office manager</p>
<p>at the Archuleta County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department.</p>
<p>And after advising the department on some drug raid cases,</p>
<p>George got recertified as a law enforcement officer</p>
<p>and agreed to become the sheriff&rsquo;s second detective</p>
<p>on one condition.</p>
<p>And I says, all right, but I want to work on the Cole case.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, what Cole case?</p>
<p>George didn&rsquo;t realize just how little work had been done</p>
<p>on the 1982 John and Jane Doe case</p>
<p>that was 26 years old by that point.</p>
<p>We started hunting around for this Cole case,</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t find a file.</p>
<p>They looked in their archives.</p>
<p>They looked in the basement in old boxes.</p>
<p>They looked in the storage room</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t find anywhere.</p>
<p>George took on new murder cases and another Cole case</p>
<p>while he kept looking around for some sort of file</p>
<p>on the San Juan River Jane and John Doe.</p>
<p>And then one day, thanks to his wife,</p>
<p>he caught a lucky break.</p>
<p>There was an old office that had been unused.</p>
<p>It had been the patrol captain&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>and they were cleaning it out to make it into a file room.</p>
<p>And in the back of a cabinet there</p>
<p>they were going to haul off was a little brown folder.</p>
<p>And my wife ran into the office,</p>
<p>in my detective office, with this folder and says,</p>
<p>is this what you&rsquo;re looking for?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tiny, you know?</p>
<p>But it was about that case,</p>
<p>and it gave me a really good start.</p>
<p>Inside the folder were initial scene reports</p>
<p>for both Jane and John Doe,</p>
<p>which included their initial autopsy reports from New Mexico</p>
<p>and some interviews with witnesses.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of how complicated this thing became.</p>
<p>George got in touch with a technician</p>
<p>at the New Mexico office of the medical investigator.</p>
<p>And luckily, they kept records that old.</p>
<p>The investigator sent George the full autopsy files.</p>
<p>But when he asked about the possibility</p>
<p>of doing new DNA testing to try and identify the victims,</p>
<p>the lab tech had some unexpected news.</p>
<p>The remains of John and Jane Doe had been buried</p>
<p>in unmarked graves in the 80s,</p>
<p>and their skulls were in a museum.</p>
<p>Now, if you think the fact that their bodies were buried,</p>
<p>but their skulls weren&rsquo;t sounds weird,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because it is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, why?</p>
<p>And he says, well, it turns out while we had the skulls</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to do facial reconstructions,</p>
<p>they buried the remains of the two bodies.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t really want to dig them up.</p>
<p>So we archived the skulls</p>
<p>with other historic bones found in New Mexico.</p>
<p>And I asked him, would you go get them?</p>
<p>And he went and got them.</p>
<p>And so I said, well, this is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Can we do two things,</p>
<p>have new facial reconstructions done</p>
<p>and submit them for DNA?</p>
<p>He says, I&rsquo;ll take care of that.</p>
<p>While George was holding out hope</p>
<p>for science to do its thing with DNA,</p>
<p>he got busy investigating.</p>
<p>Knowing he might get DNA hits on the skulls</p>
<p>gave him new motivation.</p>
<p>After going back through the old reports,</p>
<p>he pieced together information</p>
<p>about a bus being the possible crime scene.</p>
<p>And thanks to media attention about him reopening the case,</p>
<p>he got a new tip about a fight</p>
<p>that actually went down at that bus.</p>
<p>So George developed a pretty good idea</p>
<p>of where he believed John and Jane Doe had been murdered.</p>
<p>I find out where I think,</p>
<p>where we believe the crime scene was.</p>
<p>It was in a bus, actually, in New Mexico.</p>
<p>And I had looked all over down there for it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know where it was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d driven down there hours, days, you know,</p>
<p>trying to find where this thing was.</p>
<p>That area of New Mexico and Colorado</p>
<p>is rural and vast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more forest and reservation land</p>
<p>than anything, and populated towns and cities</p>
<p>are few and far between.</p>
<p>But George and a New Mexico state police officer</p>
<p>eventually found the bus.</p>
<p>It had been abandoned</p>
<p>and was sitting in a field in New Mexico</p>
<p>for what locals told them had been nearly three decades.</p>
<p>So based on what George had put together,</p>
<p>he really thought that this was the initial crime scene.</p>
<p>So he applied for and got a search warrant.</p>
<p>When he finally got inside, though,</p>
<p>the bus was a mess.</p>
<p>Back there where the stove was knocked over,</p>
<p>there was still some bricks.</p>
<p>The stove might have gone on.</p>
<p>We find blood, what we think is blood.</p>
<p>George and the state investigator did a field test</p>
<p>on the area of carpet inside the bus</p>
<p>that had the dark stain on it,</p>
<p>and it came back positive for blood.</p>
<p>They also found four spent .22 caliber cartridge casings</p>
<p>in the bus.</p>
<p>So knowing that John Doe was killed with a .22,</p>
<p>they backed up the shell casings as evidence.</p>
<p>And for the first time in 28 years,</p>
<p>the San Juan River John and Jane Doe double homicide</p>
<p>had some physical evidence.</p>
<p>The only problem was George had a really hard time</p>
<p>finding a crime lab in Colorado</p>
<p>that would actually test the evidence.</p>
<p>Well, that ends up being a mess</p>
<p>because of the hantavirus.</p>
<p>CBI laboratories were like,</p>
<p>we ain&rsquo;t touching that hantavirus.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t bring that in our laboratory.</p>
<p>It takes us months to get someone</p>
<p>to take the stuff and process it.</p>
<p>Because the bus had sat abandoned in a field for so long,</p>
<p>its only residents had been mice.</p>
<p>And in that part of the West,</p>
<p>hantavirus, a disease that&rsquo;s spread by rodents,</p>
<p>is a real concern.</p>
<p>George and other investigators even wore Tyvek suits</p>
<p>to execute the search warrant,</p>
<p>anticipating the virus might be present.</p>
<p>So that seriously delayed the new pieces of evidence</p>
<p>being tested.</p>
<p>But finally, an FBI lab agreed to do it.</p>
<p>When the results came in,</p>
<p>the lab told George that the blood</p>
<p>was most definitely human blood.</p>
<p>But any further testing beyond that</p>
<p>was impossible because it was too old.</p>
<p>But the shell casings?</p>
<p>They came back as a likely match to the bullets</p>
<p>that had been found in John Doe during his autopsy.</p>
<p>George felt good about the progress of the case,</p>
<p>but then he got some not-so-good news.</p>
<p>The victims&rsquo; skulls weren&rsquo;t producing any DNA results.</p>
<p>I think we submitted their skulls three times.</p>
<p>And when it finally came back the third time from the FBI,</p>
<p>they said, you know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever get any DNA from these skulls.</p>
<p>Because of how facial reconstruction was done</p>
<p>in the 80s and because the skulls</p>
<p>were in a museum all those years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that they had been boiled, George said.</p>
<p>So there was no DNA left on them.</p>
<p>That meant George needed to get access</p>
<p>to the rest of Jane and John Doe&rsquo;s remains</p>
<p>if there was going to be any hope</p>
<p>of figuring out who they were.</p>
<p>George got a court order to do an exhumation</p>
<p>of John Doe first.</p>
<p>And thanks to detailed autopsy records,</p>
<p>they sort of knew where to look.</p>
<p>But actually finding the right grave</p>
<p>proved to be challenging.</p>
<p>They said he&rsquo;s the 11th grave</p>
<p>from the southeast corner of the county graveyard.</p>
<p>So the county graveyard&rsquo;s in the back</p>
<p>of a commercial graveyard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sand, tumbleweeds, grass.</p>
<p>The markers are basically a brick</p>
<p>with a John Doe or Jane Doe on it.</p>
<p>Cemetery workers said they preferred</p>
<p>to do the actual digging because they had a backhoe</p>
<p>that would be able to get the first few layers up.</p>
<p>After that, investigators did the last little bit</p>
<p>of digging by hand with shovels</p>
<p>until they finally brought up a body bag.</p>
<p>But there was a problem.</p>
<p>They opened the body bag and I&rsquo;m going,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s not him.</p>
<p>No way, that&rsquo;s not our John Doe.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s arguing with me, you know,</p>
<p>like the cemetery, no, this is the 11th grave.</p>
<p>This is where it passed.</p>
<p>And I said, no, I can tell you why,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a skull in this bag.</p>
<p>And we have the skulls.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not with the body.</p>
<p>George said they had to get another court order.</p>
<p>And another.</p>
<p>Because they dug up two more of the wrong John Does.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like going to quit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, well, he must not be here.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going, leave me a shovel, go away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got an order from my person.</p>
<p>I will dig him up myself if you&rsquo;re going to quit.</p>
<p>And so they said, OK, we&rsquo;ll do one more</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re quitting.</p>
<p>So they went the other direction</p>
<p>from the direction they&rsquo;d been going closer to the wall.</p>
<p>And that was John Doe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d finally found him.</p>
<p>And they were sure of it</p>
<p>because the body bag had the correct markings</p>
<p>from the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator</p>
<p>and the skull of the corpse was missing.</p>
<p>George sent off the bones for DNA testing.</p>
<p>And finally, in February 2014,</p>
<p>nearly 32 years after this man was murdered,</p>
<p>they found out his name.</p>
<p>John Doe was a 20-year-old sailor</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d gone AWOL from the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>His name was Stuart Eric Simmons.</p>
<p>I had spent hours and hours and hours on these websites</p>
<p>trying to find victims to go with my unidentifieds,</p>
<p>you know, missing people.</p>
<p>And his name never came up.</p>
<p>It never came up.</p>
<p>There was an interesting reason why his name had never come up.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t for a lack of trying on Stuart&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>Back on June 7th, 1982,</p>
<p>in the North Atlanta suburb of Roswell, Georgia,</p>
<p>Joanne Simmons was home feeling a little anxious</p>
<p>because she had just gotten a call</p>
<p>from her 20-year-old son, Stuart,</p>
<p>who was at a U.S. Navy base in San Diego, California.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d hung up but told her he&rsquo;d call right back.</p>
<p>But the minutes were dragging on and he wasn&rsquo;t calling.</p>
<p>Those minutes turned into hours</p>
<p>and Joanne was now reaching her breaking point.</p>
<p>Stuart had called home to let his mom know</p>
<p>that he was on his way to the court marshal&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>to find out what his punishment was gonna be</p>
<p>for getting into a little trouble with the Navy</p>
<p>a few months earlier.</p>
<p>After he completed boot camp in Chicago,</p>
<p>he took someone&rsquo;s car for a joyride and ended up in jail.</p>
<p>That arrest made him unable to report to his base in San Diego on time.</p>
<p>Charges against him for taking the car ended up being dropped</p>
<p>and the Navy gave him another chance.</p>
<p>But he still had to be punished for the delay</p>
<p>and being what the Navy considered AWOL.</p>
<p>Through the grapevine,</p>
<p>Stuart heard that his sentence would be minimal</p>
<p>and he assured his mom she had nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>If there was one thing Joanne knew Stuart was consistent on,</p>
<p>it was that he always kept his word about staying in touch.</p>
<p>He constantly called home and wrote letters.</p>
<p>Despite being stationed more than 2,000 miles from Roswell,</p>
<p>the whole Simmons family, Joanne, her husband, Bill, Stuart,</p>
<p>and their two daughters,</p>
<p>who were just one in two years younger than Stuart,</p>
<p>were all really close.</p>
<p>When Joanne couldn&rsquo;t stand waiting anymore,</p>
<p>she finally called the base back,</p>
<p>hoping to talk to Stuart</p>
<p>or at least find out what his sentence was.</p>
<p>She thought maybe the sentence</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t been as lenient as Stuart thought.</p>
<p>Maybe the Navy had tossed him in jail on the base</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t have access to a phone.</p>
<p>After several attempts to try and reach someone with information,</p>
<p>Joanne got a hold of the officer assigned to Stuart&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>And when he answered,</p>
<p>he was not happy to hear from Joanne.</p>
<p>Joanne told our team</p>
<p>that the man immediately started screaming at her,</p>
<p>saying that the jailer had given Stuart permission</p>
<p>to move his motorcycle</p>
<p>and they had not seen him since.</p>
<p>They refused to discuss anything else with her and hung up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when Joanne became frantic,</p>
<p>trying to make sense of what she just heard.</p>
<p>Stuart was a good kid for the most part</p>
<p>and was pretty responsible.</p>
<p>She told us there were times</p>
<p>that he could be impulsive though</p>
<p>due to a head injury he suffered when he was four years old.</p>
<p>You see, he fell and hit his head</p>
<p>at a home construction site in their neighborhood</p>
<p>while his grandma was babysitting.</p>
<p>Joanne had been at the store</p>
<p>and when she came home,</p>
<p>there were ambulances there.</p>
<p>At first, doctors weren&rsquo;t sure he would survive.</p>
<p>He bounced back,</p>
<p>but there was a part of bone stuck in a way</p>
<p>the doctor said was too dangerous to remove</p>
<p>and it could affect his functioning skills.</p>
<p>The Simmons family was relieved</p>
<p>when little four-year-old Stuart</p>
<p>seemed to be himself after recovering from the injury.</p>
<p>He seemed like the same nice little boy</p>
<p>that everyone loved.</p>
<p>His sweet demeanor remained throughout adolescence,</p>
<p>but his parents noticed</p>
<p>that Stuart would make impulsive decisions</p>
<p>without weighing the consequences.</p>
<p>He would understand the effects of his actions,</p>
<p>but only after he decided to do something.</p>
<p>Joanne said this trait followed Stuart into adulthood</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s why he had made some bad decisions after boot camp.</p>
<p>Joanne called the base the day after she was hung up on</p>
<p>to try and file a missing persons report for Stuart,</p>
<p>but they told her that they wouldn&rsquo;t take a report</p>
<p>because at that point,</p>
<p>Stuart was considered a fugitive,</p>
<p>not a missing person.</p>
<p>Joanne said she begged them to be more understanding</p>
<p>and to try and help her,</p>
<p>but the office refused.</p>
<p>The entire day went by after that phone call</p>
<p>and Joanne had still not heard from her son.</p>
<p>As a last ditch effort,</p>
<p>she tried filing a missing persons report</p>
<p>with her local authorities in Fulton County, Georgia,</p>
<p>but because Stuart was an adult</p>
<p>who took off on his own in a different state,</p>
<p>the sheriff&rsquo;s department said</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t help her either.</p>
<p>Joanne felt completely helpless.</p>
<p>She and Bill kept hoping their son</p>
<p>would just call or walk through the front door,</p>
<p>but days and weeks went by and he never did.</p>
<p>Joanne said she felt like she might lose her mind,</p>
<p>like there was nothing at all she could do</p>
<p>to make sure her son was safe,</p>
<p>and she was especially worried</p>
<p>because of Stuart&rsquo;s old head injury.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;d taken off with no explanation</p>
<p>and had not called home,</p>
<p>Joanne worried that maybe he was suffering from amnesia,</p>
<p>like maybe he couldn&rsquo;t remember their home phone number</p>
<p>or where they lived.</p>
<p>She grappled daily with the thought of her son</p>
<p>out there alone somewhere, lost and confused.</p>
<p>What was especially frustrating for their family</p>
<p>in those first few days</p>
<p>was knowing there wasn&rsquo;t anyone looking for Stuart.</p>
<p>No law enforcement agency</p>
<p>would let Joanne file a missing persons report,</p>
<p>so there was no investigation going on</p>
<p>or any kind of search or any rescue effort underway.</p>
<p>Joanne had finally had enough</p>
<p>and decided to take matters into her own hands.</p>
<p>She and Bill hired a private investigator</p>
<p>the same week Stuart disappeared,</p>
<p>and that guy tracked down</p>
<p>and interviewed Stuart&rsquo;s friends in California,</p>
<p>but she told us the PI was stonewalled</p>
<p>by the Navy and wasn&rsquo;t able to turn up</p>
<p>much new or helpful information.</p>
<p>One night, a few months after Stuart vanished,</p>
<p>Joanne and Bill were watching TV</p>
<p>and they saw an episode of America&rsquo;s Most Wanted.</p>
<p>The story on their screen</p>
<p>talked about an unidentified skull</p>
<p>that had been found in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Joanne figured it couldn&rsquo;t hurt</p>
<p>to call and get more information.</p>
<p>I mean, they did have family in the Carolinas</p>
<p>and Georgia isn&rsquo;t too far away from where it was found.</p>
<p>So producers for the show</p>
<p>connected her with Duke University researchers</p>
<p>who were handling the skull</p>
<p>and she sent them Stuart&rsquo;s dental records.</p>
<p>After that, everyone waited and waited.</p>
<p>And finally, they found out the results.</p>
<p>The North Carolina skull did not belong to Stuart.</p>
<p>The Simmons felt both relief and frustration.</p>
<p>I mean, they were happy it wasn&rsquo;t confirmation of the worst,</p>
<p>but at the same time,</p>
<p>they were hoping for some kind of closure</p>
<p>or answers to their questions.</p>
<p>Either way, Joanne said it felt good to at least try.</p>
<p>After that, she and Bill worked for months</p>
<p>to have enough vacation time and money</p>
<p>to hit the road and search for their son themselves.</p>
<p>As soon as Joanne and Bill</p>
<p>got their younger daughters situated at college,</p>
<p>they headed west.</p>
<p>They made posters with Stuart&rsquo;s photo on them</p>
<p>and drove up and down the entire coast of California.</p>
<p>They even went down into Mexico searching for him.</p>
<p>They were willing to do anything to find him.</p>
<p>And during their weeks-long search,</p>
<p>Joanne had to think like her son.</p>
<p>One thing she knew for sure about Stuart</p>
<p>was if he did go AWOL from the Navy,</p>
<p>he would have gotten a job somewhere to make ends meet.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t just be hopping from town to town</p>
<p>without any income.</p>
<p>He had an impulsive streak, but according to Joanne,</p>
<p>Stuart was responsible and liked structure.</p>
<p>She said she knew her son was not a free spirit</p>
<p>who would abandon all responsibility</p>
<p>and be off partying somewhere.</p>
<p>After graduating high school,</p>
<p>Stuart had tried college,</p>
<p>but knew after just a few weeks of being enrolled</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t right for him.</p>
<p>He spent a few months trying to find himself</p>
<p>and figuring out what his passions were.</p>
<p>To get by, he worked odd jobs</p>
<p>as a bricklayer and a waiter.</p>
<p>So because he had experience in those industries,</p>
<p>Bill and Joanne checked diners and restaurants</p>
<p>during their search.</p>
<p>Another big reason they thought he could be working</p>
<p>in the service industry</p>
<p>was because of something he told them</p>
<p>right before he went missing.</p>
<p>Stuart&rsquo;s dad, Bill, said Stuart called home</p>
<p>from San Diego in the weeks leading up</p>
<p>to his disappearance and told them</p>
<p>that he was dating a woman he really liked named Margo.</p>
<p>During their conversation,</p>
<p>Stuart had mentioned that Margo was a waitress</p>
<p>and she was quite a bit older than him,</p>
<p>20 years older to be exact.</p>
<p>Joanne and Bill laughed when Stuart told them that</p>
<p>because that meant Margo was their age,</p>
<p>but they kept an open mind to the relationship</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t lecture him.</p>
<p>From what they could tell,</p>
<p>their son was happy with this woman</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all they ever wanted for their kids.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts though</p>
<p>and scouring the coastline for weeks,</p>
<p>looking in restaurants,</p>
<p>Bill and Joanne came up empty handed.</p>
<p>In the years that followed,</p>
<p>Joanne became an amateur sleuth in her spare time.</p>
<p>As the internet came about,</p>
<p>she would search coroner&rsquo;s websites</p>
<p>and look at photos of missing and unidentified people,</p>
<p>hoping one day she would see her son&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>What she couldn&rsquo;t imagine though</p>
<p>was that hundreds of miles away in Colorado,</p>
<p>the answers that she&rsquo;d been searching for for so long</p>
<p>were waiting with George Barter.</p>
<p>In 2014, after George got his positive ID on John Doe,</p>
<p>he called a detective in Roswell, Georgia</p>
<p>to notify Joanne and Bill Simmons</p>
<p>that their son had been found.</p>
<p>They called me a few minutes later</p>
<p>and were able to get him home to his parents.</p>
<p>It had been 32 years</p>
<p>since Joanne and Bill Simmons last heard from Stewart,</p>
<p>but they never gave up hope</p>
<p>that one day they would learn what happened to him.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d always wished that he would eventually</p>
<p>just walk through their front door</p>
<p>and explain that the last few decades</p>
<p>had just been some kind of wild mix-up,</p>
<p>but they knew deep down for a long time that he was dead.</p>
<p>They were in their late 70s</p>
<p>and they were relieved to finally learn the truth</p>
<p>before they themselves passed.</p>
<p>When they came out,</p>
<p>Meeting Stewart&rsquo;s parents opened a lot of doors for George.</p>
<p>Six years of hard work had finally paid off</p>
<p>and he could tell that they were grateful to have some answers.</p>
<p>Learning Stewart&rsquo;s identity also provided clues</p>
<p>as to who Jane Doe might be.</p>
<p>Joanne and Bill told George about Margo,</p>
<p>the girlfriend Stewart had mentioned</p>
<p>who worked as a waitress.</p>
<p>Now, there was no mention of a Margo</p>
<p>anywhere in George&rsquo;s old investigation.</p>
<p>But when they finally found out,</p>
<p>Now, there was no mention of a Margo</p>
<p>anywhere in George&rsquo;s old investigative files.</p>
<p>So with that new information in hand,</p>
<p>he ran with it and decided to do an exhumation</p>
<p>on Jane Doe&rsquo;s remains too.</p>
<p>But first, he had to find them.</p>
<p>George tracked down the Catholic priest</p>
<p>who buried Jane Doe in an Espanola,</p>
<p>New Mexico cemetery in the 80s.</p>
<p>The priest told George on the day of her burial,</p>
<p>he was the only one there besides the gravedigger.</p>
<p>But he thought he remembered where they buried her</p>
<p>despite there being no markings,</p>
<p>no cross, no plot number, or anything.</p>
<p>The priest hooked George</p>
<p>and a New Mexico FBI evidence recovery team</p>
<p>to the graveyard and pointed to an area</p>
<p>he thought Jane Doe was laid to rest.</p>
<p>But the father&rsquo;s memory was off.</p>
<p>And they sort of dig post holes around,</p>
<p>seeing if they can bring up a body bag</p>
<p>because we knew she was buried in the body bag.</p>
<p>And they find nothing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re failing on finding Jane Doe.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just awful.</p>
<p>George was about to give up</p>
<p>when he went back to the church</p>
<p>to see if he could find anyone else who better remembered</p>
<p>where the unidentified woman had been buried.</p>
<p>He thought maybe a longtime member of the congregation</p>
<p>who donated to the burial at the time</p>
<p>might remember more specifics.</p>
<p>When he got there, another priest intercepted him</p>
<p>and insisted they pray about it.</p>
<p>But George was skeptical and honestly kind of annoyed.</p>
<p>He had prayed about the case before.</p>
<p>And up until now, nothing but persistence and science</p>
<p>had gotten him anywhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done every weird thing.</p>
<p>I stood on the Caracas Bridge talking to the victims.</p>
<p>You guys, if there&rsquo;s anything left, help me.</p>
<p>George agreed to pray with the priest.</p>
<p>And when he left the church about 15 minutes later,</p>
<p>he called a local officer in New Mexico</p>
<p>who he&rsquo;d gotten to know, just as a courtesy</p>
<p>to let him know that he&rsquo;d be continuing</p>
<p>to poke around the graveyard</p>
<p>in their jurisdiction that weekend.</p>
<p>And the officer said,</p>
<p>wait, I think I know exactly where your Jane Doe is.</p>
<p>Turns out this officer and his cousin</p>
<p>had been digging a grave for their grandparents years before</p>
<p>and accidentally discovered an unmarked grave.</p>
<p>He says, when we were digging that grave,</p>
<p>we broke into a body bag next to it.</p>
<p>And I bet that is your victim.</p>
<p>And it was.</p>
<p>George checked the bag and it had the right markings</p>
<p>of the office that did Jane Doe&rsquo;s autopsy.</p>
<p>And the corpse was missing a skull.</p>
<p>They sent off Jane Doe&rsquo;s remains for testing.</p>
<p>And it was immediately clear</p>
<p>that she was going to be harder to identify</p>
<p>because there was no hit in CODIS,</p>
<p>a national database for DNA.</p>
<p>Then one day in 2014,</p>
<p>someone contacted George and it changed everything.</p>
<p>One day I get an email from a person</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an amateur sleuth guy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s people that just get on those networks</p>
<p>and try to connect them.</p>
<p>And he says, I think your victim might be</p>
<p>Margaret Walden from California.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>And I look at it and I&rsquo;m like, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>In May of 2014, George sent Margaret&rsquo;s sister</p>
<p>photos of a jacket and necklace</p>
<p>that was collected when the body was found.</p>
<p>She called George the same day and said,</p>
<p>yes, those items belonged to her sister.</p>
<p>She specifically knew the necklace</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;d been the one to give it to Margaret in 1973.</p>
<p>She also recognized Margaret&rsquo;s jacket.</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s sister told George</p>
<p>they reported Margaret missing in the summer of 1982</p>
<p>after she left San Diego to go camping in Colorado</p>
<p>with her boyfriend and then never returned.</p>
<p>The last time they ever heard from her</p>
<p>was when she called home from Durango, Colorado,</p>
<p>asking for money.</p>
<p>She had told her family that she wanted some cash</p>
<p>in order to leave Colorado and come home.</p>
<p>When they reported her missing,</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s family didn&rsquo;t even know the name of her boyfriend.</p>
<p>They guessed it was Steve.</p>
<p>So when her body was found in Colorado</p>
<p>and an investigation started,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t enough information out there</p>
<p>to lead police to a missing person from San Diego.</p>
<p>George got more confirmation a few months after</p>
<p>first speaking with Margaret&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>The New Mexico office of the medical investigator</p>
<p>said that they were able to get</p>
<p>a partial mitochondrial DNA match back.</p>
<p>And that showed with 98.27% probability</p>
<p>that Jane Doe was Margaret Walden.</p>
<p>And so we went to Victim&rsquo;s Assistance in New Mexico</p>
<p>and they paid for the cremation and got her home.</p>
<p>And I think her sister has her.</p>
<p>With both of his Doe&rsquo;s real identities confirmed,</p>
<p>George continued trying to piece together their story.</p>
<p>What he learned was that in June of 1982,</p>
<p>39-year-old Margaret Walden had been a waitress</p>
<p>near the Naval Base in San Diego.</p>
<p>She and Stewart started dating</p>
<p>and after he escaped serving his short stint of jail time</p>
<p>at the Naval Base,</p>
<p>they returned to the base one last time</p>
<p>and used Stewart&rsquo;s military ID to check out some camping gear.</p>
<p>And then they drove to Colorado.</p>
<p>Margaret got a job as a waitress in Durango</p>
<p>and Stewart got a job with a traveling carnival</p>
<p>that was in Pagosa Springs for the 4th of July.</p>
<p>George said it was at the carnival</p>
<p>that Stewart got mixed up with a bad group of people.</p>
<p>Based on his investigative work,</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s theory is that a group of people killed Stewart</p>
<p>over a small-time drug payment</p>
<p>and that Margaret was collateral damage.</p>
<p>George felt so strongly that this was the case,</p>
<p>just based on old interviews, new interviews,</p>
<p>and the physical evidence from the bus,</p>
<p>that he arrested two suspects,</p>
<p>33 years after the murders.</p>
<p>In 2016, 58-year-old Antoinette Palmer,</p>
<p>also known as Tina Madrid,</p>
<p>was arrested in Mesa, Arizona,</p>
<p>and booked on two counts of murder</p>
<p>and conspiracy to commit murder.</p>
<p>Also arrested was 70-year-old Martin Martinez,</p>
<p>who was picked up not far from the original crime scene</p>
<p>where he lived and he was booked on similar charges.</p>
<p>Tina ended up telling police during one of her interrogations</p>
<p>that Stewart had lived in her bus</p>
<p>for about a month back in the early 80s.</p>
<p>Except she told police his name was Richard Miller.</p>
<p>She talked about, you know, the things that happened in the bus</p>
<p>and she talked about knowing where they found the bodies.</p>
<p>She said, oh yeah, I know where those bodies were.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all in the interview.</p>
<p>Tina told police she had nothing to do with the double homicide,</p>
<p>but other witnesses told investigators</p>
<p>that Tina implicated herself several times.</p>
<p>She would tell people, yeah, if you mess with me,</p>
<p>I will kill you and throw you in a river</p>
<p>just like I did the other people I killed and threw in a river.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the charges against Tina and Martin were dismissed,</p>
<p>so they were never prosecuted.</p>
<p>George said the reason for this was because the district attorney</p>
<p>wanted more evidence before taking them to trial.</p>
<p>Stewart&rsquo;s mom, Joanne, said they would like to see</p>
<p>their son&rsquo;s killers prosecuted because as of now,</p>
<p>whoever killed Stewart and Margaret got away with it.</p>
<p>Despite the hurt of never getting justice for their son,</p>
<p>the Simmons were able to give Stewart a proper</p>
<p>and loving memorial service when they were given his remains.</p>
<p>He loved the water, so they got an eternal reef,</p>
<p>which is an environmentally safe reef with his cremation urn</p>
<p>that is placed on the ocean floor as a permanent memorial.</p>
<p>George and his wife were able to attend the ceremony.</p>
<p>You can actually see some photos of the memorial</p>
<p>on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 12 years since George decided to reinvestigate</p>
<p>the case of the San Juan River John and Jane Doe.</p>
<p>He might not have a conviction to show for it,</p>
<p>but knowing he helped two families find their lost</p>
<p>loved ones was a rewarding outcome.</p>
<p>You know, I just felt drawn to this from the beginning.</p>
<p>And even before I knew what happened and who they were,</p>
<p>I was drawn to them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d lay awake at night saying,</p>
<p>what can I do?</p>
<p>What else can I do?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, okay, if you get stuck,</p>
<p>just open up from page one and go through it again.</p>
<p>Like all the cold case stuff tells you just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve missed something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s got to be something more.</p>
<p>I just wasn&rsquo;t going to give up.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not done.</p>
<p>Even now, here we are again,</p>
<p>and I still have hopes that somehow, you know,</p>
<p>there will be a risk made in this.</p>
<p>And I think what makes the best detective is not the</p>
<p>smartest person in the world,</p>
<p>or maybe geniuses aren&rsquo;t that good of detectives.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s someone who doesn&rsquo;t quit.</p>
<p>I think his tenacity is the main thing.</p>
<p>His tenacity obviously paid off,</p>
<p>because when Stewart and Margaret&rsquo;s cold case cards</p>
<p>were printed on a Colorado unsolved deck,</p>
<p>it was back when Stewart had just been identified,</p>
<p>but Margaret&rsquo;s name was still unknown.</p>
<p>So on the Ace of Hearts, she&rsquo;s a Jane Doe,</p>
<p>with just the police sketch that was sent out</p>
<p>after her body was found.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know has any information</p>
<p>about the murders of Stewart Simmons and Margaret Walden,</p>
<p>even after all these years,</p>
<p>police want to know anything that could help strengthen their case.</p>
<p>The hope is that the agency can get enough concrete testimony</p>
<p>to finally be able to close the case</p>
<p>and criminally charge the people responsible.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a possible witness,</p>
<p>you could be the missing piece of the puzzle</p>
<p>needed for prosecution.</p>
<p>Please call the Archuleta County Colorado Sheriff&rsquo;s Department</p>
<p>at 970-264-8430.</p>
