    <p>You can&rsquo;t have a permanent war without fiat.</p>
<p>And I also think there&rsquo;s a case to be made</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t really have fiat without war.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Safety Namus,</p>
<p>one of the central and most impactful economists,</p>
<p>philosophers, and educators in the world of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an Austrian economist, an anarchist,</p>
<p>and the author of The Bitcoin Standard</p>
<p>and the new book, The Fiat Standard.</p>
<p>Safety does not mince words in his criticism of economists</p>
<p>and humans in general with whom he disagrees.</p>
<p>For example, Paul Krugman,</p>
<p>who is a neo Ecclidean economist</p>
<p>and a previous guest at this podcast.</p>
<p>Safety&rsquo;s opinions are strong and often controversial.</p>
<p>I do push back in this conversation,</p>
<p>playing devil&rsquo;s advocate or trying to steal man each side.</p>
<p>But as always, I do so in the service of exploring</p>
<p>the rich space of ideas that Safety has</p>
<p>about human nature and human civilization.</p>
<p>I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,</p>
<p>to come to your own conclusions.</p>
<p>That is the burden of being a free thinking human.</p>
<p>It is on each of us individually</p>
<p>to dive into this chaos of ideas.</p>
<p>And from that chaos,</p>
<p>discover long lasting universal wisdom to live by.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Safety Amoose.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a big question.</p>
<p>What is money?</p>
<p>And what is the role of money</p>
<p>in the history of human civilization?</p>
<p>Money is a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>The thing that defines money is that it is a good</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t buy for its own sake</p>
<p>because you wanna consume it itself</p>
<p>or because you want to employ it</p>
<p>in the production of other goods,</p>
<p>which is what capital goods are.</p>
<p>So we have consumption goods, we have capital goods.</p>
<p>Money is distinct from those two</p>
<p>because it is a good that is acquired</p>
<p>purely to be exchanged later on for other goods.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not something that you acquire for its own sake,</p>
<p>you acquire it so that you can then later on exchange it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a market good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a market good like all other goods.</p>
<p>You acquire food because you eat it,</p>
<p>you acquire a car to move you around,</p>
<p>you acquire money so that you can exchange it</p>
<p>for other goods.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that many people</p>
<p>have a hard time grasping,</p>
<p>of the concept of money as a market good.</p>
<p>But it is a market good, just like all others.</p>
<p>And the importance of it is that it allows us to trade.</p>
<p>It allows us to develop the division of labor,</p>
<p>which would not be possible</p>
<p>at any kind of sophisticated level without money.</p>
<p>So if we live in a small society of 10 people,</p>
<p>then think about all the things that we can make,</p>
<p>all the things that we can produce.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re only 10 people isolated from the world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only very few things that we can make.</p>
<p>And therefore we can exchange those things directly</p>
<p>with one another.</p>
<p>But as, you know, if we get in contact with other societies</p>
<p>that have more people,</p>
<p>then the opportunities for specialization increase.</p>
<p>You know, if there&rsquo;s 10 people,</p>
<p>the only thing that you can make is the very basics</p>
<p>you need for your survival.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re part of an economy of 10 million people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s much more room for specialization.</p>
<p>You can make a car, you can make a house,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very sophisticated.</p>
<p>And that relies on the division of labor.</p>
<p>That relies on you specializing</p>
<p>in doing one tiny little thing,</p>
<p>which is not what you consume.</p>
<p>You know, and you trade that thing</p>
<p>for all the things that you consume.</p>
<p>So as the economy becomes more sophisticated</p>
<p>and involves more people,</p>
<p>and currently we&rsquo;re all part of an economy</p>
<p>of almost 8 billion people,</p>
<p>each one of us produces one tiny little thing.</p>
<p>And they exchange that thing</p>
<p>for all the things that they want.</p>
<p>And so, because we specialize,</p>
<p>we become more productive</p>
<p>in doing the thing that we&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s people out there who are engineers,</p>
<p>who are designing windshields in cars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very specialized thing.</p>
<p>They sell windshield design to Mercedes Benz.</p>
<p>And then from that, you know,</p>
<p>that windshield design is added on</p>
<p>to millions of cars around the world.</p>
<p>And from that, they&rsquo;re able to get enough money</p>
<p>to meet all of their needs.</p>
<p>So the division of labor is enhanced enormously with money,</p>
<p>because without money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to be able to exchange</p>
<p>a large number of goods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to have a sophisticated economy</p>
<p>with a large degree of specialization,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very difficult to find people</p>
<p>who want the thing that you have</p>
<p>and have the thing that you want.</p>
<p>We call this the coincidence of wants.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the problem that money solves.</p>
<p>So you make apples and I make oranges.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to have some of your apples,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want my oranges.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, we have a problem of coincidence of wants.</p>
<p>So what do I do?</p>
<p>You want bananas.</p>
<p>I need to find somebody who has bananas,</p>
<p>give them my oranges, take their bananas,</p>
<p>give you their bananas, and then I take the apples.</p>
<p>In that case, bananas are a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s natural that a medium of exchange will evolve</p>
<p>and will emerge in an economy</p>
<p>as an economy becomes more sophisticated.</p>
<p>As we move beyond 10 people and 10 goods,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inevitable that we&rsquo;re going to come to a situation</p>
<p>where we have the problem of coincidence of wants.</p>
<p>And the way to solve that is to use a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>And it can be anything.</p>
<p>It can be a banana, it can be food stuff,</p>
<p>it can be any kind of good.</p>
<p>As long as I acquire the good</p>
<p>with the purpose of passing it on to you,</p>
<p>not for the purpose of me consuming it or using it,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>So when we look at the entirety of human society</p>
<p>of millions of billions of people,</p>
<p>you think of them, just a bunch of individuals running around.</p>
<p>I love the term coincidence of wants.</p>
<p>So each one of them, it&rsquo;s like a stochastic system.</p>
<p>They have desires, it&rsquo;s like a random collection of desires,</p>
<p>somehow rooted in our evolutionary history,</p>
<p>but mostly random in terms of preference</p>
<p>of banana or apple, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And then they also have the capacity for competence</p>
<p>and excellence in particular kind of labor.</p>
<p>So like specialization, they&rsquo;re able to be like incredible</p>
<p>at a particular set of tasks.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of ants running around</p>
<p>with consciousness and intelligence,</p>
<p>and they have desires and they have capabilities.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a coincidence of both the wants they have</p>
<p>and the capabilities they have,</p>
<p>and you wanted to create a system</p>
<p>that kind of exchanges those things.</p>
<p>So when you imagine like what is a good, what is markets?</p>
<p>When you imagine a market is like a hierarchical system,</p>
<p>what do you imagine?</p>
<p>What is a market?</p>
<p>A market is just the name</p>
<p>for the naturally emergent phenomena</p>
<p>of people voluntarily exchanging things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at any scale.</p>
<p>At any scale, yeah.</p>
<p>Individually, it could be a market of two people</p>
<p>on an island on their own.</p>
<p>It could be 8 billion people across the planet.</p>
<p>Naturally emerging.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the thing I think that is very hard</p>
<p>for many people who don&rsquo;t have a good understanding</p>
<p>of economics to grasp that capitalism and markets</p>
<p>are not something that you need a central planner</p>
<p>or a government officer to make happen.</p>
<p>Capitalism is just what happens</p>
<p>when people are left to their own devices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just our cognitive capacity allows us to develop tools</p>
<p>that we can use for production.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what humans have been doing</p>
<p>since they started making spears to hunt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first capital good probably.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re constantly accumulating capital.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly trading with one another.</p>
<p>We find an opportunity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a lot of oranges.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a lot of apples.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll take some of yours.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll take some of mine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both better off.</p>
<p>This is just a naturally emergent thing.</p>
<p>And money is what makes it enormously powerful.</p>
<p>Money is what allows it to scale really.</p>
<p>Money is what allows it to go beyond small societies</p>
<p>into just something that is global.</p>
<p>Because with money, again, as I was saying earlier,</p>
<p>all you need to do is specialize in doing one thing,</p>
<p>the thing that you do best,</p>
<p>and then you exchange that for money.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about whether the other people involved in this</p>
<p>want what you have and have what you want.</p>
<p>You just sell it for money to whoever wants it.</p>
<p>And you buy whatever you want from whoever has it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an enormous reduction in the mental burden</p>
<p>of how a market economy functions.</p>
<p>So the first thing that I would say about money</p>
<p>is that it allows for the division of labor</p>
<p>and it allows for the market system to grow.</p>
<p>And the second thing is that money is a mechanism</p>
<p>for storing value into the future.</p>
<p>So again, as humans, we develop the capacity</p>
<p>to think for the future.</p>
<p>We make a spear so that we can hunt,</p>
<p>and then we see that it works.</p>
<p>And then we take it out of the animal</p>
<p>that we hunted it with,</p>
<p>and we keep it for the next day&rsquo;s hunt.</p>
<p>And then we start making a better spear,</p>
<p>and we make a better fishing rod,</p>
<p>and then we make a fishing net,</p>
<p>and then we make a fishing boat.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s our ability to think of the future.</p>
<p>And as we start building durable goods,</p>
<p>we start thinking more and more of the future.</p>
<p>We start becoming more and more future oriented.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the process of civilization,</p>
<p>the process of denying our needs now</p>
<p>in order to think for the future.</p>
<p>So instead of spending all of our day on the beach,</p>
<p>enjoying ourselves, we take time off from leisure</p>
<p>on the beach and spend some time making a spear</p>
<p>or making a fishing rod so that our productivity</p>
<p>in hunting or fishing tomorrow is gonna be higher.</p>
<p>And so that ability to think for the future</p>
<p>is enhanced by our ability to provide for the future.</p>
<p>And we do that with durable goods.</p>
<p>But then money ends up being the best mechanism</p>
<p>for providing for the future,</p>
<p>because the future is uncertain.</p>
<p>So you can save your apples and oranges.</p>
<p>You can save the spears.</p>
<p>You can save the animal that you hunted.</p>
<p>But these things, first they rot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not very good at holding onto their value over time.</p>
<p>But even if they were,</p>
<p>even if you have objects that are durable,</p>
<p>the problem with them is that you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you need them tomorrow or next month or next year.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not sure if you&rsquo;re going to be needing them.</p>
<p>And you might end up not needing them.</p>
<p>And you might end up not finding anybody who needs them</p>
<p>or finding somebody who needs them,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t value them much</p>
<p>and won&rsquo;t give you much in exchange.</p>
<p>Money allows you the optionality</p>
<p>of saving the most liquid good, the most saleable good.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that you can sell tomorrow</p>
<p>with the least uncertainty.</p>
<p>It has the most liquidity, the most ability</p>
<p>to be sold without a loss in its value.</p>
<p>So money is our most advanced technology</p>
<p>and our best technology for moving value into the future.</p>
<p>And so I think history really,</p>
<p>I argue this in all my books,</p>
<p>is that really history we see,</p>
<p>we can think of it as a process of our money gets harder.</p>
<p>And so our money gets better</p>
<p>at holding onto its value for the future.</p>
<p>And by harder, I mean harder to produce.</p>
<p>We find things that are hard to produce</p>
<p>that are better at holding onto their value.</p>
<p>So they hold onto their value better for the future.</p>
<p>And that allows us to plot and plan for the future.</p>
<p>That makes the future less uncertain.</p>
<p>And that makes us more future oriented.</p>
<p>In other words, it lowers our time preference.</p>
<p>And the harder the money is,</p>
<p>the better it is at allowing us to think of the future.</p>
<p>So people should know that you&rsquo;ve written the book</p>
<p>Bitcoin Standard from 2018, I believe.</p>
<p>And then a new book called Fiat Standard.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Standard is considered kind of the Bible</p>
<p>in the cryptocurrency space, in the Bitcoin space</p>
<p>of just a very rigorous systematic explanation</p>
<p>of why Bitcoin, what is it, why should it be,</p>
<p>why is it good?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re describing in that book and in the new book,</p>
<p>different implementations of the technology of money.</p>
<p>In the new book, you talk about fiat money,</p>
<p>which is another way to do money.</p>
<p>So obviously, there&rsquo;s a lot of different ways to do money.</p>
<p>And maybe you haven&rsquo;t discovered the best way to do money,</p>
<p>yet our conversation today is how to do money better.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll go back to bananas eventually, right?</p>
<p>Very good reasons why we won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, we can disagree.</p>
<p>We can agree to disagree on this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open minded to the bananas.</p>
<p>One of the biggest source of joy to me</p>
<p>when I first came to this country is eating bananas.</p>
<p>And so maybe money, happiness, perishable happiness</p>
<p>will eventually become the best medium of exchange.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, open minded.</p>
<p>Anyway, so you mentioned hard money and soft money.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different ways to do money.</p>
<p>What is hard money?</p>
<p>What is soft money?</p>
<p>In the Bitcoin standard, I present the argument</p>
<p>that money is always whatever is the hardest thing to make.</p>
<p>Historically, I think we see many examples of that.</p>
<p>So for instance, in prison, people use cigarettes as money</p>
<p>because nobody can make cigarettes in prison.</p>
<p>In societies, we have the example of Yap Island,</p>
<p>for instance, it&rsquo;s an island that doesn&rsquo;t have any limestone</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a nearby island that has a lot of limestone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very expensive obviously with primitive technology</p>
<p>to move limestone from Palau to Yap.</p>
<p>So on Yap, limestones were money.</p>
<p>Seashells, rare seashells that are not easy to find</p>
<p>end up serving as money in places where they&rsquo;re rare.</p>
<p>Glass beads were money in West Africa</p>
<p>where there was no glass making technology</p>
<p>because they were imported from abroad</p>
<p>and they were very hard to make.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a conscious effort</p>
<p>of some people might recognize the hardness</p>
<p>and the scarcity and choose this as money.</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s more important</p>
<p>is just a natural evolutionary process</p>
<p>whereby people choose all kinds of random things as money,</p>
<p>bananas maybe even.</p>
<p>But then the people who end up making these bad choices</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t end up with any wealth left.</p>
<p>Whereas the people who store their wealth</p>
<p>in the things that are hard to make</p>
<p>end up maintaining their wealth</p>
<p>and maybe even increasing it over time.</p>
<p>And of course this culminated in the 19th century,</p>
<p>in the end of the 19th century</p>
<p>by basically the entire planet being on a gold standard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>What is a gold standard?</p>
<p>The gold standard is basically when money is gold</p>
<p>or at least government currencies backed by gold.</p>
<p>But the reason gold became money</p>
<p>and not copper, not nickel, not bananas</p>
<p>is that gold is the hardest metal in the world.</p>
<p>And it is the hardest metal to increase the supply of.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is based in chemistry.</p>
<p>So gold is indestructible.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t destroy gold in any meaningful sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been accumulating stockpiles for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The gold that was worn by Nefertiti back in ancient Egypt</p>
<p>is today probably in somebody&rsquo;s necklace</p>
<p>or in somebody&rsquo;s gold coin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>So for thousands of years, humans have been digging for gold.</p>
<p>They dig it out of the ground, they refine it</p>
<p>and then they put it in a jewelry or a coin</p>
<p>and then it just stays there.</p>
<p>It gets melted down into new other forms.</p>
<p>The jewelry gets turned into coins</p>
<p>or coins get turned into bars.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just stockpiles that are accumulating.</p>
<p>On the other hand, every year we get better</p>
<p>at our technology of looking for gold.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more people all over the world.</p>
<p>The population increases, the technology improves.</p>
<p>So we keep finding more and more gold</p>
<p>and we keep making the stockpiles bigger.</p>
<p>However, because we&rsquo;re constantly adding to a stockpile</p>
<p>that is not being devalued,</p>
<p>sorry, that is not being consumed</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no way of consuming gold.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t eat it, you can&rsquo;t burn it, it doesn&rsquo;t rust.</p>
<p>Because of that, we&rsquo;re constantly adding</p>
<p>to a constantly growing stockpile.</p>
<p>So if you look at the numbers,</p>
<p>you see over the last 100 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got pretty reliable data on gold production worldwide.</p>
<p>We see that pretty much gold stockpiles increase</p>
<p>at around one and a half to 2% per year, every year.</p>
<p>So yes, we&rsquo;re making more every year,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re making more so we&rsquo;re adding to the stockpile.</p>
<p>The stockpile grows more.</p>
<p>So every year we&rsquo;re adding only around one and a half</p>
<p>to 2%.</p>
<p>Compare that to the second highest,</p>
<p>the second hardest metal historically was silver.</p>
<p>And that increased historically at around maybe 5%</p>
<p>per year or so.</p>
<p>Now it probably increases at something like closer to 30%</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s now getting used extensively</p>
<p>in industrial uses.</p>
<p>So when you use it in industry,</p>
<p>when you put silver in a laptop or in a camera</p>
<p>or in a machine, effectively,</p>
<p>you are consuming the stockpile</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not used as money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken out of the monetary stockpile.</p>
<p>So over the last 150 years, since 1870 in particular,</p>
<p>and I discussed this in detail in the Bitcoin standard,</p>
<p>what happened in 1870 was Germany won</p>
<p>the Franco Prussian war and Germany was on a silver standard,</p>
<p>but the value of silvers was declining.</p>
<p>So Germany did something very smart,</p>
<p>which is they took their indemnity from France</p>
<p>in silver and gold and use that big chunk of gold</p>
<p>to switch to going on a gold standard.</p>
<p>And since then, silver has been collapsing in value</p>
<p>next to gold.</p>
<p>So back then the price of an ounce of gold</p>
<p>was around 15 ounces of silver.</p>
<p>Today it&rsquo;s closer to 100.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just been declining for the last 150 years.</p>
<p>And so because of that, because of the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s lost its monetary role</p>
<p>as people shifted toward gold,</p>
<p>the value of silver went down</p>
<p>and so it became economical to use it</p>
<p>in more and more industrial applications.</p>
<p>So the stockpile declines and then as a result</p>
<p>that weakens its monetary properties</p>
<p>more and more and more.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why by the end of the 19th century,</p>
<p>I mean at the beginning of the 19th century,</p>
<p>gold and silver were money.</p>
<p>By the end, it was basically only gold.</p>
<p>And the countries that were still on a silver standard,</p>
<p>China and India in particular suffered enormously from it</p>
<p>because their money was devaluing very quickly</p>
<p>next to gold and so Europeans who would come to China</p>
<p>or India were able to buy things</p>
<p>at practically a big discount.</p>
<p>So I hope it&rsquo;s okay if I ask very simple,</p>
<p>very basic questions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s few people in this world that are good,</p>
<p>as good as you are at answering very basic,</p>
<p>almost ridiculously basic questions</p>
<p>because I think exploring questions like what is money</p>
<p>is a really great way to think from first principles,</p>
<p>to really think deeply about this world.</p>
<p>So I really appreciate you doing that.</p>
<p>When you say standard, what does it mean?</p>
<p>When you say silver standard, gold standard,</p>
<p>again with a basic question.</p>
<p>The term really I think was based out of gold.</p>
<p>The first time this came out was the gold standard</p>
<p>because so I said gold was money</p>
<p>at the end of the 19th century,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t just that everybody was using gold coins</p>
<p>and trading with gold coins</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s got a problem of divisibility.</p>
<p>So a lot of things are worth less than one gold coin.</p>
<p>So how do you buy that thing?</p>
<p>And the answer was that you created the monetary instruments</p>
<p>that were backed by gold and so currencies,</p>
<p>national currencies under the gold standard</p>
<p>were specific units of gold</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how a gold standard functioned.</p>
<p>Money was gold, but you had pieces of paper</p>
<p>that were redeemable in gold.</p>
<p>So you could go to the central bank,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d give them the piece of paper,</p>
<p>the $100 bill or the $10 bill</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you gold in exchange</p>
<p>and they give you a specific quantity of gold in exchange.</p>
<p>Effectively, the paper was just a receipt for gold.</p>
<p>So the paper exactly represented the amount of gold.</p>
<p>Exactly, that was the plan.</p>
<p>That was what it&rsquo;s supposed to do,</p>
<p>but arguably we never had a pure gold standard</p>
<p>because the nature of gold means</p>
<p>that the people who are in charge of the gold,</p>
<p>they have an enormous amount of power</p>
<p>because the gold is concentrated with them</p>
<p>and as long as not everybody shows up at the same time</p>
<p>asking for their gold,</p>
<p>then you can make more receipts than you have gold.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always shady stuff going on,</p>
<p>but at least that&rsquo;s the state of gold</p>
<p>is the receipts should exactly represent</p>
<p>the amount of gold there.</p>
<p>And also when you say standard,</p>
<p>it means that governments sort of publicly stated</p>
<p>that this is the approved,</p>
<p>the main way of making transactions that are monetary.</p>
<p>So this is the money, this is the official money</p>
<p>that you should be using if you live in this country.</p>
<p>Yes, although I would say it&rsquo;s more like</p>
<p>the other way around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the governments established gold as money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like gold gave the governments</p>
<p>the credibility for their currencies.</p>
<p>So governments were not the ones that made gold money.</p>
<p>Gold has been money before states were invented.</p>
<p>States, if you have a government</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d like to have some legitimacy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d like to be able to deal with other governments</p>
<p>on an equal footing, you had to go by the gold standard.</p>
<p>You had to have a currency that was redeemable in gold</p>
<p>so that you could trade with the rest of the world</p>
<p>so that people could in your country use that currency.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that governments were choosing gold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like they were having to adapt</p>
<p>their own currencies to gold</p>
<p>in order to give their currencies credibility.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a dance there though,</p>
<p>because if they had to,</p>
<p>then why did they switch away from it after?</p>
<p>So there is a dance where the governments,</p>
<p>the people pressure.</p>
<p>So first of all, the basic characteristics</p>
<p>of the hard money pressures the governments</p>
<p>and the people in terms of what should be used.</p>
<p>Then the people, based on their community,</p>
<p>the network effects, the narratives they tell each other,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, they pressure the governments</p>
<p>to take on a particular money.</p>
<p>Then the governments, they like power,</p>
<p>they like control, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>They pressure the people</p>
<p>and tell different kinds of narratives.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a dance going on in this evolution</p>
<p>of what technology to use for a monetary system.</p>
<p>So the reason I don&rsquo;t know if governments had to,</p>
<p>because they clearly didn&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>because they eventually moved away from it.</p>
<p>But there was pressure probably.</p>
<p>Yeah, but even after they moved away from it,</p>
<p>central banks, until today,</p>
<p>they still hold a lot of gold reserves.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at 1914,</p>
<p>when the world really went off the gold standard,</p>
<p>the amount of gold reserves held by central banks</p>
<p>was a tiny fraction of what it was.</p>
<p>As time went on,</p>
<p>central banks accumulated more and more gold.</p>
<p>What ended up happening is they prevented their citizens</p>
<p>from using the gold, but they continued to use it.</p>
<p>So gold continued to be money up until 1971</p>
<p>because effectively the world was on a dollar standard</p>
<p>and the dollars were backed by gold.</p>
<p>But then after 1971, even then,</p>
<p>central banks continued to accumulate gold</p>
<p>because why would you as a central bank</p>
<p>want to accumulate pieces of paper effectively</p>
<p>or credit liabilities of another central bank</p>
<p>that can produce them infinitely?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lesson that&rsquo;s becoming more and more obvious</p>
<p>to governments today,</p>
<p>as we see US sanctions taking, say, Russian reserves</p>
<p>or Afghanistan reserves.</p>
<p>And this is why we see China and Russia</p>
<p>have accumulated a lot of gold over the last 10, 20 years.</p>
<p>So just to return to the question of definitions,</p>
<p>so what is hard money versus soft money?</p>
<p>Yes, so hard, I mean, it&rsquo;s a relative thing,</p>
<p>but the hardness refers to the difficulty</p>
<p>of producing more units of the money supply.</p>
<p>So an easy money would be a money</p>
<p>that is relatively easy to make.</p>
<p>So you can increase the supply by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50%</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So pretty much all commodities, all market commodities,</p>
<p>other than gold and silver, they&rsquo;re easy money</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not suitable as a monetary medium</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re being consumed.</p>
<p>So if you look at, and in the Bitcoin standard,</p>
<p>I mentioned this metric called the stock to flow ratio,</p>
<p>which is the ratio of the annual production, the flow,</p>
<p>to the stockpile, the existing stockpile.</p>
<p>If you look at all the other metals,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re easy money because they&rsquo;re being consumed.</p>
<p>So think about how much stockpiles of copper</p>
<p>there are in the world today.</p>
<p>So copper companies obviously have</p>
<p>some stockpiles of copper.</p>
<p>Major copper consumers will have stockpiles of copper,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of copper</p>
<p>is essentially on a conveyor belt of production</p>
<p>from the mine straight to the consumer good</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s being used for.</p>
<p>So the existing stockpiles are roughly</p>
<p>in the range of one year&rsquo;s production.</p>
<p>If you take all of the companies,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have exact statistics,</p>
<p>hence it&rsquo;s very difficult to get these,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s roughly in the same range.</p>
<p>Like if copper production were to stop completely today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have about a year&rsquo;s production</p>
<p>stored in various places.</p>
<p>So that makes copper terrible money</p>
<p>because if you started using copper as money,</p>
<p>and this is why a lot of people say,</p>
<p>well, money is a collective illusion.</p>
<p>Money is a social construct.</p>
<p>If we all agree that something is money,</p>
<p>then something is money.</p>
<p>I think this is completely clueless,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s usually Marxists who believe this,</p>
<p>obviously no understanding of economics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely clueless</p>
<p>because even if everybody in society</p>
<p>decided we wanted to make copper as money,</p>
<p>even if we all decided to collectively</p>
<p>take part in this hallucination or illusion,</p>
<p>it would not make copper money.</p>
<p>It would just make everybody who decides</p>
<p>to take part in this hallucination poor, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It would make copper miners rich.</p>
<p>It would make all of the people</p>
<p>who chose copper as money poor,</p>
<p>and copper would not be money.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t work because what happens is,</p>
<p>because of the fact that the stockpiles are so small,</p>
<p>if you buy, you know,</p>
<p>even if you get the 1,000 richest people in the world,</p>
<p>all of the world&rsquo;s billionaires,</p>
<p>they get together,</p>
<p>and they all dump all of the money that they have,</p>
<p>all the stocks, all the bonds, all the gold,</p>
<p>all of the Bitcoin, everything that they own,</p>
<p>they dump it, and they buy copper with it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen?</p>
<p>Price of copper is gonna go up a lot,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s gonna stop copper miners</p>
<p>from flooding the market with even more copper</p>
<p>than what the billionaires bought?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna dump all of that extra copper production.</p>
<p>If the price of copper is gonna go up</p>
<p>so there will be a lot more copper mining</p>
<p>than all the other metals,</p>
<p>a lot of nickel companies and gold miners</p>
<p>are gonna switch to focusing on copper,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re gonna dump an enormous amount of copper</p>
<p>on the market.</p>
<p>The value of copper is gonna crash,</p>
<p>and the people who chose copper as money</p>
<p>are just gonna end up with large warehouses</p>
<p>of very cheap rusting metal.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a brilliant description,</p>
<p>and that kind of pushes towards gold</p>
<p>where the stock to flow ratio,</p>
<p>I guess you would say is 1.5 to 2%,</p>
<p>like you mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>That would be like the inverse of the stock to flow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the supply growth rate,</p>
<p>so the stock to flow is the inverse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s around 60.</p>
<p>60, got it.</p>
<p>But let me push back on,</p>
<p>as somebody who likes human psychology,</p>
<p>let me push back on the collective hallucination</p>
<p>and the illusion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for copper, but what about paper money?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, you can&rsquo;t smoke it,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t eat it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s supposed to represent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to just be the medium of exchange,</p>
<p>and in that sense, what role does collective hallucination</p>
<p>play in the effectiveness of money?</p>
<p>Exactly zero, because all of the paper money,</p>
<p>first of all, there&rsquo;s never been an instance,</p>
<p>and again, this flies in the face</p>
<p>of a lot of what a lot of people like to think about money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never been an instance</p>
<p>where a government came out and said,</p>
<p>all right, we&rsquo;re printing out these pieces of paper,</p>
<p>use them as money.</p>
<p>This one is worth 10 apples or use it for buying things,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the piece of paper.</p>
<p>This has never happened.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve always taken fiat money, paper money,</p>
<p>all of these things were always born out of fraud.</p>
<p>Initially, it was a receipt for gold,</p>
<p>and then they told you, well, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need the gold anyway, and you have to use this,</p>
<p>and then if you don&rsquo;t use it, we throw you in jail.</p>
<p>And then, so first of all, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t enforce this thing,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s never really just happened,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never been hallucinated into existence.</p>
<p>People can hallucinate this kind of nonsense</p>
<p>in writing textbooks and books and in academia,</p>
<p>but in the real world, people don&rsquo;t hallucinate money.</p>
<p>People are very careful about what they put their money in.</p>
<p>For people listening,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have fun in this conversation,</p>
<p>because you already said Marxist, fraud, hallucination,</p>
<p>just because we use these words doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re true,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re fun to talk about.</p>
<p>So you have a strong certainty about the way you talk,</p>
<p>which I think is fun,</p>
<p>but allow me in my dumb self to push back,</p>
<p>to play devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll actually ask you sometimes</p>
<p>to play devil&rsquo;s advocate if possible,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re smarter than me on all this stuff,</p>
<p>so we want the smartest devil&rsquo;s advocate possible,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certainly not that, but anyway,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, we are currently on a fiat standard,</p>
<p>so money does have value, paper money,</p>
<p>and the reason it has value</p>
<p>is because we believe it has value.</p>
<p>To what degree, if we put the hallucination word aside,</p>
<p>the belief that something is worth value</p>
<p>is actually value, and is the thing that helps money work,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s fraud,</p>
<p>and the belief is almost valueless,</p>
<p>but how much value?</p>
<p>Can we quantify the value of the belief,</p>
<p>the collective belief?</p>
<p>I should say, all economics is subjective.</p>
<p>I consider myself an Austrian school economist,</p>
<p>and the starting point of all Austrian economics</p>
<p>is that all value is subjective,</p>
<p>so obviously, value only exists</p>
<p>because humans choose to make the valuation.</p>
<p>However, the economic reality of the way that money works</p>
<p>means that it&rsquo;s just a technology like all others,</p>
<p>and so for me, when people say,</p>
<p>well, if we hallucinate that this thing can be money,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;ll be money.</p>
<p>If we can hallucinate bananas to be money,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;ll be money.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s like saying, well, if we hallucinate</p>
<p>that bananas can be spaceships, they&rsquo;ll be spaceships.</p>
<p>I mean, you can call them spaceships if you want,</p>
<p>but a banana&rsquo;s not gonna get you to the moon.</p>
<p>Well, then nevertheless, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re drawing a big distinction</p>
<p>between physical reality and the space of belief,</p>
<p>but it seems like so much power of human civilization,</p>
<p>so much destruction, so much creativity, creation,</p>
<p>happens in our minds.</p>
<p>Absolutely, everything does happen in the mind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get to the moon,</p>
<p>but you might still have a significant impact</p>
<p>on human civilization if a lot of people believe a thing.</p>
<p>True, but economic reality exists in a way</p>
<p>in which your beliefs are rewarded</p>
<p>when they match up with economic reality,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re punished when they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So if you ride a banana and jump off a cliff</p>
<p>thinking you&rsquo;re gonna get to the moon,</p>
<p>that solves the problem of people thinking</p>
<p>that bananas are spaceships by killing people</p>
<p>who think that bananas are spaceships.</p>
<p>And I think, to go back to your question</p>
<p>in terms of paper monies, so yes,</p>
<p>even though ignoring the original sin</p>
<p>of the creation of fiat money,</p>
<p>and ignoring everything that happened before 1971,</p>
<p>all right, well, here we are, people are using,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s not really paper money.</p>
<p>We should say fiat money is predominantly credit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also a digital currency.</p>
<p>So more than 90% of dollars are digital.</p>
<p>Less than 10% of dollars are physical.</p>
<p>So it is a digital currency,</p>
<p>and all over the world, all these governments</p>
<p>are using digital currencies effectively</p>
<p>with some physical manifestations in paper.</p>
<p>But yet, even within these currencies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still the same analysis,</p>
<p>and I discussed this in chapter four,</p>
<p>the Bitcoin standard.</p>
<p>You look at government monies,</p>
<p>you see that the currencies that have held onto their value,</p>
<p>the ones that have the biggest value,</p>
<p>the ones that play the biggest role in global trade,</p>
<p>the ones that are used as currency reserves</p>
<p>all over the world,</p>
<p>are the ones that have the lowest supply growth rate.</p>
<p>The ones that grow, whose central banks</p>
<p>are the least inflationary.</p>
<p>And on the other hand,</p>
<p>the ones who supplies more inflationary,</p>
<p>similar to copper, end up failing.</p>
<p>You look at Lebanon, Venezuela, Zimbabwe,</p>
<p>these are currencies whose supply increases very quickly,</p>
<p>and therefore, their value collapses.</p>
<p>Whereas the dollar, the Swiss franc, the Euro,</p>
<p>the British pound, the Japanese yen,</p>
<p>they increase at a much lower rate in general</p>
<p>than these terrible currencies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why all over the world,</p>
<p>you see people are looking to get more dollars</p>
<p>and more of these harder currencies than the easier ones.</p>
<p>So I think this analysis of the hardness of the money</p>
<p>and the ease of money is pretty well supported empirically.</p>
<p>So like you said, you&rsquo;re at least in part,</p>
<p>or in whole, consider yourself an Austrian economist.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re perhaps a great person to ask about the basics.</p>
<p>What is Austrian economics?</p>
<p>What is Keynesian economics?</p>
<p>How do you compare the two?</p>
<p>What should people know?</p>
<p>What are the interesting defining characteristics</p>
<p>to you about these schools of thought?</p>
<p>So Austrian economics, the way that I say it,</p>
<p>Austrian economics is economics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we call it Austrian economics</p>
<p>because economics has been hijacked</p>
<p>by a bunch of frauds, really.</p>
<p>Or people who are wrong, okay.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s much worse than wrong,</p>
<p>by people who are just essentially propagandists</p>
<p>for inflation.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your opinion, man.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s also like your opinion, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you asked.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Well, I also talked to Paul Krugman on this podcast.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, the O speaks enough,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s one of the people</p>
<p>that is perhaps most harshly criticized</p>
<p>by folks in Austrian economics perspective</p>
<p>and vice versa, which is a fascinating tension.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s done a great job as an actor</p>
<p>who plays an economist on TV and the internet.</p>
<p>So anyway, now tell me what you really think.</p>
<p>No, but, so the basics of what is Austrian economics?</p>
<p>What is the, what perspective does it take on the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, Austrian economics really is</p>
<p>the continuation of a tradition</p>
<p>that it goes back to the ancient Greeks</p>
<p>of studying economics.</p>
<p>Historically, it&rsquo;s really just economics</p>
<p>and that has evolved over time.</p>
<p>And the establishment of the Austrian school per se</p>
<p>came in 1871, 150 years ago,</p>
<p>when Karl Menger, the father of the school,</p>
<p>wrote a book called Principles of Economics</p>
<p>and essentially invented marginal analysis,</p>
<p>which is a big deal in economics.</p>
<p>Marginal analysis is the idea that in economics,</p>
<p>individuals carry out decisions at the margin,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s, when you make choice, you&rsquo;re not making it.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;re making a choice</p>
<p>between what should I spend my money on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not making a choice whether it is,</p>
<p>this thing is object A or B,</p>
<p>which one is more valuable for me in general,</p>
<p>which one is more valuable for me for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re choosing about the next unit right now</p>
<p>at this point, at this stage.</p>
<p>And if you analyze economic decision making at the margin,</p>
<p>it makes a lot more sense and you can understand</p>
<p>why people decide and make the decisions that they do.</p>
<p>Whereas if you don&rsquo;t apply marginal analysis,</p>
<p>things don&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>The key thing that marginal analysis helps us solve</p>
<p>is what is called the water diamond paradox.</p>
<p>So you will die without water.</p>
<p>We all need water and yet water is dirt cheap.</p>
<p>Whereas diamonds are extremely superfluous,</p>
<p>nobody needs them.</p>
<p>Nobody is gonna live or die because they have a diamond</p>
<p>and yet they&rsquo;re extremely expensive.</p>
<p>So why is it that as human beings,</p>
<p>we pay maybe say a dollar a liter for water,</p>
<p>whereas we pay thousands of dollars</p>
<p>for a few grams of diamonds.</p>
<p>Why is this the case?</p>
<p>Do we value water less than diamond?</p>
<p>The answer is no, but at the margin where we are right now,</p>
<p>you live in a place where water is very abundant</p>
<p>because cities are only built in places</p>
<p>where water is abundant.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re only making a choice</p>
<p>about the next unit of water.</p>
<p>And so water is extremely abundant</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re choosing about whether to spend</p>
<p>the next unit of money on water.</p>
<p>The valuation that you give to water,</p>
<p>given that you have a lot of water at home</p>
<p>and that you live in a place that has abundant water</p>
<p>is pretty low to the marginal unit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very high for water overall.</p>
<p>So if I asked you,</p>
<p>how much would you spend for water in general?</p>
<p>How much would you pay for water for all of your life?</p>
<p>It would be a lot higher than diamonds.</p>
<p>If I told you, you can only have water or diamonds</p>
<p>for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>You choose water, obviously,</p>
<p>but nobody&rsquo;s ever had to make that choice.</p>
<p>You only make your choices at the margin.</p>
<p>So at the margin where we are, modern civilization,</p>
<p>we have an abundance of water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have civilization</p>
<p>and diamonds are very rare and scarce.</p>
<p>And people are only buying,</p>
<p>you buy your first diamond when you&rsquo;re gonna get married,</p>
<p>you give it to your wife</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna be the first few grams of diamond</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s ever gonna own.</p>
<p>Giving my wife water.</p>
<p>Smart move.</p>
<p>You should definitely give her Bitcoin instead of diamonds.</p>
<p>I tell my wife, I occasionally remind her</p>
<p>of how many Bitcoin we could have had</p>
<p>if I bought her Bitcoin with the price of the diamond ring.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the downside of, by the way, diamonds</p>
<p>from the analysis of like gold and so on?</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Arguably, diamonds are a scam.</p>
<p>Because they became popular as a thing in marriage</p>
<p>after gold was banned,</p>
<p>after gold ownership was banned in the US in the 1930s</p>
<p>and in many places around the world.</p>
<p>So before that, you&rsquo;d give gold.</p>
<p>And the reason you&rsquo;d give gold in a dowry, in a wedding</p>
<p>is because it wasn&rsquo;t just that it&rsquo;s pretty and shiny,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>And so if you die, your wife can take the gold</p>
<p>and she can live off of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a demonstration that you&rsquo;re giving her</p>
<p>something valuable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because nobody can make a lot more gold.</p>
<p>It has the high stock to flow ratio.</p>
<p>But then they banned gold ownership,</p>
<p>or they allowed people to only own</p>
<p>very tiny quantities of gold.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when the diamond industry stepped in</p>
<p>and marketed diamonds as the thing that you need to give.</p>
<p>But the problem with it is, of course,</p>
<p>that the diamonds aren&rsquo;t like gold.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not very hard to make more of.</p>
<p>And the reason we have scarcity in diamonds</p>
<p>is really artificial.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s effectively a monopoly of diamond producers.</p>
<p>They restrict the supply.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pretty dirty business.</p>
<p>And the way that they do it is,</p>
<p>all of the talk about blood diamonds</p>
<p>is a way for them to ensure their monopoly.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re part of the monopoly of diamond producers,</p>
<p>then it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many people get killed</p>
<p>producing your diamonds.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re out of the monopoly,</p>
<p>then human rights organizations descend on you</p>
<p>and call for shutting you down for selling blood diamonds.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also restricting</p>
<p>the production of artificial diamonds.</p>
<p>This is the other thing.</p>
<p>You can make artificial diamond,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t make artificial gold.</p>
<p>So they restrict the production of artificial diamond</p>
<p>and they try and insist that, you know,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t take artificial diamonds,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re indistinguishable from real diamonds.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an artificial scarcity.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s gonna come a point at some point</p>
<p>that this monopoly is gonna break.</p>
<p>And a lot of people are gonna be left with essentially</p>
<p>highly devalued jewelry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take this segment of the podcast,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m getting married, when the sun&rsquo;s up,</p>
<p>and then instead you&rsquo;re getting water or Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Yes, water and Bitcoin is all you need.</p>
<p>So marginal analysis, focusing on the margin</p>
<p>is the thing that allows you</p>
<p>to most accurately capture human nature,</p>
<p>the actual day to day decisions that we humans make.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really revolutionized economics, so 1870.</p>
<p>And that was Menger&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>And then he had a student, Eugen Bomberg,</p>
<p>who developed capital theory.</p>
<p>And then he had a student, Ludwig von Mises,</p>
<p>who is arguably the most important economist ever.</p>
<p>And he developed theory of money.</p>
<p>And he wrote a book in 1912</p>
<p>called The Theory of Money and Credit.</p>
<p>And then in the 40s, he wrote Human Action,</p>
<p>which is a big treatise on economics.</p>
<p>And I think this is the correct tradition of economics.</p>
<p>And before World War I, this was just known as economics.</p>
<p>And then after what happened in World War I,</p>
<p>and I discussed this in detail in the Fiat Standard,</p>
<p>is that the Bank of England essentially went off gold</p>
<p>and tried to pass off their own credit</p>
<p>as being as good as gold in order to finance the war.</p>
<p>And incidentally here,</p>
<p>this is part of the history that is not discussed often.</p>
<p>This is presented as an innovation.</p>
<p>Later on, they needed essentially a propaganda school</p>
<p>that would justify what they did.</p>
<p>And later on, it&rsquo;s presented as,</p>
<p>oh, hey, we realized that gold was not good.</p>
<p>And now look, we&rsquo;ve built this thing</p>
<p>that is better than gold,</p>
<p>where now the government can just print money</p>
<p>whenever it wants.</p>
<p>And now gold money is not an issue anymore,</p>
<p>which is extremely idiotic</p>
<p>because the whole point of money</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not easy to make.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s easy to make, it&rsquo;s not money anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just destroying the entire function of money.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen that happen extensively</p>
<p>in the 20th century</p>
<p>after countries went off the gold standard.</p>
<p>So essentially Keynesian economics</p>
<p>is just inflation apologia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just propaganda to justify inflationism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s profoundly nonsensical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built on the idea that if you just make more money,</p>
<p>you can stimulate economic production.</p>
<p>And of course, this is very self serving</p>
<p>to the central banks and to the banks</p>
<p>and to the governments who promote this nonsense.</p>
<p>And this is also very pervasive.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had the misfortune of studying at a university</p>
<p>over the last century,</p>
<p>you were taught Keynesian garbage economics.</p>
<p>You were taught that if there&rsquo;s a problem in the economy,</p>
<p>the way to fix it is that the government prints money,</p>
<p>the government lowers the interest rate,</p>
<p>and then that leads to more economic production,</p>
<p>which is completely nonsensical.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, again, for the listener,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using strong words, you know, push back</p>
<p>just to find, to please devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>to hopefully one day arrive at the truth.</p>
<p>So just because it&rsquo;s in the interest</p>
<p>of the central banks and the government,</p>
<p>the interests and the models of Keynesian economics</p>
<p>and the government are aligned doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s give them a chance.</p>
<p>So the conventional wisdom, perhaps economics wisdom,</p>
<p>is that inflation is good in moderation</p>
<p>as it encourages spending,</p>
<p>but too much is bad because it completely devalues,</p>
<p>destroys people&rsquo;s savings.</p>
<p>So a little bit of inflation is good to stimulate spending.</p>
<p>And I mean, I suppose this is one of the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s supported by Keynesian economics.</p>
<p>Why is that wrong?</p>
<p>This is basically the whole point of Keynesian economics,</p>
<p>is to try and find an endless array of explanations</p>
<p>to explain why inflation is a good thing.</p>
<p>Well, the chicken and the egg.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the cynical take.</p>
<p>This is a propaganda machine</p>
<p>to sell the government&rsquo;s narrative.</p>
<p>The less cynical take is there&rsquo;s a bunch of economists</p>
<p>who are telling, who&hellip;</p>
<p>Who figured out this thing</p>
<p>and it happens to be good for banks and governments.</p>
<p>Just because it&rsquo;s good for them doesn&rsquo;t mean&hellip;</p>
<p>And it justifies the existence of government</p>
<p>and your basic, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s your basic assumption,</p>
<p>but a foundational principle of your thought</p>
<p>is that a lot of government is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Your first gut instinct, government bad.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, I live next door to Michael Malice,</p>
<p>who probably beats you on the intensity</p>
<p>and how quickly he says government bad.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a potential argument for government good.</p>
<p>Some government is good.</p>
<p>Maybe a lot of government is good.</p>
<p>Maybe we need a lot of centralized management</p>
<p>for resource allocation and so on</p>
<p>because we humans specialize, we&rsquo;re too busy and so on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an argument for that that exists.</p>
<p>You probably disagree with any possible argument</p>
<p>on that side, but anyway,</p>
<p>so why is that idea of Keynesian economics wrong?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna focus for this on the money idea,</p>
<p>the idea that a little bit of inflation is good.</p>
<p>The idea here, I mean, the criticism is that</p>
<p>without inflation, people wouldn&rsquo;t spend</p>
<p>and then the economy would come to a grinding halt.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s nonsensical because people spend</p>
<p>not because they wanna keep this magical monster</p>
<p>called the economy going.</p>
<p>People spend because they need to consume</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how we live, that&rsquo;s how we survive.</p>
<p>You need to eat, you need shelter,</p>
<p>you need clothes to keep you warm.</p>
<p>And as technology advances, the capabilities</p>
<p>of the things that we can do with our time increases</p>
<p>and so we wanna buy more things.</p>
<p>So people buy things because people want to consume.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a limitless desire to consume,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no shortage of reasons for people to consume,</p>
<p>shortage of reasons for people to consume,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s food or Ferraris or private jets.</p>
<p>People just always wanna buy more.</p>
<p>Can I interrupt just really quick?</p>
<p>What about the fear about the uncertainty of the future</p>
<p>where they might want to buy things</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re really afraid because it seems like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot like a pandemic going on or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So fear of uncertainty, can you have too much fear?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, what I was saying is,</p>
<p>I was making the point that we don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to be motivated to consume.</p>
<p>Like we have the insatiable desire to consume.</p>
<p>Everybody would like to have more of all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Everybody would like to have a bigger house.</p>
<p>Well, not everybody, some people have a big enough house</p>
<p>but everybody would like a house,</p>
<p>everybody would like a car, jet, all kinds of things,</p>
<p>electronics, machines.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t need a desire to consume.</p>
<p>But of course the limit on how much we consume</p>
<p>is opportunity cost.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you buy a Ferrari?</p>
<p>Well, because that&rsquo;s really expensive</p>
<p>and it would mean that, well, maybe you do have a Ferrari</p>
<p>but I mean, most people don&rsquo;t buy a Ferrari</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too expensive, they can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have to work too hard to get it.</p>
<p>And if they do get it, it might mean that</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t afford their house anymore.</p>
<p>So we have to economize, that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>And we have to also think of the future.</p>
<p>And so humans consume,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need more motivation to consume.</p>
<p>We have to deal with the economic reality</p>
<p>of the things that limit us from consuming more.</p>
<p>So what Keynesians present is that</p>
<p>when there is a problem in the economy,</p>
<p>like there was after World War I,</p>
<p>the problem is always caused by the inflation.</p>
<p>And what the Keynesian hucksters do</p>
<p>is that they look at the inflation,</p>
<p>at the consequences of inflation</p>
<p>and blame it on people not spending enough.</p>
<p>When people are doing the rational thing,</p>
<p>the money is, so there was inflation,</p>
<p>caused an unsustainable boom, it caused the recession.</p>
<p>And now a lot of people lost their jobs</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have enough money</p>
<p>to go out and spend frivolously.</p>
<p>So they save for the future, the future is uncertain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing, that&rsquo;s how you fix things.</p>
<p>You begin the recovery by, well, you lost some wealth,</p>
<p>so you spend less, like if your business goes bust,</p>
<p>if you lose your job, it&rsquo;s natural and smart</p>
<p>that you stop spending money</p>
<p>on the frivolous thing that you used to spend</p>
<p>and you save it for the future.</p>
<p>You invest in something else, you get a new job.</p>
<p>And then once you&rsquo;ve recovered, you start spending more.</p>
<p>This is very sane and very good</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the way to recovery.</p>
<p>But essentially the Keynesians have used this</p>
<p>as a justification for more inflation</p>
<p>because inflation is an addiction.</p>
<p>Once the government gets down the path</p>
<p>of spending money to solve its problems,</p>
<p>then every problem looks like it can be solved</p>
<p>by more inflation.</p>
<p>And so this is where Keynesian economics comes in.</p>
<p>And of course, the Keynesian economics</p>
<p>is based on the work of Keynes, which came in the 1930s.</p>
<p>And this is the key point,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s portrayed in the textbook</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s just the scientific breakthrough</p>
<p>that somebody in the 1930s, this genius,</p>
<p>came about and realized that,</p>
<p>oh, we don&rsquo;t actually need gold.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need hard money.</p>
<p>We can actually just print all the money.</p>
<p>And in reality, of course, it was just the very thin,</p>
<p>flimsy, idiotic justification</p>
<p>for what governments were already doing for 20 years.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d already gone off the gold standard</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d gone through 20 years</p>
<p>in which they were lying to their population,</p>
<p>telling their population we&rsquo;re still on a gold standard,</p>
<p>but there are problems caused by various random things.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re gonna be going back</p>
<p>on the gold standard.</p>
<p>20 years later, after they went off the gold standard,</p>
<p>they come up with this justification for why,</p>
<p>oh, actually the gold standard was bad.</p>
<p>And this is a really pernicious thing about it is</p>
<p>the problems that were caused by us</p>
<p>going off the gold standard</p>
<p>were caused by the gold standard.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to fix them</p>
<p>by going off the gold standard even more.</p>
<p>Just because government is lying and it&rsquo;s shady</p>
<p>and it does these kinds of things</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean Keynesian economics is wrong.</p>
<p>So just, because I wanted to separate a few things you said.</p>
<p>It could very well be very wrong</p>
<p>and they could indeed be hucksters.</p>
<p>All of these, such colorful language.</p>
<p>I love you deeply for this, this is fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, it&rsquo;s like somebody like Krugman</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t use this kind of language when discussing Austrians.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that when actors like him use it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s presented as if it is legitimate</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s part of the major shows.</p>
<p>So the case they make and the criticism Keynesians make</p>
<p>of Austrian economics and the case they make</p>
<p>for Keynesian economics is it&rsquo;s based on empirical evidence.</p>
<p>So Austrian economists are pie in the sky theorists</p>
<p>about like how human nature works.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just all theory.</p>
<p>And just like you said, Keynesian economics</p>
<p>kind of sell it as a science, data driven science.</p>
<p>And so where&rsquo;s the data, bro?</p>
<p>So one way of saying it is how do you know</p>
<p>if we get rid of inflation?</p>
<p>How do you know if we get rid of central banks?</p>
<p>If we push towards that direction,</p>
<p>we will have a better world, a better functioning economy,</p>
<p>better functioning markets, better functioning society.</p>
<p>This is another inaccurate way in which they present.</p>
<p>The economics, they present as if it&rsquo;s just theory</p>
<p>and that the data doesn&rsquo;t matter, but that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>What the Austrians say is that without guiding theory,</p>
<p>data is mute, data is dumb, data can&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>So theory first, and then you have to have models</p>
<p>to provide context for interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a sign of just how little self awareness they have</p>
<p>that they think that they&rsquo;re just being led by the data</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re being led by Keynes&rsquo;s moronic theories.</p>
<p>And they use the data to justify those theories</p>
<p>and to stick by them.</p>
<p>And in fact, they are the ones whose theories</p>
<p>cannot be refuted because it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>government mandated religion.</p>
<p>So according to Keynes&rsquo;s nonsense,</p>
<p>so the way that they justify the inflationism is this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just using this to give an example</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re talking about in terms of theory,</p>
<p>the way they justify the inflationism</p>
<p>to tie it back to the original point,</p>
<p>they justified it, all right, we need money to spend.</p>
<p>And then the level of spending in the economy</p>
<p>is what determines the state of the economy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve taught macro economics</p>
<p>at university level for a while.</p>
<p>So I know Keynesian nonsense better than most Keynesians</p>
<p>know Austrians, if not all of them, I guarantee you.</p>
<p>And so the way they see it is the level of spending</p>
<p>in the economy is what determines the state of the economy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a level of output and there&rsquo;s a level of spending.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like the factories on the one side</p>
<p>that are churning out goods,</p>
<p>and those goods have a certain quantity and value,</p>
<p>market value, and it&rsquo;s completely nonsensical of course,</p>
<p>because how can the value of the goods produced</p>
<p>be different from the value of the spending?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s put that aside for a second.</p>
<p>So the amount of spending that happens in the economy</p>
<p>determines the state of the economy.</p>
<p>If the value of the production, which they call Y</p>
<p>is higher than the aggregate expenditures,</p>
<p>so this is the production</p>
<p>and then the aggregate expenditure is lower,</p>
<p>then we don&rsquo;t have enough spending to buy all the goods.</p>
<p>And then that causes a recession.</p>
<p>The factories start laying off workers</p>
<p>and then the laid off workers start spending less.</p>
<p>And then that leads to aggregate expenditure</p>
<p>dropping even further.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a vicious cycle</p>
<p>where the economy gets into recession.</p>
<p>And the only way out is for Keynes&rsquo;s bankster buddies</p>
<p>and government buddies to print a lot of money</p>
<p>to give to themselves.</p>
<p>And then that will&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one interpretation.</p>
<p>But to print more money to increase the expenditure</p>
<p>that to match the supply.</p>
<p>To match the level of output.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty good to me, I&rsquo;m sold.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Even though you&rsquo;re saying huckster, so.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I just, you know, the way, I love you very much,</p>
<p>but like just for people who are listening,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I love the way you talk and it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>and keep doing it, but just for context,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know anything that involves human nature</p>
<p>deserves this level of certainty.</p>
<p>I, at least my position is that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the hell we&rsquo;re doing on basically anything.</p>
<p>Perhaps, but I mean.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot, like certainty can get us in trouble</p>
<p>is my worry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about economics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know, you know, financial systems,</p>
<p>monetary systems, but I just seen us get in trouble</p>
<p>with human psychology, certainty,</p>
<p>certainty of ideologies in general.</p>
<p>You mentioned Marxism and so on.</p>
<p>I came from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that are very certain</p>
<p>throughout the history of the 20th century</p>
<p>that communism is the utopia that humanity should strive for.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m nervous around certainty.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but you know, you ask me for my opinion.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Sorry, so it&rsquo;s that little bit of a caveat.</p>
<p>So to go back to the idea, then on the other hand,</p>
<p>you have the level of, if the other situation</p>
<p>is when the level of spending is higher</p>
<p>than the amount of aggregate output.</p>
<p>In that situation, you have too much spending.</p>
<p>So therefore what ends up happening is inflation.</p>
<p>So according to the Keynesian worldview,</p>
<p>this is really important because this is a way</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna get to your point about empirical data</p>
<p>and to show you why they&rsquo;re not correct.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re not correct about what they say</p>
<p>about empirical data.</p>
<p>So then what this means is that there&rsquo;s a level of output</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a level of aggregate expenditure.</p>
<p>The aggregate expenditure can either be higher</p>
<p>or lower than the output or equal to it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s higher, we get inflation.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s lower, we get recessions, okay?</p>
<p>So is there any universe in this model?</p>
<p>Is there any potential universe</p>
<p>in which you can have both inflation and a recession?</p>
<p>According to the Keynesian model, you can&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Because aggregate expenditure cannot be both higher</p>
<p>and lower than output.</p>
<p>So therefore, if you were truly being an empirical person,</p>
<p>if you were looking at evidence and trying to analyze data,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d look at this and say, one example,</p>
<p>you just need one example of high inflation</p>
<p>and high unemployment to refute this entire model, right?</p>
<p>And of course, the world is full of examples</p>
<p>of high inflation and high unemployment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened in the 19, and of course,</p>
<p>they ignored it when it happens in poor countries</p>
<p>because poor countries don&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>But then in the 1970s, that happened in the US</p>
<p>and in the Western economies</p>
<p>and the most advanced industrial economies.</p>
<p>So historically, before then,</p>
<p>you had all these Keynesian central bankers</p>
<p>talking about this model and saying,</p>
<p>well, aggregate expenditure is too low now</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why we have unemployment.</p>
<p>So we need to print more money.</p>
<p>And then they print more money, inflation goes up,</p>
<p>but also unemployment goes up because this model is broken.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how the world works.</p>
<p>The level of aggregate spending in the economy</p>
<p>is not a lever with which you can control</p>
<p>inflation and unemployment.</p>
<p>So what would a scientist do?</p>
<p>What would a non Huckster do in this case?</p>
<p>Admit the theory is wrong</p>
<p>and find another way to reformulate it.</p>
<p>Have the Keynesians done that?</p>
<p>No, still the same garbage in the textbook</p>
<p>that is being taught until today.</p>
<p>So is it possible to have a non Keynesian model</p>
<p>where one that still supports</p>
<p>moderate amount of inflation is good for the economy?</p>
<p>I mean, since the 1970s, since this has happened,</p>
<p>yeah, this is what basically most fiat economists,</p>
<p>as I like to call them,</p>
<p>essentially anybody at a university financed by governments,</p>
<p>which is financed by central banks,</p>
<p>which is financed by fiat.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>The effect of fiat money on our life,</p>
<p>as you write about in your book,</p>
<p>fiat standard, one of them is education.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll disagree there too.</p>
<p>Not smart enough to disagree, but I&rsquo;ll disagree anyway.</p>
<p>So yeah, so a whole bunch of other models came up,</p>
<p>but basically it&rsquo;s such an example of motivated reasoning.</p>
<p>Like anybody who&rsquo;s got a familiarity</p>
<p>with the scientific method</p>
<p>or who&rsquo;s got an engineering background</p>
<p>who comes into economics immediately has a lot of red flags.</p>
<p>And I remember when I used to teach macro economics,</p>
<p>I used to teach introductory macro economics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a course that would be taken by econ majors</p>
<p>as well as engineers.</p>
<p>A lot of engineers would take it as an elective.</p>
<p>And every time I&rsquo;d explain,</p>
<p>and I would just teach the Keynesian basic stuff.</p>
<p>And every time I&rsquo;d explain it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always that smart engineering kid</p>
<p>who just looks at me and says,</p>
<p>sir, this doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>because this and this and that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always like, you get it exactly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re correct.</p>
<p>Because if you have any kind of shred of scientific thinking,</p>
<p>you see that this is all motivated reasoning.</p>
<p>Like the answer is government needs to print money.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a whole bunch of models brought up by people</p>
<p>for why government printing money is good.</p>
<p>And the reason they&rsquo;re coming up to this conclusion</p>
<p>is that you only get funded</p>
<p>if you come up with this conclusion.</p>
<p>If you come up with a conclusion</p>
<p>that we need to shut down the central bank,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get funded by the central bank.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get published in the journals.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get a job at the prestigious universities.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get quoted by a fiat publications</p>
<p>like the New York Times and CNN.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t invite you on as an expert.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a fundamental flaw</p>
<p>with a lot of institutions we have today</p>
<p>and throughout human history.</p>
<p>Let me zoom off for just a second to the big question.</p>
<p>What is economics in general?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal?</p>
<p>You said there&rsquo;s a bunch of models.</p>
<p>Is any economist basically trying to throw a bunch of models</p>
<p>about human behavior on the table</p>
<p>and try to generalize it to the global scale?</p>
<p>So both dance between micro and macro somehow</p>
<p>in order to determine public policy</p>
<p>and explain the past, predict the future,</p>
<p>prescribe policies that can control the future,</p>
<p>those kinds of things.</p>
<p>This is the big basic ridiculous question</p>
<p>of what is economics?</p>
<p>Economics is the study,</p>
<p>the way the Austrians define it is the study</p>
<p>of how humans make choices under the condition of scarcity.</p>
<p>We begin with the starting point of economics</p>
<p>as the fact that scarcity exists.</p>
<p>And why does scarcity exist?</p>
<p>Well, because it&rsquo;s easier to want things</p>
<p>than it is to make them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to want a Ferrari than it is to make one.</p>
<p>And so because we have wants</p>
<p>and we have limited means to meet those wants,</p>
<p>we need to economize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a permanent marker of the human condition.</p>
<p>We are always economizing at all times.</p>
<p>And so how people make those decisions</p>
<p>under the conditions of scarcity</p>
<p>is what economists study.</p>
<p>So to go back to your point on empiricism</p>
<p>in Austrian school,</p>
<p>so it isn&rsquo;t that the Austrians don&rsquo;t believe in data.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it&rsquo;s that theory has to inform data.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you think about it</p>
<p>as the example of the stagflation of the 1970 shows,</p>
<p>if you have stagflation,</p>
<p>that just completely refutes the Keynesian model.</p>
<p>The Austrian way of thinking,</p>
<p>which is think from first principles,</p>
<p>understand how the world actually works,</p>
<p>think about how humans act and understand</p>
<p>that economics is really all about human action.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about aggregates of goods.</p>
<p>This is really the key distinction</p>
<p>in terms of methodology.</p>
<p>For the Keynesians, it&rsquo;s physics envy.</p>
<p>They look at the market economy,</p>
<p>they look at individuals in the market economy,</p>
<p>and they think that they can understand the market economy</p>
<p>by looking at aggregates.</p>
<p>This is really the key point of what I think</p>
<p>makes a certain branch of economics pseudoscientific</p>
<p>is the introduction of aggregates.</p>
<p>When you introduce those aggregates,</p>
<p>how much production takes place,</p>
<p>how many people are unemployed,</p>
<p>the percentage of the inflation rate,</p>
<p>and then you think that you can establish</p>
<p>scientific relationship between those aggregates,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s purely physics envy.</p>
<p>In physics, for instance, or in chemistry,</p>
<p>you put, let&rsquo;s say, a container that contains a gas,</p>
<p>and you have the ideal gas law, PV equals to nRT,</p>
<p>calculate the pressure, calculate the volume,</p>
<p>and then the temperature.</p>
<p>If you have the pressure and the volume,</p>
<p>you can calculate the temperature</p>
<p>because you have the nR constants.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a clear relationship</p>
<p>that has been demonstrated in a laboratory</p>
<p>and that we can do it right now.</p>
<p>We can measure it and we can see it</p>
<p>and it continues to hold.</p>
<p>And all it takes is one scientist</p>
<p>to show that this relationship does not hold,</p>
<p>to do an experiment that shows that this does not hold,</p>
<p>and it stops being a law of chemistry and it&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>Whereas in economics, what they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ve copied the superficial shape of this</p>
<p>without any of the scientific rigor</p>
<p>that was used to build it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no experiments.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t experiment on economies.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the ability to establish laws,</p>
<p>and all the laws that we establish</p>
<p>are just models that get people published</p>
<p>and get them on the media to say,</p>
<p>my model says we need to print more money,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s never subject to actual scientific scrutiny.</p>
<p>If it were, they would all be rejected in 15 minutes</p>
<p>because the world is full of examples that contradict them.</p>
<p>Was it possible to do scientific scrutiny</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s human nature when you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a nearly infinite number of variables</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t control them?</p>
<p>Is it possible, so what&rsquo;s the best thing</p>
<p>you could possibly do?</p>
<p>You do thought experiments.</p>
<p>But the problem with thought experiments,</p>
<p>Freud thinks everybody wants to have sex with their mother.</p>
<p>Is he right? That&rsquo;s the problem with Freud.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Well, obviously I&rsquo;m joking on that front, but the&hellip;</p>
<p>Freud is probably under the canes.</p>
<p>Well, no, I think there&rsquo;s power to the thought experiment.</p>
<p>Just like Einstein, a lot of general relativity,</p>
<p>special relativity, that&rsquo;s a thought experiment.</p>
<p>It originates in a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Now, is it true?</p>
<p>Nice thing about physics,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t eventually have experimental validation.</p>
<p>The downside of economics is you really can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>experimental, definitive experimental scientific rigor</p>
<p>of validation of a theory.</p>
<p>So a thought experiment is just a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Using your intuition, it&rsquo;s the power of reasoning together</p>
<p>about human nature.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why economics cannot make the claims</p>
<p>that physics can make.</p>
<p>So with physics, you can predict that if you get this gas</p>
<p>at this pressure, at this volume,</p>
<p>the temperature will be that much.</p>
<p>And you can make that prediction and test it a million times</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll always get the precisely correct answer.</p>
<p>With economics, we can&rsquo;t make quantitative predictions.</p>
<p>But still, on Twitter, and even today,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very certain about the statements you&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>Do you&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t make quantitatively certain statements.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>In economics, we don&rsquo;t make quantitative predictions.</p>
<p>We cannot do that because we don&rsquo;t have experiments.</p>
<p>But we can understand how the world actually works</p>
<p>with humility.</p>
<p>This is really the key difference</p>
<p>that the Keynesians think they just wanna copy</p>
<p>the methods of physics.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s just gonna give them the certainty</p>
<p>of the results of physics, which is like me saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna put a red blanket on my back</p>
<p>and jump from the fourth floor because I&rsquo;m Superman.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not the red blanket</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna make me Superman.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to it.</p>
<p>So humility manifests itself in economics</p>
<p>as the belief in a free market.</p>
<p>Meaning like, I can&rsquo;t centralize,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do centralized control on this thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to minimize the friction</p>
<p>of the free exchange of goods.</p>
<p>So Austrian economics puts priority in the market.</p>
<p>Yes, and you could arrive at it through two paths.</p>
<p>The more practical path, which most scientific minded</p>
<p>people arrive at.</p>
<p>I came from an engineering background.</p>
<p>So I initially had this idea that what is lacking</p>
<p>in economics is mathematicization.</p>
<p>We need to have better math models.</p>
<p>We need to get all of those tools from engineering,</p>
<p>apply them to economics, and then we&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to plan the world economy and make it work better.</p>
<p>And then you start actually trying to solve problems,</p>
<p>trying to actually calculate them.</p>
<p>And you realize nobody can have that ability</p>
<p>because the difference ultimately comes down to the fact</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t have experiments.</p>
<p>And the reason we can&rsquo;t have experiments is that</p>
<p>you can experiment on particles of a gas.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t experiment on human beings and entire economies.</p>
<p>And because particles of a gas are just dumb matter.</p>
<p>And so you kick matter in a certain way.</p>
<p>You can calculate exactly how much is going to fly.</p>
<p>Human beings are much more complex.</p>
<p>They have a will inside them.</p>
<p>And this is really, this is the humility to understand</p>
<p>that you are a human being and other people</p>
<p>are also human being just like you.</p>
<p>And that every person wakes up every morning</p>
<p>and they have a million things in their mind,</p>
<p>a million things they care about,</p>
<p>a million things they want to do.</p>
<p>And you will never be able to make the decisions</p>
<p>for somebody else, let alone for millions of other people.</p>
<p>So this is one path by which you arrive at the conclusion</p>
<p>that free markets are better because you realize</p>
<p>that all of the people that think</p>
<p>that they can centrally plan markets</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t actually do that.</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s really nothing scientific about them</p>
<p>except essentially the rituals they ape</p>
<p>of the scientific process.</p>
<p>And the other path I think that makes you arrive</p>
<p>at the Austrian perspective or the libertarian perspective</p>
<p>I should say, is simply the notion of individuals</p>
<p>as having their own inalienable right</p>
<p>to decide what they want to do with themselves.</p>
<p>If you, I mean, the only way that you can give yourself</p>
<p>the idea that you get to be planner is ultimately</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;re better than other people.</p>
<p>You think your choice, your judgment overrides mine.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a defensible position.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m in no position to want to force anybody ever.</p>
<p>I will never want to force anybody</p>
<p>to do anything they don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>The Keynesian perspective, the central planning perspective</p>
<p>is unlike physics, which is let&rsquo;s force a bunch</p>
<p>of particles to sit in the lab so that we can study them.</p>
<p>In economics, you&rsquo;re forcing people to do things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop these people from doing this job</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s bad for the economy</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s get them to do that job.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s force them to pay this price.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s tax them this much.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s prevent them from using gold as money</p>
<p>and force them to use our credit as money.</p>
<p>So it has to rely on coercion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no central planning without coercion.</p>
<p>And coercion is a crime, in my opinion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that it is justifiable morally or ethically.</p>
<p>So from a politics, from an ethical perspective,</p>
<p>your view is the, I mean, perhaps the,</p>
<p>broadly speaking, the libertarian view</p>
<p>is coercion is unethical, freedom is essential.</p>
<p>What is, what are the pros and cons</p>
<p>of government intervention in the economy?</p>
<p>So can you steal, can you provide pros?</p>
<p>You just kind of provided arguments against.</p>
<p>Is there any arguments to be made</p>
<p>for government intervention,</p>
<p>for the role of government in society?</p>
<p>Speaking from a political or from an economics perspective,</p>
<p>what is the positive role of government</p>
<p>that you can imagine you can speak to?</p>
<p>I can repeat many other cases,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t find any of them compelling</p>
<p>for the reason that I mentioned,</p>
<p>which is that ultimately they all rely on</p>
<p>putting a gun to somebody&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>and using the threat of force.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for me, it can never be justifiable.</p>
<p>Whatever the ends are,</p>
<p>if the means are violence and the threat of violence,</p>
<p>then the ends aren&rsquo;t justified.</p>
<p>Everything that&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>governments will use as an excuse to justify coercion.</p>
<p>So, you know, what do you like?</p>
<p>You like motherhood and apple pie?</p>
<p>Well, government needs to ensure</p>
<p>that motherhood works well,</p>
<p>and we need the government central planning of birth.</p>
<p>We need regulations on birth, for instance.</p>
<p>We need regulations on how people give birth.</p>
<p>We need to ban people from giving birth</p>
<p>in traditional ways that have been tried</p>
<p>for thousands of years.</p>
<p>We need to force people to do things</p>
<p>in the modern scientific way.</p>
<p>Well, so what about things like that all of us use,</p>
<p>so infrastructure, for example, or education,</p>
<p>or, well, the economy too, right?</p>
<p>Can you make a case for the role</p>
<p>of some large scale centralized systems,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s government or not,</p>
<p>that do this kind of management?</p>
<p>I guess, perhaps you could say</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the economies of scale argument</p>
<p>that some things must exist at a very large scale,</p>
<p>and therefore you would want political accountability</p>
<p>of the people who manage them.</p>
<p>This is kind of the argument</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s given for infrastructure monopolies.</p>
<p>For instance, roads or electricity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we live in a country,</p>
<p>we need one power plant.</p>
<p>The bigger the power plant, the better off we will all be.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a natural monopoly in the power plant business.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna have to have one power plant.</p>
<p>And since it&rsquo;s only one power plant,</p>
<p>then we can&rsquo;t just let anybody own it</p>
<p>because then they&rsquo;re gonna make it too expensive.</p>
<p>So we need to have the government own it</p>
<p>so it can make it too expensive.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t find that case compelling?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>I used to believe in it.</p>
<p>I was pretty much a Keynesian</p>
<p>when I first started my graduate studies at Columbia.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t find that compelling at all</p>
<p>because I think all these examples that they mention</p>
<p>of natural monopolies or economies of scale</p>
<p>that can only fit at a scale of government,</p>
<p>government bans people from opening power plants.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s only one power plant</p>
<p>and they need to be in charge of it.</p>
<p>But in reality, no.</p>
<p>In reality, power plants can exist at all kinds of manners</p>
<p>of scales of operation.</p>
<p>And yes, of course, there are benefits to centralization</p>
<p>in power plants in particular</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s efficiency in generation.</p>
<p>One big power plant is more efficient</p>
<p>than 10 equivalent smaller power plants.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also inefficiencies in centralization</p>
<p>because the more centralized and the bigger the plant is,</p>
<p>the further away a lot of the population is going to be.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna be losing a lot of the electricity</p>
<p>and transmission.</p>
<p>And you believe the free market is best in managing</p>
<p>that dance, that balance of centralization.</p>
<p>Exactly, and if we do end up in a situation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s one power plant for an area,</p>
<p>then if the markets ends up centralizing all of it</p>
<p>into one power plant, I don&rsquo;t see that as a problem.</p>
<p>There are places, there&rsquo;s a small town</p>
<p>with only one barber shop.</p>
<p>Is that a catastrophe?</p>
<p>No, because they don&rsquo;t need two barber shops.</p>
<p>Now, if that barber shop started to take advantage</p>
<p>of people, started to charge higher price,</p>
<p>well, then that&rsquo;s just an opportunity for others</p>
<p>to step in and put them in their place.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same thing with power plants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with everything.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think the key thing is this.</p>
<p>From the central planning perspective,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll present you the problem as it is,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll tell you, well, this is bad.</p>
<p>So the fix, and what we can do is better.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s stop what&rsquo;s bad and do what is better.</p>
<p>Two problems here.</p>
<p>Usually, the reason that the thing is bad</p>
<p>in the first place is because it is a government monopoly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of government intervention.</p>
<p>But the second thing is that this notion</p>
<p>that we could just pass a law and fix what&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>and make it better, it ignores the fundamental</p>
<p>underlying reality, which is that what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re offering only one way for this problem</p>
<p>to be solved and making all other solutions</p>
<p>practically illegal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking taxpayer money, you&rsquo;re putting guns</p>
<p>to people&rsquo;s heads to take their money,</p>
<p>to use it to build, say, this one solution</p>
<p>for a power plant, but you&rsquo;re preventing</p>
<p>the free market process from providing us</p>
<p>with other alternatives.</p>
<p>Well, so you phrased it sort of from that perspective,</p>
<p>but in theory, there is a feedback accountability mechanism</p>
<p>for the solution that you propose and enforce</p>
<p>by, as you&rsquo;re saying, placing a gun to people&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re accountable for that choice,</p>
<p>for the quality of that solution,</p>
<p>by being voted out if the solution is actually bad.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a different selection mechanism.</p>
<p>And I think, I personally believe it is a selection mechanism</p>
<p>that has worked in the past.</p>
<p>It just often does not work nearly as well</p>
<p>as a free market.</p>
<p>And the question is, are there domains</p>
<p>in which the free market gets itself into trouble?</p>
<p>So this theoretical view is that that&rsquo;s the point</p>
<p>of a free market, is it doesn&rsquo;t, if there&rsquo;s trouble,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a signal, and it will respond to that signal,</p>
<p>and it will respond appropriately</p>
<p>to try to maximize happiness.</p>
<p>The question is, is there a local optima</p>
<p>that free markets get stuck in and need governments</p>
<p>to represent the broader scale of the people</p>
<p>to get outside of that?</p>
<p>I think the fundamental problem here is the idea</p>
<p>that there is a feedback mechanism</p>
<p>when there is coercion in one party,</p>
<p>when one party can employ coercion and the other one cannot.</p>
<p>So in other words, I&rsquo;m gonna put a gun to your head,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take your money, and I&rsquo;m gonna use it</p>
<p>to buy more guns for me to put against your head,</p>
<p>but somehow you&rsquo;re gonna put a paper in a box</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to deactivate my guns.</p>
<p>Well, love requires a push and pull,</p>
<p>a little bit of tension, a little spice in a relationship,</p>
<p>I think, a little gun to the head.</p>
<p>Good luck to anybody who&rsquo;s gonna be dating you</p>
<p>if you think putting a gun to people&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>is comparable to a relationship.</p>
<p>All jokes, but yes, I mean, the people don&rsquo;t often think</p>
<p>of it as government and the military as gun to the head,</p>
<p>but that is sort of a libertarian perspective</p>
<p>because ultimately when you, you know,</p>
<p>turtles all the way down and at the bottom there&rsquo;s guns.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>At the bottom if you don&rsquo;t want to pay,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want to, you know,</p>
<p>all right, I don&rsquo;t want to be part of your power plant,</p>
<p>I want to get my own generator, I don&rsquo;t want to do it,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to pay for it, I&rsquo;ll go to jail.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t not pay for it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the asymmetry which the market doesn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>which is why, in my opinion, it&rsquo;s not as if, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being stubborn and stuck on the idea</p>
<p>that I want a market and that the government can&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s presented as if, you know, we&rsquo;re choosing</p>
<p>between two different machines.</p>
<p>You know, should we use an Apple or a PC?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just constantly choosing one of them</p>
<p>and saying that the other one can&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not equivalent, it&rsquo;s not two machines.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re comparing between a machine and a gun to the head.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re comparing between a situation</p>
<p>in which anybody anywhere is free to provide the service</p>
<p>or the good, and anybody anywhere is free to buy it</p>
<p>from them or reject to buy it from them.</p>
<p>So anyone can build a power plant, anyone can succeed at it,</p>
<p>anybody can fail at it, anybody can build it in a way</p>
<p>that I can choose to take part in or not take part in.</p>
<p>I can build my own.</p>
<p>So we have a situation which 10 million people, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>they each can freely choose to provide the good</p>
<p>or to buy the good.</p>
<p>That cannot be considered an alternative on an equal footing</p>
<p>to a situation where one person or one entity</p>
<p>gets to decide for everybody and those people</p>
<p>decide for everybody and those who disagree go to jail.</p>
<p>So the problem is that the alternative to governments</p>
<p>is other large successful entities that have humans in them</p>
<p>and human nature is such that there&rsquo;s corruption,</p>
<p>manipulation and so on.</p>
<p>I think free market depends on the honest communication</p>
<p>of information as widely as possible</p>
<p>so that people can make great rational decisions</p>
<p>but sort of my fear is, I&rsquo;d like to propose</p>
<p>is that in general there&rsquo;s manipulation</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s government, whether it&rsquo;s companies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to try to do propaganda.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to try to manipulate you, deceive you,</p>
<p>shut down competition by playing games,</p>
<p>human games of different kinds</p>
<p>and sometimes even meaning well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like everybody thinks they&rsquo;re doing good</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually doing evil.</p>
<p>So how do we prevent the worst of human nature coming out</p>
<p>in a free market as well?</p>
<p>By not giving the worst of human nature</p>
<p>a monopoly on violence in the institution of government.</p>
<p>That little inkling of coercion,</p>
<p>that little bit of asymmetry creates a gigantic</p>
<p>like ripple effect of asymmetry in your view.</p>
<p>Yes and it ends up just being the place</p>
<p>where corporations, individuals, free markets,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t coerce without the resort to government.</p>
<p>So you think about all the examples</p>
<p>of corrupt corporations doing bad things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always because they have certain privileges</p>
<p>from governments because as it exists,</p>
<p>Coca Cola, McDonald&rsquo;s, all of these giant corporations,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t do anything to me without government.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t take any of my money</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t force me to buy their stuff</p>
<p>and so it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>
<p>So if Coca Cola is corrupted,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem for Coca Cola customers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem for Coca Cola shareholders,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem for anybody who deals with Coca Cola</p>
<p>but as somebody who doesn&rsquo;t drink their stuff</p>
<p>and isn&rsquo;t a shareholder,</p>
<p>I have absolutely no interest in what happens.</p>
<p>They could all go bust tomorrow and I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy their product and I&rsquo;m not a shareholder.</p>
<p>So in this situation where you choose to voluntarily</p>
<p>associate with people and you only give your money</p>
<p>to people you want to voluntarily give the money to</p>
<p>so you either buy their product</p>
<p>or invest in their production,</p>
<p>in that situation, the only way that a company</p>
<p>can get my money is if they build a product that I value</p>
<p>or if they convince me that they are going to use it</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s profitable and I may be wrong.</p>
<p>I may invest in a company that fails</p>
<p>or I may invest in a company that turns out to be fraudulent</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my fault and it&rsquo;s my fault</p>
<p>that I gave them my money</p>
<p>and then it turned out to be scoundrels</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a totally different problem</p>
<p>when we make it mandatory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s violence, it&rsquo;s a crime to put a gun to my head</p>
<p>and force me to subsidize companies</p>
<p>and force me to come at certain conclusions.</p>
<p>Do you find an interesting distinction,</p>
<p>Mr. Michael Malice, between anarchism and libertarianism?</p>
<p>So this particular use of violence,</p>
<p>this last resort, this policing force</p>
<p>that libertarianism is okay with</p>
<p>and anarchism is not okay with.</p>
<p>So basically nation states that keep you safe</p>
<p>from the worst of war.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think to be more accurate,</p>
<p>the distinction between anarchism and minarchism,</p>
<p>I think libertarianism is kind of a vague term</p>
<p>that can encompass both.</p>
<p>Means a lot of things, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On the Karl Marx to Michael Malice spectrum,</p>
<p>where do you?</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m full anarchist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a full anarchist.</p>
<p>Yeah, full anarchist.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t find any justification</p>
<p>for the use of force and I think recently perhaps,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m getting old, maybe I&rsquo;m getting senile,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m getting wise, who knows?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m beginning to become more sympathetic to monarchy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m an anarchist, monarchy.</p>
<p>Which, what is that?</p>
<p>Kings, royal. Oh, monarchy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think.</p>
<p>Wait, are you joking or not?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not joking.</p>
<p>And I think, I mean, I think morally and intellectually,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an anarchist, but the reality is we find ourselves</p>
<p>in a world in which a lot of people are not.</p>
<p>And the question is, what is the thing</p>
<p>that is going to provide you with more freedom?</p>
<p>And I think, I&rsquo;m recently coming around to the idea</p>
<p>that monarchy might be the best way</p>
<p>to provide people with the largest amount of freedom</p>
<p>because to have a free society, you need a majority,</p>
<p>perhaps, or a plurality of people</p>
<p>to have a very strong understanding of libertarian ideas,</p>
<p>to have a low time preference,</p>
<p>to have a preference for the future.</p>
<p>So you need a majority of the population</p>
<p>to not decide to go and do something insane</p>
<p>in order to continue to have a free society.</p>
<p>You know, when a respiratory illness comes along,</p>
<p>unfortunately, you know, the last couple of years</p>
<p>showed that we, the vast majority of people</p>
<p>are gonna freak out and lose their mind</p>
<p>and support whatever their stupid TV tells them to support.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s always a current thing</p>
<p>and the media is always telling you</p>
<p>that we need this current thing as an excuse</p>
<p>for more and more government power</p>
<p>and more and more government coercion.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of kings and queens</p>
<p>in that case of a monarchy?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of a leader?</p>
<p>I think there might be a case that,</p>
<p>so as I was saying, you need a majority of the population</p>
<p>to get together and decide, nope, whatever is the case,</p>
<p>you know, the answer is voluntary.</p>
<p>No matter how bad the disease is,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t justify forcing people to stay home.</p>
<p>You wanna stay home, stay home.</p>
<p>You wanna wear a mask, take a vaccine,</p>
<p>do whatever you want, but you can&rsquo;t force others to do that.</p>
<p>So you need a majority of the people</p>
<p>to strongly believe in this principle</p>
<p>in order to get it in a democracy.</p>
<p>Whereas in a monarchy,</p>
<p>maybe you just need the king to get it.</p>
<p>And I think the reason kings are more likely to get it</p>
<p>is that kings have a low time preference</p>
<p>where they think about things for many generations.</p>
<p>Whereas in a democratic system,</p>
<p>your president is likely only going to be there</p>
<p>for four years or eight years or 10 years</p>
<p>or five years or whatever it is.</p>
<p>So the only way that, you know,</p>
<p>all humans are self interested.</p>
<p>So the only way that your president in a democracy</p>
<p>can provide for themselves is to maximize</p>
<p>the amount of exploitation that they can do</p>
<p>of the population during their brief stint.</p>
<p>And then when he&rsquo;s out, you get a new one,</p>
<p>and then that one wants to start all over again.</p>
<p>So every four years, you get a new robber.</p>
<p>With monarchy, you sign up for a multi generation</p>
<p>subscription to the same family.</p>
<p>And when they have the security of knowing that,</p>
<p>you know, his great grandson is going to be</p>
<p>taking money from your great grandson,</p>
<p>suddenly his interest in yours align</p>
<p>because they both want your great grandson</p>
<p>to be prosperous and have enough money</p>
<p>for his great grandson to take.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a monarchy with a tiny government.</p>
<p>So anything required to really provide for a free market.</p>
<p>So for maximizing individual freedom</p>
<p>and the freedom of the economy.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if I were a king, which is highly unlikely</p>
<p>to ever happen, but I think, you know,</p>
<p>if you look historically, the dynasties</p>
<p>that have succeeded at lasting for a long time,</p>
<p>the key thing that they managed to do</p>
<p>is to basically be libertarian.</p>
<p>The key to being a good king is to just leave people alone.</p>
<p>Let them do whatever they want.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t rob them too much or rob them as little as possible,</p>
<p>or maybe even don&rsquo;t rob them.</p>
<p>And, you know, as a king, use your power only</p>
<p>to punish people who aggress against others.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use your power to enrich yourself</p>
<p>and enrich your friends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really, like, if you look at smart kings,</p>
<p>this is what they do.</p>
<p>This is what they teach their children.</p>
<p>And the cycle of kingdoms is that, you know,</p>
<p>the first king understands this,</p>
<p>builds the empire and the first couple of generations,</p>
<p>they get this and the society is free, the economy is free.</p>
<p>And because of that, you know, there&rsquo;s peace and prosperity,</p>
<p>but then over time, the next generation of kids</p>
<p>become a lot more high time preference.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t worked hard.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand the meaning of hard work.</p>
<p>So they become more likely to engage</p>
<p>in destructive behavior.</p>
<p>So raise taxes, pass laws that require people to do things,</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re not hurting anybody.</p>
<p>And that ends up basically eventually destroying the kingdom.</p>
<p>Of course, power corrupts.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of create human institutions</p>
<p>that prevent you as a king or any kind of leader</p>
<p>from expand, so going back on the original promises</p>
<p>and the purposes of your position.</p>
<p>And then distracting, using tools of technology</p>
<p>and communication to distract the populace</p>
<p>while you expand the power.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right, you wrote the fiat standard.</p>
<p>I think we danced around it quite a bit,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if we actually defined it.</p>
<p>So what is fiat money?</p>
<p>What is the history of how it came to be?</p>
<p>The fascinating history of the birth</p>
<p>of the fiat monetary system is something</p>
<p>that really only got uncovered in 2017.</p>
<p>This is extremely, extremely interesting.</p>
<p>In 1914, Britain joined World War I.</p>
<p>And if you remember your history books,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s famous that this was called August Bank Holiday.</p>
<p>It was just going to be a few weeks</p>
<p>where the British troops were gonna go</p>
<p>and kick European ass and come back triumphant.</p>
<p>And most European countries believed that.</p>
<p>But then the war kept on dragging on.</p>
<p>And of course, to finance the war,</p>
<p>the government, this is what they used to do</p>
<p>under the gold standard,</p>
<p>governments would issue bonds.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d issue the bonds, people would buy the bonds,</p>
<p>the money would be used to finance the military,</p>
<p>and then the government would pay off the bond</p>
<p>over the next five or 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>So for World War I, the British government,</p>
<p>the British treasury issued bonds for financing the war.</p>
<p>And this only came to light in 2017.</p>
<p>Only a third of the bonds were actually subscribed.</p>
<p>So people, British people,</p>
<p>and this is perhaps the greatest thing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve ever done,</p>
<p>they decided fighting a war in Europe</p>
<p>is just not my ideal way of investing my capital.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stupid thing.</p>
<p>Why should I go and fight?</p>
<p>Because the Austrians and the Germans and the Serbians</p>
<p>are at each other&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather invest in something else.</p>
<p>So they only bought a third of the bond issue.</p>
<p>And then the astonishing thing that happened,</p>
<p>which really set the tone for the next century</p>
<p>of war, murder, Keynesianism, and theft and inflation,</p>
<p>was that the Bank of England went and got</p>
<p>two of the high ranking officials in the Bank of England</p>
<p>to buy the other remaining outstanding two thirds</p>
<p>of the bonds under their own name</p>
<p>with a line of credit from the Bank of England.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t their own money.</p>
<p>But they took money essentially from the Bank of England,</p>
<p>bought two thirds of the bonds that financed the war.</p>
<p>And that was how England was able</p>
<p>to keep going into the war.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s essentially what they did</p>
<p>is what we today know as quantitative easing.</p>
<p>Back then, they just got, they printed money</p>
<p>from the Bank of England, or credit, printed credit,</p>
<p>gave it to those two employees.</p>
<p>They bought the bonds.</p>
<p>The government could fight the war.</p>
<p>Sounds like it&rsquo;s a nice idea.</p>
<p>And Keynes, of course, being a huckster himself,</p>
<p>he himself said this was, he wrote a letter</p>
<p>to the Bank of England that was uncovered recently.</p>
<p>And he said, I congratulate you</p>
<p>on this masterly manipulation.</p>
<p>I quote it in the book.</p>
<p>Masterly manipulation is what he called it.</p>
<p>That they basically managed to buy the bonds</p>
<p>using the money of the government.</p>
<p>And of course, he never had an idea of how economics works</p>
<p>because he never could ask the question of,</p>
<p>okay, and then what?</p>
<p>All right, so we just printed money</p>
<p>to buy two thirds of these government bonds.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen next?</p>
<p>What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Not a question Keynesians ask themselves</p>
<p>because their jobs depend on not thinking</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going to go wrong.</p>
<p>So a quick question about war.</p>
<p>And as somebody who&rsquo;s been nonstop reading</p>
<p>and thinking about the wars of the 20th century</p>
<p>and thinking that most of those wars</p>
<p>were unjust, unethical, and destructive,</p>
<p>how else do you find, how would you finance a war?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Ideally you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, but I mean, of course there are,</p>
<p>sometimes you wanna fight for self defense.</p>
<p>Yeah, you finance it, taxation, or bonds.</p>
<p>See, the people really need to want a war</p>
<p>not just with their voices, their thoughts,</p>
<p>their tweets, or their actual financial investment.</p>
<p>Put up the bullets and the cost of the bullets</p>
<p>and the bodies.</p>
<p>So their life and their financial well being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it was under the gold standard mostly</p>
<p>because under the gold standard,</p>
<p>the government couldn&rsquo;t print gold.</p>
<p>And so they had a budget and they had a certain amount</p>
<p>of gold and that wasn&rsquo;t just, you know,</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t infinitely increase it.</p>
<p>So they couldn&rsquo;t tax their population at will.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult to take money from people.</p>
<p>You know, you go knock on doors and search everybody&rsquo;s home,</p>
<p>see where they&rsquo;re hiding their gold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very complicated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you gave them paper money,</p>
<p>which is what the case was in 1914,</p>
<p>you could take their wealth just by printing the money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what changed everything when it comes to war.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the 20th century was the century of total war.</p>
<p>Because under the gold standard,</p>
<p>governments fought until they ran out of their own gold.</p>
<p>Under the fiat standard, with paper money,</p>
<p>with credit money, governments fought</p>
<p>until they ran out of liquid wealth</p>
<p>in the hands of all of their citizens.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s find flaws in this thinking if there&rsquo;s any.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a lot of pacifist type of thinking</p>
<p>in World War II as Hitler was expanding and expanding.</p>
<p>Hitler framed himself as a victim of the past, of history.</p>
<p>He never attacked anybody.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s always threatening to attack him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the narrative.</p>
<p>And he keeps expanding.</p>
<p>He keeps sweet talking with his charisma,</p>
<p>all the countries around him,</p>
<p>into sort of embracing pacifism.</p>
<p>Stay out of the war until the war is on your doorstep.</p>
<p>So France, just very suboptimal military strategy</p>
<p>from the perspective of many European nations</p>
<p>in response to Hitler.</p>
<p>They were basically hoodwinked by his words.</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s Churchill, Winston Churchill,</p>
<p>who stepped up and says, perhaps irrationally,</p>
<p>from some kind of economics perspective,</p>
<p>saying we&rsquo;re not going to back down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to fight Germany.</p>
<p>And perhaps that step alone is one of the biggest reasons</p>
<p>that Hitler failed in his expansion.</p>
<p>That decision to fight back,</p>
<p>how, what&rsquo;s the right way to do that?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Winston Churchill,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right way to do that?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, to fight back evil when violence is required.</p>
<p>Evil when violence is required.</p>
<p>Now, you could argue that no war is just,</p>
<p>but there is such a thing as a just war index.</p>
<p>And a lot of people argue if there is a just war</p>
<p>in the 20th century, it&rsquo;s World War II.</p>
<p>So how would you fund, if you were Britain, the war?</p>
<p>Would you require Winston Churchill</p>
<p>to convince the populace?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fight until they&rsquo;re fully convinced</p>
<p>that this is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just make a decision for them.</p>
<p>You have to convince them fully</p>
<p>so that they give their life</p>
<p>and they give their money to support the war.</p>
<p>Is that the right way to do it?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And I think when you have a true threat</p>
<p>and a true evil and a true force</p>
<p>that people really do think is genuine,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to convince them.</p>
<p>I mean, when it&rsquo;s real, people will want to fight</p>
<p>and people will want to pay to fight.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think, though, on this particular example,</p>
<p>I think the best way to fight Hitler</p>
<p>is to have not fought World War I</p>
<p>and not take out the Kaiser of Germany.</p>
<p>If Britain and the US had not gotten involved</p>
<p>in World War I, which really is the senseless war</p>
<p>about nothing, what was in it?</p>
<p>And what was the goal from anybody fighting that war?</p>
<p>If you look at it, after World War I,</p>
<p>there were very minor adjustments</p>
<p>in the borders of the countries that were participating.</p>
<p>So Germany lost some land, Austria lost some land,</p>
<p>but really it wasn&rsquo;t all that massive.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t like Britain wanted to take over Germany</p>
<p>and move their people into Germany and kick the Germans out.</p>
<p>So there was no real value from that war.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the British people</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to take part in it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why if they hadn&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>this enormously criminal manipulation</p>
<p>of printing money to buy the bonds,</p>
<p>Britain wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten into the war.</p>
<p>Germany would still be a kingdom and Hitler wouldn&rsquo;t rise.</p>
<p>And yeah, there&rsquo;d be small changes</p>
<p>in the borders of various European countries.</p>
<p>I struggled to see how it could have been worse.</p>
<p>I mean, I struggled to see who benefited</p>
<p>from four years of carnage in Europe.</p>
<p>And then this came at the height of civilization.</p>
<p>Before that, the people of Europe</p>
<p>had the golden era under the gold standard.</p>
<p>They were trading with one another, they traveled</p>
<p>and technology was advancing.</p>
<p>And they did not expect this war to last this long.</p>
<p>And my favorite story from World War I</p>
<p>is the Christmas truce football game,</p>
<p>which I mentioned in my book.</p>
<p>British and German soldiers at the height of the conflict,</p>
<p>they stopped on Christmas day</p>
<p>and they played a football game against each other.</p>
<p>I mean, this is not a real war,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a war for survival.</p>
<p>Britain didn&rsquo;t want to end Germany.</p>
<p>Germany didn&rsquo;t want to end Britain.</p>
<p>It was just kings who were emboldened</p>
<p>by the fact that they had a printing press</p>
<p>playing with the lives of the people.</p>
<p>Take that away, take away the printing press,</p>
<p>take away their ability to print money.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;d have had a much, much, much better</p>
<p>20th century.</p>
<p>Yeah, the counterfactual history.</p>
<p>Neil Ferguson is a historian</p>
<p>who gets in quite a bit of trouble.</p>
<p>Basically, well, he&rsquo;s a Brit,</p>
<p>suggesting that if Britain stayed out of World War I,</p>
<p>there would be no Hitler, there would be no World War II.</p>
<p>Yep, I agree entirely.</p>
<p>But fiat money.</p>
<p>Yeah, so how fiat money was born.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s get back to that.</p>
<p>So they financed the war with that money.</p>
<p>So what could go wrong?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we left off.</p>
<p>Well, what could go wrong when you&rsquo;ve just printed</p>
<p>an enormous amount of credit and used it to buy bonds?</p>
<p>What goes wrong is that the value of the currency</p>
<p>is going to go down.</p>
<p>Or in other words, prices of things are gonna go up.</p>
<p>So during the war, prices keep going up.</p>
<p>And this is, of course,</p>
<p>this is gonna sound very familiar</p>
<p>to victims of the 20th century.</p>
<p>A government tells you it&rsquo;s because of the war,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not our fault, it&rsquo;s because of the Germans,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of the foreigners, it&rsquo;s because of Putin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of this, it&rsquo;s because of that.</p>
<p>This has always been the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always, war is a very good cover for inflation,</p>
<p>which is caused by monetary phenomena.</p>
<p>So then the war ends.</p>
<p>And inflation, prices have more than doubled</p>
<p>over the past four years,</p>
<p>over the four years of World War I,</p>
<p>prices have more than doubled.</p>
<p>And then the British economy is in bad trouble,</p>
<p>obviously, lost a lot of the labor force for four years</p>
<p>that was out there fighting.</p>
<p>Now those workers come back, you&rsquo;ve got prices are up.</p>
<p>And so people are demanding</p>
<p>that the government control prices</p>
<p>and the government is trying to fix the problem</p>
<p>of inflation by doing price controls,</p>
<p>which is what they always do,</p>
<p>which is catastrophic because it makes things worse.</p>
<p>When you implement price controls,</p>
<p>you are, when you make, you say, all right,</p>
<p>well, bread can&rsquo;t be sold for more than X price.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just preventing bread producers</p>
<p>from producing a lot of bread.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just making the problem worse.</p>
<p>If you let the price rise, the extra price,</p>
<p>first of all, it makes people economize,</p>
<p>so people will only buy what they need.</p>
<p>And it provides the money for the bread producers</p>
<p>to acquire the capital and the resources</p>
<p>they need to produce more bread,</p>
<p>which then brings the price of bread down.</p>
<p>But price controls destroy that.</p>
<p>Then they also implement wage controls.</p>
<p>So you wanna also make sure that people have high wages.</p>
<p>So you raise people&rsquo;s wages artificially,</p>
<p>you lower prices artificially,</p>
<p>and you cause an economic problem.</p>
<p>And this is basically, I use this historical example</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the birth of fiat,</p>
<p>because the Bank of England was the most important</p>
<p>monetary system in the world at that time.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s the prototype</p>
<p>that basically the entire planet copied</p>
<p>over the last 100 years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had this same thing happen.</p>
<p>The government prints money because of a stupid reason,</p>
<p>because somebody in power decided</p>
<p>this was worth destroying everybody&rsquo;s livelihood</p>
<p>and savings for.</p>
<p>And then the consequences come in</p>
<p>and then they start covering up with price controls,</p>
<p>wage controls, and then that makes things worse.</p>
<p>And then they, and of course, throughout all of that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re promising that we&rsquo;re going to go,</p>
<p>oh, and also the other thing that they did,</p>
<p>which I mentioned in the chapter is,</p>
<p>they stopped people from using physical gold</p>
<p>and they confiscated the, well, they didn&rsquo;t confiscate it,</p>
<p>but they took the physical gold and they gave people paper.</p>
<p>So I call it the fiat white paper.</p>
<p>You know, in Bitcoin, we have the white paper.</p>
<p>The fiat white paper was that the Bank of England</p>
<p>announced to all of its banks and post offices.</p>
<p>And from now on, you should not make payment in gold</p>
<p>and you should take payment in gold</p>
<p>and you should encourage all your customers</p>
<p>to turn in all of their gold and give them paper instead.</p>
<p>Is there an actual document?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was, this is all new stuff.</p>
<p>Obviously, nobody really likes to talk about this stuff</p>
<p>because, you know, they&rsquo;re fiat economists,</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t wanna talk about the original sin, but.</p>
<p>Well, you should like republish it</p>
<p>as the fiat white paper or something like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating book by a guy called John Osborne.</p>
<p>So in the 1920s, I think his name was Montagu.</p>
<p>He was the chief of the Bank of England.</p>
<p>He commissioned one of his secretaries, John Osborne,</p>
<p>to study what the bank did during World War I.</p>
<p>And it was a study that was kept under wraps,</p>
<p>a confidential, in the Bank of England,</p>
<p>only released in 2017, almost a century later.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>What was special about 2017, by the way, it&rsquo;s a year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just it was a year in which</p>
<p>some of this information was released.</p>
<p>Yeah, a bunch of people got into parts of the basements</p>
<p>of the Bank of England and found this and published it</p>
<p>and now you can download it as a PDF</p>
<p>and find all of the amazing details.</p>
<p>So they confiscated the gold</p>
<p>and they forced people to use the paper</p>
<p>and they promised people that as soon as the war</p>
<p>was gonna be over, this is temporary,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be back to using gold.</p>
<p>And of course, you know, if you told people in Britain,</p>
<p>this is the real scam about fiat.</p>
<p>If you told people in Britain in 1914,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re gonna go off the gold standard</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>I mean, there might&rsquo;ve been lynchings</p>
<p>of government officials because the British pound</p>
<p>at that point, it had been the global currency</p>
<p>of the whole world.</p>
<p>And the fact that they&rsquo;d managed,</p>
<p>the Bank of England had kept the British pound</p>
<p>at a fixed rate next to gold for,</p>
<p>since Newton, you know, the exchange rate,</p>
<p>the value of the British pound was set</p>
<p>by Isaac Newton himself.</p>
<p>He was the warden of the mint</p>
<p>and he made the pound a specific amount of gold.</p>
<p>And since then, up until World War I,</p>
<p>it was 4.25 pounds per ounce of gold.</p>
<p>I think I might be wrong, but I have it in the book.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;d set that price.</p>
<p>And it was a matter of national pride</p>
<p>for people in England, you know.</p>
<p>The sterling is as good as gold</p>
<p>because for two centuries it has been stuck to gold.</p>
<p>There was the exception of the Napoleonic Wars,</p>
<p>but for two centuries, mostly it was stuck to that.</p>
<p>And so they went off that and then they couldn&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>because if they wanted to go back,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have enough gold.</p>
<p>They shipped their gold to the US to finance the war.</p>
<p>And they had printed a whole bunch of money</p>
<p>that was out there.</p>
<p>So this begins the problem for England.</p>
<p>And that begins the end of England</p>
<p>as the world&rsquo;s superpower.</p>
<p>And the way they tried to fight that</p>
<p>was to get more and more countries around the world</p>
<p>to establish central banks and have,</p>
<p>and hold British pounds.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;d hold, you know, basically dumping their bags</p>
<p>like just any other shit coin.</p>
<p>You just, if you get people to buy your shit coin,</p>
<p>you know, that raises the value of your shit coin.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Can you define shit coin?</p>
<p>Shit coin is, in my definition of a shit coin</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s any form of money</p>
<p>where somebody can produce it.</p>
<p>So soft money.</p>
<p>Not necessarily, I guess.</p>
<p>I think the difference, so there&rsquo;s easy money,</p>
<p>but the shit coin is something that someone can produce</p>
<p>at a rate that is, at a cost that is different</p>
<p>from the market cost.</p>
<p>So gold, nobody can make gold except if they dig for it.</p>
<p>And the cost of mining gold is generally in the range</p>
<p>of the price of gold.</p>
<p>Seems true for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So gold is not a shit coin.</p>
<p>Gold is not a shit coin.</p>
<p>The copper is.</p>
<p>Copper, I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call copper a shit coin</p>
<p>as much as it is easy money.</p>
<p>But I think government currencies and other alt coins,</p>
<p>I think are shit coins because somebody could click a button</p>
<p>and make 10 times the supply.</p>
<p>Would it be fair to say that this began</p>
<p>with the will for war in World War I?</p>
<p>So the march towards fiat began</p>
<p>with a global desire for war in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Did war start this or was war a result?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to say really.</p>
<p>I think it goes both ways.</p>
<p>I think you can&rsquo;t have permanent war without fiat.</p>
<p>And I also think there&rsquo;s a case to be made</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t really have fiat without war.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s some kind of weird dynamical system</p>
<p>with a chicken and egg situation</p>
<p>and they build on top of each other</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a few individuals that figured out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way to manipulate this to play this kind of game</p>
<p>and it escalates and nothing gives you the ability</p>
<p>to manipulate money quite like war.</p>
<p>When you have a war, you can declare an emergency.</p>
<p>You can call all the people who oppose you traitors.</p>
<p>You can get people to support you</p>
<p>not because what you&rsquo;re doing is good</p>
<p>but because you play on their sense of tribalism.</p>
<p>In your book, you do cost benefit analysis.</p>
<p>So you do acknowledge or think about</p>
<p>the pros of fiat currency.</p>
<p>Can you do just that, look at the benefit</p>
<p>and look at the cost just broadly at the highest level?</p>
<p>So the way that I write the fiat standard</p>
<p>is that I try and analyze it as an engineering system</p>
<p>in the same way that I wrote the Bitcoin standard.</p>
<p>So with the Bitcoin standard,</p>
<p>I looked at Bitcoin from first principles</p>
<p>and tried to explain how it works</p>
<p>for a reader that doesn&rsquo;t really have much of a background</p>
<p>in computer science, networks or economics.</p>
<p>And I thought I&rsquo;ll do the same with the fiat.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just ignore the official stories</p>
<p>and look at how this thing actually works.</p>
<p>And I think it does have value</p>
<p>in the fact that the reason that they were able</p>
<p>to pull it off is because it was not possible</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t want to be part of it</p>
<p>to use gold independently of governments.</p>
<p>This is really the key thing.</p>
<p>Gold is just very expensive to move around.</p>
<p>And the fact that it is expensive to move around</p>
<p>means that there&rsquo;s inevitably going to emerge institutions</p>
<p>where it is centralized in physical location.</p>
<p>And then these institutions trade liabilities for the gold.</p>
<p>So really the gold standard intrinsically must involve credit</p>
<p>as becoming part of the monetary system.</p>
<p>It has to be the credit and because it gets centralized</p>
<p>it can easily be captured by the government.</p>
<p>So to be fair, the benefits of the fiat system</p>
<p>is that it saves us on the cost of moving gold around,</p>
<p>which is pretty significant.</p>
<p>Like generally, moving a bar of gold across the Atlantic</p>
<p>is gonna cost somewhere between 0.1 to 1%</p>
<p>of the cost of the gold bar.</p>
<p>So you move it 100 times back and forth</p>
<p>between the Atlantic, you need to pay the whole gold bar,</p>
<p>the cost of the whole gold bar to move it 100 times across.</p>
<p>Well, with fiat money, it&rsquo;s essentially government credit.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just sending a message</p>
<p>from one central bank to another</p>
<p>and you can move it halfway around the world.</p>
<p>Is there also something to be said about the cost in time?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saving the sort of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re reducing the friction of the communication as well.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Of the transactions as well.</p>
<p>Exactly, it&rsquo;s faster.</p>
<p>How big is that benefit?</p>
<p>Because wouldn&rsquo;t you argue that that potential</p>
<p>is the thing that enables modern economy,</p>
<p>both the speed and the low cost,</p>
<p>so increasing the scale and the frequency,</p>
<p>the speed of the transactions?</p>
<p>Yeah, arguably it does help in that regard.</p>
<p>However, it isn&rsquo;t as if you couldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>fast transactions built on top of gold.</p>
<p>So you could have gold being used for final settlement</p>
<p>and you could have banks settling with one another</p>
<p>essentially using credit settlement.</p>
<p>Can you define settlement just for people</p>
<p>who are outside of this world?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ll mention that word quite a bit probably.</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>So the way that it works is, let&rsquo;s say right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna pay you $10 over PayPal or credit card.</p>
<p>So it shows up in your PayPal or credit card</p>
<p>within a few seconds that I&rsquo;ve sent you the money</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t also happen in those 10 seconds</p>
<p>that my bank, which could be in another country,</p>
<p>sent the money to your bank into your account.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of infrastructure underneath that.</p>
<p>So what actually happened is that I have an account</p>
<p>with my bank and you have an account with your bank.</p>
<p>And when the message is communicated from my app to yours,</p>
<p>my bank crosses out the money</p>
<p>and your bank credits you with the money.</p>
<p>And then at the end of the day, week or month,</p>
<p>banks in the same city will settle with one another,</p>
<p>banks in the same country will settle with one another</p>
<p>and banks from different countries</p>
<p>will settle with one another.</p>
<p>So they won&rsquo;t move the $10 from my account to yours.</p>
<p>At the end of the day or week or month,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tally all of the money that was sent</p>
<p>from one bank to the other</p>
<p>and then just settle the difference.</p>
<p>So it turns out at the end of the month,</p>
<p>my bank had sent $15 million to your bank</p>
<p>and your bank had sent $14 million to my bank.</p>
<p>So they give them $1 million and that settles it,</p>
<p>that finalizes the transaction.</p>
<p>So final settlement 3D is like the,</p>
<p>you can think about it as the infrastructure of the system.</p>
<p>And then you can think of these things</p>
<p>as being the higher layer levels.</p>
<p>And you had a wonderful discussion about that</p>
<p>with Michael Saylor.</p>
<p>So the final settlement is like the moment</p>
<p>when you paper and ideas connect to physical reality.</p>
<p>Or to some representation of physical reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, and under gold,</p>
<p>everything was tethered to physical reality</p>
<p>because there was a market commodity</p>
<p>at the bottom of all of this</p>
<p>and nobody could print that market commodity.</p>
<p>And so at the end of the month,</p>
<p>if your bank made too many payments,</p>
<p>if you made too many payments, there was a reckoning.</p>
<p>If you were reckless, if you were insolvent,</p>
<p>you went out of business.</p>
<p>So there was no way to fool that.</p>
<p>But then we moved to the fiat century</p>
<p>and everything is credit.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>the final layer is government credit.</p>
<p>And so as long as you&rsquo;re friends with the government,</p>
<p>basically you never go bankrupt.</p>
<p>So all kinds of hucksters managed to find their way</p>
<p>into getting into position where they don&rsquo;t get bankrupt.</p>
<p>So in part two of the fiat standard called Fiat Life,</p>
<p>you describe the effects of fiat money</p>
<p>on a bunch of things like life, food, science, education.</p>
<p>What is the most pernicious effect of fiat money</p>
<p>on our world, on our life?</p>
<p>So taking a step outside of the monetary system,</p>
<p>actually like how that affects our life from this book?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of things</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t be able to go over them</p>
<p>and I highly recommend reading the book.</p>
<p>But if I were to pick one,</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s the impact that it has</p>
<p>on our time preference, on our valuation of the future.</p>
<p>So remember when we started the discussion,</p>
<p>I said that the key function of money</p>
<p>is that it serves as a store of value.</p>
<p>And the harder the money is,</p>
<p>the better it is at providing us</p>
<p>with a way for providing for our future.</p>
<p>And so the harder the money is,</p>
<p>the less we discount the future.</p>
<p>We always discount the future compared to the present.</p>
<p>So if I told you, I&rsquo;m gonna give you something today</p>
<p>versus giving it to you 10 years from now,</p>
<p>the same thing, you would prefer to take it now</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;d get to enjoy it over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>So we always prefer the present to the future.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a discount on the future.</p>
<p>And that discount is called time preference.</p>
<p>The degree to which we prefer the present to the future</p>
<p>is called our time preference.</p>
<p>So the higher our time preference,</p>
<p>the less we care about the future.</p>
<p>And the process of civilization</p>
<p>is the process of lowering our time preference,</p>
<p>where we start caring more for the future,</p>
<p>we start prioritizing the present less and less.</p>
<p>So we start being able to not consume everything</p>
<p>that we have and store it.</p>
<p>And so money is essential for that.</p>
<p>And under the gold standard,</p>
<p>everyone in the world had the ability</p>
<p>to provide for their future</p>
<p>by simply using the same money that they use.</p>
<p>You would work a day and you would get paid in a gold coin</p>
<p>and you could take that gold coin</p>
<p>and keep it safe for 10 years</p>
<p>and know that at the end of those 10 years,</p>
<p>that gold coin would buy you slightly more</p>
<p>than what it bought you the day that you earned it.</p>
<p>So anybody could provide for their future</p>
<p>and anybody could have very high degree of certainty</p>
<p>that whatever they&rsquo;re saving is going to be there</p>
<p>when they want it in the future.</p>
<p>Because the money supply was only increasing</p>
<p>at one and a half percent,</p>
<p>whereas the production of goods and services</p>
<p>was increasing for most cases, for most periods</p>
<p>at a higher rate than that.</p>
<p>So you could buy more apples and oranges</p>
<p>and houses and cars at the end of the 10 years</p>
<p>than you could at the beginning of the 10 years.</p>
<p>So everybody had a way of providing for the future.</p>
<p>And with that, people lower their time preference.</p>
<p>And that is reflected across all aspects of life.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not just the economic thing.</p>
<p>You see it in the savings rate,</p>
<p>the ability to deny yourself gratification today.</p>
<p>I could take the money that I have</p>
<p>and throw a giant party, buy a sports car, buy a yacht.</p>
<p>And yet you decided, I&rsquo;m not going to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep it so that tomorrow</p>
<p>I can throw a bigger party or buy a better yacht</p>
<p>or have a better life or give my children a better life.</p>
<p>So all of human civilization really</p>
<p>is the process of us lowering our time preference</p>
<p>and finding harder monies that allow us</p>
<p>to provide better for the future</p>
<p>is how we really technologically we do that.</p>
<p>I think of the hardness of money</p>
<p>as being the control knob for our time preference.</p>
<p>And you can see this reflected in the 20th century</p>
<p>where we go from the money supply increases</p>
<p>at around one and a half percent under gold</p>
<p>to this current situation where over the last 60 years</p>
<p>I ran the numbers on money supply and fiat,</p>
<p>the global fiat supply has increased</p>
<p>at around 14% per year.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done a 10X in the increase</p>
<p>in the supply of money annually.</p>
<p>And 14% is a weighted average.</p>
<p>So if you take a basic numerical average</p>
<p>for all fiat currencies, you get something like 30%.</p>
<p>The average fiat currency increases by 30%.</p>
<p>But if you value it by the volume of each currency</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not giving equal weight</p>
<p>to the Venezuelan Bolivar increasing at 500% a year</p>
<p>and the dollar increasing at 8% a year,</p>
<p>if you do it by value of the currencies</p>
<p>so that you get the total supply of fiat,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something like 14%.</p>
<p>And weighted is 30% you said?</p>
<p>Yeah, 30%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see the worst ones,</p>
<p>the people that are tracking that average up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But 14% is still an incredibly high, high number.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re saying that,</p>
<p>sorry, that&rsquo;s the average over the century</p>
<p>or the past 100 years?</p>
<p>Over the past 60 years, 1960 to 2020,</p>
<p>we get World Bank data on that,</p>
<p>pretty reliable data on World Bank</p>
<p>and European Union OECD data.</p>
<p>I ran the numbers on that weighted average,</p>
<p>something like 14%.</p>
<p>And what effect that has on time preference?</p>
<p>The effect is now it&rsquo;s much, much, much harder</p>
<p>for everybody to provide for their future.</p>
<p>Everywhere in the world, it&rsquo;s much harder.</p>
<p>So how do I get the equivalent of the old gold coin</p>
<p>that I could just put under my mattress</p>
<p>and expect it to be there 10 years from now?</p>
<p>Well, gold itself isn&rsquo;t cutting it.</p>
<p>Gold can&rsquo;t keep up with inflation.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that gold is not being used</p>
<p>as a money anymore in that you can&rsquo;t send it internationally.</p>
<p>Internationally, you can&rsquo;t use it</p>
<p>to settle trade internationally,</p>
<p>which therefore means demand for it monetarily is limited.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s becoming more and more an industrial metal.</p>
<p>And as a result of the fact that its value</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t keep up with inflation,</p>
<p>it becomes economical to use it in industry.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re seeing gold become like silver</p>
<p>in that it gets used in industry.</p>
<p>So the stockpile declines.</p>
<p>And so the stock to flow ratio declines as well,</p>
<p>and it becomes more and more of an industrial metal.</p>
<p>And it can&rsquo;t protect your wealth over time very well.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>Well, you could invest.</p>
<p>And this is kind of the obvious answer</p>
<p>that Keynesian will give you is,</p>
<p>well, you just put your money in an investment.</p>
<p>But investment is different from saving.</p>
<p>Saving, the whole point of saving</p>
<p>is that the thing is liquid</p>
<p>and that the thing carries little uncertainty.</p>
<p>You just held the gold coin and it just sat there.</p>
<p>It did nothing.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take risk.</p>
<p>You knew that it was gonna be there in 10 years.</p>
<p>Investment means you give the gold coin to somebody</p>
<p>to go and do something with it.</p>
<p>And it could work, it could not work.</p>
<p>If it works, you get a positive return.</p>
<p>You get more gold back.</p>
<p>If it fails, you might not get any of your gold back.</p>
<p>So taking on risk is something very different from saving.</p>
<p>Saving is just a way of buying the future.</p>
<p>Investing is taking on a risk</p>
<p>and you could lose everything with it.</p>
<p>So what ends up happening,</p>
<p>and this is the Keynesian objection I think</p>
<p>is very wrong and bad</p>
<p>because investment is a job in itself.</p>
<p>To figure out what to do with your money</p>
<p>in order to beat inflation is something</p>
<p>that there are professionals out there on Wall Street</p>
<p>that have PhDs in finance, that have enormous computers,</p>
<p>and they have enormous staffs of PhDs and master&rsquo;s degrees</p>
<p>and math nerds that are crunching numbers</p>
<p>and figuring out how to allocate your portfolio</p>
<p>so that you can beat inflation.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>The majority of them don&rsquo;t beat inflation.</p>
<p>The majority of them can&rsquo;t beat inflation.</p>
<p>Not as measured by CPI, which is completely fraudulent,</p>
<p>but if you remember.</p>
<p>14%.</p>
<p>Yeah, that 14% or even the 7%,</p>
<p>like if you look at just the increase in the money supply,</p>
<p>which I think is a much better metric.</p>
<p>And this is what&rsquo;s reflected on the desirable goods.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the price of real estate</p>
<p>in Miami Beach, as Michael Saylor mentioned in your example,</p>
<p>it goes up at around 6, 7% per year on average</p>
<p>over the last century.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, if you wanna live in a nice area,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happening to real estate.</p>
<p>If you wanna go to the good universities,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going up at a rate that&rsquo;s similar</p>
<p>to the increase in the money supply.</p>
<p>And you can beat CPI,</p>
<p>but CPI is designed so you can beat it,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really beat the appreciation</p>
<p>in the things that you actually want to buy,</p>
<p>in the price of good food, the price of good real estate.</p>
<p>So, and most investment professionals fail at doing that.</p>
<p>So what hope does a doctor or an engineer or a scientist</p>
<p>or an athlete have in doing those things?</p>
<p>And investment is hard and saving should be easy.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Saving is essential for us as a civilization.</p>
<p>And what fiat did is it took that away from us.</p>
<p>And then it forced everybody to become an investor</p>
<p>or more accurately a gambler, because you&rsquo;re not just even,</p>
<p>because the money itself is broken,</p>
<p>because the money itself is constantly changing in value,</p>
<p>investing is becoming more of a crapshoot.</p>
<p>I mean, value investing is completely underperforming,</p>
<p>compared to market analysis.</p>
<p>You know, you listen to the Fed,</p>
<p>and what matters to the price of individual companies</p>
<p>is monetary policy much more</p>
<p>than it is their own performance.</p>
<p>So basically you need to be a junkie watching the Fed</p>
<p>and following all of the world&rsquo;s central banks.</p>
<p>And yeah, I need to learn macro economics</p>
<p>and you need to learn what all the central banks are doing.</p>
<p>And you need to understand how commodity markets work.</p>
<p>And you need to understand how equity markets work</p>
<p>and bond markets and real estate markets.</p>
<p>You need to do all of those things</p>
<p>just in order to be able to save and earn</p>
<p>and keep the money that you&rsquo;ve already earned.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the criminal thing about it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve already earned that money being a doctor,</p>
<p>being a dentist, being an athlete, being an engineer.</p>
<p>I built a house for somebody and I got that money.</p>
<p>And all I wanna do is just make sure</p>
<p>that I can have it 10 years from now.</p>
<p>The only way to do so is to become a crappy engineer</p>
<p>because you have to spend half your time</p>
<p>not doing engineering and instead spend half of that time</p>
<p>learning about Japanese central bank monetary policy</p>
<p>and commodity markets and what&rsquo;s gonna happen to copper</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s gonna happen to oil</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening in the wars</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening with foreign policy</p>
<p>and Russia and the US and all of those things.</p>
<p>Under the gold standard,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t care about any of that stuff.</p>
<p>Your gold coin worked regardless of all of those things.</p>
<p>So what this means is the future,</p>
<p>so first of all, we have all of the problems I mentioned,</p>
<p>but also it means that the future becomes</p>
<p>much more uncertain.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re far less likely to provide for yourself</p>
<p>10 years from now,</p>
<p>far less likely to find an easy way</p>
<p>to give yourself value 10 years from now.</p>
<p>And so you become more short termist.</p>
<p>And that is reflected economically</p>
<p>in a lower savings rate and we see savings rates decline,</p>
<p>but it is also reflected in all manners of decision making.</p>
<p>And I think if you really wanna see what it is,</p>
<p>take a look at a society that goes through hyperinflation</p>
<p>and look at what happens there.</p>
<p>How do people change under hyperinflation</p>
<p>and compare that to essentially what we see</p>
<p>in the 20th century all over under not hyperinflation,</p>
<p>but under low inflation,</p>
<p>10, 15% that you see across the board most of the time</p>
<p>is just slow motion hyperinflation.</p>
<p>So what happens in hyperinflation?</p>
<p>Everybody gets their paychecks,</p>
<p>they run straight to the supermarket,</p>
<p>they spend all of their money.</p>
<p>Nobody thinks about savings.</p>
<p>Nobody thinks about the future.</p>
<p>Survival until the end of this month is highly uncertain.</p>
<p>How likely are you to be planning</p>
<p>for what you&rsquo;re going to be doing five years from now?</p>
<p>Very unlikely.</p>
<p>But also it&rsquo;s reflected not just economically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also reflected in all aspects of morality</p>
<p>and all the way in which we deal</p>
<p>with each other as human beings.</p>
<p>When your survival is precarious,</p>
<p>how much are you invested in the notion</p>
<p>of being a good citizen, on caring about your reputation,</p>
<p>on caring about not getting caught in a crime?</p>
<p>All of these things become harder to value.</p>
<p>So people start committing crime,</p>
<p>people start caring less and less about the future.</p>
<p>And we see it reflected in everything.</p>
<p>And I argue, you see it reflected in architecture.</p>
<p>We used to build houses in the 19th century</p>
<p>that last until today.</p>
<p>And then in the 20th century,</p>
<p>we build essentially disposable cardboard boxes</p>
<p>that get scrapped in 20 years.</p>
<p>So what can you say about potential positive effects</p>
<p>of lower time preferences?</p>
<p>So I mean, it&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>Like basically, you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>an average kind of time preference,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some things in life</p>
<p>where low time preference could be a negative thing.</p>
<p>So like if I want to take on risk,</p>
<p>not for investment, for a kind of investment,</p>
<p>but say I want to start a business,</p>
<p>I want to take something crazy,</p>
<p>take a leap into the unknown, be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>What can you say about that kind of leap?</p>
<p>Taking on debt.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the value of that within the current system?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right approach to that</p>
<p>within the current system?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right approach overall</p>
<p>from an economics perspective?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not saving for the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing something wild,</p>
<p>taking the money from your mattress, taking on debt,</p>
<p>and having a dream in your heart</p>
<p>that you somehow just want to do.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not the wisest investment decision,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something, you know, it&rsquo;s being human.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking a leap into the unknown</p>
<p>because something in your heart says to do it.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re more likely to be taking the leap</p>
<p>in the unknown when you have a little bit of gold</p>
<p>in the mattress than when you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think this is the thing.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the late 19th century,</p>
<p>and I discussed this in the Bitcoin standard,</p>
<p>that was arguably the most innovative period</p>
<p>in human history.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s qualitative evidence.</p>
<p>You know, look at the world around you today.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything that we use</p>
<p>was invented in that period.</p>
<p>The car, the airplane, the telegraph, the telephone,</p>
<p>the camera, pretty much modern life as late 19th century.</p>
<p>You know, the period between 1870 and 1914,</p>
<p>because the whole world was practically on a gold standard,</p>
<p>the whole world was using the same money,</p>
<p>and the whole world could save in the same currency.</p>
<p>That meant that a bicycle shop owner,</p>
<p>two bicycle shop owning brothers in North Carolina</p>
<p>could go and try and fly,</p>
<p>even as all the scientific experts in 1903</p>
<p>were confirming that the possibility of flight</p>
<p>has been debunked as unscientific.</p>
<p>You know, Lord Kelvin said,</p>
<p>not in a million years we&rsquo;re going to be flying.</p>
<p>Thomas Edison said it&rsquo;s never gonna happen.</p>
<p>No, I think it was Edison who said a million years,</p>
<p>but Kelvin also said it&rsquo;s never gonna happen.</p>
<p>The New York Times said it&rsquo;s never gonna happen</p>
<p>the same month in which the Wright brothers did it.</p>
<p>And they continued to deny that it was gonna happen</p>
<p>even two years after they did it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, why could they do that?</p>
<p>Because they had savings in gold.</p>
<p>They had the security with something that you know</p>
<p>is gonna be there.</p>
<p>And then you can take a risk with the stuff that is extra.</p>
<p>You know, I have say three years expenditures in gold</p>
<p>under my mattress.</p>
<p>And I know that I could take a risk with everything else</p>
<p>because whatever bad things happen with all of my dreams,</p>
<p>like even, you know, flying, think about how insane that is.</p>
<p>I still can go back to the three years of gold</p>
<p>that I have saved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still okay to take on debt</p>
<p>given the stuff, the gold under the mattress.</p>
<p>Well, this is the thing, under the gold standard,</p>
<p>the way that people finance things</p>
<p>was predominantly with capital, with equity.</p>
<p>So you would, because you had gold savings,</p>
<p>I had gold savings, everybody had gold savings.</p>
<p>When you wanted to start the business,</p>
<p>you could use your own savings or somebody else&rsquo;s savings.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t need to get into debt.</p>
<p>Well, you could get equity from others</p>
<p>and you could also get debt from others.</p>
<p>So there was.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s directly mapped to physical reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s directly mapped to economic reality</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a hard money out there</p>
<p>that, you know, what you&rsquo;re spending money,</p>
<p>you know, you wanna build your airplane factory,</p>
<p>you need to get actual resources.</p>
<p>So you get actual gold, either yours or somebody else&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you borrow it or you give them equity,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s real resources.</p>
<p>Now, what happened with the fiat system?</p>
<p>And this is, you know, the first part of the book</p>
<p>where I look at it from an engineering kind of perspective</p>
<p>is essentially, and I think this is like the breakthrough</p>
<p>inside of the book, what fiat does</p>
<p>is that it replaces gold mining with credit creation.</p>
<p>The way that we make fiat money,</p>
<p>the way that fiat is mined into existence</p>
<p>is through credit creation.</p>
<p>Most people think of fiat money</p>
<p>as being something that happens</p>
<p>when government prints money.</p>
<p>And we still use the term government&rsquo;s printing money,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of fiat is not physical.</p>
<p>And in fact, fiat is not created</p>
<p>when it is printed physically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s created when it is lent.</p>
<p>So when you go to a bank to get a $1 million loan</p>
<p>to buy a house, that bank is not gonna give you</p>
<p>a million dollars from their own money</p>
<p>or from their depositor&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna make a fresh new million dollars.</p>
<p>When you walk out of that bank,</p>
<p>the money supply has increased by $1 million</p>
<p>to finance your home.</p>
<p>So what fiat does is, I mean,</p>
<p>it was basically born out of government credit</p>
<p>and the credit of banks that are backed</p>
<p>by the central bank and the government.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re part of the institutions</p>
<p>that are allowed fiat privilege,</p>
<p>where you can just issue loans backed by the central bank,</p>
<p>backed by the currency,</p>
<p>you are effectively creating new currency,</p>
<p>new money every time you issue the loan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fiat mining is credit creation, I love it.</p>
<p>So can you say something, I mean,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really have credit without a demand for credit.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really have an increase in supply</p>
<p>without a demand for it.</p>
<p>Is there any value you place in the humans wanting it?</p>
<p>Basically, people wanting to do something with that credit,</p>
<p>wanting to take big leaps, big risks,</p>
<p>big entrepreneurial decisions.</p>
<p>So is all credit bad?</p>
<p>No, I think what&rsquo;s bad is anything, in my opinion,</p>
<p>anything that is consensual,</p>
<p>I wanna borrow money from you and we agree the terms,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t object to that.</p>
<p>As long as you and I both agree, I can&rsquo;t object to that.</p>
<p>But in the case of the fiat system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just you and the bank who come to an agreement.</p>
<p>Everybody who uses the currency</p>
<p>is forced to be part of that agreement.</p>
<p>Because if you default,</p>
<p>effectively what&rsquo;s protecting the bank from you</p>
<p>is the fact that the government</p>
<p>can just print a bunch of money and make the bank whole.</p>
<p>So effectively.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So that little agreement between the bank and you</p>
<p>is actually an agreement between the bank, you,</p>
<p>and the entire populace that&rsquo;s using the currency.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re forced to provide the safety net for you and me</p>
<p>to go and make that loan.</p>
<p>And that safety net is the devaluation of the currency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the whole thing actually works.</p>
<p>So this is why I wrote the Bitcoin standard,</p>
<p>explaining Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and basically the takeaway message of the Bitcoin standard</p>
<p>is you need to stack as much Bitcoin as you can,</p>
<p>because this is the best money that has ever been invented.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about that,</p>
<p>why Bitcoin is the hardest money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But with fiat, the conclusion of the fiat standard,</p>
<p>and again, this is not financial advice,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lowly academic,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t listen to me on issues of money,</p>
<p>but I think theoretically and intellectually,</p>
<p>the conclusion of the fiat system</p>
<p>is you need to be short fiat as much as you can.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the smart winning move.</p>
<p>So human wisdom over thousands of years is to save,</p>
<p>try and not borrow as much as you can,</p>
<p>try and accumulate as much savings as you can.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s reversed under fiat.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re saving money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just subsidizing everybody else taking on loans.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re taking on loans,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re benefiting from all the people that are borrowing.</p>
<p>So the winning move under the fiat system,</p>
<p>and this is what rich people do, is you borrow.</p>
<p>Rich people under the fiat monetary system,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t hold assets.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worth a billion dollars today,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a billion dollars in a checking account.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got maybe a hundred thousand, a million,</p>
<p>five million or something like that.</p>
<p>A tiny fraction of your money is held in cash.</p>
<p>The majority is going to be held</p>
<p>in all kinds of other hard assets.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna be borrowing.</p>
<p>The richest people in the world</p>
<p>are the biggest borrowers in the world.</p>
<p>The most powerful entities in the world,</p>
<p>the governments are the biggest borrowers in the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how they are the richest and the most powerful,</p>
<p>because every time you&rsquo;re borrowing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving the bank an excuse to print new money.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re devaluing everybody else&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting a bit of the cut.</p>
<p>If you were going to buy a house with your savings,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re accumulating the savings and they&rsquo;re losing value.</p>
<p>And if I were to go buy the same house with credit,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting the bank to print money for me.</p>
<p>So obviously they can cut me in on that deal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s much cheaper</p>
<p>for everybody to buy with credit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why everybody buys everything on credit.</p>
<p>So when we look at the global monetary system,</p>
<p>the thing you wanna do as a government</p>
<p>is be the sexiest currency out there.</p>
<p>So the main currency, like the dollar currently is,</p>
<p>is the one that has the most power in that kind of context.</p>
<p>So you have, if you were to try to summarize</p>
<p>what is the global monetary system as it is today,</p>
<p>is a bunch of fiat currencies battling for position,</p>
<p>for use outside their nation,</p>
<p>and in so doing trying to gain power</p>
<p>in the geopolitical sense.</p>
<p>Is that, if we just zoom out,</p>
<p>what is the global monetary system?</p>
<p>Like how, what is it currently?</p>
<p>So outside of the United States, the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could say that, but I think it&rsquo;s more realistic</p>
<p>looking at how it has actually evolved</p>
<p>over the past few decades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a dollar system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a system of currencies buying with one another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dollar system, and all other currencies</p>
<p>are just basically, I like to call them dollar</p>
<p>plus country risk.</p>
<p>So each.</p>
<p>It always returns home to the dollar.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is no competition.</p>
<p>There is no second best, as Michael Saylor would say.</p>
<p>And money is like that.</p>
<p>Gold was a winner take all by the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p>The global monetary market is effectively</p>
<p>a winner take all for the dollar.</p>
<p>And if we get it to Bitcoin, you&rsquo;ll know,</p>
<p>I also think digital currencies are also going to be</p>
<p>a winner take all situation.</p>
<p>So money wants to be one.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no such thing as multiple currencies.</p>
<p>Multiple currencies is just a step back to barter.</p>
<p>Money is one.</p>
<p>If you go back to a system of several currencies,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just reinventing barter.</p>
<p>So in the case of the dollar system,</p>
<p>the global dollar system is built around the dollar</p>
<p>because all central banks have dollar reserves</p>
<p>and because all central banks use</p>
<p>the dollar&rsquo;s clearing mechanisms.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re basically playing in the dollar system.</p>
<p>This seems to have changed over the last couple of months</p>
<p>with the sanctions on Russia</p>
<p>and the confiscation of Russian reserves.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what that&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s going to change.</p>
<p>But it is looking like this dollar system</p>
<p>is clearly unsustainable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sustainable for the US.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sustainable for anybody.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, so you do an amazing podcast</p>
<p>called the Bitcoin Standard Podcast.</p>
<p>So episode 108 of that podcast</p>
<p>is about the very thing you just mentioned.</p>
<p>And allow me please to read the description of that</p>
<p>and then ask you a couple questions</p>
<p>about your thoughts in general.</p>
<p>The description reads,</p>
<p>after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,</p>
<p>the US confiscated the Russian central bank&rsquo;s</p>
<p>significant monetary reserves</p>
<p>and banned some Russian banks from the SWIFT network.</p>
<p>Serious questions are being asked</p>
<p>about the survival of the postwar dollar</p>
<p>based world monetary order.</p>
<p>Will Russia, China and other countries</p>
<p>actually build an alternative international settlement system</p>
<p>after years of threatening to do so?</p>
<p>Question mark.</p>
<p>Will global central banks stop accumulating</p>
<p>US treasury bonds and replace them</p>
<p>with gold and commodities?</p>
<p>Will we witness the birth of a new commodity</p>
<p>gold based monetary order?</p>
<p>In this seminar, we use the insights</p>
<p>from the Bitcoin Standard and the Fiat Standard</p>
<p>on temporal and spatial salability</p>
<p>to explain why reports of the death of the dollar</p>
<p>and the emergence of a new gold standard may be exaggerated.</p>
<p>So I would love to get your analysis on this situation.</p>
<p>What are the fundamentals of it?</p>
<p>What is SWIFT?</p>
<p>What are the possible future evolutions</p>
<p>of the global monetary system?</p>
<p>Yeah, so SWIFT is the network</p>
<p>that the US Federal Reserve uses</p>
<p>for moving money around the world.</p>
<p>So basically the US government can sanction you</p>
<p>off of SWIFT as they&rsquo;ve done with Russian banks,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;ve done with Iran,</p>
<p>and as they&rsquo;ve done with Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So effectively, I mean, this is really the catastrophe</p>
<p>of the current monetary system</p>
<p>is that in order to be able to trade</p>
<p>as a member, as a citizen of your country,</p>
<p>you need your monopoly local central bank</p>
<p>to be on good terms with the US government</p>
<p>so that they would let them operate.</p>
<p>And this is really like on top of the aspect</p>
<p>of the hardness of money,</p>
<p>this is the other really powerful thing about Bitcoin,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s just purely a technological thing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re Russian, if you&rsquo;re Iranian,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re American, if you&rsquo;re Chinese, it&rsquo;s a technology.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like a spoon or a knife or a car,</p>
<p>you operate it properly and it works.</p>
<p>And so with Bitcoin, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t care about your passport.</p>
<p>If you have the private key, you click send</p>
<p>and the money goes, well, it doesn&rsquo;t really go,</p>
<p>but effectively it does go anywhere at once</p>
<p>and the money can move</p>
<p>without having to abide by political situations.</p>
<p>And the point here is not to bash US foreign policy</p>
<p>much as that might be deserved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to discuss it</p>
<p>from a kind of technical perspective.</p>
<p>It has to be a political system with fiat</p>
<p>because ultimately it relies on credit.</p>
<p>And then the government is the one that has the guns</p>
<p>and the government is going to decide</p>
<p>who gets to pay their loans anyway.</p>
<p>And the government&rsquo;s going to have to make its own rules</p>
<p>about who gets to play and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so it has to be political as this kind of fiat system.</p>
<p>And when I wrote the Bitcoin standard,</p>
<p>initially I used to be much more of a gold bug.</p>
<p>And in my mind, gold bugs have spent the last 50 years</p>
<p>saying the global monetary system</p>
<p>is going to collapse next week</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to go back to a gold standard.</p>
<p>And writing the fiat standard gave me</p>
<p>a very good appreciation for why this hasn&rsquo;t happened</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s not very likely to happen.</p>
<p>I think the reason is, as I said earlier,</p>
<p>just gold is very expensive to move around</p>
<p>and perhaps more importantly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very expensive to verify.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the problem with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very expensive to verify</p>
<p>that the gold that you&rsquo;re receiving is original gold.</p>
<p>So the only way to do this properly</p>
<p>is to melt the gold bars down and recast them,</p>
<p>which is pretty expensive.</p>
<p>So we have this situation now where Russia,</p>
<p>which is one of the biggest economies in the world</p>
<p>has been kicked off to varying degrees</p>
<p>off the global monetary system</p>
<p>and the US has confiscated their reserves.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have political opinions about the war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m very familiar with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outside of my area of expertise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just analyzing the monetary aspects of it.</p>
<p>It is, on the one hand,</p>
<p>whether you think the war is justified</p>
<p>or the sanctions are justified</p>
<p>is not something I can opine on.</p>
<p>But the implication of this is that effectively</p>
<p>the US might be shooting itself in the foot</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s telling everybody in the world,</p>
<p>your money in our system is not really your money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a token to play in our arcade.</p>
<p>And any point in time, if you misbehave,</p>
<p>we kick you out of the arcade and we take your tokens.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, this is something that China, Russia, Iran</p>
<p>and many countries have made a lot of noise about</p>
<p>over the past decades.</p>
<p>It got real this year,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been decades of China, Iran and Russia</p>
<p>to some extent saying that, you know,</p>
<p>we wanna build an alternative to the US dollar based system.</p>
<p>And yet they haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s very good reasons they haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the reason is, what do you do based on?</p>
<p>How do you build it?</p>
<p>So you can do a credit based system based on,</p>
<p>but then who&rsquo;s gonna be the big boss?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be China?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be Russia?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be Iran?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be India?</p>
<p>None of these countries wants to be, you know,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t wanna jump out of the US based system</p>
<p>to get into somebody else&rsquo;s based system.</p>
<p>So China doesn&rsquo;t wanna use a Russian system.</p>
<p>Russia doesn&rsquo;t wanna use a Chinese system.</p>
<p>And so therefore you can&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>their own central bank&rsquo;s currencies.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think they have enough leverage,</p>
<p>India, China, Russia combined with several other nations</p>
<p>have enough leverage and incentive</p>
<p>to create their own system?</p>
<p>So any one player, yes, but if they collaborate.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then, okay, so what are you based on?</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s going to be the boss?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to be the one who can?</p>
<p>In this case, China, right?</p>
<p>Because China&rsquo;s becoming increasingly</p>
<p>an economic power in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard to deny.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the most likely scenario perhaps</p>
<p>if we were to witness something like this</p>
<p>is going to be a Chinese based system.</p>
<p>So is it possible to have like a split</p>
<p>in what is the driving currency of the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sustainable.</p>
<p>Again, money wants to be won.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of thing that I argue in that seminar.</p>
<p>So we could see this emerge based around the Yuan</p>
<p>and likely, I mean, Russia is obviously going to hurt</p>
<p>economically from what happened</p>
<p>from the confiscation of the reserves and from the sanctions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not going to be in a position.</p>
<p>And of course, because it&rsquo;s outside of the US based system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in the strongest negotiating position</p>
<p>with the Chinese.</p>
<p>So the Chinese might be able to get them</p>
<p>to join their Yuan based system.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s sustainable in the long run</p>
<p>because these governments can issue their laws</p>
<p>and make their designs and then make their monetary systems.</p>
<p>But ultimately, there are billions of Chinese people</p>
<p>and billions of dollar based people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to want to trade with one another.</p>
<p>And the power to want to trade with one another</p>
<p>is too strong.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just split the world economy</p>
<p>into two monetary systems that don&rsquo;t trade with one another.</p>
<p>So then they&rsquo;re going to want to trade with one another.</p>
<p>Or the dark possibility is the inability to trade</p>
<p>as opposed to being a forcing function for trade.</p>
<p>It will become a forcing function for conflict</p>
<p>in cyberspace and potentially hot war.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the scary part of it.</p>
<p>And this is basically how World War II happened</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an old historian who used to say</p>
<p>when I think his name is Otto Mallory</p>
<p>and I quote him in the Bitcoin standard,</p>
<p>if goods don&rsquo;t cross borders, then bombs will.</p>
<p>If people trade with one another,</p>
<p>they have an incentive for each other&rsquo;s wellbeing</p>
<p>and then they have less of an incentive to fight.</p>
<p>And it was the death of global trade in the 1930s</p>
<p>because of the failure of the fiat system</p>
<p>that brought about the rise of the populism</p>
<p>and the rise of all those leaders that hated each other</p>
<p>and helped finance the war and bring it about.</p>
<p>So that is the scary possibility.</p>
<p>And of course, you can&rsquo;t discount that</p>
<p>with all of the escalation that you see,</p>
<p>that is a possibility that it could turn into a real war.</p>
<p>But then even so, I think ultimately,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t fight wars forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to end at some point.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to be back at square one</p>
<p>or well, not square one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be back at the same dilemma</p>
<p>of who&rsquo;s going to have the global monetary system.</p>
<p>And so one alternative is that what the Chinese</p>
<p>and the Russians could do is they could base it</p>
<p>on a commodity.</p>
<p>So a lot of people are now saying,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re going to base it on copper and corn</p>
<p>and agricultural commodities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the analysis of saleability</p>
<p>that we discuss in the Bitcoin standard</p>
<p>and the fiat standard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s workable.</p>
<p>If you end up basing the monetary system on copper,</p>
<p>as we said earlier, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many governments</p>
<p>say that we&rsquo;re going to make a new monetary system</p>
<p>based on copper grains and nickel and iron and so on.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to stockpile those things</p>
<p>in order to make a market in them.</p>
<p>And then if you stockpile those things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just raising their value,</p>
<p>inviting the producers to make more, flood the market.</p>
<p>I hope they don&rsquo;t try this because it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a devastating, devastating impact on the world economy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have central banks bidding up the price</p>
<p>of essential commodities that people need for real uses</p>
<p>in order to back their currencies with them,</p>
<p>and then just incentivizing the producers</p>
<p>to make more and more and more of it,</p>
<p>and then bringing the price back down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be a very expensive mistake</p>
<p>where we raise the price of copper,</p>
<p>destroy a lot of industries dependent on copper,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just copper, but also food,</p>
<p>and then increase the supply beyond what we need.</p>
<p>And the end result is copper miners make out well,</p>
<p>governments go broke,</p>
<p>and we end up with a lot of rust in copper</p>
<p>in government warehouses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think it works to use commodities</p>
<p>that are not monetary commodities.</p>
<p>Then the question is maybe gold.</p>
<p>Can we go back on another gold standard?</p>
<p>And I mean, Russia seems to have done that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to get reliable information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to look into this more,</p>
<p>but they seem to have said that they&rsquo;re fixing</p>
<p>the price of gold in rubles.</p>
<p>So they will buy and sell gold at a fixed ruble rate,</p>
<p>which effectively means you&rsquo;re on a gold standard.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not sure how much, how serious this is,</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;ve managed to stick to it,</p>
<p>but it seems to have stabilized the ruble</p>
<p>and in fact brought it back to its pre war level,</p>
<p>which I found absolutely astonishing,</p>
<p>considering all the sanctions going on.</p>
<p>But in the short run, it&rsquo;s obviously much better</p>
<p>than having your currency pegged to nothing.</p>
<p>But in the long run,</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t think gold is gonna cut it</p>
<p>in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s any chance they go full gangster move</p>
<p>and go into the digital space on the blockchain</p>
<p>and go with Bitcoin?</p>
<p>I think the point of this discussion is that,</p>
<p>we run through all these other options,</p>
<p>a Chinese based system, why it probably won&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>a commodity based system, why it won&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>and a gold based system, why it won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I think they might have to learn this the wrong way.</p>
<p>I mean, the hard way.</p>
<p>But eventually, I don&rsquo;t see them doing it now,</p>
<p>but eventually I think the winning move</p>
<p>is going to be to go on a Bitcoin based monetary system.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if everything always has to be</p>
<p>the hard way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love it not to be, but I mean,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t look like there is any kind of desire</p>
<p>in China or in Russia to switch to a Bitcoin based system.</p>
<p>To take a leap to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, I think we&rsquo;re gonna go through</p>
<p>a few years, maybe many years of learning the lesson</p>
<p>the hard way, of trying to accumulate these commodities</p>
<p>and seeing the limitations that make them unsuitable</p>
<p>as money today.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;m really concerned about</p>
<p>is the tension, the amount,</p>
<p>the increasing amount of hate in the world.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the increasing amount of power centers in the world</p>
<p>between which hate is making a regular appearance.</p>
<p>And because the weapons of war are becoming</p>
<p>more and more powerful as they have been</p>
<p>in the past many decades,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really concerned about nuclear war.</p>
<p>So let us see if Bitcoin can fix this.</p>
<p>Yes, Bitcoin fixes all of this.</p>
<p>The first rule of Bitcoin is if it&rsquo;s a problem,</p>
<p>Bitcoin fixes it.</p>
<p>All right, well I have some personal questions</p>
<p>for Bitcoin then, because I have some,</p>
<p>my life is pretty fucked up, so I&rsquo;ll have to try to see.</p>
<p>A quick pause for bathroom breaking, any?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to the basics.</p>
<p>What is Bitcoin?</p>
<p>We started with what is money, what is Bitcoin?</p>
<p>We talked about hard money, inflation,</p>
<p>fiat, the history of money, the history of war</p>
<p>in the 20th century, and that takes us</p>
<p>into the 21st century.</p>
<p>What is Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a software, and it&rsquo;s a distributed software</p>
<p>to operate peer to peer network between members</p>
<p>who are all equal on the network, they&rsquo;re all peers.</p>
<p>And what this software does is that it allows you</p>
<p>to operate a payment network between those peers,</p>
<p>and that payment network has its own currency.</p>
<p>And that seems like just a simple software game,</p>
<p>but the reason this is such a big deal is,</p>
<p>I believe Bitcoin is the most advanced form</p>
<p>of money ever invented.</p>
<p>And the reason for that comes from two properties</p>
<p>that this network has.</p>
<p>The first one is that the currency</p>
<p>is the hardest money ever invented.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the money whose supply is the most resistant</p>
<p>to inflation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first monetary asset that we&rsquo;ve ever invented</p>
<p>that is guaranteed to be fixed in its supply,</p>
<p>that cannot be increased beyond a certain number.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoins.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a qualitative leap forward</p>
<p>in our technologies of money.</p>
<p>All of our monies leak, essentially,</p>
<p>because people can always make more and more and more of them.</p>
<p>You know, the best money is the one that leaks the least,</p>
<p>which is gold, because it only leaks one and a half percent.</p>
<p>In other words, your share of the gold stock</p>
<p>is diluted by one and a half percent every year.</p>
<p>Ideally, you&rsquo;d like it to be zero.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is currently at around 1.8% headed towards zero.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the first money that we&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>that goes to zero in terms of terminal supply.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll never be more than 21 million Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a huge deal because, you know,</p>
<p>as I said earlier, money is always whatever</p>
<p>is the hardest to make,</p>
<p>and now Bitcoin is the hardest thing to make.</p>
<p>And then the second property,</p>
<p>which is extremely important as well,</p>
<p>is the fact that it operates without the need</p>
<p>to trust in anybody.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have a party that is in charge of it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have a central authority that can,</p>
<p>you know, as I said, it&rsquo;s peer to peer.</p>
<p>So it only has users.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have any admins.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no authority in charge of Bitcoin</p>
<p>that can take your Bitcoin,</p>
<p>that can stop you from using Bitcoin,</p>
<p>that can change the rules of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t make more of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fixed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available for anybody in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the hardest money ever invented.</p>
<p>And it is absolutely, I think, an enormously,</p>
<p>enormously significant invention</p>
<p>because if you read the fiat standard</p>
<p>and the Bitcoin standard as well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see my perspective for why I think</p>
<p>a very large number of problems in the world</p>
<p>are caused by easy money, are caused by inflation,</p>
<p>and caused by government having access to essentially</p>
<p>an infinite recourse to people&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
<p>And I think Bitcoin fixes this</p>
<p>because it allows us to have money</p>
<p>that has the salability of gold across time,</p>
<p>meaning it holds its value across time like gold,</p>
<p>but much better than gold.</p>
<p>But also it is similar to fiat</p>
<p>in that fiat can travel quickly,</p>
<p>but Bitcoin can travel even faster than fiat.</p>
<p>So it combines gold&rsquo;s salability across time</p>
<p>with fiat&rsquo;s salability across space</p>
<p>in one immutable package that nobody can change</p>
<p>and nobody can control.</p>
<p>Can you define the word salability?</p>
<p>Salability is the essential property of money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ability of a good to be sold easily on the market,</p>
<p>specifically to be sold without much loss in its value.</p>
<p>So houses are great for living in,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not very salable.</p>
<p>If you wanna sell a house,</p>
<p>you can just click a button and sell a house</p>
<p>and have a giant market of people buying houses from you.</p>
<p>You need to find somebody</p>
<p>who wants the exact house that you have</p>
<p>with the exact specifications that you have.</p>
<p>And because houses are not identical,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no liquid giant market</p>
<p>for people to just buy and sell identical houses from.</p>
<p>So gold, for instance, has good salability as money</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a liquid good, it&rsquo;s uniform,</p>
<p>and people are always buying it.</p>
<p>Fiat dollars have great salability</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s always buying</p>
<p>and exchanging dollars for other goods.</p>
<p>So if you have $100 bill, you can easily get rid of it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get $100 worth of stuff for it.</p>
<p>If you have $100 worth of stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to get rid of it.</p>
<p>If you have $100 worth of phone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as easy to spend it as a $100 bill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s salability.</p>
<p>What do you mean that Bitcoin,</p>
<p>I understand that Bitcoin has the salability</p>
<p>of gold across time.</p>
<p>Better even, yeah.</p>
<p>Better, yes, like on the order or whatever.</p>
<p>And then it has the salability of fiat across space.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>So if you remember when you asked me</p>
<p>what is the advantage of fiat,</p>
<p>what is the advantage it offers us,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cheaper to move fiat across space</p>
<p>than it is to move gold.</p>
<p>With the current fiat monetary system,</p>
<p>for all of its flaws, you can send money,</p>
<p>I could send money from my bank account in the US</p>
<p>to a bank account in China in a couple of days,</p>
<p>or in Britain, in France, in a day or two,</p>
<p>which is much faster than you could do with gold</p>
<p>and much cheaper than you could do with gold.</p>
<p>But in reality, with fiat,</p>
<p>the reason Bitcoin improves on that</p>
<p>is that with Bitcoin, you&rsquo;re actually selling,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sending final settlement in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>So you send the Bitcoin transaction,</p>
<p>you get six confirmations in an hour,</p>
<p>you get about 12 confirmations in two hours on average.</p>
<p>With 12 confirmations, you&rsquo;re pretty definitely</p>
<p>clearly safe on this.</p>
<p>So within a couple of hours,</p>
<p>you could send a billion dollars across the ocean</p>
<p>and have final settlement on them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that you&rsquo;ve sent a credit obligation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna need weeks and months to settle,</p>
<p>which is the case with fiat.</p>
<p>So it is faster than fiat, effectively.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder than gold and faster than fiat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way of putting it.</p>
<p>One other aspect of Bitcoin I have to ask,</p>
<p>to me on a human level, it&rsquo;s fascinating,</p>
<p>is it was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto,</p>
<p>an anonymous founder, there&rsquo;s no leader.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another aspect of the decentralization</p>
<p>is leaderless.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not a monarchy.</p>
<p>Fortunately.</p>
<p>Or fortunately, yes.</p>
<p>Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, do you think?</p>
<p>And first of all, is it you?</p>
<p>It definitely is not me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who it is.</p>
<p>If it was, would you tell me?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a trick question.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, trick question.</p>
<p>But I mean, everybody who knows me knows</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t read the code.</p>
<p>So you would say that even if you could.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s one person?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s multiple people?</p>
<p>Is it interesting to you?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s fundamental to the coin itself</p>
<p>to not to coin the entirety of the concept</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s founders and animus?</p>
<p>And how much guts do you think it takes</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s one person to just walk away from so much money?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve considered all these questions many times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to formulate a definitive answer</p>
<p>to all of them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who it is.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why he or them or she</p>
<p>are not spending the coins that they most likely have.</p>
<p>I think what really matters in Bitcoin about Satoshi</p>
<p>is the fact that he&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>And this is what&rsquo;s truly astonishing about it.</p>
<p>The most important fact in Bitcoin</p>
<p>is the fact that the creators disappeared</p>
<p>and the thing has continued to operate now</p>
<p>for almost 12 years without him being there</p>
<p>or 11 years I think it&rsquo;s been since he&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>And this is really the most important thing.</p>
<p>And maybe he died or she died</p>
<p>or they got into an accident on a road trip or whatever</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they haven&rsquo;t accessed their coins.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re incapacitated for some reason.</p>
<p>But whatever reason it is,</p>
<p>I really think it&rsquo;s fate or serendipity</p>
<p>that has given us this very vital,</p>
<p>very, very, very vital building ingredient in Bitcoin</p>
<p>which no other digital currency would ever recreate,</p>
<p>which is that because it was the first,</p>
<p>it was the one that was able to establish</p>
<p>the first mover advantage and get all of the people</p>
<p>who are interested in the technology to get into it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an enormous advantage,</p>
<p>but the cherry on top or what made the whole thing</p>
<p>really function well is the fact</p>
<p>that the guy who made it disappeared</p>
<p>and that it continued to operate,</p>
<p>which is just a clear illustration</p>
<p>that this is a network with no admins.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m tempted to think that they&rsquo;re incapacitated</p>
<p>in some way, probably dead or gone</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t believe the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe any human being</p>
<p>would have this level of self control</p>
<p>to not get into, not want to meddle</p>
<p>with their invention so much, even if they,</p>
<p>they might have had the self control</p>
<p>to like mine the first million coins</p>
<p>to get the network going and then throw away the coins</p>
<p>or send them to an address</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have the key to</p>
<p>because they really just wanted the network to take off.</p>
<p>They may have no access to the coins</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they can&rsquo;t move them.</p>
<p>I could see that happening,</p>
<p>but I find it harder to believe</p>
<p>that they would resist the temptation</p>
<p>to mess with the network.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny, I find that the founders of ideas</p>
<p>are often principled and have the integrity</p>
<p>that the eventual users of those ideas don&rsquo;t fully have.</p>
<p>I tend to, you know, we have the kind of cynical view,</p>
<p>power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>And we tend to, in our mind,</p>
<p>generalize that all humans are corruptible.</p>
<p>And perhaps that&rsquo;s true to some degree,</p>
<p>but I think some people are more corruptible than others.</p>
<p>And I find that there is, I mean,</p>
<p>I like to think that Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>and, you know, just like George Washington</p>
<p>chose to walk away and it&rsquo;s a principle.</p>
<p>And the principle is more powerful</p>
<p>than the financial reward or any of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a principle that stands for freedom.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people throughout history,</p>
<p>even recent history,</p>
<p>that are willing to die for these principles</p>
<p>or live a life full of suffering and sacrifice</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re still living a life of principle</p>
<p>and choosing that day after day after day.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s power to that.</p>
<p>Money, what&rsquo;s the worth of money in the end?</p>
<p>In terms of just personal financial gain</p>
<p>versus knowing how much positive impact there is.</p>
<p>So the person that chooses to walk away like that,</p>
<p>I think is the same kind of person</p>
<p>that chooses to live by that principle.</p>
<p>You have people like that, you know,</p>
<p>in Grigori Grisha Perlman in mathematics</p>
<p>who turned down the Fields Medal because he was.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a medal, not $50 billion of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, I.</p>
<p>No, I know, I know, I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s actually an interesting, just a brief comment.</p>
<p>You know, when people talk about Bitcoin</p>
<p>in the cryptocurrency space,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s often mixed up financial interest and ideas.</p>
<p>And I think those are often correlated,</p>
<p>but that good feeling you get when you win</p>
<p>or number go up or you just,</p>
<p>just somebody, you know,</p>
<p>I found 20 bucks on the street the other day.</p>
<p>And just that feeling of just like,</p>
<p>ooh, like more money, that positive feeling,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s correlated, but it is distinct</p>
<p>from the power of the idea to change a world,</p>
<p>to change the world for the better.</p>
<p>For the, to alleviate, it&rsquo;s like Alex Gladstein,</p>
<p>in the case of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>that decreased the amount of suffering in the world</p>
<p>because of the authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>And just because your number goes up</p>
<p>like that gambling feeling of like, yes, yes, this is good.</p>
<p>And I mean, short term number go up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long term number go up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more like investment and so on.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a short term number go up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a good feeling that you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you have to, in your mind, keep those distinct</p>
<p>from the power of the idea to transform the world.</p>
<p>And if you focus on the power of the idea,</p>
<p>maybe a billion or billions of dollars don&rsquo;t matter as much.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s what I would like to believe.</p>
<p>Perhaps, but what matters ultimately</p>
<p>is that the thing works without him.</p>
<p>The thing&rsquo;s worked for 11 years without him.</p>
<p>And I think this is the really important thing.</p>
<p>If they had stuck around for whatever reason</p>
<p>and they had continued to meddle with it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear to me how decentralized</p>
<p>it could have been.</p>
<p>This is the problem with the other currencies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how do you lose control</p>
<p>of the Frankenstein that you&rsquo;ve created?</p>
<p>The only way that this Frankenstein continues to survive</p>
<p>is if the person in charge of it continues to feed it.</p>
<p>And so it continues to be yours.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>with all the other digital currencies.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve heard about any of the other 16,000</p>
<p>digital currencies out there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve only heard about it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a small group of people behind it</p>
<p>that are working on it, that are promoting it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, and I think Michael Saylor&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>with you was a magnificent illustration</p>
<p>of the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins</p>
<p>in that they are securities.</p>
<p>And I think he makes a very compelling, brilliant case</p>
<p>for why this makes them categorically different</p>
<p>from Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, you&rsquo;re buying property.</p>
<p>I think he mentioned he&rsquo;s a huge fan of Dogecoin,</p>
<p>but I might be misremembering.</p>
<p>You are misremembering.</p>
<p>Okay, me too.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m quoting him out of context.</p>
<p>Okay, let me just ask you about some possible criticisms</p>
<p>of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So on centralization, so there&rsquo;s a criticism</p>
<p>on the mining and on the node side,</p>
<p>or the node is not really the criticism,</p>
<p>but Bitcoin mining is not fully decentralized</p>
<p>because a small number of miners control a majority</p>
<p>of the hashing power.</p>
<p>I looked it up, there&rsquo;s 10,000, 15,000,</p>
<p>whatever the number is of computers that are full nodes,</p>
<p>that have the full, that are actively connected</p>
<p>to the network.</p>
<p>So you could argue that&rsquo;s decentralized</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s global, it&rsquo;s all across the world,</p>
<p>but the miners, they&rsquo;re still, it&rsquo;s more centralized.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re thinking of making a case</p>
<p>for Bitcoin being decentralized,</p>
<p>do you worry about the miners being somewhat centralized?</p>
<p>Is the nodes the important thing to think about?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what number of nodes counts as centralized</p>
<p>and not?</p>
<p>The nodes are what matters because the nodes</p>
<p>are what determines Bitcoin&rsquo;s consensus parameters.</p>
<p>I think the best way to think about it is that miners</p>
<p>simply sell a commodity to the nodes</p>
<p>and that commodity is Bitcoin blocks.</p>
<p>So what a miner does is they solve the proof of work problem</p>
<p>so they keep operating their computers</p>
<p>until they can get a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>And then they attach that to a bunch of transactions</p>
<p>and present it to the nodes for the nodes to ratify</p>
<p>and approve it.</p>
<p>So therefore, this is, and this is,</p>
<p>I strongly recommend people learn about the 2017 block size</p>
<p>war to understand why miners don&rsquo;t control Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I discussed this briefly in my Bitcoin standard,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a recent book that discusses this in detail</p>
<p>called The Block Size War by Jonathan Beer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great description of, in 2017,</p>
<p>essentially the miners thought that they can control Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You know, they had, there was one mining company</p>
<p>that produced the majority of the machines</p>
<p>that were on the network and they,</p>
<p>and their allies had control of the machines</p>
<p>that were out there and they controlled the majority</p>
<p>of the hash rate and they thought that they could change</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s supply, not supply, sorry,</p>
<p>they could change Bitcoin&rsquo;s block size,</p>
<p>which is a tiny little detail, technical parameters,</p>
<p>not even all that big of a deal for the economics of it.</p>
<p>But they thought that they could pass this change,</p>
<p>they could force this change on the network.</p>
<p>And the members of the network rejected it</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t able to do it.</p>
<p>So the nodes are what is sovereign.</p>
<p>The nodes are what determine the rules of the game.</p>
<p>The miners are a service provider.</p>
<p>The miners invest capital upfront.</p>
<p>You know, they buy the machines, they buy the electricity,</p>
<p>they buy the storage, they buy the locations,</p>
<p>they pay the rent, and they invest all of that money</p>
<p>based on the idea that if they behave according</p>
<p>to what the nodes want,</p>
<p>the nodes will reward them with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So the miners are in no position</p>
<p>to dictate terms for anyone.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ve put up their capital upfront</p>
<p>and they will only recoup it if they do what the nodes want.</p>
<p>So therefore what really matters</p>
<p>is the decentralization of the nodes.</p>
<p>So we wanna, you wanna have as many nodes as possible.</p>
<p>You should, you wanna have a system</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a large number of nodes.</p>
<p>And this is of course the biggest problem</p>
<p>with other digital currencies is that, you know,</p>
<p>because basically Bitcoin has cornered the market</p>
<p>on a digital currency,</p>
<p>the only way that you can really get traction</p>
<p>is to generate a whole bunch of buzzwords</p>
<p>about, you know, we&rsquo;re doing this and we&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>And so other digital currencies are optimized</p>
<p>for bells and whistles and buzzwords.</p>
<p>And that means adding computational load,</p>
<p>which makes the nodes bigger, harder to operate,</p>
<p>and therefore you have a very small number of nodes.</p>
<p>In fact, very few digital currencies are keen</p>
<p>to publicize how many nodes there are,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have full nodes in the true sense.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t even matter how many nodes they have</p>
<p>because de facto, you know, you can spin up a million nodes</p>
<p>tomorrow on AWS, doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>What matters is de facto do the nodes dictate</p>
<p>the rules of consensus.</p>
<p>And the fact that with most digital currencies</p>
<p>you can have hard forks very frequently</p>
<p>and they can change the supply all the time</p>
<p>means that there&rsquo;s a small group of people</p>
<p>who agree amongst themselves how to move forward.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you threw in a few criticisms of all coins there.</p>
<p>So one is the small group.</p>
<p>That one we could talk about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky one, and we talked about that</p>
<p>with Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>But the other one is small number of nodes</p>
<p>sort of to push back on that.</p>
<p>As computational power increases,</p>
<p>you can argue that that enables more and more</p>
<p>cheap computers to serve as nodes.</p>
<p>So at least it paints a future</p>
<p>where nodes are always increasing</p>
<p>because computational power is always increasing</p>
<p>and getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.</p>
<p>So at least there&rsquo;s a hope for the future</p>
<p>for greater and greater decentralization</p>
<p>on the node front.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, ultimately, again,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter how many nodes you have</p>
<p>if the way that the currency is run</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard fork every few months,</p>
<p>which is the case with most other currencies.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s the only one that&rsquo;s not have a hard fork.</p>
<p>Basically, the unique thing about Bitcoin</p>
<p>in a technical sense is that you could get</p>
<p>the original software that Satoshi himself ran in 2009</p>
<p>to start the network.</p>
<p>And you could run it today</p>
<p>and it would sync with the blockchain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one bug you need to fix,</p>
<p>one mistake that would have only appeared</p>
<p>I think in around 2013 or 14 or something like that,</p>
<p>so that he wasn&rsquo;t aware of back then.</p>
<p>So you just need to fix this one tiny little bug.</p>
<p>And then the consensus parameters are still the same.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to sync to it.</p>
<p>This is not true for most other digital currencies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say probably all of them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve all had many hard forks,</p>
<p>which they think of as upgrades.</p>
<p>And they market this thing as,</p>
<p>well, Bitcoin can&rsquo;t upgrade, but we upgrade all the time.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, you know what else upgrades all the time?</p>
<p>Facebook, Apple, Amazon,</p>
<p>anything that centralizes is very easy to upgrade.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely why, as Michael Saylor says,</p>
<p>these things are somebody&rsquo;s liability.</p>
<p>They are security.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re carrying on somebody&rsquo;s technical</p>
<p>and economic liability.</p>
<p>They can hard fork, they can 10x the supply tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yeah, they can fall victim to the same corrupting forces</p>
<p>that governments fall victim to.</p>
<p>Sure, and for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>yeah, hard fork is a reverse incompatible change</p>
<p>to the underlying function of a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Of course, there is hard forks of Bitcoin as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure all of which you love dearly.</p>
<p>Anyway, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The original Bitcoin, for the most part,</p>
<p>has not undergone any changes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it has undergone changes,</p>
<p>but none in the important parameters of the network.</p>
<p>So another criticism is about energy.</p>
<p>So the proof of work,</p>
<p>consensus mechanism uses a lot of energy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the response to that criticism of Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Yes, because it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>Okay, the airplane uses a lot more energy than a kayak.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re gonna cross the Atlantic next time,</p>
<p>what are you gonna take?</p>
<p>A kayak that is environmentally friendly,</p>
<p>according to this insane definition,</p>
<p>or are you gonna take an airplane</p>
<p>that consumes a lot of energy?</p>
<p>So the cost benefit analysis here,</p>
<p>essentially, you have to consider</p>
<p>both the cost and the benefit.</p>
<p>Exactly, and I think it&rsquo;s an astonishing testament</p>
<p>to just how far backward people&rsquo;s scientific</p>
<p>and technological thinking has devolved</p>
<p>to the point where we think of energy consumption</p>
<p>as a bad thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>And in the Fiat standard,</p>
<p>I discussed the whole hysteria around energy,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s a product of Fiat inflation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a way of trying to covering up</p>
<p>the fact that energy fuels that are reliable</p>
<p>and necessary for the current world</p>
<p>are becoming more and more expensive because of inflation.</p>
<p>And so governments are always looking for excuses</p>
<p>for why you should not be using those things.</p>
<p>And so they promote all kinds of stupid pseudosciences</p>
<p>that tell you about why these things are bad.</p>
<p>But really, you know, all technology is&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, not all, but the vast majority</p>
<p>of technological innovations involve</p>
<p>economizing on human time and judgment</p>
<p>and replacing it with machines,</p>
<p>with reliable machines that spend a lot of energy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what a telephone does.</p>
<p>Instead of having to send somebody across the world</p>
<p>to tell somebody something else or send a letter,</p>
<p>a telephone allows you to do it.</p>
<p>The car is like that.</p>
<p>You could walk, but a car consumes a lot more energy,</p>
<p>but it allows you to travel much faster and safer</p>
<p>and more reliably.</p>
<p>An airplane is like that.</p>
<p>Modern telecommunication, human prosperity</p>
<p>is an increase in the consumption of energy.</p>
<p>And I think it is an absolutely criminal thing.</p>
<p>I mean, genuinely mean the word criminal</p>
<p>to portray energy consumption as a bad thing,</p>
<p>because it is truly depriving people of the chance</p>
<p>to live a life that makes life better, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly criminal to tell poor countries</p>
<p>that they should not consume the same energy sources</p>
<p>that are being used in rich countries</p>
<p>on which our modern infrastructure and modern life relies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what life is.</p>
<p>You know, if you reduce the consumption of energy in the US</p>
<p>to the levels that you have in poor countries today,</p>
<p>the US would become desperately poor.</p>
<p>A lot of people would die.</p>
<p>Cities would collapse.</p>
<p>The quality of life would decrease significantly.</p>
<p>A high quality of life often requires,</p>
<p>given the current technology, a high expenditure of energy.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I should be clear, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a quality of life in the sense of,</p>
<p>many people think of this as,</p>
<p>oh yeah, well, you know,</p>
<p>taking needless flights for vacations.</p>
<p>No, no, these are the cherries on top of the cake,</p>
<p>but the substance of the cake</p>
<p>and the real benefits of energy</p>
<p>is the fact that children, premature babies,</p>
<p>survive in countries that have reliable</p>
<p>24 hour cheap electricity.</p>
<p>If your child is born premature,</p>
<p>that you put in an incubator,</p>
<p>put him in an incubator or her,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re highly likely to survive.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have 24 hour electricity,</p>
<p>that child is not gonna make it.</p>
<p>And you see it, you know,</p>
<p>the level of energy consumption per capita</p>
<p>is highly correlated, not just to income,</p>
<p>but also to health outcomes, to infant mortality,</p>
<p>to all of the things that you care about.</p>
<p>And Bitcoin is just another technology.</p>
<p>It does consume a lot more energy than central banks.</p>
<p>A lot of Bitcoiners like to take a cop out of this</p>
<p>by saying, well, you know, central banks consume money</p>
<p>and ATMs consume a lot of energy.</p>
<p>And I think if you calculate</p>
<p>how much central banks and banks consume,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a rounding error</p>
<p>next to what Bitcoin consumes.</p>
<p>I think Bitcoin is just, maybe not a rounding error,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still, Bitcoin I think is going to consume</p>
<p>a lot more, and that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s humbling is to look,</p>
<p>because even just looking into this</p>
<p>forces me to look at the energy expenditures</p>
<p>for many of the things we take for granted.</p>
<p>Obviously computers and other digital,</p>
<p>our digital lives are just, Bitcoin becomes a rounding error</p>
<p>relative to how much energy is spent</p>
<p>on all the computers in our world.</p>
<p>But also things like home appliances,</p>
<p>microwaves, and hair dryers and stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is, that&rsquo;s being hilarious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, these things</p>
<p>that are just part of our modern life,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re either the same order,</p>
<p>at least the same order of magnitude as Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and they seem like trivial parts of life.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this is the thing,</p>
<p>all of the people that complain</p>
<p>about Bitcoin&rsquo;s energy consumption,</p>
<p>I presume they use washing machines.</p>
<p>Now, why should their desire for clean and dry clothes</p>
<p>get to consume energy?</p>
<p>And I mean, I used to live in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Lebanon had hyperinflation.</p>
<p>I escaped from hyperinflation.</p>
<p>I escaped, it prevented,</p>
<p>my life could have been ruined by hyperinflation.</p>
<p>And the reason that it wasn&rsquo;t ruined</p>
<p>is because I have Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know, am I allowed to swear on your podcast?</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>So, fuck your washing machine.</p>
<p>given a choice between my washing machine</p>
<p>and my Bitcoin, I&rsquo;ll choose Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a technology that has been,</p>
<p>that has already saved my life,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s gonna save the lives</p>
<p>of many, many, many, many more people.</p>
<p>So, but of course, I don&rsquo;t have to choose</p>
<p>between my Bitcoin and my washing machine</p>
<p>because this is, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just constantly consuming more energy</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna continue to consume more energy</p>
<p>in this world, and that&rsquo;s just what progress is.</p>
<p>And a small remark.</p>
<p>So, in principle, I don&rsquo;t think this is a problem,</p>
<p>but the other thing about Bitcoin,</p>
<p>where it is different from washing machines,</p>
<p>Bitcoin is truly unique in this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only thing whose energy consumption</p>
<p>can be produced absolutely anywhere.</p>
<p>Your washing machine needs to be in your house</p>
<p>where you live, and you live in a city</p>
<p>surrounded by 10 million people,</p>
<p>and they all have their washing machines,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all connected to the grid,</p>
<p>and they generally tend to do their laundry</p>
<p>around the same time.</p>
<p>And so you have to put the load of the washing machine</p>
<p>on the grid at the same time.</p>
<p>There needs to be one power plant</p>
<p>and all of the infrastructure needs to work</p>
<p>at the same time, and the electricity</p>
<p>is pretty expensive because it&rsquo;s being done</p>
<p>in a place with high demand.</p>
<p>Bitcoin does not need to buy electricity</p>
<p>from places where it has high demand</p>
<p>because it can buy electricity from anywhere.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s truly mind blowing about it.</p>
<p>You can buy, you know, what you need,</p>
<p>the electricity that you need for mining</p>
<p>can be done anywhere.</p>
<p>So you can mine, you know, you can have a waterfall</p>
<p>in the north of Canada, 300 miles away</p>
<p>from any population center.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s water falling, there&rsquo;s energy.</p>
<p>You can put a hydroelectric dam there,</p>
<p>and then you can use that energy to operate the miners,</p>
<p>and then the miners just need</p>
<p>a satellite internet connection,</p>
<p>and effectively you&rsquo;re selling that energy</p>
<p>that is isolated to the grid.</p>
<p>And because of the way that Bitcoin functions,</p>
<p>because of the difficulty adjustment,</p>
<p>the only profitable miners are the ones</p>
<p>who can get cheap electricity.</p>
<p>Basically if you&rsquo;re mining at grid cost,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re mining at around, the average electricity price</p>
<p>in the world is around 14 cents.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re mining at 14 cents in Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re most likely not gonna make it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running your miners at 14 cents,</p>
<p>because everybody could mine at 14 cents,</p>
<p>and so what happens is if everybody&rsquo;s mining</p>
<p>at 14 cents, 14 cents stops being profitable,</p>
<p>and then only the people mining</p>
<p>at a lower price are profitable.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why Bitcoin mining is not competing</p>
<p>with your washing machine.</p>
<p>This is the absurd thing</p>
<p>about this kind of energy scarcity viewpoint</p>
<p>where, oh no, it&rsquo;s a catastrophe,</p>
<p>Bitcoin is taking all the electricity,</p>
<p>as if the electricity is just one fixed pie</p>
<p>that we all have to share and fight over.</p>
<p>And this is how I keep making fun</p>
<p>of these stupid headlines they put out</p>
<p>where Bitcoin&rsquo;s consuming more electricity</p>
<p>than Portugal.</p>
<p>All right, well, maybe we should shut down Portugal then.</p>
<p>What the hell is Portugal giving us?</p>
<p>Like, obviously it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not competing.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t mean that, I&rsquo;ve gotten so much criticism</p>
<p>for saying Cristiano Ronaldo&rsquo;s not in the top five.</p>
<p>I apologize, I love Portugal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another discussion we should get into at some point.</p>
<p>Because you posted a few soccer things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I realize how passionate people are about this.</p>
<p>Listen, it was a joke, all right?</p>
<p>He deserves to be potentially in the top five.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love Portugal.</p>
<p>And even though I&rsquo;m a Liverpool fan,</p>
<p>I still respect Cristiano Ronaldo a lot.</p>
<p>In fact, I hold a very unpopular opinion</p>
<p>where I think Cristiano Ronaldo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the greatest football player ever.</p>
<p>Number one, over Pel√© and Maradona, Messi,</p>
<p>better than Messi.</p>
<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s been doing it for 20 years at the top.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s ever done that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s won everything everywhere,</p>
<p>everywhere he goes at the top, at the Champions League.</p>
<p>Really strong argument to be made for him.</p>
<p>Messi&rsquo;s never done anything outside of Barcelona,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>So you appreciate performance, long term,</p>
<p>versus the genius of the actual play on the field.</p>
<p>I mean, the genius is,</p>
<p>Ronaldo&rsquo;s the top scorer of all time.</p>
<p>He scores more goals.</p>
<p>So the genius is in the scoring,</p>
<p>not the actual dance of the play, the creativity.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Messi&rsquo;s been absolutely mediocre since he&rsquo;s left Barcelona.</p>
<p>These are strong words.</p>
<p>He scored, what, two goals in PSG season this year?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out of the Champions League.</p>
<p>What about Mohamed Salah?</p>
<p>You posted about him.</p>
<p>Is he climbing up to be someone?</p>
<p>I think he should win the Ballon dOr this year.</p>
<p>He probably should have won it last year as well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been absolutely outstanding,</p>
<p>but I mean, just people are so crazy about Messi.</p>
<p>They keep giving him accolades.</p>
<p>He hasn&rsquo;t deserved, I think,</p>
<p>Messi the last couple of Ballon dOrs that he got.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a great player and everything,</p>
<p>but no, he did not deserve it last year.</p>
<p>We can agree to disagree.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;re a Barca fan or a Messi fan?</p>
<p>I would say, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a Barca fan,</p>
<p>but a Barca fan because of Messi,</p>
<p>and I just, I think it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s certain things.</p>
<p>So when I was growing up in the Soviet Union, Russia,</p>
<p>I remember Maradona, he was the first person I saw</p>
<p>that I was like, oh, wow, this could be,</p>
<p>this is greatness in sport, not just football and sport,</p>
<p>right, and for some reason.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s something about Diego Armando Maradona,</p>
<p>the way they were commentating the genius of his play,</p>
<p>the mix of ego, and again, the performance,</p>
<p>but being able to carry a team on his shoulders,</p>
<p>that, I just fell in love with whatever he represented,</p>
<p>and then by that, Argentina, and then Messi,</p>
<p>I saw when he was 16, 17, when he was just in the early days,</p>
<p>and when you first see a person and you see the genius</p>
<p>and you notice that, and then it turns out</p>
<p>to be actually a great player, for some reason,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re invested, you&rsquo;re emotionally invested,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know, so you kind of just fall in love</p>
<p>and then you get, you pick sides.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing about football.</p>
<p>Part of the fun things about football, soccer,</p>
<p>is like, you pick a guy, you pick a team,</p>
<p>and fuck everyone else, and you just have fun talking shit.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of it, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great, it&rsquo;s great because I think,</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s a very stupid thing to do,</p>
<p>but I think if you don&rsquo;t do it in football,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do it in real life.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s very good, like, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Instead of hating people for their religion</p>
<p>and for their skin color, hate them</p>
<p>because they support Manchester United.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a Liverpool fan, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, hardcore, long term.</p>
<p>But yeah, so to go back to the original point on Portugal.</p>
<p>Energy.</p>
<p>Yeah, energy.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is not competing with Portugal</p>
<p>because Bitcoin is buying energy</p>
<p>from places where we can&rsquo;t buy it,</p>
<p>because all the places where we can buy energy</p>
<p>for our washing machines, we&rsquo;re bidding up the price</p>
<p>enough to make it nonviable for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, you know, you&rsquo;ll see those headlines</p>
<p>about Bitcoin consuming more energy than Portugal.</p>
<p>Well, if you look at Portugal, I mean,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got giant power plants in Portugal,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got millions of people,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got enormous amounts of infrastructure.</p>
<p>Where are all of these infrastructure for Bitcoin mining?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see it in the cities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all isolated, it&rsquo;s all out away from the cities,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s connected to grids that have serious overcapacity.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin is not out there buying the expensive energy,</p>
<p>taking energy away from people who can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out there buying its own energy</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t need to buy the expensive energy</p>
<p>that people really need.</p>
<p>So one other criticism from an investment perspective,</p>
<p>from a gambling perspective that people see</p>
<p>is the volatility of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s been somewhat decreasing over time,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your answer to the sort of criticism</p>
<p>that Bitcoin is too volatile, I wanna stay away,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a safe place for me</p>
<p>to invest either short term or long term?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying there&rsquo;s a volatility</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a high oscillation in the value</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>So I think the safe way to approach that</p>
<p>is in terms of position sizing.</p>
<p>If the volatility bothers you,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re overinvested perhaps.</p>
<p>So maybe you should reduce the size of your position</p>
<p>so that the volatility doesn&rsquo;t bother you.</p>
<p>And this is the short answer that you know,</p>
<p>like stack as much as your conviction</p>
<p>will allow you to tolerate the volatility.</p>
<p>And of course, the reason you should try</p>
<p>and consider tolerating volatility more</p>
<p>is the options are you hold fiat assets,</p>
<p>which only go down stable, relatively stable,</p>
<p>not a lot of volatility day to day,</p>
<p>value of your dollar doesn&rsquo;t change 40% overnight,</p>
<p>20% overnight or something like that.</p>
<p>But it does go down reliably, it&rsquo;s gonna go down 40%.</p>
<p>You can count on it, it might take a year,</p>
<p>two years, five years, 10 years,</p>
<p>compared to the things that you want to buy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna go down by 40%.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not gonna come back</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna go down another 40%</p>
<p>and then another 40% and then another 40%.</p>
<p>So the option really is relatively short term stability</p>
<p>with long term decline,</p>
<p>or short term volatility with long term rise.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s another way in which Bitcoin teaches people</p>
<p>to have a low time preference and think about the long term.</p>
<p>So stack, accumulate and think of it in the long term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a function of the fact that Bitcoin is new.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is currently less than 1%</p>
<p>of the global money market.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s about $100 trillion of money</p>
<p>out there in the world.</p>
<p>$100 trillion roughly of fiat</p>
<p>and about $10 trillion of gold.</p>
<p>And Bitcoin is less than $1 trillion.</p>
<p>So one rich guy decides to get into Bitcoin,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna show up on the Bitcoin chart.</p>
<p>You look at it, Elon Musk decides to buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you see the buy, you see the news,</p>
<p>it happens and you see the pump.</p>
<p>Elon Musk decides that he doesn&rsquo;t like Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you see the drop.</p>
<p>But a few years ago, it used to be</p>
<p>that one random millionaire would cause that pump.</p>
<p>Now you have to be the richest guy in the world to do that.</p>
<p>In a few years, you&rsquo;re gonna have to be</p>
<p>the richest country in the world to be able to do that</p>
<p>to the Bitcoin price, maybe many years,</p>
<p>maybe not a few years.</p>
<p>But as Bitcoin grows, think about it</p>
<p>as a liquid pool of money.</p>
<p>Currently it&rsquo;s a small pool next to a much larger ocean,</p>
<p>which is the entire money market.</p>
<p>And so one person jumps from that to this small pool,</p>
<p>they can make a big splash.</p>
<p>As the pool grows, essentially the salability increases</p>
<p>and the likelihood of one individual purchase</p>
<p>affecting the price so violently decreases.</p>
<p>And so over time, as the size of the market increases,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna see the volatility decline</p>
<p>more and more.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you look at gold historically,</p>
<p>gold has been very, very stable.</p>
<p>It did not achieve its stability</p>
<p>because the central bank was in charge of gold supply</p>
<p>or because there was a gold committee</p>
<p>that decided how much gold gets produced.</p>
<p>It achieved that stability because it became</p>
<p>the most saleable good and so therefore became the good</p>
<p>that contains the most cash balances in the world.</p>
<p>And the end of the 19th century,</p>
<p>everybody held cash balances in gold</p>
<p>and new production was a tiny little addition</p>
<p>to global production, to the supply.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what made gold the most relatively,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say stable</p>
<p>because nothing is stable in economics,</p>
<p>but relatively it holds onto its value</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s much less volatile than digital currency,</p>
<p>than national currencies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because it has the highest stock to flow ratio</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because its supply is a tiny fraction</p>
<p>of the liquid market.</p>
<p>And as the liquid market grows,</p>
<p>as the size of cash balances grows</p>
<p>and trades in Bitcoin cancel each other out,</p>
<p>you get only slight changes in value.</p>
<p>So I think as Bitcoin matures, that&rsquo;s going to decline.</p>
<p>So effectively, I think the end game</p>
<p>is Bitcoin is huge, Bitcoin is worth something like,</p>
<p>I think the total addressable market for Bitcoin</p>
<p>is not just national currencies</p>
<p>and gold&rsquo;s addressable market, but also government bonds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the really big one.</p>
<p>So how do banks compare to gold?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;ll surpass gold, the 10 trillion?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s bonds?</p>
<p>Where does bonds stand?</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s also national currencies,</p>
<p>which are about 100 trillion</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s government bonds,</p>
<p>which are around $120 billion, sorry, trillion dollars.</p>
<p>Trillion.</p>
<p>Trillion, sorry.</p>
<p>Yes, trillion.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re saying billion, we meant trillion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you think bonds can move to Bitcoin?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always held this is the prize, this is the main dish.</p>
<p>Gold is the appetizer, bonds are the main dish</p>
<p>because bonds have replaced gold.</p>
<p>I have an appetizer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, bonds have replaced gold in people&rsquo;s portfolio.</p>
<p>People, you remember when we were saying gold was,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d hold it as a saving,</p>
<p>as the secure part of your portfolio</p>
<p>and then you take risk with the equity.</p>
<p>Currently people do that</p>
<p>by holding a part of their portfolio in bonds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part that they treat as their saving account.</p>
<p>And then the rest they use for not speculation,</p>
<p>for investment in which they take risk.</p>
<p>Yeah, speculation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s stocks and equity and other high risk assets.</p>
<p>I think Bitcoin is not gonna replace equity.</p>
<p>There will always be equity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll always be companies</p>
<p>and people will wanna have equity.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll probably replace a big chunk</p>
<p>of current equity markets</p>
<p>because right now, if you want to save,</p>
<p>it used to be that you hold bonds.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanna save, you go into stock indexes.</p>
<p>So I think Bitcoin likely eats a big chunk</p>
<p>of equity markets because currently it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>people are using it as saving.</p>
<p>And I think it eats all the bonds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my most ambitious statement.</p>
<p>The question is the scale of time that happens across,</p>
<p>but the most important statement you make is about trend.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also, I mean, let&rsquo;s also remember</p>
<p>currently bonds nominally don&rsquo;t beat inflation</p>
<p>and in real terms,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t come close to beating inflation.</p>
<p>So currently with bonds,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking on credit default risk to buy a bond</p>
<p>and also getting less money back in real terms.</p>
<p>Well, Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t offer you returns,</p>
<p>but in real terms, it appreciates much more</p>
<p>and it has, I believe, a lot less risk associated with it</p>
<p>than any company or government.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make things spicy</p>
<p>and ask if Bitcoin fails in the long term future.</p>
<p>As you just said, economics, volatility,</p>
<p>things happen in this world.</p>
<p>The human civilization might end in this century.</p>
<p>I hope it doesn&rsquo;t, but it might.</p>
<p>There could be catastrophic events.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin fails, it goes to zero, loses its number one spot.</p>
<p>What would be the reason?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an alien visiting Earth 100 years from now</p>
<p>and just were to analyze the situation,</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a pretty new thing.</p>
<p>So the possible trajectories of how the world evolves</p>
<p>together with this new monetary technology</p>
<p>is nearly infinite.</p>
<p>So if it fails, one of those trajectories</p>
<p>surely involves Bitcoin failing.</p>
<p>What would be the reason?</p>
<p>I think the most likely reason that it could fail,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is likely in general,</p>
<p>but I think it is the most likely</p>
<p>of all the unlikely things that could destroy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>is governments go back on a gold standard.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So they make, in your view, a better decision</p>
<p>than the current system, just not the best decision.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I thought you would go much darker.</p>
<p>But, so that&rsquo;s, yeah, okay, interesting.</p>
<p>So maybe because of Russia, because of China and so on,</p>
<p>because of the current war,</p>
<p>they might reconsider the power that America holds</p>
<p>because of the monetary,</p>
<p>because it being the primary currency,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll start thinking about going on a gold standard.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it would also require the US and the Europeans</p>
<p>and everybody to want to join in this system</p>
<p>and sing Kumbaya and play nice with each other</p>
<p>around the gold standard.</p>
<p>I think, you know, given that gold already</p>
<p>is about 10 times larger than Bitcoin,</p>
<p>so it has a first mover advantage,</p>
<p>if governments were to go and peg their currencies</p>
<p>to gold again, the price of gold would shoot up 5, 10x,</p>
<p>and it would rise in value a lot more.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily kill Bitcoin.</p>
<p>No, again, I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s likely to happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s, I imagine, less likely,</p>
<p>less unlikely than all the other unlikely scenarios.</p>
<p>Because, you know, even with a nuclear war,</p>
<p>like 90% of the planet is destroyed,</p>
<p>the 10% continue to run Bitcoin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a quote.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a movement,</p>
<p>a community of people referred to as Bitcoin maximalists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen you referred, at least in the past,</p>
<p>as the leader of the Bitcoin maximalists,</p>
<p>probably because of your book,</p>
<p>Bitcoin Standard, consider the Bible in general.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the leaders in this space.</p>
<p>Do you regret any of the toxicity and derision</p>
<p>that often or perhaps sometimes originates</p>
<p>from this community?</p>
<p>Definitely not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the position to regret other people&rsquo;s actions,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s just be clear.</p>
<p>I think the rhetoric of community is,</p>
<p>I reject this rhetoric because I think it&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>for kind of political manipulation and subversion</p>
<p>to try and portray people as part of a community</p>
<p>and hold people responsible for other people&rsquo;s actions,</p>
<p>which I think is ridiculous.</p>
<p>So, you know, some guy on the internet</p>
<p>said something mean to somebody,</p>
<p>and then this is very common,</p>
<p>and I always try and not get involved in these things.</p>
<p>So some guy who identifies as a Bitcoiner</p>
<p>says something to somebody that&rsquo;s very wrong.</p>
<p>Of course it happens.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of people use Bitcoin around the world,</p>
<p>and a lot of these, I&rsquo;d say parasites,</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t have anything productive</p>
<p>to do with their life, you know, outrage merchants,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll come out and say something along the lines of,</p>
<p>you know, the Bitcoin maximalists are toxic,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re holding Bitcoin back, and they need,</p>
<p>and of course it&rsquo;s manipulative.</p>
<p>The point behind it is they want to get to you,</p>
<p>they want to get people who are, you know,</p>
<p>not that nobody with 300 followers</p>
<p>who said something silly,</p>
<p>they want to get the notable people</p>
<p>to basically change their message.</p>
<p>So the idea is, you know, I&rsquo;m supposed to apologize</p>
<p>because somebody with 300 followers</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met in my life who calls themselves a Bitcoiner</p>
<p>said a mean word, and then I need to apologize,</p>
<p>and I also need to cut down on my rhetoric</p>
<p>about other digital currencies, and I need to do that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m only responsible for my own actions,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t recall regretting anything.</p>
<p>Okay, but let me push back</p>
<p>or push further into that direction.</p>
<p>Fine, let&rsquo;s leave community aside.</p>
<p>Labels suck, for sure.</p>
<p>But you have a spicy way about you on Twitter.</p>
<p>Even in this conversation, you know,</p>
<p>you had some good, strong words to say about movement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed life is too short to mince words.</p>
<p>One day I&rsquo;m gonna be dead, and on my deathbed</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna look back and say,</p>
<p>I wish I was a little bit more circumspect</p>
<p>in expressing my opinions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m far more likely to think, you know what,</p>
<p>I wish I said what I really think.</p>
<p>Yes, life is too short to hold back your opinion.</p>
<p>The question is, what is really your opinion?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re many people in one.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a person that loves,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kindness for the human beings,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a person that gets annoyed,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a person that enjoys disagreement,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a person that enjoys collaboration.</p>
<p>And you can emphasize all of those different things,</p>
<p>each of those different things,</p>
<p>weigh it differently in your online interaction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspects of online interaction</p>
<p>that encourages, in different communities,</p>
<p>online interaction is one community</p>
<p>that encourages kind of derision and mockery and so on.</p>
<p>So you can choose if you want to engage</p>
<p>that part of yourself or some other part of yourself.</p>
<p>Economics is another community that enjoys</p>
<p>being like very straightforward</p>
<p>about their disagreements, pretty harsh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to watch because it feels like you arrive</p>
<p>at the truth much faster because you tear each other apart.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a choice, that&rsquo;s a deliberate choice.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to label an entire community of people</p>
<p>by its extremes, I don&rsquo;t think you should do that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s cultural characteristics you start to notice</p>
<p>when you go to France, it&rsquo;s a certain way.</p>
<p>When you go to Britain, London is different than rural.</p>
<p>Britain and New York is different than Iowa.</p>
<p>You start to notice things.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t want to generalize,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of people everywhere,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain way of communication</p>
<p>on crypto, Twitter in general,</p>
<p>but also Bitcoin maximalists</p>
<p>that I even early on received a bunch of heat.</p>
<p>I was like, what the hell?</p>
<p>So listen, there&rsquo;s definitely a difference</p>
<p>when I go to the computer science community,</p>
<p>the machine learning community,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way friendlier than the cryptocurrency community.</p>
<p>I have much more freedom to actually be what I enjoy being,</p>
<p>which is asking simple dumb questions.</p>
<p>Even when I&rsquo;ve already spent years,</p>
<p>sometimes decades with an idea,</p>
<p>I like asking dumb questions anyway.</p>
<p>The crypto folks punish you for this,</p>
<p>for curiosity, for exploration.</p>
<p>I understand the mechanism</p>
<p>because so many other people come into that community</p>
<p>and they might masquerade as curious,</p>
<p>but really they&rsquo;re trying to inject,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to sell some kind of altcoin,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some scheme, there&rsquo;s some scheme to make money.</p>
<p>And so I understand,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s just the dynamics of the community by nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you respond appropriately</p>
<p>to the amount of charlatans in the community.</p>
<p>So if the fraction of charlatans is low,</p>
<p>maybe you can afford to be more loving and kind and so on.</p>
<p>And when the fraction of charlatans is high,</p>
<p>you have to be harsher.</p>
<p>Perhaps, perhaps.</p>
<p>But I think also the stakes are extremely high</p>
<p>in this situation.</p>
<p>And I think if you don&rsquo;t like Bitcoiners,</p>
<p>if you think Bitcoiners are toxic,</p>
<p>wait till you meet fiaters.</p>
<p>The fiat community has financed world wars and genocides</p>
<p>and tyrants and the mass death and destruction.</p>
<p>The fiat community, if you wanna use that term,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that you should,</p>
<p>but I mean, fiat has destroyed the savings</p>
<p>of pretty much anybody who&rsquo;s lived</p>
<p>through the last 20th century.</p>
<p>Pretty much anybody who&rsquo;s lived through the 20th century,</p>
<p>no matter where you lived,</p>
<p>Switzerland, US, Ethiopia, Russia,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gone through fiat problems.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had hyperinflation, you&rsquo;ve had bank confiscation.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a family in the world today</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t had its wealth destroyed over the last century.</p>
<p>They all have a story about the inflation</p>
<p>and the hyperinflation.</p>
<p>And Bitcoin offers us a way out of this.</p>
<p>And shitcoins, altcoins are essentially fiat world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>last gasp attempt to try and salvage fiat,</p>
<p>to try and salvage the idea that some people</p>
<p>will continue to be able to print money</p>
<p>and other people will have to use that money.</p>
<p>You know, this is Twitter, it&rsquo;s a free market,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the internet.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to follow anybody, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>So what I find really objectionable about the people</p>
<p>who are so butthurt always about Bitcoin maximalists</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t have to click follow on people you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>There are 300 million Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>And if you choose to follow the accounts</p>
<p>that say things that annoy you</p>
<p>and then complain about the fact</p>
<p>that they say things that annoy you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but you&rsquo;re an idiot</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know how to use Twitter.</p>
<p>Just follow the accounts that you like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, you don&rsquo;t have to be part of this.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to listen to those people.</p>
<p>You can choose, there are a lot of Bitcoiners</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t act like this.</p>
<p>You can just unfollow the ones that you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Since in the past year, man, time flies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met a lot of them and I enjoy them a lot.</p>
<p>And you build that community of people that you enjoy.</p>
<p>There are less that communicate in the way you enjoy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s becoming me at this point</p>
<p>that I block with love, I think.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because I did not.</p>
<p>I block very prolifically</p>
<p>and I strongly recommend people continue to block.</p>
<p>I think Twitter is, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get to interact</p>
<p>with 300 million accounts anyway.</p>
<p>So you wanna be constantly curating the experience</p>
<p>by getting rid of people you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>and following people that you like.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just how, you know,</p>
<p>after 10 years of using Twitter,</p>
<p>you know, you get, you accumulate the block list,</p>
<p>which is very big, which I&rsquo;m very happy for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna pass on to my children.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, on your deathbed,</p>
<p>the grandchildren will gather around</p>
<p>and your grandfather can finally share the full list.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, again, it&rsquo;s just a Twitter account.</p>
<p>If it bothers you so much, ask yourself why it bothers you</p>
<p>that some people are so,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not referring to you obviously,</p>
<p>but I mean, the people that are constantly aggravated</p>
<p>about this, I don&rsquo;t get bothered by anything on Twitter.</p>
<p>I just block immediately.</p>
<p>And I get to curate the experience that I enjoy.</p>
<p>And I recommend people do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a lot less pathetic than complaining</p>
<p>about strangers saying things you don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>which a lot of, and of course the reason for it is,</p>
<p>you know, I mean, when I say it&rsquo;s stupid,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really stupid.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an ulterior motive there.</p>
<p>And the ulterior motive is,</p>
<p>hey, I have this shit coin that I made</p>
<p>with five other friends of mine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like you to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ride your coattails, Bitcoiners,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like you to please help me promote this shit coin.</p>
<p>Like this is, I get this practically every week,</p>
<p>whether through email or through Twitter,</p>
<p>where, hey, you know, this is our shit coin.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just like Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s better because it does this and this and that.</p>
<p>And, you know, basically how can we get you</p>
<p>to promote this shit coin for us?</p>
<p>And being straightforward and forthright</p>
<p>is a great productivity hack,</p>
<p>because, you know, you just tell those people,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m not interested.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stupid shit coin.</p>
<p>And I wish you quick and swift failure</p>
<p>before you take a lot of people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I genuinely think.</p>
<p>Well, but I&rsquo;ll just be upfront with the fact,</p>
<p>at least for my taste,</p>
<p>just labeling everything as a shit coin worries me.</p>
<p>So this is my own preference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a judgment on you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just my own preference</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll miss good ideas.</p>
<p>I think when you&rsquo;re, me personally,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m too certain about things,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m too tribal about things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll miss actually really strong ideas,</p>
<p>outlier ideas, totally new ideas.</p>
<p>So that worries me.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of the way Bitcoin is,</p>
<p>how much shit is at stake financially</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s less open to good,</p>
<p>and actually by design, that it&rsquo;s not changing,</p>
<p>like with the hard forks and so on,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not a kind of curiosity</p>
<p>about exploration of ideas.</p>
<p>Of course, in some way,</p>
<p>that curiosity can start getting injected</p>
<p>when you start talking about other layers</p>
<p>built on top of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>when you start talking about applications</p>
<p>or different things like lightning network,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the curiosity can emerge.</p>
<p>But still, that&rsquo;s why with cryptocurrency in general,</p>
<p>I just try to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>And just the shit coin as a term</p>
<p>is just a good statement</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna close my mind to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I hear it.</p>
<p>But coming out of your mouth,</p>
<p>because you say a lot of other edgy stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just more you having fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I hear it.</p>
<p>But if I said something like that,</p>
<p>I would feel like I&rsquo;m closing my mind.</p>
<p>I mean, let me give you the counter argument to that.</p>
<p>How much time do you spend emailing back</p>
<p>all of these Nigerian Prince email scams</p>
<p>that you know email you tell you,</p>
<p>send me $5,000 and I&rsquo;ll send you $15 million?</p>
<p>None. None.</p>
<p>Why are you being close minded</p>
<p>to all of these great ideas?</p>
<p>Well, no, but I&rsquo;m also&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, maybe one of them</p>
<p>will actually send you $15 million.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if I know the difference</p>
<p>between the Nigerian Prince</p>
<p>and many other people I do talk to</p>
<p>who are colleagues and so on</p>
<p>that are also emailing me.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also offering me things,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t sound as ridiculously spammy.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, the moment that somebody tells you,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m gonna give you $15 million for nothing,</p>
<p>just if you send me $5,000,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re getting something for nothing.</p>
<p>And essentially, with all of the digital currencies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same pitch.</p>
<p>Say, hey, you know, come use this thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll allow you to do things that&hellip;</p>
<p>All of the things that they pretend that they can do</p>
<p>that can be done with computers</p>
<p>without having digital currencies.</p>
<p>You know, we already have AWS that does cloud computing,</p>
<p>that does everything that shitcoins pretend to do.</p>
<p>The only difference is AWS doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>its own monetary system tacked on top of it</p>
<p>to allow Jeff Bezos to basically print his own money.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s some gray area?</p>
<p>So let me go for the historical record</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see if you&rsquo;ve changed</p>
<p>as a philosopher, economist, human being.</p>
<p>You tweeted three years ago.</p>
<p>Oh, well.</p>
<p>Anyone who believes proof of stake in work</p>
<p>is either one completely clueless</p>
<p>at how and why Bitcoin works at all</p>
<p>or two, a con artist using it as a buzzword</p>
<p>to promote a worthless scam like Ethereum.</p>
<p>Do you still believe that Ethereum is a scam</p>
<p>and in general, proof of stake?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either clueless if you think it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I still stand by that.</p>
<p>I think the&hellip;</p>
<p>Would you classify Ethereum as a shitcoin?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the mother asshole from which the shitcoins spring.</p>
<p>The royal, the king shitcoin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think the key thing is,</p>
<p>the way to think about there&rsquo;s another tweet</p>
<p>from a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>which is essentially proof of work</p>
<p>was like the invention of flight.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve gotten this machine</p>
<p>and we managed to get it to fly off the ground.</p>
<p>And proof of stake is,</p>
<p>hey, we found a great way to make airplanes cheaper</p>
<p>and faster by not making them fly.</p>
<p>By keeping them on the ground.</p>
<p>Like the invention of proof of work,</p>
<p>the reason the entire digital currency space exists</p>
<p>is because Bitcoin operates based on proof of work.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin was based on proof of stake,</p>
<p>it would have died or been shut down from day one.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a hypothesis and a lot of people believe that</p>
<p>and I think they have a lot of strong support.</p>
<p>But basically, proof of work is grounded in physics</p>
<p>in the real world.</p>
<p>The proof of stake is more about&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what we have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a group of people who get to decide the rules.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s essentially a system that is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a security, it&rsquo;s a company.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an innovation in any sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a step backwards to what we already had,</p>
<p>which is you get a bunch of people in charge of the money.</p>
<p>Now, the only reason it survives in this,</p>
<p>the reason I call these things scam</p>
<p>and I have no problem with calling them a scam</p>
<p>is because they fraudulently present themselves</p>
<p>as being decentralized.</p>
<p>They present themselves as just being a different way</p>
<p>of doing decentralization than Bitcoin, when it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;re writing Bitcoin&rsquo;s coattails</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re writing the fact that most people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t quite understand what Bitcoin is and how it works</p>
<p>to portray themselves as a cheaper, better,</p>
<p>more efficient way of doing what Bitcoin does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a less legally accountable way</p>
<p>of doing what central banks do.</p>
<p>Right, so and the basic criticism is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a group of people,</p>
<p>sometimes a very small group of people</p>
<p>that can control the parameters</p>
<p>of the operation of the system.</p>
<p>So over time, you can&rsquo;t trust,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gold under the mattress.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not property.</p>
<p>And I really very strongly recommend your discussion</p>
<p>with Saylor for people who want to elaborate more on this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people in charge,</p>
<p>which means that legally,</p>
<p>they should be doing this under securities law.</p>
<p>But even as an anarchist,</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t want to care about that,</p>
<p>the technical implication of it is,</p>
<p>this is never going to be adopted</p>
<p>as a neutral way of transferring value on the internet</p>
<p>because you need something</p>
<p>that enemies can trade with one another.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have something</p>
<p>that has a small group of people in charge</p>
<p>because A, this small group of people themselves</p>
<p>can be corrupted and B, they can be coerced.</p>
<p>You can put a bunch of people in a room,</p>
<p>put a gun to their head,</p>
<p>and you can change everything</p>
<p>in any of these digital currencies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think you&rsquo;ll find a lot more sympathy</p>
<p>among fiaters to shitcoins.</p>
<p>The Keynesian economist to Ethereum fanboy pipeline</p>
<p>is a very strong one because it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you like the idea</p>
<p>of people being in charge of money</p>
<p>and you think you&rsquo;re going to be the one</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to be in charge of money.</p>
<p>So you see a lot of this phenomenon</p>
<p>and you see the same people that want gold</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t like central banking, they get into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Yeah, so just to actually push back on a couple of things.</p>
<p>So one is theater.</p>
<p>It sounds like I&rsquo;m trying to be a sophisticated Brit</p>
<p>talking about theater,</p>
<p>but for many reasons not making me feel good about that.</p>
<p>So day by day, things change.</p>
<p>You used to be one of those.</p>
<p>So people evolve, people learn.</p>
<p>People that are supporters of Bitcoin</p>
<p>might eventually become supporters of Ethereum</p>
<p>or go back to supporting fiat.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>People evolve for different reasons.</p>
<p>You grow up, you mature, or you become enlightened.</p>
<p>So I think every single person sort of,</p>
<p>as this technology is evolving, as this world is evolving,</p>
<p>as wars break on, as your politics change,</p>
<p>as the monetary system is constantly put under stress,</p>
<p>people will evolve.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to all figure it out together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why like open mindedness here,</p>
<p>I think for people like me at least seems essential.</p>
<p>I know, so I expect you to be answering</p>
<p>all of the spam emails you get.</p>
<p>I will, prince by prince by prince.</p>
<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t have a clear understanding</p>
<p>what is a good investment in my time,</p>
<p>what is a good investment in my money.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t seem clear because things,</p>
<p>things are good at promoting themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the different kinds of things</p>
<p>like Ethereum, altcoins, and so on.</p>
<p>I just mean life, like dating, jobs, friendships.</p>
<p>Like everybody&rsquo;s advertising themselves</p>
<p>as a great investment, right?</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t know and you have to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>And also I don&rsquo;t, and be sort of self introspective</p>
<p>about what, how like biases I operate under</p>
<p>and ways I delude myself,</p>
<p>like hallucinations that I&rsquo;m living under.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like breaking out of all these hallucinations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to introspect thinking like</p>
<p>what are the assumptions under which I live my entire life</p>
<p>that might be actually false assumptions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really difficult thought process to take.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dangerous one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the nature if you gaze long into the abyss,</p>
<p>the abyss gaze into you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Alex Jones talks about this.</p>
<p>I mean he&rsquo;s living, he&rsquo;s got demons in his head.</p>
<p>So he has like all these conspiracy theories</p>
<p>that it holds in his head</p>
<p>but it begins to really destroy him.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a psychological burden to carry.</p>
<p>So if you question, if you question authority,</p>
<p>if you question government, if you question culture,</p>
<p>the way things have been done, it&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>And the biases you operate under,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really difficult to question them.</p>
<p>So I think like being constantly open minded</p>
<p>and self critical, not constantly,</p>
<p>but a little bit every day is important I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, you know, you&rsquo;re talking to somebody,</p>
<p>I grew up in Ramallah in Palestine in the West Bank.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed my mind on all kinds of different things.</p>
<p>The fact that I was even open to the idea of Bitcoin</p>
<p>is required, has required an enormous, enormous amount of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a heck of a journey.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d much rather appreciate, you know, direct arguments</p>
<p>rather than these kinds of general fluffy,</p>
<p>you know, you should be, oh, of course, yes,</p>
<p>you should be open minded,</p>
<p>but you know, also you come up with conclusions</p>
<p>and you delete spam email sometimes</p>
<p>when you know that it is spam</p>
<p>because you have to move on with your life.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s an opportunity cost</p>
<p>to considering every spam email, so.</p>
<p>Well, to me, okay, so I&rsquo;ll just say</p>
<p>from my relatively sort of shallow perspective,</p>
<p>almost like a technical person, mostly,</p>
<p>my understanding of economics is weak.</p>
<p>Proof of stake is not obviously</p>
<p>a weak consensus mechanism relative to proof of work.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not obvious to me that that goes wrong</p>
<p>and becomes corrupted in the way</p>
<p>that governments get corrupted</p>
<p>because it still seems decentralized.</p>
<p>Now, your criticism of governance is an interesting one,</p>
<p>but if you put that aside,</p>
<p>it still is a decentralized mechanism</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more transparent than the mechanism</p>
<p>that governments operate on.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s exactly what the Federal Reserve is.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is a proof of stake system.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is owned by its constituent banks</p>
<p>and so the rules of the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>and the regulations are determined by the ownership,</p>
<p>which is the banks.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exactly what the Federal Reserve is.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s too backdoor, the agreements</p>
<p>between the banks and the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>It feels like a lot of those agreements</p>
<p>are made between individuals that sort of behind the scenes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to, it&rsquo;s opaque.</p>
<p>Yes, but the only way that a proof of stake system</p>
<p>will take off is if you have a military</p>
<p>to force people to use it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there&rsquo;s no way that it&rsquo;s going to take off</p>
<p>on a free market.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why for all of the bluster</p>
<p>about wanting to move to a proof of stake system,</p>
<p>Ethereum have been saying this since 2014.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now been eight years that they&rsquo;ve been talking about it.</p>
<p>We still haven&rsquo;t seen the proof of stake system</p>
<p>operational in the wild.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vaporware for all practical and intentional.</p>
<p>Oh, Cardano&rsquo;s proof of stake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s potential.</p>
<p>I mean, you can do it in a centralized way,</p>
<p>but can it survive?</p>
<p>Can it last for a long time?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think it can last perhaps initially with marketing,</p>
<p>with centralized marketing, you can promote it.</p>
<p>But ultimately, user demand,</p>
<p>the people that are not interested in speculating</p>
<p>because they want to get rich on this,</p>
<p>the people that are going to use it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to want to use it because they can trust</p>
<p>that it is not going to be messed with.</p>
<p>Yes, but there&rsquo;s also applications.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also a lightning network.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s applications on top.</p>
<p>Well, the reason I&rsquo;m interested in things like Ethereum</p>
<p>is you might think it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>I thought it was ridiculous, but NFTs.</p>
<p>So you can have NFTs probably on top of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t because there&rsquo;s no marketing on Bitcoin</p>
<p>because all of these ideas get promoted</p>
<p>on proprietary shitcoins because, yes.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s the network effects of ideas, of applications.</p>
<p>So they just take off for some reason.</p>
<p>And human civilization is such that you get excited</p>
<p>about stuff and large amounts of people believe a thing</p>
<p>and they start to get excited and it actually has impact.</p>
<p>Like the fact that NFTs can have an impact on the art world</p>
<p>or the world in general is wild to me.</p>
<p>But it worked.</p>
<p>So the question is.</p>
<p>David Rothcall has an impact on the art world.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t say much.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m saying these ideas have,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re collective intelligent beings</p>
<p>and we can believe a thing and that has power.</p>
<p>That has led to major wars and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to me that NFTs took hold.</p>
<p>And the question is, is there distributed DApps?</p>
<p>Is there distributed apps built on top</p>
<p>of different blockchains</p>
<p>that might somehow transform the world?</p>
<p>You have to kind of keep an open mind to that.</p>
<p>Cause right now it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m the same place with that</p>
<p>as I am with like virtual reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, this seems like a really</p>
<p>intellectually promising set of ideas here,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something either technically</p>
<p>or socially not quite taking hold.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is.</p>
<p>So with virtual reality, what&rsquo;s the right answer?</p>
<p>Is it just technically the latency is too high</p>
<p>or the games are not good enough?</p>
<p>Or is it a fundamentally flawed idea</p>
<p>that you can live in a virtual world and enjoy it?</p>
<p>That the physical world is just orders of magnitude better?</p>
<p>Or a two dimensional display is just as good</p>
<p>as a three dimensional world?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Why is virtual reality not taking off?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been since the 80s, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have strong opinions on it,</p>
<p>on the prospect of the technology.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t want to ever imagine myself</p>
<p>having something on my eyes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather just go out into the real world.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have strong opinions on virtual reality.</p>
<p>I do have on dApps and NFTs.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s your criticism of dApps and NFTs?</p>
<p>Is this a distraction?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to sell a flawed technology?</p>
<p>The problem with dApps is, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the economics of it makes no sense</p>
<p>in the sense that currently,</p>
<p>if you wanted to run an application,</p>
<p>whatever the application is,</p>
<p>you want to run it on AWS,</p>
<p>you pay a specific amount of money,</p>
<p>you want to run it on your own laptop,</p>
<p>you pay a specific amount of money per kilobyte of data.</p>
<p>If you wanted to run the same thing on a distributed ledger,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re distributing the data</p>
<p>over thousands of computers worldwide,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s infinitely more expensive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we haven&rsquo;t seen any of these dApps take off.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve said this many years ago,</p>
<p>the only working application</p>
<p>of blockchain technology is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Because with Bitcoin, you know,</p>
<p>with a few hundred bytes of data,</p>
<p>with a few bytes of data,</p>
<p>you could move a billion dollars worth of economic value</p>
<p>from here to China and move it safely and reliably.</p>
<p>So that power,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see it being justified</p>
<p>for anything that is not as mission critical,</p>
<p>as moving large amounts of value,</p>
<p>which require very little amount of information.</p>
<p>So when you look at all of the buzzwords</p>
<p>that the Ethereum and other altcoin marketing people</p>
<p>like to use, and you know,</p>
<p>if you want to wonder really why</p>
<p>we come to this kind of aggression</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;ve heard all of this, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had all of these hucksters come to me for years,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s been, I&rsquo;ve had, you know, people in 2016</p>
<p>talk to me about how Ethereum blockchain technology</p>
<p>is going to revolutionize real estate deeds in India.</p>
<p>I remember this guy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to mention his name,</p>
<p>but this guy was, you know, 2016,</p>
<p>and he sold a lot of shitcoins</p>
<p>and he made a lot of money off of shitcoins</p>
<p>based on all these silly ideas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have Blackjack on a distributed ledger.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have Indian real estate</p>
<p>on a distributed ledger.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s concerned trolling marketing.</p>
<p>You know, oh, there&rsquo;s a problem with real estate in India,</p>
<p>real estate deeds, blockchain fixes this, buy my shitcoin.</p>
<p>And then people buy the shitcoin,</p>
<p>Indian real estate isn&rsquo;t fixed,</p>
<p>and the guy gets rich and they move on.</p>
<p>But I mean, I&rsquo;m still waiting for a dap to actually emerge.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s, the promise that we keep hearing</p>
<p>is something completely world changing,</p>
<p>world transforming.</p>
<p>And the reality is not one app.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s one of my good friends, Jimmy Song,</p>
<p>eventually they refused to go ahead with the bet.</p>
<p>He wanted to bet with one of the Ethereum people</p>
<p>about these daps.</p>
<p>You know, the Ethereum people are constantly saying</p>
<p>those daps are going to grow</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to have so many applications</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to have so many ideas.</p>
<p>And the reality is all the apps that work</p>
<p>are centralized apps, you know?</p>
<p>So there is no Uber on the blockchain.</p>
<p>There is no Twitter on the blockchain.</p>
<p>There is no social media on the blockchain</p>
<p>because these are businesses</p>
<p>and businesses require a centralized authority</p>
<p>to make decisions.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have it be decentralized.</p>
<p>Listen, you&rsquo;re frustrated,</p>
<p>and I could see it over a few years</p>
<p>of just having dealt with a humongous influx of charlatans.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say frustrated, I&rsquo;m amused.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s water off my back.</p>
<p>No, but a man that uses,</p>
<p>and a community that uses the word shit coin</p>
<p>is a little bit, you call it amusement.</p>
<p>And I think amusement is a way</p>
<p>to deal with the frustration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a channel and you have frustration.</p>
<p>Like sometimes when you have to deal with bullshit,</p>
<p>the best way is just to laugh at the absurdity of it all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you mean by amusement.</p>
<p>But the fact is like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s things like artificial intelligence for,</p>
<p>what is it, how many decades, seven decades,</p>
<p>has been off and on promising to change everything.</p>
<p>And it has failed time and time again</p>
<p>to deliver to the promise.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s something fundamental</p>
<p>and really powerful about both the small</p>
<p>and the big things going on</p>
<p>within the actual research and development</p>
<p>within those communities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of exciting developments.</p>
<p>And the scale at which those developments</p>
<p>might actually have a transformative impact,</p>
<p>the time scale is unclear.</p>
<p>It seems like we&rsquo;re certainly overpromising.</p>
<p>We dream too big and too aggressively</p>
<p>in the AI community, but in a lot of communities.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to give people the benefit of the doubt</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re overpromising,</p>
<p>but not when they&rsquo;re making their own money.</p>
<p>When you start making your own currency,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t get the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Because if your idea needs you to have a new currency</p>
<p>that you print when Bitcoin is out there,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and assume</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing this for the money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good time to mention</p>
<p>that I am actually launching my new coin called LexCoin.</p>
<p>You mean ShitCoin.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to block you with love.</p>
<p>Okay, one thing I wanted to ask you about</p>
<p>is the Feds, this paper they released in January 20th</p>
<p>on the potential central bank digital currency, CBDC.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about that?</p>
<p>Is it just another, like, is there pros and cons to this?</p>
<p>Is it at all interesting to you</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re even considering this kind of thing?</p>
<p>I used to think that it&rsquo;s just basically a waffle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meaningless.</p>
<p>And because as it exists,</p>
<p>the dollar is a central bank digital currency.</p>
<p>The vast majority of dollars are digital.</p>
<p>And, but I think the way that over the last couple of years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed my mind on this,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some serious substance behind these ideas.</p>
<p>And what they mean effectively</p>
<p>is the disintermediation of the banking system</p>
<p>and giving everybody an account at the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>This is kind of the really dangerous idea.</p>
<p>And I think this is enormously significant.</p>
<p>Effectively, as somebody who&rsquo;s lived in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>what this is, is the return of the Gosbank</p>
<p>on a global scale with modern technology.</p>
<p>So under the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>there was something called the Gosbank or People&rsquo;s Bank.</p>
<p>And that was the only bank in the country.</p>
<p>And you had an account with the National Bank.</p>
<p>And if you said something wrong,</p>
<p>your money got terminated from the Gosbank.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that combined</p>
<p>with the power of digital technology.</p>
<p>And you can see that this could be</p>
<p>an enormously powerful technology really,</p>
<p>because if banks are out of the picture,</p>
<p>then we changed the fundamental reality of fiat</p>
<p>as being the creation of money through lending.</p>
<p>And then it becomes the creation of money truly by fiat,</p>
<p>by government fiat.</p>
<p>So we moved to a system in which money is just basically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we have money that is pieces of paper.</p>
<p>And every time we&rsquo;ve had money,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had fiat money that was just pieces of paper,</p>
<p>it collapsed very quickly.</p>
<p>With the current system, money is credit.</p>
<p>And the creation of credit is restricted to some point.</p>
<p>And the creation of credit is self correcting.</p>
<p>I discussed this in the fiat standard.</p>
<p>If the central bank allows banks to create too much credit,</p>
<p>that creates a bubble.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a collapse in the money supply,</p>
<p>which prevents hyperinflation from happening</p>
<p>because the money creation is self destructive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s self correcting.</p>
<p>So you end up with an average of like 7% per year increase</p>
<p>because you have 10% for five years</p>
<p>and then you get negative 20% for one year</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s correcting.</p>
<p>But now if you get rid of the credit creation mechanism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just assigning money directly,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re likely gonna get much faster inflation.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s obviously the huge problem</p>
<p>and perhaps the even bigger problem</p>
<p>is the enormous amount of power</p>
<p>that it gives to governments.</p>
<p>It allows them to create an awful dystopia</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got your money on your phone</p>
<p>and anything you do is completely supervised</p>
<p>and controlled through your spending.</p>
<p>So they wanna introduce a new lockdown,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll just make your money not work.</p>
<p>Your money is broken today, you can&rsquo;t spend money</p>
<p>or you can only spend money in your local supermarket</p>
<p>for the next three months</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t leave your neighborhood,</p>
<p>your money stops working outside of your neighborhood.</p>
<p>This Chinese social credit score system</p>
<p>is an example of this.</p>
<p>And I think, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know what the likelihood is</p>
<p>of implementing something like this in the US.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed it with Michael Saylor,</p>
<p>he thinks it&rsquo;s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>He thinks the people who&rsquo;ve been pushing this</p>
<p>are very far from the position of power</p>
<p>and the traditional monetary and financial system</p>
<p>is going to survive intact.</p>
<p>I certainly hope so.</p>
<p>I think this would be a terrible thing if it comes to pass.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think, many people think</p>
<p>that it is something that would undermine Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Like a lot of common objection to Bitcoin is,</p>
<p>well, governments are just gonna launch</p>
<p>their own digital currencies</p>
<p>and then Bitcoin is gonna die.</p>
<p>And I think this is completely missing the point.</p>
<p>People think Bitcoin is important because it&rsquo;s digital.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>National currencies can be digital.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is important because it&rsquo;s not inflationary</p>
<p>and because nobody controls it.</p>
<p>Central bank digital currencies</p>
<p>are likely to be very inflationary</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re likely to have very strong control at the top.</p>
<p>So if anything, they are an advertisement for Bitcoin</p>
<p>rather than a replacement for it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s Bitcoin, if it&rsquo;s gold,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a way for multiple nations to partake.</p>
<p>So if you were to imagine a future</p>
<p>where we move from the fiat standard</p>
<p>back to the gold standard and then to the Bitcoin standard</p>
<p>or skipping that, going directly to the Bitcoin standard,</p>
<p>what would it take?</p>
<p>Is it gradual, is it immediate?</p>
<p>What are possible trajectories that take us?</p>
<p>Well, basically where the final sort of empirical</p>
<p>observation is that you overtake,</p>
<p>Bitcoin overtakes first gold and then bonds</p>
<p>in terms of its monetary power in the world.</p>
<p>But like just specifically from a government perspective,</p>
<p>how do we move the United States, China, Russia,</p>
<p>India, European Union to a Bitcoin standard?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely concerned about</p>
<p>whether governments move or not.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d be very happy for them not to move</p>
<p>as long as possible so that individuals can accumulate</p>
<p>more and more Bitcoin while it&rsquo;s still cheap.</p>
<p>So the people will move and the governments will catch up.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think this is kind of what I allude to.</p>
<p>I mean, the point of the fiat standard,</p>
<p>the fiat standard is really a Bitcoin book</p>
<p>and it talks about fiat most of the time,</p>
<p>but it does so to analyze Bitcoin and the rise of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, I discuss how I think</p>
<p>this relationship plays out.</p>
<p>The way that I tend to think of it</p>
<p>is that most likely what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re gonna have kind of a financial apartheid</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s going to be two monetary systems.</p>
<p>One is government controlled and it comes</p>
<p>with increasing amounts of surveillance and inflation.</p>
<p>And then if you want, you can just opt out of that</p>
<p>and get into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s likely going to be difficult for governments</p>
<p>to stop people from getting into Bitcoin</p>
<p>for all of the technical reasons</p>
<p>that make it very hard to stop Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So then we have this alternative that is Bitcoin,</p>
<p>which is not inflationary and does not have</p>
<p>a central authority that can censor it.</p>
<p>I think gradually is my hope</p>
<p>and I also think my most likely scenario,</p>
<p>but maybe I am biased because everybody thinks</p>
<p>what they want is what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re just gonna witness the same relationship</p>
<p>because governments make their currencies</p>
<p>so that they can devalue them and Bitcoin thrives on that.</p>
<p>And more and more people are gonna learn,</p>
<p>more and more people are gonna find out.</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s through curiosity or self interest</p>
<p>or through the destruction of the national currency,</p>
<p>all roads lead to a Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So more and more people are gonna buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>the price of Bitcoin is going to go up.</p>
<p>And as it goes up, Bitcoin becomes a more significant part</p>
<p>of the world economy.</p>
<p>And this is something that the skeptics don&rsquo;t get.</p>
<p>Like a lot of the academic skeptics to Bitcoin,</p>
<p>they offer up all of these theories</p>
<p>about why they think Bitcoin can&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and then they present it and they think,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve delivered the knockout blow</p>
<p>as if Bitcoin needs their permission</p>
<p>or the world is going to need their permission.</p>
<p>Well, the reality is people are gonna join Bitcoin</p>
<p>out of greed, out of self interest.</p>
<p>Number go up technology is really</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to get everybody in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the Trojan horse for fixing the world.</p>
<p>Come for the greed and stay for the revolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna keep going up</p>
<p>because people don&rsquo;t like to be poor,</p>
<p>except for most economists and academics.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t like to be poor.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t enjoy getting their wealth destroyed</p>
<p>and they care more about their self interest</p>
<p>than they care about economic theories</p>
<p>about whether this works as money or not.</p>
<p>They see their cousin escaped hyperinflation</p>
<p>and managed to get a bigger house</p>
<p>because they bought Bitcoin five years ago.</p>
<p>They realized maybe I should stop mocking my cousin</p>
<p>and start buying more Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And this is, I think an indomitable force</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to continue.</p>
<p>And one thing, most Bitcoiners tend to lean</p>
<p>toward an apocalyptic transition.</p>
<p>Fiat&rsquo;s gonna collapse, we&rsquo;re gonna get hyperinflation,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s gonna be terrible</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re gonna move to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And I present the case for why I think</p>
<p>maybe that might not be the case.</p>
<p>Maybe we won&rsquo;t get this kind of apocalyptic scenario.</p>
<p>And this was like the conclusion of the fiat standard,</p>
<p>which is once you realize that mining fiat</p>
<p>is creating debt and Bitcoin is allowing.</p>
<p>So in order to have fiat money,</p>
<p>we need to have people borrow.</p>
<p>We need to have people make loans.</p>
<p>And the problem that fiat money runs into today</p>
<p>is that if you wanna save money,</p>
<p>if you wanna hold savings, you have a problem.</p>
<p>Where do you put your savings?</p>
<p>So you put your savings in debt</p>
<p>in the creation of more bonds.</p>
<p>Wherever you take your savings,</p>
<p>you create a bubble in those things.</p>
<p>And this is why we see a bubble in the stock market,</p>
<p>a bubble in the bond market, a bubble in housing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because people are looking for savings,</p>
<p>looking for a place where they can save.</p>
<p>All of those things are crappy saving instruments</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like copper</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s nothing to stop the people behind them</p>
<p>to make more of them.</p>
<p>House builders can build more houses.</p>
<p>Governments can issue more bonds.</p>
<p>The crappy fraudulent companies can list</p>
<p>on the stock market and make more stocks.</p>
<p>Well, Bitcoin finally offers us an outlet.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to keep creating more debt.</p>
<p>We can invest in this asset that is hard</p>
<p>and that is internationally liquid</p>
<p>and that nobody can make more of.</p>
<p>So there is no bubble in it.</p>
<p>There is no mechanism for somebody to increase the supply</p>
<p>and bring the price crashing down,</p>
<p>like with copper and real estate and bonds.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin is the way out.</p>
<p>And this is why I think there&rsquo;s a good case to be made</p>
<p>for why the fiat authorities might embrace Bitcoin</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll see it is their way out</p>
<p>of this enormous debt bubble that everybody is stuck in.</p>
<p>Particularly, the richest and most powerful people</p>
<p>in the world and the richest</p>
<p>and most powerful governments in the world</p>
<p>are the world&rsquo;s biggest borrowers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones in a lot of debt.</p>
<p>So a continuous slow devaluation of the value of that debt</p>
<p>as people upgrade and move on to a hard asset</p>
<p>that continues to appreciate is the peaceful way</p>
<p>that we wind down the fiat ponzi, I think.</p>
<p>You could see it being like a political,</p>
<p>part of a political platform for future people</p>
<p>that run for president, those kinds of things to address.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s not just for the powerful and the rich.</p>
<p>The people are bothered by the debt.</p>
<p>The people are bothered by everything</p>
<p>that you describe with fiat.</p>
<p>And if you wanna sell yourself in a democracy</p>
<p>as a good leader, you might want to make</p>
<p>that part of the platform.</p>
<p>You mentioned you know Michael Malice.</p>
<p>He just texted me asking me to ask you,</p>
<p>what do you like best about Michael Malice?</p>
<p>If you can spend five to 10 to 20 to an hour</p>
<p>talking about the genius of Michael Malice,</p>
<p>what do you like?</p>
<p>Where does one even start?</p>
<p>Well, obviously, the haircut first.</p>
<p>Yeah, he just gets sexier with age, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Do you know his ideas, his trolling and humor,</p>
<p>have you gotten a chance to interact with him?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ve met Michael maybe 10, 12 years ago</p>
<p>in New York.</p>
<p>I used to live in New York when he used to live in New York.</p>
<p>Met him a couple of times.</p>
<p>There was a bunch of anarchists in New York</p>
<p>used to throw a happy hour once a month.</p>
<p>It was called the High Time Preference Hoppe Hour</p>
<p>in honor of Hans Hermann Hoppe.</p>
<p>So I met him there a couple of times</p>
<p>and we followed each other on Twitter for a while.</p>
<p>Is it interesting that you&rsquo;re aware</p>
<p>of philosophical differences in your worldviews?</p>
<p>No, I think we pretty much see eye to eye.</p>
<p>I think the difference is mainly that he spends</p>
<p>a lot of time focusing on American politics</p>
<p>and American pop culture,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t pay much attention to, I guess.</p>
<p>So you look more at the monetary system,</p>
<p>the economics of it all, and just the history</p>
<p>and just looking at it, zooming out at the big picture</p>
<p>of it all.</p>
<p>Although recently he&rsquo;s working on a book called</p>
<p>The White Pill and he&rsquo;s been, every time I see him,</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s in some dark aspect of the 20th century.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like, I just finished writing about Holodomor.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, he&rsquo;s not taking much, I believe,</p>
<p>of a monetary perspective on things.</p>
<p>His book, his writing, at least for time,</p>
<p>has a kind of philosophical ideology perspective</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s outside of the monetary system.</p>
<p>But you argue that those are actually inextricably linked.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t think he would disagree.</p>
<p>He would.</p>
<p>But a book has to be, can only be so long, I suppose.</p>
<p>It can only focus on so many things.</p>
<p>If you can put on your wise sage hat</p>
<p>and give some advice to young people.</p>
<p>I mean, the past four hours have been a kind of advice,</p>
<p>but if you can focus, and if somebody in high school</p>
<p>or college is thinking about what to do with their career,</p>
<p>can have a successful career, or to have a life</p>
<p>they can be proud of, what would you tell them?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say probably the most important advice</p>
<p>that I would give is to find a way</p>
<p>to give value to other people.</p>
<p>This is really the key thing.</p>
<p>You need to wake up every morning</p>
<p>and figure out how to serve others.</p>
<p>This is the key to everything you want in life.</p>
<p>Everything that you want is on the other side</p>
<p>of you serving others.</p>
<p>So figure out how you can serve others in a good way,</p>
<p>how you can do it in a way that they value.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got an incredible mechanism</p>
<p>for figuring that out, which is the market.</p>
<p>Go out there and do things for other people.</p>
<p>And you know, the market will tell you.</p>
<p>The market will tell you exactly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re young, you have the enormous advantage</p>
<p>of being able to make mistakes, essentially,</p>
<p>and learn from them.</p>
<p>So go out there, do things of value for others,</p>
<p>figuring out how you can do something that contributes,</p>
<p>what is it that you can do that contributes</p>
<p>the most value to other people&rsquo;s lives?</p>
<p>And increasingly, I think with the modern technology,</p>
<p>this is increasingly becoming online.</p>
<p>And I think you should consider</p>
<p>how you can create value online,</p>
<p>because that scales beyond anything that you can do</p>
<p>in the physical world in a very, very,</p>
<p>well, maybe not beyond, obviously,</p>
<p>there are profitable businesses in the physical world.</p>
<p>But I think online is enormous potential,</p>
<p>and coding, I think, is enormously powerful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a coder myself, but I strongly recommend</p>
<p>people get into learning how to code.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s probably the thing</p>
<p>that carries the most power.</p>
<p>So initially, we were working with our hands,</p>
<p>we started working with machines,</p>
<p>machines are much more productive.</p>
<p>Well, code is an even higher level of productivity</p>
<p>where you basically program the machines to produce things.</p>
<p>So, you know, few clicks of a keyboard,</p>
<p>and you can move millions of machines</p>
<p>around the world in certain ways.</p>
<p>So it carries an enormous amount of value.</p>
<p>I think I always tell all young people to learn to code,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best thing.</p>
<p>I used to tell it to my students when I was at university,</p>
<p>I tell them to drop out and go learn to code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a better use of their time and money.</p>
<p>Well, you could probably do both.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>University has an interesting function.</p>
<p>I mean, probably you and I have different perspective</p>
<p>on this, probably has to do with a little bit</p>
<p>of a different journey in terms of fields,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m so, I&rsquo;ve stayed engineering focused</p>
<p>for a long time, and there&rsquo;s less,</p>
<p>some of the troubles you might highlight</p>
<p>in the education system, there&rsquo;s less troubles</p>
<p>of that kind in engineering,</p>
<p>because math hasn&rsquo;t changed for a long time.</p>
<p>So a lot of it is just doing hard things,</p>
<p>being forced to do hard things,</p>
<p>and becoming a bit of a generalist,</p>
<p>while on the side, you&rsquo;re also becoming a specialist</p>
<p>based on your own passion, driven by your own passion.</p>
<p>So school, at least high school,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the university,</p>
<p>but high school has a really nice,</p>
<p>one of the only times in your life,</p>
<p>at least in my life, I was forced,</p>
<p>but now I see given the opportunity</p>
<p>to spend my entire day learning broadly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the way time works, it just runs away from you,</p>
<p>and you never really get a chance to do,</p>
<p>learn quite that broadly again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the curse of specialization,</p>
<p>is you kind of never get a chance</p>
<p>to study biology, chemistry.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a physicist, time runs away from you.</p>
<p>So enjoy the broad education of it.</p>
<p>But yeah, like you said,</p>
<p>find the things that valued by the market.</p>
<p>And on the other side of it, you said all the good stuff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also a way to get happiness.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;ll also add,</p>
<p>the horse that I like to whip all the time</p>
<p>is the low time preference aspect of things,</p>
<p>saving with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So I think my advice to young people is,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re young, you think of the world</p>
<p>in a very short term, generally.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re focused on the present,</p>
<p>and you think that everything that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the present is the most important thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever gonna happen in the history of humanity.</p>
<p>Lower your time preference, think about the future,</p>
<p>think about, think further down the line,</p>
<p>think about the consequences of the things you do,</p>
<p>and then what?</p>
<p>And so you do this now, it feels good today,</p>
<p>but then what happens tomorrow?</p>
<p>You go out, you drink, you enjoy yourself,</p>
<p>well, think about the hangover.</p>
<p>But more in longterm, think about the implication</p>
<p>of living this kind of life.</p>
<p>Think about every decision that you make,</p>
<p>the longterm implication of it.</p>
<p>And part of that is Bitcoin,</p>
<p>part of that is save in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I urge everybody to put savings in Bitcoin for the longterm.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy Bitcoin for the short term,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t buy Bitcoin today so that you can sell it,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put your savings in Bitcoin today</p>
<p>so that you can sell it all next month and buy a house.</p>
<p>Put money in Bitcoin that you expect to keep in Bitcoin</p>
<p>for another five, 10 years or so,</p>
<p>at least four years is what I recommend for people.</p>
<p>So keep a low time preference,</p>
<p>focus on the future, and save in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And learn about how to buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>how to learn about all this technology.</p>
<p>Part of this is this conversation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much awesome material out there.</p>
<p>And thank you, by the way,</p>
<p>for this gift of a hardware wallet.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So you should definitely invest in it yourself.</p>
<p>And what would you call this?</p>
<p>These are?</p>
<p>Open dimes.</p>
<p>Open dimes, yeah.</p>
<p>So this is like USB that you can,</p>
<p>like a hardware device that stores Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about knowing the password.</p>
<p>It contains the password within it and it&rsquo;s tamper proof.</p>
<p>So you can save the Bitcoin on it and.</p>
<p>So when the apocalypse comes,</p>
<p>you need the value to be stored,</p>
<p>an actual thing that you can have</p>
<p>in your physical possession.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what this is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had a heck of a life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been in a bunch of places in this world.</p>
<p>A lot of places.</p>
<p>Life is not easy in some of those places.</p>
<p>What has been, if you can take a step</p>
<p>to maybe a bit of a dark step for a short time,</p>
<p>what has been maybe darkest time period,</p>
<p>place you&rsquo;ve ever gone in your mind,</p>
<p>a dark period of your life,</p>
<p>a struggle you had to overcome, had to survive?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m Palestinian.</p>
<p>So that is the tragedy of my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Palestinian Jordanian.</p>
<p>My family&rsquo;s suffered a lot because of this historically.</p>
<p>I grew up in Ramallah in the West Bank.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t ideal to see that.</p>
<p>People like to think of it as this intractable conflict</p>
<p>between two bitter enemies.</p>
<p>But the reality of the matter is that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>A foreign ideology came in with the idea</p>
<p>that this country needs to be occupied</p>
<p>by people from only one religion</p>
<p>and the existing population, which,</p>
<p>I mean, Jews had always lived in Palestine historically.</p>
<p>And at the turn of the 20th century,</p>
<p>they were only 10% of the population.</p>
<p>But then with the birth of fiat money,</p>
<p>incidentally, the link with all of this is that</p>
<p>when the Bank of England went off gold,</p>
<p>a big reason why they were able to pull that off</p>
<p>was that the Rothschild banking family supported them.</p>
<p>And in exchange, the Rothschilds got Palestine.</p>
<p>And the Balfour Declaration was written</p>
<p>by the government of Britain to the Rothschild family,</p>
<p>telling them that they&rsquo;d like to make Palestine</p>
<p>a homeland for Jews.</p>
<p>So obviously that&rsquo;s not very convenient</p>
<p>for people who are not Jewish, for whom that is a homeland.</p>
<p>And the past 80 years has been a very painful struggle.</p>
<p>If you happen to not be Jewish.</p>
<p>And obviously, you know, obviously Palestinians</p>
<p>have done all kinds of things trying to fight back</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve done all kinds of wrong things.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think you can escape the fundamental reality</p>
<p>underlying this, which is that if you&rsquo;re not Jewish,</p>
<p>you are being moved out of the land.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s happened in 1947, 48,</p>
<p>happened in 1976, 1967,</p>
<p>more land was taken over by Israel.</p>
<p>Now you see it with the settlements.</p>
<p>You know, if you ignore the day to day headlines</p>
<p>and you ignore the media propaganda</p>
<p>and you ignore all of this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very clear thing that is happening,</p>
<p>which is more land owned by an exclusive ideology</p>
<p>that believes this land needs to be owned</p>
<p>by people from one religion</p>
<p>and everybody else is being kicked out.</p>
<p>And so that is the tragedy of my life.</p>
<p>And my wife is also a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon</p>
<p>and her family was evicted from Jaffa,</p>
<p>which is today on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>They still have their homes in Jaffa.</p>
<p>Their homes are being, you know,</p>
<p>they got kicked out of their homes</p>
<p>and their lands and their property.</p>
<p>They became refugees in Lebanon.</p>
<p>So my children, you know, it&rsquo;s an ongoing tragedy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that is,</p>
<p>a lot of the people that think of it as,</p>
<p>you know, they think Palestinians are just out there</p>
<p>to get Israelis because they hate them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an inescapable tragedy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a home anywhere.</p>
<p>Is there an escape from this tragedy in the future</p>
<p>that you see if you zoom out across the scale of decades,</p>
<p>will we see,</p>
<p>I hesitate to say peace,</p>
<p>but a significant decrease in human suffering</p>
<p>in this part of the region?</p>
<p>I certainly hope so.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, my interest in Bitcoin comes from,</p>
<p>came from a place of desperation with the situation there.</p>
<p>Traditional politics is a dead end.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see what I can be doing</p>
<p>to make things better there using traditional politics.</p>
<p>And I think a good friend of mine, Pierre Rochard,</p>
<p>you may know him on Twitter,</p>
<p>one of the brightest minds in Bitcoin in my opinion,</p>
<p>he told me his theory is that Bitcoin</p>
<p>is gonna bring peace to the Middle East</p>
<p>because land is a shit coin.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s got a very good point there,</p>
<p>that this fixation with land</p>
<p>and the bitterness with which people have to live,</p>
<p>land is likely to decline</p>
<p>when people are gonna have a form of property</p>
<p>that they can keep.</p>
<p>And so hopefully that will help in one way.</p>
<p>And of course the more obvious way</p>
<p>is that this is a conflict of governments</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a conflict that is financed by fiat.</p>
<p>And from day one, the entirely insane notion</p>
<p>that you could build a national and ethnic homeland.</p>
<p>And of course, this is the early 20th century.</p>
<p>So the idea behind Zionism is coming from the same place</p>
<p>where all these other ethnic nationalisms of Europe</p>
<p>were emerging.</p>
<p>And we saw how well, how horribly these worked out.</p>
<p>But the idea that you could,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing to say we wanna build a homeland</p>
<p>for Germans in Germany.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to say we wanna build the homelands</p>
<p>for Germans somewhere else.</p>
<p>And that was Palestine, that was Zionism.</p>
<p>And that was only possible thanks to fiat,</p>
<p>thanks to the ability of the British government</p>
<p>and all these other governments to continue to finance</p>
<p>this colonialist effort over time.</p>
<p>And it continues to finance war</p>
<p>and we see war all over the world continue to escalate</p>
<p>because the people who&rsquo;d make the decision</p>
<p>to escalate the war are not the ones who are paying for it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not the ones who are fighting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who sit in offices.</p>
<p>And in the case of most of Middle Eastern conflict,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s people who live abroad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s people who are abroad who are not part of it</p>
<p>who just are emotionally charged to it</p>
<p>because they watch it on TV.</p>
<p>So you have billions of Muslims around the world</p>
<p>and Jews around the world</p>
<p>who feel extremely emotionally attached to it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the ones fighting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the ones paying their own money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just getting governments to send money</p>
<p>and to send weapons and to take part.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fun as a spectator sport</p>
<p>for most of these people</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t get to live in it.</p>
<p>But I got to live in it, I saw it.</p>
<p>I grew up there.</p>
<p>I saw the settlement expansion.</p>
<p>And recently a few weeks ago, I went back to Ramallah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s amazing every time you go,</p>
<p>the settlements are just growing in an astonishing way.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not just housing units that are going up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an entire attempt to build,</p>
<p>to basically suffocate Palestinian areas</p>
<p>and force Palestinians to leave</p>
<p>or keep them living in horrific conditions.</p>
<p>And if I may, just because I have family in Ukraine,</p>
<p>I have family in Russia, since this war,</p>
<p>echoes of similar things are happening</p>
<p>in that part of the world too.</p>
<p>And I shudder to think about the decades to come</p>
<p>of the hate that is brewing,</p>
<p>the suffering that is brewing</p>
<p>based on decisions and pressures</p>
<p>and from not always people directly impacted by this.</p>
<p>So again, it feels like that military conflict</p>
<p>is not just a creation of like people on the ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a creation of leaders, power centers.</p>
<p>And perhaps, again, I&rsquo;m not smart enough,</p>
<p>but even the monetary system probably has a role to play.</p>
<p>I absolutely think it does.</p>
<p>Monetary system is what allows people</p>
<p>to just continue to treat war as a spectator sport.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what it comes down to.</p>
<p>And it starts with World War I and it&rsquo;s continued.</p>
<p>And this is why really, I think I&rsquo;ve said this before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tweeted this before and it was a pretty popular tweet,</p>
<p>but it also got a lot of people to dismiss the idea</p>
<p>with mockery, of course.</p>
<p>But I really think Bitcoin is the only technology</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to end World War I.</p>
<p>Once World War I started,</p>
<p>we got into this endless conflict</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been ongoing since then.</p>
<p>If you look at all the world&rsquo;s conflicts today,</p>
<p>pretty much they all trace back to World War I.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because when that Pandora&rsquo;s box</p>
<p>of government control of money was opened,</p>
<p>there was no longer a real restraint on war</p>
<p>except complete defeat and complete destruction</p>
<p>and complete death.</p>
<p>The war had to be total.</p>
<p>Before that, under the gold standard,</p>
<p>kings would send professional armies</p>
<p>to fight each other in battlefields.</p>
<p>And as soon as it became clear</p>
<p>that one side was establishing an advantage,</p>
<p>the fighting would stop and the kings would settle,</p>
<p>would agree to new terms.</p>
<p>Because it was extremely expensive</p>
<p>to build a professional army and you ran out of money.</p>
<p>So it was always the smartest thing to do</p>
<p>is to just stop fighting whenever you could.</p>
<p>And wars would take place.</p>
<p>Countries would fight each other in the battlefield.</p>
<p>But in the cities, life went on as normal.</p>
<p>And people within the same cities,</p>
<p>within the cities of the two countries</p>
<p>would be trading with one another.</p>
<p>Life would go on, but the war would be there.</p>
<p>And it was just an independent part of politics</p>
<p>that all right, we have a problem over this piece of land.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take it outside.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t fight in the civilian areas.</p>
<p>We go to the battlefield.</p>
<p>We fight with professional armies.</p>
<p>And in fact, sometimes the conflicts would be,</p>
<p>the armies would line up</p>
<p>and they would just have a small contingent</p>
<p>of the two armies fight with one another.</p>
<p>And as soon as one of them establishes an advantage,</p>
<p>then all right, well, you won, let&rsquo;s move on with it.</p>
<p>Governments were far, far, far more careful</p>
<p>about their monetary policy and their, sorry,</p>
<p>their war policy when they couldn&rsquo;t print their money.</p>
<p>And that has changed with Fiat.</p>
<p>And that has allowed this new emergence of this class</p>
<p>of what I like to call chicken hawks</p>
<p>of people who sit in offices</p>
<p>like the entire foreign policy establishment</p>
<p>in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>People who have never fought in war,</p>
<p>whose children will never fight a war,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ll never pay to fight a war,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ll never suffer a broken window</p>
<p>in their house because of war,</p>
<p>sitting there and based on these fucking moronic garbage</p>
<p>that they teach at moronic Fiat universities</p>
<p>about politics and geopolitics,</p>
<p>making decisions about, we need to invade that country</p>
<p>and we need to send war there.</p>
<p>And they can do that because they have</p>
<p>this endless money printer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, back under gold,</p>
<p>if you were a warrior, you went and actually joined the war.</p>
<p>And that, the people who pontificated about war</p>
<p>were the people who had experience with war,</p>
<p>the people who were sending their own children to war,</p>
<p>the people who were fighting with their own money.</p>
<p>Now you have all these fat parasitics come</p>
<p>sitting in Washington, DC deciding,</p>
<p>and Washington is just an example,</p>
<p>but all over the world this exists.</p>
<p>People who have never fought,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ll never carry the consequences,</p>
<p>are going to devalue the world&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>in order to go and have other people&rsquo;s children</p>
<p>fight each other because of stupid garbage</p>
<p>they learned about politics in university.</p>
<p>You said you value low time preference,</p>
<p>but I have news for you, that one day you will die,</p>
<p>as far as we know, you&rsquo;re a mortal being.</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time introspecting</p>
<p>and thinking about these things,</p>
<p>and I value life a lot.</p>
<p>I value my time on earth a lot,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see this in my dealings with people.</p>
<p>Go back to Twitter, why am I so brash and straightforward?</p>
<p>It really is because life is short.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t want to waste,</p>
<p>I think on my, I&rsquo;ve said this before,</p>
<p>on my tombstone, let it be written.</p>
<p>He never let anyone waste his time twice in his life.</p>
<p>His life is short.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can waste my time once,</p>
<p>you can get me to do something,</p>
<p>and then I realize that was a waste of time,</p>
<p>you will never get me to waste my time twice.</p>
<p>And so you show up in my Twitter with something stupid,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never showing up in my Twitter ever again.</p>
<p>You give people a chance, but you&rsquo;re a fast learner.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I try and use my time very wisely,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m unapologetic about it.</p>
<p>My time is the most precious thing,</p>
<p>and the way to get on my shit list forever</p>
<p>is to try and take away my time and to abuse my time.</p>
<p>If you do that, it&rsquo;s the one unforgivable sin for me.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really, I think that&rsquo;s my way</p>
<p>of coming to terms with mortality.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all gonna die, and so let&rsquo;s make the most out of it</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re still here.</p>
<p>And of course, the other way you come to terms</p>
<p>with mortality is you have children.</p>
<p>Given what you just said, doubly so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would spend</p>
<p>your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>This is the first time you did it,</p>
<p>so you probably regret all of it,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll probably never see each other again.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad you at least took the chance to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>I think you have impact on the world</p>
<p>that you probably are not even aware of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tremendous, and a lot of people love you,</p>
<p>and your work is important.</p>
<p>Even, you know, I disagree with some things you say,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s people that disagree with you,</p>
<p>but everybody respects you.</p>
<p>And thank you so much for spending</p>
<p>your really valuable time with me today, brother.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir, really appreciate it.</p>
<p>This was not a waste of time,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be happy to do it again.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Savedina Moose.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek.</p>
<p>Economic control is not merely control</p>
<p>of a sector of human life</p>
<p>which can be separated from the rest.</p>
<p>It is the control of the means for all our ends.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
