property="og:description" content="Video Transcript ﻿i had a question from someone that wanted to know why am i so tired when i do intermittent fasting so this video is on that topic now when you originally start keto and you go from a high carb to a low carb there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a transition period it&amp;rsquo;s called keto adaptation and some of the common symptoms are keto fatigue so you&amp;rsquo;re not just going to be tired when you&amp;rsquo;re eating you&amp;rsquo;re going to be tired when you&amp;rsquo;re doing intermittent fasting between the meals as well that could be just because you haven&amp;rsquo;t adapted the fat and it could also be because your carbs aren&amp;rsquo;t low enough so if you keep your carbs a little bit higher it&amp;rsquo;s going to be more difficult to adapt to fat because fat birding is all about depriving your carbohydrates that&amp;rsquo;s what induces ketosis which is the byproduct of burning fat also it does take some time to adapt to fat burning and it could take anywhere between three days to a week sometimes even longer if you have severe insulin resistance or diabetes so if you&amp;rsquo;ve just started keto give it more time make sure your carbs are low number two more potassium you have billions and billions of these little pumps called sodium potassium pumps that generate energy electrical current like a battery to power your muscles and your nervous system and so if your diet does not have enough potassium because you don&amp;rsquo;t like vegetables you&amp;rsquo;re not going to generate energy magnesium is also required to make the energy currency in the body called atp and mainly you&amp;rsquo;re going to get it in leafy greens big salads but the one that i want to emphasize is when you do keto sometimes you can be b1 deficient let me explain when you do high carbs your body requires a tremendous amount of b1 the more carbohydrate you consume the more b1 you need and if you&amp;rsquo;re not getting enough b1 you&amp;rsquo;re going to be deficient but when you switch over to keto you&amp;rsquo;re typically not going to need as much b1 as you did doing high carb however you&amp;rsquo;re still going to need b1 and if you are doing higher amounts of fat that are not necessarily mixed with protein for example let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re adding mct oil or butter or keto bombs or coconut oil where you&amp;rsquo;re having these fats out of the normal complex realize that fat does not contain b1 and so as you&amp;rsquo;re metabolizing that you need b1 to metabolize it and break it down it could be drawing from your reserves so if you are doing a good amount of fat without the b1 that can create more of a b1 deficiency or at least aggravate that deficiency and give you some of the b1 symptoms which are fatigue and nervousness and the inability to relax like you&amp;rsquo;re feeling stressed now there&amp;rsquo;s several other things that people do when they start a ketogenic diet they tend to drink more coffee and sometimes tea both of these will deplete b1 and that could end up making you tired if you&amp;rsquo;re doing keto and you&amp;rsquo;re doing wine i know certain programs are okay with you doing the keto friendly wine in my program i don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it but if you&amp;rsquo;re doing wine wine has two things one is alcohol and the other is sulphites as a preservative both of those items will deplete you of b1 also if you eat just all cooked foods that&amp;rsquo;s going to deplete your b1 as well so that&amp;rsquo;s why i recommend a good amount of raw vegetables things like that now raw fish like in sushi could also create a b1 deficiency and let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re also a diabetic and you&amp;rsquo;re trying keto and you&amp;rsquo;re still in metformin metformin also depletes b1 big time this is one of the reasons why um people that are on metformin could have a serious side effect called lactic acidosis that&amp;rsquo;s a b1 deficiency so anyway if you are tired on keto these are the three things that are going on don&amp;rsquo;t forget about b1 i would always recommend taking b1 in the form of nutritional yeast thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u."><meta property="og:url"

why am i so tired when i do intermittent fasting  </p><p>so this video is on that topic now when you 
originally start keto and you go from a high carb  </p><p>to a low carb there&rsquo;s going to be a transition 
period it&rsquo;s called keto adaptation and  </p><p>some of the common symptoms are keto fatigue so 
you&rsquo;re not just going to be tired when you&rsquo;re  </p><p>eating you&rsquo;re going to be tired when you&rsquo;re doing 
intermittent fasting between the meals as well  </p><p>that could be just because you haven&rsquo;t adapted 
the fat and it could also be because your carbs  </p><p>aren&rsquo;t low enough so if you keep your carbs a 
little bit higher it&rsquo;s going to be more difficult  </p><p>to adapt to fat because fat birding is all about 
depriving your carbohydrates that&rsquo;s what induces  </p><p>ketosis which is the byproduct of 
burning fat also it does take some time  </p><p>to adapt to fat burning and it could 
take anywhere between three days  </p><p>to a week sometimes even longer if you have 
severe insulin resistance or diabetes so if  </p><p>you&rsquo;ve just started keto give it more time make 
sure your carbs are low number two more potassium  </p><p>you have billions and billions of these little 
pumps called sodium potassium pumps that generate  </p><p>energy electrical current like a battery to 
power your muscles and your nervous system  </p><p>and so if your diet does not have enough potassium 
because you don&rsquo;t like vegetables you&rsquo;re not going  </p><p>to generate energy magnesium is also required to 
make the energy currency in the body called atp  </p><p>and mainly you&rsquo;re going to get it in leafy 
greens big salads but the one that i want to  </p><p>emphasize is when you do keto sometimes you can be 
b1 deficient let me explain when you do high carbs  </p><p>your body requires a tremendous amount of b1 the 
more carbohydrate you consume the more b1 you need  </p><p>and if you&rsquo;re not getting enough b1 you&rsquo;re going 
to be deficient but when you switch over to keto  </p><p>you&rsquo;re typically not going to need as much 
b1 as you did doing high carb however you&rsquo;re  </p><p>still going to need b1 and if you are doing 
higher amounts of fat that are not necessarily  </p><p>mixed with protein for example let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re 
adding mct oil or butter or keto bombs or coconut  </p><p>oil where you&rsquo;re having these fats out of the 
normal complex realize that fat does not contain  </p><p>b1 and so as you&rsquo;re metabolizing that you 
need b1 to metabolize it and break it down  </p><p>it could be drawing from your reserves so if you 
are doing a good amount of fat without the b1  </p><p>that can create more of a b1 deficiency or at 
least aggravate that deficiency and give you  </p><p>some of the b1 symptoms which are fatigue 
and nervousness and the inability to relax  </p><p>like you&rsquo;re feeling stressed now there&rsquo;s several 
other things that people do when they start a  </p><p>ketogenic diet they tend to drink more coffee 
and sometimes tea both of these will deplete b1  </p><p>and that could end up making you tired if 
you&rsquo;re doing keto and you&rsquo;re doing wine i know  </p><p>certain programs are okay with you doing the keto 
friendly wine in my program i don&rsquo;t recommend it  </p><p>but if you&rsquo;re doing wine wine has two things 
one is alcohol and the other is sulphites as  </p><p>a preservative both of those items will deplete 
you of b1 also if you eat just all cooked foods  </p><p>that&rsquo;s going to deplete your b1 as well 
so that&rsquo;s why i recommend a good amount of  </p><p>raw vegetables things like that now raw fish like 
in sushi could also create a b1 deficiency and  </p><p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re also a diabetic and you&rsquo;re trying 
keto and you&rsquo;re still in metformin metformin also  </p><p>depletes b1 big time this is one of the reasons 
why um people that are on metformin could have a  </p><p>serious side effect called lactic acidosis that&rsquo;s 
a b1 deficiency so anyway if you are tired on keto  </p><p>these are the three things that are going on 
don&rsquo;t forget about b1 i would always recommend  </p><p>taking b1 in the form of nutritional yeast thanks 
for watching before you go if you have a question  </p><p>about a product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want 
to know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and  </p><p>you need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth 
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p><p>this is just for the people in the u.s 
hopefully in the future we&rsquo;ll be able to  </p><p>answer everyone&rsquo;s call but i put the number 
down below so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
