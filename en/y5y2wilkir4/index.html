is can vitamin deficiencies actually cause serious disease now you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ever connect a vitamin deficiency with a serious disease but there are quite a few diseases that stem from nutrient deficiencies now they&amp;rsquo;re called classical deficiencies so you have the classical scurvy which is a vitamin c deficiency rickets vitamin d deficiency osteomalacia which is also a vitamin d deficiency which most of the time occurs when you get a little bit older beriberi which is a b1 deficiency pellegra which is a vitamin b3 deficiency so those are the classical deficiencies that are you&amp;rsquo;ll see in many many different textbooks you also have sub clinical deficiencies which don&amp;rsquo;t really show up physically yet they&amp;rsquo;re brewing in the oven and eventually they create problems down the road and you may notice some symptoms but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to recognize unless you understand the link between nutrient deficiencies and their manifestation now a lot of these deficiencies start in the fetus especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not breastfed and you&amp;rsquo;re consuming infant formula there&amp;rsquo;s some really really important nutrients that a pregnant woman and someone who&amp;rsquo;s breastfeeding must get in the diet enough zinc vitamin d folate iodine omega-3 fatty acids these are vital if you&amp;rsquo;re deficient in iodine first of all you&amp;rsquo;re going to be have a stunted growth secondly you&amp;rsquo;re going to have a lower intelligence so it can create a lot of issues and so if your mother is deficient in folate you can end up with what&amp;rsquo;s called a neural tube defect which means part of your spinal column is not closing properly so your spinal cord is literally being exposed and it&amp;rsquo;s not protected and vitamin d is really important in maintaining the structure of your skeletal system as well as the tone of the muscles so if you&amp;rsquo;re deficient in vitamin d you could have things like scoliosis flat feet kyphosis which is hunchback lordosis which is an excessive low back curve as well as a lot of dental problems in your maxillary bone and in your jaw and it&amp;rsquo;s interesting because if you look up information on classical deficiencies they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you that they&amp;rsquo;re rare because of the fortification of foods where we added synthetic vitamins but let&amp;rsquo;s go down the list and talk about each one a vitamin c deficiency severe scurvy fatigue bleeding gums that&amp;rsquo;s gingivitis loss of connective tissue rickets that is low vitamin d your legs start bowing out your bones start to malform like i&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned you have a lot of muscle weakness and cramps then we get to beriberi which is a vitamin b1 deficiency now a severe b1 deficiency can create some serious disease dementia loss of memory neuropathy nerve damage you get brain atrophy your brain actually shrinks when you don&amp;rsquo;t have a certain nutrient all these vitamins are cofactors they&amp;rsquo;re helper compounds to allow the chemistry in your body to work right and so if you&amp;rsquo;re missing one of these cofactors it has profound effects down the road osteomalacia that&amp;rsquo;s basically soft bones this happens mainly when you get older but it also could occur when you&amp;rsquo;re young as well with this you there&amp;rsquo;s pain in the legs you have weakness in the muscles you have weakness in the lower back so how many people have low back pain and they don&amp;rsquo;t realize it could be a subclinical osteomalacia or a vitamin d deficiency pellegra they call it the four d&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s a b3 deficiency diarrhea dermatitis dementia and death and then we have night blind this vitamin a vitamin a is very very important if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough you can literally go blind then you have heart attacks if you have a severe vitamin e deficiency your heart can go into a cramp it can cause angina and you can have a heart attack now a couple things i want to mention that are a little more interesting than what i just talked about number one a lot of these deficiencies occur when you consume refined foods okay because especially vitamin e b3 b1 vitamin c and even a vitamin d deficiency could be created when you&amp;rsquo;re consuming refined foods consuming refined foods as in refined carbohydrates then lead to insulin resistance and your ability to absorb these nutrients goes way down but this is what i really want to talk about these are the causes of these effects these are the symptoms these are the causes right but when you look up a lot of these symptoms they&amp;rsquo;re classified as a disease or a cause of something and when you&amp;rsquo;re researching a lot of things like bleeding gums as in gingivitis if you look to the cause of that you don&amp;rsquo;t even see vitamin c on the list it&amp;rsquo;s not even there and so they they say well it&amp;rsquo;s a condition it leads to excessive bleeding and you should brush your teeth more or dental floss your teeth but they don&amp;rsquo;t get into the nutritional causative factors let&amp;rsquo;s say for example you looked up dementia it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even mention b1 at all or even neuropathy it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even talk about b1 or let&amp;rsquo;s take dermatitis vitamin b3 is not even on the radar and even when we get to heart attacks which by the way this should be on the other side of this as being the symptom of low vitamin e look at heart attacks they&amp;rsquo;ll talk about you know smoking not enough exercise eating fatty foods etc etc but what about this vitamin e so there&amp;rsquo;s a big disconnect between the nutrient deficiency effects to all of their symptoms which then are classified as a disease and it&amp;rsquo;s very confusing and you know when you treat symptoms and you don&amp;rsquo;t really know the true cause you never really get rid of the problem now if you have not seen my video on the most nutrient dense foods that you can eat i put that right here check it out before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&amp;rsquo;s call but i put the number down below so you can call and

actually cause serious disease now you wouldn&rsquo;t  </p><p>ever connect a vitamin deficiency with a 
serious disease but there are quite a few  </p><p>diseases that stem from nutrient deficiencies 
now they&rsquo;re called classical deficiencies  </p><p>so you have the classical scurvy which is a 
vitamin c deficiency rickets vitamin d deficiency  </p><p>osteomalacia which is also a vitamin d deficiency 
which most of the time occurs when you get a  </p><p>little bit older beriberi which is a b1 deficiency 
pellegra which is a vitamin b3 deficiency so those  </p><p>are the classical deficiencies that are you&rsquo;ll see 
in many many different textbooks you also have sub  </p><p>clinical deficiencies which don&rsquo;t really show 
up physically yet they&rsquo;re brewing in the oven  </p><p>and eventually they create problems down the road 
and you may notice some symptoms but it&rsquo;s hard to  </p><p>recognize unless you understand the link between 
nutrient deficiencies and their manifestation now  </p><p>a lot of these deficiencies start in the 
fetus especially if you&rsquo;re not breastfed  </p><p>and you&rsquo;re consuming infant formula there&rsquo;s 
some really really important nutrients that  </p><p>a pregnant woman and someone who&rsquo;s breastfeeding 
must get in the diet enough zinc vitamin d  </p><p>folate iodine omega-3 fatty acids these are vital 
if you&rsquo;re deficient in iodine first of all you&rsquo;re  </p><p>going to be have a stunted growth secondly 
you&rsquo;re going to have a lower intelligence  </p><p>so it can create a lot of issues and so if your 
mother is deficient in folate you can end up with  </p><p>what&rsquo;s called a neural tube defect which means 
part of your spinal column is not closing properly  </p><p>so your spinal cord is literally being exposed 
and it&rsquo;s not protected and vitamin d is really  </p><p>important in maintaining the structure of your 
skeletal system as well as the tone of the muscles  </p><p>so if you&rsquo;re deficient in vitamin d you could 
have things like scoliosis flat feet kyphosis  </p><p>which is hunchback lordosis which is an excessive 
low back curve as well as a lot of dental problems  </p><p>in your maxillary bone and in your jaw and it&rsquo;s 
interesting because if you look up information  </p><p>on classical deficiencies they&rsquo;ll tell you that 
they&rsquo;re rare because of the fortification of foods  </p><p>where we added synthetic vitamins but let&rsquo;s go 
down the list and talk about each one a vitamin  </p><p>c deficiency severe scurvy fatigue bleeding 
gums that&rsquo;s gingivitis loss of connective tissue  </p><p>rickets that is low vitamin d your 
legs start bowing out your bones  </p><p>start to malform like i&rsquo;ve already mentioned 
you have a lot of muscle weakness and cramps  </p><p>then we get to beriberi which is a vitamin b1 
deficiency now a severe b1 deficiency can create  </p><p>some serious disease dementia loss of memory 
neuropathy nerve damage you get brain atrophy  </p><p>your brain actually shrinks when you don&rsquo;t have a 
certain nutrient all these vitamins are cofactors  </p><p>they&rsquo;re helper compounds to allow the chemistry in 
your body to work right and so if you&rsquo;re missing  </p><p>one of these cofactors it has profound effects 
down the road osteomalacia that&rsquo;s basically  </p><p>soft bones this happens mainly when you get older 
but it also could occur when you&rsquo;re young as well  </p><p>with this you there&rsquo;s pain in the legs you have 
weakness in the muscles you have weakness in the  </p><p>lower back so how many people have low back pain 
and they don&rsquo;t realize it could be a subclinical  </p><p>osteomalacia or a vitamin d deficiency pellegra 
they call it the four d&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a b3 deficiency  </p><p>diarrhea dermatitis dementia and death 
and then we have night blind this vitamin  </p><p>a vitamin a is very very important if you 
don&rsquo;t have enough you can literally go blind  </p><p>then you have heart attacks if you have a 
severe vitamin e deficiency your heart can  </p><p>go into a cramp it can cause angina and you can 
have a heart attack now a couple things i want to  </p><p>mention that are a little more interesting 
than what i just talked about number one  </p><p>a lot of these deficiencies occur when you consume 
refined foods okay because especially vitamin e  </p><p>b3 b1 vitamin c and even a vitamin d deficiency 
could be created when you&rsquo;re consuming refined  </p><p>foods consuming refined foods as in refined 
carbohydrates then lead to insulin resistance and  </p><p>your ability to absorb these nutrients goes way 
down but this is what i really want to talk about  </p><p>these are the causes of these effects these 
are the symptoms these are the causes right but  </p><p>when you look up a lot of these symptoms they&rsquo;re 
classified as a disease or a cause of something  </p><p>and when you&rsquo;re researching a lot of things 
like bleeding gums as in gingivitis if you  </p><p>look to the cause of that you don&rsquo;t even see 
vitamin c on the list it&rsquo;s not even there and  </p><p>so they they say well it&rsquo;s a condition it leads 
to excessive bleeding and you should brush your  </p><p>teeth more or dental floss your teeth but they 
don&rsquo;t get into the nutritional causative factors  </p><p>let&rsquo;s say for example you looked up dementia it 
doesn&rsquo;t even mention b1 at all or even neuropathy  </p><p>it doesn&rsquo;t even talk about b1 or let&rsquo;s take 
dermatitis vitamin b3 is not even on the radar and  </p><p>even when we get to heart attacks which by the way 
this should be on the other side of this as being  </p><p>the symptom of low vitamin e look at heart attacks 
they&rsquo;ll talk about you know smoking not enough  </p><p>exercise eating fatty foods etc etc but what about 
this vitamin e so there&rsquo;s a big disconnect between  </p><p>the nutrient deficiency effects to all of their 
symptoms which then are classified as a disease  </p><p>and it&rsquo;s very confusing and you know when you 
treat symptoms and you don&rsquo;t really know the true  </p><p>cause you never really get rid of the problem now 
if you have not seen my video on the most nutrient  </p><p>dense foods that you can eat i put that right here 
check it out before you go if you have a question  </p><p>about a product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want 
to know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and  </p><p>you need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth 
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p><p>this is just for the people in the us hopefully in 
the future we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
