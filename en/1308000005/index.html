    <p>All right, everybody, welcome back to the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here with Chamath Palihapitiya, David Friedberg,</p>
<p>and David Sachs.</p>
<p>Our usual foursome as we chop up the business news</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And just as a point of order, the frequency of the show</p>
<p>is, well, don&rsquo;t ask me.</p>
<p>As we feel like it.</p>
<p>As we feel like it, correct.</p>
<p>So do not ask me to advertise on the podcast</p>
<p>because Chamath banned advertising.</p>
<p>And do not ask me when the next one is.</p>
<p>The next one is when Chamath decides</p>
<p>he wants to go on a rant.</p>
<p>But how are you holding up, Bestie C?</p>
<p>Bestie C is doing pretty well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the family, everything?</p>
<p>Have you come out of quarantine in any way?</p>
<p>So the first question I have for people is,</p>
<p>has your behavior changed now as we go into,</p>
<p>I think what most people are calling phase two?</p>
<p>Any change in what you&rsquo;re doing and the risk</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re willing to take?</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of ventured out a little bit.</p>
<p>But I just kind of put on a mask.</p>
<p>The only place I don&rsquo;t wear a mask is when</p>
<p>I walk around my house.</p>
<p>Just because it&rsquo;s, you know, I live in the suburbs.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s just so much space between people</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really run into anybody.</p>
<p>But if I have to go to Walgreens or CVS or whatever,</p>
<p>I always bring a mask and gloves.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve ventured out a little bit.</p>
<p>But nothing meaningful, to be quite honest.</p>
<p>And Saxe, you&rsquo;re still out of the country</p>
<p>in an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>How are you feeling about what risks you&rsquo;re willing to take?</p>
<p>You know, small groups of people?</p>
<p>Are you going out to a restaurant?</p>
<p>Are you seeing other people?</p>
<p>How do you look at the risk you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to take personally?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve adjusted my risk profile, I think, quite a bit.</p>
<p>So I mean, the learning over the past few months</p>
<p>was just that the fatality rate for, say,</p>
<p>relatively healthy people under 50 without risk factors</p>
<p>is 50 times lower than, say, someone over 60</p>
<p>or someone who has risk factors.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not being reckless.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m willing to kind of re-engage</p>
<p>in social behavior among groups of friends.</p>
<p>And on the theory that all of my friends have been locked down,</p>
<p>I was in total lockdown for two months.</p>
<p>So have my friends.</p>
<p>And so, you know.</p>
<p>I have several questions.</p>
<p>The first is, I mean, how old are you?</p>
<p>You look like 90, roughly.</p>
<p>How old are you exactly?</p>
<p>So how do the risk factors apply to you?</p>
<p>Second, you have friends.</p>
<p>Both of these things.</p>
<p>Well, we know there&rsquo;s three on this call.</p>
<p>Oh, Saxy Poo, I love you.</p>
<p>I miss you.</p>
<p>No, I mean, you raise a good point.</p>
<p>I mean, my physical age might be 90,</p>
<p>but my lungs are only 48 years old.</p>
<p>And so hopefully my lungs qualify</p>
<p>in that under 50 category.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been playing golf with friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of widened the circle of people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to let into my quarantine, basically.</p>
<p>By a dozen?</p>
<p>By 100?</p>
<p>How would you?</p>
<p>By about, I&rsquo;ve actually let in, not all at once,</p>
<p>but at different times, probably about 20 people.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So you feel comfortable.</p>
<p>And those people, you do ask them, have you quarantined?</p>
<p>Have you been wearing masks?</p>
<p>Have you been tested?</p>
<p>Or are you just like, you kind of?</p>
<p>I mean, I generally know that people have,</p>
<p>I mean, now this may change over the next few months,</p>
<p>but everyone&rsquo;s been kind of under shelter in place.</p>
<p>And so if you were gonna start to socializing</p>
<p>with your friends, this would be the safest time to do it</p>
<p>because everybody has been sort of locked down</p>
<p>to some degree and most places have been closed.</p>
<p>And so, if your friends haven&rsquo;t gotten it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably pretty safe.</p>
<p>All right, swinging over to you, Dave Friedberg,</p>
<p>tell me what you think of Saks&rsquo; position.</p>
<p>Obviously, Chamath&rsquo;s still in quarantine,</p>
<p>venturing off to the store once in a while.</p>
<p>Saks opening up to 20 people or whatever</p>
<p>in small groups playing golf outdoors,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m assuming he&rsquo;s not having</p>
<p>like an indoor party for 50, obviously.</p>
<p>How would you look at the risk he&rsquo;s taking</p>
<p>and what risk are you taking, Friedberg,</p>
<p>personally in your life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not too dissimilar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got about eight buddies coming over</p>
<p>to the pool this afternoon.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do kind of like a Father&rsquo;s Day hang session,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna be outside.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done a lot of hiking without masks</p>
<p>and going outside without masks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really too concerned about outdoor behavior.</p>
<p>There was a good analysis done that showed</p>
<p>in tracing cases where they actually found the origin</p>
<p>of where transmission occurred, 97% occurred indoors.</p>
<p>So generally speaking, like outdoor activity to me</p>
<p>is like pretty reasonable to do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty free with like doing stuff outside,</p>
<p>meeting friends outside, hanging out by the pool,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of people come by and hang out.</p>
<p>And then indoor stuff, I try and avoid.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m gonna go into a supermarket or a grocery store,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wear a mask and I&rsquo;ll be in there</p>
<p>as short a time period as I need to be.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certainly not going into restaurants</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But you would sit outdoor.</p>
<p>Is that a restaurant?</p>
<p>I would assume if the tables were six feet apart,</p>
<p>would you go to a restaurant and sit in a restaurant?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not rushing to do that just yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just something a little bit weird</p>
<p>about the way some of those are configured,</p>
<p>but generally, yes, like outdoor seems fine,</p>
<p>but like the way they set it up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re exposing yourself</p>
<p>to a bunch of people around you</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re pretty confined spaces</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re setting up these tables at.</p>
<p>But yeah, sunlight and wind effectively</p>
<p>will break apart the protein that is the virus</p>
<p>and you will not have this kind of infectious viral particle.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a pretty well-understood thing at this point.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not spoken about as much by public health officials</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t wanna kind of mitigate the concern</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want people to start taking off masks</p>
<p>and taking on very risky behavior.</p>
<p>But yeah, generally speaking,</p>
<p>I think kind of like outdoor behavior</p>
<p>is pretty safe and non-transmissible.</p>
<p>The risky stuff I&rsquo;m doing is we had just having like folks</p>
<p>come back to the house and that&rsquo;s where I kind of still</p>
<p>try and draw the line, which is having people in the house</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know where they&rsquo;ve been.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a little bit concerning.</p>
<p>Inside the house, the spittle particles with COVID-19,</p>
<p>any of them, if they did, would be lingering.</p>
<p>That is what, I&rsquo;m sorry to be graphic,</p>
<p>but that is the concern, correct, Freeberg?</p>
<p>Is that when you&rsquo;re outdoors, the spittle would blow away</p>
<p>and the particles are in the skin.</p>
<p>I mean, it really does evaporate.</p>
<p>So the liquid that holds the protein,</p>
<p>because the protein needs to be in a liquid</p>
<p>to kind of maintain its integrity,</p>
<p>when that evaporates and it&rsquo;ll evaporate from wind</p>
<p>or from sun and that protein will degrade,</p>
<p>it becomes kind of a non-infectious particle at that point.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re inside</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have those mechanisms,</p>
<p>that particle can just float around in the air</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how it gets spread.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why in the tracing work that was done,</p>
<p>it shows like 97% of cases happen</p>
<p>in an indoor environment just like this.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe in the six foot thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re six foot away from someone in a room,</p>
<p>people are coughing and that room gets filled</p>
<p>with those particles over a one hour period.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re fucking six feet away</p>
<p>or 20 feet away, that stuff&rsquo;s in the air.</p>
<p>So this whole notion about like,</p>
<p>hey, distance yourself in a restaurant, an indoor space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, no, that&rsquo;s actually not gonna necessarily</p>
<p>solve a problem.</p>
<p>Maybe if someone immediately sneezed, you&rsquo;ll avoid it.</p>
<p>But I mean, certainly SACS&rsquo;s advocacy for masks-</p>
<p>Hey, Freeburgers, is that an aura ring you&rsquo;re wearing?</p>
<p>Yeah, have you tried it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually just bought it a few weeks ago</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been using it to monitor my sleep.</p>
<p>But there was an article that said that,</p>
<p>I think that all the NBA players</p>
<p>are going to be given these aura rings as well</p>
<p>because it can apparently detect coronavirus</p>
<p>three days ahead of other ways</p>
<p>because it can see a change</p>
<p>in your basal sort of body temperature.</p>
<p>Yeah, so UCSF ran this data with them</p>
<p>and they developed this algorithm</p>
<p>that they think is pretty predictive.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see if it works in production,</p>
<p>but yeah, that&rsquo;s the theory.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also this connected thermometer</p>
<p>that if you use it, I forgot the name of it,</p>
<p>it sends all the data to a central repository</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been able to predict it as well.</p>
<p>And this just, when we look at how the government-</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called rectitemp.</p>
<p>Rectitemp, it has to go in your rectum.</p>
<p>Just whatever&rsquo;s going on in your rectum,</p>
<p>it goes right to the government.</p>
<p>But this is an interesting thing</p>
<p>when you think about low-cost ways to deal with this.</p>
<p>The amount of money we poured into the system, Chamath,</p>
<p>is so great that if we just sent</p>
<p>every single person in America an aura ring</p>
<p>or one of these thermometers and said,</p>
<p>just take your temperature all the day,</p>
<p>we would know where the outbreaks were</p>
<p>and that would be a lot less expensive</p>
<p>than a lot of the stimulus we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to try to cure what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Do you agree that we should maybe include that</p>
<p>in some sort of approach?</p>
<p>Look, I think the basic issue is that</p>
<p>something really odd has happened in the United States</p>
<p>and we were talking about this in our group chat,</p>
<p>which is that we have managed to find a way</p>
<p>to politicize absolutely everything.</p>
<p>And some things, for example, like universal basic income</p>
<p>or what is our national policy towards China,</p>
<p>those are political issues.</p>
<p>But things of public health,</p>
<p>when they get sort of distorted</p>
<p>and viewed through a political lens or just idiotic,</p>
<p>we view masks as a political statement.</p>
<p>We would view these aura rings as people being afraid</p>
<p>that the government was going to track them.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll find every good,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll find a lot of excuses in order to blow up</p>
<p>any good idea at this point</p>
<p>because we can politicize anything</p>
<p>and we do it better than any other country in the world.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, it&rsquo;s an interesting point</p>
<p>you make there, and I&rsquo;m gonna go to you in a second, Sax.</p>
<p>If you pull up my computer for a second, Nick,</p>
<p>one thing I cannot understand when I watch the media</p>
<p>or I watch this discussion,</p>
<p>and we haven&rsquo;t seen Dr. Fauci in about 60 days,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where they buried him,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s been put in a bunker somewhere,</p>
<p>but the number of deaths in the United States</p>
<p>continues to go down massively.</p>
<p>Now, I know New York was a big outbreak</p>
<p>and that contributes to it,</p>
<p>if you look and you compare deaths to new cases,</p>
<p>you know, the new cases has increased in some regions</p>
<p>and testing has gone way up.</p>
<p>So in trying to interpret this data,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why there&rsquo;s not somebody saying,</p>
<p>listen, here&rsquo;s the good news, deaths are going way down,</p>
<p>testing is going way up,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s what we should take from that.</p>
<p>Sax, I think you and I might be slightly different sides</p>
<p>of the aisle when it comes to politics.</p>
<p>How do you look at this in terms of leadership</p>
<p>at a federal level and then the media</p>
<p>and how, you know, to Chamath&rsquo;s point, we politicize this?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I agree that things get overly politicized</p>
<p>and mass is a really good example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a really common sense, easy solution.</p>
<p>You know, I wrote a blog that we covered on this pod</p>
<p>two and a half months ago,</p>
<p>saying that I thought mass should be,</p>
<p>public mass wearing should be policy.</p>
<p>You know, it should be the law.</p>
<p>Little did I know that I was taking a left-wing position.</p>
<p>Yeah, oops.</p>
<p>Did you lose any friends over that?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Is Peter Thiel still talking to you?</p>
<p>I mean, I know you guys have me on the show</p>
<p>as the token right winger,</p>
<p>but actually I just appeared at CNN,</p>
<p>just asked me to be on the show today</p>
<p>to explain why mass should be policy.</p>
<p>So I just thought that was a common sense thing.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m normally very receptive</p>
<p>to libertarian arguments,</p>
<p>but, you know, like we talked about,</p>
<p>the boundaries of libertarianism are, you know,</p>
<p>you only have the freedom to wave your arms</p>
<p>until your fist hits my nose, you know?</p>
<p>And something similar is true</p>
<p>about when your infectious particles hit my nose.</p>
<p>You know, there are reasonable boundaries to freedom there</p>
<p>in the interest of other people&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>And, you know, that blog,</p>
<p>a lot of public pronouncements about COVID</p>
<p>have not aged very well over the last couple of months.</p>
<p>I think that blog actually has aged pretty well</p>
<p>by comparison, because you just look at all the countries</p>
<p>that have been successful at fighting COVID.</p>
<p>I mean, Japan has 135 million people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an old population,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve had under a thousand deaths.</p>
<p>South Korea, 51 million people, under 300 deaths.</p>
<p>You take a Western European nation like Czech Republic,</p>
<p>they had a huge COVID outbreak,</p>
<p>it spiked just like the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>They went all in on mask-wearing,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve completely controlled the virus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s knocked out.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really crazy to me</p>
<p>that we just can&rsquo;t get on the same page as a country</p>
<p>about something as obvious and easy as mask-wearing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because the left wants to get to the point</p>
<p>that Trump out of office so badly,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re so triggered by him,</p>
<p>and they hate him so much,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s valid or not, we&rsquo;ll leave aside,</p>
<p>that they want to, and then he wants to say no masks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand his motivation.</p>
<p>What do you think Trump is thinking,</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s advising him that he should be anti-mask?</p>
<p>I think somehow it&rsquo;s, for the right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become an act of defiance.</p>
<p>And I understand that to some degree,</p>
<p>because I do think that the lockdowns went on too long.</p>
<p>I think with 2020 hindsight,</p>
<p>we would say that the lockdowns weren&rsquo;t necessary</p>
<p>if we had just gone all in on a mask policy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they did in Japan, right?</p>
<p>And so the problem with kind of the politicians in charge</p>
<p>is that, well, backing up a second,</p>
<p>I think the right policy is to end lockdowns but wear masks.</p>
<p>And the problem with the politicians</p>
<p>is half of them didn&rsquo;t want to end lockdowns,</p>
<p>and the other half didn&rsquo;t want to wear masks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the weird way</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s become this political football.</p>
<p>So Trump was trying to do this as an act of defiance.</p>
<p>What was the left trying to accomplish, do you think?</p>
<p>What would be your cynical or charitable approach</p>
<p>to their reaction to this and locking down so severely?</p>
<p>Well, I think that, what was the purpose of lockdowns?</p>
<p>I think it was the, I think the initial reaction was,</p>
<p>it was based on what happened in Italy, right?</p>
<p>And so in Italy, you kind of had this worst case scenario</p>
<p>where the hospital system got overwhelmed,</p>
<p>tremendous fatality rate from the virus.</p>
<p>And then we started to see the same thing happening</p>
<p>in New York.</p>
<p>And I think locking down briefly in New York</p>
<p>to get a handle on the situation, I think was justified.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, again, with 20-20 hindsight</p>
<p>that we needed to do it anywhere else in the country</p>
<p>if we had instead just worn masks.</p>
<p>Do you think the left, though,</p>
<p>perpetrated a perpetual lockdown?</p>
<p>This is the most cynical view that I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think you hear this often.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of why we do this podcast</p>
<p>is to sort of explore these kind of takes</p>
<p>that you hear on the inside, but not maybe on CNN.</p>
<p>The cynical interpretation was they wanted to keep lockdown</p>
<p>to crash the economy, to make Trump look bad,</p>
<p>to get him out of the office.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s anything valid to that argument?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s certainly possible.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s possible, though,</p>
<p>that the left just kind of underweights,</p>
<p>you know, the economic damage of lockdowns.</p>
<p>You know, I heard a lot of arguments about,</p>
<p>from the left, that if you wanted to end lockdowns,</p>
<p>then you care more about money than lives.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t put a price on a life,</p>
<p>which is literally what we do all the time.</p>
<p>Like insurance, healthcare, we put a price on life.</p>
<p>Free bird.</p>
<p>But I was never in favor of doing nothing.</p>
<p>I mean, I, you know, I was tweeting weeks ago</p>
<p>that we should end lockdowns, but wear a mask.</p>
<p>And so my argument would be, look at Japan.</p>
<p>You do more for lives and the economy</p>
<p>by having a mask policy instead of lockdowns.</p>
<p>Free bird, what&rsquo;s your take on Saks&rsquo; take?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>I mean, I, you know, I&rsquo;m not a great expert</p>
<p>on kind of the politics and, you know,</p>
<p>I can kind of comment on policy, I think,</p>
<p>in terms of what I think is reasonable and not.</p>
<p>I certainly, you know, thought that the lockdowns</p>
<p>were unreasonable in the extent,</p>
<p>but then the problem was they weren&rsquo;t followed,</p>
<p>so they were all for waste.</p>
<p>And, you know, what happened-</p>
<p>So the worst of all, the worst of all outcomes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there wasn&rsquo;t a huge,</p>
<p>like until they actually went into effect,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t a huge amount of debate about this.</p>
<p>It was just like, oh shit,</p>
<p>we better all go into lockdown.</p>
<p>What happens, this is almost like the human conscious</p>
<p>and unconscious mind, like, you know,</p>
<p>the conscious mind rationalizes</p>
<p>what the unconscious already decided to do.</p>
<p>So everyone freaked out.</p>
<p>Everyone had a great deal of fear.</p>
<p>We shut everything down.</p>
<p>And then the left and the right</p>
<p>had their own rationalization after the fact about,</p>
<p>you know, what that meant.</p>
<p>Was it good?</p>
<p>Was it bad?</p>
<p>Did we overreact?</p>
<p>Did we underreact?</p>
<p>Should we have done more?</p>
<p>And so I feel like the narrative is told</p>
<p>a little bit too late here,</p>
<p>where we all kind of like have these commentaries</p>
<p>about left and right politics after the fact.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really meaningful,</p>
<p>to be honest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just almost like, let&rsquo;s fill in the what happened story</p>
<p>with our own point of view based on our tribe</p>
<p>or whatever we sit in.</p>
<p>So Chamath, how do we get out of this now?</p>
<p>Because the deaths are going down.</p>
<p>No, no, no, we&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re out, we&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>The genie is out of the bottle.</p>
<p>Look, the reality is there is not a single country</p>
<p>government that can tolerate future lockdowns</p>
<p>because I think the populations will revolt.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to have to deal with cases</p>
<p>as they crop up.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to have to deal</p>
<p>with infection rates popping up.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;ll have to deal</p>
<p>with this bursty economic landscape.</p>
<p>Today, Apple just announced</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re closing a bunch of stores in a few states.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll reopen them in a few weeks.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re going to be in this sort of start and stop mode</p>
<p>now for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just not possible to ask people now</p>
<p>to go back into any form of quarantine or shelter in place.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Right, and people only do lockdowns</p>
<p>until there&rsquo;s some activity that they want to engage in</p>
<p>that they think is essential, right?</p>
<p>And so you saw with the protests,</p>
<p>if you believe that the civil rights protests are essential,</p>
<p>you believe that you&rsquo;re out of lockdown.</p>
<p>And, you know, and if you want to go to a Trump rally,</p>
<p>you believe that&rsquo;s essential and you&rsquo;re out of lockdown.</p>
<p>And so, you know, so everybody,</p>
<p>and you know, you had the case in Texas</p>
<p>of the woman who wanted to open her haircut salon.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you were never going to get good compliance</p>
<p>with a lockdown plan.</p>
<p>In addition to the damage and destruction it caused,</p>
<p>it was never very effective</p>
<p>because people weren&rsquo;t willing to do it.</p>
<p>And I think the big public policy mistake here</p>
<p>was the politicians squandering their credibility</p>
<p>on lockdowns that were never very feasible.</p>
<p>Instead of just going all in on masks</p>
<p>and it would have been a lot cheaper.</p>
<p>By the way, the other thing is we need to push mask</p>
<p>wearing back into a public health debate.</p>
<p>And, you know, Newsom yesterday, Gavin Newsom,</p>
<p>the governor of California,</p>
<p>basically said masks are not mandatory in California.</p>
<p>The thing is you have to add fines if you don&rsquo;t wear them</p>
<p>where, you know, people can be cited and fined.</p>
<p>And then the other thing, and David, you said this earlier,</p>
<p>is you have to be criminally culpable at some level</p>
<p>if you go out of your way to not wear a mask</p>
<p>and infect somebody.</p>
<p>And there is a bunch of, you know,</p>
<p>case law on how this can be true.</p>
<p>And so I think that, you know,</p>
<p>we need to solve these things</p>
<p>because you need to have good hygiene around mask wearing</p>
<p>and what the consequences are if you choose to not wear one.</p>
<p>Well, you know, Chamath,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting you bring that up.</p>
<p>There have been cases of people</p>
<p>purposely infecting people with the HIV virus</p>
<p>and going to jail for it and being liable for it.</p>
<p>So there is, I think, and I&rsquo;m not a lawyer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Coughing in somebody&rsquo;s face versus having sex with them</p>
<p>when you know you&rsquo;re infected.</p>
<p>What is the difference?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this viral video</p>
<p>of the Karen, which is a slag.</p>
<p>So many Karens these days.</p>
<p>So many Karens.</p>
<p>And Aunt Karen just like got upset</p>
<p>that somebody was calling her out</p>
<p>for not wearing a mask in a cafe</p>
<p>and she literally coughed on the person.</p>
<p>And did you see that video?</p>
<p>How is this person not in jail?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>I think it was in New York, right?</p>
<p>In Brooklyn.</p>
<p>I think it was New York</p>
<p>and the woman didn&rsquo;t know she was being filmed,</p>
<p>but oh my Lord.</p>
<p>I mean, the great thing about the internet right now</p>
<p>is like if anybody basically transgresses,</p>
<p>they are identified in about a nanosecond.</p>
<p>And I mean, I saw that because on the Saturday morning,</p>
<p>she coughed on this person</p>
<p>who was complaining about her not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>And within 15 minutes, they had her LinkedIn,</p>
<p>they had contacted Weill Medical Center where she worked,</p>
<p>and then Weill put out a press release</p>
<p>basically saying we had fired her, you know,</p>
<p>for being a dummy well before the mask thing.</p>
<p>And so the whole thing now just gets so adjudicated</p>
<p>and resolved so quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>We basically moved to Judge Dredd now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the social media is the judge,</p>
<p>the jury, and the cops in this entire equation.</p>
<p>The one that I loved actually,</p>
<p>that really actually, frankly, I look forward to</p>
<p>was the cyclist in Maryland.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, you cannot go after kids</p>
<p>touching another person&rsquo;s child</p>
<p>and women and like attacking them</p>
<p>for putting up, you know, Black Lives Matter posters</p>
<p>like, and then to attack these.</p>
<p>But then again, it was the sub community on Reddit</p>
<p>and it was amazing.</p>
<p>It was the actual like Maryland subreddit.</p>
<p>Who knows what&rsquo;s going on in the Maryland subreddit</p>
<p>on Reddit?</p>
<p>What could they be talking about?</p>
<p>But they identified this guy and he was fired.</p>
<p>He was arrested and it all happened</p>
<p>within, you know, probably 36 hours.</p>
<p>But you guys know in that story,</p>
<p>there was another guy who was identified first</p>
<p>and he was a police officer.</p>
<p>And then people went after him</p>
<p>and he basically had his life ruined</p>
<p>within those first 24 hours and he wasn&rsquo;t the guy.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he wasn&rsquo;t the guy.</p>
<p>The way they got him was the Stravia data, right?</p>
<p>Like he had, they found a guy on Stravia</p>
<p>who had done that.</p>
<p>Strava, Strava, Stravia is the Sweden.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Stevia.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s Stevia.</p>
<p>The guy was using Stevia, the app for the bike people.</p>
<p>And they monetized that app through subscriptions.</p>
<p>Correct?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make fun of my dyslexia, Chamath.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re bullying me on my own podcast.</p>
<p>You say monetize on CNBC in front of millions of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>We tried to teach you how to pronounce that word</p>
<p>for 15 years.</p>
<p>I know, but I say it on purpose now</p>
<p>and I lean into it now.</p>
<p>Monetize.</p>
<p>It sounds slightly pornographic or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, he also, he also, he also mosturbates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go home and mosturbate later.</p>
<p>Okay, go back to your Stevia story.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Wait, so what happened is this guy got in trouble</p>
<p>and this is my point about the problem</p>
<p>with the group think hive mind approach to these issues</p>
<p>is you can end up not,</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t follow a predefined due process</p>
<p>and you let the mob kind of rule over these moments,</p>
<p>bad shit can happen too.</p>
<p>So what happened to the cop?</p>
<p>The cop, everyone started chasing him down</p>
<p>and his whole life got ruined.</p>
<p>Everyone was like death threats and fucking with him</p>
<p>and all this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Calling his employer, calling people who know him.</p>
<p>But they found his phone number, they found his address.</p>
<p>They doxed him.</p>
<p>Got turned upside down.</p>
<p>Yeah, but basically the fact that they found out</p>
<p>that it was someone else doesn&rsquo;t resolve the fact</p>
<p>that there are now hundreds of people after this guy</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t pay attention and that it wasn&rsquo;t him.</p>
<p>And due process has a role in a civilized society</p>
<p>where you can actually create structure</p>
<p>and resolve these things in a proper way</p>
<p>as opposed to letting mob mentality kind of rule.</p>
<p>I mean, otherwise this stuff can get pretty ugly pretty fast</p>
<p>as we saw this being just a really pretty lightweight example</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of this</p>
<p>like chase the guy down and then punish him at once</p>
<p>and cancel culture is a little bit ugly right now</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have all the facts</p>
<p>and you miss stuff in a lot of these cases.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is definitely,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great that you can find criminals so quickly</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m curious what people think</p>
<p>and obviously you just don&rsquo;t wanna mistarget somebody</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s, if you do find somebody who&rsquo;s targeted</p>
<p>like give the information to the authorities</p>
<p>but you may not want to dox them immediately</p>
<p>and try to ruin their lives</p>
<p>before you actually know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>A lot of companies now, Microsoft, IBM and others,</p>
<p>Amazon I think are saying we don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna take a pause on facial recognition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious what each of your thoughts are</p>
<p>on law enforcement and we&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>the law enforcement discussion</p>
<p>and race relations here in this country</p>
<p>and what we went through.</p>
<p>We, look, we have been arming our police force</p>
<p>mistakenly like our military</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been doing it for decades now</p>
<p>and it makes no sense.</p>
<p>There is this crazy tweet I saw today,</p>
<p>maybe we can find AOC tweeted out</p>
<p>where she found this announcement</p>
<p>from some like long tail police department somewhere</p>
<p>who basically got a free armored truck carrier</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re driving it around town or whatever,</p>
<p>pulling it out of the garage.</p>
<p>It looks like downtown Baghdad</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, I mean, they&rsquo;re in like Fargo, North Dakota</p>
<p>wherever they are.</p>
<p>I mean, like it&rsquo;s just so, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of us thought</p>
<p>that we wanted to apportion our tax dollars</p>
<p>to build a second shadow army.</p>
<p>I think we all want an army and a Navy</p>
<p>and a Marines and an Air Force.</p>
<p>We want aircraft carriers and F-16s</p>
<p>and tanks and machine guns and all that stuff,</p>
<p>but we want them with our military.</p>
<p>And then we want cops, I think,</p>
<p>to be extremely well-trained.</p>
<p>I mean, half the time, cops are,</p>
<p>you ask them to be mental health counselors.</p>
<p>Other times you&rsquo;re asking them to be CPR givers.</p>
<p>Other times you&rsquo;re asking them to be criminal apprehenders.</p>
<p>The job is too complicated.</p>
<p>They clearly can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re poorly trained.</p>
<p>And then you arm them on top of all of that</p>
<p>and you have the shit show that we have today.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s an IED waiting somewhere</p>
<p>for them to drive over where they need metal plating</p>
<p>on the bottom of the vehicle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re dealing with every day.</p>
<p>At a minimum, let&rsquo;s like, look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of ending qualified immunity.</p>
<p>I think that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>I think we have to stop arming our police</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re military.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t train them like the military.</p>
<p>Train them like a different kind of service.</p>
<p>And we may need to go back to first principles</p>
<p>to figure out how to actually train them properly,</p>
<p>to spot abuse, to deal with mental health,</p>
<p>and just to be a little bit more patient</p>
<p>and understanding and empathetic versus trigger happy.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question on that?</p>
<p>So a lot of the actions that police take</p>
<p>when it comes to lethal action is defended by the notion</p>
<p>that my life was under threat as a cop.</p>
<p>And that sources from the fact</p>
<p>that we have a second amendment in this country</p>
<p>where a lot of people are gun carriers</p>
<p>and are allowed to have arms.</p>
<p>So our police force has had to respond</p>
<p>with the fact that there are a lot of guns in this country</p>
<p>with defensive principles and defensive mechanisms</p>
<p>to defend themselves against the loss of life due to a gun.</p>
<p>And that makes the United States really unique</p>
<p>in terms of the circumstance</p>
<p>versus if you look at the United Kingdom</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t have a second amendment right</p>
<p>to bear arms, the police aren&rsquo;t armed</p>
<p>and the police behavior is significantly different.</p>
<p>You can look at this in any country</p>
<p>where there isn&rsquo;t a right to bear arms.</p>
<p>Do we not have a fundamental problem in this country</p>
<p>that stems from the fact that the police feel</p>
<p>or can justify that they&rsquo;re always under threat</p>
<p>of loss of life due to arms being out in the population?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fabulous question.</p>
<p>The contra example I would say is if you look at Switzerland</p>
<p>where the per capita gun ownership is really high,</p>
<p>Canada where per capita gun ownership is really high,</p>
<p>what I would tell you is there&rsquo;s a different kind</p>
<p>of psychological training that police people go through</p>
<p>before they&rsquo;re put on the streets.</p>
<p>And that is fundamentally different here.</p>
<p>The job as defined to them here is different</p>
<p>than it is in Canada or Switzerland</p>
<p>where gun ownership levels are quite robust.</p>
<p>And I think it all comes down to incentives.</p>
<p>And the reality is that there is a, to your point, David,</p>
<p>this amplification of this idea that everybody is armed,</p>
<p>which I think is fundamentally mostly not true</p>
<p>in the day-to-day course of like living one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>But I think police people tend to be very amplified</p>
<p>around that threat.</p>
<p>And as a result, the unions have basically written contracts</p>
<p>that protect their use of force.</p>
<p>The law is written in a way that protects</p>
<p>their use of force.</p>
<p>And so all of it comes from, to your point,</p>
<p>a defensive posture of fear.</p>
<p>But if you actually tried to train these people differently,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d have a different outcome</p>
<p>because what I can tell you is the police in Canada</p>
<p>do behave differently.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t reach for their gun every second.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interest.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a very interesting example.</p>
<p>And I know we don&rsquo;t wanna like just take</p>
<p>one anecdotal incident and then, you know,</p>
<p>make a big sweeping generalization with it.</p>
<p>But if you look at the gentleman in Atlanta</p>
<p>who was shot in the back twice, Rashid Brooks,</p>
<p>Rashard Brooks.</p>
<p>Rashard Brooks.</p>
<p>Rashard Brooks.</p>
<p>This example to me is so illustrative of the problem.</p>
<p>They spent 40 minutes talking with this individual</p>
<p>who was absolutely not a threat.</p>
<p>They had frisked him.</p>
<p>They knew he was not armed.</p>
<p>He was intoxicated.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in a drive-thru.</p>
<p>Of all the ways you could have dealt with this situation.</p>
<p>And I come from a family of police officers</p>
<p>and I can tell you a lot of stories about cops</p>
<p>letting people go, obviously white people with warnings.</p>
<p>In this situation, letting him sleep it off,</p>
<p>taking his keys, letting him run away.</p>
<p>You know who it is.</p>
<p>You have his driver&rsquo;s license, you have his car,</p>
<p>you have his keys, let him run away.</p>
<p>Under what circumstances would you feel justified</p>
<p>shooting a person when there were so many other options?</p>
<p>And it comes exactly, I believe, Chamath from</p>
<p>two things you pointed out.</p>
<p>One, they&rsquo;re in a very defensive position</p>
<p>and two, the training.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trained to use lethal force</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re in a situation where you feel threatened,</p>
<p>you just shoot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And if you shoot, you shoot to the center of the body</p>
<p>to kill the person.</p>
<p>And in their training, they&rsquo;re not trained to think,</p>
<p>how do I disarm the situation, diffuse the situation</p>
<p>and what are the other options?</p>
<p>This person is obviously not a threat</p>
<p>and you knew the taser was fired twice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the person should have resisted arrest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the person shouldn&rsquo;t have aimed</p>
<p>the taser at the person.</p>
<p>But they should be trained to protect life</p>
<p>and diffuse situations at all costs.</p>
<p>Jason, think about the incentives.</p>
<p>They should have been trained maybe to just walk</p>
<p>into the Wendy&rsquo;s, buy this guy a coffee</p>
<p>and then drive him to the motel that he said</p>
<p>that he was staying at.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or they should have been trained to just write a ticket</p>
<p>and say, listen, here&rsquo;s a citation for being drunk</p>
<p>because you did technically kind of drive</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m going to leave it alone.</p>
<p>They could have done many things that they chose not to do</p>
<p>because the incentive was to project power</p>
<p>in that situation versus project any kind of empathy</p>
<p>and compassion.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the selection of people who go into the police</p>
<p>department and I come from a family of police officers</p>
<p>and firefighters.</p>
<p>Brother, uncle, cousin, grandfather, up and down the line,</p>
<p>Irish cops and firefighters, big tradition in my family.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that there is a contingent of people</p>
<p>who go into the police who are power tripping</p>
<p>or maybe didn&rsquo;t get wherever else they wanted to be in life</p>
<p>and the job of seeing people and dealing with the bad stuff</p>
<p>that you pointed out, people in domestic violence situations,</p>
<p>people who are mentally ill, homeless, addiction problems,</p>
<p>all of that then trains these people to see the worst</p>
<p>in humanity and then they just look at their job</p>
<p>as just this dystopian, horrible experience</p>
<p>and they are in that defensive posture.</p>
<p>Whereas we need to train people and I made this tweet</p>
<p>where we should have a new class of police officer</p>
<p>that is more like a Jedi Knight.</p>
<p>You know, they get paid twice as much,</p>
<p>they have master&rsquo;s degree in social work or psychology</p>
<p>and when that call comes in</p>
<p>for an emotionally disturbed person,</p>
<p>a person who&rsquo;s intoxicated or on drugs,</p>
<p>a domestic violence situation,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna send the average B cop to that,</p>
<p>you wanna send the Jedi.</p>
<p>No, but Jason, make it even easier.</p>
<p>Like when you go in and get a 911 call</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you know, there could be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s in sort of like mental distress</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna do a mental health check,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you send a really well-trained social worker?</p>
<p>Absolutely, and the reason is-</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have a whole, you know,</p>
<p>a whole force of social workers</p>
<p>that we pay $100,000 a year?</p>
<p>Absolutely, and that&rsquo;s what these police officers are making.</p>
<p>There is an argument to not have them armed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an argument for them to be armed</p>
<p>but maybe they&rsquo;re so enlightened and trained so well.</p>
<p>I think the training in the United States</p>
<p>is in the low hundreds of hours.</p>
<p>In other countries, it&rsquo;s thousands of hours.</p>
<p>I mean, if a person has a gun,</p>
<p>I think police should not get their gun</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;ve completed maybe two or 3,000 hours on the job.</p>
<p>In other words, they get to their second or third year.</p>
<p>So the first year when you&rsquo;re a probie,</p>
<p>why even have a gun?</p>
<p>Why not just have them doing things without a gun?</p>
<p>And then when you get that gun,</p>
<p>maybe you need to have the equivalent of a master&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>You know, maybe you need to have a level of training</p>
<p>and we need to go to first principles,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re saying, Chamath, and rethink this whole thing.</p>
<p>In any startup or any problem solving,</p>
<p>you would look at the, show me the thousand calls,</p>
<p>how did they break down, what were the outcomes?</p>
<p>And if you look at the outcomes</p>
<p>of dealing with mentally ill people</p>
<p>or people who are addiction or domestic disputes,</p>
<p>the outcomes are things that police are not trained for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gotta be a very high percentage of these situations,</p>
<p>let alone the no knock warrant,</p>
<p>which makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s just a lot of,</p>
<p>look, there&rsquo;s a lot of change coming.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of legislation afoot</p>
<p>at every sort of level of government.</p>
<p>And I think the good news is that it&rsquo;s going to be hard</p>
<p>for people to sit on their hands on this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be universally across the country,</p>
<p>but I do think that people will then, again,</p>
<p>self-select and wanna live in places where,</p>
<p>sort of like the laws match their ideals,</p>
<p>and this is gonna be an area</p>
<p>of tremendous reform and change.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about all of this is like,</p>
<p>if you actually go back to the Republican ideology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting to me why Republicans aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the first ones to try to embrace rewriting</p>
<p>the union contracts and actually decreasing unionized power,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>has generally been a tent hole theme of Republican ideology.</p>
<p>But then as it gets applied to cops,</p>
<p>I think they kind of just abdicate responsibility.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons where you could have</p>
<p>bipartisan agreement on a bunch of these things.</p>
<p>But again, I think we kind of like get caught up</p>
<p>and we refuse to see the forest from the trees</p>
<p>and wanna fix these things.</p>
<p>But I suspect that a lot of these changes will happen</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re so bloody obvious.</p>
<p>And depending on your ideology,</p>
<p>you can frame the same reason</p>
<p>for completely different motives</p>
<p>and get to the same answer.</p>
<p>Nobody wants this.</p>
<p>Sax, what do you think about the union issue</p>
<p>as our token right winger?</p>
<p>I think, yeah, I think the police unions</p>
<p>have too much power.</p>
<p>All the public employee unions do.</p>
<p>I think, just like the teacher&rsquo;s unions</p>
<p>have thwarted school choice and education reform,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re seeing the police unions</p>
<p>thwart a lot of sensible reforms around the use of force.</p>
<p>Our friend Bill Gurley has been tweeting</p>
<p>a lot of great research</p>
<p>around police departments that are unionized.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more complaints against them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more examples of the use of force</p>
<p>and unwarranted use of force.</p>
<p>And so clearly there&rsquo;s a connection here</p>
<p>between police unions</p>
<p>and the thwarting of common sense reforms.</p>
<p>And I saw someone tweeted this idea</p>
<p>that the reason why no one&rsquo;s taking on the police unions</p>
<p>is because Republicans see the word police</p>
<p>and Democrats see the word union,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both fans of those things.</p>
<p>And so who&rsquo;s gonna take them on?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, teacher&rsquo;s unions is the same thing.</p>
<p>And the political system,</p>
<p>the political power of the unions is so entrenched</p>
<p>that in order to get in office, in most cases,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need to have the support of those unions.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re going to tell people</p>
<p>explicitly not to vote for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, well, look, I mean,</p>
<p>you look at the cities</p>
<p>that have had the biggest problems here.</p>
<p>I mean, starting with Minneapolis,</p>
<p>and these are Democrat-controlled cities.</p>
<p>These are not Republican-controlled cities.</p>
<p>And the politicians are very much in cahoots</p>
<p>with the big unions there,</p>
<p>including the police and the teacher&rsquo;s unions and all that.</p>
<p>And so both parties need to be open to reform.</p>
<p>To your point, David,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a story that came out last couple of days</p>
<p>about the DA in Atlanta</p>
<p>who pressed charges against the two officers.</p>
<p>But the narrative was about how the DA is being investigated</p>
<p>for getting 140K in kickbacks</p>
<p>from a nonprofit tied to something.</p>
<p>And then he was claiming that his main opponent,</p>
<p>because these district attorneys</p>
<p>are politically elected officials, right?</p>
<p>Where she had basically done a side deal with the police</p>
<p>to not go after use of force in return for their endorsement.</p>
<p>And what a horribly messy, complicated, gross situation,</p>
<p>irrespective of whoever turns out to be right there.</p>
<p>So to your point, they&rsquo;ve become so entrenched</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just so low level</p>
<p>that then what should be obvious justice</p>
<p>basically just gets thrown away</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s expedient and convenient.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, this is another example where like with the mass,</p>
<p>I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t violating conservative principles.</p>
<p>I thought there really was a conservative principle.</p>
<p>And I think with this example</p>
<p>of the overuse of force by police,</p>
<p>you go back to what Lord Acton said,</p>
<p>which is power corrupts and absolute power corrupts,</p>
<p>absolutely.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s no one standing up to the police unions,</p>
<p>politically, they have absolute power</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna lead to corruption.</p>
<p>So I do think like Republicans should be looking into this.</p>
<p>Now, I think part of the reason why</p>
<p>Republicans wanna defend the police</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;ve also had these examples</p>
<p>of looting and rioting and lawlessness,</p>
<p>after the civil rights protests.</p>
<p>And I think that, again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of dividing up into sides</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s too much justification of bad behavior</p>
<p>on both sides because of what the other side is doing.</p>
<p>And I heard people on the left justifying</p>
<p>the looting and rioting on the grounds that,</p>
<p>it was a legitimate expression of opposition.</p>
<p>It was a legitimate protest,</p>
<p>it was a legitimate expression of opposition</p>
<p>to the police violence.</p>
<p>And I think that that is wrong.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s wrong for people on the right</p>
<p>to defend this police,</p>
<p>the successive use of force by police</p>
<p>on the grounds that somehow it&rsquo;s justified</p>
<p>because we need to control the lawlessness and the rioting.</p>
<p>And I think both are wrong.</p>
<p>And we lack a federal leadership</p>
<p>to not make this overly political,</p>
<p>but when Trump then tear gases with the military protesters</p>
<p>to go do a photo opportunity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sending the message that he wants</p>
<p>to be the law and order president.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re just charging things up</p>
<p>instead of just going on TV</p>
<p>and just saying something to bring people back</p>
<p>to the concept that we&rsquo;re all Americans,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all in this together and we rise and fall together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an easy statement.</p>
<p>Listen, the protesters have valid concerns.</p>
<p>We need to work on this issue.</p>
<p>And yes, if you see people doing any vandalism,</p>
<p>we have to stop them.</p>
<p>Please make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>because it works against the very valid criticism</p>
<p>and protests that are going on that need to go on.</p>
<p>And the fact that the president can&rsquo;t say that is crazy.</p>
<p>Well, what do you guys think about what he has been saying</p>
<p>and how Twitter and Facebook</p>
<p>have basically taken different sides of-</p>
<p>Freeberg, go ahead.</p>
<p>What Trump&rsquo;s been saying?</p>
<p>Yeah, should Twitter be censoring him</p>
<p>slash putting warnings on his posts</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s saying crazy stuff?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I mean, it&rsquo;s such a slippery slope</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s too much room for interpretation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying the obvious,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re a platform, you&rsquo;re a platform.</p>
<p>You let the things get built on top of you.</p>
<p>Sure, you can have some rules around what can be built,</p>
<p>but as soon as you start saying what is true</p>
<p>and what is not true and you become the arbiter of truth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re no longer an agnostic platform.</p>
<p>And I think that is a big, dangerous risk to take</p>
<p>because as you guys know, something maybe,</p>
<p>and I think we saw this with the,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that Twitter account, Zero Hedge?</p>
<p>Was that the name of it? Zero Hedge.</p>
<p>That got banned.</p>
<p>And then they came back because it turns out</p>
<p>what they said wasn&rsquo;t necessarily as untrue</p>
<p>as Twitter at first thought</p>
<p>that they were saying was untrue.</p>
<p>So it was a great example of how a point of interpretation</p>
<p>can very quickly kind of reverse course</p>
<p>and you can look extremely biased</p>
<p>in making that decision at that time.</p>
<p>Well, and YouTube took, I think Susan Wojcicki took the,</p>
<p>Wojcicki took the position at YouTube</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to allow people to talk about coronavirus</p>
<p>if what they&rsquo;re saying is in sync</p>
<p>with the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Yeah, and by the way, the World Health Organization,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had an issue with since well before COVID,</p>
<p>just from another life, they, I won&rsquo;t get into it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve said some stuff publicly</p>
<p>that was just flat out fucking wrong scientifically</p>
<p>and invalid and it was politicized.</p>
<p>And we kind of got to the root</p>
<p>of the political driver behind it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve long held kind of disbelief</p>
<p>in the World Health Organization</p>
<p>as a trusted source of scientific fact.</p>
<p>And to Sax&rsquo;s previous point,</p>
<p>you want to be able to check power.</p>
<p>And if the World Health Organization</p>
<p>is this incredibly powerful organization</p>
<p>who got it wrong with masks and didn&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>you know, like David Sax is getting it right,</p>
<p>some venture capitalist in the Bay Area</p>
<p>gets it right about masks</p>
<p>and the World Health Organization gets it wrong?</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s in Mexico, but yeah.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>Undisclosed location in Mexico.</p>
<p>But okay, Sax, should they be putting labels</p>
<p>and warnings on politicians</p>
<p>when they say things that are consensus wrong?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, call me old fashioned,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very much in favor of free speech</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m against censorship.</p>
<p>And, you know, fact-checking your politicians</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like is basically bias.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s soft censorship.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re being very selective</p>
<p>in who they decide to fact-check</p>
<p>and, you know, there&rsquo;s no good way to do it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there is no truth API</p>
<p>that they can just plug in to fact-check people.</p>
<p>The way that you deal with bad speech is more speech.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a line from Justice Brandeis.</p>
<p>That is the way historically that we have,</p>
<p>in this country, that we&rsquo;ve dealt with speech</p>
<p>by people we don&rsquo;t like, which is you have more speech.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think censorship or warnings</p>
<p>is the right way to go.</p>
<p>Chamath, what do you think having worked at Facebook?</p>
<p>Look, I think it exposes a couple of things.</p>
<p>One is that the Twitter product is still relatively brittle.</p>
<p>I mean, like at least Facebook has a whole suite</p>
<p>of emoticons to say something is a crock of shit,</p>
<p>you know, and it makes you feel bad</p>
<p>or, you know, it makes you feel angry</p>
<p>or thumbs down or whatever.</p>
<p>And so Twitter&rsquo;s reactionary feedback mechanism</p>
<p>to its algorithms is very brittle.</p>
<p>And so if you were gonna try to algorithmically</p>
<p>tune down the distribution of, you know, a Trump tweet,</p>
<p>you know, you could see where you could balance</p>
<p>thumbs up or hearts in this case</p>
<p>with other ways of signaling that this is either wrong</p>
<p>or hate-filled or, you know, instigating.</p>
<p>And I think like a little bit more self-policing</p>
<p>is probably the only scalable solution.</p>
<p>All of that said, here&rsquo;s what I will say.</p>
<p>I think basically that Facebook is becoming middle America</p>
<p>and Twitter is becoming sort of the coasts.</p>
<p>And, you know, Facebook is basically a product</p>
<p>of middle America plus kind of like countries</p>
<p>outside the United States and, you know,</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s about, you know, rich coastal kind of people.</p>
<p>And you can see that the way that the content ebbs</p>
<p>and flows and, you know, the kind of content problems,</p>
<p>like just for an example, you know,</p>
<p>what is Twitter&rsquo;s latest content problem?</p>
<p>It was that Donald Trump tweeted a video from CNN</p>
<p>that was doctored, you know, and it only showed a clip</p>
<p>of a, you know, a black toddler running away</p>
<p>from a white toddler.</p>
<p>And the caption was, you know,</p>
<p>the chyron said something about racism.</p>
<p>It turned out to not be wrong, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>What is Facebook&rsquo;s issue two days ago?</p>
<p>It was that, you know, the Boogaloo movement,</p>
<p>which is, you know, a bunch of people who believe</p>
<p>in a militia and an impending civil war</p>
<p>principally use Facebook and Facebook groups to organize.</p>
<p>And they found out that they were distributing</p>
<p>and, you know, driving, you know,</p>
<p>viewers and usage and content.</p>
<p>So it just kind of tells you like,</p>
<p>and if you break down the issues and, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple of people who tweet out</p>
<p>the most popular tweets on Twitter</p>
<p>versus the most popular content on Facebook,</p>
<p>what you see is a left and right distribution.</p>
<p>And so I think that the audiences</p>
<p>are segregating themselves into using products</p>
<p>that basically feed them what they want to hear.</p>
<p>Well, Chamath, let me ask you a question</p>
<p>about the leadership.</p>
<p>You work directly with Zuckerberg for many years,</p>
<p>and we all know Jack from Twitter, from various projects.</p>
<p>What is Zuckerberg&rsquo;s politics?</p>
<p>Is he a secret Trump supporter?</p>
<p>Does Peter Thiel, who&rsquo;s on the board,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re good friends with Peter Thiel</p>
<p>and worked with Peter Thiel Sachs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious what you think goes on inside the brain</p>
<p>of Mark Zuckerberg in terms of making these decisions.</p>
<p>Is he scared that Facebook has become dependent</p>
<p>on the right, and is that, Chamath,</p>
<p>that it is a right thing?</p>
<p>And is he right or left?</p>
<p>What is his politics?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right framing.</p>
<p>I think that if you&rsquo;re running a big network like this,</p>
<p>you have to remember the, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the five or six most valuable companies</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>You yourself have, you know, 50, 60, $70 billion.</p>
<p>Basically, the world is your oyster.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ve seen over the last five or six years</p>
<p>is that there is an increasing regulatory headwind.</p>
<p>And if you basically play the game theory out,</p>
<p>you know, these companies are gonna get regulated</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna get overtaxed,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna get kind of slowed down at a minimum</p>
<p>and broken up at the maximum.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re running one of these companies,</p>
<p>I think the only thing you can do is hold on.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re gonna hold on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no point in making any of these changes</p>
<p>because it minimizes the amount of cash you can make</p>
<p>and the amount of, you know, support you&rsquo;ll have.</p>
<p>So you might as well pick a side effectively</p>
<p>by doing nothing and waiting.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s largely</p>
<p>what all these guys have decided to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve essentially said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna sort of take a side here.</p>
<p>Well, no, Twitter has taken a side.</p>
<p>Twitter has.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re small enough.</p>
<p>They can survive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to get broken up.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re one of the top four or five,</p>
<p>look at the position they&rsquo;ve taken.</p>
<p>The position they&rsquo;ve taken is we have no position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Facebook&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>We have no position.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna police ads.</p>
<p>No, hold on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also Google&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also Microsoft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also Apple&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also Amazon&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And in fairness to Facebook,</p>
<p>all big five tech companies have said,</p>
<p>our position is no position.</p>
<p>And the reason is because that&rsquo;s the only thing they can do</p>
<p>to keep that market cap</p>
<p>and to hold on to the economic vibrancy</p>
<p>of their businesses for longer.</p>
<p>Sax, why did Twitter and Jack actually take a position?</p>
<p>Because this cannot happen</p>
<p>if Jack is not 100% supportive of it.</p>
<p>He is the driver of it and the person who okays it.</p>
<p>And then what do you think Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>Chamath didn&rsquo;t want to answer this,</p>
<p>but I want you to try to answer it.</p>
<p>What is Zuckerberg&rsquo;s relationship with Peter Thiel</p>
<p>and his thinking on a political basis in your mind,</p>
<p>without giving up your relationship with Peter,</p>
<p>but what is his politics and what is their relationship?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what Zuck&rsquo;s politics are,</p>
<p>or not even exactly.</p>
<p>I have no idea what his politics are, not remotely.</p>
<p>And I do remember the time</p>
<p>when Peter supported Trump during the election</p>
<p>and the rest of the board wanted to run him off the board.</p>
<p>So clearly it&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>I highly doubt Facebook is a bastion of right-wing thinking.</p>
<p>But why would Zuckerberg keep him on the board then</p>
<p>in defiance of everybody else who hates him?</p>
<p>Maybe he simply believes that supporting</p>
<p>the Republican candidate in a presidential election</p>
<p>is not grounds for removal from a board.</p>
<p>Maybe he simply is not that intolerant.</p>
<p>I think, I mean, I&rsquo;m gonna actually go out on a limb here</p>
<p>and defend Zuckerberg a little bit,</p>
<p>which is my impression of what Zuckerberg&rsquo;s trying to do</p>
<p>is simply maintain Facebook as a speech platform.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re gonna be a speech platform,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be caught in the crosshairs</p>
<p>of all these very controversial debates.</p>
<p>And people are gonna publish things that other people hate.</p>
<p>In fact, even that the majority hates.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that the type of speech</p>
<p>that the ACLU historically defended?</p>
<p>It feels to me like there&rsquo;s been a rise</p>
<p>mainly on the left in terms of intolerance</p>
<p>for speech they don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>that they consider to be-</p>
<p>Well, 100%.</p>
<p>Insufficiently what, yeah.</p>
<p>You saw that with the New York Times newsroom.</p>
<p>I think you tweeted a tweet storm</p>
<p>from an opinion writer there.</p>
<p>It was around the Tom Cotton editorial,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s not like I agreed with it,</p>
<p>but they basically fired the opinion page editor</p>
<p>because they realized they published-</p>
<p>And by the way, sorry, just to build on your point,</p>
<p>the title, which wasn&rsquo;t even written by Tom Cotton,</p>
<p>was, I would say, an order of magnitude worse</p>
<p>than the article, if you read the whole article.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But the title was really offensive.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even written by them.</p>
<p>It was written, I think, by the editor that got fired.</p>
<p>But the article itself is kind of bad,</p>
<p>but not nearly as bad as the title,</p>
<p>which he didn&rsquo;t write.</p>
<p>Ms. Freeberg, 20 years ago,</p>
<p>when we were all, as Gen Xers coming up,</p>
<p>we were taught to defend freedom of speech</p>
<p>as a core tenant of a vibrant democracy,</p>
<p>and that you need to be able to read unpopular opinions.</p>
<p>In fact, the KKK needs to be able</p>
<p>to march down Main Street,</p>
<p>and we need to protect that ugly speech</p>
<p>in order for everybody else to have it.</p>
<p>And here we have an editorial,</p>
<p>which obviously none of us agree with.</p>
<p>Is this an existential threat to America</p>
<p>that we are now going to say freedom of speech</p>
<p>is not a core tenant of the American experiment?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just looking for the term that was used by,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the other New York Times opinion writer?</p>
<p>I forgot her name, Sachs.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll help me,</p>
<p>but she talks about like a comfort culture.</p>
<p>So basically, we used to pride ourselves</p>
<p>on a culture that enabled freedom of speech,</p>
<p>and that was cherished and heralded.</p>
<p>And what is cherished and heralded now</p>
<p>is a culture that protects people</p>
<p>from hearing offensive and scary things</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t wanna hear.</p>
<p>And that shift, those of us who are Gen X,</p>
<p>which I think I am, I was born in 1980,</p>
<p>into the millennial Gen Z</p>
<p>and beyond kind of generation has occurred.</p>
<p>And it is fundamentally changing the nature</p>
<p>of how we find truth and how we find,</p>
<p>coalesce around decisions as a society.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re excluding the things that are offensive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little bit scary to think about</p>
<p>from my point of view that we can&rsquo;t explore all options.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t hear all dissenting points of view.</p>
<p>This is certainly a very deep argument</p>
<p>about how our society and how our democracy operates,</p>
<p>but it is happening.</p>
<p>And so the point was like,</p>
<p>we are starting to shift towards valuing comfort</p>
<p>over freedom of expression.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just kind of the big change that&rsquo;s occurring.</p>
<p>And look, we do live in a democracy.</p>
<p>So the votes are gonna be what ultimately decides</p>
<p>what happens here.</p>
<p>Votes in terms of who&rsquo;s using Facebook versus Twitter</p>
<p>and votes in terms of who&rsquo;s voting</p>
<p>for what presidential candidate</p>
<p>and what governor and what mayor.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sea change in how this democracy operates.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a sea change going back very far</p>
<p>because the whole principle of the enlightenment</p>
<p>going back hundreds of years was stated by Voltaire,</p>
<p>which is that I may disagree with what you have to say,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll defend to the death your right to say it.</p>
<p>Who today is willing to do that?</p>
<p>I mean, that was the idea that led</p>
<p>to political liberalization in the West.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a unique feature</p>
<p>of Western democracies and liberalism.</p>
<p>You go to anywhere else in the world,</p>
<p>I guarantee you people aren&rsquo;t defending to the death</p>
<p>your right to say things they disagree with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin is defending</p>
<p>your right to hear things that they don&rsquo;t want you to.</p>
<p>So this is a very foundational part of American</p>
<p>and Western political liberalism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s being challenged now.</p>
<p>And I think we should have more self-confidence</p>
<p>in our ideas to worry so much about Donald Trump&rsquo;s tweets,</p>
<p>which are ephemeral and will be forgotten very soon,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re willing to throw out freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, this is the thing I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>about labeling his tweets is you know,</p>
<p>I mean, does anybody not think that this guy</p>
<p>is hopped up on Adderall or a complete moron?</p>
<p>Like, or any of those things?</p>
<p>We all know he&rsquo;s an idiot who just tweets 50 times a day</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just scared, you know,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not gonna win his re-election</p>
<p>and that he&rsquo;s a literal reality star.</p>
<p>So who do you mean by when you say we, we all?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a different we that I think you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that I think other people would be saying we represent.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, that&rsquo;s I think the generational divide here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s generational.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of dimensions across</p>
<p>which these differences of perspective occur.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said this for amongst our group for a long time,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a huge difference between a rural population</p>
<p>and urban population in the United States</p>
<p>in terms of what their priorities are.</p>
<p>And I think that difference in priorities is unconscious.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where things really resonate that Trump says,</p>
<p>and that really moved the needle for a lot of folks.</p>
<p>The priority of civil rights is not,</p>
<p>as it might be in an urban center,</p>
<p>is not a priority in a rural center.</p>
<p>And in a rural population, there&rsquo;s a different priority.</p>
<p>Trump, no matter what, how he says it,</p>
<p>the things he&rsquo;s saying are different</p>
<p>than what I&rsquo;m hearing from the urban population,</p>
<p>which is where the media comes from,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And so Trump resonates with me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if he sounds a little bit wacky.</p>
<p>I need wacky because it needs to be different than standard.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s a lot of divides here</p>
<p>and a lot of dimensions across.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that we absolutely should not</p>
<p>throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
<p>We should never attack this very basic principle</p>
<p>of free speech because we will never</p>
<p>forgive ourselves if we do.</p>
<p>But then this is why I think we come back to,</p>
<p>we should be a little bit more resilient</p>
<p>to build products and services</p>
<p>that allow a little bit more texture in the discussion</p>
<p>so that you actually can have free speech flourish more</p>
<p>in a more transparent way.</p>
<p>So David, to your point, how do you drown out hate speech?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with more speech.</p>
<p>Well, these products don&rsquo;t necessarily even enable that.</p>
<p>And so I do think that we have this sort of an issue</p>
<p>where the products and services that billions of people use</p>
<p>to consume their information</p>
<p>and construct a worldview today,</p>
<p>they neither will allow things to be flagged,</p>
<p>nor will they increment the feature surface area</p>
<p>so that you can actually have.</p>
<p>So then that&rsquo;s why I think people then get</p>
<p>into this place where everybody feels cornered</p>
<p>and nobody likes what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s kind of what we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>I think that if we had a little bit more ingenuity</p>
<p>and thinking by the folks at Twitter and Facebook,</p>
<p>it would go a long, long way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do think there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>I mean, the conundrum of Twitter is simultaneously,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the main way I get my news information,</p>
<p>but I also see it as a huge source of groupthink</p>
<p>and kind of mob mentality.</p>
<p>And so the more time you spend on Twitter,</p>
<p>I mean, I see a lot of people saying</p>
<p>the more unhappy they are.</p>
<p>And so you do wonder whether it&rsquo;s making you more informed</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s just making you buy into</p>
<p>some sort of mass psychosis.</p>
<p>Well, it could be both, by the way.</p>
<p>You could be becoming more informed</p>
<p>and you could be going into a psychosis,</p>
<p>but we have a lot of friends who are high profile</p>
<p>who like their behavior on Twitter is a separate thing</p>
<p>than who they actually are, right?</p>
<p>Like they just lose their shit on Twitter</p>
<p>and it is really a very strange place to be sure.</p>
<p>Can we talk, by the way,</p>
<p>can we just talk about this Bolton book?</p>
<p>I mean, what the fuck?</p>
<p>I mean, he did ask Xi Jinping to help him win the election</p>
<p>and he bartered by soybeans to help me win the election.</p>
<p>I mean, this is insane.</p>
<p>I think we need to, first of all,</p>
<p>you always gotta look at the source here.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how somebody-</p>
<p>A Fox commentator who&rsquo;s as far right as you could go?</p>
<p>Well-</p>
<p>Who was picked by Trump himself?</p>
<p>Well, he was a very weird choice for Trump</p>
<p>because one of the main reasons</p>
<p>why Trump won the Republican nomination</p>
<p>is he promised no more Bushes,</p>
<p>meaning an end to these crazy-</p>
<p>Neocon.</p>
<p>Neocon wars of intervention.</p>
<p>And this guy Bolton, like-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right out of that playbook, central casting.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s the hawk of hawks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a war he doesn&rsquo;t wanna get us into.</p>
<p>He wanted to get us into a war with Iran.</p>
<p>It never made any sense for Trump</p>
<p>to hire him in the first place.</p>
<p>But do you know why he hired him, as stated in the book?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the explanation that he liked.</p>
<p>I think he said something like</p>
<p>when he sends Bolton into a room,</p>
<p>he thinks it strengthens his negotiating position</p>
<p>because the other side thinks that they&rsquo;re about to,</p>
<p>US is about to invade or something</p>
<p>when Bolton comes into the room.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, Trump was like,</p>
<p>I love hearing you talk, it&rsquo;s just like Fox News.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s the quote.</p>
<p>So he literally picks people based,</p>
<p>I mean, and he picked Ludlow, right?</p>
<p>For his, you know.</p>
<p>He picks them based on being TV personalities.</p>
<p>I just think this Bolton guy is,</p>
<p>like, you know, is this crazy war hawk</p>
<p>who also is just kind of like a weasel.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how he creates a 500-something page book</p>
<p>out of spending 17 months in the White House.</p>
<p>I guess he&rsquo;s just writing down every-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s not 5,000 words.</p>
<p>That should be like Token&rsquo;s Lord of the Rings trilogy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put this out there.</p>
<p>If he can produce the note that Pompeo gave him</p>
<p>that said, Trump is so full of shit,</p>
<p>that thing at auction, I&rsquo;m telling you now.</p>
<p>What do you each bid for it?</p>
<p>At least $500,000, at least $500,000.</p>
<p>If that note actually exists and he has it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, I mean, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but I just think, to me, first of all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little ludicrous that this guy,</p>
<p>he is a bit of a weasel because, like,</p>
<p>where were you during the impeachment?</p>
<p>A, he made an economic calculation</p>
<p>that his book was more important</p>
<p>than the future of the country.</p>
<p>So, first of all, kind of go fuck yourself with that.</p>
<p>But the other thing, though, is that, you know,</p>
<p>beyond his sort of, like, character flaws,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the story after story after story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of from the bizarre to the absurd,</p>
<p>like, Finland&rsquo;s a part of Russia,</p>
<p>England doesn&rsquo;t have nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>please buy soybeans.</p>
<p>You are part of the, you are part of the nuclear powers?</p>
<p>UK, really?</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has nukes?</p>
<p>Wow, what if India gets them?</p>
<p>But every one of these insider tell-all books</p>
<p>always makes the, you know,</p>
<p>always makes the president look bad.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a hard task.</p>
<p>Was there anything, though,</p>
<p>that was surprising to anyone?</p>
<p>The Xi Jinping is a blockbuster.</p>
<p>The Xi Jinping did catch me off guard</p>
<p>that he was that brazen and kind of sad.</p>
<p>But does it surprise you?</p>
<p>I mean, like, the fact that it was said,</p>
<p>but, like, the motivation, the intention,</p>
<p>the model of operating, like-</p>
<p>No, to your point, my expectations are so low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like teaching a kid to poop in the toilet</p>
<p>for the first time.</p>
<p>You know, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t poop on the floor,</p>
<p>even if he does it in his diaper, you know,</p>
<p>everything looks like success</p>
<p>as long as there is just not raw feces on my hardwood.</p>
<p>If he sat on the potty, it&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>Even if the pants weren&rsquo;t pulled down.</p>
<p>If he poops his pants on the potty, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Tell me about, I just want to switch topics.</p>
<p>Tell me about vaccines,</p>
<p>because it seems to me</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s, like, a growing cohort of people,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to put Moderna in this camp,</p>
<p>but, like, maybe they did,</p>
<p>that were very opportunistically out there,</p>
<p>generating a ton of PR.</p>
<p>But what, if you had to pick a time and a timeframe,</p>
<p>and then a manufacturing timeframe,</p>
<p>can you just tell me what you&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Yeah, give us the over-under</p>
<p>so we can bet a line on it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be a staged release of vaccines</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll probably, believe it or not,</p>
<p>start in Q4 of this year.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been production ramp-up</p>
<p>going on in parallel to testing.</p>
<p>So, you know, to get these vaccines produced,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re talking about the mRNA vaccine,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re talking about the viral vaccine</p>
<p>like they did in China,</p>
<p>which they actually do have in production,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of different challenges</p>
<p>with scaling up and ramping production.</p>
<p>And then, you know, what&rsquo;s called downstream processing</p>
<p>and filtering and then packaging and all this stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s a big fucking exercise.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s gone on is there&rsquo;s been a parallel effort</p>
<p>to actually scale up production of these things</p>
<p>before we&rsquo;ve actually completed the testing of them</p>
<p>to make sure that they&rsquo;re safe and efficacious.</p>
<p>And as a result,</p>
<p>and some of this came out</p>
<p>of that first or second stimulus bill,</p>
<p>some of it came from private funding</p>
<p>and then other governments</p>
<p>are just straight up paying for it.</p>
<p>And so there are a number of facilities</p>
<p>that are actually ramping production right now.</p>
<p>If the vaccines ultimately don&rsquo;t pass muster,</p>
<p>just going to be a write-off of a couple billion dollars.</p>
<p>And so theoretically,</p>
<p>we could have doses that are available for distribution</p>
<p>to healthcare workers and frontline people</p>
<p>in Q4 of this year</p>
<p>is what I would kind of set the over-under at.</p>
<p>Do you think these vaccines are like flu vaccines,</p>
<p>which is like 50, 60% effective at best?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t really know the answer to that.</p>
<p>I would say that these things</p>
<p>are probably pretty effective.</p>
<p>I would say the flu vaccine</p>
<p>is just a high rate of mutation</p>
<p>and also a low rate of utilization</p>
<p>and a high rate of infection.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna have a lower rate of infection,</p>
<p>probably a more moderate rate of mutation as a result.</p>
<p>And so we should be more in control</p>
<p>if we get something that works with the current strains.</p>
<p>And the way that this SARS-CoV-2,</p>
<p>most of the vaccines are built around,</p>
<p>the seven, I think, major targets</p>
<p>around the spike protein</p>
<p>and different epitopes across the spike protein.</p>
<p>And so if you see a great degree of mutation</p>
<p>across that protein,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely gonna be less infected,</p>
<p>infective and less effective as a virus</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;ll go away.</p>
<p>And so I think that we&rsquo;ve got a really good shot here.</p>
<p>What are the odds that somebody politicizes the vaccine</p>
<p>and America doesn&rsquo;t get it?</p>
<p>America doesn&rsquo;t get it?</p>
<p>Oh, politicized 100%, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, we politicized fucking measles.</p>
<p>30% of people, of kids now,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t getting vaccinated for measles, which is crazy.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s measles outbreaks happening in the US,</p>
<p>which is just mind-boggling.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just happening in Marin, where you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an inevitability. I think that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>with the place with the highest percentage</p>
<p>of graduate degrees in the country.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, but I mean, it&rsquo;s an inevitability</p>
<p>that it gets politicized.</p>
<p>But David, how does the distribution</p>
<p>of these vaccines work?</p>
<p>Meaning, let&rsquo;s just say that it&rsquo;s like Sanofi, for example,</p>
<p>because I saw that the French government</p>
<p>made a large investment and the Germans did as well</p>
<p>to essentially onshore a bunch of their companies</p>
<p>who had promising vaccine candidates.</p>
<p>And so if you assume that there&rsquo;s a distribution</p>
<p>of these vaccines, let&rsquo;s just say</p>
<p>the most efficacious ones in China,</p>
<p>are they just gonna dole this out</p>
<p>to whoever&rsquo;s willing to buy it?</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;re gonna decide on a political basis</p>
<p>how to basically give these?</p>
<p>And then when they come to the United States,</p>
<p>how do we know that it comes to Texas</p>
<p>before it comes to Wyoming versus California</p>
<p>versus New York?</p>
<p>So I think the ones that are getting federal support,</p>
<p>which all of them are pretty much at this point,</p>
<p>are gonna be federally mandated in terms of distribution.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably some commercial agreement</p>
<p>that none of us have seen</p>
<p>in terms of like what that looks like.</p>
<p>So Trump will send them to the swing states</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s behind?</p>
<p>Is what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;ll probably be delegated</p>
<p>down to Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>What are the chances that there&rsquo;s a Trump logo</p>
<p>on the side of the syringe?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your Trump vaccine.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your Trump vaccine to save your life.</p>
<p>Okay, this is a good point for us</p>
<p>to kind of wrap around the horn.</p>
<p>Chamath and I think a lot of people were convinced</p>
<p>that Trump was gonna sell into office.</p>
<p>Now everything is showing, Fox News polls, CNBC polls,</p>
<p>SurveyMonkey polls, that Trump is very far behind,</p>
<p>especially in the swing states.</p>
<p>What are the chances Trump wins the election, sacks?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s, well, I think COVID&rsquo;s really hurt him</p>
<p>because the sort of feather in his cap,</p>
<p>the thing he really had going for him was the economy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been hurt, but it&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>You know, the situation could look very different</p>
<p>six months from now.</p>
<p>Right now it looks pretty bleak</p>
<p>because I do think that his reaction</p>
<p>to the crisis was seen as very inflammatory.</p>
<p>But I think six months from now</p>
<p>could be a very different story.</p>
<p>Five months, so.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gonna win right now,</p>
<p>but he could turn around.</p>
<p>If the election were today, he would lose.</p>
<p>But, you know, the economy, we&rsquo;re seeing a V-shaped recovery</p>
<p>which I think is surprising all of us.</p>
<p>And if that holds up and we get past the civil unrest</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had and, you know,</p>
<p>he stops being so inflammatory on those issues,</p>
<p>I think that, you know,</p>
<p>the situation could look very different in five months.</p>
<p>You gotta remember the other thing,</p>
<p>which is Biden at some point is gonna have to enter</p>
<p>to some presidential debates.</p>
<p>And, you know, this will-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unknown if he&rsquo;s gonna be there,</p>
<p>is what you&rsquo;re saying, cognitively.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unpopular to talk about,</p>
<p>but you actually think there&rsquo;s a cognitive issue?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>Probably, yeah.</p>
<p>Probably, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uncomfortable to say for some reason.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s undeniable. I mean, at a minimum,</p>
<p>look, there&rsquo;s a problem with the way he speaks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>Which is indicative of a problem with the way he thinks.</p>
<p>But, you know, like when-</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re on stage for two hours in a debate,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna find out really quick.</p>
<p>And I think those debates are pretty unavoidable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Biden&rsquo;s gonna be able to figure out</p>
<p>a way to get out of it.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think a lot of people think</p>
<p>that he can just be propped up by his staff.</p>
<p>And they can to some extent,</p>
<p>but I think at some point, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to take a look at Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Chamath, Trump wins, Trump loses.</p>
<p>Right now, I think it&rsquo;s sort of 75-25 he loses.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna get closer to 55-45</p>
<p>as the date comes close.</p>
<p>I think it actually comes down to two issues.</p>
<p>Number one is who does Biden pick as a running mate?</p>
<p>And can he lock up the swing states with that running mate?</p>
<p>And number two, which I think is probably gonna play</p>
<p>an enormous role if the community organizing</p>
<p>that saw the Black Lives Matter movement</p>
<p>get to this next level is avoiding</p>
<p>and preventing voter suppression.</p>
<p>You know, LeBron, I think is about to start</p>
<p>an enormous campaign with a lot of very well-heeled</p>
<p>well-known celebrities to get out the vote.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s a concerted effort</p>
<p>to prevent voter suppression and get young people</p>
<p>and people of color to the polls, it&rsquo;s a Biden landslide.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve gone from a Trump landslide just six months ago</p>
<p>in all of our minds to a Biden landslide.</p>
<p>Freeberg, where are you at?</p>
<p>I still think Trump&rsquo;s gonna win.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say 70% chance Trump wins.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s still,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not gonna be structural improvement</p>
<p>between now and November for the majority of people</p>
<p>that voted for Trump in the last election.</p>
<p>There are gonna be a large number of people</p>
<p>in blue collar and rural areas</p>
<p>that remain challenged with their life</p>
<p>and feel like they&rsquo;re missing out and they&rsquo;re missing.</p>
<p>And this may even be true in inner city districts,</p>
<p>but the big kind of flip vote</p>
<p>in the rural and blue collar areas</p>
<p>is gonna say, I still need change.</p>
<p>I need things fixed.</p>
<p>And Trump is the agent of change.</p>
<p>Biden, he has always been the agent of change.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you the other thing he&rsquo;s also a master of</p>
<p>is laying blame.</p>
<p>And so Trump is incredible at pointing a finger</p>
<p>at some third party and saying, that&rsquo;s the enemy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the guy who&rsquo;s gonna go defeat him for a year.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what won him the election last time.</p>
<p>And I think it could win him the election again this time.</p>
<p>No matter what shit happens between now and November,</p>
<p>he will find a way to make the story</p>
<p>about how some third party or some process</p>
<p>or some deep state is still responsible for that outcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s keeping you down, Mr. Blue collar factory worker.</p>
<p>And I will be the person to vanquish that problem.</p>
<p>Biden is the old state.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the old guard.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the guy from before.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t changed anything in the last four years</p>
<p>where people feel happy and secure about their lives.</p>
<p>I think to Sax&rsquo;s point, if the economy was even stronger,</p>
<p>it may hurt Trump&rsquo;s chances.</p>
<p>Sure, a lot of folks might say, great, Trump&rsquo;s responsible.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give him a thumbs up.</p>
<p>But the more people are feeling pain,</p>
<p>the more they&rsquo;re looking for an agent of change.</p>
<p>And I think Trump against Biden</p>
<p>is still gonna be that agent of change.</p>
<p>That makes me the deciding either tie or swing vote.</p>
<p>I believe Biden wins.</p>
<p>I believe Trump is absolutely lost his ability to win this</p>
<p>because he made two critical errors</p>
<p>to Sax&rsquo;s very astute point.</p>
<p>He just complete blunder on wearing masks</p>
<p>and leadership during COVID</p>
<p>and complete blunder in terms of dealing</p>
<p>with the social unrest,</p>
<p>which he could have acted as a reconciliation agent.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s his own worst enemy</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t do those two very simple things.</p>
<p>I think Biden wins big if he takes the following strategy,</p>
<p>which I will call the Avenger strategy,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s not just about him.</p>
<p>He gets an incredible running mate to Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>but not only that,</p>
<p>he pre-announces his cabinet Avenger style</p>
<p>and they start hosting a la Cuomo in New York</p>
<p>daily briefings where they talk about</p>
<p>what the country needs to do</p>
<p>with a brain trust in a round table</p>
<p>with five or six people pre-selected.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not voting for Biden</p>
<p>who might have cognitive issues and Sax is correct.</p>
<p>He could fumble under Trump&rsquo;s greatest strength,</p>
<p>which is demolishing people in debates,</p>
<p>which we ourselves all watched.</p>
<p>We watched Hillary get absolutely beat up in those debates.</p>
<p>And that was our, I remember those nights</p>
<p>when we were watching at your house Chamath</p>
<p>and our eyes opened right up, like, holy cow,</p>
<p>Hillary&rsquo;s in trouble here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just really good at this type of maniac boxing</p>
<p>that he does with little Mark Rubio</p>
<p>and everybody else he annihilated.</p>
<p>But if he picks the right VP candidate,</p>
<p>and I wanna know as we close here,</p>
<p>who is the VP candidate that you think he should pick?</p>
<p>Amy Klobuchar just bowed out and said,</p>
<p>a woman is not enough, you need to have a black woman.</p>
<p>So Chamath, who is the ideal running mate?</p>
<p>Sax, who scares you the most since, you know,</p>
<p>the GOP is gonna lose this time around?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the scariest for you?</p>
<p>And Freeberg, who do you think he should pick?</p>
<p>Give it some thought or do you not have a consensus choice?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave my statement to the end.</p>
<p>Okay, Saxy Poop.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sandbag this and pick somebody you want him to pick</p>
<p>because it helps him lose.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know the back bench</p>
<p>of Democrat politicians well enough to say exactly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a pick.</p>
<p>I would just say, I would really like for him</p>
<p>to pick a great crisis manager.</p>
<p>An operator, somebody who&rsquo;s been there.</p>
<p>Somebody who&rsquo;s been tested in a crisis</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a very high chance</p>
<p>that this VP pick will become the president,</p>
<p>given Biden&rsquo;s age and everything going on in the world.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve just seen crisis after crisis this year.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s gonna be more shoes to drop.</p>
<p>And this person that we don&rsquo;t even know yet</p>
<p>could very easily be the president of the United States</p>
<p>in the next two years.</p>
<p>So I just hope he picks someone</p>
<p>who is good at handling a crisis.</p>
<p>Okay, so that would mean Oprah, perhaps?</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>God, you just picked my, fuck!</p>
<p>Is that really your pick, Chamath?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, Oprah Winfrey.</p>
<p>I mean, she would be such an amazing.</p>
<p>She would be incredible.</p>
<p>Oh my God, she would win every state.</p>
<p>Oh, she&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Oprah Winfrey for the win.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re gonna pick somebody.</p>
<p>Biden Winfrey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta ring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a slam dunk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slam dunk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Better than Michelle Obama, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slam dunk.</p>
<p>Better than Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>Slam dunk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna email Blinken and Evan Ryan right now.</p>
<p>Oprah Winfrey.</p>
<p>Okay, Friedberg, you have a better candidate.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s your choice from there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not gonna make a choice here,</p>
<p>but I think the challenge he&rsquo;s gonna face</p>
<p>is finding a black woman who can appeal</p>
<p>to the blue collar and rural vote</p>
<p>in these areas where he needs to kind of win some folks over.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s gonna end up in these urban districts</p>
<p>like the Atlanta mayor or like Kamala Harris,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not gonna bring that vote.</p>
<p>So he is in a little bit of a pickle here</p>
<p>because Amy Klobuchar helped him bridge the rural divide.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s got a, I think there&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a bit of a search here to find someone</p>
<p>that can really get that for him.</p>
<p>I love the idea of going with Oprah</p>
<p>because it just becomes, she is such a reconciler.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t fit the execution in a crisis</p>
<p>to Sachs&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>And I understand-</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s built a bigger business than Trump.</p>
<p>I mean, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>But that is what it&rsquo;s about to get to</p>
<p>is I think she&rsquo;s so successful</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s such a great leader and so charismatic.</p>
<p>She would bring in better operators</p>
<p>than Trump and Pence ever could.</p>
<p>I mean, look at the shit show of people</p>
<p>who came in and out of the cabinet.</p>
<p>It was one goofball and incompetent asshole after another.</p>
<p>Sorry to get a little frisky here at the end,</p>
<p>but I feel like we&rsquo;re at the poker game.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s cabinet was in an embarrassment</p>
<p>almost universally, correct, Sachs?</p>
<p>Well, look, here&rsquo;s the problem with Oprah</p>
<p>or if you want any other Hollywood celebrity,</p>
<p>George Clooney or what have you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not used to getting beat up</p>
<p>the way that politicians in our country get beat up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used to having people catering to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used to having the star trailer</p>
<p>and the star treatment.</p>
<p>And they tend to have a glass jaw in politics</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve just never been put in an environment</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just constantly assaulted.</p>
<p>Trump, I mean, was a celebrity,</p>
<p>but he was used to, he kind of grew up</p>
<p>in that whole New York tabloid environment</p>
<p>and was used to punching and counterpunching.</p>
<p>He embraced it, in fact.</p>
<p>He was his own fake PR person.</p>
<p>He was calling the post.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s that old saying about wrestling with a pig.</p>
<p>Everyone gets dirty, but the pig likes it.</p>
<p>I mean, Trump is kind of like the pig who likes it.</p>
<p>Mostly celebrities don&rsquo;t like having to get beat up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used to being very popular</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they tend to be, I think,</p>
<p>tough picks politically, is they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they tend to have a glass jaw.</p>
<p>All right, on that-</p>
<p>Biden, Winfrey.</p>
<p>Biden, Winfrey.</p>
<p>I love you guys.</p>
<p>Love you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s play poker outside.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
