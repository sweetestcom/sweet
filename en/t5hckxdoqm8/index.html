<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>all right welcome back everyone we have</p>
<p>a great show lined up we have a lot of</p>
<p>people in the green screen and uh not</p>
<p>the green screen the green room how</p>
<p>about that and on social media and</p>
<p>anything that i say is definitely not</p>
<p>meant to</p>
<p>bypass your medical doctor&rsquo;s advice just</p>
<p>check with</p>
<p>your doctor before you</p>
<p>implement any of this information</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s just dive right in steve</p>
<p>all right we&rsquo;re ready to and uh we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>usually go straight to the green room</p>
<p>but in this case lanny from new york</p>
<p>might have firemen stomping through her</p>
<p>place for some kind of fire driller</p>
<p>inspection so let&rsquo;s get her on the air</p>
<p>first and lanny if you don&rsquo;t mute</p>
<p>yourself you are on</p>
<p>uh hang on you are</p>
<p>as i said on with dr byrd we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>with your question great</p>
<p>thank you hi dr berg hello</p>
<p>so my question for you is um i&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>been a pretty lightweight person like</p>
<p>five foot six</p>
<p>107 pounds in my early 30s and i have</p>
<p>trouble keeping on weight and gaining</p>
<p>muscle um i gain muscle fairly easily</p>
<p>when i work out and the reason i work</p>
<p>out is to keep my insulin and my</p>
<p>hormones pretty stable because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>struggled with that in my life i had</p>
<p>type 2 diabetes my early 20s</p>
<p>um but was the same weight</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s what i was eating</p>
<p>um and i also had an underactive thyroid</p>
<p>that i worked with a naturopath to</p>
<p>correct using potassium iodine for two</p>
<p>years</p>
<p>um so i don&rsquo;t take any pharmaceutical</p>
<p>anything i just kind of monitor what i</p>
<p>eat and exercise sleep well um but i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like to put on some more meat on my</p>
<p>thighs because i have chicken legs</p>
<p>and i wanted to know your opinion do you</p>
<p>recommend intermittent fasting for</p>
<p>someone who is you know in my kind of</p>
<p>situation</p>
<p>yeah the problem is how do you um</p>
<p>maintain weight and keep insulin low</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always been the question since</p>
<p>insulin is a</p>
<p>anabolic hormone it&rsquo;s it is involved in</p>
<p>the growth of muscle but it also</p>
<p>is involved in the growth of fat</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>so how do you do that so well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other hormones that you can activate to</p>
<p>increase</p>
<p>muscle</p>
<p>you have um</p>
<p>growth hormone and another hormone</p>
<p>called igf number one and</p>
<p>these other hormones so what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to do</p>
<p>is still keep your carbs down do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>twice a day</p>
<p>increase the volume of food</p>
<p>add more exercise especially to your</p>
<p>legs</p>
<p>more heavier weight lower reps</p>
<p>and because the ac the out of all the</p>
<p>actions um</p>
<p>you have to activate activating the</p>
<p>muscle produces the most</p>
<p>stimulation of hypertrophy of muscle</p>
<p>now as far as insulin instead of</p>
<p>increasing insulin with carbs maybe you</p>
<p>do it with protein a little bit more so</p>
<p>because a moderate amount of protein is</p>
<p>always recommended but if you go up a</p>
<p>little bit with the protein you&rsquo;ll a</p>
<p>half of that&rsquo;s going to to turn into</p>
<p>sugar and stimulate insulin to a certain</p>
<p>degree</p>
<p>but also you have this counter hormone</p>
<p>coming in called glucagon which will</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>minimize the effects of the</p>
<p>the insulin to a certain degree so i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what i would do and then on</p>
<p>top of all that</p>
<p>make sure that you really kind of get a</p>
<p>little more sleep because</p>
<p>growth hormone is activated by sleep</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>and the absence of sugar</p>
<p>so um so i think that that would be the</p>
<p>program i would use to uh to try to</p>
<p>accomplish what you&rsquo;re doing thank you</p>
<p>thank you when you say intermittent</p>
<p>fasting twice a day what is like the</p>
<p>what should be an ideal schedule of</p>
<p>eating and and not eating well</p>
<p>um you know when you fast you stimulate</p>
<p>growth hormone even more than exercise</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i would try to do those two meals uh</p>
<p>within a four hours and that would be</p>
<p>the uh the best way to do it if you</p>
<p>could so that way you&rsquo;re fasting for</p>
<p>like 20 hours then you have two meals</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re probably not going to be</p>
<p>hungry for the second meal so um you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just gonna have to eat anyway to keep</p>
<p>those two meals in uh that would be a</p>
<p>great thing but you know maybe you start</p>
<p>out with 18 hour fast and then kind of</p>
<p>go up to 20 because it is difficult you</p>
<p>know you&rsquo;re like eating at three and</p>
<p>then eating at six i think some around</p>
<p>right around there so it&rsquo;s a little yeah</p>
<p>i find 12 hours difficult sometimes</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the thing if you find</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it difficult to fast then we know</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re not quite in you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>adapted yet and then when you adapt</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually correcting insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>at the same time which will then allow</p>
<p>you to pull in more amino acids to help</p>
<p>your muscle and pull more nutrition in</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>actually get really healthy so i think</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>perfect thank you yeah i think i think</p>
<p>this will help you in different levels</p>
<p>thank you that was great yes awesome</p>
<p>thank you very much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thanks so much lanny for</p>
<p>joining us uh on the ear and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great and when the</p>
<p>new york fire department charges in give</p>
<p>them our best</p>
<p>and i hope they don&rsquo;t make too much of a</p>
<p>racket in there okay let&rsquo;s go uh</p>
<p>over to social media and get a sense of</p>
<p>who is listening to us and by the way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got one person uh in atisha in the</p>
<p>uh green room who is uh from england</p>
<p>tisha i&rsquo;m not coming to you yet but i</p>
<p>just want to say that we&rsquo;ve got one from</p>
<p>england and then we got alma from spain</p>
<p>and in addition to those two great folks</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to say hello to canada</p>
<p>bulgaria india japan the bahamas germany</p>
<p>greece algeria cameroon the netherlands</p>
<p>israel mexico nigeria bangladesh haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard from them for a while france syria</p>
<p>taiwan zambia sweden egypt belgium chile</p>
<p>pakistan the philippines south africa</p>
<p>italy malaysia denmark</p>
<p>ghana turkey guatemala the dominican</p>
<p>republic bahrain</p>
<p>lebanon wales indonesia australia oman</p>
<p>dubai argentina new zealand spain</p>
<p>switzerland romania trinidad</p>
<p>tobago iran macedonia ireland good grief</p>
<p>ukraine serbia kuwait panama croatia</p>
<p>jordan uh let&rsquo;s see almost done folks</p>
<p>australia norway brazil</p>
<p>terry will have to clue me in on that</p>
<p>scotland finland kashmir sri lankan</p>
<p>nepal peru and all across these united</p>
<p>states and by the way uh there&rsquo;s you see</p>
<p>all these uh from uh from the sort of</p>
<p>arab nations tell them why don&rsquo;t we just</p>
<p>take a moment here to talk about the</p>
<p>growth of these channels these various</p>
<p>different language channels and also</p>
<p>their ability to uh you know get your</p>
<p>products at a cheaper rate but boy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re from well well the fir the for</p>
<p>the english channel obviously is growing</p>
<p>the fastest but uh you also have this in</p>
<p>second it&rsquo;s the um arabic channel which</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m not mistaken it&rsquo;s already almost</p>
<p>at five million subscribers that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people in other parts of the world that</p>
<p>are subscribing um especially</p>
<p>which is surprising in northern africa</p>
<p>which uh i never would have</p>
<p>thought that and then coming in third is</p>
<p>uh the russian channel which is</p>
<p>expanding and then fourth is the</p>
<p>taiwanese channel and so what we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ve um to try to help reduce all</p>
<p>the expensive shipping we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>found some places over in these</p>
<p>different countries that you can get</p>
<p>products we&rsquo;ll put some links down below</p>
<p>so you can save on shipping</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s terrific folks thanks</p>
<p>everybody for listening terry thank you</p>
<p>for the furious typing you must do to</p>
<p>catalog all this every week</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go over to youtube helena what can</p>
<p>i take for anxiety i&rsquo;m taking b5 and</p>
<p>quercetin</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>yeah you need b1</p>
<p>nutritional yeast will usually help but</p>
<p>b1 is the thing that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>help anxiety the most you&rsquo;ll feel like a</p>
<p>sense of relief calmness</p>
<p>and then the other thing i would use is</p>
<p>you have ashwagandha is a great</p>
<p>uh second best one it&rsquo;s an adaptogen so</p>
<p>ashwagandha has been proven and known to</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>you pull someone out of this stress mode</p>
<p>and worry and</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s another good one too so</p>
<p>those two are my favorite</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific and if terry hadn&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>enough already he wanted to add to the</p>
<p>shout out russia poland and ethiopia i</p>
<p>think that pretty much covers the entire</p>
<p>globe so let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go to</p>
<p>uh so b1 for helena that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>stints let me go here let&rsquo;s see b</p>
<p>complex some more uh my doctor here&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>deborah from youtube my doctor wants me</p>
<p>to switch from keto to a more standard</p>
<p>diet and eat everything and anything he</p>
<p>says it will develop organ failure if i</p>
<p>continue with keto</p>
<p>and deborah is 65.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like saying let&rsquo;s want you need</p>
<p>to brush your teeth with sugar water</p>
<p>because that way it&rsquo;ll actually reduce</p>
<p>the cavities i mean</p>
<p>that person you know just doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>all the data um and i would um</p>
<p>you know do an experiment if you&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>just do what he&rsquo;s recommending do his</p>
<p>diet and then do it for a month and then</p>
<p>see how you feel</p>
<p>and then go back to what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>recommending and then you can see how</p>
<p>you feel then you&rsquo;ll know for sure</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;ll tell you the emotional</p>
<p>component is the biggest driver for me i</p>
<p>mean i&rsquo;m you know i could probably lose</p>
<p>a few pounds but being depressed and</p>
<p>miserable and jittery and and anxiety</p>
<p>ridden from eating tons of carbohydrates</p>
<p>and donuts and so on is not worth it i</p>
<p>mean you know so</p>
<p>that test should be interesting i would</p>
<p>rather feel good emotionally than really</p>
<p>worry about my waistline at least do</p>
<p>that first so um i can see from my</p>
<p>experiments there is an unbelievable</p>
<p>difference in my quality of life since i</p>
<p>quit eating all that crud and in my case</p>
<p>specifically do intermittent fasting so</p>
<p>yeah have at it with that experiment but</p>
<p>uh you know after an honest evaluation</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ll find uh something</p>
<p>different from what you&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see how about uh</p>
<p>oh and here&rsquo;s something positive as</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen several times today on the</p>
<p>stream john from melbourne australia on</p>
<p>facebook i&rsquo;ve never been healthier</p>
<p>thanks for to your advice</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s some more support awesome uh</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see awesome yes they&rsquo;re great</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re going to test the loyalty</p>
<p>to the audience by bringing up a</p>
<p>question and see if they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>watching your videos and so on and doc</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the first one</p>
<p>all right so true or false applying cold</p>
<p>therapy after an injury will speed up</p>
<p>your healing</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll just add in recovery</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>or is that false all right dig into that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what else we have here we</p>
<p>always want we&rsquo;re so excited about the</p>
<p>folks in the green room but we we won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>forget about our friends on um social</p>
<p>media so let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>freelay from youtube wants to know what</p>
<p>you suggest to address dark blemishes on</p>
<p>the face she didn&rsquo;t say how old she is</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s several there&rsquo;s several</p>
<p>things that that could be um but i will</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>um one of the common remedies for</p>
<p>hyper pigmentation on the skin is</p>
<p>essential fatty acids and um so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of foods that can</p>
<p>do that for you um like especially the</p>
<p>fish oils the fish food like fatty fish</p>
<p>not fish food though but um that type of</p>
<p>thing and i think even cod liver oil</p>
<p>would be good that&rsquo;s really good for</p>
<p>your skin because it has the vitamin a</p>
<p>which can help the skin in many</p>
<p>different ways including that</p>
<p>hyperpigmentation so and that also</p>
<p>works if you have scaly</p>
<p>dry skin</p>
<p>too</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in a fat usually vitamin a or</p>
<p>a fat food so the foods that are really</p>
<p>high in vitamin a would be butter</p>
<p>cod liver oil</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>egg yolks</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>egg yolks is a good one that&rsquo;s an easy</p>
<p>one to do</p>
<p>wonderful okay and to demonstrate that</p>
<p>people from all over the world struggle</p>
<p>with some of the same things</p>
<p>jayathi from india on youtube has been</p>
<p>asked by a doctor to reduce carbs in</p>
<p>this case from my diet but carbs are a</p>
<p>staple of our diet in south india what</p>
<p>are some good alternatives to rice and</p>
<p>other high carb foods</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a staple but it&rsquo;s also um</p>
<p>a common thing that in india we have a</p>
<p>lot of diabetes we&rsquo;re getting more</p>
<p>obesity</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>you know what worked</p>
<p>to some degree maybe um 50 years ago um</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>the refined foods and the diet has</p>
<p>shifted it hasn&rsquo;t been exactly the same</p>
<p>thing now versus</p>
<p>back 50 or even 100 years ago in india</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>different type of carbohydrate with a</p>
<p>lot of other refined sugars and things</p>
<p>like that but</p>
<p>unfortunately you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>start a new trend in india and trying to</p>
<p>maintain those flavors</p>
<p>yet go low sugar now um i did</p>
<p>we do have a lot of recipes</p>
<p>on the youtube channel on the recipes if</p>
<p>you look under the different channel</p>
<p>that can help mimic some of these indian</p>
<p>wonderful flavors with just by cutting</p>
<p>out the sugar so with the rice for</p>
<p>example i know some of you will say well</p>
<p>no i tried that didn&rsquo;t work but you can</p>
<p>make a keto rice with cauliflower that</p>
<p>is pretty darn similar</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what i do</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m even growing this</p>
<p>curry plant it&rsquo;s not called the curry</p>
<p>plant but it&rsquo;s a plant that has the</p>
<p>curry leaves because i just love those</p>
<p>flavors so there is a way to do it but</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>it just do without all those triggers um</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>and be a trendsetter you know maybe you</p>
<p>could start a new</p>
<p>new thing and uh i bet you</p>
<p>all the benefits will</p>
<p>cause people just to jump on the wagon</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>and follow you wonderful</p>
<p>yep we&rsquo;re rooting for you india so go</p>
<p>get some of the cauliflower rice and if</p>
<p>you dump some of that great sauce masala</p>
<p>and all on top of it i guarantee you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a great day and the</p>
<p>audience has been very attentive uh we</p>
<p>asked a true falser which said applying</p>
<p>cold therapy</p>
<p>after an injury will speed your recovery</p>
<p>and the audience</p>
<p>99 of respondents say true and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>stubborn one percent to say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>well this might be some new information</p>
<p>for a lot of people because it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>release a video on this because we we</p>
<p>all know for a fact that when you have</p>
<p>an acute injury if you put cold on it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing to do right</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s fascinating is uh things have</p>
<p>changed as far as the</p>
<p>evidence on that that there&rsquo;s no no</p>
<p>proof that it increases</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>recovery at all now it does reduce pain</p>
<p>it does reduce inflammation</p>
<p>but not recovery if you think about what</p>
<p>inflammation is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s part of the healing response and</p>
<p>when you reduce inflammation whether</p>
<p>from ice</p>
<p>or an nsaid like a medication that</p>
<p>blocks inflammation guess what</p>
<p>you increase the time</p>
<p>of healing the duration where you have</p>
<p>that problem</p>
<p>you shorten your repair in recovery</p>
<p>because now</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have that inflammation we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the we have uh lack of blood flow</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s interesting because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of those things that everyone knows</p>
<p>um and i always um suspect suspect of</p>
<p>those things that oh we all know we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to take a look at this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s true well let&rsquo;s just take a</p>
<p>look and make sure that&rsquo;s true um now</p>
<p>you say well</p>
<p>it does get rid of pain when i put an</p>
<p>ice pack on it</p>
<p>yeah okay good so do it for that but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other things you can do for pain</p>
<p>that are equally as good and i am going</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>release that video next week so anyway</p>
<p>this is uh</p>
<p>new information and i will say this</p>
<p>steve and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll zipit.com but</p>
<p>anytime you tell someone</p>
<p>opposing information</p>
<p>sometimes people just like reject it</p>
<p>right away and they get upset and they</p>
<p>defend their viewpoint all i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>look at the information take a look at</p>
<p>it before you reject it and then</p>
<p>then conclude</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>we all have fixed ideas and uh that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>that inhibits our ability to look at all</p>
<p>the information when we have these fixed</p>
<p>ideas so that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m saying and now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be quiet well that&rsquo;s all right you</p>
<p>know people used to bleed themselves</p>
<p>half to death thinking that got rid of</p>
<p>the bad whatever karma but we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>since then</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>dch from youtube could you please do a</p>
<p>video on eating disorders if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>already uh and how they might have done</p>
<p>that i already have done that and uh</p>
<p>there has been a few people who didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like that video because i did mention a</p>
<p>bit of fasting and that might be a</p>
<p>problem but</p>
<p>okay so</p>
<p>all i&rsquo;m saying with eating disorders is</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t snack okay have three good</p>
<p>meals how about that and then that would</p>
<p>help you but the carbs the carbs are a</p>
<p>problem um what the person you know what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to do is we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>stabilize the person um emotion wise</p>
<p>to so they can um have more control over</p>
<p>this this condition and</p>
<p>feeding the brain ketones is a very</p>
<p>therapeutic thing to help with that</p>
<p>in many different levels so</p>
<p>anyway i think that</p>
<p>when someone has an eating disorder</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of strain on the digestive</p>
<p>system especially the gallbladder</p>
<p>and the nutrient absorption and the</p>
<p>whole thing so</p>
<p>anyway i did a video on it you can watch</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>very good i hope that offers some hope</p>
<p>uh viewer okay let&rsquo;s go to the next uh</p>
<p>question another true fall sir</p>
<p>all right true or false one of the best</p>
<p>therapies for the lungs i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about the lower respiratory system</p>
<p>is exposure to the sun</p>
<p>is that one of the best remedies true or</p>
<p>false</p>
<p>yes or no either way that&rsquo;s very curious</p>
<p>okay why don&rsquo;t we go back to the green</p>
<p>room let me see who i&rsquo;m going to pick on</p>
<p>next you know jared&rsquo;s very handsome why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we bring him on the air and he&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think a</p>
<p>surfer dude uh i heard him talking about</p>
<p>there may be a skateboarder but anyway</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also into health</p>
<p>and uh jared you&rsquo;re only on the air</p>
<p>excuse me with dr</p>
<p>byrd</p>
<p>i think you muted jared</p>
<p>hey dr burke hopefully you can hear me</p>
<p>yes perfect cool</p>
<p>yeah man so basically um</p>
<p>ever since november i was going surfing</p>
<p>pretty much every single day doing long</p>
<p>intense bike rides</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>starting november of 2021</p>
<p>i started having this weird thing like a</p>
<p>pounding sensation of my chest so my</p>
<p>heart it would be really hard for no</p>
<p>reason even if my heart rate was normal</p>
<p>so it would pound and then i&rsquo;d also get</p>
<p>like a weird adrenaline rush type</p>
<p>feeling in the chest um and so that</p>
<p>started november went to multiple</p>
<p>emergency room doctors i went to follow</p>
<p>up with cardiology they couldn&rsquo;t figure</p>
<p>out what was going on um and so</p>
<p>basically i&rsquo;ve been trying to find the</p>
<p>root cause of the issue</p>
<p>a lot of doctors say that it could be a</p>
<p>dysfunction of my autonomic nervous</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>um and so yeah i&rsquo;ve been just trying to</p>
<p>figure this stuff out for a couple</p>
<p>months i had to quit my job and quit</p>
<p>school back in february because of it so</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>well um the heart you have two things</p>
<p>you have</p>
<p>well have you checked your pulse rate as</p>
<p>your pulse rate went up when when you</p>
<p>feel this pounding or</p>
<p>is it just more of a pounding that you</p>
<p>feel or hear</p>
<p>in your body</p>
<p>yeah so my pulse rate is normal it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>like 60 beats per minute but it just i</p>
<p>will feel the pulse in my chest so my</p>
<p>heart will just shake my entire chest</p>
<p>every time it beats yeah</p>
<p>yeah that is um that&rsquo;s a classic</p>
<p>potassium deficiency um it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>to measure potassium in the blood</p>
<p>because most of it is not in the blood</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the cell so you&rsquo;d have to do an</p>
<p>intracellular potassium</p>
<p>test which you can do</p>
<p>but a lot of times the doctors don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know where to order that test from</p>
<p>but you can do a home quick kit but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>you need more potassium you can do it in</p>
<p>a high potassium electrolyte powder you</p>
<p>can start eating more greens and</p>
<p>vegetables um and then realize what</p>
<p>depletes potassium is refined</p>
<p>carbohydrate sugar</p>
<p>and pasta and breads things like that</p>
<p>but potassium will pull you out of that</p>
<p>i used to have that problem now there is</p>
<p>another cause of that as well and that</p>
<p>is your ph is just a little too acid so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing a lot of like kombucha</p>
<p>tea for example i know that&rsquo;s been known</p>
<p>to do it or too much apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>that can do it but</p>
<p>that usually isn&rsquo;t the case but it can</p>
<p>cause that um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you do that and then</p>
<p>adding more potassium doesn&rsquo;t help you</p>
<p>then you need to just take more b1 and</p>
<p>that will calm the heart down it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>prevent that</p>
<p>excessive</p>
<p>pounding um but i would i would go with</p>
<p>potassium first and i will i would i</p>
<p>would like to mention when i was when i</p>
<p>lived in san diego the first and last</p>
<p>time i ever surfed um</p>
<p>you know i walk out there i bought a</p>
<p>suit i was all excited</p>
<p>and i grabbed a surfboard and a wave</p>
<p>takes the surfboard one way and takes my</p>
<p>head another i whiplash my neck</p>
<p>go back on the</p>
<p>into the sand</p>
<p>i have a line of</p>
<p>chiropractors waiting to get their hand</p>
<p>on my neck which you never want to</p>
<p>adjust someone after whiplash so anyway</p>
<p>to make a long story short i messed up</p>
<p>my neck and uh</p>
<p>never went back out but i thought i mean</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s a great thing to do and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i could imagine it&rsquo;s a lot of fun</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually crazy because i a month</p>
<p>before i started having all these</p>
<p>symptoms i got stuck in between the wave</p>
<p>and then the surfboard nailed me on the</p>
<p>right side of my neck and so i was</p>
<p>talking with all the doctors like it</p>
<p>could be biggest nerve dysfunction maybe</p>
<p>a compression the biggest nerve runs</p>
<p>through the heart so</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>well you know what you know what that</p>
<p>see that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s important to know uh</p>
<p>absolutely um</p>
<p>a misalignment can cause pressure on</p>
<p>this like your c1 which affects the</p>
<p>brainstem which is connected to the</p>
<p>vagus nerve that&rsquo;s right where the vagus</p>
<p>nerve comes out and that</p>
<p>that can create that sensation</p>
<p>absolutely so i think if i were you i</p>
<p>would find a competent good cairo that</p>
<p>you can go to and have them work on that</p>
<p>i bet you that would help you i bet you</p>
<p>that would help you tremendously</p>
<p>cool so more potassium and then possibly</p>
<p>get an adjustment on the neck okay</p>
<p>awesome</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>all right thank you so much jared and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so proud of our green room they</p>
<p>are really keeping their questions</p>
<p>concise and that&rsquo;s going to provide room</p>
<p>for everyone else one else excuse me to</p>
<p>come on okay so</p>
<p>uh next question everybody&rsquo;s uh very</p>
<p>fast with that just a moment let me get</p>
<p>to that</p>
<p>the question is just fly right past that</p>
<p>all right here we go</p>
<p>quiz question number two</p>
<p>and the quest the</p>
<p>good grief</p>
<p>the quiz asks true false one of the best</p>
<p>therapies for the lungs is exposure to</p>
<p>the sun what an interesting question</p>
<p>uh 78 percent of respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true 22 say it&rsquo;s false give us the</p>
<p>answer</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>in caps</p>
<p>remedies for the lungs and lower</p>
<p>respiratory system because</p>
<p>when you get this uh this the rays from</p>
<p>the sun not only are getting vitamin d</p>
<p>okay not only are you getting vitamin d</p>
<p>but the uv</p>
<p>light</p>
<p>can act to</p>
<p>clean</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>pollution</p>
<p>from the air it can actually help reduce</p>
<p>micro microorganisms</p>
<p>and pathogens in the air</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool but on top of that</p>
<p>on the other side of the spectrum you</p>
<p>have infrared you have the infrared</p>
<p>spectrum that actually comes down and</p>
<p>that penetrates your body into your</p>
<p>brain into your lungs so we have the</p>
<p>infrared which is infrared therapy is</p>
<p>awesome for</p>
<p>for your immune system for making</p>
<p>melatonin</p>
<p>for your lung tissue for reducing</p>
<p>infection reducing inflammation and</p>
<p>helping things like copd</p>
<p>so you have quite a few cool things in</p>
<p>in sun that</p>
<p>go beyond just the vitamin d</p>
<p>uv</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>ir um</p>
<p>you know you might say like well</p>
<p>okay we need sun to make chlorophyll and</p>
<p>the plants</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>okay so then why do these plants grow in</p>
<p>a forest they don&rsquo;t have much sun</p>
<p>well what&rsquo;s interesting about that since</p>
<p>my recent hobby is like studying light</p>
<p>and using little</p>
<p>devices to measure light and and</p>
<p>understand what light is you have these</p>
<p>these plants that</p>
<p>can can grow um</p>
<p>chlorophyll from the ir the infrared</p>
<p>which is not visible light but it goes</p>
<p>right through the trees down into these</p>
<p>plants and the plants</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t get as much light</p>
<p>they have to</p>
<p>adapt</p>
<p>and they become more efficient at making</p>
<p>uh oxygen and taking in co2 so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole</p>
<p>interesting thing with um</p>
<p>with light and how it affects plants and</p>
<p>also our bodies so</p>
<p>yeah if you have any type of respiratory</p>
<p>issues or lung issues you go out in the</p>
<p>sun without getting burnt and even if</p>
<p>you go out there with your clothes you</p>
<p>know covering your head and the whole</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re still getting</p>
<p>infrared which is a great therapy for</p>
<p>your body</p>
<p>fantastic okay going back to</p>
<p>facebook in this case</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t see her name there but she</p>
<p>is having a tough time getting off of</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>and feels that maybe a supplement would</p>
<p>help her she&rsquo;s just you know can&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to dodge them</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s many things uh</p>
<p>supplements that you can take um like</p>
<p>for example if you suck on these little</p>
<p>inositol uh pills right there&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>sweet it&rsquo;s a b vitamin but there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>sugar in it and that will help reduce</p>
<p>cravings</p>
<p>you also can</p>
<p>start making keto treats with</p>
<p>sugar alcohols things like xylitol</p>
<p>erythritol monk fruit stevia</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one remedy that i really</p>
<p>like and gemnema it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>and you take that</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>the word originates from</p>
<p>a word that means sugar destroyer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been used for a long time</p>
<p>hundreds of years to help</p>
<p>diabetes in other parts of the world so</p>
<p>it helps stabilize your blood sugar and</p>
<p>if you chew a tablet</p>
<p>okay before you eat something sweet</p>
<p>it blocks the taste receptors for sweet</p>
<p>so everything tastes bitter and that</p>
<p>will destroy your pleasure for for</p>
<p>sweets and so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great demonstration to do at a</p>
<p>party if you want to ruin a party real</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>interesting and by the way that question</p>
<p>was from michaela so from facebook so i</p>
<p>hope that uh</p>
<p>answers some of your questions</p>
<p>i have to add one more thing because</p>
<p>like here&rsquo;s the thing though you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ultimately to really fix the sugar</p>
<p>cravings you have to you have to stop</p>
<p>eating sugar for a little period of time</p>
<p>so your body then force uh switches to</p>
<p>burning fat so if you don&rsquo;t ever stop</p>
<p>eating sugar you&rsquo;ll never ever get rid</p>
<p>of the cravings</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>it does take three days to kind of do</p>
<p>that so</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>fasting but if you just stopped eating</p>
<p>sugar right now you probably</p>
<p>tomorrow you still crave it because it</p>
<p>takes it takes a little bit of time to</p>
<p>adapt so i always recommend</p>
<p>reduce the carbs</p>
<p>um below 30 grams and then</p>
<p>uh just give it three days okay and then</p>
<p>the cravings will go away and then now</p>
<p>we know you&rsquo;re burning fat and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a lot easier</p>
<p>to stick to it because guess what</p>
<p>i mean trying to get rid of cravings</p>
<p>with with having cravings is really hard</p>
<p>wow another question um this gentleman</p>
<p>lost 40 pounds on your process but then</p>
<p>when he went to the doctor doctor was</p>
<p>horrified and said he must get off that</p>
<p>and go to vegan and more carbs and so on</p>
<p>he just lost 40 pounds i don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>doctor wanted to get it back</p>
<p>you know steve it&rsquo;s dangerous nowadays</p>
<p>to lose weight because we need to keep</p>
<p>this weight on because i have no clue</p>
<p>what what he&rsquo;s talking about that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>strange you&rsquo;re doing great now change</p>
<p>everything okay i can&rsquo;t imagine why i</p>
<p>said all right let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go</p>
<p>with another quiz question here</p>
<p>the audience is absolutely on it here it</p>
<p>is doc</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>uh what is the only nut</p>
<p>that contains omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>all right jump on that i&rsquo;d be interested</p>
<p>in that i&rsquo;ll start munching on those as</p>
<p>well and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to the</p>
<p>green</p>
<p>green room excuse me and we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have uh the uk</p>
<p>represented uh perfectly by</p>
<p>kish excuse me tisha and so tisha if you</p>
<p>unmute yourself you are on with dr byrd</p>
<p>hello dr berg um nice to be here today i</p>
<p>just want to say i really appreciate all</p>
<p>the videos that you put out um and</p>
<p>although i have very recently started</p>
<p>following them</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s great to to have some</p>
<p>information to fall on</p>
<p>so i started intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>keto on the 13th of this month so</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s the 12th day</p>
<p>i gradually build up to</p>
<p>one meal a day so i&rsquo;m only having one</p>
<p>meal now</p>
<p>uh which is great but my question is uh</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m diabetic as well i was diagnosed</p>
<p>with type 2 last year</p>
<p>i want to try and fast for much longer</p>
<p>now maybe i don&rsquo;t know two days or</p>
<p>something but i want to see if i can i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a vegetarian so can i have vegetarian</p>
<p>broth for it</p>
<p>um and i also wanted to</p>
<p>um ask i have a lot of social events</p>
<p>from work and then social life and so on</p>
<p>and so forth how do i tackle being out</p>
<p>with people</p>
<p>and either not eating</p>
<p>or eating very specific foods i always</p>
<p>struggle with it and i always end up</p>
<p>giving up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the toughest thing</p>
<p>because the social um you can&rsquo;t when you</p>
<p>go into these social events you kind of</p>
<p>go into this</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>state where um you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard because everyone&rsquo;s doing it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like i here have this have</p>
<p>that so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to probably</p>
<p>maybe eat before you go to the social</p>
<p>events so you at least have food in your</p>
<p>mouth or food in your stomach but it is</p>
<p>difficult it&rsquo;s extremely difficult so</p>
<p>keep yourself really busy</p>
<p>you know maybe talking to people and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to just step up your</p>
<p>discipline realize that when you start</p>
<p>um you know</p>
<p>like not giving into it right</p>
<p>when you start doing that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an exercise for uh</p>
<p>for your willpower and it&rsquo;s easier to do</p>
<p>it but versus caving in and you stack up</p>
<p>all these losses so i think um if you</p>
<p>just really can do it a few times it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be easier and easier to the point</p>
<p>where you might get like me and i can</p>
<p>just i can be in a social environment</p>
<p>and i can just keep my discipline</p>
<p>you know implemented um</p>
<p>as far as the broth vegetable broth i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s going to be fine</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s going to be fine because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not dealing with</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>even proteins too much</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just doing with um liquids so</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re going to be fine with</p>
<p>that um just make sure that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like some key nutrients</p>
<p>being i think you said a vegan i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sure if it was a vegetarian or vegan but</p>
<p>you have to make sure you</p>
<p>what was that vegetarian</p>
<p>okay so then you seal your pecan do eggs</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you um you want to get you make make</p>
<p>sure you have your zinc b12 dha make</p>
<p>sure you get those which you probably</p>
<p>already know about um</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll be fine but um</p>
<p>i think um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i would do if i were you</p>
<p>all right thank you so much you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome tisha thanks so much and for</p>
<p>representing the uk so well</p>
<p>and the audience is representing</p>
<p>themselves well by answering these</p>
<p>questions so quickly and the latest one</p>
<p>was what is the only knot that contains</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>opinion on that so uh</p>
<p>35 say walnuts 25 say brazil nuts 20 say</p>
<p>macadamias 10 say pecans and 10 say</p>
<p>almonds who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>the walnut group walnuts have</p>
<p>something called ala which turns into</p>
<p>epa and dha basically</p>
<p>the walnut is the</p>
<p>now i will say i will say this steve um</p>
<p>the pecan has a very tiny tiny tiny bit</p>
<p>of ala but it&rsquo;s just so it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>insignificant i don&rsquo;t even bring it up</p>
<p>but the walnut is the one that has the</p>
<p>omega-3 and it has some other cool</p>
<p>properties i will release a video on</p>
<p>that too but um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>walnuts are typically sold raw and some</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>eat them and they kind of they&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of rancid and sometimes you can you can</p>
<p>just taste it or it might create</p>
<p>gallbladder issues there&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>brand um i would recommend and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>affiliated with this company at all but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sprout organic sprouted uh walnuts</p>
<p>so they literally soak them in water for</p>
<p>48 hours and they</p>
<p>put them through a dehydrator at low</p>
<p>temperatures and man does that they</p>
<p>taste great they don&rsquo;t go rancid you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the enzyme inhibitors you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the phytic acid</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a great thing to have on</p>
<p>keto</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so you might want to try that you can</p>
<p>order them online and</p>
<p>of course i just ordered another three</p>
<p>pounds of it but it&rsquo;s great to have</p>
<p>after a meal and</p>
<p>i like to do the um</p>
<p>maybe have a little</p>
<p>chocolate with that keto friendly but i</p>
<p>do the</p>
<p>the lilies or other brand chocolate</p>
<p>chips that are keto friendly but without</p>
<p>the soluble corn fiber or the tapioca or</p>
<p>the dextrin or the maltodextrin all the</p>
<p>other crap out there so you have to read</p>
<p>the labels on that and the reason i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use the chocolate bars because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re starting to put all these</p>
<p>synthetic fibers in there</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you know we just want the</p>
<p>erythritol monk fruit or stevia and then</p>
<p>the cocoa powder and that&rsquo;s it so i</p>
<p>might do the baking chips with that just</p>
<p>a little bit with those walnuts it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great little dessert after a meal</p>
<p>well there you have it carrie from</p>
<p>youtube uh is asking how much</p>
<p>benfotamine should i take on a daily</p>
<p>basis she didn&rsquo;t mention any sort of</p>
<p>cause</p>
<p>well if you&rsquo;re trying to deal with like</p>
<p>peripheral neuropathy um you want about</p>
<p>you know you i think i would get ones</p>
<p>like like 300 milligrams and take those</p>
<p>four times a day spread them out um and</p>
<p>that just penetrates the myelin sheath</p>
<p>and it can help heal that nerve real</p>
<p>nicely so</p>
<p>yes the</p>
<p>300 milligrams four times a day</p>
<p>very good you lynn from facebook can you</p>
<p>please address what we should do about</p>
<p>brain fog and again she&rsquo;s not sort of</p>
<p>setting up what might have caused that</p>
<p>but is there a general uh</p>
<p>advice for brain fog if someone is brain</p>
<p>fog typically they&rsquo;re not on</p>
<p>the keto and if they are there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something not right</p>
<p>quite a few things can cause brain fog</p>
<p>but the fuel</p>
<p>is the first one if if their blood</p>
<p>sugars are off boy they&rsquo;re just mentally</p>
<p>not quite sharp so you want to lower the</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>and i will say this if you really want</p>
<p>to clear up brain fog start doing</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>like go up to</p>
<p>one meal a day</p>
<p>and fast for a long period of time oh my</p>
<p>gosh your brain becomes so sharp and</p>
<p>just right there you won&rsquo;t have that fog</p>
<p>but as soon as you eat then you all of a</p>
<p>sudden you get foggy so</p>
<p>there are other things too like when</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>have an allergy to dairy that can make</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>have fog if they&rsquo;re doing gluten boy</p>
<p>that can create fogginess</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s certain ingredients even in</p>
<p>these so-called keto-friendly</p>
<p>foods that can create brain fog because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re filled with all these artificial</p>
<p>things so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the fogginess of the brain can be um</p>
<p>from a lot of different things but if</p>
<p>you do the healthy version of keto</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best bet to get rid of brain</p>
<p>fog</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific antoinette from youtube</p>
<p>should we take b complex supplements</p>
<p>along with liquid iron i assume that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not molten at the same time</p>
<p>got to be careful about the b vitamins</p>
<p>uh you want to make sure you get a</p>
<p>natural</p>
<p>blend and that&rsquo;s really hard and even</p>
<p>the natural blends are made from yeast</p>
<p>that have been fed synthetic</p>
<p>b vitamins or from petroleum</p>
<p>so um that being said i think the best</p>
<p>bet is to do the wheatgrass um now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a it&rsquo;s nutritional yeast tablets</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that are unfortified but there are</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>b vitamins like for example when i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>biased of my keto energy</p>
<p>i did find um it was hard to find a</p>
<p>source of b vitamins that came from</p>
<p>actual food</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a little more expensive but i do</p>
<p>have that available</p>
<p>uh as far as liquid iron i would be very</p>
<p>careful i would actually i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>recommend taking any iron supplements</p>
<p>other than</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re going to do like a yeast a</p>
<p>bovine</p>
<p>spleen product or a liver product like</p>
<p>grass-fed liver</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>most of the other iron supplements are</p>
<p>are made from</p>
<p>like elemental type iron which is not</p>
<p>good for your body now if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>female and you&rsquo;re menstruating you need</p>
<p>iron uh</p>
<p>if you just have some you know rare red</p>
<p>meat that would handle it or liver or</p>
<p>liver pills that would be the best</p>
<p>source of iron</p>
<p>terrific why don&rsquo;t we go back to the</p>
<p>green room and this time it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be alma from spain is going to ask a</p>
<p>quick question of you and alma if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unmuted you&rsquo;re on with dr berg</p>
<p>thank you dr bear thank you for having</p>
<p>me on the show</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been watching your videos for the</p>
<p>last six months and i find them very</p>
<p>practical and beneficial</p>
<p>and two years ago i suffered from</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>due to a prolonged physical and</p>
<p>psychological stress with all the</p>
<p>symptoms that go along with it fatigue</p>
<p>brain fog headaches palpitations these</p>
<p>viruses all that and i felt terrible</p>
<p>after a year or so i started to improve</p>
<p>a bit</p>
<p>keeping the stress as low as possible</p>
<p>but i must admit for the last six months</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve noticed a bigger improvement in my</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>by doing intermittent fasting 18</p>
<p>um keeping a low-carb diet and having</p>
<p>some supplements that you recommend in</p>
<p>your videos like</p>
<p>the ribose</p>
<p>the sweet warm wood</p>
<p>big one</p>
<p>and i just watched your last video about</p>
<p>the olive leaf extract</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>what else would you say what you</p>
<p>recommend that i i should take</p>
<p>yeah lemon balm tea is a good thing to</p>
<p>take through the day i&rsquo;m not sure if you</p>
<p>said that one but lemon balm tea is a</p>
<p>good one ashwagandha is a really really</p>
<p>good one and then also go for the long</p>
<p>walks um</p>
<p>and do more physical work outside i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you</p>
<p>for many different reasons it gets your</p>
<p>your mind off things and gets you out of</p>
<p>your head so you can actually</p>
<p>keep the stress</p>
<p>lowered um but that&rsquo;s what i would do um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the right track give a little</p>
<p>bit more time</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>exercise of course is always great but</p>
<p>if you can do physical work that would</p>
<p>be the</p>
<p>absolute best therapy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific well thank you so much</p>
<p>uh alma we appreciate you coming on the</p>
<p>show let&rsquo;s go back to social media this</p>
<p>time nicole from facebook uh who is an</p>
<p>rn i was taught in rn school that weight</p>
<p>is good for bone development as is</p>
<p>exercise could weight loss on keto</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting inhibit bone</p>
<p>development</p>
<p>i think when we&rsquo;re talking about weight</p>
<p>i think they&rsquo;re talking about lifting</p>
<p>weights because just by weighing more</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s going to pull in your bones but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the best way to make your</p>
<p>bones strong</p>
<p>so physical activity um</p>
<p>will strengthen your bones because the</p>
<p>bones are connected to the muscles right</p>
<p>but also vitamin k2 will make your bones</p>
<p>really really strong in solid</p>
<p>not to mention adding the vitamin d with</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>i would get your calcium possible if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a dairy problem from dairy um</p>
<p>and if you do</p>
<p>like from lactose intolerant you can do</p>
<p>the uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you the best ways to try to</p>
<p>find a place in your area that sells raw</p>
<p>milk and make your kefir from raw milk</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dynamite in 53 states now you can</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>get raw milk and make your own kefir so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s just something that i think is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is good because you get all these</p>
<p>probiotics right</p>
<p>um so and you get the calcium more</p>
<p>bioavailable so these are just some</p>
<p>things that i would recommend recommend</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific okay</p>
<p>still on facebook christina</p>
<p>is the keto diet okay for crohn&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disease what a horrible condition that</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>yes yes because</p>
<p>typically with chromosome disease you</p>
<p>have this all this inflammation</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not on keto you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably doing grains and that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>tearing you up not even necessarily</p>
<p>saying that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you have an allergy or a sensitivity to</p>
<p>gluten but you could also have a</p>
<p>a form of</p>
<p>intolerance to gluten that a lot of</p>
<p>people have that it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>test</p>
<p>um and that can just tear up your</p>
<p>stomach and all these grains are high in</p>
<p>omega-6 fatty acids so</p>
<p>i would do that and some people cannot</p>
<p>even tolerate vegetables even on keto so</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your case then you might want</p>
<p>to do the carnivore</p>
<p>diet for a period of time to</p>
<p>heal your gut and that&rsquo;s keto because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s low carb</p>
<p>very good how about another true</p>
<p>falsehood doc</p>
<p>all right good</p>
<p>all right true or false chronic fatigue</p>
<p>and fibromyalgia are usually caused by a</p>
<p>virus</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>dig into that one</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see what else do we have uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go ahead and knock them out in the</p>
<p>green room this time we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>chris from san diego maybe another</p>
<p>surfer dude or i think i heard him</p>
<p>saying he&rsquo;s a long board skateboarder</p>
<p>but you know both great pursuits and</p>
<p>chris if you&rsquo;re unmuted you are on with</p>
<p>dr byrd</p>
<p>good morning from california dr berg</p>
<p>good morning</p>
<p>i i think i&rsquo;ve been uh following your</p>
<p>stuff for 10 years so i really love what</p>
<p>you do thank you so much oh that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>uh i got uh two uh bccs removed and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>started keto to hopefully prevent that</p>
<p>in the future</p>
<p>and my my question and one problem</p>
<p>that i have</p>
<p>is um well the question is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what to do long term as far as ketones</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve started the</p>
<p>keto diet and in the morning my ketones</p>
<p>are about 3.1 or 3.2 something about</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>and i eat um omad so i guess i eat</p>
<p>around 6 p.m so</p>
<p>actually i don&rsquo;t know what they are by 6</p>
<p>p.m they&rsquo;re probably up</p>
<p>around 4 maybe 4.5 i would guess after</p>
<p>that time</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>my question is you know how what to do</p>
<p>long term how long should</p>
<p>what should the ketone levels even be</p>
<p>should they be 1.5 or 3 or over three</p>
<p>especially as far as bcc</p>
<p>um how long do you do this do you ever</p>
<p>add back starches sometimes people say</p>
<p>you should so i don&rsquo;t know about that</p>
<p>and i do have one one problem</p>
<p>i started taking a lot of electrolytes</p>
<p>and i think i did the math wrong</p>
<p>and i was taking about seven grams of</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>and i developed this kind of</p>
<p>sensitivity in my right ear like a</p>
<p>popping every time there&rsquo;s a loud sound</p>
<p>like my ear pops</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite uncomfortable and</p>
<p>slightly worrisome and i was wondering</p>
<p>if you think maybe that&rsquo;s from taking</p>
<p>too much</p>
<p>electrolytes i&rsquo;ve cut out the</p>
<p>electrolytes now</p>
<p>so quick question you did dcc</p>
<p>oh the bcc had basal cell carcinoma ah</p>
<p>bc okay</p>
<p>i thought it was dcc um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>have you been watching the recent videos</p>
<p>on the uh on cancer</p>
<p>yes i have um</p>
<p>all of them</p>
<p>yeah so i&rsquo;m gonna do another one on</p>
<p>monday i&rsquo;m going to actually i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to release a bit i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>actually do the interview on monday and</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;ll probably release it next early</p>
<p>next week but there&rsquo;s a common thread</p>
<p>with this cancer and of course i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>promising any cures for anyone and i</p>
<p>have no</p>
<p>products to sell you for cancer</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain nutritional</p>
<p>protocol that we did a</p>
<p>study and</p>
<p>judd very very favorable in blocking a</p>
<p>certain</p>
<p>pathway and you&rsquo;ll learn about that in</p>
<p>the video</p>
<p>but the biggest thing</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>making cancer go bye-bye is the fasting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting so you may</p>
<p>even</p>
<p>want to contact some of these guys to</p>
<p>you know just get a little bit of</p>
<p>clarification but i will say that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how hard this would be but</p>
<p>to do it 21 day fast that&rsquo;s extreme</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably lose a lot of weight but</p>
<p>that would be extremely therapeutic to</p>
<p>to create a huge huge uh impact now if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll then just</p>
<p>do what you can but uh you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to do regular periodic prolonged fast</p>
<p>not periodic but prolonged fasting</p>
<p>and um that&rsquo;s gonna help you and then if</p>
<p>you get on this nutritional protocol</p>
<p>that we recommend</p>
<p>that would add another layer</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be talking you know each time i do</p>
<p>one of these videos i i learned</p>
<p>something new or refinement of what</p>
<p>someone did and i&rsquo;m going to share that</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i i do have a line of people</p>
<p>for interviews that are just getting</p>
<p>great success but as far as the</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to do with ketosis</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re in ketosis the question is</p>
<p>how deep do you go in ketosis um i think</p>
<p>i think you need to um</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re at a good level you know</p>
<p>i i wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily try to go more</p>
<p>into ketosis i would</p>
<p>because when you actually fast</p>
<p>ketones are not the only thing that are</p>
<p>anti-cancer</p>
<p>there are other factors there&rsquo;s genetic</p>
<p>activation of certain things that can</p>
<p>help you</p>
<p>decrease cancer there&rsquo;s the stimulation</p>
<p>of your immune cells</p>
<p>that are killing cancer cells</p>
<p>so it goes way more way beyond the</p>
<p>ketones but i will say</p>
<p>and i talked about this before you</p>
<p>probably learned about that</p>
<p>but ketones</p>
<p>can provide for the raw material for the</p>
<p>membrane of cancer cells</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>now when you&rsquo;re fasting you have all</p>
<p>these ketones that are available but you</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>have other things going on that can</p>
<p>handle the cancer and so</p>
<p>going on the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>produces ketones that are</p>
<p>create a different situation than</p>
<p>getting ketones from fasting</p>
<p>and this is why</p>
<p>the fasting is like the key with that</p>
<p>but i wouldn&rsquo;t not i would not go</p>
<p>to try to do this um</p>
<p>high carb thing occasionally or reset</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s not going to help you</p>
<p>however the document that you probably</p>
<p>downloaded already</p>
<p>on this protocol does have some carbs in</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>um but you can see it&rsquo;s pretty low</p>
<p>calorie so</p>
<p>um anyway i hope i answer that for you</p>
<p>but um stay tuned next week to</p>
<p>to get a little bit more data but yeah</p>
<p>you want to</p>
<p>you know start doing more fasting and</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know cope with the weight loss a bit</p>
<p>if you can</p>
<p>and any ideas about electrolytes in the</p>
<p>ears oh yeah so um i&rsquo;ve never heard that</p>
<p>before um</p>
<p>and if it did create an effect and you</p>
<p>came off them for maybe a couple weeks</p>
<p>it should go away right</p>
<p>but but</p>
<p>you have to realize even if you took</p>
<p>seven</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>eight or nine or ten grams of</p>
<p>of potassium</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your body has a very efficient way of</p>
<p>getting rid of the excess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like other minerals like</p>
<p>calcium and iron or even sodium</p>
<p>our bodies are very very um</p>
<p>efficient at getting rid of excess</p>
<p>potassium so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know for a fact that was caused</p>
<p>by that or something else but yeah just</p>
<p>maybe stop it and see if it goes away</p>
<p>perfect thank you great well thanks so</p>
<p>much chris enjoy that and we&rsquo;re hearts</p>
<p>always go out to people who are battling</p>
<p>cancer so we wish you um all the well</p>
<p>all the best in that regard and the</p>
<p>audience as usual is really</p>
<p>coming up quick answers and chronic</p>
<p>fatigue and fibromyalgia are usually</p>
<p>caused by a virus</p>
<p>and the audience came back 82 percent</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>only 18 percent say it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>well those people that said false i</p>
<p>would love to know what they thought did</p>
<p>cause chrono fatigue syndrome</p>
<p>fibromyalgia</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of data that points to</p>
<p>both of those conditions being</p>
<p>viral but not a new virus it&rsquo;s an old</p>
<p>virus</p>
<p>being reactivated and we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about epstein-barr</p>
<p>virus</p>
<p>some of these viruses that we have</p>
<p>especially in the area of herpes</p>
<p>um which the epstein-barr virus is</p>
<p>tend to go</p>
<p>in remission or a latent phase and then</p>
<p>when you go through stress years later</p>
<p>it comes out it might come out in</p>
<p>various forms like fatigue or achy</p>
<p>muscles as in fibromyalgia</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>one of the great remedies for that would</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>olive leaf</p>
<p>extract</p>
<p>so it has a certain</p>
<p>phytonutrient that suppresses viruses as</p>
<p>well as helping you with stress</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so we have this uh you also have other</p>
<p>other viruses that like</p>
<p>herpes comes out in a cold sore or</p>
<p>shingles which is a not a herpes but um</p>
<p>can be like a chickenpox virus so</p>
<p>some viruses kind of go in remission and</p>
<p>they kind of come out when you&rsquo;re under</p>
<p>stress so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna say this because um it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important people think i&rsquo;ll just take</p>
<p>this remedy and get rid of my chronic</p>
<p>fatigue</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t get to the real core of</p>
<p>your stress and really address that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably not gonna work so that the</p>
<p>cause of your stress is the most</p>
<p>important thing to focus on and address</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll just keep you</p>
<p>you know keeping that virus keep coming</p>
<p>out over and over and over again</p>
<p>i had a patient</p>
<p>and she had a different type of virus</p>
<p>infection was a type of herpes that just</p>
<p>kept coming out</p>
<p>and it was just driving her crazy and</p>
<p>the problem is that</p>
<p>her stress was coming because she lost</p>
<p>her favorite pet and she just couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to get over it and it just</p>
<p>destroyed her for months and months and</p>
<p>months and months but</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a different situation it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to overcome losses but the point is</p>
<p>that the stress</p>
<p>is the</p>
<p>is a devastating thing for your immune</p>
<p>system because it paralyzes your immune</p>
<p>system and then</p>
<p>allows things to happen and this is why</p>
<p>behind autoimmune diseases you you</p>
<p>always see a stress event that occurs</p>
<p>right before they develop this</p>
<p>autoimmune disease like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up with that and how did that how</p>
<p>did that happen</p>
<p>very interesting okay final question for</p>
<p>the day</p>
<p>all right true or false sweating helps</p>
<p>balance your sodium potassium</p>
<p>ratios for the average american okay</p>
<p>okay climb onto that and i&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>kindred spirit here matt from fairfax</p>
<p>and i got in a lot of trouble in fairfax</p>
<p>as a youth i used to live up there so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re glad to have me</p>
<p>transported to</p>
<p>north carolina and matt if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unmuted you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd</p>
<p>all right hey dr berg um i just want to</p>
<p>say you know</p>
<p>your videos are great um you know a lot</p>
<p>of great information huge fan</p>
<p>uh i&rsquo;ve got a million questions to ask</p>
<p>you you know you guys have to bring me</p>
<p>back i think but we&rsquo;ll focus on the main</p>
<p>thing but i do want to say some ideas i</p>
<p>just want to know you know avocados</p>
<p>should be organic should my mushrooms be</p>
<p>organic you know should my uh olive oil</p>
<p>be organic but those aren&rsquo;t as important</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get to why i came to you and why i</p>
<p>discovered your channel why i&rsquo;ve got so</p>
<p>much great information from your channel</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve been dealing with gerd um</p>
<p>overeating constipation so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>specifically talk about your pills i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>worried about the ginger</p>
<p>and the um and the even more so the</p>
<p>peppermint in your pills i&rsquo;ve heard a</p>
<p>lot about peppermint can relax your</p>
<p>lower esophageal sphincter um and so you</p>
<p>know i have been taking ginger in the</p>
<p>past and um you know just a few weeks</p>
<p>ago i started taking ginger with the</p>
<p>digestive enzyme am i i&rsquo;m really fit uh</p>
<p>you know i probably have honestly</p>
<p>watching our videos i&rsquo;ve realized that</p>
<p>bradycardia maybe i have a heart rate of</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>but anyway lowering my blood</li>
</ol>
<p>pressure i just went to the doctor and i</p>
<p>have you know at about you know i think</p>
<p>it was ginger ginger or the enzymes but</p>
<p>i was getting light-headed standing up</p>
<p>anyways i need to find a relief that</p>
<p>works for this um</p>
<p>gerd and i think apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>vinegar has been helping but i need to</p>
<p>take it up a step and um and so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking into your pills but like i said</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m worried about uh</p>
<p>the potential of what i&rsquo;ve heard about</p>
<p>how peppermint you should avoid when you</p>
<p>have gerd and then the thing with the</p>
<p>ginger in there and then also</p>
<p>tied to that question that would be</p>
<p>should i be worried about chocolate as</p>
<p>well since it has caffeine so</p>
<p>okay um good question</p>
<p>so so it&rsquo;s one of those things you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have to just test it out because for</p>
<p>most people</p>
<p>peppermint</p>
<p>different spearmint all these different</p>
<p>mints there&rsquo;s quite a few of them as</p>
<p>well as ginger</p>
<p>helps</p>
<p>with the lower part of your digestive</p>
<p>tract and i&rsquo;m talking about right right</p>
<p>when it gets beyond the stomach into the</p>
<p>small intestine and it has a an effect</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>reducing spasm in your with for bloating</p>
<p>it increases bile release</p>
<p>so it does help with that um to my</p>
<p>knowledge i don&rsquo;t know of any instance</p>
<p>that it actually aggravated</p>
<p>gerd but then again we want to actually</p>
<p>just focus on what</p>
<p>those are just kind of like</p>
<p>assistance type ingredients the main</p>
<p>remedy is the betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>which actually will acidify the stomach</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>because the ph now is more acid then</p>
<p>that valve will close</p>
<p>so you have that and then</p>
<p>zinc is another good one for gerd um</p>
<p>but also uh sea salt is good for gerd</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and especially working on</p>
<p>your um</p>
<p>microbiome a really good probiotic will</p>
<p>be essential for gerd</p>
<p>um and then also looking at your food</p>
<p>you mentioned i think you you</p>
<p>have not mistaken you</p>
<p>eat</p>
<p>a lot of food or i don&rsquo;t know if you eat</p>
<p>overeat but</p>
<p>when you we have gerd it&rsquo;s because that</p>
<p>fasting is really so here&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>hey i tell you what matt we&rsquo;re breaking</p>
<p>up a little bit and we&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>against the clock so i would ask that uh</p>
<p>perhaps you uh you know come on</p>
<p>backwards</p>
<p>so steve let me just let me just i want</p>
<p>to really answer this one so i&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>uh if you can just finish what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying what was that</p>
<p>good matt</p>
<p>oh so so yeah as far as overeating i</p>
<p>have been</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>um the last um you know</p>
<p>two weeks</p>
<p>since i started</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;ve started seeing your videos</p>
<p>but i have a problem you know i want to</p>
<p>get all the nutrients i feel i need you</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;m trying to eat two three meals i</p>
<p>feel like you know i chew very slowly so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to tell sometimes my meals</p>
<p>will last a while but i try to chew very</p>
<p>slowly</p>
<p>but you know i think i over train which</p>
<p>also be why i need more nutrients that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing i learned from your videos</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m making a lot of changes but uh</p>
<p>you know um yeah it&rsquo;s a situation</p>
<p>because if you have a girder</p>
<p>go ahead</p>
<p>and could we answer that about the</p>
<p>caffeine should i worry about caffeine</p>
<p>and chocolate like is that something</p>
<p>that may relax my as well i know you you</p>
<p>answered the peppermint i think the um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not even the caffeine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the other things in chocolate that can</p>
<p>aggravate gerd you have a lot of um</p>
<p>polyphenols are called and</p>
<p>other things in chocolate that can</p>
<p>aggravate the digestive system more than</p>
<p>the caffeine um</p>
<p>but um it&rsquo;s going to be one of those</p>
<p>things i think you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>test out different foods because</p>
<p>i do know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to get the nutrients but</p>
<p>as you do more fasting the requirement</p>
<p>for nutrients goes down also when you do</p>
<p>fermented vegetables</p>
<p>it increases the amount of nutrients</p>
<p>tremendously so that the cabbage the</p>
<p>kimchi would give you way more than</p>
<p>regular vegetables so</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;ll have to just test it out</p>
<p>and then also come back on our channel</p>
<p>to ask more questions because</p>
<p>um looks like we are running out of time</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah thanks for that question and uh</p>
<p>hopefully that can help you</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>awesome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thanks so much matt we</p>
<p>appreciate you coming on with us and</p>
<p>look forward to hearing back from you</p>
<p>again by the way the final question we</p>
<p>got through them all today and it asked</p>
<p>are true false or sweating helps balance</p>
<p>sodium potassium ratios for an average</p>
<p>american and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>the average american answer uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>uh 55 say it&rsquo;s true 45 say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>kind of a toss up</p>
<p>yeah so i&rsquo;ll release the video on this</p>
<p>but here here&rsquo;s the thing an average</p>
<p>american on the mar average american</p>
<p>diet which probably is not</p>
<p>too</p>
<p>dissimilar to people eating around the</p>
<p>rest of the world</p>
<p>but well it is worse but it&rsquo;s not as bad</p>
<p>but the thing is that um an average</p>
<p>person is consuming</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re heavy on the sodium</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very very very light on the</p>
<p>potassium so by sweating you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>releasing</p>
<p>um very much potassium you are releasing</p>
<p>some but you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re mainly releasing</p>
<p>sodium so you are going to balance this</p>
<p>sodium potassium ratio</p>
<p>if you eat</p>
<p>like most americans eat</p>
<p>so this is why they might feel better</p>
<p>after sweating of course when they start</p>
<p>eating again they start eating heavy on</p>
<p>the sodium there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>bad with sodium as long as your</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>is at least</p>
<p>twice as much or three times as much as</p>
<p>your sodium to balance that ratios out</p>
<p>so the ratios are more important than</p>
<p>the total numbers</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll do a video on this to give you more</p>
<p>data but um</p>
<p>anyway i just really appreciate all your</p>
<p>questions all your attention all the</p>
<p>wonderful comments on the videos</p>
<p>stay tuned for some real interesting</p>
<p>videos that i&rsquo;m coming up with even</p>
<p>today i&rsquo;m going to do another one that</p>
<p>that i think you&rsquo;ll like</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll see you next week as well as</p>
<p>tomorrow morning when i release the next</p>
<p>video</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
