<p>to queer snapping their fingers</p>

<p>net and click the link you can</p>
<p>get 15 off you just put the codename brogan in</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fine instrument for masturbation</p>
<p>we need to get them to send some more</p>
<p>people keep on asking guess yeah we gotta give em away</p>
<p>we gotta get a box but now that chris is gone i</p>
<p>gotta contact the new dude and</p>
<p>this is the only</p>
<p>sponsor that we have for this podcast there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>other way to</p>
<p>you know i know</p>
<p>some people like to put up these</p>
<p>donation things and donate</p>
<p>money we don&rsquo;t have one for this podcast</p>
<p>but brian has one for his</p>
<p>death squad tv yeah and we talked about this yesterday</p>
<p>brian what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically doing</p>
<p>is making this little sort of a homemade sort of a</p>
<p>studio and you</p>
<p>know becoming like a little network</p>
<p>and the crazy thing is</p>
<p>you know we know so many</p>
<p>funny people we know so many</p>
<p>comics we know</p>
<p>so many hilarious dudes that are really interesting</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not on the radio they</p>
<p>should be on the radio</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>what radio is now is</p>
<p>regular radio is just fucking songs</p>
<p>dudes don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talk at all there&rsquo;s no personalities it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>kevin bean and a few</p>
<p>local stations in austin and a few</p>
<p>other places but</p>
<p>everywhere else</p>
<p>you go it&rsquo;s just nonsense and then you got</p>
<p>satellite radio but</p>
<p>you know i love</p>
<p>satellite radio but</p>
<p>satellite radio is fucking hurting man</p>
<p>they cut back on serious cut back people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>budgets by like eighty fucking percent or something</p>
<p>crazy bubba the love</p>
<p>sponge isn&rsquo;t on anymore</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just crazy that we know so many</p>
<p>comics from hanging out that</p>
<p>local comedy clubs that</p>
<p>these guys like</p>
<p>tebe and all</p>
<p>these guys would</p>
<p>never ever have a chance</p>
<p>to ever meet</p>
<p>these people so it&rsquo;s kind of cool doing</p>
<p>these podcasts</p>
<p>because we get to introduce you to people that we know</p>
<p>that you would probably never know</p>
<p>unless they made it</p>
<p>yeah and they</p>
<p>probably wouldn&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>right they probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t make it well love</p>
<p>these really</p>
<p>funny guys are fucking</p>
<p>crazy and lazy</p>
<p>yeah you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crazy they&rsquo;re lazy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>brian holzman perfect example</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a talented guy but you know who the fuck is ever</p>
<p>gonna hear about</p>
<p>him yeah you know</p>
<p>pete johansson the guys coming over</p>
<p>today he&rsquo;s got like a hundred</p>
<p>twitter twitter followers yeah</p>
<p>so hilarious</p>
<p>hilarious guy</p>
<p>and you know he&rsquo;s supposed to be here at</p>
<p>three but he thought</p>
<p>it was four so we decided to kick it off without him</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s another guy you know</p>
<p>hilarious comic</p>
<p>and what brings you to the</p>
<p>dance as a comic</p>
<p>oftentimes it&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>from what you need to</p>
<p>establish a</p>
<p>successful business</p>
<p>as an entity as</p>
<p>jeff foxworthy or</p>
<p>or you know</p>
<p>brian redband you know</p>
<p>if you wanna like</p>
<p>put your name out there you have to</p>
<p>start thinking</p>
<p>marketing yeah</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where like dane cook was the master</p>
<p>like he figured out how to do that way before anyway i</p>
<p>never put any consideration to any of that shit at all</p>
<p>i always thought we just did your</p>
<p>stuff and then they put you on tv and then it worked</p>
<p>you know you didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about all that stuff</p>
<p>but then i realized well then you&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>mercy of these</p>
<p>other people to put you on tv</p>
<p>whereas the internet like i&rsquo;m on the internet</p>
<p>every day and for whatever reason i</p>
<p>never thought well fuck i</p>
<p>should like</p>
<p>promote myself on the internet like i</p>
<p>never even thought of it you know</p>
<p>share yourself yeah like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why constantly</p>
<p>updating by twitter and facebook and just</p>
<p>anything is</p>
<p>so important for a</p>
<p>comic and then when you talk to</p>
<p>these comics</p>
<p>and like i don&rsquo;t have a twitter i don&rsquo;t have a facebook</p>
<p>or you know</p>
<p>or pete as an example he has two</p>
<p>twitter accounts but</p>
<p>he has one that&rsquo;s his name and one that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other crazy name</p>
<p>escarus or something like that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like why aren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>using the one with your name</p>
<p>what the fuck is</p>
<p>escarious it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing i mean guys like</p>
<p>tebe you know</p>
<p>tebe&rsquo;s hilarious but</p>
<p>tebe has never made a living as a comedian</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s been doing comedy for like 17 years</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s always had other jobs</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like what what makes your comic</p>
<p>often times is this</p>
<p>weird for sort of slacker</p>
<p>way of looking at</p>
<p>things you know like ari</p>
<p>ari&rsquo;s notoriously lazy yeah you know i mean jokes</p>
<p>about it all the time</p>
<p>right wakes up</p>
<p>at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon all the time you know</p>
<p>sleeps on pizza</p>
<p>boxes he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy yeah that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>comics are they&rsquo;re nuts yeah</p>
<p>but but this twitter</p>
<p>thing man and facebook and this u stream</p>
<p>thing and itunes it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re entering into a</p>
<p>whole new different</p>
<p>world i know you know and</p>
<p>i guess donations are a good way to do it</p>
<p>really cause instead of saying you know hey i want</p>
<p>fifty bucks a</p>
<p>month or whatever the fuck you</p>
<p>would ever ask me</p>
<p>never ask for that much but</p>
<p>you know a year</p>
<p>what the hell whatever the hell you</p>
<p>would ask you know</p>
<p>like you can</p>
<p>get this level</p>
<p>membership and you can come in a meet and greet and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 300 like</p>
<p>that always seems so fucking</p>
<p>weird you know yeah it&rsquo;s sort of like how i feel</p>
<p>about like bittorrence it&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>when i download</p>
<p>something you know if i download something</p>
<p>and i like it i always buy the band</p>
<p>yeah you know whatever the fuck it is yeah and the only</p>
<p>time i&rsquo;ve ever downloaded something that i didn&rsquo;t own</p>
<p>was when there was no</p>
<p>other way to get it</p>
<p>right like danward&rsquo;s a perfect example</p>
<p>i saw that and i saw the cd</p>
<p>cover and like fuck i</p>
<p>wanna own that</p>
<p>exactly that is a</p>
<p>great cd and</p>
<p>i want that</p>
<p>right but as soon as it came out</p>
<p>i ordered it on itunes immediately i put it on</p>
<p>both computers</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s important to</p>
<p>let people fucking</p>
<p>you know donate</p>
<p>things you know like</p>
<p>for something like this for the podcast i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s like a perfect way to do it yeah you know</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>charge a certain amount of</p>
<p>money for something like that you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the future there&rsquo;s enough</p>
<p>fucking people out there you know you can make enough</p>
<p>money weasel</p>
<p>yeah i like to donate</p>
<p>things so much better like the trent reznor</p>
<p>kind of way of doing it he puts his cds out you</p>
<p>could donate he even has special</p>
<p>limited edition cds that you</p>
<p>could pay for</p>
<p>if you want to but it&rsquo;s pretty much donation based</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s badass</p>
<p>that to me seems like such a fucking</p>
<p>even way to do it</p>
<p>because people</p>
<p>literally pay you what they</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s worth right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it should be</p>
<p>right absolutely</p>
<p>so ether on the</p>
<p>first place you know what you&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>weird connection with all</p>
<p>these other people you know how do you how do you</p>
<p>quantify that in you know in x per month and</p>
<p>was it yeah what is it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy when you&rsquo;re getting paid by a tv show</p>
<p>or paid by a</p>
<p>comedy club or a theater or something like that</p>
<p>but with the the</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>about the podcast is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going directly to people it&rsquo;s just you and the people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no middleman</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s someone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna handle the</p>
<p>money and put</p>
<p>the ones and zeros and bank accounts somewhere but</p>
<p>other than that it&rsquo;s just you and</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>absolutely you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a trap toad</p>
<p>speaking of you and</p>
<p>these people you hear</p>
<p>about that broad in egypt</p>
<p>uh the one i got</p>
<p>raped porter</p>
<p>fuck dude this is horrific man</p>
<p>especially having daughters</p>
<p>you know i i think</p>
<p>about shit like this in a different way</p>
<p>you know this this</p>
<p>chick was over there and</p>
<p>apparently she got separated from her camera crew and</p>
<p>they beat her and raped her for a half an hour i know</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know the extent of the beating or the extent of the</p>
<p>sexual assault</p>
<p>whatever it was i mean</p>
<p>it was slight</p>
<p>it would have been horrific and terrifying</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>significant because she&rsquo;s in the hospital</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t she with like a cameraman in a crew</p>
<p>though i don&rsquo;t know what happened well i</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>total complete</p>
<p>chaos i mean</p>
<p>you gotta think</p>
<p>about the situation in egypt is</p>
<p>they had a dictator</p>
<p>the same guy running</p>
<p>everything for 31 years</p>
<p>i mean this guy just</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t fucking go</p>
<p>and and they overthrew him with the internet</p>
<p>supposedly maybe</p>
<p>cia to the cia</p>
<p>probably yeah</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t fucking ever</p>
<p>trust that anything that happens in another country</p>
<p>that we just let shit happen</p>
<p>right you know i mean</p>
<p>whenever like like</p>
<p>that valerie</p>
<p>i forgot how the</p>
<p>zero last name plan</p>
<p>plan p the one that</p>
<p>one of the it wasn&rsquo;t dick</p>
<p>changing maybe donald romsfeld one of those guys</p>
<p>outed her as</p>
<p>an undercover cia</p>
<p>agent because</p>
<p>her husband</p>
<p>had done something that pissed them off testified</p>
<p>against him i don&rsquo;t know what the circumstances were</p>
<p>but you know they</p>
<p>found out that she was an</p>
<p>undercover cia</p>
<p>agent well how many of them are there well</p>
<p>there might be</p>
<p>fucking there&rsquo;s tons</p>
<p>tons of them we probably are friends with two of them</p>
<p>well i know one</p>
<p>there is one well i know one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one son for sure one</p>
<p>son a buddy of</p>
<p>mine who&rsquo;s a good friend</p>
<p>his dad&rsquo;s been the cia his whole life</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t know his dad was in the cia</p>
<p>till he was in his 30s right</p>
<p>he thought his dad worked</p>
<p>well i wanna say</p>
<p>what his dad did but</p>
<p>think of it this way you get on a</p>
<p>plane there&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>least two undercover</p>
<p>marshals is on</p>
<p>every flight most big</p>
<p>planes you know like real flights not like here to</p>
<p>vegas you know but like most big flights</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like one or two</p>
<p>guys on the plane</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>sat do they</p>
<p>carry guns yes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve sat next to him before and they</p>
<p>start you start talking to him and then</p>
<p>they tell you that they are i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re supposed to but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done it to me and many</p>
<p>people i&rsquo;ve talked to before have done that but if you</p>
<p>think of it that way that&rsquo;s like one out of 400 people</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s on a</p>
<p>plane how many people in real life do we know</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely big difference between undercover</p>
<p>marshals who are there to protect your safety</p>
<p>and the idea</p>
<p>these undercover cia</p>
<p>agents who are just manipulating shit abroad</p>
<p>i mean how many of</p>
<p>them are working in various industries and they think</p>
<p>i mean that was like a</p>
<p>famous quote from</p>
<p>c one of the former heads of the cia that every</p>
<p>single person of any significance in</p>
<p>the media has been compromised</p>
<p>yeah definitely</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hilarious you know like whenever you see like</p>
<p>famous actors like at the</p>
<p>white house like shaking hands with people and you know</p>
<p>what is that all</p>
<p>about what are they doing i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but can you</p>
<p>imagine jimmy fallon having some kind of</p>
<p>secret cia thing</p>
<p>going on yeah</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>think that i mean that&rsquo;s fucking some total</p>
<p>alex jones shit</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;d be a good question</p>
<p>well i guess they</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>say yeah but you</p>
<p>could look in</p>
<p>their eyes and see if it</p>
<p>blinks for a</p>
<p>second like</p>
<p>to ask who would</p>
<p>you just like just go up to</p>
<p>jimmy fallon</p>
<p>like hey jimmy fallon hey how&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>going and then just</p>
<p>lay it on him and look</p>
<p>right in his eyes and just see what like if he</p>
<p>sees that little you see that little like what the it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty much likely that a comedian</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be in the cia</p>
<p>except for dennis miller</p>
<p>dennis miller i</p>
<p>think that guy turned</p>
<p>he turned republican and conservative hard so quick</p>
<p>he became so weird</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>chill now it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>weird he was in a</p>
<p>video there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>video and it</p>
<p>was on my twitter i put it up from a few days ago</p>
<p>and it was bill o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>and it was all about the</p>
<p>obama healthcare</p>
<p>thing that he had a guy on his show</p>
<p>and the guy</p>
<p>bill o&rsquo;reilly was accusing the guy of</p>
<p>lying about fox news</p>
<p>and you know the guy was saying that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve said on fox news that if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have health insurance they can lock you in jail</p>
<p>so bill o&rsquo;reilly&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>you know that is some part you</p>
<p>know this is</p>
<p>ridiculous you didn&rsquo;t get this here like you have to</p>
<p>admit that you made this up</p>
<p>so then the</p>
<p>video stops and then they show a montage</p>
<p>of fox news reporters saying</p>
<p>that you can go to jail if you don&rsquo;t have health care</p>
<p>over and over and over</p>
<p>and over i mean it&rsquo;s embarrassing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous it&rsquo;s more that bill o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>bluster shit you know he&rsquo;s like one of those</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those dudes who puffs his</p>

<p>dummy he&rsquo;s like an ego dummy</p>

<p>crazy voicemail on that</p>

<p>voice of conservative</p>
<p>reason and he&rsquo;s trying to fuck this</p>
<p>chick with a loofah</p>
<p>sponge and shit</p>

<p>giant fucking montage of</p>
<p>these fox news reporters</p>
<p>and then they show</p>
<p>dennis miller on bill o&rsquo;reilly&rsquo;s show</p>

<p>well it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>cleaning like if you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>around like taking</p>
<p>trash out like mopping</p>
<p>floors and what what size</p>
<p>shoes do you wear uh tens</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m wearing the lebanon</p>
<p>try them on oh</p>
<p>dude church right on</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to try them on</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>wrong size and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sweaty like</p>
<p>jelly meanwhile i don&rsquo;t mind doing jiu jitsu</p>
<p>you know if i actually thought</p>
<p>about what jiu</p>
<p>jitsu was while i was doing it</p>
<p>while someone</p>
<p>sweating on you because it&rsquo;s like a man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chest sweat</p>
<p>right on your face all the time</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s very rare in</p>
<p>light that you get a man&rsquo;s chest wet</p>
<p>on your face for more than</p>
<p>twenty minutes if you&rsquo;re not homosexual</p>
<p>and or italian</p>
<p>seems like you</p>
<p>would be like a lot</p>
<p>italian guys always have</p>
<p>shirts off with</p>
<p>the you know and you&rsquo;re just always around for</p>
<p>twenty minutes holding on your head yeah</p>
<p>wearing wife</p>
<p>peter takes a long time</p>
<p>to get a guy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sweaty brian</p>
<p>it ain&rsquo;t that easy now when you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>stick ball joe and</p>
<p>the streets</p>
<p>of new york</p>
<p>i played stick ball when i was a kid yeah</p>
<p>i love it so ridiculous</p>
<p>funny east coast</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m trying to what</p>
<p>did use as like like</p>
<p>you know first base</p>
<p>second base</p>
<p>third of it</p>
<p>did you used to like lasagna</p>
<p>boxes or something we use whatever was around you know</p>
<p>whatever was around you know sometimes you&rsquo;d use a car</p>
<p>like first base was the corner of this car you had to</p>
<p>touch the bumper</p>
<p>you know and second</p>
<p>it would have sucked if you</p>
<p>lived in our neighborhood</p>
<p>right because</p>
<p>first of all there was like</p>
<p>when i was growing up</p>
<p>and in fact</p>
<p>when i lived in jamaica playing</p>
<p>especially because</p>
<p>i was a poor neighborhood and there was a lot of</p>
<p>crazy kids there</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>we would play on the street</p>
<p>all the time like you</p>
<p>would literally go outside your</p>
<p>house and you go into the</p>
<p>street and the</p>
<p>street was the playground</p>
<p>we would play</p>
<p>stick ball in the</p>
<p>street we would play catch we</p>
<p>would do like</p>
<p>crazy hide and seek</p>
<p>things and shit</p>
<p>we played right in the</p>
<p>street all the time</p>
<p>so if your car was parked in the</p>
<p>street your car was in a playground</p>
<p>i mean balls were</p>
<p>bouncing off your car and</p>
<p>louis had to stop games</p>
<p>because cars were coming i mean that was like standard</p>
<p>standard was the kids played in the streets do you</p>
<p>think if you had</p>
<p>video games when you were a kid you</p>
<p>would not be playing stick bog</p>
<p>oh for sure</p>
<p>stickball industry must be hurting with</p>
<p>the marble industry it was also</p>
<p>it was also that you know it&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awkward you know when you when you&rsquo;re fourteen it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when i was in fourteen it was</p>
<p>twelve or eleven</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to hide</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s easy to hide when you&rsquo;re shy</p>
<p>when things bother you</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>these boys out there you don&rsquo;t know who they are they</p>
<p>might beat you up fuck</p>
<p>this i&rsquo;m staying inside it&rsquo;s easy but when you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>forced to go outside and you&rsquo;re forced to like</p>
<p>interact with all</p>
<p>these people but if i had</p>
<p>video games back then</p>
<p>and i was nervous at</p>
<p>going and hanging out with</p>
<p>these weird puerto rican</p>
<p>kids and these</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>irish hooligans there was like</p>
<p>these fucking hooligans in my neighborhood</p>
<p>i went from living in</p>
<p>florida we lived in gainesville in</p>
<p>like a university community because my dad was</p>
<p>going to school</p>
<p>and he transferred over to the</p>
<p>architectural institute of boston</p>
<p>and when he</p>
<p>i forget what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>that might not be the actual name but anyway</p>
<p>he when he transferred over to that we didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>money and so we</p>
<p>lived in this really</p>
<p>shitty neighborhood it was our fucked up house too</p>
<p>and it was just</p>
<p>a lot of bad kids man just a lot of bad kids</p>
<p>like kids were</p>
<p>drinking already hardcore</p>
<p>at like thirteen</p>
<p>they were getting fucked up they were having sex</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ve never been around anybody that was had sex</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>they were all fucked</p>
<p>they were all fucking and they were fucking this one</p>
<p>chick that lived up the street</p>
<p>she was 20 and she</p>
<p>would fuck anybody</p>
<p>so these 13 year old kids</p>
<p>would go over and fuck her and it&rsquo;s like whoa</p>
<p>this girls knew how to</p>
<p>dress too they had like the cut off jean</p>
<p>shorts with too many holes in it you</p>
<p>could just see her butthole and you&rsquo;re just like dude</p>
<p>so funny that you say that she</p>
<p>always wear cut off jean</p>
<p>shorts with bleach</p>
<p>remember used to bleach your</p>
<p>jeans like i said just pour bleach on my</p>
<p>jeans in my basement and</p>
<p>just sit there overnight and then wash them and they</p>
<p>would just be these big</p>
<p>white spots all over your</p>
<p>jeans how ridiculous is it</p>
<p>gonna be when you look back in time at these</p>
<p>jeans that you&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>right now with</p>
<p>artificial holes in them no i fell off a</p>
<p>motorcycle joe what are you talking about</p>
<p>i stitch it back together yeah you know</p>
<p>times are kind of</p>
<p>tough right now</p>
<p>meanwhile you pay</p>
<p>extra for these</p>
<p>jeans that are fucked up i don&rsquo;t know if you pay</p>
<p>extra anymore i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re used to but now i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the normal when you pay</p>
<p>extra now to not have them</p>
<p>fucked up i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s backwards now like</p>
<p>skinny jeans and shit like that</p>
<p>colored jeans</p>
<p>door dash purple coat jordans</p>
<p>are way more expensive than just a jean that has</p>
<p>a hole in it i don&rsquo;t get it i can&rsquo;t wear most of the</p>
<p>jeans in the</p>
<p>first place cause i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>built like a</p>
<p>troll right</p>
<p>so i have to wear</p>
<p>jeans that have wide legs wow</p>

<p>working at a kiosk for verizon he&rsquo;s got the</p>
<p>skinny jeans on</p>

<p>class you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get tapped out alright this is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to go up there</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>learn you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to</p>
<p>learn how to jedi knight this</p>
<p>motherfucker it was</p>
<p>weird how bad my</p>
<p>nerves hit me in uh florida that</p>
<p>the first time i went on</p>
<p>stage remember i said my stomach hurt</p>
<p>i was in pain like somebody</p>
<p>felt like somebody</p>
<p>stabbed me and</p>
<p>twisted it and</p>
<p>ripped my insides for like a good 20 minutes well</p>
<p>when did we</p>
<p>tell you that you were</p>
<p>gonna go up was it</p>
<p>right before you went up yeah</p>
<p>right before</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably what it was</p>
<p>if you had the</p>
<p>whole day to</p>
<p>think about it and</p>
<p>prepare yourself</p>
<p>but when it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>ready go then you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>oh shit this is too much this is too confusing yeah i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ll be good now i go up so much now it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i think that west palm</p>
<p>beach was just so huge that was like 700</p>
<p>800 people that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they had 650 i</p>
<p>think they had tv</p>
<p>screens halfway through though and had the</p>
<p>whole ufc thing were like halfway through people were</p>
<p>watching the tv</p>
<p>screens and talking more than they were in the front</p>
<p>there was a lot of times</p>
<p>where i was like yeah i did good but</p>
<p>then you talk to somebody that was sitting in the back</p>
<p>it was all right man</p>
<p>you know like it was</p>
<p>weird because people talked in the back i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the people on the</p>
<p>front yeah that&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>shape club too it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s so big</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird shape it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great club and we had a good time there</p>
<p>but when you get a big</p>
<p>anytime things get too big</p>
<p>it gets real risky</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s why we had to stop doing the</p>
<p>house of blues</p>
<p>when we were doing people</p>
<p>standing up we</p>
<p>would do it and</p>
<p>the show would</p>
<p>turn to chaos</p>
<p>because everybody</p>
<p>that was sitting down it was cool but there was</p>
<p>500 people that were standing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really hard to corral</p>
<p>that many people once they&rsquo;re drinking</p>
<p>and once there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other people talking and milling around like a bar</p>
<p>but you feel like you&rsquo;re at a bar</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re at a bar you&rsquo;re not quiet</p>
<p>like you know and when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching comedy on a tv even though it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>front of you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not cool</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s i think</p>
<p>i think four</p>
<p>hundreds the max four</p>
<p>or five hundred people</p>
<p>max well we talked</p>
<p>about larry the</p>
<p>cable guy who does like football stadiums that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>weird that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>i mean i need to see that i saw it on josh wolf&rsquo;s phone</p>
<p>he showed it to me because josh was opening for</p>
<p>him and he goes look at this we did a football stadium</p>
<p>and i looked at him and i&rsquo;m like that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even look real</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many fuck is that work though</p>
<p>i mean i would</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s just your no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you have to all be</p>
<p>quiet a stadium of</p>
<p>people have to be</p>
<p>quiet going</p>
<p>me speaking of</p>
<p>quiet i forgot to shut my refrigerator up</p>
<p>it just seems like if it&rsquo;s a stadium</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s not being</p>
<p>quiet it&rsquo;s just a clusterfuck</p>
<p>of people talking and having fun</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a guy in the middle talking</p>
<p>how does that work that just does</p>
<p>not seem like it works</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just such huge fans of his that they could</p>
<p>never get enough</p>
<p>shows in at a a theater</p>
<p>like you and even a fucking</p>
<p>arena man even like the staples</p>
<p>center i mean think</p>
<p>about what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing like</p>
<p>three full staples</p>
<p>centers a night and</p>
<p>how does seinfeld do that like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s deal with like tacos</p>
<p>i mean how does that</p>
<p>work with that many people that just seems like</p>
<p>it just does a shit it</p>
<p>never works as good</p>
<p>the real bottom line</p>
<p>about a big big show</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s something that you gain</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much energy and there&rsquo;s so many people</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that you lose like there&rsquo;s a little bit of a</p>
<p>connection that you lose</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never done anything like that the most i&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>is probably those</p>
<p>kevin and bean shows we did like six or</p>
<p>seven thousand people</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>fucking big</p>
<p>those were awesome</p>
<p>but like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about as big as i&rsquo;ve ever done that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>crazy in and of itself</p>
<p>you know but when you talk</p>
<p>about fifty</p>
<p>fifty thousand</p>
<p>how the fuck do you</p>
<p>how do you connected</p>
<p>fifty thousand people</p>
<p>seems impossible it seems like you</p>
<p>would have to do it with music and</p>
<p>they were all high as fuck</p>
<p>then i think you</p>
<p>could pull it off or if they</p>
<p>passed out like mouth like</p>
<p>things over</p>
<p>their mouths you</p>
<p>had to take</p>
<p>their mouth off you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be too far</p>
<p>from them though that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing the thing is the distance if you can</p>
<p>figure out a way to get 50 000 people</p>
<p>all on top of you like</p>
<p>maybe you were in like some</p>
<p>sort of a balcony like on tron</p>
<p>no bottom to it and you</p>
<p>enter into this giant</p>
<p>void of people</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like a hundred</p>
<p>star levels</p>
<p>like the star exactly like when</p>
<p>luke skywalker</p>
<p>when he got his hand</p>
<p>chopped off yeah</p>
<p>that kind of shit yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>would work yeah you&rsquo;d have to have people</p>
<p>everywhere they couldn&rsquo;t just be</p>
<p>just in front of you</p>
<p>right this doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense does it no no</p>
<p>i just think you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t have too many people to show it won&rsquo;t be the same</p>
<p>thing i like fucking</p>
<p>three hundred people i always say that</p>
<p>three hundred people is the most</p>
<p>you know i like</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s we do</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s comedy</p>
<p>holds like eighty people</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do that</p>
<p>every week folks</p>
<p>not this wednesday</p>
<p>cause we when i want to overstay</p>
<p>welcome not</p>
<p>today yeah tonight</p>
<p>but next week</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost sold out already</p>
<p>is it really yeah and and if if</p>
<p>once i get the</p>
<p>guest list completely a hundred percent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be probably the biggest</p>
<p>coolest show</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen yeah we got a</p>
<p>crazy line up</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t we can&rsquo;t even say who&rsquo;s on the lineup</p>
<p>the people are</p>
<p>weird like that comments</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want anyone to know that i&rsquo;m working on new material</p>
<p>just go up there and eat dick</p>
<p>every now and then yeah come on</p>
<p>we gotta try new shit</p>
<p>you know these clubs like little clubs like sal&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best for</p>
<p>trying out shit</p>
<p>little like tiny little intimate rooms</p>
<p>you know you really know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>i like what doug benson though said</p>
<p>the last time sao&rsquo;s comedy pull</p>
<p>because of the pullaway</p>
<p>that was so</p>
<p>funny yeah he</p>
<p>freaked me out though</p>
<p>cause he said it</p>
<p>right before i was</p>
<p>going on stage</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to go on</p>
<p>stage and you&rsquo;re trying to get into your family</p>
<p>line and someone&rsquo;s just talking to you yeah</p>
<p>south comedy</p>
<p>poles you call it cao&rsquo;s comedy</p>
<p>pole and i was like whoa</p>
<p>gotta get away from you quickly</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>enter into my head</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re going on</p>
<p>stage now do you have a very specific</p>
<p>thing that you try to say right away</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing it pretty</p>
<p>steady now for what six</p>
<p>months now yeah</p>
<p>i know i pretty much</p>
<p>at sal&rsquo;s every day i just pretty much</p>
<p>tried new ways</p>
<p>to do bits or all new bits like just practicing like</p>
<p>see if there&rsquo;s something there like</p>
<p>you know at</p>
<p>least at least</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a reason to go forward</p>
<p>on certain bits</p>
<p>and then sometimes it&rsquo;s like last</p>
<p>night i just thought of this</p>
<p>whole new way to do all my bits like</p>
<p>a story that goes over all</p>
<p>these little stories like another</p>
<p>layer i guess</p>
<p>to make it sound more natural</p>
<p>so that was a huge step in</p>
<p>my stand up last</p>
<p>night was just doing it</p>
<p>doing my act now different</p>
<p>that makes it more real instead of</p>
<p>going hey i was in this</p>
<p>hotel in vegas last week</p>
<p>which was true</p>
<p>but it also</p>
<p>sounds like i&rsquo;m doing a bit</p>
<p>so now i have this way that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about my mom doing</p>
<p>these podcasts and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>and then i start kind of</p>
<p>going into bits</p>
<p>of things i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about on the</p>
<p>podcast do you find yourself wanting to make</p>
<p>errors in your personal life so that you have material</p>

<p>i need a new five minutes</p>
<p>and just called no</p>
<p>i have never i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never thought</p>
<p>of that as for bits or anything but i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve thought</p>
<p>of that just to keep life interesting</p>
<p>definitely well as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking life&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be interesting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>

<p>gonna do something</p>
<p>stupid yeah</p>
<p>absolutely you know</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re single and trying to</p>
<p>prove yourself to girls and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still not sure</p>
<p>even that it&rsquo;s just being out of the</p>
<p>house and not</p>
<p>watching tv but</p>
<p>drinking when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking and you&rsquo;re trying to make</p>
<p>something happen with a girl i mean come on oh yeah</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it gets the most</p>
<p>ridiculous right</p>

<p>would be on your fucking you</p>
<p>stream thing that</p>
<p>would be like the best</p>
<p>thing ever i mean if i</p>
<p>could no no that</p>

<p>if you guys said something stupid</p>
<p>but i wouldn&rsquo;t i</p>

<p>story what happened</p>
<p>my friend michelle</p>
<p>sure you yeah that&rsquo;s cool i</p>
<p>say the first name</p>
<p>she was having like</p>
<p>she told us to go to this club</p>
<p>where there was like it was a bondage bar i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before where</p>
<p>there was like</p>
<p>naked girls</p>
<p>crawling on this net</p>
<p>above you like on the ceiling</p>
<p>and there were</p>
<p>naked girls</p>
<p>serving you</p>
<p>drinks and dancing around but it wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>strip club it</p>
<p>was just a bar that you were allowed to like a bondage</p>
<p>bar or something i don&rsquo;t know what it was called</p>
<p>but anyways</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going there and we</p>
<p>go to this table and it was</p>
<p>one of the service</p>
<p>table like tequila and</p>
<p>a person making</p>
<p>drinks around it</p>
<p>and i was just hanging out there and</p>
<p>suddenly i just looked to the</p>
<p>right of me and i&rsquo;m sitting</p>
<p>this was lindsay lohan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>table and i</p>
<p>was like i guess they knew each other and</p>
<p>and so i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>standing there staring at her like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just dazed off like oh my god that&rsquo;s lindsay lohan</p>
<p>and it was one of those</p>
<p>things where she</p>
<p>started staring at me like</p>
<p>why is this guy staring at me and my eyes were like</p>
<p>glazed over and i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize it and then she just did that face like the</p>
<p>what the fuck dude</p>
<p>you know typeface</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like oh</p>
<p>hi how&rsquo;s it going</p>
<p>and i said something like</p>
<p>small talk and then she just like turns around</p>
<p>walks up this door the back</p>
<p>alley door passes out in her car</p>
<p>the next morning on</p>
<p>tmz there was the</p>
<p>famous picture</p>

<p>and i had this</p>
<p>moral conundrum and good for you yeah it&rsquo;s</p>

<p>would have been a little</p>
<p>bitch yeah she</p>
<p>got your little</p>
<p>things here and there you</p>
<p>would have had to eat her ass it</p>
<p>would have been terrible</p>
<p>i love eating ass i don&rsquo;t even care if i know somebody</p>
<p>do you want to be in the room for this</p>
<p>you should see</p>
<p>her ass it&rsquo;s like a fucking a little heavenly dot</p>
<p>okay what did i say earlier</p>
<p>oh too much</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>it looks like the</p>
<p>skull i used to have</p>
<p>most of this is</p>
<p>gonna be on itunes</p>
<p>so people can&rsquo;t see what the fuck we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>we do this part of it is for you</p>
<p>stream now and you</p>
<p>stream is like oh</p>
<p>like not even a</p>
<p>quarter of what it</p>
<p>is not even</p>
<p>close a very</p>
<p>clearly an eighth and it</p>
<p>sabotages our itunes anyway so it&rsquo;s kind of like well</p>
<p>people like it though</p>
<p>a lot of people like just watching</p>
<p>you know they like doing it at work</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>like to tune into it almost like it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>weird fucking ghetto tv show</p>
<p>i guess the new</p>
<p>thing is subscribed</p>
<p>subscriptions anyway so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about views it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about subscribe subscribe subscribe</p>
<p>this is a this is the camera</p>
<p>right here yeah this is like</p>
<p>when i get the free chat sort of</p>
<p>thing on the</p>
<p>girl on the bed going</p>
<p>like this yeah</p>
<p>yeah do you</p>
<p>yeah if you explain it to my wife they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start recognizing her and going over to ichat</p>
<p>do you do you ever do those</p>
<p>those video</p>
<p>things i do</p>
<p>i do with my wife</p>
<p>you do with her oh when you guys are on the road yeah</p>
<p>skype pretty</p>
<p>nasty ones but what is up with those</p>
<p>those chicks that like they sit in</p>
<p>their room and then they just</p>
<p>do requests</p>
<p>from guys on the internet is that what they do</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you rent a room it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>doing a private</p>
<p>dance with a stripper but you do it on</p>
<p>video you know give credit cards and you</p>
<p>could tip if</p>
<p>hey like put this in your butthole i&rsquo;ll give you an</p>
<p>extra 20 it&rsquo;s kind of like you know</p>
<p>how big of a business</p>
<p>is that it must be huge that&rsquo;s pretty much what</p>
<p>porn stars are</p>
<p>relying on to live</p>
<p>right really yeah</p>
<p>with piracy</p>
<p>right now i</p>
<p>think people want the intimacy</p>
<p>issue of those</p>
<p>things and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they make the most of the</p>
<p>money cause</p>
<p>everybody just pirates all the porn right now</p>
<p>right yeah and none of the</p>
<p>studios are making much</p>
<p>money i was just a friend of mine runs</p>
<p>bluebird which</p>
<p>is one of the bigger</p>
<p>porn companies and</p>
<p>the piracy is killing them yeah of</p>
<p>course it was a huge business you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>their business has been gutted</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really kind of</p>
<p>funny because</p>
<p>who decides what business is</p>
<p>worthy of a bailout you know</p>
<p>yeah we talked about that</p>
<p>you know if you think</p>
<p>about that man</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been hit</p>
<p>harder than the porn companies yeah the valley</p>
<p>could use some lifting</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s weird though i mean</p>
<p>why is it okay</p>
<p>if this part of the economy fails in this not</p>
<p>like why is that</p>
<p>same it&rsquo;s considered</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s considered like</p>
<p>cigarettes it&rsquo;s considered a advice</p>
<p>yeah really though i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weird call when it gets to like billions</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the billions of dollars</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s dissolved and it&rsquo;s done through piracy</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>no one gives a shit</p>
<p>about the piracy</p>
<p>like all those sites you porn euges</p>
<p>from what i</p>
<p>understand the laws of like copywriting clips</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s like really difficult</p>
<p>to copyright sex</p>

<p>would get from someone who would tell you not to</p>
<p>smoke pot on a</p>
<p>podcast where you&rsquo;re obviously baked out of your head</p>
<p>yeah i need to get a volcano you need to get a volcano</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s anyone in the volcano company</p>
<p>no they ain&rsquo;t gonna give you anything free bitch</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not watching this</p>
<p>we have the different type of</p>
<p>vaporizer we have the wooden case one</p>
<p>yeah those are good too they did but</p>
<p>they burn out</p>
<p>really quickly do they well you&rsquo;re a fucking</p>
<p>savage you&rsquo;re burning out vaporizers</p>
<p>jesus we&rsquo;re on number three right now really</p>
<p>dude it might be time to call doctor drew</p>
<p>burning out wait i gotta chill out i</p>
<p>gotta go pick up my mom at the hotel oh yeah</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s getting baked as fuck</p>
<p>his mom&rsquo;s gonna come over his house with a</p>
<p>black light and search for loads</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna see</p>
<p>tron it would</p>
<p>have been way better if i didn&rsquo;t cough on loads</p>
<p>your entire room would look like tron</p>
<p>with all the black light</p>
<p>reflection just like</p>
<p>streams of races you ever watch</p>
<p>those shows on the wall like a little</p>
<p>stupid it would be</p>
<p>a maze i could probably play a game</p>
<p>you ever watch those exposes</p>
<p>where they go to hotel rooms and scan everything with</p>
<p>black lights i hate that horrific for somebody</p>
<p>that lives in hotels you live in</p>
<p>hotels too like i can&rsquo;t deal with that like</p>
<p>crazy they showed this</p>
<p>thing about bacteria content of the covers</p>
<p>cause they never washed the</p>
<p>covers in the or the cups have you ever seen the cups</p>
<p>cause they don&rsquo;t take the cups down to the dishwasher</p>
<p>they fucking sit there and wash</p>
<p>them in the sink and sometimes people are just like</p>
<p>wash it out put it in there</p>
<p>they fucking like took a</p>
<p>sample off the cup and it was like</p>
<p>crazy shit like</p>
<p>feces and like</p>
<p>it was bad yeah i</p>
<p>think was feces</p>
<p>everywhere in line or something</p>
<p>so how many people are</p>
<p>naked just sitting around with their</p>
<p>naked asshole</p>
<p>touching the</p>
<p>couch and touching the office</p>
<p>chair come everywhere i had</p>
<p>friends stay at my</p>
<p>house that did that</p>

<p>while obviously</p>
<p>they try too hard</p>
<p>i asked him to</p>
<p>leave and he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>weird thing when people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna leave</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>you have someone over your</p>
<p>house you tell them to</p>

<p>out how did the curb</p>
<p>step if you&rsquo;re not in love with yourself</p>
<p>first oh you do you</p>
<p>should have a fucking</p>
<p>motivational</p>
<p>speeching career</p>
<p>you should do you</p>
<p>should have a cd you</p>
<p>should be late at</p>
<p>night i can see you a</p>
<p>suit and a tie</p>
<p>maybe a wacky tie something with polka</p>
<p>dots but you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so happy and smiling nobody cares</p>
<p>i mean look at my mansion remember that guy the fucking</p>
<p>vietnamese dude with so real estate it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah look at my car</p>
<p>look what i have here</p>
<p>i can do that</p>
<p>voice cause my wife&rsquo;s asian</p>
<p>what was his</p>
<p>name what was that guy&rsquo;s name you know all the</p>
<p>asians what&rsquo;s his name</p>
<p>you guys are tight right yeah</p>
<p>you guys all work together to take over the</p>
<p>world what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the deal with the little</p>
<p>shark got the money</p>
<p>the guy was on the late</p>
<p>night thing</p>
<p>where he was selling</p>
<p>whatever was on my phone</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s phone</p>
<p>the guy the late</p>
<p>night thing he was selling real estate</p>
<p>yeah yeah he had the two girls with them in</p>
<p>the car and</p>
<p>like a rolls royce or something like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny because that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>first generation immigration to the us always has that</p>
<p>reflective of the</p>
<p>idea what they</p>
<p>think the us is</p>
<p>versus what it truly is</p>
<p>right you know and that</p>
<p>first reflection view of it is it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>lots of flashy wealth</p>
<p>tell me pete johansson as an outsider</p>
<p>as a non american</p>
<p>what is it you&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a double agent</p>
<p>remember what we were saying</p>
<p>earlier about cia</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a cough</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a sleeper canadian</p>
<p>so what is america america is</p>
<p>is actually</p>
<p>sounds corny but america the</p>
<p>thing that separates</p>
<p>americans from everybody else is that sort of</p>
<p>sublime unkillable hope</p>
<p>like they always</p>
<p>say like if you meet american eventually</p>
<p>someday they all believe that one day they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be rich</p>
<p>and they vote now in case</p>
<p>for when that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>canadians don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be rich ever</p>
<p>wow we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>as long as we don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>fired at the post office you know</p>
<p>is that why canadians</p>
<p>are friendlier</p>
<p>is that why</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re friendlier i mean is it good to have</p>
<p>that hope and be cunty because you&rsquo;re chasing it down</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s better to be</p>
<p>completely honest</p>
<p>with you because</p>
<p>i mean some of the</p>
<p>greatest things in the</p>
<p>world have taken</p>
<p>place because of that ambition</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>at the same</p>
<p>point some of the most</p>
<p>compassionate</p>
<p>things in the</p>
<p>world take place because</p>
<p>i think of a</p>
<p>lot of the canadian principles and ideas we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>compassionate people yeah it&rsquo;s a fine fucking</p>
<p>dance isn&rsquo;t it yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a fine</p>
<p>dance between the two ideas</p>
<p>and that the problem with the american is it that</p>
<p>that go get it and go get them</p>
<p>fucking chase down your</p>
<p>dreams all that</p>
<p>leads to a lot of douchebags well yeah not everybody</p>
<p>i mean not everybody who&rsquo;s ambitious is douchey</p>
<p>about it well this is the</p>
<p>harry potter</p>
<p>generation too like</p>
<p>everybody expects</p>
<p>these great</p>
<p>things to show up now</p>
<p>and that drive to create</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore</p>
<p>like i mean we&rsquo;re raising our</p>
<p>kids telling them special without telling them that hey</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not special you&rsquo;re all exactly the same but</p>
<p>you can work hard and become special well they&rsquo;ve also</p>
<p>introduced this new</p>
<p>thing the celebrity lottery</p>
<p>by way of reality shows now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>the lottery</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about anybody with any</p>
<p>talent whatsoever there&rsquo;s nothing fascinating</p>
<p>about them they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a great job</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just fucking retards</p>
<p>and if you follow</p>
<p>these retards</p>
<p>around you get to know who they are and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden the fucking</p>
<p>story takes</p>
<p>place because</p>
<p>now you know her and you know she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like dab and tony used to date her</p>
<p>and fuck i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>locked into this now and you know how many of</p>
<p>those shows they will fall around</p>
<p>nothing fucking</p>
<p>happens so they have to artificially create tension</p>
<p>by writing it in that&rsquo;s how shitty</p>
<p>their lives are dude that&rsquo;s why duncan</p>
<p>trussell didn&rsquo;t do the comedy</p>
<p>store one when they were doing one of the comedy</p>
<p>store the reason why he</p>
<p>he stepped out of it he didn&rsquo;t want to do it</p>
<p>they were they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna like create</p>
<p>things artificial</p>
<p>things we have to</p>
<p>argue this we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to</p>
<p>lunch and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>but nobody likes it then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to</p>
<p>second place</p>
<p>and nobody likes it then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to</p>
<p>third place you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get in a big</p>
<p>argument you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna settle in the</p>
<p>third place it was like</p>
<p>ridiculous nonsense shit like to create</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>following like how&rsquo;s this end how&rsquo;s it end like</p>
<p>just enough to get that</p>
<p>low watt frequency</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re half</p>
<p>awake and barely paying attention you&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>engaged at all</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re following this fucking nonsense</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in yeah the the the the cusp of what they consider</p>
<p>entertainment now is just so fucking</p>
<p>what is it though</p>
<p>what why is that</p>
<p>check is it because people are fucking</p>
<p>tired is it</p>
<p>like you get home from work and you&rsquo;re exhausted</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re working all day chasing a</p>
<p>dream and most people are</p>
<p>in debt and they just want some nonsense escape without</p>
<p>too much thinking there&rsquo;s enough wealth in our western</p>
<p>society that we don&rsquo;t have to work this hard to survive</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sort of being run on a treadmill on purpose</p>
<p>well sort of</p>
<p>is that true though because</p>
<p>the financial</p>
<p>system is so fucking</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s so complicated</p>
<p>and entangled if you diet</p>
<p>divided up the top</p>
<p>even half of the top wealth in this country</p>
<p>still allowing them to be wealthy but at a half percent</p>
<p>half of what they are you&rsquo;d have enough to to raise</p>
<p>almost everybody out of poverty in this country</p>
<p>right but you</p>
<p>could never do that then mean what are you</p>
<p>gonna do you</p>
<p>gonna make them give up</p>
<p>their money</p>
<p>is it you gonna you know make them fork over half</p>
<p>their cash because they were more</p>
<p>successful than everybody else and its</p>
<p>success is a</p>
<p>relative term if i</p>
<p>could argue</p>
<p>against pure unadulterated</p>
<p>capitalism there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>infrastructure on some</p>
<p>level that is dependent</p>
<p>upon the creation</p>
<p>of the entire society be it the highways the</p>
<p>phone lines</p>
<p>this code of laws that the way we</p>
<p>treat ourselves sure they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>beneficial of that</p>
<p>thing which is society therefore</p>
<p>right but it</p>
<p>will tell us</p>
<p>to use our system in</p>
<p>order to succeed to a certain degree sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a certain amount of resources but do you</p>
<p>think that the wealthy man</p>
<p>deserves to pay much more resources than the poor man</p>
<p>or should it be a percentage of what they earn</p>
<p>a percentage of what they earn</p>
<p>it should be</p>
<p>a flat percentage of what they earn across the</p>
<p>board but i</p>
<p>think where they really</p>
<p>should get dinged is at death</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe in inheritance that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>but what if you want</p>
<p>your kids to have it it&rsquo;s your wish you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>steal that guy&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>no you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>you had a son and your son was an awesome guy and he</p>
<p>loved to surf and</p>
<p>you know and you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want him to have to get a job be like look bro i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna give you</p>
<p>my million dollars and then you</p>
<p>live a frugal life and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never have to work</p>
<p>again and then you</p>
<p>could just surf</p>
<p>a little bits fine but i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>not fucking my all my</p>
<p>money i want to give it to my kids a million</p>
<p>bucks no way that just produces a fucking</p>
<p>a monarchy or a royal</p>
<p>class of douchebag</p>
<p>why is that so no why is that true no if you have</p>
<p>money that you want to give to a kid</p>
<p>you love your kid and you want to</p>
<p>leave him your</p>
<p>money you&rsquo;re saying you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get your</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>all of it no</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely ridiculous</p>
<p>so you think the government</p>
<p>should come in and regulate</p>
<p>where your money goes</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>encourage them to give it away before they die you know</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s gonna go it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go to government</p>
<p>agencies that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>go it&rsquo;s gonna get</p>
<p>chopped up the carnegie foundation</p>
<p>foundation or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get tax or</p>
<p>chopped up or perhaps</p>
<p>some of the</p>
<p>great foundations that have</p>
<p>changed the face of the</p>
<p>world and philanthropy</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>a different way to go like the rockefeller society</p>
<p>these these</p>
<p>groups have done and created</p>
<p>great systems of art that</p>
<p>would have created without</p>
<p>their money but no</p>
<p>or you can hold</p>
<p>on to both your little hands and then government</p>
<p>prize it out and</p>
<p>builds a highway</p>
<p>yeah but why</p>
<p>would anyone have the</p>
<p>right to say what you can and cannot</p>
<p>leave for your children</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s your your you</p>
<p>made that money it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>money make it</p>
<p>money itself is kind of an illusion of debt</p>
<p>against the whole</p>
<p>okay but you were far more</p>
<p>successful than most and you accumulated a</p>
<p>mass amount of whatever the fuck you want to call money</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>remnant of your work</p>
<p>and if you decide that you want to give it to your kid</p>
<p>maybe your kid has an idea</p>
<p>maybe your kid wants to invest</p>
<p>an incredible amount in</p>
<p>clean energy</p>
<p>and fucking</p>
<p>dedicated himself</p>
<p>to that but whatever the fuck he wants to do</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s your kid</p>
<p>no why should you have to</p>
<p>why would you have more</p>
<p>government evasion</p>
<p>in your life who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna run these</p>
<p>foundations i disagree</p>
<p>fucking weirdos man</p>
<p>probably i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like it most of the people in government i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think governments the answer to a lot of</p>
<p>things but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that we</p>
<p>should be creating hierarchical</p>
<p>sort of niches in society</p>
<p>reflective of the feudalist</p>
<p>domination that we used to have when we were surfs</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what this concentration of wealth that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>divided after</p>
<p>that is created</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>cause what if this guy</p>
<p>built it up from scratch</p>
<p>all on his own he wants to give it to his children</p>
<p>because they aided him and get into that position by</p>
<p>giving him a</p>
<p>stable family and giving him love and support</p>
<p>that enabled him to be super</p>
<p>successful if their</p>
<p>kids aided them</p>
<p>in the creation of it then the kids earned</p>
<p>money on the process and they</p>
<p>should have lots of</p>
<p>money from their own endeavors on the same</p>
<p>on the same path like the walmart family</p>
<p>wow dude that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>crazy socialism</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s social it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely socialism</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not on the microphone</p>
<p>hold on a second</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you people</p>
<p>know how to just plug into the wall like r2d2</p>
<p>what are you saying</p>
<p>i was just saying you would obviously</p>
<p>you would leave your kid enough</p>
<p>to be able to survive and have a great life</p>
<p>the only money that would go to the government or</p>
<p>to the country would be excess wealth</p>
<p>not not by whose judgment is excess wealth</p>
<p>excess wealth to sylvester</p>
<p>stallone is different than excess wealth to brian</p>
<p>but it would be</p>
<p>in the amount that</p>
<p>anything is comfortable</p>
<p>yeah i just i think that</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>there should be a recreation of how we</p>
<p>strive after things i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>money is the best answer to</p>
<p>things and i think that we&rsquo;ve came up with</p>
<p>capitalism i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think socialism is the answer or communism</p>
<p>but i think that we should evolve past currency at some</p>
<p>point we should be trying to do something else</p>
<p>i mean if you could only make a certain amount of</p>
<p>money and then you got like</p>
<p>titles or more rights and certain things like that i</p>
<p>think that would be more appealing on some levels</p>
<p>you know creating the gentleman</p>
<p>class creating</p>
<p>exclusionary areas that people that strive to sort of</p>
<p>you know be more</p>
<p>people would call that social engineering yes</p>
<p>exactly is that good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t know it</p>
<p>depends on whose engineering really i mean the divine</p>
<p>enlightened person</p>
<p>not one how</p>
<p>about all of them</p>
<p>throughout history everyone gets to a position of</p>
<p>power absolute</p>
<p>power without a</p>
<p>doubt corrupts</p>
<p>absolutely it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an age old quote for a reason you know</p>
<p>yeah and the</p>
<p>system will fall down and be man</p>
<p>of dicks dicks work for</p>
<p>you when you come from canada because it works there</p>
<p>yeah you know what i mean it</p>
<p>completely works nobody strives to be</p>
<p>super rich because your</p>
<p>quality of life won&rsquo;t be that much different than being</p>
<p>people strive</p>
<p>everybody in</p>
<p>every group there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be both</p>
<p>striving to be</p>
<p>great you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think your quality of life is</p>
<p>better if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>rich than if you&rsquo;re not no in canada it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better but it&rsquo;s not like it</p>
<p>the difference between poor and rich is much</p>
<p>greater here okay like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the richest guy</p>
<p>in a city like the city i come from it&rsquo;s 90 000 people</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re the richest guy in that city and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like middle</p>
<p>class or lower</p>
<p>class in that city you have</p>
<p>a general quality of life in that city</p>
<p>about equal if not a</p>
<p>maybe a little</p>
<p>worse because</p>
<p>maybe they have</p>
<p>something cool in their</p>
<p>house i would not</p>
<p>trust social</p>
<p>engineering to too many people you know i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think many people</p>
<p>would have the</p>
<p>right intentions and once they get into a position of</p>
<p>power it&rsquo;s up to them to decide</p>
<p>where money goes and which</p>
<p>you know which</p>
<p>agencies get allocated</p>
<p>so i mean i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust them i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>not not by a long</p>
<p>shot i&rsquo;m with you with not</p>
<p>trust but i see what you&rsquo;re saying on</p>
<p>paper i see what you&rsquo;re saying on</p>
<p>paper but i&rsquo;m saying that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t be striving to be</p>
<p>better than what we are now</p>
<p>where we wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust people like this</p>
<p>yeah but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the way is</p>
<p>the real way is to encourage philanthropy and</p>
<p>love and to encourage it though but not to mandate it</p>
<p>not to get in and</p>
<p>decide by some</p>
<p>group of people just</p>
<p>gank someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>resources because they left this dimension</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many people that</p>
<p>exist right now that i i</p>
<p>that are and</p>
<p>maybe this is probably naive</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>existed all throughout time but they&rsquo;re just more</p>
<p>in the eye of</p>
<p>the meteor people or whatever</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen a</p>
<p>level of greed that i&rsquo;ve seen now</p>
<p>in this generation</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s natural</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>natural of course because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from when we&rsquo;re pack animals we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>surviving and</p>
<p>fighting for</p>
<p>every little</p>
<p>thing we get our paws on to mate and survive and eat</p>
<p>but at some</p>
<p>point i mean</p>
<p>now that we&rsquo;re all kind of fat</p>
<p>you know maybe we should</p>
<p>start working on not being so</p>
<p>greedy you know like and that</p>
<p>level of greed shouldn&rsquo;t be sort of rewarded by this</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think greed should be reward on the</p>
<p>level compassion should be education should be</p>
<p>all these other society is propelled forward by</p>
<p>technology and innovation</p>
<p>and success for each</p>
<p>individual person has moved to money</p>
<p>it used to be</p>
<p>status in society not</p>
<p>for all of them</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s just take an example</p>
<p>of the 1800s in new york let&rsquo;s say you made your</p>
<p>money through spurious means let&rsquo;s say you were a loan</p>
<p>shark if you will you&rsquo;re very wealthy in society you</p>
<p>still couldn&rsquo;t get a reservation</p>
<p>at most fine</p>
<p>places because you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t a gentleman</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t considered of the</p>
<p>class or the ilk that they</p>
<p>would like to</p>
<p>serve and that</p>
<p>sounds awful in</p>
<p>modern day terms because we&rsquo;re this</p>
<p>egalitarian evil</p>
<p>society well the</p>
<p>system it defines</p>
<p>people but to a certain degree</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something wonderful about</p>
<p>ascertain to a</p>
<p>status in society as well as a wealth in society</p>
<p>you know like respect</p>
<p>respect by how</p>
<p>though isn&rsquo;t the respect and no that&rsquo;s family respect</p>
<p>family it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i mean isn&rsquo;t like with caste</p>
<p>systems isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>where you come from</p>
<p>what kind of a this</p>
<p>would be an earned</p>
<p>gentlemen so you</p>
<p>would create a new cast system</p>
<p>you follow a code of</p>
<p>being being fair and just and</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always good to do that you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always good to be fair and just and nice to people i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what we have to encourage instead of</p>
<p>deciding where people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>money goes and doesn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too much government</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s too many people too many people fucking with</p>
<p>money too many people become</p>
<p>greedy too many people</p>
<p>engage in corruption i mean</p>
<p>politicians</p>
<p>have shown themselves over and over and over</p>
<p>again to be embedded with corruption to</p>
<p>the point where it&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>i mean corruption</p>
<p>house how&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funding right</p>
<p>campaign funding</p>
<p>in london you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never solve a problem this country</p>
<p>until campaign</p>
<p>funding is gone i hundred percent agree</p>
<p>not a single</p>
<p>thing can be tackled and that</p>
<p>people have to abandon the idea of a two</p>
<p>party system</p>
<p>too we have to abandon the idea that</p>
<p>these two people are</p>
<p>the only ideas out</p>
<p>there and that they&rsquo;re diametrically opposed from each</p>
<p>other and they&rsquo;re battling constantly</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ridiculous most of us are hybrids</p>
<p>most of us are a conglomeration of conservative and</p>
<p>liberal thinking and</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>they pit ideas</p>
<p>against each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s ideas</p>
<p>to keep this</p>
<p>battle back and forth because it goes with our</p>
<p>monkey tribal instincts</p>
<p>to be on a fucking team</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a problem so our</p>
<p>whole political</p>
<p>system is a problem i</p>
<p>agree our whole financial</p>
<p>system is a problem but</p>
<p>as long as everyone is playing the</p>
<p>capitalist game</p>
<p>which is what they are</p>
<p>i mean everybody that works is playing this</p>
<p>capitalist game</p>
<p>just because someone&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker at it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you get to take his ball when he dies</p>
<p>you know i mean he gets</p>
<p>to do whatever the fuck he wants with that if we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>gonna play this game</p>
<p>i see what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>though that we shouldn&rsquo;t play all this game and then if</p>
<p>the society was utopian</p>
<p>and if society was if we really came to some</p>
<p>point of enlightenment</p>
<p>where we really</p>
<p>treated each</p>
<p>other like brothers and sisters</p>
<p>and all kind of worked together and instead of money</p>
<p>figured out some</p>
<p>strain sort of a barter</p>
<p>system or get what you need</p>
<p>because i know you have good character and you</p>
<p>contribute because you&rsquo;re conscientious</p>
<p>have that like a universal across the</p>
<p>board thing</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>an enlightened</p>
<p>being but that&rsquo;s not what we are now</p>
<p>we should be</p>
<p>trying to evolve</p>
<p>we should be</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of the goal</p>
<p>maintaining the</p>
<p>status quo doesn&rsquo;t help us as a</p>
<p>as a creature</p>
<p>as a and we</p>
<p>should always be striving to become this better thing</p>
<p>well you are we are you are</p>
<p>you are we are</p>
<p>ok until two days well</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not hurting anybody you&rsquo;re doing comedy</p>
<p>spreading fun</p>
<p>everywhere you go</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s not i mean we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>defining the</p>
<p>whole group</p>
<p>together right</p>
<p>and i think there&rsquo;s a lot of enlightened people</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>things a lot differently</p>
<p>than they were</p>
<p>10 years ago or 20 years ago it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>changing people</p>
<p>because of this</p>
<p>because the internet is because we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>talking to each</p>
<p>other and also because</p>
<p>the internet&rsquo;s</p>
<p>allowing some extreme</p>
<p>points of view to come</p>
<p>and talk to each</p>
<p>other where they are forced to be isolatory before</p>
<p>especially i</p>
<p>think when it comes to</p>
<p>i mean everybody&rsquo;s arguing that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>allowing the fringe</p>
<p>groups to become more</p>
<p>radical and it does to a certain degree but at the same</p>
<p>point you can</p>
<p>reach out in an</p>
<p>instant and communicate with somebody</p>
<p>from a deferring</p>
<p>point of view now yeah</p>
<p>whereas you</p>
<p>never used to do that if you grew up in a really tiny</p>
<p>white town in idaho</p>
<p>or whatever you know like that you</p>
<p>might not ever meet another race</p>
<p>yeah whatever</p>
<p>and so i think that</p>
<p>as much as people are complaining of this is</p>
<p>bring us way more together than we&rsquo;ve ever been</p>
<p>yeah i agree with you i</p>
<p>agree with you i</p>
<p>agree with you i</p>
<p>mean when do you look at the sheer numbers i mean there</p>
<p>should be fights and</p>
<p>deaths all the</p>
<p>street all day</p>
<p>it should be you know the sheer numbers of people this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many goddamn</p>
<p>people it&rsquo;s amazing that people are killing each</p>
<p>other more than they are</p>
<p>yeah you know it really is amazing</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>especially with the driving here there&rsquo;s a message</p>
<p>board that i go to and one of the reasons why go to it</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the the</p>
<p>mixed martial arts dot com</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s an interesting message</p>
<p>board because there&rsquo;s a lot of intelligent</p>
<p>people and there&rsquo;s a lot of like</p>
<p>super retards on there too</p>
<p>and the super retards will jump on and the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the same</p>
<p>story with these lips</p>
<p>like they used like</p>
<p>libs talk and</p>
<p>you know and oh my</p>
<p>god and it goes the</p>
<p>other way too there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>dudes who shit on conservatives</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even know what the fuck they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about my brother just</p>
<p>directed a film called atlas shrugged</p>
<p>and i heard of it and ran</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s an incredibly</p>
<p>right wing of</p>
<p>philosophy did</p>
<p>this just get done</p>
<p>it just the</p>
<p>trailer just went up on you but i</p>
<p>go on and i was</p>
<p>reading all the comments on it and it&rsquo;s all left ring</p>
<p>right right wing</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this massive argument i&rsquo;m like both sides</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>idiots you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>silly you pick</p>
<p>a fucking team it&rsquo;s like you pick an argument</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting because we have some</p>
<p>completely different</p>
<p>point of views when it comes to economics</p>
<p>obviously you have a very milton freed monetz</p>
<p>sort of point of view no i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>inside the workings of this society without</p>
<p>completely recreating it yes</p>
<p>but if you want to</p>
<p>completely recreate it i</p>
<p>agree with you yeah</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m just saying that</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>playing this</p>
<p>game that&rsquo;s a lovely pragmatism and i respect that</p>
<p>completely because you do</p>
<p>in the actual function of</p>
<p>things we have to work with what we have that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>the healthcare</p>
<p>thing like the</p>
<p>whole thing with</p>
<p>obamacare and stuff</p>
<p>like that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>caused such a turmoil and</p>
<p>stuff like that and i kind of</p>
<p>agree it doesn&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna work that well</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s very important to be</p>
<p>aware of all the goodness</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important to be</p>
<p>aware of your own ideas of</p>
<p>evolution your own ideas of you know of looking at</p>
<p>things in a more loving and</p>
<p>peaceful way</p>
<p>but you also gotta be</p>
<p>aware that a lot of dudes are cunts you know</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t let cunts get in the way it does but</p>
<p>why do they become cunts because life&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause their</p>
<p>parents didn&rsquo;t raise em</p>
<p>right most of it</p>
<p>most of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their parents or some terrible</p>
<p>thing happened to them when they were</p>
<p>young or you know just shitty</p>
<p>household lots of</p>
<p>abuse that came from an awful</p>
<p>like my parents were</p>
<p>awful abusive and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably why you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>introspective</p>
<p>because you were forced to</p>
<p>think on your own i</p>
<p>think a lot of astounding people that i&rsquo;ve met a lot of</p>
<p>exceptional people have come from some</p>
<p>point of great strife</p>
<p>the universe</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t create diamonds</p>
<p>you know just by pillows</p>
<p>smashing together</p>
<p>some shit has to happen</p>
<p>albinos i was</p>
<p>watching powder last</p>
<p>night he&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>i think he was hit by</p>
<p>lightning or is that john travolta</p>
<p>which one was hit by</p>
<p>lightning which one</p>
<p>why is there so many</p>
<p>movies about retards who become</p>
<p>super fucking</p>
<p>smart it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the new wolf man well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s again that</p>
<p>harry potter fantasy nobody</p>
<p>wants to work hard at being a</p>
<p>genius they don&rsquo;t want to have to fucking study</p>
<p>but boy if some</p>
<p>lightning would</p>
<p>strike and all of a</p>
<p>sudden i can do a</p>
<p>calculator i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>apple dumpling gang</p>
<p>member fucking</p>
<p>what happened to john travolta</p>
<p>did he get hit by</p>
<p>lightning or was it a ufo</p>
<p>something happened</p>
<p>on some angel</p>
<p>he became some</p>
<p>angel pretty sure</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>a lot more ways than one bro no no the</p>
<p>movie angel</p>
<p>was in one angel</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s michael</p>
<p>michael michael</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s when he was an</p>
<p>angel in that one yeah i actually saw in the</p>
<p>movie theater and i feel like</p>
<p>shooting myself</p>
<p>fuck he was an</p>
<p>angel and michael and i just thought it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s all the roles you can play when you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>cleared your things you&rsquo;re joining</p>
<p>us put the headphones on so you know when</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking you feel</p>
<p>when you get when scientology</p>
<p>clears you those are the only rules you can do yeah</p>
<p>fuck man wrap your head around that shit</p>
<p>have you been reading about that guy the</p>
<p>michael guy</p>
<p>what is his name higgs the guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>suing scientology and</p>
<p>hello the the the</p>
<p>screenplay writer yes oh yeah he&rsquo;s canadian</p>
<p>yeah yeah um he wrote</p>
<p>for the last</p>
<p>yeah yeah exactly yeah and for the last fucking</p>
<p>higgs yeah that&rsquo;s his name and for the last</p>
<p>thirty five years he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saying that now he realizes that he&rsquo;s been in a cult</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t buy that</p>
<p>okay i don&rsquo;t buy that you didn&rsquo;t look</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re this brilliant</p>
<p>screenwriter</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re telling me</p>

<p>desk staring at some</p>
<p>other halfway across</p>
<p>from you and you&rsquo;re holding two fucking soup cans</p>
<p>connected by strings that are attached to this meter</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re telling me that</p>
<p>you just now figured out that you&rsquo;ve been in a cult</p>
<p>you motherfucker that one was though</p>

<p>thing that they did that was</p>
<p>weird it was that</p>
<p>stuff they want they&rsquo;re against</p>
<p>yeah homosexuals yet seemed to</p>
<p>tolerate their membership</p>
<p>well they believe</p>
<p>that you can cure</p>
<p>it they believe that you can cure homosexuality somehow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why fake</p>
<p>wives and shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they</p>
<p>do it hold some</p>
<p>chick&rsquo;s hand and walk in</p>
<p>front of a camera and stand</p>
<p>cured a string of</p>
<p>blockbusters is what you need yeah</p>
<p>boy man that</p>
<p>the scientology man the</p>
<p>wheels really came off that machine when john travolta</p>
<p>that video got released online</p>
<p>of him the indoctrination speech</p>
<p>when you see a car accident</p>
<p>and you you know you have to pull over because you&rsquo;re a</p>

<p>videos something that you have to earn</p>
<p>and because scientologist does</p>
<p>he or she has the ability to</p>
<p>create new and better realities and improve conditions</p>
<p>uh being scientologist you look at someone and you know</p>
<p>absolutely that you can help them</p>
<p>so for me it really is ksw and it&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that uh</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t mince words with that</p>
<p>you know with anything that</p>
<p>all rage does but that policy to me has really gone boy</p>
<p>never had i</p>
<p>just time went through and said you know what</p>
<p>when i read a diet you know i just went</p>
<p>this is it is exactly it</p>
<p>being a scientologist</p>
<p>when you drive past an accident</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like anyone else</p>
<p>as you drive past</p>
<p>you know you have to do something</p>
<p>about it because</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re the only one that can really help</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>drives me is</p>
<p>that i know that we have an opportunity and</p>
<p>to really help</p>
<p>for the first time</p>
<p>have effectively change</p>
<p>alright kill this</p>
<p>looney shit</p>
<p>you guys give me a fucking headache</p>
<p>you shut up</p>
<p>those are skills honed for</p>
<p>many years of getting straight guys to suck his cock</p>
<p>for sure look how compelling he is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so confident</p>
<p>and the fucking eye contact that he makes is so intense</p>
<p>i bet he&rsquo;s had more than a hundred</p>
<p>straight guys suck his cock and not even realize it</p>
<p>until they were doing it</p>
<p>that is i mean well guarantee you if that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>then i might join</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably suck his</p>
<p>cock i might</p>
<p>i might think</p>
<p>about it then i</p>
<p>would think</p>
<p>about joey diaz&rsquo;s jokes</p>
<p>that was mesmerizing</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t it wait</p>
<p>was you oh you did or didn&rsquo;t seem like mesmerizing</p>
<p>yes mesmerized</p>
<p>music it was like it was yeah</p>
<p>you know mission impossible</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that wasn&rsquo;t that mission impossible music</p>
<p>very sorry so that was slowed down</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so weird</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s so strange and you know another fascinating</p>
<p>thing was the acronym</p>
<p>thing they they it&rsquo;s all for me it&rsquo;s all ksw</p>
<p>yeah like they have this</p>
<p>weird thing like you you&rsquo;re the commentary</p>
<p>yeah they wear those</p>
<p>those navy suits with the same mindset</p>
<p>yeah and they think they&rsquo;re in the navy</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not there in some sort of religious cult</p>
<p>which that&rsquo;s kind of a cool cult when you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re in the navy</p>
<p>what cult thinks it&rsquo;s in the navy</p>
<p>psychologists do they wear like navy outfits</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s their top level of all their</p>
<p>things whoa wait a minute hold on i did not know this</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re telling me the top level people</p>
<p>dress up like popeye yes yes oh</p>
<p>my gosh look at the lighting</p>
<p>mate there&rsquo;s a car accident</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get that car accident</p>
<p>chains of me it&rsquo;s forbidden</p>
<p>it comes from when l</p>
<p>ron hubbard couldn&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t let him dock in any country because he had</p>
<p>taxes everywhere so he</p>
<p>lived on this cruise ship</p>
<p>oh my god and so all of his</p>
<p>close relatives</p>
<p>everybody around him was</p>
<p>just like see that became the hierarchy of the church</p>
<p>how badass was l</p>
<p>ron hubbard all</p>
<p>right respect</p>
<p>yeah he got</p>
<p>those monkeys to</p>
<p>dance for him and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still dancing even</p>
<p>after he&rsquo;s dead well he formed it because</p>
<p>aleister crowley</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t let him into the hermetic</p>
<p>order of the golden dawn the</p>
<p>secret society in england so he wanted to</p>
<p>prove to him he was</p>
<p>worthy but he said</p>
<p>watch i&rsquo;ll create</p>
<p>my own religion created this religion people believed</p>
<p>in it and they went back and my aleister crowley</p>
<p>still didn&rsquo;t want them</p>
<p>you know the thing</p>
<p>about it though it&rsquo;s really fascinating</p>
<p>about scientology i bought a dianetics book once</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>moved to north hollywood that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the number one</p>
<p>yeah it was like</p>
<p>three o&rsquo;clock in the morning and shit i was at</p>
<p>the commercial</p>
<p>yeah cgi got you right</p>
<p>was like wow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so cool look at that volcano it&rsquo;s blowing up oh look</p>
<p>terrible yeah</p>
<p>yeah well it was</p>
<p>just like you know i had like listened to the anthony</p>
<p>robins cassettes i used to</p>
<p>when i was writing comedy i</p>
<p>would listen to the anthony</p>
<p>robins cassettes get like</p>
<p>fired up so like</p>
<p>getting motivated</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>lazy with a lot of shit and it&rsquo;s hard to get me to move</p>
<p>so i have to get like some sort of a pump me up talk</p>
<p>rocky so i i was</p>
<p>experimenting on a</p>
<p>bunch of different ones so i</p>
<p>tried that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like the anthony robbins had some really good</p>
<p>quotes really good</p>
<p>stuff i got some good</p>
<p>stuff out of it</p>
<p>and then i fucked around with dianetics</p>
<p>cause it was like</p>
<p>three o&rsquo;clock in the morning i didn&rsquo;t know it was</p>
<p>scientology</p>
<p>i had no idea what it was you know</p>
<p>i just saw this</p>
<p>thing dianetics what is this so i</p>
<p>order it and</p>
<p>these motherfuckers were relentless</p>
<p>i mean i got shit to my mailbox for</p>
<p>ten years later</p>
<p>for 10 years</p>
<p>they just kept sending me shit it was like</p>
<p>every week an opportunity to come</p>
<p>to some free workshop or there&rsquo;s this or there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a new offer and</p>
<p>come on down and get a free examination a free</p>
<p>psychological exam</p>
<p>psychiatry is evil did you know that and</p>
<p>it was just like like</p>
<p>you know you fuck up and give someone your</p>
<p>myspace address and then they fucking assault you with</p>
<p>emails that&rsquo;s what i like</p>
<p>sorry bro but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re unbelievable</p>
<p>but they say a lot</p>
<p>of shit that can help you that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really nutty</p>
<p>about a lot of cults</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>blanket say that they&rsquo;re all bad</p>
<p>because yes they are bad but</p>
<p>sometimes really fucking</p>
<p>wacky people just need a path</p>
<p>they need someone to put a collar on them</p>
<p>hold their hand and get them going</p>
<p>and when you do do that</p>
<p>and you put them in some sort of a situation like that</p>
<p>they can flourish and be</p>
<p>successful and even be fucking happy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re lacking</p>
<p>the critical thinking</p>
<p>skills that makes you go well what the fuck who</p>
<p>wrote that and then who</p>
<p>wrote that and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>translated from hebrew</p>
<p>and how do you</p>
<p>translate hebrew because hebrew is letters</p>
<p>and numbers so you don&rsquo;t even know what the numerical</p>
<p>value of the words</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s too many thoughts for you but for</p>
<p>a person that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>knucklehead</p>
<p>that go okay i got the religion</p>
<p>covered it&rsquo;s in a nice little box</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s move forward with the car wash business</p>
<p>you know whatever the fuck he&rsquo;s got that</p>
<p>you know sometimes</p>
<p>like a good</p>
<p>solid cult can actually help you</p>
<p>well you can</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s just die for advice if you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>a sort of spiritual enlightenment if you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about for sure all day</p>
<p>this is the simple</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;m an atheist but</p>
<p>if you want</p>
<p>to believe in god just join a religion that has a</p>
<p>sense of humor</p>
<p>that is the single key</p>
<p>if your religion that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking of joining</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have any jokes</p>
<p>about itself can&rsquo;t laugh</p>
<p>about it well i</p>
<p>think they all have</p>
<p>a sense of humor because i mean</p>
<p>when energy</p>
<p>does not have a</p>
<p>sense of fucking humor</p>
<p>about itself</p>
<p>i went on beliefnet and</p>
<p>tried to find</p>
<p>it i used to chat with them all the time trying</p>
<p>do you have any jokes</p>
<p>anything so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think during their</p>
<p>sermons or whatever they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>their meetings</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think they have like a sense of</p>
<p>joking if it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>safe i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>so man i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>first of all i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>they structure the</p>
<p>whole thing but i</p>
<p>know that it&rsquo;s very secretive and they keep information</p>
<p>from everybody</p>
<p>except the highest levels</p>
<p>and it takes a long time to get to the highest</p>
<p>levels and once you get there you have to</p>
<p>spend a fuckload of money</p>
<p>so a lot of times people get invested in it because</p>
<p>they look i&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>loser i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>given these people a</p>
<p>half a million</p>
<p>dollars over the course of 25 years because i&rsquo;m a loser</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a winner this is real okay tom cruise is at my</p>
<p>house we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking do this and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna become clear</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>teach teach them</p>
<p>about themes and</p>
<p>aliens on it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy who</p>
<p>lived down the</p>
<p>street from me was</p>
<p>he and his family in</p>
<p>scientologist</p>
<p>and he was talking to me</p>
<p>about buying his property</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like yeah we were thinking</p>
<p>about buying it but you know</p>
<p>right now deb is</p>
<p>about to go</p>
<p>clear and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna cost his</p>
<p>fifty thousand dollars</p>
<p>i go what are you talking about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s clear</p>
<p>like i fucking did not know what he was saying</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>well yeah what</p>
<p>clear is you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scientologist</p>
<p>i just thought fuck they got him for</p>
<p>fifty large</p>
<p>right here they&rsquo;re getting them for</p>
<p>fifty thousand dollars for a fucking</p>
<p>voodoo ceremony that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably the tip of the</p>
<p>iceberg of what they got him for before to get to that</p>
<p>point i mean that&rsquo;s gay sex and then</p>
<p>fifty thousand dollars</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a money making organization</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>make tons of cash that&rsquo;s why they had to get the irs to</p>
<p>declare them a religion they sued them</p>
<p>to relate they</p>
<p>never actually came</p>
<p>out said the religion they says we&rsquo;re done prosecuting</p>
<p>because they filed so many lawsuits the irs</p>
<p>said this would cost us more to</p>
<p>fight these</p>
<p>than it would to settle it out and just call them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so trippy</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>how much money</p>
<p>would you have</p>
<p>to make to be able to even afford to be a</p>
<p>scientologist</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>ways if you can&rsquo;t afford it then you got to work for me</p>
<p>sent and you sign a billion year</p>
<p>commitment to work for them billion yeah billion</p>
<p>bi bi for real yeah yeah</p>
<p>cause your spirit that</p>
<p>should hold up in court</p>
<p>one billion dollars</p>
<p>that just lets you know you&rsquo;re hanging out with retards</p>
<p>yeah you want to bet a</p>
<p>billion dollars bro you don&rsquo;t have a billion dollars</p>
<p>were you scared to bet</p>
<p>like no you&rsquo;re fucking retarded man this is a</p>
<p>stupid conversation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking a billion</p>
<p>years just in case artificial life is created and you</p>
<p>so you owe a billion years of</p>
<p>transferring your body into new machines</p>
<p>just read the</p>
<p>classics don&rsquo;t fucking go to religion read</p>
<p>thomas aquinas read</p>
<p>aristotle well i</p>
<p>think religion is</p>
<p>absolutely fascinating</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s very interesting and i</p>
<p>think it may very well be</p>
<p>look i got this</p>
<p>weird way of looking at</p>
<p>things and one of the ways i look at</p>
<p>things is that</p>
<p>everything is natural</p>
<p>and that just like</p>
<p>animal behavior is very</p>
<p>bizarre and complex but natural</p>
<p>alpha and beta wolf behavior and</p>
<p>things that they&rsquo;ve done forever then they</p>
<p>have this sort of coordinated and it&rsquo;s very strange</p>
<p>i think human beings are so much more</p>
<p>complex and with language either so many more variables</p>
<p>but i have a feeling that the way people behave</p>
<p>is just as natural as</p>
<p>those bees making beehives and just as natural as</p>
<p>wolves that are kicking the betas out</p>
<p>i think we have</p>
<p>a whole bunch of components in</p>
<p>place that are</p>
<p>very obviously moving society into a certain direction</p>
<p>you know and i don&rsquo;t i think</p>
<p>your enlightenment</p>
<p>and your ideas</p>
<p>about the future are all really a part of it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all to try to</p>
<p>trance i mean</p>
<p>these open ideas and reality and</p>
<p>clear headedness and love</p>
<p>tries to move</p>
<p>it into the best possible scenario when it gets there</p>
<p>but where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going is it&rsquo;s pretty clear that</p>
<p>everything we do</p>
<p>is sort of designed</p>
<p>to move things forward in that direction</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very very strange there&rsquo;s a sub component</p>
<p>of our society that feels like it&rsquo;s devolving them</p>
<p>yeah but you know what i</p>
<p>think that that tests</p>
<p>it i think i</p>
<p>think you need yin to have yang i</p>
<p>think you need suppression to have art sometimes i</p>
<p>think you need to have</p>
<p>resistance you know i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a very tricky</p>
<p>thing you know that&rsquo;s very true</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to look at it all together</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s one big organism that&rsquo;s all moving and</p>
<p>every single emotion</p>
<p>and every single car accident is all inexorably</p>
<p>entwined into one big mathematical algorithm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s way too big for us to really comprehend</p>
<p>but that might be what it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>the idea of</p>
<p>free will i mean has been disputed many many times</p>
<p>the idea of</p>
<p>is it really free will</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dealing with you being</p>
<p>influenced by a</p>
<p>dozen different fucking hormones and</p>
<p>neurotransmitters and emotions and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things that are flying around in the air</p>
<p>and you might be</p>
<p>drunk and like how much of that is free will exactly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not 100</p>
<p>free will you know</p>
<p>if there was 100 free will you</p>
<p>would have rational decisions made every time</p>
<p>what makes an impulsive</p>
<p>gambler you know what makes</p>
<p>that might not be a program</p>
<p>might not be just some fucking</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>just some giant equation</p>
<p>you look baked</p>
<p>how scary it</p>
<p>is to think that</p>
<p>like stupid people are</p>
<p>breeding like</p>
<p>crazy so eventually</p>
<p>if things just happen</p>
<p>naturally and progress like</p>
<p>like the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make them then</p>
<p>intellectual people are</p>
<p>gonna just be</p>
<p>wiped off the planet soon yeah</p>
<p>yeah no i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a battle</p>
<p>intellectual people stop creating</p>
<p>babies really there&rsquo;s a lot of retards</p>
<p>today but there&rsquo;s a lot more</p>
<p>smart people too</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>smart people now not i don&rsquo;t want to say</p>
<p>smart as in like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fix the</p>
<p>world but more</p>
<p>aware folks</p>
<p>more folks that are</p>
<p>thinking and</p>
<p>aware and honest</p>
<p>than ever before i think</p>
<p>by a long shot</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve realized that i</p>
<p>think it is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the big damn that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna break</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of in tune people out there there&rsquo;s a lot of dumbasses</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>way more in tune people than i when i was 21</p>
<p>when i was 21 i didn&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about anything how</p>
<p>much more tolerant are we too way</p>
<p>more i&rsquo;d love that i love that</p>
<p>about society it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>when i run into</p>
<p>1920 year olds</p>
<p>now i remember there&rsquo;s a gay kid in my high school</p>
<p>he went through hell</p>
<p>just went through hell now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out everyone</p>
<p>knows there&rsquo;s none of that hatred anymore yeah</p>
<p>different races and</p>
<p>stuff like that intermix</p>
<p>really pretty awesome</p>
<p>compared to like how it used to be it&rsquo;s evolving</p>
<p>that that story</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get told half as much as the negative side</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>fast that was in the last what fifteen years yeah oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like pubic</p>
<p>hair disappearing it&rsquo;s like in that same</p>
<p>frame of mind so</p>
<p>maybe pubic</p>
<p>hair and our</p>
<p>racism are tied to each</p>
<p>other cause the less pubic</p>
<p>hair there is out there</p>
<p>the less racism</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s less pubic</p>
<p>hair now than ever before oh fuck i&rsquo;ve not</p>
<p>found pubic hair</p>
<p>on it because people were shaving it yeah it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>on but still there you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>tricking it</p>
<p>but wait a second</p>
<p>have you been</p>
<p>searching i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>checking pubic hair lately for my</p>
<p>own quest yeah</p>
<p>but nobody just it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>so easy now</p>
<p>back back then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot harder to get</p>
<p>fuck i mean the girl i</p>
<p>recently dated she had crazy bush</p>
<p>really yeah the last two girls</p>
<p>but she was conscious of it trying to be different now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trendy now</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s trendy</p>
<p>now twitch is horrendous visual</p>
<p>of what brian with this</p>
<p>dirty bush in his face bushes are back</p>
<p>i like the bush</p>
<p>with altoid breath</p>
<p>i like the smelling like apples because he&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>trick cops on the way home yeah</p>
<p>i like i just like imagine that my bird</p>
<p>going into a nest</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s sweet is that what you do</p>
<p>like one little tiny egg</p>
<p>trying to find that not even an egg it&rsquo;s a hatchling</p>
<p>just just want to lick it clean</p>
<p>also it&rsquo;s easier to spit back the</p>
<p>juice on them when there&rsquo;s hair</p>
<p>you know because when there&rsquo;s no hair</p>
<p>it just goes everywhere there&rsquo;s puddles in her</p>
<p>belly button and stuff</p>
<p>yeah so with</p>
<p>the hair kind of absorb some of like that no i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna swallow this you know</p>
<p>why do girls want you to swallow</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s swallow what when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating fuck is coming out of the window</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking a guy dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not a guy</p>
<p>let me ask you this how big is this girl&rsquo;s dick</p>
<p>fuck are you saying so do you gaggle</p>
<p>up when you swallow</p>
<p>no i just spit it back on and ask</p>
<p>you to swallow</p>
<p>no like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>juices you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>juices wait</p>
<p>a minute you</p>
<p>know like when</p>
<p>their breasts feel like sandbags you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>juices you know when</p>
<p>they have those</p>
<p>strong hands that</p>
<p>secure you secretions</p>
<p>from the pussy</p>
<p>mixed with your</p>
<p>slobber mixed</p>
<p>with it it&rsquo;s like a whole</p>
<p>basket of juice</p>
<p>right that you explain</p>
<p>to me you must be really good at it then</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really good</p>
<p>yeah i can tell there&rsquo;s videos</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>well because the</p>
<p>girls getting that wet then you must be</p>
<p>yeah well he</p>
<p>first of all he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>throwing up in them constantly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>he just every five minutes he</p>
<p>sticks a finger in her and then right in his mouth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of his thing he drinks a fuckload of tang</p>
<p>before he does it so even though it&rsquo;s puke it</p>
<p>smells cool it smells like a spaceship it&rsquo;s coconut</p>
<p>water you put on like they&rsquo;re on the moon</p>
<p>he just throws up tang</p>
<p>and fingers</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like why won&rsquo;t you swallow it why</p>
<p>is it so chunky she&rsquo;s like why are you throwing up</p>
<p>you can say i tried swallowing your pussy juices</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my pussy juices</p>
<p>that much towards more swallowed already</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like coconut</p>
<p>water you&rsquo;re right it is coconut water</p>
<p>beards are not good for it</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another good</p>
<p>thing about hair though when there&rsquo;s two hairs they</p>
<p>match it matches like velcro</p>
<p>and it locks</p>
<p>it locks you on</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t scratch them because they have a</p>
<p>protection of hair</p>
<p>see that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>an eyelash for an eye it&rsquo;s supposed to collect dirt and</p>
<p>come and spit</p>
<p>i like the way you</p>
<p>think i like the way you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fairly</p>
<p>fucking bushes are back two</p>
<p>thousand eleven did you guys see that that lady</p>
<p>blow a fuse</p>

<p>getting paid ten dollars an hour or whatever</p>
<p>those reporters are probably getting</p>
<p>like the cbs is like real legit</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s a legit</p>
<p>neurological</p>
<p>issue i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a matter</p>
<p>of her just getting her tongue tied it was like a</p>
<p>disconnect between the</p>
<p>mouth and the</p>
<p>sound coming out of her</p>
<p>mouth and her</p>
<p>brain you think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stoned what is it no i</p>

<p>panic attack oh you</p>
<p>gotta play it play it</p>
<p>find it she either had a</p>
<p>panic attack or</p>
<p>she had like there&rsquo;s a lot of people thought she had a</p>
<p>stroke but apparently they</p>
<p>checked her</p>
<p>oh you read</p>
<p>about this yeah</p>
<p>somebody said they denied that she had a</p>
<p>stroke on air</p>
<p>yeah and she&rsquo;s feeling fine this morning yeah</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>other people that say</p>
<p>might be like some form of epilepsy or</p>
<p>might be like</p>
<p>who the fuck knows what it is but</p>
<p>it was one of the oddest</p>
<p>things ever</p>
<p>here goes listen</p>
<p>a lot of new details this morning</p>
<p>about that los angeles</p>
<p>television reporter who suddenly began</p>
<p>slurring her speech and</p>
<p>speaking gibberish in her report on the grammys</p>
<p>the video of cerritos this is</p>
<p>when firefighting</p>
<p>has a lot more on this medical dude</p>
<p>not this find the actual video</p>

<p>here it gets the big</p>
<p>shocker winning only two despite ten nominations</p>
<p>seniors to serene branson is live at the stable center</p>
<p>with highlights and backstage</p>
<p>coverage we&rsquo;re seeing for the very first time serene</p>
<p>well a very very</p>
<p>the fuck is that her is that what she did</p>
<p>fucking you tears just stop</p>
<p>she just stopped a very very heavy heavy</p>
<p>dirt rotation tonight we had a very dares darrison</p>
<p>by let&rsquo;s go ahead terrace</p>
<p>chase english for the bit the head the pet</p>
<p>she did nitro you know what is</p>
<p>nitrous or salvia</p>
<p>right before she took she&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>alien and she fucked up and she didn&rsquo;t get her decoder</p>
<p>right she&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>alien and that&rsquo;s what their real language is</p>
<p>she thought she was</p>
<p>speaking human and she fucked up and that was klingon</p>
<p>that was really weird that was really weird that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably it did seem like a little mini</p>
<p>stroke or some brain injury</p>
<p>salvia it seemed</p>
<p>to me like she</p>
<p>definitely seemed like she knew something was wrong</p>
<p>but at the end she thought</p>
<p>she was saying go back to you guys like it seemed like</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>indication that she had completed her</p>
<p>thing that she was trying to get out it</p>
<p>reminds me of a twilight zone episode i saw growing up</p>
<p>where the guy just</p>
<p>starts noticing little words</p>
<p>changing like hey go outside and play</p>
<p>with the encyclopedia what do you mean dog what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>and then it slowly gets</p>
<p>worse when it&rsquo;s kind of like that whole same</p>
<p>twilight yeah</p>
<p>wow the best</p>
<p>story actually halfway through i realize</p>
<p>yeah but but</p>
<p>still what the fuck man what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with that broad</p>
<p>i i really feel like she&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>i mean this is</p>
<p>california i really feel like she got to</p>
<p>stone while she&rsquo;s waiting to go on</p>
<p>and like her boyfriend</p>
<p>was there just hit it just hit it a couple times</p>
<p>and she just just</p>
<p>freaked out she got to</p>
<p>stone i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s that many</p>
<p>people too fast the way she was mixing up the the word</p>
<p>putting it into different</p>
<p>chunks and moving it around</p>
<p>it was that was</p>
<p>that had to be</p>
<p>this is like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like those retards that sit around like</p>
<p>studying bigfoot films</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way that</p>
<p>could be a monkey suit</p>
<p>because the muscles in a human</p>
<p>literally don&rsquo;t work like that look at</p>
<p>these pyramids on mars</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>dude this is impossible that this</p>
<p>structure is there by accident</p>
<p>she could be a</p>
<p>snake handler one of</p>
<p>those christians that</p>
<p>speaks in tongues when she could have</p>
<p>infected with the spirit hey</p>
<p>might be pentecost</p>
<p>do you ever see jesus camp</p>
<p>yes oh what a</p>
<p>great documentary that is oh</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t seen it</p>
<p>folks it&rsquo;s a must see it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an indoctrination</p>
<p>school where they take</p>
<p>these kids and they</p>
<p>trying to turn them into christian holy warriors i went</p>
<p>to those when i was a kid for catholicism</p>
<p>really yeah oh i had to go to</p>
<p>bible camp every summer oh my god awful</p>
<p>how long did you have to go for</p>
<p>until i realized how</p>
<p>many like how</p>
<p>long were you away from your family for like two weeks</p>
<p>three weeks fuck yeah</p>
<p>it was always</p>
<p>and i got to be honest with you there was</p>
<p>dirty there were used to hook up with the girls in</p>
<p>those camps all really</p>
<p>well i was a little kid you have to</p>
<p>carry a cross</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>penance jesus</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>carry across not</p>
<p>filipino one not everybody gets to be</p>
<p>jesus okay he</p>
<p>was raised with no religion</p>
<p>everyone gets me jesus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny because</p>
<p>i was raised so religious and she was raised less</p>
<p>none like she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>bible stories or anything so i take it for</p>
<p>granted that everybody knows it</p>
<p>and then she always reminds me i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about this either</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of them that i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i read enough to go all right stop</p>
<p>shut the fuck up</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve read more</p>
<p>about the origins of the</p>
<p>bible than i&rsquo;ve read the bible</p>
<p>the most fascinating</p>
<p>thing that i&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>is that the original</p>
<p>bible was written in ancient hebrew</p>
<p>besides the dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls which</p>
<p>is an aramaic and that&rsquo;s an interesting one because</p>
<p>it was actually written on animal skins one of the ways</p>
<p>they put together the dead sea scrolls</p>
<p>was they had to do</p>
<p>the dna of the animal</p>
<p>so that they</p>
<p>could figure out</p>
<p>which animal</p>
<p>pieces were connected to</p>
<p>which animal</p>
<p>pieces like this painstaking work trying to</p>
<p>piece it all together</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>to this day</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know all the words in ancient hebrew no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something like this</p>
<p>they only know like</p>
<p>three quarters or</p>
<p>maybe a little bit</p>
<p>more and some of the important ones that are incredibly</p>
<p>short that they know</p>
<p>a little about because</p>
<p>they have the</p>
<p>least amount of information so you get</p>
<p>these two letter words that</p>
<p>just could mean</p>
<p>it could be a</p>
<p>preposition it</p>
<p>could be a longer sort of</p>
<p>shortening of a number could</p>
<p>be just a number too</p>
<p>letters and numbers are the same</p>
<p>thing there was no numbers</p>
<p>so the letter a was also the number one</p>
<p>i love the bible too how people take it</p>
<p>literally who are english</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>the southern</p>
<p>fundamentalist wildlife</p>
<p>jesus said well actually no</p>
<p>this has been</p>
<p>translated like 30 times</p>
<p>in english you know</p>
<p>beaten into the ground the original</p>
<p>one you&rsquo;re reading</p>
<p>is the nonsense one written by constantine and a</p>
<p>bunch of bishops yeah</p>
<p>and even reading the fucking fire and brimstone</p>
<p>the original</p>
<p>yes peter g really loved me</p>
<p>three times</p>
<p>and it comes out</p>
<p>three times is love you in english</p>
<p>but in even like the</p>
<p>for translations back in greek</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s asking him</p>
<p>three different ways do you love me as a father as a</p>
<p>protector and as a</p>
<p>lover it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>so silly like</p>
<p>this is what people</p>
<p>need to realize no matter how much people knew at one</p>
<p>point in time even if people you know</p>
<p>really had figured out some incredible way of moving</p>
<p>stone that we can&rsquo;t replicate</p>
<p>today and that&rsquo;s how they were able to</p>
<p>build the pyramids</p>
<p>we are still the</p>
<p>smartest motherfuckers</p>
<p>that have ever been in the face of the planet</p>
<p>by far the most</p>
<p>aware the most informed</p>
<p>right fucking now for sure</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>magic dude talking to us now</p>
<p>okay there was no</p>
<p>magic dude back then</p>
<p>and people are full of shit</p>
<p>and that story sucks it sucks and it&rsquo;s old and just</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s old you don&rsquo;t have to fucking keep listening</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>take it as a historical idea</p>
<p>take you know the stories as you know like</p>
<p>ancient fables and interesting ideas</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no god</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that anybody has any answers</p>
<p>but it means you can&rsquo;t believe old dumb shit it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it ruins the</p>
<p>whole conversation</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t believe old dumb shit to the</p>
<p>point where it makes you want to kill</p>
<p>or hurt anybody else it&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re mad because</p>
<p>other people don&rsquo;t believe old dumb shit so</p>
<p>the way that you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>reinforce this old dumb shit is go on a rampage</p>
<p>and kill a bunch of people</p>
<p>how can you</p>
<p>believe in a book</p>
<p>that if you only know one fourth of it too</p>
<p>how much can a book</p>
<p>three three four</p>
<p>or if you only know</p>
<p>three four so if you&rsquo;re missing one fourth of a book</p>
<p>would you ever</p>
<p>really believe that book it&rsquo;s probably even</p>
<p>more than that</p>
<p>translated to</p>
<p>latin and then to</p>
<p>greek and you know in the</p>
<p>long losing in the</p>
<p>translation</p>
<p>like ancient</p>
<p>hebrew so much</p>
<p>different than</p>
<p>those languages i imagine like a mice a minute</p>
<p>he or he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shoot you know turn around and</p>
<p>shoot them you know that&rsquo;s like one fourth of that book</p>
<p>that changes the whole book</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>might be at the end was like just kidding</p>
<p>jesus is fake</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on mushrooms</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real end of the bible</p>
<p>psych we was on mushrooms words that can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>translate just kidding</p>
<p>all the way through i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>using that as a bit now psych we were on my</p>
<p>now folks you&rsquo;re gonna know where this bit was created</p>
<p>somebody tweet me this because i&rsquo;m gonna forget it</p>
<p>do you think there was sarcasm</p>
<p>back when the bible yeah we might be like</p>
<p>grunting fucks back then</p>
<p>sarcastic fucks that lived to be thirty and they</p>
<p>smelled like shit and they shot loads into each</p>
<p>other they hope they</p>
<p>stuck oh yeah the meatball</p>
<p>inherit the earth yeah</p>
<p>they were dying like</p>
<p>flies those fucks</p>
<p>and then every now and then a</p>
<p>bunch of men would get together in a</p>
<p>bunch of boy fucking hordes</p>
<p>and they would take over entire</p>
<p>countries they would roam the</p>
<p>earth and fucking chop</p>
<p>my bloody sword</p>
<p>next week i</p>
<p>think it can</p>
<p>be done man it&rsquo;s like whenever they have like a</p>
<p>black boot beauty just like always like a ripoff</p>
<p>boy fucking</p>
<p>hordes yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>

<p>two days if you dip it into my plunge</p>
<p>no but as of next week if you&rsquo;re british</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re listening to this i&rsquo;m at the brighton</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m at the comedian brighton</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;m at the winnipeg comedy festival</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>vancouver taping the debaters</p>
<p>then off to the new zealand international comedy</p>
<p>festival what is the debaters</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tv show and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing two episodes of it shot in canada</p>
<p>where we debate topics</p>
<p>on television like socialism</p>
<p>let me tell you this</p>
<p>speaking of socialism</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>about this guy richie</p>
<p>thing you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with the guy richie they fucking</p>
<p>moved into his house squatters</p>
<p>the squatting ras in england are ridiculous ridiculous</p>
<p>the cops can&rsquo;t do anything because if</p>
<p>the only way they can arrest them is if they if they</p>
<p>break the door</p>
<p>but if they</p>
<p>leave even so much as a window on the top</p>
<p>floor open and they</p>
<p>crawl in through it it&rsquo;s a legal entry</p>
<p>what so if they have legally you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get them out of your house so how does</p>
<p>someone what if someone</p>
<p>what if you</p>
<p>get this home and someone</p>
<p>comes into your house and decides to stay</p>
<p>can they do</p>
<p>that well if you&rsquo;re actually living there you can</p>
<p>prove that you&rsquo;re proprietary living in there</p>
<p>and there then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trespassing in your</p>
<p>thing but if you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t prove</p>
<p>anything right he wasn&rsquo;t living in that</p>
<p>right it was</p>
<p>refurbishing it</p>
<p>right because it was</p>
<p>bacon not being stayed in</p>
<p>the lost its and i</p>
<p>would just go in there and</p>
<p>start molesting them</p>
<p>so how does</p>
<p>homeboy get out of that well he</p>
<p>has to serve</p>
<p>them with the</p>
<p>action papers</p>
<p>right just like any</p>
<p>other tenant and that can take six</p>
<p>months to a year</p>
<p>to process oh</p>
<p>my god i just make them uncomfortable</p>
<p>like they responsible for</p>
<p>damage they do to the</p>
<p>house during the time they take</p>
<p>absolutely absolutely</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re responsible just like any</p>
<p>other tenants would be</p>
<p>for any bills</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the weirdest law you know like the only</p>
<p>place i like squatting laws is in</p>
<p>unsettled territory</p>
<p>if you can prove you</p>
<p>built a cabin there and</p>
<p>lived it for 15 years yeah you</p>
<p>should be able to keep it</p>
<p>yeah other than that</p>
<p>you know like come on at</p>
<p>least give a homeboy an acre yeah</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a law set up to protect us</p>
<p>i mean what</p>
<p>the fuck were they doing over there i don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most obvious sign of criminal</p>
<p>just criminal incompetency by lawmakers you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fixed this one well what</p>
<p>about this is</p>
<p>legal there&rsquo;s a guy in england that shot</p>
<p>a guy who is trying to rape and kill his wife</p>
<p>eric didn&rsquo;t shouldn&rsquo;t beat him to death</p>
<p>and he went to jail for it</p>
<p>oh no he didn&rsquo;t yeah</p>
<p>yeah and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it was excessive</p>
<p>it was excessive</p>
<p>force how did you how</p>
<p>would you even know it was excessive</p>
<p>if someone was trying to kill your wife yeah you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even know what you were doing man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d go into a</p>
<p>blackout fucking red</p>
<p>glaze of hate</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re doing so if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to kill then excessive</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be killing back</p>
<p>right you can&rsquo;t legislate</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the deal man</p>
<p>once you fucking</p>
<p>enter the house</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just you just like a rat man</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t deserve to live</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re entering the</p>
<p>house looking to harm someone</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t deserve to live no i</p>
<p>agree with that somebody beat him to</p>
<p>death oh too bad</p>
<p>too bad i guess he won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>breaking in anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>houses trying to fucking rape and kill him anymore and</p>
<p>and then no</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s planting</p>
<p>flowers that you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>you know this guy&rsquo;s a cunt i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>liberal and i believe</p>
<p>in that yeah i don&rsquo;t even believe in the destiny</p>
<p>and look at that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a perfect example we were talking</p>
<p>about earlier</p>
<p>this idea that there&rsquo;s two separate totally different</p>
<p>schools of thinking there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>you know most of most people that i know</p>
<p>think that you know really fucking horrible people</p>
<p>should be removed from the face of the earth</p>
<p>but their own good too man i</p>
<p>think we should reuse them for medical</p>
<p>experience yes so that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never agreed well i&rsquo;ll take you a step further i</p>
<p>think we use them at zoos</p>
<p>well fuck given</p>
<p>tiger stakes</p>
<p>and i fucking hate seeing</p>
<p>tigers that don&rsquo;t get to kill shit</p>
<p>you know but all</p>
<p>these drugs they live for that they have to test on</p>
<p>on animals and</p>
<p>stuff like that that they don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>effects on humans yeah</p>
<p>fuck yeah but</p>
<p>just the shit out of them</p>
<p>fuck yeah absolutely</p>
<p>absolutely it was</p>
<p>the one thing</p>
<p>where me and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>china have a</p>
<p>lot of problems</p>
<p>how about here&rsquo;s the problems what if there&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>powerful man okay</p>
<p>and this very</p>
<p>powerful man</p>
<p>catches you banging his wife just for instance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not you</p>
<p>yeah cause you know it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>no i know i know how you roll dog</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t put it past you dog</p>
<p>so this powerful man decides to have you arrested on</p>
<p>trumped up charges</p>
<p>makes forces his wife into</p>
<p>you know going</p>
<p>along with it or</p>
<p>she do get out</p>
<p>of the money</p>
<p>you get fucked okay</p>
<p>for a little</p>
<p>dirty bitch man she sold you down the river</p>
<p>so you go to jail and then</p>
<p>they accuse you of some horrible</p>
<p>crime that you of course did not do</p>
<p>and next thing you know they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>experiments on you</p>
<p>cause this guy</p>
<p>forces you by his</p>
<p>influence and all his</p>
<p>money he&rsquo;s a very rich</p>
<p>powerful man</p>
<p>he forces you to become a medical</p>
<p>dummy and they</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>experiments on you</p>
<p>i just gave you the craziest for instance forever so so</p>
<p>that came out</p>
<p>for instance</p>
<p>in that case in this highly unlikely event</p>
<p>i still think you know what are you</p>
<p>gonna answer that</p>
<p>at least nothing good&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen with my life anyways at that</p>
<p>point so at</p>
<p>least they can</p>
<p>get some good out of testing fucking drugs on me</p>
<p>hmm okay yeah</p>
<p>my life&rsquo;s practically over anyways you&rsquo;re saying so you</p>
<p>gotta do that and just get you raped</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>today today you</p>
<p>could just do it and get you raped yeah</p>
<p>but yeah why not hear</p>
<p>about oj simpson</p>
<p>did he do so he</p>
<p>got the fuck</p>
<p>beat out of him in jail oh</p>
<p>yeah you got</p>
<p>knocked unconscious and he&rsquo;s been in the hospital</p>
<p>for like like</p>
<p>weeks when do you go to jail i&rsquo;ve been waiting for</p>
<p>naked gun four and a half for a while</p>
<p>way impossible</p>
<p>yeah he was</p>
<p>beat up by a</p>
<p>white supremacist a</p>
<p>young muscular</p>
<p>white supremacist</p>
<p>because he was running around bragging</p>
<p>about all the</p>
<p>white chicks he banged</p>
<p>of course this is just the</p>
<p>official story</p>
<p>you know who the fuck knows who</p>
<p>is a user on the scene</p>
<p>you know prisoner</p>
<p>slash reporter</p>
<p>an embedded</p>
<p>reporter who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna give you all the oj simpson dirt</p>
<p>you know how the fuck they</p>
<p>know what he really said but this guy decided to beat</p>
<p>the shit out of him bad like he thought he killed him</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>apparently oj simpson got</p>
<p>fucked up well i</p>
<p>would yeah it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tough one hey i mean</p>
<p>black history</p>
<p>month too well is it i</p>
<p>think yeah i</p>
<p>think black</p>
<p>people are done with oj</p>
<p>i think they&rsquo;re done with them</p>
<p>they were they were there on the</p>
<p>first trial the</p>
<p>second trial mmm</p>
<p>not so much yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they supported him on murder</p>
<p>but when it came to like</p>
<p>breaking and</p>
<p>entering 20 years</p>
<p>later like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not man you mean to put that dude away</p>
<p>get out of here any</p>
<p>black people right</p>
<p>i mean the crazy</p>
<p>black people that will only vote for him</p>
<p>based on the fact that he&rsquo;s black the</p>
<p>very people that got him acquitted</p>
<p>the people that got him acquitted</p>
<p>there was a fucking</p>
<p>bunch of people outside the courtroom</p>
<p>and they said this one&rsquo;s for us this one&rsquo;s for us</p>
<p>and i went wow i</p>
<p>blame the prosecution i thought they were</p>
<p>absolutely incompetent</p>
<p>yes of course</p>
<p>they were they</p>
<p>were unprepared marge that&rsquo;s lark</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the prosecutions usually are</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really who the people are that are in place</p>
<p>they never get to this</p>
<p>fucking high profile fucking ethli bailey</p>
<p>and fucking</p>
<p>kardashian and</p>
<p>these motherfuckers</p>
<p>who would have thought that the craziest</p>
<p>thing that would have ever</p>
<p>spawned out of that</p>
<p>is the kardashian</p>
<p>sisters i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a product of the oj murders</p>
<p>the reason why the word kardashian</p>
<p>resonated with people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just that she was</p>
<p>paris hilton&rsquo;s friend</p>
<p>she was paris hilton&rsquo;s friend</p>
<p>whose dad helped get off a fucking murderer</p>
<p>what about that cat kato</p>
<p>was a kalan kato</p>
<p>kalan he was</p>
<p>famous for all he was doing stand up</p>
<p>for a little</p>
<p>he just did</p>
<p>it the other day</p>
<p>he followed or i followed him</p>
<p>you do stand up yeah</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know that yeah he&rsquo;s been doing it for a</p>
<p>while now it&rsquo;s fucking awesome</p>
<p>congratulations dude</p>
<p>he did it a</p>
<p>long time ago and you had this joke tell me if you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>what the joke that you quit doing comedy</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think when bob</p>
<p>hope died they flew out his body to iraq to</p>
<p>entertain all the dead</p>
<p>troops oh jesus</p>
<p>and he did this the day bob hope died</p>
<p>i did that the day bob hope died in a</p>
<p>fucking audience</p>
<p>full of old people</p>
<p>and comedy for five years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny see that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>proof positive that time plus you know</p>
<p>whatever equals comedy</p>
<p>very time plus insight</p>
<p>is that what it is what are you ahead of yourself</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all yeah</p>
<p>he was just he jumped the gun</p>
<p>yeah well it&rsquo;s like you know i mean</p>
<p>if you said at the comedy</p>
<p>store i would have got a fucking huge laugh yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at columbus ohio and it was</p>
<p>senior night at the funny bone</p>
<p>yeah man that&rsquo;s the goddamn problem with comedy</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting out</p>
<p>the real problem with comedy is that it&rsquo;s just one</p>
<p>giant genre</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know go to see live</p>
<p>music and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have like a rapper followed by a country</p>
<p>music singer</p>
<p>followed by guns n</p>
<p>roses you know</p>
<p>it amazes me the lack of insight some of the people</p>
<p>putting together bills</p>
<p>into it like</p>
<p>especially in england</p>
<p>where they have like a guitar player in</p>
<p>front and then a high</p>
<p>energy guy and then a low energy closer</p>
<p>yeah dude you can&rsquo;t follow low energy yeah</p>
<p>yeah especially</p>
<p>their audience wants and they go</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just give them</p>
<p>everything and hopefully they like one</p>
<p>thing and they&rsquo;ll come back</p>
<p>not really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>less insightful than that all it is is this who&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got a week open</p>
<p>stick them there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really that simple and always end on the highest energy</p>
<p>but some people put plot like</p>
<p>tom tom sawyer from cobbs like he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>prides himself on like putting together good shows and</p>
<p>making sure the guys go with certain guys can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>to work back in this country actually i&rsquo;m gonna i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>coming back in september for</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna move here</p>
<p>oh really so you decided</p>
<p>to tell out</p>

<p>i might as well be a dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not even remotely interesting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all because dudes are so hot</p>
<p>my take on it has</p>
<p>differed radically in my life it was one</p>
<p>important time i was always attracted to</p>
<p>crazy chicks and i surrounded myself with</p>
<p>crazy chicks cause they were the most fun</p>
<p>and then one of them killed one of my friends</p>
<p>yeah murder suicide</p>
<p>and so that was it for me</p>
<p>all right it&rsquo;s fucking no i want nice like this is a</p>
<p>stupid fucking addiction i know who you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about that yeah she was</p>
<p>crazy as a shit house</p>
<p>crazy and pilled out</p>
<p>pilled out okay</p>

<p>out is different that&rsquo;s that is it it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>crazy is willing to go</p>
<p>crazy in a bunch of different ways</p>
<p>crazy is not</p>
<p>gonna go all natural i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>crazy but i</p>
<p>drink wheatgrass</p>
<p>juice and go to yoga</p>
<p>no sometimes they do math</p>
<p>also in that package that you&rsquo;re talking about how</p>
<p>crazy is also that vindictive jealousy that</p>
<p>women can get</p>
<p>from a man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>success when they&rsquo;re in the same career</p>
<p>as them and one</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>success of any type</p>
<p>there was a lot of issues with that little situation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about phil hartman to not</p>
<p>dance around</p>
<p>it there was a lot of issues with that there was a</p>
<p>you know what it was is he</p>
<p>settled with a</p>
<p>woman that he liked 30</p>
<p>of the time</p>
<p>seventy percent of the time</p>
<p>he wanted to run the fuck away from her and she was</p>
<p>crazy and you know she would</p>
<p>party and it was just a really unhealthy relationship</p>
<p>you know and i</p>
<p>learned a lot from that man</p>
<p>i learned i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never been around people that really despised each</p>
<p>other and were like really high profile and successful</p>
<p>and like she</p>
<p>would say like</p>
<p>biting evil shit to him in public</p>
<p>so that he would feel uncomfortable and she</p>
<p>would embarrass him</p>
<p>like we were at a</p>
<p>party and phil came over with his</p>
<p>wives like hey joe</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>super friendly the nicest</p>
<p>guy to everybody</p>

<p>think that&rsquo;s the only way to keep them is</p>
<p>to bring them down no they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>broken they&rsquo;re broken they have terrible patterns</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s ever explained it to them they&rsquo;ve never done</p>
<p>ecstasy they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been in an</p>
<p>ayahuaski ceremony</p>
<p>they need to do</p>
<p>something they have</p>
<p>terrible patterns i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna fucking</p>
<p>borrow that that is beautiful</p>
<p>terrible patterns people get</p>
<p>stuck in repeating themselves even</p>
<p>if it makes no</p>
<p>sense i learned that years ago when</p>
<p>i took cognitive therapy a long time ago</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how she described it to me</p>
<p>pouring water down a path</p>
<p>after a while it&rsquo;ll always go down the</p>
<p>sand yeah it&rsquo;s very hard to change that</p>
<p>path man very very very hard</p>
<p>i did though it was a big change in my life</p>
<p>well i think you</p>
<p>like a lot of guys i said</p>
<p>you had a traumatic</p>
<p>childhood and traumatic</p>
<p>childhoods i think</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>forces you to</p>
<p>run faster than most people feel comfortable running</p>
<p>you know force it</p>
<p>forces you to</p>
<p>cover more ground in your</p>
<p>life i run very fast too</p>
<p>mentally oh</p>
<p>yeah that to</p>
<p>mind sign but i sprint</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very yeah god</p>
<p>yeah i know i&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>bunch of patterns in my life</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m like am i letting this</p>
<p>weird pattern define</p>
<p>me when this is not even what i like to do like</p>
<p>why is this</p>
<p>why am i stuck doing the same</p>
<p>thing over and over</p>
<p>again why do i have the same sabotage</p>
<p>things that keep happening in my life you know your</p>
<p>evolutions been interesting though because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s voyeuristic to a lot of people that are fans</p>
<p>of yours and wells people that like and know you</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve watched you online and the</p>
<p>things you talk</p>
<p>about the more complexities the more</p>
<p>understandings you get and your passions and your stuff</p>
<p>cause you live life out loud through the help of this</p>
<p>media savvy</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s neat because</p>
<p>watching somebody else evolve inspires</p>
<p>other people to involve and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>involve evolve</p>
<p>well you know i&rsquo;m just doing what all</p>
<p>these other people are doing too it&rsquo;s just more</p>
<p>high profile it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all in it together you</p>
<p>know i mean one of the coolest things</p>
<p>about this internet</p>
<p>experience is the sharing</p>
<p>of information and ideas like somebody sent me some</p>
<p>video today of</p>
<p>some fucking guy in the jungle</p>
<p>climbing to this top of this tree to get some</p>
<p>honey and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>climbing up with</p>
<p>these leaves and fires are</p>
<p>gonna hot ember</p>
<p>in the leaves</p>
<p>and he goes this fucking</p>
<p>tree is like five hundred feet in the air</p>
<p>and this guy slowly</p>
<p>climbing up to the top of the</p>
<p>street so he can get some honey</p>
<p>we were doing the podcast on tuesday or yesterday</p>
<p>we were doing the podcast yesterday and the</p>
<p>power went out</p>
<p>and we were like bitches</p>
<p>the power went out in this fucking</p>
<p>house on you know</p>
<p>paved road with no wild animals anywhere to be seen</p>
<p>and joey diaz like</p>
<p>you know you better call the gas an electric cocksucker</p>
<p>you better start a fire</p>
<p>you better get the kids in the car get</p>
<p>ready to get to the airport</p>
<p>you gotta get the fuck out of here joe rogan</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lions and</p>
<p>tigers and bears</p>
<p>so he starts</p>
<p>going off about it and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking while i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching this fucking guy</p>
<p>climb this tree i&rsquo;m like wow</p>
<p>what this is another reality</p>
<p>right here on</p>
<p>earth two thousand eleven</p>
<p>human beings they</p>
<p>could live this way</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re terrified when</p>
<p>lights go out or you could</p>
<p>climb a five hundred foot fucking tree with a vine</p>
<p>wrapping a vine around and</p>
<p>pulling himself up</p>
<p>step by step all the way to the top to get some honey</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re either terrified when they go out</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re terrified</p>
<p>when they go on this dude was getting fucked up by beef</p>
<p>can you imagine</p>
<p>500 feet in the</p>
<p>air fucked up by these</p>
<p>can you imagine that guy walking home into his</p>
<p>hut and having his wife</p>
<p>start talking about</p>
<p>minuscule bullshit</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s so sad</p>
<p>at the tree</p>
<p>today it was so deep</p>
<p>it was so deep the kids were</p>
<p>watching you</p>
<p>know he&rsquo;s way the fuck up there and the kids are</p>
<p>watching and then you know he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>you know he was like doing a narration not</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s actually climbing</p>
<p>but he was talking</p>
<p>about how many of his friends have died doing it</p>
<p>so there he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>climbing up there we love</p>
<p>honey have honey yeah</p>
<p>wrap your head around that shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>woman you know that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only bring it on because</p>
<p>the woman is</p>
<p>the only thing</p>
<p>calms her down</p>
<p>which is got pms</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll get stung by</p>
<p>the you wouldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that for vital</p>
<p>nutrition they were saying it was</p>
<p>vital nutrition for his family</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s for his family he was describing it how the</p>
<p>beep on bee pollen</p>
<p>and fights and vegems yeah it</p>
<p>really especially in the areas that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>naturally grown</p>
<p>like they say that that&rsquo;s the best one of the best</p>
<p>methods for</p>
<p>avoiding getting colds in any</p>
<p>particular area</p>
<p>it used to be get bees from that air and eat</p>
<p>their raw honey</p>
<p>and then it</p>
<p>would give you some sort of a natural</p>
<p>boost to your immune</p>
<p>system probably makes the pussies</p>
<p>taste better too</p>
<p>fucking jungle</p>
<p>like pineapple it&rsquo;s jumbo</p>
<p>pussy oh jungle</p>
<p>pussy i thought</p>
<p>you said jumbo</p>
<p>the propolis inside of the beast</p>
<p>stuff actually kills infections</p>
<p>other than sulfates it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the next best</p>
<p>thing to fight infections</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>trippy the bees are</p>
<p>dying like a</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve figured it out though in the last couple</p>
<p>months they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>the massive hive</p>
<p>death yeah they</p>
<p>figured it out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a combination</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty sure of a combination of a mite</p>
<p>and a fungus</p>
<p>together when they happen</p>
<p>is causing them really causing them there was</p>
<p>still some debate well</p>
<p>they found a resistant</p>
<p>hive group outside actually</p>
<p>in england that&rsquo;s why i know it because it was in the</p>
<p>guardian and they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>crossbreed them now with all the</p>
<p>other beasts</p>
<p>gonna make super bees that fuck the</p>
<p>world the last just the last time we</p>
<p>did it was fucking killer bees you know the next one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be serial killer</p>

<p>tuned into all the wi fi signals and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna decode</p>

<p>about what he said</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s obviously a performer</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about dennis miller before you got here</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about dennis miller it</p>
<p>was on the bill o&rsquo;reilly show and he&rsquo;s like a fucking</p>
<p>like a salesman</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it was so weird he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>pitching for republicans</p>
<p>like he had bill o&rsquo;reilly had been on</p>
<p>we dare to explain this before so i&rsquo;ll be really brief</p>
<p>bill o&rsquo;reilly had some guy on that was</p>
<p>claiming that fox news was saying that people</p>
<p>would go to jail</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t get health insurance</p>
<p>and you know bill arising we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never said that and then they show like instance</p>
<p>after instance</p>
<p>click like over and over and over</p>
<p>again of them actually saying that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny about the video</p>
<p>but at the end of the video</p>
<p>dennis miller goes on the bill riley show</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about this instance</p>
<p>where the guy was clearly</p>
<p>right and but dennis is like how</p>

<p>it was weird and i wanted to say that to him it was</p>
<p>weird but i didn&rsquo;t want to be a douchebag and i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want i mean it&rsquo;s not something you can ask someone</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re pissing that&rsquo;s something when you</p>
<p>someone over your</p>
<p>house you know you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going anywhere for</p>
<p>three hours you can ask him a question you know</p>
<p>take you delve</p>
<p>into the complexities of why you support one idea</p>
<p>or another man</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really care though that&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>thing like he&rsquo;s not one of</p>
<p>those guys that i mean</p>
<p>comedy i liked but i don&rsquo;t really care what he</p>
<p>thinks really you know like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what everybody thinks</p>
<p>i do to a certain degree but when i find it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something like bill o&rsquo;reilly actually i</p>
<p>watch all the time i do too</p>
<p>i find him so</p>
<p>entertaining i don&rsquo;t know what it is but i get</p>
<p>just a kick out of him</p>
<p>limbo&rsquo;s entertaining too a limbo can</p>
<p>be i listen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny cause i like listening to both sides</p>
<p>actually i find a lot of left wing</p>
<p>radio really boring</p>
<p>some of it is so</p>
<p>ridiculous too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain conversations that get into it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>look man you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing anything any different than the other side</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just being</p>
<p>completely ridiculous and segmented into your own</p>
<p>ideology you&rsquo;ve got it all boxed up in</p>
<p>a clean package</p>
<p>where this is acceptable</p>
<p>and this is not and you&rsquo;re not willing to consider</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>yeah i like real like rachel maddow and i like yeah</p>
<p>i love john stewart</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>great cold bears</p>
<p>gonna be the</p>
<p>most brilliant guy i&rsquo;ve ever seen in my fucking life</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all brilliant you know i mean</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t not</p>
<p>be brilliant to get to that spot it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny that there&rsquo;s not that many people</p>
<p>that are like in the</p>
<p>right that are making fun of shit</p>
<p>you know yeah i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not very good because they don&rsquo;t like sarcasm</p>
<p>well norton is</p>
<p>a republic is he</p>
<p>yeah norton</p>
<p>goes on fox news all the time and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s brilliant</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a brilliant comic</p>
<p>and norn is a brilliant guy i really love that guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smart as fuck</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just got this real conservative way of and he can</p>
<p>argue it he&rsquo;s very intelligent</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s apart from him and a couple</p>
<p>other guys like</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s so many fucking</p>
<p>left wing comedy shows making fun of the news</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s very few like</p>
<p>making fun of like and supporting the regime</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>well yeah i just</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s too many people in the debate</p>
<p>at this point like</p>
<p>i also think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a joke to them</p>
<p>none of it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny right</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny it&rsquo;s not a joke</p>
<p>like the democrats like</p>
<p>stewart clearly supports</p>
<p>obama to a certain extent i mean they goof on them too</p>
<p>they goof on everybody they have to</p>
<p>right to be taken</p>
<p>and themselves</p>
<p>which is important but</p>
<p>clearly you know you would see</p>
<p>when bush was</p>
<p>in office he was like that was either were going</p>
<p>after them they were</p>
<p>going after</p>
<p>their ideas and exposing how</p>
<p>ridiculous they were right</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see what i&rsquo;m saying is you don&rsquo;t see any</p>
<p>right wing comedians that were like</p>
<p>supporting bush with comedy</p>
<p>going after it and supporting it</p>
<p>you know exposing</p>
<p>the stories of news and this is why it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>and these dumbasses that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand this</p>
<p>this is why they&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the comedy is always</p>
<p>against it yeah it&rsquo;s very true</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what that is the fodder</p>
<p>why one is fodder for</p>
<p>their community to</p>
<p>laugh at and one isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but elsa did you</p>
<p>watch the cpac</p>
<p>fundraising the</p>
<p>other day when</p>
<p>they were yelling at dick cheney</p>
<p>call him a war code</p>
<p>yeah how about how</p>
<p>weird was it when he got on</p>
<p>stage and he looked</p>
<p>crazy he looks so different didn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>his face shrunk</p>
<p>but you know he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a pulse</p>
<p>oh yeah well he&rsquo;s an animated</p>
<p>course no but he really</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>pulse is that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got some new</p>
<p>crazy sort of</p>
<p>a pacemaker inside of it that just</p>
<p>literally flows</p>
<p>you put your finger like that he does not have a</p>
<p>pulse it&rsquo;s just constantly moving through his body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the sign of the</p>
<p>apocalypse that the</p>
<p>right wing christians are scared of</p>
<p>yeah the one guy who</p>
<p>made more money and</p>
<p>promoted war better than anybody i mean that guy made a</p>
<p>ton of money</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t they talk</p>
<p>about a guy coming back from the dead</p>
<p>in the fucking</p>
<p>apocalypse the</p>
<p>right wing christian</p>
<p>should be all over the shit yeah</p>
<p>but he supports them you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tricky little fucking</p>
<p>marriage oh yeah</p>
<p>marriage of christians and killers</p>
<p>you know fascinating</p>
<p>somehow another amalgamated</p>
<p>all the extremist</p>
<p>religions are like that i don&rsquo;t want to just</p>
<p>point it christians yeah fucking</p>
<p>muslims absolutely absolutely</p>
<p>never thought</p>
<p>i wanna lose</p>
<p>all of them</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s just everybody</p>
<p>absolutely awful to each other</p>
<p>well even if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>great to each</p>
<p>other you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still locked into some nutty ideology</p>
<p>like what the fuck are</p>
<p>you doing a positive</p>
<p>story if i could</p>
<p>everybody always talks</p>
<p>about negative</p>
<p>stuff about</p>
<p>muslims if i</p>
<p>could say something</p>
<p>the coptic christians that were getting</p>
<p>blown up in the churches in egypt</p>
<p>this is my favorite</p>
<p>story i saw on the news</p>
<p>after 61 of them were killed in alexandria</p>
<p>the local muslim community</p>
<p>offered to walk them to church</p>
<p>every day to protect them from attacks</p>
<p>yeah read about that yeah</p>
<p>that was like</p>
<p>very cool this</p>
<p>should be in the news morse</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not one being</p>
<p>crazy people sure</p>
<p>yeah small percentage and here&rsquo;s some extremely</p>
<p>small percentage</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s yeah but you know there&rsquo;s a lot of nice christians</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve met a lot of good christians you know i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>six different</p>
<p>people that shazam son sup</p>
<p>and i mean people that really</p>
<p>truly live by the principles and</p>
<p>believe that it you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the dogmatic</p>
<p>blindness to</p>
<p>other people you know to anything</p>
<p>right to anything to global warming</p>
<p>you know why you so goddamn</p>
<p>invested in the fact that global warming is natural how</p>
<p>about that yeah</p>
<p>you know why you so</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s a natural cycle</p>
<p>people fucking</p>
<p>scream at you telling you that glow</p>
<p>you fucking</p>
<p>idiot you don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>about the global warming pseudos</p>
<p>science and alcohol</p>
<p>that cocksuckers flying around in a fucking</p>
<p>seven million</p>
<p>dollar jet that guy&rsquo;s making billions of</p>
<p>us billions really it&rsquo;s a fucking business kid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a business</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s all a distraction global warming though</p>
<p>to distract us from our big worries</p>
<p>which is the</p>
<p>ocean dying and the loss of topsoil</p>
<p>the ocean dying is one</p>
<p>thing how about the goddamn garbage</p>
<p>patch in the middle of</p>
<p>the pacific oh my god</p>
<p>the size of a continent now</p>
<p>jesus yeah normals</p>
<p>micro pellets</p>
<p>it was bigger than</p>
<p>texas it was bigger than</p>
<p>texas at one</p>
<p>point in time and now they saying it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>fucking half of</p>
<p>north america it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>insanely big</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even know how big it is really</p>
<p>cause they haven&rsquo;t done like an accurate</p>
<p>survey they</p>
<p>would have to like</p>
<p>go around this</p>
<p>thing and get submarines and figure out</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>floating under the surface of the</p>
<p>water she can&rsquo;t even see it it&rsquo;s these</p>
<p>micro tiny micro</p>
<p>pellets to of the</p>
<p>plastics that dissolves into the usable form from one</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t we never even</p>
<p>heard about this</p>
<p>until like a few years ago</p>
<p>i remember when</p>
<p>they said it was the size of just manhattan</p>
<p>that was about</p>
<p>10 years ago</p>
<p>maybe do you</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;ve gotten that much bigger that</p>
<p>quicker or were they just run away</p>
<p>wrong maybe they just had bad</p>
<p>surveying of it i mean they must be</p>
<p>using satellites</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s in the center of the pacific though</p>
<p>which nobody really</p>
<p>travels to if you look at the</p>
<p>shipping routes they all go</p>
<p>around it so it&rsquo;s not even part of so weird</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no land or anything we are</p>
<p>fucking cunts well there</p>
<p>never used to be that much garbage so</p>
<p>maybe it has just happened that recently</p>
<p>well how the</p>
<p>fuck do we have a</p>
<p>is it water bottles is that what it is well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>goddamn water bottles yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s poisoning the</p>
<p>ocean and how</p>
<p>does it get rid of it what</p>
<p>do you fix that</p>
<p>shoes broom you let</p>
<p>it solidify</p>
<p>and you turn onto a bridge that we can drive</p>
<p>trucks across hmm yeah</p>
<p>but we just</p>
<p>light it all on fire</p>
<p>solve it that&rsquo;s what bp wants to do it every day</p>
<p>we like the</p>
<p>oil on fire that&rsquo;s got to be better for the environment</p>
<p>bp thing must have</p>
<p>freaked you out there to</p>
<p>freak you out nah</p>
<p>at first it</p>
<p>freaked me out but i</p>
<p>was like it was</p>
<p>bound to happen</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>again we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have another</p>
<p>thing just as bad i</p>
<p>think these mega</p>
<p>apocalyptic sort of environmental disasters are gonna</p>
<p>speed up as we&rsquo;re desperately</p>
<p>scrounging for the last</p>
<p>available different</p>
<p>types of resource not just met we&rsquo;re running out of</p>
<p>every type of resources</p>
<p>rare medals</p>
<p>all sorts of</p>
<p>things these open pit mines around the</p>
<p>world where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going deeper and deeper</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just as</p>
<p>we scrounge</p>
<p>for the last little bits</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna sacrifice a</p>
<p>whole lot more</p>
<p>for how long</p>
<p>does it take</p>
<p>to make topsoil</p>
<p>oh top twelve takes six thousand years per</p>
<p>quarter inch</p>
<p>not how i make it bro</p>
<p>shit quick my</p>
<p>uncle he knows what to do i got the stevia</p>
<p>i got the grind</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna produce</p>
<p>you know bang some</p>
<p>rocks with some hammers and i take a shit on it and</p>
<p>leave it there for a couple weeks top</p>
<p>soil but oh</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re watching food</p>
<p>places right now just to skyrocket</p>
<p>around the world like most</p>
<p>recently right</p>
<p>twenty nine years</p>
<p>unbelievable 29</p>
<p>something crazy</p>
<p>some up to 300</p>
<p>depending on what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about and this is this is causing</p>
<p>greater and</p>
<p>greater poverty and disparity</p>
<p>even though</p>
<p>our problem has always been distribution the</p>
<p>price of food is being priced out of the</p>
<p>a portion of</p>
<p>the one quarter of the</p>
<p>earth&rsquo;s population</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re using less</p>
<p>and less land for arable resources we&rsquo;re expanding out</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re expanding</p>
<p>our cities out we&rsquo;re expanding our mining</p>
<p>out and there&rsquo;s less and less grazing farmland and some</p>
<p>countries are predicting this you look at</p>
<p>china right now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re buying up</p>
<p>arable land all across africa</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>planning on this courage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on they bought out</p>
<p>madagascar tanzania</p>
<p>zambia these massive acreages</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re growing food just for</p>
<p>china right now</p>
<p>the us doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>commercial entity that&rsquo;s doing anything similar to this</p>
<p>right now monsanto being the big sort of</p>
<p>influencer in global</p>
<p>food is actually shrinking</p>
<p>the amount of arable</p>
<p>land by forcing people to use their</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>genetic resource seeds</p>
<p>that can afford it and</p>
<p>those who can&rsquo;t afford it don&rsquo;t grow crops</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about monsanto yesterday and</p>
<p>the fact that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve acquired</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed they&rsquo;ve acquired blackwater</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done it through some sort of a</p>
<p>third party</p>
<p>there was talk</p>
<p>about them requiring it and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the official</p>
<p>story from the people that have investigated it</p>
<p>they say literally there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no way to tell whether or not monsanto has picked up</p>
<p>blackwater but</p>
<p>what is blackwater</p>
<p>blackwater&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>mercenary outfit that was</p>
<p>one of the most popular ones</p>
<p>during the iraq war they actually had to change</p>
<p>their name because they did so much fucked up shit</p>
<p>know they had</p>
<p>i forget they</p>
<p>changed the</p>
<p>civilians they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t under</p>
<p>usmc a military</p>
<p>court justice</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re in iraq so they could do</p>
<p>stuff that the military get</p>
<p>prosecuted for like</p>
<p>shoot civilians in the back</p>
<p>stuff like that so</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>again i have a new name is xe</p>
<p>but they were involved in a lot of sketchy</p>
<p>stuff you know</p>
<p>not all of them i think</p>
<p>a lot of them what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is like how</p>
<p>crazy it is that everybody talks</p>
<p>about how ruthless</p>
<p>these seed companies are monsanto especially</p>
<p>prosecuting people who have</p>
<p>their seeds who have just</p>
<p>cross pollinated you</p>
<p>know they get</p>
<p>in the breeze and they grow on some of the fields</p>
<p>and now they sue</p>
<p>these guys and</p>
<p>they you know</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s the nuttiest</p>
<p>thing like they&rsquo;ve patented nature they&rsquo;ve patented</p>
<p>living things</p>
<p>so by genetically modifying it then they can</p>
<p>claim to own it</p>
<p>and their ideas to eventually</p>
<p>have that&rsquo;s the only kind of food you can get</p>
<p>is shit that they own they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna own all the food</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insanity they&rsquo;re patenting</p>
<p>human genes yes and animal genes too yeah</p>
<p>yeah like they patented pigs they patented</p>
<p>parks of they&rsquo;re trying to patent parts of pigs</p>
<p>the um the breast cancer gene the gene that</p>
<p>causes breast cancer they patented and</p>
<p>charged universities a hundred and</p>
<p>fifty thousand dollars if</p>
<p>they wanted to use it to research breast cancer cures</p>
<p>and now they have an army</p>
<p>yeah things are</p>
<p>going well to you but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what i wanted to ask you by</p>
<p>bringing up this fucking doom and gloom</p>
<p>do you choose</p>
<p>how much to</p>
<p>and one of the reasons why</p>
<p>is because this is a very</p>
<p>main idea that i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>bouncing around in my head lately</p>
<p>do you choose how much negative shit you</p>
<p>allow to get in your head</p>
<p>interesting question</p>
<p>do you choose like i mean you look at something like</p>
<p>what black water did and</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on over here what happened to that lady in</p>
<p>egypt the reporter and like</p>
<p>okay how much of this is really affecting me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good question because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something i battle with all the time and i try to</p>
<p>limit my psychology of getting dark</p>
<p>rather than i&rsquo;ll still</p>
<p>read everything i can</p>
<p>i never stop reading</p>
<p>about the negative</p>
<p>stuff but if i feel myself getting</p>
<p>caught in a</p>
<p>whirlpool of negativity</p>
<p>i pull myself out and do</p>
<p>others that&rsquo;s a very good</p>
<p>way to look at it yeah and i try and read some positive</p>
<p>things i try to balance it out with good news</p>
<p>technology generally is</p>
<p>where i find good news</p>
<p>and i read about like guys like cams</p>
<p>and his inventions of</p>
<p>water purification</p>
<p>you know different</p>
<p>stuff i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard this what is it oh the guy that invented the</p>
<p>you know the two wheeled</p>
<p>segway yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing all these</p>
<p>low tech devices to purify</p>
<p>water across africa that costs nothing to run</p>
<p>starting these like he&rsquo;s doing all</p>
<p>these positive</p>
<p>things for the</p>
<p>world using</p>
<p>technology and there&rsquo;s a lot of hope</p>
<p>in this section i try to balance my negative</p>
<p>stuff with that</p>
<p>yeah no that&rsquo;s a good way to do it man i mean you gotta</p>
<p>try to as much as you can manage the kind of</p>
<p>frequency that your mind carries around in</p>
<p>but this is a good segue</p>
<p>to my podcast that i want you to do</p>
<p>for 50 minutes on which</p>
<p>people on ever</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t put them up yet but it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>over interviewing all sorts of people from different</p>
<p>fields about how they</p>
<p>think the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna end and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna cause it what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s not gonna end</p>
<p>people are so</p>
<p>silly if people</p>
<p>ended for my podcast</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going anywhere man</p>
<p>or society society is</p>
<p>gonna morph</p>
<p>its look we are not amoebas anymore</p>
<p>and the universe</p>
<p>four billion years ain&rsquo;t shit to the universe</p>
<p>four billion years is fourteen billion</p>
<p>since you know the big bang so you just ten more to go</p>
<p>nine there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what fourteen years</p>
<p>for the big bang no nine billion till the big big bang</p>
<p>14 billion years ago the big bang happened i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s nine isn&rsquo;t it no</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>and they stretched that back and forth too</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a lot of times</p>
<p>they believe there&rsquo;s a new theory that it&rsquo;s a cyclical</p>
<p>thing and that the entire</p>
<p>cycle of the big bang to compression expansion is just</p>
<p>it goes on and on and on and on</p>
<p>forever oh yeah that&rsquo;s been the theory for a</p>
<p>while but also how</p>
<p>do you measure time when time itself is a relative sort</p>
<p>of component of a fourth dimension that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist prior to the big bang</p>
<p>so everything as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s expanding is actually kind of how do you go time</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s all subjective</p>
<p>for anybody else</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s impossible to wrap your head around because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s time on your tail</p>
<p>your fucking clock</p>
<p>says 10 o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>stupid yeah but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>traveling at a</p>
<p>quarter the speed of</p>
<p>light so it&rsquo;s actually nine</p>
<p>there is a measurement</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re measuring time like people that say time doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>silly because it does it</p>
<p>exists when you can measure it well</p>
<p>it gives illustration to entropy</p>
<p>right it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s not that time</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>because there really is no beginning and an end that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all the illusion the illusion is the shit that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking that</p>
<p>these distinct moments</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve created like</p>
<p>these beginning ends</p>
<p>the end time</p>
<p>exists the illusion is us</p>
<p>going forward</p>
<p>cause it could be either directional here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>proof that time</p>
<p>exists fucking cameras okay</p>
<p>cameras take</p>
<p>pictures of shit when you look different</p>
<p>stupid right time</p>
<p>exists it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on it&rsquo;s moving you hear that</p>
<p>stupid it just goes on forever</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re this</p>
<p>weird integer</p>
<p>in time you</p>
<p>know when you take a</p>
<p>video of something with your iphone you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>capturing you&rsquo;re capturing a very minuscule</p>
<p>point of something an</p>
<p>image of visualization from something that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>exist anymore</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>trippiest thing to watch</p>
<p>videos of people that are dead now</p>
<p>yeah but even</p>
<p>us we&rsquo;re not the same person we were</p>
<p>seven years ago</p>
<p>all of our cells in</p>
<p>every part of our body</p>
<p>has been exchanged for something that used to be there</p>
<p>except the neurons</p>
<p>which is fascinating because</p>
<p>the real question is</p>
<p>where are the memories held</p>
<p>where are the memories held</p>
<p>is all your memories just</p>
<p>second hand</p>
<p>stories that one cell told the next cell before</p>
<p>they died listen when we were a kid we fell off the</p>
<p>monkey bar that&rsquo;s how we</p>
<p>broke our arm</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget this critical</p>
<p>story the spear</p>
<p>fell on monkey bars when</p>
<p>sweaty palms</p>
<p>you know i mean how do i know that i fell off a</p>
<p>monkey bar when i was six and snapped my arm</p>
<p>i know i remember it i remember being in the hospital</p>
<p>if every brain cell in my body has been replaced</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>every seven years that&rsquo;s a long ass time</p>
<p>ago what the fuck happened how do i have this memory</p>
<p>but you do so a lot of the thoughts are</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re non</p>
<p>local maybe</p>
<p>memories and consciousness</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s non local</p>
<p>maybe the body</p>
<p>with the reason why when the body is deteriorated it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know ineffective at recalling memories</p>
<p>might not just be the memories there</p>
<p>and stored your body so your body&rsquo;s a shit antenna now</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t tune into</p>
<p>whatever the</p>
<p>frequency that your life is</p>
<p>operating we live on naboo with the people from avatar</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not telling you to tune into a tree bro</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>crazy for me man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of what it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>yeah i wonder if</p>
<p>because your memory</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just your</p>
<p>brain you have like</p>
<p>just your senses have a memory too right</p>
<p>so if you didn&rsquo;t actually go through something</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t feel like you had</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it depends how old you were when you did</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>think that memory is something that</p>
<p>everything has</p>
<p>that even houses and trees and cars and water</p>
<p>yeah everything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got a certain</p>
<p>sense of it do you know that japanese guy that does</p>
<p>things to water</p>
<p>is that real</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s fake most of the science is</p>
<p>absolutely you can&rsquo;t call it science there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>accurate research</p>
<p>yeah but i mean he&rsquo;s doing it sort of an artistic</p>
<p>thing what he&rsquo;s doing is taking</p>
<p>photographs of</p>
<p>things when he says evil</p>
<p>things to them</p>
<p>and praying for them and</p>
<p>thinking good</p>
<p>thoughts yeah that was originally illustrated the</p>
<p>movie down the</p>
<p>rabbit hole wasn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>yeah yeah and then</p>
<p>when you go online there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>because that was one of the after that</p>
<p>movie didn&rsquo;t you go online and look up a lot of shit</p>
<p>yeah i remember</p>
<p>going through that when</p>
<p>the research behind that was there&rsquo;s no been any</p>
<p>scientific true research that has had any effectual</p>
<p>well showing of that so but</p>
<p>does that mean that he lied</p>
<p>because if he took these</p>
<p>photos and he</p>
<p>really actively</p>
<p>took those photos no no i</p>
<p>think he did take those</p>
<p>photos but i don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re taking we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trusting somebody&rsquo;s word of</p>
<p>mouth for hmm</p>
<p>you know so no one&rsquo;s recreated is</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying i mean that&rsquo;s what science</p>
<p>need seems like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just water</p>
<p>how hard did it be to recreate that</p>
<p>it seems like if that was true then people</p>
<p>would be doing it all over the</p>
<p>place what do you need you need a</p>
<p>microscope camera a</p>
<p>microscope camera</p>
<p>and you need some water</p>
<p>how hard is it to get water</p>
<p>you know what the fuck what are you doing with the</p>
<p>water i&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of the positive thought</p>
<p>sort of movements you know like a</p>
<p>secret yeah</p>
<p>if you wish hard enough it&rsquo;ll happen</p>
<p>harry potter</p>
<p>generation well the really evil</p>
<p>thing is you know</p>
<p>i had a friend who was really into this</p>
<p>he was really telling me at one</p>
<p>point in time that you know he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even lock his doors</p>
<p>cause he doesn&rsquo;t believe in putting that out there and</p>
<p>i believe you create your destiny</p>
<p>i go yo listen to me right now</p>
<p>babies get shot</p>
<p>in drive bys yeah okay</p>
<p>those babies aren&rsquo;t creating</p>
<p>their fucking destiny</p>
<p>they get shot in drive bys</p>
<p>random shit</p>
<p>happens to people it can happen to you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>stupid and so few of</p>
<p>those babies were actually involved in</p>
<p>drug bank that</p>
<p>evolved yeah kind of baby zones bang</p>
<p>few of them but a few</p>
<p>one the dave</p>
<p>chappelle joke that i recall it was a little fuck</p>
<p>baby had babies</p>
<p>babies that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s like rocks</p>

<p>think you got</p>
<p>i like it too yeah he got a</p>
<p>ton of fucking</p>

<p>think what he likes to do now is just go up and do his</p>
<p>thing you know how</p>
<p>sweet with that yeah</p>
<p>so he shows up like</p>
<p>he did a show i</p>
<p>think it was in seattle</p>
<p>where he pulled up a fucking</p>
<p>like one of</p>
<p>those little mini</p>
<p>speakers and a</p>
<p>microphone in a park</p>
<p>and he just sat down and just</p>
<p>started doing comedy and</p>
<p>fucking two thousand people showed up and it was it was</p>
<p>ridiculous so that&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>could find it online that&rsquo;s how he</p>
<p>started did you know</p>
<p>that yeah i</p>
<p>watched him do it once</p>
<p>i was working with</p>
<p>him when he was like fucking god he was like eighteen</p>
<p>years old man it was in montreal the comedy festival</p>
<p>and we had both done sets it was like this is like</p>
<p>early 90s 93 94 something like that</p>
<p>and we both done sets upstairs at this</p>
<p>place called</p>
<p>club soda and we went outside and when we went outside</p>
<p>dave just all</p>
<p>these people around</p>
<p>dave stops what he&rsquo;s doing</p>

<p>comedy for y&rsquo;all gather around gather around</p>
<p>and he like</p>
<p>put his hat out and accept donations and shit</p>
<p>and he would do comedy he would do</p>

<p>still accepts donations</p>
<p>yeah probably</p>
<p>not anymore no he just does it but he used to</p>
<p>literally he</p>
<p>would just go out there and do fucking stand up</p>
<p>after a show</p>
<p>to a bunch of passerby&rsquo;s he</p>
<p>would stop them</p>
<p>organized and do it</p>
<p>apparently would do it all the time</p>
<p>yeah i remember</p>
<p>watching a sixty</p>
<p>minute special or</p>
<p>twenty twenty or one of</p>
<p>those new shows that were</p>
<p>giving a profile of him</p>
<p>and showing a</p>
<p>pictures of him on the streets of dc doing that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like do you ever feel like when you see someone doing</p>
<p>something like that like fuck why am i not doing that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going on do no not me at all man fuck that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to just grab you and say let</p>
<p>me give him my attention i&rsquo;m not that charming i got it</p>
<p>stand up because i&rsquo;m shy</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>i was afraid to talk to people and then like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know and then i got into it really</p>
<p>cause i love sam kennison</p>
<p>yeah me too</p>
<p>fucking changed my life</p>
<p>he changed mine too</p>
<p>a girl that i worked with</p>
<p>changed my life by doing a sam kennison bit for me</p>
<p>telling me how</p>
<p>funny this guy was and she just saw him on hbo that</p>
<p>night i was we were both nineteen</p>
<p>and she was this really cool</p>
<p>chick that i worked with it was</p>
<p>she was hilarious</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>she loved that kind of comedy she goes oh my god</p>
<p>the fucking boston accent</p>
<p>this fucking guy sam canis</p>
<p>oh my god he is so fucking</p>
<p>funny yeah this is what this guy does</p>
<p>and so she literally</p>
<p>does his bit out in the parking lot the bit</p>
<p>about the homosexual necrophiliacs</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s lying on her</p>
<p>stomach going oh</p>
<p>i mean life keeps fucking the ass even</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>it never ends</p>
<p>so think of like</p>
<p>this is my first introduction to sam kennison</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this girl with his</p>
<p>heavy boston accent</p>
<p>pretending to get fucked in the ass in a parking lot</p>
<p>and i was like whoa that&rsquo;s the craziest bit i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard in my life i was howling laughing</p>
<p>and then i went</p>
<p>out i got a hold of the tape like a couple of months</p>
<p>later and then i was like wow</p>
<p>okay this is comedy too</p>
<p>like i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that was comedy i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that was even</p>
<p>an option i thought comedy was like</p>
<p>what you see on the tonight show it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>it must be fun to be</p>
<p>funny but that&rsquo;s not how my</p>
<p>brain works i had no idea that that&rsquo;s what comedy was</p>
<p>about i was like</p>
<p>14 or 15 years old my brother sent me a tape of kinesin</p>
<p>and he was talking</p>
<p>about religion and i</p>
<p>you heard that</p>
<p>i grew up really</p>
<p>strict and i go you can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about jesus like this i was</p>
<p>laughing so hard to go fuck this this is what i need</p>
<p>to do in my life and from a fucking former preacher the</p>
<p>whole thing was like the package was so</p>
<p>ridiculous and</p>
<p>a guy who was a</p>
<p>victim of a head injury</p>
<p>you know that that</p>
<p>changed his personality</p>
<p>man i read his book brother bill his brother</p>

<p>different person</p>
<p>yeah became wild became volatile</p>
<p>you know something</p>
<p>screw got loose it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>thing we were</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>other day about</p>
<p>brain injuries and how</p>
<p>personality</p>
<p>transitions that people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pay enough attention to head injuries oh believe me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a part of my business i&rsquo;m around head</p>
<p>injuries all the time you see that ever do you ever</p>
<p>see some fighters</p>
<p>change over the course of</p>
<p>their you know</p>
<p>their career</p>

<p>especially guys who get cut from the usa</p>
<p>and they wind</p>
<p>up keep fighting in</p>
<p>other organizations and they lose like a</p>
<p>bunch of times by</p>
<p>knockout it gets really</p>
<p>weird when you&rsquo;re talking to them</p>
<p>because as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking to them like you can see a struggle</p>
<p>right you know like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all been in a situation where</p>
<p>maybe you just woke up or you got</p>
<p>a lot of shit on your mind and you&rsquo;re not that good at</p>
<p>forming a sentence</p>

<p>brains not working that good anymore</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a sad</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s a sad</p>
<p>thing there&rsquo;s a dullness to their eyes</p>
<p>and a struggle</p>
<p>and a you know</p>
<p>like a lost look</p>
<p>yeah like they want someone to help them like</p>
<p>those guys when they go</p>

<p>those years yeah yeah</p>
<p>between that and the alcohol</p>
<p>and but i never thought of</p>
<p>the head injuries i just thought of that believe me man</p>
<p>i used to get headaches</p>
<p>when when i</p>
<p>started when i</p>
<p>transitioned</p>
<p>from taekwondo to kickboxing i was like 21 years old</p>
<p>i had to do a lot of boxing</p>
<p>and when i did a lot of boxing</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t what i was good at</p>
<p>taekwondo was a more kicking oriented</p>
<p>sport so when i</p>
<p>started doing boxing i</p>
<p>started getting a lot of headaches</p>
<p>man it was bad i boxed for</p>
<p>three years too i fucking</p>
<p>loved it but did you yeah did you like the headaches</p>
<p>i never got the headaches i</p>
<p>could be honest with</p>
<p>you really well i&rsquo;m 6'4</p>
<p>and in my weight</p>
<p>class cause i was</p>
<p>fighting it i think</p>
<p>197 went 200 i was</p>
<p>fighting guys that were 5'4 200</p>
<p>so five four</p>
<p>two hundred pound we</p>
<p>fighting fucking neanderthals everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous i know i used to get the</p>
<p>shit kicked out of me once they got in within my reach</p>
<p>cause it just</p>
<p>be body blows nobody fucking take me down with my head</p>
<p>cause it just be straight through to my stomach</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not tall</p>
<p>for six four though</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense that everybody is</p>
<p>or for 197 pounds there&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>money boxing</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s people that are that tall</p>
<p>but i mean to have</p>
<p>so many guys who are that</p>
<p>short that are that</p>
<p>heavy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really unusual everybody in my boxing club is</p>
<p>short every now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s by the</p>
<p>clone a thing</p>
<p>by the way it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>where you you know</p>
<p>what level boxer are you</p>
<p>training with you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>training with a</p>
<p>bunch of killers</p>
<p>these in what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>style of boxing to some gyms they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spar hard they spar</p>
<p>smart you know</p>
<p>and they control each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>well we got</p>
<p>down to the taekwondo club because the guy that was</p>
<p>teaching down there wanting help there</p>
<p>because he said the guys</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>punching properly enough</p>
<p>right enough so we used</p>
<p>to interchange and spa with the people in taekwondo</p>
<p>as i remember having a great</p>
<p>great little little match</p>
<p>going on and then the guy getting</p>
<p>frustrated and fucking turning around and</p>
<p>sweeping my legs</p>
<p>i gotta nowhere</p>
<p>well yeah people do get</p>
<p>frustrated when</p>
<p>sparring it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>creepy thing it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>fighting but not yeah</p>
<p>you know and a lot of times it becomes</p>
<p>fighting but the</p>
<p>thing the idea</p>
<p>about headaches i mean i was fine</p>
<p>and never got</p>
<p>in any like serious damage or concussions or anything</p>
<p>like that but you know that it&rsquo;s possible and it</p>
<p>could be coming</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>these are the</p>
<p>first blows this headache that you get</p>
<p>what if this is</p>
<p>every day for the rest of your life what if you had to</p>
<p>drink to try to just</p>
<p>numb this and dull this down</p>
<p>and a lot of people that involved in football</p>
<p>and combat sports</p>
<p>anything anything really extreme you know</p>
<p>especially boxing because they take some</p>
<p>like you remember</p>
<p>terry norris</p>
<p>and that guy</p>
