    <p>The following is a conversation with Guido van Rossum,</p>
<p>his second time on this podcast.</p>
<p>He is the creator of the Python Programming Language</p>
<p>and is Python&rsquo;s Emeritus BDFL, Benevolent Dictator for Life.</p>
<p>And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got GiveDirectly for philanthropy,</p>
<p>8sleep for naps, Fundrise for real estate investing,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for biodata,</p>
<p>and Athletic Greens for nutritional health.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by GiveDirectly,</p>
<p>a nonprofit that lets you send cash directly</p>
<p>to the people that need it.</p>
<p>GiveDirectly donors include previous guests</p>
<p>of this podcast, Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk,</p>
<p>Metallic Buterin, all of whom happen to be,</p>
<p>actually not Jack, Jack only has been on once.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s going to be on again</p>
<p>many more times, he&rsquo;s a fascinating human being.</p>
<p>Anyway, Elon too, he&rsquo;ll be back on soon.</p>
<p>And of course Metallic as well, after the merge.</p>
<p>Anyway, all of that to say that the idea of giving directly</p>
<p>to the people that need it is actually</p>
<p>a really powerful way to help people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of science, there&rsquo;s a lot of studies</p>
<p>behind it that showed that getting cash directly</p>
<p>to the people that need it is actually</p>
<p>the best way to help them.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of philanthropy is based on the idea</p>
<p>that you could have a lot of middlemen</p>
<p>and you kind of fund that chain that&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to optimally redistribute the funding.</p>
<p>And okay, there might be some interesting aspects</p>
<p>to that idea, but what I think is especially interesting</p>
<p>is that when you remove all of those middlemen</p>
<p>and you give directly to the people that need it,</p>
<p>is actually really effective.</p>
<p>I frankly love that idea.</p>
<p>You can visit givedirectly.org slash Lex to learn more</p>
<p>and send cash directly to someone living in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s givedirectly.org slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Eight Sleep</p>
<p>and its new Pod 3 mattress.</p>
<p>I love taking naps.</p>
<p>I got very little sleep last night.</p>
<p>I just had a crazy pile of tasks to finish</p>
<p>and I had a crazy busy day today.</p>
<p>So after I&rsquo;m done recording these very words</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m speaking to you, I&rsquo;m going to go lay down</p>
<p>on an Eight Sleep bed, cold mattress, warm blanket,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to pass out for 20, 25, 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to, as opposed to feeling a little bit tired,</p>
<p>a little bit mentally exhausted, you know,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit not so motivated to do work,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to feel like a new human being,</p>
<p>excited to get right back into the trenches of programming</p>
<p>and taking on the rest of the day,</p>
<p>just powering through, super productive.</p>
<p>All of that, thank you to a comfortable,</p>
<p>enriching, joyful nap.</p>
<p>Check it out and get special holiday savings</p>
<p>of up to $400 when you go to eightsleep.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Fundrise,</p>
<p>spelled F-U-N-D-R-I-S-E.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a platform that allows you to invest</p>
<p>in private real estate.</p>
<p>As you know, looking at different markets</p>
<p>and investment opportunities and all the crazy</p>
<p>financial stuff that&rsquo;s going out there in the world,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good idea to diversify.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why private real estate</p>
<p>is an interesting place to diversify in.</p>
<p>And of course, when you do that kind of diversification,</p>
<p>you should be using the services that make it super easy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be an expert in what&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>in this kind of investment.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to go through super complicated paperwork</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got everything for you.</p>
<p>They figure out what are good real estate projects</p>
<p>to invest in and make it super easy for you</p>
<p>to do so over 150,000 investors use it.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>It takes just a few minutes to get started</p>
<p>at Fundrise.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data</p>
<p>that comes from my body, is fed in as the raw signal</p>
<p>into machine learning algorithms, the DNA data,</p>
<p>fitness tracker data, blood data, all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>goes into the machine learning algorithm</p>
<p>and gives a prediction, a recommendation</p>
<p>about what I should do with my diet and lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>This is obviously the early steps</p>
<p>in what will make the 21st century incredible,</p>
<p>which is the personalization, the depersonalization.</p>
<p>Both medicine, lifestyle, diet, everything,</p>
<p>career choices, mentorship, everything</p>
<p>should be coming from rich, raw signal</p>
<p>coming from your body.</p>
<p>Maybe one day coming from your brain.</p>
<p>If you have BCIs, brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>like Neuralink operating, this is such an exciting future.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge supporter of this kind of future.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s done right, if it&rsquo;s done in a way</p>
<p>that respects people&rsquo;s privacy and people&rsquo;s rights,</p>
<p>this is really, really a great way</p>
<p>to help individuals optimize their life</p>
<p>and get special savings for a limited time</p>
<p>when you go to insidetracker.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s AG1 Drink, which is an all-in-one daily drink</p>
<p>to support better health and peak performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my zen temple that I return to twice a day.</p>
<p>After a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the first thing I drink every day.</p>
<p>I also drink it after a long run.</p>
<p>And it gives me a certainty</p>
<p>that I have all my nutritional bases covered.</p>
<p>So all the crazy kind of diet stuff I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m fasting, if I&rsquo;m doing one meal a day,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m doing carnivore, just a little carb,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Or if I&rsquo;m fasting for multiple days</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m doing crazy stretches of work</p>
<p>or exercise to both the mental and the physical fatigue,</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;m doing to my body</p>
<p>in terms of challenging it,</p>
<p>I know I have that basis covered.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like a multivitamin,</p>
<p>but amazing multivitamin.</p>
<p>I highly, highly recommend it.</p>
<p>And plus, it also tastes good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you one month&rsquo;s supply of fish oil</p>
<p>when you sign up at athleticgreens.com slash Lex.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Guido Van Rossum.</p>
<p>Python 3.11 is coming out very soon.</p>
<p>In it, CPython claim to be</p>
<p>10 to 60% faster.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you pull that off?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s CPython?</p>
<p>CPython is the last Python implementation standing,</p>
<p>also the first one that was ever created.</p>
<p>The original Python implementation</p>
<p>that I started over 30 years ago.</p>
<p>So what does it mean that Python,</p>
<p>the programming language,</p>
<p>is implemented in another programming language called C?</p>
<p>What kind of audience do you have in mind here?</p>
<p>People who know programming?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s somebody on a boat that&rsquo;s into fishing</p>
<p>and have never heard about programming,</p>
<p>but also some world-class programmers.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna have to speak to both.</p>
<p>Imagine a boat with two people.</p>
<p>One of them has not heard about programming,</p>
<p>is really into fishing.</p>
<p>And the other one is like an incredible</p>
<p>Silicon Valley programmer that&rsquo;s programmed in everything.</p>
<p>C, C++, Python, Rust, Java.</p>
<p>He knows the entire history of programming languages.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna have to speak to both.</p>
<p>I imagine that boat in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna please the guy</p>
<p>who knows how to fish first.</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>He seems like the most useful in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>You gotta make him happy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he has a cell phone.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s probably very suspicious</p>
<p>about what goes on in that cell phone,</p>
<p>but he must have heard that inside a cell phone</p>
<p>is a tiny computer.</p>
<p>And a programming language is computer code</p>
<p>that tells the computer what to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very low level language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s zeros and ones, and then there&rsquo;s assembly.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk about these really low levels</p>
<p>because those just confuse people.</p>
<p>I mean, when we&rsquo;re talking about human language,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not usually talking about vocal tracts</p>
<p>and how you position your tongue.</p>
<p>I was talking yesterday about how</p>
<p>when you have a Chinese person and they speak English,</p>
<p>this is a bit of a stereotype they often don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t seem to make the difference well</p>
<p>between an L and an R.</p>
<p>And I have a theory about that,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never checked this with linguists,</p>
<p>that it probably has to do with the fact that in Chinese,</p>
<p>there is not really a difference.</p>
<p>And it could be that there are regional variations</p>
<p>in how native Chinese speakers pronounce that one sound</p>
<p>that sounds to L to some,</p>
<p>like L to some of them, like R to others.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both the sounds you produce with your mouth</p>
<p>throughout the history of your life</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re used to listening to.</p>
<p>I mean, every language has that.</p>
<p>Russian has-</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The Slavic languages have sounds like zh,</p>
<p>the letter zh.</p>
<p>Like Americans or English speakers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t seem to know the sound zh.</p>
<p>They seem uncomfortable with that sound.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, oh yes.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re not going to the shapes of tongues</p>
<p>and the sounds that the mouth can make.</p>
<p>Fine, words.</p>
<p>And similarly, we&rsquo;re not going into the ones and zeros</p>
<p>or machine language.</p>
<p>I would say a programming language</p>
<p>is a list of instructions,</p>
<p>like a cookbook recipe</p>
<p>that sort of tells you how to do a certain thing,</p>
<p>like make a sandwich.</p>
<p>Well, acquire a loaf of bread, cut it in slices,</p>
<p>take two slices, put mustard on one,</p>
<p>put jelly on the other or something,</p>
<p>then add the meat, then add the cheese.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that science teachers</p>
<p>can actually do great stuff with recipes like that</p>
<p>and trying to interpret their students&rsquo; instructions</p>
<p>incorrectly until the students</p>
<p>are completely unambiguous about it.</p>
<p>With language, see, that&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between natural languages and programming languages.</p>
<p>I think ambiguity is a feature,</p>
<p>not a bug in human spoken languages.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the dance of communication between humans.</p>
<p>Well, for lawyers, ambiguity certainly is a feature.</p>
<p>For plenty of other cases,</p>
<p>the ambiguity is not much of a feature,</p>
<p>but we work around it, of course.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more important is context.</p>
<p>So with context, the precision of the statement</p>
<p>becomes more and more concrete, right?</p>
<p>But when you say I love you</p>
<p>to a person that matters a lot to you,</p>
<p>the person doesn&rsquo;t try to compile that statement</p>
<p>and return an error saying please define love, right?</p>
<p>No, but I imagine that my wife and my son</p>
<p>interpret it very differently.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s the same three words.</p>
<p>But imprecisely still.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>Lawyers have a lot of follow-up questions for you.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the context is already different in that case.</p>
<p>Yes, fair enough.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a programming language</p>
<p>is ability to unambiguously state a recipe.</p>
<p>Actually, let&rsquo;s go back.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to PEP8.</p>
<p>You go through in PEP8 the style guide for Python code</p>
<p>some ideas of what this language should look like,</p>
<p>feel like, read like.</p>
<p>And the big idea there is that code readability counts.</p>
<p>What does that mean to you?</p>
<p>And how do we achieve it?</p>
<p>So this recipe should be readable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a thing between programmers.</p>
<p>Because on the one hand,</p>
<p>we always explain the concept of programming language</p>
<p>as computers need instructions</p>
<p>and computers are very dumb</p>
<p>and they need very precise instructions</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have much context.</p>
<p>In fact, they have lots of context</p>
<p>but their context is very different.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;ve seen emerge</p>
<p>during the development of software</p>
<p>starting in the probably in the late forties</p>
<p>is that software is a very social activity.</p>
<p>A software developer is not a mad scientist</p>
<p>who sits alone in his lab writing brilliant code.</p>
<p>A software is developed by teams of people.</p>
<p>Even the mad scientist sitting alone in his lab</p>
<p>can type fast enough to produce enough code</p>
<p>so that by the time he&rsquo;s done with his coding,</p>
<p>he still remembers what the first few lines he wrote mean.</p>
<p>So even the mad scientist coding alone in his lab</p>
<p>would be sort of wise to adopt conventions</p>
<p>on how to format the instructions</p>
<p>that he gives to the computer.</p>
<p>So that the thing is there is a difference</p>
<p>between a cookbook recipe and a computer program.</p>
<p>The cookbook recipe,</p>
<p>the author of the cookbook writes it once</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s printed in a hundred thousand copies.</p>
<p>And then lots of people in their kitchens</p>
<p>try to recreate that recipe,</p>
<p>that particular pie or dish from the recipe.</p>
<p>And so there the goal of the cookbook author</p>
<p>is to make it clear to the human reader of the recipe,</p>
<p>the human amateur chef in most cases.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re writing a computer program,</p>
<p>you have two audiences at once.</p>
<p>It needs to tell the computer what to do,</p>
<p>but it also is useful if that program</p>
<p>is readable by other programmers.</p>
<p>Because computer software,</p>
<p>unlike the typical recipe for a cherry pie,</p>
<p>is so complex that you don&rsquo;t get all of it right at once.</p>
<p>You end up with the activity of debugging</p>
<p>and you end up with the activity of&hellip;</p>
<p>So debugging is trying to figure out</p>
<p>why your code doesn&rsquo;t run the way</p>
<p>you thought it should run.</p>
<p>That means broadly, it could be stupid little errors</p>
<p>or it could be big logical errors.</p>
<p>It could be anything.</p>
<p>Spiritual.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be anything from a typo</p>
<p>to a wrong choice of algorithm</p>
<p>to building something that does what you tell it to do,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not useful.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems to work really well 99% of the time,</p>
<p>but does weird things 1% of the time on some edge cases.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much all software nowadays.</p>
<p>All good software, right?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, for bad software.</p>
<p>That 99 goes down a lot.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just about the complexity of the program.</p>
<p>Like you said, it is a social endeavor</p>
<p>in that you&rsquo;re constantly improving that recipe</p>
<p>for the cherry pie.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re in a group of people improving that recipe.</p>
<p>Or the mad scientist is improving the recipe</p>
<p>that he created a year ago and making it better.</p>
<p>Or adding something.</p>
<p>He decides that he wants, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>he wants some decoration on his pie or icing or&hellip;</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s broad philosophical things</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s specific advice on style.</p>
<p>So first of all, the thing that people first experience</p>
<p>when they look at Python,</p>
<p>there is a, it is very readable,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also like a spatial structure to it.</p>
<p>Can you explain the indentation style of Python</p>
<p>and what is the magic to it?</p>
<p>Spaces are important for readability of any kind of text.</p>
<p>If you take a cookbook recipe</p>
<p>and you remove all the sort of,</p>
<p>all the bullets and other markup</p>
<p>and you just crunch all the text together,</p>
<p>maybe you leave the spaces between the words,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s all you leave.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in the kitchen trying to figure out,</p>
<p>oh, what are the ingredients and what are the steps?</p>
<p>And where does this step end and the next step begin?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s just one solid block of text.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what a typical cookbook does</p>
<p>if the paper is not too expensive,</p>
<p>each recipe starts on its own page.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a picture next to it.</p>
<p>The list of ingredients comes first.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a standard notation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s shortcuts so that you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>sort of write two sentences on how you have to cut the onion</p>
<p>because there are only three ways</p>
<p>that people ever cut onions in a kitchen,</p>
<p>small, medium, and in slices.</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>None of my examples make any sense</p>
<p>to real cooks, of course, but.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking to programmers</p>
<p>with a metaphor of cooking, I love it.</p>
<p>But there is a strictness to the spacing</p>
<p>that Python defines.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some looser things, some stricter things,</p>
<p>but the four spaces for the indentation</p>
<p>is really interesting.</p>
<p>It really defines what the language looks</p>
<p>or feels like.</p>
<p>Because indentation sort of taking a block of text</p>
<p>and then having inside that block of text</p>
<p>a smaller block of text that is indented further</p>
<p>as sort of a group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have a bulleted list</p>
<p>in a complex business document</p>
<p>and inside some of the bullets are other bulleted lists.</p>
<p>You will indent those too.</p>
<p>If each bulleted list is indented several inches,</p>
<p>then at two levels deep, there&rsquo;s no space left on the page</p>
<p>to put any of the words of the text.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t indent too far.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don&rsquo;t indent at all,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tell whether something is a top level bullet</p>
<p>or a second level bullet or a third level bullet.</p>
<p>So you have to have some compromise</p>
<p>and based on ancient conventions</p>
<p>and sort of the typical width of a computer screen</p>
<p>in the 80s and all sorts of things,</p>
<p>sort of we came up with sort of four spaces as a compromise.</p>
<p>I mean, there are groups,</p>
<p>there are large groups of people</p>
<p>who code with two spaces per indent level.</p>
<p>For example, the Google style guide,</p>
<p>all the Google Python code,</p>
<p>and I think also all the Google C++ code</p>
<p>is indented with only two spaces per block.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not used to that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to at a glance understand the code</p>
<p>because the sort of the high level structure</p>
<p>is determined by the indentation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are other programming languages</p>
<p>where the indentation is eight spaces</p>
<p>or a whole tab stop in sort of classic Unix.</p>
<p>And to me, that looks weird</p>
<p>because you sort of after three indent levels,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got no room left.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s some languages</p>
<p>where the indentation is a recommendation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stylistic one.</p>
<p>The code compiles even without any indentation.</p>
<p>And then Python really,</p>
<p>indentation is a fundamental part of the language, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be four spaces.</p>
<p>So you can code Python with two spaces per block</p>
<p>or six spaces or 12 if you really want to go wild,</p>
<p>but sort of everything that belongs to the same block</p>
<p>needs to be indented the same way.</p>
<p>In practice, in most other languages,</p>
<p>people recommend doing that anyway.</p>
<p>If you look at C or Rust or C++,</p>
<p>all those languages, Java,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a requirement of indentation,</p>
<p>but except in extreme cases,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just as anal about</p>
<p>having their code properly indented.</p>
<p>So any IDE that does syntax highlighting</p>
<p>that works with Java or C++,</p>
<p>they will yell at you aggressively</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t do proper indentation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d suggest the proper indentation for you.</p>
<p>Like in C, you type a few words</p>
<p>and then you type a curly brace,</p>
<p>which is their notion of sort of begin an indented block.</p>
<p>Then you hit return</p>
<p>and then it automatically indents four or eight spaces,</p>
<p>depending on your style preferences</p>
<p>or how your editor is configured.</p>
<p>Was there a possible universe</p>
<p>in which you considered having braces in Python?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>Was it 60, 40, 70, 30 in your head?</p>
<p>What was the trade-off?</p>
<p>For a long time,</p>
<p>I was actually convinced that the indentation</p>
<p>was just better.</p>
<p>Without context,</p>
<p>I would still claim that indentation is better.</p>
<p>It reduces clutter.</p>
<p>However, as I started to say earlier,</p>
<p>context is almost everything.</p>
<p>And in the context of coding,</p>
<p>most programmers are familiar with multiple languages,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re only good at one or two.</p>
<p>And apart from Python and maybe Fortran,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s written these days anymore,</p>
<p>but all the other languages,</p>
<p>Java, Rust, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Perl,</p>
<p>are all using curly braces to sort of indicate blocks.</p>
<p>And so Python is the odd one out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a radical idea.</p>
<p>Do you still, as a radical renegade revolutionary,</p>
<p>do you still stand behind this idea</p>
<p>of indentation versus braces?</p>
<p>Like what, can you dig into it a little bit more?</p>
<p>Why you still stand behind indentation?</p>
<p>Because context is not the whole story.</p>
<p>History, in a sense, provides more context.</p>
<p>So for Python, there is no chance that we can switch.</p>
<p>Python is using curly braces for something else,</p>
<p>dictionaries mostly.</p>
<p>We would get in trouble if we wanted to switch.</p>
<p>Just like you couldn&rsquo;t redefine C to use indentation,</p>
<p>even if you agree that indentation</p>
<p>sort of in a greenfield environment would be better.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t change that kind of thing in a language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard enough to reach agreement</p>
<p>over much more minor details.</p>
<p>Maybe, I mean, in the past in Python,</p>
<p>we did have a big debate about tabs versus spaces</p>
<p>and four spaces versus fewer or more.</p>
<p>And we sort of came up with a recommended standard</p>
<p>and sort of options for people who want to be different.</p>
<p>But yes, I guess the thought experiment</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to consider is if you could travel back</p>
<p>through time when the compatibility is not an issue</p>
<p>and you started Python all over again,</p>
<p>can you make the case for indentation still?</p>
<p>Well, it frees up a pair of matched brackets</p>
<p>of which there are never enough in the world</p>
<p>for other purposes.</p>
<p>It really makes the language slightly</p>
<p>sort of easier to grasp for people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t already know another programming language.</p>
<p>Because sort of one of the things,</p>
<p>and I mostly got this from my mentors</p>
<p>who taught me programming language design</p>
<p>in the earlier 80s.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re teaching programming</p>
<p>for the total newbie who has not coded before</p>
<p>in not in any other language,</p>
<p>a whole bunch of concepts in programming are very alien</p>
<p>or sort of new and maybe very interesting,</p>
<p>but also distracting and confusing.</p>
<p>And there are many different things you have to learn.</p>
<p>You have to sort of,</p>
<p>in a typical 13 week programming course,</p>
<p>you have to, if it&rsquo;s like really learning</p>
<p>to program from scratch,</p>
<p>you have to cover algorithms,</p>
<p>you have to cover data structures,</p>
<p>you have to cover syntax,</p>
<p>you have to cover variables, loops, functions,</p>
<p>recursion, classes, expressions, operators.</p>
<p>There are so many concepts if you sort of,</p>
<p>if you can spend a little less time</p>
<p>having to worry about the syntax.</p>
<p>The classic example was often,</p>
<p>oh, the compiler complains every time I put a semicolon</p>
<p>in the wrong place or I forget to put a semicolon.</p>
<p>Python doesn&rsquo;t have semicolons in that sense.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t forget them.</p>
<p>And you are also not sort of misled</p>
<p>into putting them where they don&rsquo;t belong</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t learn about them in the first place.</p>
<p>The flip side of that is forcing the strictness</p>
<p>onto the beginning programmer</p>
<p>to teach them that programming</p>
<p>values attention to details.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to just write the way you write in English.</p>
<p>Plenty of other details that they have to pay attention to.</p>
<p>So I think they&rsquo;ll still get the message</p>
<p>about paying attention to details.</p>
<p>The interesting design choice,</p>
<p>I still program quite a bit in PHP</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s other languages like this,</p>
<p>but the dollar sign before a variable,</p>
<p>that was always an annoying thing for me.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t quite fit into my understanding</p>
<p>of why this is good for a programming language.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you ever thought about that one.</p>
<p>That is a historical thing.</p>
<p>There is a whole lineage of programming languages.</p>
<p>PHP is one.</p>
<p>Perl was one.</p>
<p>The Unix shell is one of the oldest</p>
<p>or all the different shells.</p>
<p>The dollar was invented for that purpose</p>
<p>because the very earliest shells had a notion of scripting,</p>
<p>but they did not have a notion</p>
<p>of parameterizing the scripting, right?</p>
<p>And so a script is just a few lines of text</p>
<p>where each line of text is a command</p>
<p>that is read by a very primitive command processor</p>
<p>that then sort of takes the first word on the line</p>
<p>as the name of a program</p>
<p>and passes all the rest of the line as text</p>
<p>into the program for the program</p>
<p>to figure out what to do with as arguments.</p>
<p>And so by the time scripting was slightly more mature</p>
<p>than the very first script,</p>
<p>there was a convention that just like the first word</p>
<p>on the line is the name of the program,</p>
<p>the following words could be names of files.</p>
<p>Input.text, output.html, things like that.</p>
<p>The next thing that happens is,</p>
<p>oh, it would actually be really nice</p>
<p>if we could have variables</p>
<p>and especially parameters for scripts.</p>
<p>Parameters are usually what starts this process.</p>
<p>But now you have a problem</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t just say the parameters are X, Y, and Z.</p>
<p>And so now we call, say, let&rsquo;s say X is the input file</p>
<p>and Y is the output file,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s forget about Z for now.</p>
<p>I have my program and I write program X, Y.</p>
<p>Well, that already has a meaning</p>
<p>because that presumably means X itself is the file.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a file name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a variable name.</p>
<p>And so the inventors of things like the Unix shell</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure job command language at IBM before that,</p>
<p>had to use something that made it clear</p>
<p>to the script processor,</p>
<p>here is an X that is not actually the name of a file,</p>
<p>which you just pass through to the program you&rsquo;re running.</p>
<p>Here is an X that is the name of a variable.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re writing a script processor,</p>
<p>you try to keep it as simple as possible</p>
<p>because certainly in the 50s and 60s,</p>
<p>the thing that interprets the script</p>
<p>was itself had to be a very small program</p>
<p>because it had to fit in a very small part of memory.</p>
<p>And so saying, oh, just look at each character.</p>
<p>And if you see a dollar sign,</p>
<p>you jump to another section of the code</p>
<p>and then you gobble up characters</p>
<p>or say until the next space or something,</p>
<p>and you say that&rsquo;s the variable name.</p>
<p>And so it was sort of invented</p>
<p>as a clever way to make parsing of things</p>
<p>that contain both variable and fixed parts,</p>
<p>very easy in a very simple script processor.</p>
<p>It also helps even then,</p>
<p>it also helps the human author</p>
<p>and the human reader of the script to quickly see,</p>
<p>oh, 20 lines down in the script,</p>
<p>I see a reference to X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>Oh, it has a dollar in front of it.</p>
<p>So now we know that X, Y, Z</p>
<p>must be one of the parameters of the script.</p>
<p>Well, this is fascinating.</p>
<p>Several things to say,</p>
<p>which is the leftovers</p>
<p>from the simple script processor languages</p>
<p>are now in code bases like behind Facebook</p>
<p>or behind most of the backend.</p>
<p>I think PHP is probably still runs</p>
<p>most of the backend of the internet.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of it in Wikipedia too,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that those decisions,</p>
<p>or not funny, it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>that those decisions permeate through time.</p>
<p>Just like biological systems, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the inner workings of DNA</p>
<p>have been stable for,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t know how long it was,</p>
<p>like 300 million years, half a billion years.</p>
<p>And there are all sorts of weird quirks there</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t make a lot of sense</p>
<p>if you were to design a system</p>
<p>like self-replicating molecules from scratch.</p>
<p>Well, that system has a lot of interesting resilience.</p>
<p>It has redundancy that results,</p>
<p>like it messes up in interesting ways</p>
<p>that still is resilient</p>
<p>when you look at the system level of the organism.</p>
<p>Code doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have that,</p>
<p>a computer programming code.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how much resilience modern code has.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at the number of bugs per line of code,</p>
<p>even in very well-tested code</p>
<p>that in practice works just fine,</p>
<p>there are actually lots of things that don&rsquo;t work fine.</p>
<p>And there are error correcting</p>
<p>or self-correcting mechanisms at many levels.</p>
<p>Including probably the user of the code.</p>
<p>Well, in the end, the user who sort of is told,</p>
<p>well, you got to reboot your PC,</p>
<p>is part of that system.</p>
<p>And a slightly less drastic thing is reload the page,</p>
<p>which we all know how to do without thinking about it</p>
<p>when something weird happens.</p>
<p>You try to reload a few times before you say,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s something really weird.</p>
<p>Okay, or try to click the button again</p>
<p>if the first time didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, we should all have learned not to do that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s probably just gonna turn the light back off.</p>
<p>Yeah, true.</p>
<p>So do it three times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the right lesson.</p>
<p>And I wonder how many people actually like the dollar sign.</p>
<p>Like you said, it is documentation.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s whatever the opposite of syntactic sugar</p>
<p>is syntactic poison.</p>
<p>To me, it is such a pain in the ass</p>
<p>that I have to type in a dollar sign.</p>
<p>Also super error prone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not self-documenting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a bug generating thing.</p>
<p>It is a kind of documentation that&rsquo;s the pro</p>
<p>and the con is it&rsquo;s a source of a lot of bugs.</p>
<p>But actually I have to ask you,</p>
<p>this is a really interesting idea of bugs per line of code.</p>
<p>If you look at all the computer systems out there,</p>
<p>from the code that runs nuclear weapons</p>
<p>to the code that runs all the amazing companies</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been involved with and not,</p>
<p>the code that runs Twitter and Facebook and Dropbox</p>
<p>and Google and Microsoft Windows and so on.</p>
<p>And we like laid out,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that be a cool like table?</p>
<p>Bugs per line of code.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s put like actual companies aside.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;d be surprised by the number we see there</p>
<p>for all these companies?</p>
<p>That depends on whether you&rsquo;ve ever read about research</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been done in this area before.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know that the last time</p>
<p>I saw some research like that,</p>
<p>there was probably in the nineties</p>
<p>and the research might&rsquo;ve been done in the eighties.</p>
<p>But the conclusion was across</p>
<p>a wide range of different software,</p>
<p>different languages, different companies,</p>
<p>different development styles.</p>
<p>The number of bugs is always,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s in the order of about one bug per thousand lines</p>
<p>in sort of mature software that is considered</p>
<p>as good as it gets.</p>
<p>Can I give you some facts here?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of papers.</p>
<p>So you said mature software, right?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a report from a programming analytics company.</p>
<p>Now this is from a developer perspective.</p>
<p>Let me just say what it says</p>
<p>because this is very weird and surprising.</p>
<p>On average, a developer creates 70 bugs</p>
<p>per 1000 lines of code.</p>
<p>15 bugs per 1000 lines of code</p>
<p>find their way to the customers.</p>
<p>This is in software they&rsquo;ve analyzed.</p>
<p>I was wrong by an order of magnitude there.</p>
<p>Fixing a bug takes 30 times longer</p>
<p>than writing a line of code.</p>
<p>That I can believe.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>75% of a developer&rsquo;s time is spent on debugging.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for an average developer.</p>
<p>They analyze this 1500 hours a year.</p>
<p>In US alone, $113 billion is spent annually</p>
<p>on identifying and fixing bugs.</p>
<p>And I imagine this is marketing literature</p>
<p>for someone who claims to have a golden bullet</p>
<p>or a silver bullet that makes all that investment</p>
<p>in fixing bugs go away.</p>
<p>But that is usually not going to happen.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, they&rsquo;re referencing a lot of stuff,</p>
<p>of course, but it is a page that is,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a contact us button at the bottom.</p>
<p>Presumably, if you just spend a little bit less</p>
<p>than $100 billion, we&rsquo;re willing to solve</p>
<p>the problem for you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a report on Stack Exchange</p>
<p>and Stack Overflow on the exact same topic.</p>
<p>But when I open it up at the moment,</p>
<p>the page says Stack Overflow is currently offline</p>
<p>for maintenance.</p>
<p>Oh, that is ironic.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>By the way, their error page is awesome.</p>
<p>Anyway, I mean, can you believe that number of bugs?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that scary?</p>
<p>That 70 bugs per 1000 lines of code.</p>
<p>So even 10 bugs per 1000 lines of code.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s about one bug every 15 lines,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re first typing it in.</p>
<p>Yeah, from a developer, but like,</p>
<p>how many bugs are going to be found?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re typing it in?</p>
<p>Well, the development process is extremely iterative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Typically, you don&rsquo;t make a plan for what software</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to release a year from now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And work out all the details,</p>
<p>because actually all the details themselves consist,</p>
<p>they sort of compose a program.</p>
<p>And that being a program,</p>
<p>all your plans will have bugs in them too,</p>
<p>and inaccuracies.</p>
<p>But what you actually do is,</p>
<p>you do a bunch of typing,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m actually really,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a really bad typist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;ve never learned to type with 10 fingers.</p>
<p>How many do you use?</p>
<p>Well, I use all 10 of them, but not very well.</p>
<p>But I never took a typing class,</p>
<p>and I never sort of corrected that.</p>
<p>So the first time I seriously learned,</p>
<p>I had to learn the layout of a QWERTY keyboard,</p>
<p>was actually in college, in my first programming classes,</p>
<p>where we used punch cards.</p>
<p>And so with my two fingers,</p>
<p>I sort of pecked out my code.</p>
<p>Watch anyone give you a little coding demonstration.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have to produce like four lines of code,</p>
<p>and now see how many times they use the backspace key.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because they made a mistake.</p>
<p>And some people, especially when someone else is looking,</p>
<p>will backspace over 20, 30, 40 characters</p>
<p>to fix a typo earlier in a line.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re slightly more experienced,</p>
<p>of course you use your arrow buttons to go,</p>
<p>or your mouse to,</p>
<p>but the mouse is usually slower than the arrows.</p>
<p>But a lot of people,</p>
<p>when they type a 20 character word,</p>
<p>which is not unusual,</p>
<p>and they realize they made a mistake</p>
<p>at the start of the word,</p>
<p>they backspace over the whole thing,</p>
<p>and then retype it.</p>
<p>And sometimes it takes three, four times to get it right.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what your definition of bug is,</p>
<p>arguably mistyping a word,</p>
<p>and then correcting it immediately is not a bug.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>you already do sort of lose time.</p>
<p>And every once in a while,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of a typo that you don&rsquo;t get in that process.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;ve typed like 10 lines of code,</p>
<p>and somewhere in the middle of it,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know where yet is a typo,</p>
<p>or maybe a thinko where you forgot</p>
<p>that you had to initialize a variable or something.</p>
<p>But those are two different things.</p>
<p>And I would say, yes,</p>
<p>you have to actually run the code to discover that typo,</p>
<p>but forgetting to initialize a variable</p>
<p>is a fundamentally different thing,</p>
<p>because that thing can go undiscovered.</p>
<p>That depends on the language.</p>
<p>In Python, it will not.</p>
<p>And sort of modern compilers</p>
<p>are usually pretty good at catching that, even for C.</p>
<p>So for that specific thing,</p>
<p>but actually deeper,</p>
<p>there might be another variable that is initialized,</p>
<p>but logically speaking, the one you meant-</p>
<p>Related.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like name the same, but it&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>And you forgot to initialize whatever,</p>
<p>like some counter or some basic variable</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using-</p>
<p>I can tell that you&rsquo;ve coded.</p>
<p>By the way, I should mention</p>
<p>that I use a Kinesis keyboard,</p>
<p>which has the backspace under the thumb.</p>
<p>And one of the biggest reasons I use that keyboard</p>
<p>is because you realize,</p>
<p>in order to use the backspace on a usual keyboard,</p>
<p>you have to stretch your pinky out.</p>
<p>And like, for most normal keyboards,</p>
<p>the backspace is under the pinky.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if people realize</p>
<p>the pain they go through in their life</p>
<p>because of the backspace key being so far away.</p>
<p>So with the Kinesis, it&rsquo;s right under the thumb,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to actually move your hands.</p>
<p>The backspace and the delete-</p>
<p>What do you do if you&rsquo;re ever not with your own keyboard</p>
<p>and you have to use someone else&rsquo;s PC keyboard</p>
<p>that has that standard layout?</p>
<p>So first of all, it turns out</p>
<p>that you can actually go your whole life</p>
<p>always having the keyboard with you.</p>
<p>So this-</p>
<p>Well, except for that little tablet</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using for note-taking right now, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s very inefficient note-taking,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m just looking stuff up.</p>
<p>But in most cases,</p>
<p>I would be actually using the keyboard here right now.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t anticipate.</p>
<p>You have to calculate,</p>
<p>how much typing do you anticipate?</p>
<p>If I anticipate quite a bit,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll just, I have a keyboard-</p>
<p>You pull it out.</p>
<p>And same with, I mean, the embarrassing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve accepted being the weirdo that I am,</p>
<p>but when I go on an airplane</p>
<p>and I anticipate to do programming or a lot of typing,</p>
<p>I will have a laptop</p>
<p>that will pull out a Kinesis keyboard</p>
<p>in addition to the laptop,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just who I am.</p>
<p>You have to accept who you are.</p>
<p>But also, for a lot of people,</p>
<p>for me certainly, there&rsquo;s a comfort space</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a certain kind of setups</p>
<p>that are maximized productivity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like some people have a warm blanket</p>
<p>that they like when they watch a movie.</p>
<p>I like the Kinesis keyboard.</p>
<p>It takes me to a place of focus.</p>
<p>And I still mostly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make sure I use the state-of-the-art IDEs</p>
<p>for everything, but my comfort place,</p>
<p>just like the Kinesis keyboard, is still Emacs.</p>
<p>So I still use, I still, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of some of the debates I have with myself</p>
<p>about everything from a technology perspective</p>
<p>is how much to hold on to the tools you&rsquo;re comfortable with</p>
<p>versus how much to invest in using modern tools.</p>
<p>And the signal that the communities provide you with</p>
<p>is the noisy one,</p>
<p>because a lot of people year to year</p>
<p>get excited about new tools.</p>
<p>And you have to make a prediction.</p>
<p>Are these tools defining a new generation</p>
<p>or something that will transform programming?</p>
<p>Or is this just a fad that will pass?</p>
<p>Certainly with JavaScript frameworks</p>
<p>and front-end and back-end of the web,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different styles that came and went.</p>
<p>I remember learning, what was it called, ActionScript.</p>
<p>I remember for Flash, learning how to program in Flash,</p>
<p>learning how to design, do graphic animation,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff in Flash.</p>
<p>Same with Java applets.</p>
<p>I remember creating quite a lot of Java applets,</p>
<p>thinking that this potentially defines</p>
<p>the future of the web, and it did not.</p>
<p>Well, you know, in most cases like that,</p>
<p>the particular technology eventually gets replaced,</p>
<p>but many of the concepts that the technology introduced</p>
<p>or made accessible first are preserved, of course,</p>
<p>because yeah, we&rsquo;re not using Java applets anymore,</p>
<p>but the notion of reactive webpages</p>
<p>that sort of contain little bits of code</p>
<p>that respond directly to something you do</p>
<p>like pressing a button or a link or hovering even,</p>
<p>has certainly not gone away.</p>
<p>And that those animations that were made</p>
<p>painfully complicated with Flash,</p>
<p>I mean, Flash was an innovation when it first came up.</p>
<p>And when it was replaced by JavaScript equivalents stuff,</p>
<p>it was a somewhat better way to do animations,</p>
<p>but those animations are still there.</p>
<p>Not all of them, but sort of, again,</p>
<p>there is an evolution and often, so often with technology,</p>
<p>that the sort of the technology</p>
<p>that was eventually thrown away or replaced</p>
<p>was still essential to sort of get started.</p>
<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be jet planes without propeller planes.</p>
<p>I bet you.</p>
<p>But from a user perspective, yes, from the feature set, yes,</p>
<p>but from a programmer perspective,</p>
<p>it feels like all the time I&rsquo;ve spent with ActionScript,</p>
<p>all the time I&rsquo;ve spent with Java on the applet side</p>
<p>for the GUI development, well, no, Java, I have to push back.</p>
<p>That was useful because it transfers,</p>
<p>but the Flash doesn&rsquo;t transfer.</p>
<p>So some things you learn and invest time in.</p>
<p>Yeah, what you learned,</p>
<p>the skill you picked up learning ActionScript</p>
<p>was sort of, it was perhaps a super valuable skill</p>
<p>at the time you picked it up.</p>
<p>If you learned ActionScript early enough,</p>
<p>but that skill is no longer in demand.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the calculation you have to make</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re learning new things.</p>
<p>Like today, people start learning programming.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m trying to see what are the new languages to try?</p>
<p>What are the new systems to try that?</p>
<p>What are the new ideas to try to keep improving?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we start when we&rsquo;re young, right?</p>
<p>But that seems very true to me,</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>you have your whole life ahead of you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re allowed to make mistakes.</p>
<p>In fact, you should feel encouraged</p>
<p>to do a bit of stupid stuff.</p>
<p>Try not to get yourself killed or seriously maimed,</p>
<p>but try stuff that deviates</p>
<p>from what everybody else is doing.</p>
<p>And like nine out of 10 times,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll just learn why everybody else is not doing that,</p>
<p>or why everybody else is doing it some other way.</p>
<p>And one out of 10 times,</p>
<p>you sort of, you discover something that&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>or that somehow works.</p>
<p>I mean, there are all sorts of crazy things</p>
<p>that were invented by accident,</p>
<p>by people trying stuff together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great advice to try random stuff,</p>
<p>make a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re married with kids,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to be a little more risk averse</p>
<p>because now there&rsquo;s more at stake</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve already hopefully had some time</p>
<p>where you were experimenting with crazy shit.</p>
<p>I like how marriage and kids solidifies</p>
<p>your choice of programming language.</p>
<p>How does that, the Robert Frost poem</p>
<p>with the road less taken,</p>
<p>which I think is misinterpreted by most people.</p>
<p>But anyway, I feel like the choices you make early on,</p>
<p>especially if you go all in,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna define the rest of your life&rsquo;s trajectory</p>
<p>in a way that, like you basically are picking a camp.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s, if you invest a lot in PHP,</p>
<p>if you invest a lot in .NET,</p>
<p>if you invest a lot in JavaScript,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to stick there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your life journey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to tell.</p>
<p>Well, only as far as that technology remains relevant.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, if at age 16, you learn coding in C</p>
<p>and by the time you&rsquo;re 26, C is like a dead language,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s still time to switch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably some kind of survivor bias</p>
<p>or whatever it&rsquo;s called in sort of your observation</p>
<p>that you pick a camp</p>
<p>because there are many different camps to pick.</p>
<p>And if you pick .NET,</p>
<p>then you can coast for the rest of your life</p>
<p>because that technology is now so ubiquitous, of course,</p>
<p>that even if it&rsquo;s bound to die,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take a very long time.</p>
<p>Well, for me personally,</p>
<p>I had a very difficult and in my own head brave leap</p>
<p>that I had to take relevant to our discussion,</p>
<p>which is most of my life I programmed in C and C++.</p>
<p>And so having that hammer, everything looked like a nail.</p>
<p>So I would literally even do scripting in C++.</p>
<p>Like I would create programs that do script like things.</p>
<p>And when I first came to Google and before then,</p>
<p>it became already before TensorFlow, before all of that,</p>
<p>there was a growing realization that C++</p>
<p>is not the right tool for machine learning.</p>
<p>We could talk about why that is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear why that is.</p>
<p>A lot of things has to do with community and culture</p>
<p>and how it emerges and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But for me to decide to take the leap to Python,</p>
<p>like all out, basically switch completely from C++</p>
<p>except for highly performant robotics applications.</p>
<p>There was still a culture of C++ in the space of robotics.</p>
<p>That was a big leap.</p>
<p>Like I had to, you know, like people have like</p>
<p>existential crises or midlife crises or whatever.</p>
<p>You have to realize almost like walking away</p>
<p>from a person you love.</p>
<p>Because I was sure that C++</p>
<p>would have to be a lifelong companion.</p>
<p>For a lot of problems I would want to solve,</p>
<p>C++ would be there.</p>
<p>And it was a question to say,</p>
<p>well, that might not be the case.</p>
<p>Because C++ is still one of the most popular languages</p>
<p>in the world, one of the most used,</p>
<p>one of the most dependent on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also still evolving quite a bit.</p>
<p>I mean, that is not sort of a fossilizing community.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They are doing great innovative work actually.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>But yet that sort of their innovations are hard to follow</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not already a hardcore C++ user.</p>
<p>Well, this was the thing.</p>
<p>It pulls you in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I was a hardcore.</p>
<p>The old metaprogramming, template programming.</p>
<p>Like I would start using the modern C++ as it developed.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Not just the shared pointer and the garbage collection</p>
<p>that makes it easier for you to work with some of the flaws.</p>
<p>But the detail, like the metaprogramming,</p>
<p>the crazy stuff that&rsquo;s coming out there.</p>
<p>But then you have to just empirically look and step back</p>
<p>and say, what language am I more productive in?</p>
<p>Sorry to say, what language do I enjoy my life with more?</p>
<p>And readability and able to think through</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Those questions are harder to ask</p>
<p>when you already have a loved one,</p>
<p>which in my case was C++.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Python, like that meme.</p>
<p>The grass is greener on the other side.</p>
<p>Am I just infatuated with a new fad, new cool thing?</p>
<p>Or is this actually going to make my life better?</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people face that kind of decision.</p>
<p>It was a difficult decision for me when I made it.</p>
<p>At this time, it&rsquo;s an obvious switch</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re into machine learning.</p>
<p>But at that time, it wasn&rsquo;t quite yet so obvious.</p>
<p>So it was a risk.</p>
<p>And you have the same kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I still, because of my connection to WordPress,</p>
<p>I still do a lot of backend programming in PHP.</p>
<p>And the question is, Node.js, Python,</p>
<p>do you switch backend to any of those programmings?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the case for Node.js for me.</p>
<p>Well, more and more and more of the front end,</p>
<p>it runs in JavaScript.</p>
<p>And fascinating cool stuff is done in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Maybe use the same programming language</p>
<p>for the backend as well.</p>
<p>The case for Python for the backend is,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re doing so much programming</p>
<p>outside of the web in Python.</p>
<p>So maybe use Python for the backend.</p>
<p>And then the case for PHP,</p>
<p>well, most of the web still runs in PHP.</p>
<p>You have a lot of experience with PHP.</p>
<p>Why fix something that&rsquo;s not broken?</p>
<p>Those are my own personal struggles,</p>
<p>but I think they reflect the struggles of a lot of people</p>
<p>with different programming languages,</p>
<p>with different problems they&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird one.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not a single answer, right?</p>
<p>Because depending on how much time</p>
<p>you have to learn new stuff,</p>
<p>where you are in your life,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re currently working on,</p>
<p>who you want to work with, what communities you like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not one right choice.</p>
<p>Maybe if you sort of, if you can look back 20 years,</p>
<p>you can say, well, that whole detour through action script</p>
<p>was a waste of time, but nobody could know that.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t beat yourself up over that.</p>
<p>You just need to accept that not every choice you make</p>
<p>is going to be perfect.</p>
<p>Maybe sort of keep a plan B in the back of your mind,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t overthink it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to sort of, don&rsquo;t create a spreadsheet</p>
<p>with like, where you&rsquo;re trying to estimate,</p>
<p>well, if I learn this language,</p>
<p>I expect to make X million dollars in a lifetime.</p>
<p>And if I learn that language,</p>
<p>I expect to make Y million dollars in a lifetime.</p>
<p>And which is higher and which has more risk</p>
<p>and where&rsquo;s the chance that, it&rsquo;s like picking a stock.</p>
<p>Kind of, kind of, but I think with stocks,</p>
<p>you can do, diversifying your investment is good.</p>
<p>With productivity in life,</p>
<p>boy, that spreadsheet is possible to construct.</p>
<p>Like if you actually carefully analyze</p>
<p>what your interests in life are,</p>
<p>where you think you can maximally impact the world,</p>
<p>there really is better and worse choices</p>
<p>for a programming language.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just about the syntax, but about the community,</p>
<p>about where you predict the community&rsquo;s headed,</p>
<p>what large systems are programmed in that.</p>
<p>But can you create that spreadsheet?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s sort of, you&rsquo;re mentioning</p>
<p>a whole bunch of inputs that go into that spreadsheet</p>
<p>where you have to estimate things</p>
<p>that are very hard to measure</p>
<p>and even harder.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re hard to measure retroactively</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re even harder to predict.</p>
<p>Like, what is the better community?</p>
<p>Well, better is one of those incredibly difficult words.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s better for you is not better for someone else.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not doing a public speech about what&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing a personal spiritual journey.</p>
<p>I can determine a circle of friends,</p>
<p>circle one and circle two,</p>
<p>and I can have a bunch of parties with one</p>
<p>and a bunch of parties with two,</p>
<p>and then write down or take a mental note</p>
<p>of what made me happier, right?</p>
<p>And that, you know, you have,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a machine learning person,</p>
<p>you wanna say, okay, I want to build a large company</p>
<p>that does, that is grounded in machine learning,</p>
<p>but also has a sexy interface</p>
<p>that has a large impact on the world.</p>
<p>What languages do I use?</p>
<p>You look at what Facebook is using,</p>
<p>you look at what Twitter is using.</p>
<p>Then you look at performant,</p>
<p>more newer languages like Rust,</p>
<p>or you look at languages that have taken,</p>
<p>that most of the community uses</p>
<p>in the machine learning space, that&rsquo;s Python.</p>
<p>And you can, like, think through,</p>
<p>you can hang out and think through it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always a, and the level of activity</p>
<p>of the community is also really interesting.</p>
<p>Like you said, C++ and Python are super active</p>
<p>in terms of the development of the language itself.</p>
<p>But do you think that you can make objective choices there?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a gut you build up.</p>
<p>Like, don&rsquo;t you believe in that gut feeling about-</p>
<p>Oh, everything is very subjective.</p>
<p>And yes, you most certainly can have a gut feeling</p>
<p>and your gut can also be wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there are billions of people</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not all right.</p>
<p>I mean, clearly there are more people</p>
<p>living in the Bay Area who have plans</p>
<p>to sort of create a Google-sized company</p>
<p>than there&rsquo;s room in the world for Google-sized companies.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna have to duke it out</p>
<p>in the market space.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many more choices</p>
<p>than just the programming language.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, let&rsquo;s go back to the boat</p>
<p>with the fisherman who&rsquo;s tuned out long ago.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk to the programmer.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jump around and go back to CPython</p>
<p>that we tried to define as the reference implementation.</p>
<p>And one of the big things that&rsquo;s coming out in 3.11,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right way to-</p>
<p>We tend to say 3.11 because it really was like</p>
<p>we went 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re planning to go up to 3.99.</p>
<p>99?</p>
<p>What happens after 99?</p>
<p>Probably just 3.100, if I make it there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And go all the way to 420.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Forever Python v3.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about 4, but more for fun.</p>
<p>So, 3.11 is coming out.</p>
<p>One of the big sexy things in it is it&rsquo;ll be much faster.</p>
<p>So how did you, beyond hiring a great team</p>
<p>or working with a great team, make it faster?</p>
<p>What are some ideas that makes it faster?</p>
<p>It has to do with simplicity of software versus performance.</p>
<p>And so even though C is known to be a low-level language,</p>
<p>which is great for writing sort of</p>
<p>a high-performance language interpreter,</p>
<p>when I originally started Python or C Python,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect there would be</p>
<p>great success and fame in my future.</p>
<p>So I tried to get something working and useful</p>
<p>in about three months.</p>
<p>And so I sort of, I cut corners.</p>
<p>I borrowed ideas left and right</p>
<p>when it comes to language design as well as implementation.</p>
<p>I also wrote much of the code as simple as it could be.</p>
<p>And there are many things that you can code</p>
<p>more efficiently by adding more code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a sort of a time-space trade-off</p>
<p>where you can compute a certain thing</p>
<p>from a small number of inputs.</p>
<p>And every time you get presented with a new input,</p>
<p>you do the whole computation from the top.</p>
<p>That can be simple-looking code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to reason about that.</p>
<p>You can tell quickly that it&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>at least in the sort of mathematical sense of correct.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s implemented in C,</p>
<p>maybe it performs relatively well,</p>
<p>but over time as sort of,</p>
<p>as the requirements for that code</p>
<p>and the need for performance go up,</p>
<p>you might be able to rewrite that same algorithm</p>
<p>using more memory, maybe remember previous results</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to recompute everything from scratch.</p>
<p>Like the classic example is computing prime numbers.</p>
<p>Like is 10 a prime number?</p>
<p>Well, you sort of, is it divisible by two?</p>
<p>Is it divisible by three?</p>
<p>Is it divisible by four?</p>
<p>And we go all the way to, is it divisible by nine?</p>
<p>And it is not, well, actually 10 is divisible by two,</p>
<p>so there we stop, but say 11.</p>
<p>Is it divisible by 10?</p>
<p>The answer is no, 10 times in a row.</p>
<p>So now we know 11 is a prime number.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we already know</p>
<p>that two, three, five, and seven are prime numbers,</p>
<p>and you know a little bit about the mathematics</p>
<p>of how prime numbers work,</p>
<p>you know that if you have a rough estimate</p>
<p>for the square root of 11,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t actually have to check,</p>
<p>is it divisible by four or is it divisible by five?</p>
<p>All you have to check in the case of 11</p>
<p>is, is it divisible by two?</p>
<p>Is it divisible by three?</p>
<p>Because take 12, if it&rsquo;s divisible by four,</p>
<p>well, 12 divided by four is three,</p>
<p>so you should have come across the question,</p>
<p>is it divisible by three first?</p>
<p>So if you know basically nothing about prime numbers</p>
<p>except the definition, maybe you go for X from two</p>
<p>through N minus one, is N divisible by X?</p>
<p>And then at the end, if you got all nos</p>
<p>for every single one of those questions,</p>
<p>you know, oh, it must be a prime number.</p>
<p>Well, the first thing is you can stop iterating</p>
<p>when you find a yes answer.</p>
<p>And the second is you can also stop iterating</p>
<p>when you have reached the square root of N</p>
<p>because you know that if it has a divisor</p>
<p>larger than the square root,</p>
<p>it must also have a divisor smaller than the square root.</p>
<p>Then you say, oh, except for two,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need to bother with checking for even numbers</p>
<p>because all even numbers are divisible by two.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s divisible by four,</p>
<p>we would already have come across the question,</p>
<p>is it divisible by two?</p>
<p>And so now you go special case check,</p>
<p>is it divisible by two?</p>
<p>And then you just check three, five, seven, 11.</p>
<p>And so now you&rsquo;ve sort of reduced your search space</p>
<p>by 50% again, by skipping all the even numbers</p>
<p>except for two.</p>
<p>If you think a bit more about it,</p>
<p>or you just read in your book about the history of math,</p>
<p>one of the first algorithms ever written down,</p>
<p>all you have to do is check,</p>
<p>is it divisible by any of the previous prime numbers</p>
<p>that are smaller than the square root?</p>
<p>And before you get to a better algorithm than that,</p>
<p>you have to have several PhDs in discrete math.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s as much as I know.</p>
<p>So of course that same story applies</p>
<p>to a lot of other algorithms.</p>
<p>String matching is a good example</p>
<p>of how to come up with an efficient algorithm.</p>
<p>And sometimes the more efficient algorithm</p>
<p>is not so much more complex than the inefficient one.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an art, and it&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>In the general cases, the more performant the algorithm,</p>
<p>the more complex it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of trade-off.</p>
<p>The simpler algorithms are also the ones</p>
<p>that people invent first.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re looking for a solution,</p>
<p>you look at the simplest way to get there first.</p>
<p>And so if there is a simple solution,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not the best solution,</p>
<p>not the fastest or the most memory efficient or whatever,</p>
<p>a simple solution, and simple is fairly subjective,</p>
<p>but mathematicians have also thought about</p>
<p>sort of what is a good definition for simple</p>
<p>in the case of algorithms.</p>
<p>But the simpler solutions tend to be easier to follow</p>
<p>for other programmers who haven&rsquo;t made a study</p>
<p>of a particular field.</p>
<p>And when I started with Python,</p>
<p>I was a good programmer in general.</p>
<p>I knew sort of basic data structures.</p>
<p>I knew the C language pretty well.</p>
<p>But there were many areas where I was</p>
<p>only somewhat familiar with the state of the art.</p>
<p>And so I picked, in many cases,</p>
<p>the simplest way I could solve a particular sub-problem.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re designing and implementing a language,</p>
<p>you have to like,</p>
<p>you have many hundreds of little problems to solve.</p>
<p>And you have to have solutions for every one of them</p>
<p>before you can sort of say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve invented a programming language.</p>
<p>First of all, so CPython, what kind of things does it do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interpreter.</p>
<p>It takes in this readable language that we talked about</p>
<p>that is Python.</p>
<p>What is it supposed to do?</p>
<p>The interpreter, basically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of a recipe for understanding recipes.</p>
<p>So instead of a recipe that says, bake me a cake,</p>
<p>we have a recipe for, well, given the text of a program,</p>
<p>how do we run that program?</p>
<p>And that is sort of the recipe for building a computer.</p>
<p>The recipe for the baker and the chef.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are the algorithmically tricky things</p>
<p>that happen to be low-hanging fruit</p>
<p>that could be improved on?</p>
<p>Maybe throughout the history of Python, but also now,</p>
<p>how is it possible that 3.11 in year 2022,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to get such a big performance improvement?</p>
<p>We focused on a few areas</p>
<p>where we still felt there was low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p>The biggest one is actually the interpreter itself.</p>
<p>And this has to do with details of how Python is defined.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t know if the fisherman</p>
<p>is going to follow this story.</p>
<p>He already jumped off the boat.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;m bored.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is stupid.</p>
<p>Python is actually,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s always called an interpreted language,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a compiler in there.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t compile to machine code.</p>
<p>It compiles to bytecode,</p>
<p>which is sort of code for an imaginary computer</p>
<p>that is called the Python interpreter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s compiling code that is more easily digestible</p>
<p>by the interpreter, or is digestible at all?</p>
<p>It is the code that is digested by the interpreter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the compiler.</p>
<p>We tweaked very minor bits of the compiler.</p>
<p>Almost all the work was done in the interpreter,</p>
<p>because when you have a program, you compile it once,</p>
<p>and then you run the code a whole bunch of times.</p>
<p>Or maybe there&rsquo;s one function in the code</p>
<p>that gets run many times.</p>
<p>Now, I know that sort of people who know this field</p>
<p>are expecting me to, at some point,</p>
<p>say we built a just-in-time compiler.</p>
<p>Actually, we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We just made the interpreter a little more efficient.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a just-in-time compiler?</p>
<p>That is a thing from the Java world,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s now applied to almost all programming languages,</p>
<p>especially interpreted ones.</p>
<p>So you see the compiler inside Python,</p>
<p>not like a just-in-time compiler,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a compiler that creates bytecode</p>
<p>that is then fed to the interpreter.</p>
<p>And the compiler,</p>
<p>was there something interesting to say about the compiler?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that you haven&rsquo;t changed that,</p>
<p>tweaked that at all, or much.</p>
<p>We changed some parts of the bytecode,</p>
<p>but not very much.</p>
<p>And so we only had to change the parts of the compiler</p>
<p>where we decided that the breakdown</p>
<p>of a Python program in bytecode instructions</p>
<p>had to be slightly different.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t gain us the performance improvements.</p>
<p>The performance improvements</p>
<p>were like making the interpreter faster in part</p>
<p>by sort of removing the fat</p>
<p>from some internal data structures used by the interpreter.</p>
<p>But the key idea is an adaptive specializing interpreter.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>What is adaptive about it?</p>
<p>What is specialized about it?</p>
<p>Well, let me first talk about the specializing part</p>
<p>because the adaptive part is the sort of</p>
<p>the second order effect, but they&rsquo;re both important.</p>
<p>So bytecode is a bunch of machine instructions</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an imaginary machine.</p>
<p>But the machine can do things like call a function,</p>
<p>add two numbers, print a value.</p>
<p>Those are sort of typical instructions in Python.</p>
<p>And if we take the example of adding two numbers,</p>
<p>actually in Python, the language,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no such thing as adding two numbers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, the compiler doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re adding two numbers.</p>
<p>You might as well be adding two strings or two lists</p>
<p>or two instances of some user defined class</p>
<p>that happened to implement this operator called add.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting</p>
<p>and fairly powerful mathematical concept.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly a user interface trick</p>
<p>because it means that a certain category of functions</p>
<p>can be written using a single symbol, the plus sign</p>
<p>and sort of a bunch of other functions can be written</p>
<p>using another single symbol, the multiply sign.</p>
<p>So if we take addition, the way traditionally in Python</p>
<p>the add bytecode was executed is</p>
<p>pointers, pointers, and more pointers.</p>
<p>So first we have two objects.</p>
<p>An object is basically a pointer to a bunch of memory</p>
<p>that contains more pointers.</p>
<p>Pointers all the way down.</p>
<p>Well, not quite, but there are a lot of them.</p>
<p>So to simplify a bit, we look up in one of the objects</p>
<p>what is the type of that object?</p>
<p>And does that object type define an add operation?</p>
<p>And so you can imagine that there is a sort of</p>
<p>a type integer that knows how to add itself</p>
<p>to another integer.</p>
<p>And there is a type floating point number</p>
<p>that knows how to add itself</p>
<p>to another floating point number.</p>
<p>And the integers and floating point numbers</p>
<p>are sort of important, I think, mostly historically</p>
<p>because in the first computers</p>
<p>you used the sort of, the same bit pattern</p>
<p>when interpreted as a floating point number</p>
<p>had a very different value</p>
<p>than when interpreted as an integer.</p>
<p>Can I ask a dumb question here?</p>
<p>Please do.</p>
<p>Given the basics of int and float and add,</p>
<p>who carries the knowledge of how to add two integers?</p>
<p>Is it the integer?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the type integer versus?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the type integer and the type float.</p>
<p>What about the operator?</p>
<p>Does the operator just exist as a platonic form</p>
<p>possessed by the integer?</p>
<p>The operator is more like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an index in a list of functions</p>
<p>that the integer type defines.</p>
<p>And so the integer type</p>
<p>is really a collection of functions</p>
<p>and there is an add function</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a multiply function</p>
<p>and there are like 30 other functions for other operations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a power function, for example.</p>
<p>And you can imagine that in memory</p>
<p>there is a distinct slot for the add operations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the add operation is the first operation of a type</p>
<p>and the multiply is the second operation of a type.</p>
<p>So now we take the integer type</p>
<p>and we take the floating point type.</p>
<p>In both cases, the add operation is the first slot</p>
<p>and multiply is the second slot.</p>
<p>But each slot contains a function</p>
<p>and the functions are different</p>
<p>because the add to integers function</p>
<p>interprets the bit patterns as integers.</p>
<p>The add to float function</p>
<p>interprets the same bit pattern</p>
<p>as a floating point number.</p>
<p>And then there is the string data type,</p>
<p>which again, interprets the bit pattern</p>
<p>as the address of a sequence of characters.</p>
<p>There are lots of lies in that story,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s sort of a basic idea.</p>
<p>I can tell the fake news and the fabrication</p>
<p>going on here at the table,</p>
<p>but where&rsquo;s the optimization?</p>
<p>Is it on the operators?</p>
<p>Is it different inside the integer?</p>
<p>The optimization is the observation</p>
<p>that in a particular line of code,</p>
<p>so now you write your little Python program</p>
<p>and you write a function</p>
<p>and that function sort of takes a bunch of inputs</p>
<p>and at some point it adds two of the inputs together.</p>
<p>Now I bet you even if you call your function a thousand times</p>
<p>that all those calls are likely</p>
<p>all going to be about integers</p>
<p>because maybe your program is all about integers</p>
<p>or maybe on that particular line of code</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s that plus operator,</p>
<p>every time the program hits that line,</p>
<p>the variables A and B that are being added together</p>
<p>happen to be strings.</p>
<p>And so what we do is instead of having</p>
<p>this single byte code that says,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an add operation</p>
<p>and the implementation of add is fully generic.</p>
<p>It looks at the object from the object,</p>
<p>it looks at the type,</p>
<p>then it takes the type</p>
<p>and it looks up the function pointer,</p>
<p>then it calls the function.</p>
<p>Now the function has to look at the other argument</p>
<p>and it has to double check</p>
<p>that the other argument has the right type.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a bunch of error checking</p>
<p>before it can actually just go ahead</p>
<p>and add the two bit patterns in the right way.</p>
<p>What we do is every time we execute</p>
<p>an add instruction like that,</p>
<p>we keep a little note of,</p>
<p>in the end, after we hit the code</p>
<p>that did the addition for a particular type,</p>
<p>what type was it?</p>
<p>And then after a few times through that code,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the same type all the time,</p>
<p>we say, oh, so this add operation,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s the generic add operation,</p>
<p>it might as well be the add integer operation.</p>
<p>And add integer operation is much more efficient</p>
<p>because it just says,</p>
<p>assume that A and B are integers,</p>
<p>do the addition operation,</p>
<p>do it right there in line</p>
<p>and produce the result.</p>
<p>And the big lie here is that in Python,</p>
<p>even if you have great evidence that in the past,</p>
<p>it was always two integers that you were adding,</p>
<p>at some point in the future,</p>
<p>that same line of code could still be hit</p>
<p>with two floating points or two strings,</p>
<p>or maybe a string and an integer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a great lie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the fact of life.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t account for what should happen in that case</p>
<p>in the way I told the story.</p>
<p>There is some accounting for that.</p>
<p>And so what we actually have to do</p>
<p>is when we have the add integer operation,</p>
<p>we still have to check,</p>
<p>are the two arguments in fact integers?</p>
<p>We applied some tricks to make those checks efficient.</p>
<p>And we know statistically</p>
<p>that the outcome is almost always,</p>
<p>yes, they are both integers.</p>
<p>And so we quickly make that check</p>
<p>and then we proceed with the sort of add integer operation.</p>
<p>And then there is a fallback mechanism where we say,</p>
<p>oops, one of them wasn&rsquo;t an integer.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna pretend</p>
<p>that it was just the fully generic add operation.</p>
<p>We wasted a few cycles believing it was going</p>
<p>to be two integers and then we had to back up,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t waste that much time</p>
<p>and statistically most of the time.</p>
<p>Basically, we&rsquo;re sort of hoping</p>
<p>that most of the time we guess right,</p>
<p>because if it turns out that we guessed wrong too often,</p>
<p>or we didn&rsquo;t have a good guess at all,</p>
<p>things might actually end up running a little slower.</p>
<p>So someone armed with this knowledge</p>
<p>and a copy of the implementation,</p>
<p>someone could easily construct a counter example</p>
<p>where they say, oh, I have a program</p>
<p>and then now it runs five times as slow in Python 3.11</p>
<p>than it did in Python 3.10.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a very unrealistic program.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like an extreme fluke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun reverse engineering task though.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>People like fun, yes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some presumably heuristic</p>
<p>of what defines a momentum of saying,</p>
<p>you seem to be working adding two integers,</p>
<p>not two generic types.</p>
<p>So how do you figure out that heuristic?</p>
<p>I think that the heuristic is actually,</p>
<p>we assume that the weather tomorrow</p>
<p>is gonna be the same as the weather today.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need two days of the weather?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That is already so much better than guessing randomly.</p>
<p>So how do you find this idea?</p>
<p>Hey, I wonder if instead of adding two generic types,</p>
<p>we start assuming that the weather tomorrow</p>
<p>is the same as the weather today.</p>
<p>Where do you find the idea for that?</p>
<p>Because that ultimately, for you to do that,</p>
<p>you have to kind of understand</p>
<p>how people are using the language, right?</p>
<p>Python is not the first language to do a thing like this.</p>
<p>This is a fairly well-known trick,</p>
<p>especially from other interpreted languages</p>
<p>that had reason to be sped up.</p>
<p>We occasionally look at papers about HHVM,</p>
<p>which is Facebook&rsquo;s efficient compiler for PHP.</p>
<p>There are tricks known from the JVM,</p>
<p>and sometimes it just comes from academia.</p>
<p>So the trick here is that the type itself doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the variable doesn&rsquo;t know what type it is.</p>
<p>So this is not a statically typed language</p>
<p>where you can afford to have a shortcut to saying it&rsquo;s ints.</p>
<p>This is a trick that is especially important</p>
<p>for interpreted languages with dynamic typing,</p>
<p>because if the compiler could read in the source,</p>
<p>these X and Y that we&rsquo;re adding are integers,</p>
<p>the compiler can just insert a single add machine code</p>
<p>that hardware machine instruction</p>
<p>that exists on every CPU and ditto for floats.</p>
<p>But because in Python,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t generally declare the types of your variables,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even declare the existence of your variables.</p>
<p>They just spring into existence when you first assign them,</p>
<p>which is really cool and sort of helps those beginners</p>
<p>because there is less bookkeeping</p>
<p>they have to learn how to do</p>
<p>before they can start playing around with code.</p>
<p>But it makes the interpretation of the code less efficient.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re sort of trying to make the interpretation</p>
<p>more efficient without losing</p>
<p>the super dynamic nature of the language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the challenge.</p>
<p>3.5 got the PEP484 type hints.</p>
<p>What is type hinting and is it used by the interpreter,</p>
<p>the hints, or is it just syntactic sugar?</p>
<p>So the type hints is an optional mechanism</p>
<p>that people can use.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s especially popular with sort of larger companies</p>
<p>that have very large code bases written in Python.</p>
<p>Do you think of it as almost like documentation</p>
<p>saying these two variables are this type?</p>
<p>More than documentation.</p>
<p>I mean, so it is a sub language of Python</p>
<p>where you can express the types of variables.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a variable and it&rsquo;s an integer.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s an argument to this function and it&rsquo;s a string.</p>
<p>And here is a function that returns a list of strings.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not checked when you run the code.</p>
<p>But exactly, there is a separate piece of software</p>
<p>called a static type checker</p>
<p>that reads all your source code without executing it</p>
<p>and thinks long and hard about what it looks like</p>
<p>from just reading the code that code might be doing</p>
<p>and double checks if that makes sense</p>
<p>if you take the types as annotated into account.</p>
<p>So this is something you&rsquo;re supposed to run as you develop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a linter, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely a development tool,</p>
<p>but the type annotations currently are not used</p>
<p>for speeding up the interpreter.</p>
<p>And there are a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t use them.</p>
<p>Even when they do use them, they sometimes contain lies</p>
<p>where the static type checker says, everything&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I cannot prove that this integer is ever not an integer,</p>
<p>but at runtime, somehow someone manages</p>
<p>to violate that assumption.</p>
<p>And the interpreter ends up doing just fine.</p>
<p>If we started enforcing type annotations in Python,</p>
<p>many Python programs would no longer work.</p>
<p>And some Python programs wouldn&rsquo;t even be possible</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re too dynamic.</p>
<p>And so we made a choice of not using the annotations.</p>
<p>There is a possible future where eventually</p>
<p>three, four, five releases in the future,</p>
<p>we could start using those annotations</p>
<p>to sort of provide hints,</p>
<p>because we can still say,</p>
<p>well, the source code leads us to believe</p>
<p>that these X and Y are both integers.</p>
<p>And so we can generate an add integer instruction,</p>
<p>but we can still have a fallback that says,</p>
<p>oh, if somehow the code at runtime provided something else,</p>
<p>maybe it provided two decimal numbers,</p>
<p>we can still use that generic add operation as a fallback,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>Is there currently a mechanism</p>
<p>or do you see something like that</p>
<p>where you can almost add like an assert</p>
<p>inside a function that says,</p>
<p>please check that my type hints</p>
<p>are actually mapping to reality.</p>
<p>Sort of like insert manual static typing.</p>
<p>There are third-party libraries that are in that business.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible to do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible for a third-party library</p>
<p>to take a hint and enforce it.</p>
<p>Seems like a tricky thing.</p>
<p>Well, what we actually do is,</p>
<p>and I think this is a fairly unique feature in Python.</p>
<p>The type hints can be introspected at runtime.</p>
<p>So while the program is running,</p>
<p>they mean Python is a very introspectable language.</p>
<p>You can look at a variable and ask yourself,</p>
<p>what is the type of this variable?</p>
<p>And if that variable happens to refer to a function,</p>
<p>you can ask, what are the arguments to the function?</p>
<p>And nowadays you can also ask,</p>
<p>what are the type annotations for the function?</p>
<p>So the type annotations are there inside the variable</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s at runtime.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mostly associated with the function object,</p>
<p>not with each individual variable,</p>
<p>but you can sort of map from the arguments to the variables.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a third-party library can help with.</p>
<p>Exactly, and the problem with that</p>
<p>is that all that extra runtime type checking</p>
<p>is going to slow your code down instead of speed it up.</p>
<p>I think to reference this sales pitchy blog post</p>
<p>that says 75% of developers&rsquo; time is spent on debugging,</p>
<p>I would say that in some cases that might be okay.</p>
<p>It might be okay to pay the cost of performance</p>
<p>for the catching of the types, the type errors.</p>
<p>And in most cases, doing it statically</p>
<p>before you ship your code to production</p>
<p>is more efficient than doing it at runtime piecemeal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you tell me about mypy project?</p>
<p>What is it, what&rsquo;s the mission,</p>
<p>and in general, what is the future</p>
<p>of static typing in Python?</p>
<p>Well, so mypy was started by a Finnish developer,</p>
<p>Jukka Latusalo.</p>
<p>So many cool things out of Finland, I gotta say.</p>
<p>Just that part of the world.</p>
<p>I guess people have nothing better to do</p>
<p>in those long, cold winters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think Jukka lived in England</p>
<p>when he invented that stuff, actually.</p>
<p>But mypy is the original static type checker for Python.</p>
<p>And the type annotations that were introduced</p>
<p>with PEP484 were sort of developed together</p>
<p>with the static type checker.</p>
<p>And in fact, Jukka had first invented a different syntax</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t quite compatible with Python.</p>
<p>And Jukka and I sort of met at a Python conference</p>
<p>in, I think, in 2013.</p>
<p>And we sort of came up with a compromise syntax</p>
<p>that would not require any changes to Python,</p>
<p>and that would let mypy sort of be an add</p>
<p>on static type checker for Python.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity,</p>
<p>was it like double colon or something?</p>
<p>What was he proposing that would break Python?</p>
<p>I think he was using angular brackets for types</p>
<p>like in C++ or Java generics.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t use angular brackets in Python.</p>
<p>It would be too tricky for template type stuff.</p>
<p>Well, the key thing is that we already had</p>
<p>syntax for annotations.</p>
<p>We just didn&rsquo;t know what to use them for yet.</p>
<p>So type annotations were just the sort of most logical thing</p>
<p>to use that existing dummy syntax for.</p>
<p>So there was no syntax for defining generics</p>
<p>directly syntactically in the language.</p>
<p>mypy literally meant my version of Python,</p>
<p>where my refers to Jukka.</p>
<p>He had a parser that translated mypy</p>
<p>into Python by like doing the type checks</p>
<p>and then removing the annotations</p>
<p>and all the angular brackets from the positions</p>
<p>where he was using them.</p>
<p>But a preprocessor model doesn&rsquo;t work very well</p>
<p>with the typical workflow of Python development projects.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I mean, that could have been another major split</p>
<p>if it became successful.</p>
<p>Like if you watch TypeScript versus JavaScript</p>
<p>is like a split in the community over types, right?</p>
<p>That seems to be stabilizing now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily a split.</p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t use TypeScript,</p>
<p>but just use the original JavaScript notation,</p>
<p>just like there are many people in the Python world</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t use type annotations</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t use static type checkers.</p>
<p>No, I know, but there is a bit of a split</p>
<p>between TypeScript and old school JavaScript,</p>
<p>ES, whatever.</p>
<p>Well, in the JavaScript world,</p>
<p>transpilers are sort of the standard way of working anyway,</p>
<p>which is why TypeScript being a transpiler itself</p>
<p>is not a big deal.</p>
<p>And transpilers, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exactly the thing you said with mypy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the code, I guess you call it preprocessing,</p>
<p>code that translates from one language to the other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the culture,</p>
<p>part of the workflow of the JavaScript community.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>an interesting development</p>
<p>in the JavaScript slash TypeScript world at the moment</p>
<p>is that there is a proposal under consideration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a stage one proposal</p>
<p>that proposes to add a feature to JavaScript</p>
<p>where just like Python,</p>
<p>it will ignore certain syntax</p>
<p>when running the JavaScript code.</p>
<p>And what it ignores is more or less a superset</p>
<p>of the TypeScript annotation syntax.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So that would mean that eventually, if you wanted to,</p>
<p>you could take TypeScript</p>
<p>and you could shove it directly</p>
<p>into a JavaScript interpreter without transpilation.</p>
<p>The interesting thing in the JavaScript world,</p>
<p>at least the web browser world,</p>
<p>the web browsers have changed how they deploy</p>
<p>and they sort of update their JavaScript engines</p>
<p>much more quickly than they used to in the early days.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s much less of a need</p>
<p>for transpilation in JavaScript itself</p>
<p>because most browsers just support</p>
<p>the most recent version of ECMAScript.</p>
<p>Just on a tangent of a tangent,</p>
<p>do you see, if you were to recommend somebody use a thing,</p>
<p>would you recommend TypeScript or JavaScript?</p>
<p>I would recommend TypeScript.</p>
<p>Just because of the strictness of the typing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enormously helpful extra tool</p>
<p>that helps you sort of keep your head straight</p>
<p>about what your code is actually doing.</p>
<p>I mean, it helps with editing your code.</p>
<p>It helps with ensuring that your code is not too incorrect.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually quite compatible with JavaScript,</p>
<p>nevermind this syntactic sort of hack</p>
<p>that is still years in the future.</p>
<p>But any library that is written in pure JavaScript</p>
<p>can still be used from TypeScript programs.</p>
<p>And also the other way around,</p>
<p>you can write a library in TypeScript</p>
<p>and then export it in a form</p>
<p>that is totally consumable by JavaScript.</p>
<p>That sort of compatibility is sort of the key</p>
<p>to the success of TypeScript.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to look at it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a biological system that&rsquo;s evolving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to see JavaScript evolve the way it does.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we should consider</p>
<p>that biological systems</p>
<p>are just engineering systems too, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Just very advanced with more history.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s almost like the most visceral</p>
<p>in the JavaScript world</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just so much code written in JavaScript</p>
<p>that for its history was messy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about bugs per line of code,</p>
<p>I just feel like JavaScript eats the cake</p>
<p>or whatever the terminology is.</p>
<p>It beats Python by a lot in terms of the number of bugs,</p>
<p>meaning like way more bugs in JavaScript.</p>
<p>And then obviously the browsers are developed.</p>
<p>I mean, just there&rsquo;s so much active development.</p>
<p>It feels a lot more like evolution</p>
<p>where a bunch of stuff is born and dies</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s experimentation and debates</p>
<p>versus Python is more, all that stuff is happening,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just a longer history</p>
<p>of stable working giant software systems</p>
<p>written in Python versus JavaScript</p>
<p>is just a giant, beautiful, I would say, mess of code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very different culture.</p>
<p>And to some extent, differences in culture are random,</p>
<p>but to some extent,</p>
<p>the differences have to do with the environment.</p>
<p>And the fact that JavaScript is primarily</p>
<p>the language for developing web applications,</p>
<p>especially the client side,</p>
<p>and the fact that it&rsquo;s basically the only language</p>
<p>for developing web applications</p>
<p>makes that community sort of just have a different nature</p>
<p>than the community of other languages.</p>
<p>Plus the graphical component</p>
<p>and the fact that they&rsquo;re deploying it</p>
<p>on all kinds of shapes of screens and devices</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>it just creates a beautiful chaos.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to MyPy.</p>
<p>So what, okay, you met,</p>
<p>you talked about a syntax that could work.</p>
<p>Where does it currently stand?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the future of static typing in Python?</p>
<p>It is still controversial,</p>
<p>but it is much more accepted</p>
<p>than when MyPy and PEP484 were young.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the connection between PEP484 type hints and MyPy?</p>
<p>MyPy was the original static type checker.</p>
<p>So MyPy quickly evolved from Yuka&rsquo;s own variant of Python</p>
<p>to a static type checker for Python</p>
<p>and sort of PEP484, that was at like</p>
<p>a very productive year where like many hundreds of messages</p>
<p>were exchanged debating the merits</p>
<p>of every aspect of that PEP.</p>
<p>And so MyPy is a static type checker for Python.</p>
<p>It is itself written in Python.</p>
<p>Most additional static typing features</p>
<p>that we introduced in the time since 3.6</p>
<p>were also prototyped through MyPy.</p>
<p>MyPy being an open source project</p>
<p>with a very small number of maintainers.</p>
<p>It was successful enough that people said</p>
<p>this static type checking stuff for Python</p>
<p>is actually worth an investment for our company.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>But somehow they chose not to support</p>
<p>making MyPy faster, say, or adding new features to MyPy,</p>
<p>but both Google and Facebook and later Microsoft</p>
<p>developed their own static type checker.</p>
<p>I think Facebook was one of the first.</p>
<p>They decided that they wanted to use the same technology</p>
<p>that they had successfully used for HHVM</p>
<p>because they sort of, they had a bunch of compiler writers</p>
<p>and sort of static type checking experts</p>
<p>who had written the HHVM compiler</p>
<p>and it was a big success within the company.</p>
<p>And they had done it in a certain way, sort of.</p>
<p>They wrote a big, highly parallel application</p>
<p>in an obscure language named OCaml,</p>
<p>which is apparently mostly very good</p>
<p>for writing static type checkers.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions about</p>
<p>how to write a static type checker then.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very confusing.</p>
<p>Facebook wrote their version</p>
<p>and they worked on it in secret for about a year</p>
<p>and then they came clean and went open source.</p>
<p>Google, in the meantime,</p>
<p>was developing something called PyType,</p>
<p>which was mostly interesting because it,</p>
<p>as you may have heard, they have one gigantic monorepo.</p>
<p>So all the code is checked into a single repository.</p>
<p>Facebook has a different approach.</p>
<p>So Facebook developed Pyre, which was written in OCaml,</p>
<p>which worked well with Facebook&rsquo;s development workflow.</p>
<p>Google developed something they called PyType,</p>
<p>which was actually itself written in Python.</p>
<p>And it was meant to sort of fit well</p>
<p>in their static type checking needs</p>
<p>in Google&rsquo;s gigantic monorepo.</p>
<p>So Google wasn&rsquo;t one giant, got it.</p>
<p>So just to clarify,</p>
<p>this static type checker, philosophically,</p>
<p>is a thing that&rsquo;s supposed to exist</p>
<p>outside of the language itself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a workflow, like a debugger for the programmers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a linter.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, a linter,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a thing that runs through the code continuously,</p>
<p>pre-processing to find issues based on style,</p>
<p>documentation.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all kinds of linters, right?</p>
<p>It can check that.</p>
<p>What usual things does a linter do?</p>
<p>Maybe check that you haven&rsquo;t too many characters</p>
<p>in a single line?</p>
<p>Linters often do static analysis</p>
<p>where they try to point out things that are likely mistakes,</p>
<p>but not incorrect according to the language specification.</p>
<p>Like maybe you have a variable that you never use.</p>
<p>For the compiler, that is valid.</p>
<p>You might be planning to use it</p>
<p>in a future version of the code,</p>
<p>and the compiler might just optimize it out.</p>
<p>But the compiler&rsquo;s not gonna tell you,</p>
<p>hey, you&rsquo;re never using this variable.</p>
<p>A linter will tell you that variable is not used.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a typo somewhere else</p>
<p>where you meant to use it,</p>
<p>but you accidentally used something else,</p>
<p>or there are a number of sort of common scenarios.</p>
<p>And a linter is often a big collection of little heuristics</p>
<p>where by looking at the combination</p>
<p>of how your code is laid out,</p>
<p>maybe how it&rsquo;s indented,</p>
<p>maybe the comment structure,</p>
<p>but also just things like definition of names,</p>
<p>use of names,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll tell you likely things that are wrong.</p>
<p>And in some cases, linters are really style checkers.</p>
<p>For Python, there are a number of linters</p>
<p>that check things like,</p>
<p>do you use the PEP-8 recommended naming scheme</p>
<p>for your functions and classes and variables?</p>
<p>Because like classes start with an uppercase</p>
<p>and the rest starts with a lowercase,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like differences there.</p>
<p>And so the linter can tell you,</p>
<p>hey, you have a class whose first letter</p>
<p>is not an uppercase letter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just, I just find it annoying.</p>
<p>If I wanted that to be an uppercase letter,</p>
<p>I would have typed an uppercase letter,</p>
<p>but other people find it very comforting</p>
<p>that if the linter is no longer complaining</p>
<p>about their code,</p>
<p>that they have followed all the style rules.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a fast way for a new developer</p>
<p>joining a team to learn the style rules, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s definitely that.</p>
<p>But the best use of a linter is probably</p>
<p>not so much to sort of enforce team uniformity,</p>
<p>but to actually help developers catch bugs</p>
<p>that the compilers for whatever reason don&rsquo;t catch.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of that in Python.</p>
<p>And so, but a static type checker</p>
<p>focuses on a particular aspect of the linting,</p>
<p>which, I mean, MyPy doesn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>how you name your classes and variables,</p>
<p>but it is meticulous about when you say</p>
<p>that there was an integer here</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re passing a string there,</p>
<p>it will tell you, hey, that string&rsquo;s not an integer.</p>
<p>So something&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Either you were incorrect when you said it was an integer</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re incorrect when you&rsquo;re passing it a string.</p>
<p>If this is a race of static type checkers,</p>
<p>is somebody winning?</p>
<p>As you said, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that the companies didn&rsquo;t choose to invest</p>
<p>in this centralized development of MyPy.</p>
<p>Is there a future for MyPy?</p>
<p>What do you see as the,</p>
<p>will one of the companies win out</p>
<p>and everybody uses like PyType,</p>
<p>whatever Google&rsquo;s is called?</p>
<p>Well, Microsoft is hoping that Microsoft&rsquo;s horse</p>
<p>in that race called PyRite is going to win.</p>
<p>PyRite, right, like R-I-G-H-T?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah, all my word processors tend to typo correct</p>
<p>that as PyRite, the name of the, I don&rsquo;t know what it is,</p>
<p>some kind of semi-precious metal.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Okay, so, okay, that&rsquo;s the Microsoft hope,</p>
<p>but, okay, so let me ask the question a different way.</p>
<p>Is there going to be ever a future</p>
<p>where the static type checker gets integrated</p>
<p>into the language?</p>
<p>Nobody is currently excited about doing any work</p>
<p>towards that.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that five or 10 years from now,</p>
<p>the situation isn&rsquo;t different.</p>
<p>At the moment, all the static type checkers</p>
<p>still evolve at a much higher speed than Python</p>
<p>and its annotation syntax evolve.</p>
<p>You get a new release of Python once a year.</p>
<p>Those are the only times</p>
<p>that you can introduce new annotation syntax.</p>
<p>And there are always people who invent new annotation syntax</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to push.</p>
<p>And worse, once we&rsquo;ve all agreed</p>
<p>that we are going to put some new syntax in,</p>
<p>we can never take it back.</p>
<p>At least the sort of deprecating an existing feature</p>
<p>takes many releases,</p>
<p>because you have to assume that people started using it</p>
<p>as soon as we announced it.</p>
<p>And then you can&rsquo;t take it away from them right away.</p>
<p>You have to start telling them, well, this will go away,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not gonna tell you that it&rsquo;s an error yet.</p>
<p>And then later it&rsquo;s gonna be a warning.</p>
<p>And then eventually three releases in the future,</p>
<p>maybe we remove it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the typical static type checker</p>
<p>still has a release like every month, every two months,</p>
<p>certainly many times a year.</p>
<p>Some type checkers also include a bunch of experimental ideas</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t official standard Python syntax yet.</p>
<p>The static type checkers also just get better</p>
<p>at discovering things</p>
<p>that sort of are unspecified by the language,</p>
<p>but that sort of could make sense.</p>
<p>And so each static type checker</p>
<p>actually has its sort of strong and weak points.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s cool, it&rsquo;s like a laboratory of experiments.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Microsoft, Google and all, and you get to see.</p>
<p>And you see that everywhere, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s not one single JavaScript engine either.</p>
<p>There is one in Chrome, there is one in Safari,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one in Firefox.</p>
<p>But that said, you said there&rsquo;s not interest.</p>
<p>I think there is a lot of interest in type hinting, right?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>In the PEP 484.</p>
<p>Actually, like how many people use that?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense how many people use,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s optional, it&rsquo;s a sugar.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t put a number on it,</p>
<p>but from the number of packages</p>
<p>that do interesting things with it at runtime</p>
<p>and the fact that there are like now three or four</p>
<p>very mature type checkers</p>
<p>that each have their segment of the market.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s PyCharm,</p>
<p>which has a sort of more heuristic based type checker</p>
<p>that also supports the same syntax.</p>
<p>My assumption is that many, many people</p>
<p>developing Python software professionally</p>
<p>for some kind of production situation</p>
<p>are using a static type checker.</p>
<p>Especially anybody who has a continuous integration cycle</p>
<p>probably has one of the steps in there,</p>
<p>their testing routine that happens for basically</p>
<p>every commit is run a static type checker.</p>
<p>And in most cases, that will be MyPy.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s pretty popular topic.</p>
<p>According to this webpage,</p>
<p>20 to 30% of Python three code bases are using type hints.</p>
<p>Wow, I wonder how they measured that.</p>
<p>Did they just scan all of GitHub?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what it looks like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They did a quick, not all of,</p>
<p>but like a random sampling.</p>
<p>So you mentioned PyCharm.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the big subjective question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best IDE for Python?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re extremely biased now</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Is it PyCharm, VS Code, Vim or Emacs?</p>
<p>Historically, I actually started out with using Vim</p>
<p>but when it was still called VI.</p>
<p>For a very long time, I think from the early 80s to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say two years ago, I was Emacs user.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Between, I&rsquo;d say 2013 and 2018,</p>
<p>I dabbled with PyCharm,</p>
<p>mostly because it had a couple of features.</p>
<p>I mean, PyCharm is like driving an 18-wheeler truck</p>
<p>whereas Emacs is more like driving</p>
<p>your comfortable Toyota car.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;ve had for 100,000 miles</p>
<p>and you know what every little rattle of the car means.</p>
<p>I was very comfortable in Emacs</p>
<p>but there were certain things it couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t very good at that sort of,</p>
<p>at least the way I had configured it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have very good tooling in Emacs</p>
<p>for finding a definition of a function.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>When I was at Dropbox,</p>
<p>exploring a 5 million line Python code base,</p>
<p>just grabbing all that code</p>
<p>for where is there a class foobar?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that if you grab</p>
<p>all 5 million lines of code,</p>
<p>there are many classes with the same name.</p>
<p>And so PyCharm sort of once you fired it up</p>
<p>and once it&rsquo;s indexed,</p>
<p>your repository was very helpful.</p>
<p>But as soon as I had to edit code,</p>
<p>I would jump back to Emacs and do all my editing there</p>
<p>because I could type much faster and switch between files</p>
<p>when I knew which file I wanted much quicker.</p>
<p>And I never really got used</p>
<p>to the whole PyCharm user interface.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel torn in that same kind of way</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve used PyCharm off and on</p>
<p>exactly in that same way.</p>
<p>And I feel like I&rsquo;m just being an old grumpy man</p>
<p>for not learning how to quickly switch between files</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I feel like that has to do with shortcuts,</p>
<p>that has to do with,</p>
<p>I mean, you just have to get accustomed,</p>
<p>just like with touch typing.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to just want to learn that.</p>
<p>I mean, if you don&rsquo;t need it much,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need touch typing either.</p>
<p>You can type with two fingers just fine in the short term,</p>
<p>but in the long term,</p>
<p>your life will become better psychologically</p>
<p>and productivity-wise</p>
<p>if you learn how to type with 10 fingers.</p>
<p>If you do a lot of keyboard input.</p>
<p>But for everyone, emails and stuff, right?</p>
<p>Like you look at the next 20, 30 years of your life,</p>
<p>you have to anticipate where technology is going.</p>
<p>Do you want to invest in handwriting notes?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>More and more people are doing typing</p>
<p>versus handwriting notes.</p>
<p>So you can anticipate that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no reason to actually practice handwriting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more reason to practice typing.</p>
<p>You can actually estimate, back to the spreadsheet,</p>
<p>the number of paragraphs, sentences,</p>
<p>or words you&rsquo;ll write for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>You can probably estimate-</p>
<p>You go again with the spreadsheet of my life, huh?</p>
<p>The spreadsheet, yes.</p>
<p>All of that is not actual, like converted to a spreadsheet,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a gut feeling.</p>
<p>Like I have the same kind of gut feeling about books.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve almost exclusively switched to Kindle now,</p>
<p>so ebook readers.</p>
<p>Even though I still love, and probably always will,</p>
<p>the smell, the feel of a physical book.</p>
<p>And the reason I switched to Kindle is like,</p>
<p>all right, well, this is really paving.</p>
<p>The future is going to be digital</p>
<p>in terms of consuming books and content of that nature.</p>
<p>So you should let your brain</p>
<p>get accustomed to that experience.</p>
<p>In that same way, it feels like PyCharm or VS Code.</p>
<p>I think PyCharm is the most sort of sophisticated,</p>
<p>featureful Python ID.</p>
<p>It feels like I should probably at some point very soon</p>
<p>switch entire-</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not allowed to use anything else for Python</p>
<p>than this ID or VS Code.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, but walk away from Emacs</p>
<p>for this particular application.</p>
<p>So I think I&rsquo;m limiting myself in the same way</p>
<p>that using two fingers for typing is limiting myself.</p>
<p>This is a therapy session.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even asking questions.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people are thinking this way, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to stop you.</p>
<p>I think that sort of everybody has to decide for themselves</p>
<p>which one they want to invest more time in.</p>
<p>I actually ended up giving VS Code a very tentative try</p>
<p>when I started out at Microsoft and really liking it.</p>
<p>And it sort of, it took me a while</p>
<p>before I realized why that was.</p>
<p>But, and I think that actually the founders of VS Code</p>
<p>may not necessarily agree with me on this.</p>
<p>But to me, VS Code is in a sense</p>
<p>the spiritual successor of Emacs.</p>
<p>Because as you probably know, as an old Emacs hack,</p>
<p>the key part of Emacs is that it&rsquo;s mostly written in Lisp.</p>
<p>And that sort of new features of Emacs</p>
<p>usually update all the Lisp packages</p>
<p>and add new Lisp packages.</p>
<p>And oh yeah, there&rsquo;s also some very obscure thing</p>
<p>improved in the part that&rsquo;s not in Lisp.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s usually not why you would upgrade</p>
<p>to a new version of Emacs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a core implementation that sort of can read a file</p>
<p>and it can put bits on the screen</p>
<p>and it can sort of manage memory and buffers.</p>
<p>And then what makes it an editor full of features</p>
<p>is all the Lisp packages.</p>
<p>And of course the design of how the Lisp packages</p>
<p>interact with each other and with that sort of</p>
<p>base layer of the core immutable engine.</p>
<p>But almost everything in that core engine in Emacs case</p>
<p>can still be overridden or replaced.</p>
<p>And so VS Code has a similar architecture</p>
<p>where there is like a base engine</p>
<p>that you have no control over.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s open source,</p>
<p>but nobody except the people who work on that part</p>
<p>changes it much.</p>
<p>And it has a sort of a package manager</p>
<p>and a whole series of interfaces for packages</p>
<p>and an additional series of conventions</p>
<p>for how packages should interact with the lower layers</p>
<p>and with each other and powerful primitive operations</p>
<p>that let you move the cursor around</p>
<p>or select pieces of text or delete pieces of text</p>
<p>or interact with the keyboard and the mouse</p>
<p>and whatever peripherals you have.</p>
<p>And so the sort of the extreme extensibility</p>
<p>and the package ecosystem that you see in VS Code</p>
<p>is a mirror of very similar architectural features in Emacs.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll have to give it a serious try</p>
<p>because as far as sort of the hype and the excitement</p>
<p>in the general programming community,</p>
<p>VS Code seems to dominate.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about PyCharm</p>
<p>and what is it, PHP Storm,</p>
<p>which are these JetBrains specific IDs</p>
<p>that are designed for one programming language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to, when an ID is specialized, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually actually just specializations of IntelliJ</p>
<p>because underneath it&rsquo;s all the same editing engine</p>
<p>with different veneer on top,</p>
<p>where in VS Code,</p>
<p>many things you do require loading third-party extensions.</p>
<p>In PyCharm, it is possible to have third-party extensions</p>
<p>but it is a struggle to create one.</p>
<p>Yes, and it&rsquo;s not part of the culture,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember that it might&rsquo;ve been five years ago</p>
<p>or so we were trying to get</p>
<p>some better MyPy integration into PyCharm</p>
<p>because MyPy is sort of Python tooling</p>
<p>and PyCharm had its own type checking heuristic thing</p>
<p>that we wanted to replace with something based on MyPy</p>
<p>because that was what we were using in the company.</p>
<p>And for the guy who was writing that PyCharm extension,</p>
<p>it was really a struggle to sort of find documentation</p>
<p>and get the development workflow going</p>
<p>and debug his code and all that.</p>
<p>So it was not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Let me talk to you about parallelism.</p>
<p>In your post titled,</p>
<p>Reasoning About AsyncIO Semaphore,</p>
<p>you talk about a fast food restaurant in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>that has only one table.</p>
<p>Is this a real thing?</p>
<p>I just wanted to ask you about that.</p>
<p>Is that just like a metaphor you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>or is that an actual restaurant in Silicon Valley?</p>
<p>It was a metaphor, of course.</p>
<p>I can imagine such a restaurant.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t then read the thing</p>
<p>you should, but it was a idea of a restaurant</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s only one table</p>
<p>and you show up one at a time and you&rsquo;re prepared.</p>
<p>And I actually looked it up</p>
<p>and there is restaurants like this throughout the world.</p>
<p>And it just seems like a fascinating idea.</p>
<p>You stand in line, you show up, there&rsquo;s one table.</p>
<p>They ask you all kinds of questions.</p>
<p>They cook just for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It sounds like you&rsquo;d find places like that in Tokyo.</p>
<p>It sounds like a very Japanese thing.</p>
<p>Or in the Bay Area, there are popular places</p>
<p>that probably more or less work like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never eaten at such a place.</p>
<p>The fascinating thing is you propose it&rsquo;s a fast food.</p>
<p>This is all for a burger.</p>
<p>It was one of my rare sort of more literary</p>
<p>or poetic moments where I thought</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just open with a crazy example to catch your attention.</p>
<p>And the rest is very dry stuff about locks and semaphores</p>
<p>and how a semaphore is a generalization of a lock.</p>
<p>Well, it was very poetic and well-delivered</p>
<p>and it actually made me wonder if it&rsquo;s real or not</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t make that explicit.</p>
<p>And it feels like it could be true.</p>
<p>And in fact, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised</p>
<p>if somebody listens to this</p>
<p>and knows exactly a restaurant like this in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Anyway, can we step back</p>
<p>and can you just talk about parallelism,</p>
<p>concurrency, threading?</p>
<p>Asynchronous, all of these different terms.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Sort of a high philosophical level.</p>
<p>The fisherman is back in the boat.</p>
<p>Well, the idea is if the fisherman has two fishing rods,</p>
<p>since fishing is mostly a matter of waiting</p>
<p>for a fish to nibble.</p>
<p>Well, it depends on how you do it actually.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re doing the style of fishing</p>
<p>where you sort of you throw it out</p>
<p>and then you let it sit for a while</p>
<p>until maybe you see a nibble,</p>
<p>one fisherman can easily run two or three</p>
<p>or four fishing rods.</p>
<p>And so as long as you can afford the equipment,</p>
<p>you can catch four times as many fish</p>
<p>by a small investment in four fishing rods.</p>
<p>And so since your time,</p>
<p>you sort of say you have all Saturday to go fishing,</p>
<p>if you can catch four times as much fish,</p>
<p>you have a much higher productivity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually I think how deep sea fishing is done.</p>
<p>You could just have a rod and you put in a hole</p>
<p>so you can have many rods.</p>
<p>What, is there an interesting difference</p>
<p>between parallelism and concurrency and asynchronous?</p>
<p>Is there one a subset of the other to you?</p>
<p>Like how do you think about these terms?</p>
<p>In the computer world, there is a big difference.</p>
<p>When people are talking about parallelism,</p>
<p>like a parallel computer,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually really several complete CPUs</p>
<p>that are sort of tied together</p>
<p>and share something like memory or an IO bus.</p>
<p>Concurrency can be a much more abstract concept</p>
<p>where you have the illusion</p>
<p>that things happen simultaneously,</p>
<p>but what the computer actually does</p>
<p>is it spends a little time running this program for a while</p>
<p>and then it spends some time running that program</p>
<p>for a while and then spending some time</p>
<p>for the third program for a while.</p>
<p>So parallelism is the reality</p>
<p>and concurrency is part reality, part illusion.</p>
<p>Yeah, parallelism typically implies</p>
<p>that there is multiple copies of the hardware.</p>
<p>You write that implementing synchronization</p>
<p>of primitives is hard in that blog post</p>
<p>and you talk about locks and semaphores.</p>
<p>Why is it hard to implement synchronization primitives?</p>
<p>Because at the conscious level,</p>
<p>our brains are not trained to sort of keep track</p>
<p>of multiple things at the same time.</p>
<p>Like obviously you can walk and chew gum at the same time</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re both activities</p>
<p>that require only a little bit of your conscious activity,</p>
<p>but try balancing your checkbook</p>
<p>and watching a murder mystery on TV.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll mix up the digits</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ll miss an essential clue in the TV show.</p>
<p>So why does it matter that the programmer,</p>
<p>the human, is bad?</p>
<p>Because the programmer is,</p>
<p>at least with the current state of the art,</p>
<p>is responsible for writing the code correctly</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard enough to keep track of a recipe</p>
<p>that you just execute one step at a time.</p>
<p>Chop the carrots, then peel the potatoes, mix the icing.</p>
<p>You need your whole brain</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re reading a piece of code, what is going on?</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re loading the number of mermaids in variable A</p>
<p>and the number of mermen in variable B</p>
<p>and now we take the average or whatever.</p>
<p>I like how we&rsquo;re just jumping from metaphor to metaphor.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>You have to keep in your head what is in A,</p>
<p>what is in B, what is in C.</p>
<p>Hopefully you have better names.</p>
<p>And that is challenging enough.</p>
<p>If you have two different pieces of code</p>
<p>that are sort of being executed simultaneously,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s using the parallel or the concurrent approach,</p>
<p>if like A is the number of fishermen</p>
<p>and B is the number of programmers,</p>
<p>but in another part of the code,</p>
<p>A is the number of mermaids and B is the number of mermen,</p>
<p>and somehow that&rsquo;s the same variable.</p>
<p>If you do it sequentially,</p>
<p>if first you do your mermaid merpeople computation</p>
<p>and then you do your people in the boat computation,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter that the variables are called A and B</p>
<p>and that is literally the same variable</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re done with one use of that variable.</p>
<p>But when you mix them together,</p>
<p>suddenly the number of merpeople</p>
<p>replaces the number of fishermen</p>
<p>and your computation goes dramatically wrong.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all kinds of ordering of operations</p>
<p>that could result in the assignment of those variables</p>
<p>and so you have to anticipate all possible orderings.</p>
<p>And you think you&rsquo;re smart and you&rsquo;ll put a lock around it</p>
<p>and in practice, in terms of bugs per line,</p>
<p>per 1,000 lines of code,</p>
<p>this is an area where everything is worse.</p>
<p>So a lock is a mechanism by which you forbid</p>
<p>only one chef can access the oven at a time.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>And then semaphores allow you to do what?</p>
<p>Multiple ovens?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a bad idea because if you&rsquo;re sort of,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re preparing, if you&rsquo;re baking cakes</p>
<p>and you have multiple people all baking cakes</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s only one oven,</p>
<p>then maybe you can tell that the oven is in use</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s preheating.</p>
<p>And so you have to, maybe you make a sign</p>
<p>that says oven in use and you flip the sign over</p>
<p>and it says oven is free when you&rsquo;re done baking your cake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lock, that&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>and what do you do when you have two ovens</p>
<p>or maybe you have 10 ovens?</p>
<p>You can put a separate sign on each oven</p>
<p>or maybe you can sort of,</p>
<p>someone who comes in wants to see at a glance</p>
<p>and maybe there&rsquo;s an electronic sign that says</p>
<p>there are still five ovens available.</p>
<p>Or maybe there are already three people waiting for an oven</p>
<p>so you can, if you see an oven that&rsquo;s not in use,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already reserved for someone else</p>
<p>who got in line first.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of what the restaurant metaphor</p>
<p>was trying to explain.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re now tasked,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting as a designer of Python</p>
<p>with a team of brilliant core developers</p>
<p>and have to try to figure out to what degree</p>
<p>can any of these ideas be integrated and not?</p>
<p>So maybe this is a good time to ask,</p>
<p>what is AsyncIO and how has it evolved since Python 3.4?</p>
<p>Wow, yeah, so we had this really old library</p>
<p>for doing things concurrently,</p>
<p>especially things that had to do with IO</p>
<p>and networking IO was especially sort of a popular topic.</p>
<p>And in the Python standard library,</p>
<p>we had a brief period where there was lots of development</p>
<p>and I think it was late 90s, maybe early 2000s</p>
<p>and like two little modules were added</p>
<p>that were the state of the art of doing asynchronous IO</p>
<p>or sort of non-blocking IO,</p>
<p>which means that you can keep multiple network connections</p>
<p>open and sort of service them all in parallel</p>
<p>like a typical web server does.</p>
<p>So IO is input and outputs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re writing either to the network</p>
<p>or read from the network connection</p>
<p>or reading and writing to a hard drive, to storage.</p>
<p>Also possible.</p>
<p>And you can do the ideas you could do to multiple</p>
<p>while also doing computation.</p>
<p>So running some code that does some fancy stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, like when you&rsquo;re writing a web server,</p>
<p>when a request comes in,</p>
<p>a user sort of needs to see a particular web page,</p>
<p>you have to find that page maybe in the database</p>
<p>and format it properly and send it back to the client.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of waiting, waiting for the database,</p>
<p>waiting for the network.</p>
<p>And so you can handle hundreds or thousands</p>
<p>or millions of requests concurrently on one machine.</p>
<p>Anyway, ways of doing that in Python were kind of stagnated.</p>
<p>And I forget, it might&rsquo;ve been around 2012, 2014,</p>
<p>when someone for the umpteenth time actually said,</p>
<p>these async chat and async core modules</p>
<p>that you have in a standard library</p>
<p>are not quite enough to solve my particular problem.</p>
<p>Can we add one tiny little feature?</p>
<p>And everybody said, no, that stuff is not to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to use that stuff.</p>
<p>Write your own using a third-party library.</p>
<p>And then everybody started a debate</p>
<p>about what the right third-party library was.</p>
<p>And somehow I felt that there was actually a queue</p>
<p>for, well, maybe we need a better state-of-the-art module</p>
<p>in the standard library for multiplexing input-output</p>
<p>from different sources.</p>
<p>You could say that it spiraled out of control a little bit.</p>
<p>It was, at the time, it was the largest</p>
<p>Python enhancement proposal that was ever proposed.</p>
<p>And you were deeply involved with that.</p>
<p>At the time, I was very much involved with that.</p>
<p>I was like the lead architect.</p>
<p>I ended up talking to people</p>
<p>who had already developed serious third-party libraries</p>
<p>that did similar things and sort of taking ideas from them</p>
<p>and getting their feedback on my design.</p>
<p>And eventually we put it in the standard library.</p>
<p>And after a few years, I got distracted.</p>
<p>I think the thing, the big thing that distracted me</p>
<p>was actually type annotations.</p>
<p>But other people kept it alive and kicking</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been quite successful actually</p>
<p>in the world of Python web clients.</p>
<p>So initially, what are some of the design challenges there</p>
<p>in that debate for the PEP?</p>
<p>And what are some things that got rejected?</p>
<p>What are some things that got accepted to stand out to you?</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways</p>
<p>you can handle parallel IO.</p>
<p>And this happens sort of at an architectural level</p>
<p>in operating systems as well.</p>
<p>Like Windows prefers to do it one way</p>
<p>and Unix prefers to do it the other way.</p>
<p>You sort of, you have an object</p>
<p>that represents a network endpoint,</p>
<p>say a connection with a web browser that&rsquo;s your client.</p>
<p>And say you&rsquo;re waiting for an incoming request.</p>
<p>Two fundamental approaches are,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m waiting for an incoming request.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing something else.</p>
<p>Come wake me up or sort of come tell me</p>
<p>when something interesting happened,</p>
<p>like a packet came in on that network connection.</p>
<p>And the other paradigm is we&rsquo;re on a team</p>
<p>of a whole bunch of people with maybe a little mind</p>
<p>and we can only manage one web connection at a time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just sitting,</p>
<p>looking at this web connection</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just blocked until something comes in.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m already waiting for it.</p>
<p>I get the data, I process the data</p>
<p>and then I go back to the top and say,</p>
<p>no, sort of, I&rsquo;m waiting for the next packet.</p>
<p>Those are about the two paradigms.</p>
<p>One is a paradigm where there is sort of notionally</p>
<p>a thread of control,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s an actual operating system thread</p>
<p>or more an abstraction in async IO, we call them tasks.</p>
<p>But a task in async IO or a thread in other contexts</p>
<p>is devoted to one thing</p>
<p>and it has logic for all the stages.</p>
<p>Like when it&rsquo;s a web request,</p>
<p>like first wait for the first line of the web request,</p>
<p>parse it because then you know if it&rsquo;s a get or a post</p>
<p>or a put or whatever, or an error.</p>
<p>Then wait until you have a bunch of lines</p>
<p>until there&rsquo;s a blank line,</p>
<p>then parse that as headers and then interpret that</p>
<p>and then wait for the rest of the data to come in</p>
<p>if there is any more that you expect</p>
<p>that sort of standard web stuff.</p>
<p>And the other thing is,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s always endless debate</p>
<p>about which approach is more efficient</p>
<p>and which approach is more error prone,</p>
<p>where I just have a whole bunch of stacks in front of me</p>
<p>and whenever a packet comes in,</p>
<p>I sort of look at the number of the pack,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some number on the packet</p>
<p>and I say, oh, that packet goes in this pile</p>
<p>and then I can do a little bit</p>
<p>and then sort of that pile provides my context.</p>
<p>And as soon as I&rsquo;m done with the processing,</p>
<p>I sort of, I can forget everything about what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>because the next packet will come in</p>
<p>from some random other client</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that pile or it&rsquo;s this pile.</p>
<p>And every time a pile is maybe empty or full</p>
<p>or whatever the criteria is,</p>
<p>I can toss it away or use it for a new space.</p>
<p>But several traditional third party libraries</p>
<p>for asynchronous IO processing in Python</p>
<p>shows the model of a callback</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the idea where you have a bunch</p>
<p>of different stacks of paper in front of you</p>
<p>and every time someone gives you a piece,</p>
<p>gives you a new sheet,</p>
<p>you decide which stack it belongs to.</p>
<p>And that leads to a certain style of spaghetti code</p>
<p>that I find sort of aesthetically not pleasing</p>
<p>and I was sort of never very successful</p>
<p>and I had heard many stories about people</p>
<p>who were also sort of complaining</p>
<p>about that style of coding.</p>
<p>It was very prevalent in JavaScript at the time at least</p>
<p>because it was like how the JavaScript event loop</p>
<p>basically works.</p>
<p>And so I thought, well, the task-based model</p>
<p>where each task has a bunch of logic,</p>
<p>we had mechanisms in the Python language</p>
<p>that we could easily reuse for that.</p>
<p>And I thought I want to build a whole library</p>
<p>for asynchronous networking IO</p>
<p>and all the other things that may need</p>
<p>to be done asynchronously based on that paradigm.</p>
<p>And so I just chose a paradigm</p>
<p>and tried to see how far I could get with that.</p>
<p>And it turns out that it&rsquo;s a pretty good paradigm.</p>
<p>So people enjoy that kind of paradigm programming</p>
<p>for asynchronous IO relative to callbacks.</p>
<p>Okay, beautiful.</p>
<p>So how does that all interplay with the infamous GIL,</p>
<p>the Global Interpreter Lock?</p>
<p>Maybe can you say what the GIL is</p>
<p>and how does it dance beautifully with async IO?</p>
<p>The Global Interpreter Lock solves the problem</p>
<p>that Python originally was not written</p>
<p>with either asynchronous or parallelism in mind at all.</p>
<p>There was no concurrency in the language.</p>
<p>There was no parallelism.</p>
<p>There were no threads.</p>
<p>Only a small number of years</p>
<p>into Python&rsquo;s initial development,</p>
<p>all the new cool operating systems</p>
<p>like SunOS and Silicon Graphics IRIX</p>
<p>and then eventually POSIX and Windows</p>
<p>all came with threading libraries</p>
<p>that lets you do multiple things in parallel.</p>
<p>And there is a certain sort of principle</p>
<p>which is the operating system handles the threads for you.</p>
<p>And the program can pretend that there are as many CPUs</p>
<p>as there are threads in the program.</p>
<p>And those CPUs work completely independently.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have enough CPUs,</p>
<p>the operating system sort of simulates those extra CPUs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have enough CPUs,</p>
<p>you can get a lot of work done</p>
<p>by deploying those multiple CPUs.</p>
<p>But Python wasn&rsquo;t written to do that.</p>
<p>And so as libraries for multi-threading were added to C,</p>
<p>but every operating system vendor</p>
<p>was adding their own version of that.</p>
<p>We thought, and maybe we were wrong,</p>
<p>but at the time we thought,</p>
<p>well, we quickly want to be able</p>
<p>to support these multiple threads</p>
<p>because they seemed at the time in the early 90s</p>
<p>when they were new, at least to me,</p>
<p>they seemed a cool, interesting programming paradigm.</p>
<p>And one of the things that Python, at least at the time,</p>
<p>felt was nice about the language</p>
<p>was that we could give a safe version</p>
<p>of all kinds of cool new operating system toys</p>
<p>to the Python programmer.</p>
<p>Like I remember one or two years before threading,</p>
<p>I had spent some time adding networking sockets to Python</p>
<p>and they were very literal translation</p>
<p>of the networking sockets</p>
<p>that were in the BSD operating system, so Unix BSD.</p>
<p>But the nice thing was if you were using sockets from Python</p>
<p>then all the things you can do wrong with sockets in C</p>
<p>would automatically give you a clear error message</p>
<p>instead of just ending up</p>
<p>with a malfunctioning hanging program.</p>
<p>And so we thought, well,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do the same thing with threading,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t really want to rewrite the interpreter</p>
<p>to be thread safe because that was like,</p>
<p>there would be a very complex refactoring</p>
<p>of all the interpreter code and all the runtime code</p>
<p>because all the objects were written with the assumption</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s only one thread.</p>
<p>And so we said, okay, well, we&rsquo;ll take our losses,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll provide something that looks like threads.</p>
<p>And as long as you only have a single CPU on your computer,</p>
<p>which most computers at the time did,</p>
<p>it feels just like threads</p>
<p>because the whole idea of multiple threads in the OS</p>
<p>was that even if your computer only had one CPU,</p>
<p>you could still fire up as many threads as you wanted.</p>
<p>Well, within reason, maybe 10 or 12, not 5,000.</p>
<p>And so we thought we had conquered</p>
<p>the abstraction of threads pretty well</p>
<p>because multi-core CPUs were not</p>
<p>in most Python programmers&rsquo; hands anyway.</p>
<p>And then of course, a couple of more iterations</p>
<p>of Moore&rsquo;s law and computers getting faster.</p>
<p>And at some point,</p>
<p>the chip designers decided</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t make the CPUs faster,</p>
<p>but they could still make them smaller.</p>
<p>And so they could put multiple CPUs on one chip.</p>
<p>And suddenly there was all this pressure</p>
<p>about do things in parallel.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the solution we had in Python didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of the moment</p>
<p>that the GIL became infamous.</p>
<p>Because the GIL was the solution we used</p>
<p>to sort of take this single interpreter</p>
<p>and share it between all the different operating system</p>
<p>threads that you could create.</p>
<p>And so as long as the hardware</p>
<p>physically only had one CPU, that was all fine.</p>
<p>And then as hardware vendors were suddenly telling us all,</p>
<p>oh, you got to parallelize.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s got to be parallelized.</p>
<p>People started saying, oh,</p>
<p>but we can use multiple threads in Python.</p>
<p>And then they discovered, oh,</p>
<p>but actually all threads run on a single core.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, is there a way,</p>
<p>is there ideas in the future to remove</p>
<p>the global interpreter log GIL?</p>
<p>Like maybe multiple sub-interpreters,</p>
<p>some tricky interpreters on top of interpreters</p>
<p>kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, there are a couple of possible futures there.</p>
<p>The most likely future is that we&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>multiple sub-interpreters,</p>
<p>which each run a completely independent Python program.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still some benefit</p>
<p>of sort of faster communication</p>
<p>between those programs.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also managing for you</p>
<p>this running a multiple Python programs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hidden from you, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hidden from you,</p>
<p>but you have to spend more time communicating</p>
<p>between those programs,</p>
<p>because the sort of,</p>
<p>the attractive thing about the multi-threaded model</p>
<p>is that the threads can share objects.</p>
<p>At the same time, that&rsquo;s also the downfall</p>
<p>of the multi-threaded programming model,</p>
<p>because when you do share objects,</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t necessarily intend to share them,</p>
<p>or there were aspects of those objects</p>
<p>that were not reusable,</p>
<p>you get all kinds of concurrency bugs.</p>
<p>And so the reason I wrote that little blog post</p>
<p>about semaphores was that concurrency bugs are just harder.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Python had no global interpreter lock,</p>
<p>and it had the so-called free threading,</p>
<p>but it would also cause a lot more software bugs.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that there is still</p>
<p>a possible future where we are actually going to,</p>
<p>or where we could experiment at least with that,</p>
<p>because there is a guy working for Facebook</p>
<p>who has developed a fork of CPython</p>
<p>that he called the no-gill interpreter,</p>
<p>where he removed the gill</p>
<p>and made a whole bunch of optimizations</p>
<p>so that the single-threaded case doesn&rsquo;t run too much slower,</p>
<p>and multi-threaded case will actually use</p>
<p>all the cores that you have.</p>
<p>And so that would be an interesting possibility</p>
<p>if we would be willing as Python core developers</p>
<p>to actually maintain that code indefinitely.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re willing to put up</p>
<p>with the additional complexity of the interpreter</p>
<p>and the additional sort of overhead</p>
<p>for the single-threaded case,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m personally not convinced</p>
<p>that there are enough people</p>
<p>needing the speed of multiple threads</p>
<p>with their Python programs</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s worth to sort of take that performance hit</p>
<p>and that complexity hit.</p>
<p>And I feel that the gill actually is a pretty nice</p>
<p>Goldilocks point between no threads</p>
<p>and all threads all the time,</p>
<p>but not everybody agrees on that.</p>
<p>So that is definitely a possible future.</p>
<p>The sub-interpreters look like a fairly safe bet for 3.12,</p>
<p>so say a year from now.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the goal is to do a new version every year</p>
<p>for Python.</p>
<p>Let me ask you perhaps a fun question,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a philosophy to it too.</p>
<p>Will there ever be a Python 4.0?</p>
<p>Now, before you say it&rsquo;s currently a joke</p>
<p>and probably not, we&rsquo;re gonna go to 3.99 or 3.999,</p>
<p>can you imagine possible features</p>
<p>that Python 4.0 might have</p>
<p>that would necessitate the creation of the new 4.0?</p>
<p>Given the amount of pain and joy,</p>
<p>suffering and triumph that was involved</p>
<p>in the move between version two and version three?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, as a community and as a core development team,</p>
<p>we have a large amount of painful memories</p>
<p>about the Python 3 transition.</p>
<p>Which is one reason that sort of everybody is happy</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve decided there&rsquo;s not going to be a 4.0</p>
<p>at least, not anytime soon.</p>
<p>And if there is going to be one,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll sort of plan the transition very differently.</p>
<p>Because clearly we underestimated the pain</p>
<p>the transition caused for our users in the Python 3 case.</p>
<p>And had we known we could have sort of designed Python 3</p>
<p>somewhat differently without making it any worse,</p>
<p>we just thought that we had a good plan,</p>
<p>but we underestimated what sort of the users</p>
<p>were capable of when it comes to that kind of transition.</p>
<p>By the way, I think we talked way before,</p>
<p>like a year and a half before the Python 2 officially.</p>
<p>End of life.</p>
<p>End of life.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>What was your memory of the end of life?</p>
<p>Did you shed a tear on January 1st, 2020?</p>
<p>Was there, were you standing alone?</p>
<p>Everyone on the core team had basically moved</p>
<p>on years before.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was purely, it was a little symbolic moment</p>
<p>to signal to the remaining users that</p>
<p>there was no longer going to be any new releases</p>
<p>or support for Python 2.7.</p>
<p>Did you shed a single tear</p>
<p>while looking out over the horizon?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a very poetic person</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t shed tears like that, but no.</p>
<p>No, we actually had planned a party,</p>
<p>but the party was planned for the Python,</p>
<p>the US Python conference that year,</p>
<p>which would never happened, of course,</p>
<p>because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Oh, was it like in March or something?</p>
<p>Yeah, the conference was going to be,</p>
<p>I think, late April that year.</p>
<p>So that was a very difficult decision to cancel it,</p>
<p>but they did.</p>
<p>So anyway, if we&rsquo;re going to have a Python 4,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to have both a different reason</p>
<p>for having that and a different process</p>
<p>for managing the transition.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a possible process that,</p>
<p>so I think you&rsquo;re implying that if there is a 4.0,</p>
<p>in some ways it would break back compatibility?</p>
<p>Well, so here is a concrete thought I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not unique, but not everyone agrees with this,</p>
<p>so this is definitely a personal opinion.</p>
<p>If we were to try something like that Nogill Python,</p>
<p>my expectation is that it would feel just different enough,</p>
<p>at least for the part of the Python ecosystem</p>
<p>that is heavily based on C extensions.</p>
<p>And that is like the entire machine learning,</p>
<p>data science, scientific Python world</p>
<p>is all based on C extensions for Python.</p>
<p>And so those people would likely feel the pain the most,</p>
<p>because they, even if we don&rsquo;t change anything</p>
<p>about the syntax of the language</p>
<p>and the semantics of the language</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re writing Python code,</p>
<p>we could even say, suppose that after Python,</p>
<p>say 3.19 instead of 3.20, we&rsquo;ll have 4.0.</p>
<p>Suppose that&rsquo;s the time when we flip the switch to 4.0,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll not have a GIL.</p>
<p>Imagine it was like that.</p>
<p>So I would probably say that particular year,</p>
<p>the release that we name 4.0 will be syntactically,</p>
<p>it will not have any new syntactical features,</p>
<p>no new modules in the standard library,</p>
<p>no new built-in functions.</p>
<p>Everything will be at the Python level</p>
<p>will be purely compatible with Python 3.19.</p>
<p>However, extension modules will have to make a change.</p>
<p>They will have to be recompiled.</p>
<p>They will not have the same binary interface,</p>
<p>the semantics and APIs for some things</p>
<p>that are frequently accessed by C extensions</p>
<p>will be different.</p>
<p>And so for a pure Python user, 4.0 would be a breeze,</p>
<p>except that there are very few pure Python users left</p>
<p>because everybody who is using Python</p>
<p>for something significant is using third-party extensions.</p>
<p>There are like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>several hundreds of thousands of third-party extensions</p>
<p>on the PyPI service.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re all good,</p>
<p>but there is a large list of extensions</p>
<p>that would have to do work.</p>
<p>And some of those extensions</p>
<p>are currently already low on maintainers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re struggling to keep afloat.</p>
<p>So there you can give a huge heads up to them</p>
<p>if you go to 4.0 to really keep developing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;d probably have to do something like</p>
<p>several years before, who knows,</p>
<p>maybe five years earlier, like 3.15,</p>
<p>we would have to say,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just making the specific numbers up,</p>
<p>but at some point we&rsquo;d have to say</p>
<p>the Nogail Python could be an option.</p>
<p>It might be a compile-time option.</p>
<p>If you want to use Nogail Python,</p>
<p>you have to recompile Python from source</p>
<p>for your platform using your tool set.</p>
<p>All you have to do is change one configuration variable</p>
<p>and then you just run make or configure and make</p>
<p>and it will build it for you.</p>
<p>But now you also have to use</p>
<p>the Nogail compatible versions</p>
<p>of all extension modules you want to use.</p>
<p>And so as long as many extension modules</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have fully functional sort of variants</p>
<p>that work within the Nogail world,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a very practical thing for Python users,</p>
<p>but it would allow extension developers</p>
<p>to test the waters,</p>
<p>see what they need to syntactically</p>
<p>to be able to compile at all.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re using functions</p>
<p>that are defined by the Python 3 runtime</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t be in the Python 4 runtime.</p>
<p>Those functions will not work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have to find an alternative,</p>
<p>but they can experiment with that</p>
<p>and sort of write test applications.</p>
<p>And that would be a way to transition</p>
<p>and that could be a series of releases</p>
<p>where the Python 4 is more and more imminent</p>
<p>and we have supported more and more</p>
<p>third-party extension modules to have solid support</p>
<p>that works for Nogail Python for that new API.</p>
<p>And then sort of Python 4.0 is like the official moment</p>
<p>that the mayor comes out and cuts the ribbon</p>
<p>and now Python, now the sort of Nogail mode</p>
<p>is the default and maybe the only mode there is.</p>
<p>The internet wants to know from Reddit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small and fun question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many fun questions,</p>
<p>but out of the PyPi packages, PyPI packages,</p>
<p>do you have ones you like?</p>
<p>In your opinion, are there must have PyPi libraries</p>
<p>or ones you use all the time constantly?</p>
<p>Oh my, I should really have a standard answer</p>
<p>for that question, but like a positive standard answer,</p>
<p>but my current standard answer is that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big user of third-party packages.</p>
<p>When I write Python code,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually developing some tooling</p>
<p>around building Python itself.</p>
<p>And the last thing we want is dependencies</p>
<p>on third-party packages.</p>
<p>So I tend to just use the standard library.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where your focus is, that&rsquo;s where your mind is.</p>
<p>But do you keep an eye of what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>to understand where the standard library</p>
<p>could be moving, should be moving?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good kind of landscape</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s missing from the standard library.</p>
<p>Well, usually when something&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>from the standard library nowadays,</p>
<p>it is a relatively new idea</p>
<p>and there is a third-party implementation</p>
<p>or maybe possibly multiple third-party implementations,</p>
<p>but they evolve at a much higher rate</p>
<p>than they could when they&rsquo;re in the standard library.</p>
<p>So it would be a big reduction in activity</p>
<p>to incorporate things like that in the standard library.</p>
<p>So I like that there is a lively package ecosystem</p>
<p>and that sort of recent trends in the standard library</p>
<p>are actually that we&rsquo;re doing the occasional spring cleaning</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re choosing some modules</p>
<p>that have not had a lot of change in a long time</p>
<p>and that maybe would be better off</p>
<p>not existing at all at this point</p>
<p>because there might be a better third-party</p>
<p>alternative anyway,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re sort of slowly removing those.</p>
<p>Often those are things that I sort of,</p>
<p>I spiked somewhere in 1992 or 1993.</p>
<p>And if you look through the commit history,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very sad, like all cosmetic changes,</p>
<p>like changes in the indentation style</p>
<p>or the name of this other standard library module</p>
<p>got changed or nothing of any substance.</p>
<p>The API is identical to what it was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>So speaking of packages,</p>
<p>they have a lot of impact on a lot of people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to you</p>
<p>why Python has become the primary,</p>
<p>the dominant language for the machine learning community?</p>
<p>So packages like PyTorch, TensorFlow,</p>
<p>scikit-learn, and even like the lower level stuff</p>
<p>like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib with visualization.</p>
<p>Can you like, does it make sense to you</p>
<p>why it permeated the entire data science,</p>
<p>machine learning, AI community?</p>
<p>Well, part of it is an effect</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as simple as we&rsquo;re all driving</p>
<p>on the right side of the road, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s compatibility.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And part of it is not quite as fundamental</p>
<p>as driving on the right side of the road,</p>
<p>which you have to do for safety reasons.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to agree on something.</p>
<p>They could have picked JavaScript or Perl.</p>
<p>There was a time in the early 2000s</p>
<p>that it really looked like Perl</p>
<p>was going to dominate like biosciences</p>
<p>because DNA search was all based on regular expressions</p>
<p>and Perl has the fastest</p>
<p>and most comprehensive regular expression engine, still does.</p>
<p>I spent quite a long time with Perl.</p>
<p>That was another letting go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Letting go of this kind of data processing system.</p>
<p>The reasons why Python became the lingua franca</p>
<p>of scientific code and machine learning in particular</p>
<p>and data science, it really had a lot to do</p>
<p>with anything was better than C or C++.</p>
<p>Recently, a guy who worked</p>
<p>at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories</p>
<p>in the sort of computing division wrote me his memoirs</p>
<p>and he had his own view of how he helped</p>
<p>something he called computational steering into existence.</p>
<p>And this was the idea that you take libraries</p>
<p>that in his days were written in Fortran</p>
<p>that solved universal mathematical problems</p>
<p>and those libraries still work</p>
<p>but the scientists that use the libraries</p>
<p>use them to solve continuously different</p>
<p>specific applications and answer different questions.</p>
<p>And so those poor scientists were required to use say Fortran</p>
<p>because Fortran was the language</p>
<p>that the library was written in.</p>
<p>And then the scientists would have to write an application</p>
<p>that sort of uses the library to solve a particular equation</p>
<p>or set off of answer a set of questions</p>
<p>and the same for C++ because there&rsquo;s interoperability.</p>
<p>So the dusty decks are written either in C++</p>
<p>or Fortran and so Paul Dubois was one of the people</p>
<p>who I think in the mid 90s saw</p>
<p>that you needed a higher level language</p>
<p>for the scientists to sort of tie together</p>
<p>the fundamental mathematical algorithms</p>
<p>of linear algebra and other stuff.</p>
<p>And so gradually some libraries started appearing</p>
<p>that did very fundamental stuff</p>
<p>with arrays of numbers in Python.</p>
<p>I mean, when I first created Python</p>
<p>I was not expecting it to be used for arrays of numbers much</p>
<p>I thought that was like an outdated data type</p>
<p>and everything was like objects and strings</p>
<p>and like Python was good</p>
<p>and fast at string manipulation and objects obviously</p>
<p>but arrays of numbers were not very efficient</p>
<p>and the multidimensional arrays didn&rsquo;t even exist</p>
<p>in the language at all.</p>
<p>But there were people who realized</p>
<p>that Python had extensibility that was flexible enough</p>
<p>that they could write third party packages</p>
<p>that did support large arrays of numbers</p>
<p>and operations on them very efficiently.</p>
<p>And somehow they got a foothold</p>
<p>through sort of different parts of the scientific community.</p>
<p>I remembered that the Hubble Space Telescope people</p>
<p>in Baltimore were somehow big Python fans in the late 90s.</p>
<p>And at various points, small improvements were made</p>
<p>and more people got in touch with using Python</p>
<p>to derive these libraries of interesting algorithms.</p>
<p>And like once you have a bunch of scientists</p>
<p>who are working on similar problems</p>
<p>say they&rsquo;re all working on stuff that comes in</p>
<p>from the Hubble Space Telescope</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re looking at different things.</p>
<p>Some are looking at stars in this galaxy</p>
<p>other are looking at galaxies.</p>
<p>The math is completely different</p>
<p>but the underlying libraries are still the same.</p>
<p>And so they exchange code.</p>
<p>They say, well, I wrote this Python program</p>
<p>or I wrote a Python library to solve this class of problems.</p>
<p>And the other guys either say, oh, I can use that library too</p>
<p>or if you make a few changes, I can use that library too.</p>
<p>Why start from scratch in Perl or JavaScript</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s not that infrastructure</p>
<p>for arrays of numbers yet whereas in Python, you have it.</p>
<p>And so more and more scientists at different places</p>
<p>doing different work discovered Python</p>
<p>and then people who had an idea</p>
<p>for an important new fundamental library decided,</p>
<p>oh, Python is actually already known to our users.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use Python as the user interface.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how TensorFlow,</p>
<p>I imagine at least that&rsquo;s how TensorFlow ended up</p>
<p>with Python as the user interface.</p>
<p>Right, but with TensorFlow,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a deeper history of what the community,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just like what packages it needs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what the community leans on</p>
<p>for a programming language</p>
<p>because TensorFlow had a prior library</p>
<p>that was internal to Google,</p>
<p>but there was also competing machine learning frameworks</p>
<p>like Theano, Caffe that were in Python.</p>
<p>There was some Scala, some other languages,</p>
<p>but Python was really dominating it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because there&rsquo;s other languages</p>
<p>from the engineering space like MATLAB</p>
<p>that a lot of people used,</p>
<p>but different design choices by the company,</p>
<p>by the core developers led to it not spreading.</p>
<p>And one of the choices of MATLAB by MathWorks</p>
<p>is to not make it open source, right?</p>
<p>Or not having people pay.</p>
<p>It was a very expensive product</p>
<p>and so universities especially disliked it</p>
<p>because it was a price per seat, I remember hearing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think that&rsquo;s not why it failed</p>
<p>or it failed to spread.</p>
<p>I think the universities didn&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>but they would still pay for it.</p>
<p>The thing is it didn&rsquo;t feed into that GitHub</p>
<p>open source packages culture.</p>
<p>So like, and that&rsquo;s somehow a precondition</p>
<p>for viral spreading, the hacker culture,</p>
<p>like the tinkerer culture.</p>
<p>With Python, it feels like you can build a package</p>
<p>from scratch or solve a particular problem</p>
<p>and get excited about sharing that package with others.</p>
<p>And that creates an excitement about a language.</p>
<p>I tend to like Python&rsquo;s approach to open source</p>
<p>in particular because it&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost egalitarian.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little hierarchy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously some because like you all need to decide</p>
<p>whether you drive on the left or the right side</p>
<p>of the road sometimes.</p>
<p>But there is a lot of access for people with little power.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to work for a big tech company</p>
<p>to make a difference in the Python world.</p>
<p>We have affordable events that really care about community</p>
<p>and support people and sort of the community</p>
<p>is like a big deal at our conferences and in the PSF.</p>
<p>When the PSF funds events,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always about growing the community.</p>
<p>The PSF funds very little development.</p>
<p>They do some, but most of the development,</p>
<p>most of the money that the PSF forks out</p>
<p>is to community fostering things.</p>
<p>So speaking of egalitarian,</p>
<p>last time we talked four years ago,</p>
<p>it was just after you stepped down from your role</p>
<p>as the benevolent dictator for life, BDFL.</p>
<p>Looking back, what are your insights and lessons</p>
<p>you learned from that experience</p>
<p>about Python developer community, about human nature,</p>
<p>about human civilization, life itself?</p>
<p>Oh my, I probably held on to the position too long.</p>
<p>I remember being just extremely stressed for a long time</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t very clear to me what was leading,</p>
<p>what was causing the stress.</p>
<p>And looking back, I should have sort of relinquished</p>
<p>my central role as BDFL sooner.</p>
<p>What were the pros and cons of the BDFL role?</p>
<p>Like what were the, you not relinquishing it,</p>
<p>what are the benefits of that for the community?</p>
<p>And what are the drawbacks?</p>
<p>Well, the benefits for the community would be things like</p>
<p>clarity of vision and sort of a clear direction</p>
<p>because I had certain ideas in mind when I created Python.</p>
<p>And while I sort of let myself be influenced</p>
<p>by many other ideas as Python evolved</p>
<p>and became more successful and more complex and more used,</p>
<p>I also stuck to certain principles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still hard to say</p>
<p>what are Python&rsquo;s core principles.</p>
<p>But the fact that I was playing that role</p>
<p>and sort of always very active</p>
<p>grew the community in a certain way.</p>
<p>It modeled to the community how to think</p>
<p>about how to solve a certain problem.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>That was a source of stress, but it was also beneficial.</p>
<p>It was a source of stress for me personally,</p>
<p>but it was beneficial for the community</p>
<p>because people sort of over time had learned</p>
<p>how I was thinking and could predict</p>
<p>but how I would decide about a particular issue</p>
<p>and not always perfectly, of course,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of jerking around.</p>
<p>Like this year, we&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>but this year the Democrats are in power</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And now the Republicans are in power</p>
<p>and they roll all that back and do those kinds of things.</p>
<p>There is a clear, fairly straight path ahead.</p>
<p>And so fortunately the successor structure</p>
<p>with the steering council has sort of found a similar way</p>
<p>of leading the community in a fairly steady direction</p>
<p>without stagnating.</p>
<p>And for me personally, it&rsquo;s more fun</p>
<p>because there are things I can just ignore.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, there&rsquo;s a bug in multiprocessing.</p>
<p>Let someone else decide whether that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to solve or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stick to typing in the async IO</p>
<p>and the faster interpreter.</p>
<p>Yeah, it allows you to focus a little bit more.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are interesting differences in culture,</p>
<p>if you can comment on, between Google, Dropbox</p>
<p>and Microsoft from a Python programming perspective,</p>
<p>all places you&rsquo;ve been to, the positive.</p>
<p>Well, is there a difference or is it just about people</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s great people everywhere</p>
<p>or is there culture differences?</p>
<p>Sort of Dropbox is much smaller</p>
<p>than the other two in your list.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that is a big difference.</p>
<p>The set of products they provide is narrower</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re more focused.</p>
<p>And yeah, and Dropbox sort of,</p>
<p>at least during the time I was there,</p>
<p>had the tendency of sort of making a big plan,</p>
<p>putting the whole company behind that plan for a year</p>
<p>and then evaluate and then suddenly find that</p>
<p>everything was wrong about the plan</p>
<p>and then they had to do something completely different.</p>
<p>And so there was like, the annual engineering reorg</p>
<p>was sort of an unpleasant tradition at Dropbox</p>
<p>because like, oh, there&rsquo;s a new VP of engineering</p>
<p>and so now all the directors are being reshuffled</p>
<p>and this guy was in charge of infrastructure one year</p>
<p>and the next year he was made in charge of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, product development.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating because like,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think about these companies internally,</p>
<p>but I, you know, Dropbox to me from the very beginning</p>
<p>was one of my favorite services.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain like programs and online services</p>
<p>that make me happy, make me more efficient</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But one of the powers of those kinds of services,</p>
<p>they disappear.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to think about how it all works,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s incredible to me that you can sync stuff</p>
<p>effortlessly across so many machines so quickly</p>
<p>and like, don&rsquo;t have to worry about conflicts.</p>
<p>They take care of the, you know,</p>
<p>as a person that comes from a version repositories</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>or merge is super difficult</p>
<p>and just keeping different versions of different files</p>
<p>is very tricky.</p>
<p>The fact that they could take care of that is just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the engineering behind the scenes</p>
<p>must be super difficult,</p>
<p>both on the compute infrastructure and the software.</p>
<p>A lot of internal sort of hand-wringing</p>
<p>about things like that,</p>
<p>but the product itself always worked very smoothly.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s probably a lot of lessons to that.</p>
<p>You can have a lot of turmoil inside</p>
<p>on the engineering side,</p>
<p>but if the product is good, the product is good.</p>
<p>And maybe don&rsquo;t mess with that either.</p>
<p>You know, when it&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>keep, it&rsquo;s like with Google,</p>
<p>focus on the search and the ads, right?</p>
<p>And the money will come.</p>
<p>Yeah, and make sure that&rsquo;s done extremely well</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t forget what you do extremely well.</p>
<p>In what ways do you provide value and happiness</p>
<p>to the world?</p>
<p>Make sure you do that well.</p>
<p>Is there something else to say</p>
<p>about Google and Microsoft?</p>
<p>Microsoft has had a very fascinating shift recently</p>
<p>with a new CEO,</p>
<p>with, you know, recent CEO,</p>
<p>with purchasing GitHub,</p>
<p>embracing open source culture,</p>
<p>embracing the developer culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty interesting to see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like why I joined Microsoft.</p>
<p>I mean, after retiring and thinking</p>
<p>that I would stay retired for the rest of my life,</p>
<p>which of course was a ridiculous thought,</p>
<p>but I was done working for a bit</p>
<p>and then the pandemic made me realize</p>
<p>that work can also provide a source of fulfillment,</p>
<p>keep you out of trouble.</p>
<p>Microsoft is a very interesting company</p>
<p>because it has this incredible,</p>
<p>very long and varied history</p>
<p>and this amazing catalog of products</p>
<p>that many of which also date way back.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking to a bunch of Excel people lately</p>
<p>and Excel is like 35 years old</p>
<p>and they can still read spreadsheets</p>
<p>that they might find on an old floppy drive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, man,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been so many incredible tools through the years.</p>
<p>Excel, one of the great shames of my life</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;ve never learned how to use Excel well.</p>
<p>I mean, it just always felt like so many features are there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar with IDEs like PyCharm.</p>
<p>It feels like I converge quickly</p>
<p>to the dumbest way to use a thing to get the job done</p>
<p>when clearly there&rsquo;s so much more power at your fingertips.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I do think there&rsquo;s probably expert users of Excel.</p>
<p>Oh, Excel is a cash cow actually.</p>
<p>Oh, it actually brings in money.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>A lot of the engineering sort of,</p>
<p>if you look deep inside Excel,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some very good engineering,</p>
<p>very, very impressive stuff.</p>
<p>Okay, now I need to definitely learn Excel a little better.</p>
<p>I had issues because I&rsquo;m a keyboard person</p>
<p>so I had issues coming up with shortcuts.</p>
<p>I mean, Microsoft sometimes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s changed over the years,</p>
<p>but sometimes they kind of wanna make things easier for you</p>
<p>on the surface and therefore make it harder</p>
<p>for people that like to have shortcuts</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff to optimize their workflow.</p>
<p>Now, Excel&rsquo;s probably, people are probably yelling at me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, Excel probably has a lot of ways</p>
<p>to optimize workflow.</p>
<p>In fact, I keep discovering that there are many features</p>
<p>in Excel that only exists at keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the sense I have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m embarrassed that it&rsquo;s just-</p>
<p>You just have to know what they are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s no logic or reason</p>
<p>to the assignment of the keyboard shortcuts</p>
<p>because they go back even longer than 35 years.</p>
<p>Can you maybe comment about such in Adela</p>
<p>and how hard it is for a CEO to sort of pivot a company</p>
<p>towards open source, towards developer culture?</p>
<p>Is there something you could see about like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of leadership in such a pivot</p>
<p>and definition of a new vision?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met him, but I hear</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just a really sharp thinker,</p>
<p>but he also has an incredible business sense.</p>
<p>He took the organization that had very solid pieces,</p>
<p>but that was also struggling</p>
<p>with all sorts of shameful things,</p>
<p>especially the Steve Ballmer time.</p>
<p>I imagine in part through his personal charm and thinking,</p>
<p>and of course the great trust</p>
<p>that the rest of the leadership has in him,</p>
<p>he managed to really turn the company around</p>
<p>and sort of change it from openly hostile to open source,</p>
<p>to actively embracing open source.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean that suddenly</p>
<p>Excel is going to go open source,</p>
<p>but that means that there&rsquo;s room for a product like VS Code,</p>
<p>which is open source.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It gives me faith that large companies</p>
<p>with good leadership can grow, can expand,</p>
<p>can change and pivot and so on, develop,</p>
<p>because it gets harder and harder as the company gets large.</p>
<p>You wrote a blog post in response to a person</p>
<p>looking for advice about whether with a CS degree</p>
<p>to choose a nine to five job or to become an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>If you just think from first principles right now,</p>
<p>somebody has took a few years in programming,</p>
<p>has loved software engineering,</p>
<p>in some sense creating Python is an entrepreneurial endeavor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a choice that a lot of people</p>
<p>that are good programmers have to make.</p>
<p>Do I work for a big company or do I create something new?</p>
<p>Or you can work for a big company</p>
<p>and create something new there.</p>
<p>Oh, inside the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, big companies have individuals</p>
<p>who create new stuff that eventually grows big all the time.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re the person that creates a new thing</p>
<p>and it grows big, you&rsquo;ll have a chance</p>
<p>to move up quickly in the company, to run that thing.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s your aspiration.</p>
<p>What can also happen is that someone is a brilliant engineer</p>
<p>and sort of builds a great first version of a product</p>
<p>and has no aspirations to then become a manager</p>
<p>and grow the team from five people to 20 people</p>
<p>to 100 people to 1000 people</p>
<p>and be in charge of hiring and meetings.</p>
<p>And they move on to inventing another crazy thing</p>
<p>inside the same company.</p>
<p>Or sometimes they found a startup</p>
<p>or they move to a different great large or small company.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of models.</p>
<p>And sometimes people sort of do have this whole trajectory</p>
<p>from engineer buckling down, writing code,</p>
<p>not nine to five, but more like noon till midnight,</p>
<p>seven days a week, and coming up with a product</p>
<p>and sort of staying in charge.</p>
<p>I mean, if you take Drew Houston, Dropbox&rsquo;s founder,</p>
<p>he is still the CEO.</p>
<p>And at least when I was there,</p>
<p>he had not checked out or anything.</p>
<p>He was a good CEO,</p>
<p>but he had started out as the technical inventor</p>
<p>or co-inventor.</p>
<p>And so he was someone who,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he always aspired that.</p>
<p>I think when he was 16, he already started a company.</p>
<p>So maybe he did, but he sort of,</p>
<p>it turned out that he did have the personal</p>
<p>sort of skillset needed to grow and stay on top.</p>
<p>And other people sort of are brilliant engineers</p>
<p>and horrible at management.</p>
<p>I count myself at least in the second category.</p>
<p>So your first love and still your love</p>
<p>is to be the quote-unquote individual contributor.</p>
<p>So the programmer.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for a programming beginner</p>
<p>on how to learn Python the right way?</p>
<p>Find something you actually want to do with it.</p>
<p>If you say, I want to learn skill X,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not enough motivation.</p>
<p>You need to pick something,</p>
<p>and it can be a crazy problem you want to solve.</p>
<p>It can be completely unrealistic.</p>
<p>But something that challenges you</p>
<p>into actually learning coding in some language.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many projects out there you can look for.</p>
<p>Like that doesn&rsquo;t have to be some big ambitious thing.</p>
<p>It could be writing a small bot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into social media,</p>
<p>you can write a Reddit bot or a Twitter bot</p>
<p>or some aspect of automating something</p>
<p>that you do every single day.</p>
<p>Processing files, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Nowadays you can take machine learning components</p>
<p>and sort of plug those things together.</p>
<p>So you can do cool stuff with them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually a really good example.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in machine learning,</p>
<p>the state of machine learning is such</p>
<p>that a tutorial that takes an hour</p>
<p>can get you to start using pre-trained models</p>
<p>to do something super cool.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good way to learn Python</p>
<p>because you learn just enough to run this model.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a sneaky way to get in there</p>
<p>to figure out how to import stuff,</p>
<p>how to write basic IO, how to run functions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the best way</p>
<p>to learn the basics in Python,</p>
<p>but it could be nice to just fall in love first</p>
<p>and then figure out the basics, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t expect to learn Python</p>
<p>from a one hour video.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blanking out on the name of someone</p>
<p>who wrote a very funny blog post where he said,</p>
<p>I see all these ads for things like,</p>
<p>learn Python in 10 days or so.</p>
<p>And he said, the goal should be learn Python in 10 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious, but I completely disagree with that.</p>
<p>I think the criticism behind that</p>
<p>is that the places just like the blog post from earlier,</p>
<p>the places that tell you learn Python</p>
<p>in five minutes or 10 minutes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually usually really bad tutorials.</p>
<p>So the thing is I do believe</p>
<p>that you can learn a thing in an hour</p>
<p>to get some interesting, quick, it hooks you.</p>
<p>But it just takes a tremendous amount of skill</p>
<p>to be that kind of educator.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman was able to condense a lot of ideas</p>
<p>in physics in a very short amount of time,</p>
<p>but that takes a deep, deep understanding.</p>
<p>And so yes, of course, the actual,</p>
<p>I think the 10 years is about the experience,</p>
<p>the pain along the way,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something fundamental.</p>
<p>Well, you have to practice.</p>
<p>You can memorize the syntax,</p>
<p>but, well, I couldn&rsquo;t, but maybe someone else can,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t make you a coder.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, coding has changed in fascinating ways</p>
<p>because so much of coding is copying, pasting</p>
<p>from Stack Overflow and then adjusting,</p>
<p>which is another way of coding.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to talk down</p>
<p>to that kind of style of coding</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of a nicely efficient.</p>
<p>But do you know where that is going?</p>
<p>Code generation?</p>
<p>No, seriously, GitHub Copilot.</p>
<p>Yeah, Copilot.</p>
<p>I use it every day and it-</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, it writes a lot of code for me.</p>
<p>And usually it&rsquo;s slightly wrong,</p>
<p>but it still saves me typing</p>
<p>because all I have to do is change one word</p>
<p>in a line of text that otherwise it generated perfectly.</p>
<p>And how many times are you looking for,</p>
<p>oh, what was I doing this morning?</p>
<p>I was looking for a begin marker</p>
<p>and I was looking for an end marker.</p>
<p>And so begin is blah, blah, blah, search for begin.</p>
<p>This is the begin token.</p>
<p>And then the next line I type E</p>
<p>and it completes the whole line with end instead of begin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very simple example.</p>
<p>Sometimes it sort of, if I name my function right,</p>
<p>it writes a five or 10 line function.</p>
<p>And you know Python enough</p>
<p>to very quickly then detect the issues.</p>
<p>So it becomes a really good dance partner then.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t save me a lot of thinking,</p>
<p>but since I&rsquo;m a poor typist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much appreciative of all the typing it does for me</p>
<p>much better actually than the previous generation</p>
<p>of suggestions that are also still built in VS Code.</p>
<p>Where when you hit like a dot,</p>
<p>it tries to guess what the type is of the variable</p>
<p>to the left of the dot.</p>
<p>And then it gives you a list,</p>
<p>a pop down menu of what the attributes of that object are.</p>
<p>But Copilot is much, much smoother than that.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s fascinating to hear that you use GitHub Copilot.</p>
<p>Do you think, do you worry about the future of that?</p>
<p>Did the automatic code generation,</p>
<p>the increasing amount of that kind of capability,</p>
<p>are programmers jobs threatened</p>
<p>or is there still a significant role for humans?</p>
<p>Are programmers jobs threatened</p>
<p>by the existence of Stack Overflow?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>It helps you take care of the boring stuff.</p>
<p>And you shouldn&rsquo;t try to use it to do something</p>
<p>that you have no way of understanding what you&rsquo;re doing yet.</p>
<p>A tool like that is always best</p>
<p>when the question you&rsquo;re asking is,</p>
<p>please remind me of how I do this,</p>
<p>which I could do, I could look up how to do it,</p>
<p>but right now I&rsquo;ve forgotten</p>
<p>whether the method is called foo or bar</p>
<p>or what the shape of the API is.</p>
<p>Does it use a builder object or a constructor</p>
<p>or a factory or something else?</p>
<p>And what are the parameters?</p>
<p>It serves that role.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a great assistant,</p>
<p>but the creative work of sort of deciding</p>
<p>what you want the code to do is totally yours.</p>
<p>What do you think is the future of Python</p>
<p>in the next 10, 20, 50 years, 100 years?</p>
<p>You look forward, you ever imagine a future</p>
<p>of human civilization living inside the metaverse,</p>
<p>on Mars, humanoid robots everywhere?</p>
<p>What part does Python play in that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll eventually become sort of a legacy language</p>
<p>that plays an important role,</p>
<p>but that most people have never heard of</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t need to know about,</p>
<p>just like all kinds of basic structures in biology,</p>
<p>like mitochondria.</p>
<p>So it permeates all of life, all of digital life,</p>
<p>but people just build on top of it.</p>
<p>And they only know the stuff that&rsquo;s on top of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You guys, you build layers of abstractions.</p>
<p>I mean, most programmers nowadays</p>
<p>rarely need to do binary arithmetic, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, or even think about it, or even learn about it,</p>
<p>or they could go quite far without knowing.</p>
<p>I started building little digital circuits</p>
<p>out of NAND gates that I built myself</p>
<p>with transistors and resistors.</p>
<p>So I sort of, I feel very blessed</p>
<p>that with that start, when I was a teenager,</p>
<p>I learned some of the basic, at least concepts</p>
<p>that go into building a computer.</p>
<p>And I sort of, every part,</p>
<p>I have some understanding what it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s there and how it works.</p>
<p>And I can forget about all that most of the time,</p>
<p>but I sort of, I enjoy knowing, oh, if you go deeper,</p>
<p>at some point you get to NAND gates</p>
<p>and half adders and shift registers.</p>
<p>And when it comes to the point of how do you actually make</p>
<p>a chip out of silicon, I have no idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just magic to me.</p>
<p>But you enjoy knowing that you can walk a while</p>
<p>towards the lower and lower layers, but you don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>The other day, as a sort of a mental exercise,</p>
<p>I was trying to figure out if I could build</p>
<p>a flip-flop circuit out of relays.</p>
<p>I was just sort of trying to remember,</p>
<p>oh, how does a relay work?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s like this electromagnetic force</p>
<p>that pulls a switch open or shut.</p>
<p>And you can have like, it can open one switch</p>
<p>and shut another.</p>
<p>And you can have multiple contacts that go at once.</p>
<p>And how many relays do I really need</p>
<p>to sort of represent one bit of information?</p>
<p>Can the relay just feed on itself?</p>
<p>And it was, I don&rsquo;t think I got to the final solution,</p>
<p>but it was fun that I could still do a little bit</p>
<p>of problem-solving and thinking at that level.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cool how we build on top of each other.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s people that are just,</p>
<p>you stood on the shoulders of giants</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s others who&rsquo;ll stand on your shoulders.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a giant, beautiful hierarchy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel I sort of covered this middle layer</p>
<p>of the technology stack where it sort of peters out</p>
<p>below the level of NAND gates.</p>
<p>And at the top, I sort of, I lose track</p>
<p>when it gets to machine learning.</p>
<p>And then eventually the machine learning</p>
<p>will build higher and higher layers</p>
<p>that will help us understand the lowest layer</p>
<p>of the physics and thereby the universe figures out</p>
<p>how it itself works.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I mean, if you think of human consciousness,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s even the right concept,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting that sort of,</p>
<p>we have this super parallel brain</p>
<p>that does all these incredible parallel operations</p>
<p>like image recognition.</p>
<p>I recognize your face.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of processing</p>
<p>that goes on in parallel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of nerves between my eyes and my brain</p>
<p>and the brain does a whole bunch of stuff all at once</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually really slow circuits,</p>
<p>but there are many of them that all work together.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when I&rsquo;m speaking,</p>
<p>everything is completely sequential.</p>
<p>I have to sort of string words together one at a time.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m thinking about stuff,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m understanding the world,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking of everything like one step at a time.</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;ve sort of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got all this incredible parallel circuitry</p>
<p>in our brains and eventually we use that</p>
<p>to simulate a single-threaded,</p>
<p>much, much higher level interpreter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly, I mean, that&rsquo;s the illusion of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the illusion of it for us</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a single sequential set of thoughts</p>
<p>and all of that came from a single cell</p>
<p>through the process of embryogenesis.</p>
<p>So, DNA is the code.</p>
<p>DNA holds the entirety of the code,</p>
<p>the information and how to use that information</p>
<p>to build up an organism.</p>
<p>The entire, like, the arms, the legs, the brain.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t buy a computer, you buy like a-</p>
<p>You buy a seed, a diagram.</p>
<p>And then you plant the computer</p>
<p>and it builds itself in almost the same way</p>
<p>and then does the computation</p>
<p>and then eventually dies.</p>
<p>It gets stale but gives birth to young computers</p>
<p>more and more and gives them lessons</p>
<p>but they figure stuff out on their own</p>
<p>and over time, it goes on that way.</p>
<p>And those computers, when they go to college,</p>
<p>try to figure out how to program</p>
<p>and they built their own little computers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re increasingly more intelligent,</p>
<p>increasingly higher and higher levels of abstractions.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that you sort of,</p>
<p>you see the same thing appearing at different levels though</p>
<p>because you have like cells that create new cells</p>
<p>and eventually that builds a whole organism</p>
<p>but then the animal or the plant or the human</p>
<p>has its own mechanism of replication.</p>
<p>That is sort of connected in a very complicated way</p>
<p>to the mechanism of replication of the cells.</p>
<p>And then if you look inside the cell,</p>
<p>if you see how DNA and proteins are connected,</p>
<p>then there is yet another completely different mechanism</p>
<p>whereby proteins are mass produced using enzymes</p>
<p>and a little bit of code from DNA.</p>
<p>And of course, viruses break into it at that level.</p>
<p>And while the mechanisms might be different,</p>
<p>it seems like the nature of the mechanism is the same</p>
<p>and it carries across natural languages</p>
<p>and programming languages, humans,</p>
<p>maybe even human civilizations</p>
<p>or intelligent civilizations</p>
<p>and then all the way down to the single cell organisms.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to see what abstraction levels</p>
<p>are built on top of individual humans</p>
<p>and how you have like whole societies</p>
<p>that sort of have a similar self-preservation,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is, instinct, nature, abstraction</p>
<p>as the individuals have and the cells have.</p>
<p>And they self replicate and breed in different ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for us humans to introspect it</p>
<p>because we were very focused</p>
<p>on our particular layer of abstraction.</p>
<p>But from an alien perspective, looking on Earth,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll probably see the higher level organism</p>
<p>of human civilization as part of this bigger organism</p>
<p>of life on Earth itself.</p>
<p>In fact, that could be an organism just alone,</p>
<p>just life, life, life on Earth.</p>
<p>This has been a wild,</p>
<p>both philosophical and technical conversation,</p>
<p>Guido, you&rsquo;re an amazing human being.</p>
<p>You were gracious enough to talk to me</p>
<p>when I was first doing this podcast</p>
<p>and one of the earliest, first people I&rsquo;ve talked to,</p>
<p>somebody I admired for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a huge honor that you did it at that time</p>
<p>and you do it again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Guido Van Rossum.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde.</p>
<p>Experience is the name that everyone gives</p>
<p>to their mistakes.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
