    <p>I got a counter to the other another billion dollars. I lost. I&rsquo;ve lost two</p>
<p>Two billion dollars in the last two days. Are you guys recording? Please record this looks like</p>
<p>Looks like we need a poker game tomorrow</p>
<p>Imagine how tilted your mouth is gonna go. Yeah</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna buy it for two million just to try and get even</p>
<p>Rain man David</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Hey everybody, hey everybody, welcome to another episode of the all-in podcast. We took a week off and boy that was</p>
<p>Sad, I missed you guys. I missed my best</p>
<p>We should tell we should tell people we had a we had a small medical procedure for one of the besties and but everything&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>And it was planned so, you know, nothing nothing out of the ordinary, but we just needed to take a week off</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we missed a week and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re back. Yes, and one of the besties</p>
<p>God, I got so many jokes. I&rsquo;m not gonna tell all the jokes that came into my mind right now would get you canceled</p>
<p>Based on the amount of money that I&rsquo;ve lost in the last two days, I&rsquo;m ready to get canceled. So it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna fucking let him rip. All right, everybody David Sachs. The rain man is here calling in from an undisclosed</p>
<p>compound my bird</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa back in action and the dictator himself licking his wounds</p>
<p>Check a billion dollars for a billion a day</p>
<p>Checking the apple stock app hitting refresh and going thank god these companies have fundamentals</p>
<p>Because I haven&rsquo;t seen this much blood since game of thrones jason, honestly at the at this run rate. I can lose a trillion dollars</p>
<p>Tomorrow how do you feel today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad</p>
<p>How does today feel compared to last march when the same thing was happening, you know, every day the market was down 10</p>
<p>Well, this is what&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>We made a joke. It was like it could only go down 10 so many days in a row march march</p>
<p>Uh 31st you you guys have to remember that march 31st of 2020 the headlines</p>
<p>All over the press and you can you know, go to the wayback machine and look at these things, but the dow was down</p>
<p>20 some odd percent the s&amp;p was down 20</p>
<p>And it looked like the world was going to end and then we had our first big stimulus bill</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and things started to look at china started to reopen slowly and things started to look better and</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is you have this rotational?</p>
<p>Sort of deleveraging that&rsquo;s happening right now. People are repricing in inflation. People are moving into sort of these</p>
<p>You know overlooked stories getting out of growth a little bit and it&rsquo;s a bloodbath</p>
<p>but I would just I would just encourage us all to remember that</p>
<p>We were in some pretty dark days in march of last year as well</p>
<p>And you know when you looked at it by the end of the year, it looked amazing</p>
<p>So I would just add to that the markets are looking pretty grim for tech stocks right now</p>
<p>But this all started because of a really great jobs report showing that the economy is roaring back. So we added</p>
<p>379 000 jobs in february which beat expectations by 200 000. They also revised the january gains up</p>
<p>166 000. So now the unemployment rate is down to 6.2 percent. Remember it was at like 15</p>
<p>You know last summer during the the lockdowns for covid</p>
<p>So, I mean all of this is fundamentally due to I think really great news in the economy because covid is ending</p>
<p>and which kind of begs the question of why we need another 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus bill, but</p>
<p>but I think that</p>
<p>Ultimately, there&rsquo;s a lot of good news in the real economy and what investors are doing is figuring out how to now price or reprice</p>
<p>All these different stocks in light of the economy roaring back</p>
<p>So just a little just a little math lesson to build on what you&rsquo;re saying, you know, everybody has a risk-free rate</p>
<p>And all stocks are priced according to that risk-free rate</p>
<p>And when you know for the many for the last sort of year particularly when risk-free rates were essentially zero to negative</p>
<p>Meaning, you know, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the riskless money where you that you get from the government</p>
<p>It was hard to do anything except belong growth stocks in a big big way</p>
<p>But david to your point if we get two or three more quarters of these kinds of jobs numbers</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have a you know</p>
<p>low single digit unemployment number and what that means is wages will have to go up for businesses to compete and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind of traditional form of inflation that actually reprices things because</p>
<p>Then you lever up rates to kind of control inflation</p>
<p>When you lever up rates and you you know, all of a sudden they&rsquo;re not zero, but they&rsquo;re two three four five six percent</p>
<p>This is sort of what brought the tech bubble to a halt in 2000, which is that you know</p>
<p>You had six percent real rates. And so you can&rsquo;t own businesses that are projecting revenues let alone profits in 2026</p>
<p>When you can invest your money in a bond and make six percent six percent and that&rsquo;s what I like</p>
<p>So just for folks that don&rsquo;t know this week started with this big bond sell-off</p>
<p>And what that means is bonds that used to yield zero percent when you sell them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now yielding 10-year treasuries. I think are at one and a half points, right?</p>
<p>And so as an investor if I can make one and a half percent with no risk by owning u.s</p>
<p>Treasuries over the next 10 years that may feel like a better bet than owning some risky asset</p>
<p>um some speculative company now</p>
<p>The other thing that that it has done and chamath correct me if i&rsquo;m off on this</p>
<p>But what i&rsquo;m hearing is that that higher rate because bonds sold down because people are expecting inflation to come back up</p>
<p>The interest rates to borrow money are going up</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re a hedge fund or a institutional money manager over the last year or so</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been able to borrow money for zero percent</p>
<p>You can lever up your portfolio and and and buy as many stocks as you want without paying any interest on it</p>
<p>And now that rates are creeping back up people are de-levering they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re taking risk off</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s causing a sell-off in both bonds and stocks</p>
<p>and especially on the speculative end of the market where you know, there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Obviously unchecked kind of investment capital. No, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re absolutely right</p>
<p>Like look at the at the end of the day the cost of borrowing for a company goes up</p>
<p>What that&rsquo;s really saying is the investor that&rsquo;s lending them the money</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>You know has other alternatives</p>
<p>And so then they&rsquo;re willing to charge you more and more for this for this capital and as that happens</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see some companies get into</p>
<p>Potentially some real trouble because you know</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be borrowing money at rates where they can&rsquo;t necessarily generate the cash flows in the future to pay those things back</p>
<p>at the same time as you said if you look at sort of like</p>
<p>You know the SPAC market</p>
<p>Has taken a real beating</p>
<p>What are what are SPACs really well, you know in many ways SPACs are synthetic bonds</p>
<p>right, and and the reason is because</p>
<p>You know if you go and buy a if you go and buy a SPAC one share of any SPAC</p>
<p>You have the ability to redeem that</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the deal that it does and get back your coupon</p>
<p>So, you know your notional rather so if you were to buy a government, you know German bond at negative one percent</p>
<p>Or buy any SPAC where you can put that same, you know, ten dollars to work and get back ten dollars</p>
<p>Well, you do that versus getting back nine dollars and ninety cents</p>
<p>So in many ways like, you know</p>
<p>The SPAC market benefited from rates at zero</p>
<p>Because you could synthetically be long SPACs as almost a way of being synthetically long fixed income</p>
<p>Now as rates go up, that&rsquo;s not true. So what that leaves in the SPAC market are actually people who</p>
<p>Want to own long-term equity</p>
<p>And if you combine that with what we just said</p>
<p>Which is the cost of capital going up and the discount rate going up now</p>
<p>All of a sudden companies need to be really real and you&rsquo;re seeing that because if you look at the companies that have just announced</p>
<p>SPAC deals just in the last few days</p>
<p>Their stocks have gotten absolutely obliterated and they&rsquo;re right on the knife&rsquo;s edge going into the redemption period</p>
<p>So if you have one or two more months of this where all of a sudden bonds look better</p>
<p>And you know some of these SPACs post announcement, but pre-de-SPACing</p>
<p>Go through, you know, ten bucks a share people just redeem for ten dollars</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll have you&rsquo;ll have a bunch of busted IPOs or mergers</p>
<p>By the way, another thing we&rsquo;re seeing sorry Jason</p>
<p>But another thing I think we&rsquo;re seeing right now is in the near term is a feedback loop</p>
<p>So as selling takes place</p>
<p>What happens is market participants are jumping in and short selling and participating in the trend of that stock</p>
<p>And so there are these these kind of experiences that are underway where it&rsquo;s not just about a sell-off of owners</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also about a momentum trade that a lot of people are playing into</p>
<p>And so there is a very short-term extremely compounded effect</p>
<p>Of the de-levering that&rsquo;s happening and the cycling that&rsquo;s happening in these markets</p>
<p>All right, so it&rsquo;s super volatile and probably will be for a little bit of of time here, right?</p>
<p>I think so. I think we need to figure out whether there&rsquo;s really um</p>
<p>Whether there&rsquo;s a real inflation</p>
<p>Risk drag in cooking someplace if if there if there really is inflation like again</p>
<p>You have to think like the trillions of dollars we put into the economy</p>
<p>Eventually has to come out in productive goods and services</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>All of that excess capital will probably inflate prices</p>
<p>Now it begs a different question, which is we maybe we&rsquo;ve just actually been missing inflation all along because if you ask</p>
<p>Somebody who lives in a city, you know</p>
<p>What the cost of rent has been that that thing has been inflating by feels like 20 a year for years</p>
<p>So, you know and education costs and health care</p>
<p>Yeah, so maybe we&rsquo;ve just done a really terrible job in the last few years of actually measuring inflation the way it should be</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s calling this whole basket of you know, you know cpi x energy like I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of nutty</p>
<p>Maybe the whole thing just made no sense a few years ago</p>
<p>To david&rsquo;s point and david gave me just a huge bag of red pills while we were off this week</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;ve been just i&rsquo;ve been on a bender on these red pills</p>
<p>But if you look at those three categories, what do they have in common education health care and housing?</p>
<p>massive regulation</p>
<p>And then if you look at the things that have gone down consumer goods electronics</p>
<p>Food etc or have stayed flat in terms of inflation</p>
<p>Those are things that the free market participates the government&rsquo;s not involved and it&rsquo;s not just the fact there&rsquo;s a lot of government</p>
<p>Regulation in things like health care and education. It&rsquo;s also that the government pays for a significant portion of it</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no reason for the people, you know who are billing the government to keep costs down</p>
<p>I mean, this is why the price of education of a college degree keeps going up is because the government&rsquo;s paying for a lot of it</p>
<p>I I I I david you probably I think you you may have seen this but when you know when we announced um</p>
<p>Our merger with clover for ipoc. One of the first slides I put up there was the only place in the market</p>
<p>Since 2010 where you would have made more money</p>
<p>Than being long facebook and google and apple and amazon was being long united health care</p>
<p>Cigna wellspring and the reason is because health care was this incredible thing post obamacare</p>
<p>Nobody wants to talk about it on the left because it makes it look terrible, but we created</p>
<p>Massive price inflation and united health care was a 30 billion dollar company narrative violation</p>
<p>Be careful right before right before obamacare passed today. It&rsquo;s a 330 billion dollar company</p>
<p>and the level of growth that</p>
<p>They and etna and you know, cigna and wellspring these companies have have seen</p>
<p>Is astounding so these highly regulated, you know systems of societal infrastructure</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s where all the gains have been regulatory capture writ large, right?</p>
<p>Well as soon as the government is paying for it all the suppliers know they can increase their prices</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t they so it&rsquo;s what happens is the government tries to make something free for people and all they end up doing is making</p>
<p>It really expensive</p>
<p>Well, they make it they make it now they make they make it expensive in this very in this very convoluted way</p>
<p>which is hard to track right because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>You know, uh who&rsquo;s actually paying well, you know, the insurance companies want to just book more revenue</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re you know, even if their gross aggregate profit grows much much more slowly</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d rather make the same amount of profit on a billion dollars versus a hundred million dollars</p>
<p>So what do they do their incentive is to just jack prices up who are paying those prices?</p>
<p>Companies pay those prices who bears those costs all of this stuff is really not clear because ultimately downstream</p>
<p>Somebody has to pay for this stuff taxpayers and it&rsquo;s all obscurified. I mean, look, I mean look at the</p>
<p>Tent story that we were sharing on our group group thread</p>
<p>$61,000 for san francisco to put people into tents with a no big contract</p>
<p>one question I have for for you all, um is</p>
<p>If we look back the last time we were at six percent unemployment</p>
<p>July 2014. We look at the unemployment graph. It&rsquo;s spiked up to as we discussed 15</p>
<p>And it has plummeted back down now to uh, the six percent rate</p>
<p>if we look back on this moment in time and how quickly the</p>
<p>Economy is recovering from this disaster that we&rsquo;ve never experienced before. It looks like this recession</p>
<p>is going to be recovered and</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re already back in business in such a short period of time compared to</p>
<p>What happened in the great recession and the dotcom boom?</p>
<p>So is america and the u.s dollar and the economy anti-fragile now to use a taleb term?</p>
<p>What how do we look at what happened with the economy?</p>
<p>Did trump do everything right with the stimulus? This is a this is a complete outlier in the following way in a typical recession</p>
<p>What what has to happen is so you have a contraction in the economy</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t know when the bottom is right?</p>
<p>The bottom is some number of months in the future and government policy is basically trying to create a soft landing</p>
<p>where all of a sudden the cost of capital is low enough now where people say</p>
<p>Uh on the margin now this incremental dollar I would rather borrow and invest which drives growth which then gets the economy growing</p>
<p>And so, you know, how does the government deal with that?</p>
<p>They are looking at economic data and saying, okay, you know what? Let me cut rates. I&rsquo;ll cut rates again</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll cut rates again</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the one tool that they have in their toolbox because they&rsquo;re trying to predict in the future</p>
<p>How many rate cuts do I need to get or have rather? How big do they need to be?</p>
<p>Um until I get to that place where you bottom out</p>
<p>The pandemic was the exact opposite because in many ways we actually hit the bottom in month one because we said everything go to zero</p>
<p>Right now, right when you shut everything down, you technically can&rsquo;t have less economic</p>
<p>Activity than zero. Yeah, and so and so in many ways you price the bottom on day one boom and in hindsight, you know</p>
<p>the the real</p>
<p>Insight would have been to to see that and say i&rsquo;m buying this moment because it only gets better from here</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>In in one ways like all of the tools</p>
<p>Are are actually now we need to think about them in opposite and I don&rsquo;t think we have</p>
<p>That training to do that well, so we&rsquo;re still going back to the same toolbox, which is why what david said is so true</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re thinking about incremental stimulus</p>
<p>As a as like a way to get to a soft landing, but we&rsquo;ve already actually taken the hard medicine a year ago</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s tackle that sacks. Should we and let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s take virtue signaling and populism out of this discussion just on an economic basis</p>
<p>Is it necessary to send every american another six hundred thousand two thousand knowing what we know today?</p>
<p>With the unemployment rate going down. We would be read or we&rsquo;d be better off taking that capital and deploying it in</p>
<p>education</p>
<p>Right unemployment or something else. Well, first of all, it&rsquo;s 1.9 trillion that we don&rsquo;t have we&rsquo;re borrowing it</p>
<p>I mean, I would extend unemployment for people in those hard-hit sectors haven&rsquo;t come back yet</p>
<p>But most of this money is going for blue state bailouts of cities that are totally mismanaged</p>
<p>This is not going to help states like california or cities like san francisco get their house in order</p>
<p>Because this is going to bail them out and defer that day of reckoning from their chronic mismanagement</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re borrowing money. We don&rsquo;t have to bail out people</p>
<p>cities and states that don&rsquo;t really deserve it, um, I do think we should help the people who&rsquo;ve been impacted but</p>
<p>um, but it doesn&rsquo;t require two trillion and</p>
<p>Look, here&rsquo;s the thing. We&rsquo;re already down to six percent unemployment</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be down to i&rsquo;d say probably three or four percent in two quarters</p>
<p>I mean the economy is coming roaring back and the reason it&rsquo;s coming roaring back is because covet is ending</p>
<p>Right. So the biggest announcement recently and I think this is playing into what&rsquo;s happening in the stock market as well</p>
<p>Is that biden?</p>
<p>Announced that every american who&rsquo;s over the age of 16 who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by the end of may</p>
<p>By the end of may I mean we&rsquo;re gonna have yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, right well he was</p>
<p>Just yeah when he came in office in january, he&rsquo;s saying the worst is not over blah</p>
<p>I mean that was clearly sandbagging the worst was over</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have 300 million doses by end of may and the only reason why everybody won&rsquo;t be able to get one is because</p>
<p>of states that are</p>
<p>You know creating these ridiculous hoops to get through confiscating them</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly</p>
<p>like california right now has three million doses sitting on a shelf because of all the crazy hoops that</p>
<p>Gavin newsom has everyone going through because he wants to score</p>
<p>Browning points on equity, right? Um</p>
<p>So if the government would just get out of the way let everyone who wants to get a vaccine get one without</p>
<p>Worrying about making sure the exact right person in the exact right line gets one first</p>
<p>This thing will be over by memorial day over now</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;ll still be a case here or there for sure</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be i&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;ll be zero cases of covid but there&rsquo;ll be zero pandemic understood as such</p>
<p>By the way, i&rsquo;ll also say one other. Um</p>
<p>You know important point about the stimulus, uh one that sacks made yesterday</p>
<p>The cbo put out a a projection. Uh, this is the um, the budget office, uh, I think congress and they said that the um,</p>
<p>U.s. National debt is likely to reach 202</p>
<p>of gdp</p>
<p>by 2051</p>
<p>So the amount of debt that the u.s. Government will own</p>
<p>Um is 2x the amount of all the revenue generated by all of the industries in the u.s. Um</p>
<p>Oh in about 30 years, that&rsquo;s an insane statistic and the reason that people look at you know</p>
<p>Gdp or debt to gdp</p>
<p>Is because you have to pay your debt down at some points you owe some interest on that debt</p>
<p>You have to pay it down and every year you have to generate revenue to pay the bond holders</p>
<p>And how do you how does the federal government generate revenue it either issues more debt or taxes?</p>
<p>And in order to meet a 202 percent level of debt relative to gdp you end up raising taxes</p>
<p>so significantly as a percent of gdp to cover the uh,</p>
<p>The uh, the interest payments and the and the principal payments every year that you end up stalling out the economy cutting important services, etc</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re in a circumstance now where the the benefit we&rsquo;re going to get from taking on this additional debt relative to economic growth</p>
<p>and stimulus</p>
<p>um doesn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>Outweigh the cost of that debt and we&rsquo;re facing a fiscal crunch at some point in the next decade or two</p>
<p>And there is this this big question mark outstanding right now</p>
<p>On a global stage is the dollar really the safest place?</p>
<p>Um to be does everyone really want to be dollar denominated if this is the circumstance that the u.s</p>
<p>Federal government is going to be facing</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a uh question for chamath that i&rsquo;m curious about if the government is buying all this debt</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t they be buying some amount of equity as well so they can profit from the government&rsquo;s issuing debt jason</p>
<p>No, I know but isn&rsquo;t the government also going into the market and buying up corporate debt through all of this</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t they have profits coming from that?</p>
<p>So there there was a risk last year where you know corporates may not have been able to fund their obligations</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>the government basically said we&rsquo;re going to be the buyer of the last resort and step in and it&rsquo;s like effectively what they did was</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>They they essentially froze the credit markets because if you were going to then</p>
<p>Bet on some of these companies not being able to raise capital</p>
<p>You would have gone to the worst part of the you know</p>
<p>The stack or you would have bet actually that there was going to be the state transition</p>
<p>so meaning debt is very tightly scripted as you know, triple a plus, you know, double a a minus</p>
<p>And these transitions from these tiers of like investment grade to junk to whatever are huge events</p>
<p>And basically the government said nope</p>
<p>Uh, everybody take your chips and go home because we are going to backstop companies like ford or whoever folks that were teetering</p>
<p>And so they effectively said this is going to be you know, until I tell you otherwise a rigged game</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make sure I backstop these things. These companies will always be able to have money</p>
<p>So my question though chamath is if the government is going to do that and take that risk</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t they get some warrants or some upside in the company&rsquo;s future success?</p>
<p>To then create a virtuous cycle here that if they did backstop it</p>
<p>Maybe they had warrants for five percent of the company</p>
<p>Like you would give if you were doing a debt instrument</p>
<p>They could probably do it if they were a direct lender and they they had that chance</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t really do it in 2008 when they did it</p>
<p>And I mean, maybe they could have done it in a better way here when you enter the open market</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such contract and so you can&rsquo;t negotiate that look</p>
<p>I I want to sort of talk about something slightly related to this which is</p>
<p>If you actually looked at that 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus bill</p>
<p>The thing that makes the most sense and I think nobody would complain about was saying let&rsquo;s give a means-based test</p>
<p>Where the poorest americans get the most money call it five or six thousand and the richest americans get nothing</p>
<p>And I think nobody would disagree with that</p>
<p>And if you added up all of that money, it&rsquo;s probably on the order of 500 or 700 billion dollars</p>
<p>If you did it if you did a really expansive package and and I think people would</p>
<p>I mean all of us would raise our hands and say we shouldn&rsquo;t get a fucking dime</p>
<p>And I mean, you know people other people should be getting many multiples of 1400</p>
<p>Why should anybody who wasn&rsquo;t impacted sax get anything like if you were not impacted, yeah, of course, you didn&rsquo;t lose your job</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re staying home. You&rsquo;re not spending money</p>
<p>Why should you get anything because I think that&rsquo;s all the money going into nfts</p>
<p>And making bets on game stop and doing all this, of course, you know shenanigans with bitcoin, of course</p>
<p>Look, this is rama manual 2.0. Remember rama manual back in the 2008</p>
<p>2009 financial crisis said never let a crisis go to waste this is now never let a crisis reach its end</p>
<p>Right, they don&rsquo;t want it to be over because this crisis is a justification</p>
<p>Yeah, this crisis is the justification</p>
<p>For this piggy bank of spending that this this wish list that they wanted to pass for a long time</p>
<p>Very little of it actually has to do with helping the very little very little</p>
<p>In fact, if you actually look at the the breakdown of this 1.9 trillion dollar bill, it&rsquo;s every typical bill</p>
<p>It has a better title, but ultimately it&rsquo;s a bunch of pork barrels, by the way</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of insanity in there like covid testing</p>
<p>I mean, guess what? We don&rsquo;t need to test anyone for covid in about 30 to 60 days</p>
<p>Test away. We needed them a couple billion dollars. We could say, you know, and the list goes on but I think the point is</p>
<p>Uh, what sax is making is totally true</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to latch on to the covid pandemic crisis as a means to an end</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not really solving any problems that are outstanding as the covid pandemic</p>
<p>And the risks remember let&rsquo;s just go back a year</p>
<p>If you guys remember the reason we shut down the economy was to flatten the curve</p>
<p>There was no assumption. We were going to end covid</p>
<p>The idea was let&rsquo;s make sure that the health care system doesn&rsquo;t get overwhelmed with people dying</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t handle as many people in icu beds</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re in a situation where we&rsquo;re saying you still can&rsquo;t go outside. I see you beds are largely open</p>
<p>You still have to do x and y and z we still need to be testing everyone</p>
<p>And all of those risks and considerations should be coming off the table</p>
<p>As more people have had covid and more people have gotten vaccinated</p>
<p>And instead we&rsquo;re using the fear that&rsquo;s been embedded in us over the past year</p>
<p>As a mechanism to drive spending in a way that is clearly economically unsustainable</p>
<p>um ultimately counterproductive</p>
<p>And unfortunately is being you know used as a mechanism for keeping folks in office and paying back their friends and all this other sort</p>
<p>Of nonsense. It&rsquo;s freeberg. You had a you had a breakdown of uh, it by the way</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not just the the federal stimulus bill, you know, the the california breakdown of what they spent sane</p>
<p>Do you have that? Do you have that?</p>
<p>Can you fill it out?</p>
<p>What i&rsquo;m going to do is i&rsquo;m going to send the link because it was a through a foyer request</p>
<p>They were forced to list it. So california had an emergency declaration joke a total fucking joke</p>
<p>Through that emergency declaration</p>
<p>It gave the governor the power and the ability to enter into no-bid contracts to meet the the demands of the quote-unquote emergency</p>
<p>And the contracts that were entered into are all publicly listed and available in a link that I will share with you guys</p>
<p>Um, and it&rsquo;ll be available online</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a reporter has done what needs to be done</p>
<p>Which is to go through those contracts and identify how much money was spent</p>
<p>On what and where that and why that money was spent and who ended up benefiting from it some of these contracts including for example</p>
<p>1.9 billion dollars to perkin elmer to provide nasal swabs and other, you know</p>
<p>Reactive chemistry needed to run covet tests with an overflow capacity of their lab of 4 000 tests a day</p>
<p>Which by the way costs a few thousand dollars</p>
<p>Um for 1.9 billion dollars and ultimately california didn&rsquo;t really do any of the testing it was done by private labs</p>
<p>Where did that 1.9 billion dollars go? There was another amount of money</p>
<p>There was 100 million dollars spent on accenture to build the vaccination website</p>
<p>No bid contract 100 million dollars for a freaking three-page website in a weekend</p>
<p>There was the carbon health guy did there was another um separately for his own vaccination program that he was running which you know</p>
<p>Obviously highlights just how inept this whole process is there was another</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>incredible multi-hundred million dollar contract entered into</p>
<p>For a guy and then I looked up his address on google maps and I looked at his home in his office</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in like a strip mall next to a donut shop</p>
<p>And this guy is the guy he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s technically a doctor</p>
<p>But not really a practicing doctor who would who got paid hundreds of millions of dollars to source overflow?</p>
<p>um hospital and doctor capacity for prisons in the in california insane the shit that&rsquo;s in there and so um,</p>
<p>You know the the total kind of um, I think mismanagement of capital</p>
<p>And obviously inability to kind of manage through a crisis get taken advantage of yeah</p>
<p>By the way, I think I think the covid the fiscal the federal covid stimulus looks very similar</p>
<p>In terms of the the pork and other nonsense that&rsquo;s going on in there</p>
<p>It makes yeah, hey mainstream media instead of fucking grinding me about you know</p>
<p>A couple hundred million dollars of share sales so that I can allocate it to fucking climate change</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you do your goddamn job and fucking tell this story?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, because this would take work. You don&rsquo;t get virtual signaling. What&rsquo;s a joke? I&rsquo;ll post the link now more</p>
<p>I need more red pills. What a joke get me those red pills from miami</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one there&rsquo;s one article like you&rsquo;re right chamath like they there&rsquo;s so many scandals</p>
<p>By the way, there was one just reported in the san francisco chronicle about how the city of san francisco paid 16 million dollars</p>
<p>to uh</p>
<p>To pay for something like 260 tents or something like that</p>
<p>Tents for homeless people. It was the entire budget of burning man</p>
<p>You just it was</p>
<p>$61,000 per tent you could build an adu for that guys</p>
<p>I have an entire gaggle of reporters sweating every single fucking share that I buy or sell and these people</p>
<p>No, no, I don&rsquo;t this is it&rsquo;s fucking stupid and and and there&rsquo;s true. There&rsquo;s trillions of dollars just swashing around like</p>
<p>Whoa, are we some third world fucking banana republic?</p>
<p>Kind of go ahead san francisco is that all all this money all this money all this money was dished out according to no bid</p>
<p>Uh contract so so basically there was not a competitive bidding process because it was a covet emergency</p>
<p>And so yeah, look, I mean all of uh, newsome&rsquo;s big backers in the healthcare industry got these giant no bid contracts</p>
<p>These you know, the homeless industrial complex service providers in san francisco got these giant contracts. None of it was bid out</p>
<p>Uh, and the politicians would love to be able to keep this going because they&rsquo;ve never had more power</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never had more degrees of freedom to reward their political supporters</p>
<p>So, you know, I think there was one really good article. I just want to bring up here</p>
<p>Uh that was by jonathan chait. Oh, this is the intelligence here in the new yorker</p>
<p>Yeah, the new york new york magazine and why in new york magazine</p>
<p>So yeah, his article is called zero covid risk is the wrong standard and he defines a term called zeroism</p>
<p>What what chait writes is he describes zeroism as the following?</p>
<p>He says zeroism is an inability to conceive of public health measures in cost benefit terms</p>
<p>The pandemic becomes an enemy that must be destroyed at all costs</p>
<p>And any compromise could lead to death and is therefore unacceptable</p>
<p>So in other words if like one person might die, then we need to continue all these emergency measures</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s and and and this is the thing is that look covid as a pandemic is going to be over by june</p>
<p>Okay, but there will always be cases of covid</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to return as a seasonal illness</p>
<p>And the question is are we going to allow zeroism to be the policy every year?</p>
<p>We basically give these politicians unlimited power to do lockdown shutdowns</p>
<p>No big contracts and on and on and on you already see with the teachers unions, right?</p>
<p>The education unions are refusing to go back to work even after their members are vaccinated</p>
<p>Yeah saying that there must be 14 days of no meaning zero community spread before they can safely return</p>
<p>So the teachers unions or the education users are saying is we&rsquo;re not going to go back to work</p>
<p>We want paid vacation until there&rsquo;s zero cases. Well, this is not realistic. I mean I I um</p>
<p>I went to get uh</p>
<p>My daughter&rsquo;s passport updated at usps</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working while I was driving there. I saw all kinds of infrastructure. It was happening</p>
<p>We pay into a system</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s supposed to guarantee in return</p>
<p>Some level of commitment by individuals that buy into that same system teachers are part of that</p>
<p>Yes, you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t have a get out of jail free card whenever you want to just say no</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to change the rules</p>
<p>And it but it applies to everybody else the firefighters have to show up</p>
<p>The cops have to show up the ambulance people have to show up the nurses show up, you know, the usps drivers bart</p>
<p>Everybody doctor shows up going to work, but these people fucking teachers the teachers should</p>
<p>Parents should take their kids out of school. That&rsquo;s what they should do. And then do what jason?</p>
<p>How how how are most you basically?</p>
<p>Well, if you have six parents people work, yeah, no, no</p>
<p>But if you got five or six parents together and they don&rsquo;t have time for that jason</p>
<p>What are you talking about? This is like a fucking normal my sentence five or six parents get together and if they had</p>
<p>If they had um, what do you call it? When you give parents a little bit of money for school? Uh,</p>
<p>Voucher voucher systems the voucher system would then create the competition if six or seven families could get five 10k each</p>
<p>And then run their own little bubble school their micro school. This could actually put pressure</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not gonna it&rsquo;s not gonna happen, but you actually have a pretty good point</p>
<p>What what newsom should do is he should go to these unions and say listen</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not going to go back and you&rsquo;re not going to teach no problem</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to take the money that we give to your schools and give them out as vouchers</p>
<p>And let the parents do what they want. In other words, we&rsquo;re going to break your union</p>
<p>That is what he needs to do. It&rsquo;s time to break the union newsom</p>
<p>The problem with newsom is that his biggest contributor</p>
<p>The single biggest contributor is the education union, right?</p>
<p>And so look he has publicly said that yes i&rsquo;m in favor of schools reopening</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not enough for you to espouse the opinion that schools should go back</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re the governor you need to go make that happen. You need to go tell the teachers unions</p>
<p>You must go back right now because there is no incremental covid risk to the teachers</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen this now that states which have open schools have not seen an increase in covid</p>
<p>There is no science to support this</p>
<p>He needs to tell him go back right now or we&rsquo;re going to break your union</p>
<p>He will not do that because he&rsquo;s an employee of those unions</p>
<p>And by the way, I have an update. I have an update on the on the recall if you guys want it</p>
<p>No, wait, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s get to it in one second because I do want to I do want to just say</p>
<p>Um, well, first off I want to make an observation that we are um turning into the rational rush limbaugh</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all kind of yelling</p>
<p>violent</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a little bit silly, um, but uh, I am just observing the tone here a little bit</p>
<p>Um, I will say like if you guys remember we talked about this like last year</p>
<p>Which is you know</p>
<p>What will life be like post covid post the pandemic and if you guys remember I said this</p>
<p>And I still firmly believe in I think we&rsquo;re now seeing it play out</p>
<p>Which is that the fear that gets created by the actual crisis</p>
<p>Will persist in terms of the subconscious behavior of the population for a long period of time</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened after 9 11, you know</p>
<p>The insanity that went on with the tsa and security checking and racism against brown people and everything that arose post 9 11</p>
<p>Persisted for a very long time as a result of the shock that we all experienced</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think people were very cognizant of it occurring. It was just like oh well</p>
<p>This is now the normal way of life</p>
<p>Everyone is so fearful of catching covid and they&rsquo;ve been so kind of trained and told that they&rsquo;re going to die from covid</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re finding ourselves in a circumstance</p>
<p>Where anything can then be rationalized and those of folks that then have power and the ability can magnify</p>
<p>The circumstances into something that it seems kind of shocking and absurd if you put on kind of a rational hat</p>
<p>But this is just one manifestation of what I think will be the case. We were um</p>
<p>We we all know people that have been vaccinated that are more than two weeks since their second shot of vaccination</p>
<p>Who are still scared of doing things like being around other people or going into grocery stores?</p>
<p>Because quote unquote there may be a chance that there may be a variant that may not work on the vaccine that I may get</p>
<p>That may end up killing me and if you actually do the math on it, you think about it rationally</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get covid and you&rsquo;re not going to die, but there&rsquo;s a chance therefore</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to change my behavior and that&rsquo;s part of what I think we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>Manifest at a very large scale is this like trained fear mind that we all have at this point</p>
<p>um and policy and everything and by the yeah, no, by the way, the 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus is in part kind of</p>
<p>Empowered by this fear. Well, we all I I I I I disagree slightly. So look, is there going to be some ptsd from covid?</p>
<p>Yeah, i&rsquo;m sure there will be but I think people are ready to to get out and</p>
<p>um with a vengeance and I think people want and and the problem</p>
<p>Is not that people are are afraid but that the people doing the health establishment doing the messaging</p>
<p>Is not out there telling us the right things</p>
<p>I mean you&rsquo;ve got fauci out there telling people that even after they&rsquo;re vaccinated</p>
<p>They cannot take off their masks until 2022 that they&rsquo;re not gonna be able to die. No, seriously</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be able to dine indoors</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t go to a movie a concert or a sporting event and they can&rsquo;t socialize indoors except with other also vaccinated people</p>
<p>This is what fauci is saying. I mean so</p>
<p>No wonder you&rsquo;ve got so many people out there saying that they&rsquo;re gonna wait and see whether the vaccine works or not. Well</p>
<p>Because effectively fauci in the health establishment they&rsquo;re being so cautious in their guidance are effectively giving anti-vax messaging</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically saying that the vaccines don&rsquo;t work very well, which is just stupid</p>
<p>I mean, I mean they should be going out saying nobody has died who has been gotten a shot</p>
<p>Nobody has gone to the icu who&rsquo;s gotten vaccinated to say nobody&rsquo;s been on a ventilator who&rsquo;s been vaccinated</p>
<p>Am I correct with those three statements? Yes. Yes. They need to say if you know that&rsquo;s no icu no</p>
<p>Ventilator if you have the shot</p>
<p>What we need to be saying is very simple</p>
<p>Which is if you&rsquo;ve been vaccinated you will not die</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been vaccinated you will not die put that on a billboard and everyone&rsquo;s going to want to get vaccinated</p>
<p>You know only 55 in the population right now</p>
<p>Uh says that they&rsquo;re going to get vaccinated as soon as they can</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, i&rsquo;m ordering a billboard right now from the besties. I think that just says if you&rsquo;re vaccinated you won&rsquo;t die the besties</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty reasonable that individuals would still be afraid</p>
<p>You know because I think we learned over the last year that we can&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>The institutions that are supposed to tell us</p>
<p>In an objective way meaning you can&rsquo;t trust the who you can&rsquo;t trust nih. You can&rsquo;t trust the cdc</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t necessarily trust the surgeon general. You couldn&rsquo;t trust the president</p>
<p>Very complicated, right? So I think it&rsquo;s reasonable that people are skeptical</p>
<p>What I think is unreasonable is when you know sort of like organized</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Unions or organizations or corporations who have a responsibility to run the infrastructure of this country</p>
<p>basically say um</p>
<p>All these rules apply to everybody else but me</p>
<p>Um, that&rsquo;s where I think uh, we have to really just kind of question ourselves and fix that that&rsquo;s not cool</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fundamentally not reasonable</p>
<p>So we have biden saying that everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by the end of may we have gavin</p>
<p>Newsom saying that most of the state but not all of it will reopen in august. Well, wait a second, you know</p>
<p>May june july august why is there like a three-month gap here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of of the zeroism. I mean, I think newsom has embraced the zeroism if not zeroism</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the number we have 8 000 people die a day in america?</p>
<p>Uh on average historically as soon as everyone if it&rsquo;s under 500 deaths a day, should we be going back?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even the question. That&rsquo;s not even the question once everyone can get a vaccine</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over if you choose not to get the vaccine</p>
<p>Like sorry, it&rsquo;s on you. We&rsquo;re moving on. It&rsquo;s like dude, we&rsquo;re gonna ask</p>
<p>By the way</p>
<p>The equivalent of zeroism would be no one&rsquo;s allowed to drive a car because people die</p>
<p>Dyes it dying cars all the time cars have to be 35 miles an hour or they or you or yeah</p>
<p>Or no one&rsquo;s allowed to drink alcohol because alcohol has some adverse effect or increase its chance of of cancer or whatever or whatever</p>
<p>At some point like do you end up you just triggered chamath? No, sorry</p>
<p>No wine nice bordeaux and burgundy doesn&rsquo;t give you cancer what&rsquo;s going on with the wine budget post spackocalypse</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s gonna take a lot of it&rsquo;s gonna take a lot of more billions before I stop drinking my wine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Question. Um, I want to throw this into the scrum</p>
<p>Um, what do you guys think about?</p>
<p>Uh, by the way, I mean also we&rsquo;re all just so punchy because we didn&rsquo;t talk last week. So</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all so agitated</p>
<p>All of our wives have been telling us what to do</p>
<p>We had nobody to vent with and now we&rsquo;re just going crazy. It&rsquo;s like a bunch of 12 year old boys who are on timeout</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;ve been in a two-week time</p>
<p>We need to get our bikes and go for a bike ride</p>
<p>No, no guys, honestly, honestly</p>
<p>Like have you guys like I have not gotten a word in edgewise with matt for two weeks</p>
<p>And I was so looking forward to talking to you guys. I&rsquo;m like, I want to talk</p>
<p>um, no, but listen, uh, no guys, what do you guys think about the uh, the the biological patriot act thing, you know</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s these vaccination passports that people are talking about. I just want to get a sense of</p>
<p>where you guys think this is going and</p>
<p>This is the slippery slope that I think ends all slippery slopes with respect to privacy, right?</p>
<p>So I think it was proposed in the eu</p>
<p>That you would need to get a you know</p>
<p>A digitally verified kind of passport stamp that shows that you have been vaccinated in order to travel freely amongst other eu nations</p>
<p>And so if you think about the implications of this</p>
<p>Now the government or governments have the ability to demand that in order for you to move around freely</p>
<p>You need to represent something digitally or represent something about some health care procedure that you may or may not want to kind of</p>
<p>Uh, you know take on so that sound everyone kind of nods their head and says that seems totally reasonable and rational</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s covet. We&rsquo;re all at risk. We should protect ourselves</p>
<p>I want to yada yada, but where does this go next right because then it becomes well</p>
<p>Have you had your measles vaccine or you know?</p>
<p>Hey, you know, do you have um herpes and therefore you can&rsquo;t you have to show someone your herpes passport if you want to have</p>
<p>sex with them or you know end up kind of going to a point where</p>
<p>We we really don&rsquo;t have a barrier between what&rsquo;s private and what&rsquo;s nationalized</p>
<p>Um, or even super nationalized in the context of the eu</p>
<p>Um, and you know, is there kind of a slippery slope that emerges by allowing this amount of invasiveness of personal decision-making and personal data?</p>
<p>And making it available to government agencies in order to have access to the liberties that you you know</p>
<p>Believe may be endowed to you as an individual citizen</p>
<p>Of the world. So what do you do? What do we do?</p>
<p>Well, I I just think proposals like this are I think they&rsquo;re going to fade away very quickly once covet is over</p>
<p>and and the real issue we have right now is that not enough the population wants to get vaccinated because</p>
<p>Again, the health authorities are being much too conservative in their guidance</p>
<p>So I you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some polling numbers on this that</p>
<p>So only 15 of the public are actually opposed to getting the vaccine like you kind of call them anti-vax</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another 20 to 30 that are taking this wait and see approach</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to make sure that like other people go first and</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sprout tails or antlers or something before you know, they&rsquo;re going to be willing to get it</p>
<p>but but the reason why they&rsquo;re all waiting and seeing is because</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got you know, falchi and others saying that we&rsquo;re not gonna have normalcy</p>
<p>Until christmas or maybe even 2022</p>
<p>So if if that&rsquo;s the case if things aren&rsquo;t going to be normal till next year</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t you wait, you know?</p>
<p>And I think what we need to be saying is look go get the vaccine</p>
<p>Where everyone who wants us to be able to get it in the next two months and covid is over it&rsquo;s over guys</p>
<p>But sax if there is a digital passport requirement in the eu, where do you think that goes?</p>
<p>Like if you have to show proof of a vaccination in order to enter the eu without quarantine</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a great precedent</p>
<p>But I but I I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s going to be necessary because I just think that covid&rsquo;s going to end</p>
<p>There is a so so quickly</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a this I like sax&rsquo;s point of view</p>
<p>Which is if you decide you&rsquo;re not going to do this, then you&rsquo;ve put yourself at risk</p>
<p>But if nobody else can die from it, why do we need to check it?</p>
<p>I understand like maybe in this bridge period</p>
<p>Spring to summer if you go to a warriors game or a nix game where you want to go to burning man or the edc</p>
<p>You know electronic daisy carnival, whatever</p>
<p>Uh freeberg goes to you know, uh when he goes to his raves</p>
<p>I mean freeberg at a rave is kind of the video we need to see I think</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Why would that&rsquo;s fine with me in the short term, but in the long term, I don&rsquo;t want to give them that power</p>
<p>Look what happened with the patriot act and then them monitoring our data forever and the government being able to put</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>What snow didn&rsquo;t found out like they were able to put on the at&amp;t backbone the ability to sniff all data. I mean</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s overreaching</p>
<p>last january, uh or february, I think jason it was one of our first pods where</p>
<p>I kind of put this marker out there on this biological patriarch and I said it&rsquo;s coming i&rsquo;m going to put another</p>
<p>marker out there, um</p>
<p>By the way, because like, you know</p>
<p>There may be something like this in new york. I think most cities will have to have them</p>
<p>I think places jason exactly as you say for sporting events for concerts. It&rsquo;ll be very hard</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>As the number of strains increase as the severity ebbs and flows over time</p>
<p>For us to not end up in this place and I think it will be because</p>
<p>Certain people will feel a paternalistic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Desire to sort of you know, it&rsquo;ll come from a good place</p>
<p>Like I want to help everybody but they&rsquo;ll pass a law and that law will just get perturbed and and it&rsquo;ll create all kinds of</p>
<p>Crazy consequences, but I want to put another shit out there</p>
<p>Which is you know, there was a really important civil rights case called masterpiece cake shop versus colorado</p>
<p>uh civil rights commission</p>
<p>Who went to the supreme court and it was basically a a guy who owned um</p>
<p>A bakery and he refused I think it was to make a cake for a same-sex couple</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And ultimately, you know, the decision was yeah</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s allowed the supreme court gave a very narrow ruling that he was allowed to withhold service</p>
<p>And I asked this question which is well, what is the difference?</p>
<p>Um, frankly between withholding service from a same-sex couple or withholding service from somebody that isn&rsquo;t vaccinated</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Because you know in the eyes of the business person</p>
<p>You know assuming apparently you&rsquo;re allowed to make these kinds of you know judgments</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re a private business the implications I think are really vast. Um, and so i&rsquo;m just going to put it out there that I think that</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s actually david i&rsquo;ll take the other side</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s going to be these biological patriot acts, unfortunately</p>
<p>And then the second thing that i&rsquo;ll say is that I do think that it will get litigated to the supreme court</p>
<p>And I think that narrowly</p>
<p>What will come down is that businesses will be able to decide and I think this is actually what will put the vaccination</p>
<p>or anti-vaccination movement</p>
<p>to the forefront because I think in this complex global world</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know where diseases</p>
<p>come from</p>
<p>Except we know that they are more communicable</p>
<p>They can be more deadly and they&rsquo;re more pervasive and they spread faster just because of the nature in which the world is set up</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna there&rsquo;s probably going to be less and less tolerance for anti-vaccination</p>
<p>Now that may slow down</p>
<p>the actual process of getting vaccines to market</p>
<p>um, because we&rsquo;ll want to make it even safer if we&rsquo;re going to do forced vaccinations of certain things, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, just going to put a put a check out there that I think that that&rsquo;s well</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we need to force people to get vaccinated</p>
<p>But I think that we need to recognize that once people have the option of getting vaccinated. There&rsquo;s no need to</p>
<p>Have the same public policy response, right?</p>
<p>So so look if biden&rsquo;s correct that we&rsquo;re gonna have 300 million doses by end of may and I think he must be correct</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s been very conservative in his guidance</p>
<p>Then we should declare a date certain for the end of covid. I&rsquo;m not saying that the virus won&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying there won&rsquo;t be a smattering of cases. I&rsquo;m saying from a public policy perspective</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no longer a panic a raging pandemic to justify these incredible new powers that the government has asserted</p>
<p>I mean, what would you do that based on the number of shots in arms or the number of deaths per day?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s look once</p>
<p>Once everyone can get the vaccine and then I think that will be so</p>
<p>Availability so I mean look what we should and it will be available as long as you know</p>
<p>Governors like newsom get out of the way and stop restricting the administration of it</p>
<p>But I think we need to declare a date certain where we say listen on june 1st</p>
<p>There is no more justification for government having these extraordinary powers to lock us down to require us</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t think we even need to wear masks beyond june 1st</p>
<p>And by the way, I was pro mass. I was in favor of a mass mandate a year ago as you guys know</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no need for it after june 1st. There&rsquo;s no need to have these. Um,</p>
<p>Crazy, not if you&rsquo;re vaccinated, right freeberg like I mean</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I I it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I I just um, you know, I think it&rsquo;s uh,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good point that sax is making it&rsquo;s easy for people</p>
<p>to say let&rsquo;s wear a mask and protect ourselves, but</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t care about wearing a mask, but there are plenty of people who do and I I think the question is at</p>
<p>What point do we allow liberty to kind of play a role here?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not just about you know</p>
<p>What one person&rsquo;s point of view which by the way turned out to be wrong multiple times over the last year</p>
<p>Um is uh in terms of what they think that other people should do and you know</p>
<p>What what is what does it mean to actually have freedom of choice and liberty?</p>
<p>Um, I mean it&rsquo;s a really it&rsquo;s a really fundamental question. Yeah</p>
<p>Well, I mean if you look at states</p>
<p>That is a key we have texas has opened up and said no mass mandate</p>
<p>One of the things that hurt us in this was we didn&rsquo;t have a centralized government dictating everything</p>
<p>And now we see like hey, maybe okay, so by the way, by the way, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s necessarily true</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say something about this that I think is important</p>
<p>It may be true that masks stop community spread of the virus</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that we stop the spread of the virus</p>
<p>The virus still spread we still had a lot of viral cases in the united states</p>
<p>We had a lot of deaths that arose and whatever restrictions we put in place</p>
<p>People still made the choice to go into other people&rsquo;s homes take their mask off</p>
<p>Enjoy free air enjoy drinks and give each other the virus and that&rsquo;s where so much of the spread occurred. I think you guys are not</p>
<p>Confronting this really obvious thing. I think like this masterpiece cake shop thing is a really important concept</p>
<p>Like what happens i&rsquo;m just going to use an extreme example if it goes to the supreme court you mean</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s just say that you know, google&rsquo;s engineers unionize and they decide that you know</p>
<p>They want everybody else at google to be vaccinated</p>
<p>And then google says yeah, you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>If you want to work at google, you need to be vaccinated not just private company private not just for covet</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a private company</p>
<p>By the way, that is a rule at schools, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think my my uh, my preschool where my kid goes here in san francisco requires</p>
<p>proof of vaccination for the kids in order for them to go traveling seems to be different and see traveling in some places is</p>
<p>On wait, just public infrastructure some on private infrastructure. I know but just just just focus on this issue</p>
<p>What happens if private organizations pass a decision?</p>
<p>Yeah that you have to be vaccinated. It&rsquo;ll go to the supreme court. And if you look at masterpiece</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll win they will be they will they will come out with the right to say that</p>
<p>Which is fine</p>
<p>You can go work somewhere. Why is that? Why is that a problem? Exactly? Yeah, i&rsquo;m just curious</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all in agreement if only half the population of america</p>
<p>Well, maybe they&rsquo;ll lose good engineers and the free market will resolve itself where google will end up saying you know</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re not going to pass this mandate because all the good engineers are going to leave</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just leave it, you know, leave it be</p>
<p>Um, i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m more worried about the politicians trying to hold the government trying to hold on to the power</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s asserted over us over the past year even after covid. So that&rsquo;s my concern</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them having a database of my medical records. No, right</p>
<p>And so this is why look I think we need to declare a date servant</p>
<p>Certain that covid as a pandemic is over. My date is memorial day</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear to me that once everyone has the vaccine, it&rsquo;s over. Just make it when you can walk up</p>
<p>This is when yeah, this is what so I actually think that the newsome recall which will be in will be going on this summer</p>
<p>Uh, this is what that election is going to turn into in my opinion is so so by the way quick</p>
<p>Can I give a quick update on yes, please? Okay, so</p>
<p>I talked to the recall, uh people this morning. They&rsquo;re up to 1.95</p>
<p>Million signatures he&rsquo;s done. So 50 000 votes short of 2 million</p>
<p>They will be at or over 2 million in two weeks, which is the end of the signature period</p>
<p>Their validation rate is about 84</p>
<p>So I think this is clearly going to pass there will be a recall election</p>
<p>It will be around august now fast forward newsome has said the state won&rsquo;t reopen until august</p>
<p>But I think that by may june july you will see just about every other state reopen</p>
<p>Obviously texas already completely reopened but even blue states like connecticut have now lifted lockdowns</p>
<p>They still have a mask mandate for the time being</p>
<p>But I think what you could see by this summer is that california will look like a laggard</p>
<p>You will see that politicians like newsome are holding on to the zeroist philosophy</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re being too restrictive</p>
<p>They look ridiculous compared to other states and he still probably won&rsquo;t have an agreement with the teachers unions</p>
<p>To go back to school</p>
<p>And I think this could become the big issue in the in the recall. You want to make an announcement sax?</p>
<p>You want to make an announcement now? We have a special announcement</p>
<p>You know might be taking a hiatus from work given where the markets are</p>
<p>I mean, I thought I thought this governor thing would be value destructive. It looks like actually I would have saved money</p>
<p>Fuck it i&rsquo;m doing it. I&rsquo;m doing it. I&rsquo;m doing it again. I&rsquo;m back in</p>
<p>I mean, oh my god to be cynical. But if you I am losing so much money down. Wow</p>
<p>In your state sax, they can&rsquo;t collect signatures at the supermarket or at restaurants or disneyland</p>
<p>so maybe</p>
<p>Maybe newsome shut everything down so that you know</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting because they actually found that direct mail was a very effective way of getting signatures</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve gotten around that but so gavin newsome is cutting the budget of the u.s. Postal service</p>
<p>No, look newsome is definitely there&rsquo;s going to be a recall election</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be around august and now there&rsquo;s uh recall efforts underway for uh, chase a boudin the killer da</p>
<p>the killer da of san francisco</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>As well as gasco in la and the san francisco school board, but we&rsquo;ve got to talk</p>
<p>You know, we got to talk about how boudin responded to our last pod, right?</p>
<p>Oh my lord david, I I have three comments to say before we talk about boudin number one</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen you more energetic. Did you get yeah, where are you?</p>
<p>Did you download a fourth emotion did you download a fourth emotion in palm beach?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been at the massage parlor every morning. Oh, it&rsquo;s just feeling energized. You&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a build-up over the last two weeks. It&rsquo;s like a you know, uh, yeah big release too much too much</p>
<p>How much energy I mean how how little have you spoken in the last two weeks has jacqueline spoken the entire two weeks?</p>
<p>I know what that feels like</p>
<p>I need uh, I need the bestie therapy. I didn&rsquo;t realize I needed this</p>
<p>Jake alfredberg you guys you don&rsquo;t know this but saxxy and I called each other on friday and we spoke for half an hour</p>
<p>and like</p>
<p>We were so lonely he did he actually conference called all four of us I picked up and we spoke for half an hour</p>
<p>It felt like a mini pod. It was so wonderful. Oh my god</p>
<p>Oh my god</p>
<p>You know what men are too proud to uh men are too proud to go to therapy</p>
<p>So they start podcasts telling a friend of mine</p>
<p>I was I was telling I was telling a friend like this podcast was kind of one of the surprising joys of my life</p>
<p>Over the last year. It really felt like a great. Wait a second. You got the joy. Oh, we had your joy</p>
<p>We did a download a joy. Yeah, I acknowledge joy now</p>
<p>Okay, he&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re both smiling. Wow. It&rsquo;s incredible. Okay sax go tell us about buddhi</p>
<p>Okay, so, uh, yeah, let me find the the tweet</p>
<p>So basically, you know remember in the last pod two weeks ago, we chaser was supposed to be on our pod</p>
<p>He canceled and so then in response to that jason hold the chicken noises for a couple of minutes here. Hold on</p>
<p>So, uh, I responded to chase saying listen, you don&rsquo;t have to come on our pod, but i&rsquo;ll challenge you to debate</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a debate whatever format you want</p>
<p>And we posted it on on twitter so he didn&rsquo;t respond but by the way, it got like 180 000 views</p>
<p>So a lot of people watched the challenge and so but the crazy thing is instead of responding directly chaser had a high school friend</p>
<p>and campaign worker</p>
<p>Post a blog responding to me which and jason got mentioned too, but it was crazy</p>
<p>It was like why don&rsquo;t you just respond directly? Anyway, he had this</p>
<p>this, uh shill</p>
<p>respond and what he basically said was uh in this response was he cited all these</p>
<p>Charging statistics and he tried to claim</p>
<p>That chaser has charged just as many cases as the previous da</p>
<p>The problem with that is charging doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything because you can charge someone and then plead the charges down</p>
<p>From a felony to a misdemeanor. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that the person was actually punished</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that you locked anybody up</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that you actually got a conviction to a serious crime or protected the public from anything</p>
<p>The real question is not chargings but dispositions</p>
<p>Of cases and that&rsquo;s the real that&rsquo;s the data that we need</p>
<p>And I know there&rsquo;s a bunch of reporters who are trying to get that data</p>
<p>And chase&rsquo;s office won&rsquo;t give it to him. And so, you know, I would I would challenge this. Um,</p>
<p>this little, uh chase a volunteer, you know, go find out, you know, what what is the real data</p>
<p>On, you know, how many felony charges have been pleaded down to misdemeanors, right?</p>
<p>How many felonies have actually been prosecuted? How many felony convictions? It&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting you bring this up if you do a search for go fund me chess abuden the number one result should be</p>
<p>the the um</p>
<p>The go fund me page I started it now has 455 donors and</p>
<p>54 000 in funding</p>
<p>And so I am withdrawing the fifty four thousand dollars and I have a meeting with the woman from the marina times</p>
<p>Uh, who&rsquo;s done great coverage of this and i&rsquo;m also looking for some data scientists</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;m going to give the money minus some insurance for when chessa sues me</p>
<p>And some errors and omissions insurance and i&rsquo;m going to be giving the fifty thousand dollars to a journalist or a data scientist</p>
<p>Or they can spend it. However, they want to to attack this very issue, which is just put more sunlight on it</p>
<p>And so chess abuden is not happy with me. He&rsquo;s not happy with sax</p>
<p>Uh, but we are going to put the spotlight on him and it will be through journalism and it will be through constant pressure</p>
<p>And you can help if you want to donate a hundred dollars go just donate it to that. I&rsquo;m not taking any money</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a really interesting civics experiment</p>
<p>I think for the rest of the country and I I want to say that I</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough of these details. I go up to san francisco every now and then I don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;ve not liked what i&rsquo;ve scary</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary. Um, and it&rsquo;s great that you guys are standing up for your city</p>
<p>The the thing is I wonder how much of these recall movements now will pick up steam not just here</p>
<p>But wherever else they&rsquo;re allowable all around the country</p>
<p>I mean, you know the san francisco board of education spent all this time and money, you know</p>
<p>Basically navel gazing on the renaming of schools</p>
<p>And then finally just because they were just so utterly embarrassed</p>
<p>Basically had to bag that could you imagine that in the most technically advanced and most progressive?</p>
<p>City in the world basically with the kinds of companies and people that we have here that that&rsquo;s what people were thinking about</p>
<p>During the middle of a pandemic when children were at home. Okay</p>
<p>You have this da who&rsquo;s going to get basically recalled in los angeles</p>
<p>You have a da that&rsquo;s going to get recalled in california. You have an entire</p>
<p>You know governor of the state that&rsquo;s going to get recalled</p>
<p>So what are we learning?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re learning that people can actually small numbers of people can be extremely effective at getting change done</p>
<p>And that they represent us and that the distance between what the public clearly wants</p>
<p>And what some of these bought and paid for?</p>
<p>radically insane people both on the left and the right</p>
<p>That needs to stop and if people are you know going to</p>
<p>Not listen to their constituents we need to stop them people want people want centrism</p>
<p>They want simple centric hundred percent reason people want reason</p>
<p>Yeah, the silliness is that the san francisco board of education people</p>
<p>are elected</p>
<p>When have any of you or any of the people that I know in san francisco ever actually looked up?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the person on the board of education?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really a topic that people have paid much attention to</p>
<p>And I think that um this experience when you don&rsquo;t pay attention from a civic perspective on who your elected officials are and take an</p>
<p>Action in electing them you wake up when a crisis like this occurs and you&rsquo;re like, oh shit</p>
<p>Maybe I should pay attention the next time there&rsquo;s an election</p>
<p>And maybe I should be more active and be more thoughtful or maybe we should end up in a situation where you allow</p>
<p>the mayor or the board of supervisors to appoint the board</p>
<p>And have an approval process where there&rsquo;s a little bit more kind of not just anyone that wants to get elected puts themselves on</p>
<p>The ballot gets elected. No one really pays attention to who&rsquo;s getting elected and then you wake up to this crisis</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it true that like in the board of education there was this the whole thing came to a head</p>
<p>Because they were trying to like staff a committee again to waste time on some bullshit</p>
<p>Yeah, and some guy some guy raised his hand</p>
<p>And you know, he happened to be this, you know gay</p>
<p>person, uh in a mixed cultural</p>
<p>marriage, I think and he wanted to be a part of this committee and he had been kind of like a</p>
<p>Really good thoughtful participant and they said no because he wasn&rsquo;t diverse enough or something. Yes</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly that&rsquo;s exactly what happened. There was a school board meeting. It started at 4 p.m</p>
<p>Okay, 4 p.m</p>
<p>And this was the first issue they discussed is whether that like you said this this gay white man was diverse enough</p>
<p>To be on a committee. It was a committee where he was volunteering his time time</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s good. Everybody thought that he&rsquo;d be additive. I mean, you know, everybody liked him</p>
<p>But they spent several hours debating whether they should put him on for diversity reasons because he wasn&rsquo;t he wasn&rsquo;t woke enough</p>
<p>Right, exactly</p>
<p>Then they spent their time talking about renaming schools and taking abraham lincoln&rsquo;s names off schools and even renaming schools</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>What why certain names were what they got the people wrong?</p>
<p>They got the people wrong and then basically they didn&rsquo;t even get to the issue of school reopening until midnight</p>
<p>So eight hours later and then everyone basically had gone to bed and the meeting ended</p>
<p>I mean literally this is what happened. So the the parents it&rsquo;s like an snl skit. It&rsquo;s like insane</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>You know the parents are up in arms and this is triggering a recall movement because the parents just want the schools reopened</p>
<p>And you keep getting these um responses from the school board where where they keep saying oh</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re listening to your concerns or whatever. They keep trying to process them, but they&rsquo;re not doing anything about it</p>
<p>You know and then and then they say well in order for us to reopen</p>
<p>We need to establish our testing infrastructure and we&rsquo;re putting an rfp out for that and blah blah blah</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like what are you talking about private schools have reopened just reopen, you know, just reopen</p>
<p>What do you guys think about um, joe biden&rsquo;s first sort of 60 days in office?</p>
<p>Executing at a high level with the vaccine</p>
<p>I mean opening up all those fema sites and getting to 2 million shots a day on average is undeniably great</p>
<p>the fact that he used the war powers act to force merc and to to do the</p>
<p>Uh, jay johnson and johnson, uh, and to work with johnson johnson to increase production</p>
<p>undeniable</p>
<p>um, i&rsquo;m not ha and i&rsquo;m not happy about you know, um</p>
<p>the teachers and him kowtowing to the teachers and i&rsquo;m not happy about</p>
<p>Just the hint that he wants to start the war machine up again. So, you know, yeah bombing syria</p>
<p>Who wants who here wants to bomb syria? It&rsquo;s like a right of passage. I don&rsquo;t want to I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>Where where where the fuck is syria? Does anybody know?</p>
<p>I mean, why what what what what are we doing? I mean</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s those are the key issues for me. There&rsquo;s the teachers and the bombings. I don&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>I I say I I give him an eight out of ten</p>
<p>Uh jason because I think the pandemic has been so well handled by him in science and that team</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve done a very good job</p>
<p>But those two things those two things are huge black marks for me like he and and bloomberg ripped him one</p>
<p>You know and mike bloomberg was on tv and he was just like that is a joke</p>
<p>The teachers unions are jokes and you need to basically tear these people to the ground</p>
<p>You have to they and you cannot allow these folks to hold</p>
<p>An entire generation of kids hostage. Okay, but then and then the day I think it was the same day or the day after</p>
<p>Unfortunately biden kind of capitulated to the teachers union not cool. And then this the bombing of syria was kind of like</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use sanctions. Let&rsquo;s use money. I mean that the the legacy of trump I think not starting wars</p>
<p>Was the one thing and then him, you know, just backing up the brinks truck for the light speed</p>
<p>Those are the two best things he did and those are two things that we should say. You know what?</p>
<p>He got those things, right? Let&rsquo;s carry those forward. We have to crack the teachers unions</p>
<p>Uh, the teachers union the voucher system is the only way to do it and it&rsquo;s very reasonable to say parents who are paying</p>
<p>Shit tons of taxes should be able to take that money and educate their kids</p>
<p>However, they damn please and if we&rsquo;re going to spend fifteen twenty thousand dollars per student on public education</p>
<p>As a parent whether you&rsquo;re in brooklyn or boise, idaho, you should have access that 15k</p>
<p>And you should pick where it goes and you should take control of it. That&rsquo;s the way to stop this mishigana</p>
<p>jacob, I had the I had the</p>
<p>This crazy realization as you were saying this which is like if you said if I said to you</p>
<p>You know electricians union I would say thumbs up</p>
<p>auto workers union thumbs up</p>
<p>seiu generally thumbs up</p>
<p>Um nurses unions thumbs up</p>
<p>But if I say teachers union, I just have this incredibly negative connotation now of an incredibly political class of people</p>
<p>Who are going completely out of their way?</p>
<p>To basically just like have exceptions and asterix&rsquo;s that apply to them and them only</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t am I the only one that feels that way?</p>
<p>It just seems like it&rsquo;s trending to where like teachers unions almost becoming a four-letter word</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think they care about teachers. Yeah, they don&rsquo;t care about students these unions</p>
<p>But unions in general do a very important job</p>
<p>All the students yeah, but I think unions in general do a really important job</p>
<p>And I think that you know, like all these other unions</p>
<p>I have a very positive thought about what they&rsquo;re meant to be</p>
<p>You can be pro-union or pro-organized labor, but be against this specific union. That&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying just like you can be</p>
<p>Uh pro-reforming criminal justice and the unfairness of it while still being against chess abudin&rsquo;s insanity</p>
<p>That people should be able to be murdered and killed and beaten in the streets unity with impunity</p>
<p>well, like this is these this is not an even</p>
<p>This is a completely logical position to have I want to not put people in jail for cannabis sales</p>
<p>and I want to remove people from non-violent for non-violent offenders from the</p>
<p>The incarceration you can believe that while believing you should incarcerate somebody who murders somebody</p>
<p>This is not a hard logic to understand</p>
<p>Right, totally. No, you&rsquo;re right. I mean the the the it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a combination of ideology and special interests</p>
<p>um working against common sense and what the average citizen wants, you know, right and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not republican or it&rsquo;s not republican or democrat david you and I agree on this and</p>
<p>We just want common sense government that functions for</p>
<p>The people as opposed to special interests or these radical ideologies</p>
<p>I want to have a couple of pops at the battery and go walk to another bar without having to fear that somebody&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>Stab me for my goddamn iphone</p>
<p>You know or or some poor kid&rsquo;s gonna get attacked by somebody deranged out of their mind on fentanyl</p>
<p>Look, this is why nuisance gonna get recalled is because crime and education are just fundamental issues</p>
<p>We do not feel safe in our cities crime is out of control</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going crazy that we can&rsquo;t send our kids to schools</p>
<p>These are issues that affect cities and suburbs everyone&rsquo;s on the same page</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right that the teachers unions have overplayed their hand and exposed themselves as not caring about the kids</p>
<p>Just looking out for their own benefits. They want to be on paid vacation forever effectively. And do you see there was a great</p>
<p>Example where in oakley which is a town in the east bay the whole uh, they were caught on uh recorded on zoom</p>
<p>The hot mic. Yeah, the hot there&rsquo;s a hot mic where the entire school board was forced to resign because they got caught</p>
<p>Mocking parents for for quote wanting their babysitters back so they could smoke pot</p>
<p>I mean the cynicism here is unbelievable</p>
<p>I mean these these people are supposed to care about teaching young people and they and they view themselves as just babysitters</p>
<p>Yeah, you know and they view parents as stoners</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean</p>
<p>We we gotta shake up this system and then and the problem is competition</p>
<p>We need competition and look the problem is that that the people that when you have unions running the schools</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reward for excellence</p>
<p>The bad the bad people don&rsquo;t get fired and the good people don&rsquo;t get rewarded. So they you know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Pro if you&rsquo;re anti-competition, you are a moron</p>
<p>everything in this world</p>
<p>Gets better when people compete</p>
<p>On the playing field in the arena to build better products and services and in health care</p>
<p>and in education and in housing the government and dare I say it the far left is</p>
<p>Stopping people from competing</p>
<p>We should look at ourselves as customers and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening right now</p>
<p>People are saying we&rsquo;re the customer gavin newsom and chesa booton</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want that product that products get the hell get the hell out of here with that product and give us something reasonable</p>
<p>No person who&rsquo;s republican no person who&rsquo;s democratic doesn&rsquo;t want safety and</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t want competition education. The only people who don&rsquo;t who want to stop competition education are special interests period</p>
<p>Amen, man. You&rsquo;ve been sorry. These red pills are fucking great, man</p>
