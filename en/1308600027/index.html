    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, I have the pleasure of introducing the first guest</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>My guest is Dr. Karl Deisseroth.</p>
<p>Dr. Karl Deisseroth is a medical doctor,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>and a research scientist at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>In his clinical practice,</p>
<p>he sees patients dealing</p>
<p>with a range of nervous system disorders,</p>
<p>including obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>autism, attention deficit disorders,</p>
<p>schizophrenia, mania, anxiety disorders,</p>
<p>and eating disorders.</p>
<p>His laboratory develops and explores tools</p>
<p>with which to understand how the nervous system works</p>
<p>in the healthy situation,</p>
<p>as well as in disorders of the mind.</p>
<p>Dr. Deisseroth&rsquo;s laboratory has pioneered the development</p>
<p>and use of what are called channelopsins,</p>
<p>proteins that come from algae,</p>
<p>which can now be introduced to the nervous systems</p>
<p>of animals and humans in order to precisely control</p>
<p>the activity of neurons in the brain and body</p>
<p>with the use of light.</p>
<p>This is a absolutely transformative technology,</p>
<p>because whereas certain drug treatments</p>
<p>can often relieve certain symptoms of disorders,</p>
<p>they often carry various side effects.</p>
<p>And in some individuals, often many individuals,</p>
<p>these drug treatments simply do not work.</p>
<p>The channelopsins and their related technologies</p>
<p>stand to transform the way that we treat psychiatric illness</p>
<p>and various disorders of movement and perception.</p>
<p>In fact, just recently,</p>
<p>the channelopsins were applied in a human patient</p>
<p>to allow an adult, fully blind human being to see light</p>
<p>for the very first time.</p>
<p>We also discuss Dr. Deisseroth&rsquo;s newly released book,</p>
<p>which is entitled,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Projections, A Story of Human Emotions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an absolutely remarkable book</p>
<p>that uses stories about his interactions with his patients</p>
<p>to teach you how the brain works</p>
<p>in the healthy and diseased state,</p>
<p>and also reveals the motivation for and discovery of</p>
<p>these channelopsins and other technologies</p>
<p>by Carl&rsquo;s Laboratory that are being used now</p>
<p>to treat various disorders of the nervous system,</p>
<p>and that in the future are certain to transform</p>
<p>the fields of psychiatry, mental health,</p>
<p>and health in general.</p>
<p>I found our conversation to be an absolutely fascinating one</p>
<p>about how the brain functions in the healthy state</p>
<p>and why and how it breaks down in disorders of the mind.</p>
<p>We also discuss the current status and future</p>
<p>of psychedelic treatments for psychiatric illness,</p>
<p>as well as for understanding</p>
<p>how the brain works more generally.</p>
<p>We also discuss issues of consciousness,</p>
<p>and we even delve into how somebody like Carl,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s managing a full-time clinical practice</p>
<p>and a 40-plus person laboratory</p>
<p>and a family of five children and is happily married,</p>
<p>how he organizes his internal landscape,</p>
<p>his own thinking in order to manage that immense workload</p>
<p>and to progress forward for the sake of medicine</p>
<p>and his pursuits in science.</p>
<p>I found this to be an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>I learned so much.</p>
<p>I also learned through the course of reading Carl&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>Projections, that not only is he an accomplished psychiatrist</p>
<p>and obviously an accomplished research scientist</p>
<p>and a family man, but he&rsquo;s also a phenomenal writer.</p>
<p>Projections is absolutely masterfully written.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just beautiful, and it&rsquo;s accessible to anybody,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a science background.</p>
<p>So I hope that you&rsquo;ll enjoy my conversation</p>
<p>with Carl Deisseroth as much as I did,</p>
<p>and thank you for tuning in.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I want to point out</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>In my desire and effort to bring zero cost</p>
<p>to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to acknowledge the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now, my conversation with Dr. Karl Deisseroth.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for being here.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming for me,</p>
<p>because you may not know this,</p>
<p>but one of the reasons I started this podcast</p>
<p>was actually so I could have this conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s but one, there are other reasons,</p>
<p>but one of the goals is to be able to hold conversations</p>
<p>with colleagues of mine that are doing incredible work</p>
<p>in the realm of science,</p>
<p>and then here we also have this really special opportunity,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re also a clinician.</p>
<p>You see patients and have for a long time.</p>
<p>So for people that might not be so familiar</p>
<p>with the fields of neuroscience, et cetera,</p>
<p>what is the difference between neurology and psychiatry?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I&rsquo;m married to a neurologist,</p>
<p>and I am a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>and we make fun of each other all the time.</p>
<p>So this is a lot of neuroscientists</p>
<p>and a lot of brain clinicians actually think</p>
<p>these two should be the same field</p>
<p>at some point in the future.</p>
<p>They were in the past, they started together.</p>
<p>Psychiatry, though, focuses on disorders</p>
<p>where we can&rsquo;t see something that&rsquo;s physically wrong,</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t have a measurable,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no blood test that makes the diagnosis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no brain scan that tells us this is schizophrenia,</p>
<p>this is depression for an individual patient.</p>
<p>And so psychiatry is much more mysterious,</p>
<p>and the only tools we have are words.</p>
<p>Neurologists are fantastic physicians.</p>
<p>They see the stroke on brain scans.</p>
<p>They see the seizure and the pre-seizure activity</p>
<p>with an EEG, and they can measure</p>
<p>and treat based on those measurables.</p>
<p>In psychiatry, we have a harder job, I think.</p>
<p>We use words.</p>
<p>We have rating scales for symptoms.</p>
<p>We can measure depression and autism with rating scales,</p>
<p>but those are words still.</p>
<p>And ultimately, that&rsquo;s what psychiatry is built around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an odd situation because we&rsquo;ve got the most complex,</p>
<p>beautiful, mysterious, incredibly engineered object</p>
<p>in the universe, and yet all we have</p>
<p>are words to find our way in.</p>
<p>So do you find that if a patient is very verbal</p>
<p>or hyperverbal, that you have an easier time</p>
<p>diagnosing them, as opposed to somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s more quiet and reserved?</p>
<p>Or I can imagine the opposite might be true as well.</p>
<p>Well, because we only have words,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve put your finger on a key point.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t speak that much, in principle, it&rsquo;s harder.</p>
<p>The lack of speech can be a symptom.</p>
<p>We can see that in depression.</p>
<p>We can see that in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>We can see that in autism.</p>
<p>Sometimes by itself, that is a symptom of reduced speech.</p>
<p>But ultimately, you do need something.</p>
<p>You need some words to help guide you.</p>
<p>And that, in fact, there&rsquo;s challenges</p>
<p>that I can tell you about where patients with depression</p>
<p>who are so depressed they can&rsquo;t speak,</p>
<p>that makes it a bit of a challenge</p>
<p>to distinguish depression from some of the other reasons</p>
<p>they might not be speaking.</p>
<p>And this is sort of the art and the science of psychiatry.</p>
<p>Do you find that there are patients that have,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s call them comorbidities or conditions</p>
<p>where they would land in both psychiatry and neurology,</p>
<p>meaning there&rsquo;s damage to a particular area of the brain</p>
<p>and therefore they&rsquo;re depressed?</p>
<p>And how do you tease that out as a psychiatrist?</p>
<p>Yeah, this happens all the time.</p>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is a great example.</p>
<p>It can be debilitating in so many ways.</p>
<p>People have trouble moving, they have trouble walking,</p>
<p>they have trouble swallowing.</p>
<p>And they can have truly severe depression.</p>
<p>And this is, you might say,</p>
<p>oh, well, they&rsquo;ve got a life-threatening illness.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of neurological disorders</p>
<p>where depression is not a strongly comorbid symptom</p>
<p>like ALS, Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s disease, for example.</p>
<p>Depression is not a strongly comorbid in that disease.</p>
<p>But in Parkinson&rsquo;s, it is extremely common.</p>
<p>And as you know, in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>we have loss of the dopamine neurons in the midbrain.</p>
<p>And this is a very specific population of cells</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dying, and probably that leads</p>
<p>to both the movement disorder and the depression.</p>
<p>There are many examples of that</p>
<p>where these two fields come together.</p>
<p>And you really need to work as a team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had patients in my clinic</p>
<p>that I treat the depression associated</p>
<p>with their Parkinson&rsquo;s, and a neurologist treats</p>
<p>the movement associated with the Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And we work together.</p>
<p>Do you think we will ever have a blood test</p>
<p>for depression or schizophrenia or autism?</p>
<p>And would that be a good or a bad thing?</p>
<p>I think ultimately there will be quantitative tests.</p>
<p>Already efforts are being made to look at certain rhythms</p>
<p>in the brain using external EEGs</p>
<p>to look at brain waves effectively,</p>
<p>look at the ratios of certain frequencies</p>
<p>to other frequencies.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some progress being made on that front.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as good as it could be.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really give you the confidence</p>
<p>for the individual patient that you would like.</p>
<p>But ultimately what&rsquo;s going on in the brain</p>
<p>in psychiatric disease is physical.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s due to the circuits and the connections</p>
<p>and the projections in the brain that are not working</p>
<p>as they would in a typical situation.</p>
<p>And I do think we&rsquo;ll have those measurables at some point.</p>
<p>Now, is that good or bad?</p>
<p>I think that will be good.</p>
<p>One of the challenges we have with psychiatry is</p>
<p>it is an art as well as a science</p>
<p>to elicit these symptoms in a precise way.</p>
<p>It does take some time and it would be great</p>
<p>if we could just do a quick measurement.</p>
<p>Could it be abused or misused?</p>
<p>Certainly, but that&rsquo;s I think true for all of medicine.</p>
<p>I want to know, and I&rsquo;m sure there are several,</p>
<p>but what do you see as the biggest challenge</p>
<p>facing psychiatry and the treatment of mental illness today?</p>
<p>I think we have, we&rsquo;re making progress</p>
<p>on what the biggest challenge is,</p>
<p>which I think there&rsquo;s still such a strong stigma</p>
<p>for psychiatric disease that patients often don&rsquo;t come to us</p>
<p>and they feel that they should be able</p>
<p>to handle this on their own.</p>
<p>And that can slow treatment.</p>
<p>It can lead to worsening symptoms.</p>
<p>We know, for example,</p>
<p>patients who have untreated anxiety issues,</p>
<p>if you go for a year or more</p>
<p>with a serious untreated anxiety issue,</p>
<p>that can convert to depression.</p>
<p>You can add another problem on top of the anxiety.</p>
<p>And so it would be,</p>
<p>why do people not come for treatment?</p>
<p>They feel like this is something</p>
<p>they should be able to master on their own,</p>
<p>which can be true, but usually some help is a good thing.</p>
<p>That raises a question related to something</p>
<p>I heard you say many years ago at a lecture,</p>
<p>which was that, this was a scientific lecture,</p>
<p>and you said, we don&rsquo;t know how other people feel.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we don&rsquo;t even really know how we feel.</p>
<p>Maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit</p>
<p>and the dearth of ways</p>
<p>that we have to talk about feelings.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many words.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing there are more than a dozen words</p>
<p>to describe the state that I call sadness.</p>
<p>But as far as I understand,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have any way of comparing that</p>
<p>in a real objective sense.</p>
<p>So how, as a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>when your job is to use words to diagnose,</p>
<p>words of the patient to diagnose,</p>
<p>do you maneuver around that?</p>
<p>And what is this landscape</p>
<p>that we call feelings or emotions?</p>
<p>This is really interesting.</p>
<p>People, here we have it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tension between the words</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve built up in the clinic</p>
<p>that mean something to the physicians.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the colloquial use of words</p>
<p>that may not be the same.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the first level we have to sort out.</p>
<p>When someone says, you know, I&rsquo;m depressed,</p>
<p>what exactly do they mean by that?</p>
<p>And that may be different</p>
<p>from what we&rsquo;re talking about in terms of depression.</p>
<p>So part of psychiatry is to get beyond that word</p>
<p>and to get into how they&rsquo;re actually feeling,</p>
<p>get rid of the jargon</p>
<p>and get to real world examples of how they&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>So, you know, how do you,</p>
<p>how much do you look forward into the future?</p>
<p>How much hope do you have?</p>
<p>How much planning are you doing for the future?</p>
<p>So these, here now you&rsquo;re getting into actual things</p>
<p>you can talk about that are unambiguous.</p>
<p>If someone says, yeah, I can&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even think about tomorrow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m gonna get to tomorrow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice, precise thing that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sad, it&rsquo;s tragic, but it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>that means something and we know what that means.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hopelessness symptom of depression.</p>
<p>And that is what I try to do</p>
<p>when I do a psychiatric interview.</p>
<p>I try to get past the jargon</p>
<p>and get to what&rsquo;s actually happening</p>
<p>in the patient&rsquo;s life and in their mind.</p>
<p>But as you say, ultimately, you know,</p>
<p>and this shows up across,</p>
<p>I address this issue every day in my life,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in the lab where we&rsquo;re looking at animals,</p>
<p>whether fish or mice or rats and studying their behavior,</p>
<p>or when I&rsquo;m in a conversation</p>
<p>with just a friend or a colleague,</p>
<p>or when I&rsquo;m talking to a patient,</p>
<p>I never really know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>inside the mind of the other person.</p>
<p>I get some feedback, I get words,</p>
<p>I get behaviors, I get actions, but I never really know.</p>
<p>And as you said at the very beginning of the question,</p>
<p>you know, often we don&rsquo;t even have the words</p>
<p>and the insight to even understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in our own mind.</p>
<p>I think a lot of psychiatrists are pretty introspective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the reason they end up in that specialty.</p>
<p>And so maybe we spend a little more time</p>
<p>than the average person thinking about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on within,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have answers.</p>
<p>So in this area of trying to figure out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on under the hood through words,</p>
<p>sounds like certain words would relate</p>
<p>to this idea of anticipation and hope.</p>
<p>Is it fair to say that that somehow relates</p>
<p>to the dopamine system in the sense that</p>
<p>dopamine is involved in motivated behaviors?</p>
<p>I mean, is that, if I say, for instance,</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t ask you to run a session with me here for free.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do that off camera.</p>
<p>Okay, right.</p>
<p>If I were to say, you know,</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t imagine the tomorrow.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not action-based.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s purely based on my internal narrative.</p>
<p>But I could imagine things like, you know,</p>
<p>I have a terrible time sleeping.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hungry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not eating.</p>
<p>So statements about physical actions, I&rsquo;m guessing,</p>
<p>also have validity.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There are now ways to measure</p>
<p>the accuracy of those statements.</p>
<p>Like for instance, if I gave you permission,</p>
<p>you could know if I slept last night</p>
<p>or whether or not I was just saying</p>
<p>I had a poor night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So in moving forward through 2021</p>
<p>and into the next 10 and 100 years of psychiatry,</p>
<p>do you think that the body reporting</p>
<p>some of the actions of a human</p>
<p>are going to become useful</p>
<p>and mesh with the words</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s going to make your job easier?</p>
<p>I do think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And these, the two things you&rsquo;ve mentioned,</p>
<p>eating and sleeping,</p>
<p>those are additional criteria</p>
<p>that we use to diagnose depression.</p>
<p>These are the vegetative signs,</p>
<p>we call them, of depression,</p>
<p>poor sleep and poor eating.</p>
<p>And if you have a baseline for somebody,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real challenge though.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s different in that person?</p>
<p>Some people with depressed, they sleep more.</p>
<p>Some people who are depressed, they sleep less.</p>
<p>Some people who are depressed,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more physically agitated</p>
<p>and they move around more.</p>
<p>Some people who are depressed,</p>
<p>they move less even while they&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>And so you need, here&rsquo;s the challenge,</p>
<p>is you can&rsquo;t just look at how they are now.</p>
<p>You have to get a baseline</p>
<p>and then see how it&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>And that can be a challenge that raises ethical issues.</p>
<p>How do you collect that baseline information</p>
<p>from someone healthy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s something we have solved.</p>
<p>Of course, with phones and accelerometers and phones,</p>
<p>you could in principle collect</p>
<p>a lot of baseline information from people,</p>
<p>but that would have to be treated very carefully</p>
<p>for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>And in terms of measuring one&rsquo;s own behavior,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve heard of work that&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>Sam Golden up at the University of Washington,</p>
<p>who works on aggression and animal models,</p>
<p>was telling me that there&rsquo;s some efforts that he&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>and perhaps you&rsquo;re involved in this work as well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, of devices that would allow people</p>
<p>to detect, for instance,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re veering towards a depressive episode</p>
<p>for themselves that they may choose</p>
<p>or not choose to report that to their clinician.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t even have a clinician.</p>
<p>Maybe this person that you referred to at the beginning,</p>
<p>this person who doesn&rsquo;t feel comfortable</p>
<p>coming to talk to you,</p>
<p>maybe something is measuring changes</p>
<p>in the inflection of their voice</p>
<p>or the speed at which they get up from a chair.</p>
<p>Do you think that those kinds of metrics</p>
<p>will eventually inform somebody,</p>
<p>hey, you know, you&rsquo;re in trouble?</p>
<p>This is getting to this question of,</p>
<p>back to the statement that I heard you make</p>
<p>and rung in my mind now, I think for more than a decade,</p>
<p>which is oftentimes we don&rsquo;t even know how we feel.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, that I do like</p>
<p>because that gives the patient the agency</p>
<p>to detect what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And even separate from modern technology,</p>
<p>this has been part of the art of psychiatry</p>
<p>is to help patients realize that sometimes other people</p>
<p>observing them can give them</p>
<p>the earliest warning signs of depression.</p>
<p>We see this very often in family.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll notice when the patient is changing</p>
<p>before the patient does.</p>
<p>And then there are things the patient may notice</p>
<p>but not correctly ascribed to the onset of depression.</p>
<p>And a classic example of that</p>
<p>is what we call early morning awakening.</p>
<p>And this is something that can happen very early</p>
<p>as people start to slide into depression.</p>
<p>They start to wake up earlier and earlier,</p>
<p>you know, just inexplicably, they&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>So this is like 2 a.m., 3 a.m., type of waking?</p>
<p>It could start, yeah, it could start at 5 a.m.,</p>
<p>could go to four.</p>
<p>And unable to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>Unable to fall back asleep, exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, and that, they may not know what to do with that.</p>
<p>It could just be, from their perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just something that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>But if you put enough of that information together,</p>
<p>that could be a useful warning sign for the patient</p>
<p>and it could help them seek treatment.</p>
<p>And I think that is something that could be really valuable.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So in this framework of, you know,</p>
<p>needing words to self-report or machines to detect</p>
<p>how we feel or, and maybe inform a psychiatrist</p>
<p>how a patient feels, I want to touch on</p>
<p>some of the technologies that you&rsquo;ve been involved</p>
<p>in building, but as a way to march into that,</p>
<p>are there any very good treatments for psychiatric disease?</p>
<p>Meaning, are there currently any pills, potions,</p>
<p>forms of communication that reliably work every time</p>
<p>or work in most patients?</p>
<p>And could you give a couple of examples</p>
<p>of great successes of psychiatry, if they exist?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are fortunate in this, coming back to my,</p>
<p>you know, the joking between my wife and myself</p>
<p>in terms of neurology and psychiatry.</p>
<p>We actually, in psychiatry, despite the depths of our,</p>
<p>the mystery we struggle with,</p>
<p>many of our treatments are actually, you know,</p>
<p>we may be doing better than some other specialties</p>
<p>in terms of actually causing, you know,</p>
<p>the therapeutic benefit for patients.</p>
<p>We do help patients, you know,</p>
<p>the patients who suffer from, by the way,</p>
<p>both medications and talk therapy have been shown</p>
<p>to be extremely effective in many cases.</p>
<p>For example, people with panic disorder.</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy, just working with words,</p>
<p>helping people identify the early signs</p>
<p>of when they&rsquo;re starting to move toward a panic attack.</p>
<p>What are the cognitions that are happening?</p>
<p>You can train people to derail that,</p>
<p>and you can very potently treat panic disorder that way.</p>
<p>How long does something like that take for, on average?</p>
<p>For a motivated, insightful patient,</p>
<p>you can have a very, you know, cookbook-y series of sessions,</p>
<p>you know, six to 12 sessions,</p>
<p>or even less for someone who&rsquo;s very insightful</p>
<p>and motivated and can have a very powerful effect</p>
<p>that quickly, and that&rsquo;s just with words.</p>
<p>There are many psychiatric medications</p>
<p>that are very effective for the conditions</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re treating.</p>
<p>Antipsychotic medications, they have side effects,</p>
<p>but boy, do they work.</p>
<p>They really can clear up,</p>
<p>particularly the positive symptoms of schizophrenia,</p>
<p>for example, the auditory hallucinations, the paranoia.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s lives can be turned around by these.</p>
<p>We should clarify positive symptoms.</p>
<p>You mean not positive in the qualitative sense.</p>
<p>You mean positive meaning the appearance</p>
<p>of something abnormal.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah, and thank you for that clarification.</p>
<p>When we say positive symptoms,</p>
<p>we do mean the addition of something</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t there before, like a hallucination or paranoia,</p>
<p>and that stands in contrast to the negative symptoms</p>
<p>where something is taken away,</p>
<p>and these are patients who are withdrawn.</p>
<p>They have what we call thought blocking.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even progress forward in a sequence of thoughts.</p>
<p>Both of those can be part of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The hallucinations and the paranoia</p>
<p>are more effectively treated right now,</p>
<p>but they are effectively treated,</p>
<p>and then, you know, this is a frustrating</p>
<p>and yet heartening aspect of psychiatry.</p>
<p>There are treatments like electroconvulsive therapy,</p>
<p>which is extremely effective for depression.</p>
<p>We have patients who nothing else works for them,</p>
<p>where they can&rsquo;t tolerate medications,</p>
<p>and you can administer under a very safe,</p>
<p>controlled condition where the patient&rsquo;s body is not moving.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re put into a very safe situation</p>
<p>where the body doesn&rsquo;t move or seize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an internal process that&rsquo;s triggered in the brain.</p>
<p>This is an extraordinarily effective treatment</p>
<p>for treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p>At the same time, I find it as heartening as it is</p>
<p>to see patients respond to this</p>
<p>who have severe depression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also frustrated by it.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we do something more precise than this</p>
<p>for these very severe cases?</p>
<p>And people have sought for decades to understand</p>
<p>how is it that a seizure is leading</p>
<p>to the relief of depression,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know the answer yet.</p>
<p>We would love to do that.</p>
<p>People are working hard on that,</p>
<p>but that is a treatment that does work, too.</p>
<p>In all of these cases, though, in psychiatry,</p>
<p>the frustrating thing is that we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the level of understanding that a cardiologist has</p>
<p>in thinking about the heart.</p>
<p>The heart is, we now know, it&rsquo;s a pump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pumping blood, and so you can look at everything</p>
<p>about how it&rsquo;s working or not working</p>
<p>in terms of that frame.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clearly a pump.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really have that level of</p>
<p>what is the circuit really there for in psychiatry,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what is missing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we need to find</p>
<p>so we can design truly effective and specific treatments.</p>
<p>So what are the pieces that are going to be required</p>
<p>to cure autism, cure Parkinson&rsquo;s, cure schizophrenia?</p>
<p>I would imagine there are several elements and bins here.</p>
<p>Understanding the natural biology,</p>
<p>understanding what the activity patterns are,</p>
<p>how to modify those.</p>
<p>Maybe you could just tell us what you think.</p>
<p>What is the bento box of the perfect cure?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the first thing we need is understanding.</p>
<p>Almost every psychiatric treatment</p>
<p>has been serendipitously identified,</p>
<p>just noting by chance that something that was done</p>
<p>for some person also had a side effect.</p>
<p>Like lithium or something.</p>
<p>Lithium is a good example.</p>
<p>Is it true that it was the urine of guinea pigs</p>
<p>given lithium that was given to manic patients</p>
<p>that made them not manic?</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have firsthand knowledge of that,</p>
<p>but I would defer that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true for essentially every treatment.</p>
<p>The antidepressants originally arose</p>
<p>as antituberculosis drugs, for example.</p>
<p>I did not know that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so this is a classic example for,</p>
<p>and this is across all of psychiatry.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s the seizures as well</p>
<p>that was noticed that patients who had epilepsy,</p>
<p>or had a seizure, and also had depression,</p>
<p>that they became much, at least for a while,</p>
<p>they were improved after the seizure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to take you off course of the question,</p>
<p>answering the question I asked,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard before that if autistic children get a fever,</p>
<p>that their symptoms improve.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a fair bit of work with autism.</p>
<p>In my clinical practice, I work with adult autism,</p>
<p>and I have heard statements like that</p>
<p>and descriptions like that from patients</p>
<p>and their families.</p>
<p>That is very hard to study quantitatively</p>
<p>because often with the children,</p>
<p>you have this not as quantitative as you&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>collection of symptom information from home.</p>
<p>But I have heard that enough</p>
<p>that I think there may well be something to that.</p>
<p>And what is, anytime you have a fever, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Well, we know all the cells in the brain,</p>
<p>and I know this as an electrophysiologist,</p>
<p>if you just change the temperature by a few degrees,</p>
<p>everything changes about how neurons work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s even just a single neuron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even more likely to be complex</p>
<p>and different with a circuit of neurons</p>
<p>that are all affecting each other.</p>
<p>Just elevate the temperature a little bit,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s plausible for sure</p>
<p>that things like that could happen and do happen.</p>
<p>Now, but, and yet when you think about autism,</p>
<p>to take your example, yes, we see changes,</p>
<p>but what is the element in the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s analogous to the pumping heart?</p>
<p>When we think about the symptoms of depression,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s maybe we think about motivation and dopamine neurons.</p>
<p>When we think about autism, it&rsquo;s a little more challenging.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deficit in social interaction</p>
<p>and in communication.</p>
<p>And so where is that?</p>
<p>Where is that situated?</p>
<p>What is the key principle governing the social interaction?</p>
<p>This is where we need the basic science</p>
<p>to bring us a step forward.</p>
<p>So we can say, okay, this is the process that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s needed for the incredibly complex task</p>
<p>of social interaction,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got incredibly rich data streams</p>
<p>of sound and meaning, eye contact, body movement.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just for one person.</p>
<p>What if there&rsquo;s a group of people?</p>
<p>This is overwhelming for people with autism.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the unifying theme there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of information.</p>
<p>And that maybe is unmatched in any realm of biology,</p>
<p>the amount of information coming in</p>
<p>through a social interaction,</p>
<p>particularly with words and language.</p>
<p>And so then that turns our attention as neuroscientists.</p>
<p>We think, okay, let&rsquo;s think about the parts of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in dealing with</p>
<p>merging complex data streams</p>
<p>that are very high in bit rate</p>
<p>that need to be fused together into a unitary concept.</p>
<p>And that starts to guide us.</p>
<p>And maybe we can,</p>
<p>and we know other animals are social in their own way,</p>
<p>and we can study those animals.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how I think about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hope for the future,</p>
<p>thinking about the symptoms as an engineer might,</p>
<p>and trying to identify the circuits that are likely working</p>
<p>to make this typical behavior happen.</p>
<p>And that will help us understand how it becomes atypical.</p>
<p>So that seems like the first, to me,</p>
<p>the first bin of this, what I call the bento box,</p>
<p>for lack of a better analogy,</p>
<p>that we need to know the circuits.</p>
<p>We need to know the cells in the various brain regions</p>
<p>and portions of the body</p>
<p>and how they connect to one another</p>
<p>and what the patterns of activity are</p>
<p>under a normal, quote unquote, healthy interaction.</p>
<p>If we understand that,</p>
<p>then it seems that the next step,</p>
<p>which of course could be carried out in parallel, right?</p>
<p>That work can be done alongside work</p>
<p>where various elements within those circuits</p>
<p>are tweaked just right.</p>
<p>Like the tuning of a piano in the subtle way,</p>
<p>or maybe even like the replacement of a whole set of keys</p>
<p>if the piano is lacking keys, so to speak.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been very involved in trying to generate those tools.</p>
<p>So tell us about channel opsins,</p>
<p>why you created them,</p>
<p>and where they&rsquo;re at now in the laboratory</p>
<p>and perhaps also in the clinic.</p>
<p>Well, this is a, first of all,</p>
<p>I give nature the credit for creating channel rhodopsins.</p>
<p>These are beautiful little proteins</p>
<p>that are made by algae, single-celled green algae.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a great story in basic science</p>
<p>that our understanding of animal behavior,</p>
<p>sensation, cognition, and action in our brains,</p>
<p>all the way back to a botanist in the 1850s and 1860s</p>
<p>in Russia is where the story begins.</p>
<p>So this was a botanist named Andrei Fominzin</p>
<p>who worked at St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>And he had noticed in the river near his laboratory</p>
<p>that there were algae that he could look at</p>
<p>in a dish, in a saucer.</p>
<p>He could put them there.</p>
<p>And when he had light shining from the side,</p>
<p>the green tinge in the saucer of water</p>
<p>would move to a particular distance from the light</p>
<p>that he was shining from the side,</p>
<p>which was an amazing thing.</p>
<p>If he made the light brighter,</p>
<p>the green tinge would back off a little bit</p>
<p>to a more optimal location.</p>
<p>So just the right light level.</p>
<p>So this was plant behavior.</p>
<p>It was light-driven plant behavior.</p>
<p>And he delved into this a little bit.</p>
<p>He identified that with microscopy,</p>
<p>he could see that there were little single-celled algae</p>
<p>with flagella that were swimming to the right light level.</p>
<p>So behaving plants.</p>
<p>And this has been the secret that&rsquo;s helped us unlock</p>
<p>so many principles of animal behavior.</p>
<p>So it turns out, these algae achieve this amazing result</p>
<p>with a single gene that encodes a single protein.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a protein?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a little biomolecule that does a job in a cell.</p>
<p>And these are proteins that sit in the surface of cells</p>
<p>in their surface membrane.</p>
<p>And when a photon, a light particle hits them,</p>
<p>they open a little pore, a little hole in the membrane,</p>
<p>and charged particles, ions like sodium,</p>
<p>rush across the pore.</p>
<p>Now, why do they do that?</p>
<p>They do that to guide their flagella.</p>
<p>That signal coming in, those ions coming in</p>
<p>through the pore in response to light,</p>
<p>guide their flagellar motor that guides them</p>
<p>to a particular spot in the saucer.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s plant behavior, but it turns out,</p>
<p>as you know, this movement of ions across the membrane,</p>
<p>this happens to also be neural code in our brains</p>
<p>for on or off.</p>
<p>Sodium ions rushing into cells turns them on,</p>
<p>makes them fire away, fire action potentials</p>
<p>communicate to the next cell down the chain.</p>
<p>And this is an amazing opportunity</p>
<p>because we can borrow these proteins.</p>
<p>In fact, we can take the gene</p>
<p>that directs the creation of the protein,</p>
<p>and we can use genetic tricks, modern genetic tricks,</p>
<p>to put that gene into neurons in the brains of mammals</p>
<p>and then use light to turn those cells,</p>
<p>the specific cells that we&rsquo;ve put this gene into,</p>
<p>turn them on.</p>
<p>There are other options, we call them,</p>
<p>that you can use to turn cells off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all fast, real time.</p>
<p>You can play in patterns of activity in real time</p>
<p>into cells or kinds of cells,</p>
<p>just as a conductor elicits the music from the orchestra,</p>
<p>the strings and the woodwinds,</p>
<p>and you can see what matters,</p>
<p>what matters for sensation, what matters for cognition,</p>
<p>what matters for action, and we call this optogenetics.</p>
<p>Beautiful, and I must say,</p>
<p>it was quite an honor and a privilege</p>
<p>to watch optogenetics move from idea to discovery</p>
<p>to the laboratory.</p>
<p>I think we were postdocs at the same time,</p>
<p>which is living proof that people move at different rates.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a joke at my expense, by the way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the same spot.</p>
<p>More or less.</p>
<p>Physically, if not professionally,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, it&rsquo;s been a marvelous story thus far.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to, maybe you could give us,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just touch on a couple examples</p>
<p>of where the technology resides in laboratories now.</p>
<p>So maybe the range of animals that it&rsquo;s being used in,</p>
<p>and some of the phenomenon that channelrhodopsins</p>
<p>and their related genes and proteins</p>
<p>are starting to elicit what you&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d like to talk about</p>
<p>their applicability to the clinic,</p>
<p>which is, I think, the bigger mission, if you will.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is, you know, this whole thing,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s been about now going on 17 years</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been putting channelrhodopsins into neurons.</p>
<p>It started just like Andrei Fomentsin&rsquo;s work in a dish.</p>
<p>By 2000, that was in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2007, we were putting these into behaving mice,</p>
<p>and we were able to, with a switch,</p>
<p>cause them to move one direction or another.</p>
<p>By 2009-</p>
<p>So basically, you&rsquo;re controlling the mouse&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, in real time.</p>
<p>So we could make a mouse that was just sitting there</p>
<p>doing nothing to then turn left very consistently.</p>
<p>In fact, go around in a circle,</p>
<p>and as soon as we turn off the light, it would stop.</p>
<p>That was an eye-opening moment.</p>
<p>It took, really, a few years to make optogenetics work.</p>
<p>There was a lot of putting all the,</p>
<p>there were a lot of problems that had to be solved.</p>
<p>These channelrhodopsins actually don&rsquo;t move many ions.</p>
<p>They have a small current, small conductance, as we say,</p>
<p>and so we had to figure out ways</p>
<p>to pack a lot of them into cells without damaging cells</p>
<p>and still make them targetable,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t want them to just be in all the cells,</p>
<p>cause then it becomes just like an electrode.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just stimulating all the cells that are nearby.</p>
<p>We had to keep that specificity,</p>
<p>make them targetable to just one kind of cell or another,</p>
<p>while still packing in large numbers of them</p>
<p>into those cells,</p>
<p>and we had to get in the light and safe in specific ways,</p>
<p>and so it took probably about four or five years</p>
<p>to really create optogenetics between 2004 and 2009.</p>
<p>By the end of that time, though,</p>
<p>we had all the basic light delivery,</p>
<p>gene delivery principles worked out,</p>
<p>and people started to apply the technology</p>
<p>to fish, to rats, to mice,</p>
<p>to non-human primates, like monkeys,</p>
<p>and just a couple months ago,</p>
<p>my colleague, Botan Droska in Switzerland,</p>
<p>succeeded in putting channelrhodopsins</p>
<p>into the eyes of human beings</p>
<p>and making a blind person see,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>This was a patient with retinal degeneration,</p>
<p>and he provided a channelrhodopsin</p>
<p>into the eye of this patient</p>
<p>and was able to confer some light sensitivity</p>
<p>onto this patient that wasn&rsquo;t there before.</p>
<p>An amazing paper and discovery.</p>
<p>I realize it was one patient,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s such an important milestone.</p>
<p>Well, as you say, it&rsquo;s a very important milestone,</p>
<p>and the history of that is very deep.</p>
<p>Almost 10 years earlier, Botan Droska and I</p>
<p>had published a paper in science in human retina,</p>
<p>but ex-planted, taken from cadavers</p>
<p>from someone who had died,</p>
<p>the living retina taken out,</p>
<p>opsins put into this retinal tissue</p>
<p>and showing that it worked,</p>
<p>recording from the cells,</p>
<p>showing that in these human neurons,</p>
<p>retinal neurons, that you could get light responses.</p>
<p>But then, from that moment,</p>
<p>almost 10 years of how clinical development goes,</p>
<p>and this is a gene therapy,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve got all the regulations and concerns</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>It took almost 10 years to get to this point now</p>
<p>where a living human being has a new functionality</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t there before.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s incredibly inspiring,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I would say, though, that the broader significance</p>
<p>of optogenetics is really still understanding,</p>
<p>because once you understand how the circuitry works</p>
<p>and which cells actually matter,</p>
<p>then any kind of treatment becomes more grounded</p>
<p>and logical and specific and principled.</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s a medication or a talk therapy</p>
<p>or brain stimulation treatment</p>
<p>with electrical or magnetic means,</p>
<p>if you actually know what matters,</p>
<p>that is incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>And I think,</p>
<p>not intended to disparage the beautiful retinal work</p>
<p>and conferring vision on someone who couldn&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>of course, that&rsquo;s wonderful,</p>
<p>but, and that&rsquo;s direct,</p>
<p>what you might call direct optogenetics in patients.</p>
<p>Indirect is everything that comes from understanding,</p>
<p>you know, okay, we know these cells matter now</p>
<p>for this symptom.</p>
<p>Well, how can we target those cells</p>
<p>and help them work better in patients by any means?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the broader significance</p>
<p>of optogenetics clinically.</p>
<p>I know Boton well,</p>
<p>and you and Boton share this incredible big vision</p>
<p>that I think only a clinician</p>
<p>can really understand, you know,</p>
<p>being in close contact with and the suffering of patients</p>
<p>as a ultimate motivator of developing technologies,</p>
<p>which makes me have to ask,</p>
<p>did you decide to become a scientist</p>
<p>to find cures for mental disease?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really important question to actually look back</p>
<p>and see the steps that brought you to a particular place.</p>
<p>And that was not what brought me initially to science.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s okay to, I think,</p>
<p>to embrace the twists and turns that life brings to you.</p>
<p>But I was always interested in the brain.</p>
<p>And so that was something that for me</p>
<p>started from a very early age.</p>
<p>I was, you know, we talked about being introspective.</p>
<p>I noticed very early on,</p>
<p>I had a deep love of poetry and stories,</p>
<p>and I was a voracious reader.</p>
<p>And I was amazed by how words could make me feel</p>
<p>in particular ways, just even separate from their,</p>
<p>you know, of course, dictionary meanings,</p>
<p>the rhythm and how they work together,</p>
<p>even separate from meaning.</p>
<p>And I was stunned by poets that could use words</p>
<p>in new ways that were even divorced</p>
<p>from their meaning at all,</p>
<p>and yet could still trigger specific emotions.</p>
<p>And I was, this was always fascinating to me.</p>
<p>So, you know, I wanted to understand that.</p>
<p>And so I was interested in,</p>
<p>and I became interested in the brain.</p>
<p>And I thought, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to study the human brain</p>
<p>because only human beings can describe</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on inside enough.</p>
<p>So in college, I began to steer myself toward medicine</p>
<p>and with the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>And so I came here to medical school</p>
<p>and did an MD-PhD program,</p>
<p>planning neurosurgery all the way through.</p>
<p>The first rotation I did at the end of medical school,</p>
<p>as you know, you do rotations,</p>
<p>you go through different specialties,</p>
<p>and some of these are required rotations</p>
<p>that everybody has to do.</p>
<p>Some are elective where you can pick what you wanna do.</p>
<p>I elected to do neurosurgery first,</p>
<p>even before regular surgery,</p>
<p>I was that sure I wanted to do it.</p>
<p>And I loved it.</p>
<p>I had a fantastic time.</p>
<p>There was an amazing patient who had a thalamic damage</p>
<p>and there was a neglect syndrome</p>
<p>where the patient was not able to be aware of something</p>
<p>that was right in front of him.</p>
<p>Even though their vision was perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Even though their vision was perfectly fine, exactly.</p>
<p>And so I was, and I loved the operating room.</p>
<p>I loved the rhythm of suturing and the precision of it.</p>
<p>And I loved being able to help patients immediately.</p>
<p>But then a required rotation was in psychiatry,</p>
<p>which I was not looking forward to at all.</p>
<p>And that completely reset my whole life,</p>
<p>that experience in psychiatry.</p>
<p>And it was at that moment that I saw this is,</p>
<p>first of all, the greatest need,</p>
<p>the depth of suffering</p>
<p>and the depth of the mystery together.</p>
<p>And also it was, I almost feel a little guilty about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting too.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, there&rsquo;s, yes, we can help.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s need.</p>
<p>But as a scientist, this is amazing</p>
<p>that someone&rsquo;s reality can be different from my own.</p>
<p>With everything physically, as far as we can tell the same</p>
<p>with the measures we have,</p>
<p>and yet we&rsquo;ve got a different reality.</p>
<p>That is an amazing thing.</p>
<p>And if we can understand that and help these people,</p>
<p>that would be just more than anybody could ask for.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how I ended up taking this path,</p>
<p>just a required rotation in psychiatry.</p>
<p>It all started with poetry.</p>
<p>And it started with poetry.</p>
<p>Out of respect for poetry,</p>
<p>are there any favorites that you spend time with</p>
<p>on a regular basis?</p>
<p>I mean, the ones who got me down this path early on,</p>
<p>I remember in childhood and high school,</p>
<p>Borges had an immense influence on me.</p>
<p>I studied Spanish all the way through and reading his work.</p>
<p>He was a great writer.</p>
<p>He wrote both in English and in Spanish,</p>
<p>and being able to appreciate his poetry</p>
<p>both in English and in Spanish was a pretty amazing thing.</p>
<p>Not many poets can do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re bilingual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I wouldn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>Now I became, at one point I was effectively fluent</p>
<p>in Spanish, and I&rsquo;m pretty good with medical Spanish still</p>
<p>because we use Spanish all the time in the clinic here.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t claim full fluency,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something I definitely use all the time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been very helpful in the clinic.</p>
<p>Yeah, Borges is wonderful.</p>
<p>As the son of an Argentine, I grew up hearing about it,</p>
<p>and I learned that Borges&rsquo; favorite city was Geneva.</p>
<p>So I spent time in Geneva only for that reason.</p>
<p>It also turns out to be an interesting city.</p>
<p>So you developed methods to control neurons</p>
<p>with these algae proteins using light.</p>
<p>In 2015, there was this,</p>
<p>what I thought was a very nice article</p>
<p>published in the New Yorker describing your work</p>
<p>and the current state of your work</p>
<p>in the laboratory, in the clinic,</p>
<p>and an interaction with a patient.</p>
<p>So this, as I recall, a woman who was severely depressed.</p>
<p>You reported in that article</p>
<p>some of the discussion with this patient,</p>
<p>and then in real time,</p>
<p>increase the activation of the so-called vagus nerve,</p>
<p>this 10th cranial nerve that extends out of the skull</p>
<p>and innervates many of the viscera and body.</p>
<p>What is the potential for channelrhodopsins</p>
<p>or related types of algae engineering</p>
<p>to be used to manipulate the vagus?</p>
<p>Because I believe in that instance,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t channelrhodopsin stimulation,</p>
<p>it was electrical stimulation, right?</p>
<p>Or to manipulate, for instance,</p>
<p>a very small localized region of the brain.</p>
<p>Let me frame it a little bit differently</p>
<p>in light of what we were talking about a couple minutes ago.</p>
<p>My understanding is that if somebody has severe depression</p>
<p>and they take any number of the available</p>
<p>pharmaceutical agents that are out there,</p>
<p>SSRI, serotonergic agents,</p>
<p>increased dopamine, increased whatever,</p>
<p>that sometimes they experience relief,</p>
<p>but there are often serious side effects.</p>
<p>Sometimes they don&rsquo;t experience relief.</p>
<p>But as I understand it,</p>
<p>channelrhodopsins and their related technology</p>
<p>in principle would allow you to turn on or off</p>
<p>the specific regions of the brain</p>
<p>that lead to the depressive symptoms,</p>
<p>or maybe you turn up a happiness circuit</p>
<p>or a positive anticipation circuit.</p>
<p>Where are we at now in terms of bringing this technology</p>
<p>to the nervous system?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s start with body and then move into the skull.</p>
<p>Yeah, so starting with the body is a good example</p>
<p>because it highlights the opportunity</p>
<p>and how far we have to go.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take this example of vagus nerve stimulation.</p>
<p>So the vagus nerve, it&rsquo;s the 10th cranial nerve.</p>
<p>It comes from the brain, it goes down,</p>
<p>it innervates the heart, innervates the gut.</p>
<p>By innervate, I mean it sends little connections down</p>
<p>to help guide what happens in these organs</p>
<p>in the abdomen and chest.</p>
<p>It also collects information back</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s information coming back from all those organs</p>
<p>that also go through this vagus nerve,</p>
<p>the 10th cranial nerve, back to the brain.</p>
<p>And so this is somewhat of a superhighway to the brain then</p>
<p>was the idea.</p>
<p>And maybe the idea is maybe we could put a little cuff,</p>
<p>a little electrical device around the vagus nerve itself</p>
<p>and maybe have just like a pacemaker battery,</p>
<p>have a little power source here under the clavicle,</p>
<p>everything under the skin</p>
<p>and have a little cuff and drive signals</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;ll get back to the brain.</p>
<p>So a way of getting into the brain</p>
<p>without putting something physical into the brain.</p>
<p>And why the vagus?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s there and it&rsquo;s accessible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason, yes.</p>
<p>Really? Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not kidding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>
<p>So stimulating the vagus to treat depression</p>
<p>simply because it&rsquo;s accessible.</p>
<p>It started as actually as an epilepsy treatment</p>
<p>and it can help with epilepsy, but yes,</p>
<p>you got to love medicine.</p>
<p>As a scientist, I got,</p>
<p>this is where I get to chuckle and just say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the field of medicine from that perspective,</p>
<p>from the perspective of a scientist and outsider,</p>
<p>the field of medicine as a field that goes in</p>
<p>and tickles pathways because they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little shocking.</p>
<p>And we all, at least in my laboratory,</p>
<p>I always say you never do an experiment because you can.</p>
<p>You do an experiment to test a specific hypothesis.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there are stories people tell.</p>
<p>So the vagus nerve lands on a particular spot on the brain</p>
<p>called the solitary tract nucleus,</p>
<p>which is just one synapse away from the serotonin</p>
<p>and dopamine and the norepinephrine.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a link to chemical systems in the brain</p>
<p>that make it a rational choice.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s not irrational,</p>
<p>but I can tell you that even if that were not true,</p>
<p>the same thing would have been tried.</p>
<p>You guys would have done it anyways.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s accessible, yeah.</p>
<p>I see, okay.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not to, again, not to disparage</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s been happening in this branch of medicine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s immense suffering, treatments,</p>
<p>many treatments don&rsquo;t work, and we try things.</p>
<p>And this is how so many advances in medicine happen.</p>
<p>You think about kidney dialysis,</p>
<p>which has kept many people alive.</p>
<p>That was just started by someone saying,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s try this.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something building up in the blood.</p>
<p>Maybe we can dialyze something and help them.</p>
<p>Yeah, it worked.</p>
<p>And it was just sort of a test pilot mentality.</p>
<p>We can access the blood.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s run it across a dialysis membrane,</p>
<p>put it back in the body.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that actually works.</p>
<p>And sometimes you do need that test pilot mentality,</p>
<p>of course, to do it in a rigorous, safe, controlled way,</p>
<p>which is what we do.</p>
<p>And so, anyway, that&rsquo;s how we ended up.</p>
<p>But still, with the vagus nerve stimulation,</p>
<p>okay, so what is it?</p>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<p>It has, it&rsquo;s FDA approved for depression,</p>
<p>this vagus nerve stimulation.</p>
<p>But on a population level,</p>
<p>if you average across all people,</p>
<p>the effect sizes are pretty small.</p>
<p>Some patients it has an amazing effect in,</p>
<p>but some patients it doesn&rsquo;t work at all.</p>
<p>And averaged across everybody,</p>
<p>the effect size is pretty small.</p>
<p>How do you think it&rsquo;s working when it does work?</p>
<p>Is it triggering the activation of neurons</p>
<p>that release more serotonin or dopamine?</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>But I would say we don&rsquo;t have evidence for that.</p>
<p>And so I just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But what is clear is that it&rsquo;s dose limited</p>
<p>in how high and strongly we can stimulate.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s an electrode</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s stimulating everything nearby.</p>
<p>And when you turn on the vagus nerve stimulator,</p>
<p>the voice, patient&rsquo;s voice becomes strangulated and hoarse.</p>
<p>They can have trouble swallowing.</p>
<p>They can have trouble speaking for sure,</p>
<p>even some trouble breathing.</p>
<p>Because everything in the neck,</p>
<p>every electrically responsive cell</p>
<p>and projection in the neck</p>
<p>is being affected by this electrode.</p>
<p>And so you can go up just so far with the intensity</p>
<p>and then you have to stop.</p>
<p>So to your initial question,</p>
<p>could a more precise stimulation method</p>
<p>like optogenetics help in this setting?</p>
<p>In principle it could,</p>
<p>because if you would target the light sensitivity</p>
<p>to just the right kind of cell,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say cell X that goes from point A to point B</p>
<p>that you know causes symptom relief of a particular kind,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re in business.</p>
<p>You can have that be the only cell that&rsquo;s light sensitive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to affect any of the other cells,</p>
<p>the larynx and the pharynx</p>
<p>and the projections passing through.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the hope, that&rsquo;s the opportunity.</p>
<p>The problem is that we don&rsquo;t yet have</p>
<p>that level of specific knowledge.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, okay, it&rsquo;s the cell starting in point A</p>
<p>going to point B that relieves this particular symptom.</p>
<p>We want to fix this key on the piano.</p>
<p>And then I see two other steps that are required.</p>
<p>One is to get the channelopsin gene into the cell.</p>
<p>In the case of Bhutan,</p>
<p>Roscoe and colleagues rescuing vision in this patient,</p>
<p>they did that by an injection of a virus</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t damage the neurons.</p>
<p>The virus itself is fairly innocuous,</p>
<p>but carries a cargo and it&rsquo;s a one-time injection.</p>
<p>The cells express and then they used light to stimulate.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m depressed, which I don&rsquo;t think I am,</p>
<p>although now sitting in front of a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>you probably can see signs that maybe I am or maybe I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say we put channelopsin</p>
<p>into a specific branch of the vagus</p>
<p>that we understand is responsible for mood.</p>
<p>How are we going to get it in there?</p>
<p>And then how are we going to deliver the light?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re not talking about sunlight</p>
<p>or standing in front of a light bulb necessarily,</p>
<p>but what are the mechanisms for the body?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we had to solve exactly these questions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, how do you get the light in?</p>
<p>How do you get the gene in a potent</p>
<p>and robust and safe way?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s now solved and that&rsquo;s not a challenge.</p>
<p>So there are very safe, well-tolerated gene delivery</p>
<p>mechanisms that are called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs.</p>
<p>And these are things that are associated</p>
<p>with the common cold.</p>
<p>They themselves don&rsquo;t cause any symptoms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been engineered and there&rsquo;s been a broad community</p>
<p>of viral engineering that&rsquo;s been going on for decades,</p>
<p>making these safer, well-tolerated and so on.</p>
<p>We can put the channelrhodopsin gene</p>
<p>into these viral vectors that deliver the gene.</p>
<p>And we can have little bits of additional DNA</p>
<p>that govern expression only in one kind of cell,</p>
<p>but not another.</p>
<p>These are called promoters and enhancers.</p>
<p>All genetic tricks built up by a very broad community</p>
<p>of great scientists over the decades.</p>
<p>We can put these different bits of DNA,</p>
<p>package them into this AAV, this little virus,</p>
<p>and that can be then injected into a particular part</p>
<p>of the body.</p>
<p>And sticking with this vagus nerve example,</p>
<p>we know that there are particular clumps of neurons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one called the nodose ganglion</p>
<p>that has a clump of cells related to the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>And you could, for example, target a little injection</p>
<p>into that ganglion.</p>
<p>Would that be an outpatient procedure?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You come in in the morning, get your injection,</p>
<p>maybe walk out a few hours later.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the gene.</p>
<p>Then the light delivery.</p>
<p>This is also something that we&rsquo;ve worked out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve worked on making very, very light sensitive opsins.</p>
<p>One challenge, and Botond would be the first to state this,</p>
<p>in fact, in solving this problem for the patient.</p>
<p>He had to build goggles that created much brighter light</p>
<p>than normal ambient light delivery.</p>
<p>Because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>you have to pack a lot of these channelrhodopsins in.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have much current.</p>
<p>You have to really make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got a tense enough light</p>
<p>to activate enough of them to cause a stimulation.</p>
<p>And it has to be the right wavelength, correct?</p>
<p>It has to be the right wavelength.</p>
<p>And going back to your example</p>
<p>of the algae moving toward or away the light,</p>
<p>it has to be tuned just right.</p>
<p>So could you, I&rsquo;m imagining in my mind as a non-engineer,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re also a bioengineer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining a little tiny blue light emitting thing,</p>
<p>object that&rsquo;s a little bigger than a clump of cells,</p>
<p>or maybe about the size of a clump of cells.</p>
<p>And for those that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>your credit card is about 200 microns thick on the side,</p>
<p>and a micron is a thousandth of a millimeter.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re talking about a little tiny stamp</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically half a millimeter in size all around.</p>
<p>Each edge, half a millimeter in size.</p>
<p>I could imagine that being put under my skin.</p>
<p>And then I would, what, I&rsquo;d hit an app on my phone</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;d say, Dr. Deisseroth,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not feeling great today.</p>
<p>Can I increase the stimulation?</p>
<p>And you say, go for it.</p>
<p>And then I ramp it up.</p>
<p>Is that how it would go?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s effectively what we already do</p>
<p>with the vagus nerve stimulation, the doctor in this case.</p>
<p>And I have this in some of my patients in the clinic.</p>
<p>I do vagus nerve stimulation.</p>
<p>I talk to them.</p>
<p>I say, I go through the symptoms.</p>
<p>I use the psychiatric interview</p>
<p>to elicit their internal states.</p>
<p>And then I have a radio frequency controller</p>
<p>that I can dial in.</p>
<p>Right there in real time.</p>
<p>Right there in real time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re holding the remote control</p>
<p>essentially to their brain,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s remote, remote control.</p>
<p>Through a couple steps, yeah.</p>
<p>And I can turn up, I can turn up the frequency.</p>
<p>I can turn up the intensity,</p>
<p>all with the radio frequency.</p>
<p>And control.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s reprogrammed or re-dosed.</p>
<p>And then the patient can then leave at this altered dose.</p>
<p>So this is happening now.</p>
<p>This is happening right now, electrically.</p>
<p>You do this routinely.</p>
<p>I do it routinely in my clinic, electrically, yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re getting the verbal content,</p>
<p>which as you described earlier,</p>
<p>is the indication of how well something</p>
<p>is working in real time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So this, maybe you could just describe</p>
<p>a little bit of the interaction</p>
<p>with that particular patient or another patient.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a typical arc of narrative</p>
<p>as you go from no stimulation to increased stimulation?</p>
<p>In most patients, the actual therapeutic effects,</p>
<p>the benefits actually take many days to weeks.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m mostly focusing on in the office</p>
<p>in real time is making sure I&rsquo;m in a safe,</p>
<p>low side effect regime.</p>
<p>And so first I talk to the patient,</p>
<p>who has been on a particular dose</p>
<p>of the stimulation for weeks or longer.</p>
<p>And I talk about symptoms.</p>
<p>How were things over the past month?</p>
<p>How was your hope?</p>
<p>How was your energy level, sleep?</p>
<p>You know, what is your mood?</p>
<p>And then we talk with the patient.</p>
<p>We decide, oh, this is not yet where we&rsquo;d like to be.</p>
<p>And so then I can turn up the intensity</p>
<p>of the stimulation real time in the office.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, in most patients,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect an immediate mood change.</p>
<p>What I do is I increase the dose</p>
<p>until a next level up while asking the patient</p>
<p>for side effects.</p>
<p>Can you still breathe okay?</p>
<p>Can you still swallow okay?</p>
<p>And I can hear their voice as well,</p>
<p>and I can get a sense.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re looking at their face.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at their face.</p>
<p>And so I can get a sense,</p>
<p>is there a, am I in a, still in a safe side effect regime?</p>
<p>And then, you know, I stop at a particular point</p>
<p>that looks safe, and then patient goes home,</p>
<p>comes back a month later,</p>
<p>and I get the report on how things were over that month.</p>
<p>I asked if you&rsquo;re looking at their face,</p>
<p>because in your book,</p>
<p>you describe the incredible complexity</p>
<p>of social interactions.</p>
<p>And at one point,</p>
<p>you described the incredible amount of information</p>
<p>that the eyes inform about the brain</p>
<p>and the context of somebody&rsquo;s inner experience,</p>
<p>whether depressed or happy or otherwise.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that we get back</p>
<p>to how to maneuver and manipulate the nervous system</p>
<p>for sake of mental health.</p>
<p>But what are you looking for?</p>
<p>So as a vision scientist,</p>
<p>I think, you know, pupils dilating is a sign of arousal,</p>
<p>but that could be a positive arousal, positive valence,</p>
<p>like excitement, or it could be terror.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get the same dilation of the pupils.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always reminding people</p>
<p>that these two little goodies</p>
<p>are two pieces of brain, basically.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just outside the cranial vault.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not unlike the vagus,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re more of a report than a control knob,</p>
<p>although I like to think</p>
<p>they could be used as control knobs too.</p>
<p>So without putting you on the spot,</p>
<p>again, to diagnose me,</p>
<p>something I would never ask you to do</p>
<p>with the cameras rolling,</p>
<p>but what are you looking for</p>
<p>that the patient might not be aware of?</p>
<p>In other words, can you see depression in somebody&rsquo;s eyes?</p>
<p>And if you know a patient, or if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>can you see it in their body posture when they walk in?</p>
<p>Realizing, of course, that a trained psychiatrist</p>
<p>like yourself develops an intuitive sense</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s aggregating lots of different features of a patient.</p>
<p>But what about the eyes?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>The eyes are incredibly rich in information.</p>
<p>And as you allude to, though,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as if any one measurable</p>
<p>conveys all the information you need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we, you know,</p>
<p>what an engineer would say, joint statistics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s many things all at once,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re in synchrony or out of synchrony,</p>
<p>that actually turns out to matter.</p>
<p>And, you know, the eye contact question,</p>
<p>we all know eye contact is incredibly important.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t feel you&rsquo;ve connected with somebody</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s eye contact.</p>
<p>But eye contact can go awry too.</p>
<p>It can be too intense,</p>
<p>or it can be mistimed,</p>
<p>or if there&rsquo;s someone with autism,</p>
<p>it can be barely there at all.</p>
<p>And this is one of the most striking symptoms of autism</p>
<p>is the avoidance of eye contact,</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>almost as if it&rsquo;s a harmful quantity.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s an immense amount of information</p>
<p>you get from the eyes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the pairing of what&rsquo;s going on in the eyes</p>
<p>with everything else going on,</p>
<p>the body language, the verbal content of what&rsquo;s coming out.</p>
<p>All that together is the art of psychiatry</p>
<p>and social interaction.</p>
<p>But, you know, sometimes you don&rsquo;t have the eye contact.</p>
<p>And this is an amazing thing.</p>
<p>And I do talk about this in the book as well.</p>
<p>In many cases, you know, in psychiatry,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s over the phone</p>
<p>that you have to make key decisions.</p>
<p>And as I recall, you know, vividly being as a resident,</p>
<p>very often you have to take these phone calls</p>
<p>from people who are not in the hospital,</p>
<p>people you can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see their eye,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see their body, anything about them,</p>
<p>just the sound of their voice.</p>
<p>And you can ask them questions</p>
<p>and you have to make, in some cases,</p>
<p>life or death decisions.</p>
<p>You know, is this person truly suicidal?</p>
<p>Something like that, as it comes up all the time.</p>
<p>And so I developed over the course of training,</p>
<p>and I think all psychiatrists do this,</p>
<p>is you develop a way to, whatever data stream you have,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the eyes</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s just the sound of a voice</p>
<p>coming over the phone,</p>
<p>you learn to home in on that data stream you have</p>
<p>and focus on it and identify changes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite amazing.</p>
<p>I found that you can actually,</p>
<p>if you know a patient,</p>
<p>you can detect very precise changes in mood</p>
<p>just from the sound of the voice.</p>
<p>And you can have a realization that,</p>
<p>oh, this patient&rsquo;s depression has improved,</p>
<p>you know, by about half,</p>
<p>just by the tone of their voice.</p>
<p>And same with eyes,</p>
<p>you can, with enough practice,</p>
<p>you can get enough information from a single data stream</p>
<p>to give you some information.</p>
<p>But when you do have the whole picture,</p>
<p>that, of course, is best.</p>
<p>So many theories out there</p>
<p>about excessive blinking and lying,</p>
<p>lack of blinking in sociopathy.</p>
<p>I like to remind people that</p>
<p>people have varying degrees of lubrication of the eyes,</p>
<p>which also influence the frequency of blinking</p>
<p>and presumably have nothing to do with</p>
<p>whether or not what they&rsquo;re saying is true or not.</p>
<p>But incredible nonetheless that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that the eyes are a portal to overall arousal state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the effects of light on circadian biology</p>
<p>and just overall desire to be awake or asleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the eyes are on the outside of the cranial vault.</p>
<p>The vagus is outside the cranial vault, obviously.</p>
<p>What about the goodies in here?</p>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s, we know the,</p>
<p>at least one of the major sites of degeneration and failure</p>
<p>that lead to those symptoms.</p>
<p>I can name off any number of other things.</p>
<p>In your book, you talk about the beautiful work</p>
<p>done with optogenetics of active versus passive coping,</p>
<p>that there are areas of the brain like the bannula</p>
<p>when active make animals and presumably people</p>
<p>passive and unwilling or uninterested</p>
<p>in fighting back against pressures of life.</p>
<p>Whereas another region, the raphe, you stimulate that</p>
<p>and they actively cope.</p>
<p>They get their grit going</p>
<p>and they are able to lean into life.</p>
<p>So how does one get to those structures in a focused way?</p>
<p>And what does the next two to five to 10 years look like?</p>
<p>Well, this is the promise on that.</p>
<p>And it is on that timescale</p>
<p>that I think things may start to play out.</p>
<p>You know, that the specificity of optogenetics</p>
<p>is really only useful if you have some idea</p>
<p>of how to use that specificity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a frustrating aspect of psychiatry that in many cases,</p>
<p>the most effective treatments we have</p>
<p>have the least specificity.</p>
<p>Electroconvulsive therapy being a great example</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re causing a brain-wide-</p>
<p>Which looks barbaric, but as you mentioned, is effective.</p>
<p>I mean, it is, these days it&rsquo;s much more clinically,</p>
<p>you know, safe and stable.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like one flu,</p>
<p>the last seen in one flu over the cuckoo&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a very clinically safe and stable procedure,</p>
<p>but where I would say, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got this almost medieval lack of specificity,</p>
<p>even if the procedure is well-controlled</p>
<p>and clinically safe and stable.</p>
<p>And it has a, it&rsquo;s not very specific.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re causing a brain-wide seizure.</p>
<p>How could you be less specific than that?</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know the source of the relief.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>Presumably it&rsquo;s a dump of neuromodulators</p>
<p>like dopamine and serotonin, but we don&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>There certainly is a dump of neuromodulators.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s the cause for the relief.</p>
<p>And likewise with medications,</p>
<p>this is also an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Some of the most effective antidepressants,</p>
<p>some of the most effective antipsychotics</p>
<p>are the ones that have the most side effects.</p>
<p>And many examples of this, for example,</p>
<p>the most effective antipsychotic</p>
<p>is something called Clozapine,</p>
<p>which has, it&rsquo;s unquestionably has the most side effects.</p>
<p>It had terrible, terrible side effects.</p>
<p>The D4 antagonist?</p>
<p>It has basically every receptor.</p>
<p>Does it really?</p>
<p>Yeah, it acts-</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, it has prominent serotonin,</p>
<p>prominent muscarinic,</p>
<p>certainly acts on dopamine receptors,</p>
<p>but it causes blood cell counts to change.</p>
<p>How do people feel?</p>
<p>So if I were schizophrenic</p>
<p>and I was getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera,</p>
<p>and I took Clozapine,</p>
<p>what could I expect to feel?</p>
<p>Well, so you would notice side effects</p>
<p>and you would notice resolution of symptoms both.</p>
<p>So the voices would go away in a good situation,</p>
<p>the voices would go away,</p>
<p>but I would feel not good in my body.</p>
<p>You would have, you might have dizziness,</p>
<p>you might have drooling,</p>
<p>you might have any number of</p>
<p>physical sensations</p>
<p>that would be due to these off-target effects,</p>
<p>the medication acting on these other receptors.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certainly not suggesting this,</p>
<p>but what if somebody without schizophrenia took Clozapine?</p>
<p>They had the same side effects, presumably, yeah.</p>
<p>And so it would not be something that I would recommend.</p>
<p>Do psychiatrists take the drugs that they prescribe?</p>
<p>I just finished, for the third time,</p>
<p>Oliver Sacks&rsquo; autobiography, which is marvelous</p>
<p>and I highly recommend to people.</p>
<p>He certainly took a lot of drugs,</p>
<p>not as part of his professional role,</p>
<p>but just out of curiosity,</p>
<p>what is the interest or kind of role of drugs</p>
<p>in the field of psychiatry?</p>
<p>Because I would imagine for a group of very curious,</p>
<p>introspective people who are making recommendations</p>
<p>about what to take,</p>
<p>there could actually be some benefit for understanding</p>
<p>what the experience of those drugs was like</p>
<p>for their patients.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And I will say that probably many or most psychiatrists</p>
<p>have sampled a number of these</p>
<p>for exactly the reason that you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>is to understand better</p>
<p>and to help treat their patients better.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve spoken to people who have really been,</p>
<p>have found this very helpful to know,</p>
<p>okay, this sleep disruption caused by this medication</p>
<p>or the libido disruption caused by this other medication.</p>
<p>Wow, that is a big effect.</p>
<p>And it really helps with empathy</p>
<p>for the patients to understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that physicians</p>
<p>or anybody experiment with drugs,</p>
<p>but I am relieved to hear that</p>
<p>because I think that when you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>accessing somebody&rsquo;s mind and their basic physiology,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, relate to appetite, libido and sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really, one is acting as a mechanic</p>
<p>of the person&rsquo;s whole experience.</p>
<p>They walk out of the office</p>
<p>and they have a life experience</p>
<p>that extends beyond the script.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so at the same time though,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t let that completely guide your clinical decisions</p>
<p>because as I mentioned,</p>
<p>some of these medications that have the most side effects,</p>
<p>they are also the most effective.</p>
<p>And clozapine is a great example.</p>
<p>That will work in patients where nothing else works.</p>
<p>And believe me,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t take the step of clozapine prescription lightly</p>
<p>because of all these side effects.</p>
<p>You have to come in for a weekly blood cell</p>
<p>or every few weeks a blood cell check</p>
<p>to make sure that the blood counts are not off, for example.</p>
<p>But there are patients where no other medication works</p>
<p>for the schizophrenia and clozapine works amazingly well.</p>
<p>And so we do it even though there are the side effects.</p>
<p>And so then this comes back to your question,</p>
<p>what if we had better and better specificity?</p>
<p>Well, only if we know exactly what we&rsquo;re doing is the point.</p>
<p>And so because as we become more refined,</p>
<p>we better be right about where we&rsquo;re refining to.</p>
<p>And you imagine a day where it will be a single,</p>
<p>maybe even outpatient neurosurgery</p>
<p>would go in through the skull or the back of the ear,</p>
<p>deliver a small viral injection</p>
<p>of one of these adenoviruses,</p>
<p>a little sticker of light emitting diode.</p>
<p>Is that it deep in the brain?</p>
<p>Is that how you envision this someday?</p>
<p>That certainly could happen.</p>
<p>What I actually prefer as a vision is still medications</p>
<p>because those are minimally invasive.</p>
<p>If we knew what we were doing,</p>
<p>we could make them more specific, have fewer side effects.</p>
<p>But optogenetics that&rsquo;ll arm us</p>
<p>with true causal understanding.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll know,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re already moving rapidly toward this point.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll know, okay, this symptom,</p>
<p>the loss of pleasure in life that we call anhedonia</p>
<p>or the loss of motivation or energy</p>
<p>to overcome challenges, active coping.</p>
<p>These are largely subserved,</p>
<p>largely controlled by this circuit or that circuit</p>
<p>or the cell that inhabits this other circuit.</p>
<p>And we will know that</p>
<p>because of the work done with channel ops.</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>In ways that we never could have the confidence otherwise.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll know that this is the circuit</p>
<p>that underlies the symptom or its resolution.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll get to understand these cells very deeply.</p>
<p>Okay, these cells that are causal, that do matter.</p>
<p>Who are they?</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their wiring?</p>
<p>What are the proteins that they make?</p>
<p>What are the little things</p>
<p>that are on the surface of the cell</p>
<p>that could be receptors for specific medications</p>
<p>or combinations of receptors</p>
<p>that would give us the specificity we need?</p>
<p>And then armed with that causal</p>
<p>and precise and rigorous knowledge,</p>
<p>then you can imagine medication development</p>
<p>becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous,</p>
<p>but truly grounded in causality.</p>
<p>I see, so using channel opsense</p>
<p>as a way to probe the circuitry</p>
<p>and figure out the sites that are disrupted,</p>
<p>what patterns of activity are required?</p>
<p>And then by understanding the constituents of those cells,</p>
<p>like what they express and what they make,</p>
<p>then developing drugs that could target those cells,</p>
<p>not necessarily putting light-inducing diodes</p>
<p>into the brain or walking around</p>
<p>with wire packs attached to our skull or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>And I realize no one has a crystal ball,</p>
<p>but what do you think the arc of that is?</p>
<p>Meaning, are we going to see that in a year,</p>
<p>in two years, three years?</p>
<p>Let me reframe that.</p>
<p>How soon will a pill-based treatment</p>
<p>for a psychiatric disease be available</p>
<p>that targets a specific set of cells</p>
<p>that we know are important</p>
<p>because of the work done with channel opsense?</p>
<p>I think that is, in some ways,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already happening at the level of individual patients.</p>
<p>Here at Stanford.</p>
<p>Yeah, yep.</p>
<p>And more broadly, in terms of new drugs,</p>
<p>new multicenter clinical trials</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll play out over the next few years.</p>
<p>And these could be drugs that are already safe</p>
<p>and approved for other purposes,</p>
<p>but we might say, okay, now we know that this medication,</p>
<p>based on what we know from causal optogenetics,</p>
<p>this could be useful for this other purpose,</p>
<p>this psychiatric symptom.</p>
<p>And so the path to helping patients</p>
<p>could be relatively swift.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about brain-machine interface?</p>
<p>And Neuralink always comes up,</p>
<p>although I do want to point out,</p>
<p>I have tremendous respect for the folks at Neuralink,</p>
<p>including someone who came up through my lab</p>
<p>is now there as a neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>but the brain-machine interface is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been happening for a long time now,</p>
<p>some of the best work,</p>
<p>among the best work being done here at Stanford</p>
<p>and elsewhere too, of course.</p>
<p>How is what you just described compatible with</p>
<p>or different than brain-machine interface,</p>
<p>meaning devices, little probes</p>
<p>that are going to stimulate different patterns of activity</p>
<p>and ensembles of neurons?</p>
<p>And what are your general thoughts</p>
<p>about brain-machine interface as going forward?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is, first of all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an amazing scientific discovery approach.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, we and others here at Stanford</p>
<p>are using electrodes, collecting information</p>
<p>from tens of thousands of neurons.</p>
<p>In humans, I should add.</p>
<p>And even, yes, it&rsquo;s quite even separate</p>
<p>from the Neuralink work, as you point out.</p>
<p>Many people have been doing this in humans</p>
<p>as well as in non-human primates.</p>
<p>And this is pretty powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>This will let us understand what&rsquo;s going on in the brain</p>
<p>in psychiatric disease, in neurological disease,</p>
<p>and will give us ideas for treatment.</p>
<p>It is, of course, it&rsquo;s still invasive.</p>
<p>You still are talking about putting a device</p>
<p>into the brain.</p>
<p>And that has to be treated as a situation</p>
<p>that has some risks and a step</p>
<p>that has to be taken carefully.</p>
<p>I see that as something that will be part of psychiatry</p>
<p>in the long run.</p>
<p>Already with deep brain stimulation approaches,</p>
<p>we can help people with psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s putting just a single electrode,</p>
<p>not even a complex closed loop system</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re both playing in and getting information back.</p>
<p>Even just a single stimulation electrode in the brain</p>
<p>can help people with OCD, for example, quite powerfully.</p>
<p>And that will become much more powerful</p>
<p>when we get to a true brain machine interface,</p>
<p>collecting information back,</p>
<p>stimulating only when you need to.</p>
<p>If we could identify a pathological activity pattern,</p>
<p>almost like the prodrome or the early stage of a seizure,</p>
<p>maybe there are events that happen leading up to,</p>
<p>on some timescale, a psychiatric symptom,</p>
<p>we could intervene in a closed loop way,</p>
<p>detect what&rsquo;s happening, what&rsquo;s starting to go wrong,</p>
<p>feed that back to the brain stimulation electrode,</p>
<p>have it be in that way more efficient and more principled.</p>
<p>This is, I think, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that, of course,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be grounded, again, in causal understanding.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll need to know what is that pathological pattern</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re detecting and we need to know that it matters.</p>
<p>And so, again, that&rsquo;s where optogenetics is helping us,</p>
<p>helping us know, okay, this pattern of activity</p>
<p>in these cells, in these circuits,</p>
<p>this does mean that there&rsquo;s a particular kind of symptom</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>But armed with that knowledge, absolutely,</p>
<p>even the simple closed loop device detect and stimulate</p>
<p>is gonna be part of psychiatry in the future.</p>
<p>And then, of course, as you get to more cells,</p>
<p>more connections, the ability that we have to help people</p>
<p>will become more powerful.</p>
<p>One of the questions I get asked a lot is about ADHD</p>
<p>and attention deficit of various kinds.</p>
<p>I have the hunch that one reason I get asked so often</p>
<p>is that people are feeling really distracted</p>
<p>and challenged in funneling their attention</p>
<p>and their behavior.</p>
<p>But, and there are a number of reasons for that, of course,</p>
<p>but what is true ADHD and what does it look like?</p>
<p>What can be done for it?</p>
<p>And what, if any, role for channel opsins</p>
<p>or these downstream technologies that you&rsquo;re developing,</p>
<p>what do they offer for people that suffer from ADHD</p>
<p>or have a family member that suffers from ADHD?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a pretty interesting branch of psychiatry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that people have been helped</p>
<p>by the treatments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s active debate over what fraction of people</p>
<p>who have these symptoms can or should be treated.</p>
<p>This is typically Adderall or stimulants of some kind.</p>
<p>For example, the stimulants, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So ADHD, as its name suggests, it has symptoms of,</p>
<p>it can have either a hyperactive state</p>
<p>or an inattentive state.</p>
<p>And those can be completely separate from each other.</p>
<p>You could have a patient who effectively</p>
<p>is not hyperactive at all,</p>
<p>but can&rsquo;t remain focused on what&rsquo;s going on around them.</p>
<p>So their body can be still,</p>
<p>but their mind is darting around.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Or they can be very hyperactive with their body.</p>
<p>Yeah, it happens both ways.</p>
<p>Probably rarely is somebody hyperactive with their body,</p>
<p>but their mind is still.</p>
<p>Although I have to say,</p>
<p>and this is a benevolent shout out to Botan Rosca,</p>
<p>Botan has an incredibly sharp and focused mind.</p>
<p>And his hand movements are extremely exact also.</p>
<p>So I do sometimes wonder whether or not</p>
<p>our body movements and our head movements are,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re coordinated or not,</p>
<p>is a readout of how directed our attention is.</p>
<p>I notice I have to think complex, abstract thoughts.</p>
<p>I notice I have to be very still.</p>
<p>So my body has to be almost completely unmoving</p>
<p>for me to think very abstractly and deeply.</p>
<p>Other people are different.</p>
<p>Some people, when they&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>they get their best thoughts.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine that.</p>
<p>My brain does not work that way at all.</p>
<p>I have to be totally motionless,</p>
<p>which is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>How do you go about that?</p>
<p>I sit much like this.</p>
<p>I try to have time in each day</p>
<p>where I am literally sitting almost in this position,</p>
<p>but without distraction and thinking.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost meditative in some ways,</p>
<p>except it&rsquo;s not true meditation.</p>
<p>But I am thinking while not moving.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to structure your thoughts in that time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Interesting.</p>
<p>So, but everybody, as you say, is very different.</p>
<p>And so with ADHD, you have,</p>
<p>the key thing is we want to make sure</p>
<p>that this is present across different domains of life,</p>
<p>school and home,</p>
<p>to show that it really is a pervasive pattern</p>
<p>and not something specific to the teacher</p>
<p>or the home situation or something.</p>
<p>And then you can help patients.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that ADHD is one of those disorders</p>
<p>where people are trying to work</p>
<p>on quantitative EEG-based diagnoses.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some progress</p>
<p>toward making up a diagnosis</p>
<p>with looking at particular</p>
<p>externally detectable brainwave rhythms.</p>
<p>So skull cap with some electrodes</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t penetrate the skull.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And this can be done in an hour or two hour session.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Has to be done in a clinic, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, in the clinic, right.</p>
<p>You have to have the right recording apparatus and so on.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, in principle,</p>
<p>as increasing confidence comes in exactly which measurements</p>
<p>one could even imagine moving toward home tests,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons I get asked about it so much</p>
<p>is a lot of people wonder if they have ADHD.</p>
<p>Do you think that some of the lifestyle factors</p>
<p>that inhabit us all these days</p>
<p>could induce a subclinical or a clinical like ADHD?</p>
<p>Meaning if I look at people&rsquo;s phone use, including my own,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think of it like addiction,</p>
<p>it looks to me and feels to me more like OCD.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll come clean here by saying when I was younger,</p>
<p>when I was a kid, I had a grunting tick.</p>
<p>I used to hide it.</p>
<p>I actually used to hide in the closet</p>
<p>because my dad would make me stop.</p>
<p>And I used to,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t feel any relief of my mind</p>
<p>until I would do this.</p>
<p>And actually now, if I get very tired,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve been pushing long hours,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll come back.</p>
<p>I was not treated for it,</p>
<p>but I will confess that I&rsquo;ve had the experience of,</p>
<p>I always liked sports where I involved a lot of impact,</p>
<p>fortunately not football,</p>
<p>because I went to a high school</p>
<p>where the football team was terrible.</p>
<p>Maybe that would have avoided more impact,</p>
<p>but things like skateboarding, boxing, they bring relief.</p>
<p>I feel clarity after a head hit, which I avoid,</p>
<p>but I used to say that&rsquo;s the only time</p>
<p>I feel truly clear for a long,</p>
<p>and then eventually it dissipated.</p>
<p>By about age 16, 17, it just disappeared.</p>
<p>So I have great empathy for those that feel</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s something contained in them</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t allow them to focus on what they wanna focus on.</p>
<p>And these days with the phone and all these email, et cetera,</p>
<p>I wonder, and I empathize a bit when I hear people saying,</p>
<p>like, I think I might have ADHD or ADD.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that our behaviors</p>
<p>and our interaction with the sensory world,</p>
<p>which is really what phones and email really are,</p>
<p>could induce ADD or reactivate it?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a great question.</p>
<p>I think about it a lot.</p>
<p>And you mentioned this tick-like behavior in yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very common that people who have ticks</p>
<p>have this building up of something</p>
<p>that can only be relieved by executing the tick,</p>
<p>which can be a motor movement</p>
<p>or a localization or even a thought.</p>
<p>And people do, I think these days, do have this.</p>
<p>If they haven&rsquo;t checked their phone in a while,</p>
<p>they do have a buildup, a buildup, a buildup</p>
<p>until they can check it and relieve it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some similarities.</p>
<p>There is a little reward that comes with the checking.</p>
<p>But the key question in all of psychiatry,</p>
<p>what we do is we don&rsquo;t diagnose something</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s disrupting what we call</p>
<p>social or occupational functioning.</p>
<p>You could have any number of symptoms,</p>
<p>but literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires</p>
<p>that it has to be disrupting</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s social or occupational functioning.</p>
<p>And these days, checking your phone is pretty adaptive.</p>
<p>That pretty much helps your social</p>
<p>and occupational functioning.</p>
<p>And so we can&rsquo;t make it a psychiatric diagnosis,</p>
<p>at least in the world of today.</p>
<p>Yeah, opting out of communication now</p>
<p>makes you in some ways less adaptive,</p>
<p>though I would point to you as an example</p>
<p>of somebody who is quite good at managing his interactions,</p>
<p>at least from the outsider perspective.</p>
<p>I do want to ask you a little bit about you.</p>
<p>And first of all, and I realize this is only a partial list,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re a clinician, you see patients,</p>
<p>you run a big laboratory.</p>
<p>How many people are in your laboratory now?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge laboratory from experience.</p>
<p>I can say that&rsquo;s an enormous laboratory.</p>
<p>You have a family of five children</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re happily married</p>
<p>to a wonderful colleague of ours as well,</p>
<p>who does incredible work.</p>
<p>How do you organize at a kind of conceptual level</p>
<p>the day and the week?</p>
<p>And I should say, what stress mitigation practices,</p>
<p>if any, do you incorporate?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received emails from you at three in the morning.</p>
<p>I sometimes send emails at three in the morning,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s when I wake up, maybe I&rsquo;m depressed,</p>
<p>but I go back to sleep.</p>
<p>So maybe you just describe the arc of the blocks of the day,</p>
<p>not hour by hour,</p>
<p>necessarily the details of what are in those blocks,</p>
<p>but how do you conceptualize the day?</p>
<p>How do you conceptualize the week?</p>
<p>And how do you feel about how that&rsquo;s lined up</p>
<p>with your larger goals</p>
<p>of making sure these five young people flourish,</p>
<p>which I hear they are.</p>
<p>But how do you go about this?</p>
<p>What for most people</p>
<p>would just be an overwhelming set of items?</p>
<p>Well, of course, sometimes it&rsquo;s just take it day by day.</p>
<p>So you bring the horizon into the unit of the day.</p>
<p>I do, I do.</p>
<p>The unit is the day, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>What I try to have in each day, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>some, at least an hour of time where I can think.</p>
<p>And that can be, it can be when kids are napping,</p>
<p>it can be, you know, actually because I,</p>
<p>while driving I can do that too, because I&rsquo;m sitting still.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the one thing I try to preserve.</p>
<p>When I was writing the book,</p>
<p>I adapted that time to be my writing time,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, so I had to add in a new block of time,</p>
<p>which was sort of midnight to 2 a.m. writing time.</p>
<p>And so that carving out these even small protected times</p>
<p>are very important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, of course, you know,</p>
<p>obligations will expand to fill the time available</p>
<p>and you have to be disciplined in my,</p>
<p>at least I found I had to be disciplined</p>
<p>in truly protecting those times</p>
<p>where one can think.</p>
<p>So that means no phone.</p>
<p>That means no phone, no checking of the phone.</p>
<p>I would, you know, when I was writing the book,</p>
<p>I would have, there&rsquo;s a focus mode on the MacBook,</p>
<p>which kind of removes the border</p>
<p>and you just have your document and it&rsquo;s very pure</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have a temptation of distraction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in,</p>
<p>because the vision and the eyes play such a prominent role</p>
<p>in directing our cognition,</p>
<p>something you talk about in the book really beautifully</p>
<p>and with a lot of depth and rigor,</p>
<p>using visual tools to harness one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>complete mental attention.</p>
<p>When you do this practice of sitting and just thinking,</p>
<p>sitting still and thinking,</p>
<p>you said your eyes are open.</p>
<p>Are you hearing your own verbal voice,</p>
<p>although in your head?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually in conversation with yourself.</p>
<p>Yes, and hearing literally,</p>
<p>I mean, not quite literally,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually hear a phonation,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m hearing words.</p>
<p>And so I discovered this about myself.</p>
<p>Other people, I think, may operate differently,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m extremely verbal in how I think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how all my reasoning is done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with sentences and construction</p>
<p>of almost equations with words.</p>
<p>Complete sentences?</p>
<p>Complete sentences or complete-ish anyway,</p>
<p>mostly complete.</p>
<p>And then, and when writing the book,</p>
<p>everything about the writing,</p>
<p>I would always,</p>
<p>every sentence was always played out in my mind,</p>
<p>listening for rhythm and timing.</p>
<p>And I would obsess over exact placement of words</p>
<p>to get the right rhythm of the spoken sentence in my mind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to interrupt your flow,</p>
<p>but when you do that</p>
<p>and having experienced this process a bit,</p>
<p>although differently,</p>
<p>do you experience any kind of welling up of anxiety</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re hitting the friction points?</p>
<p>And if so, do you have tools</p>
<p>or ways that you quell that anxiety in real time?</p>
<p>Because what we&rsquo;re really talking about here is your mind,</p>
<p>but what we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>is this process of converting the activity of neurons</p>
<p>into something physically concrete in the world.</p>
<p>And these intermediate steps</p>
<p>are so mysterious to everybody.</p>
<p>We hear, you know, just write the book, just do it,</p>
<p>whatever that means.</p>
<p>In fact, statements like that to me</p>
<p>are kind of empty and meaningless.</p>
<p>But when you hear your voice</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to find the correct word</p>
<p>and you keep hitting,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t sound quite right,</p>
<p>what is the experience in your body?</p>
<p>Yeah, when it&rsquo;s not right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely, it&rsquo;s aversive.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel good,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a hope</p>
<p>because I know I can solve it too.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a path that you know is there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t quite see it, but it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And I keep that in mind.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this propulsive force forward</p>
<p>because I know that the solution is there.</p>
<p>And that said, there were single words</p>
<p>that I would spend days on</p>
<p>because I was just not happy until I got it right.</p>
<p>And there were some things that I never quite got perfect.</p>
<p>And so I left out of the book entirely</p>
<p>because it was so close, but not quite there.</p>
<p>And so at the end, I was like, no, I can&rsquo;t put that in.</p>
<p>Everything you just said is entirely consistent</p>
<p>with my experience of you</p>
<p>and the way you go about everything.</p>
<p>I have to ask, are your kids writers?</p>
<p>Do they like books and words and poetry?</p>
<p>I know one of your children is going on</p>
<p>to a career in medicine and science.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re each different, which is amazing.</p>
<p>Yet they all, I think, do have some appreciation</p>
<p>or a lot of appreciation for reading.</p>
<p>But some are very musical.</p>
<p>Two of the five are extremely musical,</p>
<p>very, very talented with guitar and singing</p>
<p>and vocal impressions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just astonishing.</p>
<p>And some of them are great with drawing and artistry.</p>
<p>And some are very physical and vigorous</p>
<p>and are never happy except when leaping about.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just amazing how different they are, honestly.</p>
<p>But I think there is a shared appreciation for language.</p>
<p>Do you think that one can train their mind</p>
<p>in using these practices?</p>
<p>I really like your description of the</p>
<p>staying physically still</p>
<p>and learning to grapple with those challenges.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that, especially in laboratory science,</p>
<p>we aren&rsquo;t really trained to do.</p>
<p>Like many professions, we&rsquo;re taught to come in</p>
<p>and just get into motion.</p>
<p>And I found that very relaxing</p>
<p>as someone who probably has an underlying tick</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It felt great to be in motion.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things about becoming</p>
<p>a university professor and running a lab</p>
<p>was that I no longer working with my hands.</p>
<p>And it felt like some big important part of my life</p>
<p>had been amputated.</p>
<p>But what sorts of practices do you incorporate there?</p>
<p>And do you think people can learn to get better at focusing</p>
<p>through a dedicated practice</p>
<p>of the sort that you described?</p>
<p>I think, you know, I also, you know,</p>
<p>I remember the rhythms of physical work</p>
<p>in the laboratory very well.</p>
<p>My work, you know, these days as the laboratory leader,</p>
<p>my job has returned mostly to words now again.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of coming full circle.</p>
<p>I was, so it&rsquo;s a different mode.</p>
<p>I think you just have to embrace</p>
<p>that different stages of life come with different modes,</p>
<p>but you can definitely train yourself for each mode.</p>
<p>I was not, you know, I loved, you know,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, the rhythm of sewing</p>
<p>and suturing and surgery.</p>
<p>And I worked really hard on that</p>
<p>and became, you know, good at it.</p>
<p>And now I never do it, but it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the next challenge?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s all the various experimental techniques,</p>
<p>the dissections of the brain.</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t tell you how many thousands</p>
<p>of brain dissections I&rsquo;ve done in my life.</p>
<p>And now I don&rsquo;t do them at all.</p>
<p>And then you developed a method</p>
<p>so that we don&rsquo;t have to dissect brains.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, maybe tell us for a moment about clarity</p>
<p>and for people who will probably never set foot</p>
<p>into a laboratory, what an incredible,</p>
<p>yet another incredible discovery</p>
<p>and development clarity is</p>
<p>and why it helps us understand how the brain is structured.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is a different technology</p>
<p>also developed in my lab here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s part of a broader approach</p>
<p>that we call hydrogel tissue chemistry.</p>
<p>And what this is, is it&rsquo;s building a gel,</p>
<p>like a clear jello-like substance</p>
<p>from within all the cells of a tissue</p>
<p>or even an animal all at once.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re effectively building a gel</p>
<p>inside all the cells at once.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s an odd thing to do.</p>
<p>Why do we do it?</p>
<p>Well, we do it to transform the tissue</p>
<p>into a more tractable, accessible object.</p>
<p>And the reason that works is having built this gel,</p>
<p>this new infrastructure inside the tissue,</p>
<p>we can then use chemical tricks</p>
<p>and we can link the molecules we care about,</p>
<p>like proteins or RNAs, which are the things,</p>
<p>as you know, right before they become proteins,</p>
<p>we can link them physically,</p>
<p>anchor them to this gel, which is a scaffold basically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interlocking network of polymers.</p>
<p>We can link all these interesting molecules in place,</p>
<p>lock them in where they were initially</p>
<p>in the tissue, in the cell, in all the cells.</p>
<p>And then we can remove very vigorously</p>
<p>everything we don&rsquo;t care about</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s blocking our light,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s blocking our molecules coming in</p>
<p>to exchange information with the tissue.</p>
<p>We can get rid of everything else,</p>
<p>like the lipids, the fats.</p>
<p>We can effectively use detergents to get them all out.</p>
<p>And then we can see in all the things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re absorbing or scattering light are gone.</p>
<p>You can have a brain that&rsquo;s completely transparent.</p>
<p>And yet all the interesting molecules</p>
<p>are still locked into place.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re at the cellular and subcellular level.</p>
<p>And so this is hydrogel tissue chemistry.</p>
<p>The first form we described was called clarity.</p>
<p>We use that quite a bit still,</p>
<p>but there are many variants now</p>
<p>that we and others have developed</p>
<p>on this basic concept of building this gel</p>
<p>within the tissue and anchoring molecules into place.</p>
<p>Literally glass clear brains.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a brain cleared with this method</p>
<p>and looked at somebody through it.</p>
<p>And although you don&rsquo;t want to get it too close to your eye,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to touch it to your own eye.</p>
<p>But, and you can see direct all the way through it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible for the,</p>
<p>it raises an important question,</p>
<p>which is again about the human brain.</p>
<p>I mean, as somebody who essentially started out</p>
<p>in neuroanatomy and then got into other things,</p>
<p>I always am bothered by the fact</p>
<p>that we actually know very little</p>
<p>about the microstructure of the human brain</p>
<p>compared to the brains of other organisms.</p>
<p>And in thinking about understanding the circuitry</p>
<p>and the piano, so to speak,</p>
<p>and how to manipulate it in order to relieve suffering,</p>
<p>one wonders are the structures in these animal brains</p>
<p>and how they behave in active coping,</p>
<p>passive coping, ADD, et cetera,</p>
<p>those models, how well they translate</p>
<p>to the human condition.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that there are entire regions of the human brain</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t just bigger,</p>
<p>but that exist only in the brains of humans,</p>
<p>especially given that we have this speech?</p>
<p>Although I do wonder sometimes</p>
<p>if animals are reporting to each other there.</p>
<p>Maybe they have little psychiatric sessions</p>
<p>with one another.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always careful to not assume we do things better.</p>
<p>We certainly understand what we&rsquo;re doing better</p>
<p>than we understand what animals are doing,</p>
<p>and they certainly do things better than we do.</p>
<p>That said, we do have amazing, wonderful brains</p>
<p>and many structures that are very highly developed</p>
<p>in our brains that are not nearly so developed</p>
<p>in mice and fish, for example.</p>
<p>Now, that said, when I look at the big picture,</p>
<p>what is the mammalian brain really doing?</p>
<p>There are things that you would never have thought</p>
<p>we could study in animals, in laboratory mammals like mice,</p>
<p>that it turns out you can, actually.</p>
<p>And so I would never draw the line and say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t study in mice,</p>
<p>or here&rsquo;s something that has no parallel in mice.</p>
<p>I would be very careful before making</p>
<p>any statement like that.</p>
<p>A good example of that is we&rsquo;ve been able to study</p>
<p>just in the past year,</p>
<p>come to an understanding of dissociation.</p>
<p>And both, we had a paper that came out in late 2020,</p>
<p>both mouse and human work,</p>
<p>in which we got to sort of the circuit basis</p>
<p>for dissociation.</p>
<p>Now, what is dissociation?</p>
<p>A lot of people might not have experienced it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually very common.</p>
<p>More than 70% of people who&rsquo;ve been through trauma</p>
<p>experience dissociation.</p>
<p>It shows up in borderline personality.</p>
<p>It shows up in PTSD.</p>
<p>What it is, is a separation of the sense of self</p>
<p>from the body.</p>
<p>And so you can have someone who&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as if you&rsquo;re numb, you&rsquo;re not anesthetized.</p>
<p>You can still, you know that something&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>to the body, but you just don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t ascribe it to yourself,</p>
<p>which is very interesting, right?</p>
<p>That is, how interesting is that?</p>
<p>The self-report narrative.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Almost in your book, you touch on this,</p>
<p>and I will say is the most precise and meaningful</p>
<p>and eloquent description of what might be consciousness,</p>
<p>this narrative toward the self or of the self</p>
<p>and where it might reside.</p>
<p>So in dissociative conditions,</p>
<p>people are feeling as kind of an absence of a merge</p>
<p>between mind and body.</p>
<p>Is that one way to describe it?</p>
<p>And as I recall, this paper involved</p>
<p>an exploration of ketamine.</p>
<p>Ketamine was a big part of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so ketamine is another one of those cases</p>
<p>where people can experience dissociation.</p>
<p>Ketamine or PCP, we call these the dissociative drugs.</p>
<p>They cause it just like these other psychiatric conditions</p>
<p>can cause it.</p>
<p>And so we, but we were able to manifest this in mice,</p>
<p>administering these dissociative agents in mice.</p>
<p>We could make them still able to detect stimulus,</p>
<p>but not care that it was happening.</p>
<p>All the while we were recording the activity</p>
<p>of individual cells in the brain to see what was going on,</p>
<p>what was happening along with this dissociation,</p>
<p>and then use optogenetics to see that it mattered</p>
<p>to actually provide that pattern of activity</p>
<p>and see, oh, that actually causes the dissociation.</p>
<p>So we could do all that in mice,</p>
<p>which was just a, who would have thought</p>
<p>that you could study something like this in mice.</p>
<p>And we were able to go back and forth with human work</p>
<p>because here in our Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center,</p>
<p>there are a lot of what we call stereo EEG recording.</p>
<p>Patients who come in and in the course</p>
<p>of normal clinical care,</p>
<p>they have electrodes recording in their brain</p>
<p>to identify where the seizure is</p>
<p>so they can be candidates for removing</p>
<p>a little patch of the brain that&rsquo;s causing the seizure.</p>
<p>This is done for patients who medications</p>
<p>are not helping their seizure disorder.</p>
<p>And there was a patient who had a dissociative state</p>
<p>before every seizure.</p>
<p>So this was a human being who was really dissociating,</p>
<p>who could tell us literally as it was happening.</p>
<p>And we could see this pattern,</p>
<p>the same pattern that was happening in the mice</p>
<p>in the same patch of the brain.</p>
<p>We could see that happening in the human being</p>
<p>at exactly the right time in the same patch of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s homologous across these</p>
<p>immense evolutionary distances.</p>
<p>And we knew that it mattered to both in mouse and human</p>
<p>because in the human, we could cause it to happen.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>And I just want to underscore the power of not just that,</p>
<p>I want to underscore the power of optogenetics</p>
<p>and the ability to not just remove a particular experience</p>
<p>or behavior by lesioning or destroying,</p>
<p>but then to go back and actually activate</p>
<p>the same structure or group of structures</p>
<p>and see the emergence.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s essentially, these days you hear a lot</p>
<p>about gain-of-function research</p>
<p>in the context of viral manipulation,</p>
<p>but gain-of-function is something that we do</p>
<p>in the laboratory and you do in patients</p>
<p>to both take away something and put it back,</p>
<p>and which gives you causality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so, exactly.</p>
<p>And so with optogenetics, we were able to provide</p>
<p>in animals without being on any ketamine or any drug,</p>
<p>and we could cause the dissociative state</p>
<p>by playing in a precise pattern of activity.</p>
<p>And that, who would have thought you could do that?</p>
<p>But there was a combined mouse and human paper.</p>
<p>Likewise, we&rsquo;ve been able to play in visual sensations</p>
<p>into the brains of mice.</p>
<p>And by observing which cells in the visual part</p>
<p>of the brain, visual cortex, are naturally responsive</p>
<p>to, for example, vertical bars instead of horizontal bars</p>
<p>in the visual world, we could see which cells</p>
<p>were normally reporting on vertical bars,</p>
<p>and then we could use optogenetics to come</p>
<p>and play in activity just to those cells.</p>
<p>So these animals are not viewing anything.</p>
<p>Not viewing anything at all,</p>
<p>and we could activate just the vertical bar cells,</p>
<p>and not only did the animal act</p>
<p>as if it was seeing a vertical bar behaviorally,</p>
<p>it was trained to do a particular thing</p>
<p>if it saw a vertical bar, and it did that just</p>
<p>as if it was seeing something visually.</p>
<p>But everything in the brain that we were recording, too,</p>
<p>the internal representation of this external world</p>
<p>was naturalistic, too.</p>
<p>It looked like the brain was seeing something visual.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gain of function, too,</p>
<p>playing in, providing a complex sensation</p>
<p>or percept that wasn&rsquo;t there before.</p>
<p>And we can do that across species.</p>
<p>So we haven&rsquo;t, and of course, mice are social,</p>
<p>and they do amazing acts of information processing,</p>
<p>and so I try not to disparage our cousins too much.</p>
<p>They certainly have helped the field of neuroscience</p>
<p>and medicine, I should mention,</p>
<p>and I know that people have various sensitivities</p>
<p>about animal research, but the work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been carried out in mice</p>
<p>has been absolutely vital and instructional</p>
<p>for treatment of human disease.</p>
<p>Since we talked about dissociation</p>
<p>and dissociative states, rather, and ketamine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love your thoughts on psychedelic medicine.</p>
<p>You know, I sort of half joke, having grown up</p>
<p>in this area in Northern California</p>
<p>when it was much more counterculture than it is now,</p>
<p>that many of the things that we&rsquo;re hearing about now,</p>
<p>at least from my read of the history books,</p>
<p>happened before.</p>
<p>There was a movement aimed at taking</p>
<p>the very same compounds, essentially,</p>
<p>putting them into patients, or people were obviously</p>
<p>using them recreationally, but putting them into patients</p>
<p>and seeing tremendous positive effects,</p>
<p>but also tremendous examples of induced</p>
<p>psychiatric illness.</p>
<p>In other words, many people lost their minds</p>
<p>as a consequence of overuse of psychedelics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably lose a few people out there,</p>
<p>but I do want to talk about what is the state</p>
<p>of these compounds, and I realize it&rsquo;s a huge category</p>
<p>of compounds, but LSD and psilocybin, as I understand,</p>
<p>trigger activation of particular serotonin</p>
<p>receptor mechanisms may or may not lead</p>
<p>to more widespread activation of the brain</p>
<p>that one wouldn&rsquo;t see otherwise,</p>
<p>but when you look at the clinical</p>
<p>and experimental literature, what is your top contour</p>
<p>sense of how effective these tools are going to be</p>
<p>for treating depression, and then if we have the time,</p>
<p>we could talk about trauma and MDMA and some of that work.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right to highlight both opportunity</p>
<p>and the peril that is there, and of course,</p>
<p>we want to help patients, and of course,</p>
<p>we want to explore anything that might be helpful,</p>
<p>but we want to do it in a safe and rigorous way,</p>
<p>but I do think we should explore these avenues.</p>
<p>These are agents that alter reality</p>
<p>and alter the experience of reality, I should say,</p>
<p>in relatively precise ways.</p>
<p>They do have problems.</p>
<p>They can be addictive.</p>
<p>They can cause lasting change that is not desirable,</p>
<p>but we have to see these as opportunities.</p>
<p>We have to, first of all, study in the laboratory,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing this here.</p>
<p>You know, we have big, we have safes</p>
<p>with many interesting psychedelics</p>
<p>that are all very carefully regulated.</p>
<p>We get inspections from the DEA and so on.</p>
<p>If anyone&rsquo;s hoping to find these labs,</p>
<p>they exist in outer space, so you need to be on board</p>
<p>one of the SpaceX missions in order to access them,</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t try and come find them.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s exactly true, yes,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing exactly this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying this is an incredible opportunity.</p>
<p>If we could understand how, you know,</p>
<p>the perception of reality is altered,</p>
<p>we could create new kinds of intervention</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have the risks and the problems</p>
<p>of causing lasting change or addiction.</p>
<p>Now, that said, even as these medications exist now,</p>
<p>as you know, there&rsquo;s an impulse to use them</p>
<p>in very small doses and to use them as adjunctive treatments</p>
<p>for therapy of various kinds,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m also supportive of that</p>
<p>if done carefully and rigorously.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s risk, but there&rsquo;s risk</p>
<p>with many other kinds of treatment,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure that the risks for these medications</p>
<p>vastly outweigh the risks that we normally tolerate</p>
<p>in other branches of medicine.</p>
<p>Why would they work?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, let&rsquo;s say that indeed</p>
<p>their main effect is to create more connectivity,</p>
<p>at least in the moment, between brain areas,</p>
<p>so the way I think about a very,</p>
<p>I think about the two extremes of my experience anyway</p>
<p>is a high degree of stress and focus, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>is going to create changes in my visual field</p>
<p>and changes in the way that I perceive time,</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;m in a micro-sliced time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a very contracted view of whatever my experience is,</p>
<p>whereas on the opposite extreme,</p>
<p>in a dream or in sleep, space and time are very fluid,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m essentially relaxed,</p>
<p>although it might be a very interesting dream,</p>
<p>it might not be.</p>
<p>Psychedelics seem to be a trajectory,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not too far off from the dream state</p>
<p>where space and time are essentially not as rigid,</p>
<p>and there is this element of synesthesia,</p>
<p>of blending of the senses, you know,</p>
<p>feeling colors and hearing light and things of that sort.</p>
<p>You hear these reports, anyway.</p>
<p>Why would having that dreamlike experience</p>
<p>somehow relieve depression long-term?</p>
<p>Do we have any idea why that might be?</p>
<p>Yeah, we have some ideas and no deep understanding.</p>
<p>One way I think about the psychedelics</p>
<p>is they increase the willingness of our brain</p>
<p>to accept unlikely ways of constructing the world,</p>
<p>unlikely hypotheses, as it were, as to what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>The brain, in particular our cortex, I think,</p>
<p>is a hypothesis generation and testing machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming up with models about everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a lot of bits of data coming in,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s making models and updating the models</p>
<p>and changing them, theories, hypotheses for what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And some of those never reach our conscious mind,</p>
<p>and this is something I talk about in projections</p>
<p>in the book quite a bit, is many of these are filtered out</p>
<p>before they get to our conscious mind, and that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>We think how distracted we&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>if we were constantly having to evaluate all these,</p>
<p>you know, hypotheses about what kinds of shapes</p>
<p>or objects or processes were out there.</p>
<p>And so a lot of this is handled</p>
<p>before it gets to consciousness.</p>
<p>What the psychedelics seem to do</p>
<p>is they change the threshold for us to become aware</p>
<p>of these incomplete hypotheses or wrong hypotheses</p>
<p>or concepts that might be noise but are just wrong</p>
<p>and so are never allowed to get into our conscious mind.</p>
<p>Now, you know, that&rsquo;s pretty interesting,</p>
<p>and it goes wrong in psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>I think in schizophrenia,</p>
<p>sometimes the paranoid delusions that people have</p>
<p>are examples of these poor models</p>
<p>that escape into the conscious mind</p>
<p>and become accepted as reality,</p>
<p>and they never should have gotten out there.</p>
<p>Now, how could something like this, in the right way,</p>
<p>help with something like depression?</p>
<p>Patients with depression often are stuck.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t look into the future world of possibilities</p>
<p>as effectively.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, everything seems hopeless,</p>
<p>and what does that really mean?</p>
<p>They discount the value of their own action.</p>
<p>They discount the value of the world</p>
<p>at giving rise to a future that matters.</p>
<p>Everything seems to run out like a river</p>
<p>just running out into a desert and drying up.</p>
<p>And what these agents may do</p>
<p>that increase the flow through circuitry, if you will,</p>
<p>the percolation of activity through circuitry</p>
<p>may end up doing for depression</p>
<p>is increasing the escape of some tendrils of process,</p>
<p>of forward progression through the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a concept.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think about it.</p>
<p>There are ways we can make that rigorous.</p>
<p>We can indeed identify in the brain by recording.</p>
<p>We can see cells that represent steps along a path</p>
<p>and look into the future,</p>
<p>and we can rigorously define these cells,</p>
<p>and we can see if these are altered on psychedelics.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re working with these agents in the laboratory</p>
<p>to say, is this really the case?</p>
<p>Are these opening up new paths</p>
<p>or representations of paths into the future?</p>
<p>MDMA, ecstasy, is a unique compound</p>
<p>in that it leads to big increases</p>
<p>in brain levels of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously.</p>
<p>And I realized that the neuromodulators</p>
<p>like dopamine and serotonin often work in concert,</p>
<p>not alone, the way they&rsquo;re commonly described</p>
<p>in the more general popular discussions.</p>
<p>However, it is a unique compound,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s different than the serotonergic compounds</p>
<p>like LSD and psilocybin.</p>
<p>And there are now data still emerging</p>
<p>that it might be, and in some cases,</p>
<p>can be useful for the treatment of trauma,</p>
<p>PTSD and similar things.</p>
<p>Why would that work?</p>
<p>And a larger question,</p>
<p>perhaps the more important question is,</p>
<p>psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, all those compounds,</p>
<p>in my mind, they&rsquo;re two components.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the experience you have while you&rsquo;re on them,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the effect they have after.</p>
<p>People are generating variations of these compounds</p>
<p>that are non-hallucinatory variations,</p>
<p>but how crucial do you think it is to have,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s stay with MDMA, the experience</p>
<p>of huge levels of dopamine, huge levels of serotonin,</p>
<p>atypical levels of dopamine and serotonin released,</p>
<p>having this highly abnormal experience</p>
<p>in order to be normal again?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think the brain learns from those experiences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I see it.</p>
<p>And so, for example, people who have taken MDMA,</p>
<p>they will, as you say, they&rsquo;ll be the acute phase</p>
<p>of being on the drug and experiencing</p>
<p>this extreme connectedness with other people, for example.</p>
<p>And then the drug wears off,</p>
<p>but the brain learned from that experience.</p>
<p>And so what people will report is,</p>
<p>yeah, I&rsquo;m not in that state, but I saw what was possible.</p>
<p>I saw, yeah, you can, there don&rsquo;t need to be barriers,</p>
<p>or at least not as many barriers as I thought.</p>
<p>I can connect with more people in a way that is helpful.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s the learning that happens</p>
<p>in that state that actually matters.</p>
<p>And as you described that, that sounds a lot</p>
<p>like what I understand to be the hallmark feature</p>
<p>of really good psychoanalysis,</p>
<p>that the relationship between patient and therapist</p>
<p>hopefully evolves to the point</p>
<p>where these kinds of tests can be run</p>
<p>within the context of that relationship</p>
<p>and then exported to other relations.</p>
<p>Is that?</p>
<p>Exactly right, yeah.</p>
<p>And that probably, I&rsquo;m assuming,</p>
<p>is still the goal of really good psychiatry also.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a part of-</p>
<p>Intimacy, really.</p>
<p>It should be, when we have time,</p>
<p>I think all good psychiatrists try to achieve</p>
<p>that level of connection and learning,</p>
<p>try to help patients create a new model that is stable,</p>
<p>that is learned, and that can help instruct future behavior.</p>
<p>One of the things that I took from reading your book,</p>
<p>in addition to learning so much science</p>
<p>and the future of psychiatry and brain science,</p>
<p>was amidst these, in many cases,</p>
<p>very tragic cases and sadness.</p>
<p>And a lot of the weight that that puts on the clinician,</p>
<p>on you also, that there&rsquo;s a central chord of optimism,</p>
<p>that where we&rsquo;re headed is not just possible,</p>
<p>but very likely and better.</p>
<p>And, you know, are you an optimist?</p>
<p>I am, and this is, by the way,</p>
<p>this was a really interesting experience</p>
<p>in writing projections because I had a dual goal.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be for everybody,</p>
<p>literally everybody in the world who wants to read it.</p>
<p>And yet at the same time,</p>
<p>I wanted to stay absolutely rigorously close to the science</p>
<p>what was actually known.</p>
<p>When I was speaking about science,</p>
<p>when I was speaking about the neurobiology</p>
<p>of the brain or psychiatry,</p>
<p>I wanted to not have any of my scientific colleagues think,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s going too far, he&rsquo;s saying too much.</p>
<p>And so I had these two goals,</p>
<p>which I kept in my mind the entire time.</p>
<p>And a lot of this trying to find exactly the right word</p>
<p>we talked about was on this path</p>
<p>of staying excruciatingly rigorous in the science,</p>
<p>and yet letting people see the hope,</p>
<p>the where things were,</p>
<p>have everybody see that we&rsquo;ve come a long way,</p>
<p>we have a long way to go,</p>
<p>but the trajectory and the path is beautiful.</p>
<p>And so that was the goal.</p>
<p>I think, of course that sounds almost impossible</p>
<p>to jointly satisfy those two goals,</p>
<p>but I kept that in my mind the whole way through.</p>
<p>And yes, I am optimistic,</p>
<p>and I hope that came through in the book.</p>
<p>But it certainly did.</p>
<p>And at least from this colleague, you did achieve both.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a wonderful, it&rsquo;s a masterful book really,</p>
<p>and one that as a scientist</p>
<p>and somebody who&rsquo;s a fellow brain explorer,</p>
<p>hits all the marks of rigor and is incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a ton of storytelling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give away too much about it,</p>
<p>but people should definitely check out the book.</p>
<p>Are you active on social media?</p>
<p>If people want to follow you</p>
<p>and connect with what you&rsquo;re doing now and going forward.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a Twitter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I mainly do exchange,</p>
<p>tell people about things that are happening.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll provide a link to it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s Karl Deisseroth, as I recall, with a K.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yeah.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re on Twitter and people will hear this.</p>
<p>Definitely check out the book.</p>
<p>There are other people in our community</p>
<p>that of course are going to be reaching out on your behalf,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s incredible that you juggle</p>
<p>this enormous number of things.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important, however,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s all in service to this larger thing</p>
<p>of relieving suffering.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for your time today,</p>
<p>for the book and the work that went into the book,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine,</p>
<p>for the laboratory work and the development of channel ops</p>
