    <p>The following is a conversation with Kevin Systrom,</p>
<p>cofounder and long time CEO of Instagram,</p>
<p>including for six years after Facebook&rsquo;s acquisition</p>
<p>of Instagram.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Kevin Systrom.</p>
<p>At the risk of asking the Rolling Stones</p>
<p>to play Satisfaction, let me ask you about</p>
<p>the origin story of Instagram.</p>
<p>Sure. So maybe some context.</p>
<p>You, like we were talking about offline,</p>
<p>grew up in Massachusetts, learned computer programming there,</p>
<p>liked to play Doom II, worked at a vinyl record store.</p>
<p>Then you went to Stanford, turned down Mr. Mark Zuckerberg</p>
<p>and Facebook, went to Florence to study photography.</p>
<p>Those are just some random, beautiful,</p>
<p>impossibly brief glimpses into a life.</p>
<p>So let me ask again, can you take me through</p>
<p>the origin story of Instagram, given that context?</p>
<p>You basically set it up.</p>
<p>All right, so we have a fair amount of time,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll go into some detail.</p>
<p>But basically what I&rsquo;ll say is,</p>
<p>Instagram started out of a company actually called Bourbon,</p>
<p>and it was spelled B U R B N.</p>
<p>And a couple of things were happening at the time.</p>
<p>So if we zoom back to 2010, not a lot of people remember</p>
<p>what was happening in the dot com world then,</p>
<p>but check in apps were all the rage.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a check in app?</p>
<p>Gowalla, Foursquare, Hotpotato.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m at a place, I&rsquo;m gonna tell the world</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m at this place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the idea behind this kind of app, by the way?</p>
<p>You know what, I&rsquo;m gonna answer that,</p>
<p>but through what Instagram became</p>
<p>and why I believe Instagram replaced them.</p>
<p>So the whole idea was to share with the world</p>
<p>what you were doing, specifically with your friends, right?</p>
<p>But there were all the rage,</p>
<p>and Foursquare was getting all the press.</p>
<p>And I remember sitting around saying,</p>
<p>hey, I wanna build something,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know what I wanna build.</p>
<p>What if I built a better version of Foursquare?</p>
<p>And I asked myself, well, why don&rsquo;t I like Foursquare</p>
<p>or how could it be improved?</p>
<p>And basically I sat down and I said,</p>
<p>I think that if you have a few extra features,</p>
<p>it might be enough.</p>
<p>One of which happened to be posting a photo</p>
<p>of where you were.</p>
<p>There were some others.</p>
<p>It turns out that wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>My co founder joined, we were going to attack Foursquare</p>
<p>and the likes and try to build something interesting.</p>
<p>And no one used it.</p>
<p>No one cared because it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t different enough, right?</p>
<p>So one day we were sitting down and we asked ourselves,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s come to Jesus moment.</p>
<p>Are we gonna do this startup?</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do what we&rsquo;re currently doing.</p>
<p>We have to switch it up.</p>
<p>So what do people love the most?</p>
<p>So we sat down and we wrote out three things</p>
<p>that we thought people uniquely loved about our product</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t in other products.</p>
<p>Photos happened to be the top one.</p>
<p>So sharing a photo of what you were doing,</p>
<p>where you were at the moment</p>
<p>was not something products let you do really.</p>
<p>Facebook was like, post an album of your vacation</p>
<p>from two weeks ago, right?</p>
<p>Twitter allowed you to post a photo,</p>
<p>but their feed was primarily text</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t show the photo in line</p>
<p>or at least I don&rsquo;t think they did at the time.</p>
<p>So even though it seems totally stupid</p>
<p>and obvious to us now, at the moment then,</p>
<p>posting a photo of what you were doing at the moment</p>
<p>was like not a thing.</p>
<p>So we decided to go after that</p>
<p>because we noticed that people who used our service,</p>
<p>the one thing they happened to like the most</p>
<p>was posting a photo.</p>
<p>So that was the beginning of Instagram.</p>
<p>And yes, like we went through and we added filters</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a bunch of stories around that.</p>
<p>But the origin of this was that</p>
<p>we were trying to be a check in app,</p>
<p>realized that no one wanted another check in app.</p>
<p>It became a photo sharing app,</p>
<p>but one that was much more about what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and where you are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why when I say,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve replaced check in apps,</p>
<p>it became a check in via a photo</p>
<p>rather than saying your location</p>
<p>and then optionally adding a photo.</p>
<p>When you were thinking about what people like,</p>
<p>from where did you get a sense</p>
<p>that this is what people like?</p>
<p>You said, we sat down, we wrote some stuff down on paper.</p>
<p>Where is that intuition that seems fundamental</p>
<p>to the success of an app like Instagram?</p>
<p>Where does that idea,</p>
<p>where does that list of three things come from exactly?</p>
<p>Only after having studied machine learning now</p>
<p>for a couple of years, I like, I have a&hellip;</p>
<p>You have understood yourself?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to make connections,</p>
<p>like we can go into this later,</p>
<p>but obviously the connections between machine learning</p>
<p>and the human brain, I think are stretched sometimes.</p>
<p>At the same time, being able to back prop</p>
<p>and being able to look at the world, try something,</p>
<p>figure out how you&rsquo;re wrong, how wrong you are,</p>
<p>and then nudge your company in the right direction</p>
<p>based on how wrong you are,</p>
<p>is a fascinating concept.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, we didn&rsquo;t know we were doing it at the time,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s basically what we were doing, right?</p>
<p>We put it out to, call it a hundred people,</p>
<p>and you would look at their data.</p>
<p>You would say, what are they sharing?</p>
<p>Like what resonates, what doesn&rsquo;t resonate?</p>
<p>We think they&rsquo;re gonna resonate with X,</p>
<p>but it turns out they resonate with Y.</p>
<p>Okay, shift the company towards Y.</p>
<p>And it turns out if you do that enough quickly enough,</p>
<p>you can get to a solution that has product market fit.</p>
<p>Most companies fail because they sit there</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t, either they&rsquo;re learning rates too slow,</p>
<p>they sit there and they&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re adamant that they&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>even though the data is telling them they&rsquo;re not right,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re learning rates too high</p>
<p>and they wildly chase different ideas</p>
<p>and they never actually settle on one</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t groove, right?</p>
<p>And I think when we sat down</p>
<p>and we wrote out those three ideas,</p>
<p>what we were saying is, what are the three possible,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re local or global maxima in our world, right?</p>
<p>That users are telling us they like</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re using the product that way.</p>
<p>It was clear people liked the photos</p>
<p>because that was the thing they were doing.</p>
<p>And we just said, okay, like,</p>
<p>what if we just cut out most of the other stuff</p>
<p>and focus on that thing?</p>
<p>And then it happened to be a multi billion dollar business</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that easy by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p>Well, nobody ever writes about neural networks</p>
<p>that miserably failed.</p>
<p>So this particular neural network succeeded.</p>
<p>Oh, they sell all the time, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But nobody writes about it.</p>
<p>The default state is failing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When you said the way people are using the app,</p>
<p>is that the loss function for this neural network</p>
<p>or is it also self report?</p>
<p>Like, do you ever ask people what they like</p>
<p>or do you have to track exactly what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>not what they&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>I once made a Thanksgiving dinner, okay?</p>
<p>And it was for relatives and I like to cook a lot.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I worked really hard on picking the specific dishes</p>
<p>and I was really proud because I had planned it out</p>
<p>using a Gantt chart and like it was ready on time</p>
<p>and everything was hot.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re a big Thanksgiving guy,</p>
<p>but like the worst thing about Thanksgiving</p>
<p>is when the turkey is cold and some things are hot</p>
<p>and some things, anyway.</p>
<p>You had a Gantt chart.</p>
<p>Did you actually have a chart?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>OmniPlan, fairly expensive, like Gantt chart thing</p>
<p>that I think maybe 10 people have purchased in the world,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m one of them and I use it for recipe planning</p>
<p>only around big holidays.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant, by the way.</p>
<p>Do people do this kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Overengineering?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not overengineering, it&rsquo;s just engineering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s planning.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is a complicated set of events</p>
<p>with some uncertainty with a lot of things going on.</p>
<p>You should be able, you should be planning it in this way.</p>
<p>There should be a chart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not overengineering.</p>
<p>I mean, so what&rsquo;s funny is, brief aside.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>I love cooking, I love food, I love coffee,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve spent some time with some chefs</p>
<p>who like know their stuff.</p>
<p>And they always just take out a piece of paper</p>
<p>and just work backwards in rough order.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s never perfect, but rough order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, oh, that makes sense.</p>
<p>Why not just work backwards from the end goal, right?</p>
<p>And put in some buffer time.</p>
<p>And so I probably over specified it a bit using a Gantt chart,</p>
<p>but the fact that you can do it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what professional kitchens roughly do.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t call it a Gantt chart,</p>
<p>or at least I don&rsquo;t think they do.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was telling a story about Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting down, we have the meal,</p>
<p>and then I got to know Ray Dalio fairly well</p>
<p>over maybe the last year of Instagram.</p>
<p>And one thing that he kept saying was like,</p>
<p>feedback is really hard to get honestly from people.</p>
<p>And I sat down after dinner, I said,</p>
<p>guys, I want feedback.</p>
<p>What was good and what was bad?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s funny is like,</p>
<p>literally everyone just said everything was great.</p>
<p>And I like personally knew I had screwed up</p>
<p>a handful of things, but no one would say it.</p>
<p>And can you imagine now not something as high stakes</p>
<p>as Thanksgiving dinner, okay?</p>
<p>Thanksgiving dinner, it&rsquo;s not that high stakes.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re trying to build a product</p>
<p>and everyone knows you left your job for it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to build it out</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to make something wonderful</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s yours, right?</p>
<p>You designed it.</p>
<p>Now try asking for feedback</p>
<p>and know that you&rsquo;re giving this to your friends</p>
<p>and your family.</p>
<p>People have trouble giving hard feedback.</p>
<p>People have trouble saying, I don&rsquo;t like this</p>
<p>or this isn&rsquo;t great, or this is how it&rsquo;s failed me.</p>
<p>In fact, you usually have two classes of people.</p>
<p>People who just won&rsquo;t say bad things,</p>
<p>you can literally say to them,</p>
<p>please tell me what you hate most about this</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll try, but they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then the other class of people</p>
<p>are just negative period about everything</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to parse out like what is true and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So my rule of thumb with this is</p>
<p>you should always ask people,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s amazing what data</p>
<p>will tell you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why with whatever project I work on, even now,</p>
<p>collecting data from the beginning on usage patterns,</p>
<p>so engagement, how many days of the week do they use it?</p>
<p>How many, I don&rsquo;t know if we were to go back to Instagram,</p>
<p>how many impressions per day, right?</p>
<p>Is that growing?</p>
<p>Is that shrinking?</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t be like overly scientific about it, right?</p>
<p>Cause maybe you have 50 beta users or something.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s fascinating is that data doesn&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>People are very defensive about their time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, oh, I&rsquo;m so busy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t get to use the app.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just, you know,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know you were posting on Instagram</p>
<p>the whole time.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know at the end of the day,</p>
<p>like at Facebook there was, you know,</p>
<p>before time spent became kind of this loaded term there.</p>
<p>The idea that people&rsquo;s currency in their lives is time.</p>
<p>And they only have a certain amount of time to give things,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s friends or family or apps or TV shows</p>
<p>or whatever, there&rsquo;s no way of inventing more of it,</p>
<p>at least not that I know of.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t use it, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s not great.</p>
<p>So the moral of the story is you can ask all you want,</p>
<p>but you just have to look at the data.</p>
<p>And data doesn&rsquo;t lie, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s metrics, there&rsquo;s data can obscure</p>
<p>the key insight if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>
<p>So time spent in the app, that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many metrics you can put at this</p>
<p>and they will give you totally different insights,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re trying to create something</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t obviously exist yet.</p>
<p>So, you know, measuring maybe why you left the app</p>
<p>or measuring special moments of happiness</p>
<p>that will make sure you return to the app</p>
<p>or moments of happiness that are long lasting</p>
<p>versus like dopamine short term, all of those things.</p>
<p>But I think I suppose in the beginning,</p>
<p>you can just get away with just asking the question,</p>
<p>which features are used a lot?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do more of that.</p>
<p>And how hard was the decision?</p>
<p>And I mean, maybe you can tell me what Instagram</p>
<p>looked in the beginning,</p>
<p>but how hard was it to make pictures</p>
<p>of the first class citizen?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a revolutionary idea.</p>
<p>Like at whatever point Instagram became this feed of photos,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quite brilliant.</p>
<p>Plus, I also don&rsquo;t know when this happened,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all shaped the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a&hellip;</p>
<p>I have to tell you why, that&rsquo;s the interesting part.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>So a couple of things.</p>
<p>One is data, like you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You can overinterpret data.</p>
<p>Like imagine trying to fly a plane by staring at,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a single metric like airspeed.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re going up or down.</p>
<p>I mean, it correlates with up or down,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t actually know.</p>
<p>It will never help you land the plane.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t stare at one metric.</p>
<p>Like it turns out you have to synthesize a bunch of metrics</p>
<p>to know where to go.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>Like if your airspeed is zero,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s not working, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s zero, you&rsquo;re probably gonna fall out of the sky.</p>
<p>So generally you look around and you have the scan going.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just asking yourself,</p>
<p>is this working or is this not working?</p>
<p>But people have trouble explaining how they actually feel.</p>
<p>So just, it&rsquo;s about synthesizing both of them.</p>
<p>So then Instagram, right?</p>
<p>We were talking about revolutionary moment</p>
<p>where the feed became square photos basically.</p>
<p>And photos first and then square photos.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was clear to me that the biggest,</p>
<p>so I believe the biggest companies are founded</p>
<p>when enormous technical shifts happen.</p>
<p>And the biggest technical shift that happened</p>
<p>right before Instagram was founded</p>
<p>was the advent of a phone that didn&rsquo;t suck.</p>
<p>The iPhone, right?</p>
<p>Like in retrospect, we&rsquo;re like, oh my God,</p>
<p>the first iPhone that almost had,</p>
<p>like it wasn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>But compared to everything else at the time,</p>
<p>it was amazing.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>the first phone that had an incredible camera</p>
<p>that could like do as well as the point and shoot</p>
<p>you might carry around was the iPhone 4.</p>
<p>And that was right when Instagram launched.</p>
<p>And we looked around and we said,</p>
<p>what will change?</p>
<p>Because everyone has a camera in their pocket.</p>
<p>And it was so clear to me that the world</p>
<p>of social networks before it was based in the desktop</p>
<p>and sitting there and having a link you could share, right?</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t gonna be the case.</p>
<p>So the question is what would you share</p>
<p>if you were out and about in the world?</p>
<p>If not only did you have a camera that fit in your pocket,</p>
<p>but by the way, that camera had a network attached to it</p>
<p>that allowed you to share instantly.</p>
<p>That seemed revolutionary.</p>
<p>And a bunch of people saw it at the same time.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just Instagram.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of competitors.</p>
<p>The thing we did, I think was not only,</p>
<p>well, we focused on two things.</p>
<p>So we wrote down those things, we circled photos</p>
<p>and we said, I think we should invest in this.</p>
<p>But then we said, what sucks about photos?</p>
<p>One, they look like crap, right?</p>
<p>They just, at least back then.</p>
<p>Now my phone takes pretty great photos, right?</p>
<p>Back then they were blurry, not so great, compressed, right?</p>
<p>Two, it was really slow, like really slow to upload a photo.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell a fun story about that</p>
<p>and explain to you why they&rsquo;re all the same size</p>
<p>and square as well.</p>
<p>And three, man, if you wanted to share a photo</p>
<p>on different networks, you had to go to each</p>
<p>of the individual apps and select all of them</p>
<p>and upload individually.</p>
<p>And so we were like, all right, those are the pain points.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna focus on that.</p>
<p>So one, instead of, because they weren&rsquo;t beautiful,</p>
<p>we were like, why don&rsquo;t we lean into the fact</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not beautiful?</p>
<p>And I remember studying in Florence,</p>
<p>my photography teacher gave me this Holga camera</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure everyone knows what a Holga camera is,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re these old school plastic cameras.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re produced in China at the time.</p>
<p>And I wanna say the original ones were like</p>
<p>from the 70s or the 80s or something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to be like $3 cameras for the every person.</p>
<p>They took nice medium format films, large negatives,</p>
<p>but they kind of blurred the light</p>
<p>and they kind of like light leaked into the side.</p>
<p>And there was this whole resurgence where people looked</p>
<p>at that and said, oh my God, this is a style, right?</p>
<p>And I remember using that in Florence and just saying,</p>
<p>well, why don&rsquo;t we just like lean into the fact</p>
<p>that these photos suck and make them suck more,</p>
<p>but in an artistic way.</p>
<p>And it turns out that had product market fit.</p>
<p>People really liked that.</p>
<p>They were willing to share their not so great photos</p>
<p>if they looked not so great on purpose, okay?</p>
<p>The second part.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the filters come into picture.</p>
<p>So computational modification of photos</p>
<p>to make them look extra crappy to where it becomes art.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, add light leaks, add like an overlay filter,</p>
<p>make them more contrasty than they should be.</p>
<p>The first filter we ever produced was called X Pro 2.</p>
<p>And I designed it while I was</p>
<p>in this small little bed and breakfast room</p>
<p>in Todos Santos, Mexico.</p>
<p>I was trying to take a break from the bourbon days.</p>
<p>And I remember saying to my co founder,</p>
<p>I just need like a week to reset.</p>
<p>And that was on that trip worked on the first filter</p>
<p>because I said, you know, I think I can do this.</p>
<p>And I literally iterated one by one over the RGB values</p>
<p>in the array that was the photo and just slightly shifted.</p>
<p>Basically there was a function of R, function of G,</p>
<p>function of B that just shifted them slightly.</p>
<p>It was in rocket science.</p>
<p>And it turns out that actually</p>
<p>made your photo look pretty cool.</p>
<p>It just mapped from one color space to another color space.</p>
<p>It was simple, but it was really slow.</p>
<p>I mean, if you applied a filter,</p>
<p>I think it used to take two or three seconds to render.</p>
<p>Only eventually would I figure out how to do it on the GPU.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even sure it was a GPU, but it was using OpenGL.</p>
<p>But anyway, I would eventually figure that out</p>
<p>and then it would be instant, but it used to be really slow.</p>
<p>By the way, anyone who&rsquo;s watching or listening,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing what you can get away with in a startup</p>
<p>as long as the product outcome is right for the user.</p>
<p>Like you can be slow.</p>
<p>You can be terrible.</p>
<p>You can be, as long as you have product market fit,</p>
<p>people will put up with a lot.</p>
<p>And then the question is just about compressing,</p>
<p>making it more performant over time</p>
<p>so that they get that product market fit instantly.</p>
<p>So fascinating because there&rsquo;s some things</p>
<p>where those three seconds would make or break the app,</p>
<p>but some things you&rsquo;re saying not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know when, it&rsquo;s the problem Spotify solved</p>
<p>for making streaming like work.</p>
<p>And like delays in listening to music is a huge negative,</p>
<p>even like slight delays.</p>
<p>But here you&rsquo;re saying, I mean,</p>
<p>how do you know when those three seconds are okay</p>
<p>or are you just gonna have to try it out?</p>
<p>Because to me, my intuition would be</p>
<p>those three seconds would kill the app.</p>
<p>Like I would try to do the OpenGL thing.</p>
<p>Right, so I wish I were that smart at the time.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t, I just knew how to do what I knew how to do.</p>
<p>And I decided, okay, like,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t I just iterate over the values and change them?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that</p>
<p>compared to the alternatives, no one else used OpenGL.</p>
<p>So everyone else was doing it the dumb way.</p>
<p>And in fact, they were doing it at a high resolution.</p>
<p>Now comes in the small resolution</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a second.</p>
<p>By choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels,</p>
<p>which I believe it was at the time,</p>
<p>we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than our competitors</p>
<p>who were trying to do these enormous output like images.</p>
<p>So instead of taking 20 seconds,</p>
<p>I mean, three seconds feels pretty good, right?</p>
<p>So on a relative basis, we were winning like a lot.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s answer number one.</p>
<p>Answer number two is we actually focused</p>
<p>on latency in the right places.</p>
<p>So we did this really wonderful thing when you uploaded.</p>
<p>So the way it would work is you&rsquo;d take your phone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d take the photo and then you&rsquo;d go to the,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d go to the edit screen where you would caption it.</p>
<p>And on that caption screen, you&rsquo;d start typing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d think, okay, like what&rsquo;s a clever caption?</p>
<p>And I said to Mike, hey, when I worked on the Gmail team,</p>
<p>you know what they did?</p>
<p>When you typed in your username or your email address,</p>
<p>even before you&rsquo;ve entered in your password,</p>
<p>like the probability once you enter in your username</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to actually sign in is extremely high.</p>
<p>So why not just start loading your account</p>
<p>in the background?</p>
<p>Not like sending it down to the desktop,</p>
<p>that would be a security issue,</p>
<p>but like loaded into memory on the server,</p>
<p>like get it ready, prepare it.</p>
<p>I always thought that was so fascinating and unintuitive.</p>
<p>And I was like, Mike, why don&rsquo;t we just do that?</p>
<p>But like, we&rsquo;ll just upload the photo</p>
<p>and like assume you&rsquo;re going to upload the photo.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, forget about it, we&rsquo;ll delete it, right?</p>
<p>So what ended up happening was people would caption</p>
<p>their photo, they&rsquo;d press done or upload</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d see this little progress bar just go foop.</p>
<p>It was lightning fast, okay?</p>
<p>We were no faster than anyone else at the time,</p>
<p>but by choosing 512 by 512 and doing it in the background,</p>
<p>it almost guaranteed that it was done</p>
<p>by the time you captioned.</p>
<p>And everyone when they used it was like,</p>
<p>how the hell is this thing so fast?</p>
<p>But we were slow, we just hid the slowness.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like, these things are just like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a shell game, you&rsquo;re just hiding the latency.</p>
<p>That mattered to people like a lot.</p>
<p>And I think that, so you were willing to put up</p>
<p>with a slow filter if it meant</p>
<p>you could share it immediately.</p>
<p>And of course we added sharing options</p>
<p>which let you distribute it really quickly,</p>
<p>that was the third part.</p>
<p>So latency matters, but relative to what?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some like tricks,</p>
<p>you get around to just hiding the latency.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t know if Spotify starts downloading</p>
<p>the next song eagerly, I&rsquo;m assuming they do.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of ideas here that are not rocket science</p>
<p>that really help.</p>
<p>And all of that was stuff you were explicitly</p>
<p>having a discussion about, like those designs</p>
<p>and you were having like arguments, discussions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it was arguments, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve met my co founder Mike,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a pretty nice guy and he&rsquo;s very reasonable.</p>
<p>And we both just saw eye to eye and we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s like, make this fast or at least seem fast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be great.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think the most contentious thing</p>
<p>and he would say this too initially,</p>
<p>was I was on an iPhone 3G, so like the not so fast one.</p>
<p>And he had a brand new iPhone 4, that was cheap.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>And his feed loaded super smoothly,</p>
<p>like when he would scroll from photo to photo,</p>
<p>buttery smooth, right?</p>
<p>But on my phone, every time you got to a new photo,</p>
<p>it was like, kachunk, kachunk, allocate memory,</p>
<p>like all this stuff, right?</p>
<p>I was like, Mike, that&rsquo;s unacceptable.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, come on, man, just like upgrade your phone.</p>
<p>Basically, he didn&rsquo;t actually say that,</p>
<p>he was nicer than that.</p>
<p>But I could tell he wished like,</p>
<p>I would just stop being cheap and just get a new phone.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s funny is we actually sat there working</p>
<p>on that little detail for a few days before launch.</p>
<p>And that polished experience,</p>
<p>plus the fact that uploading seemed fast</p>
<p>for all these people who didn&rsquo;t have nice phones,</p>
<p>I think meant a lot because far too often,</p>
<p>you see teams focus not on performance,</p>
<p>they focus on what&rsquo;s the cool computer science problem</p>
<p>they can solve, right?</p>
<p>Can we scale this thing to a billion users</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got like a hundred, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You talked about loss function,</p>
<p>so I want to come back to that.</p>
<p>Like the loss function is like,</p>
<p>do you provide a great, happy, magical,</p>
<p>whatever experience for the consumer?</p>
<p>And listen, if it happens to involve something complex</p>
<p>and technical, then great.</p>
<p>But it turns out, I think most of the time,</p>
<p>those experiences are just sitting there waiting to be built</p>
<p>with like not that complex solutions.</p>
<p>But everyone is just like so stuck in their own head</p>
<p>that they have to overengineer everything</p>
<p>and then they forget about the easy stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, also, maybe to flip the loss function there is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to minimize the number of times</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s unpleasant experience, right?</p>
<p>Like the one you mentioned where when you go</p>
<p>to the next photo, it freezes for a little bit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost, as opposed to maximizing pleasure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably easier to minimize the number of like,</p>
<p>the friction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And as we all know, you just make the pleasure negative</p>
<p>and then minimize everything, so.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mapping this all back to neural networks.</p>
<p>But actually, can I say one thing on that,</p>
<p>which is I don&rsquo;t know a lot about machine learning,</p>
<p>but I feel like I&rsquo;ve tried studying a bunch.</p>
<p>That whole idea of reinforcement learning</p>
<p>and planning out more than the greedy single experience,</p>
<p>I think is the closest you can get</p>
<p>to like ideal product design thinking,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not saying,</p>
<p>hey, like, can we have a great experience just this one time?</p>
<p>But like, what is the right way to onboard someone?</p>
<p>What series of experiences correlate most with them</p>
<p>hanging on long term, right?</p>
<p>So not just saying, oh, did the photo load slowly</p>
<p>a couple of times, or did they get a great photo</p>
<p>at the top of their feed?</p>
<p>But like, what are the things that are gonna make</p>
<p>this person come back over the next week,</p>
<p>over the next month?</p>
<p>And as a product designer asking yourself,</p>
<p>okay, I wanna optimize, not just minimize bad experiences</p>
<p>in the short run, but like,</p>
<p>how do I get someone to engage over the next month?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna claim at all that I thought that way</p>
<p>at all at the time, because I certainly didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But if I were going back and giving myself any advice,</p>
<p>it would be thinking, what are those second order effects</p>
<p>that you can create?</p>
<p>And it turns out having your friends on the service</p>
<p>is an enormous win.</p>
<p>So starting with a very small group of people</p>
<p>that produce content that you wanted to see, which we did,</p>
<p>we seeded the community very well, I think.</p>
<p>Ended up mattering, and so.</p>
<p>Yeah, you said that community is one</p>
<p>of the most important things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s from a metrics perspective,</p>
<p>from maybe a philosophy perspective,</p>
<p>building a certain kind of community within the app.</p>
<p>See, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what exactly you meant by that</p>
<p>when I first heard you say that.</p>
<p>Maybe you can elaborate, but as I understand now,</p>
<p>it can literally mean get your friends onto the app.</p>
<p>Yeah, think of it this way.</p>
<p>You can build an amazing restaurant or bar or whatever,</p>
<p>right, but if you show up and you&rsquo;re the only one there,</p>
<p>is it like, does it matter how good the food is?</p>
<p>The drinks, whatever?</p>
<p>No, these are inherently social experiences</p>
<p>that we were working on.</p>
<p>So the idea of having people there,</p>
<p>like you needed to have that,</p>
<p>otherwise it was just a filter out.</p>
<p>But by the way, part of the genius,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say genius, even though it wasn&rsquo;t really genius,</p>
<p>was starting to be marauding as a filter app was awesome.</p>
<p>The fact that you could,</p>
<p>so we talk about single player mode a lot,</p>
<p>which is like, can you play the game alone?</p>
<p>And Instagram, you could totally play alone.</p>
<p>You could filter your photos,</p>
<p>and a lot of people would tell me,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even realize that this thing was a social network</p>
<p>until my friend showed up.</p>
<p>It totally worked as a single player game.</p>
<p>And then when your friends showed up,</p>
<p>all of a sudden it was like,</p>
<p>oh, not only was this great alone,</p>
<p>but now I actually have this trove of photos</p>
<p>that people can look at and start liking,</p>
<p>and then I can like theirs.</p>
<p>And so it was this bootstrap method</p>
<p>of how do you make the thing not suck</p>
<p>when the restaurant is empty?</p>
<p>Yeah, but the thing is, when you say friends,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not necessarily referring to friends</p>
<p>in the physical space.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not bringing your physical friends with you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also making new friends.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re finding new community.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious to me</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost like building any kind of community.</p>
<p>It was both.</p>
<p>And what we learned very early on</p>
<p>was what made Instagram special</p>
<p>and the reason why you would sign up for it</p>
<p>versus say, just sit on Facebook</p>
<p>and look at your friends photos.</p>
<p>Of course we were live,</p>
<p>and of course it was interesting</p>
<p>to see what your friends were doing now.</p>
<p>But the fact that you could connect with people</p>
<p>who like took really beautiful photos in a certain style</p>
<p>all around the world, whether they were travelers,</p>
<p>it was the beginning of the influencer economy.</p>
<p>It was these people</p>
<p>who became professional Instagrammers way back when.</p>
<p>But they took these amazing photos</p>
<p>and some of them were photographers professionally.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you had this moment in the day</p>
<p>when you could open up this app</p>
<p>and sure you could see what your friends were doing,</p>
<p>but also it was like, oh my God,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a beautiful waterfall or oh my God,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize there was that corner of England</p>
<p>or like really cool stuff.</p>
<p>And the beauty about Instagram early on</p>
<p>was that it was international by default.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have to speak English to use it, right?</p>
<p>You could just look at the photos, works great.</p>
<p>We did translate, we had some pretty bad translations,</p>
<p>but we did translate the app.</p>
<p>And even if our translations were pretty poor,</p>
<p>the idea that you could just connect with other people</p>
<p>through their images was pretty powerful.</p>
<p>So how much technical difficulties</p>
<p>there with the programming?</p>
<p>Like what programming language you were talking about?</p>
<p>What was?</p>
<p>Zero, like maybe it was hard for us,</p>
<p>but I mean, there was nothing.</p>
<p>The only thing that was complex about Instagram</p>
<p>at the beginning technically was making it scale.</p>
<p>We were just plain old Objective C for the client.</p>
<p>So it was iPhone only at first?</p>
<p>iPhone only, yep.</p>
<p>As an Android person, I&rsquo;m deeply offended, but go ahead.</p>
<p>This was 2010.</p>
<p>Oh, sure, sure.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Android&rsquo;s getting a lot better, right?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I take it back, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>If I were to do something today,</p>
<p>I think it would be very different</p>
<p>in terms of launch strategy, right?</p>
<p>Android&rsquo;s enormous too.</p>
<p>But anyway, back to that moment,</p>
<p>it was Objective C and then we were Python based,</p>
<p>which is just like, this is before Python was really cool.</p>
<p>Like now it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all these machine learning libraries</p>
<p>like support Python and right.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s super, now it&rsquo;s like cool to be Python.</p>
<p>Back then it was like, oh, Google uses Python.</p>
<p>Like maybe you should use Python.</p>
<p>Facebook was PHP.</p>
<p>Like I had worked at a small startup</p>
<p>of some ex Googlers that used Python.</p>
<p>So we used it and we used a framework called Django,</p>
<p>still exists and people use for basically the backend.</p>
<p>And then you threw a couple interesting things in there.</p>
<p>I mean, we used Postgres, which was kind of fun.</p>
<p>It was a little bit like Hipster database</p>
<p>at the time, right?</p>
<p>Versus MySQL.</p>
<p>MySQL, like everyone used MySQL.</p>
<p>So like using Postgres was like an interesting decision.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But we used it because it had a bunch of geo features</p>
<p>built in because we thought we were gonna be</p>
<p>a check and app, remember?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also super cool now.</p>
<p>So you were into Python before it was cool</p>
<p>and you were into Postgres before it was cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were basically like,</p>
<p>not only Hipster photo company,</p>
<p>Hipster tech company, right?</p>
<p>We also adopted Redis early and like loved it.</p>
<p>I mean, it solves so many problems for us</p>
<p>and turns out that&rsquo;s still pretty cool.</p>
<p>But the programming was very easy.</p>
<p>It was like, sign up a user, have a feed.</p>
<p>There was nothing, no machine learning at all, zero.</p>
<p>Can you get some context?</p>
<p>How many users at each of these stages?</p>
<p>Are we talking about a hundred users, a thousand users?</p>
<p>So the stage I just described,</p>
<p>I mean that technical stack lasted</p>
<p>through probably 50 million users.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, like you can get away with a lot</p>
<p>with a pretty basic stack.</p>
<p>Like I think a lot of startups try to overengineer</p>
<p>their solutions from the beginning to like really scale</p>
<p>and you can get away with a lot.</p>
<p>That being said, most of the first two years of Instagram</p>
<p>was literally just trying to make that stack scale.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t, it was not a Python problem.</p>
<p>It was like literally just like, where do we put the data?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s all coming in too fast.</p>
<p>Like how do we store it?</p>
<p>How do we make sure to be up?</p>
<p>How do we like, how do we make sure we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the right size boxes that they have enough memory?</p>
<p>Those were the issues, but.</p>
<p>Can you speak to the choices you make at that stage</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re growing so quickly?</p>
<p>Do you use something like somebody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>computer infrastructure or do you build in house?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only laughing because we, when we launched</p>
<p>we had a single computer that we had rented</p>
<p>in some color space in LA.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember what it was called.</p>
<p>Cause I thought that&rsquo;s what you did.</p>
<p>When I worked at a company called Odio that became Twitter.</p>
<p>I remember visiting our space in San Francisco.</p>
<p>You walked in, you had to wear the ear things.</p>
<p>It was cold and fans everywhere, right?</p>
<p>And we had to, you know, plug one out, replace one.</p>
<p>And I was the intern, so I just like held things.</p>
<p>But I thought to myself, oh, this is how it goes.</p>
<p>And then I remember being in a VC&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>I think it was a benchmarks office.</p>
<p>And I think we ran into another entrepreneur</p>
<p>and they were like, oh, how are things going?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, ah, you know, try to scale this thing.</p>
<p>And they were like, well, I mean</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you just add more instances?</p>
<p>And I was like, what do you mean?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like instances on Amazon.</p>
<p>I was like, what are those?</p>
<p>And it was this moment where we realized how deep</p>
<p>in it we were because we had no idea that AWS existed</p>
<p>nor should we be using it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that night we went back to the office</p>
<p>and we got on AWS, but we did this really dumb thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so sorry to people listening.</p>
<p>But we brought up an instance, which was our database.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a replacement for our database.</p>
<p>But we had it talking over the public internet</p>
<p>to our little box in LA that was our app server.</p>
<p>Very nice. Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how sophisticated we were.</p>
<p>And obviously that was very, very slow.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t work at all.</p>
<p>I mean, it worked, but didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Only like later that night did we realize</p>
<p>we had to have it all together.</p>
<p>But at least like if you&rsquo;re listening right now</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking, you know, I have no chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start to start, but I have no chance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We did it and we made a bunch</p>
<p>of really dumb mistakes initially.</p>
<p>I think the question is how quickly do you learn</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re making a mistake?</p>
<p>And do you do the right thing immediately right after?</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t pay for those mistakes by failure.</p>
<p>So yeah, how quickly did you fix it?</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to sneak up to this question</p>
<p>of how the hell do you scale the thing?</p>
<p>Other startups, if you have an idea,</p>
<p>how do you scale the thing?</p>
<p>Is it just AWS and you try to write the kind of code</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s easy to spread across a large number of instances,</p>
<p>and then the rest is just put money into it?</p>
<p>Basically, I would say a couple of things.</p>
<p>First off, don&rsquo;t even ask the question,</p>
<p>just find product market fit, duct tape it together, right?</p>
<p>Like if you have to.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a big caveat here, which I want to get to,</p>
<p>but generally all that matters is product market fit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>
<p>If people like your product,</p>
<p>do not worry about when 50,000 people use your product</p>
<p>because you will be happy that you have that problem</p>
<p>when you get there.</p>
<p>I actually can&rsquo;t name many startups</p>
<p>where they go from nothing to something overnight</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t figure out how to scale it.</p>
<p>There are some, but I think nowadays,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, when I say a solved problem,</p>
<p>like there are ways of solving it.</p>
<p>The base case is typically that startups</p>
<p>worry way too much about scaling way too early</p>
<p>and forget that they actually have to make something</p>
<p>that people like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the default mistake case.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ll say is once you start scaling,</p>
<p>I mean, hiring quickly,</p>
<p>people who have seen the game before</p>
<p>and just know how to do it,</p>
<p>it becomes a bit of like, yeah,</p>
<p>just throw instances of the problem, right?</p>
<p>But the last thing I&rsquo;ll say on this</p>
<p>that I think did save us,</p>
<p>we were pretty rigorous about writing tests</p>
<p>from the beginning.</p>
<p>That helped us move very, very quickly</p>
<p>when we wanted to rewrite parts of the product</p>
<p>and know that we weren&rsquo;t breaking something else.</p>
<p>Tests are one of those things where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you go slow to go fast.</p>
<p>And they suck when you have to write them</p>
<p>because you have to figure it out.</p>
<p>And there are always those ones that break</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t want them to break and they&rsquo;re annoying</p>
<p>and it feels like you spent all this time.</p>
<p>But looking back, I think that like longterm optimal,</p>
<p>even with a team of four,</p>
<p>it allowed us to move very, very quickly</p>
<p>because anyone could touch any part of the product</p>
<p>and know that they weren&rsquo;t gonna bring down the site,</p>
<p>or at least in general.</p>
<p>At which point do you know product market fit?</p>
<p>How many users would you say?</p>
<p>Is it all it takes is like 10 people?</p>
<p>Or is it a thousand?</p>
<p>Is it 50,000?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is generally</p>
<p>a question of absolute numbers.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a question of cohorts</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s a question of trends.</p>
<p>So, you know, it depends how big your business is trying</p>
<p>to be, right?</p>
<p>But if I were signing up a thousand people a week</p>
<p>and they all retain,</p>
<p>like the retention curves for those cohorts looked good,</p>
<p>healthy, and even like,</p>
<p>as you started getting more people on the service,</p>
<p>maybe those earlier cohorts started curving up again</p>
<p>because now there are network effects</p>
<p>and their friends are on the service</p>
<p>or totally depends what type of business you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m talking purely social, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an absolute number.</p>
<p>I think it is,</p>
<p>I guess you could call it a marginal number.</p>
<p>So I spent a lot of time when I work with startups</p>
<p>asking them like, okay,</p>
<p>have you looked at that cohort versus this cohort,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s your clients</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s people signing up for the service?</p>
<p>But a lot of people think you just have to hit some mark,</p>
<p>like 10,000 people or 50,000 people,</p>
<p>but really seven ish billion people in the world.</p>
<p>Most people forever will not know about your product.</p>
<p>There are always more people out there to sign up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of how you turn on the spigot, so.</p>
<p>At that stage, early stage yourself,</p>
<p>but also by way of advice,</p>
<p>should you worry about money at all?</p>
<p>How this thing&rsquo;s gonna make money?</p>
<p>Or do you just try to find product market fit</p>
<p>and get a lot of users to enjoy using your thing?</p>
<p>I think it totally depends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an unsatisfying answer.</p>
<p>I was talking with a friend today who,</p>
<p>he was one of our earlier investors and he was saying,</p>
<p>hey, like, have you been doing any angel investing lately?</p>
<p>I said, not really.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like focused on what I wanna do next.</p>
<p>And he said, the number of financings have just gone bonkers.</p>
<p>Like people are throwing money everywhere right now.</p>
<p>And I think the question is,</p>
<p>do you have an inkling of how you&rsquo;re gonna make money?</p>
<p>Or are you really just like waving your hands?</p>
<p>I would not like to be an entrepreneur in the position of,</p>
<p>well, I have no idea how this will eventually make money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>If you are in an area,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say you wanted to start a social network, right?</p>
<p>Not saying this is a good idea, but if you did,</p>
<p>there are only a handful of ways they&rsquo;ve made money</p>
<p>and really only one way they&rsquo;ve made money in the past</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s ads.</p>
<p>So, if you have a service that&rsquo;s amenable to that</p>
<p>and then I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about that</p>
<p>because if you get to the scale,</p>
<p>you can hire some smart people and figure that out.</p>
<p>I do think that is really healthy for a lot of startups</p>
<p>these days, especially the ones doing</p>
<p>like enterprise software, slacks of the world, et cetera,</p>
<p>to be worried about money from the beginning,</p>
<p>but mostly as a way of winning over clients</p>
<p>and having stickiness.</p>
<p>Of course you need to be worried about money,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna also say this again,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s like longterm profitability.</p>
<p>If you have a roadmap to that, then that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re just like, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe never,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re working on this metaverse thing,</p>
<p>I think maybe someday, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like that seems harder to me.</p>
<p>So you have to be as big as Facebook</p>
<p>to like finance that bet, right?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible, you said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not saying it&rsquo;s necessarily a good idea</p>
<p>to launch a social network.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible today,</p>
<p>maybe you can put yourself in those shoes,</p>
<p>to launch a social network that achieves the scale</p>
<p>of a Facebook or a Twitter or an Instagram,</p>
<p>and maybe even greater scale?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>How do you do it?</p>
<p>Asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Yeah, if I knew, I&rsquo;d probably be doing it right now</p>
<p>and not sitting here.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to ask this question.</p>
<p>One is create a totally new product market fit,</p>
<p>create a new market, create something like Instagram did,</p>
<p>which is like create something kind of new,</p>
<p>or literally out compete Facebook at its own thing,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll compete Twitter at its own thing.</p>
<p>The only way to compete now,</p>
<p>if you wanna build a large social network</p>
<p>is to look for the cracks, look for the openings.</p>
<p>No one competed, I mean,</p>
<p>no one competed with the core business of Google.</p>
<p>No one competed with the core business of Microsoft.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go at the big guys</p>
<p>doing exactly what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Instagram didn&rsquo;t win, quote unquote,</p>
<p>because it tried to be a visual Twitter.</p>
<p>Like we spotted things that either Twitter</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t going to do or refuse to do,</p>
<p>images and feed for the longest time, right?</p>
<p>Or that Facebook wasn&rsquo;t doing or not paying attention to</p>
<p>because they were mostly desktop at the time</p>
<p>and we were purely mobile, purely visual.</p>
<p>Often there are opportunities sitting there.</p>
<p>You have to figure out like,</p>
<p>I think like there&rsquo;s a strategy book,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the name,</p>
<p>but talk about moats and just like the best place to play</p>
<p>is where your competitor literally can&rsquo;t pivot</p>
<p>because structurally they&rsquo;re set up not to be there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you win.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s fascinating is like,</p>
<p>do you know how many people were like,</p>
<p>images, Facebook does that, Twitter does that.</p>
<p>I mean, how wrong were they, really wrong?</p>
<p>And these are some of the smartest people</p>
<p>in Silicon Valley, right?</p>
<p>But now Instagram exists for a while.</p>
<p>How is it that Snapchat could then exist?</p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>Like plenty of people would say,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s Facebook, no images.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, Instagram, I&rsquo;ll give you that one.</p>
<p>But wait, now another image based social network</p>
<p>is gonna get really big.</p>
<p>And then TikTok comes along.</p>
<p>Like the prior, so you asked me, is it possible?</p>
<p>The only reason I&rsquo;m answering yes</p>
<p>is because my prior is that it&rsquo;s happened once every,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, three, four or five years consistently.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t imagine there&rsquo;s anything structurally</p>
<p>that would change that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I answer that way.</p>
<p>Not because I know how, I just,</p>
<p>when you see a pattern, you see a pattern</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that&rsquo;s gonna stop.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s subtle too, because like you said,</p>
<p>Snapchat and TikTok,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all doing the same space of things,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something fundamentally different</p>
<p>about like a three second video and a five second video</p>
<p>and a 15 second video and a one minute video</p>
<p>and a one hour video, like fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Fundamentally different.</p>
<p>I mean, I think one of the reasons Snapchat exists</p>
<p>is because Instagram was so focused on posting great,</p>
<p>beautiful manicured versions of yourself throughout time.</p>
<p>And there was this enormous demand of like,</p>
<p>hey, I really like this behavior.</p>
<p>I love using Instagram, but man,</p>
<p>I just like wish I could share something going on in my day.</p>
<p>Do I really have to put it on my profile?</p>
<p>Do I really have to make it last forever?</p>
<p>Do I really, and that opened up a door,</p>
<p>it created a market, right?</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s fascinating is Instagram had an explore page</p>
<p>for the longest time and it was image driven, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s absolutely a behavior where you open up Instagram</p>
<p>and you sit on the explore page all day.</p>
<p>That is effectively TikTok,</p>
<p>but obviously focused on videos.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like you could just put the explore page</p>
<p>in TikTok form and it works.</p>
<p>It had to be video, it had to have music.</p>
<p>These are the hard parts about product development</p>
<p>that are very hard to predict,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all versions of the same thing</p>
<p>with varying, like if you line them up</p>
<p>in a bunch of dimensions, they&rsquo;re just like kind of on,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re different values of the same dimensions,</p>
<p>which is like, I guess, easy to say in retrospect.</p>
<p>But like, if I were an entrepreneur going after that area,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d ask myself like, where&rsquo;s the opening?</p>
<p>What needs to exist because TikTok exists now?</p>
<p>So I wonder how much things that don&rsquo;t yet exist</p>
<p>and can exist is in the space of algorithms,</p>
<p>in the space of recommender systems.</p>
<p>So in the space of how the feed is generated.</p>
<p>So we kind of talk about the actual elements</p>
<p>of the content, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been talking,</p>
<p>the difference between photos,</p>
<p>between short videos, longer videos.</p>
<p>I wonder how much disruption is possible</p>
<p>in the way the algorithms work.</p>
<p>Because a lot of the criticism towards social media</p>
<p>is in the way the algorithms work currently.</p>
<p>And it feels like, first of all,</p>
<p>talking about product market fit,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certainly a hunger for social media algorithms</p>
<p>that do something different.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone, everyone said complaining,</p>
<p>this is hurting me and this is hurting society,</p>
<p>but I keep doing it because I&rsquo;m addicted to it.</p>
<p>And they say, we want something different,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know what.</p>
<p>It feels like just different.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s a hunger for that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s in the space of algorithms.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to disrupt in that space.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I have this thesis that the worst part</p>
<p>about social networks is that they&rsquo;re, is the people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a line that sounds funny, right?</p>
<p>Because like, that&rsquo;s why you call it a social network.</p>
<p>But what does social networks actually do for you?</p>
<p>Like just think, like imagine you were an alien</p>
<p>and you landed and someone says,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s this site, it&rsquo;s a social network.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna tell you what it is,</p>
<p>but just what does it do?</p>
<p>And you have to explain it to them.</p>
<p>It does two things.</p>
<p>One is that people you know and have social ties with</p>
<p>distribute updates through whether it&rsquo;s photos or videos</p>
<p>about their lives so that you don&rsquo;t have to physically</p>
<p>be with them, but you can keep in touch with them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one, that&rsquo;s like a big part of Instagram.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big part of Snap.</p>
<p>It is not part of TikTok at all.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s another big part, which is there&rsquo;s all this</p>
<p>content out in the world that&rsquo;s entertaining,</p>
<p>whether you wanna watch it or you wanna read it.</p>
<p>And matchmaking between content that exists in the world</p>
<p>and people that want that content</p>
<p>turns out to be like a really big business, right?</p>
<p>Search and discovery, which you?</p>
<p>Search and discovery, but my point is it could be video,</p>
<p>it could be text, it could be websites, it could be,</p>
<p>I mean, think back to like dig, right?</p>
<p>Or stumble upon or, right?</p>
<p>Nice, yeah.</p>
<p>But like, what did those do?</p>
<p>Like they basically distributed interesting content</p>
<p>to you, right?</p>
<p>I think the most interesting part or the future</p>
<p>of social networks is going to be making them less social</p>
<p>because I think people are part of the root cause</p>
<p>of the problem.</p>
<p>So for instance, often in recommender systems,</p>
<p>we talk about two stages.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a candidate generation step, which is just like</p>
<p>of our vast trove of stuff that you might wanna see,</p>
<p>what small subset should we pick for you, okay?</p>
<p>Typically that is grabbed from things</p>
<p>your friends have shared, right?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a ranking step which says, okay,</p>
<p>now given these 100, 200 things depends on the network,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s like be really good about ranking them</p>
<p>and generally rank the things up higher</p>
<p>that get the most engagement, right?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the problem with that?</p>
<p>Step one is we&rsquo;ve limited everything you could possibly see</p>
<p>to things that your friends have chosen to share</p>
<p>or maybe not friends, but influencers.</p>
<p>What things do people generally want to share?</p>
<p>They wanna share things that are gonna get likes,</p>
<p>that are gonna show up broadly.</p>
<p>So they tend to be more emotionally driven.</p>
<p>They tend to be more risque or whatever.</p>
<p>So why do we have this problem?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we show people things people have decided</p>
<p>to share and those things self select to being the things</p>
<p>that are most divisive.</p>
<p>So how do you fix that?</p>
<p>Well, what if you just imagine for a second</p>
<p>that why do you have to grab things</p>
<p>from things your friends have shared?</p>
<p>Why not just like grab things?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating to me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about.</p>
<p>And just like, why is it that when you log onto Twitter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just sitting there looking at things from accounts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve followed for whatever reason?</p>
<p>And TikTok I think has done a wonderful job here,</p>
<p>which is like, you can literally be anyone.</p>
<p>And if you produce something fascinating, it&rsquo;ll go viral.</p>
<p>But like, you don&rsquo;t have to be someone that anyone knows.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have built up a giant following.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have paid for followers.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to try to maintain those followers.</p>
<p>You literally just have to produce something interesting.</p>
<p>That is I think the future of social networking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the direction things will head.</p>
<p>And I think what you&rsquo;ll find is it&rsquo;s far less</p>
<p>about people manipulating distribution</p>
<p>and far more about what is like, is this content good?</p>
<p>And good is obviously a vague definition</p>
<p>that we could spend hours on.</p>
<p>But different networks I think will decide</p>
<p>different value functions to decide what is good</p>
<p>and what isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a fascinating direction.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s almost like creating an internet.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what Google did for web pages</p>
<p>that did page rank search.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s discovery, you don&rsquo;t follow anybody on Google</p>
<p>when you use a search engine.</p>
<p>You just discover web pages.</p>
<p>And so what TikTok does is saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start from scratch.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s like start a new internet</p>
<p>and have people discover stuff on that new internet</p>
<p>within a particular kind of pool of people.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s so fascinating about this</p>
<p>is like the field of information retrieval.</p>
<p>Like I always talked about as I was studying this stuff,</p>
<p>it was used the word query and document.</p>
<p>So I was like, why are they saying query and documents?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re literally imagine,</p>
<p>like if you just stop thinking about query</p>
<p>as like literally a search query</p>
<p>and a query could be a person.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of the way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna claim to know how Instagram or Facebook</p>
<p>machine learning works today,</p>
<p>but if you want to find a match for a query,</p>
<p>the query is actually the attributes of the person,</p>
<p>their age, their gender, where they&rsquo;re from,</p>
<p>maybe some kind of summarization of their interests.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a query, right?</p>
<p>And that matches against documents.</p>
<p>And by the way, documents don&rsquo;t have to be texts.</p>
<p>They can be videos, however long.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the limit is on TikTok these days.</p>
<p>They keep changing it.</p>
<p>My point is just, you&rsquo;ve got a query,</p>
<p>which is someone in search of something</p>
<p>that they want to match and you&rsquo;ve got the document</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be text.</p>
<p>It could be anything.</p>
<p>And how do you match make?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of these like,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time thinking about this</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t claim to have mastered it at all,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s so fascinating about where that will go</p>
<p>with new social networks.</p>
<p>See, what I&rsquo;m also fascinated by is metrics</p>
<p>that are different than engagement.</p>
<p>So the other thing from an alien perspective,</p>
<p>what social networks are doing is they,</p>
<p>they in the short term,</p>
<p>bring out different aspects of each human being.</p>
<p>So first, let me say that an algorithm or a social network</p>
<p>for each individual can bring out the best of that person</p>
<p>or the worst of that person,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a bunch of different parts to us,</p>
<p>parts we&rsquo;re proud of that we are,</p>
<p>parts we&rsquo;re not so proud of.</p>
<p>When we look at the big picture of our lives,</p>
<p>when we look back 30 days from now,</p>
<p>am I proud that I said those things or not?</p>
<p>Am I proud that I felt those things?</p>
<p>Am I proud that I experienced or read those things</p>
<p>or thought about those things?</p>
<p>Just in that kind of self reflected kind of way.</p>
<p>And so coupled with that,</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to have different metrics</p>
<p>that are not just about engagement,</p>
<p>but are about long term happiness,</p>
<p>growth of a human being,</p>
<p>where they look back and say,</p>
<p>I am a better human being</p>
<p>for having spent 100 hours on that app.</p>
<p>And that feels like it&rsquo;s actually strongly correlated</p>
<p>with engagement in the long term.</p>
<p>In the short term, it may not be,</p>
<p>but in long term, it&rsquo;s like the same kind of thing</p>
<p>where you really fall in love with the product.</p>
<p>You fall in love with an iPhone,</p>
<p>you fall in love with a car.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes you fall in love</p>
<p>is like really being proud</p>
<p>and just in a self reflected way,</p>
<p>understanding that you&rsquo;re a better human being</p>
<p>for having used the thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what great relationships are made from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like you&rsquo;re hot</p>
<p>and we like being together or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like I&rsquo;m a better human being</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>And that feels like a metric</p>
<p>that could be optimized for by the algorithms.</p>
<p>But anytime I kind of talk about this with anybody,</p>
<p>they seem to say, yeah, okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to get out competed immediately</p>
<p>by the engagement if it&rsquo;s ad driven especially.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I mean, a lot of it&rsquo;s just implementation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say a couple of things.</p>
<p>One is to pull back the curtain on daily meetings</p>
<p>inside of these large social media companies.</p>
<p>A lot of what management,</p>
<p>or at least the people that are tweaking these algorithms</p>
<p>spend their time on are trade offs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s these things called value functions,</p>
<p>which are like, okay,</p>
<p>we can predict the probability that you&rsquo;ll click</p>
<p>on this thing or the probability that you&rsquo;ll share it,</p>
<p>or the probability that you will leave a comment on it</p>
<p>or the probability you&rsquo;ll dwell on it.</p>
<p>Individual actions, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got this neural network</p>
<p>that basically has a bunch of heads at the end</p>
<p>and all of them are between zero and one and great.</p>
<p>They all have values, right?</p>
<p>Or they all have probabilities.</p>
<p>And then in these meetings, what they will do is say,</p>
<p>well, how much do we value a comment versus a click</p>
<p>versus a share versus a,</p>
<p>and then maybe even some downstream thing, right?</p>
<p>That has nothing to do with the item there,</p>
<p>but like driving follows or something.</p>
<p>And what typically happens is they will say,</p>
<p>well, what are our goals for this quarter at the company?</p>
<p>Oh, we wanna drive sharing up, okay.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s turn down these metrics</p>
<p>and turn up these metrics.</p>
<p>And they blend them right into a single scalar</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re trying to optimize.</p>
<p>That is really hard because invariably</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;re solving for, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>something called meaningful interactions, right?</p>
<p>This was the big Facebook pivot.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t actually have any internal knowledge.</p>
<p>Like I wasn&rsquo;t in those meetings,</p>
<p>but at least from what we&rsquo;ve seen over the last month or so,</p>
<p>it seems by actually trying to optimize</p>
<p>for meaningful interactions,</p>
<p>it had all these side effects of optimizing</p>
<p>for these other things.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t claim to fully understand them,</p>
<p>but what I will say is that trade offs abound.</p>
<p>And as much as you&rsquo;d like to solve for one thing,</p>
<p>if you have a network of over a billion people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have unintended consequences either way.</p>
<p>And it gets really hard.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re describing is effectively a value model</p>
<p>that says like, can we capture,</p>
<p>this is the thing that I spent a lot of time thinking about,</p>
<p>like, can you capture utility</p>
<p>in a way that like actually measures someone&rsquo;s happiness</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t just a, what do they call it?</p>
<p>A surrogate problem where you say, well,</p>
<p>kind of think like the more you use the product,</p>
<p>the happier you are.</p>
<p>That was always the argument at Facebook, by the way.</p>
<p>It was like, well, people use it more,</p>
<p>so they must be more happy.</p>
<p>Turns out there are like a lot of things you use more</p>
<p>that make you less happy in the world.</p>
<p>Not talking about Facebook,</p>
<p>just let&rsquo;s think about whether it&rsquo;s gambling or whatever,</p>
<p>like that you can do more of,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make you happier.</p>
<p>So the idea that time equals happiness,</p>
<p>obviously you can&rsquo;t map utility and time together easily.</p>
<p>There are a lot of edge cases.</p>
<p>So when you look around the world and you say,</p>
<p>well, what are all the ways we can model utility?</p>
<p>That is like one of the,</p>
<p>please, if you know someone smart doing this,</p>
<p>introduce me because I&rsquo;m fascinated by it.</p>
<p>And it seems really tough.</p>
<p>But the idea that reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>like everyone interesting I know in machine learning,</p>
<p>like I was really interested in recommender systems</p>
<p>and supervised learning.</p>
<p>And the more I dug into it, I was like,</p>
<p>oh, literally everyone smart</p>
<p>is working on reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Like literally everyone.</p>
<p>You just made people at OpenAI and DeepMind very happy, yes.</p>
<p>But I mean, but what&rsquo;s interesting is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing to train a game and like,</p>
<p>I mean that paper where they just took Atari</p>
<p>and they used a ConvNet to basically just like</p>
<p>train simple actions, mind blowing, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely mind blowing, but it&rsquo;s a game, great.</p>
<p>So now what if you&rsquo;re constructing a feed for a person,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like how can you construct that feed in such a way</p>
<p>that optimizes for a diversity of experience,</p>
<p>a longterm happiness, right?</p>
<p>But that reward function,</p>
<p>it turns out in reinforcement learning again,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve learned, like reward design is really hard.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, like how do you design a scalar reward</p>
<p>for someone&rsquo;s happiness over time?</p>
<p>I mean, do you have to measure dopamine levels?</p>
<p>Like, do you have to?</p>
<p>Well, you have to have a lot more signals</p>
<p>from the human being.</p>
<p>Currently it feels like there&rsquo;s not enough signals</p>
<p>coming from the human being users of this algorithm.</p>
<p>So for reinforcement learning to work well,</p>
<p>you need to have a lot more data.</p>
<p>Needs to have a lot of data.</p>
<p>And that actually is a challenge for anyone</p>
<p>who wants to start something,</p>
<p>which is you don&rsquo;t have a lot of data.</p>
<p>So how do you compete?</p>
<p>But I do think back to your original point,</p>
<p>rethinking the algorithm, rethinking reward functions,</p>
<p>rethinking utility, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an open opportunity</p>
<p>for a company that figures it out.</p>
<p>I have to ask about April, 2012,</p>
<p>when Instagram, along with its massive employee base</p>
<p>of 13 people was sold to Facebook for $1 billion.</p>
<p>What was the process like on a business level,</p>
<p>engineering level, human level?</p>
<p>What was that process of selling to Facebook like?</p>
<p>What did it feel like?</p>
<p>So I want to provide some context,</p>
<p>which is I worked in corporate development at Google,</p>
<p>which not a lot of people know,</p>
<p>but corporate development is effectively the group</p>
<p>that buys companies, right?</p>
<p>You sit there and you acquire companies.</p>
<p>And I had sat through so many of these meetings</p>
<p>with entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>We actually, fun fact, we never acquired a single company</p>
<p>when I worked in corporate development.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t claim that I had like a lot of experience,</p>
<p>but I had enough experience to understand,</p>
<p>okay, like what prices are people getting</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the process?</p>
<p>And as we started to grow,</p>
<p>we were trying to keep this thing running</p>
<p>and we were exhausted and we were 13 people.</p>
<p>And I mean, we were trying to think back,</p>
<p>it was probably 27, 37 now,</p>
<p>so young on a relative basis, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to keep the thing running.</p>
<p>And then we go out to raise money</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re kind of like the hot startup at the time.</p>
<p>And I remember going into a specific VC and saying,</p>
<p>our terms we&rsquo;re looking for are,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking for a $500 million valuation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never seen so many jaws drop all in unison, right?</p>
<p>And I was like, thanked and walked out the door</p>
<p>very kindly after.</p>
<p>And then I got a call the next day</p>
<p>from someone who was connected to them.</p>
<p>And they said, we just wanna let you know</p>
<p>that like it was pretty offensive</p>
<p>that you asked for a $500 million valuation.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t tell if that was like just negotiating or what,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s true, like no one offered us more, right?</p>
<p>So we were&hellip;</p>
<p>So can you clarify the number again?</p>
<p>You said how many million?</p>
<p>500.</p>
<p>500 million.</p>
<p>500 million, yeah, half a billion.</p>
<p>So in my mind, I&rsquo;m anchored like, okay,</p>
<p>well, literally no one&rsquo;s biting at 500 million.</p>
<p>And eventually we would get Sequoia and Greylock</p>
<p>and others together at 500 million, basically, post.</p>
<p>It was 450 pre, I think we raised $50 million.</p>
<p>But just like no one was used to seeing</p>
<p>a $500 million companies then.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if it was because we were just coming</p>
<p>out of the hangover of 2008</p>
<p>and things were still on recovery mode.</p>
<p>But then along comes Facebook.</p>
<p>And after some negotiation, we&rsquo;ve two X to the number</p>
<p>from a half a billion to a billion.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems pretty good.</p>
<p>And I think Mark and I really saw eye to eye</p>
<p>that this thing could be big.</p>
<p>We thought we could&hellip;</p>
<p>Their resources would help us scale it.</p>
<p>And in a lot of ways it de risks.</p>
<p>I mean, it de risks a lot of the employees lives</p>
<p>for the rest of their lives,</p>
<p>including me, including Mike, right?</p>
<p>I think I might&rsquo;ve had like 10 grand</p>
<p>in my bank account at the time, right?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re working hard, we had nothing.</p>
<p>So on a relative basis, it seems very high.</p>
<p>And then I think the last company to exit</p>
<p>for anywhere close to a billion was YouTube</p>
<p>that I could think of.</p>
<p>And thus began the giant long bull run of 2012</p>
<p>to all the way to where we are now,</p>
<p>where I saw some stat yesterday</p>
<p>about like how many unicorns exist and it&rsquo;s absurd.</p>
<p>But then again, never underestimate technology</p>
<p>and like the value it can provide.</p>
<p>And man, costs have dropped and man scale has increased.</p>
<p>And you can make businesses make a lot of money now.</p>
<p>But on a fundamental level, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like how do you describe the decision</p>
<p>to sell a company with 13 people for a billion dollars?</p>
<p>So first of all, like how did it take a lot of guts</p>
<p>to sit at a table and say 500 million</p>
<p>or 1 billion with Mark Zuckerberg?</p>
<p>It seems like a very large number with 13.</p>
<p>Like, especially&hellip;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem, it is.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all large numbers.</p>
<p>Especially like you said before the unicorn parade.</p>
<p>I like that, I&rsquo;m gonna use that.</p>
<p>The unicorn parade?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You were at the head of the unicorn parade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, yeah, it&rsquo;s a massive unicorn parade.</p>
<p>Okay, so no, I mean, we knew we were worth</p>
<p>quote unquote a lot, but we didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, there was no market for Instagram.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not, you couldn&rsquo;t mark to market this thing</p>
<p>in the public markets.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t quite understand what it would be worth</p>
<p>or was worth at the time.</p>
<p>So in a market, an illiquid market</p>
<p>where you have one buyer and one seller</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going back and forth,</p>
<p>and well, I guess there were like VC firms</p>
<p>who were willing to invest at a certain valuation.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, you just go with your gut.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, I would say</p>
<p>the hardest part of it was not realizing,</p>
<p>like when we sold, it was tough</p>
<p>because like literally everywhere I go,</p>
<p>restaurants, whatever, like for a good six months after,</p>
<p>there was a lot of attention on the deal,</p>
<p>a lot of attention on the product,</p>
<p>a lot of attention, it was kind of miserable, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, wait, like I made a lot of money,</p>
<p>but like, why is this not great?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because it turns out,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like I don&rsquo;t really keep in touch with Mark,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve got to assume his job right now</p>
<p>is not exactly the most happy job in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough when you&rsquo;re on top</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really tough when you&rsquo;re in the limelight.</p>
<p>So the decision itself was like, oh, cool, this is great.</p>
<p>How lucky are we, right?</p>
<p>So, okay, there&rsquo;s a million question I want to ask.</p>
<p>Yeah, go, go, go.</p>
<p>First of all, why is it hard to be on top?</p>
<p>Why did you not feel good?</p>
<p>Like, can you dig into that?</p>
<p>It always, I&rsquo;ve heard like Olympic athletes say</p>
<p>after they win gold, they get depressed.</p>
<p>Is it something like that where it feels like</p>
<p>it was kind of like a thing you were working towards?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Some loose definition of success.</p>
<p>And this sure as heck feels like</p>
<p>at least according to other startups,</p>
<p>this is what success looks like.</p>
<p>And now why don&rsquo;t I feel any better?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still human, I still have all the same problems.</p>
<p>Is that the nature?</p>
<p>Or is it just like negative attention of some kind?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all of the above.</p>
<p>But to be clear, there was a lot of happiness</p>
<p>in terms of like, oh my God, this is great.</p>
<p>Like we won the Super Bowl of startups, right?</p>
<p>Anyone who can get to a liquidity event</p>
<p>of anything meaningful feels like,</p>
<p>wow, this is what we started out to do.</p>
<p>Of course we want to create great things that people love,</p>
<p>but like we won in a big way.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s this big like,</p>
<p>oh, if we won, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>So they call it the we have arrived syndrome,</p>
<p>which I need to go back and look where I can quote that from.</p>
<p>But I remember reading about it at the time.</p>
<p>I was like, oh yeah, that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And I remember we had a product manager leave very early on</p>
<p>when we got to Facebook.</p>
<p>And he said to me,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t believe I can learn anything</p>
<p>at this company anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s hit its apex.</p>
<p>We sold it great.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t have anything else to learn.</p>
<p>So from 2012 all the way to the day I left in 2018,</p>
<p>like the amount I learned and the humility</p>
<p>with which I realized, oh, we thought we won.</p>
<p>Billion dollars is cool,</p>
<p>but like there are a hundred billion dollar companies.</p>
<p>And by the way, on top of that, we had no revenue.</p>
<p>We had, I mean, we had a cool product,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t scale it yet.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much to learn.</p>
<p>And then competitors and how fun was it to fight Snapchat?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Like it was, it&rsquo;s like Yankees Red Sox.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what you live for.</p>
<p>You know, you win some, you lose some,</p>
<p>but the amount you can learn through that process,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve realized in life is that there is no,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s always someone who has more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always more challenge, just at different scales.</p>
<p>And it sounds like a little Buddhist,</p>
<p>but everything is super challenging,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re like a small business</p>
<p>or an enormous business.</p>
<p>I say like choose the game you like to play, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to imagine that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an amazing basketball player,</p>
<p>you enjoy to some extent practicing basketball.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be something you love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna suck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be hard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have injuries, right?</p>
<p>But you gotta love it.</p>
<p>And the same thing with Instagram,</p>
<p>which is we might&rsquo;ve sold, but it was like, great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one Super Bowl title.</p>
<p>Can we win five?</p>
<p>What else can we do?</p>
<p>Now I imagine you didn&rsquo;t ask this, but okay, so I left.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of like, what do you do next, right?</p>
<p>Like, how do you top that thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the wrong question.</p>
<p>The question is like, when you wake up every day,</p>
<p>what is the hardest, most interesting thing</p>
<p>you can go work on?</p>
<p>Because like at the end of the day,</p>
<p>we all turn into dirt, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, right?</p>
<p>But what does matter is like,</p>
<p>can we really enjoy this life?</p>
<p>Not in a hedonistic way, because that&rsquo;s those,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>learning like short term versus long term objectives.</p>
<p>Can you wake up every day and truly enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>knowing that it&rsquo;s gonna be painful?</p>
<p>Knowing that like, no matter what you choose,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be painful.</p>
<p>Whether you sit on a beach</p>
<p>or whether you manage a thousand people or 10,000,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be painful.</p>
<p>So choose something that&rsquo;s fun to have pain.</p>
<p>But yes, there was a lot of, we have arrived</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a maturation process you just have to go through.</p>
<p>So no matter how much success there is,</p>
<p>how much money you make,</p>
<p>you have to wake up the next day and choose the hard life,</p>
<p>whatever that means next, that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>The fun slash hard life, hard life that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is slightly different,</p>
<p>which is just that no one realizes</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s gonna be hard.</p>
<p>Even chilling out is hard.</p>
<p>And then you just start worrying about stupid stuff.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, like did so and so</p>
<p>forget to paint the house today</p>
<p>or like did the gardener come or whatever?</p>
<p>Like, or, oh, I&rsquo;m so angry</p>
<p>and my shipment of wine didn&rsquo;t show up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sitting here on the beach without my wine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m making shit up now, but like.</p>
<p>It turns out that even chilling, AKA meditation,</p>
<p>is hard work.</p>
<p>Yeah, and at least meditation is like productive chilling</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like actually training yourself</p>
<p>to calm down and be, but backing up for a moment,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>You might as well be like playing the game you love to play.</p>
<p>I just like playing and winning and I&rsquo;m on the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on the, I think the first half of life,</p>
<p>knock on wood, and I&rsquo;ve got a lot of years</p>
<p>and what am I gonna do, sit around?</p>
<p>And the other way of looking at this, by the way,</p>
<p>imagine you made one movie and it was great.</p>
<p>Would you just like stop making movies?</p>
<p>No, generally you&rsquo;re like, wow,</p>
<p>I really like making movies, let&rsquo;s make another one.</p>
<p>A lot of times, by the way,</p>
<p>the second one or the third one, not that great,</p>
<p>but the fourth one, awesome.</p>
<p>And no one forgets the second,</p>
<p>or everyone forgets the second and the third one.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just this constant process of like,</p>
<p>can I produce and is that fun?</p>
<p>Is that exciting?</p>
<p>What else can I learn?</p>
<p>So this machine learning stuff for me</p>
<p>has been this awesome new chapter of being like,</p>
<p>man, that&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t understand at all.</p>
<p>And now I feel like I&rsquo;m one 10th of the way there.</p>
<p>And that feels like a big mountain to climb.</p>
<p>So I distracted us from the original question.</p>
<p>No, and we&rsquo;ll return to the machine learning</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;d love to explore your interest there.</p>
<p>But I mean, speaking of sort of challenges and hard things,</p>
<p>is there a possible world</p>
<p>where sitting in a room with Mark Zuckerberg</p>
<p>with a $1 billion deal, you turn it down?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>What does that world look like?</p>
<p>Why would you turn it down?</p>
<p>Why did you take it?</p>
<p>What was the calculation that you were making?</p>
<p>Thus enters the world of counterfactuals</p>
<p>and not really knowing.</p>
<p>And if only we could run that experiment.</p>
<p>Well, the universe exists,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just running in parallel to our own.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s so fascinating, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking a lot about money,</p>
<p>but the real question was,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;ll believe me when I say this,</p>
<p>but could we strap our little company</p>
<p>onto the side of a rocket ship</p>
<p>and like get out to a lot of people really, really quickly</p>
<p>with the support, with the talent of a place like Facebook?</p>
<p>I mean, people often ask me what I would do differently</p>
<p>at Instagram today.</p>
<p>And I say, well, I&rsquo;d probably hire more carefully</p>
<p>because we showed up just like before I knew it,</p>
<p>we had like a hundred people on the team</p>
<p>and 200, then 300.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where all these people were coming from.</p>
<p>I never had to recruit them.</p>
<p>I never had to screen them.</p>
<p>They were just like internal transfers, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like relying on the Facebook hiring machine,</p>
<p>which is quite sort of, I mean, it&rsquo;s an elaborate machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great, by the way.</p>
<p>They have really talented people there.</p>
<p>But my point is the choice was like, take this thing,</p>
<p>put it on the side of a rocket ship</p>
<p>that you know is growing very quickly.</p>
<p>Like I had seen what had happened</p>
<p>when Ev sold Blogger to Google and then Google went public.</p>
<p>Remember we sold before Facebook went public.</p>
<p>There was a moment at which the stock price was $17,</p>
<p>by the way, Facebook stock price was $17.</p>
<p>I remember thinking, what the fuck did I just do, right?</p>
<p>Now at 320 ish, I don&rsquo;t know where we are today.</p>
<p>But like, okay, like the best thing by the way</p>
<p>is like when the stock is down, everyone calls you a dope.</p>
<p>And then when it&rsquo;s up, they also call you a dope,</p>
<p>but just for a different reason, right?</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Less than in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but you know, the choice is to strap yourself</p>
<p>to a rocket ship or to build your own.</p>
<p>You know, Mr. Elon built his own</p>
<p>literally with a rocket ship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a difficult choice because there&rsquo;s a world.</p>
<p>Actually, I would say something different,</p>
<p>which is Elon and others decided to sell PayPal</p>
<p>for not that much.</p>
<p>I mean, how much was it about a billion dollars?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Something like that, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it was early and,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s worth a lot more now.</p>
<p>To then build a new rocket ship.</p>
<p>So this is the cool part, right?</p>
<p>If you are an entrepreneur</p>
<p>and you own a controlling stake in the company,</p>
<p>not only is it really hard to do something else</p>
<p>with your life because all of the, you know,</p>
<p>value is tied up in you as a personality</p>
<p>attached to this company, right?</p>
<p>But if you sell it and you&rsquo;re getting yourself enough capital</p>
<p>and you like have enough energy,</p>
<p>you can do another thing or 10 other things</p>
<p>or in Elon&rsquo;s case, like a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like I lost count at this point.</p>
<p>And it might&rsquo;ve seemed silly at the time.</p>
<p>And sure, like if you look back,</p>
<p>man, PayPal is worth a lot now, right?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like, do you think Elon like cares about like,</p>
<p>are we gonna buy Pinterest or not?</p>
<p>Like, I just, he is,</p>
<p>he created a massive capital</p>
<p>that allowed him to do what he wants to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more freeing than anything</p>
<p>because when you are an entrepreneur attached to a company,</p>
<p>you gotta stay at that company for a really long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to remove yourself.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure how much he loved</p>
<p>PayPal versus SpaceX and Tesla.</p>
<p>I have a sense that you love Instagram.</p>
<p>Yeah, I loved enough to like work</p>
<p>for six years beyond the deal.</p>
<p>Which is rare, which is very rare.</p>
<p>You chose.</p>
<p>But can I tell you why?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, please.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of companies that you can be part of</p>
<p>where the Pope&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I would like to sign up for your product.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not a religious person at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You go to the Vatican and you&rsquo;re like walking</p>
<p>among giant columns and you&rsquo;re hearing the music</p>
<p>and everything and like the Pope walks in</p>
<p>and he wants to press the signup button on your product.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a moment in life, okay?</p>
<p>No matter what your persuasion, okay?</p>
<p>The number of doors and experiences that that opened up</p>
<p>was, it was incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, the people I got to meet, the places I got to go,</p>
<p>I assume maybe like a payments company</p>
<p>is slightly different, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why, like it was so fun.</p>
<p>And plus I truly believed we were building</p>
<p>such a great product and I loved, loved the game.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t about money.</p>
<p>It was about the game.</p>
<p>Do you think you had the guts to say no?</p>
<p>Is that, so here&rsquo;s, I often think about this,</p>
<p>like how hard is it for an entrepreneur to say no?</p>
<p>Because the peer pressure.</p>
<p>So every, like basically the sea of entrepreneurs</p>
<p>in Silicon Valley are gonna tell you,</p>
<p>I mean, this is their dream.</p>
<p>The thing you were sitting before is a dream.</p>
<p>To walk away from that is really,</p>
<p>it seems like nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Because Instagram could in 10 years be,</p>
<p>you could talk about Google.</p>
<p>You could be making self driving cars</p>
<p>and building rockets that go to Mars</p>
<p>and compete with SpaceX.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an interesting decision to say,</p>
<p>am I willing to risk it?</p>
<p>And the reason I also say it&rsquo;s an interesting decision</p>
<p>because it feels like per our previous discussion,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re launching a social network company,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be that meeting, whatever that number is.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re successful, if you&rsquo;re on this rocket ship</p>
<p>of success, there&rsquo;s going to be a meeting</p>
<p>with one of the social media, social network companies</p>
<p>that wanna buy you, whether it&rsquo;s Facebook or Twitter,</p>
<p>but it could also very well be Google</p>
<p>who seems to have like a graveyard</p>
<p>of failed social networks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think about that, how difficult it is</p>
<p>for an entrepreneur to make that decision.</p>
<p>How many have successfully made that decision?</p>
<p>I guess, this is a big question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad to me, to be honest,</p>
<p>that too many make that decision,</p>
<p>perhaps for the wrong reason.</p>
<p>Sorry, when you say make the decision,</p>
<p>you mean to the affirmative.</p>
<p>To the affirmative, yeah.</p>
<p>Got it, yeah.</p>
<p>There are also companies that don&rsquo;t sell, right?</p>
<p>And take the PATH and say, we&rsquo;re gonna be independent.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve never heard of them again.</p>
<p>Like I remember PATH, right?</p>
<p>Was one of our competitors early on.</p>
<p>There was a big moment when they had,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what it was,</p>
<p>like $110 million offer from Google or something.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve been larger, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I remember there was like this big TechCrunch article</p>
<p>that was like, they turned it down after talking deeply</p>
<p>about their values and everything.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know the inner workings of Foursquare,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m certain there were many conversations over time</p>
<p>where there were companies that wanted Foursquare as well.</p>
<p>Recently, I mean, what other companies?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Clubhouse, right?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe people were really interested in them too.</p>
<p>Like there are plenty of moments where people say no</p>
<p>and we just forget that those things happen.</p>
<p>We only focus on the ones where like they said yes</p>
<p>and like, wow, like what if they had stayed independent?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I used to think a lot about this and now I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, whatever.</p>
<p>Things have gone pretty well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready for the next game.</p>
<p>I mean, think about an athlete where, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe they do something wrong in the World Series</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>If you let it haunt you for the rest of your career,</p>
<p>like why not just be like, I don&rsquo;t know, it was a game.</p>
<p>Next game, next shot, right?</p>
<p>And if you just move to that world,</p>
<p>like at least I have a next shot, right?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s beautiful, but I mean, just insights</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny you brought up Clubhouse.</p>
<p>It is very true.</p>
<p>It seems like Clubhouse is on the downward path</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very possible to see a billion plus dollar deal</p>
<p>at some stage, maybe like a year ago or half a year ago</p>
<p>from Facebook, from Google.</p>
<p>I think Facebook was flirting with that idea too.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of companies probably were.</p>
<p>I wish it was more public.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not like a bad public story</p>
<p>about them making the decision to walk away.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t hear about it.</p>
<p>And then we get to see the results of that success</p>
<p>or the failure, more often failure.</p>
<p>So a couple of things, one is,</p>
<p>I would not assume Clubhouse is down for the count at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re young, they have plenty of money,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re run by really smart people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d give them like a very fighting chance to figure it out.</p>
<p>There are a lot of times when people call Twitter</p>
<p>down for the count and they figure it out</p>
<p>and they seem to be doing well, right?</p>
<p>So just backing up like,</p>
<p>and not knowing anything about their internals,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a strong chance they will figure it out</p>
<p>and that people are just down</p>
<p>because they like being down about companies.</p>
<p>They like assuming that they&rsquo;re gonna fail.</p>
<p>So who knows, right?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s take the ones in the past</p>
<p>where like we know how it played out.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples</p>
<p>where people have turned down big offers</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve just never heard from them again,</p>
<p>but we never focus on the companies</p>
<p>because you just forget that those were big.</p>
<p>But inside your psyche,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easy for someone with enough money</p>
<p>to say money doesn&rsquo;t matter, which I think is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>Of course, money matters to people, but at the moment,</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t even grasp like the number of zeros</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense, right?</p>
<p>So to think rationally in that moment</p>
<p>is not something many people are equipped to do,</p>
<p>especially not people</p>
<p>where I think we had founded the company a year earlier,</p>
<p>maybe two years earlier, like a year and a half,</p>
<p>we were 13 people, but I will say,</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know if it was the right decision</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have that counterfactual.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that other world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just thankful that by and large,</p>
<p>most people love Instagram, still do.</p>
<p>By and large, people are very happy</p>
<p>with like the time we had there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m proud of what we built.</p>
<p>So like, I&rsquo;m cool.</p>
<p>Like now it&rsquo;s next shot, right?</p>
<p>Well, if we could just linger on this Yankees versus Red Sox,</p>
<p>the fun of it, the competition over,</p>
<p>I would say over the space of features.</p>
<p>So there are a bunch of features,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s photos, there&rsquo;s one minute videos on Instagram,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s IGTV, there&rsquo;s stories, there&rsquo;s reels, there&rsquo;s live.</p>
<p>So that sounds like it&rsquo;s like a long list</p>
<p>of too much stuff, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>because it feels like they&rsquo;re close together,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re somehow, like what we&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>fundamentally distinct,</p>
<p>like each of the things I mentioned.</p>
<p>Maybe can you describe the philosophies,</p>
<p>the design philosophies behind some of these,</p>
<p>how you were thinking about it</p>
<p>during the historic war between Snapchat and Instagram</p>
<p>or just in general,</p>
<p>like this space of features that was discovered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this great book by Clay Christensen</p>
<p>called, Competing Against Luck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a terrible title,</p>
<p>but within it, there&rsquo;s effectively an expression</p>
<p>of this thing called jobs to be done theory.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unclear if like he came up with it</p>
<p>or some of his colleagues,</p>
<p>but there are a bunch of places you can find</p>
<p>with people claiming to have come up</p>
<p>with this jobs to be done theory.</p>
<p>But the idea is if you like zoom out</p>
<p>and you look at your product,</p>
<p>you ask yourself, why are people hiring your product?</p>
<p>Like imagine every product in your life</p>
<p>is effectively an employee, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re CEO of your life</p>
<p>and you hire products to be employees effectively.</p>
<p>They all have roles and jobs, right?</p>
<p>Why are you hiring a product?</p>
<p>Why do you want that product</p>
<p>to perform something in your life?</p>
<p>And like, what are the hidden reasons</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re in love with this product?</p>
<p>Instagram was about sharing your life</p>
<p>with others visually, period, right?</p>
<p>Why? Because you feel connected with them.</p>
<p>You get to show off.</p>
<p>You get to feel good and cared about, right?</p>
<p>With likes and it turns out that that will,</p>
<p>I think forever define Instagram</p>
<p>and any product that serves that job</p>
<p>is going to do very well, okay?</p>
<p>Stories let&rsquo;s take as an example</p>
<p>is very much serving that job.</p>
<p>In fact, it serves it better than the original product</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re large and have an enormous audience,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worried about people seeing your stuff</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re worried about being permanent</p>
<p>so that a college admissions person</p>
<p>is going to see your photo of you doing something.</p>
<p>And so it turns out that that is a more efficient way</p>
<p>of performing that job than the original product was.</p>
<p>The original product still has its value,</p>
<p>but at scale, these two things together</p>
<p>work really, really well.</p>
<p>Now, I will claim that other parts of the product</p>
<p>over time didn&rsquo;t perform that job as well.</p>
<p>I think IGTV probably didn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Shopping is like completely unrelated</p>
<p>to what I just described, but it might work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>Products I think, products that succeed</p>
<p>are products that all share this parent node</p>
<p>of like this job to be done that is in common.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re just like different ways of doing it, right?</p>
<p>Apple, I think does a great job with this, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like managing your digital life</p>
<p>and all the products just work together.</p>
<p>They sync, they&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s beautiful, right?</p>
<p>Even if they require like silly specific cords to work,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all part of a system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you leave that system</p>
<p>and you start doing something weird</p>
<p>that people start scratching their head</p>
<p>and I think you are less successful.</p>
<p>So I think one of the challenges</p>
<p>Facebook has had throughout its life</p>
<p>is that it has never fully, I think,</p>
<p>appreciated the job to be done of the main product.</p>
<p>And what it&rsquo;s done is said,</p>
<p>ooh, there&rsquo;s a shiny object over there.</p>
<p>That startup&rsquo;s getting some traction.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go copy that thing.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re confused why it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Like why doesn&rsquo;t it work?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the people who show up for this</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want that, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose of Facebook?</p>
<p>So I remember I was a very early Facebook user.</p>
<p>The reason I was personally excited about Facebook</p>
<p>is because you can, first of all, use your real name.</p>
<p>Like I can exist in this world.</p>
<p>It can be like formally exist.</p>
<p>I like anonymity for certain things, Reddit and so on,</p>
<p>but I want it to also exist not anonymously</p>
<p>so that I can connect with other friends of mine</p>
<p>nonanonymously and there&rsquo;s a reliable way to know</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m real and they&rsquo;re real and that we&rsquo;re connecting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like, I liked it for the reasons</p>
<p>that people like LinkedIn, I guess.</p>
<p>But like without the form, like not everybody is dressed up</p>
<p>and being super polite, like more like with friends.</p>
<p>But then it became something much bigger than that,</p>
<p>I suppose, there&rsquo;s a feed.</p>
<p>It became this, I mean, it became a place</p>
<p>to discover content, to share content</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just about connecting directly with friends.</p>
<p>I mean, it became something else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what it is really.</p>
<p>So you said Instagram is a place</p>
<p>where you visually share your life.</p>
<p>What is Facebook?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go back to the founding of Facebook</p>
<p>and why it worked really well initially at Harvard</p>
<p>and then Dartmouth and Stanford and I can&rsquo;t remember,</p>
<p>probably MIT, there were like a handful of schools</p>
<p>in that first tranche, right?</p>
<p>It worked because there are communities</p>
<p>that exist in the world that want to transact.</p>
<p>And when I say transact, I don&rsquo;t mean commercially,</p>
<p>I just mean they want to share, they want to coordinate,</p>
<p>they want to communicate, they want a space for themselves.</p>
<p>And Facebook at its best, I think is that.</p>
<p>And if actually you look at the most popular products</p>
<p>that Facebook has built over time,</p>
<p>if you look at things like groups, marketplace,</p>
<p>groups is enormous.</p>
<p>And groups is effectively like everyone can found</p>
<p>their own little Stanford or Dartmouth or MIT, right?</p>
<p>And find each other and share and communicate</p>
<p>about something that matters deeply to them.</p>
<p>That is the core of what Facebook was built around.</p>
<p>And I think today is where it stands most strongly.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>The groups, I wish groups were done better.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s not a first class citizen.</p>
<p>I know I may be saying something without much knowledge,</p>
<p>but it feels like it&rsquo;s kind of bolted on</p>
<p>while being used a lot.</p>
<p>It feels like there needs to be a little bit more structure</p>
<p>in terms of discovery, in terms of like.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Reddit.</p>
<p>Like Reddit is basically groups of public and open</p>
<p>and a little bit crazy, right?</p>
<p>In a good way.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s clear product market fit</p>
<p>for that specific use case.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a college, it can be anything.</p>
<p>It can be a small group, a big group,</p>
<p>it can be group messaging.</p>
<p>Facebook shines, I think, when it leans into that.</p>
<p>I think when there are other companies</p>
<p>that just seem exciting and now all of a sudden</p>
<p>the product shifts in some fundamental way</p>
<p>to go try to compete with that other thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I think consumers get confused.</p>
<p>Even if you can be successful,</p>
<p>like even if you can compete with that other company,</p>
<p>even if you can figure out how to bolt it on,</p>
<p>eventually you come back and you look at the app</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, I just don&rsquo;t know why I opened this app.</p>
<p>Like why, like too many things going on.</p>
<p>And that was always a worry.</p>
<p>I mean, you listed all the things at Instagram</p>
<p>and it almost gave me a heart attack,</p>
<p>like way too many things.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, entrepreneurs get bored.</p>
<p>They want to add things.</p>
<p>They want to like, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a good answer for it,</p>
<p>except for that I think being true to your original use case</p>
<p>and not even original use case,</p>
<p>but sorry, actually not use case, original job.</p>
<p>There are many use cases under that job.</p>
<p>Being true to that and like being really good at it</p>
<p>over time and morphing as needs change,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how to make a company last forever.</p>
<p>And I mean, honestly, like my main thesis</p>
<p>about why Facebook is in the position it is today</p>
<p>is if they have had a series of product launches</p>
<p>that delighted people over time,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;d be in a totally different world.</p>
<p>So just like imagine for a moment,</p>
<p>and by the way, Apple&rsquo;s entering this,</p>
<p>but like Apple for so long,</p>
<p>just like product after product,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t wait for it.</p>
<p>You stood in line for it.</p>
<p>You talked about it.</p>
<p>You got excited.</p>
<p>Amazon makes your life so easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, I needed this thing</p>
<p>and it showed up at my door two days later.</p>
<p>And like both of these companies, by the way,</p>
<p>Amazon, Apple have issues, right?</p>
<p>There are labor issues,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s here in the US or in China,</p>
<p>there are environmental issues.</p>
<p>But like when&rsquo;s the last time</p>
<p>you heard like a large chorus being like,</p>
<p>these companies better pay</p>
<p>for what they&rsquo;re doing on these things, right?</p>
<p>I think Facebook&rsquo;s main issue today is like,</p>
<p>you need to produce a hit.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t produce hits,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to keep consumers on your side.</p>
<p>Then people just start picking on you</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons, whether it&rsquo;s right or wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even going to place a judgment</p>
<p>right here and right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to say that it is way better</p>
<p>to be in a world where you are producing hits</p>
<p>and consumers love what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>because then they&rsquo;re on your side.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the past 10 years</p>
<p>for Facebook has been fairly hard on this dimension.</p>
<p>So, and by hits, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean financial hits.</p>
<p>It feels like to me, what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is something that brings joy.</p>
<p>A product that brings joy</p>
<p>to some fraction of the population.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, TikTok isn&rsquo;t just literally an algorithm.</p>
<p>In some ways, TikTok&rsquo;s content and algorithm</p>
<p>have more sway now over the American psyche</p>
<p>than Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s visual, it&rsquo;s video.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s not defined by who you follow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s defined by some magical thing that,</p>
<p>by the way, if someone wanted to tweak</p>
<p>to show you a certain type of content for some reason,</p>
<p>they could, right, but people love it.</p>
<p>So as a CEO, let me ask you a question</p>
<p>because leadership matters.</p>
<p>This is a complicated question.</p>
<p>Why is Mark Zuckerberg distrusted, disliked</p>
<p>and sometimes even hated by many people in public?</p>
<p>Right, that is a complicated question.</p>
<p>Well, the premise, I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with the premise.</p>
<p>And I can expand that to include</p>
<p>even a more mysterious question for me, Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>What is the Bill Gates version of the question?</p>
<p>Do you think people hate Bill Gates?</p>
<p>No, distrust.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>So takeaway one, it&rsquo;s a checklist.</p>
<p>There is, I think Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s distrust</p>
<p>is the primary one, but there&rsquo;s also like a dislike,</p>
<p>maybe hate is too strong a word,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just if you look at like the articles</p>
<p>that are being written and so on, there&rsquo;s a dislike.</p>
<p>And it makes, it&rsquo;s confusing to me</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like the public picks certain individuals</p>
<p>and they attach certain kinds of emotions</p>
<p>to those individuals.</p>
<p>Yeah, so someone once just recently said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a strong case that founder led companies</p>
<p>have this problem and that a lot of Mark&rsquo;s issues</p>
<p>come today come from the fact that he is a visible founder</p>
<p>with this story that people have watched in both a movie</p>
<p>and they followed along and he&rsquo;s this boy wonder kid</p>
<p>who became one of the world&rsquo;s richest people</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s no longer Mark the person,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s Mark this image of a person</p>
<p>with enormous wealth and power.</p>
<p>And in today&rsquo;s world, we have issues</p>
<p>with enormous wealth and power for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>One of which is we&rsquo;ve been stuck inside</p>
<p>for a year and a half, two years.</p>
<p>One of which is a lot of people were really unhappy</p>
<p>about not the last election, but the last, last election.</p>
<p>And where do you take out that anger?</p>
<p>Who do you blame but the people in charge?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one example or one reason why I think</p>
<p>a lot of people express anger or resentment</p>
<p>or unhappiness with Mark.</p>
<p>At the same time, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I pointed out to that person, I was like, well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think a lot of people really like Elon.</p>
<p>Elon arguably, he kept his factory open here</p>
<p>throughout COVID protocols, which arguably</p>
<p>a lot of people would be against.</p>
<p>While saying a bunch of crazy offensive things</p>
<p>on the internet, they still.</p>
<p>And basically gives the middle finger to the SEC</p>
<p>on Twitter and I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a founder and like people kind of like him.</p>
<p>So I do think that the founder and slash CEO</p>
<p>of a company that&rsquo;s a social network company</p>
<p>is like an extra level of difficulty.</p>
<p>If life is a video game,</p>
<p>you just chose the harder video game.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s interesting to ask you</p>
<p>because you were the founder and CEO of a social network.</p>
<p>I challenge it because.</p>
<p>Exactly, but you&rsquo;re one of the rare examples.</p>
<p>Even Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s disliked, not to the degree,</p>
<p>but it just seems harder</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re running a social media company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I never thought of Jack as just like,</p>
<p>I think generally he&rsquo;s well respected.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right, but he&rsquo;s not loved.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I feel like you, I mean, to me,</p>
<p>Twitter is an incredible thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, again, can I just come back to this point,</p>
<p>which seems over simplistic,</p>
<p>but I really do think how a product makes someone feel,</p>
<p>they ascribe that feeling to the founder.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So make people feel good.</p>
<p>So think about it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just go with this thesis for a second.</p>
<p>Sure, I like it though.</p>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s pretty utilitarian, right?</p>
<p>It delivers brown boxes to your front door.</p>
<p>Sure, you can have Alexa</p>
<p>and you can have all these things, right?</p>
<p>But in general, it delivers stuff quickly to you</p>
<p>at a reasonable price, right?</p>
<p>I think Jeff Bezos is wonderfully wealthy,</p>
<p>thoughtful, smart guy, right?</p>
<p>But people kind of feel that way about him.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, wow, this is really big.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re impressed that this is really big.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s doing the same space stuff Elon&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t necessarily ascribe</p>
<p>the same sense of wonder, right?</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take Elon.</p>
<p>And again, this is pet theory.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much proof other than my own intuition.</p>
<p>He is literally about living the future.</p>
<p>Mars, it&rsquo;s about wonder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about going back to that feeling as a kid</p>
<p>when you looked up to the stars and asked,</p>
<p>is there life out there?</p>
<p>People get behind that because it&rsquo;s a sense of hope</p>
<p>and excitement and innovation.</p>
<p>And like, you can say whatever you want,</p>
<p>but we ascribe that emotion to that person.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re on a social network</p>
<p>and people make you kind of angry</p>
<p>because they disagree with you</p>
<p>or they say something ridiculous</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re living a FOMO type life where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wow, I wish I was doing that thing.</p>
<p>I think Instagram, if I were to think back,</p>
<p>by and large, when I was there,</p>
<p>was not about FOMO, was not about this influencer economy,</p>
<p>although it certainly became that way closer to the end.</p>
<p>It was about the sense of wonder and happiness</p>
<p>and beautiful things in the world.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have a blind spot,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think anyone had a strong opinion</p>
<p>about me one way or the other.</p>
<p>For the longest time, the way people explained to me,</p>
<p>I mean, if you want to go for toxicity,</p>
<p>you go to Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>If you want to go to feel good about life,</p>
<p>you go to Instagram to enjoy, celebrate life.</p>
<p>And my experience been talking to people</p>
<p>is they gave me the benefit of the doubt because of that.</p>
<p>But if your experience of the product</p>
<p>is kind of makes you angry, it&rsquo;s where you argue.</p>
<p>I mean, a big part of Jack might be</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t actually the CEO for a very long time</p>
<p>and only became recently.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure how much of the connection got made.</p>
<p>But in general, I mean, if you hate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just thinking about other companies</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t tech companies.</p>
<p>If you hate like what a company is doing</p>
<p>or it makes you not feel happy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like people are really angry</p>
<p>about Comcast or whatever.</p>
<p>Are they even called Comcast anymore?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Xfinity or something, right?</p>
<p>They had to rebrand.</p>
<p>They became meta, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, but my point is if it makes you angry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful, yeah.</p>
<p>But the thing is, this is me saying this.</p>
<p>I think your thesis is very strong and correct,</p>
<p>has elements of correctness,</p>
<p>but I still personally put some blame on individuals.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I think you said, Elon, looking up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about Childlike Wander to him,</p>
<p>like to his personality, his character,</p>
<p>something about, I think more so than others</p>
<p>where people can trust them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Sondra Prachai is an example of somebody who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some kind, it&rsquo;s hard to put into words,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about the human being</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s trustworthy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s human in a way that connects to us.</p>
<p>And the same with Sajid Nadella.</p>
<p>I mean, some of these folks, something about us</p>
<p>is drawn to them, even when they&rsquo;re flawed.</p>
<p>Even like, so your thesis really holds up for Steve Jobs</p>
<p>because I think people didn&rsquo;t like Steve Jobs,</p>
<p>but he delivered products</p>
<p>and then they fell in love every time.</p>
<p>I guess you could say that the CEO,</p>
<p>the leader is also a product.</p>
<p>And if they keep delivering a product that people like</p>
<p>by being in public and saying things that people like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also a way to make people happy.</p>
<p>But from a social network perspective,</p>
<p>it makes me wonder how difficult it is</p>
<p>to explain to people why certain things happen,</p>
<p>like to explain machine learning,</p>
<p>to explain why certain,</p>
<p>the woke mob effect happens</p>
<p>or the certain kinds of like bullying happens,</p>
<p>which is like, it&rsquo;s human nature combined with algorithm.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult to control for</p>
<p>how the spread of quote unquote misinformation happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to control for that.</p>
<p>And so you try to decelerate certain parts</p>
<p>and you create more problems than you solve.</p>
<p>And anything that looks at all like censorship</p>
<p>can create huge amounts of problems as a slippery slope.</p>
<p>And then you have to inject humans</p>
<p>to oversee the machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>And anytime you inject humans into the system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna create a huge number of problems.</p>
<p>And I feel like it&rsquo;s up to the leader</p>
<p>to communicate that effectively, to be transparent.</p>
<p>First of all, design products</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have those problems.</p>
<p>And second of all, when they have those problems,</p>
<p>to be able to communicate with them.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s all going to,</p>
<p>when you run a social network company, your job is hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I will say the one element that you haven&rsquo;t named</p>
<p>that I think you&rsquo;re getting at is just bedside manner,</p>
<p>which Steve Jobs, I never worked for him.</p>
<p>I never met him in person.</p>
<p>Had an uncanny ability in public to have bedside manner.</p>
<p>I mean, some of the best clips of Steve Jobs</p>
<p>from like, I would say maybe the 80s</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s on the stage and getting questions</p>
<p>from the audience about life.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll take this question that is like,</p>
<p>how are you gonna compete with blah?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s super boring.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even know the name of the company.</p>
<p>And his answer is as if you just asked your grandfather,</p>
<p>the meaning of life.</p>
<p>And you sit there and you&rsquo;re just like, what?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that bedside manner.</p>
<p>And if you lack that, or if that&rsquo;s just not intuitive to you,</p>
<p>I think that it can be a lot harder</p>
<p>to gain the trust of people.</p>
<p>And then add on top of that, missteps of companies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have any friends from the past</p>
<p>where maybe they crossed you once,</p>
<p>or maybe you get back together and you&rsquo;re friends again,</p>
<p>but you just never really forget that thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human nature not to forget.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Russian, you crossed me once.</p>
<p>We solved the problem.</p>
<p>So my point is, humans don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>And if there are times in the past</p>
<p>where they feel like they don&rsquo;t trust the company</p>
<p>or the company hasn&rsquo;t had their back,</p>
<p>that is really hard to earn back,</p>
<p>especially if you don&rsquo;t have that bedside manner.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not attributing this specifically to Marc</p>
<p>because I think a lot of the companies have this issue</p>
<p>where one, you have to be trustworthy as a company</p>
<p>and live by it and live by those actions.</p>
<p>And then two, I think you need to be able</p>
<p>to be really relatable in a way that&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re worth what these people are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jack does a pretty good job of this by being a monk.</p>
<p>But I also, Jack issues attention.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not out there almost on purpose.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just working hard, doing square, right?</p>
<p>I literally shared a desk like this with him at Odeo.</p>
<p>I mean, this normal guy who likes painting,</p>
<p>I remember he would leave early on Wednesdays or something</p>
<p>to go to a painting class.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s creative, he&rsquo;s thoughtful.</p>
<p>I mean, money makes people more creative and more thoughtful,</p>
<p>extreme versions of themselves, right?</p>
<p>And this was a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>You mentioned that he asked you</p>
<p>to do some kind of JavaScript thing.</p>
<p>We were working on some JavaScript together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious, like pre Twitter, early Twitter days,</p>
<p>you and Jack Dorsey are in a room together</p>
<p>talking about JavaScript,</p>
<p>solving some kind of menial problem.</p>
<p>Terrible problems, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, not terrible, just like boring widget problem.</p>
<p>I think it was the Odeo widget</p>
<p>we were working on at the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised anyone paid me to be in the room as an intern</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t really provide any value.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very thankful to anyone who included me back in the day.</p>
<p>It was very helpful.</p>
<p>So thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I mean, is there Odeo that&rsquo;s a precursor to Twitter?</p>
<p>First of all, did you have any anticipation</p>
<p>that this Jack Dorsey guy could be also</p>
<p>a head of a major social network?</p>
<p>And second, did you learn anything from the guy that,</p>
<p>like, do you think it&rsquo;s a coincidence</p>
<p>that you two were in the room together?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the coincidence meaning like,</p>
<p>why does the world play its game in a certain way</p>
<p>where these two founders of social networks?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weird, right?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, it&rsquo;s also weird that Mark showed up</p>
<p>in our fraternity my sophomore year</p>
<p>and we got to know each other then,</p>
<p>like long before Instagram.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small world,</p>
<p>but let me tell a fun story about Jack.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at Odeo and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think Ev was feeling like people</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t working hard enough or something.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what he,</p>
<p>he created this thing where every Friday,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was every Friday,</p>
<p>I only remember this happening once,</p>
<p>but he had us like a statuette, it&rsquo;s like of Mary.</p>
<p>And in the bottom, it&rsquo;s hollow, right?</p>
<p>And I remember on a Friday,</p>
<p>Ev decided he was going to let everyone vote for</p>
<p>who had worked the hardest that week.</p>
<p>We all voted, closed ballot, right?</p>
<p>We all put it in a bucket and he tallied the votes.</p>
<p>And then whoever got the most votes, as I recall,</p>
<p>got the statuette.</p>
<p>And in the statuette was a thousand bucks,</p>
<p>or I recall there was a thousand bucks in it.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve been a hundred bucks,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s call it a thousand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more exciting that way.</p>
<p>It felt like a thousand, yeah.</p>
<p>It did to me for sure.</p>
<p>I actually got two votes.</p>
<p>I was very happy.</p>
<p>We were a small company, but as the intern,</p>
<p>I got at least two votes.</p>
<p>So everybody knew how many votes they got individually?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think it was one of these self accountability things.</p>
<p>Anyway, I remember Jack just getting</p>
<p>like the vast majority of votes from everyone.</p>
<p>And I remember just thinking like,</p>
<p>like I couldn&rsquo;t imagine he would become what he&rsquo;d become</p>
<p>and do what he would do,</p>
<p>but I had a profound respect that the new guy</p>
<p>who I really liked worked that hard.</p>
<p>And you could see his dedication even then</p>
<p>and that people respected him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one story that I remember of him</p>
<p>like working with him specifically from that summer.</p>
<p>Can I take a small tangent on that?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of a pushback in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>a little bit against hard work.</p>
<p>Can you speak to the sort of the thing you admire</p>
<p>to see the new guy working so hard, that thing?</p>
<p>What is the value of that thing in a company?</p>
<p>See, this is like, just to be very frank,</p>
<p>it drives me nuts.</p>
<p>Like I saw this really funny video on TikTok.</p>
<p>Was it on TikTok?</p>
<p>It was like, I&rsquo;m taking a break from my mental health</p>
<p>to work on my career.</p>
<p>I thought that was funny.</p>
<p>Um, so I was like, oh, it is kind of phrased that way,</p>
<p>the opposite often, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so a couple of things.</p>
<p>Uh, I, uh, I have worked so hard</p>
<p>to do the things that I did.</p>
<p>Like Mike and I lost years off of our lives,</p>
<p>staying up late, figuring things out,</p>
<p>the stress that comes with the job.</p>
<p>I have a lot more gray hair now than I did back then.</p>
<p>It requires an enormous amount of work</p>
<p>and most people aren&rsquo;t successful, right?</p>
<p>But even the ones that do don&rsquo;t skate by.</p>
<p>I am okay if people choose not to work hard</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t actually think there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>in this world that says you have to work hard.</p>
<p>But I do think that great things require a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no way you can expect to change the world</p>
<p>without working really hard.</p>
<p>By the way, even changing the world,</p>
<p>you know, the folks that I respect the most</p>
<p>have nudged the world in like a slight direction,</p>
<p>slight, very, very slight.</p>
<p>Like even if Elon accomplishes all the things</p>
<p>he wants to accomplish,</p>
<p>we will have nudged the world in a slight direction,</p>
<p>but it requires enormous amount.</p>
<p>There was an interview with him where he was just like,</p>
<p>he was interviewed, I think, at the Tesla factory</p>
<p>and he was like, work is really hard.</p>
<p>This is actually unhealthy.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t recall the exact,</p>
<p>but he was like visibly shaken</p>
<p>about how hard he had been working.</p>
<p>And he was like, this is bad.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, I think to have great outcomes,</p>
<p>you actually do need to work</p>
<p>at like three standard deviations above the mean,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s nothing saying that people have to go for that.</p>
<p>See, the thing is, but what I would argue,</p>
<p>this is my personal opinion,</p>
<p>is nobody has to do anything, first of all.</p>
<p>They certainly don&rsquo;t have to work hard.</p>
<p>But I think hard work in a company should be admired.</p>
<p>And you should not feel like,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t feel good about yourself for not working hard.</p>
<p>Like, so for example, I don&rsquo;t have to work out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to run.</p>
<p>I hate running, but like, I certainly don&rsquo;t feel good</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t run because I know for my health,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s certain values,</p>
<p>I guess is what I&rsquo;m trying to get at.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain values that you have in life.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s certain values</p>
<p>that companies should have in hard work.</p>
<p>Certain values that companies should have in hard work</p>
<p>is one of the things I think that should be admired.</p>
<p>I often ask this kind of silly question,</p>
<p>just to get a sense of people,</p>
<p>like if I&rsquo;m hiring and so on.</p>
<p>I just ask if they think it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>to work hard or work smart.</p>
<p>It was helpful for me to get a sense of people from that.</p>
<p>Because you think like the right.</p>
<p>The answer&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>The answer&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>I usually try not to give them that,</p>
<p>but sometimes I&rsquo;ll say both if that&rsquo;s an option.</p>
<p>But a lot of people kind of,</p>
<p>a surprising number will say work smart.</p>
<p>And there are usually people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know how to work smart.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re literally just lazy.</p>
<p>Not just, there&rsquo;s two effects behind that.</p>
<p>One is laziness and the other is ego.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re younger and you say it&rsquo;s better to work smart,</p>
<p>it means you think you know what it means</p>
<p>to work smart at this early stage.</p>
<p>To me, people that say work hard or both,</p>
<p>they have the humility to understand like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to work my ass off</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m too dumb to know how to work smart.</p>
<p>And people who are self critical in this way,</p>
<p>in some small amount, you have to have some confidence.</p>
<p>But if you have humility,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re going to actually eventually figure out</p>
<p>what it means to work smart.</p>
<p>And then to actually be successful, you should do both.</p>
<p>So I have a very particular take on this,</p>
<p>which is that no one&rsquo;s forcing you to do anything.</p>
<p>All choices have consequences.</p>
<p>So if you major in, I don&rsquo;t know, theoretical literature,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if that&rsquo;s a major.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just making something up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s supposed to regular literature, applied literature.</p>
<p>Yeah, think about like theoretical Spanish lit</p>
<p>from the 14th century.</p>
<p>Like just make up your esoteric thing.</p>
<p>And then the number of people I went to Stanford with</p>
<p>who get out in the world and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wait, what, I can&rsquo;t find a job?</p>
<p>Like no one wants a theoretical,</p>
<p>like there are plenty of counter examples</p>
<p>of people who have majored in esoteric things</p>
<p>and gone on to be very successful.</p>
<p>So I just want to be clear, it&rsquo;s not about the major.</p>
<p>But every choice you make, whether it&rsquo;s to have kids,</p>
<p>like I love my children.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so awesome to have two kids.</p>
<p>And it is so hard to work really hard and also have kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason why certain very successful people</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t have, or not successful,</p>
<p>but people who run very, very large companies or startups</p>
<p>have chosen not to have kids for a while</p>
<p>or chosen not to like prioritize them.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s a choice.</p>
<p>And like I choose to prioritize my children</p>
<p>because like I want to do that, right?</p>
<p>So everything&rsquo;s a choice.</p>
<p>Now, once you&rsquo;ve made that choice,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important that the contract is clear,</p>
<p>which is to say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine you were joining a new startup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that that startup communicate</p>
<p>that like the expectation is like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all working really, really hard right now.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to join the startup.</p>
<p>But like, if you do just know like you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost as if you join, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>pick your like sports team.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s go back to the Yankees for a second.</p>
<p>You want to join the Yankees,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really want to work that hard.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really want to do batting practice</p>
<p>or pitching practice or whatever for your position, right?</p>
<p>That to me is wacko.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually the world that it feels like we live in</p>
<p>in tech sometimes,</p>
<p>where people both want to work for the Yankees</p>
<p>because it pays a lot,</p>
<p>but like don&rsquo;t actually want to work that hard.</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t fully understand.</p>
<p>Because if you sign up for some of these things,</p>
<p>just sign up for it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t want to sign up for it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many wonderful careers in this world</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t require 80 hours a week.</p>
<p>But when I read about companies going to like</p>
<p>four day work weeks and stuff,</p>
<p>I just like, I chuckle because I can&rsquo;t get enough done</p>
<p>with a seven day week.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how.</p>
<p>And people will say, oh, you&rsquo;re just not working smart.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, I work pretty smart,</p>
<p>I think in general.</p>
<p>Like I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten to this point</p>
<p>if I hadn&rsquo;t like some amount of working smart.</p>
<p>And there is balance though.</p>
<p>So I used to be like a pretty big cyclist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do it much anymore just because of kids</p>
<p>and like prioritizing other things, right?</p>
<p>But one of the most important things to learn</p>
<p>as a cyclist is to take a rest day.</p>
<p>But to me and to cyclists,</p>
<p>like resting is a function of optimizing for the long run.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a thing that you do for its own merits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually like, if you don&rsquo;t rest,</p>
<p>your muscles don&rsquo;t recover.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re just not as,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not training as efficiently.</p>
<p>You should probably, the successful people I&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>in terms of athletes, they hate rest days,</p>
<p>but they know they have to do it for the long term.</p>
<p>They think their opposition is getting stronger and stronger</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the feeling,</p>
<p>but you know it&rsquo;s the right thing</p>
<p>and usually you need a coach to help you.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I use this thing called training peaks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because it actually mathematically shows</p>
<p>like where you are on the curve and all this stuff,</p>
<p>but you have to have that rest,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a function of going harder for longer.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s this reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>like planning the aggregate and the long,</p>
<p>but a lot of people will hide behind laziness</p>
<p>by saying that they&rsquo;re trying to optimize for the long run</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re just not working very hard.</p>
<p>But again, you don&rsquo;t have to sign up for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally cool.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think less of people</p>
<p>for like not working super hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, don&rsquo;t sign up for things</p>
<p>that require working super hard.</p>
<p>And some of that requires for the leadership</p>
<p>to have the guts, the boldness to communicate effectively</p>
<p>at the very beginning.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes I think most of the problems arise</p>
<p>in the fact that the leadership is kind of hesitant</p>
<p>to communicate the socially difficult truth</p>
<p>of what it takes to be at this company.</p>
<p>So they kind of say, hey, come with us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, we have snacks, you know, but.</p>
<p>Unlimited vacation and.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, Ray at Bridgewater is always fascinating</p>
<p>because, you know, people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been called like a cult on the outside</p>
<p>or cultish and,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s fascinating is like,</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t give on their principles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, listen, this is what it&rsquo;s like to work here.</p>
<p>We record every meeting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like brutally honest</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not going to feel right to everyone.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t feel right to you, totally cool.</p>
<p>Just go work somewhere else.</p>
<p>But if you work here, you are signing up for this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s been fascinating to me</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s honesty upfront.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a system in which you operate.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not for you,</p>
<p>like no one&rsquo;s forcing you to work there, right?</p>
<p>I actually did.</p>
<p>So I did a conversation with him</p>
<p>and kind of got stuck in a funny moment,</p>
<p>which is at the end I asked him, you know,</p>
<p>to give me honest feedback of how I did on the interview.</p>
<p>And I was.</p>
<p>Did he?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>He was super nice.</p>
<p>He asked me, he&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>tell me, did you accomplish</p>
<p>what you were hoping to accomplish?</p>
<p>I was like, that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking you as an objective observer</p>
<p>of two people talking, how do we do today?</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>he gave me this politician answer.</p>
<p>Well, I feel like we&rsquo;ve accomplished</p>
<p>successful communication of like ideas,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;d love to spread some of the ideas</p>
<p>in that, like in principles and so on.</p>
<p>I was like.</p>
<p>Back to my original point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to get.</p>
<p>Even for Radalia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to give feedback.</p>
<p>And one of the other things I learned from him</p>
<p>and just people in that world is like,</p>
<p>man, humans really like to pretend</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ve come to,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve come to some kind of meeting of the minds.</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s conflict, if you and I have conflict,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always better to meet face to face, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the phone.</p>
<p>Slack is not great, right?</p>
<p>Email is not great, but face to face.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s crazy is you and I get together</p>
<p>and we actively try to,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re not actually solving the conflict,</p>
<p>we actively try to paper over the conflict.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it didn&rsquo;t really bother me that much.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t mean it.</p>
<p>But like, no, in our minds we&rsquo;re still there.</p>
<p>So this is one of the things that as a leader,</p>
<p>you always have to be digging,</p>
<p>especially as you ascend.</p>
<p>Like straight to the conflict.</p>
<p>Yeah, but as you ascend,</p>
<p>no one wants to tell you you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>No one wants to tell you your idea is bad.</p>
<p>And you can, you&rsquo;re like, oh,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m going to be a leader.</p>
<p>And the idea is, well, I&rsquo;m just going to ask people.</p>
<p>No one tells you.</p>
<p>So like you have to look for the markers,</p>
<p>knowing that literally just people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to tell you along the way and be paranoid.</p>
<p>I mean, you asked about selling the company.</p>
<p>I think one of the biggest differences between me</p>
<p>and a lot of other entrepreneurs is like,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t completely confident we could do it.</p>
<p>Like we could be alone and actually be great.</p>
<p>And if any entrepreneur is honest with you,</p>
<p>they also feel that way.</p>
<p>But a lot of people are like,</p>
<p>well, I have to be cocky and just say,</p>
<p>I can do this on my own.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be fine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to crush everyone.</p>
<p>Some people do say that and then it&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>And they, and they fail.</p>
<p>But being honest in that moment with yourself,</p>
<p>with those close to you.</p>
<p>And also you talked about the personality of leaders</p>
<p>and who resonates and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare that I see leaders be vulnerable, rare.</p>
<p>And one thing I tried to do at Instagram,</p>
<p>at least internally was like, say when I screwed up</p>
<p>and like point out how I was wrong about things</p>
<p>and point out where my judgment was off.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks they have to bat a thousand, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>The best quant hedge funds in the world,</p>
<p>bat 50.001%.</p>
<p>They just take a lot of bets, right?</p>
<p>Renaissance, they might, they might bat 51%, right?</p>
<p>But holy hell, like the question isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>are you right every single time</p>
<p>and you have to seem invincible.</p>
<p>The question is how many at bats do you get?</p>
<p>And on average, are you better on average, right?</p>
<p>With enough bets and enough at bats</p>
<p>that your aggregate can be very high.</p>
<p>I mean, Steve Jobs was wrong at a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>The Newton too early, right?</p>
<p>Next, not quite right.</p>
<p>There was even a time where he said like,</p>
<p>no one will ever wanna watch a video on the iPod.</p>
<p>Totally wrong.</p>
<p>But who cares if you come around</p>
<p>and realize your mistake and fix it.</p>
<p>It becomes just like you said, harder and harder</p>
<p>when your ego grows and the number of people around you</p>
<p>that say positive things towards you grows.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s really valuable that,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s imagine a counterfactual</p>
<p>where Instagram became worth like $300 billion</p>
<p>or something crazy, right?</p>
<p>I kind of like that my life is relatively normal now.</p>
<p>When I say relatively, you get what I mean.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making a claim that I live a normal life,</p>
<p>but like I certainly don&rsquo;t live in a world</p>
<p>where there are like 15 Sherpas following me,</p>
<p>like fetching me water, like that&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>I actually like that I have a sense of humility of like,</p>
<p>I may not found another thing that&rsquo;s nearly as big</p>
<p>so I have to work twice as hard</p>
<p>or I have to like learn twice as much.</p>
<p>I have to, we haven&rsquo;t talked about machine learning yet,</p>
<p>but my favorite thing is all these like famous,</p>
<p>you know, tech guys who have worked in the industry,</p>
<p>pontificating about the future of machine learning</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s gonna kill us all, right?</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;ve never tried</p>
<p>to build anything with machine learning themselves.</p>
<p>Yes, so there&rsquo;s a nice line between people</p>
<p>that actually build stuff with machine,</p>
<p>like actually program something</p>
<p>or at least understand some of those fundamentals</p>
<p>and the people that are just saying philosophical stuff</p>
<p>or journalists and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting line to walk</p>
<p>because the people who program are often not philosophers.</p>
<p>Or don&rsquo;t have the attention,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t write an op ed for the Wall Street Journal,</p>
<p>like it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s nice to be both a little bit,</p>
<p>like to have elements of both.</p>
<p>My point is the fact that I have to learn stuff from scratch</p>
<p>or that I choose to are like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humbling.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, again, I have a lot of advantages.</p>
<p>I like, but my point is it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>to be back in a game where you have to fight.</p>
<p>That is, that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>So being humble, being vulnerable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an important aspect of a leader</p>
<p>and I hope it serves me well,</p>
<p>but like, I can&rsquo;t fast forward 10 years to now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just, that&rsquo;s my game plan.</p>
<p>Before I forget, I have to ask you one last thing</p>
<p>on Instagram.</p>
<p>What do you think about the whistleblower,</p>
<p>Frances Haugen, recently coming out</p>
<p>and saying that Facebook is aware of Instagram&rsquo;s</p>
<p>harmful effect on teenage girls</p>
<p>as per their own internal research studies on the matter?</p>
<p>What do you think about this baby of yours,</p>
<p>Instagram being under fire now,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve been talking about under the leadership of Facebook?</p>
<p>You know, I often question, where does the blame lie?</p>
<p>Is the blame at the people that originated the network me?</p>
<p>Is the blame at like the decision to combine the network</p>
<p>with another network with a certain set of values?</p>
<p>Is the blame at how it gets run after I left?</p>
<p>Like, is it the driver or is it the car, right?</p>
<p>Is it that someone enabled these devices in the first place?</p>
<p>If you go to an extreme, right?</p>
<p>Or is it the users themselves, just human nature?</p>
<p>Is it just the way of human nature?</p>
<p>Sure, and like the idea that we&rsquo;re gonna find</p>
<p>a mutually exclusive answer here is crazy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one place that&rsquo;s a combination</p>
<p>of a lot of these things.</p>
<p>And then the question is like, is it true at all, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not actually saying that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>or that it&rsquo;s true, but there&rsquo;s always more nuance here.</p>
<p>Do I believe that social media has an effect</p>
<p>on young people?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s got it, they use it a lot.</p>
<p>And I bet you there are a lot of positive effects</p>
<p>and I bet you there are negative effects,</p>
<p>just like any technology.</p>
<p>And where I&rsquo;ve come to in my thinking on this</p>
<p>is that I think any technology has negative side effects.</p>
<p>The question is, as a leader, what do you do about them?</p>
<p>And are you actively working on them</p>
<p>or do you just like not really believe in them?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a leader that sits there and says,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re gonna put an enormous amount</p>
<p>of resources against this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna acknowledge when there are true criticisms,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be vulnerable and that we&rsquo;re not perfect</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna go fix them</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna be held accountable along the way.</p>
<p>I think that people generally really respect that.</p>
<p>But I think that where Facebook I think has had issues</p>
<p>in the past is where they say things like,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t remember what Mark said about misinformation</p>
<p>during the election.</p>
<p>There was that like famous quote where he was like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty crazy to think that Facebook had anything</p>
<p>to do with this election.</p>
<p>Like that was something like that quote.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t remember what stage he was on and yeah.</p>
<p>But ooh, that did not age well, right?</p>
<p>Like you have to be willing to say,</p>
<p>well, maybe there&rsquo;s something there and wow,</p>
<p>like I wanna go look into it</p>
<p>and truly believe it in your gut.</p>
<p>But if people look at you and how you act</p>
<p>and what you say and don&rsquo;t believe you truly feel that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the words you say, but how you say them</p>
<p>and that people believe they actually feel the pain</p>
<p>of having caused any suffering in the world.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s much more about your actions</p>
<p>and your posture post event</p>
<p>than it is about debugging the why.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t know, is it like, I don&rsquo;t know this research.</p>
<p>It was written well after I left, right?</p>
<p>Like, is it the algorithm?</p>
<p>Is it the explore page?</p>
<p>Is it the people you might know unit connecting you</p>
<p>to ideas that are dangerous?</p>
<p>Like I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d have to have a much deeper,</p>
<p>I think dive to understand where the blame lies.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s very unpleasant to me to consider,</p>
<p>now, I don&rsquo;t know if this is true,</p>
<p>but to consider the very fact that there might be</p>
<p>some complicated games being played here.</p>
<p>For example, as somebody, I really love psychology</p>
<p>and I love it enough to know that the field</p>
<p>is pretty broken in the following way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to study human beings well at scale</p>
<p>because the questions you ask affect the results.</p>
<p>You can basically get any results you want.</p>
<p>And so you have an internal Facebook study</p>
<p>that asks some question of which we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the full details and there&rsquo;s some kind of analysis,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just the one little tiny slice</p>
<p>into some much bigger picture.</p>
<p>And so you can have thousands of employees at Facebook.</p>
<p>One of them comes out and picks whatever narrative,</p>
<p>knowing that they become famous,</p>
<p>coupled with the other really uncomfortable thing</p>
<p>I see in the world, which is journalists seem to understand</p>
<p>they get a lot of clickbait attention</p>
<p>from saying something negative about social networks.</p>
<p>Certain companies, like they even get some clickbait stuff</p>
<p>about Tesla or about, especially when it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a public famous CEO type of person,</p>
<p>if they get a lot of views on the negative, not the positive,</p>
<p>the positive, they&rsquo;ll get, I mean,</p>
<p>it actually goes to the thing you were saying before,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a hot, sexy new product,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great to look forward to, they get positive on that,</p>
<p>but absent a product, it&rsquo;s nice to have like the CEO</p>
<p>messing up in some kind of way.</p>
<p>And so couple that with the whistleblower</p>
<p>and with this whole dynamic of journalism and so on,</p>
<p>you know, with Social Dilemma being really popular,</p>
<p>documentary, it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>my concern is there&rsquo;s deep flaws in human nature here</p>
<p>in terms of things we need to deal with,</p>
<p>like the nature of hate, of bullying,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s people who are trying to use that</p>
<p>potentially to become famous and make money</p>
<p>off of blaming others for causing more of the problem</p>
<p>as opposed to helping solve the problem.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is like, I&rsquo;m just uncomfortable</p>
<p>with, I guess, not knowing what to think about any of this</p>
<p>because a bunch of folks I know that work at Facebook</p>
<p>on the machine learning side, so Yann LeCun,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re quite upset about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of really brilliant,</p>
<p>good people inside Facebook that are trying to do good.</p>
<p>And so like all of this press, Yann is one of them,</p>
<p>and he has an amazing team</p>
<p>with the machine learning researchers.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s really upset with the fact</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t seem to understand</p>
<p>that the portrayal does not represent</p>
<p>the full nature of efforts that&rsquo;s going on at Facebook.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what to think about that.</p>
<p>Well, you just, I think, very helpfully explained</p>
<p>the nuance of the situation</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s so hard to understand.</p>
<p>But a couple of things.</p>
<p>One is I think I have been surprised</p>
<p>at the scale with which some product manager</p>
<p>can do an enormous amount of harm</p>
<p>to a very, very large company</p>
<p>by releasing a trove of documents.</p>
<p>Like I think I read a couple of them when they got published</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t even spent any time going deep.</p>
<p>Part of it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t really feel like reliving</p>
<p>a previous life, but wow.</p>
<p>Like talk about challenging the idea of open culture</p>
<p>and like what that does to Facebook internally.</p>
<p>If Facebook was built, like I remember like my office,</p>
<p>we had this like no visitors rule around my office</p>
<p>because we always had like confidential stuff up</p>
<p>on the walls and everyone was super angry</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, that goes against our culture</p>
<p>of transparency and like marks in the fish cube</p>
<p>or whatever they call it, the aquarium,</p>
<p>I think they called it, where like literally anyone could see</p>
<p>what he was doing at any point and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, other companies like Apple have been quiet</p>
<p>slash locked down, Snapchat&rsquo;s the same way for a reason.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what this does to transparency</p>
<p>on the inside of startups that value that.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s a seminal moment and you can say,</p>
<p>well, you should have nothing to hide, right?</p>
<p>But to your point, you can pick out documents</p>
<p>that show anything, right?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What happens to transparency inside of startups</p>
<p>and the culture that startups or companies</p>
<p>in the future will grow, like the startup of the future</p>
<p>that becomes the next Facebook will be locked down</p>
<p>and what does that do, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part one.</p>
<p>Part two, like I don&rsquo;t think that you could design</p>
<p>a more like a well orchestrated handful of events</p>
<p>from the like 16 minutes to releasing the documents</p>
<p>in the way that they were released at the right time.</p>
<p>That takes a lot of planning and partnership.</p>
<p>And it seems like she has a partner at some firm, right?</p>
<p>That probably helped a lot with this, but man,</p>
<p>at a personal level, if you&rsquo;re her,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to really believe in what you are doing,</p>
<p>really believe in it because you are personally</p>
<p>putting your ass on the line, right?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve got a very large company</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t like enemies, right?</p>
<p>It takes a lot of guts and I don&rsquo;t love</p>
<p>these conspiracy theories about like,</p>
<p>oh, she&rsquo;s being financed from some person or people.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t love them because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the easy thing to say.</p>
<p>I think the Occam&rsquo;s razor here is like someone thought</p>
<p>they were doing something wrong</p>
<p>and was like very, very courageous.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if courageous is the word,</p>
<p>but like, so without getting into like,</p>
<p>is she a martyr?</p>
<p>Is she courageous?</p>
<p>Is she right?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s put that aside for a second.</p>
<p>Then there are the documents themselves.</p>
<p>They say what they say.</p>
<p>To your point, a lot of the things that like people</p>
<p>have been worried about already in the documents</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re already been said externally.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m just like, I&rsquo;m thankful</p>
<p>that I am focused on new things with my life.</p>
<p>Well, let me just say, I just think it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>hard problem that probably Facebook and Twitter</p>
<p>are trying to solve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually just fascinated by how hard this problem is.</p>
<p>There are fundamental issues at Facebook in tone</p>
<p>and in an approach of how product gets built</p>
<p>and the objective functions.</p>
<p>And since people, organizations are not people.</p>
<p>So yawn and fair, right?</p>
<p>Like there are a lot of really great people</p>
<p>who like literally just want to push</p>
<p>reinforcement learning forward.</p>
<p>They literally just want to teach a robot</p>
<p>to touch, feel, lift, right?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not thinking about political misinformation,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a strong connection between what funds</p>
<p>that research and an enormously profitable machine</p>
<p>that has trade offs.</p>
<p>And one cannot separate the two.</p>
<p>You are not completely separate from the system.</p>
<p>So I agree, it can feel really frustrating</p>
<p>to feel if you&rsquo;re internal there,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working on something completely unrelated</p>
<p>and you feel like your group&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I can understand that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some responsibility still.</p>
<p>You have to acknowledge, it&rsquo;s like the Ray Dalio thing.</p>
<p>You have to look in the mirror and see if there&rsquo;s problems</p>
<p>and you have to fix those problems.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You mentioned machine learning reinforcement quite a bit.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, social networks is one of the exciting places,</p>
<p>recommender systems where machine learning is applied.</p>
<p>Where else in the world, in the space of possibilities</p>
<p>over the next five, 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;re going to see impact of machine learning</p>
<p>when you try, on the philosophical level,</p>
<p>on a technical level, what do you think?</p>
<p>Or within social networks themselves?</p>
<p>Well, I think the obvious answers are climate change.</p>
<p>Think about how much fuel</p>
<p>or just waste there is in energy consumption today</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t plan accordingly,</p>
<p>because we take the least efficient route or&hellip;</p>
<p>The logistics and stuff, the supply chain,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, listen, if we&rsquo;re gonna fight climate change,</p>
<p>like one really way, one awesome way to do it</p>
<p>is figure out how to optimize how we operate as a species</p>
<p>and minimize the amount of energy we consume</p>
<p>to maximize whatever economic impact we wanna have.</p>
<p>Because right now those two are very much tied together.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe that that has to be the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this really interesting, you&rsquo;ve read it.</p>
<p>For people who are listening,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this really interesting paper</p>
<p>on reinforcement learning</p>
<p>and energy consumption inside buildings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one of the seminal ones, right?</p>
<p>But imagine that at massive scale.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve done resource planning for servers</p>
<p>for peak load using reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that was at Google or somewhere else,</p>
<p>but like, okay, great, you do it for servers,</p>
<p>but what if you could do it for just capacity</p>
<p>and general energy capacity for cities</p>
<p>and planning for traffic?</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s all the self driving cars</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know, like I&rsquo;m not gonna pontificate</p>
<p>on like crazy ideas using reinforcement learning</p>
<p>or machine learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so clear to me</p>
<p>that humans don&rsquo;t think quickly enough.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to think about machine learning</p>
<p>helping a little bit at scale.</p>
<p>So a little bit to a large number of people</p>
<p>that has a huge impact.</p>
<p>So if you optimize, say Google Maps, something like that,</p>
<p>trajectory planning or what a map quest first.</p>
<p>Getting here, I looked and it was like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the most energy efficient route.</p>
<p>And I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna be late.</p>
<p>I need to take the fastest route.</p>
<p>As opposed to unrolling the map.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, and then that&rsquo;s going to be very inefficient</p>
<p>no matter what.</p>
<p>I was definitely the other day,</p>
<p>like part of the Epsilon of Epsilon Greedy</p>
<p>with Waze where like I was sent on like a weird route</p>
<p>that I could tell they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>we just need to collect data at this road.</p>
<p>Like we just, Kevin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You were the ant they sent out for exploration.</p>
<p>Kevin&rsquo;s definitely gonna be the guinea pig.</p>
<p>And great, now we have.</p>
<p>Did you at least feel pride?</p>
<p>Oh, going through it, I was like, oh, this is fun.</p>
<p>Like now they get data about this weird shortcut.</p>
<p>And actually I hit all the green lights networked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is a problem.</p>
<p>Bad data.</p>
<p>Bad data, they&rsquo;re just gonna imagine.</p>
<p>I could see you slowing down and stopping at a green light</p>
<p>just to give them the right kind of data.</p>
<p>But to answer your question,</p>
<p>like I feel like that was fairly unsatisfying</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s easy to say climate change.</p>
<p>But what I would say is at Instagram,</p>
<p>everything we applied machine learning to</p>
<p>got better for users and it got better for the company.</p>
<p>I saw the power.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t fully understand it as an executive.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually one of the issues</p>
<p>that, and when I say understand,</p>
<p>I mean the mathematics of it.</p>
<p>Like I understand what it does.</p>
<p>I understand that it helps.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of executives now</p>
<p>that talk about it in the way</p>
<p>that they talk about the internet</p>
<p>or they talked about the internet like 10 years ago.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re gonna build mobile.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, what does that mean?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re just gonna do mobile.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, okay.</p>
<p>So my sense is the next generation of leaders</p>
<p>will have grown up having had classes</p>
<p>in reinforcement learning, supervised learning, whatever.</p>
<p>And they will be able to thoughtfully apply it</p>
<p>to their companies and the places that it is needed most.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>Cause I mean, talk about efficiency gains.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what excites me the most about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s interesting just to get a fundamental</p>
<p>first principles understanding</p>
<p>of certain concepts of machine learning.</p>
<p>So supervised learning from an executive perspective,</p>
<p>supervised learning, you have to have a lot of humans</p>
<p>label a lot of data.</p>
<p>So the question there is, okay,</p>
<p>can we gather a large amount of data</p>
<p>that can be labeled well?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the question Tesla asked,</p>
<p>like can we create a data engine</p>
<p>that keeps sending an imperfect machine learning system</p>
<p>out there, whenever it fails, it gives us data back.</p>
<p>We label it by human and we send it back and forth</p>
<p>to this way.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Yann LeCun&rsquo;s excited</p>
<p>about the self supervised learning</p>
<p>where you do much less human labeling</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some kind of mechanism for the system</p>
<p>to learn it by itself on the human generated data.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>which is like basically allowing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s applying the alpha zero technology</p>
<p>that allow through self play to learn how to solve</p>
<p>the game of Go and achieve incredible levels</p>
<p>at the game of chess.</p>
<p>Can you formulate the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s amenable to reinforcement learning?</p>
<p>And can you get the right kind of signal at scale?</p>
<p>Cause you need a lot of signal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to see which part</p>
<p>of a social network can you convert</p>
<p>into reinforcement learning problem.</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>I think, is that we now have learned</p>
<p>to apply neural networks to guess the Q function,</p>
<p>basically the values for any state in action.</p>
<p>And that is fascinating cause we used to just like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, have like a linear regression,</p>
<p>like hope it worked and that was the fanciest version of it.</p>
<p>But now you look at it, I&rsquo;m like trying to learn this stuff</p>
<p>and I look at it and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>there are like 17 different acronyms of different ways</p>
<p>you can try to apply this.</p>
<p>No one quite agrees, like what&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>Generally, if you&rsquo;re trying to like build a neural network,</p>
<p>there are pretty well trodden ways of doing that.</p>
<p>You use Adam, you use ReLU,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s just like general good ideas.</p>
<p>And in reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>I feel like the consensus is like, it totally depends.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s really hard to get it to converge</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s noisy and it like,</p>
<p>so there are all these really interesting ideas</p>
<p>around building simulators.</p>
<p>You know, like for instance, in self driving, right?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t want to like actually have someone</p>
<p>getting in an accident to learn that an accident is bad.</p>
<p>So you start simulating accidents,</p>
<p>simulating aggressive drivers,</p>
<p>just simulating crazy dogs that run into the street and,</p>
<p>wow, fascinating, right?</p>
<p>Like my mind starts racing and then the question is,</p>
<p>okay, forget about self driving cars.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about social networks.</p>
<p>How can you produce a better, more thoughtful experience</p>
<p>using these types of algorithms?</p>
<p>And honestly, in talking to some of the people</p>
<p>that work at Facebook and old Instagrammers,</p>
<p>most people are like, yeah, we tried a lot of things,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t quite ever make it work.</p>
<p>I mean, for the longest time,</p>
<p>Facebook ads was effectively a logistic regression, okay?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is now,</p>
<p>but like if you look at this paper</p>
<p>that they published back in the day,</p>
<p>it was literally just a logistic regression.</p>
<p>Made a lot of money.</p>
<p>So even at these like extremely large scales,</p>
<p>if we are not yet touching</p>
<p>what reinforcement learning can truly do,</p>
<p>imagine what the next 10 years looks like.</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So I really liked the use of reinforcement learning</p>
<p>as part of the simulation, for example,</p>
<p>like with self driving cars, it&rsquo;s modeling pedestrians.</p>
<p>So the nice thing about reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>it can be used to learn agents within the world.</p>
<p>So they can learn to behave properly.</p>
<p>Like you can teach pedestrians to,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t hard code the way they behave,</p>
<p>they learn how to behave.</p>
<p>In that same way, I do have a hope,</p>
<p>was it Jack Dorsey talks about healthy conversations.</p>
<p>You talked about meaningful interactions, I believe.</p>
<p>Like simulating interactions.</p>
<p>So you can learn how to manage that, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So where most of your algorithm development happens</p>
<p>in virtual worlds, and then you can really learn</p>
<p>how to design the interface,</p>
<p>how you design a bunch of aspects of the experience</p>
<p>in terms of how you select what&rsquo;s shown in the feed,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It feels like if you can connect reinforcement learning</p>
<p>to that, that&rsquo;s super exciting.</p>
<p>Yep, and I think if you have a company and leadership</p>
<p>that believe in doing the right things</p>
<p>and can apply this technology in the right way,</p>
<p>some really special stuff can happen.</p>
<p>It is mostly likely going to be a group of people</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never heard about, start up from scratch, right?</p>
<p>And you asked if like new social networks could be built,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to imagine they will be.</p>
<p>And whoever starts it, it might be some kids in a garage</p>
<p>that took these classes from these people, you, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re building all of these things</p>
<p>with this tech at the core.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying not to be someone who just like throws</p>
<p>around reinforcement learning as a buzzword.</p>
<p>I truly believe that it is the most cutting edge</p>
<p>in what can happen in social networks.</p>
<p>And I also believe it&rsquo;s super hard.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s super hard to make it work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super hard to do it at scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super hard to find people that truly understand it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna say that like,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be applied in social networks</p>
<p>before we have true self driving.</p>
<p>Yeah, we could argue about this for a long time,</p>
<p>but yes, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think self driving is way harder than people realize.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Let me ask you in terms of that kid in the garage</p>
<p>or those couple of kids in the garage,</p>
<p>what advice would you give to them</p>
<p>if they wanna start a new social network or a business?</p>
<p>What advice would you give to somebody</p>
<p>with a big dream and a young startup?</p>
<p>To me, you have to choose to do something</p>
<p>that even if it fails, like it was so fun, right?</p>
<p>Like we never started Instagram knowing</p>
<p>it was going to be big.</p>
<p>We started Instagram because we loved photography.</p>
<p>We loved social networks.</p>
<p>I had seen what other social networks had done</p>
<p>and I thought, hmm, maybe we did a spin on this,</p>
<p>but like nowhere was our feet predestined.</p>
<p>Like it wasn&rsquo;t like, it wasn&rsquo;t written out anywhere</p>
<p>that everything was gonna go great.</p>
<p>And I often think the counterfactual,</p>
<p>like what if it had not gone well?</p>
<p>I would have been like, I don&rsquo;t know, that was fun.</p>
<p>We raised some money, we learned some stuff</p>
<p>and does it position you well for the next experience?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the advice that I would give</p>
<p>to anyone wanting to start something today,</p>
<p>which is like, does this meet with your ultimate goals?</p>
<p>Not wealth, not fame, none of that,</p>
<p>because all of that, by the way, is bullshit.</p>
<p>Like you can get super famous and super wealthy.</p>
<p>And I think generally those are not things that,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s easy to say with like a lot of money</p>
<p>that somehow like it&rsquo;s not good to have a lot of money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I think that complicates life enormously</p>
<p>in a way that people don&rsquo;t fully comprehend.</p>
<p>So I think it is way more interesting to shoot for,</p>
<p>can I make something that people love,</p>
<p>that provides value in the world,</p>
<p>that I love building, that I love working on, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would do if I were starting from scratch.</p>
<p>And by the way, like in some ways</p>
<p>that I will do that personally,</p>
<p>which is like choose the thing</p>
<p>that you get up every morning and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I love this, even when it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>Even when it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>What about a social network specifically?</p>
<p>If you were to imagine, put yourself in the mind of some.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t compete against myself.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give out ideas.</p>
<p>Okay, I got you.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s like high level.</p>
<p>You can focus on community.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I said that as a half joke.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I think these things are so hard to build</p>
<p>that like ideas are a dime a dozen, but.</p>
<p>You have talked about keeping it simple.</p>
<p>Can I tell you?</p>
<p>Which is a liberating idea.</p>
<p>My model is it&rsquo;s three circles and they overlap.</p>
<p>One circle is what do I have experience at?</p>
<p>Slash, what am I good at?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like saying what am I good at</p>
<p>because it just like seems like,</p>
<p>what do I have experience in, right?</p>
<p>What can I bring to the table?</p>
<p>What am I excited about is the other circle.</p>
<p>What gets it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s just super cool, right?</p>
<p>That I want to work on because even when this is hard,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>I want to stick with it.</p>
<p>And the last circle is like, what does the world need?</p>
<p>And if that circle ain&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you work on.</p>
<p>Cause there are a lot of startups that exist</p>
<p>that just no one needs or very small markets need.</p>
<p>But if you want to be successful,</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re like, if you&rsquo;re good at it,</p>
<p>you have, sorry, if you&rsquo;re good at it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re passionate about it and the world needs it.</p>
<p>I mean, this sounds simple,</p>
<p>not enough people sit down and just think</p>
<p>about those circles and think, do these things overlap?</p>
<p>And then can I get that middle section?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s small, but can I get that middle section?</p>
<p>I think a lot about that personally.</p>
<p>And then you have to be really honest about the circle</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re good at and really honest about the circle</p>
<p>that the world needs.</p>
<p>And as opposed to really honest about the passion,</p>
<p>like what do you actually love?</p>
<p>As opposed to like some kind of dream of making money,</p>
<p>all those kinds of stuff, like literally love doing.</p>
<p>I had a former engineer who decided to start a startup</p>
<p>and I was like, are you sure you want to start a company</p>
<p>versus like join something else?</p>
<p>Because being a coach of an NBA team and playing basketball</p>
<p>are two very, very different things.</p>
<p>And like not everyone fully understands the difference.</p>
<p>I think you can kind of do it both.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, jury&rsquo;s out on that one</p>
<p>because like they&rsquo;re in the middle of it now.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really important to figure out</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re good at, not be full of yourself,</p>
<p>like truly look at your track record.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the saying like, it ain&rsquo;t bragging if you can do it.</p>
<p>But too many people are delusional</p>
<p>and like think they&rsquo;re better at things</p>
<p>than they actually are,</p>
<p>or think there&rsquo;s a bigger market than there actually is.</p>
<p>When you confuse your passion for things with a big market,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really scary, right?</p>
<p>Like just because you think it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s a big business opportunity.</p>
<p>So like, what evidence do you have?</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m a fairly like, I&rsquo;m a strict rationalist on this.</p>
<p>And like sometimes people don&rsquo;t like working with me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m pretty pragmatic about things.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not Elon, like I don&rsquo;t sit</p>
<p>and make bold proclamations about visiting Mars.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just not how I work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, I want to build this really cool thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fairly practical and I think we could do it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in this way.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s cool though is like, that&rsquo;s just my sweet spot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like, I just, I can&rsquo;t with a straight face</p>
<p>talk about the metaphors.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I just, it&rsquo;s not me.</p>
<p>What do you think about the Facebook renaming itself to?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean that as a dig.</p>
<p>I just literally mean like, I&rsquo;m fairly,</p>
<p>I like to live in the next five years.</p>
<p>And like, what things can I get out in a year</p>
<p>that people will use at scale?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just, again, those circles I think are different</p>
<p>for different people, but it&rsquo;s important to realize</p>
<p>that like market matters, you being good at it matters</p>
<p>and having passion for it matters.</p>
<p>Your question, sorry.</p>
<p>Well, on that last, on this topic in terms of funding,</p>
<p>is there, by way of advice,</p>
<p>was funding in your own journey helpful, unhelpful?</p>
<p>Like is there a right time to get funding, venture funding</p>
<p>or anything, borrow some money from your parents?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like is money getting in the way?</p>
<p>Does it help?</p>
<p>Is the timing important?</p>
<p>Is there some kind of wisdom you can give there</p>
<p>because you were exceptionally successful very quickly?</p>
<p>Funding helps as long as it&rsquo;s from the right people.</p>
<p>That includes yourself.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about myself funding myself in a second,</p>
<p>which is like, because I can fund myself</p>
<p>doing whatever projects I can do,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have another person putting pressure on me</p>
<p>except for myself and that creates strange dynamics, right?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s like talk about people getting funding</p>
<p>from a venture capitalist initially.</p>
<p>We raised money from Matt Kohler at Benchmark.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s brilliant, amazing guy, very thoughtful.</p>
<p>And he was very helpful early on.</p>
<p>But I have stories from entrepreneurs</p>
<p>where they raised money from the wrong person</p>
<p>or the wrong firm where incentives weren&rsquo;t aligned.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think in the same way</p>
<p>and bad things happened because of that.</p>
<p>The boardroom was always noisy.</p>
<p>There were fights, like we just never had that.</p>
<p>Matt was great.</p>
<p>I think like capital these days</p>
<p>is kind of a dime a dozen, right?</p>
<p>Like as long as you&rsquo;re fundable,</p>
<p>like it seems like there&rsquo;s money out there</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m hearing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important that you are aligned</p>
<p>and that you think of raising money</p>
<p>as hiring someone for your team rather than taking money</p>
<p>if capital is plentiful, right?</p>
<p>It provides a certain amount of pressure</p>
<p>to do the right thing that I think is healthy</p>
<p>for any startup.</p>
<p>And it keeps you real and honest</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t wanna lose their money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re paid to not lose their money.</p>
<p>The problem, maybe I could depersonalize it,</p>
<p>but like I remember having lunch with Elon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only happened once.</p>
<p>And I asked him, like I was trying to figure out</p>
<p>what I was doing after Instagram, right?</p>
<p>And I asked him something about like angel investing.</p>
<p>And he looked at me with a straight face.</p>
<p>He was like, why the F would I do that?</p>
<p>Like, why?</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re connected.</p>
<p>Like seems like he&rsquo;s like, I only invest in myself.</p>
<p>I was like, Ooh, okay.</p>
<p>You know, like not the confidence.</p>
<p>I was just like, what a novel idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, if you have money,</p>
<p>like why not just put it against your bag</p>
<p>and like enable you&rsquo;re visiting Mars or something, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s awesome, great.</p>
<p>But I had never really thought of it that way.</p>
<p>But also with that comes an interesting dynamic</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t actually have people</p>
<p>who are gonna lose that money telling you,</p>
<p>hey, don&rsquo;t do this or, hey, you need to face this reality.</p>
<p>So you need to create other versions of that truth teller.</p>
<p>And whatever I do next,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be one of the interesting challenges</p>
<p>is how do you create that truth telling situation?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of why, by the way,</p>
<p>I think someone like Jack, when you start Square,</p>
<p>you have money, but you still, you bring on partners</p>
<p>because I think it creates</p>
<p>a truth telling type environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure this out.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s an interesting dynamic.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking of perhaps launching some kind of venture</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re investing in yourself?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m 37 going on 38 next month.</p>
<p>I have a long life to live.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely not gonna sit on the beach, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna do something at some point</p>
<p>and I gotta imagine I will like help fund it, right?</p>
<p>So the other way of thinking about this</p>
<p>is you can park your money in the SMP,</p>
<p>and this is bad</p>
<p>because the SMP has done wonderfully well last year, right?</p>
<p>Or you can invest in yourself.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not gonna invest in yourself,</p>
<p>you probably shouldn&rsquo;t do a startup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>And you can invest in yourself in the way Elon does,</p>
<p>which is basically go all in on this investment.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s one way to achieve accountability</p>
<p>is like you&rsquo;re kind of screwed if you fail.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>I personally like that.</p>
<p>I like burning bridges behind me</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;m fucked if it fails.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important though.</p>
<p>One of the things I think Mark said to me early on</p>
<p>that sticks with me that I think is true.</p>
<p>We were talking about people</p>
<p>who had left like operating roles</p>
<p>and started doing venture or something.</p>
<p>He was like, a lot of people convince themselves</p>
<p>they work really hard.</p>
<p>Like they think they work really hard</p>
<p>and they put on the show</p>
<p>and in their minds they work really hard,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t work very hard.</p>
<p>There is something about lighting a fire underneath you</p>
<p>and burning bridges such that you can&rsquo;t turn back.</p>
<p>That I think, we didn&rsquo;t talk about this specifically,</p>
<p>but I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>There is, you need to have that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s the self delusion at a certain scale.</p>
<p>Oh, I have so many board calls.</p>
<p>Oh, like we have all these things to figure out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is one of the hard parts</p>
<p>about it being an operator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there are so many people</p>
<p>that have made a lot of money not operating,</p>
<p>but operating is just one of the hardest things on earth.</p>
<p>It is just so effing hard.</p>
<p>It is stressful.</p>
<p>It is, you&rsquo;re dealing with real humans,</p>
<p>not just like throwing capital in and hoping it grows.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not undermining the VC mindset.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing and needed</p>
<p>and so many wonderful VCs I&rsquo;ve worked with.</p>
<p>But yeah, like when your ass is on the line</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s your money, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Talk to me in 10 years, we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but like you were saying, that is a source.</p>
<p>When you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and you look forward to the day full of challenges,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also where you can find happiness.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about love and friendship.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role in this heck of a difficult journey</p>
<p>you have been on of love, of friendship?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love in the human condition?</p>
<p>Well, first things first,</p>
<p>the woman I married, my wife, Nicole,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way I could do what I do if we weren&rsquo;t together.</p>
<p>She had the filter idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t go over that story.</p>
<p>Everything is a partnership, right?</p>
<p>And to achieve great things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about like someone pulling their weight in places.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not like someone&rsquo;s supporting you</p>
<p>so that you could do this other thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally like,</p>
<p>Mike and I and our partnership as cofounders is fascinating</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think Instagram would have happened</p>
<p>without that partnership.</p>
<p>Like either him or me alone, no way.</p>
<p>We pushed and pulled each other in a way</p>
<p>that allowed us to build a better thing because of it.</p>
<p>Nicole, she pushed me to work on the filters early on.</p>
<p>And yes, that&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun story, right?</p>
<p>But the truth of it is being able to like level</p>
<p>with someone about how hard the process is</p>
<p>and have someone see you for who you are before Instagram</p>
<p>and know that there&rsquo;s a constant you throughout all of this</p>
<p>and be able to call you when you&rsquo;re drifting from that,</p>
<p>but also support you when you&rsquo;re trying to stick with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I mean, that&rsquo;s true friendship slash love,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>But also it was for someone not to care.</p>
<p>I remember Nicole saying,</p>
<p>hey, like I know you&rsquo;re going to do this Instagram thing.</p>
<p>You should, I guess it was bourbon at the time.</p>
<p>You should do it because, you know,</p>
<p>even if it doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>we can move to like a smaller apartment and it&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ll make it work.</p>
<p>How beautiful is that, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like a superpower</p>
<p>that gives you permission to fail.</p>
<p>And somehow that actually leads to success.</p>
<p>But also she&rsquo;s like the least impressed</p>
<p>about Instagram of anyone.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But like, I love you for you.</p>
<p>Like, I like that you&rsquo;re like a decent cook.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful with the Gantt chart and Thanksgiving,</p>
<p>which I still think is a brilliant effing idea.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Big, ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Have you, you&rsquo;re old and wise at this stage.</p>
<p>So have you discovered meaning to this whole thing?</p>
<p>Why the hell are we descendants of apes here on earth?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I am, so the crazy,</p>
<p>so the best learning for me has been like,</p>
<p>no matter what level of success you achieve,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still worried about similar things,</p>
<p>just maybe on a slightly different scale.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still concerned about the same thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still self conscious about the same things.</p>
<p>Just like, and actually that moment going through that</p>
<p>is what makes you believe there&rsquo;s gotta be like</p>
<p>more machinery to life or purpose to life.</p>
<p>And that we&rsquo;re all chasing these materialistic things,</p>
<p>but you start realizing like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like, you know, the Truman Show</p>
<p>when he gets to the edge and he like knocks against it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, what?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s this awakening that happens</p>
<p>when you get to that edge that you realize,</p>
<p>oh, like sure, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great that we all chase money and fame and success.</p>
<p>But you hit the edge and I&rsquo;m not even claiming</p>
<p>I hit an edge like Elon&rsquo;s hit an edge.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s clearly larger scales.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s cool is you learn that,</p>
<p>like it doesn&rsquo;t actually matter</p>
<p>and that there are all these other things that truly matter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a case for working less hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a case for taking it easy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a case for the four day work week.</p>
<p>What that is a case for is designing your life</p>
<p>exactly the way you want to design it.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t know, I think we go around the earth,</p>
<p>you know, the sun a certain number of times</p>
<p>and then we die and then that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of that moment?</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>In fact, or at least not yet.</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m like a pilot, like I do crazy things</p>
<p>and I like, no, I like, if anything, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, I got to choose mindfully and purposefully</p>
<p>the thing I am doing right now and not just fall into it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to wake up one day and ask yourself</p>
<p>why the hell you spent the last 10 years doing X, Y or Z?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I guess my like shorter answer to this is</p>
<p>doing things on purpose because you choose to do them.</p>
<p>So important in life and not just like floating</p>
<p>down the river of life, hitting branches along the way</p>
<p>cause you will hit branches, right?</p>
<p>But rather like literally plotting a course</p>
<p>and not having a 10 year plan,</p>
<p>but just choosing every day to opt in.</p>
<p>That I think has been more like,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t figured out the meaning of life</p>
<p>by any stretch of the imagination,</p>
<p>but it certainly isn&rsquo;t money and it certainly isn&rsquo;t fame</p>
<p>and it certainly isn&rsquo;t travel.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, and it&rsquo;s way more of like opting</p>
<p>into the game you love playing.</p>
<p>Every day opting in.</p>
<p>Just opting in and like, don&rsquo;t let it happen.</p>
<p>You opt in.</p>
<p>Kevin, it&rsquo;s great to end on love and the meaning of life.</p>
<p>This was an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun, thank you.</p>
<p>You gave me like a light into some fascinating aspects</p>
<p>of this technical world.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t honestly wait to see what you do next.</p>
