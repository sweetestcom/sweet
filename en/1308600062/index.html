    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to discuss the gut and the brain,</p>
<p>and we are going to discuss how your gut</p>
<p>influences your brain and your brain influences your gut.</p>
<p>As many of you probably know,</p>
<p>there is a phenomenon called your gut feeling,</p>
<p>which tends to be something that you seem to know</p>
<p>without really knowing how you know it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one version of the gut feeling.</p>
<p>The other is that you sense something</p>
<p>in your actual gut, in your body,</p>
<p>and that that somehow drives you to think or feel</p>
<p>or act in a particular way,</p>
<p>maybe to move towards something</p>
<p>or to move away from something.</p>
<p>Now, today, we aren&rsquo;t going to focus so much</p>
<p>on the psychology of gut feelings,</p>
<p>but on the biology of gut feelings</p>
<p>and how the gut and brain interact,</p>
<p>because indeed, your gut is communicating to your brain</p>
<p>both directly by way of neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>and indirectly by changing the chemistry of your body,</p>
<p>which permeates up to your brain</p>
<p>and impacts various aspects of brain function.</p>
<p>But it works in the other direction too.</p>
<p>Your brain is influencing your entire gut,</p>
<p>and when I say entire gut, I don&rsquo;t just mean your stomach,</p>
<p>I mean your entire digestive tract.</p>
<p>Your brain is impacting things</p>
<p>like how quickly your food is digesting,</p>
<p>the chemistry of your gut.</p>
<p>If you happen to be stressed or not stressed,</p>
<p>whether or not you are under a particular social challenge</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re particularly happy</p>
<p>will in fact adjust the chemistry of your gut,</p>
<p>and the chemistry of your gut in turn</p>
<p>will change the way that your brain works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put all that together for you</p>
<p>in the context of what we call the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The gut microbiome are the trillions of little bacteria</p>
<p>that live all the way along your digestive tract</p>
<p>and that strongly impact the way</p>
<p>that your entire body works at the level of metabolism,</p>
<p>immune system, and brain function.</p>
<p>And of course, we will discuss tools,</p>
<p>things that you can do in order to maintain</p>
<p>or improve your gut health.</p>
<p>Because as you&rsquo;ll also soon see,</p>
<p>gut health is immensely important</p>
<p>for all aspects of our wellbeing,</p>
<p>at the level of our brain, at the level of our body.</p>
<p>And there are simple, actionable things that we can all do</p>
<p>in order to optimize our gut health</p>
<p>in ways that optimize</p>
<p>our overall nervous system functioning.</p>
<p>So we will be sure to review those today.</p>
<p>This episode also serves as a bit of a primer</p>
<p>for our guest episode that&rsquo;s coming up next week</p>
<p>with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg from Stanford University.</p>
<p>Dr. Sonnenberg is a world expert in the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And so we will dive really deep into the gut microbiome</p>
<p>in all its complexity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make it all very simple for you.</p>
<p>We will also talk about actionable tools in that episode.</p>
<p>This episode is a standalone episode,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll get a lot of information and tools.</p>
<p>But if you have the opportunity to see this episode first,</p>
<p>I think it will serve as a nice primer</p>
<p>for the conversation with Dr. Sonnenberg.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health, even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure that you&rsquo;re staying</p>
<p>on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase, they&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements.</p>
<p>And just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about the gut and the brain</p>
<p>and how your gut and your brain communicate</p>
<p>in both directions.</p>
<p>Because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>your gut is communicating all the time with your brain</p>
<p>and your brain is communicating all the time with your gut.</p>
<p>And so the two are in this ongoing dance with one another</p>
<p>that ordinarily is below your conscious detection,</p>
<p>although you&rsquo;re probably familiar with the experience</p>
<p>of every once in a while getting a stomach ache</p>
<p>or of eating something that doesn&rsquo;t agree with you</p>
<p>or conversely eating something</p>
<p>that you find particularly delicious.</p>
<p>And that sensation or that experience rather</p>
<p>being a whole body experience.</p>
<p>Your mind is excited about what you&rsquo;re eating or just ate.</p>
<p>Your gut is excited about what you&rsquo;re eating or just ate.</p>
<p>And it seems to be a kind of unified perception</p>
<p>of both brain and body.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about how that comes about</p>
<p>in the negative sense,</p>
<p>like when you meet someone you really dislike</p>
<p>or when you have a stomach ache and in the positive sense,</p>
<p>when you interact with somebody that you really, really like</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d like to spend more time with them, for instance,</p>
<p>or when you eat something that you really, really like</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d like to spend more time with that food,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>Now, the gut and the brain represent</p>
<p>what we call a biological circuit,</p>
<p>meaning they include different stations.</p>
<p>So station A communicates with station B,</p>
<p>which communicates with station C and so on.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier, it is bi-directional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a two-way street between gut and brain.</p>
<p>I want to make the important point at the outset</p>
<p>that when I say the word gut, when I refer to the gut,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just referring to the stomach.</p>
<p>Most of us think that the gut equates to the stomach</p>
<p>because we think of having a gut or not having a gut</p>
<p>or having a gut feeling of some sort.</p>
<p>But in the context of gut brain signaling</p>
<p>and the related microbiome,</p>
<p>the gut includes the entire digestive tract.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, from start to finish,</p>
<p>the entire digestive tract.</p>
<p>So much so that today we&rsquo;re going to talk about,</p>
<p>for instance, the presence of neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>that reside in your gut,</p>
<p>that communicate to specific locations in the brain</p>
<p>and cause the release of specific neurochemicals,</p>
<p>such as the neurochemical dopamine or serotonin,</p>
<p>that can motivate you to seek more of a particular food</p>
<p>or type of interaction or behavior,</p>
<p>or to avoid particular foods, interactions, and behaviors.</p>
<p>And some of those neurons, many of those neurons, in fact,</p>
<p>reside in your intestines, not in your stomach.</p>
<p>They can be in the small intestine or the large intestine.</p>
<p>In fact, you actually have taste receptors</p>
<p>and neurons located all along your digestive tract.</p>
<p>You have neurons that are located</p>
<p>all along your digestive tract,</p>
<p>and they are communicating to your brain</p>
<p>to impact what you think, what you feel, and what you do.</p>
<p>Okay, so for the gut brain axis,</p>
<p>we need to deal with the brain part,</p>
<p>and then we need to deal with the gut part.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just quickly talk about the brain part,</p>
<p>because there, the word brain is also a bit of a misnomer,</p>
<p>in that when we say the gut brain axis,</p>
<p>it does include the brain,</p>
<p>but includes a lot of other things as well.</p>
<p>So as many of you probably know by now,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listeners of this podcast,</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s fine,</p>
<p>your nervous system includes your brain</p>
<p>and your spinal cord,</p>
<p>and those together constitute</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Your neural retinas,</p>
<p>which are the lining the back of your eyes</p>
<p>and are the light sensing portion of your eyes,</p>
<p>are also part of your central nervous system.</p>
<p>So actually your eyes are part of your brain,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the only parts of your brain</p>
<p>that are outside the cranial vault.</p>
<p>So your retinas, your brain proper,</p>
<p>and your spinal cord make up the central nervous system.</p>
<p>The other parts of your nervous system</p>
<p>constitute what&rsquo;s called the peripheral nervous system,</p>
<p>which are the components of your nervous system</p>
<p>that reside outside the retinas, brain, and spinal cord.</p>
<p>Now, this is very important</p>
<p>because today we&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about</p>
<p>how the gut communicates with the brain,</p>
<p>and it does that by way</p>
<p>of peripheral nervous system components,</p>
<p>meaning nerve cells that reside in the gut</p>
<p>and elsewhere in the body that communicate to the brain</p>
<p>and cross into the central nervous system</p>
<p>to influence what you think and what you feel, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the nervous system part</p>
<p>of what we call the gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>Brain, again, just being a shorthand</p>
<p>for including all the elements I just described.</p>
<p>Gut, as you now know,</p>
<p>includes all the elements of the digestive tract.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the architecture</p>
<p>or the structure of the gut of your digestive system.</p>
<p>Now, not surprisingly, your digestive system,</p>
<p>aka your gut, begins at your mouth and ends at your anus.</p>
<p>And all along its length,</p>
<p>there are a series of sphincters</p>
<p>that cut off certain chambers of the digestive tract</p>
<p>from the other chambers.</p>
<p>Now, also along this tube that we call the digestive tract,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s great variation in the degree of acidity</p>
<p>or pH, as it&rsquo;s sometimes called.</p>
<p>That variation in acidity turns out to give rise</p>
<p>to different little microenvironments</p>
<p>in which particular microbiota, microbacteria,</p>
<p>can thrive or fail to thrive.</p>
<p>And so the way I&rsquo;d like you to think</p>
<p>about the digestive tract,</p>
<p>this gut component of the gut-brain axis,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not just one component.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just your stomach with a particular acidity</p>
<p>and a bunch of microorganisms that work particularly well</p>
<p>to make you feel good</p>
<p>and make your digestive pathways work well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a series of chambers, little microenvironments,</p>
<p>in which particular microbiota thrive</p>
<p>and other microbiota do not.</p>
<p>And certain behaviors that you undertake</p>
<p>and certain experiences that you have</p>
<p>will adjust those microenvironments</p>
<p>in ways that make particular microbiota, certain bacteria,</p>
<p>more likely to thrive and others less likely to thrive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about how that was set up for you early in life.</p>
<p>Actually, from the moment that you came into the world,</p>
<p>that microbiome was being established.</p>
<p>It was actually strongly impacted,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you were born by C-section</p>
<p>or by vaginal birth.</p>
<p>And it was strongly impacted by who handled you</p>
<p>when you came into the world.</p>
<p>Literally the hands that were on you,</p>
<p>how much skin contact you had,</p>
<p>whether or not you were a preemie baby or not,</p>
<p>whether or not you had pets at home,</p>
<p>whether or not you were allowed to play in the dirt,</p>
<p>whether or not you were allowed to eat snails,</p>
<p>or whether or not you were kept</p>
<p>in a very antiseptic environment.</p>
<p>All of those experiences</p>
<p>shaped these little microenvironments</p>
<p>and shaped what constitutes best or worst</p>
<p>for those microenvironments, okay?</p>
<p>So you have this long tube that we call the digestive tract</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very, very long.</p>
<p>In fact, if we were to splay it out,</p>
<p>we were to take all the curves and turns</p>
<p>out of the intestine, we would find that it is very long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s approximately nine meters long.</p>
<p>Now the structure of that digestive tract</p>
<p>turns out to be very important</p>
<p>in terms of gut brain signaling.</p>
<p>Once again, it&rsquo;s a tube and the hollow of that tube</p>
<p>is called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N.</p>
<p>But the walls of the tube are not necessarily smooth,</p>
<p>at least not for significant portions</p>
<p>of the digestive tract.</p>
<p>For much of the digestive tract,</p>
<p>there are bumps and grooves that look very much</p>
<p>like the folds in the brain,</p>
<p>but these bumps and grooves are made up of other tissues.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re made up of what&rsquo;s called a mucosal lining.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of mucus there.</p>
<p>And if we were to look really closely,</p>
<p>what we would find is that there are little hairy</p>
<p>like cellular processes that we call microvilli</p>
<p>that are able to push things along the digestive tract.</p>
<p>The microbiota reside everywhere along the lumen</p>
<p>of the digestive tract, starting at the mouth</p>
<p>and all the way to the other end.</p>
<p>And they reside within those microvilli</p>
<p>and they reside within the lumen.</p>
<p>And if we were to look really closely</p>
<p>at the bumps and grooves along the digestive tract,</p>
<p>what we would find is that there are little niches,</p>
<p>little areas in which particular things</p>
<p>can grow and reside best.</p>
<p>Now that might sound kind of gross,</p>
<p>but it actually is a good thing,</p>
<p>especially what&rsquo;s growing and residing there</p>
<p>are microbacterial organisms that are good for your gut</p>
<p>and that signal good things to your brain.</p>
<p>And we will talk about what that signaling looks like</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s done and accomplished in just a few moments.</p>
<p>But I want you to get a clear mental picture of your gut,</p>
<p>something that we don&rsquo;t often see.</p>
<p>And often when we think about the gut,</p>
<p>again, we just think about the hollow of the stomach,</p>
<p>food going in there and getting digested,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s far more complex</p>
<p>and actually far more interesting than that.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve been referring to the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and to the microbiota and these bacteria.</p>
<p>Let me define those terms a little bit more specifically</p>
<p>just to avoid any confusion.</p>
<p>The microbiota are the actual bacteria.</p>
<p>The microbiome is used to refer to the bacteria,</p>
<p>but also all the genes that those bacteria make</p>
<p>because it turns out that they make some important genes</p>
<p>that actually impact all of us.</p>
<p>You have loads and loads of these little microbiota,</p>
<p>these bacteria.</p>
<p>In fact, right now you are carrying with you</p>
<p>about two to three kilograms.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s more than six pounds of these microbiota,</p>
<p>these bacteria.</p>
<p>And if we were to look at them under a microscope,</p>
<p>what we would see is</p>
<p>these are relatively simple little organisms.</p>
<p>Some remain stationary.</p>
<p>So they might plop down into the mucosal lining</p>
<p>or they might hang out on a particular microvilli</p>
<p>or they might be in one of those little niches</p>
<p>and others can move about.</p>
<p>But they basically fill the entire lumen.</p>
<p>They surround and kind of coat the surface</p>
<p>of the microvilli and they&rsquo;re tucked up</p>
<p>into any of those little niches</p>
<p>that are available to them to tuck into.</p>
<p>If you were to take the head of a pin</p>
<p>and look at it under the microscope,</p>
<p>you could fit many, many hundreds,</p>
<p>if not thousands or more of these little microbacteria.</p>
<p>And the reason I say many, many thousands or more,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving a kind of broad range there,</p>
<p>is that they do vary in size.</p>
<p>And again, they vary as to whether or not they can move</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re constantly turning over in your gut,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re being born, so to speak,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re dying off.</p>
<p>And some will stay there for very long periods of time</p>
<p>within your gut and others will get excreted.</p>
<p>About 60% of your stool,</p>
<p>as unpleasant as that might be to think about,</p>
<p>is made up of live and dead microbacteria.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re constantly making</p>
<p>and excreting these microbacteria.</p>
<p>And which microbacteria you make</p>
<p>and how many stay inside your gut and how many leave,</p>
<p>meaning how many are excreted,</p>
<p>depends a lot on the chemistry of your gut</p>
<p>and depends very strongly on the foods that you eat</p>
<p>and the foods that you do not eat.</p>
<p>Now, just because what we eat</p>
<p>strongly influences our microbiome,</p>
<p>meaning our microbacteria,</p>
<p>does not mean that there are not other influences</p>
<p>on what constitutes our microbiome.</p>
<p>Our microbiome is also made up by microbacteria</p>
<p>that access our digestive tract through our mouth,</p>
<p>through breathing, through kissing,</p>
<p>and through skin contact.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the major determinants of our microbiome</p>
<p>is who we interact with</p>
<p>and the environment that we happen to be in.</p>
<p>And that actually includes</p>
<p>whether or not we interact with animals.</p>
<p>In a little bit, I&rsquo;ll talk about some data</p>
<p>as to whether or not you grew up in a home that had animals,</p>
<p>whether or not you grew up in a home,</p>
<p>whether or not there was a lot of social contact,</p>
<p>meaning skin contact,</p>
<p>or whether or not you grew up in a more animal-sparse,</p>
<p>contact-sparse environment</p>
<p>and how that shapes your microbiome.</p>
<p>But the simple point is</p>
<p>that what you eat influences your microbiome,</p>
<p>but also what you do, what you think, and what you feel.</p>
<p>And many of the little microbacteria</p>
<p>that get into your digestive tract</p>
<p>do so by way of social interactions.</p>
<p>In fact, if you ask a neurobiologist</p>
<p>what the role of the microbiome is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell you almost certainly</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s there to impact brain function.</p>
<p>But if you have friends that are microbiologists,</p>
<p>such as I do, they&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>well, maybe the brain and nervous system</p>
<p>are there to support the microbiome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the other way around.</p>
<p>You have all these little microorganisms</p>
<p>that are taking residence in our body.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really know what they&rsquo;re doing as far as we know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that they have a consciousness or they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t rule that out, but it seems pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they are taking advantage</p>
<p>of the different environments</p>
<p>all along your digestive tract.</p>
<p>They are taking advantage</p>
<p>of the sorts of social interactions.</p>
<p>For instance, the people you talk to</p>
<p>and that breathe on you,</p>
<p>the people that you shake hands with,</p>
<p>the people that you kiss or don&rsquo;t kiss,</p>
<p>the people that you happen</p>
<p>to be romantically involved with or not,</p>
<p>your dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat,</p>
<p>whatever pet you happen to own is impacting your microbiome.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no question about that.</p>
<p>So hopefully now you have some sense</p>
<p>of the architecture of the digestive pathway</p>
<p>and you have some sense of the trillions</p>
<p>of little micro bacteria that are living all along</p>
<p>the different components of that digestive pathway.</p>
<p>But what we haven&rsquo;t talked about yet</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;d like to talk about now</p>
<p>is what those little microbiota are actually doing</p>
<p>in your digestive tract.</p>
<p>In addition to just living there</p>
<p>for their own intents and purposes,</p>
<p>they are contributing, for instance, to your digestion.</p>
<p>Many of the genes that those microbiota make</p>
<p>are genes that are involved in fermentation</p>
<p>and genes that are involved in digestion</p>
<p>of particular types of nutrients.</p>
<p>And in a little bit,</p>
<p>we will talk about how what you eat</p>
<p>can actually change the enzymes</p>
<p>that those microbiome components make.</p>
<p>Enzymes largely being things</p>
<p>that are responsible for digestion.</p>
<p>They catalyze other sorts of cellular events,</p>
<p>but in the context of the digestive pathway,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about enzymes that help digest your food.</p>
<p>So those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways.</p>
<p>And if you lack certain microbiota that can help you digest,</p>
<p>it stands to reason that you would have challenges</p>
<p>digesting certain types of foods.</p>
<p>The other amazing thing that these microbiota do</p>
<p>is they change the way that your brain functions</p>
<p>by way of metabolizing or facilitating the metabolism</p>
<p>of particular neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>So one of the ways that having certain microbiota</p>
<p>present in your gut can improve your mood</p>
<p>or degrade your mood, for instance,</p>
<p>is by way of certain microbiota being converted into</p>
<p>or facilitating the conversion of chemicals such as GABA.</p>
<p>GABA is what we call an inhibitory neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in suppressing the action of other neurons.</p>
<p>And that might sound like a bad thing,</p>
<p>but all types of sedatives, for instance, alcohol,</p>
<p>and a lot of neurons that naturally make GABA</p>
<p>can help quiet certain circuits in the brain.</p>
<p>For instance, circuits responsible for anxiety.</p>
<p>In people who have epilepsy,</p>
<p>the GABAergic neurons as they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>can often be disrupted in their signaling,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re not cranking out as much GABA.</p>
<p>And therefore the excitatory neurons,</p>
<p>which typically release other molecules like glutamate</p>
<p>can engage in what&rsquo;s called runaway excitation.</p>
<p>And that can give us rise to seizures.</p>
<p>So the simple message here is that the microbiota</p>
<p>by way of making neurochemicals</p>
<p>can influence the way that your brain functions.</p>
<p>So you want to support those microbiota</p>
<p>and we will give you tools to support those microbiota.</p>
<p>But the takeaway at this point is that those microbiota</p>
<p>are making things locally to help digest food.</p>
<p>Other microbiota are helping to make</p>
<p>certain neurotransmitters like GABA.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll also talk about dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p>And so the very specific microbiota that reside in your gut</p>
<p>have a profound influence</p>
<p>on many, many biological functions,</p>
<p>especially immune system function,</p>
<p>brain function, and digestion.</p>
<p>So that should give you a fairly complete picture</p>
<p>of your gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about how your microbiome</p>
<p>and your brain communicate,</p>
<p>or more accurately how your microbiome</p>
<p>and the rest of your nervous system communicate.</p>
<p>Neurons, which simply means nerve cells,</p>
<p>are the cells that do most of the heavy lifting</p>
<p>in your nervous system.</p>
<p>There are of course other cell types</p>
<p>that are important, glial cells, for instance,</p>
<p>very, very important cell types.</p>
<p>You have endothelial cells,</p>
<p>which are responsible for blood flow,</p>
<p>pericytes and other types of cells.</p>
<p>But the neurons are really doing most of the heavy lifting</p>
<p>for most of the things we think about</p>
<p>in terms of nervous system function.</p>
<p>You have neurons in your gut</p>
<p>and that should not surprise you.</p>
<p>Neurons reside in your brain, your spinal cord, your eyes,</p>
<p>in fact, all over your body.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got them in your heart</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got them in your lungs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got them in your spleen</p>
<p>and they connect to all the different organs</p>
<p>and tissues of your body.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not surprising that you have neurons in your gut.</p>
<p>What is surprising, however,</p>
<p>is the presence of particular types of neurons</p>
<p>that reside near or in the mucosal lining</p>
<p>just next to that lumen of the gut</p>
<p>and that are paying attention,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain what I mean by paying attention,</p>
<p>to the components of the gut,</p>
<p>both the nutrients and the microbiota,</p>
<p>and thereby can send signals up to the brain</p>
<p>by way of a long wire that we call an axon</p>
<p>and can communicate what the chemistry</p>
<p>and what the nutritional quality</p>
<p>and what the other aspects of the environment</p>
<p>are at the gut at a given location up to the brain</p>
<p>in ways that can influence the brain to, for instance,</p>
<p>seek out more of a particular food.</p>
<p>Let me give you a sort of action-based picture of this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, like most people, you enjoy sweet foods.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly enjoy sweet foods,</p>
<p>but there are a few that I like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for a really good dark chocolate</p>
<p>or really good ice cream,</p>
<p>or I got this thing for donuts that seems to just not quit,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t tend to indulge it very often.</p>
<p>I do like them.</p>
<p>If I eat that particular food,</p>
<p>obviously digestion starts in the mouth,</p>
<p>there are enzymes there, it gets chewed up,</p>
<p>the food goes down into the gut.</p>
<p>These neurons are activated,</p>
<p>meaning that causes the neurons to be electrically active</p>
<p>when particular components,</p>
<p>certain nutrients in those foods are present.</p>
<p>And for the cell types,</p>
<p>or I should say the neuron types that matter here,</p>
<p>the nutrients that really trigger their activation</p>
<p>are sugar, fatty acids, and amino acids.</p>
<p>Now, these particular neurons</p>
<p>have the name enteroendocrine cells,</p>
<p>but more recently they&rsquo;ve been defined as neuropod cells.</p>
<p>Neuropod cells were discovered by Diego Bohorquez&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at Duke University.</p>
<p>This is a phenomenal set of discoveries</p>
<p>made mostly in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>These neuropod cells, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>are activated by sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids,</p>
<p>but have a particularly strong activation to sugars.</p>
<p>They do seem to be part of the sweet sensing system.</p>
<p>And even though I&rsquo;m focusing on this particular example,</p>
<p>they represent a really nice example</p>
<p>of how a particular set of nerve cells in our gut</p>
<p>is collecting information about what is there</p>
<p>at a particular location in the gut</p>
<p>and sending that information up to our brain.</p>
<p>Now they do that by way of a nerve pathway</p>
<p>called the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system.</p>
<p>And the vagus nerve is a little bit complex to describe</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just listening to this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re watching this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and use my hands as a diagram,</p>
<p>but really the best thing to do</p>
<p>if you really want to learn neuroanatomy</p>
<p>is to just imagine it in your mind as best you can.</p>
<p>And if you can track down a picture of it, terrific.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Neurons have a cell body that we call a soma.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where all the DNA are contained.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where a lot of the operating machinery</p>
<p>of the cells are contained</p>
<p>and a lot of the instructions for that cell of what to be</p>
<p>and how to operate are contained.</p>
<p>The cell bodies of these neurons or the relevant neurons</p>
<p>are actually up near the neck.</p>
<p>So you can think of them as kind of a clump of grapes</p>
<p>because cell bodies tend to be round or ovalish.</p>
<p>And then they send a process that we call an axon</p>
<p>in one direction out to the gut.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll send another process up into the brain.</p>
<p>And that little cluster near the neck that&rsquo;s relevant here</p>
<p>is called the nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E.</p>
<p>The nodose ganglion is a little cluster of neurons</p>
<p>on either side of the neck.</p>
<p>It has a process that goes out to the gut</p>
<p>and a process that goes up into the brain.</p>
<p>And again, these are just one component</p>
<p>of the so-called vagus nerve.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve has many, many branches,</p>
<p>not just to the gut.</p>
<p>There are also branches to the liver,</p>
<p>branches to the lungs, branches to the heart,</p>
<p>branches to the larynx, and even to the spleen</p>
<p>and other areas of the body that are important.</p>
<p>But right now we&rsquo;re just concentrating on the neurons</p>
<p>that are in the gut that signal up to the brain.</p>
<p>And what the Bohorkes lab has shown</p>
<p>is that these neuropod cells are part of this network.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sensing several different nutrients,</p>
<p>but in particular, when they send sugar,</p>
<p>they send signals in the form of electrical firing</p>
<p>up to the brain in ways that trigger activation</p>
<p>of other brain stations that cause you to seek out</p>
<p>more of that particular food.</p>
<p>Now, this brings us to some classic experiments</p>
<p>that at least to me are incredible.</p>
<p>And these are highly reproducible findings</p>
<p>showing for instance, that even if you bypass taste</p>
<p>by infusing sweet liquid or putting sweet foods</p>
<p>into the gut and people can never taste them</p>
<p>with their mouth, people will seek out more</p>
<p>of that particular food.</p>
<p>And if you give them the option to have a sweet food</p>
<p>infused into their gut or a bitter food infused</p>
<p>into their gut or a sweet versus sour</p>
<p>or a more sweet versus less sweet food,</p>
<p>people have a selective preference for sweet foods</p>
<p>even if they can&rsquo;t taste them.</p>
<p>Now, this is important to understand</p>
<p>in the context of gut brain signaling,</p>
<p>because we always think that we like sweet foods</p>
<p>because of the way they taste.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s still true,</p>
<p>but much of what we consider the great taste of a sweet food</p>
<p>also has to do with a gut sensation</p>
<p>that is below our conscious detection.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>Well, the Bohorkes lab has performed experiments</p>
<p>using modern methods and their classic experiments</p>
<p>showing that animals and humans will actively seek out</p>
<p>more of a particular sweet food</p>
<p>even if it bypasses this taste system.</p>
<p>And the reverse is also true.</p>
<p>There have been experiments done in animals and in humans</p>
<p>that have allowed animals or humans to select</p>
<p>and eat sweet foods, and indeed that&rsquo;s what they do</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re given the option.</p>
<p>And yet to somehow eliminate the activation</p>
<p>of these neurons within the gut that can sense sweet foods.</p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of different ways</p>
<p>that those experiments have been done.</p>
<p>In classic experiments that date back to the 80s,</p>
<p>this was done by what&rsquo;s called sub diaphragmatic vagotomy.</p>
<p>So this means cutting off the branch of the vagus</p>
<p>that innervates the gut below the diaphragm</p>
<p>so that the other organs can still function</p>
<p>because the vagus is very important.</p>
<p>But basically cutting off the sweet sensing in the gut,</p>
<p>still giving people the opportunity</p>
<p>to taste sweet foods with their mouth.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t actively seek out</p>
<p>quite as much of the sweet food</p>
<p>when they don&rsquo;t have this gut sensing mechanism</p>
<p>that we now know to be dependent on these neuropod cells.</p>
<p>More recent experiments involve selective silencing</p>
<p>of these neuropod cells.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been a lot of different derivations</p>
<p>of this sort of thing.</p>
<p>But the takeaway from it is that our experience of</p>
<p>and our desire for particular foods</p>
<p>has everything to do with how those foods taste.</p>
<p>It also has to do as you probably know with their texture</p>
<p>and the sensation of those foods in our mouth</p>
<p>and even indeed how they go down our throat</p>
<p>sometimes can be very pleasing or very unpleasant.</p>
<p>And it also has to do with this subconscious processing</p>
<p>of taste that occurs in the gut itself.</p>
<p>And again, when I say gut, I don&rsquo;t just mean in the stomach.</p>
<p>There are actually neurons, neuropod cells</p>
<p>further down your digestive tract</p>
<p>which are signaling to your brain</p>
<p>about the presence of sweet foods</p>
<p>as well as foods such as amino acid rich foods</p>
<p>or foods that are rich in particular types of fatty acids</p>
<p>signaling up to your brain</p>
<p>and causing you to seek out more of those foods</p>
<p>or to consume more of those foods.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re probably asking, what is the signal?</p>
<p>How does it actually make me want more of those foods</p>
<p>without me realizing it?</p>
<p>Well, it does that by adjusting the release</p>
<p>of particular neuromodulators.</p>
<p>For those of you that are not familiar</p>
<p>with neuromodulators,</p>
<p>these are similar to neurotransmitters</p>
<p>but they tend to act more broadly.</p>
<p>They tend to impact many more neurons all at once.</p>
<p>And they go by names like dopamine, serotonin,</p>
<p>acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth.</p>
<p>Sometimes people refer to those as neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Technically they are neuromodulators.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll refer to them almost always as neuromodulators.</p>
<p>The neuropod cells signal by way</p>
<p>of a particular branch of the vagus</p>
<p>through that no-dose ganglion that we talked about before</p>
<p>and through a number of different stations in the brainstem</p>
<p>eventually cause the release of the neuromodulator dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is often associated</p>
<p>with a sense of pleasure and reward,</p>
<p>but it is more appropriately thought of</p>
<p>as a neuromodulator that impacts motivation,</p>
<p>craving, and pursuit.</p>
<p>It tends to put us into modes of action,</p>
<p>not necessarily running and moving through space,</p>
<p>although it can do that too.</p>
<p>But in the context of feeding,</p>
<p>it tends to make us look around more,</p>
<p>chew more, reach for things more,</p>
<p>and seek out more of whatever it is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s giving us that sensation of delight or satisfaction.</p>
<p>And again, that sense of delight and satisfaction</p>
<p>you might experience only consciously</p>
<p>as the way that something tastes on your mouth,</p>
<p>but it actually is caused again</p>
<p>by both the sensations in your mouth,</p>
<p>but also by the activation of these neuropod cells.</p>
<p>So this is an incredible system of gut-brain signaling,</p>
<p>and it is but one system of gut-brain signaling.</p>
<p>It turns out it&rsquo;s the system that we know the most about</p>
<p>at this point in time.</p>
<p>There are other components of gut-brain signaling</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>For instance, the serotonin system.</p>
<p>But in terms of examples of gut-brain signaling</p>
<p>for which we know a lot of the individual elements</p>
<p>and how they work,</p>
<p>I think this neuropod neuron sensing of sweet foods,</p>
<p>fatty acids, and amino acids in the gut</p>
<p>and communicating that up to the brain</p>
<p>by way of the vagus and causing us to seek out</p>
<p>more of the foods that deliver those nutrients</p>
<p>is an incredible pathway that really delineates the beauty</p>
<p>and the power of this gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>Let me talk about timescales.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m talking about a particular type of neuron</p>
<p>that is signaling up to the brain using electrical signals</p>
<p>to cause us to want to seek out</p>
<p>a particular category of foods.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s happening relatively fast</p>
<p>compared to the hormone pathways of the gut,</p>
<p>which also involve neurons.</p>
<p>So your gut is also communicating to your brain</p>
<p>by way of neurons, nerve cells.</p>
<p>But some of those nerve cells also release hormones,</p>
<p>and those hormones go by names like CCK,</p>
<p>glucagon-like peptide one, PYY, et cetera.</p>
<p>A good example of a hormone pathway</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s sometimes called a hormone peptide pathway</p>
<p>that is similar to the pathway I&rsquo;ve talked about before,</p>
<p>but a little bit slower is the ghrelin pathway.</p>
<p>Ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N, increases with fasting.</p>
<p>So the longer it&rsquo;s been since you&rsquo;ve eaten,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re just eating very little food</p>
<p>compared to your caloric needs,</p>
<p>ghrelin levels are going to go up in your bloodstream,</p>
<p>and they go up because of processes</p>
<p>that include processes within the gut</p>
<p>and include the nervous system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a slow pathway driving you</p>
<p>to seek out food generally.</p>
<p>As far as we know, the ghrelin system is not partial</p>
<p>to seeking out of sweet foods or fatty foods or so on.</p>
<p>Ghrelin increases the longer it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;ve eaten sufficient calories,</p>
<p>and it stimulates a feeling of you wanting to seek out food.</p>
<p>Well, how does it do that?</p>
<p>It does that, again,</p>
<p>by impacting neural circuits within the brain,</p>
<p>neural circuits that include</p>
<p>what we call the brainstem autonomic centers.</p>
<p>So it tends to make you feel alert</p>
<p>and quite, we say, high levels of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t eaten in a while,</p>
<p>you might think that you just get really exhausted, right?</p>
<p>Because we all hear that food is energy</p>
<p>and caloric energy is what we need to burn,</p>
<p>but you actually have a lot of energy stored in your body</p>
<p>that you would be able to use if you really needed energy.</p>
<p>But typically we haven&rsquo;t eaten in a while,</p>
<p>we start to get agitated,</p>
<p>and we get agitated by way of release</p>
<p>of the neuromodulator epinephrine,</p>
<p>which causes us to look around more,</p>
<p>move around more and seek out food.</p>
<p>That all occurs in brainstem autonomic centers</p>
<p>and in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>We did an entire episode on feeding behavior</p>
<p>and metabolism as well,</p>
<p>and you can find those episodes at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to go into a lot of detail</p>
<p>about hypothalamic and brainstem centers,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a particular area of the brain</p>
<p>called the nucleus of the solitary tract,</p>
<p>the NST as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very strongly impacted by these circulating hormones</p>
<p>and tends to drive us toward feeding behavior.</p>
<p>So the important point here is that we have a fast system</p>
<p>that is paying attention to the nutrients in our gut</p>
<p>or the absence of nutrients in our gut</p>
<p>and stimulating us to seek out food</p>
<p>or to stop eating certain foods.</p>
<p>And we have a slower hormone related system</p>
<p>that also originates in the gut and impacts the brain,</p>
<p>but all of those converge on neural circuits for feeding.</p>
<p>The neural circuits for feeding</p>
<p>include things like the arcuate nucleus, the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>they include a bunch of other neurochemicals,</p>
<p>but the point is that you&rsquo;ve got a fast route</p>
<p>and a slow route to drive you to eat more or eat less,</p>
<p>to seek out food and consume it,</p>
<p>or to stop eating and to essentially kickstart</p>
<p>the satiety mechanisms as they&rsquo;re called.</p>
<p>And those are operating in parallel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like one happens first and stops then the other,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always operating in parallel.</p>
<p>And I bring this up because there&rsquo;s a bigger theme here,</p>
<p>which we see over and over again in biology,</p>
<p>which is the concept of parallel pathways.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve always got multiple accelerators</p>
<p>and multiple brakes on a system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very rare to have just one accelerator</p>
<p>and one brake on the system.</p>
<p>And this will become important later</p>
<p>when we talk about tools for optimizing your gut microbiome</p>
<p>for healthy eating and for healthy digestion</p>
<p>and for healthy brain function.</p>
<p>I want to take a moment and talk about</p>
<p>glucagon-like peptide one, which is also called GLP-1.</p>
<p>GLP-1 is made by neurons in the gut</p>
<p>and by neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>This is a fairly recent discovery, but it&rsquo;s an important one.</p>
<p>GLP-1 tends to inhibit feeding and tends to reduce appetite.</p>
<p>There are a number of drugs released on the market now.</p>
<p>GLP-1, for instance, goes by the name semaglutide,</p>
<p>which is essentially a GLP-1 agonist.</p>
<p>It causes the release of more GLP-1.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being used to treat type two diabetes,</p>
<p>which is insulin resistant diabetes.</p>
<p>This is different than type one diabetes</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t actually make insulin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also being used as a drug to reduce obesity.</p>
<p>And it seems pretty effective,</p>
<p>at least in certain populations.</p>
<p>There are certain foods and substances that increase GLP-1.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about a few of these on the podcast.</p>
<p>One that I&rsquo;m a particular fan of for entirely other reasons</p>
<p>is yerba mate tea can stimulate the release of GLP-1.</p>
<p>In South America, it&rsquo;s often used as an appetite suppressant,</p>
<p>probably in large part because of its effects</p>
<p>on GLP-1 release, but probably also</p>
<p>because it does contain caffeine,</p>
<p>which is a bit of a stimulant,</p>
<p>which also can be involved in lipolysis,</p>
<p>which is the utilization of fat stores</p>
<p>for energy and so forth.</p>
<p>A brief mention about yerba mate.</p>
<p>There are some reports out there</p>
<p>that yerba mate can increase certain types of cancers.</p>
<p>The data that I&rsquo;ve seen on this is that it tends to relate</p>
<p>to whether or not those are smoked versions</p>
<p>of the yerba mate tea, the amount of consumption,</p>
<p>and the debate is still out.</p>
<p>So I invite you to look at those papers.</p>
<p>You can search for those online.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, yerba mate is one source of GLP-1 stimulation.</p>
<p>Semaglutide is another source.</p>
<p>It also can be stimulated by various foods,</p>
<p>nuts, avocados, eggs, and so forth.</p>
<p>Certain high-fiber complex grains will also stimulate GLP-1.</p>
<p>I raise this as not necessarily a route</p>
<p>that you want to take in order to reduce food intake.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know that that&rsquo;s your goal,</p>
<p>but that GLP-1 is another one of these</p>
<p>gut-to-brain signaling mechanisms that adjust appetite</p>
<p>that is dependent on diet,</p>
<p>depends on what you eat or drink,</p>
<p>and that the GLP-1 pathway does seem particularly sensitive</p>
<p>to the constituents of diet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s at least one quality study I was able to find</p>
<p>showing that the ketogenic diet, for instance,</p>
<p>which almost always involves ingestion</p>
<p>of very low levels of carbohydrate, can increase GLP-1.</p>
<p>Although, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>there are other foods that fall outside the range</p>
<p>of what we would consider ketogenic</p>
<p>that can also stimulate GLP-1.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned, there are prescription drugs</p>
<p>like semaglutide.</p>
<p>There are other ones as well now that stimulate GLP-1.</p>
<p>So how does GLP-1 reduce appetite?</p>
<p>It does that in part by changing the activity of neurons</p>
<p>in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>this cluster of neurons just above the roof of our mouth</p>
<p>that themselves make GLP-1</p>
<p>and that cause the activation of motor circuits</p>
<p>for reaching, chewing,</p>
<p>all the things that we associate with feeding behavior.</p>
<p>So I use GLP-1 as an example of a pathway</p>
<p>that you might choose to tap into</p>
<p>by ingestion of Yerba Mate</p>
<p>or by ingestion of the foods I mentioned,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s something that interests you, ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>But I also mention it simply because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another beautiful example</p>
<p>of how our hormone pathway</p>
<p>can impact the activity of brain circuits</p>
<p>that are directly involved in a particular behavior.</p>
<p>So yet another example of how gut is communicating to brain</p>
<p>in order to change what we think we want</p>
<p>or to change what our actual behaviors are.</p>
<p>So the next time you find yourself reaching for food</p>
<p>or you find yourself wanting a particular sweet thing</p>
<p>or fatty thing or something that contains</p>
<p>a lot of amino acids, a protein-rich food,</p>
<p>keep in mind that that&rsquo;s not just about</p>
<p>the taste of the food.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even necessarily about the nutrients</p>
<p>that you need or don&rsquo;t need, it could be,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also about the subconscious signaling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from your body all the time.</p>
<p>Waves of hormones, waves of nerve cell signals,</p>
<p>electrical signals that are changing the way</p>
<p>that your brain works.</p>
<p>And this raises for me a memory of the episode</p>
<p>that I did with Dr. Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a world expert colleague of mine at Stanford,</p>
<p>who is expert on things like hormones and behavior.</p>
<p>But we got into the topic of free will,</p>
<p>which is a bit of a barbed wire topic.</p>
<p>As many of you know,</p>
<p>it gets into the realm of philosophy, et cetera.</p>
<p>And we were kind of batting back and forth the idea.</p>
<p>I was saying, well, I think there&rsquo;s free will</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t there certainly be free will</p>
<p>or certainly the idea that we can avoid certain choices.</p>
<p>And Robert was saying, no.</p>
<p>In fact, he said, nah,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t believe that we have any free will.</p>
<p>He thinks that events in our brain are determined</p>
<p>by biological events that are below our conscious detection</p>
<p>and that occur seconds to milliseconds</p>
<p>before we make decisions or assessments.</p>
<p>And therefore we just can&rsquo;t control what we do,</p>
<p>what we think and what we feel.</p>
<p>And at the time I sort of didn&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>I thought, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just, I guess I really wanted to believe in free will.</p>
<p>And to some extent I still do.</p>
<p>But as we talk about how these neurons in our gut</p>
<p>and these hormones in our gut are influencing our brain</p>
<p>and the decisions that we are making</p>
<p>at the level of circuits like the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and the nucleus of the solitary tract,</p>
<p>these are areas of the brain way below our frontal cortex</p>
<p>and our conscious perception.</p>
<p>I think these are examples that really fall in favor</p>
<p>of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing,</p>
<p>which is that events that are happening within our body</p>
<p>are actually changing the way our brain works.</p>
<p>So we might think that we want the cupcake.</p>
<p>We might think that we don&rsquo;t need to eat something</p>
<p>or do need to eat something.</p>
<p>And that is entirely on the basis of prior knowledge</p>
<p>and decision-making that we&rsquo;re making with our head.</p>
<p>But in fact, it&rsquo;s very clear to me based on the work</p>
<p>from the Bohork&rsquo;s lab, classic work over the years,</p>
<p>dating back to the 80s and indeed back to the 50s</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>that our body is shaping the decisions</p>
<p>that our brain is making and we&rsquo;re not aware of it at all.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is that whether or not you believe</p>
<p>in free will or not, the simple knowledge</p>
<p>that this whole process is happening</p>
<p>can perhaps be a benefit to you.</p>
<p>You can perhaps leverage it to get some insight</p>
<p>and understanding and perhaps even a wedge</p>
<p>into your own behavior.</p>
<p>You might think, ah, I think I want that particular food</p>
<p>or I think I want to avoid that particular food,</p>
<p>but actually that&rsquo;s not a decision that I&rsquo;m making</p>
<p>on a purely rational basis.</p>
<p>It has a lot to do with what my gut is telling my brain.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve largely been talking about chemical communication</p>
<p>between the gut and the brain.</p>
<p>Chemical because even though these neuropod cells</p>
<p>are communicating with the brain</p>
<p>by way of electrical activity,</p>
<p>what we call action potentials,</p>
<p>and in neural language, we call those spikes,</p>
<p>spikes of action potentials.</p>
<p>Spikes of action potentials, meaning those neural signals,</p>
<p>cause the release of chemicals in the brain like dopamine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s chemical transmission.</p>
<p>Similarly, hormones, even though they act more slowly,</p>
<p>hormones like neuropeptide Y, like CCK, like ghrelin,</p>
<p>they are signaling chemically.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re moving through the body,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going in there affecting the chemical output</p>
<p>of different cells,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re changing the chemistry of those cells</p>
<p>and the chemistry of the cells that those cells talk to.</p>
<p>So that gives us one particular category of signaling</p>
<p>from gut to brain, which is chemical signaling.</p>
<p>But of course, there are other forms of signals,</p>
<p>and those fall under the category of mechanical signaling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever eaten a very large meal</p>
<p>or consumed a lot of fluid,</p>
<p>you experience that as distention of the gut,</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t just have to be distention of the stomach,</p>
<p>but distention of your intestines as well.</p>
<p>That distention is registered by neurons</p>
<p>that reside in your gut.</p>
<p>The signals go up to your brain</p>
<p>and communicate with areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are responsible for suppressing further consumption</p>
<p>of food and or fluid.</p>
<p>And under certain circumstances,</p>
<p>can also be associated with the activation</p>
<p>of neural circuits that cause vomiting</p>
<p>or the desire to vomit.</p>
<p>So if ever you&rsquo;ve eaten too much,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve eaten something that doesn&rsquo;t agree with you,</p>
<p>that information is communicated by way of mechanosensors</p>
<p>that sense the mechanics of your gut,</p>
<p>possibly also the chemistry of your gut,</p>
<p>but mostly the mechanics of your gut,</p>
<p>signal up to the brain and activate brain centers</p>
<p>that are involved in stopping the eating behavior</p>
<p>and activation of an area of the brainstem</p>
<p>that is affectionately referred to as the vomit center</p>
<p>among neuroanatomists.</p>
<p>This is a area that more appropriately</p>
<p>is called the chemoreceptor trigger zone,</p>
<p>the CTZ or area post-strema,</p>
<p>and neurons in this area actually will trigger</p>
<p>the vomiting reflex.</p>
<p>So the way that the gut and the brain communicate</p>
<p>is both chemical and mechanical,</p>
<p>and it can be both for sake of increasing</p>
<p>certain types of behavior,</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re talking mainly about feeding behavior</p>
<p>up until now anyway,</p>
<p>but also ceasing to eat, closing your mouth,</p>
<p>moving away from food, turning away from food,</p>
<p>all behaviors that we&rsquo;re familiar with</p>
<p>anytime we feel kind of sick on the basis of activation</p>
<p>of this mechanosensor for gastric distress.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got chemical signaling and mechanical signaling,</p>
<p>and I also want to emphasize</p>
<p>that we have direct and indirect signaling</p>
<p>from the gut to the brain.</p>
<p>Direct signaling is the kind of signaling</p>
<p>of the sort I&rsquo;ve been talking about mainly up until now,</p>
<p>which is neurons in the gut</p>
<p>communicating with neurons in the brainstem</p>
<p>that communicate with neurons in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>and of course, those are also going to interact</p>
<p>with neurons of the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which is the area of your brain involved in decision-making,</p>
<p>the, you know, I think it was the shrimp that made me sick,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want any more of that,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m never going back to that restaurant again</p>
<p>because after I ate there about an hour later,</p>
<p>I started feeling really not well.</p>
<p>I felt, you know, kind of feverish,</p>
<p>but my gut didn&rsquo;t feel well, my digestion was really off.</p>
<p>All of that kind of information is handled</p>
<p>in the prefrontal cortex at a conscious level,</p>
<p>but the immediate decision to stop eating</p>
<p>or to eat more of something,</p>
<p>to move towards something or away from it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s made by neural circuits that reside at the,</p>
<p>we would say the subconscious level,</p>
<p>but what we really mean</p>
<p>is below the level of the neocortex.</p>
<p>Below the cortex means essentially</p>
<p>below our level of conscious awareness.</p>
<p>So we talked about two types of information within the gut</p>
<p>that are communicated to the brain,</p>
<p>chemical information, meaning information</p>
<p>about the nutrients that happen to be there</p>
<p>and mechanical information,</p>
<p>distention of the gut or lack of distention and so forth.</p>
<p>And we talked about how these neuropod cells</p>
<p>can signal the release of dopamine</p>
<p>in circuits within the brain</p>
<p>to cause you to seek out more of something.</p>
<p>Now, in a very logically consistent way,</p>
<p>dopamine is also involved in the whole business of vomiting.</p>
<p>You might think, well, that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>I thought dopamine was always a good thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in motivation and reward, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it turns out the areopostrema,</p>
<p>this vomit center and the brainstem</p>
<p>is chock-a-block full of dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>And if dopamine levels go too high,</p>
<p>it can actually trigger vomiting.</p>
<p>And this we see in the context of various drugs</p>
<p>that are used to treat things like Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s is a deficiency in dopamine</p>
<p>or a lack of dopamine neurons,</p>
<p>typically that causes a resting tremor,</p>
<p>difficulty in movement,</p>
<p>because dopamine is also associated</p>
<p>with a lot of the neural circuits for movement.</p>
<p>Many drugs that are used to treat Parkinson&rsquo;s like L-DOPA</p>
<p>increase levels of dopamine so much</p>
<p>or at least activate dopamine receptors</p>
<p>to such a great degree in certain areas of the brain</p>
<p>that they can cause activation of things</p>
<p>like the trigger to vomit.</p>
<p>Now, this should also make sense in the natural context</p>
<p>of if you gorge yourself with food,</p>
<p>gorge yourself with food, gorge yourself with food,</p>
<p>the neurons in your gut that respond to that</p>
<p>are simply detecting the presence of nutrients,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t really make decisions themselves.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know to stop eating.</p>
<p>Your brain knows to stop eating or to eject that food.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing</p>
<p>that those neurons are communicating</p>
<p>with areas of the brain,</p>
<p>not just that stimulate consuming more food,</p>
<p>but that are communicating with areas of the brain,</p>
<p>for instance, areopostrema,</p>
<p>that when dopamine levels get too high,</p>
<p>cause us to either stop eating that food</p>
<p>or in the case of vomiting to eject that food.</p>
<p>So I raise this not to give you a kind of a disgusting</p>
<p>counterexample to what we call appetitive behaviors,</p>
<p>the things that we like to do more of,</p>
<p>but simply to give you a sense of just how strongly</p>
<p>even these reflexes that we think of</p>
<p>as feeling sick and vomiting</p>
<p>or the desire to seek out more food</p>
<p>are really being controlled by a kind of push pull system,</p>
<p>by parallel pathways that are arriving from our gut.</p>
<p>And the same neurochemicals in this case,</p>
<p>dopamine are being used</p>
<p>to create two opposite type behaviors,</p>
<p>one behavior to consume more,</p>
<p>one behavior to get rid of everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already consumed.</p>
<p>So our brain is actually sensitive</p>
<p>to the amount of signaling coming from our gut,</p>
<p>not just the path by which that signal arrives.</p>
<p>Our brain is very carefully paying attention</p>
<p>to whether or not the levels of dopamine</p>
<p>that are being triggered are within a normal range</p>
<p>for typical eating behavior</p>
<p>or whether or not we&rsquo;ve gorged ourselves</p>
<p>to the point where enough already.</p>
<p>Now, of course, mechanical signals will also play</p>
<p>into areopostrema and into the vomiting reflex.</p>
<p>If we have a very distended gut, we feel lousy.</p>
<p>It just, it actually can hurt very badly</p>
<p>and we will have the desire to vomit</p>
<p>or we will just simply vomit.</p>
<p>So mechanical and chemical signals</p>
<p>are always arriving in parallel.</p>
<p>They never work in unison.</p>
<p>And so now we have chemical signals, mechanical signals.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;d like to talk about direct and indirect signals</p>
<p>because almost everything I&rsquo;ve talked about up until now</p>
<p>are direct signals, a neural pathway</p>
<p>that converges in the brain</p>
<p>to create a particular feeling, thought, or behavior,</p>
<p>but there are also indirect pathways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what takes us back to the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and to these little microbiota.</p>
<p>And to just give you the takeaway message at the front here,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll give you a little more detail</p>
<p>as to how it comes about.</p>
<p>You have neurotransmitters in your brain</p>
<p>and in your spinal cord and in your eyes</p>
<p>and in your peripheral nervous system.</p>
<p>They cause the activation or the suppression</p>
<p>of nerve activity, meaning they either</p>
<p>electrically activate other nerve cells</p>
<p>or they cause other nerve cells</p>
<p>to be less electrically active.</p>
<p>And they do that by way of neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, the gut microbiota</p>
<p>are capable of influencing metabolic events.</p>
<p>And in some cases are capable</p>
<p>of synthesizing neurotransmitters themselves.</p>
<p>So what that means is that these little bugs,</p>
<p>these little microbiota that are cargo in your gut,</p>
<p>the six pounds of cargo,</p>
<p>they actually can make neurochemicals</p>
<p>that can pass into the bloodstream and into your brain</p>
<p>and actually impact the other cells</p>
<p>of your body and brain indirectly.</p>
<p>So without involving these very intricate nerve pathways</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>In other words, the foods you eat,</p>
<p>the environment of your gut microbiome</p>
<p>can actually create the chemical substrates</p>
<p>that allow your brain to feel one way or the other,</p>
<p>to feel great or to feel lousy,</p>
<p>to seek out more of a particular type of behavior</p>
<p>or to avoid that behavior.</p>
<p>And that would constitute indirect signaling.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about the structure</p>
<p>and function of the gut to brain pathway,</p>
<p>focusing mainly on feeding behaviors</p>
<p>and in some cases avoiding feeding</p>
<p>or even ejecting food from the digestive tract.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to drill a little bit deeper</p>
<p>into this indirect signaling pathway</p>
<p>from the gut to the brain,</p>
<p>because it bridges us nicely from neuronal signals</p>
<p>in the gut to the brain,</p>
<p>hormonal signals from the gut to the brain,</p>
<p>to what also includes the microbiome,</p>
<p>which is what we started talking about</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago,</p>
<p>certain gut microbiota can actually synthesize</p>
<p>certain neurotransmitters that can go impact the brain.</p>
<p>And we actually have some knowledge</p>
<p>about which microbiota can synthesize</p>
<p>particular neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>For instance, the neuromodulator dopamine</p>
<p>can be synthesized by or from bacillus and ceratia.</p>
<p>Now, these are just names of microbiota.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect that any of you</p>
<p>would necessarily recognize them.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t the sorts of things</p>
<p>that you necessarily would have run out and buy</p>
<p>to get more dopamine.</p>
<p>But the point is that particular gut microbiota</p>
<p>can create dopamine in our gut</p>
<p>that can get into our bloodstream</p>
<p>and can generally change our baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>within the brain and other areas of the body.</p>
<p>I mentioned baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>because as I talked about on an episode all about dopamine,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just repeat the basics here now,</p>
<p>we have baseline levels of neurotransmitters</p>
<p>or neuromodulators that act as sort of</p>
<p>the level of the tide, the overall level,</p>
<p>and then we can have peaks of dopamine</p>
<p>that are created by behaviors</p>
<p>or by ingestion of particular foods or drugs, et cetera.</p>
<p>So bacillus and ceratia tend to increase</p>
<p>our baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>So if it turns out that we are creating</p>
<p>the right gut microbiome environment</p>
<p>that these particular gut microbiota can thrive in,</p>
<p>well, then our baseline levels of dopamine will be elevated.</p>
<p>And in general, that leads to enhancement of mood.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are other gut microbiota,</p>
<p>for instance, candida, streptococcus, various enterococcus.</p>
<p>These always have these kind of strange</p>
<p>and not so attractive names,</p>
<p>at least to me as a neurobiologist.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, those particular microbiota</p>
<p>support the production of,</p>
<p>or can even be metabolized into serotonin,</p>
<p>which is a neuromodulator associated with mood,</p>
<p>with social interactions,</p>
<p>with a huge number of different</p>
<p>types of events and behaviors.</p>
<p>Again, these gut microbiota, when present</p>
<p>and allowed to thrive in our gut,</p>
<p>will increase our overall levels of serotonin.</p>
<p>And riding on top of that level of serotonin</p>
<p>will be the serotonin that&rsquo;s specifically released</p>
<p>in response to certain behaviors.</p>
<p>And I really want to drive home this point</p>
<p>of baselines and peaks.</p>
<p>The baseline level of serotonin might set our overall mood,</p>
<p>whether or not we wake up feeling pretty good</p>
<p>or really lousy if our serotonin levels</p>
<p>happen to be very, very low.</p>
<p>Whether or not we tend to be in a kind of a calm space</p>
<p>or whether or not we tend to be somewhat irritable.</p>
<p>But then of course, individual events</p>
<p>as we go about our day,</p>
<p>maybe a compliment that we get,</p>
<p>or maybe somebody says something irritating to us,</p>
<p>whatever it may be,</p>
<p>will also influence levels of serotonin.</p>
<p>But those serotonin events are going to be related to events</p>
<p>at particular neural circuits in the brain.</p>
<p>And this is an important topic</p>
<p>because I think that a lot of people hear quite accurately,</p>
<p>oh, 90 to 95% of our serotonin is manufactured in the gut.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s manufactured from the sorts of microbiota</p>
<p>that I just described.</p>
<p>And there are many, many experiments now,</p>
<p>mostly in animal models,</p>
<p>but also some in humans that show</p>
<p>that if the gut microbiome is deficient in some way</p>
<p>to these particular bacteria,</p>
<p>that serotonin levels drop and people&rsquo;s mood suffers,</p>
<p>maybe even their immune system functions,</p>
<p>maybe even exacerbates certain psychiatric illnesses.</p>
<p>However, a lot of people take that to mean</p>
<p>that the serotonin of the brain all comes from the gut</p>
<p>or mostly comes from the gut.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still the case that you have neurons in the brain</p>
<p>that are responsible for releasing serotonin directly</p>
<p>in response to certain things like social touch</p>
<p>or through other types of positive social experiences.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got gut microbiota</p>
<p>that can literally be turned into dopamine</p>
<p>and raise our baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got gut microbiota that can literally</p>
<p>raise our baseline levels of serotonin.</p>
<p>And indeed there are other gut microbiota</p>
<p>like lactobacillus or bifidobacterium, excuse me,</p>
<p>hard complex names to pronounce.</p>
<p>Bifidobacterium that can give rise to increases</p>
<p>in GABA levels, this inhibitory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>that can act as a little bit of a mild sedative,</p>
<p>can reduce irritability, et cetera.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just the baseline,</p>
<p>the kind of tide of those neuromodulators.</p>
<p>Again, I want to emphasize that we still have neural circuits</p>
<p>within the brain and body that are specifically releasing</p>
<p>in a very potent way, dopamine, serotonin, and GABA.</p>
<p>So the two things act in concert.</p>
<p>Even though the gut and the brain are acting</p>
<p>both in parallel and directly influencing one another,</p>
<p>it is a powerful synergistic effect.</p>
<p>And there are now hundreds of studies,</p>
<p>maybe even thousands by this point,</p>
<p>mostly performed in animal models, typically mice,</p>
<p>but also some studies in humans that show</p>
<p>that creating the correct environment</p>
<p>for these gut microbiota to thrive</p>
<p>really does enhance mood and wellbeing.</p>
<p>And that when our gut microbiome is not healthy,</p>
<p>that it really can deplete our mood and sense of wellbeing.</p>
<p>Now, there are two major phases</p>
<p>to creating a healthy gut microbiome.</p>
<p>One you can control,</p>
<p>and the other one is less under your control.</p>
<p>I get into this in a lot of detail</p>
<p>in the episode with Dr. Sonnenberg,</p>
<p>which is coming out immediately after this one,</p>
<p>the following Monday, that is.</p>
<p>But for now, I want to just capture a few of the main points</p>
<p>about the early establishment of the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>It turns out that the environment that we are exposed to,</p>
<p>the things that come into contact with our skin</p>
<p>and digestive tract and any other mucosal lining,</p>
<p>even the urethra, the nasal passages,</p>
<p>any opening to the outside world</p>
<p>that brings in certain, excuse me,</p>
<p>certain microbiota in the first three years of life</p>
<p>is going to have a profound impact</p>
<p>on the overall menu of microbiota</p>
<p>that we will be able to carry within our body.</p>
<p>And it really does seem that getting exposure to</p>
<p>and building a diverse microbiome</p>
<p>in those first three years is critical.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of speculation and some data</p>
<p>as to cesarean delivered babies</p>
<p>having less diverse microbiomes</p>
<p>compared to vaginally delivered babies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been attempts, although not conclusive attempts,</p>
<p>to link that to the presence of autism spectrum disorders,</p>
<p>which at least by some statistics</p>
<p>seem to be of higher probability in cesarean deliveries,</p>
<p>although there are other studies that refute that,</p>
<p>and I want to make that clear.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s clear that babies do not get much,</p>
<p>if any, exposure to microbiota inside of the womb,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit, but not much,</p>
<p>but it is during the birth process</p>
<p>and in the days and weeks immediately after</p>
<p>they arrive in the world</p>
<p>that their gut microbiome is established,</p>
<p>that those gut microbiota take residence within the gut.</p>
<p>So it will depend on whether or not</p>
<p>they were breastfed or bottle-fed.</p>
<p>It will depend on whether or not</p>
<p>they were exposed to a household pet or not,</p>
<p>whether or not they were held by multiple caregivers</p>
<p>or just by one, whether or not they were a preemie baby</p>
<p>and were contained in a particularly restrictive environment</p>
<p>in order to encourage their further development</p>
<p>before they could be brought home or not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give the picture</p>
<p>that if you were isolated or you were delivered by C-section</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re somehow doomed to have a poor microbiome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>However, it is the case that the more diversity</p>
<p>of microbiota that one can create early in life</p>
<p>is really helpful for long-term outcomes</p>
<p>in terms of brain to gut signaling, gut to brain signaling,</p>
<p>and for sake of the immune system.</p>
<p>There are some decent studies showing that</p>
<p>if children are exposed to a lot of antibiotic treatment</p>
<p>early in life, that can be very detrimental</p>
<p>to establishment of a healthy gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And fortunately, that reestablishing</p>
<p>a healthy gut microbiome can help rescue</p>
<p>some of those deficits.</p>
<p>So doctors nowadays are much more cautious</p>
<p>about the prescription of antibiotic drugs</p>
<p>to children in their early years,</p>
<p>not just up to three years, but extending out to,</p>
<p>you know, five and seven and 10 years.</p>
<p>And even in adults, they&rsquo;re very, very careful about that</p>
<p>or they ought to be.</p>
<p>One reason is the existence or I would say the proliferation</p>
<p>of antibiotic resistant bacteria</p>
<p>that are becoming more common in hospitals and elsewhere,</p>
<p>and that can cause serious problems.</p>
<p>But in addition to that, because of this understanding</p>
<p>that the gut microbiome is influencing</p>
<p>and actually creating neurotransmitters</p>
<p>that can impact mood and mental health,</p>
<p>impact immune health, and so on.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds,</p>
<p>if not thousands of studies,</p>
<p>emphasizing the key role of the microbiome</p>
<p>on brain health, psychiatric health, et cetera.</p>
<p>I want to just highlight a few of those studies.</p>
<p>And in particular, some recent studies that come from labs</p>
<p>that have been working on this sort of thing</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>One of the more exciting studies comes from the work</p>
<p>of Mauro Costa Mattioli&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>which is at Baylor College of Medicine.</p>
<p>Mauro&rsquo;s lab has been working on mouse models</p>
<p>of autism spectrum disorder for a long time</p>
<p>and looking at social behavior using a mouse model</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been able to identify particular types</p>
<p>of microbiota that when they take resonance in the gut</p>
<p>can help offset some of the symptoms of autism,</p>
<p>at least the symptoms of autism</p>
<p>that exist in these mouse models.</p>
<p>Okay, so again, this is not human work.</p>
<p>This is work being done on mouse models</p>
<p>for the simple reason that you can do these kinds</p>
<p>of manipulations where basically they took mice</p>
<p>that were in germ-free environments</p>
<p>or non-germ-free environments,</p>
<p>or they exposed mice to particular microbiota</p>
<p>and not other microbiota.</p>
<p>And they discovered that a particular microbiota</p>
<p>called L. ruteri, it&rsquo;s L period, R-E-U-T-E-R-I.</p>
<p>Treatment with L. ruteri corrects the social deficits</p>
<p>present in these autism models.</p>
<p>And it does so by way of activating our old friend,</p>
<p>the vagus nerve, but not simply because the vagus nerve</p>
<p>triggers the release of dopamine,</p>
<p>but it turns out that this particular gut microbiota,</p>
<p>L. ruteri, can correct the social deficits</p>
<p>in this autism spectrum disorder model.</p>
<p>It does that by way of a vagal nerve pathway</p>
<p>that stimulates both dopamine release and oxytocin release.</p>
<p>And they established this really mechanistically</p>
<p>by showing, for instance,</p>
<p>if you get rid of the oxytocin receptor,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see this rescue.</p>
<p>Now those are mouse models,</p>
<p>so we have to take those with the appropriate grain of salt,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re really exciting.</p>
<p>And they come to us in parallel with other studies</p>
<p>that are being done, taking the microbiomes of people</p>
<p>who have one condition or lack of condition</p>
<p>and putting it into people who have one condition</p>
<p>or another condition.</p>
<p>Let me explain what I mean by that.</p>
<p>The early discovery of the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and its potential to impact health</p>
<p>was not in the context of the gut to brain pathway,</p>
<p>but rather it was in the context of colitis.</p>
<p>This dates back to studies in the 50s,</p>
<p>whereby people with very severe intractable colitis</p>
<p>for which no other treatment was going to work</p>
<p>received fecal transplants.</p>
<p>So yes, that&rsquo;s exactly as it sounds.</p>
<p>Taking the stool of healthy people</p>
<p>who do not have colitis,</p>
<p>transplanting those stools into the lower digestive tract</p>
<p>of people who do have colitis,</p>
<p>and they saw a significant improvement</p>
<p>if not rescue of the colitis.</p>
<p>That was one of the first indications</p>
<p>that something within stool of all things</p>
<p>could actually rescue another individual from disease,</p>
<p>which sounds kind of wild and crazy</p>
<p>and may even sound disgusting to some of you.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>almost 60% of stool is live or dead bacteria, microbiota.</p>
<p>And it really opened up this entire field</p>
<p>of exploring how different microbiota</p>
<p>might have therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>And indeed that has been shown to be the case</p>
<p>also in fecal transplants for certain psychiatric illnesses.</p>
<p>These are still ongoing studies.</p>
<p>They vary in quality.</p>
<p>These are hard studies to do for all sorts of reasons,</p>
<p>getting the appropriate patient populations,</p>
<p>getting agreement, et cetera,</p>
<p>making sure that everything&rsquo;s handled properly.</p>
<p>But what this involves is fecal transplants</p>
<p>from individuals that lack a particular</p>
<p>psychiatric condition or metabolic condition</p>
<p>into people who have a particular metabolic condition.</p>
<p>And there has been tremendous success in some cases.</p>
<p>One of the more powerful and salient examples</p>
<p>is for obesity.</p>
<p>There are some people for which,</p>
<p>even if they ingest very low numbers of calories,</p>
<p>even if they go on a liquid protein diet,</p>
<p>simply can&rsquo;t lose weight.</p>
<p>These are somewhat rare disorders,</p>
<p>but these are people that would either do,</p>
<p>get gastric bypass surgery.</p>
<p>Some people are now getting these fecal transplants</p>
<p>from people that have healthy weight</p>
<p>and they take the stool from them.</p>
<p>They put it into lower digestive tract</p>
<p>and they can see substantial improvement in weight loss</p>
<p>in people that were otherwise unable to do that.</p>
<p>In some cases, actually,</p>
<p>they can start eating relatively normal levels of food</p>
<p>and still lose weight.</p>
<p>So pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>And that tells us there&rsquo;s something in these microbiota</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>Now, how those effects are generated isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>One idea is that it&rsquo;s impacting the metabolome,</p>
<p>components of the metabolism.</p>
<p>Almost certainly, that&rsquo;s going to be the case.</p>
<p>Another idea is that it&rsquo;s impacting neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>which change behavior and food choices within the brain.</p>
<p>Although, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>some of these people are already eating</p>
<p>very little food to begin with.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little bit harder of an argument to create.</p>
<p>There are also some somewhat famous examples now</p>
<p>of how fecal transplants can lead to negative outcomes.</p>
<p>But those negative outcomes further underscore</p>
<p>the power of the microbiome in impacting bodily health.</p>
<p>One key example of this, for instance,</p>
<p>is transfer of fecal matter into another person</p>
<p>in order to treat something like colitis.</p>
<p>And it effectively does that.</p>
<p>But if the donor of the stool of the fecal matter</p>
<p>happened to be obese or have some other metabolic syndrome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been observed that the recipient</p>
<p>can also develop that metabolic syndrome</p>
<p>simply by way of receiving</p>
<p>that donor&rsquo;s particular microbiota.</p>
<p>So these microbiota can create positive outcomes</p>
<p>or they can create negative outcomes.</p>
<p>Now, most of us, of course, are not interested in</p>
<p>or pursuing fecal transplants.</p>
<p>Most people are interested</p>
<p>in just creating a healthy gut microbiome environment</p>
<p>for sake of immune system and brain function.</p>
<p>And we will talk about how to do that</p>
<p>in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>But I just want to further underscore</p>
<p>the power of the microbiota in shaping brain chemistry</p>
<p>and in shaping things like mood</p>
<p>or other aspects of mental health</p>
<p>that typically we don&rsquo;t associate with our gut.</p>
<p>There are several studies published in recent years.</p>
<p>One that I&rsquo;ll just highlight now, first author,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Tanya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Association of Loneliness and Wisdom</p>
<p>with Gut Microbial Diversity and Composition,</p>
<p>an exploratory study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting study,</p>
<p>looked at 184 community dwelling adults, excuse me,</p>
<p>ranging from 28 to 97 years old.</p>
<p>They explored whether or not</p>
<p>having enhanced microbial diversity</p>
<p>somehow related to these variables</p>
<p>that they refer to as loneliness and wisdom.</p>
<p>They used a number of different tests to evaluate those.</p>
<p>Those are common tests in the psychology literature,</p>
<p>not so much in the biology literature,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, there are ways of measuring</p>
<p>things like loneliness and wisdom.</p>
<p>Wisdom, in this case, being the opposite of loneliness,</p>
<p>at least in the context of this study.</p>
<p>And what they found was the more microbial diversity,</p>
<p>the more diverse one&rsquo;s microbiome was,</p>
<p>the lower incidence of loneliness.</p>
<p>And they did this by taking fecal samples,</p>
<p>profiling them for RNA,</p>
<p>so essentially doing gene sequencing of the stool</p>
<p>of these individuals,</p>
<p>getting ratings of how lonely or not lonely they felt</p>
<p>and correlating those.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just but one study.</p>
<p>I pointed out because it&rsquo;s particularly recent</p>
<p>and it looked like it was particularly well done.</p>
<p>There is another study that I&rsquo;ll just refer you to.</p>
<p>This was a study published in 2020 in Scientific Reports.</p>
<p>The title of the study is</p>
<p>Emotional Wellbeing and Gut Microbiome Profiles</p>
<p>by Enterotype.</p>
<p>What I particularly like about this study</p>
<p>is that they were able to correlate the presence</p>
<p>of certain microbiota</p>
<p>with feelings of subjective wellbeing</p>
<p>and lack of or presence of depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>They did high throughput gene sequencing</p>
<p>of the microbiomes of individuals.</p>
<p>So that meant measuring the microbiota,</p>
<p>figuring out which microbiota were present,</p>
<p>how diverse their microbiome was in general.</p>
<p>Gut microbiome diversity is a good thing.</p>
<p>And then to correlate that with what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the PANAS score.</p>
<p>PANAS stands for positive affect, negative affect schedule.</p>
<p>This is a test that my lab has used extensively</p>
<p>that other labs use to evaluate mood and wellbeing.</p>
<p>And they defined what were called three enterotypes,</p>
<p>three different categories of people</p>
<p>that ate very different diets</p>
<p>that tended to fall into categories</p>
<p>of having more or fewer emotional symptoms</p>
<p>that were negative or more or fewer emotional symptoms</p>
<p>that were positive,</p>
<p>and whether or not they tend to be more depressed, anxious,</p>
<p>or have more stress-related behaviors, et cetera.</p>
<p>And what they were able to derive from this study</p>
<p>was some strong indications</p>
<p>about what types of things we should ingest in our diet,</p>
<p>maybe even certain things that we should avoid,</p>
<p>but certainly the types of things that we should ingest</p>
<p>that can enhance mood and wellbeing</p>
<p>and can tend to shift people away</p>
<p>from more depressive-like anxiety</p>
<p>and stress-related symptoms.</p>
<p>Before we get into what the particular food items were</p>
<p>that lend themselves to a healthy microbiome,</p>
<p>I want to raise a bigger</p>
<p>and perhaps more important issue,</p>
<p>which is what is a healthy microbiome?</p>
<p>I think if you asked any number of world experts,</p>
<p>and I certainly asked this of Dr. Sonnenberg,</p>
<p>what is a healthy microbiome?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all going to tell you it&rsquo;s a microbiome</p>
<p>that has a lot of diversity,</p>
<p>that includes a lot of different types of bacteria.</p>
<p>And that makes sense</p>
<p>because it logically would include the bacteria</p>
<p>that produce GABA and dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>and that support the immune system</p>
<p>and do a number of different things.</p>
<p>But is it simply the case</p>
<p>that adding microbiota diversity is always a good thing?</p>
<p>Well, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Probiotics and prebiotics,</p>
<p>both of which can enhance microbiota diversity,</p>
<p>can improve mood digestion, immune system, and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been established,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mainly been established</p>
<p>in the context of post-antibiotic treatment</p>
<p>or people that are recovering from illness</p>
<p>or people that have been very stressed</p>
<p>or have been dealing with all sorts of challenges,</p>
<p>mental or physical,</p>
<p>and they are an attempt to replenish the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s also clear</p>
<p>that excessive microbiota brought about</p>
<p>by excessive intake of probiotics</p>
<p>can lead to things like brain fog.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually some good studies</p>
<p>that point to the fact that certain metabolites</p>
<p>of the microbiome,</p>
<p>certain chemicals produced in the gut and in the body</p>
<p>can actually lead to brain fog states.</p>
<p>This is thought to come about</p>
<p>through the lactate pathways of the gut</p>
<p>that can then impact the brain.</p>
<p>If you want to look more into this issue</p>
<p>of whether or not probiotics taken in excess, perhaps,</p>
<p>can lead to brain fog,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d encourage you to look at a particular paper.</p>
<p>This is a paper published</p>
<p>in Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology,</p>
<p>and the title of the paper</p>
<p>is Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating,</p>
<p>A Link Between SIBO, Probiotics, and Metabolic Acidosis.</p>
<p>It was published in 2018.</p>
<p>We can provide a link to this study.</p>
<p>And there are several other studies in the references</p>
<p>that point to the fact that, in some cases,</p>
<p>excessive intake of probiotics</p>
<p>and excessive proliferation of gut microbiota</p>
<p>can actually be problematic.</p>
<p>I mention this not to confuse you,</p>
<p>but because it is confusing out there.</p>
<p>We all would think that just increasing microbiota diversity</p>
<p>is always a good thing,</p>
<p>but there are thresholds beyond</p>
<p>which excessive microbiota diversity might be problematic.</p>
<p>I think everyone agrees</p>
<p>that having too few microbial species living in us</p>
<p>is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Now, none of that answers the questions</p>
<p>that I think everyone really wants answers to,</p>
<p>which are, what should we do,</p>
<p>what should we not do to improve our gut microbiome?</p>
<p>I mean, clearly, we can&rsquo;t time travel back</p>
<p>to when we were zero to three years old</p>
<p>and get a dog if we didn&rsquo;t have a dog,</p>
<p>get breastfed if we weren&rsquo;t breastfed,</p>
<p>be delivered vaginally as opposed to by C-section</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t have that opportunity.</p>
<p>We just can&rsquo;t time travel and do that.</p>
<p>All of us, however, should be seeking</p>
<p>to improve the conditions of our gut microbiome</p>
<p>because of the critical ways</p>
<p>in which it impacts the rest of our brain and bodily health.</p>
<p>So what should we do?</p>
<p>What shouldn&rsquo;t we do?</p>
<p>Clearly, we know that stress</p>
<p>can negatively impact the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>However, some forms of stress</p>
<p>that can quote unquote negatively impact the microbiome</p>
<p>include fasting, long periods of fast,</p>
<p>which makes sense because a lot of microbiota need food</p>
<p>in order to thrive.</p>
<p>In fact, many, if not all of them do at some point.</p>
<p>There are other questions such as,</p>
<p>should we eat particular foods</p>
<p>and how often should we eat those foods?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been told that fiber is incredibly important</p>
<p>because of the presence of prebiotic fiber,</p>
<p>which can essentially feed the microbiome,</p>
<p>but is fiber really necessary</p>
<p>and how necessary is it to encourage</p>
<p>a healthy microbiome?</p>
<p>Clearly, there are a number of people</p>
<p>following relatively low fiber diets,</p>
<p>such as ketogenic diets,</p>
<p>and those can have, in some cases,</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory effects</p>
<p>and can sometimes also improve certain microbiota species.</p>
<p>So it can all be rather confusing.</p>
<p>And for that matter, I asked our resident expert,</p>
<p>Dr. Justin Sonnenberg at Stanford, all of these questions,</p>
<p>and he answers them very systematically</p>
<p>in the episode that comes out after this one.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to withhold anything from you,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll just give a very top contour version</p>
<p>of those answers,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll get more in-depth answers</p>
<p>during that episode.</p>
<p>I asked about fasting.</p>
<p>And the reason I asked about fasting</p>
<p>is that years ago, I was at a meeting</p>
<p>as part of the Pew Biomedical Scholars meeting,</p>
<p>and one of the other Pew Biomedical Scholars</p>
<p>was an expert in gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And I said, hey, are probiotics good for the microbiome?</p>
<p>And if so, which one should I take?</p>
<p>And his answer was very interesting.</p>
<p>He said, you know, in certain cases they can be,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re traveling or you&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>but it turns out that the particular bacteria</p>
<p>that they put in most probiotics</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually replenish the microbiota that you need most.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh, well, why don&rsquo;t they make ones</p>
<p>that replenish the microbiota that you need most?</p>
<p>And his answer was, well, they don&rsquo;t replenish those,</p>
<p>but they replenish other ones</p>
<p>that then in turn encourage the development</p>
<p>of the microbiota that you do want</p>
<p>once you start eating the appropriate foods.</p>
<p>So they change the environment,</p>
<p>which makes the environment better,</p>
<p>which indirectly supports the proliferation</p>
<p>of quote-unquote good microbiota.</p>
<p>Okay, so that was a somewhat convoluted answer,</p>
<p>but I did appreciate his answer.</p>
<p>Then I asked him about fasting.</p>
<p>I said, well, a lot of people are getting interested</p>
<p>in intermittent fasting now.</p>
<p>People are spending a significant portion</p>
<p>of each 24-hour cycle avoiding food</p>
<p>for sake of time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>What does that do to the gut microbiome?</p>
<p>Does it make it healthier or does it make it unhealthier?</p>
<p>Well, my colleague from Yale and Dr. Sonnenberg</p>
<p>both confirmed that during periods of fasting,</p>
<p>especially prolonged periods of fasting,</p>
<p>we actually start to digest away</p>
<p>much of our digestive tract.</p>
<p>Now, the whole thing doesn&rsquo;t start to disappear,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s thinning of the mucosal lining</p>
<p>or at least disruption of the mucosal lining.</p>
<p>A lot of the microbiota species can start to die off.</p>
<p>And so it was surprising to me,</p>
<p>but nonetheless interesting that fasting</p>
<p>may actually cause a disruption</p>
<p>to certain healthy elements of the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>But again, there&rsquo;s a caveat.</p>
<p>The caveat is that when people eat after a period of fast,</p>
<p>there may be a compensatory proliferation,</p>
<p>meaning an increase in healthy gut microbiota.</p>
<p>So you start to get the picture</p>
<p>that fasting is neither good nor bad.</p>
<p>You start to get the picture that particular diets,</p>
<p>meaning certain restriction diets</p>
<p>or macronutrient-rich diets</p>
<p>may not be good or bad for the microbiome.</p>
<p>And yet there are some answers that arrived to us</p>
<p>from Dr. Sonnenberg, but from other experts in the field,</p>
<p>that there are certain foods</p>
<p>and certain things that we can ingest</p>
<p>which definitely enhance the microbiome</p>
<p>and make it healthier than it would be</p>
<p>were we to not ingest those foods.</p>
<p>So next I&rsquo;d like to talk about</p>
<p>what I think is a really pioneering</p>
<p>and important study in this area.</p>
<p>This is a study that was carried out by the Sonnenberg lab</p>
<p>in collaboration with Chris Gardner&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>also at Stanford,</p>
<p>where they compared two general types of diets in humans,</p>
<p>diets that were fiber-rich,</p>
<p>which has been proposed time and time again</p>
<p>to enhance microbiota diversity</p>
<p>and to enhance gut-brain signaling even</p>
<p>and to enhance the immune system, perhaps,</p>
<p>and diets that were enriched</p>
<p>in so-called low-sugar fermented foods.</p>
<p>Before I dive into that study</p>
<p>and what the conclusions were,</p>
<p>because they are very interesting</p>
<p>and very actionable for all of us,</p>
<p>I do want to touch on probiotics</p>
<p>because I want to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>It is not the case that ingestion of probiotics</p>
<p>will always lead to brain fog.</p>
<p>I want to make that clear.</p>
<p>It is the case that ingestion of probiotics,</p>
<p>even if those probiotics don&rsquo;t directly contain</p>
<p>the microbiota species that one is trying to proliferate,</p>
<p>can be useful for improving microbiota diversity.</p>
<p>In general, it seems that maintaining</p>
<p>a healthy gut microbiome involves ingesting</p>
<p>certain types of foods,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about those in a moment,</p>
<p>but perhaps also augmenting the microbiota system</p>
<p>through prebiotics or probiotics</p>
<p>at a fairly low level on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>So these are not high-dose probiotics,</p>
<p>except under conditions of dysbiosis,</p>
<p>where, for instance,</p>
<p>if somebody has done a round of antibiotics</p>
<p>and they need to replenish their gut microbiome,</p>
<p>there are foods and there are pill form</p>
<p>and powder form prebiotics and probiotics</p>
<p>that can be very useful.</p>
<p>Or in cases where people have been very stressed</p>
<p>or are undergoing excessive travel</p>
<p>or have shifted their diet radically,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s due to travel,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s due to illness,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s due to stress,</p>
<p>but when there are a number of different converging events</p>
<p>that are stressing or depleting microbiota diversity,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when, at least I believe,</p>
<p>it can be useful to support the gut microbiome</p>
<p>through the ingestion of quality probiotics or prebiotics.</p>
<p>So it would be under conditions</p>
<p>where people are stressed</p>
<p>or their system is generally stressed</p>
<p>for environmental or illness-related reasons</p>
<p>that it might be useful to lean towards higher doses</p>
<p>of prebiotics or probiotics than one might normally use,</p>
<p>but that under normal conditions</p>
<p>that one would focus on quality nutrients</p>
<p>through diet and focus on ingestion of probiotics</p>
<p>at a fairly low to moderate level</p>
<p>and or prebiotics at a fairly low to moderate level.</p>
<p>That just seems like the logical approach</p>
<p>based on the experts that I&rsquo;ve spoken to,</p>
<p>but certainly if your doctor prescribes</p>
<p>or suggests that you take high levels of probiotics</p>
<p>for any reason,</p>
<p>you should definitely pay attention to your physician</p>
<p>and you should obviously pay attention to your physician</p>
<p>in any case, you should never add or remove anything</p>
<p>from your nutritional plan or supplementation plan</p>
<p>without consulting a physician.</p>
<p>So what should we do in order to maximize the health</p>
<p>of our gut brain axis as it&rsquo;s called?</p>
<p>How should we support the diversity of the good microbiota</p>
<p>that help us create all these neurotransmitters</p>
<p>that we want, improve our immune system function</p>
<p>and so on and so forth?</p>
<p>Well, some of that is going to be through the basics.</p>
<p>When I say the basics,</p>
<p>I mean the foundational things</p>
<p>that really set us up for overall health.</p>
<p>So this is going to be getting deep sleep</p>
<p>of sufficient duration, 80 plus percent of the time.</p>
<p>I mean, if you could get a hundred percent of the time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be great, but very few people accomplish that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be proper hydration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be proper social interactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be proper nutrition.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk more about nutrition in a moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be limiting excessive prolonged stressors</p>
<p>or stress.</p>
<p>And indeed we&rsquo;ve done episodes</p>
<p>about just about all of those things,</p>
<p>but certainly about stress.</p>
<p>We have an episode of the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>that you can find at hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>all about mastering stress,</p>
<p>how to avoid long periods of intense stress,</p>
<p>what to do to offset those.</p>
<p>Given that stress can disrupt the microbiome,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re fasting or not,</p>
<p>those tools ought to be useful.</p>
<p>Now, in what I consider to be a landmark study</p>
<p>exploring the relationship between the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>food intake and overall health</p>
<p>is this paper from Justin Sonnenberg&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>and Chris Gardner&rsquo;s lab, both of which are at Stanford.</p>
<p>And the paper entitled</p>
<p>Gut Microbiota-Targeted Diets Modulate Human Immune Status</p>
<p>was published in the journal Cell,</p>
<p>which is among the three top journals,</p>
<p>perhaps in the world, Nature Science and Cell,</p>
<p>really being the apex journals for overall science</p>
<p>and especially for biomedical sciences.</p>
<p>Now, this is a very interesting study.</p>
<p>It was done on humans.</p>
<p>There were two major groups.</p>
<p>One group of humans was instructed</p>
<p>to increase the amount of fiber in their diet.</p>
<p>And in fact, ate a high fiber diet.</p>
<p>The other group was instructed</p>
<p>to eat a high fermented food diet.</p>
<p>Now, both groups started off</p>
<p>not having eaten a lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods,</p>
<p>and were told to increase the amount of either fiber</p>
<p>or fermented foods that they were ingesting</p>
<p>over a four-week ramp up period.</p>
<p>And that was to avoid any major gastric distress.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you&rsquo;re not already accustomed</p>
<p>to eating a lot of fiber,</p>
<p>increasing your amount of fiber dramatically</p>
<p>can cause some gastric distress.</p>
<p>But if you ease into it over time, as we&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a mechanism behind this,</p>
<p>which was unveiled in this study.</p>
<p>But if you ease into it over time,</p>
<p>then the system can tolerate it.</p>
<p>Likewise, high fermented foods can be readily tolerated</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a ramp up phase of ingesting</p>
<p>maybe one serving a day, then maybe two servings,</p>
<p>and ramping up, in this case,</p>
<p>as high as six servings per day.</p>
<p>However, after this ramp up period,</p>
<p>the group assigned to the high fiber condition</p>
<p>maintained high fiber intake for six weeks,</p>
<p>and the high fermented food group</p>
<p>maintained high fermented food intake for six weeks,</p>
<p>after which they went off either the high fiber</p>
<p>or the high fermented food diet,</p>
<p>and there was a four-week follow-up period</p>
<p>during which they gradually returned to baseline.</p>
<p>Throughout the study, their gut microbiome</p>
<p>was evaluated for the diversity of gut microbiota,</p>
<p>and there were also a number of measures</p>
<p>of immune system function,</p>
<p>in particular, measures of the so-called inflammatome.</p>
<p>The immune system has a lot of different molecules involved.</p>
<p>I did a whole episode about the immune system.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning</p>
<p>what some of those molecules are,</p>
<p>various cytokines and signaling molecules</p>
<p>that reflect either high inflammation states</p>
<p>or reduced inflammation states in the brain and body,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome to check out that episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>Regardless, in this study,</p>
<p>they explored the sorts of immune markers</p>
<p>that were expressed in either of the two groups</p>
<p>and compared those.</p>
<p>The basic takeaway of this paper</p>
<p>was that contrary to what they predicted,</p>
<p>the high fiber diet did not lead</p>
<p>to increased microbiota diversity,</p>
<p>at least not in all cases,</p>
<p>and that was somewhat surprising.</p>
<p>The idea is that prebiotic fiber</p>
<p>and a lot of the material in fruits and vegetables</p>
<p>and grains and so forth</p>
<p>are supposed to support microbiota diversity</p>
<p>and the proliferation of existing microbiota,</p>
<p>and that is not what they observed,</p>
<p>although I want to be very clear in pointing out</p>
<p>that the results did not indicate</p>
<p>that fiber is not useful for health overall,</p>
<p>but it does point to the fact</p>
<p>that increasing fiber intake</p>
<p>did not increase microbiota diversity,</p>
<p>which in general, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>is associated with improvements in microbiota function,</p>
<p>health, and overall wellbeing.</p>
<p>Now, the high fermented food diet condition</p>
<p>was very interesting.</p>
<p>It resulted in increased microbiome diversity</p>
<p>and decreased inflammatory signals and activity.</p>
<p>So there was a twofer.</p>
<p>Basically, by ingesting high fermented foods</p>
<p>in fair abundance, right,</p>
<p>you know, four to six servings or more per day</p>
<p>is a lot of fermented food intake.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about what some of those foods were,</p>
<p>but the outcome was very positive.</p>
<p>There was a clear increase in microbiome diversity</p>
<p>and decreased inflammatory signals.</p>
<p>So things like interleukin-6,</p>
<p>a number of other interleukins and cytokines</p>
<p>that are associated with increased inflammation</p>
<p>in the brain and body were reduced significantly.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about this notion</p>
<p>of number of servings, et cetera.</p>
<p>One somewhat minor point of the study,</p>
<p>but I think is useful in terms of</p>
<p>taking an actionable stance with this,</p>
<p>is that the number of servings of fermented foods</p>
<p>was not as strong a predictor of improvements</p>
<p>in the inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation,</p>
<p>and improvements in microbiota diversity,</p>
<p>as was the duration of time</p>
<p>that the individuals were ingesting fermented foods.</p>
<p>In other words, the longer that one</p>
<p>is consistently ingesting fermented foods on a daily basis,</p>
<p>the better the outcomes in terms of the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and for reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s an important point.</p>
<p>And I make that point,</p>
<p>especially because for a lot of people,</p>
<p>even if you do this ramp up phase,</p>
<p>six servings per day of fermented foods</p>
<p>can seem like quite a lot.</p>
<p>So what are these fermented foods, right?</p>
<p>I think many of us are familiar with certain cheeses</p>
<p>and being fermented and beer being fermented</p>
<p>and kombucha is fermented.</p>
<p>In this study, they focus specifically</p>
<p>on low sugar fermented foods.</p>
<p>So this would be plain yogurt,</p>
<p>in some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut.</p>
<p>An important consideration, however,</p>
<p>is that it needs to contain</p>
<p>what are called live active cultures,</p>
<p>which means there actually have to be microbiota</p>
<p>that are alive inside the sauerkraut.</p>
<p>One way you know whether or not that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is if you purchase sauerkraut or pickles or kimchi</p>
<p>from a jar or a container</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the non-refrigerated shelf,</p>
<p>or the non-refrigerated section of your grocery store,</p>
<p>it is not going to contain live active cultures</p>
<p>of microbiota.</p>
<p>And likewise, if you consume yogurt</p>
<p>that has a lot of sugar or other components added to it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to have the same positive effect</p>
<p>on the microbiome, at least that&rsquo;s the prediction,</p>
<p>given some of the relationship</p>
<p>between the sorts of microbiota that live in sugar</p>
<p>versus plain type yogurts.</p>
<p>They gave people the option of consuming</p>
<p>any number of different low sugar fermented foods</p>
<p>so that again, that could be sauerkraut, kimchi,</p>
<p>things like kefir, natto.</p>
<p>In Japan, they consume natto, which is a fermented food.</p>
<p>Beer was not one of the fermented foods</p>
<p>that was included in the fermented food list.</p>
<p>And when we say six servings per day,</p>
<p>that is indeed six ounce servings</p>
<p>or four to six ounce servings.</p>
<p>It was not six servings of what&rsquo;s listed on the package.</p>
<p>So again, that turns out to be</p>
<p>a fair amount of fermented foods.</p>
<p>How should you gauge</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re getting enough of this?</p>
<p>Well, if you decide to take on this protocol</p>
<p>of ingesting more fermented foods,</p>
<p>which at least by my read of this study</p>
<p>and some of the followup work that&rsquo;s being done,</p>
<p>sounds like a terrific idea.</p>
<p>If you want to improve your gut microbiome</p>
<p>for all the great reasons that one would want to,</p>
<p>brain, body health, reduced inflammation and on and on,</p>
<p>well then you definitely want to focus on fermented foods</p>
<p>that you enjoy consuming.</p>
<p>So for you, if that&rsquo;s kefir or for you that&rsquo;s plain yogurt</p>
<p>or for you that&rsquo;s sauerkraut,</p>
<p>which happens to be my personal favorite,</p>
<p>then you want to make sure that it&rsquo;s going to be something</p>
<p>that you are going to enjoy ingesting quite a lot of</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re going to be okay with ingesting</p>
<p>probably throughout the day.</p>
<p>Now people follow different meal schedules, of course,</p>
<p>but this does require not just eating</p>
<p>all the fermented foods just before bedtime or at one meal.</p>
<p>I suppose you could do that,</p>
<p>but in general, it&rsquo;s going to work best</p>
<p>in terms of limiting gastric distress</p>
<p>by spreading it out throughout the day.</p>
<p>I also want to mention brine.</p>
<p>Brine is the liquid that surrounds sauerkraut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that very salty fluid.</p>
<p>And that contains a lot of active live cultures.</p>
<p>And they did include,</p>
<p>or they allowed people to include brine in this study.</p>
<p>And in discussions with Dr. Sonnenberg,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll go into in more detail on the episode</p>
<p>that comes out next week,</p>
<p>we talk a lot about the particular value</p>
<p>that brine might hold in terms of bringing about</p>
<p>microbiota diversity because of the richness</p>
<p>of live cultures that it contains.</p>
<p>I do want to focus for a moment on the high fiber condition</p>
<p>because there were some interesting observations</p>
<p>about the people that were placed into that condition.</p>
<p>First of all, increasing the amount of fiber</p>
<p>definitely increased the number of enzymes</p>
<p>that can be used to digest fiber.</p>
<p>This is in keeping with this idea of this ramp up phase</p>
<p>where accumulation of more fiber intake</p>
<p>can over time lead to less gastric distress,</p>
<p>but also to more utilization of fiber,</p>
<p>which overall should be a good thing.</p>
<p>So while they didn&rsquo;t observe an increase</p>
<p>in immune system function</p>
<p>or an increase in microbiota diversity,</p>
<p>there was an increase in these fiber digesting enzymes.</p>
<p>They also observed what they called</p>
<p>personalized immune responses.</p>
<p>These were some subgroups within the high fiber group</p>
<p>that had interesting changes in terms of their reactions to,</p>
<p>or I should say their inflammatome,</p>
<p>meaning the inflammatory markers they expressed</p>
<p>as well as their microbiota diversity.</p>
<p>So there were essentially three groups.</p>
<p>One group actually showed an increase</p>
<p>in inflammatory markers, so that was quite surprising</p>
<p>and probably not wonderful for the message</p>
<p>that fiber is always good for us,</p>
<p>but that was a small cohort within the fiber intake group.</p>
<p>Another group and still another group</p>
<p>both showed reductions in baseline microbiota diversity,</p>
<p>although to varying degrees.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to paint the picture that fiber is bad,</p>
<p>but fiber certainly did not have the positive effects</p>
<p>on microbiota diversity</p>
<p>that the high fermented food diet did.</p>
<p>So my read of this study,</p>
<p>and I think the stance that many others have taken</p>
<p>as a consequence of these data</p>
<p>is that we should be increasing our fermented food intake,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s simply a good thing to do</p>
<p>in order to support our gut microbiome</p>
<p>and to reduce inflammatory signals in our brain and body.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different ways to do that.</p>
<p>I mentioned some of the particular foods.</p>
<p>However, anytime you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about ingesting fermented foods,</p>
<p>especially the high quality ones</p>
<p>that come from the refrigerated section of the grocery store</p>
<p>or that end that have low sugar content, et cetera,</p>
<p>we do have to be considerate of cost</p>
<p>because certain things like kombuchas, for instance,</p>
<p>can be quite costly.</p>
<p>I should also mention some kombuchas</p>
<p>actually contain alcohol, some do not,</p>
<p>or contain very little amounts of alcohol.</p>
<p>One way to avoid the high cost of fermented foods</p>
<p>while still being able to accumulate</p>
<p>a lot of fermented food intake</p>
<p>is to simply make those fermented foods yourself.</p>
<p>And this is something that we&rsquo;ve started exploring</p>
<p>and experimenting with in our home.</p>
<p>One simple way to do this</p>
<p>is to just make your own sauerkraut.</p>
<p>It involves very few ingredients.</p>
<p>It basically involves cabbage, water, and salt,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a specific process that you need to follow</p>
<p>in order to create these large volumes of sauerkraut at home</p>
<p>using that low cost method.</p>
<p>The best resource that I know of</p>
<p>in order to follow a great recipe</p>
<p>to make homemade sauerkraut</p>
<p>would be the recipe for homemade sauerkraut</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s contained in Tim Ferriss&rsquo; book,</p>
<p>The 4-Hour Chef.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an excellent protocol there.</p>
<p>It involves chopping up the cabbage,</p>
<p>putting into a bowl, mashing it up with your hands,</p>
<p>which can be fun, putting water in there,</p>
<p>some salt, covering it,</p>
<p>and then keeping it in a particular environment,</p>
<p>and then routinely scraping off</p>
<p>some of the material from the surface.</p>
<p>You have to do that in order to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not getting microbes and things growing in it</p>
<p>that are bad for you.</p>
<p>So you definitely want to pay careful attention</p>
<p>to the protocol,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a very, very low cost way</p>
<p>of generating lots and lots of fermented food</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t go broke trying to improve your microbiome.</p>
<p>The other thing that you can do</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really obsessed with kombucha</p>
<p>or something like that to avoid the high cost of kombucha</p>
<p>is there are ways that you can get the SCOBY,</p>
<p>which basically allows you to make your own kombucha at home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried this, but when I was a postdoc,</p>
<p>there was an undergraduate in the lab,</p>
<p>I think, well, I won&rsquo;t out him,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s now gone on to medical school,</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s passed his residency</p>
<p>and is a practicing doctor,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, he was always making kombucha at home.</p>
<p>He told me it was exceedingly easy,</p>
<p>but then again, he had a number of other skills</p>
<p>and attributes that made me think</p>
<p>that he could do pretty much anything with ease,</p>
<p>whereas I tend to struggle with even basic cooking.</p>
<p>So maybe if you&rsquo;re feeling a little more adventurous,</p>
<p>you could explore making your own kombucha,</p>
<p>but there are a number of different protocols</p>
<p>and recipes out there</p>
<p>for making your own low sugar fermented foods.</p>
<p>So you needn&rsquo;t run out and buy fresh sauerkraut</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>I should also mention for those of you</p>
<p>that are interested in getting your fermented intake</p>
<p>from pickles, jarred pickles rarely,</p>
<p>if ever, contain ferment.</p>
<p>Mostly they&rsquo;re just soaked in vinegar water</p>
<p>and with some spices,</p>
<p>but there are some that contain ferment.</p>
<p>You actually have to look for that on the container.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, maybe someone out there</p>
<p>knows how to make natto and knows how to make kimchi well</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>It certainly is the case based on the data from the study</p>
<p>that ingesting more servings of fermented food per day</p>
<p>ought to be beneficial for our gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And since this is an episode, not just about gut microbiome,</p>
<p>but gut brain health,</p>
<p>I should mention that one form of signaling</p>
<p>between the gut microbiome and the brain,</p>
<p>which we did not discuss, and I&rsquo;ll just touch on briefly,</p>
<p>is that when the inflammatome</p>
<p>or the genes and markers of inflammation</p>
<p>are kept in a healthy range,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an active signaling</p>
<p>of that immune system status to the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intermediate cell type</p>
<p>that communicates immune status to the brain.</p>
<p>And that cell type is the microglial cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a type of glia, as the name suggests.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s a lot of inflammation in the body,</p>
<p>these microglia actually get activated</p>
<p>and can start eating away at various components</p>
<p>of the brain and nervous system.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean massive eating away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to digest the whole brain,</p>
<p>but these microglia are sort of the resident macrophages</p>
<p>of the brain.</p>
<p>Macrophages are in the periphery</p>
<p>and they gobble up debris and things of that sort.</p>
<p>The microglia on a regular basis are eating up debris</p>
<p>that accumulates across waking cycles</p>
<p>and in response to micro damage of the brain</p>
<p>that occurs on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So they have a lot of important basic everyday,</p>
<p>what we call housekeeping functions.</p>
<p>But when there&rsquo;s a lot of inflammation in the body,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a massive immune response,</p>
<p>the microglia can be hyperactivated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s thought to lead to any number</p>
<p>of different cognitive defects or challenges,</p>
<p>thinking, or maybe even some forms</p>
<p>of neurodegeneration over time.</p>
<p>Although that last point is more of a hypothesis</p>
<p>than a well tamped down fact at this point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of investigation to be done in humans.</p>
<p>The animal data, however, are very, very strong</p>
<p>that when the immune system is activated</p>
<p>or chronically activated or hyperactivated,</p>
<p>that neural tissue, meaning brain tissue</p>
<p>and other central nervous system tissue can suffer.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of reasons to want</p>
<p>to not just improve microbiome diversity,</p>
<p>but to also improve immune system function</p>
<p>and to limit the number of inflammatory markers</p>
<p>that are present in the body because of the way</p>
<p>those inflammatory markers can signal</p>
<p>deleterious events in the brain.</p>
<p>And while eating fermented foods</p>
<p>and making your own fermented foods</p>
<p>and buying high quality fermented foods</p>
<p>might seem like an inconvenience,</p>
<p>I would say that from the perspective</p>
<p>of cost benefit or effort benefit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually quite a good situation</p>
<p>where if you can just ramp up the number of fermented foods</p>
<p>or servings of fermented foods that you&rsquo;re eating per day</p>
<p>over a period of a few weeks</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re tolerating that well,</p>
<p>that ought to have a very positive effect</p>
<p>on your microbiome diversity</p>
<p>and indeed on gut brain function.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be the last to suggest</p>
<p>that people completely forego on fiber.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some debate out there</p>
<p>as to how much fiber we need</p>
<p>and whether or not certain forms of fiber</p>
<p>are better than others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get into that debate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s barbed wire enough without me injecting</p>
<p>my own views into that debate.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s ample evidence</p>
<p>to support the fact that for most people,</p>
<p>ingesting a fair amount of fiber is going to be a good idea.</p>
<p>I would just say that make sure that you&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>ingesting a fair amount of fermented foods.</p>
<p>And along the lines of fiber</p>
<p>in an accompanying article published in Cell,</p>
<p>which was sort of a, what we call a news and views piece</p>
<p>about the Sonnenberg and Gardner paper,</p>
<p>they make a quite good point,</p>
<p>which is that the increase in fiber intake</p>
<p>that led to this increase in carbohydrate active enzymes,</p>
<p>these C-A-Z zymes, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>these are enzymes that help digest fiber,</p>
<p>quote, indicating an enhanced capacity for the microbiome</p>
<p>to degrade complex carbohydrates present in fibrous foods.</p>
<p>So in other words, eating more fiber and fibrous foods</p>
<p>allowed for an increase in these enzymes</p>
<p>that allow you to eat still more fibrous foods</p>
<p>or to better digest fibrous foods</p>
<p>that are coming in through other sources.</p>
<p>So there is at least one utility for increasing fiber,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s separate from the gut microbiota diversity</p>
<p>and reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t touch on some of the data</p>
<p>and controversy about artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>and the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear that what I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>has only been established in animal models,</p>
<p>in a mouse model, at least to my knowledge.</p>
<p>What the studies have shown, and there were several,</p>
<p>but one published in the journal Nature a few years back</p>
<p>is the one that got the most amount of attention,</p>
<p>is that animals that consume large amounts</p>
<p>of artificial sweeteners, in particular,</p>
<p>things like saccharin or sucralose,</p>
<p>show disruptions in their gut microbiome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any studies in humans</p>
<p>that show the equivalent effect,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not aware of any studies in humans</p>
<p>that show the equivalent effect</p>
<p>for things like plant-based low-calorie sweeteners,</p>
<p>things like stevia, monk fruit, and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And at least by my exploration,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any data specifically related</p>
<p>to the sweetener aspartame.</p>
<p>So right now it&rsquo;s somewhat controversial,</p>
<p>and actually this is kind of a third rail topic out there</p>
<p>when one group will come out saying</p>
<p>that artificial sweeteners are bad</p>
<p>because they disrupt the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The response generally from a number of people as well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only been shown in animal models,</p>
<p>and indeed that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So right now I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a strong case</p>
<p>one way or the other.</p>
<p>I think that people should basically ask themselves</p>
<p>whether or not they like artificial sweeteners or not,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re willing to risk it or not,</p>
<p>and obviously that&rsquo;s an individual choice.</p>
<p>I also want to point out a recent study</p>
<p>from Diego Borges&rsquo; lab, which actually shows, however,</p>
<p>that neurons in the gut, those neuropod cells,</p>
<p>are actually capable of distinguishing</p>
<p>between real sugars and artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>This is a really interesting body of work.</p>
<p>It was published just recently, I should say, February 2022.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>the preference for sugar over sweetener</p>
<p>depends on a gut sensor cell.</p>
<p>And to make a long story short,</p>
<p>what they showed was there&rsquo;s a category of neuropod cells</p>
<p>that recognize sugar in the gut</p>
<p>and signal that information</p>
<p>about the presence of sugar in the gut to the brain</p>
<p>via the pathways we talked about before,</p>
<p>the no-dose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the very same category of neurons</p>
<p>can respond to artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>and signal that information to the brain,</p>
<p>but the pattern of signaling and indeed the signature pattern</p>
<p>that is conveyed to the brain and received by the brain</p>
<p>is actually quite a bit different</p>
<p>when these same neurons are responding</p>
<p>to artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar.</p>
<p>This is very interesting because what it means</p>
<p>is first of all, that neurons have incredible specificity</p>
<p>in terms of what they are signaling</p>
<p>from the gut to the brain.</p>
<p>And it also means that there may be a particular signal</p>
<p>that the brain receives that says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m receiving some intake of food or drink that tastes sweet</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t actually offer much nutrients</p>
<p>in the direction of sweetness,</p>
<p>meaning that it doesn&rsquo;t have calories despite being sweet.</p>
<p>Now, again, this is all subconscious processing.</p>
<p>And like with the previous studies,</p>
<p>we were just discussing about artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>generally and the gut microbiome generally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear how this relates to humans</p>
<p>at this point in time.</p>
<p>But given the similarity of cellular processes</p>
<p>and molecular processes at the level of gut brain in mice,</p>
<p>I think it stands to reason that these neuropod cells</p>
<p>very likely are capable of signaling presence</p>
<p>of real sweetener versus artificial sweetener</p>
<p>in humans as well,</p>
<p>although that still remains to be determined empirically.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to just briefly recap what I&rsquo;ve covered today.</p>
<p>I started off by talking about the structure and function</p>
<p>of the gut brain axis.</p>
<p>I described the basic structure and function</p>
<p>of the digestive pathway</p>
<p>and how that digestive pathway harbors microbiota species,</p>
<p>meaning many, many little bacteria</p>
<p>that can signal all sorts of things</p>
<p>to the rest of the brain and body.</p>
<p>And indeed, we talked about the various ways</p>
<p>that they do that.</p>
<p>We talked about direct pathways,</p>
<p>literally nerve networks that extend from the gut</p>
<p>up to the brain and from the brain back to the gut.</p>
<p>And we talked about indirect pathways,</p>
<p>how some of the gut microbiota</p>
<p>can actually synthesize neurotransmitters</p>
<p>that get out into the bloodstream, can impact the body,</p>
<p>can impact the immune system,</p>
<p>and can get into the brain</p>
<p>and act as neurotransmitters in the brain,</p>
<p>just as would neurotransmitters</p>
<p>that originate from within the brain.</p>
<p>We also talked about what constitutes</p>
<p>a healthy versus unhealthy microbiome.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very clear that having a diverse microbiome</p>
<p>is healthier than having a non-diverse microbiome.</p>
<p>But as I pointed out,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a lot of questions</p>
<p>as to exactly what microbiota species you want to enhance</p>
<p>and which ones you want to suppress in the gut</p>
<p>in order to achieve the best gut-brain axis function.</p>
<p>We talked about how things like fasting</p>
<p>might impact the microbiome</p>
<p>and how some of that might be a little bit counterintuitive</p>
<p>based on some of the other positive effects of fasting.</p>
<p>Or if we&rsquo;re not just discussing fasting,</p>
<p>some other types of somewhat restrictive diets,</p>
<p>either restrictive in time</p>
<p>in terms of macronutrient intake,</p>
<p>how those may or may not improve</p>
<p>the health of the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway was that</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know exactly</p>
<p>how specific diets impact the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know how fasting</p>
<p>either promotes or degrades the microbiome,</p>
<p>we really can&rsquo;t say whether or not</p>
<p>they are improving or degrading the microbiome at this time.</p>
<p>However, it is clear that stress,</p>
<p>in particular chronic stress,</p>
<p>can disrupt the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also clear, of course,</p>
<p>that antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the topic</p>
<p>of prebiotics and probiotics.</p>
<p>And I emphasize the fact that for most people,</p>
<p>ingesting high quality non-processed foods</p>
<p>that include some prebiotic fiber,</p>
<p>but also that include some probiotics</p>
<p>will probably be healthy,</p>
<p>but not excessive levels of probiotics.</p>
<p>High levels of supplemented probiotics</p>
<p>of the sort that would come in a probiotic pill</p>
<p>or even prescription probiotics</p>
<p>would probably lend themselves best</p>
<p>to when people were under severe chronic stress</p>
<p>or had just come off a serious round</p>
<p>or an ongoing or repeated rounds of antibiotics.</p>
<p>That does not mean that ingesting probiotics</p>
<p>in any form or any kind is not good.</p>
<p>It just means that the very high dose probiotics,</p>
<p>again, typically found in prescription form</p>
<p>or capsule pill form,</p>
<p>probably are best reserved to cases</p>
<p>where, of course, your doctor prescribes them.</p>
<p>You should always follow your doctor&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>But in cases where perhaps you are jet lagged,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re traveling excessively for any reason</p>
<p>or working excessively, you&rsquo;re not getting enough sleep,</p>
<p>or your diet has radically changed from normal.</p>
<p>And we talked about how increasing the amount of fiber</p>
<p>in your diet might be useful</p>
<p>for increasing fiber digesting enzymes</p>
<p>and the assimilation of fibrous foods,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s really the ingestion of fermented foods.</p>
<p>And in fact, getting anywhere from four</p>
<p>or even up to six servings a day of fermented foods</p>
<p>can be immensely beneficial</p>
<p>for reducing inflammatory markers in the body</p>
<p>and for improving microbiota diversity all along the gut</p>
<p>and thereby improving signaling</p>
<p>and outcomes along the gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>So we went all the way from structure to function</p>
<p>to the four kinds of signaling,</p>
<p>mechanical, chemical, indirect-direct,</p>
<p>probiotics, fiber, and fermented foods.</p>
<p>And I tossed in a little bit at the end there</p>
<p>also about ways that you can make</p>
<p>your own fermented foods at home</p>
<p>in order to try and offset some of the costs.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s just kind of fun to do.</p>
<p>And some of those actually taste quite good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually found that the fermented sauerkraut</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re making at home actually rivals the sauerkraut</p>
<p>that you can buy out of the refrigerated section</p>
<p>at the grocery store.</p>
<p>And I am by no means a skilled cook or chef</p>
<p>and basically have no culinary skill whatsoever.</p>
<p>So if I can do it, you can do it.</p>
<p>I hope you found this information useful</p>
<p>and perhaps also actionable.</p>
<p>One of my motivations for doing this episode was,</p>
<p>again, as a primer for the episode</p>
<p>with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg,</p>
<p>where we go really deep into the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>less so into the gut-brain axis,</p>
<p>but really deep into the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>what it is, what it does, what it doesn&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>and some of the emerging findings from his lab</p>
<p>that are yet to be published.</p>
<p>And I also was excited to do this episode</p>
<p>because I think many of us have heard</p>
<p>about the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>We hear about these bacteria that live in our gut.</p>
<p>We hear about the gut-brain axis</p>
<p>or that 90% or more of the serotonin</p>
<p>that we make is made in our gut.</p>
<p>We hear about the gut as a second brain and so forth.</p>
<p>But I think for many people,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really have a clear picture</p>
<p>of what the gut microbiome is</p>
<p>and the pathways and mechanisms</p>
<p>by which it can signal to the brain</p>
<p>and to the other parts of the body.</p>
<p>So I hope that today&rsquo;s information</p>
<p>at least improved the clarity around that topic</p>
<p>and leaves you with a more vivid picture</p>
<p>of this incredible system that is our gut-brain axis.</p>
