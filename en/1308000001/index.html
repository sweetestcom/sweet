    <p>Hey everybody, welcome to the first episode of the all-in podcast with Chamath Kalyanarathia</p>
<p>and Jason Galkatis. That cackling voice.</p>
<p>Where we&rsquo;re trying to save ourselves from the end of the world.</p>
<p>It is literally, you know, we thought we&rsquo;d start this podcast on April 1st, Chamath,</p>
<p>and everybody thinks it&rsquo;s like a big joke, that it&rsquo;s an April Fool&rsquo;s joke. It just happened to</p>
<p>be the time was perfect. We had full intentionality of starting the podcast,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re sitting here at home, quarantined. How many days have you been home? When&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>last time you went out of your house? Well, I&rsquo;ve gone out, but I&rsquo;ve basically</p>
<p>been self-quarantined for two weeks now. I haven&rsquo;t left my house since Tuesday night,</p>
<p>and this is her shower in about 72 hours. This is, you know, and then Chamath and I decided since,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re going to talk about, obviously, the coronavirus today. We bring in</p>
<p>the smartest person we know in terms of the biotech and health space, and that&rsquo;s David</p>
<p>Friedberg, who&rsquo;s a close friend of ours. He founded or co-founded Climate.com Metro Mile,</p>
<p>and he now is the CEO of The Production Board, which is a biotech incubator, accelerator startup.</p>
<p>What do you, how do you refer to it, David? Yeah, we&rsquo;re a foundry in broadly life sciences,</p>
<p>food, agriculture, and human health. Got it. So-</p>
<p>Jay, actually, before we do that, can we actually give a shout out to our sponsor,</p>
<p>which is all the incredibly shitty enterprise software that nobody fucking uses, and there</p>
<p>are no coupon codes because there are no ads in this podcast, nor will there ever be. Back to you,</p>
<p>Jason. Which I really appreciate. It&rsquo;s like this deal gets better and better. Chamath&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>hey, Jason, I want to do a podcast. I want you to put all your resources into it and all your</p>
<p>time into it, and here&rsquo;s the best part. The entire business model is we lose money. Thanks, Chamath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic. It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like a microcosm of the venture industry all in one podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah. So let&rsquo;s just talk about and start off here with, you know, we&rsquo;re sitting here,</p>
<p>and today is the 14th of March. This entire coronavirus epidemic and, you know,</p>
<p>essentially the chaos really has only started here in the United States in the last 72 hours</p>
<p>or so that people are actually taking it seriously. They canceled the NBA, and I think that is the</p>
<p>definitive tipping point of when it hit public consciousness that this is no joke, and it was</p>
<p>really kind of dramatic, and Chamath, obviously, you&rsquo;re a part owner of the Warriors, and so I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a good thing for you to discuss. When you saw that announcement that at tip-off they</p>
<p>found out that one of the players tested positive and they canceled the game and sent people home,</p>
<p>what were you thinking? Obviously, there&rsquo;s a financial aspect to this, but the more important</p>
<p>one is the unprecedented nature of this. I actually had two thoughts. The first thought</p>
<p>was it&rsquo;s incredible that all these organizations, other than the federal bureaucracy, were taking</p>
<p>such swift measures on their own. I mean, typically these things, a reaction to a pandemic</p>
<p>should be institutional and very much top-down. I think even every libertarian amongst us would</p>
<p>sort of say, I mean, this is the kind of thing where the president and the government needs</p>
<p>to step in first and kind of like dictate how things should happen. Instead, it was local</p>
<p>governments, state governments, sports leagues, companies, all making decisions in the absence,</p>
<p>in a vacuum of leadership. That&rsquo;s the first thing I thought. And then the second thing I thought was</p>
<p>these actions are too unpredictable and they&rsquo;re too all over the place. So, you have some states</p>
<p>and some organizations acting in a really decisive, aggressive way and others not.</p>
<p>And so, in the absence of highly coordinated action, this kind of half-in, half-out approach</p>
<p>is probably as bad as the no strategy, sort of clapping as a strategy in blackjack.</p>
<p>And so, those are my two thoughts. I don&rsquo;t know, David, how did you react?</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like it&rsquo;s about time. We&rsquo;re kind of a little bit behind the times in terms</p>
<p>of the behavior on reducing social isolation. There were a lot of people calling for it weeks</p>
<p>ago that the U.S. is behind the eight ball on this thing and we really missed it, Mr. Mark.</p>
<p>But obviously, as soon as a person shows up and tests positive at a game, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>and your objective is don&rsquo;t put anyone at risk. You got to shut it all down.</p>
<p>So, it seemed inevitable. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that this sort of behavior wasn&rsquo;t done earlier where</p>
<p>we could have kind of mitigated the spread as we&rsquo;ve seen kind of be successful elsewhere.</p>
<p>David, why didn&rsquo;t we do that? You were tracking this from an early stage. We were talking about</p>
<p>it during the poker games and just when we were chatting in our online group. And you seem to</p>
<p>understand that this was very serious, very early. Balje, if I&rsquo;m pronouncing his name correctly,</p>
<p>formerly of Andreessen Horowitz, was on this in late January, early February. And here we are</p>
<p>six weeks later and we&rsquo;re taking it seriously six weeks later. Why do you think there was this crazy</p>
<p>failure to anticipate this? I mean, it was right there in front of us. We were watching the streets</p>
<p>of Wuhan being blasted with chemical cleaners and we just sat there and just retweeted it and</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t do anything. I think it&rsquo;s a lot like climate change. If it&rsquo;s not immediate in terms</p>
<p>of time and space, you don&rsquo;t take action. As soon as it becomes immediate in time and space, you kind</p>
<p>of jump to action and it may be a little too late at that point because the fires already kind of</p>
<p>run down the meadow. We also politicized it from day one. I mean, people had to draw a line in the</p>
<p>sand. Trump had to draw a line in the sand, which is, I&rsquo;m not going to threaten my presidency.</p>
<p>And so he had to downplay it and he had to sort of puff up his chest a little bit. And</p>
<p>that kind of rhetoric from the President of the United States, whether you like it or not,</p>
<p>flows downhill. It touches the CDC, it touched HHS, it touches Fox News. And you have</p>
<p>behaviors that were dependent and that are pretty correlated to sets of attitudes. So,</p>
<p>for example, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw, but there&rsquo;s been this incredible retweeting</p>
<p>of OpenTable reservation data. It&rsquo;s incredible. And what it shows on the OpenTable blog,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m glad that they put this data out. I don&rsquo;t know how long they&rsquo;ve been doing it.</p>
<p>But it shows reservation volume on a state level and on a city level and as it trends over time.</p>
<p>And what you essentially see is in places that have taken social isolation seriously,</p>
<p>if you use restaurant reservations as a proxy for people&rsquo;s propensity to take this</p>
<p>pandemic seriously and socially isolate, it&rsquo;s fallen off a cliff. And reservations are down 50%.</p>
<p>And in other places where you would otherwise be a believer of the rhetoric or a believer of</p>
<p>different versions of the news that painted this thing as anything less than a pandemic,</p>
<p>what you saw was in some cases, I saw Oklahoma City as of yesterday,</p>
<p>where traffic to restaurants was up. And so, if you have a multi-week asymptomatic</p>
<p>super spreader population in any of those states, you&rsquo;re going to see some really difficult</p>
<p>circumstances. And it will unfortunately in the near term be drawn on what seems like</p>
<p>political lines not dissimilar to climate change, as David says.</p>
<p>Hey, David, when you hear Chamath&rsquo;s sort of breakdown of Trump didn&rsquo;t want to risk his</p>
<p>presidency by being alarmist, having the stock market crash, and then as somebody who has spent</p>
<p>their life in technology and science, the anti-science, anti-expertise kind of paradigm</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been living with these last couple of years, how frustrating is that for you when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so obvious what needs to be done? And then in terms of what needs to be done,</p>
<p>if you were president, and you had seen this in January, what would you have done, David?</p>
<p>If you actually had the ability, and let&rsquo;s say it was February 1st and you had seen</p>
<p>what happened in Wuhan, what would your line of attack have been?</p>
<p>Well, I think that the anti-science rhetoric, by the way, is just nothing new. We view it</p>
<p>reasonably widespread now. There&rsquo;s been anti-climate change. I&rsquo;ve got a personal history</p>
<p>because I sold my last company to Monsanto, so I sat on the side of the anti-GMO movement.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen this throughout the course of history, anti-Copernican, anti-Galileo. This</p>
<p>is not new. There&rsquo;s institutions and systems that benefit from people not necessarily being</p>
<p>connected to science and what it can prove. And what it demonstrates, the reality is,</p>
<p>over time, truth emerges. So science will find truth more than fiction will. And so hopefully,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll realize that over time. The problem is the interim damage it can cause.</p>
<p>From a presidential point of view, I think the first thing that was missing is just testing.</p>
<p>And I just want to talk about testing for a second because it&rsquo;s so critical. We&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>a lot over the last couple of weeks in the media and as a group about where&rsquo;s all the tests,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s all the tests. One of the important things to understand is the tests that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing today and the tests that everyone talks about are called PCR tests. And these are tests</p>
<p>that basically measure active living viruses in your body. So it measures their RNA. And so if you</p>
<p>do a PCR test and you&rsquo;re positive, what it&rsquo;s telling you is there&rsquo;s an active virus that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>within your body. If you did a PCR test and you were sick with a virus a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>it would show up as negative, but you were still exposed to that virus. And one of the things that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really know is how many people have actually been exposed to this particular virus</p>
<p>and for how long. And so the PCR tests are really important about getting an acute case care for as</p>
<p>quickly as possible and quarantined as quickly as possible. So that means you&rsquo;re in this kind</p>
<p>of active infectious state. But what we really have missed the boat on, and we&rsquo;re still missing</p>
<p>the boat on, is knowing who&rsquo;s been infected and to what extent this thing has actually spread</p>
<p>already. And you can do that with what&rsquo;s called an IgG test or an IgM test, where you&rsquo;re measuring</p>
<p>the antibodies that show up in your blood, and they&rsquo;ll be there for months for IgM and then for</p>
<p>years with IgG. And you can see if someone&rsquo;s actually been infected. And these tests are</p>
<p>super cheap to administer, super easy to make. And I think that would have been the first thing to</p>
<p>kind of kick off, you know, you should still have the PCR tests, but they&rsquo;re expensive, and they</p>
<p>take a long time to run, and they require chemical labs and all this stuff. An IgG or IgM test, you</p>
<p>can do like a pregnancy kit anywhere on the street. So we should have had 10 million of these</p>
<p>things distributed as quickly as possible. We should be putting them in airports or, you know,</p>
<p>in local hospitals, local community centers to really understand when this thing hits us. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best way to know. Taking someone&rsquo;s temperature, all that that tells you is, hey, this person has a</p>
<p>fever. By the way, only 80% of people that get this thing end up with a fever, you know, when</p>
<p>they kind of get checked in. And so that&rsquo;s kind of a crazy stat, right? One fifth of the people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have a fever that are actively infected with this virus. So we&rsquo;re missing a huge percentage of</p>
<p>infections if we&rsquo;re just taking temperatures and then doing a PCR test, and we&rsquo;re missing all the</p>
<p>people that just weren&rsquo;t infected. So I think that would have been the first thing is like,</p>
<p>figure out where this thing is infecting people to what extent and getting in front of it.</p>
<p>And testing right now. What is the state of testing right now? Do we, they keep,</p>
<p>you know, having these press conferences, I think Trump on Friday or yesterday,</p>
<p>Saturday, the 14th of March, on the 13th, on Friday, the 13th, he had what most people thought</p>
<p>was, you know, his best performance yet, his best leadership yet, obviously way too late.</p>
<p>And he said, hey, we&rsquo;re going to have millions of these tests, we&rsquo;re going to do them at Walgreens,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to tap the private sector. This seemed like a really smart move to tap</p>
<p>the private sector, Chamath. Do you think that this is going to be effective?</p>
<p>Well, I think the only way that we&rsquo;ll know whether this was effective is if we can actually figure</p>
<p>out how to get enough throughput, so that we can manage the number of beds and the hospital</p>
<p>facilities we have. So, you know, at this point, I think everybody admits that this thing is going</p>
<p>to roll through the population of the United States. What we&rsquo;re basically betting on now is</p>
<p>how long that takes and how well that&rsquo;s managed. And part of that has to do with how we can</p>
<p>differentiate, as David said, people who are, you know, symptomatic from the people that are</p>
<p>asymptomatic, but still positive. And then we can sort of enforce a more strict code on quarantining.</p>
<p>If all of those things can happen, we&rsquo;ll be in a reasonable place to at least manage the onslaught.</p>
<p>The thing with tapping the private sector in many ways is it&rsquo;s a brilliant strategy politically,</p>
<p>because it now sort of embraces a whole bunch of companies that are in the consciousness of America</p>
<p>as part of the solution, which actually by implication means that if this thing gets worse,</p>
<p>they are also then part of the problem. And I think that from that perspective, being able to,</p>
<p>you know, spread out and smear the blame, while preserving the optionality for,</p>
<p>you know, leadership in case it works, I think was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Incredibly cynical, and probably accurate. You&rsquo;re basically saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being cynical. No, I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s incredibly cynical to actually do that. I mean,</p>
<p>if that was actually Trump&rsquo;s thinking to say, let me spread the risk here, I&rsquo;ll make Pence and</p>
<p>Walgreens and these companies, the fall guys, if it doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, look, let&rsquo;s be fair. These guys were inside the tent for two weeks. So,</p>
<p>the only reason to bring them outside of the tent and have a presser where you shake their hand</p>
<p>is to do exactly that, right? And so, they were part of the solution when we thought the solution</p>
<p>could be contained. But that solution was kept relatively private, and the front-facing,</p>
<p>you know, person on the front lines was the President of the United States. All reasonable.</p>
<p>When it looked like this thing was getting out of control, what we needed to do was</p>
<p>re-establish some sense that there was a broader team in place,</p>
<p>and put all of these other people out in front. I mean, in fact, if you heard the presser,</p>
<p>the most interesting part of it was how adamant he was that people asked these other people</p>
<p>questions. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys were listening to it. But it was this constant</p>
<p>refrain of, does anybody want to ask these brilliant geniuses on stage with me any questions?</p>
<p>And, you know, the press had zero interest because they really wanted to understand</p>
<p>his mindset. So, you know, I think that from a political game of poker,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done the right things. He has done the right things, which is he&rsquo;s kept optionality</p>
<p>to say, look, you needed a steady hand at the till. That was me. I didn&rsquo;t overreact on the</p>
<p>front end. I brought in these people in the middle of it. And if he is able to salvage an</p>
<p>enormous economic stimulus package, I think the odds are on his side that history will judge that</p>
<p>he will have done a good job. And more than that, his odds of getting reelected are actually higher</p>
<p>than in the absence of Corona. Now, if none of those things come to pass, or many of the other</p>
<p>path dependencies kick in, and things are much worse, then that&rsquo;s probably not true. But from a</p>
<p>political kind of poker game, I think he has done the best he could from where he was,</p>
<p>you know, the last three days. He&rsquo;s in the best position he could have been in, all things</p>
<p>considered. Unless he had actually done the testing and taking it seriously from the beginning,</p>
<p>which is something also the press seemed very weird about. David, I want to get your perspective</p>
<p>on when Balaji was tweeting about this, and then the information. I&rsquo;m sorry, I always forget.</p>
<p>B-A-L-A-J-I. I&rsquo;ve had it on the podcast, but I always get it wrong. His name is Balaji,</p>
<p>Balaji. Balaji. Balaji. Listen, it only took me six years to figure out how to say</p>
<p>Palihapitiya, and now I&rsquo;m correcting everybody on how to say your last name. I appreciate that.</p>
<p>David, when you saw his&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t notice that I had a last name.</p>
<p>Bestie. Bestie C. When the Ricoh journalist who wrote that ridiculous story about, like,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is paranoid about handshakes, how much of what the media is doing is</p>
<p>just completely inaccurate over these last couple of weeks? What are your thoughts as an expert</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s quoted in the media about this moment in late-stage journalism where they seem to be more</p>
<p>concerned with dunking and clicks and link bait than the actually accurate transmission of</p>
<p>information? When I asked you to just even be on the podcast with Chamath and I today, you were</p>
<p>like, well, listen, I&rsquo;m not an expert, and you&rsquo;re the smartest person we know in the room about this</p>
<p>topic. What do you think is contributing there with the press and their ability to even process</p>
<p>something like this? Talking about science generally is really hard. Science-based journalism</p>
<p>is really hard. There&rsquo;s just so much to this, like trying to explain to people the difference</p>
<p>between a PCR test and an IgG test. It&rsquo;s like, you got to go do Bio 101 and have a conversation</p>
<p>and talk about this stuff. There&rsquo;s a learning curve, so it&rsquo;s a 30-minute conversation to</p>
<p>explain that. It&rsquo;s a 30-minute conversation to explain GMOs. It&rsquo;s a 30-minute conversation to</p>
<p>explain climate change. But I would argue that the journalists solve, or not the journalists,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to put down journalists, but I would argue that consumers consume the media they want</p>
<p>to consume, and then that media wins in the marketplace for media. I think this is just</p>
<p>generally true. We want to have six-second soundbites. We want to have 140-character</p>
<p>statements as a consumer class. As a result, the media production that caters to that demand is</p>
<p>going to win and is going to do better. If we want to see stuff that shit-talks other people</p>
<p>and blows up companies and puts down presidents and puts down speakers of the house, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to look for that. We&rsquo;re going to buy it. It&rsquo;s going to get more ad dollars. Then those journalists</p>
<p>are going to stay employed. The journalists that are writing long-form articles that are</p>
<p>science-based and require 30 minutes to sit down and read the whole article are not doing as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one to blame but the consumer. The same might be said of the presidency and other things.</p>
<p>We end up buying what we want to buy. It&rsquo;s not that the president showed up and he&rsquo;s the guy</p>
<p>that got elected. He&rsquo;s the product of what we wanted, of what the general population wanted.</p>
<p>By the way, back to the discussion earlier. The open table reservation data, in my mind,</p>
<p>is the single closest thing we&rsquo;re going to get to a referendum on exactly this issue.</p>
<p>Meaning, if you listen to MSNBC or CNN or CBS and ABC and you believe that strain of journalism</p>
<p>on this pandemic and you took precautionary steps a little bit earlier than say people who</p>
<p>read Breitbart or watched Fox News and then it turns out that disproportionately those states</p>
<p>where those media consumption patterns are prevalent are more affected, it&rsquo;ll be really</p>
<p>interesting to see how people, after all of that, deal with those choices and the implications and</p>
<p>then start to realize that we&rsquo;ve been past the days of journalism for a long time. We&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>business of editorializing. We&rsquo;ve been in that business since basically Facebook and Google</p>
<p>kind of destroyed the ability for journalism as it stands to remain intact. Now, they didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>on purpose, but it was the implication of building one and a half trillion of market cap. Consumers,</p>
<p>in many ways, as David said, not only let it happen but added gasoline to those fires.</p>
<p>But those things never resulted in anything meaningful until today. The linkages to</p>
<p>depression were kind of relatively brittle. The linkage to other things were relatively brittle.</p>
<p>So, there weren&rsquo;t necessarily direct health implications to your media consumption patterns.</p>
<p>This may be the first time where we can actually show a direct correlation</p>
<p>to you consume a specific media and a specific editorialization of a problem,</p>
<p>you end up with one result versus another. If that does end up happening, it&rsquo;ll be really</p>
<p>interesting how people internalize that result after this is all said and done.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re watching Fox News and they tell you Corona is a hoax, which the president and Fox were</p>
<p>literally saying 10 days ago, this is a hoax. It&rsquo;s part of the Russian conspiracy, the Ukraine</p>
<p>conspiracy, and now they&rsquo;re going Corona crazy, and this is a conspiracy, and then you decide you</p>
<p>would go out to eat, which the open table data is showing they&rsquo;re doing en masse, and you die,</p>
<p>or your grandparents, God forbid, die, maybe you&rsquo;re going to reflect on the actual consumption.</p>
<p>Because WeCode is a left-leaning publication, and they</p>
<p>told us that we were crazy for not wanting to shake hands.</p>
<p>Well, look, let&rsquo;s be honest, WeCode is fine, but in this situation with what we have to deal with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of the pimple on the dog&rsquo;s ass, that let&rsquo;s not worry about WeCode.</p>
<p>You have major media outlets who now have a responsibility to get on the same page</p>
<p>and tell one version, which is the truth. They have that responsibility now. I don&rsquo;t think there</p>
<p>should be any variability between what CBS, PBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, Fox, they all need to speak from</p>
<p>one set of scientific facts, as of yesterday when the president declared a state of emergency.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not, in my opinion, there is some level of culpability in those organizations,</p>
<p>because if those people consuming those outlets then behave in a different way,</p>
<p>which they otherwise would not have, had they had the different version of the news,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not individual&rsquo;s fault. That&rsquo;s the fault of an organization that&rsquo;s optimizing for</p>
<p>positioning, narrative, and monetization over a moral authority and an ethical</p>
<p>duty that they have to the United States. Let&rsquo;s, David, look forward here at what</p>
<p>is going to happen from March 14th forward. We have every Apple store closed, the NBA on</p>
<p>hiatus, obviously, as we discussed. Supposedly, a bunch of tasks are going to be done in the</p>
<p>coming weeks. Who knows? But people seem to be in the major cities quarantining in place,</p>
<p>obviously, stocking up food for a couple of weeks. If everybody in these major cities</p>
<p>does what they&rsquo;re supposed to do and basically rides out the next three weeks, four weeks,</p>
<p>what do you think the outcome in those cities will be, David?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be what we see in China. A lot of people look at the curve at the beginning, and it looks</p>
<p>like an exponential curve of growth, and it is exponential, but exponential curves end up</p>
<p>consuming everything, so they don&rsquo;t go on forever. What they resolve to is what&rsquo;s called a sigmoid</p>
<p>curve. They eventually flatten out, the second derivative changes, and they flatten out,</p>
<p>and you end up with this thing coming down the other side, as most biological systems can be</p>
<p>modeled with this function, a sigmoid function. A couple of weeks away, hopefully, from that</p>
<p>happening, if everyone stays locked down, the reality is we just don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s affected,</p>
<p>infected, who&rsquo;s been infected. I do still believe that we&rsquo;re probably at least one,</p>
<p>maybe more, orders of magnitude off in our infected population count,</p>
<p>especially here in the United States. We&rsquo;ll find that out over the next couple of months,</p>
<p>as these IgG tests get produced in China, they&rsquo;re getting shipped over here right now,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in Italy right now being used on the front lines, and we&rsquo;ll start to use those to</p>
<p>identify how many people actually are infected, and things will start to resolve.</p>
<p>In the meantime, David, what do you think are the best protocols of care,</p>
<p>and how do you think we&rsquo;re positioned if people bombard ICUs over the next few weeks?</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s a bunch of published reports now on what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not working in China,</p>
<p>and elsewhere. Italy, I think, is just swamped and overwhelmed. I just want to give you guys</p>
<p>these stats, right? Italy has about 12.5 critical care beds per capita, per 100,000, sorry,</p>
<p>population. The US has 35, so we&rsquo;re 3x the number of ICU or critical care beds per person than</p>
<p>Italy has. And there are now published reports on how you can manage symptoms and reduce the</p>
<p>duration of the infection, and reduce the severity of the symptoms for different populations.</p>
<p>And these are starting to be employed, and they&rsquo;re showing really great results.</p>
<p>There are active clinical trials that&rsquo;ll be published in the next two weeks that are</p>
<p>in desivir, which is this antiviral compound from Gilead, that anecdotally has had really</p>
<p>great efficacy and has really reduced the severity as long as you catch it early enough and start</p>
<p>giving it to patients right away. We&rsquo;re already starting to use it on a compassionate use basis</p>
<p>in the United States. The first guy they gave it to in Washington State started recovering the next</p>
<p>day. That was anecdotal, but we&rsquo;re going to get more data on that soon. I think that we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>we have the pieces now on how to care for people and how to get them to a point of recovery. We</p>
<p>just got to make sure we have enough beds and enough ventilators. Cities like San Francisco</p>
<p>have already taken over hotels like Milton here, and they&rsquo;re being converted into effectively ICU</p>
<p>departments that they can be used for the overflow or the mass crunch as patients show up. Luckily,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t gotten to that point yet. But I think that all the tools are there that we should be</p>
<p>able to manage down and get the fatality rate, hopefully within a range that looks a lot more</p>
<p>like what was called rest of China, which was like, you know, basically 20 basis points,</p>
<p>fatality rate of infected patients versus like Wuhan, which is like 4%.</p>
<p>When I thought remdesivir, David, remdesivir has to, it has to start like literally right when</p>
<p>your viral load starts to kick in. And I read but tell me if this is true. For maximum efficacy,</p>
<p>it needs to be administered intravenously. Yes, intravenously is the way it&rsquo;s been.</p>
<p>Gilead just launched a clinical trial, I think now or last week or this week, where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to try some oral remdesivir. Yeah, but yeah, it has been used as an intravenous treatment to</p>
<p>date. And there are there is a public a published study now that shown like, you know, earlier</p>
<p>treatment with remdesivir had a higher efficacy rate versus later. And that may explain why it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work in Ebola, because remdesivir failed. And Ebola is a very similar virus to this</p>
<p>Coronavirus. And remdesivir, quote unquote, failed in a clinical trial for Ebola, but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a duration window on like how long you&rsquo;ve been infected before you start getting remdesivir.</p>
<p>For the patients that had only been infected for a short period of time that got remdesivir,</p>
<p>they actually had a much higher recovery rate. Well, Ebola patients. And so that that is,</p>
<p>you know, kind of buttressing that argument. And they and these patients also were on chloroquine</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the combo of the two that seems to be the most efficacious.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s unclear. I mean, chloroquine is a, you know, a widely used compound, it&rsquo;s used for</p>
<p>malaria, it&rsquo;s got really nasty side effects. So you know, you don&rsquo;t want to overuse it or use it</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have to, but it&rsquo;s also shown significant efficacy. And it&rsquo;s being used at</p>
<p>some protocols in some countries right now for infected patients of Coronavirus with with good</p>
<p>results. Again, like it&rsquo;s so early, we don&rsquo;t have enough data and people haven&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>published enough on these things for it to really be kind of scientifically validated.</p>
<p>But but but anecdotally, a lot of folks are and the chatter is that chloroquine remdesivir having</p>
<p>really great effects. And people are you know, some there&rsquo;s some commentary about zinc and zinc</p>
<p>is a known antiviral compound, it can stop RNA replication in viral compounds, a lot of people</p>
<p>supplement with zinc for this reason, when they&rsquo;re when they have a cold or when they have the flu.</p>
<p>And so you know, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s high dose zinc remedies that are that are being postulated as</p>
<p>having some efficacy. But it&rsquo;s too early to say with great certainty what the best protocol is.</p>
<p>But there are different variations of these protocols that are being employed that are</p>
<p>working and reducing the fatality rate where you do have, by the way, you have to have hospital</p>
<p>beds, you have to have availability of staff. Otherwise, you have what you got in Italy,</p>
<p>Italy, like has already gone over the abyss, people just can&rsquo;t get treatment,</p>
<p>because there aren&rsquo;t enough healthcare workers to the number of patients. So it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>shit show. What, what, why is it that, you know, when we look at sort of, you know, if you look at</p>
<p>ArcGIS, a world meter, where are the cases in India? Yeah, where are the cases in Nigeria?</p>
<p>Like, what the hell is going on in those two countries? Why aren&rsquo;t those countries going</p>
<p>off the charts? It&rsquo;s crazy to me, because if you&rsquo;ve ever been to India, it is a friggin beehive,</p>
<p>right? population density is crazy. You can&rsquo;t do like as much as they say they&rsquo;ve got social</p>
<p>isolation going on in India. Now the same was true with SARS and MERS. So SARS and MERS did</p>
<p>not take off in India either. And so some people have speculated that India&rsquo;s failure to have</p>
<p>Coronavirus pandemic outbreaks has been a result of the high temperature. But if you look at the</p>
<p>temperature in India, over the last couple of weeks, it hasn&rsquo;t necessarily been that much higher</p>
<p>than and yes, there&rsquo;s a tipping point, I think it&rsquo;s around 77 Fahrenheit. But there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s evenings, there are people that in India that have been sick. So if someone&rsquo;s sick, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on a bus with 80 people in India, and it&rsquo;s evening, it&rsquo;s unlikely that you know, something</p>
<p>is not going on there. No, and by the way, in places like Delhi and places that are even north,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cold. I mean, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a winter in in Milan, for example, I mean, it&rsquo;s roughly</p>
<p>the same temperature. So the conditions are rife for this thing to spread, but it hasn&rsquo;t, it seems.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s three risk factors I want to highlight that have been identified as potential risk factor</p>
<p>that real risk factors for Coronavirus. The first is the age of the population. So people over 65</p>
<p>as a percent of population, Italy is the third oldest country in the world. Okay, so about a</p>
<p>quarter of Italians are over 65. That is nearly 3x or 2x what the US is as a percentage of population</p>
<p>being over 65. And it looks like if you&rsquo;re over 65, you have a 10 to 15%. Sorry, 10 to 15 x</p>
<p>likelihood of having a severe reaction to the SARS Coronavirus that we&rsquo;re experiencing right now.</p>
<p>The second is smoking, and there&rsquo;s differences of opinion on smoking. But here&rsquo;s a crazy statistic</p>
<p>on smoking for you. So the number of people, let me find the statistic, because I actually</p>
<p>pulled it up for you guys to mention it. The number of people that smoke per, okay, here it is.</p>
<p>Number of cigarettes consumed per year per person in Italy.</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s guess. Let&rsquo;s set the under over under per person in Italy.</p>
<p>So a pack a day would be 20. That&rsquo;s 7,000 a year or so. If you smoked a pack a day,</p>
<p>if half the people do that, I&rsquo;m going to set the line at 3,500 per year per person.</p>
<p>You want to take the over? I&rsquo;ll take the over. I&rsquo;ll take the over.</p>
<p>Okay, you guys are you guys are both off. It&rsquo;s 1500. Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s the United States. Yeah, the United States is 1000. So the United States most. Yeah,</p>
<p>1000 third less. And India is 89. Like no one smokes in India. And the percentage of the</p>
<p>population in India that&rsquo;s over 65 is less than like 9%. So India has this confluence of low</p>
<p>smokers, older population, warm weather, younger population, sorry, younger population, warm</p>
<p>weather. And so this may start to extend and the smoker rate is just like two orders of magnitude</p>
<p>off from the rest of these guys. So these things multiply, right? So think about Italy.</p>
<p>Italy has a very, very old population, like 2x with the US indexes. And again, that multiplies</p>
<p>by 10. So now you&rsquo;re talking about 20x the impact of a Coronavirus hitting everyone.</p>
<p>So 20x the impact there, they smoke about 50% more, so call it 30x. And they have a third the</p>
<p>number of beds. And that&rsquo;s a nonlinear relationship. Because as soon as you max out on ICU beds or</p>
<p>critical care beds, boom, you&rsquo;re over the abyss and everyone starts to die. And so the Italy problem</p>
<p>may be a confluence of this like elderly population, maybe a smoker, smoking population,</p>
<p>and the critical care beds per capita. And the opposite may kind of explain what&rsquo;s going on in</p>
<p>India. So do you think that India is sort of one or two sigma to the left, and Italy&rsquo;s one or two</p>
<p>sigma to the right? And which means that, you know, in a reasonably well managed, but even in</p>
<p>a poorly managed situation, you know, we may be a multiple of the flu in terms of its impact,</p>
<p>plus or minus? Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know. We look, one of the things that&rsquo;s crazy is the like,</p>
<p>the fact that this to talk about like distributions to math, like, some percentage of people have this</p>
<p>incredibly bad experience with this virus. And then a huge chunk of the curve have like mild,</p>
<p>cold and flu symptoms. And yes, there&rsquo;s anecdotal people saying, Oh, my God, it&rsquo;s not it was like</p>
<p>worse than the flu. But there&rsquo;s a large percentage of people who are recovering reasonably quickly</p>
<p>and seem to be getting over this thing. And that&rsquo;s of the people that we&rsquo;ve actually tested</p>
<p>positively with a PCR, we don&rsquo;t know how many people there are, it&rsquo;s going to be asymmetric,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re going to have an unusually high number of people that had really</p>
<p>bad symptoms that didn&rsquo;t show up, we&rsquo;re likely going to have a much higher percentage of people</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have symptoms that didn&rsquo;t show up. And so there is some like multiple probably of</p>
<p>people that we aren&rsquo;t accounting for at this point, that have had this virus.</p>
<p>I mean, like, if that&rsquo;s true, then there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of logic, actually, to being out,</p>
<p>because then if a lot of people have gone through this, then you&rsquo;re promoting that point where you</p>
<p>get to herd immunity faster. Because then the folks that basically have these antibodies are</p>
<p>out in the field, absorbing all of the spreaders and actually mitigating the</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s define the herd immune, the herd concept. So if you end up being exposed to a virus,</p>
<p>like this virus, you develop antibodies to it, and they stay in your body for, say, 20 years.</p>
<p>So when you hit that virus, again, whether it&rsquo;s like chickenpox, or measles are very similar,</p>
<p>your body will automatically wipe that virus out of your body, you don&rsquo;t have to develop the</p>
<p>antibodies, they&rsquo;re already there. So you&rsquo;re no longer a carrier. Yeah, you&rsquo;re actually technically,</p>
<p>they call it immune, right? You&rsquo;re immune to that virus now. And so the more people are immune,</p>
<p>think about a network with nodes on it. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a node and any nodes that it touches</p>
<p>get infected. If one of those nodes gets infected, and now it turns off, and it can&rsquo;t infect other</p>
<p>nodes, any virus that gets near that node, it&rsquo;s no longer going to be a point of transmission.</p>
<p>And so the more people have this thing, and the more people develop immunity,</p>
<p>this is why you have a sigmoid curve at a certain point, it stops spreading with as high a rate,</p>
<p>the current statistical rate that&rsquo;s estimated for this virus is 2.5 infections per person infected,</p>
<p>and flu just by kind of comparison is 1.5. And so this looks like a very contagious infection today.</p>
<p>But after enough people get infected, the curve flattens out. And for people to understand this,</p>
<p>Chamath, what was the when you were heading growth at Facebook, what was the viral coefficient?</p>
<p>At the peak, you know, one person joins Facebook, how many people have an impact with Facebook?</p>
<p>Seven, right. So if you have something like seven at the peak for Facebook, it hits over</p>
<p>a billion users in some 10 year period. Here, we&rsquo;re talking about, you know, a fraction.</p>
<p>Well, actually, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s an incredible example. Because like if you we used to call</p>
<p>that K, but in science, we call it R naught. But if R naught is seven, then you actually can see</p>
<p>how, you know, in about two and a half years, you touch basically 3 billion people. Now, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, you know, if you consider so in this interesting way, actually, Facebook&rsquo;s growth</p>
<p>of not of users, but of registered users. So people that may have churned out,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an incredibly interesting model for a highly viral super spreader disease in many ways.</p>
<p>And it shows you the window of time you have to act decisively to get in front of something.</p>
<p>Yeah. Which Facebook did to MySpace, like MyFacebook, basically, and MySpace,</p>
<p>they had that viral coefficient because the products were so,</p>
<p>they had so much friction, you have friction.</p>
<p>David, but David, do you think that people, if we if we run enough testing now to figure out</p>
<p>that people have these antibodies, they should be out? No, they should be mingling and interacting</p>
<p>and, and should we be sending all people out? Like, how do you? How do you actually have herd</p>
<p>mentality become a useful thing? Because what if everybody just isolates? Look, we do it so</p>
<p>successfully that none of us have this immunity? Look, this is a general, there&rsquo;s a philosophical</p>
<p>question about and it&rsquo;s how the FDA operates and the CDC and you have to ask these philosophical</p>
<p>questions first, which is what is your objective? What are you solving for? If your objective is to</p>
<p>minimize the number of people that die from this particular virus, you&rsquo;re going to have one</p>
<p>decision. And if your objective is to minimize the economic impact relative to the number of people</p>
<p>that will die as a result of bad economic impacts, you&rsquo;re going to have a different decision. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to kind of think in the in the in the broader context, if you&rsquo;re saying like,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let anyone get sick and don&rsquo;t let anyone die, everyone should stay home and not take any</p>
<p>risk. Right. And that&rsquo;s effectively what we&rsquo;re doing. And given the uncertainty, it certainly</p>
<p>seems to make sense from a policy perspective, we should be doing that today. You know, but the</p>
<p>result of like, look, we now know that some percentage of people have, have the IgG. And so</p>
<p>let me ask the other question, if I knew that 99% of people that got this thing had no lasting</p>
<p>effects and got over it as if it were a cold, would that rationalize saying everyone should</p>
<p>go outside because you have a 99% chance if you catch it, whereas 1% of people if they caught it</p>
<p>will still die. So you know, how do you draw the line, right? What&rsquo;s the right philosophical</p>
<p>decision in that context. And so even if what we&rsquo;re saying is true, that 99% of people can get</p>
<p>it, they&rsquo;re asymptomatic, they get over it, they develop immunity, and we can, you know, kind of</p>
<p>develop herd immunity, and very quickly kind of reduce this thing, we&rsquo;re still going to be putting</p>
<p>1% of people at risk of death by doing that. And so, you know, what&rsquo;s, guys, what&rsquo;s the over under</p>
<p>today? The President said he had a Coronavirus test administered last night.</p>
<p>He did?</p>
<p>The 13th. Yeah, he said that.</p>
<p>Finally, somebody cornered him.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on a 24 hour shot clock or less. I have my own view. I&rsquo;ll go last. But what do you got?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the over under on what the results are?</p>
<p>You know, he shakes a lot of hands, and he had a lot of foreign visitors, and some of them have</p>
<p>had it, I&rsquo;m going to put it at, I think it&rsquo;s got a 20% chance of having it. 30, something in that</p>
<p>range. One in five, one in three, something in that range.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know. Five, 5%.</p>
<p>I think that the answer, the answer that we will get is that he&rsquo;s negative. I think that the</p>
<p>the way in which they do this test is incredibly important. And so, if I had to guess,</p>
<p>I talked to I talked to Saks this morning about this as well. If I had to guess, here&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>would do, which is they test 50 people in the White House, all at the same time. You know,</p>
<p>they, they, I mean, like, this is what this is what we would do. You test 50 people in the White</p>
<p>House, right? And an incredibly small number of people know which vial is which person,</p>
<p>then you send it to the lab, and you get the results. So no lab tech can ever know. If there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even one positive result, you quarantine everybody. And that&rsquo;s probably the most risk minimizing thing</p>
<p>you can do. So that it&rsquo;s not just the president that gets tested, and then we&rsquo;re not waiting with</p>
<p>bated breath for a positive test. And then the government can can basically manage how they treat</p>
<p>him. Because I think it&rsquo;s highly problematic in the next two or three days, if we found out that</p>
<p>he was positive. And I think it&rsquo;s much more manageable to say there were 50 people tested,</p>
<p>one person was found to be a care or, you know, two or three positive tests and record</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s quarantined. Yeah. So yeah, what are the chances, anonymous chances,</p>
<p>or what if the chances that he has it already, he&rsquo;s been tested, and they&rsquo;re already lying</p>
<p>in the sake and that they&rsquo;re telling us he&rsquo;s getting tested on Friday, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s zero, just because I think he&rsquo;s, he really is like he&rsquo;s, you know, by being</p>
<p>the President of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, the richest person</p>
<p>in the world, and the best taken care of person in the world. And in as much as those, we all</p>
<p>believe in those things, which I think everybody around the world probably does. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really important that he is there, healthy as a sign of strength, quite honestly. But what if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s sick, and he recovers to mop what happens in markets, right? So let&rsquo;s say he he gets declared</p>
<p>to have a Coronavirus markets tank, as you&rsquo;re saying, and I fast forward five days, and he</p>
<p>comes out of it. He&rsquo;s like, yeah, that&rsquo;s tough. But it was like, so I think I think I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more that we will not be told that he is sick, but that he is quarantined for safety on the</p>
<p>presumption that he recovers. That&rsquo;s the smartest thing to do. If I were them, right? Well, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would do. Now, maybe the only because the the thing is, you want him to come out of this</p>
<p>100%. And you want him to be healthy and say, guys, much ado about nothing to your point.</p>
<p>Because if he can say that, I think that a lot of people will calm down. And then,</p>
<p>which by the way, we all need to start talking about, which is the second and third order effects</p>
<p>of literally shutting the world down for what looks like somewhere between three and nine weeks,</p>
<p>if not more. So we can we can get to that task and figure out what&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>The the real corner case scenario is, if his situation degrades, and, you know, Mike Pence</p>
<p>has to become the president. That&rsquo;s a real that&rsquo;s, yeah, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s talk about that. I mean, if,</p>
<p>and this is dark, but I mean, this is the way you have to think about all possibilities. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making strategic decisions, if he gets on a ventilator, what happens? Is it going to just</p>
<p>cause a pure terror and panic stock market collapses? If he dies, God forbid. I know some</p>
<p>people hate him and wish death upon him. I don&rsquo;t I mean, I don&rsquo;t like him. But I don&rsquo;t want to see</p>
<p>the president. Let&rsquo;s be clear. Nobody should die from this. Unfortunately, people will.</p>
<p>I did what happens?</p>
<p>I think that I think the odds of that are incredibly low. So let&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>kind of deal with that. What if a celebrity dies? I mean, I, you know,</p>
<p>we live here in America with the NBA and Tom Hanks with the things that made people finally</p>
<p>pay attention to this. If Tom Hanks or an NBA player dies from this or is put on a ventilator</p>
<p>and almost dies? Well, let me ask the question. Let me ask the question of like, if they die,</p>
<p>and then if they recover in the next week, so as you see, because no one&rsquo;s had these recovery</p>
<p>stories, there have been zero of them out there. Everything is about you&rsquo;re in the hospital,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dying. And you&rsquo;re gonna know, there have been zero here, but there there are tons of them</p>
<p>on WeChat. And so you know, for example, like when you when you look at how the Chinese have</p>
<p>responded, you know, they went from a massive lockdown, to a partial lockdown, to what is being</p>
<p>a graduated decline, and you know, a ramping back up of, of life as they knew it now, in terms of</p>
<p>the top down control measures. I think if in Western culture, we have to deal with a lot of</p>
<p>very visible people dealing with this successfully, I think people will be more lackadaisical than not.</p>
<p>I think if people self quarantine, and then get better, that&rsquo;s the best result. If people get</p>
<p>sick that we all know, and unfortunately, are in a really terrible straits. It&rsquo;s real, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really bad psychologically for folks to have to deal with that is the worst path. Not good. Yeah.</p>
<p>The care, the care of the celebrities is going to obviously be great. And it&rsquo;s very likely that</p>
<p>Tom Hanks and these NBA players who are in fantastic health are gonna, they&rsquo;re low comorbidity,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting great care, and they&rsquo;re going to come out of this thing in the next 10 days.</p>
<p>And you know, when Tom Hanks goes back on Instagram and says like, Hey, look, like I had a</p>
<p>bad cold, that&rsquo;s what it felt like it was like just being knocked out for two days. It just seems to</p>
<p>like create a different story that I think most people, at least in the United States are assuming</p>
<p>which is this thing is just pure death. And we&rsquo;re all going to die from it. We were talking before</p>
<p>about Italy&rsquo;s profile. Iran also had a breakout. Iran is very young. And they seem to be I just</p>
<p>pulled up the Wikipedia page about cigarette consumption per year, and they&rsquo;re right behind</p>
<p>the United States with 936 per year per capita. But on a demographic basis, they&rsquo;re very young</p>
<p>with looks like only 10% of the population, 12% of the population, yeah, 12 or 13% of the</p>
<p>population is over 55. The rest are under 55. Well, maybe David says it&rsquo;s kind of now we may</p>
<p>be we may look back and realize that this is a disease of combinatorics, right? So if you have</p>
<p>a bunch of ands, that&rsquo;s the worst case scenario. So if you are old, and you have comorbidities,</p>
<p>and you have limited critical facilities, and you have a high smoking incidence, and so you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, pulmonary compromise, as well as immunocompromised, and Dan, Dan, Dan,</p>
<p>you have an exponential, you know, unfortunately, decay function.</p>
<p>And ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>And ACE2 receptor, exactly.</p>
<p>So it turns out that so the ACE2 receptor is this protein that shows up on cells.</p>
<p>And it is the point of entry for this virus into cells. And so they have now identified that Asian</p>
<p>men that smoke have a higher production of this ACE2 receptor than other men that smoke that there</p>
<p>may not be a difference between smokers and non smokers and white people. So they&rsquo;re starting to</p>
<p>identify that there may actually be both genetic and behavioral underlyings that can increase the</p>
<p>entry points for this virus on yourselves. And so we don&rsquo;t know yet what as you know,</p>
<p>to mock calls it the combinatorics are we don&rsquo;t know yet like what combination of things is going</p>
<p>to increase the risk factor, there may be something genetically, in the Iranian population,</p>
<p>or in the behavior of the Iranian population, that may increase either the receptors,</p>
<p>or it may increase the the health of the recovery of the lungs, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I have one question. And then I want to move to economics, because I think it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>David, what do we do from here? So that if this type of thing were to happen again,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m speaking specifically about the science, the rapid prototyping,</p>
<p>the figuring out of both the testing, the identification, and then a pathway to drugs,</p>
<p>what do we need to do as a, as a world, frankly, differently than what we&rsquo;ve been doing today,</p>
<p>to make sure that we&rsquo;re better positioned. So there&rsquo;s definitely got to be emergency protocols</p>
<p>that are more clearly defined for these sorts of circumstances in the US to be able to do testing</p>
<p>under CDC guidelines. You have to have a clear lab and you have to have a test certified and</p>
<p>there was all the certification bureaucracy that made it really hard to be a tester for this thing.</p>
<p>So then they had emergency use authorization, or EUA, where you could kind of say, hey,</p>
<p>this test in this lab can be used to figure out what&rsquo;s going on. And that also then turned into</p>
<p>a bureaucratic nightmare where you had to go submit a request for doing emergency use authorization,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth. We&rsquo;ve got to fix that. So it&rsquo;s not so specific to each test in each lab.</p>
<p>And it can be a generalized guideline for this type of test for this type of disease</p>
<p>can be very rapidly prototyped and launched in production. And so you don&rsquo;t have to go through</p>
<p>an approval for every one of the tests under an emergency circumstances like that. The second</p>
<p>thing is we got to get production of these tests in the US. And we shouldn&rsquo;t be limited to PCR</p>
<p>tests. There are new technologies called Sherlock assays that use CRISPR molecules, and you can print</p>
<p>the test on a strip of paper, and it can find DNA or RNA in a segment and light up the strip of paper</p>
<p>and tell you right away if that DNA or RNA is in the sample. And you can do that like on a pregnancy</p>
<p>test, you don&rsquo;t need to ship it to a lab. And so we&rsquo;ve got to get those things approved, we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>to get them standardized, and they can be broadly applied to any viral infection that could start</p>
<p>coming out to the population. And then we&rsquo;ve got to get production for those in the United States,</p>
<p>because right now we&rsquo;re dependent on the Chinese and Koreans to make the tests for us. And then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sitting around waiting. Meanwhile, they&rsquo;re on lockdown, and they want all the tests. And so,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a couple of things to fix here.</p>
<p>What about how the FDA goes through the approval process for candidate</p>
<p>compounds, including and unlimited to sort of the time and the cost and the process for</p>
<p>double blinded studies, and</p>
<p>we treat humans, we treat citizens like idiots. And I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s fair and reasonable</p>
<p>that people shouldn&rsquo;t have the right to decide what they do and don&rsquo;t want to use. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just my personal point of view on this stuff. And we basically act a little bit like a paternal state.</p>
<p>And the you know, going back to my earlier point about kind of what&rsquo;s the philosophy here,</p>
<p>the philosophy is do no harm, it&rsquo;s not to do the most good net of harm. And so when you say a do</p>
<p>no harm, it&rsquo;s like you cannot put a drug out there that might kill people. Even if you might kill,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 2% of people that take it, but 80% of people now double their lifespan, or 80% of people</p>
<p>that otherwise would have died can now live right. So the framing of like the regulatory approach</p>
<p>to drug development and approval is really challenged in the United States, it makes it</p>
<p>hard and expensive for new drugs to get built and launched very quickly, even though we have the</p>
<p>manufacturing and science capacity to do it. And it also makes it really hard because individuals</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have choice. They have to wait for FDA approvals before they can decide whether or not</p>
<p>to take the risk themselves on whether they want to try this drug. remdesivir should be broadly and</p>
<p>widely available right now people shouldn&rsquo;t have to file for compassionate use to get it. They</p>
<p>should be making it printing it should be in every hospital and people can decide whether or not they</p>
<p>want to take the risk. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any mortality associated with taking remdesivir.</p>
<p>So it seems pretty clear cut that most people would raise their hand and say, give me that shit.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s crazy that you have. It reminds me when you say that of</p>
<p>the same patriarchal approach we have to allowing people to invest in private companies,</p>
<p>totally we&rsquo;re trying to protect them from what from placing a bet on investing in a private</p>
<p>Airbnb or LinkedIn or, or something like that. And we have these rules that might be 50 or 100</p>
<p>years old in the case of accreditation laws. I&rsquo;m not sure how, you know, how old these FDA double</p>
<p>blind laws are, but this might be something we need to rethink. And you see with the crypto space</p>
<p>too, where people can experiment with cryptocurrencies, they have to go to, you know,</p>
<p>Switzerland or another geography or location to do that. So when we, when we start thinking about</p>
<p>the economic ramifications, and obviously this is, I think for some people, they might feel</p>
<p>distasteful to start talking about money in the face of a global pandemic. But as you said earlier,</p>
<p>David, people will die because of economic issues as well.</p>
<p>There are more people, let&rsquo;s be clear, more people will die because of the second and third order</p>
<p>effects of coronavirus than these first order effects.</p>
<p>Give us some examples of that. Give us some examples, Shamal, so that people understand</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re saying here.</p>
<p>So, you know, the, the, this is, this is the tragedy that&rsquo;s unfolding before our very eyes</p>
<p>right now. It is the slow motion train wreck. You know, if I go back to 2008 for a second,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just talk, talk a second about that. In 2008, what we really saw was a very, very focused</p>
<p>kind of contagion that was very much lost on most people, except for those that had been the victim</p>
<p>of predatory lending and subprime mortgages who lost their houses. That was terrible.</p>
<p>But the real financial impacts were borne by institutions and their shareholders.</p>
<p>The long-term effects, however, did come back and spill over to Main Street because a lot of people</p>
<p>then as a result had a lot of time, hard time getting really back on their feet and that</p>
<p>economic malaise spread like a pandemic all over the United States.</p>
<p>But the immediate short-term pain was felt by a handful of institutions that for most people</p>
<p>are nameless, faceless organizations run by, you know, to quote Bernie Sanders,</p>
<p>millionaires and billionaires, okay?</p>
<p>One percent of the one percent.</p>
<p>This is completely the opposite. This is Main Street first and foremost. And that kind of impact</p>
<p>in all of our lifetimes, we&rsquo;ve never had to deal with. And it&rsquo;s not going to be the two to three</p>
<p>or four month, you know, eight to 12 week social isolating lockdowns that we are in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of the downstream effects to all kinds of industries, you know, obvious, like the obvious</p>
<p>ones, airlines, cruises, hospitality, retail, and then the non-obvious. So, you know, again,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine that you&rsquo;re a startup and you sell software. Well, you would say to yourself,</p>
<p>I sell enterprise software, so no big deal, nothing happens to me.</p>
<p>Not true, because some of your customers or some of your customers&rsquo; customers are either in those</p>
<p>impacted industries or their customers are those impacted industries. So this is the first time</p>
<p>in a very long time where we&rsquo;re really going to see the domino effect of, you know, economic</p>
<p>contraction, this combination of a supply side shock and a demand shock. And supply side shocks</p>
<p>can be fixed. They can be fixed actually relatively quickly. It&rsquo;s the demand shocks</p>
<p>that are much harder to recover from because they&rsquo;re deeply psychological in nature.</p>
<p>They drive deleveraging. And deleveraging is going to be an important term that folks will hear</p>
<p>over and over over the next nine months. And that process of deleveraging, this multi-trillion</p>
<p>dollar credit bubble that we have to hopefully in a reasonable way, but probably not, it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>violent and messy, unwind, will leave, I think, a lot of people unemployed, a lot of businesses</p>
<p>out of business. Or could, because can&rsquo;t we have some kind of basic intervention here?</p>
<p>I saw today Alamo Draft House as an example, you know, which is a smaller business, a movie</p>
<p>chain that many people love. They were getting sort of dunked on, barbecued, and potentially</p>
<p>canceled on social media because they furloughed their employees for 30 days. They&rsquo;re hourly</p>
<p>employees. So now these hourly employees, basically furlough means we&rsquo;re not paying you anything and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re shutting down. So now can&rsquo;t Trump or anybody just give people a stipend or something? And this</p>
<p>might be the UBI tax we&rsquo;re waiting for? Sure. Well, how? I mean, for example, there are millions</p>
<p>and millions and millions of small businesses. What are we going to do? We&rsquo;re going to have them</p>
<p>go to a website, fill out a form, and all of a sudden, what? You get as much money as you want.</p>
<p>You somehow prove what your monthly burnout is. No, you basically could just say, here&rsquo;s my last</p>
<p>three paychecks, and we give you four paychecks. I mean, you go to that paperwork and apply for it.</p>
<p>The easiest way is going to be a tax refund as a percentage of your taxes paid over the last three.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be something like rebate. But I think these kinds of surpluses, guys, don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>the trick. I think that, for example, if you are all of a sudden in receipt of, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>a year&rsquo;s worth of your average three-year taxes over the last&hellip; I bet you you put it in a savings</p>
<p>account and you don&rsquo;t do anything with it. You&rsquo;re not going to go to Alamo. You&rsquo;re not going to go</p>
<p>to Alamo Drafthouse. Now, let&rsquo;s look at Alamo. Alamo Drafthouse, more than likely, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing, rents their retail footprint. Right. Sure.</p>
<p>And there is a REIT, or there&rsquo;s an MLP, or there&rsquo;s a landlord that owns that retail</p>
<p>real estate footprint. That person has probably bought that building at 80% loan to value at a</p>
<p>4% capital. The math doesn&rsquo;t matter except to say that you are not in a position to forgive</p>
<p>four, five, six, seven months of rent. You&rsquo;re not in a position. The banks will foreclose in default.</p>
<p>And so you will demand that money of Alamo. Alamo will then first deplete their savings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be very difficult for them to tap the debt markets and get a loan unless they get it from the</p>
<p>government, and hopefully they can. But those are the knock-on effects that are going to happen</p>
<p>right now. We have to see the first of those dominoes fall and follow that trail of breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s in that devastation where addiction goes up, where all of the sort of</p>
<p>things that we&rsquo;ve seen in the last 10 years, we have seen it right in front of our eyes what the</p>
<p>impact is when we lack a social safety net, where we don&rsquo;t take care of the poorest men and women</p>
<p>beside us. And then we have a financial shock to the system. We already know how bad it is.</p>
<p>Sorry, when the impacts were just with a few companies. And now, you&rsquo;re going to expand it</p>
<p>industry by industry. No, I totally agree. I mean, we saw it in the rural markets in the 30s.</p>
<p>And we saw it in the Rust Belt in the last 20 years. The statistic today is that 48% of all</p>
<p>US employees work for a business that&rsquo;s got 10 or fewer employees. Now, these businesses are not</p>
<p>only retail, it&rsquo;s also the plumber, the gardener, the housekeeper, any local service provider in</p>
<p>any one of these markets. And in this market, we&rsquo;re not having folks come out and do local</p>
<p>services. We&rsquo;re not going to the local hair salon. We&rsquo;re not going to the local coffee shop.</p>
<p>All of those people are typically living on two to four weeks of cash flow.</p>
<p>63% of Americans have less than $500 of savings, and a huge percentage of them and another 10%</p>
<p>of Americans work in either the energy sector or as retail workers, in addition to that small</p>
<p>business market. So we&rsquo;re talking about nearly 60% of American employees being exposed to the</p>
<p>fallout from shutting down business for anywhere from two to six weeks or two to nine weeks,</p>
<p>whatever the number is. And most of them only have two to three weeks maximum of cash flow or bills</p>
<p>owed in their bank accounts. Travel is an $8.8 trillion, $9 trillion part of the economy of the</p>
<p>world. So 10% of world GDP or actually more. And two quarter shock is basically $4 to $5 trillion.</p>
<p>Right. The implications of that rippling through every economy in every country,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think has been really internalized. And this is where we need massive coordination at</p>
<p>the federal level across the world. This is where the presidents and the prime ministers</p>
<p>of the most important countries need to come together now, decide on a global stimulus package</p>
<p>and make sure that they drown the markets with confidence that they will be there.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, when you see drawdowns like this in the stock market,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had this conversation in our group chat, the bottom isn&rsquo;t put in 20 days into a drawdown like</p>
<p>this. It doesn&rsquo;t happen on day 20. We are in day 20. Monday will be day 21 or 22. So the bottom</p>
<p>comes in somewhere between day 200 and day 250. What that means is that September to October.</p>
<p>And what typically happens is we react in a partisan way. So check the box so far. We do</p>
<p>half measures. Check the box so far. Then we correct on the first order problem. Let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>say we&rsquo;ve done that now. And now we have to start the economic rationalization of these impacts,</p>
<p>trace them all, and then start to fix them. And if it&rsquo;s anything like 2008,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to dribble out in phases, which means that the real damage won&rsquo;t really be understood</p>
<p>for another quarter or two after people print the quarter, and after people guide. And when</p>
<p>these public companies do that, the stock market and investors by and large will realize, wow,</p>
<p>this is a much bigger problem than 2008. And if that plays out&hellip;</p>
<p>You think this is a bigger problem than 2008?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah. David, do you agree?</p>
<p>I agree. By the way, on Chamath&rsquo;s point, I pulled up these stats and I put them in your document,</p>
<p>Jason. But 1987, peak to trough took 14 weeks. The dot-com bubble bursting took 25 months.</p>
<p>2008 took five months. And we&rsquo;re only, as Chamath said, less than a month into this one.</p>
<p>1987, we saw 33% retracement. 2000, we saw 47%. 2008, we saw 56%. And we&rsquo;re only 20% into this</p>
<p>one. And by the way, another way to think about retracement is not a percentage loss, because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had a massive bull market here for the last couple of years. But it&rsquo;s how many months did you</p>
<p>retrace back in terms of the S&amp;P? In 87, we traced back 23 months. In 2000, we traced back five and</p>
<p>a quarter years. In 2008, we traced back 12 and a half years. And so far, we&rsquo;ve only traced back</p>
<p>13 months to the S&amp;P where it was 13 months ago. The other thing you guys have to keep in mind is</p>
<p>the thing that is very different. So it&rsquo;s not as if everything is going to be the same. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be a repeat of the dot-com bubble or 2000. But they&rsquo;re similar and they rhyme.</p>
<p>But the differences are important. The difference this time around is that we have gone through a</p>
<p>multi-year period of incredibly low volatility. And in that period of low volatility, two things</p>
<p>have happened. The first is that we have had public market financial capital market participants</p>
<p>get absolutely levered up. So I&rsquo;ll explain what that is in a minute. And the second is the emergence</p>
<p>of computers and quant funds and algorithmic trading. So on the first side, let&rsquo;s just say</p>
<p>David and I ran a hedge fund, Jason, and we took money from you. And we&rsquo;d say, Jason, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to give you 10%. And you&rsquo;re like, that sounds like a good deal. Bonds are at zero. Here&rsquo;s my money.</p>
<p>Now, David and I would look at ourselves and say, well, we would love to stay in business forever.</p>
<p>And we want to collect 2% off of Jason&rsquo;s money. So let&rsquo;s try to do this in the most conservative</p>
<p>way possible. We&rsquo;re going to try to get 1% a year. Can we make 1% a year? David and I look at each</p>
<p>other and we say, yeah, we can make 1% a year. How do we do it? Well, let&rsquo;s break it down. Divide it</p>
<p>by 12. OK, we&rsquo;ve got to get 82, 83 basis points every month. OK, we can do that. We can make 80</p>
<p>basis points a month. Or sorry, 8 basis points a month. Sorry, whatever the math is, 8.5 basis</p>
<p>points a month. And so let&rsquo;s say we figure out a way, being really conservative, we make 8.5 basis</p>
<p>points, 1% a year. Well, eventually, we look at each other and say, OK, well, we need to multiply</p>
<p>this by 10. I got it. I&rsquo;m going to go to my prime broker, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,</p>
<p>and say, guys, I want you to lend me 10 times on my money.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, whoa, whoa, whoa, big boy, hold it up. And I&rsquo;ll say, listen,</p>
<p>look at the volatility. There&rsquo;s no volatility. This is a really safe thing to do. For every</p>
<p>dollar I put up, you give me 10. And now everything that I was doing is multiplied by 10.</p>
<p>My 1% a month becomes the 10% a year. Voila, I look like a genius to you. In reality,</p>
<p>David and I are making 1% a year multiplied by 10 turns of leverage. OK? Every hedge fund runs</p>
<p>this way. Now, when volatility goes from 0 to 50 to 60 to 70 in a matter of days, which is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened now, the banks, who are not stupid, say, hold on a second. You owe me money.</p>
<p>You need to post more money if you want me to continue to give you this kind of leverage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much volatility. I cannot guarantee that Amazon is worth 50% of what you say. I have</p>
<p>to assume Amazon is worth 20% of what you say. So I can&rsquo;t use Amazon stock as collateral. I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>use these 10-year bonds as collateral. I can&rsquo;t use whatever you&rsquo;re giving me as collateral. You</p>
<p>need to post more money. And then what happens is I have to delever. I make margin calls. I have to</p>
<p>delever. I sell my safe assets. I sell gold. I sell all these things, which is what&rsquo;s been happening</p>
<p>now. So that&rsquo;s number one. The second, which is why you see all of this massive volatility,</p>
<p>and it kind of builds on top of itself, is you have these algorithmic quant funds</p>
<p>that just see price signals and then they act. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a good day. It doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter if it&rsquo;s a bad day. They know that the next tick is going to be up if the last tick was up</p>
<p>or down if the last tick was down. And when you have hundreds of participants putting in billions</p>
<p>of dollars multiplied by that leverage, so hundreds of billions, you get these tsunami effects where</p>
<p>one day you&rsquo;re down 10% and then the next day you snap back 9%. Because even if there are a few</p>
<p>individuals making idiosyncratic human-led decisions, all of a sudden it&rsquo;s drowned out</p>
<p>by the computers and the leverage. That&rsquo;s a really big difference that exists today that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really exist or didn&rsquo;t exist in the last times. And so we&rsquo;re going to be in a very violent,</p>
<p>thrashy environment as we delever, right? As we figure out which credit funds are upside down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s about $75 billion of debt across the top seven or eight petroleum companies that comes due</p>
<p>over the next few years. And the average price for a barrel of oil needs to be $50 for them to not be</p>
<p>upside down. It&rsquo;s $30 and falling. Some of these guys like Oxy Petroleum needs oil to be at $80</p>
<p>a barrel for them to make their debt payments. So we&rsquo;re going to start a very awkward period</p>
<p>of deleveraging and a very long period where we&rsquo;re going to have stresses and shocks that are not</p>
<p>industry-specific. It&rsquo;s not just going to be Lehman and Bayer. It&rsquo;s going to be brand name</p>
<p>companies that many people that are listening to this know and understand who are put under</p>
<p>financial pressure, who cannot make their interest payments, who default on debt, who miss their</p>
<p>earnings. And so this is an environment where cash becomes king and an incredibly clean balance</p>
<p>sheet becomes the single most important thing that you can have. So the Googles, Apples,</p>
<p>Amazons of the world are sitting on tons of cash, Microsoft&rsquo;s. I mean, they&rsquo;re just going to go on</p>
<p>an M&amp;A spree, you think, or they&rsquo;re just going to sit tight? Well, the anger that&rsquo;ll turn on to those</p>
<p>five companies is going to be incredible because you talk about a trillion dollars of cash,</p>
<p>a trillion dollars plus with five companies, they represent 20% of the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>And, you know, the only thing that hasn&rsquo;t really sold off yet are those five big names. They&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>come off a lot, but not nearly as much as the rest of the market. If and when those things break,</p>
<p>not because of their balance sheet or of debt issues, but just because of how risk-off everybody</p>
<p>is in the broader market, you&rsquo;re going to look at those companies and they&rsquo;re going to get in a</p>
<p>really difficult situation. You could have forced repatriations where the US government says,</p>
<p>sorry guys, the money has to come back and I&rsquo;m going to tax it. And, you know, all these things</p>
<p>people say will never happen, but there are these moments in time where you just can never say never.</p>
<p>And I would say to all of us, this is a moment where your presumptions of normalcy need to get</p>
<p>paused. Yeah. Well, and we&rsquo;ve had these moments before with 9-11, the financial crisis, great</p>
<p>recession, and the dot-com bust. David, what are the chances, percentage-wise, that this results in</p>
<p>a very quick resolution? So quick resolution being defined as, hey, we quarantined for a month.</p>
<p>Turns out America is similar to countries that don&rsquo;t seem to be impacted by it. And we&rsquo;re back</p>
<p>to business as usual in the third quarter, fourth quarter. Look, I think the chances that this</p>
<p>resolves in a month and we&rsquo;re all, and, you know, we hit that, I&rsquo;m actually just looking at today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>reported numbers and it looks like hopefully we end up at the same number of new cases as yesterday,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll see by midnight. But, you know, hopefully that starts to happen. People recover.</p>
<p>Again, I pray that we get these IgG tests out there so that we can show that there were 10</p>
<p>times or hopefully some large number of people that were asymptomatic that had this thing,</p>
<p>not from showing it that it&rsquo;s going to cause more contagion, but that, you know, the general</p>
<p>case of this or the, you know, the average case of this or the 99th percentile case of this is</p>
<p>relatively mild and people calm down. But I do think it&rsquo;s nonlinear in terms of that second</p>
<p>order and third order effects that we&rsquo;ve been talking about. Even if we got back to business</p>
<p>as usual in a month, we don&rsquo;t yet know how losing two to four weeks of cash flow is going to affect</p>
<p>every salon in every major city, every local restaurant, every local movie theater, every</p>
<p>local plumber, all these businesses that have had their revenue literally turn to zero in the last</p>
<p>two to four weeks. If they only have two weeks of cash, they&rsquo;re bankrupt. If they have six weeks</p>
<p>of cash, they&rsquo;re reducing their investments this year. If they have eight weeks of cash,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably cutting a couple of people from their payroll. So we won&rsquo;t know for a couple of</p>
<p>months going back to this point about, hey, we&rsquo;re talking about Q3 when this all finally kind of</p>
<p>comes to bear what the shutdown that we&rsquo;re in right now and are going to continue to be in</p>
<p>probably for another two to four weeks is going to do. And we&rsquo;re going to find that out over the</p>
<p>next couple of months. But it&rsquo;s going to be ugly. And so I&rsquo;m not feeling like very confident that</p>
<p>in four weeks we&rsquo;re going to say, hey, guys, we&rsquo;re out of the woods unless the federal government</p>
<p>shows up with a three trillion dollar loan package that any small business can access</p>
<p>and any unemployed person can access. And it really fills the gap. And then you&rsquo;re effectively</p>
<p>talking about one year of a Bernie Sanders tax hike anyway. So it&rsquo;s like, hey, it doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>make that much of a difference. Look, it&rsquo;s 20 percent of GDP that we&rsquo;re giving away for one</p>
<p>year to keep the economy from completely collapsing. And I think that&rsquo;s where we have to end</p>
<p>up. But until we get that package and we know how big it is and we really know that it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>fill the hole, we don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re driving off a cliff or not. It is 100 percent. Yeah,</p>
<p>100 percent certainty that Trump will do something like this because he wants to</p>
<p>save his presidency, correct, Jamal? It&rsquo;s the only chance he has. I think the problem is that</p>
<p>the Republicans and the Democrats are playing political chicken with each other. And this</p>
<p>happened during TARP. It was a trickle, trickle, trickle, trickle, trickle.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s going to happen here. You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to get on the same page and</p>
<p>realize, gosh, we&rsquo;re all going to lose in this case? Or do you think the Democrats have</p>
<p>a reason to let Trump fail and let the economy fail so they have a clearer path to victory?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. Because then I think Trump should get reelected because they have</p>
<p>a bigger responsibility to the people than blockading the president of the United States.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculous. I think the reality is that we are woefully underestimating the second and</p>
<p>third order effects. And so, we started with an $8 billion package. This last package, I think,</p>
<p>when we put the numbers together, will probably be an order of magnitude bigger. Okay, whatever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll wait a few months and then we&rsquo;ll have a couple hundred billion dollars. It&rsquo;ll be kind</p>
<p>of TARP-like. It&rsquo;ll probably be a bailout of a couple of specific industries.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t bail out every industry. And the ultimate package probably needs to be</p>
<p>on the order of a year to a year and a half of world GDP spread across all the major countries</p>
<p>of the world. And so, for the developing countries, the mechanism is probably the</p>
<p>IMF and the World Bank, but we need somebody real in there doing it. Not these kind of like</p>
<p>career bureaucrat dipshits that are in there now. So, get somebody like Bloomberg. Maybe he</p>
<p>steps in and he can allocate the money. And then the G8 or the G20 basically then put 75% of the</p>
<p>dollars into their economies. Germany has to basically go into deficit big time. They can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>kind of run this austerity campaign. So, there&rsquo;s a lot of big decisions, Jason, that need to happen.</p>
<p>These things can&rsquo;t happen in days nor weeks. And they&rsquo;re precipitated on data and political</p>
<p>pressure. And that takes sort of weeks to months to build. So, I kind of think we&rsquo;re in a kind of</p>
<p>wait and see mode here where there will be these relief rallies because people, I mean, look,</p>
<p>legitimately, we all don&rsquo;t want to be living through this nightmare. And so, every chance</p>
<p>people get to buy as a signal that this is over, they will take, like they did in 08.</p>
<p>But eventually, the news just kind of is you can&rsquo;t overlook it. And you can&rsquo;t take the ostrich</p>
<p>strategy of managing a business. So, you know, like I&rsquo;ve had a company already who did a deal</p>
<p>yesterday at two times forward ARR. Two times. This is a company that will do 35 million of</p>
<p>revenue. 35 million of revenue. Now, you could say, hey, that&rsquo;s crazy. Like we&rsquo;re a startup. Like,</p>
<p>you know, we are funded by the best of this tier one, tier two venture capital.</p>
<p>And honestly, my reaction is shut the fuck up and go fuck yourself. You are going out of business.</p>
<p>And that was the market clearing price. But that CEO did right by his team. And history will look</p>
<p>favorably on that guy. Because like Buffett said, in moments like this, and in your life,</p>
<p>in business anyways, but I guess also in life, the most important thing is to not go out of</p>
<p>business. It&rsquo;s to survive. Yeah, I mean, I was explaining it to my founders in our group slack</p>
<p>room. And I said, listen, job number one, if you take the scene as a captain is you got to keep the</p>
<p>plane in the air. You know, you got to find a place to land the plane. And you need to know</p>
<p>your altitude. And that&rsquo;s your runway. And you know, you can&rsquo;t get it in the bank.</p>
<p>Look, I think in this way, startup CEOs are the greatest canary in the coal mine, because,</p>
<p>you know, they are the ones that are the most resistant to these implications. They love the</p>
<p>halcyon days of the Cinderella ball. They love it. The clock never strikes midnight. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never running down the stairs leaving the glass zipler. You know, that&rsquo;s what makes them great.</p>
<p>In many ways, they live beyond what their station in life is. And hopefully they make it.</p>
<p>But in moments like this, you really have to realize that the that the shock clock is on.</p>
<p>And it has nothing to do with you. And if you are losing money, and your opex is high,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have 24 to 36 months of cash, you have to really figure out how to get that money,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s going to get harder, not easier. I give you a simple example.</p>
<p>You know, I, I was thinking about like all these companies in the next few years that have plans</p>
<p>to go public. They have options that have to invest, you know, they have RSUs that will expire,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read about Airbnb. You know, these are really complicated examples of companies that are great</p>
<p>companies with unbelievable employees, who deserve a hard to be rewarded for the hard work that they</p>
<p>put in. And now you&rsquo;re faced with the situation where you&rsquo;re money losing, burning cash, you know,</p>
<p>options about to expire. I mean, people have to really go public. I mean, this is why Bill Gurley</p>
<p>was sounding an alarm what three or four years ago saying, Listen, if the windows open to go</p>
<p>public, get out and, you know, clean up the balance sheet. Yeah, I mean, the IPO, I, you know,</p>
<p>my last year, last year, I wrote this in my letter, like last year, I took a lot of heat from</p>
<p>some folks around me, because I focused on liquidity. You know, I generated one, I put 1.7</p>
<p>billion on the balance sheet last year. And I just remember like people like you&rsquo;re an idiot to sell,</p>
<p>why are you selling at these prices? And I said, Honestly, I&rsquo;ve been through the dot com bubble,</p>
<p>I went through that it took me 13 years to get even from 99 to 2012. Well, 13 years.</p>
<p>I went through oh, wait, but it wasn&rsquo;t so bad, because I was mostly head down working at Facebook</p>
<p>at the time. And I just thought, after 10 years of building something, I don&rsquo;t want to have all</p>
<p>my chips on the table anymore. And what I want to be in a position is to be a good steady source of</p>
<p>capital in moments like this, you know, call it a white knight, call it whatever. But now, you know,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m telling everybody is put out the word. I have billions of dollars in a balance sheet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to put it to work. I want to work with founders who are sober and realizing how</p>
<p>important this moment is for their company. But there&rsquo;s going to be an incredible number</p>
<p>of businesses that have to act. And they&rsquo;re not going to act for the next two to three quarters,</p>
<p>I get it. But they like the government, like the stock market, like everybody else will capitulate.</p>
<p>Yeah. And hopefully, when they do it, the money is there.</p>
<p>David, how are you approaching the next year? When you look at yourself doing, you know,</p>
<p>building startups? I mean, obviously, you know, as I sell people, you know, fortunes are made in</p>
<p>the Dow market, they&rsquo;re just collected in the up market, as Chamath just pointed out, as well.</p>
<p>How do you look at the next year and then going into this next decade as a founder?</p>
<p>So yeah, we build businesses, and then we eventually bring in outside investors into</p>
<p>those businesses. So we are eventually going to be looking to capital markets to help fund our</p>
<p>projects. And so we put money off our balance sheet into starting these businesses, and we</p>
<p>fund them during that initial phase. So the first thing we&rsquo;ve kind of talked to folks about is like,</p>
<p>you know, don&rsquo;t optimize for time, optimize for survivability. Now. I&rsquo;ve had one VC text me</p>
<p>earlier this week and say, we&rsquo;re all leaving the office. And this was a VC who had given us a</p>
<p>offer to invest in one of our companies, yank the offer this week, and said he&rsquo;s going to go,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re shutting up shop, no one&rsquo;s going to be in the office, they&rsquo;re not doing any deals until</p>
<p>things kind of come back, whatever that means. And then I&rsquo;ve seen another venture firm, which</p>
<p>is a much larger firm, say it&rsquo;s business as usual, we don&rsquo;t care about up markets, down markets,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still investing, valuations will shift, hopefully, and you know, the markets are going</p>
<p>to shift what we&rsquo;re going to invest in, but we&rsquo;re still here and we&rsquo;re still doing business.</p>
<p>So I think the first thing is, is, you know, for the right businesses, there&rsquo;s always capital. I</p>
<p>mean, I built my company, I raised my Series A in November of 2017, sorry, 2007. And then 2008</p>
<p>happened. And I&rsquo;m really glad I raised more money than I wanted to for my Series A, we made it</p>
<p>through that period, we built a business. And then by 2011, we had such a great business, we raised</p>
<p>a nice Series B, and then a Series C a year later, and then we sold. So it was an incredible run,</p>
<p>but we went through that period of building. And it was, you know, it was great that we had the</p>
<p>cash for the businesses that don&rsquo;t have the cash I&rsquo;m worried about, like, you know, are we gonna</p>
<p>have to put money off our balance sheet to help fund them? Because it seems like there&rsquo;s less of</p>
<p>these convertible notes and safes and people interested in bridging stuff. And, you know,</p>
<p>all the stuff that was a little bit, you know, I&rsquo;ll like, like Chamath was saying earlier,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take more volatility right now, or I&rsquo;ll take more risk because the ball is low, it&rsquo;s very likely</p>
<p>that everything ends up raising their next round. Now we&rsquo;re talking about probably 60% of things</p>
<p>are not going to make it to their next round. So I&rsquo;m going to take less fall and that has</p>
<p>a kind of exponential effect in terms of accessing capital. So we&rsquo;re telling everyone cut costs,</p>
<p>make sure that you manage for survival, do not manage for optimization on time.</p>
<p>Traditionally, we&rsquo;ve kind of been aggressive and said, try and get as much done in six months as</p>
<p>you can and hit these big milestones as quickly as possible. Now we&rsquo;re saying, you know what,</p>
<p>take your time to hit the milestones, just make sure you de-risk a little bit, even if it takes</p>
<p>two years instead of six months, as long as we have enough cash to survive two years.</p>
<p>As soon as we get out of this, you know, we&rsquo;ll be fine. But that&rsquo;s kind of where we are.</p>
<p>Sounds like wise advice. Chances, Chamath, as we wrap up here, we&rsquo;re 80 minutes into the first</p>
<p>episode zero of the all in podcast emergency pod here talking about coronavirus with David</p>
<p>Friedberg and Chamath Palihapitiya. Chamath, chances right now that this is</p>
<p>resolved in a couple of months and we get back to business as usual,</p>
<p>where would you set the percentage chance at? Zero. If you, I think we deal with the</p>
<p>first order effects of the disease in eight to 12 weeks. So, you know, probably by May,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have a decent handle on the impacts and we&rsquo;ll be through most of the worst of it.</p>
<p>And I think the economic bottom is probably Q3, Q4. And I think that, you know, we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to touch 2000 on the S&amp;P, if not lower. I hope we don&rsquo;t, but I think we are.</p>
<p>And I would just encourage everybody to start internalizing the second and third order effects.</p>
<p>We are the world, as of now is shut down for two months. The world. And, you know,</p>
<p>much like an old car, you can turn it off fast, but sometimes when you turn it off.</p>
<p>Yeah, it sputters. You have to open the hood and take a look under there, maybe clear out some.</p>
<p>It takes a while. It takes a while. You know, travel, by the way, you know, it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>anecdote. Whenever there&rsquo;s a demand shock in travel, I like travel, by the way, just because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good, another canary in the coal mine for so many industries that are interconnected</p>
<p>and highly dependent on each other. When there&rsquo;s a demand shock, it typically takes 19 months for</p>
<p>it to recover. One, nine months. So, almost two years. So, Dave, it&rsquo;s right. I really, really</p>
<p>encourage folks to batten down the hatches, keep, you know, enough dry powder so that you can</p>
<p>withstand what can happen in two years and stop worrying about valuation. Find good capital</p>
<p>partners in moments of distress like this who can be, you know, fast and decisive and in size</p>
<p>and try to get back to work and keep your, keep the people that work for you safe.</p>
<p>Yeah. And if you&rsquo;re worried about civil unrest, riots, breakdown of society, that&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>people have been hypothesizing about. No, no. And they always put it on like that. The internet</p>
<p>people are the ones who are most paranoid about this because Peter Thiel and whoever bought some</p>
<p>New Zealand real estate. There&rsquo;s a lot of us that fucking scratched our whole lives to get</p>
<p>to the United States. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s who we are. Yeah. I wouldn&rsquo;t have come if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who we were. Do you think there&rsquo;s any chance of a civil unrest at this like sort of society</p>
<p>breakdown kind of issue? Yeah. We&rsquo;re an incredible country. I mean, you can read Buffett&rsquo;s letters</p>
<p>and he talks about with a great perspective of the last, you know, what we&rsquo;ve built in this country</p>
<p>over the last 200 years. I mean, the economy, the infrastructure, the food availability,</p>
<p>the health availability, the housing availability, government&rsquo;s challenged, but it&rsquo;s not as challenged</p>
<p>as elsewhere in the world. I don&rsquo;t think in the United States where, you know, it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a shitty time for people with capital. It&rsquo;s going to be a shitty time for people with retail jobs</p>
<p>and hourly jobs and so on. The government&rsquo;s going to be there to help them. But I don&rsquo;t see this</p>
<p>government failing the people no matter who&rsquo;s in charge. I just don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re set up that way.</p>
<p>Other countries have different models. I think there&rsquo;s other places where that may happen,</p>
<p>but not here. 100%. 100%. All right. Listen, this has been a great episode zero emergency podcast</p>
<p>for the All In podcast. Thank you to my co-host Chamath Palihapitiya for pushing us to do this</p>
<p>podcast and David Friedberg, Continued Success Building Companies. And we&rsquo;ll see you all next</p>
<p>time. Bye-bye. Love you, boys. Thanks for doing it, Friedbergers. When do you think the next</p>
<p>poker, when can we all get tested and play a game of cards? God, please, Friedberg, give us</p>
<p>some tests so that we can just get together. I&rsquo;m losing so much money in every other part of my</p>
<p>life. Why not lose money at the poker table too? Can we do a Zoom set up like this later and then</p>
<p>all get on the same poker stars table? When do we do that? Yeah. I think we just have to get</p>
<p>something going here. Because we can do a play poker stars table and just play PLO.</p>
<p>The play for a dollar. Let&rsquo;s do it. Let&rsquo;s do it. Let&rsquo;s get on poker stars. All right,</p>
<p>everybody. See you next time. Bye-bye.</p>
