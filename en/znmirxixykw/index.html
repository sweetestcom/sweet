<p>answered good we&rsquo;re going to get rob</p>
<p>from detroit to come up with the first</p>
<p>question of the day</p>
<p>rob you&rsquo;re on the air hey dr berg thank</p>
<p>you so much for having me</p>
<p>so i i&rsquo;ve been doing keto for about four</p>
<p>months now</p>
<p>and one of my uh bigger problems is i</p>
<p>i pretty much own every one of your</p>
<p>supplements and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m scared of supplements in some</p>
<p>instances so i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily take them as directed</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>what is what are the too many</p>
<p>supplements can i do too many</p>
<p>supplements because they&rsquo;re food grade</p>
<p>should i be taking the mass directed i</p>
<p>mean i do the keto energy</p>
<p>the nutritional yeast the adrenal</p>
<p>support um</p>
<p>and some some days even though i feel so</p>
<p>much better than</p>
<p>i used to i still have down days</p>
<p>and entire days and um old</p>
<p>me days before keto and you know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost about 70 pounds</p>
<p>and i think i&rsquo;m just looking for that</p>
<p>validation that</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;m doing okay and if i keep going</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna eventually feel better</p>
<p>and be how much supplements is too much</p>
<p>supplements</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pack question but let me just</p>
<p>dive right in there</p>
<p>yeah so with the supplements that i have</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do too many because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>food based</p>
<p>concentrates so there you could do too</p>
<p>many if you&rsquo;re doing synthetics or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>notropics which are affect the your</p>
<p>mental state which i don&rsquo;t have any of</p>
<p>those</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not going to have to worry</p>
<p>about overdoing it</p>
<p>i think one thing that&rsquo;s beneficial is</p>
<p>to is just to start learning more about</p>
<p>those products what they do how they</p>
<p>affect you and</p>
<p>to see um see if certain things are</p>
<p>being addressed</p>
<p>maybe some of the ones you can kind of</p>
<p>phase out of once you understand what</p>
<p>they do</p>
<p>more but you&rsquo;re but you have a good</p>
<p>point because</p>
<p>as someone progresses when they start to</p>
<p>go on keto</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s a bit of a bit of a you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel better but then there&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be ups and downs ups and downs ups and</p>
<p>downs as you get better</p>
<p>um that is normal that&rsquo;s natural um</p>
<p>i always tend to really pay attention to</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;m not feeling right today when</p>
<p>did that hap when did it start what what</p>
<p>did i do right before that because you</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>other things you have the quality of</p>
<p>sleep you have the people you hang</p>
<p>around with you have stress</p>
<p>you have something you just ate that you</p>
<p>normally don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>and then you learn from that like okay</p>
<p>good i won&rsquo;t do that again</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s also something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to kind of</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m not recommending a cheat</p>
<p>day but sometimes it takes someone to go</p>
<p>off the program occasionally just to see</p>
<p>how they feel to</p>
<p>be convinced yeah that doesn&rsquo;t work i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to do that again</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s other people that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn from their mistakes they tend to</p>
<p>keep</p>
<p>doing the same thing over and over and</p>
<p>over and over and um</p>
<p>keep getting bloated and then when i</p>
<p>talk to them</p>
<p>i bring this up to like oh that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>maybe i should</p>
<p>not eat that because every time i eat</p>
<p>that that bloats me so i would just um</p>
<p>learn from what you what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and then keep improving and tweaking it</p>
<p>as you</p>
<p>get to the point where you get your body</p>
<p>into a power state which</p>
<p>a temporary going off the program will</p>
<p>not even affect you you feel</p>
<p>great all the time and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>implementing</p>
<p>more and more things that increases your</p>
<p>long-term survival</p>
<p>yeah uh thank you i just had my</p>
<p>gallbladder removed three weeks ago</p>
<p>i had emergency gallbladder surgery it</p>
<p>was i guess</p>
<p>like within four hours it grew so big it</p>
<p>was popping on my abdominal wall</p>
<p>wow and uh when i was 25 i&rsquo;m 39 now i</p>
<p>was diagnosed with</p>
<p>too many stones and they said i could</p>
<p>take it out but i was like i want to</p>
<p>keep it it&rsquo;s not bugging me</p>
<p>unfortunately it started bugging me so i</p>
<p>did get your gallbladder formula</p>
<p>and you know i&rsquo;ve noticed like mct oil</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>impact my stomach anymore i used to have</p>
<p>problems with it</p>
<p>i feel like i&rsquo;m better now that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gone but i&rsquo;m kind of wondering</p>
<p>um should i take those supplements now</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um you know do you think my keto</p>
<p>lifestyle is gonna change</p>
<p>because of it so you just have to pay</p>
<p>attention to</p>
<p>um being deficient in bile</p>
<p>maybe down the road because what happens</p>
<p>you no longer have a storage</p>
<p>of bile so what does that mean it means</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re not going to be able to</p>
<p>have this concentrated bile</p>
<p>so now we have a diluted bile so now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re susceptible to not</p>
<p>getting the full benefit from omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids</p>
<p>uh vitamin a vitamin d vitamin e vitamin</p>
<p>k</p>
<p>k right k1 k2</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the gallbladder formula is</p>
<p>beneficial but then the question is how</p>
<p>do you know if you&rsquo;re taking too much</p>
<p>diarrhea if you have diarrhea you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking too much you back off</p>
<p>and then you can kind of use that as a</p>
<p>monitoring to see if you need</p>
<p>more or less let&rsquo;s see you get</p>
<p>constipation wow i need more bile</p>
<p>that bile is going to help your thyroid</p>
<p>work better because it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>convert t4 to t3</p>
<p>but yeah you can live a perfectly normal</p>
<p>life just</p>
<p>you know just keep replacing that bile</p>
<p>over time and</p>
<p>if you start to be driving at night in</p>
<p>the dark and notice that your vision is</p>
<p>really poor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a vitamin a deficiency like up i</p>
<p>need some more</p>
<p>bile not vitamin a but more bile to help</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>pull in that fat soluble vitamin so just</p>
<p>watch all my videos on that i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get more</p>
<p>more help on that i&rsquo;ve watched a ton on</p>
<p>it thank you so much</p>
<p>my last thing is just a quick statement</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never done a video on like how an</p>
<p>ssri like a anti-anxiety pill will</p>
<p>impact our bodies and i i&rsquo;ve been trying</p>
<p>to get off of them</p>
<p>um because keto has made me feel like i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need them anymore</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re so hard to get off of and i</p>
<p>was just wondering if you could</p>
<p>ever in the future do something that</p>
<p>shows this is what it does to our bodies</p>
<p>you know that is a great tip for me</p>
<p>thank you because i</p>
<p>was just wondering what am i going to do</p>
<p>a video on next week and i&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>it on that</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a great idea thank you so much</p>
<p>yeah sure okay well that was great</p>
<p>by the way doc speaking of supplements</p>
<p>and vitamins and all that</p>
<p>kathy on youtube writes in that her</p>
<p>synthetic vitamins</p>
<p>uh feel like rocks in her stomach she</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t handle it</p>
<p>my lay approach would be well quit</p>
<p>taking them what do you say doc</p>
<p>i was the guy that was taking the the</p>
<p>one a days and</p>
<p>not even thinking that they weren&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>same as any other vitamin they were</p>
<p>inexpensive in college i would not</p>
<p>take these and then later on i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually learned that</p>
<p>the main ingredient is calcium carbonate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a rock so i was eating rocks</p>
<p>with some chemicals very very um</p>
<p>cheap ingredients</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t work the same as whole food</p>
<p>so i i think i would um lean on the area</p>
<p>of not</p>
<p>taking those and getting more of a a</p>
<p>real vitamin</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just my opinion well i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh you&rsquo;re yeah</p>
<p>literally rocks well she&rsquo;s on to</p>
<p>something and it&rsquo;s great you know you</p>
<p>can use it as a paperweight because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re very heavy so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>great benefit</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s terrific well listen why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we say hello to the world and by</p>
<p>the way</p>
<p>later on we&rsquo;ve got kelvin coming for the</p>
<p>uk so we&rsquo;ve already got somebody online</p>
<p>in the green room</p>
<p>from uk and for the rest of the world</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to give a shout out to</p>
<p>canada</p>
<p>malaysia sweden singapore mongolia</p>
<p>zambia been there</p>
<p>france slovenia india germany pakistan</p>
<p>the virgin islands spain denmark</p>
<p>saudi arabia jordan trinidad poland</p>
<p>these are some new names ireland</p>
<p>argentina switzerland uh israel turkey</p>
<p>and all across these</p>
<p>united states and i don&rsquo;t know if yeah</p>
<p>we said canada and uh and</p>
<p>listen mexico what is it with you guys</p>
<p>south america</p>
<p>i know you&rsquo;re listening but you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>not chiming in so i&rsquo;m going to put one</p>
<p>in for mexico anyway i know they&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see um and then uh let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to a question this time from</p>
<p>facebook</p>
<p>elvira wants to know can baking soda</p>
<p>break a fast</p>
<p>now baking soda if it just has baking</p>
<p>soda in there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to break a fast but</p>
<p>sometimes they add in their</p>
<p>other ingredients that will break a fast</p>
<p>some carbs and things so just read the</p>
<p>ingredients to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>other ingredients</p>
<p>but when you put the baking soda in your</p>
<p>wheat bread that you make</p>
<p>the wheat is going to break you fast but</p>
<p>not if it&rsquo;s keto friendly</p>
<p>all right wonderful great words why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go to our first quiz question</p>
<p>doc here you go</p>
<p>okay what is the most popular drug used</p>
<p>on college campuses</p>
<p>so i assume you mean like an illicit</p>
<p>drug not some prescription thing is that</p>
<p>is that or whatever huh yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>prescription drug</p>
<p>oh interesting but you might not take it</p>
<p>with a prescription</p>
<p>oh yeah without a prescription there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some of that too</p>
<p>okay how about jessie she wants to know</p>
<p>on youtube with or without drugs what</p>
<p>causes a sluggish lymphatic system</p>
<p>is it acidosis</p>
<p>your lymphatic system doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>pump so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s activated by motion you have to</p>
<p>move</p>
<p>uh now there&rsquo;s uh different types of</p>
<p>lymphedemia</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually holding fluid um</p>
<p>or lymph</p>
<p>because of various reasons which i won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get into but</p>
<p>typically if you want to get that</p>
<p>lymphatic system pumped out</p>
<p>you want to stay in motion you want to</p>
<p>stay moving</p>
<p>exercise but there are other conditions</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s immune conditions</p>
<p>the lymphatic system is really</p>
<p>a backup system for your circulation</p>
<p>because all of your</p>
<p>blood that goes through the arteries and</p>
<p>gets pumped to the heart</p>
<p>end up into the capillaries then then</p>
<p>they cross that barrier into</p>
<p>this other backup system which is the</p>
<p>lymph</p>
<p>lymphatic system which actually can act</p>
<p>as a</p>
<p>system that can back up the circulation</p>
<p>so if there&rsquo;s anything wrong with the</p>
<p>circulation you could have problems with</p>
<p>your lymph</p>
<p>and lymphedema is a completely different</p>
<p>problem which uh i&rsquo;ve done a video on</p>
<p>that so you can watch that video</p>
<p>oh i hope jesse doesn&rsquo;t suffer from that</p>
<p>and by the way what would the symptoms</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m interested how jessie you know sort</p>
<p>of diagnosed that it might be a sluggish</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see um your ankles are</p>
<p>going to be all</p>
<p>uh filled with it looks like fluid and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>it looks like it&rsquo;s retention of a lot of</p>
<p>fluid like your feet and your ankles</p>
<p>and your body&rsquo;s just really puffy</p>
<p>interesting well jesse get off the couch</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m sure he</p>
<p>has a great exercise regime and then</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another one from youtube</p>
<p>steve wants to know he&rsquo;s been using</p>
<p>allulose if i&rsquo;m saying that right he</p>
<p>loves it says it makes great ice cream</p>
<p>wants to know your thoughts on that as a</p>
<p>sweetener</p>
<p>love it love it love it love it i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the better</p>
<p>um sweeteners</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll be doing more videos on it so</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>i recommend it it has a glycemic index</p>
<p>of zero</p>
<p>and it tastes like sugar well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really neat so</p>
<p>uh they&rsquo;re coming up with great great</p>
<p>schemes for that let&rsquo;s see i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any answers quite tabulated for the</p>
<p>question yet so</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we go to another caller and</p>
<p>stand by and i&rsquo;m going to bring up</p>
<p>zaheed let me find him here</p>
<p>from uh toronto canada zaheed you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air with dr byrd</p>
<p>good morning dr greg how are you good</p>
<p>morning great thanks</p>
<p>okay uh my question is like um i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing keto for past</p>
<p>four months um i lost like tremendous</p>
<p>like wait i would say about like 24 to</p>
<p>25 pounds</p>
<p>but now it kind of still it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>anymore but i&rsquo;m not too worried about it</p>
<p>because i have some muscle weight i do</p>
<p>work out</p>
<p>my issue is i&rsquo;ve been have a gas problem</p>
<p>bloating problem for</p>
<p>past five years i tried different diets</p>
<p>i even tried keto</p>
<p>i tried to stick with proteins and all</p>
<p>that but no matter what i eat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still there and also i recently</p>
<p>developed an issue of burping as well</p>
<p>and some sort of heartburning and acid</p>
<p>reflux i would say</p>
<p>in other words my doctor says it&rsquo;s ibs</p>
<p>problem and you have acid reflux issue</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not taking ppis i saw your videos</p>
<p>and all those</p>
<p>uh but i&rsquo;m trying some homeopathic thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so my question is how to get rid of this</p>
<p>bloating issue because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it makes my life health it&rsquo;s cramping</p>
<p>mood swing</p>
<p>and all that stuff so you have this um</p>
<p>step one step two step three type</p>
<p>actions you want to take</p>
<p>um as the food goes through this</p>
<p>digestive system this pipe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite long you have the stomach and</p>
<p>then you have the small intestine</p>
<p>large intestine but you have these you</p>
<p>know the pancreas it releases enzymes</p>
<p>you have the gallbladder that releases</p>
<p>bile</p>
<p>but it all starts with the stomach</p>
<p>and the first thing i would do is try to</p>
<p>acidify your stomach because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>increase the ability to complete that</p>
<p>first part of the</p>
<p>chain of events which is usually a</p>
<p>problem for most people so if you start</p>
<p>taking betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not like extremely</p>
<p>acid it&rsquo;s not like a like battery acid</p>
<p>or anything like that it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably 6.5 as far as the ph</p>
<p>could be like six it gives you the</p>
<p>building blocks to build your</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid you&rsquo;re gonna need</p>
<p>probably</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know five to nine of those</p>
<p>with a meal initially and you might not</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>you might see a little change you start</p>
<p>doing that for</p>
<p>one to two to three weeks and all of a</p>
<p>sudden it starts to really work a lot</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>and then you start to acidify the</p>
<p>stomach over time</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s number one and then you start</p>
<p>doing intermittent fasting so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>constantly shoving food down this pipe</p>
<p>to give it</p>
<p>you want to give it a chance to heal and</p>
<p>then the second thing you want to add</p>
<p>after that would be the purified bile</p>
<p>salt so you can do the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula if you want but</p>
<p>now you start adding the bile</p>
<p>which now we get less burping we get</p>
<p>less</p>
<p>bloating because now we add those two</p>
<p>and then the other thing is the</p>
<p>probiotics just to make sure you have</p>
<p>enough of those</p>
<p>now in the meantime probably cut down on</p>
<p>like i said in the video too many raw</p>
<p>vegetables that could be bloating you</p>
<p>yeah and then try not to do too much</p>
<p>protein because if you can actually</p>
<p>especially at the stomach you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>digest that much protein if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the acid and that</p>
<p>can cause gas as a side effect but all</p>
<p>this means is that you either have a</p>
<p>problem with</p>
<p>proteins carbohydrates with fermentation</p>
<p>or fats with a lack of bile so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to just try one at a time and see</p>
<p>what fixes it</p>
<p>and i have a lot of videos on on how to</p>
<p>break it down</p>
<p>you know to make it easy just to mention</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been doing intermittent fasting as</p>
<p>well along with keto</p>
<p>and also i&rsquo;m cut down the vegetables i</p>
<p>do have some family history of cancer</p>
<p>and i have a gallbladder with a little</p>
<p>polyps in it my doctor is monitoring it</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>but bile salt i took some bile salts but</p>
<p>it made me</p>
<p>throw up that&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>you you didn&rsquo;t take it in the right</p>
<p>order</p>
<p>if you see bile salts are alkaline right</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for example</p>
<p>which a lot of people don&rsquo;t have the ass</p>
<p>in their stomach and they don&rsquo;t fix the</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>first and they jump right to the</p>
<p>gallbladder then all of a sudden it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work because they&rsquo;re alkalizing</p>
<p>the stomach more when they take the bile</p>
<p>cells so i would work on the stomach</p>
<p>first for a period of time</p>
<p>and then add that gallbladder later</p>
<p>but in my gallbladder formula i do have</p>
<p>acidifiers for the stomach but still</p>
<p>you just need to i think focus on the</p>
<p>stomach right now um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not ready for the bile okay</p>
<p>all right um that&rsquo;s all i have i have</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll email you a couple of my tests</p>
<p>um just attention dr burke and we&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>for from there thank you okay</p>
<p>thanks much all right steve what do we</p>
<p>have as an answer for the first question</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the most popular drug college</p>
<p>students use</p>
<p>nowadays all right well seventy percent</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>adderall 20 ritalin and then</p>
<p>cbd 5 and caffeine 5. any winners today</p>
<p>yes adderall is the winner adderall</p>
<p>is the winner so um in fact</p>
<p>did you realize that 24 percent of</p>
<p>students in universities</p>
<p>are using adderall i think that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>high and it&rsquo;s used as a study aid</p>
<p>i mean i understand the situation</p>
<p>because in college</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forced to learn so much data to</p>
<p>get these grades</p>
<p>but adderall doesn&rsquo;t necessarily fix the</p>
<p>comprehension of the information that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re learning it doesn&rsquo;t help you</p>
<p>understand the data</p>
<p>i know and um i had to go through</p>
<p>pre-med i didn&rsquo;t go to medical school i</p>
<p>went to chiropractic college but i had</p>
<p>to go through pre-med</p>
<p>and honestly there&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>time to really understand the data</p>
<p>you have to just get through it somehow</p>
<p>memorize it</p>
<p>which has really nothing to do with</p>
<p>understanding the data</p>
<p>and then pass the test and move on</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>in order to digest and assimilate and be</p>
<p>able to apply the information and test</p>
<p>it out to see if it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>that would take way too much time so</p>
<p>unfortunately the whole system is set up</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>force feed so much data so you can</p>
<p>regurgitate it get the test</p>
<p>get the diploma graduate so you can move</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>but how you going to do that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you have brain fog you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t focus so people are using</p>
<p>these steady aids</p>
<p>which i think is the wrong action i use</p>
<p>caffeine</p>
<p>pots of caffeine it caught up with me to</p>
<p>try to stay awake to try to</p>
<p>get all this data to pay it past the</p>
<p>test and so</p>
<p>um there are things to do i will release</p>
<p>the video on that next week um</p>
<p>how to there&rsquo;s a natural alternative to</p>
<p>adderall that i think um</p>
<p>is good because it has less side effects</p>
<p>because adderall is very addictive</p>
<p>it has side effects of psychosis um gi</p>
<p>problems um all sorts of issues and even</p>
<p>anxiety so</p>
<p>um that is the problem with adderall</p>
<p>with side effects</p>
<p>so stay tuned for that video next week</p>
<p>sounds like someone&rsquo;s eating some potato</p>
<p>chips or cleaning their desks back there</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see uh i think we&rsquo;ve got it all</p>
<p>zapped out but why don&rsquo;t we you know</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s christy should we go to uh</p>
<p>christy stand by just a moment and let</p>
<p>me bring her up and she&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>coming in from a place you probably know</p>
<p>olympia</p>
<p>washington yeah i actually practiced in</p>
<p>linwood washington</p>
<p>a long time ago beautiful</p>
<p>uh we&rsquo;re having a little trouble with</p>
<p>christy&rsquo;s feed can you try to talk again</p>
<p>christy</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to put christy on hold for</p>
<p>just a moment</p>
<p>yeah see if we can fix that</p>
<p>communication i know um</p>
<p>the problem</p>
<p>hey christy why don&rsquo;t we try something</p>
<p>take off your um</p>
<p>video and just do audio see if that</p>
<p>works better</p>
<p>go ahead chris you see if we can hear</p>
<p>you our thing is it&rsquo;s been just perfect</p>

<p>robert</p>
<p>i stand by robert yeah</p>
<p>and uh okay hi rob hi</p>
<p>thank you for taking my call sorry</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having some technical problems on</p>
<p>the show</p>
<p>we it all worked great in rehearsal i</p>
<p>know i know</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;m a 70 year old</p>
<p>male who&rsquo;s had cholesterol problems and</p>
<p>have been on statin medication</p>
<p>for years and a year ago i started keto</p>
<p>and i feel fantastic i&rsquo;ve lost i&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>pounds i&rsquo;ve lost a lot of pounds</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m doing it for my health i want to</p>
<p>just maintain this type of</p>
<p>diet for for longevity and reducing</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>and all the other things that go along</p>
<p>with it that i&rsquo;ve learned a lot from you</p>
<p>and thank you so much for your shows</p>
<p>um i my cholesterol</p>
<p>levels were in check according to the</p>
<p>standard</p>
<p>american guidelines</p>
<p>and three months ago i came off of all</p>
<p>statin medication with</p>
<p>with my consultation with my doctor we</p>
<p>wanted to try it he knows what i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>and i said i want to i want to give it a</p>
<p>shot see what happens</p>
<p>um i did an nmr just before i stopped my</p>
<p>statins</p>
<p>and i did an nmr three months later</p>
<p>the numbers now are staggering high</p>
<p>the underlying issue that i have</p>
<p>is that my thyroid was tested and it is</p>
<p>showing up very very low um</p>
<p>i am hypothyroid and i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>thyroid medication but</p>
<p>even with that medication i think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>over dosing me</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>am i am i going to be okay</p>
<p>if i adjust my thyroid medication</p>
<p>okay um and i&rsquo;ll have steve kind of mute</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>looks like crystal bell for a second</p>
<p>because we have some background</p>
<p>yeah we got her muted i can still</p>
<p>really that&rsquo;s interesting uh i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>her beauty crystal</p>
<p>if you like thank you okay so you um</p>
<p>so we got some staggering numbers is the</p>
<p>numbers um that are staggering</p>
<p>are they cholesterol triglycerides ldl</p>
<p>what specifically is going really high</p>
<p>okay the uh total cholesterol went from</p>
<p>one eight 168 to 386</p>
<p>total i know that&rsquo;s not the number you</p>
<p>want the ldlp</p>
<p>went from 782 to 3289.</p>
<p>did you did you did you actually um</p>
<p>measure the uh</p>
<p>type a and type b on that that particle</p>
<p>size</p>
<p>no no that&rsquo;s the missing link right</p>
<p>there um</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ll come back to that and what was</p>
<p>your triglycerides</p>
<p>they went down from 142</p>
<p>to 91. okay</p>
<p>okay speed do you have the ability to</p>
<p>to mute someone over there yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting it says muted i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>everyone if they&rsquo;re uh hearing this but</p>
<p>everyone is muted kristabel if you can</p>
<p>hear us</p>
<p>uh if you can just you know what i just</p>
<p>muted her</p>
<p>oh interesting no trigger yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>okay so um let&rsquo;s get it now</p>
<p>really that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>christopher</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s interesting but let&rsquo;s hear</p>
<p>what krista bell i&rsquo;m going to bring you</p>
<p>back in a little later we&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>lot of noise from the background there</p>
<p>uh standby okay so um</p>
<p>you gave me some really good data here</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>this is important question um number one</p>
<p>the thyroid</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t do you know if you have</p>
<p>hashimoto&rsquo;s or not</p>
<p>not been diagnosed with hashimoto&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>right there to convert from t4 to t3 you</p>
<p>need the help of the liver and you need</p>
<p>the bile the bile is really the key i</p>
<p>think to this whole thing because</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re having that much cholesterol</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not having enough</p>
<p>degrading or breakdown of the bile</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what one of the</p>
<p>important purposes of bile is to</p>
<p>get rid of the excess cholesterol that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming</p>
<p>from the burning of fat from the adipose</p>
<p>tissue from the diet</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re getting this we&rsquo;re not able to</p>
<p>get rid of enough of this cholesterol</p>
<p>because i think the bile ducts</p>
<p>need to be flowing better and i think i</p>
<p>would start dumping some purified bile</p>
<p>salts into your system right away and</p>
<p>then get retested</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to help your thyroid at</p>
<p>the same time</p>
<p>the other thing is that the tests that</p>
<p>you really want to get</p>
<p>you want to check the ldl p that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>particle</p>
<p>but you want to check the size there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>type a type b you have the</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two kinds there&rsquo;s a dense</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a high density and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a buoyant which is a larger</p>
<p>molecule i would bet anything</p>
<p>all that cholesterol the particle size</p>
<p>are the large buoyant</p>
<p>non-pathogenic non-problem</p>
<p>type cholesterol because that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the type of my wife she&rsquo;s getting all</p>
<p>this cholesterol coming through but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>ending up in your arteries at all it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just going through the system</p>
<p>because she actually needed more bile</p>
<p>and then she did very well</p>
<p>so with you i think i would simply get</p>
<p>that test done</p>
<p>you want an advanced lipid profile test</p>
<p>to measure type a and type b</p>
<p>and i would just be so curious to see</p>
<p>what the results of that would be</p>
<p>um i bet you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re the dense the</p>
<p>smaller dense</p>
<p>particle would be within normal range</p>
<p>add the purified bile salts keep working</p>
<p>on your liver</p>
<p>um and then come back on and let me know</p>
<p>maybe in two months and let&rsquo;s see what</p>
<p>we can do with that</p>
<p>and then maybe in the meantime um you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to add extra amount extra</p>
<p>type of</p>
<p>fatty foods just eat the fat within the</p>
<p>normal food but i</p>
<p>i will say that you all these other</p>
<p>indicators seem to be better you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling better and so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>okay so try that appreciate it thank you</p>
<p>very much doctor</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome okay okay</p>
<p>hey dr burke how about the next question</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a question why does gout attacks</p>
<p>attack why does this gout attack the big</p>
<p>toe</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>all right interesting let&rsquo;s see if you</p>
<p>guys could uh</p>
<p>get that one correct okay and let me</p>
<p>just have a little uh disclaimer</p>
<p>uh explanation for the audience what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re hearing in the background dr berg</p>
<p>the audience doesn&rsquo;t hear so it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>torture notes and we&rsquo;ll work that out</p>
<p>but everybody in the green room and you</p>
<p>apparently can hear that but at least</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not broadcasting so it&rsquo;s driving us</p>
<p>nuts</p>
<p>and anyway folks uh you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really excited about this new system we</p>
<p>have which allows a much more intimate</p>
<p>interaction between dr berg and all of</p>
<p>you folks so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ll bear with us as we get better</p>
<p>and better with this routine</p>
<p>but everything else remains the same the</p>
<p>question and so on and then of course</p>
<p>tons of stuff from social media so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get back to that</p>
<p>and uh we have some questions from</p>
<p>facebook muhammad</p>
<p>what is the better raw sunflower seeds</p>
<p>or roasted sunflower seeds is there</p>
<p>a difference</p>
<p>the raw sunflower seeds have a lot more</p>
<p>b1</p>
<p>in them however there is still some in</p>
<p>in the roasted and roasted are a little</p>
<p>easier to digest because there&rsquo;s less</p>
<p>inhibitors</p>
<p>enzyme inhibitors there so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>better on the digestive system</p>
<p>so you know eats them in moderation and</p>
<p>i think</p>
<p>most people can digest them but if you</p>
<p>can get them more raw you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get more nutrition</p>
<p>however that being said there are</p>
<p>certain minerals that you can get</p>
<p>if you if you actually consume them</p>
<p>roasted so it&rsquo;s kind of a mixed bag</p>
<p>because certain vitamins</p>
<p>are going to be there if they&rsquo;re raw but</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re roasted you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>rid of</p>
<p>or break down some of the</p>
<p>the anti-nutrients that lock up the</p>
<p>minerals</p>
<p>so um but i i pretty much like</p>
<p>sunflower seeds for their vitamin b1</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one one thing that i focus i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot of</p>
<p>your other nutrition</p>
<p>from sunflower seeds i mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of minor</p>
<p>so um you know it gives you certain</p>
<p>things but the main thing is the b1</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i like it so</p>
<p>i would just go with the raw if i were</p>
<p>you is that true for other</p>
<p>nuts or legumes or however you say it or</p>
<p>is it different with each</p>
<p>with each individual</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>well with the nuts you want them</p>
<p>germinated</p>
<p>and that way you can actually get rid of</p>
<p>those the phytates and the other um</p>
<p>inhibitors that will lock up nutrition</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um but roasted you&rsquo;re going to get some</p>
<p>nutrition too like in peanut butter and</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>try to eat a raw peanut and see what see</p>
<p>what it tastes like it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible so um walnuts i like</p>
<p>walnuts um</p>
<p>raw but i would i would germinate them</p>
<p>so i have a complete video on that</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>if you want to just search it out all</p>
<p>right that sounds great now let&rsquo;s try</p>
<p>kim again from arizona all right</p>
<p>steve do we have we have kim from</p>
<p>arizona on the line</p>
<p>go ahead kim hello okay kim all right</p>
<p>thank you hi thank you so much for this</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>platform to ask questions in your time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very kind it&rsquo;s very educational too</p>
<p>um been eight weeks on keto uh</p>
<p>once a day and i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>well i have dry wrinkly skin so i was</p>
<p>wondering</p>
<p>if you could help help with that also i</p>
<p>have a lot of sunspots but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m outside</p>
<p>and um it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m like a banana</p>
<p>getting started</p>
<p>so but</p>
<p>okay so um clarify the second question</p>
<p>about related to your skin you said i</p>
<p>know about the dry skin but there was</p>
<p>one more thing you mentioned about that</p>
<p>um i have wrinkles i&rsquo;m 57</p>
<p>and then i have i like spots h spots but</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s mostly from the sun so</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m outside okay</p>
<p>got it so there&rsquo;s a couple things that</p>
<p>you can protect yourself</p>
<p>against the sun and one of the things is</p>
<p>actually vitamin k2</p>
<p>vitamin k2 and taking vitamin having</p>
<p>enough vitamin d which you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get from the sun but vitamin k2 would be</p>
<p>very very important</p>
<p>as well as um the other thing which is</p>
<p>the omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>not only is that very protective</p>
<p>in the skin but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s going to help</p>
<p>your dry skin</p>
<p>the dry skin usually comes because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not consuming enough omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids in the diet</p>
<p>now you might say well i eat i eat that</p>
<p>on a regular basis but</p>
<p>the other reason is you&rsquo;re not you might</p>
<p>not be absorbing them because the</p>
<p>the gallbladder or the bile is not there</p>
<p>enough</p>
<p>to be able to assimilate those that</p>
<p>fat-soluble</p>
<p>nutrient so um</p>
<p>those are the two things i would look at</p>
<p>and maybe you want to take a combination</p>
<p>of both</p>
<p>but that will make your skin less dry</p>
<p>of consuming more omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>took cod liver oil and and i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing that but</p>
<p>could i take it twice a day cuddle oil</p>
<p>fish oil or fish salmon yeah</p>
<p>all right thank you yeah it looks like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having some tactical</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um if she was breaking up there a little</p>
<p>bit hear me here</p>
<p>i sure am and in fact we&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>answers to the</p>
<p>quiz question uh what why does</p>
<p>okay why does gout attack the big toe</p>
<p>and the audience</p>
<p>says 80 say the toe joint is the</p>
<p>furthest from the heart</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the coldest joint creating uric</p>
<p>acid crystals boy that&rsquo;s an advanced</p>
<p>answer</p>
<p>20 say gravity pulls uric acid down to</p>
<p>the lowest</p>
<p>joint uh what do you say</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m actually very impressed</p>
<p>with you guys because uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things that affect the</p>
<p>deposits of these uric</p>
<p>and that is uh the ph</p>
<p>and the temperature so it just so</p>
<p>happens that out of all the parts of</p>
<p>your body that is the coldest</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the big toe and so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably what&rsquo;s going on most likely is</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a temperature thing and</p>
<p>usually gout attacks happen at night in</p>
<p>the middle of the night they wake</p>
<p>you up when you&rsquo;re the coldest so</p>
<p>i will be doing a video more on that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s going to be a very</p>
<p>interesting video so stay tuned for that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wonderful and then back to uh</p>
<p>youtube fat nazi</p>
<p>is losing iron and weight and suffers</p>
<p>from helicobacter</p>
<p>is that any remedy for that or what</p>
<p>should he do or is that in fact</p>
<p>the cause of his problems</p>
<p>you broke up there steve can you repeat</p>
<p>that uh sure so anyway on</p>
<p>uh youtube fat nazi is losing iron and</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>and claims to have or does have</p>
<p>helicobacter could that be the</p>
<p>issue with him</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t i think that&rsquo;s a symptom</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>h pylori the microbe usually</p>
<p>comes because stomach acid is not</p>
<p>sufficient</p>
<p>so it tends to kind of come out when you</p>
<p>have low stomach acids so</p>
<p>and the low stomach acid won&rsquo;t let you</p>
<p>absorb</p>
<p>iron so i would add more</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride to sit up on the</p>
<p>stomach to absorb more iron</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re less anemic</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>all right that sounds great and then</p>
<p>back over that come through steve</p>
<p>it sure did and then back over from um</p>
<p>youtube how much bile salt should i take</p>
<p>my gallbladder was removed 40 years ago</p>
<p>goodness</p>
<p>yeah i i would i would experiment and</p>
<p>try try different things if you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>take my purify bile salts gallbladder</p>
<p>formula</p>
<p>you would take like two after a meal</p>
<p>but if you use other ones experiment</p>
<p>just to try to take a little bit take a</p>
<p>little bit more and see how much</p>
<p>you need until you feel less bloated</p>
<p>and your digestion is a little bit</p>
<p>better terrific and then lilia from</p>
<p>facebook</p>
<p>do you recommend omega 7 oils i never</p>
<p>heard of that steve did that come</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>it sure did it sure did can you hear me</p>
<p>doc</p>
<p>i think the doctor okay terrific and</p>
<p>here we go from lilia from facebook</p>
<p>do you recommend omega 7 oils or are</p>
<p>they better than omega-3s i never heard</p>
<p>of them</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a yeah there&rsquo;s more than</p>
<p>just uh omega-6</p>
<p>omega-3 um</p>
<p>but i think that i&rsquo;ve never seen a</p>
<p>significant</p>
<p>like wow that really helped you when we</p>
<p>when someone had more of those</p>
<p>fatty acids so</p>
<p>just to keep this really simple the most</p>
<p>important thing is to</p>
<p>avoid omega-6 that&rsquo;s the soy corn canola</p>
<p>cottonseed oil which honestly</p>
<p>i would just look at it like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really even need the six you need the</p>
<p>three that&rsquo;s usually what&rsquo;s missing in</p>
<p>the majority of the population</p>
<p>omega-3 and that can come from</p>
<p>fish oils cod liver oil but it&rsquo;s also in</p>
<p>egg yolks it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>you can have precursors like in walnuts</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>that has something called ala that then</p>
<p>converts into the active form</p>
<p>a little bit so but the main thing is</p>
<p>from animal products</p>
<p>um omega three fatty acids it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>yet people aren&rsquo;t doing it too much and</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pregnant especially if you&rsquo;re a young</p>
<p>child</p>
<p>to get those omega-3s are so</p>
<p>so important in brain development and</p>
<p>making sure that child</p>
<p>becomes smart because if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient you can actually have a lower</p>
<p>iq believe it or not all right terrific</p>
<p>answer</p>
<p>in my mind why don&rsquo;t we go to the next a</p>
<p>quiz question dr berg</p>
<p>yes okay why does your body need sulfur</p>
<p>in your diet okay sulfur</p>
<p>and from your food of course okay work</p>
<p>on that why would your body you</p>
<p>you know need that that&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>all right very good audience have at it</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>speaking of the audience diana from</p>
<p>facebook if a person is on blood</p>
<p>thinners is there a problem taking</p>
<p>vitamin k</p>
<p>yes that is a problem because</p>
<p>blood thinners especially chemical</p>
<p>it blocks vitamin k1 so obviously they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want you to have that because</p>
<p>uh they&rsquo;re trying to thin the blood and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>they need to avoid foods high in k1 so</p>
<p>all the dark leafy green vegetables</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>what you can do is consume vegetables</p>
<p>that are not leafy green like the</p>
<p>yellows and the oranges</p>
<p>the squash things like that and</p>
<p>certain peppers are yellow and</p>
<p>and then that way you can consume things</p>
<p>that are i have a whole</p>
<p>list in the video that i did on this</p>
<p>but um just a side note um it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>kind of sad when someone has to be on</p>
<p>that coumadin because they can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>the doctor won&rsquo;t even let them take</p>
<p>vitamin k2</p>
<p>which you really need to protect the</p>
<p>heart so um</p>
<p>i think there is other versions of like</p>
<p>certain blood</p>
<p>thinners that you can take k1</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not going to give you any advice on</p>
<p>that but i would ask your doctor to see</p>
<p>if you could take some of those</p>
<p>and maybe even try an alternative source</p>
<p>with the help of your doctor with more</p>
<p>vitamin e which thins the blood</p>
<p>more omega-3 fatty acid that thins the</p>
<p>blood so that way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not taking the chemicals you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking things that naturally within the</p>
<p>blood because you&rsquo;re trying to prevent</p>
<p>a clot so just some things to think</p>
<p>with steve all right very good and by</p>
<p>the way we&rsquo;re going to bring up</p>
<p>kelvin from the uk but one more question</p>
<p>before we do that</p>
<p>on youtube we&rsquo;ve got uh loa who asks</p>
<p>hello doctor how do i get rid of mild</p>
<p>headaches and earache post</p>
<p>covid so a lot of people suffering from</p>
<p>various things</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;ve had covet any tips or</p>
<p>suggestions please</p>
<p>well if there&rsquo;s an ear problem involved</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple reasons why that is now</p>
<p>there could be like a fungus</p>
<p>growing in the ear which then can cause</p>
<p>headaches for sure</p>
<p>so you take a drop of um</p>
<p>colloidal silver in the ear and or</p>
<p>garlic oil that would help if it is that</p>
<p>and the other thing that</p>
<p>could affect the ear is a deficiency of</p>
<p>b1</p>
<p>which by the way will help the smelling</p>
<p>your your sense of smell as well b1 but</p>
<p>you need to take in a fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamin because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s affected the the neurons in</p>
<p>the brain</p>
<p>so you want to take something called</p>
<p>benfotamine that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fat soluble b1 for that</p>
<p>which also by the way is really good for</p>
<p>ring ringing in the ears</p>
<p>as far as the headaches go i have a lot</p>
<p>of videos on that</p>
<p>i would check the gallbladder and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little cool thing you could if</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>if you press underneath the right rib</p>
<p>cage</p>
<p>while you have a headache and your head</p>
<p>it gets better then we know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem with the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>that comes on the right side</p>
<p>especially the headaches on the right</p>
<p>side down to the gallbladder and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little congested so there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re eating that&rsquo;s aggravating</p>
<p>the gallbladder</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s congested it&rsquo;s pinching the</p>
<p>nerve that&rsquo;s going right up to your head</p>
<p>on the right side</p>
<p>so i give a lot of advice on that too</p>
<p>but a lot of times those headaches are</p>
<p>coming from the digestive system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting i&rsquo;ll tell you i had</p>
<p>cove it over a year ago with millions of</p>
<p>others</p>
<p>and uh i did not lose my sense of smell</p>
<p>but things</p>
<p>tasted different and often horrible</p>
<p>any sweeteners even sugar or whatever i</p>
<p>could not stand i tried and i was</p>
<p>drinking my iced tea</p>
<p>without straight up without any kind of</p>
<p>sweeteners because it tasted absolutely</p>
<p>gross so it&rsquo;s really bizarre</p>
<p>the kind of different effects that covet</p>
<p>unlike the sort of common flu or cold</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>on the human body so who knows what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in there you know</p>
<p>eighty percent of your taste is uh comes</p>
<p>from the smell</p>
<p>and when the cobia gets into the sinuses</p>
<p>and it uh destroys some of the neurons</p>
<p>that go to the optic nerve in your brain</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not the optic nerve the</p>
<p>olfactory bulb which is all neurological</p>
<p>and all of a sudden then you now your</p>
<p>taste kind of goes away and</p>
<p>sometimes the smell goes away sometimes</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t so in that case</p>
<p>take a lot of zinc and benfotamine</p>
<p>is the answer for that one unless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s um that</p>
<p>fungus that can actually grow as well</p>
<p>and affect people which</p>
<p>which the case you want to do organic</p>
<p>oregano oil that&rsquo;s the thing you need</p>
<p>sounds terrific why don&rsquo;t we go to</p>
<p>kelvin in the uk kelvin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd hi kevin</p>
<p>hello can you can you hear me well or</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>i can actually bring it perfectly great</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing okay um i spoke to you</p>
<p>in january um and</p>
<p>i i saw one of your videos it&rsquo;s an older</p>
<p>video</p>
<p>a young child who had you know migraines</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>so forth it&rsquo;s called that it was one of</p>
<p>your videos uh</p>
<p>named something acupuncture i believe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very uh</p>
<p>old video one of your old videos um</p>
<p>basically i was diagnosed with a</p>
<p>benign tumor in 2015.</p>
<p>i had a i have every six months i have a</p>
<p>mri</p>
<p>um basically what happened was</p>
<p>any time i would consume food it&rsquo;s as if</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m being poisoned</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m um bedridden</p>
<p>i i&rsquo;ve been taken to the hospital at my</p>
<p>height</p>
<p>twice to a week</p>
<p>um and the submerge</p>
<p>basically what would happen was extreme</p>
<p>extreme vomiting</p>
<p>like over 70 times in one day extreme</p>
<p>diarrhea over 50 times in one day it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as if knives are being pushed through my</p>
<p>eyes and a truck sitting on my head</p>
<p>absolute agony until i pass out with</p>
<p>pain</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m found on the floor unconscious for</p>
<p>three to four days at a time</p>
<p>i spoke to yourself and you encouraged</p>
<p>me to look into tudka</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>changed my life in regards to me i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>elite</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m able to consume at least one meal</p>
<p>a day before the symptoms uh</p>
<p>at least one day before something get</p>
<p>back on top of me again</p>
<p>because prior to this i was unable to</p>
<p>consume</p>
<p>anything i was just surviving on</p>
<p>basically just fruits anything other</p>
<p>than fruits</p>
<p>i would go into this absolute convulsing</p>
<p>almost being poisoned um and the doctors</p>
<p>have tried</p>
<p>everything uh i used to be into</p>
<p>weightlifting i was very</p>
<p>you know a strong athletic individual</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve tried everything they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>looked into everything and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve absolutely found nothing the</p>
<p>closest</p>
<p>thing to normality has been the tadka</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;ve uh mentioned and</p>
<p>i can go with one meal every odd day</p>
<p>anything more than that</p>
<p>i just get thumped and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not life worth</p>
<p>living</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s bad it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>really bad it&rsquo;s like really really bad</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>amazing uh yeah uh</p>
<p>yeah you you&rsquo;ve changed my life with</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>tadka and i you are literally</p>
<p>right there you know what the</p>
<p>issue is but it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>can get away with now for the first time</p>
<p>it was so emotional to actually be able</p>
<p>to eat</p>
<p>a meal in almost like it feels like</p>
<p>years</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve kind of almost been on</p>
<p>keto with me some you know when i get my</p>
<p>when i test to see if i&rsquo;m in ketosis</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty much in ketosis because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty much just fasting</p>
<p>all of the time and then it&rsquo;s broken</p>
<p>with mostly fruits</p>
<p>wow so with the tata i&rsquo;ve been able to</p>
<p>get away with at least</p>
<p>a meal that&rsquo;s awesome you know for those</p>
<p>people that don&rsquo;t know what tutka is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um now they make it a synthetic</p>
<p>version of bear bile</p>
<p>which is a it&rsquo;s a type of bile salt and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite remarkable because it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of those things that i recommend</p>
<p>for very very wild bizarre</p>
<p>symptoms that you can&rsquo;t figure out and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve tried everything and nothing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worked</p>
<p>and you try this and it works and it</p>
<p>what it does is it</p>
<p>opens up the bile ducts in your liver to</p>
<p>allow more drainage</p>
<p>so i mean it goes beyond that but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>that way you have less toxins coming</p>
<p>back up it&rsquo;s an anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>i think you may want to make sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>two tatka in the morning two in the</p>
<p>afternoon both an empty stomach and you</p>
<p>may even</p>
<p>when you eat that meal take regular bile</p>
<p>salts</p>
<p>right after the meal so that can</p>
<p>actually help yourself as well</p>
<p>and then do more things to support your</p>
<p>liver for example</p>
<p>choline might be something that would be</p>
<p>good for you fermented</p>
<p>vegetable might be okay um i think you</p>
<p>might benefit too from</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called keto aminos that i have</p>
<p>simply because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to break down protein</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just giving you those</p>
<p>um essential amino acids that you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting from the fruit</p>
<p>or other food because you&rsquo;re having a</p>
<p>hard time just getting</p>
<p>the right nutrients you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to maybe add more nutrients to</p>
<p>make sure you have enough amino acids</p>
<p>make sure you have enough fatty acids</p>
<p>make sure you have enough vitamins but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for you to get it from food</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>i think over time things are going to</p>
<p>get better where you can actually do</p>
<p>more and more foods</p>
<p>but that is awesome i i love it and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so happy for you that&rsquo;s so great</p>
<p>thank you very much there i i i</p>
<p>appreciate so</p>
<p>just to close it off it was you said</p>
<p>choline yeah choline</p>
<p>choline is actually in bile salts it</p>
<p>helps the liver</p>
<p>um i always find that um</p>
<p>regardless of how sick a person is they</p>
<p>the choline helps them it&rsquo;s like oh that</p>
<p>gives me it gives me relief it opens up</p>
<p>the liver allows for drainage</p>
<p>all right thank you thank you thank you</p>
<p>very much for the work you do</p>
<p>i really appreciate it thank you very</p>
<p>much you&rsquo;re welcome my pleasure</p>
<p>and i would love to have you add your</p>
<p>success story to my website one thing</p>
<p>that i</p>
<p>i rarely ask for which i&rsquo;m starting to</p>
<p>now is</p>
<p>definitely send us your success stories</p>
<p>i have a button on our webpage</p>
<p>that you can write your success story</p>
<p>because i want to read these success</p>
<p>stories</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting so many successes all over</p>
<p>the place</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;d like to actually have them on</p>
<p>our website</p>
<p>that would be awesome so um</p>
<p>those of you that are experiencing great</p>
<p>results just go to the website and enter</p>
<p>your success story</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to be talking about them i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>post them and i want to read all of them</p>
<p>and we have i think we have a little</p>
<p>more than 4 thousand</p>
<p>uh we have a few more to go till we hit</p>
<p>the target of 1 million</p>
<p>so um i need your help our we need to</p>
<p>quickly</p>
<p>get more of these on the website well i</p>
<p>tell you what dr berg you know i embrace</p>
<p>and many people do medical science to</p>
<p>the degree that they can help but</p>
<p>so often doctors just seem to give up</p>
<p>they may have</p>
<p>a remedy somewhere in their textbooks or</p>
<p>whatever but i just don&rsquo;t think they do</p>
<p>the research and i know for a fact they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do the research that you do so dr</p>
<p>berg</p>
<p>you know is not inventing these things</p>
<p>he does enormous amount of research</p>
<p>starting from four a.m in the morning</p>
<p>and region region reads and finds out</p>
<p>what things</p>
<p>help people so um you know</p>
<p>from that you get a story uh like kelvin</p>
<p>who you know in spite of all the great</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>uh doctors uh uh in the uk there</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t seem to help him and dr</p>
<p>berg did so we need to keep an open mind</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>treatment there&rsquo;s a lot of holistic and</p>
<p>a lot of natural things that</p>
<p>indeed do you know keep us a lot</p>
<p>healthier so</p>
<p>we all salute you dr berg for your</p>
<p>tenacious</p>
<p>you know research and it pays tremendous</p>
<p>dividends so that&rsquo;s terrific i tell we</p>
<p>should probably go</p>
<p>to another uh or excuse me answer a quiz</p>
<p>question that we have here</p>
<p>and it is uh what does our body need</p>
<p>sulfur</p>
<p>from the diet why do we need that and</p>
<p>the 75</p>
<p>say better joint health 15 say liver</p>
<p>detoxification and 10 percent say</p>
<p>improved immune system just how smart</p>
<p>are they on this question doc</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all smart because one of the</p>
<p>most important things for software is</p>
<p>detoxification</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s two very important</p>
<p>amino acids that are made from sulfur</p>
<p>methionine and cysteine</p>
<p>and those are involved in making</p>
<p>glutathione which is</p>
<p>the most one of the most important</p>
<p>detoxifying antioxidants that we have of</p>
<p>the liver</p>
<p>so the software foods which by the way</p>
<p>um you might think garlic onion</p>
<p>brussels sprouts cabbage you&rsquo;re correct</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get softer from that for</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>and you need to get your sulfur from</p>
<p>that but there&rsquo;s other things that</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>have a better absorbable form of</p>
<p>sulfur and that would be from the animal</p>
<p>products so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re watching and you&rsquo;re vegan you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a</p>
<p>not the optimum chance of getting the</p>
<p>type of software that you need because</p>
<p>um i mean think about it&rsquo;s like eggs</p>
<p>like rotten eggs you ever tasted well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because the sulfur of course you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to eat rotten eggs but eggs</p>
<p>have a good sulfur meat seafood</p>
<p>all have higher amounts of sulfur</p>
<p>so i would do a combination of those</p>
<p>foods</p>
<p>fish and meats and eggs and cheese as</p>
<p>well as</p>
<p>these cruciferous type vegetables</p>
<p>especially the um</p>
<p>the cabbage but brussels sprouts loaded</p>
<p>with sulfur</p>
<p>garlic onions makes your breath really</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>and fresh but um</p>
<p>yes the sulfur is good for also your</p>
<p>joints</p>
<p>chondroitin sulfate you ever hear that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for the joints</p>
<p>um but also for detoxification if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have sulfur you can&rsquo;t break down</p>
<p>poisons um if you take uh cinnamidified</p>
<p>cinemidified</p>
<p>for like pain relief in your whatever so</p>
<p>for whatever joint problem you have</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re low in sulfur probably</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to use up a lot of your</p>
<p>sulfur and your glutathione so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to replace that or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to become very deficient in</p>
<p>sulfur</p>
<p>and then now you can&rsquo;t detoxify that</p>
<p>drug</p>
<p>and so it builds up in the body so</p>
<p>anything</p>
<p>toxic wise the more toxic you are the</p>
<p>more sulfur you need</p>
<p>and especially sulfur is good for the</p>
<p>phase one phase two detoxification</p>
<p>to get rid of things that cause cancer</p>
<p>poisons that cause cancer so um</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what sulfur does steve</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s really interesting uh</p>
<p>here why don&rsquo;t we answer this question</p>
<p>or ask it doc go ahead</p>
<p>what is the number one exercise for</p>
<p>easing depression</p>
<p>okay so if you&rsquo;re depressed what is the</p>
<p>absolute</p>
<p>best exercise you can do right now for</p>
<p>the most relief</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the question right speaking of</p>
<p>questions colleen from facebook wants to</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>what are your thoughts about liposomal</p>
<p>vitamin c did i say that way</p>
<p>right yeah yeah it&rsquo;s a type of form of</p>
<p>of certain vitamins not just vitamin c</p>
<p>that they actually can</p>
<p>wrap it into a lipid form and it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>it can be absorbed in the body with</p>
<p>various tissues a little bit better</p>
<p>but the problem is what are you wrapping</p>
<p>in that lipid</p>
<p>uh most people with vitamin c they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wrapping an ascorbic acid</p>
<p>which is really just one part of the</p>
<p>vitamin c complex it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the antioxidant portion but what</p>
<p>about the other parts of the vitamin c</p>
<p>complex</p>
<p>i like or i recommend taking vitamin c</p>
<p>from a food base where it has the whole</p>
<p>complex the</p>
<p>bioflavonoids the enzyme the tyrosinitis</p>
<p>enzyme that has copper in it</p>
<p>the k factors the the j factors which</p>
<p>are like the anti-pneumonia factor of</p>
<p>the vitamin c complex so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vitamin c in nature comes in a whole</p>
<p>bunch of different parts it doesn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>in one</p>
<p>synthetic version ascorbic acid</p>
<p>there is some benefits benefit to taking</p>
<p>a large dose of ascorbic acid for</p>
<p>various things but</p>
<p>for overall vitamin c health i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend it because it can create</p>
<p>deficiencies of the other factors</p>
<p>i had this guy who</p>
<p>did some research and he says oh yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna go to mexico i have cancer i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna</p>
<p>get like over a hundred thousand</p>
<p>milligrams of vitamin c injected into my</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>and um i don&rsquo;t know if it actually</p>
<p>helped him but i do know when he came</p>
<p>back</p>
<p>he had severe deficiencies of</p>
<p>bioflavonoids because he started getting</p>
<p>like um</p>
<p>varicose veins and spider veins and</p>
<p>all over his body it was really really</p>
<p>weird that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s the deficiency of</p>
<p>the bioflavonoids</p>
<p>because he took too much of the ascorbic</p>
<p>acid which can throw the vitamin c out</p>
<p>of balance</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy and i</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s going to be certain people</p>
<p>who disagree with that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this or that i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>telling you what i&rsquo;ve observed and</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;ve seen before so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking vitamin c</p>
<p>taking the whole form just as nature has</p>
<p>provided it</p>
<p>so more ain&rsquo;t always better right doc i</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s not always the case</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s not especially if it&rsquo;s out of</p>
<p>the normal complex</p>
<p>go with what nature does it gives you</p>
<p>the whole complex</p>
<p>and it might be in lower dosages but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more functional</p>
<p>than a high potency synthetic version</p>
<p>or part of a vitamin that&rsquo;s in high</p>
<p>levels of fraction like</p>
<p>like most of the</p>
<p>vitamins sold at 100 days they have this</p>
<p>high potency synthetic</p>
<p>beef complex that&rsquo;s like 13</p>
<p>you know thousand times more than the</p>
<p>normal amount well really it&rsquo;s made from</p>
<p>petroleum is that really helping you um</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll knock out some of the other</p>
<p>factors</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s terrific and julian from</p>
<p>facebook wants to know</p>
<p>what nutrients does she think she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lacking maybe she has too little of</p>
<p>something she&rsquo;s continually having</p>
<p>dry feet and her toenails are in really</p>
<p>bad shape how can we help gilligan</p>
<p>you know these things i would make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re on healthy keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting first because</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;re treating the symptom but in</p>
<p>the like for example that could be</p>
<p>coming from omega-3 fatty acid</p>
<p>deficiency you can come from a lack of</p>
<p>vitamin b2 which</p>
<p>creates cracked skin</p>
<p>especially on your heels it could come</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>low zinc so i would make sure that your</p>
<p>diet is corrected also if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>toenail fungus or whatever that that</p>
<p>could come from the gut that messes up</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>your nails if your nails are split</p>
<p>that is a calcium deficiency if you have</p>
<p>these little white specks on your nails</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a calcium deficiency but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually a period of time where you ate a</p>
<p>lot of carbohydrate that</p>
<p>depleted that and now it showed up as a</p>
<p>white spot right in the middle of your</p>
<p>nail</p>
<p>so we know about three months ago</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how fast the nail well</p>
<p>grows every six months three months ago</p>
<p>you had a huge</p>
<p>birthday you ate it you ate the whole</p>
<p>cake that&rsquo;s how i can predict</p>
<p>what people ate just look at the nail</p>
<p>and see what&rsquo;s happening and</p>
<p>you can tell what time frame they did</p>
<p>that interesting we&rsquo;re running out of</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>speaking of time frame let&rsquo;s go to the</p>
<p>answers so the question was what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>number one</p>
<p>exercise for easing depression in our</p>
<p>audience 75</p>
<p>say long walks outside 10 percent say</p>
<p>running 10 say dancing and 5</p>
<p>say yoga and meditation are they on the</p>
<p>right track doctor</p>
<p>well i think that um they&rsquo;re all correct</p>
<p>um but here&rsquo;s the thing steve</p>
<p>when someone&rsquo;s depressed what are they</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically they stop moving right</p>
<p>there there&rsquo;s no motion</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a relationship between their</p>
<p>motion and their mood</p>
<p>i will guarantee it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>virtually impossible to feel depressed</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re moving fast and so the</p>
<p>exercise that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>that has the fastest motion is the best</p>
<p>for depression and that would be</p>
<p>sprinting running then comes jogging</p>
<p>i mean you watch forrest gump steve</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>you know how this works it goes for a</p>
<p>run and all of a sudden a year later</p>
<p>he has no more depression but um yeah</p>
<p>anything aerobic exercising</p>
<p>um type dancing high intensity interval</p>
<p>training</p>
<p>versus weight training which is a slower</p>
<p>motion</p>
<p>so you want fast type body motion to</p>
<p>to do if you&rsquo;re depressed</p>
<p>especially also if you&rsquo;re sleeping at</p>
<p>night</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting enough energy it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very difficult to be depressed</p>
<p>but when someone&rsquo;s depressed they</p>
<p>basically stop moving</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re usually in bed just laying</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>motionless so that&rsquo;s just a tip try it</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>see if it doesn&rsquo;t help you um and um</p>
<p>i will be doing a video on that too of</p>
<p>course you will doc hey listen we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>out of time why don&rsquo;t you uh take us out</p>
<p>of here and we&rsquo;ll play our little jingle</p>
<p>thanks for all of your questions and</p>
<p>your attention watches i really</p>
<p>appreciate you guys stay tuned</p>
<p>have some fascinating videos come up</p>
<p>this next week i will see you</p>
