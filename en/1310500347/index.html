    <p>The following is a conversation with Hodger Gracie,</p>
<p>widely considered to be the greatest</p>
<p>jiu-jitsu competitor of all time.</p>
<p>And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Bambi for HR services,</p>
<p>Mizanamane for style,</p>
<p>Blinkist for nonfiction,</p>
<p>and Athletic Greens for nutrition, delicious nutrition.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them,</p>
<p>if you must sinfully,</p>
<p>with a regret in your heart, skip them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have regret in your heart.</p>
<p>Let go of regret.</p>
<p>Live without regret, my friends.</p>
<p>Please still check out the sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Bambi,</p>
<p>spelled B-A-M-B-E-E.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an outsourced and automated</p>
<p>human resources solution for businesses.</p>
<p>It was built to give businesses</p>
<p>a dedicated yet cost-effective human resource option</p>
<p>at just 99 bucks per month.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things involved in running a business,</p>
<p>only some of which I deeply enjoy.</p>
<p>Doing the innovation, the engineering,</p>
<p>the details engineering,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s software, hardware,</p>
<p>mechanical materials, all of it.</p>
<p>I love the engineering.</p>
<p>I love the early design stages</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re coming up with ideas.</p>
<p>I even love the product design,</p>
<p>so coming up with a short-term and long-term vision</p>
<p>of how to design things,</p>
<p>how to bring joy to the world by building cool stuff,</p>
<p>and then doing that at scale, doing mass manufacturing.</p>
<p>Even that is super interesting.</p>
<p>But to make all of that work,</p>
<p>you have to do all of the glue,</p>
<p>the cohesive chemistry that makes a business run,</p>
<p>and a big part of that is managing the people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s after all the people</p>
<p>that do all the magic in a business,</p>
<p>and managing the people</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s in English called human resources.</p>
<p>So you gotta use good tools for the job,</p>
<p>great tools for the job,</p>
<p>and hopefully affordable, cost-effective tools for that job,</p>
<p>which is exactly what Bambi is.</p>
<p>You can schedule your free conversation today.</p>
<p>Go to bambi.com and type Lex under podcast when signing up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s spelled B-A-M-B-E-E.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Mizanin, Maine,</p>
<p>the maker of comfortable, stylish dress shirts</p>
<p>and other menswear that I&rsquo;m currently wearing,</p>
<p>and I just popped my collar,</p>
<p>like just because I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling stylish, I&rsquo;m feeling sexy.</p>
<p>This feels like an SNL skit.</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>When the guy&rsquo;s like looking in the mirror</p>
<p>and doing positive affirmations.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever looked in the mirror and said,</p>
<p>boy, you&rsquo;re looking sexy today.</p>
<p>The moment I am, I think I&rsquo;m on a slippery slope</p>
<p>to a place I don&rsquo;t wanna be.</p>
<p>But anyway, so I&rsquo;m obviously doing it just for jokes.</p>
<p>It feels comfortable.</p>
<p>I just like the way it feels.</p>
<p>I like the way it looks.</p>
<p>My favorite thing to wear is a suit and tie</p>
<p>for more formal or for when I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>more serious kinds of engagements</p>
<p>like podcasts or presentations,</p>
<p>or just something I wanna take super seriously.</p>
<p>And then the most relaxed thing is just a T-shirt,</p>
<p>but in between that is a dress shirt.</p>
<p>For dress shirts, comfortable, sexy dress shirts,</p>
<p>I go to Mizzen and Main.</p>
<p>I highly recommend them.</p>
<p>I obviously wear a black dress shirt.</p>
<p>Right now you can get a special discount.</p>
<p>Just go to Mizzen and Main and use promo code Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Blinkist,</p>
<p>my favorite app for learning new things.</p>
<p>Blinkist takes key ideas from thousands of nonfiction books</p>
<p>and condenses them down into 15 minutes</p>
<p>that you can read or listen to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why the pace of this segment</p>
<p>of the program is being delivered</p>
<p>at an increasingly fast pace.</p>
<p>I wish I was able to talk this quickly</p>
<p>during regular conversation.</p>
<p>I think people criticize me for speaking too quickly.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a Freudian slip.</p>
<p>Well, not a Freudian slip, but a misstatement.</p>
<p>I think nobody&rsquo;s ever criticized me</p>
<p>for speaking too quickly.</p>
<p>Too much, maybe, yes.</p>
<p>Too slowly, yes.</p>
<p>Boring and monotone, yes.</p>
<p>Check, check, check, but not too quickly.</p>
<p>I think because I&rsquo;m really thinking on the spot a lot</p>
<p>and I like the silence.</p>
<p>I think the silence between words, at least for me,</p>
<p>helps me think.</p>
<p>It also helps calm down the pace of the conversation</p>
<p>where the other person can think.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the reason I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>is not necessarily to express an idea,</p>
<p>like I really, really wanna express an idea,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really to express an idea</p>
<p>in the service of the conversation,</p>
<p>in the service of inspiring the other person</p>
<p>to build on top of that idea.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t just want to sound smart</p>
<p>or say something that I believe needs to be said.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I&rsquo;m trying to dance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to be a good dance partner.</p>
<p>So anyway, all that said,</p>
<p>the fuel, the catalyst</p>
<p>for being a good dance partner in conversation is wisdom.</p>
<p>And I gain some of my wisdom,</p>
<p>to the small degree that I have it, from reading books.</p>
<p>And you can read them in full or you can read them in part,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where Blinkist comes in.</p>
<p>Really the greatest of all time</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Hodger Gracie.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with possibly the greatest match</p>
<p>in Jiu-Jitsu history, your second match against Buchacha.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the details.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the whole thing.</p>
<p>So the walk leading up to it.</p>
<p>You always do this walk, this epic walk.</p>
<p>You post that on Instagram.</p>
<p>Hanzo posted on Instagram this calm walk towards the mat.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go to that match in particular.</p>
<p>What was going through your mind?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been away from competition,</p>
<p>facing probably one of the greatest,</p>
<p>and at that time, many people considered</p>
<p>the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time in Buchacha.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the old man, the old timer, getting back out there.</p>
<p>What were you thinking?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s the first time</p>
<p>since probably I got my black belt</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t the favorite to walk into a fight,</p>
<p>I have to say.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people thought,</p>
<p>consider him the favorite.</p>
<p>I mean, understandable.</p>
<p>You know, I was out of competition for a while.</p>
<p>He was just winning everything.</p>
<p>So, you know, you&rsquo;re saying about the walk,</p>
<p>like for me, you know, the fight starts way before</p>
<p>the referee say go, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the focus and concentration</p>
<p>that I think is very important for me to start before.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I almost walked blind to the mat.</p>
<p>Many times I passed like great friends</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t see anyone.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re trying to talk to you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m 100% focused on my opponent already,</p>
<p>even though that I cannot even see him in front of me.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s, for me, was always very important</p>
<p>to try to clear my mind out from everything.</p>
<p>Are you visualizing the opponent or are you just clearing?</p>
<p>Not at that time.</p>
<p>Is there, what&rsquo;s in your head?</p>
<p>Is it like a calm river with birds chirping?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s blank, just blank.</p>
<p>Darkness?</p>
<p>Yeah, darkness.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we see in that calmness,</p>
<p>is just blankness.</p>
<p>How hard is it to achieve that blankness?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to say because I think I don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>when, I&rsquo;ll say probably as a black belt,</p>
<p>I try to focus like that, not to think.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s probably something you learn,</p>
<p>is the more you think, the more nervous you get.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing that you&rsquo;re gonna gain</p>
<p>by thinking of the fight or the possibilities,</p>
<p>what you can do, what can go wrong, what can go right,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s unpredictable.</p>
<p>You have absolutely no idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to predict the fight.</p>
<p>And you discover that if you just let</p>
<p>those nervous feelings go and empty your mind,</p>
<p>it actually is pretty effective.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It makes you feel better.</p>
<p>You kind of control your emotion,</p>
<p>control the adrenaline on your body up to a level.</p>
<p>So it absolutely helps you focus in the fight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that in jiu-jitsu and in general in life,</p>
<p>that whenever something feels really shitty,</p>
<p>you can just take that thought and not think about it.</p>
<p>Like I do that on long runs or a fast run or,</p>
<p>yeah, in jiu-jitsu, especially when I&rsquo;m getting older,</p>
<p>out of shape, that feeling of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Well, you can always get to the feeling of exhaustion.</p>
<p>You can just not think about it,</p>
<p>not think about being exhausted.</p>
<p>And that somehow relaxes you.</p>
<p>I think maybe in the face of exhaustion,</p>
<p>all the fears start to creep in.</p>
<p>Maybe your muscles tighten up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is for the amateur jiu-jitsu person.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of funny how you can just take that thought</p>
<p>and let go of it.</p>
<p>So you get, as a black belt competitor,</p>
<p>you get used to, you get good at letting go</p>
<p>of any thoughts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When you mention to exhaustion is,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s another good example of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of times in the fight,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting tired and you&rsquo;re getting pretty tired.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the last thing you wanna think of it</p>
<p>is how tired you are.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter because it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do, quit?</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how tired you are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no value thinking about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no value.</p>
<p>You just have to go through it.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re like, you know, many minutes into the match</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re slowly moving, as you sometimes do,</p>
<p>tying your belt, catching your breath,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking about anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to let go of thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to like to save everything to the fight.</p>
<p>Like nothing goes to waste.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, every move unnecessary,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna make you more tired</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s gonna take something out of you.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I try to calculate every single move I make,</p>
<p>save as much energy as I can</p>
<p>so I can fully, you know, be focused 100% in the fight</p>
<p>with no waste, especially energy-wise.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s instinctual.</p>
<p>Like minimizing the amount of moves.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not like explicitly thinking,</p>
<p>should I do this or not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just don&rsquo;t move unless it&rsquo;s absolutely required.</p>
<p>Yeah, because fight, you cannot really,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not really time to think much.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like your instincts are playing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s, you know, you already have your weapons,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, you know, the things that you do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just wait for the perfect moment.</p>
<p>The beauty of it is there&rsquo;s the right moment to everything.</p>
<p>If you feel one second too late, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>No, you get messy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, you&rsquo;re trying to catch that moment.</p>
<p>That is, you know, and for that,</p>
<p>you have to be fully focused in what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>because one second, you&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not exactly known as somebody</p>
<p>that moves super quickly.</p>
<p>So the moment, it&rsquo;s not about how quickly you move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the right moment.</p>
<p>So you move slowly.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s speed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you have to move at the speed of light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the move itself at that precise moment.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be super fast</p>
<p>because your opponent&rsquo;s not moving super fast, you know.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a combination of moving between you and him.</p>
<p>I mean, the same thing happens in judo</p>
<p>and the movement can be really small.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think judo is a bit more explosive.</p>
<p>You know, the moves are slightly faster.</p>
<p>So it does require a bit more explosiveness in judo.</p>
<p>But even just the right timing for an off balance,</p>
<p>just a little tough.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that, you know, moving the speed</p>
<p>is not gonna count that much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the timing that you initiate that move.</p>
<p>You see that with foot sweeps.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more beautiful</p>
<p>than like Olympic level athletes</p>
<p>going at it in the Olympics</p>
<p>and a perfect foot sweep.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, and you see one man&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>flash before his eyes and realize,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m supposed to be the top three person in the world.</p>
<p>Did I just find, they have this look on their face</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know what just happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see that, I guess you see that in boxing,</p>
<p>knockouts and stuff like that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what the hell just happened.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that precise moment of movement</p>
<p>that you get caught.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s that one split second, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Do you get that in jiu-jitsu at all?</p>
<p>Because judo has, because of the explosiveness,</p>
<p>because of the point scoring system</p>
<p>that incentivizes these giant throws,</p>
<p>has these moments where everything</p>
<p>just turns in a single moment.</p>
<p>Do you have that in jiu-jitsu too?</p>
<p>Not really, because then it&rsquo;s points.</p>
<p>Yes, you get like, you know, two points.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, because I think regarding the submission,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just one precise movement that changes everything.</p>
<p>I think judo is the takedown that counts as a submission,</p>
<p>like Ippon, fight over.</p>
<p>Jiu-jitsu don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>So you will score points.</p>
<p>But I think in terms of submission,</p>
<p>you need to get to a dominant position first,</p>
<p>and then the submission will come slowly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go back to that guy with his mind.</p>
<p>So actually, in the weeks leading up to it,</p>
<p>in the days, in the hours, in the minutes,</p>
<p>is there some fear in you leading up to this?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not gonna say that I&rsquo;m fearless,</p>
<p>because everybody fears something, you know?</p>
<p>The fear is there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like how much you let that control you.</p>
<p>I think I was a lot more confident than fearful,</p>
<p>for sure, walking into that fight.</p>
<p>Like, I was pretty confident that I could beat him.</p>
<p>What was the source of that confidence?</p>
<p>My belief on me, this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I can take the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you can take anyone in the world,</p>
<p>but is there a specific strategic,</p>
<p>like, you know, talking to Donahair,</p>
<p>he believes that there&rsquo;s no such thing as confidence,</p>
<p>or rather, the way you get confidence is through data,</p>
<p>like that you have proven yourself effective</p>
<p>in previous situations, but with Buchecha,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have much data.</p>
<p>It was a very, the first time you faced him</p>
<p>was a very tough, that was also one of the greatest matches</p>
<p>of all time, it was very tough.</p>
<p>So doesn&rsquo;t that creep in, like that doubt,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have enough data</p>
<p>to be confident based on that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, okay, if I never have fought before,</p>
<p>you know, suddenly walk into a fight with someone like that,</p>
<p>then would I be that confident?</p>
<p>I mean, probably no.</p>
<p>You know, so that history of what, you know,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve been doing, what we&rsquo;ve been achieving</p>
<p>just gives you confidence.</p>
<p>If that was my first fight ever,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t, probably I wouldn&rsquo;t be that confident.</p>
<p>But the time off?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the fear or the actual physical experience,</p>
<p>the psychological experience of being rusty,</p>
<p>of being out of the competition?</p>
<p>That will come out on training.</p>
<p>So you, okay, so you simulate some aspect of that</p>
<p>in the training?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the training will tell you how you are.</p>
<p>Okay, did you increase the intensity of the training</p>
<p>leading up to this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I train normal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say compared to the first fight,</p>
<p>the second was a lot more confidence</p>
<p>because, you know, like I say on training,</p>
<p>the training for the first fight, they were terrible.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>I think I was focusing on MMA for a while,</p>
<p>for a couple of months,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t really focusing the gi.</p>
<p>And, you know, by the time I accept the fight</p>
<p>and start training,</p>
<p>like all my responses on training were off.</p>
<p>Like all my training partners that I used to train with</p>
<p>that I destroyed.</p>
<p>I mean, now they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re beating me.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like I cannot beat them</p>
<p>the way I was used to.</p>
<p>But, you know, so I knew something was not right</p>
<p>for the first fight.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s, you know, no points,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s submission or draw.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Yeah, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it was the Mudder-Morris, which is a 20-minute match,</p>
<p>submission only, so there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>the winner is determined only by submission,</p>
<p>otherwise it&rsquo;s a draw.</p>
<p>So physically I wasn&rsquo;t myself on that fight.</p>
<p>I was tired, my body wasn&rsquo;t responding.</p>
<p>Anyway, so the confidence was different</p>
<p>from the first, the second.</p>
<p>I think I was confident enough</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t get tapped out on the first,</p>
<p>that I was still gonna fight</p>
<p>because he has to tap me out to beat me.</p>
<p>And I trust on my defense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident enough on my defense</p>
<p>that he will not tap me out.</p>
<p>But in terms of winning, you know,</p>
<p>walking to the second fight,</p>
<p>I was a lot more confident.</p>
<p>What can you say about that feeling</p>
<p>when something&rsquo;s not right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a thing that breaks people?</p>
<p>It breaks, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Like people crack, they give up.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a big test</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like being really tired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a lot of people crack</p>
<p>because they just feel they cannot give in more.</p>
<p>They have nothing more to give.</p>
<p>So they just like give up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>Just, again, take the thoughts out?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no giving up.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t mind, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Like just giving up is not an option.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the way you thought?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>About jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never gave up.</p>
<p>I mean, I tapped.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, not giving up is not tapping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just stupid.</p>
<p>Especially, you know, doing training.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, I get caught, I tap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never, ever hurt myself by not tapping.</p>
<p>I get, you get angry, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s train hard, you know, improve,</p>
<p>make yourself better.</p>
<p>You got caught.</p>
<p>Accept that you made a mistake,</p>
<p>give up, tap, then try harder.</p>
<p>So, you know, the not tapping,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re sacrificing your body</p>
<p>and, you know, you will never be the same.</p>
<p>Like if you let your elbow popped,</p>
<p>the elbow will never, ever be the same, ever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You let yourself go to sleep,</p>
<p>your resistance drops.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, everybody has a,</p>
<p>has a limit of resistance until they,</p>
<p>you know, to resist a choke before you pass out.</p>
<p>The moment that you go to sleep,</p>
<p>that resistance will dropped.</p>
<p>According to-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone say,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So tap, so that&rsquo;s the reason,</p>
<p>because people usually say it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the same or you&rsquo;re getting knocked out.</p>
<p>You get knocked out the first time,</p>
<p>your resistance dropped.</p>
<p>Your jaw get weak, gets weaker.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Just for the record,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never gone to sleep again.</p>
<p>Which means my resistance is high, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Must be.</p>
<p>Oh, your defense is pretty good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me,</p>
<p>or maybe in my case,</p>
<p>I think my understanding of when I&rsquo;m screwed</p>
<p>is pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not in trouble.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One of the things I regret the most</p>
<p>about my jiu-jitsu journey</p>
<p>is not having given enough time</p>
<p>to being in really bad positions.</p>
<p>Like the better I got,</p>
<p>I think the less I started being in bad positions,</p>
<p>which is a terrible-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you spar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you train.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you used to just spar.</p>
<p>When you spar, it&rsquo;s difficult to be in bad positions a lot.</p>
<p>You train with better people,</p>
<p>but I mean, let&rsquo;s say five, six minute rows.</p>
<p>How long you gonna be in a really bad position?</p>
<p>Not long, right?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t really have time to develop.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people, they don&rsquo;t train being in bad position</p>
<p>because you have to start there over and over again</p>
<p>to be used to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, or put yourself there.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t have that mindset, I think.</p>
<p>I think you start-</p>
<p>I mean, part of the fun of jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>is as you get better and better,</p>
<p>you have certain people you go with,</p>
<p>you have these puzzles that you&rsquo;ve figured out</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re playing very specific details,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to improve your main techniques and so on.</p>
<p>But yeah, just the percentage of time you spend</p>
<p>being submitted or even going against lower ranks,</p>
<p>trying to escape basic submissions is low.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true for most people.</p>
<p>Probably is, right?</p>
<p>Most people have very bad defense</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t allow themselves to be there</p>
<p>because, I mean, who wants to get tapped?</p>
<p>Because you will until you work on your defense.</p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;re gonna get tapped</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not gonna escape, you&rsquo;re gonna struggle to escape.</p>
<p>So people, they don&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>
<p>I regret it most because of the effect it clearly had</p>
<p>on how I competed.</p>
<p>It was clear that my competition</p>
<p>was constantly driven by conservative thinking,</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t take risks.</p>
<p>I think because of a weak defense, honestly.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of the, any of the fear,</p>
<p>like for example, exhaustion was accompanied by fear</p>
<p>because of weak defense, I think.</p>
<p>If I were to psychoanalyze myself,</p>
<p>and I regret it, I regret it a lot.</p>
<p>But speaking of which,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s ever submitted you in competition.</p>
<p>So you were&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I was a juvenile, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, so when you were a young person.</p>
<p>Does that still haunt you?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s, first I was winning that fight by a large,</p>
<p>I mean, I think by six points or four,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>But I was like, I was done with it.</p>
<p>You still remember it though, huh?</p>
<p>By the details.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You ever beat him again?</p>
<p>He never competed again.</p>
<p>Whoever you are, please, let&rsquo;s do a podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk shit about Hajar the whole time.</p>
<p>No, but what do you attribute to that too?</p>
<p>You were saying you were confident,</p>
<p>you were confident that the top of the world,</p>
<p>the number one buchacha would not submit you.</p>
<p>So where is that confidence grounded,</p>
<p>and what do you attribute the fact</p>
<p>that nobody was able to submit you?</p>
<p>First, it comes from training.</p>
<p>You know, I train a lot, bad position.</p>
<p>Like my defense is good</p>
<p>because I practice over and over again,</p>
<p>as much as I practice all my offensive position.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, you have to train both equally,</p>
<p>not just being in a good position, you have to be in bad.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a very strong part of my game.</p>
<p>You know, to be a complete fighter,</p>
<p>you know, a complete martial artist,</p>
<p>you have to be good in every single position,</p>
<p>every single one.</p>
<p>Those that you&rsquo;re not, you have a weakness.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, to be complete,</p>
<p>you should have no weakness.</p>
<p>So that was always my, you know,</p>
<p>I was always very particular on that,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s where my weakness,</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t feel good at it.</p>
<p>If you put me in a position where I struggle,</p>
<p>how do I escape, how do I get out?</p>
<p>Everything, any submission locked,</p>
<p>penny position, you know, back mount, everything.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which position I&rsquo;m at,</p>
<p>I practice over and over again.</p>
<p>So that when I, if I get there in a fighting situation,</p>
<p>I will know how to get out.</p>
<p>At least I&rsquo;ll have a direction, you know,</p>
<p>I will know this is my way out.</p>
<p>Do you practice both escaping the bad position</p>
<p>and the transition into the bad position, avoiding it?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s how it happens.</p>
<p>You know, jujitsu, you start in a neutral position.</p>
<p>No, the transition then becomes the fight itself.</p>
<p>Being there is the most important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>then you have to know how to get out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your weakness.</p>
<p>Stopping the person getting there is something different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re two different things.</p>
<p>Either you practice one or the other.</p>
<p>So both are important, I guess.</p>
<p>But stopping the person is easier to practice</p>
<p>because that comes naturally in training.</p>
<p>What was the actual process?</p>
<p>Like what was your biggest weakness throughout your,</p>
<p>like just remembering,</p>
<p>what was annoying to you to figure out?</p>
<p>I mean, side control is always-</p>
<p>Bottom of side control.</p>
<p>Bottom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, regardless how much you practice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not ever easy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never be easy.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so annoying.</p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, someone pins you down.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to move much.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big and strong guy.</p>
<p>Regardless of who, it&rsquo;s not going to be easy to escape.</p>
<p>So some situations are just hard.</p>
<p>That must be the, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interrupting Haja Gracie as he discusses Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
<p>But you just made me realize,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really good,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going against the perfect Jiu-Jitsu competitor,</p>
<p>probably side control might be</p>
<p>one of the hardest positions to,</p>
<p>is it the hardest position to escape?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>If the person doesn&rsquo;t want to progress,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just concerned about pinning.</p>
<p>Like the best pinners in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, partially because I&rsquo;ve just seen Judo people</p>
<p>that know how to pin.</p>
<p>Go escape their side control is a nightmare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nightmare.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much you practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nightmare.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also just frustrating.</p>
<p>I think, I guess it is also frustrating</p>
<p>because a lot of people in that position</p>
<p>will be about maintaining control, not progressing.</p>
<p>And usually people when they&rsquo;re in back control</p>
<p>are usually trying to progress towards the submission,</p>
<p>which opens up opportunities for escape.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the actual process of just time and time again,</p>
<p>putting yourself in a bottom side control?</p>
<p>Yeah, over and over again, starting there,</p>
<p>escape, get back, escape, get back.</p>
<p>If it mounts you, get back.</p>
<p>Any situation outside that, stop, start again,</p>
<p>stop, start again.</p>
<p>And it has to be, I&rsquo;ll say five minutes</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the repetition that will teach you.</p>
<p>If you train like three minutes on top,</p>
<p>you have time to one thing and then time out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the repetition there over and over again.</p>
<p>When you try the same move over and over again,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll see what can go wrong.</p>
<p>And is it understanding the details of the movement</p>
<p>or actually doing the movement and feeling it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>First, you have to understand the movement</p>
<p>and then practice.</p>
<p>But most important thing is defense,</p>
<p>escape coming second.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s attacking you.</p>
<p>The one thing is if he&rsquo;s not trying to submit you,</p>
<p>but the other one, if it is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say if a person is very good,</p>
<p>has a very good attack,</p>
<p>the first thing is defense, not just escape.</p>
<p>You can expose yourself to an even worse position</p>
<p>because that is very risky.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re trying to escape,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll always expose yourself to a worse position.</p>
<p>So avoiding that, first is defense, not getting caught.</p>
<p>And then when you&rsquo;re escaping,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be in a worse position than you are.</p>
<p>So defense, in jiu-jitsu, when you&rsquo;re wearing a gi,</p>
<p>what does defense entail?</p>
<p>Is it mostly grips?</p>
<p>Is it mostly the positioning of your hips and legs?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything together</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a whole body movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constantly moving your arms, legs, body.</p>
<p>Everything works together.</p>
<p>Going back to the mind of that guy,</p>
<p>so confident, no fear at this point.</p>
<p>Is there a bit of ego in there too?</p>
<p>Yes, like I said, I&rsquo;m not gonna say I&rsquo;m fearless.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s concerns.</p>
<p>That fight, I would have to say,</p>
<p>was probably the fight that I got nervous the most</p>
<p>walking in because I knew what that meant, that fight.</p>
<p>It meant everything for me,</p>
<p>all my legacy was on the line</p>
<p>because if I&rsquo;d have lost that fight,</p>
<p>forever I would be number two, forever.</p>
<p>And I mean, Busheche is a great guy, great competitor.</p>
<p>Jiu-jitsu is very good, but I&rsquo;m better than him.</p>
<p>I knew that.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s competing nonstop at that point.</p>
<p>No, no, he&rsquo;s a great competitor,</p>
<p>taking nothing out of him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super tough, very tough, very good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably the best competitor in Jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>He won 13 times the world championship.</p>
<p>I won 10.</p>
<p>So as a competitor, he has more titles than I do.</p>
<p>But in terms of analyzing the game,</p>
<p>I consider technically better than him.</p>
<p>So knowing all that, everything that I build,</p>
<p>all my legacy, it&rsquo;s if I lose-</p>
<p>Writing on this match.</p>
<p>If I lose this fight, I&rsquo;m forever number two.</p>
<p>And none of that is going through your mind?</p>
<p>No, I knew.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not at that moment.</p>
<p>I already knew that.</p>
<p>I remember just before the curtains open,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m standing and before they call my name</p>
<p>and I mean, my legs were like,</p>
<p>I feel the adrenaline kicking on my legs</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, you know, I&rsquo;m hitting the legs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wake up, you know, get off,</p>
<p>get the adrenaline off me, you know.</p>
<p>So it was intense.</p>
<p>It was intense.</p>
<p>And this was in Rio?</p>
<p>That was in Rio.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>My hometown.</p>
<p>So this is, I mean, and you know,</p>
<p>Rio is not exactly known for its calmness in its fans.</p>
<p>So this is like, wow, wherever they hosted the Olympics</p>
<p>the year before.</p>
<p>So this is like, I mean, this,</p>
<p>like the whole basically martial arts community</p>
<p>is watching this.</p>
<p>Watching the fight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, is there some, was Hanzo there?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, he was there.</p>
<p>So people are just, I mean, there&rsquo;s a tension.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you felt that in part</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also fighting for the Gracie name.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In our hometown.</p>
<p>The greatest-</p>
<p>Where the Gracie really established.</p>
<p>Gracie competitor of all time, arguably.</p>
<p>In the hometown.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, okay.</p>
<p>All my family, my best friends, my friends,</p>
<p>everybody watching, everybody there.</p>
<p>There was a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>And then were you thinking</p>
<p>that you would be able to submit him?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s at that point,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t predict how the fight will go.</p>
<p>That I never did because it is unpredictable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I never tried to set any strategy for any fight.</p>
<p>I think, oh, okay.</p>
<p>That I did, but that was the only time</p>
<p>that I set any strategy into a fight.</p>
<p>There was a 15 minutes fight there.</p>
<p>And I said, first five minutes, I&rsquo;m going to play defense.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bigger, stronger, younger.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to play his game.</p>
<p>And I know he comes in very fast.</p>
<p>Every single fight he had, you know,</p>
<p>he comes very aggressive.</p>
<p>So my strategy walk into the fight,</p>
<p>I say five minutes, I&rsquo;m going to play defense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to attack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to match his pace.</p>
<p>I already expected, you know,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m going to start losing the fight</p>
<p>because, you know, if he comes in,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a risk of me maybe getting takedown,</p>
<p>you know, or something happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m going to stick to the game plan.</p>
<p>Five minutes, I&rsquo;m going to start picking up the pace</p>
<p>because then it&rsquo;s 10 minutes to go,</p>
<p>which 10 minutes is a long fight.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t need to start fast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to start being more aggressive.</p>
<p>And then, you know, try to take him down or pull guard,</p>
<p>you know, by then I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as far as strategy goes.</p>
<p>So no specific stay on the feet.</p>
<p>Were you comfortable being both bottom and top</p>
<p>in this strategically?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m always comfortable being bottom or top.</p>
<p>I prefer to be on top because being in the bottom,</p>
<p>the person on top dictates the pace of the fight</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s on top over you.</p>
<p>So I always prefer to be on top</p>
<p>because I can dictate the pace.</p>
<p>I can implement my own pace.</p>
<p>And being the bottom, they can slow me down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder.</p>
<p>So if I can choose, I will always be on top.</p>
<p>But I think by then I was like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, five minutes, hit it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, he&rsquo;s pretty big and strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to spend a lot of energy taking him down.</p>
<p>I pull guard.</p>
<p>How did it, how did it feel?</p>
<p>So here you&rsquo;re stepping in, by the way, Puzzle Maths,</p>
<p>this is old school, as old school as it gets.</p>
<p>So calm and relaxed here for people just listening.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re watching the early minutes of the match.</p>
<p>So just feeling it out.</p>
<p>He seems pretty calm too.</p>
<p>He must be nervous too.</p>
<p>I wonder how, did you ever talk to him?</p>
<p>You guys are friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we&rsquo;re friends.</p>
<p>Did he ever say how nervous he was?</p>
<p>No, we never spoke about that fight.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He probably lays late at night thinking about it.</p>
<p>Maybe, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That SOB.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so you see the first five minutes,</p>
<p>he kept, I knew what he was going to do.</p>
<p>And I studied his game.</p>
<p>His stand-up is most basic, is basic in takedowns,</p>
<p>leg attacks, double leg.</p>
<p>So he goes single, double, and he charges in.</p>
<p>That is pretty much his stand-up game.</p>
<p>So you try, you get a grip.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we got penalized.</p>
<p>So do you like to use the,</p>
<p>do you like to pose with your left?</p>
<p>You have a right foot forward usually.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a righty, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a righty, but I know he wants my leg.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m playing my stance just because of his game.</p>
<p>All my grips, the first five minutes</p>
<p>was to kind of try to neutralize his attacks.</p>
<p>So he wants to get your left leg.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, right there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how hard is that to stop that?</p>
<p>I mean, he felt pretty strong coming in.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pushing the head down,</p>
<p>trying to play with his balance.</p>
<p>Yeah, wow.</p>
<p>If you see that there was a pause, go back there.</p>
<p>He charged in, there&rsquo;s a pause,</p>
<p>me standing in front of him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I did that on purpose.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Just in front of him, because he tried,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, you fail.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, okay.</p>
<p>So you could feel the frustration.</p>
<p>I could feel his frustration not be able to take me down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So now, and this is just psychological battles.</p>
<p>And you see me walking straight into the middle of the mat</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s circling out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m going very slow, recovering.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s computing like shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because he just made an effort, tried to take me down.</p>
<p>He needs to recover.</p>
<p>And I mean, you need to recover.</p>
<p>The other guy&rsquo;s there waiting for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And do I go for another takedown?</p>
<p>Because this one failed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do I need to recalculate the strategy?</p>
<p>Yeah, and he kept trying over and over again</p>
<p>and keep failing.</p>
<p>I think that frustrated him a lot on that fight.</p>
<p>I felt him kind of slowing down suddenly</p>
<p>because he was getting nowhere.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re five minutes in.</p>
<p>Yeah, he keeps.</p>
<p>So you never got that takedown in the early?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>So at this point, do you pull guard?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when I felt like he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>mentally he&rsquo;s worried now.</p>
<p>Did you try to pull close guard here?</p>
<p>No, I knew he was gonna bring Danny in.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the defense against pulling close guard?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I like that.</p>
<p>I like people bringing Danny between my legs</p>
<p>because see, I&rsquo;m gonna close my guard</p>
<p>even with his leg in.</p>
<p>Okay, he&rsquo;s stopping the,</p>
<p>well, this is awkward, but I guess.</p>
<p>Because I was holding his arm,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he felt he had no hand to post.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But still, it puts a leg in,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re able to close your guard.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re okay with that?</p>
<p>I do that really well.</p>
<p>I sweep people from that position a lot.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the sweep?</p>
<p>I just pushed.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like to your left side?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because he has no,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>around his back a little bit.</p>
<p>And he knew that,</p>
<p>like I swept a lot of people with that sweep.</p>
<p>So you see he kept leaning to his left,</p>
<p>to my right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I wanna push them to my left.</p>
<p>So you see him leaning over to my right a lot.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right answer for him,</p>
<p>to like roll or something?</p>
<p>No, I mean, he&rsquo;s stuck.</p>
<p>He does not really,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s stuck there.</p>
<p>But the one thing he did,</p>
<p>he kept off me completely.</p>
<p>See that he&rsquo;s leaning to,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s too afraid of my attack now.</p>
<p>Because he should lean on me.</p>
<p>You know, you should bring the fight to me.</p>
<p>So when I fell him,</p>
<p>like I knew he was like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s too worried about my attacks now.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So he can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if he comes back to the center,</p>
<p>he has no like.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not engaging now.</p>
<p>At that time, he&rsquo;s 100% just defending.</p>
<p>So I felt that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, he doesn&rsquo;t wanna engage.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s looking,</p>
<p>I knew at that point,</p>
<p>he wants my foot.</p>
<p>Because our first fight,</p>
<p>I had the exact the same position.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t holding his arm.</p>
<p>And he went to attack my foot.</p>
<p>Which he did, you know, he got into attack.</p>
<p>Like a toe hold or what?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I knew he&rsquo;s looking at my foot.</p>
<p>Which foot?</p>
<p>Sorry, your right foot?</p>
<p>Yeah, my right foot.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m holding his arm.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hiding it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m holding his arm.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re going to the back</p>
<p>as an arm drag type of thing.</p>
<p>So the moment that I came off,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m holding his arm.</p>
<p>So he cannot come up.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m holding his left arm.</p>
<p>So he cannot post a hand on the floor and come up.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s holding your right to try to get you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Basically to prevent you from attacking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And he rolls.</p>
<p>Yeah, he tried to get me off balance.</p>
<p>So see, now I&rsquo;m switching,</p>
<p>I switch the grip on his arm</p>
<p>so I can free my left arm.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Like, was there a chance he sweeps you here?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s always a chance,</p>
<p>but very hard.</p>
<p>Like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, but see, my left arm is free.</p>
<p>Oh, so you can post.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why was your left arm free?</p>
<p>Oh, because you were using it.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, I tried the hook.</p>
<p>Now you will see.</p>
<p>Still got your arm.</p>
<p>Yeah, but when I knew, he&rsquo;s panicking</p>
<p>because he did a move</p>
<p>that he completely opened himself up.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m holding his left arm.</p>
<p>So by holding the arm,</p>
<p>that prevents him from defending the hook on that side</p>
<p>because his arm is being held across.</p>
<p>So the arm cannot block the hook.</p>
<p>And I mean,</p>
<p>The hook with your left leg?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you see when he come up,</p>
<p>but I would say, I mean, that&rsquo;s my guess,</p>
<p>but Boucher, he&rsquo;s a big guy.</p>
<p>You know, he was like 110 kilos, 112, something like that.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>245.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What were you at the time?</p>
<p>Less?</p>
<p>220.</p>
<p>Yeah, 220.</p>
<p>A nice slim 100 kilo, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, his defense are not amazing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s good, but you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not known to have amazing defense.</p>
<p>So by being the big guy in the room when you train,</p>
<p>you used to get out of situation because of your size.</p>
<p>You shake people off.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s because of your size,</p>
<p>you shake them off, you get off some bad positions.</p>
<p>You can, I mean, I could feel in the first fight,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m side control, you know, suddenly he explode out.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;ve seen him doing that a few of his fights.</p>
<p>Not in the most technical way, just I&rsquo;m getting out.</p>
<p>And he did because of his size.</p>
<p>And he did the same thing,</p>
<p>like he tried to stood up when I&rsquo;m on his back.</p>
<p>He completely opened up the hooks.</p>
<p>You will see the next move, his head gonna come up</p>
<p>and he gonna try to get off the floor.</p>
<p>So basically, come up, shake you off kind of strategy.</p>
<p>There was no defense for the hooks.</p>
<p>I put both hooks in straight away.</p>
<p>Oh, his arm is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m off balance.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, I didn&rsquo;t bring him up, he came up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m attacking his neck</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s worried about the hooks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fatal mistake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like defense always come first.</p>
<p>Remember what I just said now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Defense first, escape second.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not worried more about the points than his neck.</p>
<p>So it was like a progression of mistakes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think he got frustrated</p>
<p>when he couldn&rsquo;t take me down.</p>
<p>And then when I pull guard,</p>
<p>he was frustrated that the fight wasn&rsquo;t going his way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very good about taking down.</p>
<p>He try over and over again for five minutes.</p>
<p>And here he was frustrated about the hooks.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like the frustration,</p>
<p>things like, no, no, no, these hooks shouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>Like I pull guard on the grips that I want.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not comfortable inside my guard.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not in a position that he wants to be.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s over leaning to his left.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not engaging or trying to pass.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to get the foot, but his arm is trapped.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna get nowhere.</p>
<p>And then when I swept him,</p>
<p>some of his words start collapsing.</p>
<p>You know, he couldn&rsquo;t take me down.</p>
<p>I pull guard, I&rsquo;m swept in.</p>
<p>He tried to roll me over.</p>
<p>No, he didn&rsquo;t get me anywhere.</p>
<p>The first movement that he tried to escape,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on his back.</p>
<p>I mean, now he&rsquo;s lost.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That, if you just go back to him standing up.</p>
<p>See, both hook goes in no difference.</p>
<p>Like there was nothing on the way of those hooks.</p>
<p>Because he tried to come up.</p>
<p>As he&rsquo;s coming up, you&rsquo;re high enough on him</p>
<p>to where the weight was just probably immense.</p>
<p>It just felt too heavy.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re already going for the choke.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no time to lose.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not like worried I&rsquo;m gonna get shaken off.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going for the choke.</p>
<p>Okay, you got your right hand on his lapel.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not shaking me off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on your back now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>And your right hand is opening up the lapel.</p>
<p>My right hand is holding his arm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still holding the sleeve.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re holding the sleeve,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m holding the sleeve</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m already going for the neck.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s timing.</p>
<p>At which point do you let go of the sleeve</p>
<p>and open up, help with the lapel,</p>
<p>or do you not need it?</p>
<p>No, I did that.</p>
<p>But first I wanna try to make a grip.</p>
<p>Like then I need to establish control</p>
<p>before I let go of his arm.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So I kept holding that a bit longer.</p>
<p>And then when I fell,</p>
<p>okay, I have a good control over the back,</p>
<p>then I let go.</p>
<p>Do you, okay, so you have like a light grip on his lapel,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re thinking you need that.</p>
<p>No, I need to adjust that.</p>
<p>You need to adjust that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like holding it there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking, okay,</p>
<p>at some point I need to adjust this.</p>
<p>All I need, all I want is to get under his chin.</p>
<p>Then I know it&rsquo;s, I mean, now I can go for it.</p>
<p>Because if it&rsquo;s over, there&rsquo;s no choke, right?</p>
<p>The wrist needs to be under.</p>
<p>Can you choke Buchecha over the-</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not right or it doesn&rsquo;t work?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not right and it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I mean, would you tap to a choke on your chin?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just pressure.</p>
<p>You hurt, but it&rsquo;s not gonna choke you out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, let me argue this.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>Arguing with Roger Gracie about chokes.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like clock choke.</p>
<p>It was always interesting to me</p>
<p>because in Judo, it&rsquo;s illegal to have the gear on the face.</p>
<p>And so it was kind of liberating for me</p>
<p>to be allowed to have a gear on the face.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just-</p>
<p>Liberating.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s more effective to go under the chin,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m surprised just because the amount of pressure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about how much you can take it.</p>
<p>You can take a lot.</p>
<p>But it feels like-</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t feel comfortable.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes on your mouth, it cuts your mouth.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re bleeding.</p>
<p>It feels horrible.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s not the feeling.</p>
<p>It might not be a joke,</p>
<p>but the feeling like it&rsquo;s a pressure</p>
<p>that everything&rsquo;s just closing in.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t take you anywhere.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re not gonna go to sleep.</p>
<p>You might not go to sleep.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just pressure.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So pressure, it hurts, it&rsquo;s uncomfortable,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not gonna break your face</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna put you to sleep.</p>
<p>So if I don&rsquo;t get the neck, I don&rsquo;t go for the kill.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m holding his collar.</p>
<p>You know, my wrist is almost under.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, I&rsquo;m trying to kind of dig in.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t dig in, then I would adjust the collar,</p>
<p>but first I need to dig in.</p>
<p>Dig in first, then adjust.</p>
<p>Can you do all that with one hand or no?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>So you can tighten the choke with just one hand?</p>
<p>No, I need the second one to open the lapel.</p>
<p>To open the lapel.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re like digging in with one hand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m digging in under the chin.</p>
<p>Under the chin?</p>
<p>Now I need to go deeper.</p>
<p>The going deeper requires the second hand?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>But that requires you letting go of the other hand.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to let go eventually.</p>
<p>Yeah, see?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I&rsquo;m already under his,</p>
<p>like the first hand got under the chin.</p>
<p>Do you need the hand on the second lapel?</p>
<p>Of course, otherwise he turns and he&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to control the turning</p>
<p>versus the tightening of the choke?</p>
<p>Yeah, it does both.</p>
<p>It helps tighten the collar</p>
<p>and stop the person rolling out.</p>
<p>Were you feeling pretty good about this position?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I just felt it&rsquo;s getting tighter, tighter,</p>
<p>tighter, tighter.</p>
<p>Because it wasn&rsquo;t super tight from the beginning.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like the perfect choke.</p>
<p>So it was still, I mean,</p>
<p>I knew it was like it&rsquo;s very close to the end,</p>
<p>but I still need to adjust.</p>
<p>There was still the risk of maybe escaping.</p>
<p>Is it possible for his head to slip out?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, yes.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m closing that gap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>What did that feel like?</p>
<p>Relief?</p>
<p>Relief.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Somebody on Reddit asked,</p>
<p>ask him about the cross grip he used to sweep</p>
<p>followed with a genius grip switch</p>
<p>when Buchester was inverted.</p>
<p>Did you use a cross grip when you sweeped?</p>
<p>I guess the cross grip in the arm.</p>
<p>That must be it.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the cross grip.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the genius behind that?</p>
<p>Or was that just the,</p>
<p>do you like that kind of grip?</p>
<p>Yeah, because I always like close guard.</p>
<p>And no one wants to be in anyone&rsquo;s close guard, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s open guard, it&rsquo;s the step to pass.</p>
<p>So everybody, when you try to close the guard,</p>
<p>they bring their knee in the middle.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re not standing,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re lower on the ground,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re open guard,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re close to me, you need that knee between.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a must.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I start developing the attack.</p>
<p>You know, I managed to have long legs</p>
<p>to close my legs around people even with that.</p>
<p>And then I just developed that sweep.</p>
<p>When did you start developing that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when,</p>
<p>but I would say before black belt.</p>
<p>Okay, so your answer to that is not to figure out</p>
<p>how to prevent them from putting the knee in.</p>
<p>Is there an answer to that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The good guys will always try to get the knee in.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t remove their leg out of the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>Well, maybe off balance them enough to where there&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, you can try, but like it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>If you can off balance, then you sweep them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that knee&rsquo;s gonna,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna have to solve that problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a full sweep, yeah.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s extremely common to have that.</p>
<p>I mean, if I&rsquo;m on your guard, open guard,</p>
<p>you know, if you have your legs,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m between both of your legs in the open guard,</p>
<p>my knee will be between your legs,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a must.</p>
<p>My knee cannot be on the floor.</p>
<p>Since Henzo was there, what did he tell you before?</p>
<p>I think just motivate you.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>Henzo always did that fantastically well,</p>
<p>to motivate me, like before in fight or match.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, the confidence,</p>
<p>you know, his energy being around you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the great thing to have Henzo in your corner.</p>
<p>It is the motivation that he gives you.</p>
<p>What did you learn about jiu-jitsu in life</p>
<p>from Henzo Gracie?</p>
<p>We got to hang out with him in Vegas a little bit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a character.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the historic coaches and jiu-jitsu competitors,</p>
<p>but also personalities in the martial arts world,</p>
<p>in the world in general.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few like him.</p>
<p>Henzo is a fantastic person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, what I&rsquo;ve learned most from him</p>
<p>is like, it&rsquo;s, you know, you can take any challenge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t matter when, where,</p>
<p>what, you know, who.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, you have to be ready.</p>
<p>And, you know, with that warrior spirit that he has,</p>
<p>he, you know, he always took any challenge,</p>
<p>ready or not ready.</p>
<p>Was it you that said it,</p>
<p>or he said it where not until you go in,</p>
<p>you know, to do something difficult,</p>
<p>do you discover the strength that you have.</p>
<p>So like, if you really think about it,</p>
<p>you might think that you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not good enough.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the strength to take on something difficult.</p>
<p>I fully agree.</p>
<p>I think we are measured not when we&rsquo;re on the strongest,</p>
<p>but when we are on the weakest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when we truly measure ourselves, our character,</p>
<p>who we are, not when we&rsquo;re in a position of power,</p>
<p>or when we&rsquo;re in a position of weakness.</p>
<p>Have you surprised yourself, like how damn good you are?</p>
<p>Like, is this really how good I am in this situation?</p>
<p>Where in retrospect, you might think,</p>
<p>how the hell was I able to accomplish this?</p>
<p>Not how good I am, because otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>So, you know, being there in the first place,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already not a great thing.</p>
<p>But I say, you know, every single time I found myself there</p>
<p>I was super proud that I&rsquo;ve never cracked.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve never gave up, ever.</p>
<p>Any second, any fight, never.</p>
<p>Never been broken in competition.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Even, it&rsquo;s not about winning or losing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about you giving up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never doubted myself.</p>
<p>I always fought to the very end, always.</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;m most proud of.</p>
<p>Because there was moments, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re in a terrible position,</p>
<p>you know, mainly like,</p>
<p>there was moments that I was super tired,</p>
<p>but like, exhaustive tired,</p>
<p>when it was easy to give up.</p>
<p>Like, I had nothing more to give, but I pushed.</p>
<p>I took energy out of my soul, I would have to say,</p>
<p>because when my body had zero,</p>
<p>my spirit, my soul, pull it out.</p>
<p>Is that, in part, just not allowing yourself</p>
<p>to have, to ever, ever quit?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have one other thing I regret.</p>
<p>I remember like a blue belt match.</p>
<p>I remember, I&rsquo;m not gonna say who it was against,</p>
<p>but I remember just being extremely exhausted</p>
<p>and just constantly fighting.</p>
<p>A guy was really good mount, really good guard passing.</p>
<p>And I just remember him passing my guard, eventually.</p>
<p>So it was just like the finals</p>
<p>of one of the IBJJF tournaments.</p>
<p>And then right away going to mount and just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the level of frustration,</p>
<p>I mean, I quit at that point.</p>
<p>So I remember that still.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not about losing, winning or losing,</p>
<p>but I just remember I was like teary eyed, frustrated.</p>
<p>And then I knew there was a lot of fight still left</p>
<p>in there somewhere, and I quit.</p>
<p>And I regret that to this day.</p>
<p>Because I think the reason I regret that</p>
<p>is because it gave me an option to now quit.</p>
<p>In every other aspect of life, this is an option.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>It sucks.</p>
<p>Yeah, it teaches you, you know?</p>
<p>It makes us stronger.</p>
<p>I think it made you stronger.</p>
<p>Yeah, it makes you stronger that you did that</p>
<p>to learn that don&rsquo;t do that again.</p>
<p>But still, like you said, just going to sleep and training,</p>
<p>I do think it made me weaker.</p>
<p>It did make me weaker in the rest of my life, too.</p>
<p>Those, you know, I&rsquo;ve quit a few times in my life</p>
<p>on small things, and you realize,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like, who cares?</p>
<p>But what you learn over time</p>
<p>is that voice always comes there.</p>
<p>Like, obviously, maybe it does for you too,</p>
<p>even at the highest level, of like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s okay to quit here.</p>
<p>Like, it makes sense, everybody would understand.</p>
<p>You know, in some sense, like, you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, many people would say you&rsquo;re past your prime</p>
<p>in this match with the Buchecha.</p>
<p>Like, it makes sense, you&rsquo;ve been focusing on MMA.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Makes sense to lose.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s a weird voice.</p>
<p>And in some sense, it&rsquo;s that voice</p>
<p>and a voice that says, like, why are you doing this?</p>
<p>Like, this is silly, this doesn&rsquo;t make any sense,</p>
<p>just stop, just stop, just stop.</p>
<p>And shutting that voice down</p>
<p>and never allowing yourself to quit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really powerful thing.</p>
<p>Like, everybody I&rsquo;ve met, everybody that&rsquo;s successful,</p>
<p>yeah, down to the, even engineers, CEOs, Elon Musk,</p>
<p>just never quitting.</p>
<p>Like, when everybody around you says quit,</p>
<p>never quitting, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>Might be genetic.</p>
<p>It might be like using the stubbornness</p>
<p>to just never allow yourself to develop that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically developing a calluses to that voice</p>
<p>that tries to tell you to quit.</p>
<p>You never quit, huh?</p>
<p>What would you attribute that to?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how much you want to get</p>
<p>to the destination you chose.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s how badly you want to get there.</p>
<p>If you quit, you&rsquo;re never going to get there.</p>
<p>And you always wanted to.</p>
<p>I always wanted to.</p>
<p>Is there some thing you remember from that match,</p>
<p>some things that happened before and after</p>
<p>that stand out to you, just since in Rio?</p>
<p>Yeah, there was an interview, like, prior to the fight,</p>
<p>there was a big fight, we were doing media every day</p>
<p>before, me and him, we were meeting for media.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like five days before,</p>
<p>you know, five, six days before, I&rsquo;m quite chatty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, the closer we get to the fight,</p>
<p>the more focused I get, the less I talk,</p>
<p>stop, joke around, playing, you know, with people.</p>
<p>But I remember, I think it was maybe three</p>
<p>or four days before, we were doing an interview together.</p>
<p>I think my cousin Kira was there,</p>
<p>she was doing one of the interviews with us.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what we were talking about,</p>
<p>but I just remember, we were talking about the fight,</p>
<p>of course, and then it was, you know,</p>
<p>we were standing beside each other.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, and then I, you know,</p>
<p>suddenly I jump in and grab him by the neck.</p>
<p>I say, I&rsquo;m going to tap you by the neck.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s like, you know, very shy.</p>
<p>And then I let go, I say, no, I&rsquo;m going to grab,</p>
<p>tap you by the arm.</p>
<p>And I could feel he was like, he wasn&rsquo;t comfortable,</p>
<p>you know, with being there, it was, you know,</p>
<p>me saying that I&rsquo;m going to tap him out.</p>
<p>There was like, I was so relaxed joking about it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m joking that I&rsquo;m going to tap him out</p>
<p>in a fight that we&rsquo;re going to have in four days time.</p>
<p>And yeah, I felt he was like, not comfortable at all.</p>
<p>Do you think you got in his head a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, I did, I think.</p>
<p>Did it give you a little bit of confidence?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that jiu-jitsu is a reflection</p>
<p>of your personality.</p>
<p>So both your jiu-jitsu and your personality,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a calmness.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Why are you so calm?</p>
<p>Is there like an ocean underneath that&rsquo;s boiling?</p>
<p>Is this developed or is this your personality?</p>
<p>Are you basically leveraging who you are already</p>
<p>to develop a game around the jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>or did jiu-jitsu make you calm?</p>
<p>I think both.</p>
<p>I was always very calm since I was a kid,</p>
<p>you know, since very young.</p>
<p>I was never very, you know, fiery person.</p>
<p>So that is a reflection, you know,</p>
<p>you reflected on my jiu-jitsu, my life,</p>
<p>on my fights, the way I fight.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a direct influence of my personality.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s also in the day, you know,</p>
<p>the more you develop, the more you practice,</p>
<p>the more you fight, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to get nervous.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want the adrenaline in.</p>
<p>So you just learn how to shut that off from your mind.</p>
<p>So the less I thought about it, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like how many times I fought, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the week before the fight,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you start more, when you&rsquo;re concerned the most,</p>
<p>because now it&rsquo;s getting very close.</p>
<p>Before it&rsquo;s just far away.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s normal to think of the tournament.</p>
<p>You get a bit nervous, but it goes away quick.</p>
<p>But the fight, you know, the week before,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re constantly thinking of that day.</p>
<p>And every time you think, adrenaline pumps in,</p>
<p>your heart accelerate, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, it makes it, it&rsquo;s like, why am I feeling this?</p>
<p>What difference will it make?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of, you&rsquo;re shutting that thought</p>
<p>out of your mind, because you don&rsquo;t want to feel</p>
<p>the adrenaline, your heart accelerating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to add you anything.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s the practice also</p>
<p>that I think I, it helped me to shut that off my mind.</p>
<p>Has that helped you in regular life?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s suddenly when you go into any,</p>
<p>any situation that might be stressful, you know,</p>
<p>like an important meeting or super, whatever it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, how much would you worry about that before?</p>
<p>Worry is not going to help you anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>Just going to make you more nervous,</p>
<p>your heart will accelerate.</p>
<p>Your ability to think clearly is going to be</p>
<p>damaged by that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, the more calm, the more relaxed you are,</p>
<p>the better you can think of.</p>
<p>Do you ever get angry?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like in traffic?</p>
<p>Do you ever get like, not calm, just like you&rsquo;re screaming?</p>
<p>Not in a screaming situation, no.</p>
<p>But just angry?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What does angry look like?</p>
<p>Is it still calm?</p>
<p>Yeah, like, you know, a few seconds of complaining,</p>
<p>but then it goes away.</p>
<p>Have you ever like thrown a cell phone at a wall</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Just that.</p>
<p>No, I never get that angry.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s just silly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if I would have done that,</p>
<p>I would not be able to control my emotions prior to a fight.</p>
<p>There would be a lot of reflection.</p>
<p>Letting yourself lose.</p>
<p>Yeah, and losing control that will reflect other times.</p>
<p>Do you think it has, in part,</p>
<p>made you more emotionally closed off from the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder for you to be vulnerable to others?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I heard that a few times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m emotionally closed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>I think that influenced it, yeah.</p>
<p>Have you ever cried in a movie?</p>
<p>Yeah, not for many years,</p>
<p>but for, I think, maybe I&rsquo;m getting older.</p>
<p>Do you remember the movie?</p>
<p>Something, it&rsquo;s a silly movie.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, no, I mean-</p>
<p>Is it The Notebook?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I would say the last few years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been crying more than before for some reason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Like, silly movies.</p>
<p>Like, nothing suddenly brings tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;ve already just,</p>
<p>having met you and interacted with you,</p>
<p>I can see that you&rsquo;re kind of opening</p>
<p>your heart and mind to the world.</p>
<p>You could see, like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this historically great athlete.</p>
<p>Now, like, the wars have been fought,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re now, like, waking up to the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool to see.</p>
<p>Probably, I&rsquo;m bringing my guard down now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to keep it up all the time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to fight.</p>
<p>You can even do some podcasts.</p>
<p>You said you watched, like,</p>
<p>movies beforehand sometimes.</p>
<p>Mentioned Braveheart.</p>
<p>What were you doing?</p>
<p>Did you watch something beforehand?</p>
<p>Like, the day before?</p>
<p>I used to, yeah.</p>
<p>There was, like, I think Braveheart,</p>
<p>and Gladiator.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a few others</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve always watched the day before,</p>
<p>because the day before I used to do nothing.</p>
<p>I just wanna be at home, in bed, watching TV,</p>
<p>like, saving energy, stretching by myself.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s like, I just wanna save energy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna waste my energy going out, going around.</p>
<p>So, you know, those are the movies</p>
<p>that I always like to watch.</p>
<p>Kind of try to bring some, you know,</p>
<p>hyper excitement, like, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready to war tomorrow.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m like, let me watch some movies</p>
<p>that, like, brought that, you know,</p>
<p>some of that warrior spirit into me.</p>
<p>Yeah, what is that about human nature?</p>
<p>Braveheart, I love even more.</p>
<p>Should you put your life on the line</p>
<p>for a thing that matters,</p>
<p>or run away just so you can live?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, running, you may live,</p>
<p>but, like, years from now,</p>
<p>when you look back at this moment,</p>
<p>would you trade all the days</p>
<p>just to come back to this moment?</p>
<p>And tell the English.</p>
<p>You could take our lives,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t take our freedom.</p>
<p>I mean, oh, man.</p>
<p>What is that about human nature?</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of, like,</p>
<p>the glory you were able to achieve</p>
<p>being more important than anything else?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect of that,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s greatness, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, I never pursued glory.</p>
<p>So, it just came, you know,</p>
<p>it came with it, but that was never my goal.</p>
<p>I never cared for glory.</p>
<p>Were you able to experience, like,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m at the height of this thing.</p>
<p>Whatever humanity is able to achieve in various things,</p>
<p>holy shit, I&rsquo;m flying.</p>
<p>I felt like,</p>
<p>no one can touch me.</p>
<p>I can destroy people, yeah.</p>
<p>Prolonged periods of time, or just momentarily?</p>
<p>I always knew, you know,</p>
<p>from before I got to a black belt,</p>
<p>that, like, I can be great,</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>I used to train with the best in the world.</p>
<p>I used to, you know, for many years,</p>
<p>and I used to see my progression with everybody else.</p>
<p>So, I knew I was getting somewhere.</p>
<p>I knew I could be the best.</p>
<p>And that was always my goal since very, very young.</p>
<p>And I always believed that I could be.</p>
<p>And that, over the years,</p>
<p>that kept telling me over and over again,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m getting better and better,</p>
<p>faster than everybody else.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s, I just need to carry on with what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;ve said that you wanted to,</p>
<p>and maybe you thought you could be the greatest of all time,</p>
<p>like, at the very beginning,</p>
<p>like, when you sucked.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, not the greatest of all time,</p>
<p>because, and I never really thought about that,</p>
<p>but I thought, I&rsquo;m gonna be the best in the world</p>
<p>when I sucked, when I sucked.</p>
<p>Okay, so, what is that,</p>
<p>what is that, like, that self-belief?</p>
<p>Is there a component to that self-belief</p>
<p>being a prerequisite?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to say,</p>
<p>because that was a decision, I think.</p>
<p>Like, why did I believe that I could be?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you that, because I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But you think you decided to be?</p>
<p>I decided to be, and I believed I could.</p>
<p>You think there was, like, a day somewhere,</p>
<p>when you were young, where you were like,</p>
<p>huh, you&rsquo;re sitting on a couch, eating Cheetos.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was a day, like, a moment,</p>
<p>because for many years,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really training much as a child.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a bit of, I used to train,</p>
<p>and then stop, done a bit of Judo.</p>
<p>Never stay away from it much,</p>
<p>but until, you know, like, from 10 to 14,</p>
<p>I barely trained Jujitsu much.</p>
<p>I used to, there was no greasy school</p>
<p>near where I used to live,</p>
<p>and I was doing, there was a Jujitsu, a Judo school.</p>
<p>I used to go twice a week.</p>
<p>I went to a Jujitsu tournament.</p>
<p>I lost in five seconds, left crying.</p>
<p>The guy, he pwned me in five seconds.</p>
<p>Anyway, so when I was 14,</p>
<p>I went to the south of Brazil to see my Uncle Helium,</p>
<p>to spend summer holidays.</p>
<p>I was there for, like, four weeks, I think.</p>
<p>And when I got there,</p>
<p>my cousin Hollis was living with him.</p>
<p>Hollis, like, bigger than me.</p>
<p>It was, I think it&rsquo;s four years, four years older.</p>
<p>So I was 14, he was already 18, 17, 18.</p>
<p>Purple belt competitor.</p>
<p>And I think that was the first time in my life</p>
<p>that I felt what it mean, what it meant to be a greasy,</p>
<p>in terms of having a school, teaching, training,</p>
<p>you know, living that, you know, Jujitsu lifestyle,</p>
<p>what a greasy mean to be.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve just, I&rsquo;ve loved it.</p>
<p>I was out of shape.</p>
<p>My uncle was like, you know,</p>
<p>was incentivizing me to lose weight, to train.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not training, why?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re out of shape, you need to diet.</p>
<p>So I used to run every day.</p>
<p>I was eating super well.</p>
<p>I start, you know, I start, that when I start changing.</p>
<p>So when I go back to Rio,</p>
<p>I was super motivated to follow up, carry on.</p>
<p>And he, you know, he invited me to go back there</p>
<p>to live with him, but I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was too soon to change schools and everything.</p>
<p>And my mom said, no, but maybe next year,</p>
<p>if you want to go, you can.</p>
<p>So I kept that in my mind.</p>
<p>Next year, I moved to the South to live with him.</p>
<p>I was 15.</p>
<p>And it was him, my uncle Helion, and my uncle Carlin.</p>
<p>They both used to live very close to each other.</p>
<p>They used to have their own schools close to each other.</p>
<p>So I was with both.</p>
<p>And I stayed there for almost a year.</p>
<p>I mean, I was the youngest in the academy.</p>
<p>There was some, you know, blue, purple belts, normal guy,</p>
<p>but already competing, training ahead of me.</p>
<p>And I just joined the group of training.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t compete while I was there</p>
<p>because there was no competition back then.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t really ready, but it&rsquo;s not about competing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about the training.</p>
<p>And I start training every day, start improving.</p>
<p>And a year after that, when I came back to Rio,</p>
<p>I was already on a mission.</p>
<p>I was like, I love this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just carrying on training every day</p>
<p>with my uncle Carlos, Carlos Gracie Jr., Gracie Barra.</p>
<p>And then when I got there,</p>
<p>I was training a little bit there before,</p>
<p>but I just 14, 15.</p>
<p>But when I got there, there was a, you know,</p>
<p>there was one of, that was one of the most competitors,</p>
<p>one of the biggest Jiu-Jitsu schools at the time.</p>
<p>There was so many high-level world champions,</p>
<p>competitors in every single belt.</p>
<p>And so, and I&rsquo;ve kind of joined in with that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve carried on, I don&rsquo;t remember when,</p>
<p>but I remember, you know, looking and saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be the best in the world.</p>
<p>But I used to be, I was at the bottom of the stairs,</p>
<p>you know, no one really believed me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t shout, you know, to the skies,</p>
<p>but, you know, I told a few people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m gonna be the best.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think, I was just losing,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never, ever doubt,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never diverged from that mission, I would say.</p>
<p>Did anyone believe you when you said you&rsquo;re gonna be great?</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care, I don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>Even people that like love you?</p>
<p>Everybody, my mom, my dad, I mean, no one thought,</p>
<p>no one in my family thought I was gonna be here today.</p>
<p>Nobody, because I just started late.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve never had any start that people,</p>
<p>oh, that kid&rsquo;s gonna be really good.</p>
<p>You know, I was a chubby kid that didn&rsquo;t barely train.</p>
<p>I mean, people used to look at me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just another Greece, this, you know, what more?</p>
<p>What do you learn from that?</p>
<p>Do you think most people lose that self-belief?</p>
<p>They quit when everyone around them doesn&rsquo;t believe?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think if those that need approval, yes.</p>
<p>I see you shouldn&rsquo;t have approval.</p>
<p>I never need approval from anyone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you believe me or not,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not my problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need approval, but you&rsquo;re surrounded</p>
<p>by people older, wiser, better than you,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of directly or indirectly saying,</p>
<p>you stop being silly, kid.</p>
<p>No, no one ever told me that,</p>
<p>because that was not something</p>
<p>that I used to say all the time.</p>
<p>I maybe say it just very, very few times.</p>
<p>I just, well, you know, maybe that&rsquo;s the secret.</p>
<p>Of course, I mean, if you start shouting,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re just being silly.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s not what you really want.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that for another reasons,</p>
<p>if you say it over and over again,</p>
<p>because you shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, why?</p>
<p>Well, to push back, one of the reasons</p>
<p>you might want to say it is to find</p>
<p>the right people that believe in you.</p>
<p>Yeah, but no, if you say it over and over again,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s just, then you&rsquo;re just bragging.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Because one thing is to say it,</p>
<p>but the other one is to do it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, you say it once or very few times,</p>
<p>but now you have to do it,</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s not helping you getting there.</p>
<p>Was there sacrifices you had to make?</p>
<p>Everything, everything.</p>
<p>That was my priority in life.</p>
<p>Everything was secondary.</p>
<p>Like social life?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Career paths?</p>
<p>Yeah, everything.</p>
<p>And is it from 14, 15, 16,</p>
<p>as you get better and better and better and better,</p>
<p>it was just becoming sharper, the focus on this thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just over and over again,</p>
<p>over and over again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just training, training, training.</p>
<p>And I mean, how many times I lost, I have no clue.</p>
<p>So on the mat, you were getting beat up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting smashed by everybody.</p>
<p>People my age, I was chubby, I was physically weak.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m tall, but physically,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not physically strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m normally strong for my size,</p>
<p>but physically, if you want to measure strength, I&rsquo;m weak.</p>
<p>Because we can measure strength lifting weights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m weak.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t lift.</p>
<p>I lift weight, same as people much lighter than me.</p>
<p>Everybody my weight, lifts heavier weights than me.</p>
<p>And the people that train with you</p>
<p>often talk about how strong you are.</p>
<p>They sound super strong.</p>
<p>Because I generate a lot of strength.</p>
<p>I can create, I put myself in the right angles.</p>
<p>So then I can be strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not strong.</p>
<p>And the only person who I listen to saying that</p>
<p>is Comprido, one guy that I fought, Rodrigo Medeiros.</p>
<p>I fought him a few times.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the only one that I heard saying about me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, no, Roger&rsquo;s not strong.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s technical and he can create strength,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not strong.</p>
<p>He meant that as a compliment?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>No, I think he was honest,</p>
<p>because I think he&rsquo;s the only one who could see that.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a compliment.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s technically really strong.</p>
<p>So you had incredible matches with him.</p>
<p>Is there insight you have about how you went</p>
<p>from a person who was not very good,</p>
<p>but had a dream, a confident dream,</p>
<p>a vision to somebody that was actually good?</p>
<p>Was there something to the practice sessions?</p>
<p>Were you getting reps on a specific techniques?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never done anything special,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m in a gym training equally with everybody else.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never did anything on the side</p>
<p>different than anybody else.</p>
<p>So I was in the school training</p>
<p>the exact the same way as everybody else.</p>
<p>Well, in terms of schedule, yes.</p>
<p>But what was, can you reverse engineer</p>
<p>what was going through your mind?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so many different ways</p>
<p>to actually mentally approach</p>
<p>the same exact training session.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try to beat you.</p>
<p>Okay, so in some part it&rsquo;s competitive.</p>
<p>Like at the core of it is I want to be better</p>
<p>than these particular people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna keep beating me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna keep coming back at you.</p>
<p>And to do that, I have to solve problems.</p>
<p>I have to figure out how to do stuff well.</p>
<p>You catch me once, I&rsquo;m gonna keep on coming,</p>
<p>trying to not get caught in that.</p>
<p>At which point did you develop a game</p>
<p>that was basically the famous white belt game</p>
<p>of the very basics, the very fundamentals of jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>Like saying, I&rsquo;m going to beat you.</p>
<p>Never, there was never a conscious decision</p>
<p>to try to have a basic jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>First, I think there&rsquo;s a big misconception there.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s the misconception?</p>
<p>My jiu-jitsu is not basic.</p>
<p>Mr. Roger Gracie, it&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not basic, it&rsquo;s not old school.</p>
<p>No, I think people, they just don&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely complex.</p>
<p>In a way that people, they cannot copy.</p>
<p>I teach people, you know, I can teach you</p>
<p>the cross-collar choke.</p>
<p>But the one thing that people, they don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is not the move, is you need to practice</p>
<p>the move until you learn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the practice over and over again.</p>
<p>Like it took me years.</p>
<p>When I say years, I&rsquo;m like years after I was a black belt,</p>
<p>I was able to choke people out</p>
<p>with a cross-collar choke in the mouth, effectively.</p>
<p>Years after I got my black belt.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that you learn first day, first week.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t teach you, it makes no difference.</p>
<p>You know the theory, but until you apply it in them,</p>
<p>it will help you, of course, the more details you learn,</p>
<p>you know, the more tools you have to practice,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still very complex.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not about the move itself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about how can you control the movement</p>
<p>of the other person?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s resisting, you&rsquo;re blocking,</p>
<p>you cannot predict what he would do,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s doing a whole bunch of moves to block you.</p>
<p>Every single move you do, step of the way,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a progression of move from beginning to end</p>
<p>till I apply the choke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a progression of move, and there&rsquo;s not one way</p>
<p>to get that, there&rsquo;s many ways,</p>
<p>because how many ways can you block?</p>
<p>You can put your arm in every single angle,</p>
<p>we have both arms, you can bridge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s dealing with all that,</p>
<p>that is the complexity of the position.</p>
<p>But that goes for everything, like every single move,</p>
<p>my strong moves, I would say,</p>
<p>it took me years developing them, years.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, and you&rsquo;re gonna tell me that&rsquo;s basic?</p>
<p>So go try and do it.</p>
<p>What the other person is defending, that&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>because most of the things that I do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing them for years.</p>
<p>And they know that I&rsquo;m gonna do,</p>
<p>and I can still get it most of the times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hardest, is when they know what&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>and you can still do it.</p>
<p>And you said that the way you&rsquo;re able to do that,</p>
<p>you just have to do it right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you learn by doing all the steps along the way?</p>
<p>And just for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>cross-collar choke from the mount.</p>
<p>So Jiu-Jitsu starts in a neutral place,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people on their feet,</p>
<p>and then you either, then you get to the ground somehow,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the person on top and on bottom,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a guard with the legs</p>
<p>between the two people, and then you can get past the guard.</p>
<p>As you get past the guard and you,</p>
<p>into side control and so on,</p>
<p>you get more and more and more dominant positions.</p>
<p>And so mount is considered to be</p>
<p>one of the most dominant positions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re past their legs,</p>
<p>sitting on top of their stomach,</p>
<p>putting pressure on them.</p>
<p>And cross-collar choke is using their jacket to,</p>
<p>how would you explain that?</p>
<p>To choke them with their jacket.</p>
<p>So you have the collars,</p>
<p>I put my both hands on your collars,</p>
<p>and when I squeeze, you press your neck,</p>
<p>so it blocks the vein, you go to sleep.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, you choke people with your hands,</p>
<p>and the wrist, you put them, you know,</p>
<p>you grab the collars, you get the wrist</p>
<p>around people&rsquo;s neck, and you squeeze.</p>
<p>Yeah, the discovery of that is fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, because it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, you can imagine</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways to choke a human being.</p>
<p>What animals do it with their, like, mouth, right?</p>
<p>They put, like, their jaws around the,</p>
<p>and the fact that you can kind of discover this methodology</p>
<p>of the right kind of positioning,</p>
<p>and then it becomes an art form,</p>
<p>like, of why this?</p>
<p>Why not this, right?</p>
<p>Or why not this or something?</p>
<p>Like, to figure all that out.</p>
<p>We practice, that will come easy.</p>
<p>Over time, you figure out what works and what not,</p>
<p>and then more, further and further details</p>
<p>and subtleties start to emerge.</p>
<p>Anyway, on that process of beating,</p>
<p>of being able to beat some of the best people in the world,</p>
<p>and the thing they know is coming,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between the White Belt doing that</p>
<p>and Hodger Gracie doing that,</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s so hard to explain?</p>
<p>What do you think you&rsquo;re picking up?</p>
<p>Is it some tiny, tiny details of muscle movements?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s many tiny details,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the whole movement itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the perception from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Like, every step of that movement,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important and precise.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, you miss one detail on the way,</p>
<p>you collapse.</p>
<p>So when I say it with the Black Belt,</p>
<p>the Black Belt has no control over the whole movement.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s thinking beginning and end.</p>
<p>So he goes straight to your, you know, straight to your neck,</p>
<p>regardless, he cannot read the other person.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s, you know, if it&rsquo;s time to let go,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the time to go for a neck,</p>
<p>should I be pushing here before I get my hand in?</p>
<p>You know, is this the right time to go deep,</p>
<p>or should I deal with this first before the second hand?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at the beginning.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s at the White Belt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of the journey.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The White Belt, you just think, finish.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then, as you get progressed,</p>
<p>you see that there&rsquo;s like this giant tree of possibilities</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re almost feeling your way down.</p>
<p>I mean, would you be able to teach?</p>
<p>Do you even know what you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>By the details.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to convert into words, probably.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Then you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what is the most important details</p>
<p>that you could say, maybe positioning of the hand,</p>
<p>the gripping, is it the positioning of your body,</p>
<p>the posture?</p>
<p>Is there some interesting insights that people research?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination, because first,</p>
<p>you have to put your body in a very strong position</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t require your hands to hold them out.</p>
<p>So the choke is that first,</p>
<p>because I cannot use my hands on the floor</p>
<p>to stop you escaping.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if I have to, my body has to handle that.</p>
<p>The way I position myself,</p>
<p>I have to do it in a way that don&rsquo;t require my hands</p>
<p>for balance.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Why is the mouth such a dominant position?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, right?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re just sitting on top of the stomach of a person.</p>
<p>It makes all sense.</p>
<p>If you think, forget fighting, forget jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;ve never trained.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the one position, the most dominant position</p>
<p>you can get over another human being?</p>
<p>One, the most.</p>
<p>For you, which one it is?</p>
<p>Like, the most dominant position</p>
<p>that you can get over another human being.</p>
<p>So if we were just,</p>
<p>because the way I think about it is putting myself</p>
<p>in like a six, seven, eight-year-old self</p>
<p>without knowing any martial arts,</p>
<p>and I had an older brother who&rsquo;d beat the shit out of me.</p>
<p>Yeah, it probably was mouth.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>But, well, yes.</p>
<p>Okay, so we both didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But if we knew something, it&rsquo;d probably be back control.</p>
<p>If in the back control, you&rsquo;re under the other person,</p>
<p>do you think being under is the most dominant position</p>
<p>you can be over another person?</p>
<p>You mean like a back control?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m on your back.</p>
<p>Oh, like that.</p>
<p>You can move, you can roll.</p>
<p>I cannot stop you rolling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe you can even stand up.</p>
<p>How dominant is that?</p>
<p>Yeah, but if we&rsquo;re the same size,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re both untrained.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Have you seen kids, they do that.</p>
<p>Okay, mouth looks and feels like dominance</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re two eight-year-olds fighting.</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it feels that way.</p>
<p>It could be some animalistic thing.</p>
<p>Maybe it is actual dominance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it feels like if you&rsquo;re untrained,</p>
<p>you can just buck your way out of it.</p>
<p>It feels unstable.</p>
<p>It feels unstable to hold mouth</p>
<p>unless you know what you&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re mouth, you put both of your hands on the floor.</p>
<p>Just your hands.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s easy to take somebody off?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe not.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s easy to remove the hand and bring them out?</p>
<p>The hands on the floor, arms straight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaning in.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t need to know fighting</p>
<p>to hold yourself there.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>When you take the arms off and balancing,</p>
<p>then it gets tricky.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>I think what happens, I&rsquo;m thinking back to eight-year-old.</p>
<p>My brother&rsquo;s five years older than me,</p>
<p>and he would do the usual stop-hitting-yourself thing.</p>
<p>I think he would be in mouth,</p>
<p>like hitting me with my own hands.</p>
<p>Out of place of love, of course.</p>
<p>I love him deeply, and it was very formative</p>
<p>and a positive experience for me.</p>
<p>Okay, I think, yeah, the weakness is when he takes,</p>
<p>well, when the person who has you in mouth</p>
<p>takes their arms off to do something.</p>
<p>But even if you keep your hands up in the air,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m falling.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m falling, so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking about untrained people.</p>
<p>I feel like they get greedy.</p>
<p>They try to do stuff.</p>
<p>The other day, I watched my nine-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a friend&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of kids there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>And when I looked, she&rsquo;s mounting a boy,</p>
<p>her age, her size.</p>
<p>He cannot escape.</p>
<p>Wow, she probably has seen some footage.</p>
<p>No, she trains.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been training for, I&rsquo;ll say, a year and a half.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s a nine-year-old daughter,</p>
<p>a girl over a boy.</p>
<p>Has she seen footage of you?</p>
<p>Maybe she picked up from that.</p>
<p>No, but she&rsquo;s been training for a year and a half,</p>
<p>so she has an idea what mount is.</p>
<p>But, I mean, in terms about skills,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t never taught her the mount.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She has, you know, she had lessons at the academy,</p>
<p>like any other kid.</p>
<p>Did she make him cry, or?</p>
<p>No, but he couldn&rsquo;t escape.</p>
<p>Which other position would she be able to hold the boy?</p>
<p>In the back, he would roll her out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like, he couldn&rsquo;t come out from underneath her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re kids.</p>
<p>Like, there is no other most dominant position</p>
<p>that you can pin the other person.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t you argue, from that perspective, side control?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Because side control, you have to hold the other person.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re not free.</p>
<p>You cannot release them.</p>
<p>But in side control, your hips are not on top of theirs.</p>
<p>So, they can&rsquo;t buck you off, right?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you, if you&rsquo;re holding them a little bit,</p>
<p>and you can hit them with one hand, like slapping.</p>
<p>His head is here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna hurt him here.</p>
<p>By the time you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>but then he has his arms free.</p>
<p>And if you turn towards your legs,</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;s away from your arms.</p>
<p>He not even has the perfect angle.</p>
<p>I mean, it is a good position.</p>
<p>You can hit, you can dominate.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not the best position to be over the other person.</p>
<p>He can knee you in the head.</p>
<p>At the same time you&rsquo;re punching,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a knee coming to your head.</p>
<p>I love playing devil&rsquo;s advocate with Roger Gracie</p>
<p>about two eight-year-olds fighting.</p>
<p>And your head is closer to his head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe he can throw you a punch.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, would you choose to be in side control of a mount?</p>
<p>Getting in the head?</p>
<p>Well, for a person who, in competition,</p>
<p>prefers knee on belly over mount.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my weakness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my failure as a human being.</p>
<p>Holding mount can be tricky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>But what is easy?</p>
<p>Tell me easy.</p>
<p>Side control and knee on belly is easier.</p>
<p>But to submit-</p>
<p>Knee on belly is easy.</p>
<p>Easier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying black belt level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, well, maybe even black belt level.</p>
<p>Easier for what?</p>
<p>To hold somebody?</p>
<p>To make them squirm and hurt.</p>
<p>To create openings.</p>
<p>Yeah, but go to there with a big guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna push you back and come up.</p>
<p>In the mount, he can&rsquo;t sit up.</p>
<p>Not when you&rsquo;re mounted him.</p>
<p>The thing is also about mount</p>
<p>is people on the bottom of mount panic more.</p>
<p>So, they fight harder.</p>
<p>Of course they panic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re exposed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most exposure you have.</p>
<p>Because the person&rsquo;s arms are free.</p>
<p>You cannot touch him.</p>
<p>His head is too high.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing he can do.</p>
<p>His legs won&rsquo;t get you anywhere.</p>
<p>He might touch your lower back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like nothing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re most exposed being in the mount.</p>
<p>I read you holding side control a thousand times</p>
<p>the amount of me having to look up</p>
<p>for your fist come down on me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Side control.</p>
<p>I hug you.</p>
<p>You cannot hurt me.</p>
<p>Okay, you hold me, but I&rsquo;m hugging you.</p>
<p>If I hug you tight, what can you do against me?</p>
<p>Hold.</p>
<p>It seems maybe it&rsquo;s just from,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m arguing just for the fun of it,</p>
<p>but it seems like a more difficult skill to learn</p>
<p>to apply a huge amount of pressure and weight from mount.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to apply pressure and weight from mount.</p>
<p>Not apply pressure, but be heavy, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to be heavy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why do you, as people say, you feel extremely heavy?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m being heavy, I cannot attack.</p>
<p>I have to choose.</p>
<p>I can be heavy just to pin them,</p>
<p>take the energy out to make them suffer,</p>
<p>but the moment that I decide to attack,</p>
<p>I can only be heavy if I&rsquo;m sitting up straight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when all my weight drops down.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m high, then I&rsquo;m sitting on your chest,</p>
<p>on your solar plexus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the worst position to be seated on the person</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where he breathes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in a high mount, sitting up straight,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you can, I can be very heavy.</p>
<p>I can make people feel my weight and be very uncomfortable,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not in a position to attack.</p>
<p>The moment that I wanna attack, my body has to lean forward.</p>
<p>I have to approach the neck or the arms.</p>
<p>The moment that I do that, my weight comes off my hips.</p>
<p>It goes to my knees.</p>
<p>The weight is off you.</p>
<p>But at that point, if you have-</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m attacking, I&rsquo;m no longer heavy on you.</p>
<p>But you want to be at that point</p>
<p>to remove any of the defenses they have</p>
<p>or some of the defenses by getting their elbows.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m like either trying to get your collar</p>
<p>or bringing your elbow across or tuck the armlock.</p>
<p>So what are some interesting details along the way</p>
<p>that are tough to get, to figure out?</p>
<p>What were the big leaps for you from white belt</p>
<p>to the best in the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to attack the neck,</p>
<p>putting one hand in the collar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re priving yourself that hand to place it on the floor.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re vulnerable to get bridged, to get rollover.</p>
<p>Because if your hands are free trying to roll you over,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stopped.</p>
<p>The moment that you put your hand in the person&rsquo;s collar,</p>
<p>now you have to be very careful with your body positioning.</p>
<p>Very careful.</p>
<p>The distribution of the weight.</p>
<p>Yeah, and how high you sit,</p>
<p>how tall your upper body goes.</p>
<p>And then the biggest challenge comes</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re trying the second hand.</p>
<p>For the choke, that&rsquo;s the biggest challenge,</p>
<p>the second hand.</p>
<p>Because you already don&rsquo;t have one hand.</p>
<p>Now you are trying the second hand.</p>
<p>And if one of my hand is in,</p>
<p>you as defending yourself have two hands.</p>
<p>One hand is already on one side.</p>
<p>This side is getting attack.</p>
<p>You have two hands blocking that.</p>
<p>I have one hand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no help for that hand.</p>
<p>I cannot remove anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest challenge.</p>
<p>Getting one hand, getting past you</p>
<p>and not getting rollover.</p>
<p>But I also have two hands on bottom.</p>
<p>I have two hands and can also turn</p>
<p>and do all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And my whole mind and everything</p>
<p>is focused on that second hand.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a big challenge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard, very hard.</p>
<p>Is there an art to getting the first hand</p>
<p>into a place where you-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less of an art because it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say most times I get my first hand in</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re trying some move.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to escape, you&rsquo;re pushing.</p>
<p>I get the first hand in as an opportunity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna sit there for a while.</p>
<p>And now-</p>
<p>And I go as deep as I can.</p>
<p>So the first hand,</p>
<p>because the second hand is the hardest,</p>
<p>I have to compensate the first hand</p>
<p>to be as deep as I can.</p>
<p>If I cannot get the first hand in deep,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t try the second.</p>
<p>I need that first hand deep,</p>
<p>then I go for the second.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s deep and everything is super tight?</p>
<p>Super tight.</p>
<p>The first hand has to be super tight,</p>
<p>otherwise the chance of failing is very big.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Does the opponent usually feel like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re screwed at that point also?</p>
<p>Not as you put in the first hand in.</p>
<p>The moment that I position myself</p>
<p>just prior to attempt the second hand,</p>
<p>I think the way my body is positioned,</p>
<p>the way I&rsquo;m collapsing with my weight</p>
<p>and they feel this like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, this is terrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, how long did it take you to figure out</p>
<p>how to reposition your weight once the first hand is in?</p>
<p>Very quickly,</p>
<p>because we get breached out.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a good feedback loop there.</p>
<p>Yeah, because one mistake you out,</p>
<p>like one off-positioning you out.</p>
<p>But you still have to do that</p>
<p>against the best people in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the way out for most people?</p>
<p>Like if you were in Mount against Przestrza</p>
<p>or some of the best defenses in the world?</p>
<p>The way out is to,</p>
<p>obviously is to defend themselves</p>
<p>and prevent the first hand to get deep.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say the best thing that they could do</p>
<p>is try to change my positioning on the mount</p>
<p>in a way that, you know, push me to a very low mount.</p>
<p>You know, try to change the way I&rsquo;m dominating you</p>
<p>not to be, you know, to get me off the high mount,</p>
<p>pretty much.</p>
<p>Are you always, is it a slow, is it a fast thing</p>
<p>to go from low to fast mount?</p>
<p>Slow, slow, slow, slow.</p>
<p>A high mount.</p>
<p>Slow, very slow.</p>
<p>Because I need to beat your arms,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re holding me down.</p>
<p>And the arms need to come out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slow process.</p>
<p>Okay, and you just, is there like a?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I use my legs against your arms.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s my legs pushing your arms.</p>
<p>But how do you get them,</p>
<p>how do you get your legs into the elbows?</p>
<p>As long as it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it has to come under the tip of your elbow,</p>
<p>because now the legs will start forcing your arms up.</p>
<p>So your legs aren&rsquo;t like spread out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Your elbow cannot get inside my leg,</p>
<p>because that means I&rsquo;m in a very low mount.</p>
<p>And then I cannot attack,</p>
<p>because I cannot ignore that.</p>
<p>Because the moment that I attack,</p>
<p>that will, it will start pushing my leg to push me up.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the secret to getting the second hand in?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways.</p>
<p>Either you go four fingers inside,</p>
<p>which is the hardest,</p>
<p>because the moment that your two hands are defending,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be blocking the, you know, the way.</p>
<p>And I cannot clear and attack two hands against one.</p>
<p>So I go thumb in, I go behind the ear.</p>
<p>So my grip goes, because for you to defend,</p>
<p>you need to get there.</p>
<p>And when you get there,</p>
<p>you elevate your elbow, you expose the arm lock.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And so you put the thumb in,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the dreaded,</p>
<p>like the other person just waits for you to loop</p>
<p>the arm over.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that, this over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, once you get the thumb in, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, but when I&rsquo;m there, it&rsquo;s, if I get the,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re bridging, you know, they&rsquo;re trying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not using their hand to pose.</p>
<p>Now your head is, your head is high.</p>
<p>My head is very close to the floor.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;ve tried to bridge, and you know,</p>
<p>my forehead would touch the floor,</p>
<p>that would be used as a hand.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not on the floor.</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because if it&rsquo;s on the floor, my body&rsquo;s collapse over you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no place for my hand,</p>
<p>for me to work on your neck.</p>
<p>So I need some space between us.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t completely collapse.</p>
<p>Maybe you can bob up and down.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but I try to keep a gap between us.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that pursuit that takes many, many, many, many years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi.</p>
<p>The, doing the simple thing, that&rsquo;s not so simple,</p>
<p>but it kind of looks simple,</p>
<p>of the over and over and over and over and over,</p>
<p>and presumably getting much better.</p>
<p>It becomes very simple.</p>
<p>It becomes very simple.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re picking up details probably along the way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wisdom along the way.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Is that, there&rsquo;s like lessons</p>
<p>that you just kind of accumulate over time.</p>
<p>Like one training session, you&rsquo;ll see maybe,</p>
<p>like the positioning of the thumb,</p>
<p>like this detailed positioning of the thumb</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, okay.</p>
<p>You like load that in.</p>
<p>That would be very basic</p>
<p>because there is not that many different ways.</p>
<p>Maybe one, two.</p>
<p>I just do one.</p>
<p>Any other is not as strong</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s about getting a strong grip on your collar.</p>
<p>I mean, the thumb is,</p>
<p>the thumb goes inside,</p>
<p>is it the thumb in or four fingers in,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s getting a strong grip on the collar.</p>
<p>As long as this is just holding and feeling strong.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just two options.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the dynamic stuff along the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then some of that is timing too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s timing.</p>
<p>Are you also like making people,</p>
<p>like faking them out,</p>
<p>making them think about something else?</p>
<p>No, not at that point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>because I cannot fake anything else at that point</p>
<p>because I will have to change my positioning</p>
<p>to maybe to fake an arm lock.</p>
<p>Then I have to move out from that.</p>
<p>So then I will lose the control I have.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the process towards mastery?</p>
<p>If you were to convert that</p>
<p>to something that generalizes beyond jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>how can you get that good at a simple thing?</p>
<p>Practice.</p>
<p>That simple.</p>
<p>The same exact thing over and over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of how long it will take you.</p>
<p>So all,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, like I said,</p>
<p>look how long it took me.</p>
<p>People give up along the way.</p>
<p>There is intricacies to that journey towards perfection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that do jiu-jitsu for decades</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t get better.</p>
<p>No, because they don&rsquo;t train the way they should.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t train to get better.</p>
<p>They train to get tough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>Most people, they train to get tough, so they are tough.</p>
<p>Like we were talking before,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t practice their weakness.</p>
<p>You want to be good at,</p>
<p>you want to be really good at jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>you have to practice your weakness, not your strength.</p>
<p>You have to practice everything,</p>
<p>but you have to be equally strong in every position.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all exactly the same.</p>
<p>Your guard, top, bottom,</p>
<p>side control, top, bottom, turtle,</p>
<p>half guard, mount, back.</p>
<p>I mean, you pick, take down.</p>
<p>And then you get into details of escaping triangle,</p>
<p>applying the triangle, escaping arm lock,</p>
<p>different scenarios of,</p>
<p>the one thing is defending the arm lock</p>
<p>when you have your arms very close to your body.</p>
<p>The other thing is to defend the arms</p>
<p>when your arm is almost getting,</p>
<p>and then when you got your arm.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many things to practice</p>
<p>that you need to repeat them over and over again</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re confident enough</p>
<p>that when you get there, you have a chance.</p>
<p>And you can do the same kind of thing</p>
<p>for even the final stages of a cross choke from mount.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, like you don&rsquo;t practice</p>
<p>escaping the arm lock with a full arm straight,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>I mean, you practice escaping the arm lock</p>
<p>when he takes your arm,</p>
<p>you have a chance of trying to escape,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t practice.</p>
<p>You know, okay, take my arm.</p>
<p>When I say go, go.</p>
<p>I mean, you got, you know, you pop the arm.</p>
<p>That is like, you get injured doing that.</p>
<p>Escaping the cross collar choke, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, escape not letting the person get there.</p>
<p>You can escape, you can practice escaping triangles</p>
<p>because, you know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you have a way better chance of escaping triangle</p>
<p>than, okay, mount on me, put both hands in my neck.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>You know, don&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best submission in jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>Choke, I would say.</p>
<p>From which position?</p>
<p>If I gave you a billion dollars to start in a position</p>
<p>like in a submission, and you only get the billion,</p>
<p>if you get the submission, which one would you start?</p>
<p>Cross collar choke in the mount.</p>
<p>Cross collar choke in the mount.</p>
<p>Not from the back?</p>
<p>No, you have a better chance escaping from the back.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even with the hooks?</p>
<p>Even with everything.</p>
<p>Do you think some people disagree with you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I have a better escape, I have a better chance</p>
<p>escaping from the back than if you mount on me,</p>
<p>put my hands on my neck.</p>
<p>So, if you were facing yourself,</p>
<p>and I would give you a billion dollars to escape,</p>
<p>you would pick?</p>
<p>From the back.</p>
<p>Thousand times over.</p>
<p>Like, no competition.</p>
<p>But you have like, with hooks, with like a triangle?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Like a body triangle?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Like a thousand times over.</p>
<p>No questions.</p>
<p>So, to you, the mount is a super controlling position?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just?</p>
<p>Because cross collar choke in the mount,</p>
<p>the moment that you put both hands on my neck,</p>
<p>you know, you have to, your arms need to be very close</p>
<p>to your body to attack.</p>
<p>So, that means there&rsquo;s very little space between us.</p>
<p>So, that means there&rsquo;s very little escape space</p>
<p>for you to work on your escape.</p>
<p>And the moment that you cannot bridge,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s suppose I have, you know,</p>
<p>the person has a good mount,</p>
<p>so you cannot bridge him off.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have space to try to work on your defense.</p>
<p>Being in the back, I have all the space around me</p>
<p>to work on my defense, so my arms,</p>
<p>I have the mobility to bring them anywhere.</p>
<p>So, I, because of that,</p>
<p>it gives you and me a much better chance.</p>
<p>And you cannot, I can move my body.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on my back, you cannot pin me.</p>
<p>I cannot take you off my back.</p>
<p>First, I need to defend the choke,</p>
<p>but you have no control over my body.</p>
<p>So, that means there&rsquo;s still a lot of movement</p>
<p>that I can try to use to escape.</p>
<p>In the mount, there&rsquo;s no movement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pinned down, I cannot move,</p>
<p>and I have no space between us to escape.</p>
<p>Well, the argument against that, this is great,</p>
<p>is that on the bottom of mount,</p>
<p>I do have my hands between.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re pinned, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>Between where?</p>
<p>I mean, you could get them in theory.</p>
<p>You could somehow, you could.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no, you can, but then there&rsquo;s no space.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be squeezed between our bodies.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an incredible, if it&rsquo;s an incredible mount.</p>
<p>No, it does not mount.</p>
<p>Like, how, standing.</p>
<p>If I put both hands on your neck,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m gonna go for the cross-collar choke,</p>
<p>after I get my hands in,</p>
<p>the next step is to pull you close to me.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>My arms needs to be close to me.</p>
<p>But I can put, there&rsquo;s the hands that could do something.</p>
<p>They can come in,</p>
<p>but they are very limited space between us.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>No, I mean, to push your body away,</p>
<p>to decrease the power of the choke.</p>
<p>Only if we&rsquo;re standing,</p>
<p>not if your back is against the floor.</p>
<p>Okay, the argument against the mount is,</p>
<p>or the argument for back control</p>
<p>as being the most dominant position is,</p>
<p>even though I have hands,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really use them effectively.</p>
<p>As effective.</p>
<p>Not in the mount.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no space.</p>
<p>In the mount, there&rsquo;s no space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no space.</p>
<p>You can try.</p>
<p>I mean, you can squeeze your hand in.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s still things that you could do,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re so limited.</p>
<p>So, if you polled the 100 best competitors of all time,</p>
<p>what do you think they would answer to that?</p>
<p>Do you think most would agree with you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It will show me their skills, their ability to see.</p>
<p>Okay, so the perfect mount versus the perfect back control.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>For me, I mean, argue with me, like, show me,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not being stubborn, because I&rsquo;m being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being scientific.</p>
<p>Exactly, so explain it to me why the back,</p>
<p>it would be harder, it would be better to your position</p>
<p>to finish than mount.</p>
<p>If you can explain it to me why, I might change my mind.</p>
<p>I was trying to, but I don&rsquo;t have the cred.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a middle school science student</p>
<p>trying to talk to Einstein here.</p>
<p>Okay, besides you, who do you think</p>
<p>is the greatest jiu-jitsu competitor of all time?</p>
<p>Can you make the case for some of them?</p>
<p>Marcelo, Buchecha, Leandro Lowe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to go with Buchecha,</p>
<p>because look at how many titles he has.</p>
<p>I mean, he has by far more than Marcelo.</p>
<p>Marcelo stopped quite early.</p>
<p>Leandro Lowe has eight, but Buchecha is better than him.</p>
<p>What do you think makes Buchecha so good?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a heavyweight that moves like a lightweight.</p>
<p>He moves very fast, but he&rsquo;s very agile for his size.</p>
<p>So the agility combined with aggression.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s very hard to control him</p>
<p>because he moves fast and he&rsquo;s 112 kilos,</p>
<p>115 sometimes, or 110, I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s about around that, so 240 in pounds.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re agile, 240 pounds,</p>
<p>that makes it very hard to control you.</p>
<p>What about making the case for some others?</p>
<p>What about the little guys?</p>
<p>What about Marcelo, if you were to make the case</p>
<p>for him being the strongest?</p>
<p>What makes Marcelo good?</p>
<p>Marcelo Garcia is extremely technical.</p>
<p>I mean, I think he&rsquo;s one of my favorite jiu-jitsu fighters</p>
<p>because in a technical way,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s probably one of the best.</p>
<p>Because raw technique and a bunch of different positions</p>
<p>for submissions.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not very powerful.</p>
<p>Physically, he&rsquo;s not very strong,</p>
<p>but he can make himself very strong</p>
<p>and his technique is very, very high level.</p>
<p>Have you ever trained with him?</p>
<p>No, I fought him twice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s much smaller than me.</p>
<p>What happened in those matches?</p>
<p>The first fight, I tapped him, I think, five minutes.</p>
<p>In which submission?</p>
<p>Choke from the back.</p>
<p>Collar choke from the back.</p>
<p>And the second time, I beat him by points,</p>
<p>but a very large, I think 12-2.</p>
<p>Actually, just to continue,</p>
<p>I wonder if John Donahoe would agree with you</p>
<p>about mountain back.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to, this is a bear versus lion conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking, there&rsquo;s statistics about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not letting this go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s statistics about,</p>
<p>oh, look at that, Hodger.</p>
<p>What do you know?</p>
<p>Looking at Hodger Gracie&rsquo;s statistics</p>
<p>for most successful submissions,</p>
<p>choke from the back is the most.</p>
<p>So how do you explain that, Mr. Scientist?</p>
<p>Because people panic when I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>They turn their back.</p>
<p>I choked them out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one explanation.</p>
<p>But for people, it is interesting that,</p>
<p>of course, this doesn&rsquo;t capture,</p>
<p>but this captures a lot of your major matches.</p>
<p>And we should say that you&rsquo;ve submitted</p>
<p>most of your opponents, so you rarely win on points.</p>
<p>You usually win submissions.</p>
<p>Choke from back is most of them,</p>
<p>then cross choke from mount.</p>
<p>Arm bar is a lot, too.</p>
<p>So 18 from choke from back, 12 cross choke,</p>
<p>10 arm bar, five RNC rear naked is for no gi, okay.</p>
<p>So Ezekiel in there, too.</p>
<p>So in 2000, Ezekiel is very powerful.</p>
<p>I took, he&rsquo;s a strong weapon.</p>
<p>Yeah, also from mount.</p>
<p>Also from mount.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s when you can&rsquo;t get the one hand in.</p>
<p>No, because the Ezekiel most times I use against people</p>
<p>is the attack that as soon as I get to the mount,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re trying to escape the open up,</p>
<p>and I get them.</p>
<p>It has to be at that initial timing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a thing you use to bother them</p>
<p>in order to create.</p>
<p>Either I get it right away,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t bother trying much.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Because you need to keep one hand behind the head,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re naturally on that position</p>
<p>as soon as you mount, most of the times.</p>
<p>And the moment that you mount someone,</p>
<p>no one accept that.</p>
<p>They go mount it, they&rsquo;re gonna explode to get out.</p>
<p>So holding the head, it gives you a better way</p>
<p>to dominate them initially,</p>
<p>to deal with that explosiveness on the initial,</p>
<p>on the beginning.</p>
<p>And then, but then you have to let go to try it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very limited holding the head.</p>
<p>In terms of goats, Shonji,</p>
<p>I feel like he doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit that he deserves.</p>
<p>He had an extremely dominant performance in competition.</p>
<p>What about Salo and Shonji Hibero?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about what makes them so good?</p>
<p>He had a bunch of tough matches with Shonji.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Salo.</p>
<p>Eight times.</p>
<p>Yeah, fought eight times, Shonji.</p>
<p>I fought Salo once.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m bringing up a sore point.</p>
<p>Oh, did Shonji tap when you,</p>
<p>or did the time run out in that,</p>
<p>was the last time you guys faced each other?</p>
<p>Yeah, 2008.</p>
<p>That was incredible to watch also.</p>
<p>I think you pulled guard with one minute left</p>
<p>working towards attacking.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s probably very tough to get anything.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s a very good fighter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very tough to get anything.</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>time ran out, you had something that looked like</p>
<p>an arm lock, and Shonji looked like he may be tapping.</p>
<p>But it looked like he might be just celebrating,</p>
<p>which is most likely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>It was, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Because I think his arm was just,</p>
<p>just straight his arm time finish.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure if he was tapping</p>
<p>to let go, time&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>Or because I would say most likely the time was up.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also, there&rsquo;s a thing where you start,</p>
<p>you realize there&rsquo;s only three, two seconds left.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s to kind of start celebrating.</p>
<p>You realize that Hadji&rsquo;s not gonna be able</p>
<p>to finish this arm bar in the time left.</p>
<p>So you start celebrating.</p>
<p>No, I think he tapped to say the time is up.</p>
<p>The time is up.</p>
<p>Anyway, what do you think,</p>
<p>like the longevity especially is impressive</p>
<p>with Shonji?</p>
<p>How long?</p>
<p>I think he doesn&rsquo;t get credit as much as he deserves</p>
<p>because he pushed his career very far.</p>
<p>And the last few years, he was on his best.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, if he would have stopped before,</p>
<p>people would remember him on his highest.</p>
<p>But he kind of pushed more than his peak</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>How hard is it for you to walk away?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about the journey into MMA as well.</p>
<p>But you basically, especially with the second match</p>
<p>against Bucceschi, basically walked away on top.</p>
<p>Beating arguably the greatest competitor of all time.</p>
<p>And just walking away.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that hard to be honest</p>
<p>because that was something that I was considering</p>
<p>for a while.</p>
<p>Because the last few years of my career, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>it was fighting MMA at the same time as fighting jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very challenging to do both.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s not another person who ever did that</p>
<p>because the training is a confliction</p>
<p>with the way you train.</p>
<p>Everybody who start doing MMA, start focusing MMA,</p>
<p>their jiu-jitsu gets worse</p>
<p>because they stopped training with the game.</p>
<p>Everybody, no exception.</p>
<p>Was your jiu-jitsu also getting worse?</p>
<p>No, because I made sure I kept training with the gi</p>
<p>and I kept fighting at least the world championship</p>
<p>once a year.</p>
<p>That was my goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m going to go for MMA.</p>
<p>But I love jiu-jitsu and I still want to fight</p>
<p>the highest level.</p>
<p>So I kept fighting once a year for a few years.</p>
<p>It was a challenge, especially because</p>
<p>the two or three times when I competed at the world&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it was right after MMA fight I had.</p>
<p>And no gi, you don&rsquo;t have the grips.</p>
<p>So my grips, it made a big difference on my grips.</p>
<p>So I was weaker grip-wise.</p>
<p>So I felt that.</p>
<p>So I knew it was like, it&rsquo;s unnecessary risk</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not, if I cannot be a hundred percent,</p>
<p>so why am I doing this?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m stubborn, I love jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, I love fighting jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>I never loved MMA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve liked it, but I think if all grace,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it.</p>
<p>So the thing you felt the most is the grips.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you won a gi world championship without gripping.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Like just pretending it&rsquo;s no gi match,</p>
<p>they get to grip you, but you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So grips are essential.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>How can you choke someone?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, if your grips are weak,</p>
<p>your forearms will fatigue,</p>
<p>and then you will have no power,</p>
<p>and then you cannot do anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You could still arm lock, and you could&hellip;</p>
<p>So I meant more not for the submission,</p>
<p>but for the control, the game of it, the dance.</p>
<p>But you need to grip to get there.</p>
<p>To get there.</p>
<p>And if your grips are weak&hellip;</p>
<p>But you also have grips in no gi.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you use those grips?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This is a thought experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand how essential&hellip;</p>
<p>When I get a no gi guy go far with the gi, they panic.</p>
<p>They panic?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Everyone panics.</p>
<p>A bear panics when they&rsquo;re in the water with a shark,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the bear can&rsquo;t still win</p>
<p>when it stops panicking and relaxes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another discussion.</p>
<p>Can a bear beat a shark in the water?</p>
<p>Actually, I need to, maybe a polar bear,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re pretty good at swimming.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I say not possible for the no gi guy to win.</p>
<p>Bears is a further discussion.</p>
<p>What was, to you,</p>
<p>the biggest difference between mixed martial arts</p>
<p>and jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>What are some interesting differences,</p>
<p>some interesting insights,</p>
<p>even just about the grappling within both sports?</p>
<p>So the biggest difference for me between MMA and jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>is first is the speed.</p>
<p>Like jiu-jitsu, like a 10-minute match,</p>
<p>I can take my time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no dangers that forces me to move fast.</p>
<p>MMA, you have to be 100% sharp and fast</p>
<p>from the first second of the fight,</p>
<p>because punches are coming.</p>
<p>You can get knocked out any time.</p>
<p>One mistake, you&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>Jiu-jitsu, you don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about quick submission,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all about the way my body&rsquo;s positioned.</p>
<p>You know, my grips.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to avoid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to see it coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a quick submission, a surprise.</p>
<p>It only works if you make a mistake,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not correct positionally.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely difficult.</p>
<p>MMA, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I mean, one split-second mistake,</p>
<p>and when the person comes, you have to respond.</p>
<p>You have to match his pace.</p>
<p>I mean, you can slow down,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re forced to respond.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not much fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more physical, a lot more,</p>
<p>and you need to be physical,</p>
<p>much better conditioning, faster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s explosiveness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much harder.</p>
<p>Is it possible in the MMA to calm things down?</p>
<p>If they change the rules, yeah.</p>
<p>Five-minute rules, no.</p>
<p>Ah, I see.</p>
<p>So like, I just meant actually technically speaking,</p>
<p>is there ways to take an opponent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being exceptionally aggressive?</p>
<p>You can, clinch.</p>
<p>Clinch.</p>
<p>But then he takes you down, he keeps moving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s hard to control that pace.</p>
<p>You can.</p>
<p>If you play defense, you save more energy</p>
<p>than if you try to be the aggressor and respond.</p>
<p>And even getting to the clinch is very difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have no way to hold yourself there.</p>
<p>So that was the biggest challenge for me in MMA,</p>
<p>is the speed, because I&rsquo;m a very slow start fighter.</p>
<p>If you look at my matches, I start very slow,</p>
<p>because if I go hard, you know, I fatigue faster.</p>
<p>So for me, that was the hardest part of,</p>
<p>is to start fast.</p>
<p>What about on the ground?</p>
<p>Is there something different,</p>
<p>more challenging on the ground?</p>
<p>Being in the bottom, yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s punches, punch coming.</p>
<p>How fundamentally different is Jiu-Jitsu</p>
<p>with punches on the ground?</p>
<p>Ah, it changes everything.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Which parts?</p>
<p>The distance that you allow your opponent to be on you,</p>
<p>the techniques that you choose to apply.</p>
<p>You know, you have to,</p>
<p>your body has to be aware of the punches,</p>
<p>and you are a lot more limited on your attacks.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re known for your close guards.</p>
<p>How does your close guard have to adjust?</p>
<p>How does the positioning of your hands have to adjust</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on the bottom of close guard?</p>
<p>So in the guard, especially in the close guard,</p>
<p>you have to either keep the person very close to you,</p>
<p>or you have to kick him away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the guard, is either I&rsquo;m hugging you,</p>
<p>or get away from me.</p>
<p>And in Jiu-Jitsu, you&rsquo;re allowed to have a middle?</p>
<p>Yeah, in Jiu-Jitsu, there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t allow the person to be.</p>
<p>What about getting a arm lock</p>
<p>or a triangle submissions from the guard?</p>
<p>Is that fundamentally different</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have the middle game?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much harder.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s barely no open guard in MMA, very little.</p>
<p>Because open guard, there&rsquo;s a distance between you and him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a distance you cannot control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much harder to control that punch coming.</p>
<p>And I have to position myself away to block that,</p>
<p>and it limited my attacks, my options of attacks.</p>
<p>Is there a reason, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think you do open guard much</p>
<p>in Jiu-Jitsu and No Gi.</p>
<p>Is there a reason for that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder with the explosive person</p>
<p>because when they&rsquo;re moving fast,</p>
<p>then you have to try to slow them down.</p>
<p>So you like guards that allow you to control the person?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And closed guard is the ultimate control?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ultimate control,</p>
<p>but closed guard puts you in a position</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m attacking and you&rsquo;re defending.</p>
<p>You cannot attack me from my closed guard.</p>
<p>We can argue that there might be one or two attacks,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like very, very, very limited</p>
<p>and depends who you&rsquo;re fighting against.</p>
<p>I hate the closed guard.</p>
<p>Being on top against a good closed guard is very-</p>
<p>No one likes, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one-sided.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in the guard and it&rsquo;s one-sided.</p>
<p>The person in the bottom has the advantage.</p>
<p>I can be completely relaxed in my closed guard,</p>
<p>and I cannot be completely relaxed.</p>
<p>You know what the most annoying thing is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somebody who is both good</p>
<p>and extremely confident with a closed guard</p>
<p>because they have that smug energy about them.</p>
<p>They know how much unpleasant,</p>
<p>how much work it takes to pass this.</p>
<p>Anyway, especially people with longer legs.</p>
<p>Is there something you wish you did differently</p>
<p>in how you started training at MMA in that trajectory</p>
<p>in figuring out how to train, how to get good?</p>
<p>Like what have you learned about getting good at MMA?</p>
<p>From having done it.</p>
<p>If you were to start now, for example.</p>
<p>I think I would have to dedicate it more.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t dedicate enough.</p>
<p>Both like literally time, number of training sessions-</p>
<p>Training, yeah.</p>
<p>But also mental-</p>
<p>Training-wise, physical.</p>
<p>I think a lot more the physical part of it.</p>
<p>The strikes, everything?</p>
<p>The strike from the beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because, I mean, I love jujitsu.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, I truly love all the aspects of it.</p>
<p>Fighting, training, the practice, the competition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that for MMA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to give your heart to it,</p>
<p>something that you don&rsquo;t have the passion to it.</p>
<p>Like jujitsu, I gave my heart to it.</p>
<p>Like I did everything that I had to.</p>
<p>MMA, I never, I didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it was,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say it was wrong for me to do it</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t regret doing it.</p>
<p>I mean, I always, looking back as a kid</p>
<p>when I decided to be, to take jujitsu for life,</p>
<p>I already knew that some point I would have to do MMA.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost like that&rsquo;s the path of a Gracie.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re ready, you go do MMA.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>So there was like a duty versus a love.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was not a choice.</p>
<p>There was like, I have to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the life I took, it will lead that way.</p>
<p>Are you proud of that step?</p>
<p>You know, go against the natural love</p>
<p>and towards more duty?</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t regret it</p>
<p>because if I hadn&rsquo;t done it,</p>
<p>I would feel there was something missing.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t regret doing, I would regret not doing.</p>
<p>The tricky thing is the choice to go to MMA</p>
<p>could have compromised your ability</p>
<p>to win against Brxesha and it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a fascinating case study.</p>
<p>It still doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me</p>
<p>that after all those years, you&rsquo;re able to come back</p>
<p>and go against the best person in the world and beat him.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I had to because the first fight we had,</p>
<p>I had something stuck in my throat for a long time.</p>
<p>So you think about that?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, as soon as that first fight finished,</p>
<p>I had said, that got stuck in my throat</p>
<p>that I already, at that point, I knew</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to fight him again.</p>
<p>I knew.</p>
<p>I always knew.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no choice, I have to.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>All right, well, in terms of Nogi,</p>
<p>who do you think is the best Nogi competitor of all time?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question, you know, it&rsquo;s Gordon.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to say</p>
<p>the best competitor of all time</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s still very young.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something that he can be angry</p>
<p>in the end of when the person.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want him to get lazy.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, but you cannot praise someone</p>
<p>in the middle of his career, you know?</p>
<p>So you cannot call him the best ever.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 26 or 27.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I mean, he&rsquo;s great, he&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ahead of all of other competitors, I think.</p>
<p>And I mean, he&rsquo;s having an amazing career.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s doing amazingly well.</p>
<p>So I mean, when he&rsquo;s, when he finish,</p>
<p>when he finally retired, then you can argue like.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wisdom in that.</p>
<p>It matters how you finish, right?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I think that Nogi is relative new, that Nogi scene.</p>
<p>There was not, there wasn&rsquo;t a scene before.</p>
<p>I think he started now on his generation, you know,</p>
<p>his time.</p>
<p>Because before, like when I was competing,</p>
<p>Nogi was just ADCC.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else.</p>
<p>Every two years, first was only in the Emirates.</p>
<p>You know, you had to go there to compete.</p>
<p>So there was not even a scene.</p>
<p>It was like this one tournament that gives a lot of money</p>
<p>to, you know, to competitors, to fighters.</p>
<p>And brings fighters from other modalities.</p>
<p>You know, Marker, Van Narsdale, you know,</p>
<p>some wrestlers, Greco Roman, you know,</p>
<p>that can compete against each other.</p>
<p>And they, you know, they create that set of rules,</p>
<p>try not to favor anyone.</p>
<p>So that was it.</p>
<p>So you cannot be called the greatest Nogi of all time</p>
<p>if you only have one tournament every two years.</p>
<p>Only in Emirates, they have to be invited to.</p>
<p>But I think now, you know, it grew a lot.</p>
<p>Now we have so many different tournaments.</p>
<p>Now we have a scene.</p>
<p>You have people that only train Nogi,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fully dedicated to Nogi.</p>
<p>And you have supervised different tournaments.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s, you know, now it&rsquo;s professionally.</p>
<p>You can do just Nogi now, which before was unheard of.</p>
<p>Because you have one or two tournaments.</p>
<p>If you cannot be called a Nogi fighter,</p>
<p>fighting once every two years.</p>
<p>Twice every two years.</p>
<p>Yeah, now there&rsquo;s entire systems</p>
<p>that are optimized for Nogi</p>
<p>that could be fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Like what do you think about the body lock?</p>
<p>Like this passing with the body lock.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you get an understanding of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a popular way to, what is it?</p>
<p>Maybe to apply.</p>
<p>To stay tight.</p>
<p>To stay tight.</p>
<p>Very close to your opponent.</p>
<p>So he can&rsquo;t push great distance.</p>
<p>He can push away.</p>
<p>But somehow it shuts down the hips as well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Makes it more difficult to defend.</p>
<p>Yeah, kind of trap your legs.</p>
<p>You see, your back is stuck against the floor.</p>
<p>Are you like scientifically curious</p>
<p>about these new developments?</p>
<p>Do you think, do you have answers in your head to them?</p>
<p>Most.</p>
<p>So body lock is one interesting one.</p>
<p>Obviously foot locks is another.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll mean just the foot locks,</p>
<p>but the whole like control aspect of foot locks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other interesting stuff.</p>
<p>John is really into the wrestling.</p>
<p>But not wrestling, wrestling, but wrestling everywhere.</p>
<p>Jiu-Jitsu at all levels of the plane.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>because obviously Jiu-Jitsu has not really been,</p>
<p>you know, unlike like freestyle wrestling and so on,</p>
<p>has not been like a systematic, scientific,</p>
<p>rigorous exploration of wrestling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re on your feet and you&rsquo;re on the ground.</p>
<p>Not into mixed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interest.</p>
<p>John is academic.</p>
<p>He tried to, you know, numbers, mathematic, everything.</p>
<p>You kind of are too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I am,</p>
<p>because you have to understand what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>everything there&rsquo;s a step-by-step,</p>
<p>like logistic, like details.</p>
<p>Every single move, there&rsquo;s a reason for it.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s things around that happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, the more you know, the better you are, right?</p>
<p>The more knowledgeable, or competitor, or whatever.</p>
<p>So I think with the foot locks, with the Nogi,</p>
<p>like if you look back,</p>
<p>you know, if you think of,</p>
<p>used to be seen as a really bad thing to attack the foot.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t seen as a good options of attack.</p>
<p>Mainly.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Respectable gentlemen don&rsquo;t attack the leg, or what?</p>
<p>No, because if you look back,</p>
<p>you know, the tournaments, when they were created,</p>
<p>all the rules and everything else was to simulate</p>
<p>a real fight with no punches, when I was having Nogi.</p>
<p>I mean, if you ask, what is Jiu-Jitsu?</p>
<p>Like, what are you trying?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the main goal of Jiu-Jitsu?</p>
<p>To dominate your opponent.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the main goal of fighting?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re fighting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, of course, submission is the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>But the, you know, before that,</p>
<p>the main goal is to dominate you.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re fighting, I have to dominate you.</p>
<p>And then the submission comes.</p>
<p>And foot locks, it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t require any domination on you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to be in a dominant position</p>
<p>to attack your foot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, if I attack your foot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still free to knock me out.</p>
<p>If your body goes down to my foot,</p>
<p>I can still come close to you or stand up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll punch you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a good position to be in a real fight.</p>
<p>Yeah, to attack in the foot.</p>
<p>I mean, how many times you&rsquo;ve seen that going bad?</p>
<p>That going bad in an MMA fight?</p>
<p>I mean, of course you had, you know,</p>
<p>some sort of success with the hooker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no questions.</p>
<p>But how many times went wrong?</p>
<p>People were knocked out attacking the foot.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s the best position to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to go,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very high risky position to go.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not in a real situation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not seen as a good thing.</p>
<p>So when you translate that to Jiu-Jitsu,</p>
<p>when attacking the foot,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not seen as a good thing</p>
<p>because when you reflect that to a real situation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna go down well.</p>
<p>So it was always seen as a easy way out,</p>
<p>you know, easy cut.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to do the easy path.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pass my guard,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t dominate me,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re trying to attack my foot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it was always seen as a,</p>
<p>you know, not as the best,</p>
<p>a great submission, a way to win.</p>
<p>But the sad side effect of that</p>
<p>is it was completely underdeveloped because of that.</p>
<p>Exactly, of course.</p>
<p>So people never really developed that.</p>
<p>But now, the tournaments, the fighting,</p>
<p>it got completely,</p>
<p>not completely, but it got some,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not longer seen as,</p>
<p>you know, as a simulation of the real thing.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a sport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only seen as a sport.</p>
<p>So now it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If you attack my foot, you cannot punch me.</p>
<p>So why is it bad now to attack the foot?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not seen as a bad thing anymore.</p>
<p>And now it got really developed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another bear versus shark question.</p>
<p>But, you know, there is,</p>
<p>in a street self-defense situation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to imagine where foot locks</p>
<p>would be effective for Haile.</p>
<p>But I guess if you invest 10,000 hours,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to invest it in chokes.</p>
<p>Yeah, to dominate.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m, you know, if I were fighting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way better for me to be on your side,</p>
<p>control on the mount,</p>
<p>where I can pin you, be completely safe,</p>
<p>than to stay inside your legs,</p>
<p>trying to attack your foot.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>People would argue that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of very dominant controlling positions</p>
<p>in the whole foot lock game, right?</p>
<p>It is, but it can go bad very quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I mean, there&rsquo;s some great ways</p>
<p>to control someone that he cannot escape,</p>
<p>but it can go bad very quickly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Well, even back control can go bad</p>
<p>very quickly on the street.</p>
<p>So mount, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is mount a really good position?</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s no good position then.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no good position.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no-</p>
<p>Every position, there&rsquo;s a risk, okay?</p>
<p>Attacking the foot is a way higher risk</p>
<p>than side control, mount, back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>the back is not the best way to pin someone,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re underneath me.</p>
<p>Because if you try to rotate,</p>
<p>I can sacrifice the back</p>
<p>and just let you pin the mount.</p>
<p>Okay, there you go.</p>
<p>Would you prefer mount or back mount</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re flattened?</p>
<p>Like a-</p>
<p>Still mount.</p>
<p>Thought I&rsquo;d get you.</p>
<p>So yeah, going back to Gordon,</p>
<p>what do you think makes that guy so good?</p>
<p>We were just at ADCC,</p>
<p>we get to see him historically dominant performance.</p>
<p>His dedication, the way he trains,</p>
<p>and how much he trains.</p>
<p>And of course you have to add his mind,</p>
<p>his belief to really try to be good,</p>
<p>the best, or you know, I don&rsquo;t know what his goals are,</p>
<p>but I know he tries to be better than his opponents.</p>
<p>So his belief are very strong.</p>
<p>His dedication, he probably trains more than everybody else.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t seen firsthand it,</p>
<p>but from what I hear interviews with him</p>
<p>and everybody else training,</p>
<p>and you know, the way everybody trains.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, trying to, for my little knowledge I have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet he trains more than everybody else.</p>
<p>And most important, how he trains.</p>
<p>And when I, I kind of already knew,</p>
<p>but when I heard John podcast with you the other day,</p>
<p>John was explaining the preparation,</p>
<p>the training for the ADCC,</p>
<p>and that kind of gave me a very strong idea</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;ve been training all these years.</p>
<p>So, you know, when we said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you have to work on your weakness,</p>
<p>so you have no weakness.</p>
<p>He trains a lot on his weakness,</p>
<p>which not everyone does that.</p>
<p>You know, if you look all the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to name, but you know,</p>
<p>all the main schools, when like very strong competitors,</p>
<p>great competitors, super tough people,</p>
<p>but super tough, not great,</p>
<p>because they train, they spar very hard.</p>
<p>That makes them tough.</p>
<p>If you want to be good,</p>
<p>you have to work on your weakness,</p>
<p>because when you spar, like we&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>how many times you&rsquo;re going to practice</p>
<p>escaping a bad position,</p>
<p>like a submission hold or a pinning position,</p>
<p>side control, mount,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very little the amount time you get to spend</p>
<p>on those positions if you don&rsquo;t start there.</p>
<p>So that, he&rsquo;s very smart the way he trains.</p>
<p>And part of that is also cerebral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just putting yourself in those positions,</p>
<p>but talking through different ideas.</p>
<p>Like they talk, they like experiment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very like, at first glance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like philosophical almost,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to create systems constantly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to understand</p>
<p>how this fits into this big picture.</p>
<p>And then he goes back to what is fighting.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fighting for dominance.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s fighting for the ultimate dominance positions,</p>
<p>which is back and mount.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no others.</p>
<p>And from that, you finish.</p>
<p>So if you look back at his,</p>
<p>you know, over the years of his past fights,</p>
<p>before he used to mainly focus in legs,</p>
<p>and over the past few years,</p>
<p>now he&rsquo;s mainly focusing in finishing from the mountain back.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s when he became really good.</p>
<p>So part of that is Mr. John Donahart.</p>
<p>What do you think, you&rsquo;ve known John for a long time.</p>
<p>What makes that guy interesting, special, and good?</p>
<p>What have you learned about jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>and life from John Donahart?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super smart.</p>
<p>I mean, eccentric.</p>
<p>And he lives through jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 24-7 thinking better ways to teach,</p>
<p>how to make his competitors better.</p>
<p>And that as a coach,</p>
<p>when you have that dedication as a coach,</p>
<p>that it makes the most difference of your athletes.</p>
<p>Like, which other big team will have that coach</p>
<p>with that motivation?</p>
<p>All the other schools,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either someone that competes,</p>
<p>that push the training, like Andre Galvao.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s one of the competitors.</p>
<p>So he brings the hype in everyone else,</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t have the time.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t spend the time working individually.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure he does,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s limited because he&rsquo;s also a competitor.</p>
<p>And, you know, looking most of the other big schools,</p>
<p>like, you don&rsquo;t have that nowadays.</p>
<p>All the leaders, the main coaches</p>
<p>for the other big schools,</p>
<p>they have other things in their lives.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t fully dedicate it to the athletes.</p>
<p>Jonas, you know, look at the interview.</p>
<p>He spends hours and hours a day studying</p>
<p>how can a weight, a system, you know,</p>
<p>to make his athletes better.</p>
<p>Look at the results.</p>
<p>I enjoy just sitting back and forth.</p>
<p>You can actually just get him,</p>
<p>you control him essentially by sending interesting videos</p>
<p>and you could just see his mind.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna do research on that.</p>
<p>Because I kept sending him videos of bears</p>
<p>because he claimed that a lion would beat a bear</p>
<p>because, I&rsquo;d love to get your take on this.</p>
<p>Okay, so the bear is much bigger, much stronger.</p>
<p>But his take is that the bears don&rsquo;t have experience</p>
<p>of fighting to the death.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not part of the culture.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more scared.</p>
<p>In fact, he keeps sending me footage</p>
<p>of like even like a small mountain lion</p>
<p>scaring a bear away because they don&rsquo;t want to fight.</p>
<p>So his idea is that it really matters your life experience,</p>
<p>how much you fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily the skill,</p>
<p>like the dimensions, the characteristics you have.</p>
<p>But then I send him, here I&rsquo;ll show you.</p>
<p>People should Google this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bears fighting of any kind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much the most epic thing ever.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;ll show you.</p>
<p>The cardio, though, is interesting.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I was gonna mention that</p>
<p>because I was flipping through internet.</p>
<p>I came around that video.</p>
<p>Look how big these guys are.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re huge, but see, they don&rsquo;t bite each other.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s just play?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to, no, intimidating</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want to get hurt.</p>
<p>So they try to size each other up.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ll see the whole fighting</p>
<p>is sizing each other up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of pushing.</p>
<p>And the fur is so thick,</p>
<p>so the cloth doesn&rsquo;t really damage much.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using the tree, so maybe they, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there is bites, but see, there&rsquo;s very little.</p>
<p>So the whole time, they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>intimidate the other one,</p>
<p>like winning the fight by their size.</p>
<p>And mostly about, like, the way drunk college kids fight,</p>
<p>which is like some kind of display of dominance</p>
<p>versus actual.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re not fighting to kill.</p>
<p>And bear or tiger, you know, they fight to finish,</p>
<p>unless the other one runs away, like one will die.</p>
<p>Yeah, lions and tigers.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, but look at the cardio.</p>
<p>Look how bad their cardio is.</p>
<p>I wonder how, my favorite part is when one of them</p>
<p>just, like, stands behind a tree and says, all right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s holding.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s getting the breath.</p>
<p>Let me catch my breath.</p>
<p>He sits down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, you can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the equivalent in the forest tapping out.</p>
<p>All right, all right, you got me.</p>
<p>Let me just, let me just catch my breath.</p>
<p>Look, they&rsquo;re both, like, just shot.</p>
<p>And, but see, the thing is that I was trying</p>
<p>to make an argument for is that</p>
<p>we get this rare footage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not rare.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like hundreds of videos,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not millions of videos</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a huge number of bears.</p>
<p>And I was trying to say that there&rsquo;s some bad-ass bear</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know about because he just goes in there</p>
<p>and just does work.</p>
<p>And we just don&rsquo;t know about it because he&rsquo;s, like,</p>
<p>everyone, see, the thing is,</p>
<p>if you kill a lot of other animals,</p>
<p>you probably have a territory</p>
<p>that nobody&rsquo;s going to mess with you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to catch the,</p>
<p>the, like, the Hodge and Gracie of bears, you know?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just going to be sitting there doing nothing.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I feel like, of course, when you corner him,</p>
<p>John will say that if you put a bear in a line in a cage,</p>
<p>the bear will win if it&rsquo;s, like,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re forced to be to the death, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Oh, let me ask you another ridiculous thing</p>
<p>before I ask you serious questions.</p>
<p>So Joe Rogan thinks that a tie</p>
<p>is an effective way to attack somebody.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, I can&rsquo;t believe I haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>in the time in Vegas, I didn&rsquo;t talk to you about this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Have you ever explored this?</p>
<p>As the best choker in the world,</p>
<p>have you ever explored the use,</p>
<p>because, like, Jiu-Jitsu has the jacket,</p>
<p>but the tie, to me, is a pretty shitty way</p>
<p>to choke somebody.</p>
<p>Intuitively, it thinks like it&rsquo;s a good way,</p>
<p>but it can slide around.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s no way to really pin.</p>
<p>You would need to.</p>
<p>Right, so you use it the way you use a belt, essentially.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then-</p>
<p>I would guess so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and I think if it gives you,</p>
<p>it actually has the reverse effect,</p>
<p>which it gives you the false sense of confidence</p>
<p>that you can use it,</p>
<p>and instead it&rsquo;ll just distract you.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s a stronger way than the collar?</p>
<p>Or just a stronger-</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Stronger than the collar?</p>
<p>Stronger than the collar, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how.</p>
<p>Maybe, I just, I can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>Well, in a street fight scenario, right?</p>
<p>By the time you grab the tie,</p>
<p>the guy goes punch your nose.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What George St. Pierre thinks</p>
<p>is the best use of the tie</p>
<p>is to actually, what do you call that?</p>
<p>So, basically, to off-balance them,</p>
<p>which is an interesting point,</p>
<p>to push that down.</p>
<p>That can be used to, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you could use the jacket</p>
<p>for the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really fully tested it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say jacket or tie,</p>
<p>for that perspective of off-balancing the person,</p>
<p>it can be, yeah.</p>
<p>Because you have control of the person&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>The collar, the jacket moves.</p>
<p>So for the purpose of off-balancing the person,</p>
<p>I would agree with George.</p>
<p>See, the thing is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing about martial arts,</p>
<p>is you can say all kinds of bullshit,</p>
<p>but until you really test it in over a period of years,</p>
<p>the competition, you won&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where my gut says,</p>
<p>just how easily the tie moves,</p>
<p>my gut says the collar.</p>
<p>There is something really powerful about the jacket.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the way it sits.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that the arms trap it from rotating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird piece of clothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really dangerous piece of clothing</p>
<p>that we put on ourselves.</p>
<p>Like, and it&rsquo;s kind of cool</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve developed this whole martial arts system</p>
<p>that allows you to use that to do a lot of damage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re saying something that you develop</p>
<p>over the years or practice over and over again,</p>
<p>going back to the efficiency of the mount or back,</p>
<p>by experience of attacking people,</p>
<p>people always had a much higher chance of escaping</p>
<p>from the back than from my mount.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I feel if I mount and you get both my hands</p>
<p>on your neck, you cannot escape.</p>
<p>If my hands are deep, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t remember anyone escaping,</p>
<p>but I do remember if my hands are deep on your collar</p>
<p>or even a real naked choke, it&rsquo;s still a hassle.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not clean.</p>
<p>You have some data on this.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect to how your body is,</p>
<p>the characteristics of your body</p>
<p>that fits a particular set of techniques?</p>
<p>So if we just look at jiu-jitsu broadly,</p>
<p>do you see most techniques being able to work</p>
<p>for most people?</p>
<p>Like, what you&rsquo;re saying about mount versus back control,</p>
<p>is it possible for a different body type,</p>
<p>the mount is not as effective?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say very big people, they should mount.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think of yourself as big?</p>
<p>No, big, I mean fat.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>They should stay off the mount.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a counterintuitive question.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s mobility, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think that, you know, you don&rsquo;t see any,</p>
<p>you know, like there was a few ways,</p>
<p>like 160 kilo, like, you know, in pounds.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 270 pounds of a lot of fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you need a bit of mobility,</p>
<p>and that would, it would play against you.</p>
<p>So great.</p>
<p>Even back.</p>
<p>Even back is the same.</p>
<p>A great mount requires mobility.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Even though it doesn&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;re moving very much</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing mount, that requires mobility?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you have to reposition and weight redistribution.</p>
<p>Constantly adjusting your body.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The legend goes, you got very good by training</p>
<p>mostly with lower ranks.</p>
<p>What was your training like in that environment?</p>
<p>So when I first moved to London, I was 20 years old.</p>
<p>I opened my school there, and I had nobody to train with.</p>
<p>I had one guy that was teaching with me,</p>
<p>a black belt, middleweight.</p>
<p>He was good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Braulio was, he moved to the same,</p>
<p>he moved to England the same time as I did,</p>
<p>but he was in Birmingham.</p>
<p>So we did got together, you know, maybe twice a week,</p>
<p>close to, you know, when we were preparing for something.</p>
<p>If not, then not very often.</p>
<p>As often as we could, but let&rsquo;s say not that often.</p>
<p>And I had just color belt students.</p>
<p>There was no one high level,</p>
<p>there was no one world champion in any belt to train.</p>
<p>Then you need to create a scenario that simulates,</p>
<p>that can simulate, you know, like a realistic fighting.</p>
<p>So I think on that aspect, you know, when people said,</p>
<p>you know, people ask, why do I have such a basic game?</p>
<p>I think that also influenced me sharpen up all my skills</p>
<p>when I moved there.</p>
<p>Because, you know, if you practice with people,</p>
<p>you know, lower level than you, you cannot,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to learn from them.</p>
<p>Or, you know, you can learn things and practice with them,</p>
<p>but I would say very complex things on them,</p>
<p>it is not the best.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I sharpen up all my skills.</p>
<p>So, you know, that when I really improved everything</p>
<p>that I already knew to a higher level.</p>
<p>But how can you sharpen something</p>
<p>if the resistance is much lower level than?</p>
<p>A purple belt can makes it very hard</p>
<p>for you to skip side control.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have to be a world champion black belt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, if it&rsquo;s one is holding you,</p>
<p>it can be very hard.</p>
<p>What about on the attack?</p>
<p>How do you become literally by far the best person</p>
<p>at the cross choke from mount</p>
<p>by training with purple belts?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes purple belts defense</p>
<p>way better than black belts.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>See, a lot of people listening to that would be like,</p>
<p>that makes no sense, Hajo Gracie.</p>
<p>How does that make any sense?</p>
<p>Because like a lot of the black belts,</p>
<p>even world champion, they get to the black belt,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really good in what they do.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say in the guard, you know,</p>
<p>on top or the bottom position, but their defense are not.</p>
<p>Like very, very few people, high level,</p>
<p>have a very good defense because they don&rsquo;t practice.</p>
<p>Then that goes back to how you train.</p>
<p>You know, you can be very tough.</p>
<p>Very tough will make you terrible defense</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not gonna practice your weakness.</p>
<p>So your weakness still gonna be terrible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have the best guard in the world.</p>
<p>Impossible to pass.</p>
<p>The day people pass your guard, you&rsquo;re nothing.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, your guard is high, the highest level,</p>
<p>but your side control defense are not.</p>
<p>Your mount defense are not.</p>
<p>So some purple belts, they practice the mount</p>
<p>way more than the black belt did,</p>
<p>so naturally their defense is better.</p>
<p>So they get to experience the defensive position</p>
<p>much, much, much more, and especially training with you,</p>
<p>they get really good at defending.</p>
<p>And then over and over again,</p>
<p>you attack them with the same thing over and over again,</p>
<p>and they know what&rsquo;s coming, they will block.</p>
<p>They will develop a defense over that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Way better than most other high level black belts.</p>
<p>So both put yourself into really bad positions</p>
<p>with lower ranks and just keep attacking the same way</p>
<p>over and over and over.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And with that, you&rsquo;re able to be at the top of the world,</p>
<p>at the world championships.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, can you give some,</p>
<p>what was the preparation like to a world championship</p>
<p>with lower ranks?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>I did a lot of boxing, a lot of conditioning.</p>
<p>No, but the-</p>
<p>Conditioning is a big part of it.</p>
<p>But the one thing that helped me extremely</p>
<p>living in England, in London,</p>
<p>was training judo at the Budokai in London.</p>
<p>That helped me massively</p>
<p>because it gave me the motivation to learn something new</p>
<p>because by then at the Budokai,</p>
<p>the standup was, I&rsquo;m sure today it is too,</p>
<p>but by then was even higher than it is today.</p>
<p>Like there was some very high level judo guys</p>
<p>training there.</p>
<p>And I mean, the first time I went there,</p>
<p>my standup was terrible compared to theirs.</p>
<p>I mean, it was bad, but compared to them, it was terrible.</p>
<p>So I was getting thrown like a child.</p>
<p>And that motivate me to keep coming back and get better.</p>
<p>So that made my jiu-jitsu much stronger.</p>
<p>I became, my base got better, my top game improved,</p>
<p>my pressure game improved.</p>
<p>Did, does Neil Adams train?</p>
<p>Ray Stevens.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve never met Neil Adams.</p>
<p>Have you met Neil Adams?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the voice of judo.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you watched the tournaments.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, Ray Stevens is a silver medalist in the Olympics.</p>
<p>He won European, he won a lot.</p>
<p>So you did some judo training.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite throw?</p>
<p>Like a soto, like you don&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>Uchimata, I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>Uchimata.</p>
<p>If I would pick one.</p>
<p>So that made you better at jiu-jitsu as well?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And back then, like for the first,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say maybe three years, maybe four,</p>
<p>I went to Brazil for like two months before</p>
<p>every major tournament.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So I say, you know, I moved away from the school</p>
<p>and I really focused, so I was really well prepared</p>
<p>with my judo and everything else,</p>
<p>sharpening up my skills and then went to Brazil</p>
<p>to train with like really high level people.</p>
<p>So that way I would manage to compete in the highest level.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start with a complete beginner.</p>
<p>So, you know, a bunch of people come up to me</p>
<p>and they still want to start doing jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>What advice would you give them?</p>
<p>Try to absorb as much technique as you can</p>
<p>and try to be as relaxed as you can.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, you know, don&rsquo;t desperately try to fight so hard.</p>
<p>Like learn and move slow.</p>
<p>Move slow and relax.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hardest thing to do, the hardest.</p>
<p>You know what I find with people,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s hard to even know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not relaxed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the introspection.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even know what it feels like to relax.</p>
<p>Not even know the tense.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>They try to relax, they look at you, say,</p>
<p>what, what do you mean relax?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m relaxed.</p>
<p>You feel it.</p>
<p>And in terms of going slow, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, well, I&rsquo;m going slow.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a grace and elegance of movement</p>
<p>that you can probably pick up from a lot of other disciplines.</p>
<p>Like for me, I think that came from just learning piano</p>
<p>at a young age.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for, I think any mobility thing,</p>
<p>to learn how to move efficiently,</p>
<p>you have to know how to move efficiently.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the hardest thing to do.</p>
<p>To learn how to move efficiently,</p>
<p>you have to know how to relax.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just the fact that you can,</p>
<p>like the body can be tense or it can be relaxed.</p>
<p>Just knowing that fact.</p>
<p>Now imagine your shoulders tense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You think you play piano well?</p>
<p>No, everything has to be relaxed.</p>
<p>I guess some of that is mind too,</p>
<p>but just knowing that and being self-aware.</p>
<p>But see like, even me, you know, approaching a thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t know anything about being a beginner.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to tense up.</p>
<p>And like, it actually takes a conscious effort</p>
<p>to think to relax.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Massively.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why learning things as an adult</p>
<p>is much harder than as a child.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>And as an adult, it&rsquo;s like to get to the highest level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>Because you will never relax the way you should.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Relax in the way that you become like water,</p>
<p>but then you solidify in the right places.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to an adult?</p>
<p>So like somebody that has a job, like a hobbyist,</p>
<p>like how to progress, how to get-</p>
<p>I mean, train, just need to train as much as you can.</p>
<p>Not, you know, five, seven days a week</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to get injured.</p>
<p>I mean, two, three times a week to start</p>
<p>is the best way to, you know,</p>
<p>to initiate your jujitsu journey</p>
<p>and practice the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p>When they don&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just because you&rsquo;re not doing well,</p>
<p>not because, you know, you have to learn something else.</p>
<p>Do you see some value in just picking a set of techniques</p>
<p>that seem to draw your heart in?</p>
<p>Like, for example, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to yell at me,</p>
<p>but I never learned close guard well.</p>
<p>It just never connected with me.</p>
<p>You could say it&rsquo;s body mechanics, whatever.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The point is, it&rsquo;s just like my heart</p>
<p>never connected with it.</p>
<p>You know, the way I justified it to myself</p>
<p>is I felt like when you&rsquo;re bad,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using the close guard,</p>
<p>just like you could use the half guard to stall.</p>
<p>So I was really drawn to the butterfly guard as a beginner</p>
<p>because I thought, or open guard in general,</p>
<p>I have no options to stall, so I&rsquo;m going to learn.</p>
<p>My thinking was, let me do the guard</p>
<p>that enforces me to learn.</p>
<p>And then I fell in love with the butterfly guard</p>
<p>and the open guard and so on.</p>
<p>And I never, I never really understood the close guard.</p>
<p>And the other thinking was,</p>
<p>do I really need to understand the close guard?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s always by choice that I go there.</p>
<p>So I can avoid not really learning.</p>
<p>I mean, you can avoid anything you want.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything.</p>
<p>In this life, yes.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t make you complete.</p>
<p>That means you have a weakness.</p>
<p>But do you want to be complete as a,</p>
<p>this is the question,</p>
<p>how valuable is it to be complete to get good?</p>
<p>Depends how good you want to be.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s several questions there.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, like to be the best in the world,</p>
<p>do you need to be complete?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>The best in the world, of course you have to be complete.</p>
<p>Otherwise you, somebody is going to be better than you.</p>
<p>But what about like, so to understand, to defend,</p>
<p>you have to be also good at the offense</p>
<p>in every single position.</p>
<p>Otherwise you have a weakness</p>
<p>and someone can capitalize on that weakness.</p>
<p>Okay, what about to be like a hobbyist?</p>
<p>Then you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>But can you, or is it still bad?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not bad.</p>
<p>I mean, nothing is bad.</p>
<p>I mean, if you, as a hobbyist, you start late.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how far you&rsquo;re going to get.</p>
<p>As long as you enjoy it, just train as much as you can.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s twice a week, twice a week it is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be limited how good you will be training</p>
<p>twice a week, of course.</p>
<p>Then the guy that trains twice a day.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just, the more you train, the better you get.</p>
<p>But you have to select what you train.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, yes, but like for how long?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some point in your life</p>
<p>that you might try something, see if you like it.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some point in your life</p>
<p>that you might, okay, let me try close guard.</p>
<p>You might not like it now.</p>
<p>Maybe in two, three years from now.</p>
<p>Still don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>I kept trying it.</p>
<p>Listen, because, listen, it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to get any respect in jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get to black belt and beyond in jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>at a respectable place and not have a good close guard.</p>
<p>Close guard is-</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, then don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m being a rebel.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say because it&rsquo;s not a position</p>
<p>that you want the pressure,</p>
<p>that if you don&rsquo;t, no, you&rsquo;ll be in trouble.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be in trouble not to know the close guard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just gonna go straight for open guard.</p>
<p>I mean, the-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a problem.</p>
<p>The main limitation is if you don&rsquo;t do close guard a lot,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t quite,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get a full, complete picture</p>
<p>of understanding how to attack close guard</p>
<p>when somebody puts you into a close guard,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on top.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice to know both sides of it,</p>
<p>just to understand.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can have a pretty good understanding</p>
<p>of how to defend from the top and not having any bottom.</p>
<p>I mean, some of it is also just like</p>
<p>the length of legs and just the geometry of your body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Marcel Garcia has a good close guard, but-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exact, that&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m trying to make.</p>
<p>In theory, you can imagine it.</p>
<p>But for a hobbyist, I think it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>to think of that.</p>
<p>Like, is it possible to,</p>
<p>is it possible to focus on a small set of techniques</p>
<p>that help you to develop?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Still into a good jujitsu player.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>And still enjoy and still be able to be-</p>
<p>Most people hobbies in the jujitsu world, 99%.</p>
<p>I mean, people that compete.</p>
<p>Yeah, even the people that compete and-</p>
<p>1% max.</p>
<p>And you have high-level competitors</p>
<p>have no clue what close guard is.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you for making me do it.</p>
<p>No, I think you would say that most people don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>close guard is such a difficult position to understand.</p>
<p>Maybe one day we&rsquo;ll brainwash.</p>
<p>Yeah, good.</p>
<p>I felt it&rsquo;s too easy to stall versus attack.</p>
<p>That was my main concern.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I wanna be forced in every way</p>
<p>to always be attacking, to always be moving, to always be.</p>
<p>And it felt like, if I got really good,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it happen with half guard too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when people get really good at half guard,</p>
<p>it just feels stall-y.</p>
<p>If you just look at the matches and so on,</p>
<p>you just slow things down to a thing that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get reps on learning.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get action in interesting ways.</p>
<p>So that was my worry, that I&rsquo;ll get old and fat</p>
<p>and just sit in close guard all day,</p>
<p>holding on to the white belts, trying to kill me.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s also, I mean, that&rsquo;s the other thing</p>
<p>for hobbyists and for everyone is to,</p>
<p>like when you first start, I think,</p>
<p>you have to relax in the face of the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just getting your ass kicked nonstop.</p>
<p>That can also be really tough on the ego.</p>
<p>I think probably the right way to see that</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re growing as a person.</p>
<p>You see that clearly when they are like in a bad position,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say side mount or mount.</p>
<p>Like a beginner, he will never relax on those position.</p>
<p>The moment that you say go, they like trying</p>
<p>to push you out and explode.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no relaxation and work on the defense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, it&rsquo;s a out and go until I have zero to give.</p>
<p>Until I&rsquo;m exhausted, my arms cannot move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fun to watch actually.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of drilling?</p>
<p>Do you like drilling?</p>
<p>I do not like drilling, but I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>I think fighting, it&rsquo;s mechanic, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important to drill a move</p>
<p>until you learn the mechanic.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>If someone wanna teach you an arm lock,</p>
<p>you wanna practice that movement</p>
<p>until you learn the mechanic of it,</p>
<p>but the guy&rsquo;s not resisting, so it&rsquo;s easy to apply, right?</p>
<p>So you apply as many times as you have to</p>
<p>until you know the mechanic of the moves,</p>
<p>until you can apply the mechanics.</p>
<p>The moment that you know how to apply,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more point in drilling.</p>
<p>Now you have to practice.</p>
<p>Now you have to practice with resistance.</p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;re not gonna practice</p>
<p>with the guy fully resisting.</p>
<p>The guy&rsquo;s better than you</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not gonna give you a chance</p>
<p>to practice that move,</p>
<p>but you have to practice with resistance.</p>
<p>So where does drilling comes on that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s most of people, they flow drill and everything.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, you&rsquo;re conditioning your body</p>
<p>to do something.</p>
<p>You repeat the same move over and over again.</p>
<p>Your body&rsquo;s conditioning to apply that movement</p>
<p>or that technique.</p>
<p>Drilling is not realistic</p>
<p>because the other person&rsquo;s not resisting.</p>
<p>The flow movement or whatever.</p>
<p>After you go beyond, when you already know the mechanics,</p>
<p>the drilling with no resistance</p>
<p>is not gonna teach you anything</p>
<p>because you will never know how to apply the movement</p>
<p>with resistance.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pointless to carry on drilling</p>
<p>after you learn the mechanics.</p>
<p>See, but you&rsquo;re making it sound easy</p>
<p>to learn the mechanics.</p>
<p>I would argue.</p>
<p>You can drill as many times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not limiting how much you drill.</p>
<p>You drill as long as you had to.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how long.</p>
<p>The benefit of drilling,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just playing devil&rsquo;s advocate with you.</p>
<p>The benefit of drilling is that</p>
<p>you can more efficiently get a higher number of reps in.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What are you gonna gain with those reps?</p>
<p>Understanding the mechanics of the movement.</p>
<p>And what I would like to argue</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t necessarily need resistance</p>
<p>to deeply understand the mechanics of something.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some moves.</p>
<p>Like, I bet you,</p>
<p>you could drill your way to an incredible mount.</p>
<p>Like, mount is a good example of that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really need a resist, what?</p>
<p>I can imagine a world</p>
<p>in which the resisting opponent is not essential</p>
<p>for developing some of the very fine details</p>
<p>of the mechanics.</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know any.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You say mount.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What are you gonna achieve by drilling with no resistance</p>
<p>after you learn the mechanics?</p>
<p>In mount.</p>
<p>But see, what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you,</p>
<p>the learning of the mechanics</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a thing where you get a certificate and you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna learn the fine details</p>
<p>of the way you redistribute your weight.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn how to move your,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand mount, so.</p>
<p>Against a dead body.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, against a dead body.</p>
<p>Like, everything you do is a slow process and timing.</p>
<p>You have to understand moving.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the guy&rsquo;s resisting.</p>
<p>Like, he&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna grab you and apply the movement.</p>
<p>I need to grab you and feel when is the right time to do.</p>
<p>Like, that only comes with movement.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not fully resistant, how would I know?</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t infer through it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a.</p>
<p>With no movement, with no resistance.</p>
<p>Like arm lock.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some resistance.</p>
<p>Okay, arm lock.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say arm lock.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve been drilling for a week.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Five hours a day.</p>
<p>You should be an expert with the mechanics.</p>
<p>But now, are you gonna carry on drilling</p>
<p>with no resistance?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>After that week, drilling five hours a day,</p>
<p>the arm lock, you still have no clue how to apply</p>
<p>the arm lock against a resisting opponent.</p>
<p>No clue, zero.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t know the movement, you know the mechanic.</p>
<p>Which is, you know, it&rsquo;s like how long you have to drill</p>
<p>and how, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It varies of the person.</p>
<p>You can drill for a month.</p>
<p>After that month is over, you should understand</p>
<p>how the mechanic works.</p>
<p>You still have no clue how to apply the movement</p>
<p>against a resisting opponent.</p>
<p>You will never ever know how until you apply</p>
<p>with a fully resisting opponent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way to know, to really learn a movement.</p>
<p>Yes, well put.</p>
<p>But the question is, can you have a small percentage</p>
<p>of time when you go against a resisting opponent</p>
<p>to get the wisdom and the insight of what it takes</p>
<p>to perform that movement and you spend a large percentage</p>
<p>of other time just practicing the mechanics of it?</p>
<p>So like, do you need to, as you get better and better</p>
<p>at technique, to basically drift away completely</p>
<p>from drilling and more into the sparring?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to, I just.</p>
<p>You like drilling?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t like drilling.</p>
<p>Well, yes, I like drilling, I would say.</p>
<p>But I just see, it always bothered me</p>
<p>in the jiu-jitsu community how few people</p>
<p>really saw the value of drilling.</p>
<p>I see it in wrestling, especially in the Russian style</p>
<p>of wrestling, like the value of drilling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that it&rsquo;s like a dead body</p>
<p>or like a dummy or something like that,</p>
<p>but just getting the reps in, really focusing</p>
<p>on the high amount of reps.</p>
<p>I agree in wrestling and judo.</p>
<p>I agree that drilling is very important.</p>
<p>Initial drill, 1,000 times each move.</p>
<p>Yeah, judo&rsquo;s a really big one for that too.</p>
<p>It is, because it&rsquo;s the movement, the timing,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s the precision of the movement.</p>
<p>It has to be perfectly, because it&rsquo;s one movement.</p>
<p>Then you learn about the timing of the movement</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re fighting, but during fighting,</p>
<p>you only need to know the time,</p>
<p>because your body movement is exactly the same</p>
<p>when you drill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really well put, yeah.</p>
<p>The mechanics is much more important there.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s completely different for jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s say from jiu-jitsu, like the arm lock,</p>
<p>for example, we use that as an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say from the close guard, even my close guard.</p>
<p>Before I go for the arm lock,</p>
<p>I need to have a set of grips.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have your collar and your arm, right?</p>
<p>And then, you know, when you&rsquo;re drilling,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna grab your arm, I&rsquo;m gonna grab your collar,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna drill my body</p>
<p>until I can apply the arm lock and finish.</p>
<p>And I can do that 1,000 times.</p>
<p>Okay, now we&rsquo;re fighting, we start with the grip.</p>
<p>The moment that I initiate the arm lock attack,</p>
<p>you will defend, the arm lock will not work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the one movement</p>
<p>that will get me to attack the arm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a combination of other things that I need to do.</p>
<p>I need to feel about your weight.</p>
<p>You know, I need to get you close to me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many other things involved</p>
<p>that I need to feel that only comes</p>
<p>with a fully resistant opponent.</p>
<p>Yeah, so pretty quickly, it has to be live.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then it comes how you practice, how you train.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting on that position and just saying, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>And the moment that we disengage from that position,</p>
<p>we go back, that&rsquo;s when you really learn.</p>
<p>Because everything that you do wrong,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go back there and you&rsquo;re gonna try again,</p>
<p>try again, try again.</p>
<p>And the repetition, it will teach you,</p>
<p>have a feeling of timing, when to go.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s other combinations,</p>
<p>which you always has, to go with it.</p>
<p>By the way, for the internet that&rsquo;s currently yelling at me</p>
<p>for arguing with Haja Gracie about drilling,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called playing devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>to strengthen, to explore ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually arguing.</p>
<p>Okay, I forgot to ask you,</p>
<p>if you had to fight against the bear, lion,</p>
<p>gorilla, or anaconda to the death,</p>
<p>which one would you choose</p>
<p>and would you be able actually to win against any of them?</p>
<p>A bear, a lion, a tiger, or anaconda?</p>
<p>Oh, a gorilla too, gorilla.</p>
<p>You can go gorilla.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably choose the anaconda.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not allowed to run away though.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in a cage.</p>
<p>Do you have to kill?</p>
<p>Still the anaconda.</p>
<p>So the other one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think I have no chance against any other ones.</p>
<p>Zero chance, that&rsquo;s what John thinks.</p>
<p>I think-</p>
<p>I have a tiny little against the anaconda.</p>
<p>I just wait it out.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to be,</p>
<p>I just, it feels like technique</p>
<p>can do something against these animals,</p>
<p>but they have so much strength, so much aggression.</p>
<p>You know, the real naked joke,</p>
<p>translating to Portuguese, is kill the lion.</p>
<p>So ever since I was a kid,</p>
<p>I always thought that maybe if I get behind a lion,</p>
<p>the real naked joke, which, you know,</p>
<p>in Portuguese it says, mata le√£o.</p>
<p>So mata le√£o means kill the lion.</p>
<p>So I always thought that that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>to kill a lion, or to, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re fighting against a lion,</p>
<p>you go behind and put the real naked joke,</p>
<p>I think you put him to sleep,</p>
<p>the name mata le√£o is like kill the lion.</p>
<p>Someone came up with the name.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Somebody must have.</p>
<p>Maybe someone went to a fight with a lion,</p>
<p>choked him up.</p>
<p>There you go, John, there you go.</p>
<p>I honestly, do you think,</p>
<p>or so actually, yeah,</p>
<p>you understand controlling positions.</p>
<p>Do you think an animal like a gorilla</p>
<p>or a lion would shake you off?</p>
<p>If you had back full, you&rsquo;re locked in.</p>
<p>Well, say the one that&rsquo;ll have the biggest chance</p>
<p>of staying there is the lion,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the thinner body.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s smaller than a tiger, I guess.</p>
<p>Think tigers are bigger?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So do you think they can shake you off, though?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll have a bigger chance of staying</p>
<p>against a lion&rsquo;s back than any other animal.</p>
<p>Still not answering the question.</p>
<p>Do you think you have a chance?</p>
<p>If I start on the back?</p>
<p>Yeah, start full, locked in, full controls.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a small enough lion</p>
<p>that you can actually have a full.</p>
<p>I would guess so.</p>
<p>I mean, I would like to believe so.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, just like you said,</p>
<p>somebody must have been able to do it.</p>
<p>Throughout your journey in jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>have there been low points?</p>
<p>Like, has there been points</p>
<p>where you really doubted yourself?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve never really doubted myself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s low points in defeats.</p>
<p>Those are the low points, when I lost.</p>
<p>How did you deal with defeats?</p>
<p>I just went back to the gym next week</p>
<p>and say, I need to get better.</p>
<p>That every time I lost, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I need to get better,</p>
<p>because I need to choke them out.</p>
<p>I need to submit them,</p>
<p>because, you know, win by points.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, as a black belt,</p>
<p>I have very little loss, I would say.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t like to sound like a crying baby,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll say most of those loss</p>
<p>was very, very controversial.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was not a dominant, clear performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about referees and points and so on.</p>
<p>Everything, since I was very young,</p>
<p>I always fought against my opponent and the referee.</p>
<p>Like, if there was ever in my whole life,</p>
<p>since I was a kid,</p>
<p>there was ever a doubt,</p>
<p>they always go to my opponent.</p>
<p>Always, always.</p>
<p>That was just something that I had to deal with</p>
<p>my whole life.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the motivation behind,</p>
<p>what led to the fact that you win most of your matches</p>
<p>by submission or in dominance?</p>
<p>Like, are you chasing?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the only way to prove you better.</p>
<p>And I never fought to win tournaments.</p>
<p>That was never my goal.</p>
<p>That was the consequence of me trying to be the best.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t care how many titles I have.</p>
<p>I care about, I need to beat all my opponents.</p>
<p>And not win, because win is not enough.</p>
<p>I have to submit them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way to prove I&rsquo;m the best,</p>
<p>to submit them.</p>
<p>If I win by advantage or at a point,</p>
<p>that means I was better than them that day.</p>
<p>That does not mean I&rsquo;m better than them.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s no way to stay top,</p>
<p>if I take you down, pass your guard,</p>
<p>mount you and submit you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s zero questions who&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s nothing you can say about it.</p>
<p>If I foot sweep you,</p>
<p>you put your butt on the floor,</p>
<p>I get an advantage,</p>
<p>we carry on fighting and I win,</p>
<p>means nothing.</p>
<p>Not even means I&rsquo;m better than you.</p>
<p>And if that happened, that would haunt you.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be happy.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young folks</p>
<p>who look at you,</p>
<p>who are able to accomplish from a place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not very good,</p>
<p>to becoming the best in the world at a thing?</p>
<p>What advice would you give them</p>
<p>to have a journey like that?</p>
<p>To have a journey where they could be successful</p>
<p>in their career and their life</p>
<p>to such a high level?</p>
<p>Determination is the most important thing.</p>
<p>You need to know where you&rsquo;re going to get there.</p>
<p>So you need to have a goal,</p>
<p>which whatever that goal is,</p>
<p>like you need to set that goal for yourself</p>
<p>so you know where you wanna go.</p>
<p>And to have the determination to get there</p>
<p>and be sure that you will fail many times.</p>
<p>You cannot let your failures bring you down</p>
<p>because you will fail many times.</p>
<p>Everybody does.</p>
<p>So you said you didn&rsquo;t look to external sources of belief.</p>
<p>You just believed in yourself.</p>
<p>Is there something to that</p>
<p>where you have to try to</p>
<p>be your own source of belief,</p>
<p>flame the fire within yourself?</p>
<p>Was that something difficult to do?</p>
<p>That was just very natural for me.</p>
<p>I said you can surround yourself with great people.</p>
<p>That is extremely important.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t surround yourself with failures</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not gonna push you to,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what it is, how to get there.</p>
<p>Everybody knows,</p>
<p>but when you surround yourself with winners,</p>
<p>you will know what it took them to get there.</p>
<p>Use them as an example.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a certain kind of aura</p>
<p>to people that just achieve great things</p>
<p>and being around them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s hard to find people that,</p>
<p>especially at that early stage.</p>
<p>Any area.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Any area.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, greatness has a certain,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s almost humbling just to see,</p>
<p>okay, any human,</p>
<p>like at least that&rsquo;s a lesson I learned.</p>
<p>Almost any human can do, can be great.</p>
<p>I mean, one, I&rsquo;ve used Muhammad Ali as a great example.</p>
<p>Look at his belief.</p>
<p>Look at how much he believed himself</p>
<p>before he was Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>Look at the determination he had,</p>
<p>the way, the confidence he had fighting,</p>
<p>even on his loss.</p>
<p>That never changed him.</p>
<p>Not when he fought Foreman, George Foreman.</p>
<p>Not one person in the world</p>
<p>thought he was gonna win that fight by himself.</p>
<p>He never doubted himself.</p>
<p>Everybody else did.</p>
<p>He won over all odds against.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I mean, when you look at people like that,</p>
<p>you can, you don&rsquo;t have to be a boxer</p>
<p>to try to follow his example.</p>
<p>But see, those are like epic, giant battles.</p>
<p>But I feel like you fight the same kind of battle</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re young and your parents tell you that,</p>
<p>you know, just with their whole energy,</p>
<p>that this is silly, don&rsquo;t be silly,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be silly to chase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder, it is harder.</p>
<p>But as a kid, it&rsquo;s harder to deal with that</p>
<p>because, I mean, to go against adults,</p>
<p>especially parents telling you otherwise,</p>
<p>like the amount of strength you need is gigantic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how much strength you need</p>
<p>because that was not my case.</p>
<p>So I can understand what you have to go through</p>
<p>with the force of your parents telling you otherwise.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s how much you want,</p>
<p>it will dictate how far you&rsquo;re gonna go,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna go.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, if you can break through that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get nowhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>And actually, one of the really nice things</p>
<p>the internet does that I would give advice to young people</p>
<p>is like you can find,</p>
<p>even if your parents are not a source of that,</p>
<p>your teachers, your community,</p>
<p>you can find people on the internet who will believe in you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool how the internet opens the possibility</p>
<p>of like a community of like 10, 11-year-olds</p>
<p>like building shit.</p>
<p>I see this all the time.</p>
<p>Engineering, and they, I mean, they&rsquo;re fueled by belief.</p>
<p>They want to be like,</p>
<p>they want to create the next trillion dollar company.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s that fire in their eyes.</p>
<p>And not for the money, obviously,</p>
<p>but to do something really impactful.</p>
<p>And I think that fire is extinguished often</p>
<p>by teachers and parents.</p>
<p>Because I think the logic that parents have,</p>
<p>and teachers, they look at a kid,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t, on the surface level,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see greatness, right?</p>
<p>They just see kind of mediocrity.</p>
<p>And so to them, it&rsquo;s like, no, right,</p>
<p>the world is more complicated than that.</p>
<p>In order to get great, you have to,</p>
<p>they somehow kind of always try to be reasonable with you.</p>
<p>And in so doing, extinguish the flame, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I think most people are afraid to even try.</p>
<p>So you can call them cowards for not trying.</p>
<p>Because you are a coward for not trying,</p>
<p>not putting yourself at risk, right?</p>
<p>So I would say a big part of society</p>
<p>are cowards for never trying,</p>
<p>never pursuing what they really want.</p>
<p>So there is a weight, a pressure,</p>
<p>everyone, most people, a lot of people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say around you, that because they were afraid to try,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t incentivize people to do so</p>
<p>because they want everybody to be like them.</p>
<p>Because imagine if everybody around you</p>
<p>suddenly are not afraid and everyone is trying,</p>
<p>and you look yourself in the mirror</p>
<p>and say, I was too scared, I&rsquo;ve never tried.</p>
<p>So you feel really bad about yourself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier to have people around you</p>
<p>that think exactly like you than otherwise.</p>
<p>So that reflect a lot on the kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, society almost like press them down</p>
<p>to be like everybody else, to have a normal life,</p>
<p>normal job, it&rsquo;s, you know, don&rsquo;t take risk</p>
<p>because you can lose it all.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the worst thing you can tell everybody.</p>
<p>Take all the risks, lose it all a few times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re gonna build things.</p>
<p>Especially when you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You can recover much quicker.</p>
<p>Exactly, what&rsquo;s the point of not trying?</p>
<p>You should try, and you will lose everything.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what it matters to lose everything.</p>
<p>It does matter, it will teach you resilience.</p>
<p>You know, try harder, go after, you know.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t live a normal life</p>
<p>because otherwise you mean what we&rsquo;re here for.</p>
<p>Yeah, take big risks, take a lot of them,</p>
<p>fail and fail and fail and fail.</p>
<p>Of course, fail you a thousand times until you succeed.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re gonna, you&rsquo;ll be the most proud of yourself.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s, then it&rsquo;ll be priceless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, then we&rsquo;ll change the world.</p>
<p>It is true that most people are not necessarily cowards</p>
<p>but have cowardice in them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s most people are just afraid to try, you know.</p>
<p>And a lot of it comes from a place of love</p>
<p>because, you know, if you try and you fail, you get hurt.</p>
<p>It hurts.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not a pleasant thing to fail.</p>
<p>I mean, you feel terrible to think, you know,</p>
<p>when I lost any tournament was a good thing.</p>
<p>You know, and think when I was getting beat up</p>
<p>at the gym over and over again was a good thing.</p>
<p>When I was getting there</p>
<p>and getting smashed by all the good guys,</p>
<p>I think I liked it.</p>
<p>Well, I hate it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s my resilience that, you know,</p>
<p>make me carry on until I succeed.</p>
<p>Think I like to get tapped.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m the most competitive,</p>
<p>one of the most competitive person you know.</p>
<p>I hate to lose.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, I accept.</p>
<p>I mean, I just need to get better.</p>
<p>Every single time I lost in the championship, I hate it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never screamed.</p>
<p>No one never saw me screaming,</p>
<p>shouting that, you know, I got robbed.</p>
<p>You know, I should have won.</p>
<p>The referee, you know, screwed me over.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It happen.</p>
<p>Shit happens.</p>
<p>I need to get better.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t want to be in that position ever again.</p>
<p>So when I fight, if I&rsquo;m better,</p>
<p>if I tapped him, there&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to wait for the referee to decide</p>
<p>that there was points or no points.</p>
<p>His interpretation, that made me better.</p>
<p>Because I was even more determined to be better.</p>
<p>In my mind, I have to tap everybody else.</p>
<p>Winning is not enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just objectively speaking,</p>
<p>what you learn the most from</p>
<p>is really wanting to succeed and then failing.</p>
<p>And doing that often.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality from a parent,</p>
<p>from a teacher perspective, from anybody.</p>
<p>From people you love.</p>
<p>If they really want to do something,</p>
<p>help them do that thing.</p>
<p>If you think they&rsquo;re going to fail, good.</p>
<p>Help them do that faster so they fail faster.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to learn.</p>
<p>The only way to succeed is failing.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people have to understand.</p>
<p>Without failing, there is no success.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;ve gotten a little softer,</p>
<p>a little more emotionally open,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of love in the human condition,</p>
<p>Hajo Gracie?</p>
<p>Probably the most important thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic of everything, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, love brings the best of us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s if we had more love and compassion</p>
<p>from the other person,</p>
<p>I think the world would be a more evolved species.</p>
<p>The world would be a much better place than it is now.</p>
<p>Did friends, family help you along the way?</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot.</p>
<p>I always had a lot of love and help from many people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I succeed.</p>
<p>I never got here by myself.</p>
<p>I had a lot of people who loved me,</p>
<p>believed in me,</p>
<p>and helped me get to be here today.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad they did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>It was an honor to meet you.</p>
<p>It was an honor to hang out with you in Vegas,</p>
<p>to hang out with you again today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just been a huge fan for a long time.</p>
