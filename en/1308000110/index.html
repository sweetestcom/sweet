    <p>I literally don&rsquo;t want to talk about</p>
<p>brigading guys, though,</p>
<p>only because it&rsquo;s getting crazy</p>
<p>and I had to like mod my stuff.</p>
<p>So start the recording, please</p>
<p>start the recording.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to strike it by brigades.</p>
<p>Do you mean like MAGA brigades?</p>
<p>All right, listen.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>Do you think because I can call him?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to call him off.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.</p>
<p>Hey, Donny.</p>
<p>Hey, Donny.</p>
<p>Jake, I&rsquo;ll say he&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>brigaded by MAGA.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t handle it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s tapping out.</p>
<p>I tap out, I tap out, I tap out.</p>
<p>Can you call off the dogs?</p>
<p>OK, all right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to brigade anymore.</p>
<p>The sign up is over.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It was getting pretty</p>
<p>getting pretty acute there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, welcome</p>
<p>to Episode 96 of the All In podcast.</p>
<p>We had a bomb drop just yesterday</p>
<p>with Adobe agreeing to acquire Figma,</p>
<p>the design tool.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into that in a minute,</p>
<p>what it actually does</p>
<p>for 20 billion dollars.</p>
<p>This is just astounding</p>
<p>for this to happen.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>Full stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the largest private</p>
<p>company purchase,</p>
<p>I believe, in history.</p>
<p>This company, if you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it helps you design web apps</p>
<p>or user interfaces.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a designer,</p>
<p>we used to make mockups.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d send them around in the industry.</p>
<p>As images or PDFs,</p>
<p>and then like Google Docs,</p>
<p>where you can put comments</p>
<p>on somebody else&rsquo;s words</p>
<p>and you can collaborate in real time,</p>
<p>we call it multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Figma is multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>The company is just a juggernaut.</p>
<p>If you work in startups,</p>
<p>you get Figma designs all day.</p>
<p>And Adobe stock got crushed</p>
<p>because of this was down</p>
<p>as much as 18 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>Figma&rsquo;s most recent valuation</p>
<p>was 10 billion dollars</p>
<p>in June of 2021.</p>
<p>Their Series E, so peak market.</p>
<p>They had raised 200 million</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of details</p>
<p>to get into here.</p>
<p>But, you know, listen,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s ask the sultan of SaaS here</p>
<p>what you think of this,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s double</p>
<p>what was an incredible</p>
<p>market last year that was overheated.</p>
<p>So what does this say about the market?</p>
<p>Figma, you know, Figma itself</p>
<p>or maybe Adobe&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, jumping the fence</p>
<p>or being skittish?</p>
<p>How do we reconcile this, Sax?</p>
<p>Oh, if you judge Adobe stock price</p>
<p>the other day,</p>
<p>the market hated the deal.</p>
<p>I mean, the Adobe stock</p>
<p>price went down like 15 percent</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s 150 billion dollar</p>
<p>company roughly.</p>
<p>So they lost almost</p>
<p>the entire purchase price</p>
<p>in the market capitalization of Figma.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically an overreaction.</p>
<p>I, you know, I know all the news</p>
<p>is basically on how</p>
<p>Adobe is paying 50 times</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s no longer the multiple.</p>
<p>The multiple is more like,</p>
<p>you know, eight, nine,</p>
<p>10 times for high growth SaaS companies.</p>
<p>There is truth to that, but</p>
<p>but I think it misses</p>
<p>some important details</p>
<p>about how fast Figma is growing.</p>
<p>Can we actually throw up on the screen</p>
<p>the AR history of this company?</p>
<p>So and for people who know</p>
<p>the multiple is the multiple</p>
<p>times top line revenue.</p>
<p>Times ARR, really.</p>
<p>So, OK, so explain that to folks.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, ARR is just</p>
<p>the annually recurring revenue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subscription revenue.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will look at</p>
<p>next 12 months revenue,</p>
<p>which is a similar concept,</p>
<p>not quite the same,</p>
<p>but sort of in the ballpark.</p>
<p>So, you know, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting about this company,</p>
<p>I think it was founded 2011, 2012.</p>
<p>It had a very long wilderness period.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I call the period</p>
<p>where the founders</p>
<p>are trying to figure out</p>
<p>what the product is going to be.</p>
<p>Really, for almost five years,</p>
<p>they finally launched</p>
<p>a private beta in 2015.</p>
<p>They then opened it up</p>
<p>to public launch in 2016,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t turn on monetization</p>
<p>until 2017.</p>
<p>So five years into the company,</p>
<p>they hadn&rsquo;t made a dime.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s roughly</p>
<p>a 10 year old company.</p>
<p>And for the first five years,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make any money.</p>
<p>And then they started to make money</p>
<p>five years ago.</p>
<p>And then in 2018,</p>
<p>I think they turned on</p>
<p>the enterprise tier</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s been kind of</p>
<p>off to the races.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I can tell you</p>
<p>looking at these numbers,</p>
<p>by the way, so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if these numbers</p>
<p>are perfectly correct.</p>
<p>This is sort of</p>
<p>I would call the scuttlebutt numbers.</p>
<p>These are numbers that I believe</p>
<p>to be true.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like these are numbers</p>
<p>that the company&rsquo;s confirmed</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>This is just me</p>
<p>gathering intelligence</p>
<p>from talking to people</p>
<p>in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>So this is what I believe</p>
<p>to be the case.</p>
<p>Can you read the numbers for people</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t on YouTube watching this?</p>
<p>Yeah. So in 2017, again,</p>
<p>the first year they monetized,</p>
<p>they did 700,000.</p>
<p>They ended the year with 700,000 of ARR.</p>
<p>Remember that ARR</p>
<p>is kind of a point in time metric.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the amount of subscription</p>
<p>revenue, your annual run rate,</p>
<p>subscription revenue at that time.</p>
<p>So they ended 2017 with 700,000.</p>
<p>2018, they ended with 4 million.</p>
<p>2019, they ended with 23 million.</p>
<p>2020, they ended with 77 million.</p>
<p>2021, 210 million.</p>
<p>And then the estimated number</p>
<p>for this year is 450.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve seen in the press,</p>
<p>I think it has been publicly reported</p>
<p>a 400 million dollar ARR</p>
<p>numbers currently where they&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that they&rsquo;re going to end</p>
<p>with something more like 450 this year.</p>
<p>And then their forecast for next year</p>
<p>is or was at some point in time</p>
<p>when somebody heard this.</p>
<p>800 million forecast for 2023.</p>
<p>So my point is, I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>a lot of SAS metrics.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that this ARR</p>
<p>ramp is phenomenal.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m sure people</p>
<p>have kind of heard about the</p>
<p>triple, triple, double, double.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what VCs want you to do.</p>
<p>They want you to triple two years in a row.</p>
<p>Then they want you to double</p>
<p>two years in a row and so forth.</p>
<p>This company did way better than that.</p>
<p>I mean, 700K to 4 million</p>
<p>is a really fast ramp.</p>
<p>And then 4 million to 23</p>
<p>million is incredible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, you know, over a 5X.</p>
<p>And then they did over a 3X</p>
<p>going from 23 to 77 million.</p>
<p>I can tell you that is super hard.</p>
<p>I think most companies,</p>
<p>even the ones that hit,</p>
<p>you know, low 20s,</p>
<p>tripling year over year,</p>
<p>they tend to decelerate</p>
<p>to two and a half times</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>This company was still growing over 3X.</p>
<p>Then they roughly tripled</p>
<p>again to get to 210.</p>
<p>And then since they got to the question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So now they&rsquo;re double that.</p>
<p>Do you think the triple in 2020</p>
<p>was a COVID pull forward?</p>
<p>Or do you think that</p>
<p>that was a natural, like a zoom or not?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was going to say.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s possible, but</p>
<p>people were collaborating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not I don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>I mean, so far in the numbers,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a huge slowdown here.</p>
<p>I mean, look, once the numbers</p>
<p>get into the hundreds of millions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to maintain</p>
<p>the same growth rate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re compounding off such a large base</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just inevitable.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t keep growing 3X year over year</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re at,</p>
<p>you know, 200 million of ARR.</p>
<p>But the fact they got first from 23 to 77</p>
<p>and then 77 to 210 and now 210,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re at 400 now</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to be at 450</p>
<p>by the end of the year plus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>And so, OK, so, yeah.</p>
<p>So Adobe&rsquo;s paying 50 times</p>
<p>current ARR.</p>
<p>But if you believe this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re only paying divide by two.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re paying 25 times</p>
<p>end of next year.</p>
<p>So like 18 months from now.</p>
<p>And then you figure, you know,</p>
<p>within, say, two years after that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be,</p>
<p>you know, at somewhere between</p>
<p>one and a half and two billion of ARR.</p>
<p>And as you guys know,</p>
<p>there just aren&rsquo;t that many SAS companies</p>
<p>that even get to a billion of ARR.</p>
<p>So so I don&rsquo;t think Adobe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making a bad deal here.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a question about</p>
<p>is there any point at which this product</p>
<p>hits some sort of market saturation?</p>
<p>But Adobe&rsquo;s in a good position</p>
<p>to know that because</p>
<p>they understand this market.</p>
<p>They are in this market.</p>
<p>It feels to me like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Adobe Photoshop</p>
<p>right around when it first came out,</p>
<p>like 1992.</p>
<p>And this product I&rsquo;ve used,</p>
<p>it was built web first,</p>
<p>it was built for collaborative use</p>
<p>and Photoshop over the years,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve really tried to take</p>
<p>what is a desktop installed</p>
<p>software application</p>
<p>and then try and create cloud based</p>
<p>features. And it&rsquo;s a terrible,</p>
<p>terrible user experience,</p>
<p>at least from my perspective,</p>
<p>having grown up on using Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s most important,</p>
<p>I think, is a lot of people</p>
<p>think about this on</p>
<p>is it the right price to pay for the company?</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the right price to pay for the company</p>
<p>is what Adobe views to be</p>
<p>the risk and reward for their business.</p>
<p>And they effectively paid roughly</p>
<p>12% dilution of their company</p>
<p>to do this deal.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re saying, let&rsquo;s take 12%</p>
<p>of our company and effectively de-risk</p>
<p>the biggest risk to our business,</p>
<p>take out the biggest threat</p>
<p>to our business for 12% of our company.</p>
<p>Not 12%.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it 12%?</p>
<p>You have to factor in the actual</p>
<p>drawdown of the stock as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about 33%.</p>
<p>They they they effectively.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m talking about like assume</p>
<p>take take the price of the stock aside</p>
<p>the number of shares they&rsquo;re issuing</p>
<p>because by the way,</p>
<p>the deal value went down with the stock.</p>
<p>So I read the the merger terms last night</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a couple billion of cash</p>
<p>and then a good chunk of it is in stock.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s 10 billion of cash</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s 10 billion of shares</p>
<p>at the price when the deal was announced</p>
<p>and to your point.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a fixed number of shares.</p>
<p>The stock, it&rsquo;s a fixed number of shares.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fixed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fixed monetary value.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s down 20%</p>
<p>from the deal announcement.</p>
<p>So that 10 billion of stock</p>
<p>is now actually 8 billion of stock.</p>
<p>So no, the whole deal is now 18 billion,</p>
<p>not 10 billion of cash to month</p>
<p>the 10 billion cash.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s 2 billion</p>
<p>of deferred RSUs and stock based</p>
<p>compensation.</p>
<p>But there but I mean,</p>
<p>if you think about it</p>
<p>at the time of the merger,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re either, you know,</p>
<p>I think they have</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to use some term loan</p>
<p>that they have to get the cash.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re effectively issuing,</p>
<p>you know, 10 divided</p>
<p>by their total share count,</p>
<p>which is roughly 6%</p>
<p>of their total shares outstanding.</p>
<p>So, you know, they&rsquo;re kind of taking 6%.</p>
<p>Or let&rsquo;s just aggregate</p>
<p>the two together and say</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking roughly 12% dilution.</p>
<p>Sure, the value of the stock goes down.</p>
<p>So look, I think like this deal</p>
<p>is really interesting.</p>
<p>So first, let&rsquo;s just give huge kudos</p>
<p>to the CEO and the team and the investors.</p>
<p>What an enormous win</p>
<p>for all those folks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>It keeps Silicon Valley</p>
<p>kind of going right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just awesome</p>
<p>to see these kind of big wins.</p>
<p>I read this incredible profile</p>
<p>about the founder.</p>
<p>And he sounded like</p>
<p>such a fascinating person,</p>
<p>he basically said</p>
<p>that the profile basically said</p>
<p>that he was spending months and months</p>
<p>going from office to office</p>
<p>all around the world,</p>
<p>meeting customers,</p>
<p>sitting with customers,</p>
<p>reading trouble tickets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he would do.</p>
<p>You know, reading help desk tickets</p>
<p>about the product on vacation.</p>
<p>Whenever you see a CEO</p>
<p>that is so customer obsessed,</p>
<p>typically there&rsquo;s good outcome.</p>
<p>And so this is just another</p>
<p>validating point on that theme.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s just put Figma aside</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just talk</p>
<p>about Adobe for a second.</p>
<p>What is so incredible is</p>
<p>you have a company.</p>
<p>Yes, they spent.</p>
<p>Twenty billion dollars</p>
<p>or whatever, 18 billion now.</p>
<p>But the way that they did it</p>
<p>is really interesting.</p>
<p>If you go back to Zendesk</p>
<p>and SurveyMonkey,</p>
<p>when those guys announced that merger.</p>
<p>It was above a threshold of stock</p>
<p>where you had to go</p>
<p>to a shareholder vote.</p>
<p>And because there was so much</p>
<p>turbulence in the market,</p>
<p>whether the industrial logic</p>
<p>of that deal made sense or not,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t matter as much to shareholders</p>
<p>when it came time to vote</p>
<p>and they voted it down.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So interestingly,</p>
<p>Adobe was very clever.</p>
<p>They said, I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>half cash, half stock</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;m below the threshold.</p>
<p>We are below the threshold</p>
<p>where it goes to a shareholder vote.</p>
<p>OK, interesting.</p>
<p>But then you have to factor</p>
<p>in the dilution,</p>
<p>not just the dilution of the stock,</p>
<p>but then the rewriting of the stock.</p>
<p>And this is where, you know,</p>
<p>you lose 20 percent of your market cap</p>
<p>and then you tack on this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about, you know,</p>
<p>a 40, 30, 40 billion dollar</p>
<p>price tag to get the deal done.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>the head scratcher</p>
<p>was in the public markets,</p>
<p>where folks basically</p>
<p>rebuilt their model and said,</p>
<p>hold on a second.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve been telling me</p>
<p>that this problem is a solved problem.</p>
<p>But when you pay such a premium,</p>
<p>not only does it mean</p>
<p>that this product</p>
<p>is clearly materially</p>
<p>growing and disrupting,</p>
<p>but the existing revenue</p>
<p>base that I was counting on in my model</p>
<p>must be wrong as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the actual flywheel</p>
<p>that now Adobe is in,</p>
<p>where people are trying</p>
<p>to really figure out</p>
<p>how under pressure</p>
<p>are those existing cash flows.</p>
<p>And then if you compound</p>
<p>that with something else,</p>
<p>which is nothing specific to Adobe,</p>
<p>but to the whole market,</p>
<p>which is now interest rates</p>
<p>are going up behind the scenes.</p>
<p>You have this sort of parade</p>
<p>of terribles for Adobe</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to have to navigate.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They have a very large portion of cash.</p>
<p>They have a large portion of stock.</p>
<p>They have decaying earnings</p>
<p>in their core business</p>
<p>that they now have to explain.</p>
<p>And then they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>have a lot of earnings.</p>
<p>I think Shantanu said</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be year three</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s accretive,</p>
<p>which is typically a way of saying</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to lose money</p>
<p>and then in year three</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make at least a penny.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what accretive means.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>billions necessarily.</p>
<p>And so these guys have to find a way</p>
<p>for Figma to drop</p>
<p>about a billion and a half dollars</p>
<p>of free cash flow into the business</p>
<p>for this to kind of make sense</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>So I think those are all the mechanics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of putting a lot of pressure</p>
<p>on the Adobe stock,</p>
<p>but it just goes to show you</p>
<p>the amount of disruption that happens,</p>
<p>this movement to the cloud</p>
<p>or the movement to collaboration.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Monolithic products</p>
<p>are just sort of very much DOA, you know?</p>
<p>That is the key.</p>
<p>I think you guys did a great job</p>
<p>of summarizing it.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely great deal for Adobe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a transformative deal</p>
<p>in the same way the WhatsApp deal</p>
<p>was for Facebook.</p>
<p>It removes one of the two</p>
<p>existential threats to Adobe.</p>
<p>And it turns Adobe, I guess,</p>
<p>into a growth story now,</p>
<p>as pointed out, Adobe&rsquo;s product</p>
<p>was single player mode</p>
<p>and Adobe grows at about 12 or 13 percent</p>
<p>quarter right now.</p>
<p>And now you have a company that doubles</p>
<p>and they really have been facing</p>
<p>three paradigm shifts</p>
<p>in the last five or so years.</p>
<p>Obviously, you pointed out one, Friedberg,</p>
<p>desktop software downloading it</p>
<p>versus cloud based software.</p>
<p>Well, here they go.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;ve got experts in cloud.</p>
<p>And then the second one.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they have a thing</p>
<p>called Creative Cloud.</p>
<p>And they are slowly</p>
<p>trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a paradigm shift inside the company.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve really struggled.</p>
<p>So now they have somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s cloud first.</p>
<p>Do you guys ever use those products?</p>
<p>Those Adobe products?</p>
<p>We have.</p>
<p>But hold on, let me finish here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three paradigm shifts here.</p>
<p>Feature for feature.</p>
<p>They look very similar.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So these these three paradigm shifts,</p>
<p>the one is the desktop versus the web.</p>
<p>The other one is subscription.</p>
<p>So Adobe was charging</p>
<p>$1,000 a year for the creative cloud.</p>
<p>Now they charge 25 bucks a month for it.</p>
<p>They successfully did that.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;ve successfully.</p>
<p>I think have figured out</p>
<p>collaboration software.</p>
<p>But Adobe has one thing</p>
<p>that they have not done,</p>
<p>which I think is the real reason</p>
<p>they had to buy Figma Adobe.</p>
<p>See, this is the problem</p>
<p>with these big public companies.</p>
<p>Adobe and all of their investors</p>
<p>got very addicted</p>
<p>to the free cash flow</p>
<p>generation of that stock,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been an incredible performer.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just be honest,</p>
<p>Shantanu is one of the best CEOs</p>
<p>of the last few decades</p>
<p>in the public markets.</p>
<p>Period. End of story.</p>
<p>OK, since 2007,</p>
<p>he has just run a masterful playbook.</p>
<p>At the tail end of that, though,</p>
<p>you know, in 2022,</p>
<p>this is a company that has,</p>
<p>I think, six or seven, maybe</p>
<p>I think maybe $8 billion</p>
<p>of free cash flow.</p>
<p>It is a gargantuan</p>
<p>money making business.</p>
<p>And so they refused in Creative Cloud</p>
<p>to go to that free tier that Figma has.</p>
<p>And if you look at all of the stories</p>
<p>around Figma,</p>
<p>one of the most powerful things they did</p>
<p>was basically allow people to use this</p>
<p>for free, effectively forever.</p>
<p>Yeah. Bottom up sass.</p>
<p>Yeah. And the problem with Adobe</p>
<p>is like that&rsquo;s a business model</p>
<p>disruption that they could not afford</p>
<p>in the public markets,</p>
<p>because if you condition</p>
<p>a set of institutional investors</p>
<p>to be expecting seven to $8 billion</p>
<p>of annual free cash flow</p>
<p>and all of a sudden</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re willing to torch it</p>
<p>to take a quarter of that</p>
<p>and take it free.</p>
<p>That is probably the biggest reason</p>
<p>why they had to buy this thing,</p>
<p>which was that they needed to tuck it in.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, how can I do it?</p>
<p>Well, I just have to do it</p>
<p>by diluting the stock.</p>
<p>One time, that was one time</p>
<p>stock issuance.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was it.</p>
<p>It was a one time 12% diluted.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one and done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one more to go.</p>
<p>The point the point</p>
<p>you guys are making is more</p>
<p>broad, which is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just about Adobe.</p>
<p>This is the classic innovator&rsquo;s dilemma.</p>
<p>Right. Like any big company</p>
<p>that reaches maturity in their market,</p>
<p>and has scale and has cash flows,</p>
<p>you have a different shareholder base.</p>
<p>You move over from growth to value.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;ve got value shareholders,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been to these</p>
<p>institutional meetings</p>
<p>when I was on the exec team at Monsanto.</p>
<p>And, you know, they wanted dividends</p>
<p>and they wanted stock buybacks.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice to see growth.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I want to know where&rsquo;s my dividend</p>
<p>going to be and what&rsquo;s my stock</p>
<p>buyback target going to be.</p>
<p>And then to say, hey,</p>
<p>I got to go invest in</p>
<p>innovating my way out of my corner</p>
<p>because, you know, in this case,</p>
<p>cloud is reinventing my marketplace.</p>
<p>It is a very hard place</p>
<p>for a manager of a business</p>
<p>of that scale to be, by the way.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>every industry, by the way.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another takeaway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really interesting here,</p>
<p>which is that if you look</p>
<p>at big tech companies,</p>
<p>I think you almost have to sort them</p>
<p>into two buckets,</p>
<p>at least in the enterprise.</p>
<p>And that sucks.</p>
<p>You can tell me if you disagree.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one type</p>
<p>of enterprise company</p>
<p>which makes basically a single</p>
<p>linear monolithic product</p>
<p>or a handful of those</p>
<p>monolithic products.</p>
<p>Right. Think Workday,</p>
<p>think Adobe, et cetera.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>other type of company</p>
<p>which are more platform</p>
<p>level businesses that have this,</p>
<p>you know, mixture of things</p>
<p>that they do relatively well integrated.</p>
<p>Maybe each product is not so great,</p>
<p>but together they&rsquo;re pretty decent.</p>
<p>And you have distribution leverage</p>
<p>and you have pricing power.</p>
<p>Think Microsoft and the totality</p>
<p>of those products.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting to me is</p>
<p>you cannot effectively compete,</p>
<p>as it turns out, against Microsoft</p>
<p>at any point product.</p>
<p>And Slack, I think, is the best example</p>
<p>where, you know, Microsoft Teams</p>
<p>was fundamentally</p>
<p>cannibalizing this business,</p>
<p>which is what drove Slack</p>
<p>into the arms of Salesforce.</p>
<p>And, you know, you could say that</p>
<p>Teams was not as great of a product.</p>
<p>I would have I would make that claim.</p>
<p>But what Microsoft had</p>
<p>was distribution scale and pricing</p>
<p>power where you could discount</p>
<p>and effectively give it away for free.</p>
<p>Adobe isn&rsquo;t in that situation.</p>
<p>Right. They can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And so when you compete</p>
<p>against those kinds of businesses,</p>
<p>you have a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>The takeaway, I think,</p>
<p>for the entrepreneur</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>the next enterprise business to start,</p>
<p>I would try to bucket these companies</p>
<p>that you want to compete with and say,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m going to build</p>
<p>a newer version of X,</p>
<p>make sure that version of X</p>
<p>is going after a company like Adobe</p>
<p>versus a company like Microsoft,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s much, much, much easier</p>
<p>to build value when you&rsquo;re competing</p>
<p>against a monolithic product company</p>
<p>versus an entangled platform company.</p>
<p>Saks, would you bundle</p>
<p>if you were the CEO of Figma</p>
<p>would you now, I&rsquo;m sorry, CEO of Adobe,</p>
<p>would you bundle Figma</p>
<p>into the creative cloud</p>
<p>and then just make it one subscription?</p>
<p>Would you Microsoft teams that?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about that.</p>
<p>I do think that Microsoft</p>
<p>is a little bit unique</p>
<p>in its ability to bundle.</p>
<p>So what so is right</p>
<p>about the power of the bundling.</p>
<p>What they do is I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the E5 bundle.</p>
<p>They have all these products</p>
<p>that virtually all enterprises</p>
<p>use from office to,</p>
<p>you know, Active Directory to,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a whole long list of them.</p>
<p>And so what they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ve created one price</p>
<p>for all of those products.</p>
<p>They sold a bundle</p>
<p>under a wall to wall enterprise license.</p>
<p>And what they do is</p>
<p>when they see a new competitor</p>
<p>come along, whether it&rsquo;s Slack or</p>
<p>Zoom or or Okta,</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ll basically just clone it,</p>
<p>create a worse version of that product</p>
<p>and throw it into the bundle.</p>
<p>And so now every single enterprise</p>
<p>is getting the Slack clone</p>
<p>or the Zoom clone or whatever for free.</p>
<p>And that has a huge material impact on,</p>
<p>you know, it pulls the rug out</p>
<p>from under those startups.</p>
<p>So now that&rsquo;s not to say</p>
<p>that Microsoft&rsquo;s product</p>
<p>is anywhere near as good</p>
<p>as those those competitors.</p>
<p>But, you know, now all of a sudden</p>
<p>the Microsoft product</p>
<p>is on a marginal basis free.</p>
<p>But then what Microsoft does is,</p>
<p>you know, every year or two,</p>
<p>they go raise the price of the bundle.</p>
<p>So basically, you know,</p>
<p>they get you hooked on the bundle.</p>
<p>They then use it to systematically kill</p>
<p>or undermine a competitor.</p>
<p>And then they know you&rsquo;re stuck</p>
<p>and then they raise the price.</p>
<p>They basically have inflation</p>
<p>of the price of the whole bundle.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very anti-competitive,</p>
<p>actually.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s akin to dumping.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the logical</p>
<p>stopping point of it is.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if we can have</p>
<p>a healthy SaaS market</p>
<p>if Microsoft is allowed</p>
<p>to keep doing this forever.</p>
<p>Because think about it.</p>
<p>I mean, they will just every year</p>
<p>they will take the hot SaaS company</p>
<p>in du jour, clone it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a shitty version.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll throw it into their bundle.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re dumping</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dumping the product in the market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free until they basically drive</p>
<p>and they drive out the competitor</p>
<p>or destroy it or basically</p>
<p>undermine this market cap</p>
<p>to the point where it can no longer</p>
<p>make the kinds of investments</p>
<p>it needs to pose a real threat</p>
<p>to the Microsoft larger entity.</p>
<p>Right. So think about</p>
<p>how anti-competitive this is.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t hear a word about this</p>
<p>from Lena Khan or Washington.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only focused on social networks.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s more focused on,</p>
<p>you know, making sure</p>
<p>Amazon doesn&rsquo;t buy Roomba</p>
<p>that, you know, this stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Facebook doesn&rsquo;t buy one VR app.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not very</p>
<p>sophisticated approach.</p>
<p>This is the kind of stuff</p>
<p>that actually really matters.</p>
<p>I really think you nailed it</p>
<p>on the headsacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s an impossible strategy</p>
<p>to defend against.</p>
<p>The the other thing</p>
<p>that is interesting, by the way,</p>
<p>about all of this is,</p>
<p>you know, if you think</p>
<p>that the valuation,</p>
<p>the takeout premium</p>
<p>was basically two X post to post.</p>
<p>What that means is that if Figma</p>
<p>was last valued at 10</p>
<p>is now worth 20,</p>
<p>you know, does that mean that Canva,</p>
<p>which was last priced at 40,</p>
<p>is worth 80?</p>
<p>Well, potentially to</p>
<p>potentially to Adobe.</p>
<p>Right. And if you add</p>
<p>those two together now,</p>
<p>you know, what you really have</p>
<p>is basically the the entire totality</p>
<p>of the creative cloud for Adobe</p>
<p>is basically embedded now</p>
<p>in these two businesses</p>
<p>at an extreme premium.</p>
<p>And so it makes it very difficult</p>
<p>now, I think, as well</p>
<p>for Adobe to execute a strategy here</p>
<p>without it being forced</p>
<p>to do some more expensive</p>
<p>dilutive M&amp;A.</p>
<p>Well, and the other problem, Chamath,</p>
<p>is this is going to ring bells.</p>
<p>So when I said before,</p>
<p>there were two existential threats.</p>
<p>Canva is the other one.</p>
<p>And that is the other paradigm</p>
<p>shift that&rsquo;s occurred in computing</p>
<p>is that making things radically simple.</p>
<p>You talked about a free bird.</p>
<p>Photoshop is complex</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s single player.</p>
<p>Canva is how people create,</p>
<p>you know, any kind of</p>
<p>marketing materials today.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t hire a designer anymore.</p>
<p>The job of graphic designer</p>
<p>is now everybody&rsquo;s job.</p>
<p>Everybody can make something on Canva.</p>
<p>But then I think Sachs or Freiburg,</p>
<p>maybe you have thoughts on this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Alina Khan</p>
<p>and they do make a run at Canva, Adobe,</p>
<p>now are you saying like, hey, wait a second.</p>
<p>You now run the table on all design tools.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird classification.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only called design tools</p>
<p>because it was sold to someone</p>
<p>that was called a designer before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the case anymore.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a tool</p>
<p>that anyone can use</p>
<p>in the enterprise setting</p>
<p>or in a small, small business setting</p>
<p>or in an individual setting</p>
<p>to create stuff.</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t the case with Photoshop.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what makes this</p>
<p>arguably a very different business,</p>
<p>a bigger business,</p>
<p>a more transformative business</p>
<p>and a farther reaching business.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s necessarily</p>
<p>a speaking of the Figma deal, right?</p>
<p>A case to be made here</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re preventing</p>
<p>the extinction of their monopoly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re buying what looks</p>
<p>like a very different business.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really additive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a business</p>
<p>that can turn anyone into a creator.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of speaking</p>
<p>out of both sides of your mouth now,</p>
<p>because on the one hand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s a different business.</p>
<p>But on the other hand,</p>
<p>you said that this is</p>
<p>basically protecting them</p>
<p>against an existential disruption</p>
<p>to their core business.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s an existential disruption</p>
<p>to their core business,</p>
<p>how could it not be in the same market?</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s in the same market.</p>
<p>Well, there are new</p>
<p>entrance competitors.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are new entrants.</p>
<p>And there are, you know,</p>
<p>different underlying,</p>
<p>you know, technology trends.</p>
<p>This is all about cloud.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, I don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>how these things aren&rsquo;t competitors</p>
<p>with each other to some degree.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how this doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get seriously reviewed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I trust authorities.</p>
<p>It feels so similar to Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram and Google, YouTube.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s similar</p>
<p>in both those examples</p>
<p>in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Both Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>was not competing in the same product</p>
<p>as Facebook at the time</p>
<p>with the newsfeed or whatever.</p>
<p>It was a photo sharing service</p>
<p>that clearly created</p>
<p>a broader addressable market</p>
<p>that got more people</p>
<p>to use a social network.</p>
<p>And YouTube people</p>
<p>thought they were overpaying.</p>
<p>Right. And then YouTube,</p>
<p>everyone thought it was crazy.</p>
<p>They paid a billion six</p>
<p>for that business.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably the greatest</p>
<p>acquisition of all time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been the greatest managed</p>
<p>acquisition of all time, I should say.</p>
<p>And that business, similarly,</p>
<p>I think Google recognized</p>
<p>that people were going to move</p>
<p>to video content</p>
<p>as an alternative</p>
<p>to text based web content</p>
<p>and that it was a bigger</p>
<p>picture opportunity</p>
<p>than what they were pursuing</p>
<p>and in the lane that they operated</p>
<p>in at that time.</p>
<p>And they were right.</p>
<p>And in both cases,</p>
<p>it was more about paying</p>
<p>whatever it took to get the deal done</p>
<p>than, you know, hey,</p>
<p>how many users do you have?</p>
<p>How much revenue?</p>
<p>How much EBITDA?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your ARR?</p>
<p>All that stuff goes out the window</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sitting</p>
<p>in that strategic driver&rsquo;s seat</p>
<p>at that big company.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>this is a bigger market.</p>
<p>These guys are transforming the market.</p>
<p>And ultimately, over time,</p>
<p>that will eclipse us.</p>
<p>And you can say, hey,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re protecting your business,</p>
<p>but really you&rsquo;re protecting your market.</p>
<p>I mean, the market is going to go away</p>
<p>is what the vision is</p>
<p>like the market that you exist in today</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to exist in the same way</p>
<p>in five, 10 years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to buy your way into.</p>
<p>I have a question and a statement.</p>
<p>The statement is.</p>
<p>I think Canva should absolutely go</p>
<p>public versus sell,</p>
<p>because it seems like they&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>a much easier time</p>
<p>competing against whomever</p>
<p>that they compete with.</p>
<p>I do think that, David, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>that there is.</p>
<p>A lot here for regulatory review,</p>
<p>because if you go back</p>
<p>and think about visa plaid,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not dissimilar,</p>
<p>meaning you have a young startup</p>
<p>that has this really credible</p>
<p>and viable technology</p>
<p>potentially being acquired by in that case,</p>
<p>it was one of a duopoly.</p>
<p>But here you could make</p>
<p>a very credible claim</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s in a market</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s roughly a monopoly</p>
<p>because there aren&rsquo;t really that</p>
<p>that many meaningful alternatives.</p>
<p>So I think Saks is right,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>you know, oh, there&rsquo;s a case here.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a case here</p>
<p>where it just depends</p>
<p>whether that was literally my question</p>
<p>or this.</p>
<p>Well, not just Roomba.</p>
<p>How about how about that</p>
<p>VR game that Facebook was before?</p>
<p>Like that was a tiny acquisition</p>
<p>that maybe have a million users.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s just exactly</p>
<p>they are being punitive.</p>
<p>I think I think it seems like.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it seems like</p>
<p>what the antitrust authorities</p>
<p>are doing right now in Washington</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ve got a list of companies</p>
<p>that they think are punitively suspect.</p>
<p>And our job is to stop these companies</p>
<p>from accumulating more power.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really about seeing everything</p>
<p>through this lens of power.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what the competition</p>
<p>authorities are supposed to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to ensure competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about it should be a rule book, right?</p>
<p>And the problem with just approaching</p>
<p>things in this way of the punitive way,</p>
<p>we just have to stop these companies.</p>
<p>Is it creates a chilling effect</p>
<p>on on reasonable exits in Silicon Valley?</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t that many great exits</p>
<p>and we want them to go through.</p>
<p>Now, I think if monopolies</p>
<p>need to be reined in,</p>
<p>there are other tools to use besides</p>
<p>just saying that those companies</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t acquire other companies,</p>
<p>no matter how unobjectionable they are.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s do things</p>
<p>like allow sideloading.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s basically.</p>
<p>What explain what that is?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s basically a way to say that</p>
<p>I think Google, the Android</p>
<p>already does it, but iOS does not,</p>
<p>where you would be able</p>
<p>to basically install an app</p>
<p>or download an app</p>
<p>without going through the Apple App Store.</p>
<p>You could enable competitive app stores.</p>
<p>Basically, you know, I think</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a real issue</p>
<p>that you have operating system monopolies.</p>
<p>I mean, Google, Android and iOS with Apple</p>
<p>and then Amazon with sort of.</p>
<p>You know, white label products,</p>
<p>those are all operating systems</p>
<p>that are competing</p>
<p>with apps on their own platform,</p>
<p>and there have to be some constraints</p>
<p>and rules around that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the operating system</p>
<p>will eventually dominate</p>
<p>and replace any app</p>
<p>they want to on the platform.</p>
<p>We saw that&rsquo;s what the whole</p>
<p>Microsoft thing was about.</p>
<p>Microsoft Netscape was 100% about that.</p>
<p>So I think if you can show</p>
<p>that somebody has an operating</p>
<p>system monopoly,</p>
<p>there absolutely should be rules</p>
<p>of constraints around that.</p>
<p>Does it mean the company</p>
<p>should never be able to buy anything?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, I think all that does</p>
<p>is stifle innovation</p>
<p>without really getting to the crux</p>
<p>of what the issue is.</p>
<p>I think you nailed it.</p>
<p>A good first step would be</p>
<p>allow other app stores.</p>
<p>So Google&rsquo;s app store could be on iOS.</p>
<p>iOS app store could be</p>
<p>on another platform, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I mean, the other issue here</p>
<p>is Lena Khan&rsquo;s been pretty clear.</p>
<p>Her entire thesis in taking the job was,</p>
<p>well, I want to prevent</p>
<p>downstream competitive issues.</p>
<p>So future competition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no better example</p>
<p>of a future competitive issue</p>
<p>and future consumer harm.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s how she phrases it.</p>
<p>Then this acquisition,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to do it</p>
<p>through the lens of future consumer harm,</p>
<p>this creates future consumer harm</p>
<p>because Figma is not going</p>
<p>to compete with Adobe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that it does.</p>
<p>It does massively, massively.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the the dissonance here.</p>
<p>It is great for consumers</p>
<p>because they will bundle it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll bundle the two things together</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll make it more valuable</p>
<p>and reduce churn</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll make it simple to buy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good for consumers, right?</p>
<p>You get more free stuff.</p>
<p>But future harm</p>
<p>and a future competitive harm</p>
<p>here is the marketplace</p>
<p>will be less competitive</p>
<p>if there is one less</p>
<p>independent, strong company in it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s and if you if they buy Canva,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the definition</p>
<p>of downstream competitive harm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a less competitive marketplace</p>
<p>with these two companies together.</p>
<p>Full stop.</p>
<p>So, Jake, do you if you&rsquo;re Lena Khan?</p>
<p>You actually pay attention</p>
<p>to this Adobe Figma thing</p>
<p>in like a serious way,</p>
<p>or are you still more focused on Amazon</p>
<p>and, you know, Facebook?</p>
<p>And I would hope that</p>
<p>they would do multiple things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, what would you do</p>
<p>if I was her?</p>
<p>I would create a rulebook</p>
<p>and apply the rulebook</p>
<p>evenly and fairly.</p>
<p>And this is the problem.</p>
<p>This feels very political.</p>
<p>It feels like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going after Facebook</p>
<p>because of the downstream</p>
<p>political issues Facebook causes.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re ignoring the Microsoft issue</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re ignoring issues like this.</p>
<p>You know, it just feels like</p>
<p>they have their thumb on the scale.</p>
<p>If you look at what happened</p>
<p>to the Visa Platt thing,</p>
<p>it was an enormous blessing in disguise</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>the the thing went away</p>
<p>and that was, I think,</p>
<p>like a five billion dollar acquisition.</p>
<p>And then Platt turned around</p>
<p>to raise money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>multiple teens billion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a wonderful</p>
<p>independent company.</p>
<p>To your point, Jason, that will now,</p>
<p>you know, create more competition</p>
<p>in a space that desperately needed.</p>
<p>Now, in that case,</p>
<p>that was sort of like</p>
<p>financial payments and rails</p>
<p>and Visa, MasterCard, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But that that that could also be,</p>
<p>you know, if there is a lot of attention</p>
<p>paid to the deal</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t end up being consummated,</p>
<p>that could be the positive outcome.</p>
<p>But if you want a future competition,</p>
<p>if you ask me if I was a betting man,</p>
<p>I think this thing is going to close.</p>
<p>I think it closes.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it closes.</p>
<p>It closes because it doesn&rsquo;t intrude</p>
<p>on the hot buttons of Washington,</p>
<p>not because the merits</p>
<p>of the antitrust are superior</p>
<p>to the Roomba deal or to that deal</p>
<p>that Facebook wants to have.</p>
<p>This is all about political</p>
<p>and cultural hot buttons.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think we all understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all political.</p>
<p>But I just can&rsquo;t go back to your question.</p>
<p>I think it was a really good question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had more chance</p>
<p>to think about about should Adobe</p>
<p>change the pricing of Figma?</p>
<p>Should they basically bundle it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken about the merits</p>
<p>of what Microsoft does.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Figma</p>
<p>should do that here.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve had a chance</p>
<p>to think about it,</p>
<p>and the reason is this, that</p>
<p>you have to think of pricing</p>
<p>as not an element by itself,</p>
<p>but as sort of the most important</p>
<p>element of a go to market strategy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>that you can basically reprice</p>
<p>Figma completely as part</p>
<p>of some other bundle</p>
<p>and expect not to create</p>
<p>massive disruption</p>
<p>to your go to market organization.</p>
<p>So, for example, you&rsquo;ve got now</p>
<p>a whole huge sales team at Figma,</p>
<p>including enterprise sales.</p>
<p>They are commissioned</p>
<p>based on their the quotas</p>
<p>that they close.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s based on the ACV</p>
<p>of the deals and so on.</p>
<p>If all of a sudden you price</p>
<p>this as being free</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s part of some bundle</p>
<p>that enterprises get</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re buying old Adobe.</p>
<p>Now, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>those salespeople can&rsquo;t earn</p>
<p>commission on that sale.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t be incentivized</p>
<p>to take that product</p>
<p>to market the same way.</p>
<p>The marketing team is tasked</p>
<p>with feeding the sales team.</p>
<p>So now all of a sudden</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, well, wait a second.</p>
<p>Can we spend money</p>
<p>to basically promote this product</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s going to lead to a deal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s priced at zero</p>
<p>because the enterprise already has</p>
<p>an ELA with Adobe?</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t just look at a pricing</p>
<p>change in isolation.</p>
<p>You have to look at it</p>
<p>as the tip of the spear</p>
<p>of the whole go to market.</p>
<p>I can tell you what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>because I kind of experience</p>
<p>this with with Yammer</p>
<p>when Microsoft bought</p>
<p>my company 10 years ago.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;m not critical</p>
<p>of Microsoft at all.</p>
<p>They were an extremely</p>
<p>high quality acquirer</p>
<p>that lived up to all their promises</p>
<p>and did everything</p>
<p>they said they were going to do.</p>
<p>I think if you ever get an offer</p>
<p>from Microsoft,</p>
<p>you should take it really seriously.</p>
<p>I think like I said,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re a great company,</p>
<p>great acquirer.</p>
<p>But I can tell you what happened</p>
<p>is that once Yammer was folded</p>
<p>in to the office suite</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have its own</p>
<p>independent pricing</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have its own</p>
<p>independent sales team,</p>
<p>it just disappeared.</p>
<p>I mean, the promotion of it to stop</p>
<p>because nobody had an incentive</p>
<p>to basically go sell it.</p>
<p>And nobody had an incentive</p>
<p>to go market and promote it.</p>
<p>And it just kind of disappeared.</p>
<p>And that is why you remember</p>
<p>a couple of years after we sold it,</p>
<p>Slack kind of came out of nowhere</p>
<p>and there was no one</p>
<p>to really oppose them</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>all the promotional activity</p>
<p>we had done around Yammer just ended</p>
<p>because, again, we weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have the incentive</p>
<p>that was created</p>
<p>by the sales organization.</p>
<p>Just to explain the pricing thing, David,</p>
<p>I think that the way</p>
<p>this decision will get made</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right or wrong.</p>
<p>But it will get made</p>
<p>not by the sales teams</p>
<p>and not by the product teams,</p>
<p>but it will get made by the CEO</p>
<p>and the CFO in talking</p>
<p>to their largest shareholders.</p>
<p>And the reason is because</p>
<p>there is an implied cost of capital</p>
<p>that Adobe has.</p>
<p>In fact, right now,</p>
<p>if you look at like all of the models</p>
<p>that all of the analysts use</p>
<p>is roughly around 9%.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have to achieve a return</p>
<p>on top of that cost of capital.</p>
<p>What that means is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be forced</p>
<p>to find a way in short order</p>
<p>to make this accretive</p>
<p>and to start generating</p>
<p>incremental cash flow.</p>
<p>And I think that they will be hard</p>
<p>pressed not.</p>
<p>To bundle and not to do</p>
<p>these creative packaging strategies,</p>
<p>because otherwise I think that</p>
<p>there is a risk</p>
<p>that this free cash flow machine</p>
<p>that folks have become</p>
<p>very addicted to it,</p>
<p>Adobe starts to shrink</p>
<p>and that will have huge ramifications,</p>
<p>I think, to the stock</p>
<p>and to the executives and to the morale.</p>
<p>And so I think that they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to do whatever it takes.</p>
<p>And by the way, you see that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen that in other companies</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve gone into this</p>
<p>phase of their growth,</p>
<p>Oracle being the best example.</p>
<p>You know, they have consistently</p>
<p>found ways to package, to bundle,</p>
<p>to cross sell, to upsell.</p>
<p>And they have incrementally</p>
<p>walked free cash flow generation up.</p>
<p>If they do that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking a huge risk</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen is.</p>
<p>So I agree with you</p>
<p>about what may happen.</p>
<p>This may be decided</p>
<p>by the CEO and the board,</p>
<p>but I think if they do this,</p>
<p>they could blow it.</p>
<p>I mean, the Dylan Field,</p>
<p>the founder in his blog post on this</p>
<p>said that Adobe is committed</p>
<p>to letting them run independently.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t run independently</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>your own independent pricing.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For how long is the question?</p>
<p>How long does it take to be independent?</p>
<p>Two years? Four years?</p>
<p>If all of a sudden Adobe salespeople</p>
<p>can sell this product</p>
<p>and include it in their bundle</p>
<p>and the marginal price</p>
<p>is basically free</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s part of some bundle,</p>
<p>that means the sale</p>
<p>has been taken away</p>
<p>from whoever the dedicated</p>
<p>salespeople are</p>
<p>on the Figma side of the house.</p>
<p>I can tell you</p>
<p>that will create irrationality</p>
<p>in the sales organization.</p>
<p>And very soon there&rsquo;ll be pressure</p>
<p>to consolidate</p>
<p>the Figma sales organization</p>
<p>with a larger Adobe sales organization.</p>
<p>They will be moved in.</p>
<p>They may become product</p>
<p>specialists or experts,</p>
<p>but the go to market</p>
<p>efforts will be consolidated.</p>
<p>And then Dylan&rsquo;s going to end up running</p>
<p>a quote, standalone version of Figma</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have its own</p>
<p>go to market organization.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t get the feedback</p>
<p>into product from your sales</p>
<p>and marketing team.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>a product and engineering team,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have eyes</p>
<p>and ears in the market.</p>
<p>I hear all of that.</p>
<p>I think that the Facebook</p>
<p>WhatsApp merger</p>
<p>is probably pretty instructive,</p>
<p>which is Jan had two years roughly</p>
<p>where he was left alone</p>
<p>to kind of like run independently</p>
<p>and then slowly and slowly</p>
<p>it was absorbed back into the mothership.</p>
<p>And, you know, that was a product</p>
<p>with zero monetization.</p>
<p>But there was a lot of strategic</p>
<p>touch points within WhatsApp</p>
<p>and, you know, core Facebook app</p>
<p>and everything else that they were doing.</p>
<p>And I think that you have to do that,</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re spending</p>
<p>tens of billions of dollars</p>
<p>on something,</p>
<p>there needs to be an industrial logic</p>
<p>that is beyond just let me</p>
<p>just buy this thing</p>
<p>and stick it on the shelf</p>
<p>and let it be on its own.</p>
<p>So I think that, you know,</p>
<p>that die is sort of cast.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re just debating</p>
<p>the timeline in which it happens.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what usually happens</p>
<p>is when they promise the founder</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll be left alone.</p>
<p>That usually last two years.</p>
<p>That coincidentally,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coincidentally</p>
<p>usually the length of the earn out</p>
<p>or the golden handcuffs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how long my golden handcuffs were.</p>
<p>And they left us alone for one year.</p>
<p>By the way, our error</p>
<p>are tripled that year.</p>
<p>But then once they got</p>
<p>serious about integration,</p>
<p>the organization started merging.</p>
<p>And really, I was just running</p>
<p>a product organization, which is fine,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not running</p>
<p>an independent company.</p>
<p>Because like I said,</p>
<p>you lose your eyes and ears.</p>
<p>You lose the pulse of the market</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not selling into the market.</p>
<p>Freeberg, how did YouTube do it so well?</p>
<p>It was a very different situation.</p>
<p>They were. Yes.</p>
<p>Google basically took a team of,</p>
<p>you know, two dozen people</p>
<p>and their infrastructure was terrible.</p>
<p>And they basically</p>
<p>rebuilt the entire company,</p>
<p>so it was the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Think about them</p>
<p>taking the front end shell of YouTube</p>
<p>and then they rebuilt</p>
<p>everything underneath it, ran it.</p>
<p>And then they actually put</p>
<p>their own people in</p>
<p>to optimize the front end.</p>
<p>They put their own ad</p>
<p>sales team on top of it.</p>
<p>I mean, they just bought</p>
<p>a skeleton of a growth engine</p>
<p>and they built everything.</p>
<p>And so it was a very different story.</p>
<p>And the one thing that YouTube,</p>
<p>the one thing that Google did so well</p>
<p>with that acquisition</p>
<p>was the conviction bet</p>
<p>that they made on the business.</p>
<p>And they made billions</p>
<p>and billions of dollars</p>
<p>of investments into that business</p>
<p>for years before it started to make money.</p>
<p>And that is a very hard thing to do,</p>
<p>because to Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>you often have this question</p>
<p>of where your free cash flows,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s your dividends,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s your buybacks</p>
<p>as a business gets to</p>
<p>a certain point of maturity.</p>
<p>But what Google had,</p>
<p>that many businesses of that scale</p>
<p>have never had before</p>
<p>is their extraordinary growth rate</p>
<p>that continued even as</p>
<p>they were of that scale.</p>
<p>So the the leeway</p>
<p>that Google&rsquo;s executives</p>
<p>and board were given by shareholders</p>
<p>was extraordinary,</p>
<p>not to mention the dual voting</p>
<p>where Larry and Sergei could decide</p>
<p>to do whatever the heck they wanted.</p>
<p>But they really were able</p>
<p>to take advantage</p>
<p>of their high growth rate</p>
<p>to take all this cash</p>
<p>they were generating and reinvest it</p>
<p>into this YouTube platform,</p>
<p>as well as many other things,</p>
<p>many of which haven&rsquo;t worked out.</p>
<p>But when they do work out,</p>
<p>you have a business</p>
<p>that I think YouTube&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably worth what?</p>
<p>Three hundred, four hundred,</p>
<p>five hundred billion dollars</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>And and it&rsquo;s really paid back multiple.</p>
<p>So YouTube&rsquo;s really a one off</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a one off acquirer</p>
<p>and it was a one off</p>
<p>kind of acquisition integration</p>
<p>scenario that we haven&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>What Google, in effect,</p>
<p>got when they acquired</p>
<p>YouTube was a flywheel.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a brand</p>
<p>and it was a network effect</p>
<p>that the network effect was massive.</p>
<p>It was off to the races.</p>
<p>And I remember Google had Google videos,</p>
<p>but they just couldn&rsquo;t come close</p>
<p>to catching YouTube</p>
<p>because the flywheel of creators</p>
<p>wanted to be where all the viewers were</p>
<p>and viewers wanted to be</p>
<p>where the most content was.</p>
<p>It was just impossible to catch.</p>
<p>But that organization</p>
<p>was relatively tiny</p>
<p>at the time it was acquired</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t have any monetization</p>
<p>and it was being deluged.</p>
<p>It was being deluged by legal problems</p>
<p>that that Google legal could solve.</p>
<p>Very unique situation.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was one of the bold</p>
<p>acquisitions of all time.</p>
<p>But what was incredible</p>
<p>is right after the acquisition</p>
<p>and Google started to scale this thing,</p>
<p>most of the content being watched</p>
<p>on YouTube was copyright content.</p>
<p>And I was at a conference</p>
<p>and I remember Philippe Daumon,</p>
<p>the CEO of Viacom, stood up</p>
<p>and Larry Page and Eric</p>
<p>or Larry and Sergey</p>
<p>or someone was on stage</p>
<p>and he yelled at them</p>
<p>and he was like,</p>
<p>you guys are making all this money</p>
<p>and growing this YouTube business</p>
<p>off of the back of our content.</p>
<p>And, you know, the DMCA,</p>
<p>the Digital Millennium Copyright Act</p>
<p>says that someone can file</p>
<p>a takedown notice</p>
<p>and then the platform</p>
<p>has a period of time</p>
<p>to respond and to deal with it.</p>
<p>And the amount of time</p>
<p>it was taking them to deal with it,</p>
<p>new content was being uploaded</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;d have to file</p>
<p>another takedown notice.</p>
<p>So it created this insurmountable</p>
<p>you know, copyright, copyright thing.</p>
<p>And and then what did Google do</p>
<p>that YouTube would have</p>
<p>never been able to do?</p>
<p>To Sax&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>they built an engine</p>
<p>that could automatically</p>
<p>recognize copyright content</p>
<p>and pull it down</p>
<p>before it was made publicly available</p>
<p>finger without ruining</p>
<p>the user experience</p>
<p>of instant upload</p>
<p>and availability of content</p>
<p>for the fingerprint system</p>
<p>was even more nuanced than that.</p>
<p>The fingerprint system</p>
<p>not only told him, hey,</p>
<p>this is an SNL skit</p>
<p>or this is a music video from Prince.</p>
<p>It said, what would you like to do?</p>
<p>And it put the power in their hands</p>
<p>and said, turn it off, claim it,</p>
<p>and we get the money from it.</p>
<p>And then it was like, well,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re telling you</p>
<p>before you even know about it.</p>
<p>And what all these people did</p>
<p>was they say, OK, yeah,</p>
<p>you can make a remix of my Prince</p>
<p>song or this episode of a TV show.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll collect the money.</p>
<p>And that was just, yeah,</p>
<p>the revenue share</p>
<p>was the brilliant part about it</p>
<p>because you put the power</p>
<p>in the copyright holders names.</p>
<p>This just speaks to how singularly</p>
<p>how singular and unique that deal was,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>any other company at that time,</p>
<p>maybe Microsoft</p>
<p>would have been able</p>
<p>to develop technology</p>
<p>to do this and do it at the scale</p>
<p>and do it with this low latency</p>
<p>and high speed for users and so on.</p>
<p>It really was.</p>
<p>A singular transaction,</p>
<p>which Friberg, I think,</p>
<p>speaks to their accumulation of talent,</p>
<p>especially in those early years</p>
<p>where they were just like</p>
<p>hire smart people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll figure out</p>
<p>what to do with them later.</p>
<p>They actually had those people</p>
<p>sitting around</p>
<p>who could just go jump on the YouTube team.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Salt Salar Comongar</p>
<p>went and ran YouTube</p>
<p>and absolutely crushed it.</p>
<p>Probably one of the best CEO runs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s never talked about</p>
<p>in the history of tech.</p>
<p>He stepped in and he ran YouTube.</p>
<p>And now Susan runs it.</p>
<p>You know, another incredible run</p>
<p>and monetizing that thing since.</p>
<p>But I mean, and these are people,</p>
<p>by the way, both Salar and Susan</p>
<p>were sub 30 employee people at Google.</p>
<p>So, yeah, good point.</p>
<p>Nick, can we throw up the slide</p>
<p>contrasting valuation to ARR?</p>
<p>This is actually more interesting</p>
<p>than just who made all the money.</p>
<p>So I actually created a plot.</p>
<p>ARR is the red chart</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the right axis.</p>
<p>So as we talked about,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at around 400,</p>
<p>450 million of ARR right now.</p>
<p>And then the left axis</p>
<p>is expected value.</p>
<p>Basically, this was their valuation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in purple.</p>
<p>And it obviously it goes up</p>
<p>to the 20 billion or 22 billion</p>
<p>that Adobe just paid.</p>
<p>You can see E was the last round</p>
<p>they did in 2021</p>
<p>where they were valued at 10 billion.</p>
<p>Before that, they were valued</p>
<p>at two billion in 2020.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the series C,</p>
<p>I think they were valued at like</p>
<p>440 million or something like that.</p>
<p>And then I think the B,</p>
<p>they were valued at like 125 million.</p>
<p>And then the A, they were valued</p>
<p>at like 50 ish million, you know.</p>
<p>And then there were seed and so forth.</p>
<p>I think what you see here is that</p>
<p>is how efficient in a way</p>
<p>venture capital is,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s tracking</p>
<p>just slightly ahead of ARR.</p>
<p>It is predicting</p>
<p>where the hockey stick is.</p>
<p>So first of all, look at ARR.</p>
<p>It is as close to a pure hockey stick</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve ever seen in SAS.</p>
<p>Kudos to them.</p>
<p>I mean, the crazy thing</p>
<p>is just how long it took</p>
<p>for the hockey stick to get going.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you invest in this company?</p>
<p>Did you see it?</p>
<p>Well, no, we didn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Also, look at what a late</p>
<p>bloomer this thing is, you know.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I see it like look, look</p>
<p>like hockey stick</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really start inflecting</p>
<p>until 2018, 2019, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more that your</p>
<p>table is more striking</p>
<p>where these guys for years</p>
<p>were toiling away.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden</p>
<p>this thing just took off, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really this was such a late bloomer.</p>
<p>And for anyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing a SAS company</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in it five years</p>
<p>and you still have zero revenue</p>
<p>and like that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>I mean, they basically</p>
<p>were a zero for five years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing exactly absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s a $20 billion exit</p>
<p>five years later.</p>
<p>I actually think</p>
<p>I think the only hard round</p>
<p>to invest in this company</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>if you were going to invest in.</p>
<p>I think the 2014.</p>
<p>Time period 2015</p>
<p>because you were investing</p>
<p>in a company that hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even launched yet</p>
<p>that had been grinding</p>
<p>for three or four years</p>
<p>with, by the way,</p>
<p>the founder was like 19</p>
<p>when he started this.</p>
<p>He was a teal fellow.</p>
<p>He was one of the first,</p>
<p>you know, 20 under 20 teal fellows.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And he dropped out of school to do this.</p>
<p>And, you know, and they spent</p>
<p>several years in the wilderness.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>it would have been hard to invest</p>
<p>is maybe not the first seed round,</p>
<p>because you could tell</p>
<p>this guy was brilliant.</p>
<p>He had a really specific idea.</p>
<p>Moving design tools to the cloud was,</p>
<p>I think, like a very clear</p>
<p>and sensible vision, clear.</p>
<p>You know, why now underlying trend?</p>
<p>I always say my three biggest traits</p>
<p>for entrepreneurial success.</p>
<p>One of them is grit.</p>
<p>I mean, you know,</p>
<p>if you have a high index on grit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to grind your way there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that&rsquo;s a really incredible.</p>
<p>This chart is brilliant</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>what we see in the seed stage</p>
<p>is right before that series</p>
<p>that is where most people give up sacks.</p>
<p>You know, you get three or four years in.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t paying for the products.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re under resourced</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t get the A</p>
<p>and they got, you know,</p>
<p>that 2013, 14, 15 period.</p>
<p>They were probably trying to get an A.</p>
<p>But it take them two years to get the A.</p>
<p>And then somebody finally decided</p>
<p>easy for a young person to give up</p>
<p>and go get a friggin job at Google</p>
<p>or go back to school</p>
<p>and to to grind it out,</p>
<p>to have the grit and the persistence</p>
<p>and commit to your vision.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t pivot away.</p>
<p>He persisted and he executed.</p>
<p>He clarified.</p>
<p>He clarified. Right. Yeah.</p>
<p>But he but he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t go five steps away and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a new startup.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>there was no his business, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no pivot here.</p>
<p>Yeah. Dylan Field, by the way,</p>
<p>is the founder.</p>
<p>I had him on the pod back in the day</p>
<p>and really the, you know,</p>
<p>ultimate customer focus,</p>
<p>customer obsession.</p>
<p>Like I said, that wins.</p>
<p>You need to just have your pulse</p>
<p>on what your customers are saying</p>
<p>constantly, because the answer is there.</p>
<p>You just have to develop it</p>
<p>and give it to them.</p>
<p>By the way, also in this chart,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, I think, very interesting.</p>
<p>Saks, I&rsquo;m interested</p>
<p>in your position on this.</p>
<p>If you look at the chart one more time,</p>
<p>they could have turned on monetization,</p>
<p>I think, a year or two before they did.</p>
<p>So they purposely didn&rsquo;t charge for it</p>
<p>to get the network effects going.</p>
<p>I would love to see and hear</p>
<p>the number of users as a third vector,</p>
<p>you know, as a third line on here,</p>
<p>because I think they started</p>
<p>getting a lot of users in 2014, 2015, 2016.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when that&rsquo;s why they got the seed.</p>
<p>But they purposely did not charge</p>
<p>to let the network.</p>
<p>Yeah, 2015 was a private beta.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they were even</p>
<p>had a product in 2014</p>
<p>that was usable yet.</p>
<p>2015 was private beta.</p>
<p>2016 was public launch.</p>
<p>And then they turned on monetization in 2017.</p>
<p>And then they turned on</p>
<p>enterprise pricing in 2018.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>sound progression.</p>
<p>I, I&rsquo;m not, I mean, to be honest,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of taking three</p>
<p>or four years in the wilderness</p>
<p>to build your product.</p>
<p>I think you need to get to market sooner.</p>
<p>But I do think it is a little different</p>
<p>in an existing industry</p>
<p>where the table stakes are high.</p>
<p>So, you know, Adobe</p>
<p>is not a cloud based product,</p>
<p>but those were very rich client products.</p>
<p>And so to get to the point</p>
<p>where you could even compete with them</p>
<p>with the classic Clay Christensen</p>
<p>Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma</p>
<p>lightweight version of the product,</p>
<p>there were significant</p>
<p>table stakes there.</p>
<p>And it was a significant</p>
<p>technical challenge to move</p>
<p>design tools into the browser.</p>
<p>They had to do a lot of</p>
<p>cutting edge browser tech.</p>
<p>The browser wasn&rsquo;t ready for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, this chart is going to be</p>
<p>calling in a few years.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m doing after all in</p>
<p>48 hours after it,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Come join me with your questions.</p>
<p>SPACs are back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw on the news,</p>
<p>but Freeberg launched a SPAC.</p>
<p>Freeberg, no, no, no.</p>
<p>He he he announced a target</p>
<p>and a merger agreement.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>So now he goes into the D-SPAC process.</p>
<p>Now we have two out of four</p>
<p>besties have SPAC&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you want to tell us</p>
<p>about what you SPAC&rsquo;d?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we announced</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re merging</p>
<p>the production board SPAC,</p>
<p>which is TPB Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>with Lavoro, which is the largest</p>
<p>agricultural inputs retailer</p>
<p>in Brazil</p>
<p>and operates across Latin America.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve got a good slide</p>
<p>in the presentation</p>
<p>that I think echoes</p>
<p>some of the points I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>on our podcast here</p>
<p>about the importance of having</p>
<p>resiliency and redundancy</p>
<p>in global food supply chains</p>
<p>and increasing famine risk.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a slide that shows</p>
<p>for about 30 years,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve reduced</p>
<p>the number of people globally</p>
<p>that have been undernourished</p>
<p>down to about 600 million</p>
<p>as of about three or four years ago.</p>
<p>And in the last three years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen that number spike</p>
<p>back up to 800 million,</p>
<p>which we thought we were done</p>
<p>with global famine.</p>
<p>And now here we are</p>
<p>facing these issues again.</p>
<p>Climate change, the lockdown,</p>
<p>supply chain disruption,</p>
<p>the Ukraine war</p>
<p>and all the other geopolitical</p>
<p>tension issues.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been a big thesis</p>
<p>of mine individually.</p>
<p>You guys know we&rsquo;ve talked offline</p>
<p>about some investments I&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>and my strong interest in the area.</p>
<p>Brazil and Latin America</p>
<p>is the largest ag export</p>
<p>market in the world.</p>
<p>So they produce calories</p>
<p>for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And farmers there largely lag</p>
<p>in terms of technology adoption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a nice Brazilian farm</p>
<p>as my background today.</p>
<p>But technology adoption</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look like it does in the US.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge opportunity</p>
<p>to influence and drive</p>
<p>productivity up in that region.</p>
<p>And so we partnered</p>
<p>with the largest ag retailer,</p>
<p>ag retailers, the local locations</p>
<p>that work with farmers.</p>
<p>They have these teams</p>
<p>called agronomists.</p>
<p>They meet with the farmers</p>
<p>typically weekly,</p>
<p>help them make decisions</p>
<p>about what products to use,</p>
<p>what to do, how to do it.</p>
<p>And so with the footprint</p>
<p>and the reach that they have,</p>
<p>I think we can really drive up</p>
<p>productivity per acre</p>
<p>across the region,</p>
<p>increased total</p>
<p>global calorie production.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so excited about it.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a great business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the financials</p>
<p>are presented in the</p>
<p>in the investor presentation</p>
<p>and will be published</p>
<p>with the SEC here</p>
<p>in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a scaled business,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a profitable business</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s growing</p>
<p>pretty significantly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got great tailwinds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great base business.</p>
<p>But for me, there&rsquo;s huge opportunity</p>
<p>to continue to drive</p>
<p>what their drive technology</p>
<p>through the platform</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also making</p>
<p>100 million dollar investment</p>
<p>of our balance sheet into the company.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s big skin in the game.</p>
<p>Big skin in the game.</p>
<p>And, you know, we put two thirds</p>
<p>of our these founder promote shares.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, you know, the only vest</p>
<p>if we can hit the stock</p>
<p>price of 1250 and 15</p>
<p>over the next three years.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we lose them.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve really tried to align</p>
<p>ourselves with shareholders</p>
<p>and really put our money</p>
<p>where our mouth is on this</p>
<p>and show people that,</p>
<p>you know, that this is a real</p>
<p>strategic partnership for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, you know,</p>
<p>an investment that we intend to kind of.</p>
<p>You know, hold for</p>
<p>a short period of time,</p>
<p>this is a key platform for me,</p>
<p>for our for our TPB business</p>
<p>and for many of the companies</p>
<p>that we operate at TPB.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m super excited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a very hard process.</p>
<p>As Chamath can attest</p>
<p>and as we all talk about,</p>
<p>capital markets are very</p>
<p>difficult right now.</p>
<p>Getting a transaction announced</p>
<p>is the first step.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a bigger step</p>
<p>of getting it closed.</p>
<p>But yeah, a lot of work,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m super excited about this.</p>
<p>And thanks for letting me</p>
<p>talk about it. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, and the other thing I just want</p>
<p>to double click on there, Chamath,</p>
<p>this idea that two thirds</p>
<p>of the sponsor promote</p>
<p>have to hit certain hurdles.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>a pretty good thing</p>
<p>for folks who maybe want to invest</p>
<p>to just say, hey, yeah, this is great.</p>
<p>Where there&rsquo;s some alignment</p>
<p>in how these shares get distributed.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a good feature.</p>
<p>I think that the thing with SPACs</p>
<p>in general in a moment like this</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s it actually performs</p>
<p>better in periods of high volatility.</p>
<p>And the reason is because,</p>
<p>you know, you have this redemption</p>
<p>feature which essentially allows you</p>
<p>to get back your your basis.</p>
<p>And so meanwhile, while, you know,</p>
<p>Friedberg was hunting</p>
<p>for a deal or whatever,</p>
<p>that cash, you know,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve contributed into this back</p>
<p>sits in a savings account</p>
<p>that then actually is generating some,</p>
<p>you know, reasonable interest as rates go up.</p>
<p>So the whole combination</p>
<p>of all of this stuff</p>
<p>actually makes back a pretty good</p>
<p>risk adjusted vehicle</p>
<p>when the markets are highly volatile,</p>
<p>because if at any point</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like how you feel,</p>
<p>even if you love the deal,</p>
<p>you just vote to redeem,</p>
<p>get your ten dollars back</p>
<p>and effectively win the market.</p>
<p>Right. Let&rsquo;s say the market</p>
<p>goes down 30 percent from here</p>
<p>to March of next year</p>
<p>when Friedberg&rsquo;s deal closes.</p>
<p>Well, an investor could theoretically</p>
<p>just say, you know what?</p>
<p>I just want my ten dollars back.</p>
<p>Now, all of a sudden</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve gotten zero.</p>
<p>They felt zero percentage</p>
<p>of that drawdown.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>about the structure</p>
<p>in a moment like this.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of really interesting features</p>
<p>that that SPACs in the future,</p>
<p>I think, will have to incorporate</p>
<p>in order to in order to be a successful</p>
<p>tool in the toolbox.</p>
<p>One thing I learned from,</p>
<p>I guess, the Pattern AG company</p>
<p>that I think you incubated as well,</p>
<p>or was that a company?</p>
<p>Yeah, you incubated as well.</p>
<p>Yeah. And you guys invested</p>
<p>through your launch platform.</p>
<p>Yeah. So we invested in this syndicate.</p>
<p>Is that the way this retail works</p>
<p>is we have farmers,</p>
<p>but then there are these retailers</p>
<p>or these sales reps,</p>
<p>I guess they call them in the industry</p>
<p>that service the farmers.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what this.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly how this technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how else is a farmer supposed to know</p>
<p>what to buy and what to do?</p>
<p>So ag retail, the local retail store,</p>
<p>the people that work there</p>
<p>are called agronomists.</p>
<p>And so the agronomists are like</p>
<p>technical salespeople.</p>
<p>They understand the science</p>
<p>and the technology of farming.</p>
<p>They understand</p>
<p>what the farmers have done in the past.</p>
<p>And then they partner with them</p>
<p>to help them decide</p>
<p>what to do going forward,</p>
<p>what products to buy, how to use them,</p>
<p>how to get the most out of their land.</p>
<p>And so when new technology,</p>
<p>when new ag technology comes to market,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the retailer</p>
<p>that can influence the farmer</p>
<p>to make a decision on making a switch</p>
<p>or using a new tool</p>
<p>or using some software,</p>
<p>you know, to drive that decision.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why ag retail is so important.</p>
<p>And why it&rsquo;s critical</p>
<p>for any new technology</p>
<p>to get adopted in farming,</p>
<p>it has to go through retail.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s the big ag input companies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the seed companies</p>
<p>and the chemistry companies</p>
<p>and the protection companies</p>
<p>and the software companies.</p>
<p>They all don&rsquo;t sell direct to farmers.</p>
<p>Typically, they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through these retailers.</p>
<p>And so is there a version of Lavoro</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been that&rsquo;s an American company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s public or not?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s called Nutrien.</p>
<p>And so Nutrien own CPS,</p>
<p>which is the largest retail</p>
<p>chain in the US ag retail chain in the US</p>
<p>about, I think,</p>
<p>70, 80 percent of Nutrien&rsquo;s business</p>
<p>is actually fertilizer production.</p>
<p>And then the rest is the retail business.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the key comp</p>
<p>that we actually show</p>
<p>in our financial presentation</p>
<p>that we published yesterday.</p>
<p>How is Nutrien done</p>
<p>just as a public market?</p>
<p>Do people understand sort of the value</p>
<p>that it creates in the marketplace?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in the last year,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about on the show,</p>
<p>companies that are in the fertilizer</p>
<p>business are making money hand over fist</p>
<p>because of the</p>
<p>the issues with the supply chain</p>
<p>for natural gas, potash and phosphates.</p>
<p>And so if you have access to supply</p>
<p>like Nutrien does</p>
<p>and various other fertilizer companies,</p>
<p>do you are absolutely</p>
<p>minting money this year.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re having record</p>
<p>earnings right now.</p>
<p>And, you know, people are kind of</p>
<p>estimating that the fertilizer market</p>
<p>will kind of reset.</p>
<p>And as a result,</p>
<p>these companies are over earning right now,</p>
<p>which means that they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>low forward multiples.</p>
<p>But generally speaking,</p>
<p>yeah, these businesses</p>
<p>have done very well.</p>
<p>And one of the you know,</p>
<p>I would say the US is about 15 years</p>
<p>ahead of Latin America.</p>
<p>And remember, Latin America produces</p>
<p>and exports more calories than the US.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all and corn farmers</p>
<p>in Brazil, for example,</p>
<p>are only getting half the yield</p>
<p>of corn farmers in America</p>
<p>or a little more than half</p>
<p>per acre yield per acre.</p>
<p>And the reason is the retailers</p>
<p>in the US are so sophisticated</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re introducing services</p>
<p>and they make a bunch of money</p>
<p>selling services now.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the case 20 years ago.</p>
<p>So now they&rsquo;re offering farmers</p>
<p>advice using software</p>
<p>and and other kind of custom</p>
<p>soil testing services and whatnot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really changed agriculture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s given farmers data</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t have before</p>
<p>and help them make better decisions</p>
<p>using that data that didn&rsquo;t exist before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>you know, I would say</p>
<p>concentrated in the US</p>
<p>that kind of sophisticated behavior.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>We see it happen around the world now</p>
<p>because we need to grow more food</p>
<p>and we need to do it</p>
<p>without expanding land and acreage</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And we need to do it more sustainably.</p>
<p>Which is another kind of key part of this.</p>
<p>Did you worry a lot about</p>
<p>like the FX risk of?</p>
<p>You know, all these inputs</p>
<p>coming into Brazil,</p>
<p>having to deal in local currency,</p>
<p>then having to kind of get the revenues</p>
<p>out in US dollars</p>
<p>and all of that stuff.</p>
<p>How did you think about that?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>So when all ag commodities</p>
<p>around the world,</p>
<p>most commodities, right?</p>
<p>They trade in dollars.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>if the dollar strengthens</p>
<p>against the local currency, the AI,</p>
<p>the farmers actually make more money</p>
<p>and the input companies</p>
<p>charge more money in local currency.</p>
<p>So basically, the entire ag market</p>
<p>and around the world,</p>
<p>commodity markets, generally speaking,</p>
<p>inputs and outputs trade in dollars.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re a local business,</p>
<p>you actually make more money</p>
<p>when your local currency goes down</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re willing to spend more money.</p>
<p>And so businesses in a commodity</p>
<p>cyclical business</p>
<p>generally are currency</p>
<p>hedged because of that,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re selling stuff in dollars.</p>
<p>And then as a result,</p>
<p>the places that they&rsquo;re buying stuff</p>
<p>from charge them more</p>
<p>in their local currency</p>
<p>and they can still make a good spread.</p>
<p>So, you know, there may be fluctuations</p>
<p>in FX risk.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, I think we see</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just speaking generally here,</p>
<p>not about this particular transaction.</p>
<p>We generally see</p>
<p>and we saw this at Monsanto.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>All ag input companies,</p>
<p>when the local currencies devalue</p>
<p>in a market that they&rsquo;re selling into,</p>
<p>they charge more</p>
<p>and the farmers can afford to pay more</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re making more</p>
<p>selling their product</p>
<p>into the market.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I think this company is super interesting.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m rooting for you.</p>
<p>It looks it looks really cool.</p>
<p>And it seems like a very good</p>
<p>entry valuation, good margin of safety to.</p>
<p>Yeah, one point two billion dollar</p>
<p>one point two billion dollar valuation,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m reading correctly here.</p>
<p>So, yeah, congratulations.</p>
<p>Hard to get a deal done at this time</p>
<p>for people don&rsquo;t know FX</p>
<p>foreign exchange just.</p>
<p>Trading one dollar</p>
<p>or one currency for another.</p>
<p>Did you guys see that</p>
<p>there was a Title six lawsuit?</p>
<p>Filed against Pfizer for some,</p>
<p>you know, in the in the Civil Rights Act,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called Title six,</p>
<p>which means that</p>
<p>if you take federal funds of any kind,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t discriminate.</p>
<p>And Pfizer has a program</p>
<p>to recruit African-American</p>
<p>and Latino people into the company.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not being sued</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>Pfizer takes NIH grants,</p>
<p>they, you know,</p>
<p>work with the US government,</p>
<p>they work with Medicare,</p>
<p>they work with Medicaid.</p>
<p>And so as a result of that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really happening</p>
<p>one month before something else</p>
<p>that we talked about, which is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the affirmative action case</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to the Supreme Court, where</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Harvard, actually.</p>
<p>You know, push people</p>
<p>pushing back on Harvard&rsquo;s ability to</p>
<p>have some form of race based admissions.</p>
<p>So I just don&rsquo;t know if you guys</p>
<p>were monitoring this for me.</p>
<p>I just took a step back.</p>
<p>And I thought, look at what has happened</p>
<p>legislatively in 2022.</p>
<p>We basically repealed Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court also went after</p>
<p>concealed carry in New York</p>
<p>and said that New York cannot legislate</p>
<p>against concealed carry,</p>
<p>which had pretty big ramifications</p>
<p>with respect to gun laws.</p>
<p>The consensus opinion</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re going to repeal</p>
<p>affirmative action in the next month</p>
<p>or the Supreme Court is going to do that.</p>
<p>These are three pieces</p>
<p>of an enormous change</p>
<p>in the United States</p>
<p>civil society that</p>
<p>that has happened</p>
<p>in a really small,</p>
<p>condensed period of time.</p>
<p>So I have these thoughts</p>
<p>on affirmative action.</p>
<p>But my other thought is like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible how conservatives</p>
<p>have been able to organize</p>
<p>and how disorganized,</p>
<p>you know, progressive have been</p>
<p>in order to create</p>
<p>a countermaneuver against them.</p>
<p>Because this has been a systematic</p>
<p>effort since Karl Rove</p>
<p>literally wrote about it</p>
<p>in the mid 2000s and said,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to raise a bunch of money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to redistrict everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get the state</p>
<p>legislators on our side.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to basically,</p>
<p>you know, fund the federalist society.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to and they did it.</p>
<p>And in 20 years, they&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>an enormous amount of change</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not sure all Americans</p>
<p>agree with.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the progressives</p>
<p>are just kind of like</p>
<p>navel gazing at each other.</p>
<p>I mean, and then you left off</p>
<p>this past week, Chamath,</p>
<p>that it seems like</p>
<p>the gay marriage bill</p>
<p>is going to be put to a vote</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be able to find</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see that. What?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>And Ted Cruz said he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to vote for it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s attacking</p>
<p>religious freedom.</p>
<p>So we had talked on a previous episode</p>
<p>and I think you said</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t think gay marriage</p>
<p>would come up.</p>
<p>And well, no, if I had to guess</p>
<p>what the political gamesmanship</p>
<p>is here, because they think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to pass,</p>
<p>they want to bring it up for a vote</p>
<p>because it preserves the issue.</p>
<p>It intensifies the wedge issue.</p>
<p>When it looked like</p>
<p>they had enough votes,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t going to put it up</p>
<p>for a vote.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a lot of gamesmanship</p>
<p>here. Look, I think enough</p>
<p>Republicans should vote for this</p>
<p>just to pass it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think there</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some issues</p>
<p>with the way the bill is written</p>
<p>in terms of maybe requiring</p>
<p>religious organizations</p>
<p>to perform gay marriages.</p>
<p>I think that somebody should just</p>
<p>make an amendment to clarify</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the case to solve</p>
<p>this religious freedom issue.</p>
<p>I think if that happened,</p>
<p>then you get more Republicans on board</p>
<p>or at least it wouldn&rsquo;t have an excuse.</p>
<p>But yeah, look, I would like to see</p>
<p>enough Republicans vote for this</p>
<p>to take it off the issue.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>gay marriage is at any risk of being</p>
<p>overturned by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Remember, it was Gorsuch</p>
<p>who wrote that opinion.</p>
<p>So I think this is a scare tactic</p>
<p>that progressives are able to use</p>
<p>to fundraise off their base.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it&rsquo;d be nice</p>
<p>if enough Republicans would vote</p>
<p>to canonize</p>
<p>marriage equality so that</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the smart play here</p>
<p>for Republicans.</p>
<p>Yeah, it looks like, by the way,</p>
<p>breaking news in The Washington Post,</p>
<p>Democrats have postponed</p>
<p>the same sex marriage vote</p>
<p>until after the midterms.</p>
<p>So, but I mean, you can understand</p>
<p>why people are going to be</p>
<p>nervous about this after</p>
<p>Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing that because they want to</p>
<p>they want to run on it as an issue.</p>
<p>They want to have that as an issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>force it, though.</p>
<p>70 percent of people are in favor, right?</p>
<p>80 percent.</p>
<p>Look, if Republicans want to be smart,</p>
<p>find 10 Republicans in the Senate</p>
<p>who can support this.</p>
<p>Announce now that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to support it.</p>
<p>Come on, Republicans have a brain.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let them change the issue from</p>
<p>this economy that&rsquo;s spiraling out of</p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>I mean, the Republicans are clueless.</p>
<p>What do you guys think</p>
<p>is going on there?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>So FedEx stock has dropped</p>
<p>as much as 25 percent</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re taping this Friday</p>
<p>after the CEO,</p>
<p>after a little I don&rsquo;t know if you saw</p>
<p>the video I sent to the group chat, but.</p>
<p>Kramer, Jim Kramer was kind of pushing</p>
<p>him, do you think this recession</p>
<p>do you think he finally said, yes,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a global recession.</p>
<p>They missed on revenue and they have</p>
<p>cut their.</p>
<p>Predictions for next year severely</p>
<p>and the stock&rsquo;s way down, I think</p>
<p>based on what I heard on CNBC from</p>
<p>and reading some stories right before</p>
<p>this breaking news is happening, some</p>
<p>people think this is 60 40 market</p>
<p>versus management.</p>
<p>But either way, I think</p>
<p>the Fed&rsquo;s interest rates are doing</p>
<p>their job and less packages</p>
<p>are being shipped because people are</p>
<p>Chamath, you would think spending</p>
<p>less money.</p>
<p>And that was the whole point of this</p>
<p>exercise was to slow the economy down.</p>
<p>Freeberg.</p>
<p>I think this is a little bit of a</p>
<p>scratcher. This is a new CEO.</p>
<p>So I think the game</p>
<p>theory on this is that it made a lot</p>
<p>of sense for him to reset expectations.</p>
<p>I get that. And I think that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a reasonably smart thing to do</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re incoming,</p>
<p>you know, leader of a very complicated</p>
<p>organization.</p>
<p>That really is at the end of the</p>
<p>bullwhip, so to speak, on</p>
<p>on consumer demand.</p>
<p>The problem is, there&rsquo;s just so much</p>
<p>conflicting data.</p>
<p>You know, retail sales was pretty</p>
<p>reasonable.</p>
<p>You know, China actually looked a</p>
<p>little bit stronger than people</p>
<p>expected just this past week on some</p>
<p>data that came out there.</p>
<p>It looks like Europe is going to</p>
<p>really draw a hard line and make sure</p>
<p>that they spend whatever it takes to</p>
<p>have enough energy so that their</p>
<p>productivity doesn&rsquo;t fall off a cliff.</p>
<p>All of those signals would say that,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re not at the precipice</p>
<p>of this kind of like cratering of</p>
<p>demand.</p>
<p>And then you have Powell basically</p>
<p>saying, yeah, we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>another seventy five and, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to take rates to</p>
<p>probably somewhere between four and</p>
<p>five percent.</p>
<p>So the FedEx data point</p>
<p>was pretty starkly in contrast</p>
<p>with at least some of the data that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, it was a bit of a</p>
<p>head scratcher.</p>
<p>They got three things working</p>
<p>against them.</p>
<p>Number one,</p>
<p>Amazon just continues</p>
<p>to build out local delivery</p>
<p>infrastructure at an incredible</p>
<p>pace.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020,</p>
<p>Amazon was already up to 25 percent</p>
<p>market share,</p>
<p>which put them ahead of both FedEx</p>
<p>and UPS.</p>
<p>And FedEx has seen their market</p>
<p>share decline for the past</p>
<p>eight or nine years now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of a key</p>
<p>point. Number two is people are just</p>
<p>shipping less stuff, doing more</p>
<p>stuff digitally.</p>
<p>And number three is this recession</p>
<p>impact where</p>
<p>they obviously have key economic</p>
<p>indicators that allow them to do a</p>
<p>better job forecasting deliveries</p>
<p>than most companies, I would imagine.</p>
<p>And so they can see order volume and</p>
<p>trading volume and use that as a</p>
<p>predictor for</p>
<p>what volume for shipping is going to</p>
<p>be in the future.</p>
<p>And I would guess that all three</p>
<p>continue to work against them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they have a lot of</p>
<p>diversification in the business</p>
<p>and other ways to expand out into.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a key vertically</p>
<p>integrated player, namely Amazon,</p>
<p>that is investing heavily</p>
<p>to replace whatever they use you for.</p>
<p>I think as of a few years ago, Amazon</p>
<p>was only like two percent or three</p>
<p>percent of FedEx&rsquo;s revenue anyway.</p>
<p>But still, I would imagine Amazon is</p>
<p>playing a key role here.</p>
<p>Your first your first comment to me</p>
<p>is is now that sounds like the</p>
<p>most credible explanation.</p>
<p>And to blame a recession</p>
<p>is sort of a little bit of hiding the</p>
<p>cheese.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably fair to say that their</p>
<p>lunches get eaten by Amazon.</p>
<p>So I can understand why FedEx is</p>
<p>under a lot of pressure because of</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>But if you just compare it to just</p>
<p>all the other data, it doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>like this whole thing</p>
<p>makes any sense.</p>
<p>What you just said about competition</p>
<p>makes to me a lot more sense.</p>
<p>And yeah, competition with digital</p>
<p>and Amazon.</p>
<p>I mean, digital, like how much do you</p>
<p>guys sign letters today versus</p>
<p>e-sign?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just a lot and, you</p>
<p>know, I&rsquo;m giving an example.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a one percent impact.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably a few more</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>And these things all layer up.</p>
<p>Well, they could be losing market</p>
<p>share while still growing because</p>
<p>e-commerce is growing so violently</p>
<p>in the world. But Saks, what do you</p>
<p>think?</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s going on here is that</p>
<p>whatever the issues of FedEx and</p>
<p>no matter how overstated</p>
<p>these warnings may have been, I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re directionally correct.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying that the world&rsquo;s headed</p>
<p>for a global recession and</p>
<p>directionally, he appears to be</p>
<p>right. I mean, things look really</p>
<p>grim.</p>
<p>We just had this inflation report</p>
<p>that was much worse than what people</p>
<p>were expecting.</p>
<p>It was inflation was supposed to go</p>
<p>down to</p>
<p>8.0 percent.</p>
<p>And actually, it was 8.3</p>
<p>percent. That&rsquo;s why the stock market</p>
<p>cratered a few days ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the worst day in the stock</p>
<p>market.</p>
<p>I think maybe all year or certainly</p>
<p>since June, we&rsquo;re almost towards</p>
<p>the June lows.</p>
<p>Now, this FedEx executive</p>
<p>is saying we&rsquo;re headed for global</p>
<p>recession.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that the economic</p>
<p>news is just pretty grim here.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in a we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>stagflation. The Fed has to keep</p>
<p>raising interest rates at the same</p>
<p>time that we have persistent, high</p>
<p>chronic inflation.</p>
<p>And you have to wonder, you know, I</p>
<p>tweeted a few months ago that the</p>
<p>White House economic adviser,</p>
<p>Brian Deese, he said</p>
<p>that in this interview with</p>
<p>CNN, that the Biden</p>
<p>administration was willing to endure</p>
<p>a global recession in order to</p>
<p>keep Russia from controlling the</p>
<p>Donbass region in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Well, mission accomplished.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s getting its wish.</p>
<p>The administration has made some</p>
<p>progress in the Donbass,</p>
<p>but we are also having a global</p>
<p>recession.</p>
<p>So what percentage of this, what</p>
<p>percent of the recession and</p>
<p>inflation has to do with the</p>
<p>Russian invasion of Ukraine?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s meaningful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meaningful.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s a huge exacerbator</p>
<p>of all these problems.</p>
<p>If you were going to put a number on</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Listen, I don&rsquo;t think the economy is</p>
<p>going to get better with the risk of</p>
<p>war three hanging over our heads.</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>Yeah. But what percent of the</p>
<p>economic issue do you think is</p>
<p>percentage wise impact?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re in a recession.</p>
<p>Maybe you answer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re in a recession</p>
<p>yet.</p>
<p>You know, retail sales are still</p>
<p>quite strong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a lot of signals that</p>
<p>tell us that people</p>
<p>are still consuming a lot of</p>
<p>things and jobs, too.</p>
<p>And that GDP is pretty reasonable</p>
<p>and that jobs and wages, you</p>
<p>know, are pretty much, you know,</p>
<p>quite full. So I think, Sax,</p>
<p>you are right that we</p>
<p>will be there because you can only</p>
<p>bring rates up so high until you</p>
<p>break things.</p>
<p>Do you see there&rsquo;s a tweet by, I</p>
<p>think, a Charles Schwab analyst</p>
<p>today about that issue of</p>
<p>wages.</p>
<p>And she was tweeting off</p>
<p>to find it that for the second year</p>
<p>in a row, we now have</p>
<p>because of inflation, we now have</p>
<p>real wage decreases.</p>
<p>So you may be right about like where</p>
<p>things stand today.</p>
<p>But this is about the trajectory</p>
<p>right now of the economy.</p>
<p>And the trajectory is not good.</p>
<p>Inflation is not coming down as</p>
<p>fast as people were anticipating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse than expected.</p>
<p>You have the situation in Ukraine</p>
<p>where, listen, we can all cheer on</p>
<p>Ukrainians for this counteroffensive</p>
<p>that appear to be successful.</p>
<p>But we are playing with fire over</p>
<p>there. I mean, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recall a time during the Cold</p>
<p>War where we did anything remotely</p>
<p>this risky.</p>
<p>You have, listen, we have American</p>
<p>generals, American generals</p>
<p>were taking credit for this</p>
<p>counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Do you see this New York Times story</p>
<p>where they talk about the inside</p>
<p>moment of this Ukraine</p>
<p>counteroffensive?</p>
<p>So you now have America.</p>
<p>America is now giving Ukraine</p>
<p>more and more advanced weapons.</p>
<p>OK, this sort of the the</p>
<p>long range artillery, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>telling them where to point the</p>
<p>weapons or giving them the</p>
<p>intelligence for it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re training them on how to use</p>
<p>it. They&rsquo;ve got commanders on the</p>
<p>ground there and</p>
<p>and they actually are hand</p>
<p>correcting the battle plans.</p>
<p>The Ukrainians had a</p>
<p>counteroffensive plan.</p>
<p>The Americans said that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>enough and they rewrote it.</p>
<p>So the Americans are now doing</p>
<p>everything in this war except</p>
<p>pulling the triggers and taking the</p>
<p>bullets. And I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>minimize the sacrifice</p>
<p>the Ukrainians are making because</p>
<p>they are dying in huge numbers.</p>
<p>And, you know, we can all</p>
<p>respect and admire the sacrifice</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making for their own</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>But this is a very risky strategy</p>
<p>for the United States of America to</p>
<p>be pursuing.</p>
<p>I mean, we are we are basically</p>
<p>playing with fire and</p>
<p>we are, you know, this close to</p>
<p>being at war with a nuclear</p>
<p>armed Russia.</p>
<p>And we never came close to this</p>
<p>type of behavior during the Cold</p>
<p>War. And I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>changed so much that we have to</p>
<p>take this kind of risk.</p>
<p>Now, at the beginning of this</p>
<p>conflict, I said that I was open</p>
<p>to arming the Ukrainians under</p>
<p>Cold War rules, Cold War</p>
<p>rules, meaning covertly, like</p>
<p>we did in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We now have multiple examples of</p>
<p>the administration boasting and</p>
<p>taking credit, taking credit for</p>
<p>the counteroffensive, for the</p>
<p>sinking of the Moskva, for</p>
<p>killing Russian generals.</p>
<p>This seems very risky to me.</p>
<p>So, Saxon, a court</p>
<p>premise of the discussions we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had here is that the United</p>
<p>States screwed up the negotiation</p>
<p>with Putin by not taking NATO off</p>
<p>the table. Reuters</p>
<p>reported that Putin rejected a</p>
<p>Ukrainian peace deal at the start</p>
<p>of the war, at the start of</p>
<p>the war, Russian chief envoy on</p>
<p>Ukraine told Putin that a</p>
<p>provisional deal with Kiev had</p>
<p>been struck, deal would have</p>
<p>satisfied Russia&rsquo;s demand that</p>
<p>Ukraine stay out of NATO.</p>
<p>Two of three sources said the</p>
<p>push to get a deal finalized</p>
<p>occurred immediately after</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s February 24th invasion.</p>
<p>Does that change any of your</p>
<p>thinking on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happened here and Putin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>culpability?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a data point, you</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>But let me explain why I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just positive.</p>
<p>And by the way, I saw the</p>
<p>article, every neocon on Twitter</p>
<p>was basically tweeting this,</p>
<p>trying to prove that this</p>
<p>yeah, I would see it on</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s seeing your</p>
<p>Shimer analysis.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>OK, first of all, if you read the</p>
<p>article closely, this offer</p>
<p>did not come until after the</p>
<p>invasion started.</p>
<p>OK, and we already knew Zelensky</p>
<p>was publicly saying in the early</p>
<p>weeks of the war that they were</p>
<p>willing to take Ukraine off the</p>
<p>NATO off the table.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t that much</p>
<p>news. It happened after.</p>
<p>The other key point here is I</p>
<p>know it didn&rsquo;t happen too late,</p>
<p>but also the offer did</p>
<p>not come from the Americans.</p>
<p>This is a really important point</p>
<p>to understand about the Russian</p>
<p>position on this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just saying this based on</p>
<p>all their public pronouncements.</p>
<p>The Russians made an ultimatum</p>
<p>in December and then Lavrov</p>
<p>negotiated with Blinken in</p>
<p>January.</p>
<p>They were absolutely insistent</p>
<p>that they would accept nothing</p>
<p>less but a written guarantee</p>
<p>from Washington.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Well, the written guarantee was</p>
<p>necessary because they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always claimed that James</p>
<p>Baker, Uyghur Gorbachev</p>
<p>over, you know, German</p>
<p>reunification and not one inch</p>
<p>eastward. So they&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>demanded a written assurance from</p>
<p>the Americans.</p>
<p>And the reason they wanted from</p>
<p>America and not Europe</p>
<p>is because they know that Europe</p>
<p>are America&rsquo;s poodles</p>
<p>and Ukraine is a client state of</p>
<p>America. So listen, they wanted</p>
<p>a written guarantee from America</p>
<p>before the war started.</p>
<p>They never got that.</p>
<p>Now, if your point is to Putin,</p>
<p>do everything he could to avoid</p>
<p>this war. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>I will absolutely grant you that.</p>
<p>But we already knew that.</p>
<p>The question is, did the U.S.</p>
<p>State Department do everything</p>
<p>they could to avoid this war?</p>
<p>And my point is absolutely not.</p>
<p>They should have taken this</p>
<p>Ukraine issue off the table</p>
<p>in writing before the invasion.</p>
<p>Got it. OK, and you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about Ukraine.</p>
<p>No, I just it</p>
<p>was major news.</p>
<p>And we have an obligation, I think,</p>
<p>to close the loop on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we have an obligation</p>
<p>to listen.</p>
<p>People are taking this one article</p>
<p>on this one day.</p>
<p>There I think it&rsquo;s going to talk</p>
<p>about it, because, listen, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen all over Twitter that people</p>
<p>take this one article and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, see, there&rsquo;s nothing to</p>
<p>this. We&rsquo;re giving you the</p>
<p>opportunity, Saks.</p>
<p>Now, let me ask another question</p>
<p>for Freeberg. Freeberg.</p>
<p>The other follow up people would</p>
<p>like us to have made here is</p>
<p>we predicted famine</p>
<p>and massive disruption in food.</p>
<p>We debated that here.</p>
<p>You were pretty clear that this was</p>
<p>going to be or could be disastrous.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t turned out to be</p>
<p>disastrous yet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the update on, you know,</p>
<p>fertilizer is shipping, not</p>
<p>shipping? Are we going to have</p>
<p>global famine? Are we not going</p>
<p>to have global famine? What&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>update there based on this</p>
<p>conflict?</p>
<p>Yeah, we have a massive</p>
<p>starvation problem.</p>
<p>The U.N.</p>
<p>told</p>
<p>told everyone.</p>
<p>I mean, no one writes about this</p>
<p>stuff because it&rsquo;s seemingly not</p>
<p>interesting in mainstream media,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t friggin understand.</p>
<p>But the U.N.</p>
<p>thinks that three hundred and</p>
<p>forty five million people</p>
<p>now are incrementally</p>
<p>marching towards starvation.</p>
<p>And so I think they did this</p>
<p>at their meeting.</p>
<p>Yesterday, because</p>
<p>of the war in the Ukraine,</p>
<p>so David Beasley, whom who</p>
<p>I know well, he&rsquo;s the executive</p>
<p>director of the U.N.</p>
<p>World Food Program.</p>
<p>He told the U.N.</p>
<p>Security Council yesterday that</p>
<p>three hundred and forty five</p>
<p>million people are now facing</p>
<p>acute food insecurity</p>
<p>in 82 countries where the U.N.</p>
<p>operates, which is two and a</p>
<p>half times the number of acutely</p>
<p>food insecure people that existed</p>
<p>before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>And so this is creating, like we</p>
<p>talked about, these rippling</p>
<p>effects in terms of initially it</p>
<p>was fertilizer cost, which means</p>
<p>less food is being produced</p>
<p>locally.</p>
<p>Then there was the acute crisis of</p>
<p>getting food out of the Ukraine.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s less planted acres</p>
<p>and less yield getting out of</p>
<p>those acres, which</p>
<p>we said was going to start to</p>
<p>happen in the back half of this</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>And if you look at the price,</p>
<p>you know, a good proxy for this is</p>
<p>the price for corn.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at near record highs</p>
<p>for the last couple of years in</p>
<p>terms of corn pricing.</p>
<p>The twenty twenty three futures</p>
<p>pricing for next December for corn</p>
<p>is at six twenty a bushel.</p>
<p>You know, and it kind of</p>
<p>peaked out right around the</p>
<p>middle part of the the Ukraine</p>
<p>crisis in</p>
<p>April at six seventy three.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re getting right back to that</p>
<p>high point.</p>
<p>And so this is a major</p>
<p>problem that&rsquo;s brewing.</p>
<p>And as I highlighted at the</p>
<p>beginning of our talk today,</p>
<p>which I show in the presentation</p>
<p>for the Lavoro transaction</p>
<p>I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>We have done an incredible job</p>
<p>building a resilient.</p>
<p>A food supply and</p>
<p>excellent global supply chains</p>
<p>to feed people around the world</p>
<p>going back 30 years,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been able to steadily</p>
<p>decrease the number of people that</p>
<p>are food insecure or facing</p>
<p>famine and famine in the UN</p>
<p>definition is less than twelve</p>
<p>hundred calories per day on</p>
<p>average for a year.</p>
<p>And so we went from like a billion</p>
<p>people around the world facing</p>
<p>famine about 30 years</p>
<p>ago and got that number all the way</p>
<p>down to 600 million.</p>
<p>And then in the last two and a half,</p>
<p>three years, it&rsquo;s shot back up</p>
<p>to 800 million.</p>
<p>And now the UN thinks it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>shoot up even more.</p>
<p>So we may even be retracing our way</p>
<p>all the way back 30 years</p>
<p>because of the crises that have</p>
<p>enveloped.</p>
<p>The region around Ukraine</p>
<p>and the resulting impact on</p>
<p>fertilizer availability, fertilizer</p>
<p>pricing and so on.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>many ammonia fertilizer</p>
<p>plants, which is nitrogen fertilizer,</p>
<p>the main kind of component</p>
<p>of fertilizer in Europe are being</p>
<p>shut down because they run on</p>
<p>natural gas.</p>
<p>And so government agencies</p>
<p>and the local producers are</p>
<p>turning those plants off to make</p>
<p>more natural gas available for</p>
<p>heating.</p>
<p>Would you describe this, Freiburg,</p>
<p>as because we are seeing</p>
<p>the EU, you know, they remember they</p>
<p>made that decision.</p>
<p>This is why South America is so</p>
<p>important. But sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>Would you describe this, though,</p>
<p>because the EU was also at the</p>
<p>same time the UN was,</p>
<p>you know, highlighting these</p>
<p>concerns, the EU was also praising</p>
<p>the massive progress we made from</p>
<p>the Russia and the Ukraine,</p>
<p>Russia and Ukraine, allowing</p>
<p>fertilizer, allowing exports and</p>
<p>this resiliency being we got we</p>
<p>got wheat moving.</p>
<p>And then we got some fertilizer</p>
<p>exports moving.</p>
<p>So two steps forward, one step</p>
<p>back would be how you describe this</p>
<p>maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, nat gas prices are still</p>
<p>elevated. Right.</p>
<p>And nat gas availability in Europe</p>
<p>is obviously significantly</p>
<p>restricted. Will we get through it?</p>
<p>Will we get through it?</p>
<p>Do you think we can we can manage</p>
<p>this? Yeah, look, I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>many look at this. There&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>number of people, some number of</p>
<p>10s of millions, maybe hundreds of</p>
<p>millions of people who are going to</p>
<p>starve between here and there that</p>
<p>otherwise weren&rsquo;t going to be</p>
<p>starving. By the way, there&rsquo;s always,</p>
<p>you know, some hundreds of millions,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, of people around the</p>
<p>world that are starving under 1200</p>
<p>calories a day.</p>
<p>And that number climbing some</p>
<p>incremental amount, that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incremental 300, 400 million</p>
<p>people that didn&rsquo;t need to starve.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a condition we&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>going to be facing.</p>
<p>And so people like, hey, yeah,</p>
<p>people are still eating.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s still food around</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t pay much attention</p>
<p>to these third world countries, we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t pay much attention to these</p>
<p>underdeveloped nations because we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have press coverage there.</p>
<p>And when people are on the streets</p>
<p>and unable to eat, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to make everyday mainstream</p>
<p>media coverage.</p>
<p>But it is happening.</p>
<p>And statistically, it is a massive</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we&rsquo;re doing we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>a great job of covering Kanye and</p>
<p>Kim, but yeah, we maybe get some</p>
<p>reporters to cover the people</p>
<p>starving.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered and I appreciate you</p>
<p>guys giving me a chance to talk</p>
<p>about it, because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super important.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, you know, I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of this show is</p>
<p>at its best. I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>highlighting things that other</p>
<p>people are ignoring.</p>
<p>Listen, I just want to say on this</p>
<p>Ukraine situation, and this applies</p>
<p>to this episode as well as all the</p>
<p>previous ones. I don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>right about this issue, just like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Freeberg doesn&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>right about famine coming true.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want these things to</p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p>OK, if I could choose an outcome</p>
<p>right now, I would say be great</p>
<p>if the Russian army collapsed</p>
<p>because of its morale problem,</p>
<p>tucked its tail between its legs,</p>
<p>went back to Moscow.</p>
<p>And then the Ukrainians had the</p>
<p>good sense to</p>
<p>respect the rights of the Russian</p>
<p>speakers living in the Donbass and</p>
<p>Crimea. And this whole thing</p>
<p>basically tamped down</p>
<p>and basically was over.</p>
<p>OK, but look, I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an equal and opposite chance that</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>That certainly could happen.</p>
<p>OK, but I think there&rsquo;s an equal</p>
<p>and opposite chance that instead</p>
<p>what happens is that we climb</p>
<p>the escalatory ladder that</p>
<p>Putin, I think we are backing him</p>
<p>into a corner.</p>
<p>Everybody says that he cannot</p>
<p>survive the loss of this war.</p>
<p>And yet we&rsquo;re not willing to give</p>
<p>him an off ramp.</p>
<p>So what choice does he have but</p>
<p>to escalate?</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>It could mean a full mobilization</p>
<p>of that country.</p>
<p>It could mean they resort, if</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t achieve their aims</p>
<p>by conventional weapons, maybe they</p>
<p>resort to unconventional weapons.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This seems like a highly volatile,</p>
<p>risky situation.</p>
<p>And I just think that,</p>
<p>you know, we, the United States of</p>
<p>America, need to be thinking very</p>
<p>clearly about what is in</p>
<p>our interest, because all I see</p>
<p>is an identification.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so interested in helping</p>
<p>and identifying with the Ukrainians</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve lost sight of an American</p>
<p>interest that&rsquo;s separate and</p>
<p>independent of Ukraine&rsquo;s desire</p>
<p>for self-determination.</p>
<p>I can understand and respect</p>
<p>their nationalism and their</p>
<p>patriotism, but we are a different</p>
<p>nation. We better think really</p>
<p>carefully about our interests here.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think, David, sometimes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re misinterpreted as this is a</p>
<p>partisan issue for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a dove.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re David the Dove.</p>
<p>I have dubbed you David the Dove.</p>
<p>You are a dove, not a hawk.</p>
<p>You want peace.</p>
<p>Listen, I believe that if America</p>
<p>is going to risk war</p>
<p>with a nuclear-armed power, there</p>
<p>better be a vital interest at stake.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we should find every</p>
<p>diplomatic off-ramp we can.</p>
<p>So do you feel optimistic</p>
<p>about our ability to navigate,</p>
<p>Chamath, the Ukraine situation,</p>
<p>the war in Ukraine, famine,</p>
<p>supply disruption, energy?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll get through all</p>
<p>this? Are you optimistic?</p>
<p>I think that rates are going to go</p>
<p>somewhere between four and a half</p>
<p>to five percent.</p>
<p>I think Stan Druckenmiller is</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said this, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now ad nauseum, so I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>keep saying it.</p>
<p>But I think everybody has</p>
<p>consistently been wrong</p>
<p>and they have wanted inflation</p>
<p>to be a transitory</p>
<p>phenomenon that goes away.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been consistently wrong.</p>
<p>Even in our group chat, we see</p>
<p>these forecasts.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been utterly consistently</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>So rates are going to go higher</p>
<p>than people expect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll stay around longer</p>
<p>than people want.</p>
<p>This will have an impact to the</p>
<p>economy.</p>
<p>That impact in 2024,</p>
<p>2025 will not be that great.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>If you want to focus on Ukraine for</p>
<p>a second, there&rsquo;s something that I</p>
<p>think we should focus on, which</p>
<p>I read this interesting article</p>
<p>about Russian mothers.</p>
<p>And, you know, in the 1980s,</p>
<p>when Russia was at war with</p>
<p>Afghanistan, there</p>
<p>were these bodies that were sent</p>
<p>home to Russia.</p>
<p>And these mothers got very, very</p>
<p>upset and they protested.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>In 2000,</p>
<p>early 2000s, I think there was</p>
<p>there was a nuclear submarine</p>
<p>that basically sank, got shot</p>
<p>and sank.</p>
<p>And then Russian mothers protested</p>
<p>in the Chechen war.</p>
<p>They are a</p>
<p>group of individuals</p>
<p>in Russia that.</p>
<p>Have enormous</p>
<p>organizing power, it turns out.</p>
<p>And they, you know,</p>
<p>they they really can tell</p>
<p>what the real temperature is on</p>
<p>the ground.</p>
<p>What Putin has done so far</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s largely recruited</p>
<p>people from, you know,</p>
<p>the Spartan communities inside</p>
<p>of central Russia and used</p>
<p>third party contractors.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s minimized the risk of</p>
<p>the real cohort of the Russian</p>
<p>population who really stand,</p>
<p>you know, fervently against what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on.</p>
<p>So until you see that happening,</p>
<p>those guys have a long way</p>
<p>to go. And I think that this thing</p>
<p>is going to drag on for a really</p>
<p>long time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a paid army.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s obscuring the</p>
<p>impact on actual citizens in</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s half paid, but the other half</p>
<p>are from places where their</p>
<p>organizing power is limited.</p>
<p>And I think that that was Putin&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, calculation</p>
<p>seeing what has happened before.</p>
<p>Again, sort of like the tip of the</p>
<p>spear of these Russian mothers.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not seeing that.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>that means that the ability for</p>
<p>him to</p>
<p>manage perception inside</p>
<p>of Russia.</p>
<p>Is pretty apparently pretty</p>
<p>greater than people expected.</p>
<p>Yeah, greater than people expected.</p>
<p>So this is going to go on for as</p>
<p>long for much longer</p>
<p>than people think.</p>
<p>So I would just.</p>
<p>Prepare for this inevitable</p>
<p>outcome and just kind of, you know,</p>
<p>manage another year of slogging it</p>
<p>through a choppy waters might</p>
<p>be one way to look at this.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a very good way.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in a very volley</p>
<p>choppy market for the foreseeable</p>
<p>future.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And therein lies some</p>
<p>opportunities and</p>
<p>also maybe some discipline in</p>
<p>various markets.</p>
<p>One thing to just keep in mind where</p>
<p>most people feel these rate hikes</p>
<p>is in the 30 year fixed mortgage.</p>
<p>Right. This is where most Americans</p>
<p>are going to feel it.</p>
<p>And if you look at the chart,</p>
<p>you know, like this is a big jump up</p>
<p>from our absolutely free</p>
<p>money environment that most Americans</p>
<p>were feeling doing,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>you know, what do they call it when</p>
<p>you take out equity on your mortgage,</p>
<p>like a second mortgage or a</p>
<p>credit line, credit line,</p>
<p>most people have credit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>People were, you know, experiencing a</p>
<p>lot of free money and upgrading their</p>
<p>kitchens and taking money out of their</p>
<p>homes, yada yada.</p>
<p>But when you look at it historically,</p>
<p>you know, even at 6% or even if it</p>
<p>goes to 7% for mortgages,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot less than we our parents</p>
<p>experienced and we experienced for the</p>
<p>first half of our adult lives.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s surmountable.</p>
<p>And this number you don&rsquo;t think is</p>
<p>going to get up to above 10%.</p>
<p>Right. The 30 year fixed.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see that happening.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s manageable, which is</p>
<p>going to be choppy.</p>
<p>All right. Listen, Saks didn&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>promote it, but he has a wonderful film</p>
<p>at the Toronto Toronto Film Festival</p>
<p>about Dolly.</p>
<p>And he is doing an awesome</p>
<p>Dolly experience with the</p>
<p>AI that paints pictures.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re just going to insert into</p>
<p>the end of the program, the beautiful</p>
<p>work he&rsquo;s doing there and his Dolly</p>
<p>film is supposed to be excellent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the second film David is</p>
<p>producing after Thank You for Smoking.</p>
<p>So congratulations to our</p>
<p>own little Scorsese</p>
<p>for the sultan of science, the</p>
<p>dictator and</p>
<p>the David the Dove.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator,</p>
<p>Jason Calacanis, and we&rsquo;ll see you</p>
<p>next time.</p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
<p>Love you guys. Bye bye.</p>
<p>All right, so I&rsquo;m at the Dolly Land</p>
<p>exhibit here at the St.</p>
<p>Regis. The St.</p>
<p>Regis Hotel was a very important</p>
<p>hotel in Dolly&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>He actually lived in the penthouse</p>
<p>of the St. Regis in New York.</p>
<p>And the St.</p>
<p>Regis Hotel has very graciously</p>
<p>agreed to host this exhibition for</p>
<p>us. And this exhibition</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s basically a</p>
<p>rendering of</p>
<p>Dolly&rsquo;s studio or what Dolly&rsquo;s</p>
<p>studio might look like.</p>
<p>And those works of art are actually</p>
<p>generated by GPT-3,</p>
<p>the so-called Dolly Engine.</p>
<p>So thanks to the OpenAI team</p>
<p>and Sam Altman for giving us access</p>
<p>to Dolly, D-A-L-L-E.</p>
<p>And so fans can just come</p>
<p>here and they can use these</p>
<p>tablets to enter, you know,</p>
<p>what art they want to create.</p>
<p>They can just enter terms and</p>
<p>the, you know, the engine</p>
<p>will spit out art that</p>
<p>is made not obviously by Salvador</p>
<p>Dali, but it&rsquo;s in the style</p>
<p>of Salvador Dali.</p>
<p>So I thought it&rsquo;s a very cool way to</p>
<p>commemorate the film.</p>
<p>We are premiering at the Toronto</p>
<p>International Film Festival.</p>
<p>This weekend, this is an independent</p>
<p>movie I&rsquo;ve had in development for</p>
<p>something like over a decade.</p>
<p>And the great</p>
<p>actor, Academy Award winning actor</p>
<p>Ben Kingsley plays Dolly</p>
<p>and gives a phenomenal performance.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re excited to</p>
<p>premiere this movie, show it to the</p>
<p>world for the first time this</p>
<p>weekend.</p>
<p>All right. Thanks for watching.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to</p>
<p>the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone</p>
<p>crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Wes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m queen of Kinwab.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a</p>
<p>notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and</p>
<p>just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re about to be.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
