    <p>The universe doesn&rsquo;t care about your personal narrative.</p>
<p>You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the culmination of your whole project for happiness,</p>
<p>and you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mortality.</p>
<p>Mortality isn&rsquo;t just some far flung event.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.</p>
<p>So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects</p>
<p>and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with John Verweke,</p>
<p>a psychologist and cognitive scientist at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>I highly recommend his lecture series called Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,</p>
<p>which covers the history and future of humanity&rsquo;s search for meaning.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s John Verweke.</p>
<p>You have an excellent 50 part lecture series online on the Meaning Crisis.</p>
<p>And I think you describe in the modern times an increase in depression,</p>
<p>loneliness, cynicism, and wait for it, bullshit.</p>
<p>The term used technically by Harry Frankfurt and adopted by you.</p>
<p>So let me ask, what is meaning?</p>
<p>What are we looking for when we engage in the search for meaning?</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m talking about meaning, I&rsquo;m talking about what&rsquo;s called meaning in life,</p>
<p>not the meaning of life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some sort of metaphysical claim.</p>
<p>Meaning in life are those factors that make people rate their lives as more meaningful,</p>
<p>worth living, worth the suffering that they have to endure.</p>
<p>And when you study that, what you see is it&rsquo;s a sense of connectedness,</p>
<p>connectedness to yourself, to other people, to the world,</p>
<p>and a particular kind of connectedness.</p>
<p>You want to be connected to things that have a value and an existence</p>
<p>independent of your egocentric preferences and concerns.</p>
<p>This is why, for example, having a child is considered very meaningful,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re connecting to something that&rsquo;s going to have a life and a value</p>
<p>independent of you.</p>
<p>Now, the question that comes up for me, well, there&rsquo;s two questions.</p>
<p>One is, why is that at risk right now?</p>
<p>And then secondly, and I think you have to answer the second question first,</p>
<p>which is, well, yeah, but why is meaning so important?</p>
<p>Why is this sense of connectedness so important to human beings?</p>
<p>Why, when it is lacking, do they typically fall into depression,</p>
<p>potentially mental illness, addiction, self destructive behavior?</p>
<p>And so the first answer I give you is, well, it&rsquo;s that sense of connectedness.</p>
<p>And people often express it metaphorically.</p>
<p>They want to be connected to something larger than themselves.</p>
<p>They want to matter.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t mean it literally.</p>
<p>I mean, if I chained you to a mountain, you wouldn&rsquo;t thereby say, oh,</p>
<p>now my life is so fulfilling, right?</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;re trying to convey, they&rsquo;re using this metaphor to try and say,</p>
<p>they want to be connected.</p>
<p>They want to be connected to something real.</p>
<p>They want to make a difference and matter to it.</p>
<p>And one way of asking them, well, you know, what&rsquo;s meaningful is,</p>
<p>tell me what you would like to continue to exist even if you weren&rsquo;t around</p>
<p>anymore, and how are you connected to it, and how do you matter to it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way of trying to get at what is the source of meaning for you,</p>
<p>is if you were no longer there, you would like it to continue existing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the only part of the definition probably, because there&rsquo;s probably many</p>
<p>things that aren&rsquo;t a source of meaning for me that maybe I find beautiful</p>
<p>that I would like to continue existing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If it contributes to your life being meaningful, you are connected to it</p>
<p>in some way, and it matters to you, and you matter to it in that you make</p>
<p>some difference to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it goes from being just sort of true, good, and beautiful,</p>
<p>to being a source of meaning for you in your life.</p>
<p>Is the meaning crisis a new thing, or has it always been with us?</p>
<p>Is it part of the human condition in general?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent question.</p>
<p>And part of the argument I made in Awakening from the Meaning Crisis is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two aspects to it.</p>
<p>One is that there are perennial problems, perennial threats to meaning.</p>
<p>And in that sense, human beings are always vulnerable to despair.</p>
<p>You know, the book of Ecclesiastes is, it&rsquo;s all vanity, it&rsquo;s all meaningless.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also historical forces that have made those perennial problems more</p>
<p>pertinent, more pressing, more difficult for people to deal with.</p>
<p>And so the meaning crisis is actually the intersection of perennial problems,</p>
<p>finding existence absurd, experiencing existential anxiety, feeling alienated,</p>
<p>and then pressing historical factors, which have to do with the loss of the</p>
<p>resources that human beings have typically cross historically and cross</p>
<p>culturally made use of in order to address these perennial problems.</p>
<p>Is there something potentially deeper than just a lack of meaning that speaks</p>
<p>to the fact that we&rsquo;re vulnerable to despair?</p>
<p>You know, Ernest Becker talked about the, in his book Denial of Death,</p>
<p>about the fear of death and being an important motivator in our life.</p>
<p>As William James said, death is the warm at the core of the human condition.</p>
<p>Is it possible that this kind of search for meaning is coupled or can be seen</p>
<p>from the perspective of trying to escape the reality, the thought of one&rsquo;s own mortality?</p>
<p>Yeah, Becker and the terror management theory that have come out of it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been some good work around sort of providing empirical support for that claim.</p>
<p>Some of the work, not so good.</p>
<p>So which aspects do you find convincing?</p>
<p>Can you steel man that case and then can you argue against it?</p>
<p>So what aspects I find convincing is that human finitude, being finite,</p>
<p>being inherently limited is very problematic for us.</p>
<p>Given the extensive use of the word problematic, I like that you used that word</p>
<p>to describe one&rsquo;s own mortality as problematic.</p>
<p>Because people sort of on Twitter use the word problematic when they disagree with somebody.</p>
<p>But this, to me, seems to be the ultimate problematic aspect of the human condition</p>
<p>is that we die and it ends.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m not disagreeing with you, but I&rsquo;m trying to get you to consider</p>
<p>that your mortality is not an event in the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a state you&rsquo;re in right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to shift.</p>
<p>So your mortality is just a&hellip;</p>
<p>We talk about something that causes mortality fatal.</p>
<p>But what we actually mean is it&rsquo;s full of fate.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean in the sense of things are prewritten.</p>
<p>What I mean is the sense of the universe doesn&rsquo;t care about your personal narrative.</p>
<p>You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the culmination of your whole project for happiness,</p>
<p>and you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mortality.</p>
<p>Mortality isn&rsquo;t just some far flung event.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.</p>
<p>So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects</p>
<p>and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them.</p>
<p>The death is the indifference of nature of the universe to your existence.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, it is always here with us.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re vulnerable in so many ways other than just the ending of your biological life.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s interesting, if you rate what people fear most, death is not number one.</p>
<p>They often put public speaking as number one.</p>
<p>Because the death of status or reputation can also be a profound loss for human beings.</p>
<p>It can drive them into despair.</p>
<p>So as the terror management folks would say, as Ernest Becker would say,</p>
<p>that a self report on a survey is not an accurate way to capture what is actually</p>
<p>at the core of the motivation of a human being.</p>
<p>That we could be terrified of death.</p>
<p>And we, from childhood, since we realized the absurdity of the fact that the right ends,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve learned to really try to forget about it, try to construct illusions that allow us</p>
<p>to escape momentarily or for prolonged periods of time the realization that we die.</p>
<p>Okay, so first, I took it seriously, but now I want to say why there&rsquo;s some empirical work</p>
<p>that makes me want to reconsider it.</p>
<p>So terror management theory is you do things like you give people a list of words to read.</p>
<p>And in those lists are words associated with death, cough, and funeral.</p>
<p>And then you see what happens to people.</p>
<p>And generally, they start to become more rigid in their thinking.</p>
<p>They tend to identify with their worldview.</p>
<p>They lose cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s if you present it to them in that third person perspective.</p>
<p>But if you get them to go in the first person perspective and imagine that they&rsquo;re dying</p>
<p>and that the people that they care about are there with them, they don&rsquo;t show those responses.</p>
<p>In fact, they show us an increase in cognitive flexibility, an increase in openness.</p>
<p>See, so I&rsquo;m trying to say we might be putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>It might not be death per se, but the kind of meaning that is present or absent in death</p>
<p>that is the crucial thing for us.</p>
<p>By the way, to push back, I don&rsquo;t think you took it seriously.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you truly steel manned the case because you&rsquo;re saying that death is always</p>
<p>present with us, yes, but isn&rsquo;t there a case to be made that it is one of the major motivators?</p>
<p>Nietzsche, will to power, Freud wanting to have sex with your mother, all the different</p>
<p>explanations of what is truly motivating us human beings.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a strong case to be made that this death thing is a really damn good, if</p>
<p>not anything, a tool to motivate the behavior of humans?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the avoidance of death is not significant for human beings, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>proposing to you that human beings have a capacity for considering certain deaths meaningful</p>
<p>and certain deaths meaningless, and we have lots of evidence that people are willing to</p>
<p>sacrifice their biological existence for a death they consider meaningful.</p>
<p>Are you personally afraid of your death if you think about it?</p>
<p>As somebody who produces a lot of ideas, records them, writes them down, is a deep thinker,</p>
<p>admired thinker, and as the years go on, become more and more admired, does it scare you that</p>
<p>the ride ends?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to talk to me on all my levels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a biological organism, so if something&rsquo;s thrown at my head, I&rsquo;ll duck and things like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re asking me, do I long to live forever, no.</p>
<p>In the Buddhist tradition, there are practices that are designed to make you aware of simultaneously</p>
<p>the horror of mortality and the horror of immortality.</p>
<p>The thought of living forever is actually horrific to me.</p>
<p>Are those the only two options?</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re sitting with a loved one or watching a movie you just really love or</p>
<p>a book you really love, you don&rsquo;t want it to end, you don&rsquo;t necessarily always flip</p>
<p>it to the other aspect, the complete opposite of the thought experiment.</p>
<p>What happens if the book lasts forever?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s got to be a middle ground, like the snooze button.</p>
<p>Sure you don&rsquo;t want to sleep forever, but maybe press the snooze button and get an extra</p>
<p>15 minutes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s surely some kind of balance, that fear seems to be a source of an intense appreciation</p>
<p>of the moment, in part, and that&rsquo;s what the Stoics talked about, sort of the meditate</p>
<p>on one&rsquo;s mortality.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It seems to be a nice wake up call to that life is full of moments that are beautiful</p>
<p>and then you don&rsquo;t get an infinite number of them.</p>
<p>Right, and the Stoic response was not the project of trying to extend the duration of</p>
<p>your life, but to deepen those moments so they become as satisfying as possible so that</p>
<p>when death comes it does not strike you as any kind of calamity.</p>
<p>Does that project ring true for your own personal feelings?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>I used to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t so much anymore.</p>
<p>Part of it, as I&rsquo;m older and your temporal horizon flips somewhere in your 30s or 40s,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t live from your birth, you live towards your death.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a beautiful phrase, the temporal horizon flips.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>At what point is that?</p>
<p>The point before which the world of opportunity and possibility is infinite before you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like Peter Pan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these golden possibilities and you fly around between them.</p>
<p>Yes, very much.</p>
<p>And then when it flips, you start to look for a different model, the Socratic, the Stoic</p>
<p>model, Buddhism has also influenced me, which is more about, wait, when I look at my desires,</p>
<p>I seem to have two meta desires.</p>
<p>In addition to satisfying a particular desire, I want whatever satisfies my desire to be</p>
<p>real and whatever is satisfying my desire to not cause internal conflict but bring something</p>
<p>like peace of mind.</p>
<p>And so I more and more move towards how can I live such that those two meta desires are</p>
<p>a constant frame within which I&rsquo;m trying to satisfy my specific desires.</p>
<p>What do you think happens after we die?</p>
<p>I think mind and life go away completely when we die.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually significantly important for the kind of beings that we are.</p>
<p>We are the kinds of beings that can come to that awareness and then we have a responsibility</p>
<p>to decide how we&rsquo;re going to comport ourselves towards it.</p>
<p>Can you linger on what that means, the mind goes away?</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re playing music and the last instrument is put down, the song is over.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean the song wasn&rsquo;t beautiful.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean the song wasn&rsquo;t complex.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean the song didn&rsquo;t add to the value of the universe and its existence, but it</p>
<p>came to an end.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect in which some part of mind was there before the human and remains</p>
<p>after?</p>
<p>Something like panpsychism or is it too much for us limited cognitive beings to understand?</p>
<p>Something like panpsychism, I take it seriously.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a ridiculous proposal, but I think it has insoluble problems that</p>
<p>make me doubt it.</p>
<p>Any idea that the mind is some kind of ultimately immaterial substance also has for me just</p>
<p>devastating problems.</p>
<p>Those are the two kinds of framework that people usually propose in order to support</p>
<p>some kind of idea of immortality.</p>
<p>I find both very problematic.</p>
<p>The fact that we participate in distributed cognition, that most of our problem solving</p>
<p>is not done as individuals but in groups, this is something I work on, I&rsquo;ve published</p>
<p>on that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But most of the people who do work on systems of distributed cognition think that while</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such a thing as collective intelligence, there&rsquo;s no good evidence that there&rsquo;s collective</p>
<p>consciousness.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s often called zombie agency for that reason.</p>
<p>And so while I think it&rsquo;s very clear that no one person runs an airline, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a collective intelligence that solves that problem, I do not think that collective intelligence</p>
<p>supports any kind of consciousness.</p>
<p>And so therefore, I don&rsquo;t think the fact that I participate, which I regularly and</p>
<p>reliably do in distributed cognition, gives me any reason to believe that that participation</p>
<p>grounds some kind of consciousness.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s so many things to mention there.</p>
<p>First of all, distributed cognition, maybe that&rsquo;s a synonym for collective intelligence.</p>
<p>So that means a bunch of humans individually are able to think, have cognitive machines,</p>
<p>and are somehow able to interact through the process of dialogue, as you talk about, to</p>
<p>morph different ideas together, like this idea landscape together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting to think about, okay, well, you do have these fascinating distributed</p>
<p>cognition systems, but consciousness does not propagate in the same way as intelligence.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t there a case, if we just look at intelligence, if we look at us humans as a</p>
<p>collection of smaller organisms, which we are, and so there&rsquo;s like a hierarchy of organisms,</p>
<p>tiny ones, work together to form tiny villages that you can then start to see as individual</p>
<p>organisms that are then also forming bigger villages and interacting different ways and</p>
<p>function becomes more and more complex.</p>
<p>And eventually we get to us humans to where we start to think, well, we&rsquo;re an individual,</p>
<p>but really we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s billions of organisms inside us, both domestic and foreign.</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t that building up consciousnesses like turtles all the way up to us, our consciousness?</p>
<p>Why does it have to stop with us humans?</p>
<p>Are we the only, like, is this the phase transition when it becomes a zombie like giant hierarchical</p>
<p>village that first like, oh, there&rsquo;s like a singing angels and it&rsquo;s consciousness is</p>
<p>born in just us humans.</p>
<p>Do bacteria have consciousness?</p>
<p>Not bacteria, but maybe you could say bacteria does, but like the interesting complicated</p>
<p>organisms that are within us have consciousness.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s proper to argue, and I have, that like a paramecium or bacteria has a kind</p>
<p>of agency and even a kind of intelligence, kind of sense making ability.</p>
<p>But I do not think that we can attribute consciousness, at least what we mean by consciousness, this</p>
<p>kind of self awareness, this ability to introspect, et cetera, et cetera, to bacteria.</p>
<p>Now the reason why distributed cognition doesn&rsquo;t have consciousness, I think is a little bit</p>
<p>more tricky.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s no reason in principle why there couldn&rsquo;t be a consciousness for</p>
<p>distributed cognition, collective intelligence.</p>
<p>In fact, many, you know, philosophers would agree with me on that point.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more an issue of certain empirical facts, bandwidth, density of connection, speed</p>
<p>of information transfer, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceivable that if we got some horrible Frankensteinian neural link and we linked</p>
<p>our brains and we had the right density and dynamics and bandwidth and speed that a group</p>
<p>consciousness could take shape.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any argument in principle against that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying those contingent facts do not yet exist, and therefore it is implausible</p>
<p>that consciousness exists at the level of collective intelligence.</p>
<p>So you talk about consciousness quite a bit.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s step back and try to sneak up to a definition.</p>
<p>What is consciousness?</p>
<p>For me, there are two aspects to answering that question.</p>
<p>One is, what&rsquo;s the nature of consciousness?</p>
<p>How does something like consciousness exist in an otherwise apparently nonconscious universe?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a function question, which is equally important, which is, what does</p>
<p>consciousness do?</p>
<p>The first one is obviously, you know, problematic for most people, like, yeah, consciousness</p>
<p>seems to be so different from the rest of the nonconscious universe.</p>
<p>But I put it to you that the function question is also very hard, because you are clearly</p>
<p>capable of very sophisticated, intelligent behavior without consciousness.</p>
<p>You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole into ideas in your mind, and you</p>
<p>have no conscious awareness of how that process is occurring.</p>
<p>So why do we have consciousness at all?</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an extra question you need to ask.</p>
<p>Should we attempt to answer those questions separately, or should we attempt to answer</p>
<p>them in an integrated fashion?</p>
<p>I make the case that you actually have to answer them in an integrated fashion.</p>
<p>What consciousness does, and what it is, we should be able to give it a unified answer</p>
<p>to both of those.</p>
<p>Can you try to elucidate the difference between what consciousness is and what it does, both</p>
<p>of which are mysteries, as you say, state versus action?</p>
<p>Can you try to explain the difference that&rsquo;s interesting, that&rsquo;s useful, that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to understand?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s putting me in a bit of a difficult position, because I actually argue that trying</p>
<p>to answer them separately is ultimately incoherent.</p>
<p>But what I can point to are many published articles in which only one of these problems</p>
<p>is addressed, and the other is left unaddressed.</p>
<p>So people will try and explain what qualia are, how they potentially emerge, without</p>
<p>saying what do they do, what problems do they help to solve, how do they make the organism</p>
<p>more adaptive.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll have other people who will say, no, no, this is what the function of</p>
<p>consciousness is, but I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t tell you, I can&rsquo;t solve the hard problem,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how qualia exist.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is many people treat these problems separately, although I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ultimately an incoherent way to approach the problem.</p>
<p>So the hard problem is focusing on what it is.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the qualia, that it feels like something to experience a thing, that&rsquo;s what consciousness</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>And does is more about the functional usefulness of the thing, to the whole beautiful mix of</p>
<p>cognition and just function in everyday life.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ve also said that you can do very intelligent things without consciousness.</p>
<p>Yes, clearly.</p>
<p>Is that obvious to you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing to access my memory.</p>
<p>It just comes up, and it comes up really intelligently.</p>
<p>But the mechanisms that create consciousness could be deeply interlinked with whatever</p>
<p>is doing the memory access, that&rsquo;s doing the&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, I think so, in fact, yes, yes.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say in this will probably sneak up to this question a</p>
<p>few times, which is whether we can build machines that are conscious, or machines that are intelligent,</p>
<p>one level intelligent or beyond, without building the consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately, that&rsquo;s one of the ways to understand what consciousness is, is to</p>
<p>build the thing.</p>
<p>We can either sort of from the Chomsky way, try to construct models, like he thinks about</p>
<p>language in this way, try to construct models and theories of how the thing works, or we</p>
<p>can just build the damn thing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a methodological principle in cognitive science.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the things that sort of distinguishes cognitive science from other disciplines dealing</p>
<p>with the nature of cognition in the mind is that cognitive science takes the design stance.</p>
<p>It asks, well, could we build a machine that would not only simulate it, but serve as a</p>
<p>bona fide explanation of the phenomenon?</p>
<p>Do you find any efforts in cognitive science compelling in this direction?</p>
<p>In terms of how far we are, there&rsquo;s, on the computational side of things, something called</p>
<p>cognitive modeling, there&rsquo;s all these kinds of packages that you can construct simplified</p>
<p>models of how the brain does things and see if complex behaviors emerge.</p>
<p>Do you find any efforts in cognitive, or what efforts in cognitive science do you find most</p>
<p>inspiring and productive?</p>
<p>I think the project of trying to create AGI, artificial general intelligence, is where</p>
<p>I place my hope of artificial intelligence being of scientific significance.</p>
<p>This is independent of technological socioeconomic significance, which is already well established.</p>
<p>But being able to say because of the work in AI, we now have a good theory of cognition,</p>
<p>intelligence, perhaps consciousness, I think that&rsquo;s where I place my bets is in the current</p>
<p>endeavors around artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>And so tackling that problem head on, which has now become central, at least to a group</p>
<p>of cognitive scientists, is I think what needs to be done.</p>
<p>And when you think about AGI, do you think about systems that have consciousness?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to what I think is at the core of your general intelligence.</p>
<p>So right now, compared to even our best machines, you are a general problem solver.</p>
<p>You can solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains.</p>
<p>And some of our best machines have a little bit of transfer.</p>
<p>They can learn this game and play a few other well designed rule bound games, but they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn how to swim, etc., things like that.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s interesting is what seems to come up, and this is some of my published</p>
<p>work, in all these different domains of cognition across all these different problem types is</p>
<p>a central problem.</p>
<p>And since we do have good sort of psychometric evidence that we do have some general ability</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a significant component of our intelligence, I made an argument as to what I think that</p>
<p>general ability is.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>The amount of information in this room that you could actually pay attention to is combinatorial</p>
<p>explosive.</p>
<p>The amount of information you have in your memory, long term memory, and all the ways</p>
<p>you could combine it, combinatorial explosive.</p>
<p>The number of possibilities you can consider, also combinatorial explosive.</p>
<p>The sequences of behavior you can generate, also combinatorial explosive.</p>
<p>And yet somehow you&rsquo;re zeroing in.</p>
<p>The right memories are coming up, the right possibilities are opening up, the right sequences</p>
<p>of behavior, you&rsquo;re paying attention to the right thing.</p>
<p>Not infallibly so, but so much so that you reliably find obvious what you should interact</p>
<p>with in order to solve the problem at hand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an ability that is still not well understood within AGI.</p>
<p>To filtering out the gigantic waterfall of data.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a Zen Koan.</p>
<p>What makes you intelligent is your ability to ignore so much information and do it in</p>
<p>such a way that is somewhere between arbitrary guessing and algorithmic search.</p>
<p>And to a fault sometimes of course that you, based on the models you construct, you forget,</p>
<p>you ignore things that you should probably not ignore.</p>
<p>And that, hopefully we can circle back to it Lux, is related to the meaning issue.</p>
<p>Because the very processes that make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially susceptible</p>
<p>to self deceptive, self destructive behavior because of the way we misframe the environment</p>
<p>in fundamental ways.</p>
<p>So to you, meaning is also connected to ideas of wisdom and truth and how we interpret and</p>
<p>understand and interact intellectually with the environment.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what is wisdom?</p>
<p>Why do we long for it?</p>
<p>How do we and where do we find it?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>This is what you use to solve your problems, as I was just describing.</p>
<p>Rationality is how you use your intelligence to overcome the problems of self deception</p>
<p>that emerge when you&rsquo;re trying to solve your problems.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that meta problem.</p>
<p>And then the issue is, do you have just one kind of knowing?</p>
<p>I think you have multiple ways of knowing, and therefore you have multiple rationalities.</p>
<p>And so wisdom is to coordinate those rationalities so that they are optimally constraining and</p>
<p>affording each other.</p>
<p>So in that way, wisdom is rationally self transcending rationality.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So life is a kind of process where you jump from rationality to rationality and pick up</p>
<p>a village of rationalities along the way that then turns into wisdom.</p>
<p>Yes, if properly coordinated.</p>
<p>You mentioned framing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what is framing?</p>
<p>Is it a set of assumptions you bring to the table in how you see the world, how you reason</p>
<p>about the world, how you understand the world?</p>
<p>So it depends what you mean by assumptions.</p>
<p>If by assumption you mean a proposition, representational or rule, I think that&rsquo;s much more downstream</p>
<p>from relevance realization.</p>
<p>I think relevance realization refers to, again, constraints on how you are paying attention.</p>
<p>And so for me, talking about framing is talking about this process you&rsquo;re doing right now</p>
<p>of salient landscaping.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s salient to you?</p>
<p>And how is what&rsquo;s salient constantly shifting in a sort of a dynamic tapestry?</p>
<p>And how are you shaping yourself to the way that salient landscaping is aspectualizing</p>
<p>the world, shaping it into aspects for interaction?</p>
<p>For me, that is a much more primordial process than any sort of beliefs we have.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>If we mean by beliefs a representational proposition, then we&rsquo;re in this very problematic position.</p>
<p>Because then we&rsquo;re trying to say that propositions are ultimately responsible for how we do relevance</p>
<p>realization.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s problematic because representations presuppose relevance realization.</p>
<p>So I represent this as a cup.</p>
<p>The number of properties it actually has, and that I even have epistemic access to,</p>
<p>is combinatorial explosive.</p>
<p>I select from those a subset and how they are relevant to each other insofar as they</p>
<p>are relevant for me.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t have to be a cup.</p>
<p>I could be using it as a hat, I could use it to stand for the letter V, all kinds of</p>
<p>different things.</p>
<p>I could say this was the 10th billion object made in North America.</p>
<p>Representations presuppose relevance realization.</p>
<p>They are therefore dependent on it, which means relevance realization isn&rsquo;t bound to</p>
<p>our representational structures.</p>
<p>It can be influenced by them, but they are ultimately dependent on relevance realization.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s define stuff.</p>
<p>Relevance realization.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What are the inputs and the outputs of this thing?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about is how you are doing something very analogous to evolution.</p>
<p>So if you think about that adaptivity isn&rsquo;t in the organism or in the environment, but</p>
<p>in a dynamical relation and then what does evolution do?</p>
<p>It creates variation and then it puts selective pressure and what that does is that changes</p>
<p>the niche constructions that are available to a species.</p>
<p>It changes the morphology.</p>
<p>You also have a loop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your sensory motor loop and what&rsquo;s constantly happening is there are processes within you</p>
<p>that are opening up variation and also processes that are putting selection on it and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>constantly evolving that sensory motor loop.</p>
<p>So you might call your cognitive fittedness, which is how you&rsquo;re framing the world is constantly</p>
<p>evolving and changing.</p>
<p>I can give you two clear examples of that.</p>
<p>One, your autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic and sympathetic.</p>
<p>The sympathetic system is biased to trying to interpret as much of reality as threat</p>
<p>or opportunity.</p>
<p>The parasympathetic is biased to trying to interpret as much of the environment as safe</p>
<p>and relaxing and they are constantly doing opponent processing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no little man in you calculating your level of arousal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this dynamic coupling opponent processing between them that is constantly evolving your</p>
<p>arousal.</p>
<p>Similarly, your attention, you have the default mode network, task network.</p>
<p>The default mode network is putting pressure on you right now to mind wander, to go off,</p>
<p>to drift, right, and then the task focus network is selecting out of those possibilities the</p>
<p>ones that will survive and go into and so you are constantly evolving your attention.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a natural selection of ideas that a bunch of systems within you are generating</p>
<p>and then you use the natural selection.</p>
<p>What is the selector, the object that you&rsquo;re interacting with, the glass?</p>
<p>Relevance realization, once again, you just describe how it happens.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t describe what the hell it is.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the goal?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>So relevance realization is how you interact with things in the world to make sense of</p>
<p>why they matter, what they mean to you, to your life.</p>
<p>Yes, and notice the language you just used, you&rsquo;re starting to use the meaning in life</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>Good or bad?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So what does that evolution of your sensory motor loop do?</p>
<p>It gives you, and here I&rsquo;ll use a term from Marlon Ponti, it gives you an optimal grip</p>
<p>on the world.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use your visual attention again.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s an object.</p>
<p>How close should I be to it?</p>
<p>Is there a right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you want to do with it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So you have to evolve your sensory motor loop in order to get the optimal grip that actually</p>
<p>creates the affordance of you getting to a goal that you&rsquo;re trying to get to.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re describing physical goals of manipulating objects, so this applies,</p>
<p>the task, the process of relevance realization is not just about getting a glass of water</p>
<p>and taking a drink.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about falling in love.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>Between those two options.</p>
<p>I can show you how you&rsquo;re optimally gripping in an abstract cognitive domain.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So a mammal goes by and most people will say there&rsquo;s a dog.</p>
<p>Now why don&rsquo;t they say, they might, but typically, you know, probabilistically they&rsquo;ll say there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a dog.</p>
<p>They could say there&rsquo;s a German Shepherd, there&rsquo;s a mammal, there&rsquo;s a living organism,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a police dog.</p>
<p>Why that?</p>
<p>Why there?</p>
<p>Why did they stop Eleanor Rush called these basic level?</p>
<p>Well, what you find is that&rsquo;s an optimal grip because it&rsquo;s getting you the best overall</p>
<p>balance between similarity within your category and difference between the other categories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s allowing you to properly fit to that object in so far as you&rsquo;re setting yourself</p>
<p>up to, well, I&rsquo;m getting so as many of the similarities and differences I can on balance</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in a trade off relationship that I need in order to probably interact</p>
<p>with this mammal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s optimal grip, not right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the level of your categorization.</p>
<p>You evolve these models of the world around you and on top of them, you do stuff like</p>
<p>you build representations, like you said, yes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the salience landscape?</p>
<p>Salience meaning attention landscape.</p>
<p>Salience is what grabs your attention or what results from you directing your attention.</p>
<p>I clap my hands, that&rsquo;s salient, it grabs your attention.</p>
<p>Your attention is drawn to it, that&rsquo;s bottom up, but I can also say you left big toe and</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s salient to you because you directed your attention towards it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s top down and again, opponent processing going on there.</p>
<p>Whatever stands out to you, what grabs your attention, what arouses you, what triggers</p>
<p>at least momentarily some affect towards it, that&rsquo;s how things are salient.</p>
<p>What salience I would argue is, is how a lot of unconscious relevance realization makes</p>
<p>information relevant to working memory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it now becomes online for direct sensory motor interaction with the world.</p>
<p>So you think the salience landscape, the ocean of salience extends into the subconscious</p>
<p>mind?</p>
<p>I think relevance does, but I think when relevance is recursively processed, relevance realization</p>
<p>such that it passes through sort of this higher filter of working memory and has these properties</p>
<p>of being globally accessible and globally broadcast, then it becomes the thing we call</p>
<p>salience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s really good evidence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really good evidence from my colleague at UFT, University of Toronto, Lynn Hasher,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what working memory is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a higher order relevance filter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why things like chunking will get way more information through working memory because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically making, it&rsquo;s basically monitoring how much relevance realization has gone into</p>
<p>this information.</p>
<p>Usually you have to do an additional kind of recursive processing.</p>
<p>And that tells you, by the way, when do you need consciousness?</p>
<p>When do you need that working memory and that salience landscaping?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re facing situations that are highly novel, highly complex and very ill</p>
<p>defined that require you to engage working memory.</p>
<p>Okay, got it.</p>
<p>So relevance realization is in part the thing that constructs that basic level thing of</p>
<p>a dog.</p>
<p>When you see it, when you see a dog, you call it a dog, not a German Shepherd, not a mammal,</p>
<p>not a biological meat bag.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dog.</p>
<p>Wisdom.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what is wisdom?</p>
<p>If we return, I think as part of that, we got to relevance realization and then wisdom</p>
<p>is accumulation of rationalities.</p>
<p>You described the rationality as a kind of starting from intelligence, much of puzzle</p>
<p>solving and then rationalities like the meta problem of puzzle solving and then what wisdom</p>
<p>is the meta, meta problem of puzzle solving?</p>
<p>Yes, in the sense that the meta problem you have when you&rsquo;re solving your puzzles is that</p>
<p>you can often fall into self deception.</p>
<p>You can misprint.</p>
<p>Self deception, right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So knowledge overcomes ignorance, wisdom is about overcoming foolishness if what we mean</p>
<p>by foolishness is self deceptive, self destructive behavior, which I think is a good definition</p>
<p>of foolishness.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re doing this recursive relevance realization.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using your intelligence to improve the use of your intelligence and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using your rationality to improve the use of your rationality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that recursive relevance realization I was talking about a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>Think about a wise person.</p>
<p>They come into highly often messy, ill defined, complex situations usually where there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>significant novelty and what can they do?</p>
<p>They can zero in on what really matters, what&rsquo;s relevant and then they can shape themselves,</p>
<p>salience landscaping to intervene most appropriately to that situation as they have framed it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we mean by a wise person and that&rsquo;s how it follows out of the model I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>presenting to you.</p>
<p>So when we say self deception, I mean part of that implies that it&rsquo;s intentional.</p>
<p>Part of the mechanism of cognition, you&rsquo;re modifying what you should know for some purpose.</p>
<p>Is that how you see the word self deception?</p>
<p>No, because I belong to a group of people that think the model of self deception as</p>
<p>lying to oneself ultimately makes no sense.</p>
<p>Because in order to lie to you, I have to know something you don&rsquo;t and I have to depend</p>
<p>on your commitment to the truth in order to modify your behavior.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what we do to ourselves.</p>
<p>I think, and I&rsquo;m going to use it in the technical term and thank you for making space for that</p>
<p>earlier on, I think we can bullshit ourselves, which is a very different thing than lying.</p>
<p>So what is bullshit and how do we bullshit ourselves, technically speaking?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Frankfurt and this is inspired by Frankfurt and other people&rsquo;s work based on Frankfurt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>On bullshit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Classic essay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good title.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the best things he wrote.</p>
<p>He wrote a lot of good things.</p>
<p>The title or the essay?</p>
<p>The essay.</p>
<p>The title&rsquo;s good too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always an icebreaker in certain academic settings.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s contrast the bullshit artist from the liar.</p>
<p>The liar depends on your commitment to the truth.</p>
<p>The bullshit artist is actually trying to make you indifferent to the question of truth</p>
<p>and modify your behavior by making things salient to you so that they are catchy to</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>So a prototypical example of bullshit is a commercial, a television commercial.</p>
<p>You watch these people at a bar getting some particular kind of alcohol and they&rsquo;re gorgeous</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re laughing and they&rsquo;re smiling and they&rsquo;re clear eyed.</p>
<p>You know that&rsquo;s not true and they know you know it&rsquo;s not true, but here&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care because there&rsquo;s gorgeous people smiling and they&rsquo;re happy and that&rsquo;s salient</p>
<p>to you and that catches your attention.</p>
<p>And so you know, go into a bar, you know that won&rsquo;t happen when you drink this alcohol,</p>
<p>you know it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you buy the product because it was made salient to you.</p>
<p>Now you can&rsquo;t lie to yourself, Lex.</p>
<p>Salience can catch attention, but attention can drive salience.</p>
<p>So this is what I can do.</p>
<p>I can make something salient by paying attention to it and then that will tend to draw me back</p>
<p>to it again, which, and you see what happens, which means it tends to catch my attention</p>
<p>more so that when I go into the store, that bottle of liquor catches my attention and</p>
<p>I buy it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, why is that bullshit?</p>
<p>Because what you&rsquo;re doing is being caught up in the salience of things independent from</p>
<p>whether or not that salience is tracking reality.</p>
<p>Is it independent or is it loosely connected?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not so obvious to me when I see happy people at a bar that I don&rsquo;t in part</p>
<p>believe that, well, my experience has been maybe different.</p>
<p>Logically, I can understand, but maybe there is a bar out there where it&rsquo;s all happy people</p>
<p>dancing.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the bars I go to these days in Texas, there&rsquo;s pretty lots of happy people.</p>
<p>I think you can, I mean, there&rsquo;s probably variation, although I think it&rsquo;s very the</p>
<p>truth seeking in there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the intent is at least to try and shut off your truth seeking.</p>
<p>It might not completely succeed, but that&rsquo;s the intent.</p>
<p>At times it can completely succeed because I can give you pretty much gibberish and never</p>
<p>let it will motivate your behavior.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an episode from the classic Simpsons, not the modern Simpsons, the classic Simpsons</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s aliens and they&rsquo;re running for office in the United States.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a Canadian, so this doesn&rsquo;t quite work for me, but right.</p>
<p>And this speech goes like this, my fellow Americans, when I was young, I dreamt of being</p>
<p>a baseball, but we must move forward, not backward.</p>
<p>Upward, not forward, twirling, twirling towards freedom and people go, and there&rsquo;s a rush.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s great satire because a lot of political speech is exactly like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not saying all political speech, I said a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental difference between, and it&rsquo;s so hilarious, I remember that episode.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental difference between that absurd sort of non secular speech and political</p>
<p>speech because one of the things is political speech is grounded in some sense of truth.</p>
<p>And so if that requires you talking about alternative facts and weird self destructive</p>
<p>oxymoronic phrases, isn&rsquo;t that approaching pure bullshit?</p>
<p>No, I think pure bullshit, like the vacuum is very difficult to get to, but I get the</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>So what exactly is truth?</p>
<p>Is it possible to know?</p>
<p>I think Spinoza&rsquo;s right about truth, that truth is only known by its own standard, which</p>
<p>sounds circular.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a way in which he didn&rsquo;t mean that circularly, and I think this is also converges</p>
<p>with Plato.</p>
<p>These are two huge influences on me.</p>
<p>I think we only know the truth retrospectively when we go through some process of self transcendence,</p>
<p>when we move from a frame to a more encompassing frame so that we can see the limitations and</p>
<p>the distortions of the earlier frame.</p>
<p>You have this when you have a moment of insight.</p>
<p>Insight is you doing, you are re realizing what is relevant.</p>
<p>You go, oh, oh, I thought she was aggressive and angry.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s actually really afraid.</p>
<p>I was misframing this and you change what you find relevant.</p>
<p>You have those aha moments.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s possible to get a sense of objective reality?</p>
<p>So is it possible to get to the ground level of something that you can call objective truth?</p>
<p>Or are we always on shaky ground?</p>
<p>I think those moments of transcendence can never get us to an absolute view from nowhere.</p>
<p>And so this is Drew Hyland&rsquo;s notion of finite transcendence.</p>
<p>We are capable of self transcendence, and therefore we are creatures who can actually</p>
<p>raise the question of truth, or goodness, or beauty, because I think they all share</p>
<p>this feature.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can transcend to a godhood, to some absolute view from nowhere</p>
<p>that takes in all information and organizes it in a comprehensive whole.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that truth is thereby rendered valueless.</p>
<p>I think a better term is real.</p>
<p>And real and illusory are comparative terms.</p>
<p>You only know that something&rsquo;s an illusion by taking something else to be real.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re always in a comparative task, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can somehow</p>
<p>jump outside of our framing in some final manner and say, this is how it is from a God&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eye point of view.</p>
<p>So what do you think, if I may ask, of somebody like Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism?</p>
<p>So where the core principle is that reality exists independently of consciousness and</p>
<p>that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception.</p>
<p>So they have that, you do have that ability to know reality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>Knowing that there&rsquo;s an independent reality is not knowing that independent reality.</p>
<p>Those are not the same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think objectivism would probably say that our human reason is able to have</p>
<p>contact with that.</p>
<p>Then I would respond and say, I believe, in fact, ultimately, in a conformity theory of</p>
<p>knowing that the deepest kind of knowing is when there&rsquo;s a contact, a conformity between</p>
<p>the mind, the embodied mind and reality, and here&rsquo;s where I guess I&rsquo;d push back on Rand.</p>
<p>I would say you have to acknowledge partial knowledge as real knowledge, because if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re going to fall prey to Meno&rsquo;s paradox.</p>
<p>Meno&rsquo;s paradox is, you know, it&rsquo;s in Plato, right?</p>
<p>To know P. Well, if I don&rsquo;t know P, I&rsquo;m going to go looking for it.</p>
<p>But if I don&rsquo;t know P, how could I possibly recognize it when I found it?</p>
<p>I have no way of recognizing it.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing that I found it.</p>
<p>So I must know P. But if I know P, then I don&rsquo;t need to learn about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to go searching.</p>
<p>So learning doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Knowledge is impossible.</p>
<p>The way you break out of that paradox is saying, no, no, no, it is possible to partially know</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>I can know it enough that it will guide me to recognizing it, but that&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>as having a complete grasp of it, because I still have to search and find what I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>yet possess in my knowledge.</p>
<p>So partial knowledge has to be real knowledge.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Partial knowledge is still knowledge.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What do you think about somebody like Donald Hoffman, who thinks the reality is an illusion,</p>
<p>so complete illusion, that we&rsquo;re given this actually really nice definition or idea that</p>
<p>you talked about, that there&rsquo;s a tension between the illusory and what is real.</p>
<p>He says that basically we&rsquo;ve taken that and we&rsquo;ve ran with the real to the point where</p>
<p>the real is not at all connected to some kind of physical reality.</p>
<p>I hope to talk to him at some point.</p>
<p>You were supposed to talk at one point, and so I have to talk in his absence.</p>
<p>I think that, first of all, I think saying that everything is an illusion is like saying</p>
<p>everything is tall.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a comparative term.</p>
<p>You have to say, against this standard of realness, this is an illusion.</p>
<p>And he uses arguments from evolution, which are problematic to me because it&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>you seem to be saying that evolution is true, that it really exists, and then some of our</p>
<p>cognition and our perception has access to reality, math and presumably some science</p>
<p>has access to reality.</p>
<p>And then what he seems to be saying is, well, a lot of your everyday experience is illusory,</p>
<p>but we do have some contact with reality, whereby we can make the arguments as to why</p>
<p>most of your experience, most of your everyday experience is an illusion.</p>
<p>But to me, that&rsquo;s not a novel thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Descartes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea that most of our sense experience is untrustworthy, but the math is what connects</p>
<p>us to reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how he interpreted the Copernican revolution.</p>
<p>Oh, look, we&rsquo;re all seeing the sun rise and move over and set, and it&rsquo;s all an illusion,</p>
<p>but the math, the math gets us to the reality.</p>
<p>Well, I think he makes a deeper point that most of cognition is just evolved and operates</p>
<p>in the illusory world.</p>
<p>How does he know that things like cognition and evolution exist?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an important distinction between evolution and cognition, right?</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m just saying that&rsquo;s not the point I&rsquo;m making.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making a point that he&rsquo;s claiming that there are two things that really exist.</p>
<p>Why are they privileged?</p>
<p>He basically says that, look, the process of evolution makes sense, right?</p>
<p>Like it makes sense that you get complex organisms from simple organisms through the natural</p>
<p>selection process.</p>
<p>Whereas how you get to transfer information from generation to generation, it makes sense.</p>
<p>And then he says that there&rsquo;s no requirement for the cognition to evolve in a way that</p>
<p>it would actually perceive and have direct contact with the physical reality.</p>
<p>Except that cognition evolved in such a way that it could perceive the truth of evolution.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t treat evolution like an isolated thing.</p>
<p>Evolution depends on Darwinian theory, genetics.</p>
<p>It depends on understanding plate tectonics, the way the environment changes.</p>
<p>It depends on how chromosomes are structured.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s an interesting question to him, where I don&rsquo;t know if he actually would</p>
<p>push back on this, is how do you know evolution is real?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think he would be open to the idea that it is part of the illusion that we constructed,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some, in some sense, it is connected to reality, but we don&rsquo;t have a clear picture</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an intellectually honest statement then, if most of our cognition as thinking</p>
<p>beings is operating at every level in an illusory world, then it makes sense that this, one</p>
<p>of the main theories of science, that&rsquo;s evolution, is also a complete part of this illusory world.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But then what happens to the premise for his argument leading to the conclusion that cognition</p>
<p>is illusory?</p>
<p>I think he makes a very specific argument about evolution as an explanation of why the</p>
<p>world is, of our cognition operating in an illusory world.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just one of the explanations.</p>
<p>I think the deeper question is why do we think we have contact with reality, with physical</p>
<p>reality?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we could be very well living in a virtual world constructed by our minds in a way that</p>
<p>makes that world deeply interesting in some ways, whether it&rsquo;s somebody playing a video</p>
<p>game or we&rsquo;re trying to, through the process of distributed cognition, construct more and</p>
<p>more complex objects.</p>
<p>Like why do we have to, why does it have to be connected to like physics and planets and</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re going to say like we&rsquo;re now considering it as a possibility rather than it&rsquo;s a conclusion</p>
<p>based on arguments, because the arguments, again, will always rely on stipulating that</p>
<p>there is something that is known.</p>
<p>These are the features of cognition.</p>
<p>Cognition is capable of illusion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a true statement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somehow in contact with the mind.</p>
<p>Why does the mind have this privileged contact and other aspects like my body do not?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, but let&rsquo;s put that aside and now let&rsquo;s just consider it.</p>
<p>Now when we put it that way, it&rsquo;s not an epistemic question anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an existential question and here&rsquo;s my reply to you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two possibilities.</p>
<p>Either the illusion is one that I cannot discover, sort of, you know, the matrix on steroids</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>Because what I do, I can&rsquo;t find out that it&rsquo;s an illusion or it&rsquo;s an illusion, but I can</p>
<p>find out that it&rsquo;s an illusion.</p>
<p>Those are the two possibilities.</p>
<p>Nothing changes for me if those are the two possibilities, because if I could not find,</p>
<p>possibly find out, it is irrational for me to pay any attention to that possibility.</p>
<p>So I could keep doing the science as I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a way of finding out, science is my best bet, I believe, for finding out if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s true and what&rsquo;s an illusion.</p>
<p>So I keep doing what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an argument if you move it to that, that makes no existential difference to me.</p>
<p>Oh man, that is such a deeply philosophical argument.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s saying science doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question, just like before humans were able to fly, they would ask a</p>
<p>question, can we build the machine that makes us fly?</p>
<p>In that same way, we&rsquo;re asking a question to which we don&rsquo;t know an answer, but we may</p>
<p>know in the future, how much of this whole thing is an illusion?</p>
<p>And I think in a second category, the first, I forgot which one, yes, science will be able</p>
<p>to help us discover this.</p>
<p>Otherwise, yes, for sure, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re living in a simulation, we can&rsquo;t find out at all, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But yes, the whole point is as we get deeper and deeper understanding of our mind of cognition,</p>
<p>we might be able to discover like how much of this is a big charade constructed by our</p>
<p>mind to keep us fed or something like that.</p>
<p>Some weird, some weird, very simplistic explanation that it will ultimately in its simplicity</p>
<p>be beautiful, or as we try to build robots and instill them, instill them with consciousness,</p>
<p>with ability to feel, those kinds of things, we&rsquo;ll discover, well, let&rsquo;s just trick them</p>
<p>into thinking they feel and have consciousness and they&rsquo;ll believe it.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll have a deeply fulfilling and meaningful lives.</p>
<p>And on top of that, they will interact with us in a way that will make our lives more</p>
<p>meaningful.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s like at the end of Animal Farm, you look at pigs and humans</p>
<p>and you look at robots and humans and you can&rsquo;t tell the difference between either.</p>
<p>And we in that way start to understand that much of this existence could be an illusion.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I have two responses to that.</p>
<p>First is the progress that&rsquo;s being made on like AGI is about making whatever the system</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s going to be the source of intelligent more and more dynamically and recursively</p>
<p>self correcting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Extrapolating from that, you get a system that gets better and better at self correcting,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s exactly what I was describing before as the transformative theory of truth.</p>
<p>The other response to that is people think of science just as sort of end proposition.</p>
<p>Let me just use the evolutionary example again, right?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m gathering the evidence, I need to know a lot of geology, I need to know plate tectonics,</p>
<p>I need to know about radioactive decay, I need to know about genetics, and then in order</p>
<p>to measure all those things, I need to know how microscopes work, I need to know how pencils</p>
<p>and paper work, I need to know how rulers work, I need to know how English&hellip; You can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>isolate knowledge that way.</p>
<p>And if you say, well, most of that&rsquo;s an illusion, then you&rsquo;re in a weird position of saying</p>
<p>somehow all of these illusions get to this truth claim.</p>
<p>I think it goes in reverse.</p>
<p>If you think this is the truth claim, the measuring and all the things that scientists</p>
<p>would do to gather on all the ways the theories are converging together, that also has to</p>
<p>be fundamentally right, because it&rsquo;s not like Lego, it is an interwoven whole.</p>
<p>Yes, it definitely is interwoven, but I love how I&rsquo;m playing the devil advocate for the</p>
<p>illusion world.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an aspect to truth that has to be consistent, deeply consistent across an</p>
<p>entire system.</p>
<p>But inside a video game, that same kind of consistency evolves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s rules about interactions, there&rsquo;s game theoretic patterns about what&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>and bad and so on, and there&rsquo;s sources of joy and fear and anger, and then understanding</p>
<p>about a world, what happens in different dynamics of a video game, even simple video games.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no, even inside an illusion, you can have consistency and develop truths inside</p>
<p>that illusion and iteratively evolve your truth with the illusion.</p>
<p>Okay, but that comes back.</p>
<p>Is that process genuinely self correcting, or are you in the simulation in which there</p>
<p>is no possible doorway out?</p>
<p>Because if, my argument is, if you find one or two doorways, that feeds back.</p>
<p>In fact, you can&rsquo;t just say, this is the little tiny island where we have the truth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m making.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But what if you find that, I think there is doorways, if that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And what if you find a doorway and you step out, but you&rsquo;re yet in another simulation?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so self correcting.</p>
<p>When you fix the self deception, you don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s other bigger self deceptions</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re operating on.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But again, we&rsquo;re back to when I step into the second simulation, is it, can I get the</p>
<p>doorway out of that or right?</p>
<p>Because if you just make the infinite regressive simulations, you basically said, I have a</p>
<p>simulation that I can never get out of.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s always a bigger pile of bullshit is the claim I&rsquo;m trying to make here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me dance around meaning once more.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I ask people on this podcast or at a bar or to imaginary people I talk to in a room when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all by myself, the question of the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Do you think this is a useful question?</p>
<p>You drew a line between meaning in life and meaning of life.</p>
<p>Do you think this is a useful question?</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s like the question, what&rsquo;s north of the North Pole or what time is it</p>
<p>on the sun?</p>
<p>It sounds like a question, but it&rsquo;s actually not really a question because it has a presupposition</p>
<p>in it that I think is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>If I understand what people mean by it, and it&rsquo;s actually often not that clear, but when</p>
<p>they talk about the meaning of life, they are talking about there are some feature of</p>
<p>the universe in and of itself that I have to discover and enter into a relationship</p>
<p>with and there&rsquo;s in that sense, a plan for me or something.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a property of the universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very deep, serious, metaphysical, ontological claim.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re claiming to know something fundamental about the structure of reality.</p>
<p>There were times when people thought they had a worldview that legitimated it, like</p>
<p>God is running the universe and God cares about you and there&rsquo;s a plan, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I think a better way of understanding meaning is not&hellip;</p>
<p>Meaning is like the graspability.</p>
<p>Remember, I talked about optimal grip, it&rsquo;s like the graspability of that cup.</p>
<p>Is that in me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is it in the cup?</p>
<p>No, because a fly can&rsquo;t grasp it.</p>
<p>Well, graspability is in my hand, well, I can&rsquo;t grasp Africa.</p>
<p>No, no, there is a real relation, fittedness between me and this cup.</p>
<p>Same thing with the adaptivity of an organism.</p>
<p>Is the adaptivity of a great white shark in the great white shark?</p>
<p>Drop it in the Sahara, dies, okay?</p>
<p>Meaning isn&rsquo;t in me, I think that&rsquo;s romantic bullshit, and it isn&rsquo;t in the universe, it</p>
<p>is a proper relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve coined the phrase transjective, it is the binding relationship between the subjective</p>
<p>and the objective.</p>
<p>And therefore, when you&rsquo;re asking the question about the meaning of life, you are, I think,</p>
<p>misrepresenting the nature of meaning.</p>
<p>Just like when you ask, what time is it on the sun?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re misrepresenting how we derive clock time.</p>
<p>At the risk of disagreeing with a man who did 50 lectures on the meaning crisis, let</p>
<p>me hard disagree.</p>
<p>But I think we probably agree, but it&rsquo;s just like a dance, like any dialogue.</p>
<p>I think meaning of life gets at the same kind of relationship between you and the glass</p>
<p>of water, between whatever the forces of the universe that created the planets, the proteins,</p>
<p>the multi cell organisms, the intelligent early humans, the beautiful human civilizations</p>
<p>and the technologies that will overtake them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to understand the relevance realization of the Big Bang to the feeling of love you</p>
<p>have for another human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reaching for that, even though it&rsquo;s hopeless to understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the question, the asking of the question is the reaching.</p>
<p>Now it is, in fact, romantic bullshit, technically speaking.</p>
<p>But it could be that romantic bullshit is actually the essence of life and the source</p>
<p>of its deepest meaning.</p>
<p>Well, I hope not.</p>
<p>But technically speaking, romantic bullshit, meaning romantic in the philosophical sense,</p>
<p>yes.</p>
<p>I mean, what is poetry?</p>
<p>What is music?</p>
<p>What is the magic you feel when you hear a beautiful piece of music?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Oh, but that&rsquo;s exactly to my point.</p>
<p>Is music inside you or is it outside you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both and neither.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely why you find it so meaningful.</p>
<p>In fact, it can be so meaningful you can regard it as sacred.</p>
<p>What you said, I don&rsquo;t think, and you preface that we might not be in disagreement, right?</p>
<p>What you said is, no, no, no, there is a way in which reality is realizing itself.</p>
<p>And I want my relevance realization to be in the best possible relationship, the sort</p>
<p>of meta optimal grip to what is most real.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>I totally think that&rsquo;s one of the things, I said this earlier, one of our meta desires</p>
<p>is whatever is satisfying our desires is also real.</p>
<p>I do this with my students, I&rsquo;ll say, you know, because romantic relationships sort</p>
<p>of take the role of God and religion and history and culture for us right now.</p>
<p>We put everything on them and that&rsquo;s why they break, right?</p>
<p>Strong words.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll say to them, okay, how many of you are in really satisfying romantic relationships?</p>
<p>Put up your hands.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll say, okay, I&rsquo;m now only talking to these people.</p>
<p>Of those people, how many of you would want to know your partner&rsquo;s cheating on you even</p>
<p>if it means the destruction of the relationship, 95% of them put up their hands.</p>
<p>And I say, but why?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s my students who are usually all sort of bitten with cynicism and postmodernism</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll just say spontaneously, well, because it&rsquo;s not real, because it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I think what you&rsquo;re pointing to is actually, you&rsquo;re pointing not to an objective or a</p>
<p>subjective thing.</p>
<p>Empiricism says it&rsquo;s subjective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some sort of, I guess, like positivism or Lockean empiricism says it&rsquo;s objective,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying, no, no, no, there&rsquo;s reality realization and can I get relevance realization</p>
<p>to be optimally gripping in the best right relationship with it?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s good reason you can because think about it, your relevance realization isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just representing properties of the world, it&rsquo;s instantiating it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something very similar to biological evolution, which is that the guts of life,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m right, running your cognition, it&rsquo;s not just that you have ideas, you actually</p>
<p>instantiate, that&rsquo;s what I mean by conformity, the same principles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re within and without, they don&rsquo;t belong to you subjectively.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just out there, they&rsquo;re both at the same time.</p>
<p>And they help to explain how you are actually bound to the evolutionary world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it comes from both inside and from the outside.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still the question of the meaning of life, first of all, the big benefit of</p>
<p>that question is that it shakes you out of your hamster in a wheel that is daily life,</p>
<p>the mundane process of daily life, where you have a schedule, you wake up, you have kids,</p>
<p>you have to take them to school, then you go to work and the da da da da da and repeats</p>
<p>over and over and over and over and then you get increased salary and then you upgrade</p>
<p>to home and that whole process.</p>
<p>Asking about the meaning of life is so full of romantic bullshit that if you just allow</p>
<p>yourself to take it seriously for a second, it forces you to pause and think, what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on here?</p>
<p>And then it ultimately, I think, does return to the question of meaning in those mundane</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>What gives my life joy?</p>
<p>What gives it lasting deliciousness?</p>
<p>Where do I notice the magic and how can I have that magic return again and again?</p>
<p>Beauty.</p>
<p>And that ultimately what it returns to.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the same thing you do when you look up to the sky.</p>
<p>You spend most of your day hurrying around looking at things on the surface, but when</p>
<p>you look up to the sky and you see the stars, it fills you with the feeling of awe that</p>
<p>forces you to pause and think in full context of like, what the hell is going on here?</p>
<p>That, but also I think there is a, when you think too much about the meaning of a glass</p>
<p>and relevance realization of a glass, you don&rsquo;t necessarily get at the core of what</p>
<p>makes music beautiful.</p>
<p>So sometimes you have to start at the biggest picture first.</p>
<p>And I think meaning of life forces you to really go to the big bang and go to the universe</p>
<p>and the whole thing, the origin of life.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes you have to start there to discover the meaning in the day to day,</p>
<p>I think, but perhaps you would disagree.</p>
<p>In so far as the question makes you ask about the whole of your life and how much meaning</p>
<p>is in the whole of your life.</p>
<p>And in so far as it asks how much that is connected to reality, it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a bad question in that it also makes you look for the answers in the wrong way.</p>
<p>Now you said, and I agree with what you said, how we really answer this question is we come</p>
<p>back to the meaning in life and we see how much that meaning in life is connected to</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>We pursue wisdom.</p>
<p>And so for me, I don&rsquo;t need that question in order to provoke me into that stance.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s return to the meaning crisis.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What is the nature of the meaning crisis in modern times?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s its origin?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s its explanation?</p>
<p>Well, remember what I said, what I argued, that the very processes that make us adaptively</p>
<p>intelligent subject us to perennial problems of self deception, self destruction, creating</p>
<p>bullshit for ourselves, for other people, all of that.</p>
<p>And that can cause anxiety, existential anxiety, it can cause despair, it can cause a sense</p>
<p>of absurdity.</p>
<p>These are perennial problems.</p>
<p>And across cultures and across historical periods, human beings have come up with ecologies</p>
<p>of practices, there&rsquo;s no one practice, there&rsquo;s no panacea practice, they&rsquo;ve come up with</p>
<p>ecologies of practices for ameliorating that self deception and enhancing that fittedness,</p>
<p>that connectedness that&rsquo;s at the core of meaning in life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s prototypically what we call wisdom.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how I can show you one clear instance of the meaning crisis, is it&rsquo;s a wisdom famine.</p>
<p>I do this regularly with my students.</p>
<p>In the classroom I&rsquo;ll say, where do you go for information?</p>
<p>They hold up their phone.</p>
<p>Where do you go for knowledge?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a little bit slower and probably because they&rsquo;re in my class, they&rsquo;ll say, well, science,</p>
<p>the university.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, where do you go for wisdom?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a silence.</p>
<p>Wisdom isn&rsquo;t optional, that&rsquo;s why it is perennial, cross cultural, cross historical, because</p>
<p>of the perennial problems.</p>
<p>But we do not have homes for ecologies of practices that fit into our scientific technological</p>
<p>worldview so that they are considered legitimate.</p>
<p>The fastest growing demographic group are the nones, N O N E S.</p>
<p>They have no religious allegiance, but they are not primarily atheistic.</p>
<p>They most frequently describe themselves with this very, this has become almost everybody</p>
<p>now describes, I&rsquo;m spiritual but not religious, which means they are trying to find a way</p>
<p>of reducing the bullshit and enhancing the connectedness, but they don&rsquo;t want to turn</p>
<p>to any of the legacy established religions by and large.</p>
<p>Well isn&rsquo;t both religion and the nones, isn&rsquo;t wisdom a process, not a destination?</p>
<p>So trying to find, if you&rsquo;re a deeply faithful religious person, you&rsquo;re also trying to find,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So just because you have a place where you&rsquo;re looking or a set of traditions around which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constructing the search, it&rsquo;s nevertheless a search.</p>
<p>So I guess, is there a case to be made that this is just the usual human condition?</p>
<p>How do you answer?</p>
<p>If you asked five centuries ago, where do you look for wisdom?</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose people would be more inclined to answer, well, the Bible or a religious</p>
<p>text.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And they had a worldview that was considered not just religious, but also rational.</p>
<p>So we now have these two things, orthogonal or often oppositional, spirituality and rationality.</p>
<p>But if you go before a particular historical period, you look back in the Neoplatonic tradition,</p>
<p>like before the scientific revolution, those two are not in opposition.</p>
<p>They are deeply interwoven so that you can have a sense of legitimacy and deep realness</p>
<p>and grounding in your practices.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that anymore.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not advocating for religion, neither am I an enemy of religion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll strengthen your case, by the way.</p>
<p>So one of my RAs did research, and you get people who have committed themselves to cultivating</p>
<p>wisdom.</p>
<p>And you can look at people within religious traditions and people who are doing it in</p>
<p>a purely secular framework.</p>
<p>By many of the measures we use to study wisdom scientifically, the people in the religious</p>
<p>paths do better than the secular.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the important point, there&rsquo;s no significant difference between the religious</p>
<p>paths.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like if you&rsquo;re following the path of Judaism, you&rsquo;re more likely to end up wiser</p>
<p>than if you follow Buddhism.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s my case.</p>
<p>I was making the case that you don&rsquo;t need to have a religious affiliation to search</p>
<p>for wisdom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that I thought along to the point you just made, that it doesn&rsquo;t matter which religious</p>
<p>affiliation or none.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is the tricky thing we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>It does matter if you&rsquo;re in one, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter sort of the propositional creeds of</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something else at work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll allow me this, there&rsquo;s a functionality to religion that we lost when we rejected</p>
<p>all the propositional dogma.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a functionality there that we don&rsquo;t know how to recreate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Can you try to speak to that?</p>
<p>What is that functionality?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Why is that so useful?</p>
<p>A bunch of stories, a bunch of myths, a bunch of narratives that are drenched in deep lessons</p>
<p>about morality and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the functional thing there that can&rsquo;t be replaced without a religious text by a</p>
<p>nonreligious text?</p>
<p>This is, for me, the golden question.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Do you have an answer?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think I have a significant answer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s complete, but I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And this is to step before the Cartesian revolution and think about many different kinds of knowing.</p>
<p>And this is now something that is prominent within what&rsquo;s called 4E cognitive science,</p>
<p>the kind of cognitive science I practice.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of converging evidence for these different ways of knowing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s propositional knowing.</p>
<p>This is what we are most familiar with.</p>
<p>In fact, it almost has a tyrannical status, right?</p>
<p>This is knowing that something is the case, like that cats are mammals and it&rsquo;s stored</p>
<p>in semantic memory, and we have tests of coherence and correspondence and conviction, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s procedural knowing.</p>
<p>This is knowing how to do something.</p>
<p>Skills are not theories.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not beliefs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not true or false.</p>
<p>They engage the world or they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they are stored in a different kind of memory, procedural memory.</p>
<p>Semantic memory can be damaged without any damage to procedural memory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have the prototypical story of somebody suffering Alzheimer&rsquo;s and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>losing all kinds of facts, but they can still sit down and play the piano flawlessly.</p>
<p>Same kind of argument.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s perspectival knowing.</p>
<p>This is knowing what it&rsquo;s like to be you here now in this situation, in this state of mind,</p>
<p>the whole field of your salience landscaping, what it&rsquo;s like to be you here now.</p>
<p>And you have a specific kind of memory around that, episodic memory, and you have a different</p>
<p>criterion of realness.</p>
<p>So you can get this by my friend Dan Schiappi and I, we studied the scientists using moving</p>
<p>the rovers around, or you can take a look at people who are doing VR.</p>
<p>People talk about they want to really be in the game, and that makes it real.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t mean verisimilitude.</p>
<p>You can get that sense of being in the game with something like Tetris, which doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look like the real world, and you can fail to have it in a video game that has a lot</p>
<p>of verisimilitude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about, again, this kind of connectedness that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>If I may interrupt, is that connected to the hard problem of consciousness, the subject,</p>
<p>the qualia, or is that a different, that kind of knowing, is that different from the quality</p>
<p>of consciousness?</p>
<p>I think it has to do with, well, I make a distinction between the adjectival and the</p>
<p>adverbial qualia, so I think it has to do with the adverbial qualia much more than with</p>
<p>the adjectival.</p>
<p>So the adjectival qualia are like the greenness of green and the blueness of blue.</p>
<p>The adverbial qualia are the hereness, the nowness, the togetherness.</p>
<p>And I think the perspectival knowing has a lot to do with the adverbial qualia.</p>
<p>Adjectival qualia and adverbial qualia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning so many new things today.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s another way of knowing.</p>
<p>Right, the perspectival, and then there&rsquo;s a deeper one.</p>
<p>And this is a philosophical point, and I don&rsquo;t want to, we can go through the argument, but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to know that you know in order to know, because if you start doing that,</p>
<p>you get an infinite regress.</p>
<p>There has to be kinds of knowing that doesn&rsquo;t mean you know that you know that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Well, there was a lot of ink spilled over that over a 40 year period, so.</p>
<p>My philosophers, they spill, this is what they do, they spill ink to get paid for ink</p>
<p>spillage.</p>
<p>So I want to talk about what I call participatory knowing.</p>
<p>This is the idea that you and the world are co participating in things and such that real</p>
<p>affordances exist between you.</p>
<p>So both me and this environment are shaped by gravity, so the affordance of walking becomes</p>
<p>available to me.</p>
<p>Both me and a lot of this environment are shaped by my biology, and so affordances for</p>
<p>that are here.</p>
<p>Look at this cup, shared physics, shared sort of biological factors, my hand, I&rsquo;m bipedal,</p>
<p>also culture is shaping me and shaping this.</p>
<p>I had to learn how to use that and treat it as a cup.</p>
<p>So this is an agent arena relationship, right?</p>
<p>Use identities being created in your agency, identities being created in the world as an</p>
<p>arena so you and the world fit together.</p>
<p>You know when that&rsquo;s missing, when you&rsquo;re really lonely, or you&rsquo;re homesick, or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>suffering culture shock.</p>
<p>So this is participatory knowing, and it&rsquo;s the sense of, it comes with a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>At every level.</p>
<p>So the ability to walk is a kind of knowing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a dance between the physics that enables this process and just participating</p>
<p>in the process is the act of knowing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really weird form of memory you have for this kind of knowing, it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Can you elaborate?</p>
<p>Well, you do, so we talked about how all the different other kinds of knowing had specific</p>
<p>kinds of memory, semantic memory for propositional, procedural, episodic for perspectival.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the kind of memory that is the coordinated storehouse of all of your agent arena relationships?</p>
<p>All the roles you can take, all the identities you can assume, all the identities you can</p>
<p>assign.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the self?</p>
<p>Do you mean like consciousness?</p>
<p>No, I mean your sense of self.</p>
<p>Sense of self in this world that&rsquo;s not consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an agency or something.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s an agent arena relationship.</p>
<p>And so in an agent arena relationship, it&rsquo;s the sense of the agent.</p>
<p>And that the agent belongs in that arena.</p>
<p>Whatever the agent is, whatever the arena is, because it&rsquo;s probably a bunch of different</p>
<p>framings of how you experience that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you do.</p>
<p>In your identity as a self, you have all kinds of roles that are somehow contributing to</p>
<p>that identity, but are not equivalent to that identity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wonder if like my two hands have different, because there&rsquo;s a different experience of</p>
<p>me picking up something with my right hand and then my left hand.</p>
<p>Are those like&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really cool question, Lex.</p>
<p>They certainly feel like their own things, but that could be just anthropomorphization</p>
<p>based on cultural narratives and so on.</p>
<p>It could, but I think it&rsquo;s a legitimate empirical question because it also could be sort of</p>
<p>Ian McGilchrist stuff.</p>
<p>It could be you&rsquo;re using different hemispheres and they sort of have different agent arena</p>
<p>relationships to the environment.</p>
<p>This is a really important question in the cognitive science of the self.</p>
<p>Does that hemispheric difference mean you&rsquo;re multiple or you actually have a singular self?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to understand how many cells are there.</p>
<p>Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just like a quirk of evolution.</p>
<p>Surely it can be fundamental to cognition, having multiple cells or a singular self.</p>
<p>It depends, again, because we&rsquo;re getting far from the answer to the question you originally</p>
<p>asked me.</p>
<p>Do you want me to go back to that first or answer this one?</p>
<p>Which question?</p>
<p>I already forgot everything.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the functionality of religion?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let us return.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then we can return to the self.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you said you have all these propositions and et cetera, et cetera, and they differ</p>
<p>from the religions and they don&rsquo;t seem to be considered legitimate by many people.</p>
<p>But yet there&rsquo;s something functioning in the religions that is transforming people and</p>
<p>making them wiser.</p>
<p>And I put it to you that the transformations are largely occurring at those nonpropositional</p>
<p>levels.</p>
<p>The procedural, the perspectival, and the participatory.</p>
<p>And those are the ones, by the way, that are more fundamentally connected to meaning making</p>
<p>because remember the propositions are representational and they&rsquo;re dependent on the nonpropositional,</p>
<p>nonrepresentational processes of connectedness and relevance realization.</p>
<p>So religion goes down deep to the nonpropositional and works there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the functionality we need to grasp.</p>
<p>Well, you talk about tools, essentially, that humans are able to incorporate into their</p>
<p>cognition.</p>
<p>Psychotechnologies, like language is one, I suppose.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t religion then a psychotechnology?</p>
<p>It would be, yeah, an ecology of psychotechnologies, yes.</p>
<p>And the question is that Nietzsche ruined everything by saying God is dead.</p>
<p>Do we have to invent the new thing?</p>
<p>Go from the old phone, create the iPhone, invent the new psychotechnology that takes</p>
<p>place of religion.</p>
<p>And so when the madman in Nietzsche&rsquo;s text goes into the marketplace, who&rsquo;s he talking</p>
<p>to?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not talking to the believers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talking to the atheists and he says, do you not realize what we have done?</p>
<p>We have taken a sponge and wiped away the sky.</p>
<p>We are now forever falling.</p>
<p>We are unchained from the sun.</p>
<p>We have to become worthy of this.</p>
<p>But Nietzsche is full of romantic bullshit, as we know.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No, but there&rsquo;s a point there.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The point is, right, there&rsquo;s one thing to rejecting the proposition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another project of replacing the functionality that we lost when we reject the religion.</p>
<p>So his worry that as nihilism takes hold, you don&rsquo;t ever replace the thing that religion,</p>
<p>the role that religion played in our world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell what he actually, because he&rsquo;s so multivocal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll speak for me rather than for Nietzsche.</p>
<p>I think it is possible to, using the best cognitive science and respectfully exacting</p>
<p>what we can from the best religion and philosophical traditions, because there&rsquo;s things like stoicism</p>
<p>that are in the grey line between philosophy and religion, Buddhism is the same.</p>
<p>Using that best cocci, that best exaptation, we can come up with that functionality without</p>
<p>having to buy into the particular propositional sets of the legacy religions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my proposal.</p>
<p>I call that the religion that&rsquo;s not a religion.</p>
<p>So things like stoicism or modern stoicism, those things, don&rsquo;t you think in some sense</p>
<p>they naturally emerge?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s a longing for meaning?</p>
<p>So stoicism arises during the Hellenistic period when there was a significant meaning</p>
<p>crisis in the ancient world because of what had happened after the breakup of Alexander</p>
<p>the Great&rsquo;s empire.</p>
<p>So if you compare Aristotle to people who are living after Alexander.</p>
<p>So Aristotle grows up in a place where everybody speaks the same language, has the same religion,</p>
<p>his ancestors have been there for years, he knows everybody.</p>
<p>After Alexander the Great&rsquo;s empire is broken up, people are now thousands of miles away</p>
<p>from the government, they&rsquo;re surrounded by people because of the diasporas, they&rsquo;re surrounded</p>
<p>by people that don&rsquo;t speak their language, don&rsquo;t share their religion, that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>get all these mother religions emerging, universal mother religions like ISIS, etc.</p>
<p>So there is what&rsquo;s called domicile, there&rsquo;s the killing of home, there&rsquo;s a loss of a</p>
<p>sense of home and belonging and fittedness during the Hellenistic period and stoicism</p>
<p>arose specifically to address that.</p>
<p>And because it was designed to address a meaning crisis, it is no coincidence that it is coming</p>
<p>back into prominence right now.</p>
<p>Well there could be a lot of other variations and it feels like, I think when you speak</p>
<p>of the meaning crisis, you&rsquo;re in part describing, not prescribing, you&rsquo;re describing something</p>
<p>that is happening.</p>
<p>But I would venture to say that if we just leave things be, the meaning crisis dissipates</p>
<p>because we long to create institutions, to create collective ideas, so this distributed</p>
<p>cognition process that give us meaning.</p>
<p>So if religion loses power, we&rsquo;ll find other institutions that are sources of meaning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that your intuition as well?</p>
<p>I think we are already doing that.</p>
<p>I am involved with and do participant observation of many of these emerging communities that</p>
<p>are creating a colleges of practice that are specifically about trying to address the meaning</p>
<p>crisis.</p>
<p>I just, in late July, went to Washington State and did Rafe Kelly&rsquo;s Evolve Move Play, Return</p>
<p>to the Source, and wow, one of the most challenging things I&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<p>That guy is awesome, by the way.</p>
<p>I got to interact with him a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>He said to say hi to you, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from another world.</p>
<p>It feels like a different world because I interacted with him, not directly, but&hellip;</p>
<p>This is somebody&hellip;</p>
<p>He can speak to what he works on, but he makes movement and play&hellip;</p>
<p>He encourages people to make that a part of their life, like how you move about the world,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s as part of sort of athletic endeavors or actual just like walking around</p>
<p>a city.</p>
<p>And I think the reason I ran into him is because there was a lot of interest in that in the</p>
<p>athletic world, in the grappling world, in the Brazilian jiu jitsu world, people who</p>
<p>study movement, who make movement part of their lives to see how can we integrate play</p>
<p>and fun and just the basic humanness that&rsquo;s natural to our movement.</p>
<p>How do we integrate that into our daily practice?</p>
<p>So this is yet another way to find meaning.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually an exemplar of what I was talking about because what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with Raif&rsquo;s integration of parkour in nature and martial arts and mindfulness practices</p>
<p>and dialogical practices is exactly, and explicitly so by the way, he will tell you he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>very influenced by my work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to get at the nonpropositional kinds of knowing that make meaning by evolving</p>
<p>our sensory motor loop and enhancing our relevance realization because that gives people profound</p>
<p>improved sense of connectedness to themselves, to each other and the world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you, Lex, I don&rsquo;t want to say too specifically the final thing that people</p>
<p>did because it&rsquo;s part of his secret sauce, right?</p>
<p>But what I can say is when it was done, I said to them all, I said, as far as I can</p>
<p>tell, none of you are religious, right?</p>
<p>And they go, yeah, yeah, and I said, but what you just did was a religious act, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And they all went, yeah, it was.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that same magic was there.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Bathroom break.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your take on atheism in general?</p>
<p>Is it closer to truth than, maybe is an atheist closer to truth than a person who believes</p>
<p>in God?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a nontheist, which means I think the shared set of presuppositions between the</p>
<p>theist and the atheist are actually what needs to be rejected.</p>
<p>Can you explain that further?</p>
<p>Yes, I can.</p>
<p>And I want to point out, by the way, that there are lots of nontheistic religious traditions.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not coming up with a sort of airy fairy category.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the difference in nontheism, agnosticism and atheism?</p>
<p>So nontheists think that the theist and the atheist share a bunch of presuppositions.</p>
<p>For example, it&rsquo;s that sacredness is to be understood in terms of a personal being that</p>
<p>is, in some sense, the supreme being, and that the right relationship to that being</p>
<p>is to have a correct set of beliefs.</p>
<p>I reject all of those claims.</p>
<p>So both the theist and the atheist see God.</p>
<p>In their modern version, yes, yes.</p>
<p>In which, do you reject it in the sense that you don&rsquo;t know, or do you reject it in a sense</p>
<p>that you believe that each one of those presuppositions is likely to be not true?</p>
<p>The latter.</p>
<p>Both on reflection, argument, and personal experimentation and experience, I&rsquo;ve come</p>
<p>to the conclusion that those shared propositions are probably not true.</p>
<p>Which one is the most troublesome to you?</p>
<p>The personal being, the kind of accumulation of everything into one being that ultimately</p>
<p>created stuff?</p>
<p>So for me, there&rsquo;s two, and they&rsquo;re interlocked together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to dodge your question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that the idea that the ground of being is some kind of being, I think, is a fundamental</p>
<p>mistake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s void of being?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>The ground of being is some kind of being, so it&rsquo;s turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>The ground of being is not itself any kind of being.</p>
<p>Being is not a being.</p>
<p>It is the ability for things to be, which is not the same thing as a being.</p>
<p>Are humans beings?</p>
<p>We are beings.</p>
<p>This glass is a being.</p>
<p>This table is a being.</p>
<p>But when I ask you, how are they all in being, you don&rsquo;t say, by being a glass or by being</p>
<p>a table or by being a human.</p>
<p>You want to say, no, no, there&rsquo;s something underneath it all, and then you realize it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be any thing.</p>
<p>This is why many mystical traditions converge on the idea that the ground of being is no</p>
<p>thingness, which is normally pronounced as nothingness.</p>
<p>But if you put the hyphen back in, you get the original intent, no thingness.</p>
<p>That is bound up with, okay, what I need to do in order to be in relationship with ‚Ä¶ So,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a misconstruing of ultimate reality as a supreme being, which is a category mistake</p>
<p>to my mind, and then my relationship to it, that sacredness is a function of belief.</p>
<p>And I have been presenting you an argument through most of our discussion that meaning</p>
<p>is at a deeper level than beliefs and propositions.</p>
<p>And so, that is a misunderstanding of sacredness, because I take sacredness to be that which</p>
<p>is most meaningful and connected to what is most real.</p>
<p>And theists think of sacredness as what?</p>
<p>They think of sacredness as a property of a particular being, God, and that the way</p>
<p>that is meaningful to them is by asserting a set of propositions or beliefs.</p>
<p>Now, I want to point out that this is what I would now call modern or common theism.</p>
<p>You go back into the classical periods of Christianity, you get a view that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>radically different from how most people understand theism today.</p>
<p>Okay, so let me ‚Ä¶ This is an interesting question that I usually think about in the</p>
<p>form of mathematics, but ‚Ä¶ So, in that case, if meaning is sacred in your nontheist view,</p>
<p>is meaning created or is it discovered?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Latin word that doesn&rsquo;t separate them called inventio, and I would say that,</p>
<p>and before you say, oh, well, give me a chance, because you participate in it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve experienced an insight, yes?</p>
<p>Did you make it happen?</p>
<p>The insight ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Did you make it happen or did ‚Ä¶ Did you do ‚Ä¶ Like, can you do that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have ‚Ä¶ I need an insight.</p>
<p>This is what I do to make an insight.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Yeah, in some sense, it came from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Right, but you didn&rsquo;t just passively receive it, either.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re engaged and involved in it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you get ‚Ä¶ Right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean by you participate in it.</p>
<p>You participate in meaning.</p>
<p>So you do think that it&rsquo;s both?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You do think it&rsquo;s both?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not a trivial thing to understand, because a lot of time we think ‚Ä¶ When you</p>
<p>think about a search for meaning, you think ‚Ä¶ It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re going through a big</p>
<p>house and you open each door and look if it&rsquo;s there and so on, as if there is going to be</p>
<p>a glowing orb that you discover, but at the same time, I&rsquo;m somebody that, based on the</p>
<p>chemistry of my brain, have been extremely fortunate to be able to discover beauty in</p>
<p>everything, in the most mundane and boring of things.</p>
<p>I am, as David Foster Wallace said, unboreable.</p>
<p>I could just sit in a room, just like playing with a tennis ball or something and be excited,</p>
<p>basically like a dog, I think, endlessly.</p>
<p>So to me, meaning is created, because I could create meaning out of everything, but of course,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t require a partner.</p>
<p>It does require dance partners, whatever, it does require the tennis ball.</p>
<p>But honestly, that&rsquo;s what a lot of people that I don&rsquo;t necessarily ‚Ä¶ We&rsquo;ll talk</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t practice meditation, but people who meditate very seriously, like the entire</p>
<p>days for months kind of thing, they talk about being able to discover meaning in just the</p>
<p>wind or something, like they just ‚Ä¶ The breath and everything, just subtle sensory</p>
<p>experiences give you deep fulfillment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, again, it&rsquo;s interaction.</p>
<p>Actually, I do want to say, because the interesting difference that you&rsquo;ve drawn between nontheism,</p>
<p>theism and atheism, where&rsquo;s the agreement or disagreement between you and Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>on this?</p>
<p>I want to say to Jordan about this, because you&rsquo;re very clear, it&rsquo;s kind of beautiful</p>
<p>in the clarity in which you lay this out.</p>
<p>I wonder if Jordan has arrived at a similar kind of clarity.</p>
<p>Have you been able to draw any kind of lines between the way the two of you see religion?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there was a video released, I think, like two or three weeks ago with Jordan and myself</p>
<p>and Jonathan Paget.</p>
<p>Oh, I haven&rsquo;t watched that one yet, yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s around this question, Lux.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically sort of making, he&rsquo;s putting together an argument for God.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s a fair way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he would object to me saying that.</p>
<p>And Jonathan Paget is also a, well, Jonathan is a Christian, it&rsquo;s unclear what Jordan</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>And Jonathan&rsquo;s work is on symbolism and different mythologies and Christianity.</p>
<p>Yes, especially Neoplatonic Christianity, which is very important.</p>
<p>I have a lot of respect, well, I have a lot of respect for both of them, but I have a</p>
<p>lot of respect for Jonathan.</p>
<p>But in my participation in that dialogue, you could see me, well, repeatedly, but I</p>
<p>think everybody, including Jordan, thought constructively challenging sort of the attempt</p>
<p>to build a theistic model, and I was challenging it from a nontheistic perspective.</p>
<p>So I think we don&rsquo;t agree on certain sets of propositions.</p>
<p>But there was a lot of, there was also a lot of acknowledgement, and I think genuine appreciation</p>
<p>on his part and Jonathan&rsquo;s part of the arguments I was making.</p>
<p>So they believe in maybe the presupposition of like a supreme being.</p>
<p>Not believe, but they see the power of that particular presupposition in being a source</p>
<p>of meaning.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s relatively clear for me with Jordan.</p>
<p>Jordan&rsquo;s a really complex guy, so it&rsquo;s very hard to just like pin.</p>
<p>To my best sort of understanding, yes, I think that&rsquo;s clearly the case for Jordan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the case for Jonathan.</p>
<p>Jonathan is, remember I said I was talking about modern atheism and theism?</p>
<p>Jonathan is a guy who somehow went into icon carving and Maximus the Confessor and Eastern</p>
<p>Orthodoxy and has come out of it at the other end as a fifth century church father that</p>
<p>is nevertheless being, rightfully so, found to be increasingly relevant to many people.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s deeply old school.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he has, he and I, especially because Neoplatonism is a nontheistic philosophical</p>
<p>spirituality and it&rsquo;s a big part of Eastern Orthodoxy, he and I, I think, he would say</p>
<p>things like, God doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a Christian, right?</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s being coy, but he&rsquo;ll say, well, God doesn&rsquo;t exist the way the cup exists or</p>
<p>the table exists, the same kind of move I was making a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll say things like that.</p>
<p>He will emphasize the no thingness of ultimate reality, the no thingness of God, because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s from that version of Christianity, what you might call classical theism, but classical</p>
<p>theism looks a lot more like nontheism than it looks like modern theism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>What about, is there a line to be drawn between myth and religion in terms of its usefulness</p>
<p>in man&rsquo;s search for meaning?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s where Jordan and I are in much more, actually all three of us are in significant</p>
<p>agreement.</p>
<p>I said this in my series, but I want to say it again here.</p>
<p>Myths aren&rsquo;t stories about things that happened in the deep past that are largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>Myths are stories about perennial or pertinent patterns that need to be brought into awareness.</p>
<p>And they need to be brought into an awareness, not just or primarily at the propositional</p>
<p>level, but at those nonpropositional levels.</p>
<p>And I think that is what good mythos does.</p>
<p>I prefer to use the Greek word because we&rsquo;ve now turned the English word into a synonym</p>
<p>for a widely believed falsehood.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think, again, if you go back even to the church fathers, I&rsquo;m not a Christian,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not advocating for Christianity, but neither am I here to attack it.</p>
<p>But when they talk about reading these stories, they think the literal interpretation is the</p>
<p>weakest and the least important.</p>
<p>You move to the allegorical or the symbolic, to the moral, to the spiritual, the mystical,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where&hellip;</p>
<p>So they would say to you, but how is the story of Adam and Eve true for you now?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean true for you in that relativistic sense, I mean, how is it pointing to a pattern</p>
<p>in your life right now?</p>
<p>So there is some sense in which the telling of this mythos becomes real in connecting</p>
<p>to the patterns that kind of captivate the public today.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So you just keep telling the story.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something about some of these stories that are just really good at being</p>
<p>sticky to the patterns of each generation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll stick to different patterns throughout time, they&rsquo;re just sticky in powerful ways.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so we keep returning back to them again and again and again.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to see that some of these stories are recursive, they&rsquo;re myths about</p>
<p>one particular set of patterns, they&rsquo;re myths about not just the important pattern.</p>
<p>You get the Jordan stuff about there&rsquo;s heroes and myths are trying to make us understand</p>
<p>the need for being heroic in our own lives.</p>
<p>One of the things I like to put in counterbalance to that is the Greek also have myths of hubris,</p>
<p>that counterbalance the heroic.</p>
<p>But then there are myths that are not about those deeply important patterns, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>myths about religio itself, that the way we&rsquo;re‚Äîreligio means to bind, to connect, the way relevance</p>
<p>realization connects us.</p>
<p>And so the point of the myth is not notice that pattern or notice that pattern or notice</p>
<p>that pattern, it&rsquo;s notice how all of these patterns are emerging and what does that say</p>
<p>about us and reality.</p>
<p>And those myths, those myths, I think, are genuinely profound.</p>
<p>And how much of the myths, how much of the power of those myths is about the dialogues?</p>
<p>You talk about this quite a bit, I think in the first conversation with Jordan, you guys,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;ve gotten really into it, you scratched the surface a little bit.</p>
<p>But the role of, as you say, dialogue in distributed cognition.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>The thing we&rsquo;re doing right now, talking with our mouth holes, what is that?</p>
<p>And actually, can I ask you this question?</p>
<p>If aliens came to Earth and were observing humans, would they notice our distributed</p>
<p>cognition first or our individual cognition first?</p>
<p>What is the most notable thing about us humans?</p>
<p>Is it our ability to individually do well on IQ tests or whatever?</p>
<p>Or puzzle solve, or is it this thing we&rsquo;re doing together?</p>
<p>I think most of our problem solving is done in distributed cognition.</p>
<p>Look around, you didn&rsquo;t make this equipment, you didn&rsquo;t build this place, you didn&rsquo;t invent</p>
<p>this language that we&rsquo;re both sharing, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s more specific and precise experimental evidence coming out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a standard task that people, reasoning task, I won&rsquo;t need to do the details, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the waste and selection task.</p>
<p>And you give it to people, highly educated psychology students, premier universities</p>
<p>across the world, we&rsquo;ve been doing it since the 60s, it replicates and replicates, and</p>
<p>only 10% of the people get it right.</p>
<p>You put them in a group of four, and you allow them to talk to each other, the success rate</p>
<p>goes to 80%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one example of a phenomenon that&rsquo;s coming to the fore.</p>
<p>By the way, do you know if a similar experiment has been done on a group of engineering students</p>
<p>versus psychology students?</p>
<p>Is there a major group differences in IQ between those two?</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>All right, so there is a lot of evidence that there&rsquo;s power to this distributed cognition.</p>
<p>Now what about this mechanism, this fascinating mechanism of the ants interacting with each</p>
<p>other?</p>
<p>The dialogue.</p>
<p>I use the word discourse or dialogue for just people having a conversation, and this is</p>
<p>deeply inspired by Socrates and Plato, especially the Platonic dialogues.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve all had this, and so give me a moment because I want to build onto something</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve participated in conversations that took on a life of their own and took us both in</p>
<p>directions we did not anticipate, afforded us insights that we could not have had on</p>
<p>our own.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have to have come to an agreement, but we were both moved and we were both drawn</p>
<p>into insight, and we feel like, wow, that was one of the best moments of my life because</p>
<p>we feel how that introduced us to a capacity for tapping into a flow state within distributed</p>
<p>cognition that puts us into a deeper relationship with ourselves, with another person, and potentially</p>
<p>with the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean by dialogos.</p>
<p>And so for me, I think dialogos is more important&hellip; Boy, I could just&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry, I can</p>
<p>hear Jordan and Jonathan in my head right now, but I think it&rsquo;s more&hellip;</p>
<p>I hear them all the time.</p>
<p>I just wish they would shut up in my head sometimes.</p>
<p>So what are they saying to you in your head?</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re saying&hellip; Well, see, that&rsquo;s what the most recent conversation was about.</p>
<p>I was trying to say that I don&rsquo;t think mythos is&hellip; I think mythos is really important.</p>
<p>I think these kinds of narratives are really important, but I think this ability to connect</p>
<p>together in distributed cognition, collective intelligence, and cultivate a shared flow</p>
<p>state within that collective intelligence so it starts to ramp up perhaps towards collective</p>
<p>wisdom.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s more important because I think that&rsquo;s the basin within which the myths and</p>
<p>the rituals are ultimately created and when they function.</p>
<p>A myth is like a public dream.</p>
<p>It depends on distributed cognition, and it depends on people enacting it and getting</p>
<p>into mutual flow states.</p>
<p>So the highest form of dialogos of conversation is this flow state, and that it forms the</p>
<p>foundation for myth building.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>So that communitas, that&rsquo;s Victor Turner&rsquo;s phrase, and he specifically linked it to flow,</p>
<p>and I study flow scientifically, that within distributed cognition as the home, as the</p>
<p>generator of mythos and ritual, and those are bound together as well, I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fundamentally correct.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s the cool thing here, because I&rsquo;m a huge fan of podcasts and audiobooks,</p>
<p>but podcasts in particular is relevant here, is there&rsquo;s a third person in this room listening</p>
<p>now, and they&rsquo;re also in the flow state.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m close friends with a lot of podcasts, they don&rsquo;t know I exist.</p>
<p>I just listen to them because I&rsquo;ve been in so many flow states with them, and I was like,</p>
<p>yes, yes, this is good.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t know I exist, but they are in conversation with me, ultimately.</p>
<p>And think of what that&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got dialogues, and then you&rsquo;ve got this meta dialogue like you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>and think about how things like podcasts and YouTube, they break down old boundaries between</p>
<p>the private and the public, between writing and oral speech.</p>
<p>So we have the dynamics of living oral speech, but it has the permanency of writing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the midst of creating a vehicle and a medium for distributed cognition that breaks</p>
<p>down a lot of the categories by which we organized our cognition.</p>
<p>Because of the tools of YouTube and so on, just the network, the graph of how quickly</p>
<p>the distributed cognition can spread is really powerful.</p>
<p>Just a huge amount of people have listened to your lectures, I&rsquo;ve listened to your lectures,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve experienced them, at least in your style, there&rsquo;s something about your style,</p>
<p>it felt like a conversation.</p>
<p>It felt like at any moment I could interrupt you and say something, and I was just listening.</p>
<p>Thank you for saying that, because I aspire to being genuinely as Socratic as I can when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was that sentence, actually, as I&rsquo;m saying it now, why was that?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t feel like sometimes lectures are kind of, you know, you come down with the</p>
<p>commandments and you just want to listen, but there was a sense like, I mean, I think</p>
<p>it was the excitement that you have, like, you have to understand, and also the fact</p>
<p>that you were kind of, I think, thinking off the top of your head sometimes, there was</p>
<p>a, you were interrupting yourself with thoughts, you were playing with thoughts, like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>reasoning through things often, like you had, you referenced a lot of books, so surely</p>
<p>you were extremely well prepared and you were referencing a lot of ideas, but then you were</p>
<p>also struggling in the way to present those ideas.</p>
<p>Yes, there was, and so the jazz, like the jazz and getting into the flow state and trying</p>
<p>to share in a participatory and perspectival fashion the learning with the people rather</p>
<p>than just pronouncing at them, yes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s mindfulness?</p>
<p>So published on that as well.</p>
<p>And I practice, I&rsquo;ve been practicing many forms of mindfulness and ecology of practices</p>
<p>since 1991, so I both have practitioner&rsquo;s knowledge and I also study it scientifically.</p>
<p>I think, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I was the first person to academically talk about mindfulness at</p>
<p>the University of Toronto within a classroom setting, like lecturing on it.</p>
<p>So this is a topic that a lot of people have recently become very interested in, think</p>
<p>about, so from that, from the early days, how do you think about what it is?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve critiqued the sort of standard definitions, being aware of the present moment without</p>
<p>judgment and because I think they&rsquo;re flawed, and if you want to get into the detail of</p>
<p>why we can, but this is how I want to explain it to you, and it also points to the fact</p>
<p>of why you need an ecology of mindfulness practices.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t equate mindfulness with meditation.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a primary mistake.</p>
<p>When you say ecology, what do you mean, by the way?</p>
<p>So lots of many different variants?</p>
<p>No, so what I mean by ecology is exactly what you have in an ecology.</p>
<p>You have a dynamical system in which there are checks and balances on each other, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll get to that with this about mindfulness, so I&rsquo;ll make that connection if you allow</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re always framing, we&rsquo;ve been talking about that, right?</p>
<p>And for those of you who are not on YouTube, this podcast, I wear glasses and I&rsquo;m now sort</p>
<p>of putting my fingers and thumb around the frames of my glasses.</p>
<p>So this is my frame, and my lens is, right, and that frame, the frame holds a lens, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing through it in both senses, beyond and by means of it.</p>
<p>So right now, my glasses are transparent to me.</p>
<p>I want to use that as a strong analogy for my mental framing, okay?</p>
<p>Now this is what you do in meditation, I would argue.</p>
<p>You step back from looking through your frame and you look at it, I&rsquo;m taking my glasses</p>
<p>off right now and I&rsquo;m looking at them.</p>
<p>Why might I do that?</p>
<p>To see if there&rsquo;s something in the lenses that is distorting, causing me to, right?</p>
<p>Now if I just did that, that could be helpful, but how do I know if I&rsquo;ve actually corrected</p>
<p>the change I made to my lenses?</p>
<p>What do I need to do?</p>
<p>I need to put my glasses on and see if I can now see more clearly and deeply than I could</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>Meditation is this, stepping back and looking at.</p>
<p>Contemplation is that looking through, and there are different kinds of practices.</p>
<p>The fact that we treat them as synonyms is a deep mistake.</p>
<p>The word contemplation has temple in it, in Latin contemplatio, means to look up to the</p>
<p>sky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a translation of the Greek word theoria, which we get our word theory from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to look deeply into things.</p>
<p>Meditation is more about having to do with reflecting upon, standing back and looking</p>
<p>at.</p>
<p>Mindfulness includes both.</p>
<p>It includes your ability to break away from an inappropriate frame and the ability to</p>
<p>make a new frame.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what actually happens in insight.</p>
<p>You have to both break an inappropriate frame and make, see, realize a new frame.</p>
<p>This is why mindfulness enhances insight.</p>
<p>Both ways, by the way, meditative practices and also contemplative practices.</p>
<p>So mindfulness is frame awareness that can be appropriated in order to improve your capacities</p>
<p>for insight and self regulation.</p>
<p>Now I am inexperienced with meditation, the rigorous practice and the science of meditation,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve talked to people who seriously as a science study psychedelics and they often</p>
<p>talk about the really important thing is the sort of the integration back.</p>
<p>So the contemplation step.</p>
<p>So if you, it&rsquo;s not just the actual things you see on psychedelics or the actual journey</p>
<p>of where your mind goes on psychedelics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the integrating that into the new perspective that you take on life.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You really nicely described.</p>
<p>So meditation is the, in that metaphors is the psychedelic journey to a different mind</p>
<p>state and then contemplation is the return back to reality, how you integrate that into</p>
<p>a new world view and mindfulness is the whole process.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if you just did contemplation, you could suffer from inflation and projective fantasy.</p>
<p>If you just do meditation, you can suffer from withdrawal, spiritual bypassing, avoiding</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>They act, they need each other.</p>
<p>You have to cycle between them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what I talked about earlier, when I talked about the opponent processing within</p>
<p>the autonomic nervous system or the opponent processing at work and attention.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I mean by an ecology of practices.</p>
<p>You need both.</p>
<p>Neither one is a panacea.</p>
<p>You need them in this opponent processing, acting as checks and balance on each other.</p>
<p>Is there sort of practical advice you can give to people on how to meditate or how to</p>
<p>be mindful in this full way?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I would tell them to do at least three things.</p>
<p>And I was, I lucked into this.</p>
<p>When I started meditation, I went down the street and there was a place that taught Vipassana</p>
<p>meditation, Metta contemplation and Tai Chi Chuan for flow induction.</p>
<p>And you should get, you should have a meditative practice, you should find a contemplative</p>
<p>practice and you should find a moving mindfulness practice, especially one that is conducive</p>
<p>to the flow state and practice them in an integrated fashion.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate what those practices might look like?</p>
<p>So generally speaking.</p>
<p>Meditative practice like Vipassana.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the primary thing I look through rather than look at?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my sensations.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m going to do is I&rsquo;m going to focus on my sensations rather than focusing on the</p>
<p>world through my sensations.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to follow, for example, the sensations in this area of my abdomen where my breathing</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>So I can feel as my abdomen is expanding, I can feel those sensations and then I can</p>
<p>feel the sensations as it&rsquo;s contracting.</p>
<p>Now what will happen is my mind will leap back to try to look through and look at the</p>
<p>world again.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start thinking about, I need to do my laundry or what was that noise?</p>
<p>And so what do I do?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get involved with the content.</p>
<p>I step back and label the process with an ING word, listening, imagining, planning.</p>
<p>And then I return my attention to the breath and I have to return my attention in the correct</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>So part of your mind that jumps around in the Buddhist tradition, this is called your</p>
<p>monkey mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a monkey leaping for branches and chattering, right?</p>
<p>If I was trying to train that monkey mind to stay, or as Jack Kornfield said, train</p>
<p>a puppy dog, stay puppy dog, and if it goes and I get really angry and I bring it back</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m yelling at it, I&rsquo;m going to train it to fight and fear me.</p>
<p>But if I just indulge it, if I just feed its whims, oh, look, the puppy dog went there.</p>
<p>Oh, now it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Puppy dog never learns to stay.</p>
<p>What do I need to do?</p>
<p>I have to neither fight it nor feed it.</p>
<p>I have to have this centered attitude.</p>
<p>I have to befriend it.</p>
<p>So you step back and look at your sensations.</p>
<p>You step back and look at your distracting processes.</p>
<p>You return your attention to the breath and you do it with the right attitude.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the core of a good meditative practice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Then what&rsquo;s a good contemplative practice?</p>
<p>A good contemplative practice is to try and meta, it&rsquo;s actually apropos because we talked</p>
<p>about that participatory knowing the way you&rsquo;re situated in the world.</p>
<p>So this is a long thing because there&rsquo;s different interpretations of meta and I go for what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called an existential interpretation over an emotional one.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m doing in meta is I&rsquo;m trying to awaken in two ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to awaken to the fact that I am constantly assuming an identity and assigning</p>
<p>an identity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m looking at that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to awaken to that and then I&rsquo;m trying to awake from the modal confusion that</p>
<p>I could get into around that.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m looking out onto the world and I&rsquo;m trying to see you in a fundamentally different</p>
<p>way than I have before.</p>
<p>You know, like you go to the gym and you do bicep curls.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is it possible to reduce it to those things that, I mean, you don&rsquo;t need to speak to the</p>
<p>specifics, but is there actual practice you can do or is it really personal?</p>
<p>No, I teach people how to do the meta practice.</p>
<p>I also teach them how to do a Neoplatonic contemplative practice, how to do a Stoic.</p>
<p>Another one you can do is the view from above.</p>
<p>This is classic Stoicism.</p>
<p>I get you to imagine that you&rsquo;re in this room and then imagine that you&rsquo;re floating above</p>
<p>the room, then above Austin, then above Texas, then above the United States, then the earth.</p>
<p>And you have to really imagine it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just think it, but really imagine.</p>
<p>And then what you notice is as you&rsquo;re pulling out to a wider and wider like contemplation</p>
<p>of reality, your sense of self and what you find relevant and important also changes.</p>
<p>No, for all of these, there is a specific step by step methodology.</p>
<p>Oh, so you can, so like in that one, you could just literally imagine yourself floating farther</p>
<p>and farther out.</p>
<p>But you have to go through the steps because the stepping matters because if you just jump,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Do you have any of this stuff online by the way?</p>
<p>I do because during COVID, I decided at the advice of a good friend to do a daily course.</p>
<p>I taught meditating with John Vervecki.</p>
<p>I did all the way through meditation, contemplation, even some of the movement practices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all available.</p>
<p>That was largely inspired by Buddhism and Taoism.</p>
<p>And then I went into the Western tradition and went through things like Stoicism and</p>
<p>Neoplatonism, cultivating wisdom with John Vervecki.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there, all free.</p>
<p>On your website?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on my YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>I mean, your Meaning Crisis lectures is just incredible.</p>
<p>Everything around it, including the notes and the notes that people took, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it created this tree of conversations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really, really well done.</p>
<p>What about flow induction?</p>
<p>You want to flow wisely.</p>
<p>And first of all, you need to understand what flow is, and then you need to confront a particular</p>
<p>issue around, a practical problem around flow.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there because a lot of those words seem like synonyms to people sometimes.</p>
<p>So the state of flow, what is it?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, and he just died last year, Csikszentmihalyi.</p>
<p>I admire him very much.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve exchanged a bunch of messages over the past few years, and he wanted to do the podcast</p>
<p>several times.</p>
<p>Oh, that would have been wonderful.</p>
<p>But he said he struggled with his health, and I never knew in those situations, I deeply</p>
<p>regret several cases like this that I had with Conway, that I should have pushed him</p>
<p>on it because, yeah, as you get later in life, things, the simple things become more difficult,</p>
<p>but a voice, especially one that hasn&rsquo;t been really heard, is important to hear.</p>
<p>So anyway, I apologize, but yeah.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I share that.</p>
<p>I mean, I can tell you that within my area, he is important and he&rsquo;s famous in an academics</p>
<p>sense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the flow state, two important sets of conditions, and very often people only talk about one,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a little bit of a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>So the flow state is in situations in which the demand of the situation is slightly beyond</p>
<p>your skills.</p>
<p>So you both have to apply all the skills you can with as much sort of attention and concentration</p>
<p>as you possibly can, and you have to actually be stretching your skills.</p>
<p>Now, in this circumstance, people report optimal experience, optimal in two ways.</p>
<p>Optimal in that this is one of the best experiences I&rsquo;ve had in my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s distinct from pleasure, and yet it explains why people do very bizarre things like rock</p>
<p>climbing because it&rsquo;s a good flow induction.</p>
<p>But they also mean optimal in a second sense, my best performance.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both the best experience and the best performance.</p>
<p>So Csikszentmihalyi also talked about the information flow conditions you need, right,</p>
<p>in order for there to be this state of flow, and then I&rsquo;ll talk about what it&rsquo;s like to</p>
<p>be in flow in a sec.</p>
<p>What you need is three things.</p>
<p>You need the information that you&rsquo;re getting to be clear.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be ambiguous or vague.</p>
<p>Think about a rock climber.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s ambiguous and vague, you&rsquo;re in trouble, right?</p>
<p>There has to be tightly coupled feedback between what you do and how the environment responds.</p>
<p>So when you act, there&rsquo;s an immediate response.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a big time lag between your action and your ability to detect the response from</p>
<p>the environment.</p>
<p>Third, failure has to matter.</p>
<p>Error really matters.</p>
<p>So there should be some anxiety about failure.</p>
<p>And failure matters.</p>
<p>So that, yeah, because‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Like to you, the person that participates.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Now when you&rsquo;re in the flow state, notice how this sits on the boundary between the</p>
<p>secular and the sacred.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in the flow state, people report a tremendous sense of atonement with the environment.</p>
<p>They report a loss of a particular kind of self consciousness, that narrative, nurturing</p>
<p>nanny in your head that, how do I look?</p>
<p>Do people like me?</p>
<p>How do I look?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s my hair?</p>
<p>Do people like me?</p>
<p>Should I have said that?</p>
<p>That all goes away.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re free from that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re free from the most sadistic, superego self critic you could possibly have, at least</p>
<p>for a while.</p>
<p>The world is vivid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super salient to you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an ongoing sense of discovery.</p>
<p>Although often you know you&rsquo;re exerting a lot of metabolic effort, it feels effortless.</p>
<p>So in the flow state when you&rsquo;re sparring, your hand just goes up for the block and your</p>
<p>strike just goes through the empty space.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re a goalie in hockey, I&rsquo;ve got to mention hockey once, I&rsquo;m a Canadian, right?</p>
<p>You put out your glove hand and the puck&rsquo;s there, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this tremendous sense of grace, atonement, super salience, discovery and realness.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t, when they&rsquo;re in the flow state, they don&rsquo;t go, I bet this is an illusion.</p>
<p>The interesting question for me and my coauthors in the article we published in the Oxford</p>
<p>Handbook of Spontaneous Thought with Arianne Harabennett and Leo Ferraro is that&rsquo;s a descriptive</p>
<p>account of flow.</p>
<p>We wanted an explanatory account, one of the causal mechanisms at work in flow.</p>
<p>And so we actually proposed to interlocking cognitive processes.</p>
<p>The first thing we said is, well, what&rsquo;s going on in flow?</p>
<p>Well think about it.</p>
<p>Think about the rock climber.</p>
<p>The rock climber, and I talked about this earlier, they&rsquo;re constantly restructuring</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re seeing the rock face.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly doing something like insight, and if they fail to do it, they impasse and</p>
<p>that starts to get dangerous.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got to do an insight that primes an insight that primes an insight.</p>
<p>So imagine the aha experience, that flash and that moment, and imagine it cascading</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re getting the extended aha.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why things are super salient.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of discovery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of atonement, of deep participation, of grace, but there&rsquo;s something else going</p>
<p>on too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a phenomenon called implicit learning, also very well replicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way back in the 60s with Rieber.</p>
<p>You can give people complex patterns, like number and letter strings, and they can learn</p>
<p>about those patterns outside of deliberate focal awareness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called implicit learning.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is if you try and change that task into, tell me the pattern, but explicitly</p>
<p>try to figure it out, the performance degrades.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>You have this adaptive capacity for implicit learning, and what it does is it results in</p>
<p>you being able to track complex variables in a way, but you don&rsquo;t know how you came</p>
<p>up with that knowledge.</p>
<p>And this is Hogarth&rsquo;s proposal in educating intuition.</p>
<p>Intuition is actually the result of implicit learning.</p>
<p>So an example I use is how far do you stand away from somebody at a funeral?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of complex variables.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s status, closeness to the person, your relationship to them, past history, all kinds</p>
<p>of stuff, and yet you know how to do it, and you didn&rsquo;t have to go to funeral school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just using that as an example.</p>
<p>So you have these powerful intuitions.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s Hogarth&rsquo;s great point.</p>
<p>Implicit learning, remember I said before, the things that make it adaptive make us subject</p>
<p>to self deception?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>Implicit learning is powerful at picking up on complex patterns, but it doesn&rsquo;t care what</p>
<p>kind of pattern it is.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t distinguish causal patterns from merely correlational patterns.</p>
<p>So implicit learning, when we like it, it&rsquo;s intuition.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s picking up on stuff that&rsquo;s bogus, we call it prejudice or all kinds of other</p>
<p>names for intuition that&rsquo;s going wrong.</p>
<p>Now, he said, okay, what do we do?</p>
<p>What do we do about this?</p>
<p>And this will get back to Flo.</p>
<p>What do we do about this?</p>
<p>Well, we can&rsquo;t try to replace implicit learning with explicit learning because we&rsquo;ll lose</p>
<p>all the adaptiveness to it.</p>
<p>So what can we do explicitly?</p>
<p>What we can do is take care of the environment in which we&rsquo;re doing the implicit learning.</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>We try to make sure the environment has features that help us distinguish causation from correlation.</p>
<p>What kind of environments have we created that are good at distinguishing causation</p>
<p>from correlation?</p>
<p>Experimental environments.</p>
<p>What do you do in an experiment?</p>
<p>You make sure that the variables are clear, no confound, no ambiguity, no vagueness.</p>
<p>You make sure there&rsquo;s a tight coupling between the independent and the dependent variable</p>
<p>and your hypothesis can be falsified.</p>
<p>Error matters.</p>
<p>Now look at those three, Lex.</p>
<p>Those are exactly the three conditions that you need for Flo.</p>
<p>Clear information, tightly coupled feedback and error matters.</p>
<p>So Flo is not only an insight cascade, improving your insight capacity, it&rsquo;s also a marker</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re cultivating the best kind of intuitions, the ones that fit you best to the causal</p>
<p>patterns in your environment.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to achieve that kind of environment where there&rsquo;s a clear distinction between</p>
<p>causality and correlation and it has the rigor of a scientific experiment.</p>
<p>Fair enough and I don&rsquo;t think Hogarth was saying it&rsquo;s gonna be epistemically as rigorous</p>
<p>as a scientific experiment, but he&rsquo;s saying if you structure that, it will tend to do</p>
<p>what that scientific method does, which is find causal&hellip;</p>
<p>Think of the rock climber.</p>
<p>All of those things are the case.</p>
<p>They need clear information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tightly coupled and error matters and they think what they&rsquo;re doing is very real</p>
<p>because if they&rsquo;re not conforming to the real causal patterns of the rock face and the physiology</p>
<p>of their body, they will fall.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about the power of discovering meaning and having this deep</p>
<p>relationship with the moment?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about flow that really forgets the past and the future and is really focused</p>
<p>on the moment.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of the phenomenology, but I think the functionality has to do with</p>
<p>the fact that what&rsquo;s happening in flow is that dynamic nonpropositional connectedness</p>
<p>that is so central to meaning is being optimized.</p>
<p>This is why flow is a good predictor of how well you rate your life, how much well being</p>
<p>you think you have, which of course is itself also predictive and interrelated with how</p>
<p>meaningful you find your life.</p>
<p>One of the things that you can do, but there&rsquo;s an important caveat, to increase your sense</p>
<p>of meaning in life is to get into the flow state more frequently.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I said you want a moving practice that&rsquo;s conducive to the flow state, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one important caveat, which is we of course have figured out and I&rsquo;m playing with words</p>
<p>here how to game this and how to hijack it by creating things like video games.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is the case for all video games or this is the case for all people,</p>
<p>but the WHO now acknowledges this as a real thing that you can get into the flow state</p>
<p>within the video game world to the detriment of your ability to get into the flow state</p>
<p>in the real world.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the opposite of flow?</p>
<p>Depression.</p>
<p>In fact, depression has been called anti flow.</p>
<p>So you get these people that are flowing in this non real world and they can&rsquo;t transfer</p>
<p>it to the real world and it&rsquo;s actually costing them flow in the real world.</p>
<p>So they tend to get, they tend to suffer depression and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Your ability, your habit and just skill at attaining flow in the video game world basically</p>
<p>makes you less effective or maybe shocks you at how difficult it is to achieve flow in</p>
<p>the physical world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about that.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t want to push back against the implied challenge of transferability because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of, I have a lot of friends that play video games, a very large percent</p>
<p>of young folks play video games and I&rsquo;m hesitant to build up models of how that affects behavior.</p>
<p>My intuition is weak there.</p>
<p>Sometimes people that have PhDs are of a certain age that they came up when video games weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a deep part of their life development.</p>
<p>I would venture to say people who have developed their brain with video games being a part,</p>
<p>a large part of that world are in some sense different humans and it&rsquo;s possible that they</p>
<p>can transfer more effectively.</p>
<p>Some of the lessons, some of the ability to attain flow from the virtual world to the</p>
<p>physical world, they&rsquo;re also more, I would venture to say, resilient to the negative</p>
<p>effects of, for example, social media or video games that have maybe the objectification</p>
<p>or the over sexualized or violent aspect of video games.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to turn that off when they go to the physical world and turn it back on</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re playing the video games probably more effectively than the old timers.</p>
<p>So I just want to say this sort of, I&rsquo;m not sure, it&rsquo;s a really interesting question how</p>
<p>transferable the flow state is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you want to comment on that.</p>
<p>I do, I do.</p>
<p>First of all, I did qualify and I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s not the case for all video games or for</p>
<p>all people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m holding out the possibility and I know this possibility because I&rsquo;ve had students</p>
<p>who actually suffer from this and have done work around it with me.</p>
<p>The ability to achieve.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t transfer, yeah.</p>
<p>And then they were able to step back from that and then take up the cognitive science</p>
<p>and write about it and work on it.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m not so sure about the resiliency claim because there seems to be mounting evidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not consensus, but it&rsquo;s certainly not regarded as fringe, that the increase in social</p>
<p>media is pretty strongly correlated with increase in depression, self destructive behavior,</p>
<p>things like this.</p>
<p>I would like to see that evidence.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I can find it.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Let me, I&rsquo;m always hesitant to too eagerly kind of agree with things that I want to agree</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a public perception everyone seems to hate on social media.</p>
<p>I wonder, as always with these things, does it reveal depression or does it create depression?</p>
<p>This is always the question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like whenever you talk about any political or ideological movement, does it create hate</p>
<p>or does it reveal hate?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing to ask and you should always challenge the things that you intuitively</p>
<p>want to believe.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>Like aliens.</p>
<p>So one of the ways you address this, and it&rsquo;s not sufficient and I did say the work is preliminary,</p>
<p>but if I can give you a plausible mechanism that&rsquo;s new and then that lends credence.</p>
<p>And part of what happens is illusory social comparison.</p>
<p>Think of Instagram.</p>
<p>People are posting things that are not accurate representation of their life or life events.</p>
<p>In fact, they will stage things, but the people that are looking at these, they take it often</p>
<p>as real and so they get downward social comparison and this is like compared to how you and I</p>
<p>probably live where we may get one or two of those events a week, they&rsquo;re getting them</p>
<p>moment by moment.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a plausible mechanism that why it might be driving people into a more depressed</p>
<p>state.</p>
<p>Okay, the flip side of that is because there&rsquo;s a greater, greater gap going from real world</p>
<p>to Instagram world, you start to be able to laugh at it and realize that it&rsquo;s artificial.</p>
<p>So for example, even just artificial filters, people start to realize like, there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same kind of gap as there is between the video game world and the real world.</p>
<p>In the video game world, you can do all kinds of wild things.</p>
<p>Grand theft auto, you can shoot people up, you can do whatever the heck you want.</p>
<p>In the real world, you can&rsquo;t and you start to develop an understanding of how to have</p>
<p>fun in the virtual world and in the physical world.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just as a pushback, I&rsquo;m not saying either is true though, those are very</p>
<p>interesting claims.</p>
<p>The more ridiculously out of touch Instagram becomes, the easier you can laugh it off potentially</p>
<p>in terms of the effect it has on your psyche.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll respond to that.</p>
<p>But at some point, we should get back to Flo.</p>
<p>As we engage in Flo.</p>
<p>You laugh at the shampoo commercial and you buy the shampoo.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a capacity for tremendous bullshitting because of the way these machines are designed</p>
<p>to trigger salience without triggering reflective truth seeking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of common examples because sometimes you can laugh all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>You can laugh and not buy the shampoo.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many cases, so I think you have to laugh hard enough.</p>
<p>You do have to laugh hard enough, but the advertisers get millions of dollars precisely</p>
<p>because for many, many people, it does make you buy the shampoo and that&rsquo;s the concern.</p>
<p>And maybe the machine of social media is such that it optimizes the shampoo buying.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make is whether or not that particular example is ultimately</p>
<p>right, the possibility of transfer failure is a real thing.</p>
<p>And I want to contrast that to an experience I had when I was in grad school.</p>
<p>I had been doing Tai Chi Chuan about three or four years, very religiously, both senses</p>
<p>of the word, like three or four hours a day and reading all the literature and I was having</p>
<p>all the weird experiences, cold as ice, hot as lava, all that stuff and it&rsquo;s ooh, right?</p>
<p>But my friends in grad school, they said to me, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>And I said, what do you mean?</p>
<p>And they said, well, you&rsquo;re a lot more balanced in your interactions and you&rsquo;re a lot more</p>
<p>flowing and you&rsquo;re a lot more sort of flexible and you adjust more and I realized, oh, and</p>
<p>this was the sort of Taoist claim around Tai Chi Chuan that it actually transfers in ways</p>
<p>that you might not expect.</p>
<p>You start to be able, and I&rsquo;ve now noticed that, I now notice how I&rsquo;m doing Tai Chi even</p>
<p>in this interaction and how it can facilitate and afford and so there&rsquo;s a powerful transfer</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I meant by flow wisely, not only flow in a way that&rsquo;s making sure that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re distinguishing causation from correlation, which flow can do, but find how to situate</p>
<p>it, home it so that it will percolate through your psyche and permeate through many domains</p>
<p>of your life.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say similar to our discussion about mindfulness and meditation</p>
<p>and contemplation about the world that psychedelics take our mind?</p>
<p>Where does the mind go when it&rsquo;s on psychedelics?</p>
<p>I want to remind you of something you said, which is a gem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much the experience, but the degree to which it can be integrated back.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a proposal that comes from Woodward and others, a lot of convergence around this.</p>
<p>Carhartt Harris is talking about it similarly in the entropic brain, but I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>talk first about psychedelics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about neural networks and I&rsquo;m going to talk about a classic problem</p>
<p>in neural networks.</p>
<p>So neural networks, like us with intuition and implicit learning, are fantastic at picking</p>
<p>up on complex patterns.</p>
<p>Which neural networks are we talking about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about a general, just general&hellip;</p>
<p>Both artificial and biological?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think at this point, there is no relevant difference.</p>
<p>So one of the classic problems because of their power is they suffer from overfitting</p>
<p>to the data, or for those of you who are in a statistical orientation, they pick up patterns</p>
<p>in the sample that aren&rsquo;t actually present in the population.</p>
<p>And so what you do is there&rsquo;s various strategies.</p>
<p>You can do dropout where you periodically turn off half of the nodes in a network.</p>
<p>You can drop noise into the network.</p>
<p>And what that does is it prevents overfitting to the data and allows the network to generalize</p>
<p>more powerfully to the environment.</p>
<p>I proposed to you that that&rsquo;s basically what psychedelics do.</p>
<p>They do that.</p>
<p>They basically do significant constraint reduction.</p>
<p>And so you get areas of the brain talking to each other that don&rsquo;t normally talk to</p>
<p>each other, areas that do talk to each other, not talking to each other, down regulation</p>
<p>of areas that are very dominant, like the default mode network, et cetera.</p>
<p>And what that does is exactly something strongly analogous to what&rsquo;s happening in dropout or</p>
<p>putting noise into the data.</p>
<p>It opens up.</p>
<p>And by the way, if you give human beings an insight problem that they&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>
<p>and you throw in some noise, like literally static on the screen, you can trigger an insight</p>
<p>in them.</p>
<p>So like literally very simplistic kind of noise to the perception system.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It can break it out of overfitting to the data and open you up.</p>
<p>Now, that means, though, that just doing that in and of itself is not the answer because</p>
<p>you also have to make sure that the system can go back to exploring that new space properly.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a problem with neural networks.</p>
<p>You turn off dropout and they just go back to being powerful neural networks, and now</p>
<p>they explore the state space that they couldn&rsquo;t explore before.</p>
<p>Human beings are a little bit more messy around this, and this is where the analogy does get</p>
<p>a little bit strained.</p>
<p>So they need practices that help them integrate that opening up to the new state space so</p>
<p>they can properly integrate it.</p>
<p>So beyond Leary&rsquo;s state and setting, I think you need another S. I think you need sacred.</p>
<p>You need, psychedelics need to be practiced within a sapiential framework, a framework</p>
<p>in which people are independently and beforehand improving their abilities to deal with self</p>
<p>deception and afford insight and self regulate.</p>
<p>This is, of course, the overwhelming way in which psychedelics are used by indigenous</p>
<p>cultures.</p>
<p>And I think if we put them into that context, then they can help the project of people self</p>
<p>transcending, cultivating meaning and increasing wisdom.</p>
<p>But if I think we remove them out of that context and put them in the context of commodities</p>
<p>taken just to have certain phenomenological changes, we run certain important risks.</p>
<p>So using the term of higher states of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is consciousness an important part of that word?</p>
<p>Why higher?</p>
<p>Is it a higher state or is it a detour, a side road on the main road of consciousness?</p>
<p>Where do we go here?</p>
<p>I think the psychedelic state is on a continuum.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s insight and then flow is an insight cascade.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s flow and then you can have sort of psychedelic experiences, mind revealing experiences,</p>
<p>but they overlap with mystical experiences and they aren&rsquo;t the same.</p>
<p>So for example, in the Griffiths lab, they gave people psilocybin and they taught them</p>
<p>ahead of time sort of the features of a mystical experience and only a certain proportion of</p>
<p>the people that took the psilocybin went from a psychedelic into a mystical experience.</p>
<p>What was interesting is the people that had the mystical experience had measurable and</p>
<p>longstanding change to one of the big five factors of personality.</p>
<p>They had increased openness, openness is supposed to actually go down over time and these traits</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t supposed to be that malleable and it was significantly like altered, right?</p>
<p>But imagine if you just created more openness in a person, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re now open to a lot more and they want to explore a lot more, but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give them the tools of discernment.</p>
<p>That could be problematic for them in important ways.</p>
<p>That could be very problematic.</p>
<p>Yes, I got it, but you know, so you have to land the plane in a productive way somehow</p>
<p>integrated back into your life and how you see the world and how you frame your perception</p>
<p>of that world.</p>
<p>And when people do that, that&rsquo;s when I call it a transformative experience.</p>
<p>Now the higher states of consciousness are really interesting because they tend to move</p>
<p>people from a mystical experience into a transformative experience, because what happens in these</p>
<p>experiences is something really, really interesting.</p>
<p>They get to a state that&rsquo;s ineffable, they can&rsquo;t put it into words, they can&rsquo;t describe</p>
<p>it, but they&rsquo;re in this state temporarily and then they come back and they do this.</p>
<p>They say, that was really real and this in comparison is less real.</p>
<p>So I remember that platonic meta desire, I want to change my life myself so that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>more in conformity with that really real, and that is really odd, Lex, because normally</p>
<p>when we go outside of our consensus intelligibility, like a dream state, we come back from it,</p>
<p>we say, that doesn&rsquo;t fit into everything, therefore it&rsquo;s unreal.</p>
<p>They do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>They come out of these states and they say, that doesn&rsquo;t fit into this consensus intelligibility</p>
<p>and that means this is less real.</p>
<p>They do the exact opposite and that fascinates me.</p>
<p>Why do they flip our normal procedure about evaluating alternative states?</p>
<p>The thing is those higher states of consciousness, precisely because they have that ontonormativity,</p>
<p>the realness that demands that you make a change in your life, they serve to bridge</p>
<p>between mystical experiences and genuine transformative experiences.</p>
<p>So you do think seeing those as more real is productive because then you reach for them.</p>
<p>So Jaden&rsquo;s done work on it, and again, all of this stuff isn&rsquo;t recent, so we have to</p>
<p>take it with a grain of salt, but by a lot of objective measure, people who do this,</p>
<p>who have these higher states of consciousness and undertake the transformative process,</p>
<p>their lives get better, their relationships improve, their sense of self improves, their</p>
<p>anxieties go down, depression, like all of these other measures, the needles are moved</p>
<p>on these measures by people undergoing this transformative experience.</p>
<p>Their lives, by many of the criteria that we judge our lives to be good, get better.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about this fascinating distributed cognition process that leads to mass formation</p>
<p>of ideologies that have had an impact on our world.</p>
<p>So you spoke about the clash of the two great pseudo religious ideologies of Marxism and</p>
<p>Nazism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Especially their clash on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Battle of Kursk.</p>
<p>Can you explain the origin of each of these, Marxism and Nazism, in a kind of way that</p>
<p>we have been talking about the formation of ideas?</p>
<p>Hegel is to Protestantism what Thomas Aquinas is to Catholicism.</p>
<p>He was the philosopher who took German Protestantism and also Kant and Fichte and Schelling, and</p>
<p>he built a philosophical system.</p>
<p>He explicitly said this, by the way.</p>
<p>He wanted to bridge between philosophy and religion.</p>
<p>He explicitly said that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not foisting that on him.</p>
<p>He said it repeatedly in many different places.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s trying to create a philosophical system that gathered to it, I think, the core mythos</p>
<p>of Christianity.</p>
<p>The core mythos of Christianity is this idea of a narrative structure to reality in which</p>
<p>progress is real, in which our actions now can change the future.</p>
<p>We can co participate with God in the creation of the future, and that future can be better.</p>
<p>It can reach something like a utopia or the promised land or whatever.</p>
<p>He created a philosophical system of brilliance, by the way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a genius.</p>
<p>But basically what it did was it took that religious vision and gave it the air of philosophical</p>
<p>intelligibility and respect.</p>
<p>And then Marx takes that and says, you know that process by which the narrative is working</p>
<p>itself out that Hegel called dialectic, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s primarily happening in ideas.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s happening primarily between classes within socioeconomic factors.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the same story.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this mechanism of history, it&rsquo;s teleological, it&rsquo;s going to move this way, it can move towards</p>
<p>a utopia.</p>
<p>We can either participate in furthering it, like participating in the work of God, or</p>
<p>we can thwart it and be against it.</p>
<p>And so you have a pseudo religious vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all encompassing.</p>
<p>Think about how Marxism is not just a philosophical position, it&rsquo;s not just an economic position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an entire worldview, an entire account of history, and a demanding account of what</p>
<p>human excellence is.</p>
<p>And it has all these things about participating, belonging, fitting to.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very, in Marx&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s very pragmatic or directly applicable to society, to where</p>
<p>it leads to, it more naturally leads to political ideologies.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>But I think Marx, to a very significant degree, inherits one of Hegel&rsquo;s main flaws.</p>
<p>Hegel is talking about all this and he&rsquo;s trying to fit it into post Kantian philosophy.</p>
<p>So for him, it&rsquo;s ultimately propositional, conceptual.</p>
<p>He like everybody after Descartes is very focused on the propositional level, and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not paying deep attention to the nonpropositional.</p>
<p>This is why the two great critics of Hegel, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to put their finger on the nonpropositional, the nonconceptual, the will to power or faith</p>
<p>in Kierkegaard, and they&rsquo;re trying to bring out all these other kinds of knowing as being</p>
<p>inadequate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Kierkegaard meant when he said, Hegel made a system and then he sat down beside</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And so Marxism is very much, it is activist, it&rsquo;s about reorganizing society, but the transformation</p>
<p>in individuals is largely ideological, meaning it&rsquo;s largely about these significant propositional</p>
<p>changes and adopting a set of beliefs.</p>
<p>When it came in contact with the Soviet Union or with what became the Soviet Union, why</p>
<p>do you think it had such a powerful hold on such a large number of people?</p>
<p>Not Marxism, but implementation of Marxism in the name of communism.</p>
<p>Because it offered people, I mean, it offered people something that typically only religions</p>
<p>had offered, and it offered people the hope of making a new man, a new kind of human being</p>
<p>in a new world.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;ve been living in Russia, in which things seem to be locked in a system</p>
<p>that is crushing most people, getting the promise in the air of scientific legitimacy</p>
<p>that we can make new human beings and a new world and in which happiness will ensue, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an intoxicating proposal.</p>
<p>You get sort of, like I said, you get all of the intoxication of a religious utopia,</p>
<p>but you get all the seeming legitimacy of claiming that it&rsquo;s a scientific understanding</p>
<p>of history and economics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very popular to criticize communism, Marxism these days, and I often put myself</p>
<p>in the place before any of the implementations came to be, I tried to think if I would be</p>
<p>able to predict what the implementations of Marxism and communism would result in, in</p>
<p>the 20th century.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m smart enough to make that prediction.</p>
<p>Because at the core of the ideas are respecting, with Marx it&rsquo;s very economics type theory,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s basically respecting the value of the worker and the regular man in society</p>
<p>for making a contribution to that society.</p>
<p>And to me that seems like a powerful idea, and it&rsquo;s not clear to me how it goes wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s still not clear to me why the hell would Stalin happen, or Mao happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something very interesting and complex about human nature in hierarchies, about distributed</p>
<p>cognition that results in that, and it&rsquo;s not trivial to understand.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I wonder if you could put a finger on it.</p>
<p>Why did it go so wrong?</p>
<p>So I think, you know, what Ohana talks about in The Intellectual History of Modernity talks</p>
<p>about the Promethean spirit, the idea, the really radical proposal.</p>
<p>And think about how it&rsquo;s not so radical to us, and in that sense Marxism has succeeded.</p>
<p>The radical proposal that you see even in the French Revolution, and don&rsquo;t forget the</p>
<p>terror comes in the French Revolution too, that we can make ourselves into godlike beings.</p>
<p>Think of the hubris in that, and think of the overconfidence to think that we so understand</p>
<p>human nature and all of its complexities and human history, and how religion functioned,</p>
<p>that we can just come in with a plan and make it run.</p>
<p>To my mind, that Promethean spirit is part of why it&rsquo;s doomed to fail, and it&rsquo;s doomed</p>
<p>to fail in a kind of terrorizing way, because the Promethean spirit really licenses you</p>
<p>to do anything, because the ends justify the means.</p>
<p>The ends justify the means really free you to do some of, basically, well, commit atrocities</p>
<p>at any scale.</p>
<p>Ground zero with Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, right, exactly.</p>
<p>And you can only believe in an ends that can justify any means if you believe in a utopia,</p>
<p>and you can only believe in the utopia if you really buy into the Promethean spirit.</p>
<p>So is that what explains Nazism?</p>
<p>So Nazism is part of that, too.</p>
<p>The Promethean spirit that we can make ourselves into supermen, ubermensch, right?</p>
<p>And Nazism is fueled very much by appropriating and twisting sort of Gnostic themes that are</p>
<p>very prevalent, Gnosticism tends to come to the fore when people are experiencing increased</p>
<p>meaning crisis.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget, the Weimar Republic is like a meaning crisis gone crazy on all levels.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s suffering domicile, everybody&rsquo;s home and way of life and identity and culture</p>
<p>and relationship to religion and science, all of that, right?</p>
<p>So Nazism comes along and offers a kind of Gnosticism, again, twisted, perverted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that all Gnostics are Nazis, but there is this Gnostic mythology, mythos,</p>
<p>and it comes to the fore.</p>
<p>I remember, and this stuck with me in undergrad, I was taking political science, and the professor</p>
<p>extended lecture on this, and it still rings true for me, says, if you understand Nazism</p>
<p>as just a political movement, you have misunderstood it.</p>
<p>It is much more a religious phenomenon in many ways.</p>
<p>Is it religious in that the loss of religion?</p>
<p>So is it a meaning crisis?</p>
<p>Or is it out of a meaning crisis every discovery of religion in a Promethean type of&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the latter.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s this vacuum created.</p>
<p>In that context, is Hitler the central religious figure?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And also, did Nazi Germany create Hitler, or did Hitler create Nazi Germany?</p>
<p>So in this distributed cognition where everyone&rsquo;s having a dialogue, what&rsquo;s the role of a charismatic</p>
<p>leader?</p>
<p>Is it an emergent phenomena, or do you need one of those to kind of guide the populace?</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s not a necessary requirement.</p>
<p>I hope that the next Buddha can be the Sangha rather than a specific individual.</p>
<p>But I think in that situation, Hitler&rsquo;s charisma allowed him to take on a mythological, in</p>
<p>the proper sense, archetypal&hellip;</p>
<p>He became deeply symbolic, and he instituted all kinds of rituals, all kinds of rituals,</p>
<p>and all kinds of mythos.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this mythos about the master race, and there&rsquo;s all these rituals.</p>
<p>The swastika is, of course, itself a religious symbol.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all of this going on because he was tapping into the fact that when you put people</p>
<p>into deeper and deeper meaning scarcity, they will fall back on more and more mythological</p>
<p>ways of thinking in order to try and come up with a generative source to give them new</p>
<p>meaning making.</p>
<p>I should say meaning participating behavior.</p>
<p>What is evil?</p>
<p>Is this a word you avoid?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Because I think part of what we&rsquo;re wrestling with here is resisting the Enlightenment,</p>
<p>I mean the historical period in Europe, the idea that evil and sin can just be reduced</p>
<p>to immorality, individual human immorality.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something deeper in the idea of sin than just immoral.</p>
<p>I think sin is a much more comprehensive category.</p>
<p>I think sin is a failure to love wisely so that you ultimately engage in a kind of idolatry.</p>
<p>You take something as ultimate, which is not.</p>
<p>And that can tend to constellate these collective agents, I call them hyperagents, within distributed</p>
<p>cognition that have a capacity to wreak havoc on the world that is not just due to a sort</p>
<p>of a sum total of immoral decisions.</p>
<p>This goes to Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s thing, and the banality of Eichmann.</p>
<p>She was really wrestling with it, and I think she&rsquo;s close to something, but I think she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>slightly off.</p>
<p>Eichmann is just making a whole bunch of immoral decisions, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to capture</p>
<p>the gravity of what the Nazis did, the genocide and the warfare.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s right, because you&rsquo;re not going to get just the summation of a lot of individual</p>
<p>rather banal immoral choices adding up to what was going on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting a comprehensive parasitic process within massive distributed cognition that</p>
<p>has the power to confront the world and confront aspects of the world that individuals can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think when we&rsquo;re talking about evil, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to point to.</p>
<p>This is a point of convergence between me and Jonathan Paget.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about this.</p>
<p>So the word sin is interesting.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are you comfortable using the word sin?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m comfortable.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so deeply rooted in religious texts.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And in part, and I struggle around this because I was brought up as a fundamentalist Christian,</p>
<p>and so that is still there within me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s trauma associated with that.</p>
<p>Probably layers of self deception mechanisms.</p>
<p>No doubt.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re slowly escaping.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Trying to.</p>
<p>And trying to come into a proper respectful relationship with Christianity via a detour</p>
<p>through Buddhism, Taoism, and pagan Neoplatonism.</p>
<p>Trying to find a way how to love wisely.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And so I think the term sin is good because somebody may not be doing something that we</p>
<p>would prototypically call immoral, but if they&rsquo;re failing to love wisely, they are disconnecting</p>
<p>themselves in some important way from the structures of reality.</p>
<p>And I think it was Hume.</p>
<p>I may be wrong.</p>
<p>Hume says, you know, people don&rsquo;t do things because they think it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>They do a lesser good in place of a greater good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a different thing than being immoral.</p>
<p>Immoral, we&rsquo;re saying, you&rsquo;re doing something that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, no, no, you know, I&rsquo;m loving my wife.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great thing, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But if you love your wife at the expense of your kids, like, wow, maybe something&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>awry here.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, I love my country.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>But should you love your country at the expense of your commitment to the religion you belong</p>
<p>to?</p>
<p>I mean, people should wrestle with these questions.</p>
<p>And I think sin is a failure to wrestle with these questions properly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To be content with the choices you&rsquo;ve made without considering, is there a greater good</p>
<p>that could be done?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Your lecture series on The Meaning Crisis puts us in dialogue in the same way as with</p>
<p>the podcast with a bunch of fascinating thinkers throughout history.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For example, Paul Corbin, the man Carl Jung, Tillich, Barfield, is there, can you describe,</p>
<p>this might be challenging, but one powerful idea from each that jumps to mind?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Maybe Heidegger?</p>
<p>So for Heidegger, one real powerful idea that has had a huge influence on me, he&rsquo;s had a</p>
<p>huge influence on me in many ways.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big influence on what&rsquo;s called 4E Cognitive Science.</p>
<p>And this whole idea about the nonpropositional, that was deeply afforded by Heidegger and</p>
<p>Marla Ponti.</p>
<p>But I guess maybe the one idea, if I had to pick one, is his critique of ontotheology,</p>
<p>his critique of the attempt to understand being in terms of a supreme being, something</p>
<p>like that, and how that gets us fundamentally messed up and we get disconnected from being</p>
<p>because we are overfocused on particular beings.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re failing to love wisely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re loving the individual things and we&rsquo;re not loving the ground from which they spring.</p>
<p>Can you explain that a little more?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between the being and the supreme being and why that gets us into</p>
<p>trouble?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, well, we talked about this before, the supreme being is a particular being, whereas</p>
<p>being is no thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not any particular kind of thing.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re thinking of being as a being, you&rsquo;re thinking of it in a thingy way about</p>
<p>something that is fundamentally no thingness.</p>
<p>And so then you&rsquo;re disconnecting yourself from presumably ultimate reality.</p>
<p>This takes me to Tillich.</p>
<p>Tillich&rsquo;s great idea is understanding faith as ultimate concern rather than a set of propositions</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re asserting, right?</p>
<p>So what are you ultimately concerned about?</p>
<p>What do you want to be in right relationship to, ratio religio?</p>
<p>And is that ultimate?</p>
<p>Is that the ultimate reality that you conceive of?</p>
<p>Are those two things in sync?</p>
<p>This has had a profound influence on me and I think it&rsquo;s a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>So some of the others, how do they integrate?</p>
<p>Maybe this is Carl Jung and Freud.</p>
<p>Which team are you on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on Jung.</p>
<p>Freud is the better writer, but Jung has, I think, a model of the psyche that is closer</p>
<p>to where cognitive science is heading.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s more prescient.</p>
<p>Which aspect of his model of the psyche?</p>
<p>Directly.</p>
<p>So Freud has a hydraulic model.</p>
<p>The psyche is like a steam engine.</p>
<p>Things are under pressure and there&rsquo;s a fluid that&rsquo;s moving around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, like this is a record note of this.</p>
<p>Jung has an organic model.</p>
<p>The psyche is like a living being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing all this opponent processing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing all of this self transcending and growing.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a much better model of the psyche than the sort of steam engine model.</p>
<p>What do you think about their view of the subconscious mind?</p>
<p>What do you think their view and your own view of what&rsquo;s going on there in the shadow?</p>
<p>So all bad stuff, some good stuff, any stuff at all?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, both Freud and Jung are only talking about the psychodynamic unconscious,</p>
<p>which is only a small part of the unconscious.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on the psychodynamic?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about the aspects of the unconscious that have to do with your sort of ego development</p>
<p>and how you are understanding and interpreting yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the unconscious that allows you to turn the noise coming out of my face hole</p>
<p>into ideas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the unconscious that says, yeah, all that stuff, which is huge and powerful.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t think about that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re focused on the big romantic stuff that you have to deal with through psychotherapy,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Which is relevant and important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not dismissing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it doesn&rsquo;t exist, but it&rsquo;s certainly not all of the unconscious.</p>
<p>A lot of work that&rsquo;s going on, my colleague and deep friend, Anderson Todd is about, can</p>
<p>we take the Jungian stuff and the cognitive science stuff and can we integrate it together</p>
<p>theoretically?</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s working on that, exactly that project.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, your sense is there is a subconscious.</p>
<p>Or at least an unconscious.</p>
<p>I like the term unconscious.</p>
<p>And Jung continually reminded people that the unconscious is unconscious, that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not conscious of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s its fundamental property.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then isn&rsquo;t the task of therapy then to bring, to make the unconscious conscious?</p>
<p>Yeah, to a degree, right?</p>
<p>But also, I mean, yeah, to bring consciousness where there was unconscious is part of Jung&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mythos.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also not the thought that that can be completed.</p>
<p>Part of why you&rsquo;re extending the reach of the conscious mind is it so it can enter into</p>
<p>a more proper dialogical relationship with the self organizing system of the unconscious</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>What did they have to say about the motivations of humans?</p>
<p>So for Freud, jokingly, I said, you know, sex, so much of our mind is developed in our</p>
<p>young age, sexual interactions with the world or whatever, hence the thing about the edible</p>
<p>complex and all, you know, I wanted to have sex with your mother.</p>
<p>What do you think about their description about what motivates humans?</p>
<p>And what do you think about the will to power from Nietzsche?</p>
<p>Which camp are you in there?</p>
<p>What motivates humans?</p>
<p>Sex or power?</p>
<p>I think Plato is right.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a connection for me.</p>
<p>Plato&rsquo;s my first philosopher, Jung&rsquo;s my first psychologist, and Jung is very much the Plato</p>
<p>of the psyche.</p>
<p>You never forget your first.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You never do.</p>
<p>And I think we have, I reject the monological mind, I reject the monophasic mind model.</p>
<p>I think we are multi centered.</p>
<p>I think we have different centers of motivation that operate according to different principles</p>
<p>to satisfy different problems, and that part of the task of our humanity is to get those</p>
<p>different centers into some internal culture by which they are optimally cooperating rather</p>
<p>than in conflict with each other.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people today?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in high school trying to figure out what they&rsquo;re going to do with their life.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re in college.</p>
<p>What advice would you give how to have a career they can be proud of or how to have a life</p>
<p>they can be proud of?</p>
<p>So the first thing is find an ecology of practices and a community that supports them without</p>
<p>involving you in believing things that contravene our best understood science so that wisdom</p>
<p>and virtue, especially how they show up in relationships, are primary to you.</p>
<p>This will sound ridiculous, but if you take care of that, the other things you want are</p>
<p>more likely to occur.</p>
<p>Because what you want at when you&rsquo;re approaching your death is what were the relationships</p>
<p>you cultivated to yourself, to other people, to the world, and what did you do to improve</p>
<p>the chance of them being deep and profound relationships?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting ecology of practice, finding a place where a lot of people are</p>
<p>doing different things that are interesting interplay with each other, but at the same</p>
<p>time is not a cult where ideas can flourish.</p>
<p>How the hell do you know?</p>
<p>Because in a place where people are really excited about doing stuff, that&rsquo;s very ripe</p>
<p>for cult formation.</p>
<p>Especially if they&rsquo;re awash in a culture in which we have ever expanding waves of bullshit.</p>
<p>Yes, precisely.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Try to keep away from the bullshit is the advice.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I take this very seriously and I was with a bunch of people in Vermont at</p>
<p>the respond retreat, people, Rafe Kelly was there, a bunch of people who have set up ecologies</p>
<p>of practices and created communities.</p>
<p>And I have good reason to find all of these people trustworthy.</p>
<p>And so we gathered together to try and generate real dialogos, flow in distributed cognition,</p>
<p>exercise the collective intelligence, and try and address that problem, both in terms</p>
<p>of metachurriculum that we can offer emerging communities, in terms of practices of vetting,</p>
<p>how we will self govern the federation we&rsquo;re forming so that we can resist gurufication.</p>
<p>Gurufication of people or ideas?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>Some of us just get unlucky.</p>
<p>Some of us get unlucky and we all at respond, we all had a tremendous sense of urgency around</p>
<p>this, but we were trying to balance it about not being premature, but there was going to,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re going to produce a metachurriculum that&rsquo;s coming in months, there&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be a scientific paper about integrating the scientific work on wisdom with this practitioner</p>
<p>based ideas about the cultivation of wisdom, there&rsquo;s going to be projects about how we</p>
<p>can create a self correcting vetting system so we can say to people, we think this ecology</p>
<p>is legit, it&rsquo;s in good fellowship with all these other legit ecologies, we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that one, we&rsquo;re hesitant about that one, it&rsquo;s not in good fellowship, we have</p>
<p>concerns, here&rsquo;s why we have our concerns, et cetera.</p>
<p>And you may say, well, who are you to do that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like nobody, but somebody&rsquo;s got to do it, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it comes down to, and so we&rsquo;re going to give it our best effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth a try.</p>
<p>You talked about the meaning crisis in human civilization, but in your own personal life,</p>
<p>what has been a dark place you&rsquo;ve ever gone in your mind?</p>
<p>Has there been difficult times in your life where you&rsquo;ve really struggled?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So when I left fundamentalist Christianity, and for a while I was just sort of a hard</p>
<p>bitten atheist, the problem with leaving the belief structure was that I didn&rsquo;t deal with</p>
<p>all the nonpropositional things that had gotten into me, all the procedures and habits and</p>
<p>all the perspectives and all the identities and the trauma associated with that.</p>
<p>So I required therapy, it required years of meditation and Tai Chi, and I&rsquo;m still wrestling</p>
<p>with it, but for the first four or five years, I would&hellip; I described it like this, I called</p>
<p>it the black burning.</p>
<p>I felt like there was a blackness that was on fire inside of me, precisely because the</p>
<p>religion had left a taste for the transcendent in my mouth, but it had&hellip; The food it had</p>
<p>given me, food in square quotes, had soured in my stomach and made me nauseous, and the</p>
<p>juxtaposition of those seemed like an irresolvable problem for me.</p>
<p>That was a very, very dark time for me.</p>
<p>Did it feel lonely?</p>
<p>When it was very bad, it felt extremely lonely and deeply alienating.</p>
<p>The universe seemed absurd, and there was also existential anxiety.</p>
<p>I talk about these things for a reason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just talk about them as things I&rsquo;m pointing to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about them as seeing in myself and in people I care, having undergone them</p>
<p>and how they can bring you close to self destructive&hellip; I started engaging in kinds of self destructive</p>
<p>behavior.</p>
<p>So the meaning crisis to you is not just the thing you look outside and see many people</p>
<p>struggling.</p>
<p>You yourself have struggled.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, in fact, the narrative, is I struggled with it, thinking it was a purely personal,</p>
<p>idiosyncratic thing.</p>
<p>I started learning the kog sai, I started doing the tai chi and the meditation, I started</p>
<p>doing all this Socratic philosophy.</p>
<p>And when I started to talk about these pieces, I saw my students eyes light up, and I realized,</p>
<p>wait, maybe this isn&rsquo;t just something I&rsquo;m going through.</p>
<p>And talking to them and then doing the research and expanding it out, it&rsquo;s like, oh, many</p>
<p>people in a shared fashion and also in an individual lonely fashion are going through</p>
<p>meaning crisis.</p>
<p>Well, we talked a lot about wisdom and meaning, and you said that the goal is to love wisely.</p>
<p>So let me ask about love.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love in the human condition?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s central.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s even central to reason and rationality.</p>
<p>This is Plato, but Spinoza, the most logical of the rationalists.</p>
<p>The ethics is written like Euclid&rsquo;s geometry, but he calls it the ethics for a reason, because</p>
<p>he wants to talk about the blessed life.</p>
<p>And what does he say?</p>
<p>He says that ultimately reason needs love, because love is what brings reason out of</p>
<p>being entrapped in the gravity well of egocentrism.</p>
<p>And Murdoch, Iris Murdoch said, I think really beautifully, love is when you painfully realize</p>
<p>that something other than yourself is real.</p>
<p>Escaping the gravity well of egocentrism.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>A beautiful way to end it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re a beautiful human being.</p>
<p>Thank you for struggling in your own mind with the search for meaning and encouraging</p>
<p>others to do the same.</p>
<p>And ultimately to learn how to love wisely.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a great pleasure, Lex.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it a lot.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jon Verweke.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Hermann Hesse in Siddhartha.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed, and I still believe, that whatever good or bad fortune may come</p>
<p>our way, we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
