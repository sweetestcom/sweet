    <p>I want to play the theme music for this episode. Okay. Hold on one second. Here we go.</p>
<p>If you let the Indian government plant spies in your office, give a little whistle.</p>
<p>If you have too many bots, you can come up with your own metric. MDAUs. MDAUs.</p>
<p>When you want to incent your staff to not look at the bots, give them bonuses based on DAOs.</p>
<p>Based on DAOs.</p>
<p>Always let your bonus be your guide.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on the board and you see metrics that you don&rsquo;t like, turn a blind eye.</p>
<p>Turn a blind eye.</p>
<p>Sorry. Sorry. Oh, I just got subpoenaed.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s getting subpoenaed again.</p>
<p>This is J. Cal at his best.</p>
<p>You gotta stop.</p>
<p>This is going to be the story of 2022 for sure. Right before, I guess the big case between</p>
<p>Elon and Twitter is about to happen, I guess in October at some point, a Twitter whistleblower</p>
<p>has come forward and dropped a nuke into the middle of what was basically the story of the</p>
<p>year in business. I think the former head of security hired by Jack himself, and incredibly</p>
<p>well respected Peter Mudge, that co he&rsquo;s referred to as Mudge, one of the most respected people in</p>
<p>the security industry, again, recruited by Jack in 2020. After a team of hackers, you may remember,</p>
<p>took over all these verified accounts, Obama, Biden, and any lines account as well. And he was</p>
<p>head of security until January of this year, eight months ago. And he claims, through explosive</p>
<p>documents, a huge document dump that Twitter execs ignored, these Twitter executives ignored</p>
<p>multiple security vulnerabilities. Now, why is this important? Well, obviously, if Obama, Biden</p>
<p>and other heads of state have their Twitter handles, they could say something that could</p>
<p>cause an international incident. And that&rsquo;s actually happened with hacks before. He also</p>
<p>says they were not following even the most basic security protocols like safeguarding staff access</p>
<p>to core software. Of course, all this comes after there were Saudi infiltrator spies essentially</p>
<p>inside of Twitter. I mean, the list of things here that he is alleging is truly colossal. He dumped</p>
<p>these documents to the Department of Justice, the SEC, Congress and the Washington Post. He</p>
<p>alleges that the vulnerabilities make Twitter extremely vulnerable to foreign spies hacking</p>
<p>and disinformation campaigns. And perhaps most importantly to the acquisition, the complaint</p>
<p>also adds that Twitter&rsquo;s policy towards fake accounts incentivize quote, deliberate ignorance</p>
<p>by under counting spam accounts and giving bonuses to execs for increasing users but not finding</p>
<p>bots. sacks your thoughts. I mean, on this, we talked about your subpoena or whatever that was.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a subpoena. I&rsquo;m being depositioned. It&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re having a deposition. Yeah, they want</p>
<p>to they want to depo depo me too, which is kind of amazing. But let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s save that because I</p>
<p>think this is more more newsworthy. So you&rsquo;ll recall on a previous show, we talked about this</p>
<p>idea that if Twitter sues Elon to go after the kill fee or to go after damages, the question</p>
<p>will very rapidly become about whether Twitter has a bot problem and will discovery reveal</p>
<p>documents that show that Twitter executives knew or should have known there was a problem.</p>
<p>And so I said, you know, the question will very rapidly become what did Twitter executives know,</p>
<p>and when did they know it? Now, I couldn&rsquo;t have predicted that this whistleblower would come</p>
<p>forward. But what he&rsquo;s basically saying is not only is there a bot problem, there&rsquo;s a cover up</p>
<p>of the bot problem. He&rsquo;s accusing the company of positively Nixonian tactics here. So just to build</p>
<p>on what you said, Jay cow, he said that Twitter executives don&rsquo;t have the resources to fully</p>
<p>understand the true number of bots in the platform. And their executives are disincentivized</p>
<p>to count them properly, because doing so would negatively affect their bonuses. So I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that their bonuses were in any way tied to, to this bot issue. So he&rsquo;s basically he&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>the Upton Sinclair argument that it&rsquo;s hard to get a man to understand a problem when his salary</p>
<p>depends on not understanding it. So that&rsquo;s part of what he&rsquo;s saying. He&rsquo;s also saying that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>accusing Twitter CEO Prague Agarwal directly, let&rsquo;s just say these are allegations, right? These are</p>
<p>not proven yet. But here&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s saying. Basically, he&rsquo;s saying that Prague and his</p>
<p>lieutenants repeatedly discouraged him from providing a full accounting of Twitter security</p>
<p>problems to the company&rsquo;s board of directors. They basically prevented him from producing a</p>
<p>written report. He also says that the company&rsquo;s executives ordered him to knowingly present</p>
<p>cherry picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent</p>
<p>cybersecurity issues. He also alleges that they went behind his back to have a third party consulting</p>
<p>firm, their report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company&rsquo;s problems. And as a result</p>
<p>of this, he&rsquo;s basically saying that Twitter executives committed securities law violations</p>
<p>by making material misrepresentations and omissions, and SEC filings. And this is what got</p>
<p>Elon to to sort of commemorate Zacco&rsquo;s revelations with one of his trademark memes, which was the</p>
<p>meme of Jiminy Cricket singing, give a little whistle from the film Pinocchio, which I think</p>
<p>is a cold open, which just became a cold open. So yeah, look, these are very serious allegations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not proven yet. He&rsquo;s working with the same group who worked with Francis Hagen. And</p>
<p>I certainly questioned some of the things she was saying. So I&rsquo;m not going to automatically</p>
<p>accept on faith everything he&rsquo;s saying. But I think by the same token, because he&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>with groups that back Francis Hagen, who was very much not on the free speech side</p>
<p>of this debate. I also think you can&rsquo;t just accuse this guy being an Elon Stooge.</p>
<p>This guy is a respected cybersecurity authority. He&rsquo;s one of these like white hat hackers. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>somebody who was an early hack. Literally, if you were to ask before all of this before he worked</p>
<p>at Twitter, like, who would you want as your chief security officer, you know, give me a short list,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be on it for any company, right? One of the most respected people who points out vulnerabilities</p>
<p>or free burger have a question about corporate governance. And what seems to be a dysfunctional</p>
<p>relationship here, you have jack hire somebody to solve the security problems, then when presenting</p>
<p>to the board, he&rsquo;s not allowed to tell the truth. And they, the board has given incentives to the</p>
<p>management team, he&rsquo;s a top five, top seven member of the management team. So what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>with this dysfunction where he&rsquo;s hired to tell the truth, to fix the problems, the board is turning</p>
<p>a blind eye to it. And maybe the management team is not giving the board the data they need to make</p>
<p>better decisions. Who? How do you game theory this? Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s you can come to all</p>
<p>those conclusions. Yeah, I&rsquo;m not coming to the conclusion. I&rsquo;m just my mind is wandering of how</p>
<p>this I read the red comes up. Yeah, I read parts of of his whistleblower. I can&rsquo;t claim to have</p>
<p>read at all. It actually isn&rsquo;t super supportive of Ilan&rsquo;s case. The most problematic thing that</p>
<p>he points out is the following. And this is a quote from his complaint. He said Twitter quote,</p>
<p>already doing a decent job excluding spam bots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of</p>
<p>MDO. At best, he&rsquo;s alleging that Twitter omitted details, not that it lied directly. So if you</p>
<p>kind of take that, I think what he&rsquo;s really pointing his sights on are, as you said,</p>
<p>disclosures that have nothing to do with the spam issue, but have a lot to do with security.</p>
<p>And that is something that typically in a in a public company board filters up through the audit</p>
<p>committee typically that gets a readout, right once a quarter from the rep from the right people</p>
<p>who talk about, here&rsquo;s our cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. And then there is a readout</p>
<p>from that committee chair to the board. And then those are noted in your quarterly</p>
<p>in your quarterly reports that the secretary writes down. So I think part of why this guy</p>
<p>may not have had the audience is, it was also written that he was a pretty terrible manager.</p>
<p>And there were hundreds of people in his organization who were just kind of running</p>
<p>here and there. And so you know, you guys have all been in the situation where we hire somebody</p>
<p>who is an exceptional performer. And then we miscast that person by putting them in a point</p>
<p>of leadership, and being a team manager versus, you know, a single kind of like, product or</p>
<p>engineering expert. And it seems that there was a part of that at play as well, which decayed the</p>
<p>ability for management to actually have enough faith and trust in this guy to put them in front</p>
<p>of the board. So and that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s just come up in the last few days. So I don&rsquo;t know my, my</p>
<p>reading of the whistleblower claim is really that this is the kind of thing that companies like</p>
<p>Facebook and Google and others have had issues with the FTC in the past. They typically settle</p>
<p>those claims, they pay a fine snap. But those things take three to five years to play out. So</p>
<p>I suspect that this body of content more leads to that outcome, then is a smoking gun that really</p>
<p>helps Ilan. In fact, this, the fact that he&rsquo;s actually affirmatively stating that their calculation</p>
<p>of MDO is actually pretty decent, actually hurts the claim that Ilan is making.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I agree with that, actually.</p>
<p>Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>So I agree with with Chamath that the claims he&rsquo;s making are far broader than the bot issue,</p>
<p>and far broader than the issues that Ilan&rsquo;s raised. So I agree with you about that, Chamath. However,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree that what he&rsquo;s saying isn&rsquo;t specifically helpful to Ilan&rsquo;s case. So what</p>
<p>he said is, so this is from a CNN business article, he said, Zacco&rsquo;s disclosure argues</p>
<p>that by reporting bots only as a percentage of MDAO, rather than as a percentage of total number</p>
<p>of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the</p>
<p>service, a move Zacco alleges is deliberately misleading. And then</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying here, Saks, just to do the math, the denominator matters here,</p>
<p>if the denominator was all accounts, the percentage of bots would be much higher.</p>
<p>If the denominator is monthly MDAOs, whatever they created, it would be a much lower denominator.</p>
<p>And the percentage would change, I think is what I&rsquo;m just reporting what what CNN is reporting in</p>
<p>terms of what Zacco&rsquo;s alleging, I just want to get it on the table. CNN broke the story along with</p>
<p>one other news, Washington Post, Washington Post. Yeah, basically, what happened is this guy got</p>
<p>fired in January and started working with these whistleblower lawyers, they put together a big</p>
<p>report. And then that report got leaked to the Washington Post, and CNN as well as people on</p>
<p>Capitol Hill. So that&rsquo;s kind of what happened here. So CNN goes on to say, Zacco says he began</p>
<p>asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>head of site integrity, that the company didn&rsquo;t know how many total bots are on its platform.</p>
<p>He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team, with the understanding</p>
<p>that the company had, quote, no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,</p>
<p>end quote, in part, because if the true number became public, it could harm the company&rsquo;s value</p>
<p>and image. So this is, again, the up in Sinclair problem that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at a minimum, David, you have to agree, this guy is basically speaking on both sides of his mouth.</p>
<p>I mean, these are both direct quotes from his complaint. So his complaint, at best is very</p>
<p>confusing and a little schizophrenic. Well, it&rsquo;s also just coming out. So there&rsquo;ll be more data</p>
<p>that that comes by the way, I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not saying that I believe him or disbelieve him. But I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying if you if you look at the quotes, the quotes aren&rsquo;t the smoking gun one would want.</p>
<p>If one was trying to look, I think we have to remember the the lawsuit has really nothing</p>
<p>to do with this problem. The lawsuit really boils down to one very specific clause,</p>
<p>which is the pinnacle question at hand, which is there is a specific performance</p>
<p>clause that Elon signed up to, right, which, you know, his lawyers could have struck out</p>
<p>and either chose not to or, you know, couldn&rsquo;t get the deal done without. And that specific</p>
<p>performance clause says that Twitter can force him to close at 5420 a share. And I think the</p>
<p>issue at hand at the Delaware Business Court is going to be that because Twitter is going to point</p>
<p>to all of these, you know, gotchas and disclaimers that they have around this bot issue as their</p>
<p>cover story. And I think that really, you know, this kind of, again, builds more and more momentum</p>
<p>in my mind that the most likely outcome here is a settlement where you have to pay the economic</p>
<p>difference between where the stock is now and 5420, which is more than a billion dollars,</p>
<p>or you close at some number below $54 and 20 cents a share. And I think that that is like,</p>
<p>you know, if you had to be a betting person, that&rsquo;s probably and if you look at them,</p>
<p>the way the stock is traded, and if you also look at the way the options market trades,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people are assuming that there&rsquo;s a seven to $10 billion swing. And if you impute</p>
<p>that into the stock price, you kind of get into the $51 a share kind of an acquisition price.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying that that is right or should be right. That&rsquo;s just sort of what the market</p>
<p>says. Friedberg, what&rsquo;s your take on this? Do you find this person credible, highly credible? And</p>
<p>how damaging do you think this is to Twitter, independent of the deal to sell the company?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s two tests. One is the materiality of what they&rsquo;ve reported. So</p>
<p>and really, that comes down to just the endow reported numbers. So if there really is some</p>
<p>misstatement, knowing misstatement based on what he&rsquo;s saying, that&rsquo;s an issue. The other one is the</p>
<p>duty of care, responsibility of the board, meaning did the information that he&rsquo;s providing</p>
<p>actually find its way to the board? If it was blocked by management, you know, it&rsquo;s a judgment</p>
<p>call on, you know, whether or not management was trying to deceive or whether they were trying to</p>
<p>investigate and identify more. If the information was brought to the board, and the board did not</p>
<p>act, then there&rsquo;s an issue with the boards meeting their duty of care responsibility as fiduciaries</p>
<p>of the company. And that&rsquo;s really what he did pitch the board at some point or explain this,</p>
<p>but not in writing. Yeah, if what he&rsquo;s claiming did not make its way to the board,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s hard to say that the board was in breach of their duty of care. If the CEO and if the if</p>
<p>the CEO blocked it, then there&rsquo;s a question on what then the CEO can be fired, right, then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good case for the CEO to be fired. I see. So I see, you know, probably one of three scenarios</p>
<p>here. One is, you know, nothing happens to is that the board is actually violating their which</p>
<p>I doubt knowing this board. I mean, knowing who&rsquo;s on this board, it&rsquo;s probably more likely that the</p>
<p>CEO or some executives that block this information from getting to the board, the board then has to</p>
<p>act now that they have the information. And they say, hey, you block this information from getting</p>
<p>to us, we need to act. And maybe they removed the leadership that was responsible for that.</p>
<p>sex in terms of board governments, how much of this has to do with the fact that nobody really</p>
<p>owned on the board any significant equity in Twitter? Is that true?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think I mean, on the board was the highest, right? He owned two or 3%.</p>
<p>How much did silver Lake on jack on silver Lake e guns on the board? I mean, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>their owners on the board, right? board? Yeah, we&rsquo;re low.</p>
<p>To be clear, Zacko doesn&rsquo;t seem to be pointing his finger at the board. In fact, quite the contrary,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to present to the board in the amount of detail that he wanted in</p>
<p>written form like he wanted. So in a way, he seems to be exonerating the board, he is pointing</p>
<p>the finger at Twitter executives. And the timeline here is instructive. Basically,</p>
<p>what happened is he was hired by Jack Dorsey back when Jack was CEO. This is in, I think,</p>
<p>November of 2020. And at that time, Jack had Zacko report directly to him. He actually took</p>
<p>responsibility away from these issues away from Prague, who was running engineering,</p>
<p>gave it to Zacko, Zacko reported directly to him. Now fast forward about a year later.</p>
<p>And Jack steps down, Prague&rsquo;s become CEO. And then two months later, Prague fires</p>
<p>Zacko. And it&rsquo;s in that time period, that couple of months, where Zacko alleges that he&rsquo;s prevented</p>
<p>from providing a written report to the board that Twitter executives instruct him to cherry pick</p>
<p>that they basically tried to amend this third party consulting firm&rsquo;s report in order to make</p>
<p>the situation look better in order to hide the extent of the company&rsquo;s problems. So I think this</p>
<p>is I think the allegations as far as they go, are mainly a problem for Twitter executives. And look,</p>
<p>I you know, I don&rsquo;t know the truth. These things are just allegations. I think this guy is a</p>
<p>respected super sort of white hat hacker in the cyber community. At the same time, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe is a bad manager. Maybe there are other reasons for removing him could be a bad manager.</p>
<p>Yeah. And you can&rsquo;t ignore the fact that under whistleblower laws,</p>
<p>if Twitter gets fined as a result of these allegations, he could get 30%. So listen,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know the truth of it. However, I do think that this whole thing is a windfall for Elon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case. Because it does seem to provide substantiation for Elon&rsquo;s assertion that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bot prom at Twitter now and a cover up about it. And a cover up about exactly. Yes. And a cover up</p>
<p>that would basically potentially invalidate the company&rsquo;s SEC disclosures on the subject.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question of law and a question of fact, with regard to Elon&rsquo;s case. So in other words,</p>
<p>at the end of the day, what they&rsquo;re going to be litigating in Delaware is a contract dispute is</p>
<p>Elon contractually required to close. And Elon&rsquo;s assertion is I&rsquo;m not because this bot issue. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a question of law where if everything Elon says about the bots is true, is he required</p>
<p>to close and I don&rsquo;t know what the legal ramifications that are. But I think with respect</p>
<p>to the question of fact, which is, is Elon right about the bot issue? There&rsquo;s no question that this</p>
<p>is a bombshell that can only help his case. By the way, to your point, the the stock was</p>
<p>kind of pricing in a 70% likelihood of this thing closing, if you looked at just how all this stuff</p>
<p>was trading, and it went down to 60%. Once that whistleblower report came out, and people had a</p>
<p>chance to digest it. So to your point, it definitely moved the goalposts a little bit</p>
<p>towards toward in Elon&rsquo;s favor. There is a you know, an important thing to point out here,</p>
<p>which sex just touched on, there is a whistleblower program that was created in 2012.</p>
<p>And by the SEC, as part of Dodd-Frank, I believe, or in part of the evolution of Dodd-Frank.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve given out now over $1 billion in whistleblower awards, these awards come out</p>
<p>of the SEC fine. So you often wonder, like, hey, they give this huge SCC fine, who got it?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out whistleblowers now are massively incented. Because if you&rsquo;re a whistleblower,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a career ending, potentially, Jason, you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not saying the other part, which is,</p>
<p>when you go to these organizations to now help develop a whistleblower lawsuit,</p>
<p>what has actually happened is you&rsquo;re not whistleblowing, moral or ethical breaches,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re whistleblowing things that can come back to an issue that the SEC and the FTC can make</p>
<p>an issue of because that&rsquo;s where the financial fines come. And that&rsquo;s where their remuneration</p>
<p>and motivation. So for example, like you could have a company that&rsquo;s illegally, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>killing dogs to horrible. But, you know, the whistleblower claim will be about,</p>
<p>you know, their disclosures in a 10k of how many dogs they killed to the SEC, right? In this case,</p>
<p>you know, how many what did they tell the Yeah. And that&rsquo;s why he gave this to the SEC DOJ. The</p>
<p>other interesting wrinkle here. And by the way, there&rsquo;s been to the whistleblower program, I</p>
<p>did a bunch of reading on it this week. They also don&rsquo;t disclose who the whistleblowers are. So this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a case where you have to come out like Francis did, or much did you, a lot of these</p>
<p>awards are being given quietly. So there&rsquo;s been two rewards over $100 million. And they don&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>what the award was based on, you know, who did who the whistleblower is, or who the company is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been doing this in a very stealthy way. And it seems to be highly effective. The big</p>
<p>difference, I think, with Francis, compared to this one is Francis, just a PM, you know, who</p>
<p>was not a top five or 10 employee, not even close to that. This is a top five, top seven employee</p>
<p>who had access to the board and was giving reports to the board, at least orally. The final</p>
<p>point on this, I would like to get everybody&rsquo;s commentary on if it is true, that they essentially</p>
<p>were forced Twitter was forced by the Indian government to put a government agent on the</p>
<p>payroll. I think agent means spy. How explosive is that? And then how many that to me,</p>
<p>that to me is the most important thing that is not getting nearly enough coverage. It&rsquo;s like you had</p>
<p>a government come to a company that&rsquo;s based in America. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not the United States</p>
<p>government that did it. And basically said, we need you to place an agent of our intelligence</p>
<p>services inside of your company. And it seems like they were like, okay, where do you want them to</p>
<p>sit? Now, sax, if that&rsquo;s true, with I wonder if they would be required to tell the CIA and our</p>
<p>government that their arms being twisted. Like, this seems unprecedented to me. And if they didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>well, I think, again, this is all alleged. So but if I do sacks, what I think the bigger button</p>
<p>over Jason, you should also ask the next one, which is if they did it to Twitter, which is</p>
<p>kind of small. What about the big honeypots of users? Google, Apple, Google, Facebook,</p>
<p>tick tock, snap. And what about countries outside of just India? What about the United States?</p>
<p>No, I mean, what about the United States? Well, yeah, we have access to the stuff,</p>
<p>you know, through the courts, there&rsquo;s supposed to be a process, there&rsquo;s supposed to be the</p>
<p>processes, you go to court, and you get a warrant, not that it&rsquo;s a high bar, but a prosecutor has to</p>
<p>go show probable cause and get a search warrant presented to the company. And then they turn over</p>
<p>the data. This you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s explosive, in the sense that what they&rsquo;re saying is that these</p>
<p>government agents, this is what Zacco says, according to Time magazine, the purported</p>
<p>agents had direct unsupervised access to internal information. So it means DMS, when the accounts</p>
<p>are created, who owned which account the IP addresses, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m guessing. They had</p>
<p>access to which is you do not want to trust I&rsquo;m guessing, I&rsquo;m guessing what I&rsquo;m putting in your</p>
<p>DMS, folks, I&rsquo;m guessing what it doesn&rsquo;t mean is the Twitter menu in the cafeteria. Yeah, no.</p>
<p>Not that I mean, not that anybody&rsquo;s been to that cafeteria in three years. Anyway, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s literally $47. They had direct unsupervised access to the salad bar.</p>
<p>I think, I think, you know, basically, I think you could you have to make an assumption that</p>
<p>if, if governments are doing this to one company, they&rsquo;re doing it to all companies.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you would think, right? No, but Google would put up a fight or Apple would put up a fight.</p>
<p>But who knows? You think they really fight when they went into China?</p>
<p>The opposite? Don&rsquo;t you think they do the opposite?</p>
<p>Well, actually, what they did was there&rsquo;s actually even sneaker way to do it. What Apple did when</p>
<p>they went there is they said, we&rsquo;re not providing cloud services in China. But all the cloud services</p>
<p>are provided by this third party company. So then they could have plausible that that&rsquo;s not what</p>
<p>this is about. This is about an example of how you this is I understand, but I&rsquo;m asking you a</p>
<p>question. Do you think that foreign governments have put pressure on the largest American tech</p>
<p>companies to place agents? And do you think they exist in there?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve definitely put to the first part, they&rsquo;ve definitely put pressure, we see that obviously,</p>
<p>then the question is, would our would the would Apple or Google do this and not inform the</p>
<p>government or not put up a fight? I don&rsquo;t know. Well, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that the</p>
<p>the Senate Intelligence Committee is going to hold Twitter and have like a closed door meeting.</p>
<p>And then the question is, you know, will they haul everybody else in and is just is I think what</p>
<p>is what is an important question is, is this a derriere kind of business tactic at the highest</p>
<p>levels of every company? And we just don&rsquo;t know it and are typically not read into it. And we</p>
<p>would never know in the absence of this whistleblower thing. And my question is, do does</p>
<p>our government know that our companies are acquiescing to these governments?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s been a problem for a long time, actually. So there was a op ed by a Microsoft</p>
<p>executive talking about this a number of months back where the argument was, well, the government</p>
<p>has to go get a search warrant to get your data from these companies, but these companies don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>put up a fight like they don&rsquo;t. They don&rsquo;t challenge the warrant at all. And why? Because</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have an interest. They have an interest in being cooperative, right? The</p>
<p>article is basically saying that if you&rsquo;re the subject of a search warrant, meaning they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to Google to get information about Jason, the government should have a duty to inform Jason</p>
<p>so that your lawyers can go challenge it. And that was the legal change that needed to be made.</p>
<p>We had this conversation, I think, last year. That is a change that should be made because</p>
<p>in the old days when the government would present you with a search warrant, they&rsquo;d have to go to</p>
<p>you because all of your documents were in your possession. They would be at your office, they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be at your house, so they would come knocking on your door, give you the search warrant. You</p>
<p>could give it to your lawyer, they could challenge it. That doesn&rsquo;t happen anymore. Now the government</p>
<p>just goes and gives a search warrant to a big tech company because your data is in the cloud,</p>
<p>but their argument is you don&rsquo;t own that data, the big tech company does. The big tech company</p>
<p>has no incentive to fight the government, and they just get access to all of your data,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even know that you&rsquo;re being investigated. It&rsquo;s not an argument. You agree</p>
<p>to that when you sign their terms of service. Yeah. The current situation is bad enough that</p>
<p>essentially you have very little protection and rights over your data. But what&rsquo;s happening here,</p>
<p>the allegation is even worse, which is that government operatives are working with the</p>
<p>company in a way that provides them access without them even getting a search warrant.</p>
<p>Yeah, they always buy on their ex girlfriend, their, you know, brother in law, whoever,</p>
<p>they can just spy on a celebrity, do whatever they want. I&rsquo;d always, I&rsquo;d always assumed that</p>
<p>this was happening covertly, meaning like, look, if you&rsquo;re a tech company, and, you know, you have</p>
<p>a very bright, I don&rsquo;t know, PhD on a visa, and you hire that person to work in computer vision,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just making this up. How do you really know that that person is not an agent of another</p>
<p>foreign country? And obviously, the overwhelming majority are not. But once you have hundreds or</p>
<p>1000s of people, you know that that you brought into your company, all it takes is one person,</p>
<p>you know, for example, we just saw, I think, in Apple, there were two people that were just</p>
<p>recently arrested for stealing all of Apple&rsquo;s autonomous auto data and documents and design</p>
<p>schematics and all of that stuff. And one of the guys was arrested right before he was trying to</p>
<p>fly back to China. And so somehow they figured it out, they were able to get him he was not a US</p>
<p>citizen. But then another guy that did it was a US citizen, but both were of Chinese origin,</p>
<p>it just goes to show you that the covert nature of industrial espionage is probably at an all time</p>
<p>high, right. And I think that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a risk that every company has to manage and do the best</p>
<p>that they can. But this is different. This is an overt risk. This is just an overture and saying,</p>
<p>open the door, give us a badge, we&rsquo;re coming in. And this is why I think you have to deal with this</p>
<p>case very delicately in a different way. Yeah. And for people who don&rsquo;t know, Google does what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the transparency report. Twitter also has one. So they do try to put out by category search</p>
<p>warrants, subpoenas, etc. Exactly how many warrants they&rsquo;re getting. And the tech companies are at</p>
<p>least trying to be transparent about it to the extent they can. But this is going to lead to a</p>
<p>lot of people moving off of the cloud, I predict, we&rsquo;re seeing. And in fact, Apple is now storing</p>
<p>your data, and a lot of your privacy information locally on your phone. And if it&rsquo;s encrypted,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t hand it over, as we saw with the terrorist shooting, and it was at San Bernardino,</p>
<p>where they couldn&rsquo;t unlock the phone, and they went to the Israeli spy company to do it. So</p>
<p>you know, I think I think the companies here, at least in the United States want to defend their</p>
<p>users. But this is could be make people rethink the cloud. And I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of pitches from</p>
<p>startups. I think you&rsquo;re confusing issues. Of course, they&rsquo;re going to try to defend their</p>
<p>users in the United States. But what if you have if you let somebody into a different country? And</p>
<p>that? Oh, yeah. It&rsquo;s not as if it&rsquo;s not as if servers are not accessible. Yeah, I&rsquo;m not confusing</p>
<p>the job. I&rsquo;m just talking about the United States here for a minute. I do think you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>people buy many servers to put or rent their own cloud services that are encrypted and impossible</p>
<p>to unlock. And so look for that trend to come or more companies to encrypt it and say, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the keys to map. So isn&rsquo;t it crazy that like, you know, we spent the last 20 years pushing the</p>
<p>cloud and the thing that may actually unwind the cloud is just the utter lack of privacy that we</p>
<p>all have now. I&rsquo;ve just had like, we&rsquo;ve just created these massive honeypots, where you know,</p>
<p>any state or non state actor can essentially just have an incredibly detailed understanding of who</p>
<p>you are. Yep. And why? Because we weren&rsquo;t willing to pay five bucks a month for storage.</p>
<p>Everything needed to be free.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this part of isn&rsquo;t this part of the</p>
<p>philosophy behind decentralized services? That, you know, crypto is distributed? Yeah,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t like using that term, but just decentralized services, where the data doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sit on some centralized enterprise controlled servers. But the data is distributed either on</p>
<p>a chain or in your phone or in some way. You know, your identity, your information, your content</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t centrally controlled. And that that fundamental principle may actually come to kind</p>
<p>of bear over the next couple of years and decades that a model Yeah, that model is more appropriate</p>
<p>for us for me. And therefore, the services that are built that way are going to win in the market.</p>
<p>The challenge is ultimately how do you finance those because those services,</p>
<p>right? I mean, they don&rsquo;t have to pay, you have to pay for them, you know, if you&rsquo;re willing to</p>
<p>pay $10 a month for your privacy, consumers are doing it for you. But I use the brave browser</p>
<p>and VPNs. And these are becoming a major category. You hear it on podcast advertising all the time.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo, brave VPNs, VPNs aren&rsquo;t just for hackers anymore. They&rsquo;re like real,</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re bringing up something that I think that&rsquo;s really important, which is that, you know,</p>
<p>over the last 20 years, for all of us, we&rsquo;ve been building these products on the internet,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve actually done a little bit of a disservice, because we&rsquo;ve basically created these expectations</p>
<p>of consumer surplus. And we&rsquo;ve never given people true sets of trade offs. We&rsquo;ve always said, Oh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get more. And it&rsquo;s essentially free, because we&rsquo;ll back into an advertising model</p>
<p>that that supports us being able to give you more and more for free. But it turns out that it has</p>
<p>some real consequences. And I do think that not enough of us actually understand why privacy is</p>
<p>important. But when you start to hear these examples, and it&rsquo;ll be important to see what</p>
<p>what the true details of this Twitter situation are. I think that the pendulum starts to swing</p>
<p>in the other direction where we say, Okay, you know what, I&rsquo;ll eat out at Chipotle one night</p>
<p>a week less. And instead, I&rsquo;m going to reallocate that money to making sure that I have, you know,</p>
<p>some amount of privacy, you can do it for 25 bucks a month, you know, two or 300 bucks a year,</p>
<p>which is a big number for, you know, maybe the average Joe, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>packaged and bundled right now. So you&rsquo;re seeing the VPNs, the anonymous search engines,</p>
<p>the browsers all starting to bundle, they&rsquo;re bundling a set a suite of services. And so I</p>
<p>think this is upon us now and consumers get it, and they want to protect their privacy. So and</p>
<p>Apple has said, this is going to be our reason for you to choose our cloud is that we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to put the local settings, we&rsquo;re gonna put your data on your phone encrypted, we don&rsquo;t have access</p>
<p>to it. Use use Apple for this reason. Of course, they&rsquo;re also building a multi billion dollar ad</p>
<p>business at the same time in Apple News and their app store. So there&rsquo;s that I guess we should move</p>
<p>on here. We&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll see what happens with this. The other big news story that people are talking</p>
<p>about this week, and we talked about I guess last year was student loan debt relief. Interestingly,</p>
<p>about 85 days before the midterms. Joe Biden has decided to unilaterally give 10 to 20 k of</p>
<p>debt relief to people who have student loans, you have to have under 125 k in yearly income as an</p>
<p>individual to 50 as a household. And the student loan pause program, which happened during COVID</p>
<p>has been extended to the end of this year. I&rsquo;m not sure why. No, that was about they explained</p>
<p>why. Apparently, it takes four months for them to turn on their COBOL written software that runs</p>
<p>these loans. Mighty change takes four months gonna take it&rsquo;s gonna take four months to restart the</p>
<p>software that that calculates your loan balance and is able to print a bill. We&rsquo;re so incompetent.</p>
<p>Okay, anyway, you have to apply for this. And as we know, student loan is student loan debt is 1.7</p>
<p>5 trillion. This is gonna cost us another 300 billion. Can&rsquo;t imagine what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>with this 1020 k people buying NFTs and stocks and housing and we&rsquo;re going to hit the I guess</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to Bloomberg Bloomberg had a report that said that, look, we we passed the inflation</p>
<p>reduction act. We talked about it last week. But one of the key pillars of that is that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>300 billion of expected revenues coming in. And we essentially turned around and just gave that</p>
<p>back to a very, very small segment of the American population. Bloomberg&rsquo;s analysis was</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to create somewhere between point one and point 3% extra inflation on top of all of</p>
<p>that. And so you know, you really have to ask yourself like what, what was the White House</p>
<p>trying to accomplish? I think number one, they made a campaign promise. And so you know, I think</p>
<p>Biden needed to make sure that he fulfilled that. But nobody was really happy, right? The</p>
<p>progressives wanted something extreme. Everybody else said, you know, this is not really the right</p>
<p>thing to do. Because it doesn&rsquo;t really solve the the the root cause of what we&rsquo;re dealing with,</p>
<p>you know, if it would have been much better if you&rsquo;d said, Hey, listen, you know, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to make this stuff expungable on bankruptcy, that would have been really useful. What happens if you</p>
<p>actually tried to, I don&rsquo;t know, you were from the inner city, and you worked your ass off,</p>
<p>you became a doctor, you have 300,000 in debt. But now you&rsquo;re a, you know, a resident, and you</p>
<p>make 126,000. Well, now you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re kind of SOL here. So there&rsquo;s a lot of folks</p>
<p>that they probably wanted to wanted to help that they didn&rsquo;t help. Then there&rsquo;s all the blue collar</p>
<p>folks who are like, why, why this giveaway only to these folks, then there are the people that</p>
<p>paid off their loans thinking, why did I pay my loans off? Then there&rsquo;s the incentives that it</p>
<p>creates for colleges, which is, well, I&rsquo;m just going to keep jacking up tuition, because if</p>
<p>they did it once, they may do it again. So all of these things, I think are sort of a little bit of,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a little bit of a head scratcher. And then the last thing which we can talk about</p>
<p>at the end is, I don&rsquo;t think this is what gets people out to vote. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>people care about ultimately at the polls, which if there was a political calculation to make,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important. And specifically, when you look at what happened last night in a bunch of these</p>
<p>districts, every progressive candidate got absolutely shellacked, they lost across the board.</p>
<p>And so the progressive talking points around this stuff, fundamentally, when push comes to shove,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work for democratic voters. And then second, is there was a really hotly contested seat,</p>
<p>which was a democrat versus a republican. I think it&rsquo;s Pat Ryan, versus this guy,</p>
<p>Mark Molinaro, the republican, he was leading the entire way. And then this guy 151 49. And this is</p>
<p>a very centrist down the middle. Damn. So all the signs are like, this may not have been the smartest</p>
<p>thing to do. But I don&rsquo;t think Joe Biden had a choice because he made the promise and he had to</p>
<p>live up to it. Freeberg, is this a fair thing to do a smart thing to do a cynical thing to do to buy</p>
<p>votes? Where do you fall down on this issue? This is absolutely moronic. I think that the</p>
<p>fact that 8 million households are eligible for this relief, and 10 to $20,000 is relief</p>
<p>is provided to a minority of Americans is exactly what Chamath said, which is kind of distorted</p>
<p>politics at its worst. There. This is a $300 billion bill to the US taxpayer. And the ultimate</p>
<p>beneficiary of that bill, while we all might want to say it&rsquo;s the people that are getting debt</p>
<p>relief that have taken out these student loans, that money was transferred to somewhere. And you</p>
<p>know where it was transferred to university endowments, and the profit and the pockets of</p>
<p>for profit educational institutions. If there were a free market for education in the United States,</p>
<p>and the government was not involved in the process of funding and supporting the educational</p>
<p>infrastructure in this country, individual citizens would have the right and the obligation</p>
<p>to make decisions about whether or not the money that they&rsquo;re spending on tuition</p>
<p>actually has a positive ROI for them. By spending 10,000 or $100,000. Am I going to make more than</p>
<p>that much money back when I graduate. And unfortunately, we&rsquo;ve lulled our citizenry,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve lulled our country into complacency, where that decision and that calculus is no longer</p>
<p>required. Because Uncle Sam is there to give you all the money you want to go to college.</p>
<p>And the hungry money hungry institutions that are there to educate you are taking that money,</p>
<p>putting it in their endowments or in the pockets of their shareholders. And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it turns out that that decision may not have been the best decision. And we&rsquo;re no longer holding</p>
<p>ourselves individually to take responsibility for the decisions that we&rsquo;ve made. And we&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>miss incentives because of the government programs that have been created by telling people</p>
<p>you need to get a higher education, the government is going to pay for it for you. And it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter if it does or doesn&rsquo;t work. Because at the end of the day, if it doesn&rsquo;t work, we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going to pay it back for you anyway, we&rsquo;ll bail you out. And there&rsquo;s a middle class in the United</p>
<p>States of America that is going to end up paying the tax bill primarily because that&rsquo;s where most</p>
<p>tax dollars come from, for the minority of people that made a bad decision. And it&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>their fault. They made that decision because the infrastructure in the system was set up to tell</p>
<p>they were duped. Yeah, go to college, get a good degree, it always works having a good life, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make more money. And the and the reality is that they aren&rsquo;t and that they don&rsquo;t the ROI for many</p>
<p>of these degrees has been negative. You make less money than you would have if you were actually in</p>
<p>the workforce, earning an on the ground experience and progressing your career. You do not need a</p>
<p>degree in philosophy or history or German studies to be able to go and be effective in the technology</p>
<p>workforce or in the services workforce. And I think that we&rsquo;re seeing that play out. The biggest</p>
<p>challenge now is if we&rsquo;re going to provide this loan relief, and not reform the educational</p>
<p>infrastructure and the and the requirements for whether or not an educational system is eligible</p>
<p>for support from the federal loan program, we are not actually solving the fundamental problem.</p>
<p>We are keeping this gravy train running. And we&rsquo;re not actually getting to the root cause of</p>
<p>where this money is flowing. And this is exactly what happens. I will rehash my point that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made 100 times at the end of empires, everyone sees that the money train is leaving the station,</p>
<p>and everyone jumps and grabs what they can. And that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s going on. We think that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a rich nation, but we&rsquo;re becoming complacent. And this is unfortunate. And it&rsquo;s a really sad</p>
<p>sign. I think we need to fix this educational infrastructure, we need to make eligibility</p>
<p>requirements for whether or not loans are actually going to have a positive ROI for students.</p>
<p>And then individuals ultimately need to be educated on that and made held accountable</p>
<p>to whether or not they&rsquo;re making the right decisions for themselves.</p>
<p>Sach should each American pay $1,000 to let these 8 million people off the hook,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what this is going to cost.</p>
<p>No, of course not. I mean,</p>
<p>if people say I don&rsquo;t like you, I just gave you the softball of all softballs. No, I mean,</p>
<p>look, I think this is an issue where all four of us are on the same page. I agree with everything</p>
<p>that Jamal said and what Freeberg said. I mean, this bill is unfair, or it rewards</p>
<p>relatively well off college grads over working class people, it&rsquo;s going to add 300 billion to</p>
<p>the deficit. I mean, Joe Manchin should feel like a sucker right now, because they just spent</p>
<p>the 300 billion of supposed savings that he just agreed to.</p>
<p>Just to add, it&rsquo;s unconstitutional. I mean, the Constitution expressly says,</p>
<p>no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t understand how Biden can even do this by an executive order. I expect this will</p>
<p>be challenged and taken to the Supreme Court. And I think there&rsquo;s a very good chance it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>end up like Biden&rsquo;s other executive orders that were ruled unconstitutional. Remember,</p>
<p>there was the vaccine mandate that he tried to do, and there was the eviction moratorium that</p>
<p>he tried to do, and they&rsquo;re both ruled unconstitutional. I think there&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>chance that this will also be ruled unconstitutional. And like you guys mentioned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inflationary. I mean, these are basically STEMI checks, which we don&rsquo;t need right now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to make tuition go up, because the more government subsidizes something, the more</p>
<p>those providers have an incentive to raise the cost. So, this is just a jump the shark moment,</p>
<p>I think, for policymaking. The question is, why are they doing it? And I think it really speaks to</p>
<p>the nature of the Democratic Party today, which is the Democratic Party has shifted from being</p>
<p>a blue collar, sort of more economically populist party, economically left party,</p>
<p>to being a professional class that is college educated, culturally left, more woke party.</p>
<p>And this is the ultimate example of that, where the Democratic Party is basically</p>
<p>passing this payoff and giveaway to their sort of woke college graduates at the expense of their</p>
<p>blue collar, the blue collar part of their coalition. And, you know, a Democratic political</p>
<p>scientist that I like to read, Roy Tushara, just today, he had a blog post called the</p>
<p>Democrat Shifting Coalition, where he pointed out that if you look at polling, if you look at the</p>
<p>generic ballot among white college graduates, they favor Democrats by 12 points, whereas the white</p>
<p>working class, which is to say non-college voters, they favor Republicans by 25 points.</p>
<p>So one of the biggest gaps in the electorate is college versus non-college. That is</p>
<p>the fundamental gap. It&rsquo;s bigger than even, you know, than any other gap, than racial gaps or</p>
<p>anything like that. This is really the key gap of the electorate. And this is a payoff</p>
<p>to the, basically to the foot, the new foot soldiers of the Democratic Party. If you think</p>
<p>about it, the old stereotype of a foot soldier of the Democratic Party would be a union</p>
<p>representative. They were the ones getting out the vote. That person has been replaced with</p>
<p>sort of a woke college graduate who joins the Democratic Socialist America, and they go out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the ones pounding the pavement and doing the ballot harvesting. So there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>real change in what this party is about. And I think that&rsquo;s the explanation for why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>passing this. The NFA&rsquo;s&hellip; Chamath, and then we&rsquo;ll go to you, Freeman. The NFA&rsquo;s from Sarah</p>
<p>Lawrence College have taken over the Democratic Party. Yeah. Well, let me ask you guys. Let me</p>
<p>ask you guys a question. Yeah. When you guys graduated, everyone went to undergrad. Chamath,</p>
<p>you went to undergrad in Canada, right? I have no grad degree. Right. But when you guys graduated</p>
<p>college, what do you think the ratio 80-20, 90-10, 50-50, 0-100 was the first two years</p>
<p>of experience you guys had in the workforce versus the education and knowledge you garnered</p>
<p>in college? 90% workforce. 90% workforce. First time I went to school at night, so I was working</p>
<p>at school. 100 and 0. I went to a school, University of Waterloo, that has a program</p>
<p>called co-op, where you have to alternate school and work. It takes an extra year to graduate,</p>
<p>but you end up getting 24 months of full-time work experience. So it was the same. And you</p>
<p>graduate with a lot less debt. I graduated with half the debt I would have otherwise.</p>
<p>Zacks, I mean, do you feel the same? I mean, you went and got a law degree. That&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I think that it used to be the case that people would go get these degrees,</p>
<p>and they would take out these loans because there was a perceived ROI of getting this education.</p>
<p>And I think one of the deeper issues we have today is it&rsquo;s very unclear what the ROI is. I mean,</p>
<p>what is the return on getting a degree in social studies or art history, or frankly, some woke</p>
<p>studies at one of these prestigious universities? Their graduates go out, and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>especially qualified for a higher-paying job. And actually, I think one of the really revealing</p>
<p>parts of this executive order is not just the debt forgiveness part. We haven&rsquo;t really touched</p>
<p>on it. There&rsquo;s another provision that caps repayment levels. So basically, it says that</p>
<p>the monthly payments on undergraduate loans be limited to 5% of monthly income. Now, who is that</p>
<p>the payoff to? That is the payoff to the art history major from Amherst who ends up being</p>
<p>a barista at Starbucks, or the Democratic political operative who works for the DSA</p>
<p>gathering votes. I mean, that is who this is a payoff to.</p>
<p>Or the RNC.</p>
<p>Let me give the counter argument to you, Saxon. I want to hear your response to this. So the</p>
<p>counter argument is, hey, listen, the airlines got bailed out for a trillion dollars, cumulatively.</p>
<p>2008 financial crisis, 700 billion or something to that number.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to respond to this.</p>
<p>There is a caveat to that, which is we actually made money on that bailout.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna respond to this. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, great. And then number three, hold on. And number three,</p>
<p>me to airlines, banks, and then the Trump tax break 1.5 billion. So why can&rsquo;t a bunch of students</p>
<p>get but 300 billion? That is the counter argument. Everybody, we don&rsquo;t complain when,</p>
<p>you know, rich people get bailouts and the rich corporations and airlines do. But now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re suddenly complaining about this little pittance here. What&rsquo;s your best response to</p>
<p>that, Freeberg? I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s my position.</p>
<p>Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary of the United States had a tweet storm about this. And</p>
<p>he said, you know, the student loan issue arouses passion. Here are some observations and some</p>
<p>responses. There is no analogy with bank bailouts. Student loans are grants that cost the government</p>
<p>money. The bank bailouts were loans at premium interest, in which the government actually turned</p>
<p>a profit. And it&rsquo;s important to think about all government services, being infrastructure funding,</p>
<p>where you are funding some underlying tubing or mechanism that allows society and the economy to</p>
<p>progress versus making up for the dollar mistakes or decisions that were made in the past. I also</p>
<p>have issues not just with this, but with the issues of people buying homes in coastal cities,</p>
<p>that they get bailed out at the price of that home at the fair market price when a hurricane hits.</p>
<p>Because they paid a premium, taking on the risk of a hurricane or a flooding event hitting their</p>
<p>home. Why should the US government and the US taxpayer come in and say, you know what, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to reimburse you for the full value of your home, which frankly, should have been 50% of what you</p>
<p>paid for it, because it&rsquo;s sitting on a coastline. And that&rsquo;s a big problem that we generally have,</p>
<p>is we try and use the government as a system for providing bailouts to make up for past investment</p>
<p>mistakes made by individuals and businesses. And I think that there&rsquo;s a very clear distinction that</p>
<p>you can make when you decide whether or not a and we use the term bailout anytime we&rsquo;re spending</p>
<p>money. But the reality is, if you&rsquo;re making an investment that has some payoff for economic</p>
<p>growth, and for people and for this country to progress in some measurable way, that is a good</p>
<p>way to assess whether or not that is a reasonable investment versus saying, you know what, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>covering someone else&rsquo;s liability. And when you do that, we&rsquo;re actually burning money. And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting ourselves deeper in a hole as a nation and making it harder to do the former to make</p>
<p>the infrastructure investments and make the investments that allow us to move forward.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a really good way to clarify these things. And frankly, the list of</p>
<p>things that people say, this is fair, this this is not fair, yada, yada, go down that list and ask</p>
<p>yourself that question. Is it a positive ROI to progress our country forward? Or is it a bailout</p>
<p>for people that had some liability they took on that they can&rsquo;t cover. And I think for all those</p>
<p>things that are unfair, a really important point, we cannot get caught up in the endless cycle of</p>
<p>making up for other people&rsquo;s unfair benefits that they got from this from this government.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s a road to nowhere, we will burn through everything we have,</p>
<p>and everyone will scramble for money. And that&rsquo;s the state that we&rsquo;re in right now,</p>
<p>where everyone&rsquo;s raising their hand. And they&rsquo;re seeing $800 billion bills, $600 billion bills,</p>
<p>COVID relief, pandemic relief, PPP loan relief, and everyone says, Well, what about me?</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, everyone&rsquo;s what about me is going to drive us into an infinite black</p>
<p>hole that we will never get out of. And we have to change our mindset and take individual</p>
<p>responsibility and recognize that the dollars that we&rsquo;re spending have to have an ROI for</p>
<p>progression of us as a whole. And this is a really dangerous place that we&rsquo;re in right now.</p>
<p>So if the if the education comments, okay, can I make sure you make sure I was the last question</p>
<p>to sex? Am I too monologuey today? I feel like I&rsquo;m very passionate. No, no, you&rsquo;re doing great. I</p>
<p>mean, the fact that you&rsquo;re passionate about something video game. Yeah, that almond milk</p>
<p>gave you a little make those cashews. Maybe four cashews going forward. I mean, this is really bug</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s this stuff really bugs me. I&rsquo;ll be honest. Yeah, I&rsquo;m like, dude, like, this stuff</p>
<p>just makes me feel like what are we doing? It&rsquo;s just did you put chia seeds in your? Yeah, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it. It wasn&rsquo;t the goji. Was it the goji berries? The goji. Very easy on the goji berries. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a superfood right there. If you if you have if you have chia seeds in the morning, this is a</p>
<p>huge BM that&rsquo;s about to hit. It&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re just waiting for the wave. Yeah, yes. I mean,</p>
<p>for sure. I have two comments. Comment number one is, I think the thing that shows that this</p>
<p>could have been better is that it was completely silent on the ability to expunge your student</p>
<p>loans in bankruptcy. The ability to discharge that is the single biggest change you could make</p>
<p>to the system to be fair to everybody and introduce a better ROI risk scoring calculation</p>
<p>mechanism. Why? Okay, so great. So this is an agreement, but go ahead and explain it.</p>
<p>Okay, in all debt markets, right, whenever you lend money, there is an assumption of risk that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking. And that fits on a curve of highly likely to default, zero likelihood of default.</p>
<p>And that manifests in a risk scoring. So FICO score, but in the debt markets, right. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these companies that provide that Moody&rsquo;s and S&amp;P, they say, you&rsquo;re an investment grade debt,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re a triple A plus, you&rsquo;re a junk debt. So you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re a triple B</p>
<p>minus or whatever. And depending on where you are, you pay different rates. This is the same</p>
<p>in car insurance. It&rsquo;s the same in home insurance. It&rsquo;s the same in health insurance.</p>
<p>But in all of those cases, if you go upside down, you can declare bankruptcy and you can</p>
<p>discharge those debts. Here, we don&rsquo;t have that idea. So if you go bankrupt, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>this debt will stay with you forever, which is deeply unfair. Second is if you actually flipped</p>
<p>it, and you could allow it to be discharged, then the companies that provided these loans</p>
<p>would be forced to risk score you. And the reason why that would be so powerful is that that would</p>
<p>then create the forcing function for universities to actually deliver what they promise. And so who</p>
<p>do you think is really against the ability to discharge in bankruptcy? It&rsquo;s the universities</p>
<p>and the university endowments. So you know, if I were progressives, the thing that I would have</p>
<p>pushed more than a handout to a few people, which by the way, didn&rsquo;t even, you know, really scratch</p>
<p>the surface of the debt that they had anyways. And it also served to piss off everybody else,</p>
<p>I would have focused on this bankruptcy issue, because that is a meaningful, lasting change.</p>
<p>And the second is why don&rsquo;t you go and actually get a large portion of this money from all these</p>
<p>university endowments, because the longer that these folks run what is effectively a multi trillion</p>
<p>dollar asset management business, they&rsquo;re always going to treat education and the ROI that comes</p>
<p>from it as a second class citizen. Okay, and that is what I think is wrong. And if you were to just</p>
<p>fix this one thing, and then even the threat of actually confiscating some of the $50 billion</p>
<p>that Harvard has, or the $49 billion that you Timco has, you would start the UT system as you</p>
<p>would start to see the seeds of change where administrators would think to themselves,</p>
<p>I have to deliver something of value. Because these kids are getting loans, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be risk scored. And I don&rsquo;t want to be the person that&rsquo;s like a low end borrower, right? I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>serving junk paper to the market. I want to serve people that are going to go and really drive a</p>
<p>huge ROI. So then sacks, you&rsquo;d have an alignment between the people giving the loan and perhaps</p>
<p>the value of the degree. And so you could say, Hey, we&rsquo;ll give loans to stem degrees at a different</p>
<p>rate, or a different number of them or a different amount of cash or a different interest rate,</p>
<p>then we would for I don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;re getting a degree in philosophy or like I did psychology,</p>
<p>right? They just give a different one based on the outcome. That makes total sense to you. Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, I&rsquo;ve said, well, for a long time that we should be allowing student debt to be discharged</p>
<p>in bankruptcy, just like any other type of debt, just like credit card debt, just like other types</p>
<p>of debt. That&rsquo;s right, that would create some risk to the underwriter, so that they would have</p>
<p>to actually assess whether this person getting that degree would be able to repay the debt.</p>
<p>But you have to ask the question, is it a bug or a feature that they&rsquo;re trying to remove market</p>
<p>forces. And I would argue that this is deliberate that progressives in the Democratic Party</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want there to be accountability for what you learn in college. Why? Because as I mentioned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s these colleges that are putting out the foot soldiers of the Democratic Party. I mean,</p>
<p>listen, there&rsquo;s a 37 point gap in party preference, just based on one variable, which is whether</p>
<p>you are professional class or working class, meaning college degree or no college degree.</p>
<p>And that spans across different racial groups and other party lines. So the fact of the matter</p>
<p>is that if you go to college and get a degree, you are much, much more likely to become progressive.</p>
<p>Now, why is that? I think it&rsquo;s because a lot of these colleges have basically become</p>
<p>re-education camps. I mean, these are the woke madrasas of, uh, of cultural, of cultural</p>
<p>That is a great quote. Wow. A woke madrasa. It&rsquo;s kind of like Harvard has become like</p>
<p>Zalcada. Who wrote that one for you? I see that. Yeah. Yeah. In fairness,</p>
<p>came up with that line. But look, these places are woke madrasas and what do they do? They</p>
<p>graduate these people. They graduate the new clerics of our woke theocracy. These people</p>
<p>go on to become the enforcers. They become suicide bombers. Yes. Exactly. It&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like violent like that, but listen, we, we look down on some of these theocratic</p>
<p>societies and we don&rsquo;t realize how like them we are. I mean, look, these kids who graduate from</p>
<p>these woke madrasas, they go off to become the speech police. I mean, they go enforce</p>
<p>community moderation at social networks. They become the foot soldiers. All right,</p>
<p>let me just make a final point. Let me say one thing. It&rsquo;s true, right? How else did you explain</p>
<p>that 37 point gap? Okay. So if you&rsquo;re the democratic party, listen, if you&rsquo;re the democratic</p>
<p>party, which is run by woke progressive political operatives, why would you want to defund the</p>
<p>factories that are brainwashing more young students to basically join your ranks?</p>
<p>Okay. I want to say two things. I want to say two things. One is I think that the university</p>
<p>and the college degree has been used as a heuristic for progression out of blue collar</p>
<p>to white collar. It says, if you get a hollow and J Cal, you, I know you can speak to this</p>
<p>because you know, you come from a family that, uh, that works blue collar and you know, you got</p>
<p>a college degree, but I think there is this, um, uh, you know, kind of assertion in the United</p>
<p>States and has now become one could argue a meme that if you get a college degree, you&rsquo;re no longer</p>
<p>blue collar, you&rsquo;re now white collar. And the reality is that the quality of that degree varies</p>
<p>greatly based on where you go, the major and the experience you get to accompany that degree.</p>
<p>And as a result, you may not necessarily transfer from blue collar to white collar,</p>
<p>but you have the degree. You say you&rsquo;re now white collar, and then you&rsquo;re working a blue collar job</p>
<p>with $120,000 a debt. Um, and so that, that heuristic isn&rsquo;t true. And what we need to examine</p>
<p>is why that heuristic is no longer true and what we can do about it. Secondly, secondly,</p>
<p>I do want to make a defense for college. I think that there, there is a incredible benefit</p>
<p>to broadening individuals, exposure to topics, research, um, and areas that they may not have</p>
<p>naturally been interested in, or that they will not necessarily get trained in. And there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>important role that that educational infrastructure has in allowing us to be a more enlightened</p>
<p>populace, meaning we can understand history. We can understand philosophy. We can understand the</p>
<p>things that shaped our, our world and our livelihoods and what makes us who we are today.</p>
<p>And we can understand the sciences and the maps that affect us. So we can better understand the</p>
<p>world and the people around us. So there is a role, but the real question is how do you integrate</p>
<p>that educational role into a technical training program or into a real world development program</p>
<p>skills that, that, that basically make an educational system more than just a checkbox</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t actually do anything for you, but gives you that exposure accompanied by,</p>
<p>and maybe that&rsquo;s the requirement with, you know, with federal loans is that there should be some</p>
<p>skill or some, I think the minute I think the minute I don&rsquo;t want to lose the important breadth</p>
<p>of exposure that college is meant to bring to people. Yes. And then that&rsquo;s valid. Go ahead,</p>
<p>come off. And then I&rsquo;ll wrap up my final thought. No, I was just gonna say, I really think people</p>
<p>do not understand how, how meaningful of a change it would be if you were able to discharge your</p>
<p>student debt in bankruptcy, it is the most powerful market function we could create to</p>
<p>make these universities more accountable. And I think if you guys look at my annual letter,</p>
<p>I put a chart in there. But, you know, part of the problem that we have in these universities,</p>
<p>these leading universities is that these have become graveyards. Okay, there is a gerontocracy</p>
<p>that runs these things with an iron fist. And as these folks have stayed in these jobs for</p>
<p>enormous amounts of time, now 4050 plus years, the average person is in their mid to late 70s.</p>
<p>Now who are who are the administrators of our leading institutions, they are focused on running</p>
<p>up endowments, and they are focused on the power and the influence that comes with their position.</p>
<p>So I implore anybody who has any ability to to actually achieve this change, there should not</p>
<p>be a single logical person that should not support the ability to discharge student debt</p>
<p>in bankruptcy. And you will identify the insider establishment by those that try to stop you,</p>
<p>you will expose them 100%. And I just want to put a closing thing here for the people listening who</p>
<p>have young people making these decisions. When we all went to college as Gen Xers, college was 910</p>
<p>$11,000 a year in tuition. And if you came out with 10 or 20 k, and you had an average job or</p>
<p>salary of double or triple that when you graduated, it seemed like a good deal, the ROI broke. Now,</p>
<p>market forces are at work here, I just want to point out two of them. Number one, there is a</p>
<p>website grow with Google, you just look up right now, they&rsquo;re allowing people to get professional</p>
<p>certificates. And this is free. And if you could pull up grow with Google, they&rsquo;ve identified</p>
<p>five different paths to jobs. One of them is digital marketing and e commerce ones it support</p>
<p>data analytics, project management and UX design, they have essentially looked at what&rsquo;s needed in</p>
<p>the world and aligned a three to six months online course for fucking free, that&rsquo;ll get you a job.</p>
<p>And you if you have executive function, the ability to sit down, shut up and learn can do</p>
<p>this first before you make the decision to go $100,000 in debt, and then get a $50,000 a year</p>
<p>job. Here are these jobs average, you know, 60 7080 k a year, and you can do it for free. The</p>
<p>next piece that the private market is doing you and I looked into this Chamath actually together</p>
<p>ISA income sharing agreements, we were lucky enough to invest in a company called Maritas,</p>
<p>they are providing ISA is for a college Colorado Mountain College for nursing. What this means is,</p>
<p>they will give you your tuition for free. It&rsquo;s educate now pay later. If you go to one of these</p>
<p>colleges for nursing, you get educated and then you pay it back and you&rsquo;re capped at paying back</p>
<p>like two times whatever the loan is one and a half, whatever the college decides, but they take</p>
<p>the risk as opposed to Harvard with 40 billion that takes no fucking risk. And so the free market,</p>
<p>I think can also solve this, but you have to sit down with your kids and say, let&rsquo;s have an ROI</p>
<p>calculation at 20k in debt, you know, okay, fine, you got a philosophy degree, by the way,</p>
<p>Saks final question for you. I posted this thing in the group chat. But what do you guys think</p>
<p>about this? You know, Republican tidal wave becoming a Republican ripple? That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s it was. It was an odd set of outcomes, don&rsquo;t you think for</p>
<p>question? I mean, Biden, look, Biden has had a good run over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s my audio cut out one more time. So I&rsquo;ll say it again. The political report</p>
<p>says that the red wave looks more like a red ripple.</p>
<p>No, I think I think it&rsquo;s right. Well, look, I think a couple of things happen. So</p>
<p>first, Biden has got some wins legislatively, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good policy. I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>this executive order is good policy. I don&rsquo;t think the 750 billion of climate that pretends</p>
<p>to be an inflation Reduction Act, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s good policy. But nonetheless,</p>
<p>he has delivered some goodies for his his base for his donors. And that has basically ameliorated</p>
<p>the story in the press that Democrats are in disarray. So you&rsquo;re not hearing that. In addition,</p>
<p>I think Biden&rsquo;s got two things going for him, Dobbs and jobs. I mean,</p>
<p>Dobbs, there&rsquo;s no question Dobbs has helped the Democrats quite a bit.</p>
<p>Certainly has motivated their base. And then the jobs report has been strong. Look, I think</p>
<p>overall, the economic data is mixed. Real wages are not keeping up with inflation. But jobs have</p>
<p>so far been strong. So yeah, there&rsquo;s no question that Democrats are in a materially better position</p>
<p>they were in June, when it looked like a tsunami. That being said, the election still 10 weeks away.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll have to see what happens. And I think the economy is still in a pretty</p>
<p>fragile state. So 10 weeks is still a long time. But yes, you&rsquo;re right. Yeah. So where things are</p>
<p>looking right now, things are a lot better for Biden. And by the way, I do think the Republicans</p>
<p>have some issues with candidate quality. And so there&rsquo;s a couple of races that, you know,</p>
<p>should have been more slam dunks that are not. But what was the first word you used there? You</p>
<p>said Dobbs and jobs? What was the first word? jobs, abortion? Ah, the Dobbs case? Yeah,</p>
<p>got it. Got it. Okay. Okay. I just didn&rsquo;t hear it perfectly. Weren&rsquo;t a lot of these wins for Biden</p>
<p>bipartisan? Well, no, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed on straight party lines. This</p>
<p>this college loan forgiveness is something they can&rsquo;t even get through the Senate. It&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>done as an executive order. The things that were bipartisan, hold on the things that were bipartisan,</p>
<p>there was that chips act, where they got some votes. That&rsquo;s great. And then there was the guns</p>
<p>bill. So yeah, look, he did get some bipartisan wins. There&rsquo;s no question about it. I think the</p>
<p>Republicans, I think the Republicans got hoodwinked. Basically, the Republicans foolishly</p>
<p>went along with infrastructure and with the chips act, they should have forced Biden to use up</p>
<p>reconciliation on one of those bills, and then they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get through the 750</p>
<p>billion Inflation Reduction Act. So Republicans, you know, as much of a sort of master strategist,</p>
<p>as McConnell is reputed to be, they really got snowed on this one.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s possible for somebody to masturbate themselves from the inside out, Jason&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>it right now. No, no, no. There&rsquo;s a reason why we do this from the chest up. Okay.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s likely to happen in November is still that the Republicans win one of the chambers,</p>
<p>probably the house, I think the Senate is still up for grabs. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;ll be important because Biden won&rsquo;t be able to pass some of this legislation that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think, destructive from a deficit standpoint, from an economic standpoint. And we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about on this pod, I don&rsquo;t think you guys are too excited about most of the legislation he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>passing. So quite frankly, I&rsquo;m just hoping for gridlock. I&rsquo;d like to get back to a situation</p>
<p>of gridlock. Less spending would be certainly great at this point. I mean,</p>
<p>well, if we&rsquo;re trying to find inflation here, while we keep spending money over here, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>challenging. If you want to get back to fiscal responsibility, you got to vote for gridlock,</p>
<p>or hopefully moderates come. All right, well, we&rsquo;ll let sacks go. Anyway, we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>science anyway. And sacks checks his email during that segment. So by the way, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>article now, you know, when we talked about quiet quitting, it&rsquo;s now become this huge thing that</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s talking about. Yes. And, and what&rsquo;s so funny about quiet quitting is just yet another</p>
<p>example of Gen Z, again, co opting something we&rsquo;ve already done. When we used to do it,</p>
<p>it was called coasting. And you just be resting, resting. But But now it&rsquo;s called quiet quitting.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re all up in their feelings. Do we want to talk about</p>
<p>the gut biome? I want to hear about the gut biome. So there was a there was a paper published.</p>
<p>In so the journal sell. The paper was done by a research team out of her to Leah. So I&rsquo;ll take a</p>
<p>step back, the human body is made up of roughly 10 trillion cells. And there are also somewhere</p>
<p>between 10 and 40 trillion bacterial cells that live in your body, primarily in your small</p>
<p>intestine, in your in what people call the gut biome. And so this is a population of microbes,</p>
<p>bacteria, that are basically chemical factories, they eat stuff up, and they spit out chemicals,</p>
<p>and those chemicals end up in our body. And it turns out that the gut biome,</p>
<p>the bacteria in our gut can actually regulate our health in a very significant way. And this</p>
<p>was the basis of our company, unique, you guys can bleep that out if you want, which is now called</p>
<p>super gut. And Jake, I know you&rsquo;ve tried the product, which was awesome. Thank you sent me</p>
<p>I bought me unique that helped me with my weight loss. And then I just got super good.</p>
<p>The principle of that business is that there is a known product, a molecule amylose that you can</p>
<p>feed the gut biome, it doesn&rsquo;t get absorbed by the human body, it sits in the gut biome,</p>
<p>and the bacteria in your gut, certain types of bacteria will eat it, their population will grow,</p>
<p>and other population of bad bacteria will shrink. And the good bacteria release chemicals called</p>
<p>short chain fatty acids that go into your blood and reduce your blood sugar and have a profound</p>
<p>effect on on your metabolism. And there are also known gut bacteria that can regulate your sleep,</p>
<p>your mood, your anxiety, your energy levels, and your glycemic control, the control of blood</p>
<p>sugar. So it&rsquo;s an incredibly telling me, are you telling me that Cialis is a natural compound? Is</p>
<p>it bacteria? Are you saying we have to cancel our Cialis prescriptions? Oh, no. Yeah. So guys,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a known, there&rsquo;s a known principle that&rsquo;s really deeply studied now in urology,</p>
<p>in neuroscience, called the gut brain axis that you can actually profoundly affect</p>
<p>disease and the condition of the brain and neuro conditions by changing the gut biome.</p>
<p>And so this is this is something that&rsquo;s just being studied. The reason it&rsquo;s all coming to light in</p>
<p>the last few years is because of the cost of DNA sequencing. We used to be very, very expensive</p>
<p>to sequence the DNA from your gut biome, which you do by looking at your poop. And then you know,</p>
<p>looking at all the DNA that&rsquo;s in the poop, and that tells you what your gut by what bacteria in</p>
<p>your gut that used to cost 1000 bucks, now it costs five bucks. And so in the last couple of</p>
<p>years, there&rsquo;s this absolute explosion in research into the gut microbiome, and more importantly,</p>
<p>how the gut microbiome affects human health. So this particular paper looked at the effect</p>
<p>that eating artificial sweeteners had on the gut biome and on human health. And so what these</p>
<p>researchers did is they, they took 120 people, they gave them nothing or gave them sugar,</p>
<p>or gave them saccharin or sucralose or aspartame or stevia, the four most popular artificial</p>
<p>sweeteners. And then they looked at how their gut biome changed. And importantly, they looked at how</p>
<p>their glycemic control or ability to control blood glucose changed blood glucose, as you guys may</p>
<p>recall, you know, you always have glucose in your blood, the more if you have over, you know, a</p>
<p>level of 100, you know, you can, and it persists, you can actually have really bad health effects.</p>
<p>And it causes high a one c over time, which is diabetes. And so high stores more fat when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spiking. And so you get when you have high blood glucose, it&rsquo;s actually damaging to organs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s damaging to cells. And over time, it can cause very significant deleterious effects to</p>
<p>the human body. That&rsquo;s what the disease of diabetes is and does is it&rsquo;s about high blood</p>
<p>blood, high blood sugar, blood glucose. So what these guys did is they gave people saccharin,</p>
<p>sucralose, aspartame and stevia, and then measured their blood glucose and their ability</p>
<p>to convert sugar in the blood and absorb it and use it. And that&rsquo;s called glycemic control. The</p>
<p>way you guys you guys have probably done this in the doctor, you take a glycemic control test,</p>
<p>you drink a bunch of sugar water, and they measure your blood sugar every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>And then they show the curve on how effectively your body can metabolize that glucose. And if</p>
<p>it cannot metabolize that glucose, well, you have bad glycemic control. And ultimately, that is</p>
<p>diabetes. And what they found was that if you eat saccharin and sucralose, which we always assumed</p>
<p>were better than sugar, they actually adversely affect your ability to control blood glucose,</p>
<p>saccharin and sucralose, in particular, drive up your blood glucose and makes it harder for</p>
<p>your body to metabolize glucose out of your blood. Aspartame and stevia were relatively benign.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in Coke Zero. That&rsquo;s what I drink.</p>
<p>There you go. And so so that was kind of the realization. And then they went deep,</p>
<p>and they actually analyzed the microbiome. And they showed that there were profound differences</p>
<p>in how these compounds affected the microbiome. It turns out that sucralose, for example,</p>
<p>is more likely not being absorbed by your intestine. So it&rsquo;s sitting in the intestinal</p>
<p>walls, and the bad bacteria are eating it. And the good bacteria that are supposed to be making</p>
<p>short chain fatty acids, and all these chemicals that regulate blood sugar, have a lower population.</p>
<p>And so we actually see a profoundly negative effect from eating certain compounds.</p>
<p>Have you shipped your poop to test these?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, we just did a clinical trial at super gut, by the way, and we found,</p>
<p>and we published it. So it&rsquo;s public.</p>
<p>But wait, just the audience doesn&rsquo;t even know this stuff exists in all likelihood.</p>
<p>You basically take a poop, and you put it in a vial, and you send it and they analyze your poop.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be graphic here. But have you done this before? How does this work?</p>
<p>I do it every I&rsquo;ve done it. Yeah. And I think it&rsquo;s um, look, here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the issue, Jason.</p>
<p>Think and I want to I want to say two things that I think are really important to say.</p>
<p>Number one is, um, we know very little about what bacteria do what in your gut,</p>
<p>how which we&rsquo;re starting to understand which ones are beneficial, which ones make good chemicals</p>
<p>that your body use and regulate your cells and regulate your health. And remember,</p>
<p>we have a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria in our gut, they&rsquo;re making chemicals,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re eating chemicals, the chemicals they make affect our cells, the chemicals they eat</p>
<p>affect our body. So the way that we evolve our health is actually profoundly affected by our gut</p>
<p>biome. So we don&rsquo;t know enough yet to say definitively, this bacteria is good. This</p>
<p>bacteria is bad. We&rsquo;re starting to have a good sense of that. The second way just say,</p>
<p>yeah, just so you know, just to double down on this, like, there&rsquo;s a form of therapy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s experimental, but it&rsquo;s called fecal microbiome. transplantation FMT heard about</p>
<p>this. But you know, we are finding now that you can take feces from healthy individuals that have</p>
<p>good, you know, gut biome and good bacterial counts. And if you put it, you know, injected</p>
<p>into people that are suffering from a bunch of different diseases, it actually is looking like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s curative. So Parkinson&rsquo;s, MS, IBS, colitis. So it just goes to show you that this that somebody</p>
<p>with good gut by there&rsquo;s bacteria really understood to another person&rsquo;s intestines,</p>
<p>where do you put your poop? No, through the bum? No, no, no, you Yeah, you could do it there. Or</p>
<p>you can take a pill. So there&rsquo;s a little take a pill and it&rsquo;s got the fecal stuff in it, you</p>
<p>swallow it. And now I want to eat somebody else&rsquo;s poop. You said I said it in a way,</p>
<p>so that we could see his reaction to in the bum and Jason was like this.</p>
<p>How does this impact Uranus? That&rsquo;s what the audience wants to know.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the other point I wanted to make, which ties to what you said this is really important.</p>
<p>So the gut biome is an ecosystem, like a rainforest. There are trees that grow monkeys climb</p>
<p>the trees, they poop, there&rsquo;s jaguars, jaguars eat the monkeys, the trees grow because of the monkey</p>
<p>poop, it is a whole ecosystem, all these organisms, all these microbes regulate one another and feed</p>
<p>one another. And this is why probiotics do not work. probiotics are single microbes, single</p>
<p>bacterial strains or fungal strains that we put into a pill, and we swallow it. And just because</p>
<p>that microbe happens to have some beneficial effect, you know, on its own in a Petri dish,</p>
<p>it does not survive in your gut biome. Because it&rsquo;s like putting a house cat in a rainforest,</p>
<p>the jaguar will eat the house cat, the house cat has nothing to eat, etc. It doesn&rsquo;t inoculate</p>
<p>inoculate means that it survives thrives in the population grows. So when we take probiotics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just passing right through our gut. It doesn&rsquo;t stay there and doesn&rsquo;t change anything.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the reason fecal microbiome, fecal transplants work is because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking the whole microbiome from someone else&rsquo;s gut, and you&rsquo;re putting it in your gut,</p>
<p>the whole rainforest, the whole rainforest, and so all the organisms that are needed that self</p>
<p>that regulate one another, all of the small molecules that regulate that cross regulate</p>
<p>each other, they all go in your gut, and then they actually change your entire gut,</p>
<p>and your gut becomes the rainforest of someone else&rsquo;s gut. And so if someone else has a healthy</p>
<p>gut, meaning my eyes, my anus can be your anus, Jason. So we put our anuses together,</p>
<p>and then a monkey goes between them. And then the rainforest is well, let me ask you a question. The</p>
<p>FDA has not approved any of this yet. When will the FDA be approving these treatments, etc. There</p>
<p>are a lot of there are a lot of clinical trials going on for fecal transplant. UCSF has a huge</p>
<p>clinical trial for MS, as Chamath pointed out right now, where they are actually doing fecal</p>
<p>transplants on patients without MS into people with MS. And significant, you know, the early</p>
<p>data of these sorts of treatments has indicated that there can be a very profound effect on the</p>
<p>frequency of lesions appearing on the brain, which is one of the primary symptoms of MS. And so these</p>
<p>organisms, we don&rsquo;t yet know why. But some of them will, when will we understand this? Is it a five</p>
<p>year tenure? There&rsquo;s a ton of startups, there&rsquo;s billions of dollars invested. When will we know</p>
<p>when will we know and have like a game? So it&rsquo;s already coming out. There&rsquo;s no it&rsquo;s not like a</p>
<p>binary switch. We&rsquo;re discovering new things. There&rsquo;s a cup, there&rsquo;s a set of companies that</p>
<p>are discovering what are called small molecules. So they&rsquo;re finding what are the little chemicals</p>
<p>that those good bacteria are making in your gut? And what can we turn those chemicals into drugs?</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re trying to turn those into drugs. Other companies are saying, you know what,</p>
<p>this is a set of good bacteria, let&rsquo;s just put them in your body and figure out a way to get</p>
<p>them to inoculate and stay. Other companies are saying, let&rsquo;s do fecal transplants. And other</p>
<p>companies are basically just saying, let&rsquo;s change this is what we do at super gut. Let&rsquo;s just change</p>
<p>the feedstock for your gut biome. And you can actually evolve the rainforest into a different</p>
<p>state by changing what you&rsquo;re feeding the bacteria in your gut. And there&rsquo;s certain molecules, you</p>
<p>can feed the gut bacteria, and then the populations will change into a more beneficial state.</p>
<p>Why are people saying like eating drinking kombucha and fermented vegetables, pickles,</p>
<p>whatever, apples are like great at fixing your biome, and then taking sugar out is good for your</p>
<p>biome. This is another thing I keep hearing, like people are making single point claims like that,</p>
<p>because they have invested in a life cell, and they want to defend their choices. It&rsquo;s not to</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s not to say that those things are bad, those are all good. But I think what we know,</p>
<p>and the fecal transplantation is the most simple way of pointing this out, is that it&rsquo;s a broad</p>
<p>scale holistic approach that gets the best results. So as you know, like if you if you had,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve had a kid that&rsquo;s had, you know, diarrhea, for example, right? You know, sometimes what we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do now is instead of giving the kid some sort of diuretic suppressant, what you actually give them</p>
<p>is probiotic, right? And what you&rsquo;re trying to do is to reintroduce healthy bacteria into that child&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stomach in a way that allows them to self manage and self heal, while the bad, you know, diarrhea</p>
<p>causing stuff kind of gets washed away, as an example. So will one thing be a cure all for you?</p>
<p>No, I think that you should be very skeptical of those claims. That&rsquo;s why everybody says,</p>
<p>a healthy, well balanced diet is really important, because we do not know. Conclusively,</p>
<p>this is why, you know, I, I tend to believe that the broad holistic diet works the best in</p>
<p>moderation. Yeah, because you just don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re not getting. We don&rsquo;t know that,</p>
<p>you know, we don&rsquo;t know, you can&rsquo;t say conclusively that there isn&rsquo;t a form of bacteria</p>
<p>that is created specifically when you consume animal protein, that is extremely helpful to you.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s not true. Not now. We don&rsquo;t know that that is true either.</p>
<p>Right. And there&rsquo;s a ton of research going on to try and figure that out right now.</p>
<p>Have we figured out any of it, though? Like, yeah, this whole tumeric ginger movement,</p>
<p>we could we could do 12 episodes on this. There&rsquo;s so much amazing discovery happening. This is a</p>
<p>good paper to highlight that, which is like, hey, maybe avoid products that have saccharin</p>
<p>and sucralose in them. But my my big thing is there is no diet, whether it&rsquo;s keto, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the South Beach diet, whether it&rsquo;s specific vegetarianism, whether it&rsquo;s veganism, nothing is</p>
<p>a cure all for what ails you. There is nothing. And by the way, one important point in this paper,</p>
<p>one of the points that these guys highlighted, which we see all the time in microbiome research,</p>
<p>is that there are what are called responders and non responders, that within a population,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like everyone that eats sucralose has the same negative effect. Some people have a</p>
<p>really negative effect. And some people have a mild to moderate to neutral effect. And so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a range of your particular physiology, your particular gut biome that will respond differently</p>
<p>to different inputs into your body. And that&rsquo;s the most important thing to figure out because</p>
<p>people need to spend time eating and sampling to understand what makes you feel better or worse.</p>
<p>This is why I have an issue with, you know, the broad based claims of this path will solve all</p>
<p>your problems. It&rsquo;s just not true. You have to solve it for yourself. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s through</p>
<p>iteration. And then the the Yeah, anyways, it does seem like non processed foods, whole foods,</p>
<p>things that exist in nature, that seems to me directionally correct as the way to go. And then</p>
<p>the fake stuff, and the process stuff may be less good for you agree with that. This is this is why</p>
<p>I think like there, there is a little bit of a scam being run on people who want to be healthy.</p>
<p>Like, for example, have you guys looked at the ingredient list on Oatly? You know, everybody</p>
<p>loves oat milk. But have you looked at the ingredient list? Are you really telling me</p>
<p>conclusively that that is healthier than milk? It&rsquo;s insane. I mean, I could, I could argue both</p>
<p>ways. But yeah, I mean, look at the chemicals, look at the chemicals in a box of Oatly. I mean,</p>
<p>just drink water. Guys, I can also tell you the chemical name for every chemical that&rsquo;s in milk,</p>
<p>which is all chemical, like all everything around us is chemicals. So I understand I understand</p>
<p>natural chemicals, but you understand synthetically made manmade chemicals that are explicit that have</p>
<p>to be put on an ingredient list because of its danger in high quantities should be treated</p>
<p>slightly differently, in my opinion. Yeah, I mean, always just gave us three subpoenas. We&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>fucked. We&rsquo;re being deposed by Oatly now. All right, everybody, we&rsquo;ll see you next time on the</p>
<p>All In pod. Love you, boys. Love you besties. Bye.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
