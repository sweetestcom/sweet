    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Our card this week is Melissa Mason and Nicole Glass, the Six of Hearts from Arizona.</p>
<p>Life was good for the 27-year-old best friends and roommates who had big plans on the horizon.</p>
<p>Until one day in the winter of 2010 when someone went into their suburban Phoenix home and</p>
<p>committed a heinous crime.</p>
<p>One that&rsquo;s left their loved ones and police perplexed for over a decade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was December 3rd, 2010, about 7.30 a.m. when Melissa Massey called her friend Nicole</p>
<p>Glass to try and make plans for later that day.</p>
<p>But the call went straight to voicemail, which surprised Melissa because Nicole&rsquo;s phone</p>
<p>was never on.</p>
<p>The two talked on the phone multiple times a day.</p>
<p>In the year they&rsquo;d become friends, Nicole was always someone she could reach with just</p>
<p>a phone call or a text.</p>
<p>But it was before 8 a.m. so she thought maybe Nicole was sleeping in.</p>
<p>So Melissa headed to her gym and decided she&rsquo;d just make the 30-minute drive to East Phoenix</p>
<p>to check on Nicole after her workout.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, she also tried Nicole&rsquo;s roommate Melissa, Melissa Mason, but everyone</p>
<p>called her Bebe.</p>
<p>But Bebe&rsquo;s phone also seemed to be off because it too went straight to voicemail.</p>
<p>When Melissa pulled up to the house around noon, she noticed that both women&rsquo;s cars were</p>
<p>parked in the driveway.</p>
<p>Nicole had given her a key to the single-floor ranch-style home, so Melissa tried to let</p>
<p>herself in by unlocking the deadbolt.</p>
<p>Except the door wouldn&rsquo;t open.</p>
<p>It seemed like the smaller lock on the doorknob itself was in the locked position, which was</p>
<p>never the case.</p>
<p>In fact, Melissa was pretty sure Nicole didn&rsquo;t even have a key to the smaller lock.</p>
<p>Phoenix cold case detective Dom Rostenberg said that&rsquo;s when Melissa&rsquo;s concern for her</p>
<p>friends started to grow.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say she was panicked at that point, but she was a little concerned.</p>
<p>So she started walking around the house and she looked through a window and she just saw</p>
<p>what appeared to be one of her friends lying on the floor.</p>
<p>Where is your husband?</p>
<p>Um, I just came over to my friend&rsquo;s house and she&rsquo;s not answering the door and I went</p>
<p>around to the back and I just see someone laying there.</p>
<p>Because of the angle of where she was peering through a window, Melissa could only see an</p>
<p>arm on the floor near the couch.</p>
<p>But still, she knew this was bad.</p>
<p>Melissa waited for police in the cul-de-sac out front, and when police arrived, one of</p>
<p>them kicked in the front door to get inside.</p>
<p>When police walked through the house, it was Bebe they found first.</p>
<p>She was face down in the dining room, her shirt pulled up from the back toward her head,</p>
<p>and some blood had started to pool beneath her.</p>
<p>Then they found Nicole, who was face down in the adjoining family room.</p>
<p>Both women were pronounced dead at the scene, and based on the looks of things, it was pretty</p>
<p>clear they&rsquo;d been murdered.</p>
<p>Police quickly checked every room to make sure the killer wasn&rsquo;t still inside, and</p>
<p>once they&rsquo;d cleared the house and the backyard, they roped the whole property off with crime</p>
<p>scene tape while simultaneously applying for a search warrant.</p>
<p>While they waited to go back in the house, police set up a mobile command unit in front</p>
<p>of the home, and quickly pulled their first witness, Melissa, in for an interview.</p>
<p>Melissa was overcome with emotion when she learned that both women were dead, and what</p>
<p>she told police only compounded the tragedy.</p>
<p>Bebe had been pregnant, which changed the case for Detective Rostenberg.</p>
<p>So from under the law in Maricopa County, the fact that she was pregnant, it becomes</p>
<p>a triple homicide.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re investigating here, a triple homicide.</p>
<p>Now Melissa didn&rsquo;t know Bebe well.</p>
<p>She was much closer with Nicole.</p>
<p>Beyond the fact that she was pregnant, all she could give police about Bebe was the first</p>
<p>name of the baby&rsquo;s father, Marquis, and she knew that he drove a maroon Chrysler</p>
<p>with quote-unquote fancy wheels.</p>
<p>As for Nicole, Melissa told police that the last time she talked to her was the night</p>
<p>before over the phone.</p>
<p>Nicole said that she was waiting on a ride to a gig that she&rsquo;d gotten bartending a</p>
<p>private party, but she didn&rsquo;t say who was giving her a ride or where the job was.</p>
<p>Melissa said the two didn&rsquo;t talk the rest of the night, but when she woke up on December</p>
<p>3rd, she had missed a text Nicole had sent the night before at around 1115.</p>
<p>The text said, quote, nobody has showed up to get us or called and I&rsquo;m going to be hot</p>
<p>if nobody shows.</p>
<p>I got ready for nothing, boo, end quote.</p>
<p>In the rest of her hour and a half long interview with the detective, Melissa let police search</p>
<p>her car and she gave them names of several other people that they were eager to interview.</p>
<p>And then, almost like clockwork, a man in a car with what one could consider fancy wheels</p>
<p>showed up.</p>
<p>And he wanted to know what the heck police were doing at his girlfriend&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>It was Marquis.</p>
<p>According to police reports obtained by our reporting team, when Marquis showed up at</p>
<p>the crime scene, police immediately pulled him into the mobile command unit for an interview.</p>
<p>By the way, this was between 6 and 7 p.m. and homicide detectives were still waiting</p>
<p>on a judge to sign their search warrant, which was taking a lot longer than usual.</p>
<p>So in the beginning of their interview with Marquis, detectives asked him what he thought</p>
<p>of the police presence at his girlfriend&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>And Marquis asked if it had something to do with, quote, last night.</p>
<p>Marquis explained that he&rsquo;d been at the house with Nicole and BB when Nicole got the</p>
<p>call about the bartending gig, and he found the call kind of suspicious.</p>
<p>He said Nicole convinced BB to go with her because the employer was sending a limo to</p>
<p>pick them up, and they would make like $400 before tips.</p>
<p>Marquis said that BB agreed to go, which was his cue to leave.</p>
<p>But before leaving, BB had gotten upset with him, questioning him about seeing his ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>And he said that it resulted in kind of a low-key argument, but nothing major, and everything</p>
<p>was pretty much fine between them when he left the house around 8 p.m.</p>
<p>From there, he went out to some clubs and said he didn&rsquo;t hear from BB again until she</p>
<p>had called him around 1030, but he missed the call.</p>
<p>BB also texted him, asking if Marquis had talked to his ex-girlfriend after he left</p>
<p>earlier, but he didn&rsquo;t respond to that.</p>
<p>Marquis said that a little after midnight, he tried to call her back, but this time,</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>According to what he told police, the calls went straight to voicemail.</p>
<p>And five calls later, at 2.07 a.m., Marquis texted BB to inform her that he&rsquo;d tried calling</p>
<p>her, but she never responded.</p>
<p>And Marquis said that&rsquo;s about when he left the clubs and went home.</p>
<p>When he still hadn&rsquo;t heard from her all day the next day, he decided to just drive</p>
<p>over.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what brought him here now.</p>
<p>A detective asked Marquis if BB had any tattoos, knowing that they&rsquo;d seen a big one on one</p>
<p>of the women&rsquo;s backs when they first discovered the bodies.</p>
<p>And Marquis confirmed BB had a cross tattoo across her back.</p>
<p>Realizing it was her, Marquis became emotional.</p>
<p>Up until then, he hadn&rsquo;t known for sure that BB was in fact one of the victims.</p>
<p>But now, police were officially telling him that his girlfriend and their unborn child</p>
<p>were dead.</p>
<p>Marquis admitted that the baby he was expecting with BB was a surprise, but they were both</p>
<p>committed to having the child, even though she was just eight weeks along.</p>
<p>But Marquis also admitted that he had been seeing other women until he found out BB was</p>
<p>pregnant.</p>
<p>And ever since then, the two had been monogamous.</p>
<p>When asked if he had any idea who would want Nicole or BB dead, Marquis said it couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have anything to do with BB because she was, quote, the sweetest thing ever.</p>
<p>He said she had no enemies.</p>
<p>And so to him, whoever killed them had to have been after Nicole, who he thought kept</p>
<p>some shady company.</p>
<p>Marquis agreed to give police his DNA, so they swabbed his cheek right then and there.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have BB&rsquo;s family members&rsquo; phone numbers, so instead, he left the scene and</p>
<p>drove directly to Tucson to notify her mother of her death.</p>
<p>In a police report, the detective wrote that Marquis was still very emotional when he left</p>
<p>the scene.</p>
<p>Finally, at 10 o&rsquo;clock that night, this is 10 hours after their bodies were first</p>
<p>discovered, an officer returned with the judge&rsquo;s signed warrant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning here that 10 hours is an unusually long time for a homicide detective</p>
<p>to get a warrant, because medical examiners and crime scene techs have to wait to get</p>
<p>access to a murder scene.</p>
<p>In most cases, investigators take control of a scene within an hour.</p>
<p>But Phoenix PD didn&rsquo;t offer any explanation for what took so long in this case.</p>
<p>Anyway, with a search warrant in hand, the forensic part of the investigation finally</p>
<p>got underway.</p>
<p>The inside of the house didn&rsquo;t present any obvious clues about what had happened to the</p>
<p>women.</p>
<p>The TV in the living room was still on, no rooms appeared to have been ransacked, and</p>
<p>there were no signs of forced entry or a struggle.</p>
<p>Outside, the usually quiet cul-de-sac had become chaotic.</p>
<p>TV news crews had started to show up and began doing live reports from the street while officers</p>
<p>went door-to-door to interview neighbors.</p>
<p>By talking to one neighbor, police learned that Nicole had moved into her house in 2006,</p>
<p>and that she and Bebe liked to host parties that usually went late into the night.</p>
<p>But none of the neighbors reported seeing or hearing anything unusual in the last couple</p>
<p>of days.</p>
<p>Another neighbor told police that the day before, on December 2nd, she observed something</p>
<p>a little out of the usual that kind of stood out.</p>
<p>Contractors were lugging extension cords and buckets to and from the house sometime between</p>
<p>3 and 4 p.m.</p>
<p>That actually made sense, though, because Melissa had also told detectives that Nicole</p>
<p>was having the floors in the house refinished and had hired a crew to get the two- or three-day</p>
<p>job done.</p>
<p>While detectives worked to track down the names of the men who&rsquo;d worked on the floors,</p>
<p>About 35 miles east of Phoenix, in Apache Junction, Nicole Glass&rsquo; mother, Rachel Glass,</p>
<p>had just gotten home from work when a friend called and urged her to turn on the local</p>
<p>news immediately.</p>
<p>When Rachel tuned into the news broadcast, she was lost for words.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I turned it on and there it was, their house.</p>
<p>They said two 27-year-old women were dead inside the house.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t see a sign of forced entry.</p>
<p>Of course, you know, they didn&rsquo;t say their names, but it&rsquo;s Nicole&rsquo;s car is first, Melissa&rsquo;s</p>
<p>car is second.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Nicole&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both 27.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>You know, that was really very destructive, very destructive to myself and my family.</p>
<p>While she drove the roughly 40 minutes to Nicole&rsquo;s house with her husband, Rachel</p>
<p>called the police department to confirm what she knew in her gut to be true.</p>
<p>But the dispatcher wouldn&rsquo;t confirm anything over the phone.</p>
<p>As she pulled up to her daughter&rsquo;s house, which was now clearly an active crime scene,</p>
<p>the sight of yellow tape and police cruisers confirmed her worst fears.</p>
<p>When she told officers working in the scene who she was, they couldn&rsquo;t tell her much.</p>
<p>It was late and Rachel was in the dark as to what had happened inside her daughter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p>She and her husband left and booked a hotel room just down the street.</p>
<p>She wanted to be nearby when police had more information to share.</p>
<p>So she went to bed that night, but she said she barely slept.</p>
<p>And then around 3 a.m., she said police called with official word that her daughter was dead.</p>
<p>Then I needed to find a funeral home.</p>
<p>Hell, I was hoping I would be planning a wedding, not a funeral, you know, because she was,</p>
<p>She was that age where I kept thinking she&rsquo;s going to find somebody, she&rsquo;s going to get</p>
<p>married, but it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Phoenix police publicly identified Nicole and Bebe on Saturday, December 4th.</p>
<p>In a short news brief buried in the Sunday edition of the Arizona Republic, the story</p>
<p>painted a picture of a community unsure of how to process the murders.</p>
<p>The story noted that later that weekend, Nicole and Bebe&rsquo;s neighbors were in the cul-de-sac</p>
<p>hanging up holiday decorations and talking openly about how shocking it was to have had</p>
<p>a triple murder happen merely feet from their own homes.</p>
<p>The next few days were important ones for the investigation.</p>
<p>The police worked to interview anyone who knew Nicole and Bebe, and they finished processing</p>
<p>the scene and worked to get phone records.</p>
<p>Through interviews, they learned more about each of the women.</p>
<p>Their friends told police that Nicole and Bebe had met a few years earlier working as</p>
<p>bartenders and had pretty big social circles.</p>
<p>But that much had already become apparent to police because it seemed like every person</p>
<p>they interviewed gave them the names of more friends to track down.</p>
<p>Detectives also learned from their friends that beyond their bartending jobs, which paid</p>
<p>the bills, Bebe had her sights set on becoming a dental hygienist while Nicole was going</p>
<p>to school and was a third-year student working toward a degree in communications.</p>
<p>Police also learned that aside from the well-attended parties, their house was just a place where</p>
<p>people were comfortable and liked to spend time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Rostenberg again.</p>
<p>We learned that they were loved by many.</p>
<p>They had a lot of friends.</p>
<p>They were gregarious.</p>
<p>They were outgoing.</p>
<p>Everyone that we interviewed about the girls had nothing but good things to say about what</p>
<p>kind, caring people.</p>
<p>They would go out of their way to help others.</p>
<p>They would let people, you know, stay at the house that were having financial problems</p>
<p>or issues or whatever.</p>
<p>They were just good friends and they were good people.</p>
<p>Interviews with the women&rsquo;s friends were helpful in learning about the women&rsquo;s lifestyles</p>
<p>and routines, but the interviews weren&rsquo;t revealing any obvious reasons why anyone would</p>
<p>want them dead.</p>
<p>But later that same day, after their names had been announced to the public, a man named</p>
<p>Jose called the Phoenix Police Department&rsquo;s Violent Crimes Bureau and said that he was</p>
<p>good friends with the women and that he had been at their house the day before they were</p>
<p>killed.</p>
<p>And he had some information that he thought might be helpful to detectives.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t arrange a meeting with him for a few days, so in the meantime, they went</p>
<p>to try and get surveillance video from a few different places, trying to see if there were</p>
<p>any cameras that had an angle of the alley behind the women&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>And they even checked a few nearby intersections, but every time they struck out.</p>
<p>It was later that week when police finally met up with Jose at his house, and this was</p>
<p>his story.</p>
<p>He said that on December 2nd, he went to visit Nicole and Bebe, which was normal.</p>
<p>He said they were all friends and hung out often.</p>
<p>Jose said both women were home, along with a guy named Johnny who was working to refinish</p>
<p>the floors.</p>
<p>Jose said when he first got there, Nicole was up and about cleaning the house while</p>
<p>Bebe was lounging on the couch because she wasn&rsquo;t feeling very good.</p>
<p>He thought Bebe had complained about maybe suffering from morning sickness.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s where things get interesting.</p>
<p>Jose told detectives that upon his arrival, Nicole asked him to take out the garbage.</p>
<p>Nicole told Jose that he would have to walk around the block to get to the alley to take</p>
<p>the trash out because the key to her backyard gate was missing.</p>
<p>Jose jokingly was like, no way am I walking all the way around the block just to take</p>
<p>out your trash.</p>
<p>And so Nicole was like, okay, fine.</p>
<p>Well, then could you just make yourself actually useful and remove the lock to the back gate</p>
<p>so we can at least use it?</p>
<p>So Jose agreed to remove the lock later in the day.</p>
<p>He told police that he hung out for about an hour and at some point during that time,</p>
<p>two more workers showed up to help Johnny with the floors, though he didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>have any interaction with any of them.</p>
<p>Eventually the two women told him that they had to leave for what he called a girl doctor</p>
<p>appointment.</p>
<p>And they invited him to tag along, but he declined saying that he&rsquo;s going to wait at</p>
<p>their house with the workers and then get to work removing that lock on the back gate.</p>
<p>It took him about an hour to remove the screws.</p>
<p>And eventually he broke the lock off the gate with a hammer.</p>
<p>Jose said that he placed the lock on the kitchen counter so Nicole would see it when she got</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p>He tried to hang around a little longer, even tried calling the two women after they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been gone a while, but neither of them answered.</p>
<p>So he said that he left and went to a different friend&rsquo;s house to hang out the rest of the</p>
<p>day before going home that night.</p>
<p>Now Jose&rsquo;s comment about the lock immediately made police wonder if Nicole and BB&rsquo;s killer</p>
<p>or killers entered and exited through the unlocked gate from the alley and backyard.</p>
<p>Or maybe the killer or killers had the missing key to the gate, intending to use it not knowing</p>
<p>the lock was removed.</p>
<p>Jose told investigators that he didn&rsquo;t remember Nicole saying where she thought the missing</p>
<p>key might be or if she knew who had it.</p>
<p>He insisted that he didn&rsquo;t have any contact with the women after he left their place on</p>
<p>December 2nd.</p>
<p>And the next day, his brother called him to let him know that the women had been murdered.</p>
<p>But what Jose did have was a business card for Johnny, the worker who&rsquo;d been refinishing</p>
<p>the floors at Nicole&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>And in an effort to fully cooperate, Jose also provided his DNA to police.</p>
<p>The next day, detectives located Johnny and interviewed him.</p>
<p>According to police reports, Johnny told police that Nicole had found his floor polishing</p>
<p>business online back in the fall.</p>
<p>He provided her an estimate in October and the work started December 1st.</p>
<p>He said they were there the full day and then came back on the second at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>When they arrived, BB was home alone.</p>
<p>Johnny told detectives that during the few days that he and his crew were there, he noticed</p>
<p>that Nicole came and went pretty often with several different visitors.</p>
<p>But she always said that she was going to Walmart, though she never returned with any</p>
<p>bags.</p>
<p>Johnny also described several different people, all in different cars, arriving and leaving</p>
<p>at various times during the duration of his work.</p>
<p>And listen, I know how this sounds, but police couldn&rsquo;t say who these people were or what</p>
<p>business Nicole had with so many visitors.</p>
<p>Investigators definitely know more than they&rsquo;re sharing, but we kind of have to accept that</p>
<p>they probably have a good reason for not wanting the public to know this kind of information.</p>
<p>Johnny told police that he was supposed to finish the job at Nicole&rsquo;s house on the morning</p>
<p>of the 3rd, but that another job in Glendale was going to prevent them from showing up</p>
<p>on time.</p>
<p>So he left Nicole a message saying that they&rsquo;d be over sometime the next day on the 4th to</p>
<p>make up for it.</p>
<p>But he never heard back.</p>
<p>Despite leaving her several voicemails, Johnny said Nicole didn&rsquo;t answer and never returned</p>
<p>his calls.</p>
<p>So the workers showed up around noon on Saturday anyway, prepared to work.</p>
<p>But when they arrived, police and reporters were still all over the place.</p>
<p>Johnny said the officers wouldn&rsquo;t let his workers approach the home.</p>
<p>When detectives asked Johnny what else he noticed when spending time at Nicole&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>he said it seemed like the women were very trusting because they would always leave the</p>
<p>door unlocked when they weren&rsquo;t there, and they felt fine with Johnny and his crew being</p>
<p>there even when they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like everyone before him, Johnny agreed to give police a DNA sample, and detectives went</p>
<p>on to interview Johnny&rsquo;s workers, who also happened to be his siblings.</p>
<p>In separate interviews, Johnny&rsquo;s brother and sister gave similar statements as Johnny,</p>
<p>and they also agreed to provide DNA.</p>
<p>It was around this time that the medical examiner finally concluded that both Nicole and Bebe</p>
<p>were strangled, and the office confirmed that their manners of death were homicide.</p>
<p>The ME also confirmed Bebe&rsquo;s pregnancy.</p>
<p>Both women had defensive wounds, which suggested that there was a struggle leading up to their</p>
<p>deaths.</p>
<p>Detective Rostenberg said that while there was no evidence the women were sexually assaulted,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean it didn&rsquo;t occur, though he wouldn&rsquo;t say anything more about that.</p>
<p>But I kind of have to assume that they were able to collect some sort of biological evidence</p>
<p>to test against all the swabs that they were collecting from witnesses.</p>
<p>The ME&rsquo;s ruling made police ponder more possibilities, because Nicole and Bebe were young, healthy,</p>
<p>and fit.</p>
<p>Investigators had to figure out if the killer somehow detained one of the women while he</p>
<p>killed the other, or if there were multiple killers working in tandem.</p>
<p>Now that the community knew the women&rsquo;s names and how brutal their murders were, news coverage</p>
<p>picked up again.</p>
<p>On December 13th, 2010, barely two weeks after Bebe and Nicole were killed, Bebe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother, Sandra Menares, who lives in Tucson, told reporters, quote,</p>
<p>Not only did they take my daughter&rsquo;s life, but they also took my unborn grandbaby.</p>
<p>And that would have been the first, end quote.</p>
<p>What made her statement even more heartbreaking, according to reports by the Associated Press</p>
<p>at the time, was that Bebe&rsquo;s mother was holding her daughter&rsquo;s positive pregnancy</p>
<p>test as she spoke to reporters.</p>
<p>Police had found the positive test at the house inside a plastic baggie with Merry Christmas</p>
<p>scrawled in black marker.</p>
<p>I know when Melissa found out she was pregnant, she was really excited about the pregnancy</p>
<p>and I know they were looking forward to having the child and Melissa was looking forward</p>
<p>to telling her parents around Christmas time that she was pregnant.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s horrible all the way around.</p>
<p>The renewed publicity garnered a few more tips for police, and on December 14th, a woman</p>
<p>called in and said detectives should interview Bebe&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>The caller said that the two had dated earlier in 2010, and that he&rsquo;d previously stalked</p>
<p>her and threatened to kill her, and that if he&rsquo;d known Bebe was pregnant with another</p>
<p>man&rsquo;s child, it may have set him off.</p>
<p>Tracking down Bebe&rsquo;s ex wasn&rsquo;t easy, but police finally arranged to interview him in</p>
<p>early 2011.</p>
<p>The man, who we&rsquo;re gonna call Frank, said he and Bebe were engaged to be married, but</p>
<p>eventually they went their separate ways.</p>
<p>But before they broke up, they lived with Nicole for a little while, and Frank said</p>
<p>that he never liked how many men were hanging around.</p>
<p>He said they would come and go and it made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Frank said that after they split, he and Bebe stayed friends, but he had no idea that she</p>
<p>was pregnant with Marquise&rsquo;s baby until after Bebe&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Frank admitted to police that he wasn&rsquo;t happy to hear that because Bebe hadn&rsquo;t been dating</p>
<p>Marquise very long, and in his opinion, it was too soon for them to start a family together.</p>
<p>But Frank denied having ever threatened Bebe, and he denied having anything to do with the</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s murders.</p>
<p>When asked what he thought happened to them, he basically told police the same thing Marquise</p>
<p>did.</p>
<p>Nicole must have been the target, not Bebe.</p>
<p>Frank also agreed to provide his DNA, and he gave detectives the names of a few more</p>
<p>men that they should interview.</p>
<p>Detectives worked over the next several weeks to interview the friends of the women.</p>
<p>And every time they interviewed someone, they collected their DNA and were given more and</p>
<p>more names of additional people to talk to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the women had a never-ending list of friends, mainly through their work</p>
<p>in the Phoenix area service industry.</p>
<p>I can tell you several people were interviewed as far as that previously dated both Melissa</p>
<p>and Nicole.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to look at these people, but as of this time, we have no probable cause</p>
<p>to believe that there&rsquo;s arrest as imminent with any of these people.</p>
<p>None of the interviews provided a clear suspect or motive.</p>
<p>Police were pretty certain it wasn&rsquo;t a robbery that resulted in the women being killed.</p>
<p>They figured it had to be more personal than that.</p>
<p>Not long after that, the case went cold.</p>
<p>In 2016, four years after the murders, Nicole&rsquo;s family decided to hire their own private investigator</p>
<p>to drum up some new leads.</p>
<p>In that same year, the PI actually got an interesting tip, suggesting that while on</p>
<p>probation for a minor drug charge, Nicole was a confidential informant for Phoenix police.</p>
<p>If it was true, it made her family wonder if she was targeted for snitching.</p>
<p>Now Rachel says that police wouldn&rsquo;t say one way or another, so frustrated and desperate</p>
<p>for answers, she took them to court and officials finally were compelled to answer.</p>
<p>And police said no, Nicole was not a CI for their department.</p>
<p>Over the years, detectives have revisited persons of interest in the case, which is</p>
<p>basically everyone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve even conducted polygraph tests.</p>
<p>But Detective Rostenberg said not everyone involved is as forthcoming as they used to be.</p>
<p>I can tell you that some of them were initially cooperative and they&rsquo;re not so cooperative now.</p>
<p>That could mean they&rsquo;re just frustrated, they&rsquo;re angry, they&rsquo;re dealing with this in their own way.</p>
<p>Detective Rostenberg said the pool of physical evidence in the case has remained pretty much</p>
<p>unchanged from 2010, which in turn has stalled the investigation, which he summed up as quote</p>
<p>forensically tapped.</p>
<p>Police have remained in regular contact with the women&rsquo;s families who still call them</p>
<p>sometimes to check on the case or to offer insight on people they should speak with.</p>
<p>Over the years, Nicole&rsquo;s mother Rachel has remained especially vocal in advocating for</p>
<p>her daughter.</p>
<p>Rachel still lives in the same Apache Junction home that she did when Nicole and Bebe were</p>
<p>killed in 2010.</p>
<p>When our team visited her, Rachel beamed with pride as she talked about the close relationship</p>
<p>she shared with Nicole.</p>
<p>She had a big personality.</p>
<p>She was the kind of girl that when she walked into the room that everybody go, Nicole&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>Yeah, our family get togethers, you know, they just, they all miss her.</p>
<p>We all miss her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Rachel gushed about Nicole&rsquo;s natural ability to command a room and to connect with basically</p>
<p>anyone who crossed her path.</p>
<p>She was absolutely darling.</p>
<p>And she just attracted people like flies to honey, you know, I mean, that&rsquo;s just the way</p>
<p>she was.</p>
<p>And even when she was in high school, my God, at her funeral, there was a lot of people</p>
<p>from high school that she went to school with that came.</p>
<p>I was, I was really happy about that.</p>
<p>Talking about her daughter has become easier with the passing of time, but Rachel still</p>
<p>aches to know who killed her daughter and why.</p>
<p>Until then, she&rsquo;ll try and keep her daughter&rsquo;s memory alive.</p>
<p>My grief has changed.</p>
<p>I had friends that have done counseling and that they said, Rachel, lean into the pain</p>
<p>because there is another side to it.</p>
<p>And honestly, I didn&rsquo;t believe them.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t believe that there was another side to grief where like, you could get to the</p>
<p>point where you could talk about it and not break down in tears.</p>
<p>It is beyond time to find some answers for these women.</p>
<p>If you knew or were an acquaintance or friend of theirs and think that you have helpful</p>
<p>information, or listen, any information at all about the December, 2010 murders of Nicole</p>
<p>Glass and Melissa Beebe Mason in Phoenix, Arizona, please contact Detective Dom Rostenberg</p>
<p>at 602-534-5920.</p>
