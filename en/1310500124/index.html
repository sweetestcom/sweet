    <p>I&rsquo;ve been at a loss of words but not at a loss of thoughts and memories when I learned that my</p>
<p>grandmother passed away several days ago. I thought I would try to use this microphone,</p>
<p>use this podcast, to try to find the words to honor the woman who&rsquo;s responsible for much of</p>
<p>who I am. Who taught me, silly might be to say, but taught me how to be a man.</p>
<p>Taught me about strength, about wisdom, about compassion, love, and that I could do anything</p>
<p>that I set my mind to in this world. That anything was possible and that I, of all people, can do it</p>
<p>and not to let the world tell me otherwise. She passed away in Moscow, Russia. She was 91 years</p>
<p>old, soon to be 92. If you&rsquo;re listening to this, maybe the first words I can say is,</p>
<p>at any moment, life can end. So tell your friends, tell your family, your loved ones,</p>
<p>that you love them. So I tried to write the words. I couldn&rsquo;t. I have some disparate notes,</p>
<p>but I decided to just speak about some lessons that she taught me,</p>
<p>and I hope that it&rsquo;s useful to some of you, to anyone who might be listening.</p>
<p>The first lesson is to be mentally strong, never to complain. And her life was one heck of a life</p>
<p>to test that lesson. She was born and raised near Kharkov, which is a Ukrainian city close to Russia.</p>
<p>In her childhood, she lived through and survived Galdamor, which is a famine in the early 30s,</p>
<p>1932, 1933, that Stalin had inflicted on his own people, where millions of people have died.</p>
<p>One of the great atrocities of the 20th century. Just to give you some context,</p>
<p>the famine that we&rsquo;re talking about led to cannibalism.</p>
<p>One historian has written that the good people died first, the people who gave food to others,</p>
<p>the people who refused to participate in cannibalism, the people who gave everything</p>
<p>they have to their children for the survival of their children, and therefore died before</p>
<p>their children did. I&rsquo;ll leave it at that. My grandma survived it. She was a very good</p>
<p>woman. My grandma survived it. And as a teenager, she lived through and survived World War II.</p>
<p>Imagine a young teenage girl, a beautiful young woman in fascist-occupied city.</p>
<p>She rarely spoke of those times, but there were stories of no food, desperation,</p>
<p>and tragedy. And once again, I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that. My grandmother survived.</p>
<p>And in her eyes always remained this glimmer of hope amidst the suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a glimmer that I&rsquo;ve seen in the eyes of others that I&rsquo;ve met in my life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just always inspiring to see that triumph, that triumph over tragedy. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that kind of experience does to the human heart. It hardens it, it protects it from</p>
<p>the outside world, but it also softens it to allow a deep connection with other human beings.</p>
<p>And maybe you&rsquo;ve seen that I&rsquo;ve done a few things with David Goggins,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m drawn to that kind of mindset. In him, I see my grandmother,</p>
<p>the toughest human being I&rsquo;ve ever known. The second lesson she taught me was physical strength.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of images throughout my childhood of my grandmother doing incredible</p>
<p>feats of manual labor, carrying logs, just carrying heavy things without complaining,</p>
<p>just getting the job done. I was a huge fan in Russia, there&rsquo;s something called Bogatiry Bogatyr.</p>
<p>I guess similar to America, that would be&hellip; America doesn&rsquo;t have centuries of history to</p>
<p>where you can go to the period of knights or Vikings. So in America, I guess for a little</p>
<p>kid, that would be like a G.I. Joe. But in Russia, Bogatiry were kind of like the knights</p>
<p>or maybe the Vikings, the warriors of ancient history. And I&rsquo;ve always loved the stoicism,</p>
<p>the power, the fearlessness of the stories told about Bogatiry. I mean, as a little kid,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all I wanted to be is one of those guys. And I remember at a certain point in my childhood,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite place exactly the time, but I remember realizing, looking at my grandmother,</p>
<p>that women could be those warriors as well. My little boy&rsquo;s brain and whatever toys we had,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d play with. And I always imagined that Bogatiry were boys, men going out to war.</p>
<p>And when they return as victors home, they&rsquo;d be celebrated by the women, the children of their</p>
<p>family. But my grandmother made me realize that women could be Bogatiry too. But more than that,</p>
<p>she was this figure in my life that planted that Eastern European seed of admiring strength and</p>
<p>physical power and just toughness in a very basic sense that&rsquo;s required to carry heavy things</p>
<p>and to fight. I think if I were to really psychoanalyze myself at that early age is when</p>
<p>I fell in love with martial arts, with the whole concept of martial combat before I ever, ever</p>
<p>practiced anything like it. The kind of sports I played as a kid with soccer and tennis and</p>
<p>swimming, all that kind of stuff were very far away from martial combat. But she planted the</p>
<p>seed that when I first stepped on the wrestling mat, it felt like home. And even for the first</p>
<p>couple of years when I really had my ass handed to me on the mat, the fire that got me to train</p>
<p>harder, to work harder, that was my grandmother. The third lesson is to think deeply, to be quiet</p>
<p>and think until you know the situation, you know the right thing to say. And the right thing to say</p>
<p>is the one that internalizes, considers, and thinks through the big picture of the situation.</p>
<p>So the emotion you feel, especially when you&rsquo;re young about a particular situation,</p>
<p>the desire to be sort of a crybaby about things, about me, me, me, about being upset about this</p>
<p>situation or that situation, there was something about the way she was quiet and the way she looked</p>
<p>over the world. And the moments when she spoke were words of wisdom, of calm and patience.</p>
<p>That was so inspiring to a mind that was impatient. She helped me understand that the</p>
<p>immediate emotional response to particular situations, the ups and downs of how you feel,</p>
<p>influence the perception, the cognition of how everything&rsquo;s interpreted, and taking your time,</p>
<p>thinking, being quiet, and speaking when you have something to say is the kind of man I should be.</p>
<p>Fourth lesson she taught me was to believe in myself. She made me believe that I&rsquo;m the most</p>
<p>special person in the world and that I can achieve anything. And then she would tell me that</p>
<p>since I was a little baby until I was a big baby. And her excitement about the little successes in</p>
<p>my life really made me fall in love with the successes of others. She inspired me to enjoy</p>
<p>the success of others, to believe in the people around me, to encourage them to dream big,</p>
<p>to dream big, to work hard, to accomplish anything, because she did that for me.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s heartbreaking to think that very few people in my life believed in me.</p>
<p>I was always a dreamer. I reached for the stars. And most people, even people who loved me,</p>
<p>gave me what they thought was wise advice, to stick to the safe path, to be reasonable, to</p>
<p>find stability, comfort, all those kinds of things that seem wise in the grand scheme of life,</p>
<p>to be normal. And she didn&rsquo;t. She told me to go big, to dream big,</p>
<p>to dream big, and that I could accomplish anything I wanted to.</p>
<p>Everyone is different. And I&rsquo;m not a parent. And I think that kind of over-the-top encouragement can</p>
<p>perhaps spoil some people or give them a false sense of ego. But for somebody like me,</p>
<p>who was genetically full of self-doubt, and forgive me for saying, even disliking myself,</p>
<p>she was a breath of fresh air. And so whatever dream I have now that still stays with me</p>
<p>stays with me, is the fire she kindled, is the fire she kept going, and a fire that</p>
<p>will never die because of her. Over the past several years, it&rsquo;s been many days that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grinding to a halt with self-doubt. I feel that in all kinds of ways, I&rsquo;m a fraud</p>
<p>for daring to dream, to go outside of what I&rsquo;m supposed to do, what other people much</p>
<p>smarter than me are telling me I&rsquo;m supposed to do. In those moments, when I say I listen to my heart,</p>
<p>I listen to my gut, I really listen to the thing that my grandmother left me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that fire, the belief in myself that I can do anything, that the dreams I have</p>
<p>are not just silly dreams. They&rsquo;re visions of a future that I can create. If I work hard,</p>
<p>I can create.</p>
<p>And finally, the fifth lesson she taught me through words, through her actions,</p>
<p>is about love, is to put love out into the world.</p>
<p>Her husband, Grandpa Gregory, died when he was 58.</p>
<p>Grandpa Gregory died when he was 58 in 1986. She loved him her whole life. She loved him</p>
<p>after he passed away. And that love, while quiet in terms of her not talking to me about it,</p>
<p>was always there in the background, was always in her eyes, the unshakable love.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the love between her and her husband, my grandfather. There&rsquo;s something about loyalty,</p>
<p>about deep, unshakable human connection in that, that stayed with me. I seek that kind of love with</p>
<p>friends, with really close friends. I seek that kind of love with the world around me,</p>
<p>and I definitely seek that kind of love with a life partner.</p>
<p>With a person that I could, how does the saying goes, ride or die with. I can bury the bodies</p>
<p>with them. It&rsquo;s kind of a bond that&rsquo;s stronger than any other thing in this world, a bond that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stronger than any fundamental force of physics. I could see it in her, and something in that</p>
<p>stayed with me. But bigger, just love, love of life, love of the ups and downs of life,</p>
<p>love and gratitude of everything around me. She had that, this glowing joy. That&rsquo;s not a simple</p>
<p>joy, but a deep joy that acknowledges that life is suffering, that life is hard, and that love is</p>
<p>hard, but to appreciate it anyway, the whole of it, not just the ups, the whole of it.</p>
<p>She taught me to love people, love life, love the world, no matter what the world does to you,</p>
<p>and to love unconditionally, simply, and to not be afraid to be cliche, to be</p>
<p>simple, naive, because that&rsquo;s what love is. It&rsquo;s quite simple.</p>
<p>Love is the answer, as some guy on some podcast once said.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to honor this woman that was a great human being in my life and the life of many others</p>
<p>with these words, and the few folks who listen, I hope, can draw some inspiration from the lessons</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s given me, to be strong mentally and physically, to dream big, to work hard,</p>
<p>and to put a little bit of love out into the world. And on that point, let me, if it&rsquo;s okay,</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple poem that a couple of Russians listening out there right now</p>
<p>perhaps could appreciate, but the gist of it is that love is not easy, life is not easy,</p>
<p>and the best we ought to do is to learn how to treasure love, to treasure the few years of life</p>
<p>we have on this earth. My grandmother&rsquo;s name is Anne, and my brother and I in Russian would</p>
<p>call her affectionately, –±–∞–±–∞–Ω—è. So, –±–∞–±–∞–Ω—å, —è —É–∂–µ —Å–∫—É—á–∞—é.</p>
<p>–Ø —É–∂–µ —Å–∫—É—á–∞—é. I promise I will work hard and hope that your strength,</p>
<p>your brilliance, your love lives on in my thoughts and in my actions.</p>
<p>This drop of vodka is for you.</p>
<p>You know, I have shot glasses, but I think she&rsquo;s looking down and</p>
<p>knows I&rsquo;m drinking in her memory, so she would want me to drink it out of a real glass. So,</p>
<p>–±–∞–±–∞–Ω—å, I miss you, I love you, I hope to make you proud one day.</p>
