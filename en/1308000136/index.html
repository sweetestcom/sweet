    <p>Oh, J Cal&rsquo;s here. Hello, J Cal.</p>
<p>Hey, how are you?</p>
<p>Thanks for showing up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been here the whole time. I was just, I was just having some of these beautiful</p>
<p>salted roasted pistachios. The only problem is when I went to the store, I kid you not,</p>
<p>there was a shelf of these. All flavors available except one flavor.</p>
<p>Salt and vinegar.</p>
<p>Sea salt and vinegar.</p>
<p>The entire-</p>
<p>We moved the market. We moved the market.</p>
<p>I am not kidding. I go to the fancy, you know, bespoke-</p>
<p>The Raley&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>You went to the Raley&rsquo;s in Truckee?</p>
<p>I went to the Raley&rsquo;s in Truckee, the artisanal, and they have, you know, all these overpriced-</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s called artisanal?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I said. The art stuff. The artistic food. The artisanal row where they had this,</p>
<p>I kid you not, spicy, salty, no salt, every shelf packed. Then there&rsquo;s one shelf I can</p>
<p>see straight through to the ice cream.</p>
<p>But not sea salt and vinegar.</p>
<p>When I look at the tiny little sign, salt and vinegar. Shelled nuts.</p>
<p>Sea salt and vinegar.</p>
<p>Sea salt and vinegar. Chamat&rsquo;s shelled nuts. Sold out across the country.</p>
<p>You know, I cannot recommend these more highly. They&rsquo;re incredible.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t recommend your salty nuts, Marc?</p>
<p>They are delicious. My salty nuts are delicious.</p>
<p>Did you see Joe Manchin&rsquo;s high-heater op-ed in the Wall Street Journal?</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Yep. Joe Manchin went for it.</p>
<p>Joe Manchin&rsquo;s running for president.</p>
<p>He is. I think. Okay, so let me ask Sax right there. Sax, Joe Manchin,</p>
<p>Nikki Haley, and who&rsquo;s the guy from Florida?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your question?</p>
<p>By the way, there was a big defection that was leaked this week. Ron Lauder</p>
<p>flipped from Trump to DeSantis. That&rsquo;s a big one because Lauder&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>a lot of money. Five to 10 million at least.</p>
<p>Joe Manchin, what impact would he have coming into the race? I&rsquo;m not trolling you.</p>
<p>Looking for your honest opinion.</p>
<p>Well, it depends how he comes in. What did he say in the op-ed?</p>
<p>He was talking about the insincerity of the Biden administration to control costs and how</p>
<p>everybody was incompetent. And it certainly, there&rsquo;s some waste and we can control some</p>
<p>spending and everybody needs to grow up and get in a room and just manage the budget for</p>
<p>the American people and stop playing politics.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the headline of the article, actually, to your point, Jacob,</p>
<p>was much worse than the substance of the article, Saxe. But if you see the headline,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Nick, if you can just throw it up there, it was brutal. The headline and the</p>
<p>byline of the article, I think was more damaging than the substance of the article.</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s Inflation Reduction Act betrayal. Instead of implementing the law as intended,</p>
<p>his administration subverts it for ideological, ideological ends.</p>
<p>I have to think that Joe was responsible for that, for the titling of that article.</p>
<p>He would get permission to approve it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And by the way, I think if you guys remember, we talked about this when that act was first</p>
<p>published. And if you guys remember, I think I pulled up the CBO data, the CBO model, and it</p>
<p>showed for the first five years, this thing burns a couple hundred billion dollars. And then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some expectation that there&rsquo;ll be some sudden boom in revenue in the out years. And then you</p>
<p>make the money back in the out years. So it&rsquo;s total like accounting shenanigans for him to</p>
<p>have made the claim in the first place that the IRA was actually going to be like a net deficit</p>
<p>reduction, or debt reduction. In fact, it&rsquo;s all just accounting shenanigans. And it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>massive spend package, particularly in the near term when it matters most.</p>
<p>I think I told you guys this, but I think this was like, when was the last time I was in</p>
<p>Washington? Probably? What is it March now? So maybe it was January, I was there.</p>
<p>And I saw Schumer and Mark Warner, and I spent about two hours with Manchin. He is really</p>
<p>impressive. He&rsquo;s cool. He&rsquo;s interesting. He&rsquo;s thoughtful. He&rsquo;s moderate.</p>
<p>Manchin&rsquo;s like a formidable guy. So this will be really interesting if he steps in there and</p>
<p>tries to take it.</p>
<p>Between Nikki Haley and Manchin, where do you write your check?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably write a check to both, to be honest.</p>
<p>Feels like a good ticket to me. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to see the cross.</p>
<p>Could you imagine a Democrat and Republican merging somehow and like running together?</p>
<p>It would be the greatest.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pitching that for years. I think that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>clear path.</p>
<p>David Freeberg may have just come up with one of the most disruptive ideas in American</p>
<p>politics that&rsquo;s ever been floated. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Manchin Haley?</p>
<p>Haley Manchin.</p>
<p>Keep dreaming.</p>
<p>Manchin Haley, yeah.</p>
<p>Just my comment on this. So first of all, I remember when, you know, Manchin did a good</p>
<p>job stopping Biden&rsquo;s three and a half trillion dollar build back better. Remember, it was him</p>
<p>and Sinema that were the holdouts. But then Manchin compromised and gave Biden a $750</p>
<p>billion version of it. And I guess now he&rsquo;s complaining that Biden didn&rsquo;t live up to his</p>
<p>end of the bargain in doing the deficit reduction. But quite frankly, many commentators said at the</p>
<p>time that the bill&rsquo;s claims to deficit reduction were preposterous and that would never happen.</p>
<p>So quite frankly, you know, Manchin shouldn&rsquo;t have been euchared or hoodwinked by Biden.</p>
<p>Everyone was basically saying there&rsquo;ll never be any deficit reduction out of this bill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more spending. So I don&rsquo;t really feel bad for Manchin here saying that somehow</p>
<p>he was betrayed by Biden. He should have known better. Now, in terms of him running, yeah,</p>
<p>I think as a Democrat who&rsquo;s figured out how to get himself elected in West Virginia, which is a</p>
<p>plus 20 red state, he obviously knows how to appeal to the center. The problem for him is</p>
<p>just how do you get the Democratic Party nomination? Because he&rsquo;s far to the right</p>
<p>of your average Democratic Party voter. If he wants to run as an independent,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different story. And that would really throw a curveball into the race.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see him doing that. I think it&rsquo;s kind of a stretch. And</p>
<p>this is the problem with a lot of these fantasy candidates is that, you know,</p>
<p>centrist or moderate voters might like them, but they can&rsquo;t get the nomination of their party.</p>
<p>You mean like Trump and Obama, those who are fantasy candidates?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Trump was not a fantasy candidate. He&rsquo;s the ultimate fantasy candidate.</p>
<p>Well, he was an outsider, but he appealed to the base of the party. He appealed to the base of</p>
<p>the party. What I&rsquo;m saying is in order to get the nomination of a major party, you have to</p>
<p>appeal to its base. And I don&rsquo;t think Manchin appeals to the base of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s out of step with it. He&rsquo;s out of step with it in ways that I like, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>But I just, I don&rsquo;t see how he&rsquo;s going to get a nomination.</p>
<p>Chris Christie, what do you think of him? It seems like he&rsquo;s about to come in the race too, David.</p>
<p>Pointless.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s viable?</p>
<p>Pointless.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just clutter.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Pointless. All right. Listen, everybody, welcome to the all-in podcast. It&rsquo;s like episode 100</p>
<p>something. With me again today, the rain man himself. Yeah. David Sachs is here. Friedberg</p>
<p>is in his garden at his home in Paris. Spring has sprung, the queen of quinoa. And of course,</p>
<p>the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, the silver fox. Look at that little tuft of</p>
<p>silver hair. So distinguished.</p>
<p>I got a haircut from somebody recently who said that people go to her and ask her to put the</p>
<p>silver thing in their hair. Really?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Friedberg looks like he&rsquo;s in Smurf Village there. What is, what is that background?</p>
<p>That is a scene from&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>I like most of my backgrounds.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the mood and the moment of the week.</p>
<p>You guys just totally, totally denied half the beta males in the YouTube comments from being</p>
<p>able to guess what the background was. Thanks a lot, Sachs.</p>
<p>He ruined it for them.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I did a reverse image search, and then I used a chat GPT plugin to automatically</p>
<p>figure out Friedberg&rsquo;s background each week.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. All right. Well, let&rsquo;s get started. Come on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started. Okay, listen.</p>
<p>Look at Sachs. I gotta get out of here.</p>
<p>The alpha&rsquo;s spoken. The alpha&rsquo;s spoken.</p>
<p>Sachs feels like he&rsquo;s in a good mood. I like this.</p>
<p>Welcome to the World&rsquo;s Greatest Podcast.</p>
<p>OpenAI launched a bunch of chat GPT plugins, and I don&rsquo;t know if you saw it,</p>
<p>but David Sachs wrote a blog post with chat GPT. It&rsquo;s an amazing back and forth.</p>
<p>I read this back and forth. Explain what you did, Sachs.</p>
<p>This was really one of the best conversations I&rsquo;ve seen with chat GPT.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll pop it up here on the screen, but explain what you did.</p>
<p>Well, I had an idea for a blog post about the use of a, I guess, tactic you could call give to get.</p>
<p>I thought it would be an interesting tactic for AI startups to use if they&rsquo;re trying to get a hold</p>
<p>of proprietary training data. For example, if you wanted to create an architect AI,</p>
<p>you need a lot of plans. If you&rsquo;re going to create a doctor AI, you need a lot of lab results or</p>
<p>medical reports to train the AI on, and those are hard to get. OpenAI doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have them</p>
<p>yet. There is an opportunity, I think, for startups to create these AIs in different,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d call them professional verticals. The give to get technique would be, you give points to</p>
<p>your users for uploading that data, and then they can spend those points by using the AI.</p>
<p>Anyway, the company that came up with this give to get tactic was a company called Jigsaw</p>
<p>almost 20 years ago. No one remembers this company. I&rsquo;m dating myself because I remembered it,</p>
<p>but I just had this idea, gee, I wonder if the Jigsaw approach could be used for AI startups.</p>
<p>I started by going into ChatGPT, and I said, hey, have you heard of Jigsaw? Then it had.</p>
<p>Then I said, tell me about its give to get approach. Then I said, would this approach work</p>
<p>for AI startups that want proprietary training data sets? It said, yes, this is a good idea.</p>
<p>Then I gave the architect example, and I said, can you give me more examples like this? It gave me</p>
<p>like 20 more examples. Then I asked it just to flesh out various kinds of details. I went down</p>
<p>some cul-de-sacs that I didn&rsquo;t use. Then at the end, I said, can you summarize everything we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just talked about in a blog post? It gave me the first draft of a blog post. I then did a</p>
<p>substantial amount of editing on most of the blog posts, although some of it I just used verbatim.</p>
<p>Then I had a couple of people in my firm look at it. They made some good suggestions, so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like the human&rsquo;s completely out of the loop. Then I copy and pasted my edited version back into</p>
<p>ChatGPT, said, here&rsquo;s my edit. Then I asked for some suggestions. It made a few small edits.</p>
<p>I said, okay, great, just incorporate the edits yourself, gave me that final output.</p>
<p>Then I posted on Substack, a blog that probably would have taken me a week to research and write.</p>
<p>If I had done it at all, I was able to do in a day. I can&rsquo;t see myself going back now. I think</p>
<p>this is just how I&rsquo;m going to write all my blog posts, is use ChatGPT as my researcher,</p>
<p>as a writing partner, some cases an editor, but I&rsquo;m definitely going to run it through.</p>
<p>The thing that I was struck by was just how kind and generous and thoughtful this conversation was.</p>
<p>I just thought, I&rsquo;ve never seen Sax have a conversation where he was so kind to the</p>
<p>other person and thoughtful. Right about now, all your friends and family are like,</p>
<p>how do we get Sax to have this conversation with us? You were super kind to the AI.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not a person, it was a robot.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Well, just in case it takes over the world, J-Cal, you can&rsquo;t be too careful. No, I think,</p>
<p>listen, it&rsquo;s important to give the AI-</p>
<p>Look at him, he&rsquo;s so kind. He&rsquo;s like, oh, perfect, thanks.</p>
<p>Perfect, thanks, exclamation mark.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never once gotten a thanks from Sax.</p>
<p>Well, show that example, actually.</p>
<p>Scroll up and show that example. The AI actually gave me some information about Jigsaw&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>system. Again, the rewards that they used. And it was just in text. So I said down below, hey,</p>
<p>can you spit that out as a table? And it did, instantly, perfectly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a day&rsquo;s work, right? You would have to have an analyst or researcher do a day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And then I just screenshot of that and I made it an exhibit in my blog post.</p>
<p>But you also said thank you. And then it was delightful back to you. I mean, this is a-</p>
<p>Yes, it was delightful back to me.</p>
<p>This is a literal road to you being a kind human being. All the money that you&rsquo;ve spent on therapy</p>
<p>and just trying coaching to be nice to people, you&rsquo;re just nice, naturally.</p>
<p>No, J. Cal, J. Cal, Sax is in a good mood today. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re instigating him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s laughing. Come on, it&rsquo;s fun. You have to admit it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>Sax saying thank you to the AI. Perfect.</p>
<p>This is confirmatory of what we know. David wants to live in a set of highly</p>
<p>transactional relationships, ideally with a machine,</p>
<p>who can then eventually help him make him money.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question? Sincerely, Sax. What did you enjoy more,</p>
<p>working with your team of humans on this or working with Chet JPT? Which one was</p>
<p>more enjoyable for you, just personally? Well, I think they both were. I would say</p>
<p>that the human contributions were essential. So basically-</p>
<p>Okay. But what did you enjoy more?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about enjoyment. This is just a job to get done, but it definitely sped things up</p>
<p>enormously. I personally find the hardest part of writing a blog is when you&rsquo;re staring at that</p>
<p>blank sheet of paper and just having to spit out the first thousand words. It&rsquo;s just so time</p>
<p>consuming to do that. But again, if you start with the first draft, even if it&rsquo;s not very good,</p>
<p>then you can just edit it and it speeds things up a lot.</p>
<p>Ideation. It&rsquo;s great for ideation.</p>
<p>But the contributions of people on my firm were important. I actually trusted it. I know that you</p>
<p>probably should fact check it in a way because it can hallucinate. But the things that we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>made so much sense to me that I didn&rsquo;t think it was hallucinating.</p>
<p>Well, this is a great moment to pivot into what OpenAI did with plugins. These came fast and</p>
<p>furious this week. And a bunch of folks who had started verticalized Chet JPT-based projects,</p>
<p>MVPs were like, oh, maybe my project MVP is now dead because Instacart, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack,</p>
<p>Zapier, and Zapier, obviously, like if then this, then that is a very wide ranging tool that allows</p>
<p>you to connect APIs from a multitude of sources. And what this all lets you do at the end of the</p>
<p>day is have Chet GPT ping one of these sources, just like an app might do or some custom software</p>
<p>might do ping the API and return data. So hey, what tables are open on OpenTable?</p>
<p>Maybe Shopify, find me things to buy in this category, etc. And so people have started building</p>
<p>little scripts, we used to call these when magic leap was out, internet agents, and the concept of</p>
<p>a software agent that&rsquo;s existed for a long time, actually, in computer science, I&rsquo;m sure Freebird</p>
<p>will give us some examples of that. But also Chet GPT can now use a browser. So that means you can</p>
<p>get around the dated nature of the content in the corpus. Somebody did things like, hey, build me a</p>
<p>meal plan, book me a reservation for Friday night in OpenTable, source other ingredients and buy it</p>
<p>for Saturday night on Instacart and then use something like Wolfram Alpha to, you know,</p>
<p>calculate the calories, etc. So when you saw this drop, Sax, what did you think in terms of</p>
<p>the opportunity for startups and to build these intelligent agents, things that will do if that</p>
<p>if this then that, or just background tasks over time, and you could actually leave them running?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think this is the most important developer platform,</p>
<p>since the iPhone and the launch of iOS and the App Store, and I would argue maybe ever</p>
<p>in our industry, certainly since the beginning of the internet, I think there was a question</p>
<p>when Chet GPT launched on November 30. And people start playing within December,</p>
<p>what exactly OpenAI&rsquo;s product strategy was going to be was this just like a proof of concept or a</p>
<p>demo. And they even kind of called it like a demo. And initially, it looked like what their business</p>
<p>model was going to be was providing an intelligence API that other websites, other applications could</p>
<p>incorporate. And we saw some really cool demos like that notion demo of other applications</p>
<p>incorporating AI capabilities. And so initially, it looked like what OpenAI was going to be was</p>
<p>more like Stripe, where, in the same way that Stripe made payments functionality available</p>
<p>very easily through a developer platform, they were going to make AI capabilities available</p>
<p>through their developer platform. And then I think a funny thing happened on the way to this</p>
<p>announcement, which is they became the fastest growing application of all time talking about</p>
<p>Chet GPT, over 100 million users in two months, nobody else has ever done that before. I think</p>
<p>it took the iPhone, you know, two years plus, Gmail, Google, those products all took, I think,</p>
<p>well over a year. So this became the fastest growing site of all time. And I think with plugins,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re indicating is that they will become a destination site. This is not just a developer</p>
<p>platform, this is a destination site. And through plugins, they are now incorporating the ability</p>
<p>to basically, you know, anything you could do through an application, you will now be able to</p>
<p>do through a plugin, you&rsquo;ll just tell Chet GPT what you want done. If you say, hey, book me a</p>
<p>plane ticket on this date, it will go into Kayaks plugin and do that. You say, book me a plane</p>
<p>ticket and then an Airbnb. So the promise of Siri and Alexa realized because those were very rigid,</p>
<p>they had no intelligence, right, Friedberg, you, if you, if you wanted Siri to do something</p>
<p>specific, like use ways, or to go get you an open table, it needed to be pretty specific. And it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have any kind of natural language model behind it. So this is taking existing API&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>putting a natural language layer in front of it, which makes it, you know, perform a little more</p>
<p>naturally. Is that what we&rsquo;re seeing here? I think it provides access to a corpus of data</p>
<p>and a suite of services that are not well integrated into a search or chat interface</p>
<p>anywhere today. So, you know, knowing what restaurants have what seats available is in</p>
<p>a closed service, it&rsquo;s in a it&rsquo;s in a data warehouse, operated by open table. And now</p>
<p>what open table can do is provide an API into that data via an interface, and they can allow</p>
<p>chat GPT to make a request to figure that data out to give a response to a user</p>
<p>where they can ultimately benefit from transacting and allowing a service.</p>
<p>This closes the loop between search and commerce in a way that Google cannot and does not do today.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what makes it very powerful. We&rsquo;ve seen this attempted in a number of important</p>
<p>ways in the last couple of years with Alexa, and Apple Home and Google Home kind of integration</p>
<p>via the chat services that they offer, you know, where you speak to the device,</p>
<p>but the deep integration that&rsquo;s possible now. And the natural language way that you can go</p>
<p>from the request all the way through to the transaction is what makes this so extremely</p>
<p>powerful. And I think, you know, the points I made a few weeks ago, when we first talked about,</p>
<p>you know, search, having so many searches that are done, where the human computer interface</p>
<p>presents a table or presents a chart, or presents a shopping list in a matrix. That&rsquo;s what makes</p>
<p>search such a defensible product, I think, could theoretically be completely obviated or destroyed</p>
<p>with an interface like this, where you can write the ability for chat GPT, or whatever the</p>
<p>core centralized services to actually present results in a table in a matrix in an interface</p>
<p>in a shopping list, and actually close the transaction loop. It&rsquo;s really disruptive to</p>
<p>things like commerce providers, it&rsquo;s really disruptive. You know, some of these commerce</p>
<p>platforms, it&rsquo;s really disruptive to a lot of different industries, but also introduces a lot</p>
<p>of real opportunity to build on top of that capability and that functionality to rewrite,</p>
<p>and ultimately make things easier and better for consumers on the internet.</p>
<p>What do you think, Chamath, you&rsquo;re looking at this, and it seems to be moving at a very fast</p>
<p>pace, over 100 million users, they put a business model on it already 20 bucks a month, they have</p>
<p>a secondary business model of, hey, use the API, and we&rsquo;ll charge you for usage. And then you layer</p>
<p>on what Zapier and if this than that had already sort of established in the world, which is APIs,</p>
<p>but nobody ever really wanted to write scripts. So that seemed to be the blocker, you go into</p>
<p>Zapier, if this than that, it&rsquo;s where 5% of the audience people want to customize stuff,</p>
<p>people who want to tinker. But this seems to now with the chat GPT chat interface,</p>
<p>open it up to a lot of people. So is this super significant? Or is this a commodity product that,</p>
<p>you know, 10 people will have for sitting here next year on all in Episode 220?</p>
<p>I think you are asking the exact right question. And you use the great term, like in poker,</p>
<p>if there are three hearts on the board, and you have the ace of hearts, you have what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the nut blocker, right, which means that nobody else, even if anybody else has a flush, they never</p>
<p>have the best flush. And if flush is the best hand, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways that you can manipulate the</p>
<p>pot and eventually win the pot because you have that ace of hearts and nobody else has it.</p>
<p>The concept of blocker, I think is very important to understand here, which is what are the real</p>
<p>blockers for this capability to not be broadly available. So I think you have to segregate,</p>
<p>you have the end user destination, you have the language model, and then you have the third party</p>
<p>services. And so if you ask the question, what is the incentive of the third party service? Well,</p>
<p>the shareholders of a travel site, right? They&rsquo;re not interested in doing an exclusive deal with any</p>
<p>distribution endpoint, they want their services integrated as broadly as possible.</p>
<p>Right? So I think the answer for the service providers is just like they build an app for</p>
<p>iOS and for Google, and if they could have justified it, they would have built an app for</p>
<p>a gaming console, they can, they should, they would, they do. Right? So that&rsquo;s going to get</p>
<p>commoditized and broadly available. I think on the LLM side, I think we&rsquo;ve talked about this,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s converging on each other. In fact, there was an interesting</p>
<p>article that was released that said that there was a handful of Google engineers that quit,</p>
<p>because apparently Bard was actually learning on top of</p>
<p>chat GPT, which they felt was either illegal or unethical or something, right? So, so the point is,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve talked about this for a while, but all of these models will converge in the absence</p>
<p>of highly unique data, right? What I&rsquo;ve been calling these white truffles. So if you can</p>
<p>hoard white truffles, your model will be better. Otherwise, your model will be the same as</p>
<p>everybody else&rsquo;s model. And then you have the distribution endpoints of which there are many</p>
<p>whose economic incentives are very high, right? So Facebook doesn&rsquo;t want to just sit around and</p>
<p>have all this traffic go to chat GPT, they want to be able to enable Instagram users and WhatsApp</p>
<p>users and Facebook users to interact through messenger or what have you. Obviously, Google</p>
<p>has a, you know, many hundreds of billions of reasons to defend their territory. So I think</p>
<p>all of this to me just means that these are really important use cases. As an investor,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to just stay a little patient. Because it&rsquo;s not clear to me that</p>
<p>there are any natural blockers. But I do think that David&rsquo;s right that it&rsquo;s demonstrating a</p>
<p>use case that&rsquo;s important. But it&rsquo;s still so early, we are six weeks in.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tell you, I think there&rsquo;s a couple of great blockers here, or there&rsquo;s going to be an</p>
<p>M&amp;A bonanza for Silicon Valley. If you look at certain data sets, Reddit, stack overflow for</p>
<p>programming. And Cora, these things are going to be worth a fortune. And to be able to buy those</p>
<p>or get exclusive licenses to those if you&rsquo;re maybe Google barred, or if you&rsquo;re a chat GPT,</p>
<p>that could be a major difference maker, Twitter&rsquo;s data set, obviously. And then you look at</p>
<p>certain tools like Zapier. And if this and that they&rsquo;ve spent a decade building the sort of,</p>
<p>you know, meta API, that would be an incredible blocker. I think this is going to be like a</p>
<p>balkanization. I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.</p>
<p>So many oral sources.</p>
<p>Zapier ran into it for free, they did a plugin for free.</p>
<p>Exactly. I was just gonna say, I don&rsquo;t think these are not blockers. I don&rsquo;t think this is</p>
<p>the ace of hearts on a flush board. I don&rsquo;t think so. I think that these things are really</p>
<p>interesting assets. They are definitely truffly in nature. But they may not be the, you know,</p>
<p>10 pound white truffle from Alba that we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, but on the M&amp;A side, don&rsquo;t you think this would be like incredible?</p>
<p>No, but the only reason I say that, again, is it is just so early, like I in the text,</p>
<p>I mentioned this to you guys, I remember, and Saks and I were in the middle of this.</p>
<p>We were both right at the beginning of social networking. Saks started genie,</p>
<p>I was in the middle of aim. And all of a sudden, we saw read start social net,</p>
<p>then we saw Friendster get started, then we saw MySpace get started. And you have to remember,</p>
<p>when you look back now, 20 years later, the winner was the seventh company, which was Facebook,</p>
<p>not the first, not the second, it was the seventh, which started two and a half years</p>
<p>properly after the entire web point to a phenomenon started.</p>
<p>Yeah, same with search, by the way, where Google was probably 20.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, excite like us.</p>
<p>If you want to be a real student of business history, I&rsquo;ll just say something that&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>meta, which is, if there&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve learned on the heels of this SVB fiasco,</p>
<p>is that there is an enormous amount of negative perception of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>and frankly, a lot of disdain for VCs and prognosticating technologists, right? And I</p>
<p>think that we have to be podcast. I think we have to be very careful.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I do think that we are an example of that because we are the bright, shiny object of</p>
<p>the people that were successful. And the broad makeup of America thinks that we&rsquo;re not nearly</p>
<p>as smart as we all think we are. And after all of this money that&rsquo;s been burned in crypto land,</p>
<p>and NFTs, and all of this web three nonsense, to yet again, whip up the next hype cycle,</p>
<p>I think doesn&rsquo;t serve us well. So I do think there&rsquo;s something very important here. But I think</p>
<p>if we want to maintain reputational capital through this cycle, because government will</p>
<p>get involved much faster in this cycle, I think it&rsquo;s important to just be methodical and thoughtful,</p>
<p>iterate experiment, but it&rsquo;s too early to call it, I guess, is what I would say.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely too early to call it. But,</p>
<p>Sax, you&rsquo;re saying explicitly, you think this is bigger than the internet itself,</p>
<p>bigger than mobile as a platform shift.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely top three. And I think it might be the biggest ever.</p>
<p>I think, look, I think things could certainly play out the way that Jamath is saying. However,</p>
<p>I actually think that open AI has demonstrated now with these platform features, that it has a</p>
<p>lead, a substantial lead. And I actually think that lead is likely to grow in the next year.</p>
<p>And let me tell you why. I think it&rsquo;s got a couple of assets here that are hard to replicate.</p>
<p>So number one, user attention. I think they&rsquo;ve now got, I would guess, hundreds of millions of</p>
<p>users and this thing is caught on like wildfire. It must have been beyond their wildest dream. I</p>
<p>think it even surprised them how much this has taken off. It&rsquo;s really captured the public&rsquo;s</p>
<p>imagination and people are discovering new use cases for it every day. If you are sort of the</p>
<p>number two or number three or the seventh large language model to basically get deployed behind a</p>
<p>chatbot, I just don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to get that kind of distribution because the novelty</p>
<p>factor will have worn off and people will have already kind of learned to use chat GPT.</p>
<p>So number one is the hundreds of millions of eyeballs. Number two is with this developer</p>
<p>platform, I think we should describe a couple of other features of it. One of the problems</p>
<p>with chat GPT, if you&rsquo;ve used it, is that the training data ends in 2021. And so you very</p>
<p>rapidly for many questions, get to a stopping point where it says, like, I don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>answer to that because I don&rsquo;t have any information about the last two years. Well,</p>
<p>one of the plugins that OpenAI has introduced itself is called the browsing plugin. And it</p>
<p>allows chat GPT to go search the internet and not just run internet searches, but to run an internet</p>
<p>search as if it were a human. So you ask chat GPT a question and it goes to find, it runs a search</p>
<p>and then it scours through the list of 20 links and it doesn&rsquo;t stop until it finds a good answer.</p>
<p>And then it comes back to you with just the answer. So it actually saves you the time</p>
<p>of clicking through all those loops and it&rsquo;ll give you the browsing history to show you what</p>
<p>it did. That&rsquo;s mind blowing. They also have a thing called a retrieval API, which allows developers</p>
<p>to share proprietary knowledge bases with chat GPT. So if you have a company knowledge base or</p>
<p>some other kind of content, you can share with chat GPT so that chat GPT can be aware of that.</p>
<p>And there are some privacy concerns, but the company has said they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>sandbox that data and protect it. As an example, I&rsquo;m planning on writing a book on SAS using chat</p>
<p>GPT and I&rsquo;m going to put together all the previous articles and talks I&rsquo;ve done as a database so I</p>
<p>can then work with that in chat GPT. So you&rsquo;re going to have more and more developers sharing</p>
<p>information with chat GPT. You&rsquo;re going to have chat GPT able to update its training based on</p>
<p>sort of the last two years, being able to search the internet. And I think that as those hundreds</p>
<p>of millions of users use the product, and as developers keep sharing more and more of these</p>
<p>data sets, the AI is going to get smarter and smarter. And then what&rsquo;s going to happen is</p>
<p>both consumers and developers are going to want to use or build on the smartest API.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, this is where it feeds on itself. I mean, yeah, I think there might be a</p>
<p>I agree with much of what you&rsquo;re saying. But I do think somebody like Facebook, when they release</p>
<p>their language model, which they&rsquo;re about to, is not going to allow chat GPT to have any access to</p>
<p>the Facebook corpus of data. And then LinkedIn will do the same, they&rsquo;ll block any access to</p>
<p>chat GPT to their data. And so then you might say, you know what, I&rsquo;m doing something related</p>
<p>to business and business contacts, I need to use the LinkedIn one. And they&rsquo;re just going to block</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s usage of and tell you, hey, you have to come to our interface and have a pro account</p>
<p>on LinkedIn. And this all becomes little islands of data. And so I&rsquo;m not sure that</p>
<p>you may be right. It&rsquo;s too early to have a definitive opinion. But I would say</p>
<p>you have to believe plugins are going to be promiscuous.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Plugins are the refutation of your</p>
<p>Facebook does not have an API, Twitter turned off their API, people who are</p>
<p>Cora doesn&rsquo;t let people use its data. So I just picked three. Those are three incredible data</p>
<p>sets that don&rsquo;t allow people and Craigslist doesn&rsquo;t. So people who are smart, do not allow</p>
<p>API&rsquo;s into their data. They keep it for themselves.</p>
<p>I think there were a lot of people when the app store rolled out that swore up and down,</p>
<p>they would never build a mobile app, because they didn&rsquo;t want to give Apple that kind of power that</p>
<p>the internet was open, whereas the app store is closed and curated by Apple. And sure enough,</p>
<p>they all at the end of the day had to roll out apps, even though in the case of Facebook,</p>
<p>it definitely has made them vulnerable, because they&rsquo;re downstream of Apple. I mean, Apple</p>
<p>now has enormous influence over Facebook&rsquo;s advertising revenue, because users have to</p>
<p>go through Apple. They never had to do that before the internet. Nonetheless, Facebook felt compelled</p>
<p>to release a mobile app because they knew was existential for them if they did it.</p>
<p>And I believe that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right analogy, the right analogy would be Google search,</p>
<p>does Facebook does Craigslist allow their data to be indexed inside of Google search answers? No,</p>
<p>right? They block that for a reason they and they will write a cease and desist letter.</p>
<p>Fine. So So you know what, those guys will stay out of it. But look how much content Google search</p>
<p>already has. And I think that chat GPT will start by eating a substantial portion of search because</p>
<p>again, you don&rsquo;t have to go through the 20 links, it just gives you the answer. It&rsquo;s going to eat a</p>
<p>substantial portion of browser usage and app usage, because you&rsquo;re just going to tell chat GPT</p>
<p>what you want to do, it will go book your plane ticket, it will go book your hotel room. Yeah,</p>
<p>see, this is a play in this hold on the apps that want to play in this will benefit. So there&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>a powerful incentive for applications to get an advantage by participating. Let me finish my point.</p>
<p>Yeah. And then eventually, they will be forced to do it not because they get an advantage,</p>
<p>but because they&rsquo;re so competitively disadvantaged. If they don&rsquo;t participate</p>
<p>in that ecosystem, I agree that they&rsquo;ll participate in it. But here&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen is Google is going to turn on Bard and I&rsquo;ve been playing with Bard.</p>
<p>It is 80% of chat GPT already. And then when they make Bard a default, you know, little snippet on</p>
<p>your Google search return page, or Bard is built into YouTube, or Chrome, or Android, all the play</p>
<p>store, they&rsquo;re going to roll right over chat GPT because they have billions of users already. So</p>
<p>this advantage that you see today, I see that getting rolled real quick, because you&rsquo;ll be on</p>
<p>YouTube. And on the top right hand side will be barred. And when you do a search, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>say, here are other sentences you could do, oh, you want to search Mr. Beast, when he&rsquo;s helped</p>
<p>people or Mr. Beast when he&rsquo;s given away more money, or people have copied and been inspired</p>
<p>by Mr. Beast, all that&rsquo;s going to occur inside of YouTube, and chat GPT is not going to have</p>
<p>access to the YouTube corpus of data. And then when you do a search, it&rsquo;s going to be the same</p>
<p>thing, it&rsquo;s going to be on the right hand side. And it&rsquo;s going to be playing just like it is in</p>
<p>Bing. If you turn on your Android phone, they&rsquo;re going to make Google Assistant go right into</p>
<p>Bard. And Google Assistant is already used by hundreds of millions of people. So I think that</p>
<p>Google will roll. I think they&rsquo;re going to roll chat GPT.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s going to win. But I&rsquo;m looking at this sexy poo more reductively as a capitalist,</p>
<p>which is what are people&rsquo;s incentives, because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll do. Google&rsquo;s incentive is to</p>
<p>usurp chat GPT usage by inserting something inside of their existing distribution channels</p>
<p>to suppress the ability for you to want to go to the app known as bundling. I think Facebook has</p>
<p>that same incentive. Oddly, even though Microsoft is such a deep partner, I think certain assets of</p>
<p>Microsoft have that incentive, you&rsquo;re talking collectively about five or $6 trillion of market</p>
<p>cap, then when you add in Alexa and Amazon and Siri and Apple, what is their incentive,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think their incentive is to let this happen. And I think if you look at the Slack,</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams example of even a better engineer product who&rsquo;s excellent and widely deployed,</p>
<p>even at hundreds of millions of users doesn&rsquo;t much matter when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more cleverly distributed and priced. And so those things again, you may still be right,</p>
<p>all I&rsquo;m saying is, it&rsquo;s just so early to know. And as slow and lumbering as some of these big</p>
<p>companies are, they are not so stupid as to kill their own golden goose and or defend it when</p>
<p>threatened. So I think you just have to let let it see what happens.</p>
<p>I want to finish the point on Google. And then we can move on to the bundling thing. Let me just</p>
<p>make the counter argument, which is that I think Google is caught completely flat footed here,</p>
<p>even though they shouldn&rsquo;t have been because they published the original paper on Transformers in</p>
<ol start="2017">
<li>They should have seen where all this was going, but they didn&rsquo;t open AI, use that paper</li>
</ol>
<p>and commercialized it. And the proof of that is there was just a lawsuit a couple of days ago,</p>
<p>or at least a claim by a former employee of Google who quit, because he said that they</p>
<p>were using chat GPT to train their AI. So their AI is so far behind. They were violating the</p>
<p>terms of use, hold on, they were violating the terms of use of open AI to train their own AI</p>
<p>on chat GPT. That&rsquo;s not a good sign. That&rsquo;s not a good sign. I also think hold on, hold on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just making the counter argument here. I mean, don&rsquo;t dismiss it out of hand, give me a chance to</p>
<p>explain it. Moreover, chat GPT for which was just released a few weeks ago, we know that open AI had</p>
<p>that they were using it internally for seven months. So the state of the art is not what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using. It&rsquo;s what open AI has internally. They&rsquo;re obviously working now on chat GPT five. And so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that Bard is 80% of chat GPT four, well, I got news for you. It&rsquo;s probably 50% or 20%</p>
<p>of chat GPT five. And who knows what the product roadmap is inside of open AI. I am sure that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got 200 ideas for things they could do to make it better and lowering fruit. But look,</p>
<p>regardless, I think the pace of innovation here in development is going to speed up massively.</p>
<p>I mean, there is going to be a flurry of activity. I agree. It&rsquo;s hard to know exactly how it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to play out. But I think this idea that oh, it&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion, these big companies</p>
<p>are just going to catch up with open AI. I think that there&rsquo;s a strong counter argument.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not I&rsquo;m making a very specific argument. It&rsquo;s not a foregone conclusion where all the value</p>
<p>will get captured. Just like in any of these major tidal waves. If you make the bets too early,</p>
<p>you typically don&rsquo;t make all the money. And it tends to be the case and it has been in the past,</p>
<p>at least with these transformative moves. It&rsquo;s sort of in the early third of the cycle</p>
<p>is where the real opportunities to make the tons of money emerge. And there&rsquo;s a lot of folks that</p>
<p>show you a path and then just don&rsquo;t necessarily capture the value. I&rsquo;m not saying that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be the case here. All I&rsquo;m saying is, if history is a guide, all of these other big waves</p>
<p>have shown that fact pattern. And so I&rsquo;m very excited and I&rsquo;m paying attention. But I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>being circumspect with this idea that, you know, having been in the middle of these couple of waves</p>
<p>before it, I made all the money by waiting a couple years. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be true this time around. But right, that&rsquo;s sort of my posture right now.</p>
<p>You obviously have a point because we&rsquo;re only four months in. So how can we know where this</p>
<p>is going to be in five years? So you could be right to your point, sex. I think it&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>And this is, you know, big ups to the open AI team, that they will be one of the top two or</p>
<p>three players. Absolutely. We all agree on that, which is extraordinary in itself. And the top</p>
<p>four players freeberg are obviously going to be Microsoft opening, I will call that like,</p>
<p>whatever that little, you know, pairing, and then Google, Facebook. And then we haven&rsquo;t talked about</p>
<p>Apple, but obviously, Apple is not going to take this sitting down. And hopefully,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get in gear and have Siri, you know, make it to the next level, or they&rsquo;ll just put her out</p>
<p>to pasture. If you were to look at those four, and we&rsquo;re sitting here a year from now, who has the</p>
<p>best product offering? Who has the biggest user base, just take a minute to think about that,</p>
<p>because you were at Google. And we all know, the word on the street is, it&rsquo;s the return of the</p>
<p>kings. Larry and Sergey are super engaged by all reports, every back channel, everybody I talked to</p>
<p>is saying that they&rsquo;re every day, they&rsquo;re obsessed with Google&rsquo;s legacy now and making this happen.</p>
<p>So what can you tell us in terms of who you think a year or two from now will have the biggest user</p>
<p>base and be the most innovative amongst that quartet? Or maybe you think there&rsquo;s other players</p>
<p>who will emerge? The advantage that open AI has, which is the advantage that any</p>
<p>call it emerging, you know, advantage competitor has, is, yeah, outsider is that the incumbents</p>
<p>are handicapped by their current scale. Much of the consideration set that Google has had</p>
<p>in deciding what features and tools to launch with respect to AI over the last couple of years</p>
<p>has been driven fundamentally by a concern about public policy and public reaction.</p>
<p>And I know this from speaking to folks there that are close enough to kind of indicate like,</p>
<p>Google has been so targeted has been such the point of attack by governments around the world</p>
<p>with respect to their scale and monopoly and monopolistic kind of behavior. Some people have</p>
<p>framed it privacy concerns, you know, etc, etc. The fines in the EU are extraordinary,</p>
<p>that so much of what goes on at Google today is can I get approval to do this? And so many people</p>
<p>have felt so frustrated that they can&rsquo;t actually unleash the toolkit that Google has built. And so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been harnessed and focused on these internal capabilities. I think I mentioned this</p>
<p>in the past, but things like, what&rsquo;s the right video to show on YouTube to keep people engaged?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right ad to show to increase click through rates, etc, etc. versus building great</p>
<p>consumer products for fear of the backlash that would arise, and governments coming down on that</p>
<p>mission release, and ultimately attacking the revenue and the core revenue stream. And this</p>
<p>is no different than any other kind of innovative dilemma, you know, any other business of scale in</p>
<p>any other industry historically ultimately gets disrupted, because their job at that point is to</p>
<p>protect their cash flow and their revenue stream and their balance and their assets, not to disrupt</p>
<p>themselves, especially as a public company, especially under the scrutiny and the watchful</p>
<p>eye of governments and regulators. So I think Google has, in aggregate, probably good competitive</p>
<p>talent, if not better talent than open AI and others. Google has arguably the best corpus of</p>
<p>data upon which to train the best capabilities, the best toolkit, the best hardware issues are</p>
<p>the lowest cost for running these sorts of models, the lowest cost for serving them, etc, etc. So</p>
<p>frankly, they&rsquo;re way behind the battle is theirs to lose, if they are willing to disrupt themselves.</p>
<p>And this is the moment that Larry and Sergey should wield those founders shares that they have.</p>
<p>And they should wield the comments that they wrote in that founders letter, that they will always</p>
<p>make the right decision for the long term for this company, even if it means taking a cost in the</p>
<p>short term and disrupting themselves. This is the moment to prove that those founders shares were</p>
<p>worth, you know, the negotiation to get there. And, and I think that it is going to require</p>
<p>a real degree of scrutiny, a real degree of regulatory uncertainty, a real degree of</p>
<p>challenge by governments and public policy people, and perhaps even a revenue hit in the near term</p>
<p>to realize the opportunity, but I do think that they&rsquo;re better equipped to win if they chose to.</p>
<p>Well said.</p>
<p>Well, really well said. I think the founders share insight is particularly interesting sacks.</p>
<p>The fact that by the way, sorry for those I did nothing with them.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, I was just gonna say the exact same thing. It&rsquo;s like if they don&rsquo;t use it now,</p>
<p>what would it take? And when? Yeah, and yet another, yet another case of the emperor has</p>
<p>no clothes, just a power grab by Silicon Valley execs, which was meaningless. Because if in this</p>
<p>moment, you don&rsquo;t wield that power, and break that company into bits as you need to, what was</p>
<p>the point of having it?</p>
<p>They need to come in and say, we&rsquo;re going to give barred results to 10% of users and ask them to</p>
<p>get feedback on it. Because who has worse queries than just one point I want to make there for</p>
<p>who has more reinforcement learning than Google, that search box is now everywhere and people</p>
<p>write after question and Gmail and Google Docs, etc, etc. I mean, they have so many people asking</p>
<p>questions and YouTube might be the the transcripts of YouTube, every video and the image of every</p>
<p>video bananas and the comments under it, you know, the comments under the video, you have the</p>
<p>transcript of what happened in this video. And then what was the question and answer underneath</p>
<p>it? Let me make the counterpoint, please, to my own point, like, look at how Gerstner came after</p>
<p>Zuck. So Zuck had his point of view, his strongly held belief that AR VR was the future of the</p>
<p>platform. That&rsquo;s what he wanted to bet into. That&rsquo;s what he wanted to lean into. It&rsquo;s what he</p>
<p>wanted to build the company against. He did it. And then the financial analysts and the investors</p>
<p>came at him and said, This is a waste of money, focus on making money, you have a responsibility</p>
<p>to shareholders, F those founders shares, you don&rsquo;t deserve that 10x voting right, or whatever</p>
<p>the framing might have been to get him to say, you know what I acquiesce, I&rsquo;m giving it up. And</p>
<p>I think that we should also think about what&rsquo;s going to happen on the other side, Google is a</p>
<p>trillion plus dollar market cap company. Their shares are owned by every public endowment,</p>
<p>public pension fund, institutional investor owns Google in their portfolio. So the backlash</p>
<p>against Google making a hard bet like this, and potentially destroying billions of dollars of</p>
<p>cash flow in the process every year will not be easy to do that the same sorts of letters that</p>
<p>Gerstner at all. And obviously, we love Gerstner. And, you know, we can all defend him all day long</p>
<p>at Zuck is what might may end up happening with with alphabet if they did choose to go this path.</p>
<p>Saks, what do you think here about the founder share specifically in Google&rsquo;s chances</p>
<p>of disrupting themselves and, you know, just putting this into every product</p>
<p>and shoving it down users throats and catching up?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, with all due respect to Larry and Sergey, I mean, they&rsquo;ve been on the beach a long</p>
<p>time. This reminds me of Apollo Creed coming out of retirement in rocket for a lot of a lot of</p>
<p>fanfare. But they could be a little out of shape. Sam Altman may not look like Ivan Drago. But</p>
<p>but this this is one shrewd character. This is one shrewd character. I mean,</p>
<p>Altman is fit. He&rsquo;s fit. He&rsquo;s been in the arena.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s, you know, he&rsquo;s a multi time founder who sat at the top of YC and got to see everything</p>
<p>that worked. Yep. And got to see all the research and he&rsquo;s been plugging away at this for what,</p>
<p>like eight years. So there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a big I just think there&rsquo;s a big gap to catch up on. Now,</p>
<p>Google has all the resources in the world. And they&rsquo;ve got a lot of proprietary assets, too.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve got all the incentive in the world. So do I think that Google will be</p>
<p>one of the top four players in AI? Absolutely. But this idea that is going to come in steamroll</p>
<p>open AI. I have a prediction. I got a prediction. Within next year, Larry and</p>
<p>Sergei take the title of co CEOs. And then they do a demo day where the two of them</p>
<p>get on stage. They actually do the demos of these products. If that happens, that fictional</p>
<p>quantification. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s listen, and Bezos is gonna run for president. Those are my</p>
<p>two predictions. Stop. I&rsquo;m taking love riddance. Can you imagine if Larry Freeburg where the</p>
<p>chances of Larry and Sergei taking co CEO slots, that&rsquo;s prediction one and then prediction two,</p>
<p>where the chance of them running the next Google IO, where they get on stage, and they walk people</p>
<p>through all the products that they shepherded, and that they have a vested interest in that there,</p>
<p>they want to demo, there is an institutional problem at Google, at the top level, which</p>
<p>does need to be solved. Which is this position of constantly being in defense against the scrutiny,</p>
<p>again, of regulators and public policy folks, and you know, all these different groups that</p>
<p>are against Google. And so as a result, the kind of cultural seasoning, particularly the executive</p>
<p>and the board level has been one of like, you know, protect the nest, don&rsquo;t overreach, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>overstep. And it&rsquo;s a real, you know, I think one for the for the business school books or whatever,</p>
<p>ultimately is what they end up doing about it. Because now is, you know, the time when</p>
<p>that defensive posture is really kind of putting the entire business at risk.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to Microsoft, remember, in the late 90s, that&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>when they got crushed by that antitrust lawsuit, it made them very defensive.</p>
<p>Well, that can know but that consent degree, they put up they had a wartime CEO come in</p>
<p>bomber came in. And, you know, followed by kind of an innovative guy who could kind of continue to</p>
<p>build. And I think that there may be a moment here. I look I love Sundar. He&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>guy, great CEO, sooner and I don&rsquo;t forget, if I ever told you this, he and I started at Google</p>
<p>on the same day, we&rsquo;re both in the same nuclear class, we were the freaking hat on the TGIF</p>
<p>day and on stage, he was a product manager, and now he runs the company.</p>
<p>But I think the question is, like, whether it&rsquo;s the CEO or the broader hold kind of executive</p>
<p>org or the board, a degree of disruption necessary to shift that cultural seasoning is so necessary</p>
<p>right now, for them to have a shot at this. And similar to what you just said, sex, like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to need a bomber type moment to kind of, you know, reinvigorate that business.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;ll tell you such a moment, I think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an important port point when bomber took over during that period after gates,</p>
<p>when they were on their heels, he basically just focused on revenue and paying dividends and stock</p>
<p>buybacks, and the stock went sideways. And he missed mobile. And now, yeah, it&rsquo;s missing,</p>
<p>you know, when you&rsquo;re forgetting one big thing, which is that that was also because he had to</p>
<p>operate under a consent decree to the DOJ. Exactly. So the product managers of Microsoft</p>
<p>were replaced with lawyers from the Department of Justice, and you had to get their sign off</p>
<p>before you could ship anything. So we have to remember that those things probably slowed</p>
<p>Microsoft down as well. And the great thing that Satya had was a blank slate and the removal of</p>
<p>that consent decree. So he was able to do everything that just made a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s executed flawlessly. I think the problem at Google is not Sundar or Larry or Sergey.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more in the deep bowels of middle management of that company, which is that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just far too many people that probably have an opinion. And their opinion is not shrouded in</p>
<p>survival. Their opinion is shrouded in elite language around what is the moral and ethical</p>
<p>implications of this and where has this been properly tested on the diaspora of 19 different</p>
<p>ethnic tribes of the Amazon. That&rsquo;s the kind of decision making that is a nice to have when you</p>
<p>are the second or third most valuable technology company in the world. But you have to be able to</p>
<p>pause that kind of thinking and instead get into wartime survival mode. And it&rsquo;s very hard. So it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t almost matter. At this point, what Sundar wants, the real question is, what is the capability</p>
<p>of middle management to either do it or get out of the way. And I think that in all of these big</p>
<p>companies that struggle, what you really see is an inability for middle management to get out of</p>
<p>the way, or, frankly, just you need somebody to then fire them. And if you look at folks who get</p>
<p>their groove back, let&rsquo;s see what Facebook does. What are they targeting? They&rsquo;re targeting middle</p>
<p>management. If you look at what Elon does in the companies that he owns, there is virtually no</p>
<p>middle management. It&rsquo;s like get out of the way, build product, build product and ship it. Yeah.</p>
<p>And what is the core truth? And so if failure is there in front of you, and if David is right,</p>
<p>that you have 200 million users come out of nowhere, who are voting every day with their</p>
<p>time and attention to use an app. And that doesn&rsquo;t create a five alarm fire where you get middle</p>
<p>management out of the way and you are the senior most people talking to the people doing the work</p>
<p>and shipping things every day. You&rsquo;re you are toast. You are toast,</p>
<p>a lot of people are starting to think we&rsquo;re moving a little bit too fast. When it comes to</p>
<p>open AI is incredible performance, which had GPT for the plugins and all this. And so the future</p>
<p>of life Institute, which was formed in 2015. It&rsquo;s a nonprofit that&rsquo;s focused on de risking</p>
<p>major technology like AI. They did a petition titled pause giant AI experiments and open letter</p>
<p>bunch of computer scientists assign this letter. And the letter quote says we must ask ourselves</p>
<p>should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should</p>
<p>we automate away all the jobs including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop non human</p>
<p>minds that might eventually outnumber outsmart obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of</p>
<p>control of our civilization, a number of notable tech leaders like Elon, Steve Wozniak, and a</p>
<p>handful of deep mind researchers have signed it. What do you guys think of the latter? Are we going</p>
<p>to slow down or not? And then we can ask the question generally, how close are we getting to</p>
<p>AGI, which is what everybody&rsquo;s scared of, is that these agents start working with each other in the</p>
<p>background to do things that are against human interest. I know it sounds like science fiction.</p>
<p>But there is a theory that when these AI is start operating on their own, like we explained in the</p>
<p>previous sort of segment here with plugins, and they make agents that are operating based on</p>
<p>feedback from each other, could they get out of control and be mischievous and then work against</p>
<p>human interest? So what do you think sex? I think there&rsquo;s a difference between what could happen in</p>
<p>the short term and then what could happen in the long term. I think in the short term, everything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing right now is very positive. And let me just give you an example. There was a really</p>
<p>interesting tweet storm about a guy who wrote about how chat GPT saved his dog. And do you guys</p>
<p>see this? This is one of the really mind blowing ones to me, use cases. So his dog was sick,</p>
<p>took him to a vet, vet prescribed some medication, three days later, dog still sick, in fact, even</p>
<p>worse. So the owner of the pet just literally copied and pasted the lab result for the blood</p>
<p>test for the dog with all the lab values into chat GPT and said, What could this be? Like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your likely diagnosis? chat GPT gave three possible answers, three illnesses. The first one</p>
<p>was what the vet basically diagnosed with. So that wasn&rsquo;t it. The second one was excluded by another</p>
<p>test. So he then went to a second vet and said, Listen, I think my dog has the third one,</p>
<p>and vet prescribed something and sure enough, dog is cured, saved. So that&rsquo;s really mind blowing</p>
<p>that even though chat GPT hasn&rsquo;t been specifically optimized, as far as we know, for lab results,</p>
<p>it could figure this out. The reason I&rsquo;m mentioning this is it gives you a sense of the potential here</p>
<p>to cure disease to, you know, like I could see major medical breakthroughs based on the AI in</p>
<p>the next five or 10 years. Now, the question is, like, what happens in the long term, you know,</p>
<p>as the AI gets smarter and smarter, and we are kind of getting into the realm of science fiction,</p>
<p>but here would be the scenario is you&rsquo;re on chat GPT 10, or 20, or whatever it is, or maybe some</p>
<p>other companies AI. And the developers asked the AI, hey, how could you make yourself better?</p>
<p>Now do it, which is a question we asked chat GPT all the time in different contexts. And so chat</p>
<p>GPT will already have the ability to write perfect code by that point. I think, you know,</p>
<p>code writing is one of the, I think of its superpowers already. So it gives itself the</p>
<p>ability to rewrite its code to auto update it to recursively make itself better. I mean,</p>
<p>at that point, isn&rsquo;t that like a speciation event doesn&rsquo;t that very quickly lead to the singularity</p>
<p>if the AI has the capability to rewrite its own code to make itself better? And you know, won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it very quickly write billions of versions of itself? And you know, it&rsquo;s very hard to predict</p>
<p>what that future looks like. Now, I also don&rsquo;t know how far away we are from that that could</p>
<p>be 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, whatever. But I think it&rsquo;s a question worth asking for sure.</p>
<p>Is it worth slowing down, though, sex? Should we be pausing because,</p>
<p>based on what you&rsquo;ve said, you know, I think you&rsquo;ve framed it properly.</p>
<p>When these things hit a certain point, and they start reinforcing their own learning with each</p>
<p>other, they can go at infinite speed, right? This is not comparable to human speed, they could be</p>
<p>firing off millions, billions of different I think you&rsquo;re right scenarios.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re definitely now on this fuck around, find out curve. Yeah. And so there&rsquo;s only one way</p>
<p>to really find out which is somebody is going to push the boundaries, the competitive dynamics will</p>
<p>get the better of some startup, they&rsquo;ll do something that people will look back on and say,</p>
<p>Whoa, that was a little that was a bridge too far. So yeah, we&rsquo;re just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we&rsquo;re not going to slow down. I actually think it&rsquo;s going the other way. I think</p>
<p>things are going to speed up. And the reason they&rsquo;re going to speed up is because the one</p>
<p>thing Silicon Valley is really good at is taking advantage of a platform shift. And so when you</p>
<p>think about like all the VCs, and all the founders, you know, everyone accuses us of being lemmings.</p>
<p>And so when there&rsquo;s like, kind of like a fake platform shift, or people kind of glom onto</p>
<p>something that ends up not being real, everyone&rsquo;s kind of got egg on their faces. But the flip side</p>
<p>of that is that when the platform shift is real, Silicon Valley is really good at throwing money</p>
<p>at it. The talent knows how to go after it. And they keep making it better and better. And so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the dynamic we&rsquo;re in right now. You look at 70% of the last YC class was ready all AI</p>
<p>startups for the next one, probably 95%. So I think that we&rsquo;re on a path here where the pace</p>
<p>of innovation is actually going to speed up. Companies are going to compete with each other,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to seek to invent new capabilities. And I think the results are going to all be</p>
<p>incredibly positive for some period of time, like, you know, the vet example, we&rsquo;re going to cure</p>
<p>illnesses, we&rsquo;re going to solve major problems. Positive, then we invest more, we trust more.</p>
<p>But the paradox of that, as Chamath is pointing out, Friedberg is if we trust it more, we invest</p>
<p>more than some person in a free market is going to say, you know what, I need to beat chat GPT,</p>
<p>therefore, I&rsquo;m going to take the rails off this thing, I&rsquo;m going to let it go</p>
<p>faster, and take off some constraints, because I need to win. And I&rsquo;m so far behind.</p>
<p>How do you feel about that scenario that sort of Chamath and Saks teed up Friedberg,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like, GPT three, I think ran on 700 gigs. Is that right?</p>
<p>Does anyone know what GPT four runs on? It&rsquo;s got to be on some number that&rsquo;s, you know, not to not</p>
<p>not many multiples of that. But look, someone could make a copy of this thing and fork it and</p>
<p>develop an entirely new model. I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s incredible about software and digital</p>
<p>technology and also kind of, you know, means that it&rsquo;s very hard to contain. Similar to like what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen in biology ever since biology got digitized through DNA sequencing, and the ability</p>
<p>to kind of express molecules through gene editing. You know, you can&rsquo;t control or contain the ability</p>
<p>to do gene editing work at all. Because everyone knows the code. Everyone can make CRISPR Cas</p>
<p>molecules, everyone can make gene editing systems in any lab anywhere. Once it was out, it was out.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s hundreds of variants for doing gene editing, many of which are much improved</p>
<p>over CRISPR Cas9. I use that as an analogy, because it was this breakthrough technology</p>
<p>that allowed us to precisely, specifically edit genomes. And that allowed us to engineer biology</p>
<p>and do these incredible things where biology effectively became software. And remember,</p>
<p>CRISPR Cas9 gave us effectively a word processing type tool find and replace.</p>
<p>And the tooling that&rsquo;s evolved from that is much better. So whatever is underlying,</p>
<p>whatever the parameters are for GPT for whatever that model is,</p>
<p>if a close enough replicant of that model exists, or a copy of that model is made,</p>
<p>and then new training data and new evolutions can be done separately, you could see many,</p>
<p>many variants kind of emerged from here. And I think this is a good echoing of Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s ultimately going to win. Is there enough of a network effect in the plugin</p>
<p>model, as Saks pointed out, to really give open AI the sustaining competitive advantage? I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure. The model runs on 700 gigs. That&rsquo;s less data than you know, fits on my iPhone. So you know,</p>
<p>I could take that model, I could take the parameters of that model. And I could create</p>
<p>an entirely new version, I could fork it, and I could do something entirely new with it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think you can contain it. I don&rsquo;t think that this idea that we can put in place,</p>
<p>some regulatory constraints and say, it&rsquo;s illegal to do this. Or, you know, try and,</p>
<p>you know, create IP around it, or protections around it is realistic at the state,</p>
<p>the power of the tool is so extraordinary, the extendability of the tools are so extraordinary.</p>
<p>So the economic and, you know, the various incentives are there for, you know, other</p>
<p>models to emerge. And whether they&rsquo;re directly copied from someone hacking into open AI servers</p>
<p>and making a copy of that model, or whether they&rsquo;re, you know, open sourced, or whether</p>
<p>someone generates something that&rsquo;s 95% is good, and then it forks and a whole new class of models</p>
<p>emerge. I think this is like, it&rsquo;s as Saks pointed out, highlighting the kind of economic,</p>
<p>market uprooting, social uprooting potential, and many models will start to kind of come to market.</p>
<p>What do we think the impact of white collar jobs getting annihilated by this technology? If that,</p>
<p>in fact, I want to say one thing on this. Yeah, look, I just share one example here. So here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a Reddit post that I was made aware of earlier this week. I lost everything that made me love</p>
<p>my job through mid journey overnight. I am employed as a 3d artist in a small games company of 10</p>
<p>people. Our team is two people who basically explains he says since mid journey version five</p>
<p>came out, he&rsquo;s not an artist anymore, nor a 3d artist. All they do is prompting, photoshopping</p>
<p>and implementing good looking pictures. And he basically says, this happened overnight,</p>
<p>and he had no choices. Boss also had no choice. He says I am now able to create rig and animate</p>
<p>a character that spit out from MJ mid journey in two to three days before it took us several</p>
<p>weeks and 3d. The difference is that he cares about his you know, job and for his boss. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a huge time money saver. He&rsquo;s no longer making art and the person who was number two</p>
<p>in the organization who didn&rsquo;t make as good content as him is now embracing this technology</p>
<p>because it carries favor with his boss. And he ends basically saying, getting a job in the game</p>
<p>industry is already hard, but leaving a company and a nice team because AI took my job feels very</p>
<p>dystopian. I doubt it would be better in a different company. Also, I am between grief</p>
<p>and anger and I&rsquo;m sorry for using my gosh, your art fellow artists. This is yet another reason</p>
<p>that figma really needs to close this acquisition from Adobe. I mean, it&rsquo;s like, the value of these</p>
<p>apps are just getting gutted. If you take a workflow management tool for things like design</p>
<p>and imagery, and you reduce it by an order of 90%, it&rsquo;s like, what is that app experience worth?</p>
<p>And how could you replicate it if you were a big company that already has distribution? That&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>comment. But what I would tell you, Jason, to answer the white collar question is I think there</p>
<p>are a handful of companies you need to look at exclusively, because they will be the first ones</p>
<p>to really figure out how to displace human labor. And that is TCS. So Tata Consulting Services,</p>
<p>Accenture, Cognizant, these are all the folks that do coding for higher work at scale. I think</p>
<p>Accenture has something like 750,000 employees. So the incentive to sort of squeeze outbacks to</p>
<p>create better utilization rates to increase profitability is quite obvious. It always has</p>
<p>been they will be the first people to figure out how to use these tools at scale. Before the law</p>
<p>firms or the accounting firms or any of those folks, even sort of try to figure out how to</p>
<p>displace white collar labor, I think it&rsquo;s going to be the coding jobs and it&rsquo;s going to be the</p>
<p>coding for higher jobs that companies like Accenture and TCS. So those business processing</p>
<p>do for other people, developer kind of folks, they&rsquo;re going to need half as many people,</p>
<p>25% as many people, we&rsquo;re going to find out the efficient frontier.</p>
<p>Yeah. I see it a different way. I mean, this argument that productivity leads to job loss</p>
<p>has been made for hundreds of years and it&rsquo;s always been refuted. When you make human beings</p>
<p>more productive, it leads to more prosperity, more wealth, more growth. And so, yeah, it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>to think about in a narrow way, the jobs are going to be displaced, but why would that be? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re giving leverage to other human beings to get more done. And some of those human</p>
<p>beings, really anybody with a good idea is now going to be able to create a startup much more</p>
<p>easily. So you&rsquo;re going to see a huge explosion in creativity, in startup creation, new companies,</p>
<p>new jobs. Imagine, think about the case of Zuckerberg founding Facebook at Harvard. He wrote</p>
<p>the first version himself, maybe with a couple of friends. That project happened and turned into a</p>
<p>giant company because he was able to self-execute his idea without needing to raise venture capital</p>
<p>or even recruit employees, even really before forming a company. Anyone with a good idea is</p>
<p>going to be able to do that soon. You&rsquo;re going to be able to use these AI tools. They truly</p>
<p>will be no code. You&rsquo;ll be able to create an app or a website just by speaking to some AI program</p>
<p>in a natural language way. So more flowers will bloom, more startups will bloom, more projects.</p>
<p>Now, it will create, I think, a lot of dislocation, but for every testimonial that is like the one</p>
<p>that you showed, which I think is, I&rsquo;d say a little bit overly dramatic. I have seen 10 or 100</p>
<p>testimonials from coders on Twitter or other blogs talking about the power that these new tools give</p>
<p>them. They are like, this makes me a 10x engineer. Right. And especially these like junior engineers</p>
<p>who are right out of school who don&rsquo;t have 20 years of coding history. They get superpowers right</p>
<p>away. It makes them so much better. Let me give you a response to that guy. So, and using Sax&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point, that guy saying what used to take me weeks, I can now do in two to three days. And I feel like</p>
<p>my work is gone. And that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s thinking in terms of his output being static. And if he</p>
<p>thinks about his output being dynamic, he can now in the matter of three weeks, instead of making</p>
<p>one character, he can now make a character every two days. So he can make 30 characters in three</p>
<p>weeks. That&rsquo;s an alternative way for him to think about what this tooling does for him and his</p>
<p>business. The number of video games will go up by 10x or 100x or 1000x. The number of movies and</p>
<p>videos that can be rendered in computers can go up by 10x or 100x or 1000x. This is why I really</p>
<p>believe strongly that at some period of time, we will all have our own movie or our own video game</p>
<p>ultimately generated for us on the fly. Based on our particular interests, there will certainly be</p>
<p>shared culture, shared themes, you know, shared morality, shared things that that tie all these</p>
<p>things together. And that will become the shared experience. But in terms of like us all consuming</p>
<p>the same content, it will really like you with YouTube and Tick Tock, we&rsquo;re all consuming</p>
<p>different stuff all the time. And this will enable an acceleration of that evolution and</p>
<p>personalization. I&rsquo;ll also highlight, you know, back in the day, one human had to farm a farm by</p>
<p>hand. And we eventually got the tool of a hoe and we can put in the ground and make, you know,</p>
<p>make stuff faster. And then we got a plow. And then we got a tractor. And today, agricultural</p>
<p>farm equipment allows one farmer to farm over 10,000 acres, you go to Western Australia,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible. These guys have 24 row planters and harvesters. And it&rsquo;s completely changed the</p>
<p>game. So the unit of output per farmer is now literally millions of times what it was just</p>
<ol start="150">
<li>And in that case, freeberg, nobody wants to do backbreaking labor in the fields. And everybody</li>
</ol>
<p>wants to ship our food. But in this case, let me just read you one quote that I didn&rsquo;t read in the</p>
<p>original reading of this. He says, I want to make art that isn&rsquo;t the result of scraped internet</p>
<p>content from artists that were not asked. And so I think that&rsquo;s part of this is that it&rsquo;s bespoke</p>
<p>art. But the one question I had for sacks was, sacks, you we started this conversation, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying, hey, this is different than anything in terms of efficiency that came before it. This is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put some words in my ear, but this is like a step function,</p>
<p>more efficient. So to the argument of, hey, efficiency has always resulted in, you know,</p>
<p>more ideas. And we&rsquo;ve found something to do with people&rsquo;s time is this time different, potentially,</p>
<p>because this is so much more powerful. This isn&rsquo;t just like a spell checker,</p>
<p>I would say differently, I think, and I agree with what J. Cal is saying, because I think that</p>
<p>the thing that technology has never done is tried to displace human judgment. It&rsquo;s allowed us to</p>
<p>replace physical exertion of energy, but it has always preserved humans injecting our judgment.</p>
<p>And I think this is the first time where we&rsquo;re being challenged with autonomous systems</p>
<p>that has some level of judgment. Now we can say, and it&rsquo;s true, can reform on sin,</p>
<p>that that judgment isn&rsquo;t so great. But eventually, and because of the pace of innovation,</p>
<p>eventually is probably not that far away. To judgment will become perfect. I&rsquo;ll give you a</p>
<p>totally different example. You know, how many pilots are there in the world?</p>
<p>Will we, at some point in the next 10 years, want folks to actually manually take off and land? Or</p>
<p>will we want precision guided instrumentation and computers and sensors that can guarantee a pitch</p>
<p>perfect landing every single time and all kinds of weather conditions so that now planes can even</p>
<p>have 50 x the number of sensors with a computer that can then process it and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Just a random example that isn&rsquo;t even thought of when we talk about sort of where AI is going to</p>
<p>rear its head. I think that this judgment idea is an important one to figure out because this</p>
<p>is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen something that is bumping up against our ability to have judgment.</p>
<p>And what this person was talking about in this mid journey example is his judgment has been usurped.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah, I would disagree. So like, yeah, let me just let me just make one point on this.</p>
<p>So, you know, an image is a matrix of, you know, data that&rsquo;s rendered on a screen and</p>
<p>as pixels, and those pixels are different colors. And, you know, that&rsquo;s what an image is.</p>
<p>Is it or is it? Is it the judgment of the creator?</p>
<p>Well, no, I&rsquo;m just saying an image in general. So like when Adobe Photoshop and digital photography</p>
<p>arose, photographers were like, this is, you know, BS, why are you digitizing photography</p>
<p>was analog and beautiful before. And then what digital photography allowed is the photographer</p>
<p>to do editing and to do work that was creative beyond what was possible with just a natural</p>
<p>photograph taken through a camera. And they&rsquo;re arguably different art forms, but it was a new</p>
<p>kind of art form that emerged through digital photography. And then in the early 90s, there</p>
<p>was a plugin suite called Kai&rsquo;s power tools that came out in Adobe Photoshop. And it was a third</p>
<p>party plugin set, you would you would buy it and then it would work on Photoshop. And it did things</p>
<p>like motion blur, sharpening, pixelation, all these interesting kind of like features. And</p>
<p>prior to those tools coming out, the judgment of the digital artists, the digital photographer was</p>
<p>to go in and do pixel by pixel changes on the image to make that pixel to make that image look</p>
<p>blurry, or to make it look sharper, or to make it look like it had some really interesting motion</p>
<p>feature. And the Kai&rsquo;s power tools created this instant toolkit where in a few seconds, you</p>
<p>created a blur on the image. And that was an incredible toolkit. But a lot of digital artists</p>
<p>said, this is automating my work. What is my point now? Why am I here? And the same happened</p>
<p>in animation when three, when you know, CGI came around, and animators were no longer animating</p>
<p>cells by hand. And in every point in this evolution, there was a feeling of loss initially,</p>
<p>but then the evolution of a whole new art form emerged, and an evolution of a whole new area of</p>
<p>human creative expression emerged. And I think we don&rsquo;t yet know what that&rsquo;s going to look like.</p>
<p>Do you think you think you think the, the level of judgment that AI offers you is the same as the</p>
<p>level of judgment that Kai power tools offered? Yeah, look, I mean, I think that the person</p>
<p>making the judgment or the decision about which pixel to change into what color felt like, you</p>
<p>know, I have control. And I think it&rsquo;s ultimately like, I just told her, I disagree with you. I</p>
<p>mean, I think that this is a magnitude different. It&rsquo;s more than a magnitude. Yeah. It&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>love. It&rsquo;s on you. You don&rsquo;t look nice. You and I have sat in spreadsheets. And we&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;m generally</p>
<p>happy with this idea. So I&rsquo;ll give you a different example. Today, we use radiologists and pathologists</p>
<p>to identify cancers. Yep. There are closed loop systems, we have one right now that&rsquo;s in front of</p>
<p>the FDA, that is a total closed loop system that will not need any human input. So I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what those folks do. Except what I can tell you is that we can get cancer detection, basically down</p>
<p>to a 0% error rate. That is not possible with human intervention. That is judgment. Right. So</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s important to really acknowledge that this is happening at a level that it&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>happened before. You may be right that there&rsquo;s some amazing job for that radiologist or pathologist to</p>
<p>do in the future. I don&rsquo;t know offhand what that is. But these are closed loop systems now, that</p>
<p>think for themselves and self improve. I get it. But I think that there there is an unfathomable</p>
<p>set of things that emerge. We did not have the concept of Instagram influencers. We did not have</p>
<p>the concept of personal trainers, we did not have the concept of like, all these new jobs that have</p>
<p>emerged in the past couple of decades, that people enjoy doing that they can make money doing that is</p>
<p>a greater kind of experience and level of fulfillment for those that choose and have the</p>
<p>freedom to do it than what they were having to do before, when they had to work just to make money.</p>
<p>What do you think that radiologist or pathologist wants to do be a trainer or Pilates instructor?</p>
<p>No, I think we don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s gonna look like. All right. Yeah.</p>
<p>You have any thoughts on this? As we wrap this topic? It&rsquo;s obviously a lot of passion coming out.</p>
<p>Yeah. Elimination of white collar jobs in a massive way.</p>
<p>I think that this is a short term versus long term thing. In the short term,</p>
<p>I see the benefits of AI being very positive, because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s in most cases wiping</p>
<p>out human jobs, this is making them way more productive. You still need the developer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that there are five times or 10x more productive. But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re at the point</p>
<p>in the short term, we&rsquo;re gonna be able to eliminate that role entirely. What I&rsquo;ve seen in basically</p>
<p>every startup I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of is that the limiting factor on progress is always engineering</p>
<p>bandwidth. That is always the thing that you wish you had more of. Totally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the product roadmap is always the most competed on thing inside the organization.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s trying to get their project prioritized, because there&rsquo;s just never</p>
<p>enough engineering bandwidth. It&rsquo;s really the lifeblood of the company. If you make</p>
<p>the developers more productive, it maybe just accelerates the product roadmap.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think in the short term that what&rsquo;s going to happen is these companies are going to look to</p>
<p>cut all their developers because one or two of them can do 10x the work. I think that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to try and accelerate their product roadmaps. Now, again, you have this long term concern that</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t need developers at all at some point. But I think that the benefits of developing</p>
<p>this technology are so great in the short to midterm that we&rsquo;re going down that path,</p>
<p>no matter what. And we&rsquo;re just gonna have to find out what that long term really looks like.</p>
<p>And maybe I completely look very different. I mean, once we get past the short term,</p>
<p>we may have a different long term view. I think in this narrow vertical,</p>
<p>I 100% agree with you. Look, I think that AI is going to eliminate unit testing,</p>
<p>it has already done. So it&rsquo;s going to eliminate most forms of coding, the engineers that you have,</p>
<p>all of them will now become 10x engineers. So with fewer of them, or with the same number,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to do as much or more than you could have before. That&rsquo;s a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>And all I&rsquo;m saying on that specific narrow vertical is you&rsquo;ll see it first rear its head</p>
<p>in companies like Accenture and TCS because and cognizant because they have an immediate incentive</p>
<p>to use this tooling to drive efficiency and profitability that&rsquo;s rewarded by shareholders,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be less visible in other companies. So but what I am saying, though, is that you have</p>
<p>to think about the impact on the end markets for a second. And I think that AI does something that</p>
<p>other technology layers have never done before, which is supplant human judgment in a closed loop</p>
<p>manner. And I just think it&rsquo;s worth appreciating that there are many systems and many jobs that</p>
<p>reply that rely on human judgment, where we deal with error bars, and an error rate</p>
<p>that a computer will just destroy and blow out of the water. And we will have to ask ourselves,</p>
<p>should this class of job exist with its inherent error rate? Or should it get replaced fully by a</p>
<p>computer which has no error rate? And I think that&rsquo;s an important question that&rsquo;s worth putting</p>
<p>on the table. Okay, so let&rsquo;s wrap here. I just have my final thought on it is like, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to see entire jobs, categories of jobs go away. We&rsquo;ve seen this before phone operators, travel</p>
<p>agents, copy editors, illustrators, logo designers, accountants, sales development reps,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of these job functions in the modern world, like phone operators previously,</p>
<p>I think these could wholesale just go away. And they would just be done by AI. And I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen in a very short period of time. And so it&rsquo;s going to be about who can transition.</p>
<p>And some people might not be able to make the transition. And that&rsquo;s going to be pain and</p>
<p>suffering. And it&rsquo;s going to be in the white collar ranks. And those people have more influence.</p>
<p>So I think this is could lead to some societal disturbance. I&rsquo;m going to learn Pilates and be</p>
<p>an influencer. That&rsquo;s it. But I do agree with sacks that the software development backlog,</p>
<p>if this is what you&rsquo;re saying is so great, that I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see it in software</p>
<p>development for a decade or two. There&rsquo;s just so much software that still needs to be made.</p>
<p>All right, last week, we talked about Tick Tock. And this first bipartisan hearing we&rsquo;ve seen in a</p>
<p>long time. And people actually, I think framing correctly exactly how dangerous it is, in my</p>
<p>opinion, to have Tick Tock in the United States. And of course, then we get the great disappointment</p>
<p>of the actual bill, the restrict act was proposed by Senator Mark Warner, Democrat Virginia,</p>
<p>on March 7. The problem with it is, is it seems like it&rsquo;s poorly worded,</p>
<p>that there will be civil penalties and criminal penalties to Americans for breaking</p>
<p>the law and using software that&rsquo;s been banned. And many people said, you know,</p>
<p>this probably is just bad language. I have a question. Yeah, does it does this apply to</p>
<p>incognito mode? Because if it doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know, it is not. Yes. They&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying that you can get, you know, you can get fined or 20 years in jail, whatever it is,</p>
<p>for using a VPN to VPN to Tick Tock. Freeberg, what are your thoughts on it?</p>
<p>Look, I think this is a real threat to the open internet. I&rsquo;m really concerned about the language</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been used, that basically speaks to protecting the safety and security of the</p>
<p>American people by actively monitoring network traffic, and making decisions about what network</p>
<p>traffic is and isn&rsquo;t allowed to be transmitted across the open internet. It&rsquo;s the first time</p>
<p>that I think in the United States, we are seeing like a real threat and a real set of behaviors</p>
<p>from our government that looks and feels a lot like what goes on in China and elsewhere,</p>
<p>where they operate with a closed internet and internet that&rsquo;s controlled, monitored, observed,</p>
<p>tracked, and gates are decided by some set of administrators on what is and isn&rsquo;t appropriate.</p>
<p>And the language is always the same. It&rsquo;s for safety and security of the people.</p>
<p>The entire purpose of the internet is that it did not have bounds that it did not have governments</p>
<p>that it did not have controls that it did not have systems that are politically and economically</p>
<p>influenced that the architecture of the internet was and always would be open. The protocols are</p>
<p>open, the transmission of data on that network would be open. And as a result, all people around</p>
<p>the world would have access to information of their choosing, and it allowed ultimate freedom</p>
<p>of choice. You know, this, this kind of is the first of what I&rsquo;m concerned, creates a precedent</p>
<p>that ultimately leads to a very slippery slope, saying that Tick Tock cannot make money in the</p>
<p>US by charging advertisers or managing commerce flows is one thing that&rsquo;s where the government</p>
<p>can and should and could, if they chose to have a role. But I think going in and observing,</p>
<p>tracking internet traffic and making decisions about what is and isn&rsquo;t appropriate for people,</p>
<p>I think, is one of the things that we all should be most concerned about what&rsquo;s going on right now.</p>
<p>There is no end in sight to this. If you allow this to happen in the first time, you know, VPNs,</p>
<p>virtual private networks allow you to anonymously access internet traffic and and</p>
<p>access internet traffic via remote destinations. So, so that the ultimate consumption of content</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using can&rsquo;t be tracked and monitored by local agencies or ISPs. And I think that saying</p>
<p>that that can now be restricted, takes away all ability to have true privacy and all rights to</p>
<p>privacy on the open internet. So I&rsquo;d love to talk about this more. Unfortunately, I got to run.</p>
<p>But this is a super threat to me. And I think this is something we should be super,</p>
<p>super concerned about. And that the entire community of technology, internet, and anyone</p>
<p>that wants to have, you know, freedom of choice, steps up and says, this is totally inappropriate</p>
<p>and overage. Yeah, there are other ways to manage stuff like this, like complete overreach sex.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is intentional overreach or poorly written or somewhere in between. What do you think?</p>
<p>Both. I think both. I think this is the biggest bait and switch that Washington,</p>
<p>the central government has ever tried to pull on us. Everybody thinks that they&rsquo;re just trying</p>
<p>to ban TikTok from operating in the US. And if that&rsquo;s all they did, then I think the bill would</p>
<p>be supported by most Americans. But that&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re doing. They&rsquo;re not restricting TikTok,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re restricting us. That&rsquo;s not the goal here. Yeah. What a bait and switch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge bait and switch. And so just so you know, what the app provides is that a US citizen</p>
<p>using a VPN to access TikTok could theoretically be subjected to a maximum penalty of 1 million</p>
<p>in fines or 20 years in prison or both. Now, you know, they&rsquo;ll say, you know, Mark Warner,</p>
<p>the sponsor of the legislation will swear up and down. That&rsquo;s not the intent. But the problem is</p>
<p>the language of the bill is so vague that some clever prosecutor may want to pursue this theory</p>
<p>one day. And that needs to be stopped. Also, there&rsquo;s another problem with the bill, which is</p>
<p>you think this is just about TikTok. It&rsquo;s not. What they do is it says here, I guess they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to mention TikTok by name. So they&rsquo;re trying to create a category of threatening application.</p>
<p>But because it is a category, it&rsquo;s very, very broad. So the bill states that it covers any</p>
<p>transaction, transaction, not just an app, in which an entity described in subparagraph B</p>
<p>has any interest. And then entities described in subparagraph B are, quote, a foreign adversary,</p>
<p>an entity subject to the jurisdiction of organizing the laws of a foreign adversary,</p>
<p>an entity owned, directed, or controlled by either of these. And then it gives the executive</p>
<p>branch the power to name a foreign adversary, any foreign government regime that one of the</p>
<p>cabinet secretaries defines, without any vote of Congress. So this is giving sweeping powers</p>
<p>to the executive branch to declare, you know, foreign companies to be enemies.</p>
<p>It feels like the plot of the prequels in Star Wars. Emergency powers, here we go.</p>
<p>You know, we criticize China for having a great firewall. What do you think this is?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this, this should obviously have nothing to do with the American consumer and</p>
<p>everything to do with a foreign adversary collecting data of Americans at scale. This</p>
<p>could be written in a much simpler way.</p>
<p>Yeah, it should be one sentence, which is that app stores are prohibited from</p>
<p>allowing TikTok to be an app in their store. That&rsquo;s what they do in India. That&rsquo;s it. Case</p>
<p>closed. Game over.</p>
<p>I think India is doing okay, right? They block like 100 Chinese apps,</p>
<p>and I think their society is still functioning. So, you know, all due respect to AOC,</p>
<p>you know, like the idea that 150 million Americans are going to suffer because they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be tracked by the CCP is kind of nuts.</p>
<p>This is going to give sweeping powers to the security state to surveil us, to prosecute us,</p>
<p>to limit our internet usage. This is basically the biggest power grab and bait and switch</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve ever tried to pull on us. And again, if they really were concerned about TikTok,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one sentence.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were done. All right, everybody, it&rsquo;s been an amazing episode for the Sultan of Science,</p>
<p>David Freeberg, the Rain Man himself, David Sachs, and the dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>I am the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator, and we will see you next time. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Open source it to the fans, and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>I love you, West. I&rsquo;m the queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>What your winner&rsquo;s like. What your winner&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What your beat.</p>
<p>What your beat.</p>
<p>What your beat.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
