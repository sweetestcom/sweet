    <p>The following is a conversation with Yann LeCun,</p>
<p>his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He is the chief AI scientist at Meta, formerly Facebook,</p>
<p>professor at NYU, touring award winner,</p>
<p>one of the seminal figures in the history</p>
<p>of machine learning and artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>and someone who is brilliant and opinionated</p>
<p>in the best kind of way.</p>
<p>And so it was always fun to talk to him.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Yann LeCun.</p>
<p>You cowrote the article,</p>
<p>Self Supervised Learning, the Dark Matter of Intelligence.</p>
<p>Great title, by the way, with Ishan Mizra.</p>
<p>So let me ask, what is self supervised learning,</p>
<p>and why is it the dark matter of intelligence?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start by the dark matter part.</p>
<p>There is obviously a kind of learning</p>
<p>that humans and animals are doing</p>
<p>that we currently are not reproducing properly</p>
<p>with machines or with AI, right?</p>
<p>So the most popular approaches to machine learning today are,</p>
<p>or paradigms, I should say,</p>
<p>are supervised learning and reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>And they are extremely inefficient.</p>
<p>Supervised learning requires many samples</p>
<p>for learning anything.</p>
<p>And reinforcement learning requires a ridiculously large</p>
<p>number of trial and errors for a system to learn anything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t have self driving cars.</p>
<p>That was a big leap from one to the other.</p>
<p>Okay, so that, to solve difficult problems,</p>
<p>you have to have a lot of human annotation</p>
<p>for supervised learning to work.</p>
<p>And to solve those difficult problems</p>
<p>with reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>you have to have some way to maybe simulate that problem</p>
<p>such that you can do that large scale kind of learning</p>
<p>that reinforcement learning requires.</p>
<p>Right, so how is it that most teenagers can learn</p>
<p>to drive a car in about 20 hours of practice,</p>
<p>whereas even with millions of hours of simulated practice,</p>
<p>a self driving car can&rsquo;t actually learn</p>
<p>to drive itself properly.</p>
<p>And so obviously we&rsquo;re missing something, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite obvious for a lot of people</p>
<p>that the immediate response you get from many people is,</p>
<p>well, humans use their background knowledge</p>
<p>to learn faster, and they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Now, how was that background knowledge acquired?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the big question.</p>
<p>So now you have to ask, how do babies</p>
<p>in the first few months of life learn how the world works?</p>
<p>Mostly by observation,</p>
<p>because they can hardly act in the world.</p>
<p>And they learn an enormous amount</p>
<p>of background knowledge about the world</p>
<p>that may be the basis of what we call common sense.</p>
<p>This type of learning is not learning a task.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not being reinforced for anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just observing the world and figuring out how it works.</p>
<p>Building world models, learning world models.</p>
<p>How do we do this?</p>
<p>And how do we reproduce this in machines?</p>
<p>So self supervised learning is one instance</p>
<p>or one attempt at trying to reproduce this kind of learning.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re looking at just observation,</p>
<p>so not even the interacting part of a child.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sitting there watching mom and dad walk around,</p>
<p>pick up stuff, all of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we mean about background knowledge.</p>
<p>Perhaps not even watching mom and dad,</p>
<p>just watching the world go by.</p>
<p>Just having eyes open or having eyes closed</p>
<p>or the very act of opening and closing eyes</p>
<p>that the world appears and disappears,</p>
<p>all that basic information.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying in order to learn to drive,</p>
<p>like the reason humans are able to learn to drive quickly,</p>
<p>some faster than others,</p>
<p>is because of the background knowledge.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to watch cars operate in the world</p>
<p>in the many years leading up to it,</p>
<p>the physics of basic objects, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, the basic physics of objects,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even need to know how a car works, right?</p>
<p>Because that you can learn fairly quickly.</p>
<p>I mean, the example I use very often</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re driving next to a cliff.</p>
<p>And you know in advance because of your understanding</p>
<p>of intuitive physics that if you turn the wheel</p>
<p>to the right, the car will veer to the right,</p>
<p>will run off the cliff, fall off the cliff,</p>
<p>and nothing good will come out of this, right?</p>
<p>But if you are a sort of tabularized</p>
<p>reinforcement learning system</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have a model of the world,</p>
<p>you have to repeat falling off this cliff</p>
<p>thousands of times before you figure out it&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>And then a few more thousand times</p>
<p>before you figure out how to not do it.</p>
<p>And then a few more million times</p>
<p>before you figure out how to not do it</p>
<p>in every situation you ever encounter.</p>
<p>So self supervised learning still has to have</p>
<p>some source of truth being told to it by somebody.</p>
<p>So you have to figure out a way without human assistance</p>
<p>or without significant amount of human assistance</p>
<p>to get that truth from the world.</p>
<p>So the mystery there is how much signal is there?</p>
<p>How much truth is there that the world gives you?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the human world,</p>
<p>like you watch YouTube or something like that,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the more natural world.</p>
<p>So how much signal is there?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the trick.</p>
<p>There is way more signal in sort of a self supervised</p>
<p>setting than there is in either a supervised</p>
<p>or reinforcement setting.</p>
<p>And this is going to my analogy of the cake.</p>
<p>The cake as someone has called it,</p>
<p>where when you try to figure out how much information</p>
<p>you ask the machine to predict</p>
<p>and how much feedback you give the machine at every trial,</p>
<p>in reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>you give the machine a single scalar.</p>
<p>You tell the machine you did good, you did bad.</p>
<p>And you only tell this to the machine once in a while.</p>
<p>When I say you, it could be the universe</p>
<p>telling the machine, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just one scalar.</p>
<p>And so as a consequence,</p>
<p>you cannot possibly learn something very complicated</p>
<p>without many, many, many trials</p>
<p>where you get many, many feedbacks of this type.</p>
<p>Supervised learning, you give a few bits to the machine</p>
<p>at every sample.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re training a system on recognizing images</p>
<p>on ImageNet with 1000 categories,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little less than 10 bits of information per sample.</p>
<p>But self supervised learning, here is the setting.</p>
<p>Ideally, we don&rsquo;t know how to do this yet,</p>
<p>but ideally you would show a machine a segment of video</p>
<p>and then stop the video and ask the machine to predict</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>And so we let the machine predict</p>
<p>and then you let time go by</p>
<p>and show the machine what actually happened</p>
<p>and hope the machine will learn to do a better job</p>
<p>at predicting next time around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of information you give the machine</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an entire video clip</p>
<p>of the future after the video clip you fed it</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>So both for language and for vision, there&rsquo;s a subtle,</p>
<p>seemingly trivial construction,</p>
<p>but maybe that&rsquo;s representative</p>
<p>of what is required to create intelligence,</p>
<p>which is filling the gap.</p>
<p>So it sounds dumb, but can you,</p>
<p>it is possible you could solve all of intelligence</p>
<p>in this way, just for both language,</p>
<p>just give a sentence and continue it</p>
<p>or give a sentence and there&rsquo;s a gap in it,</p>
<p>some words blanked out and you fill in what words go there.</p>
<p>For vision, you give a sequence of images</p>
<p>and predict what&rsquo;s going to happen next,</p>
<p>or you fill in what happened in between.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that formulation alone</p>
<p>as a signal for self supervised learning</p>
<p>can solve intelligence for vision and language?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the best shot at the moment.</p>
<p>So whether this will take us all the way</p>
<p>to human level intelligence or something,</p>
<p>or just cat level intelligence is not clear,</p>
<p>but among all the possible approaches</p>
<p>that people have proposed, I think it&rsquo;s our best shot.</p>
<p>So I think this idea of an intelligent system</p>
<p>filling in the blanks, either predicting the future,</p>
<p>inferring the past, filling in missing information,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently filling the blank</p>
<p>of what is behind your head</p>
<p>and what your head looks like from the back,</p>
<p>because I have basic knowledge about how humans are made.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to say,</p>
<p>at which point you&rsquo;re going to speak,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re going to move your head this way or that way,</p>
<p>which way you&rsquo;re going to look,</p>
<p>but I know you&rsquo;re not going to just dematerialize</p>
<p>and reappear three meters down the hall,</p>
<p>because I know what&rsquo;s possible and what&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>according to intuitive physics.</p>
<p>You have a model of what&rsquo;s possible and what&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d be very surprised if it happens</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll have to reconstruct your model.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s the model of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what tells you, what fills in the blanks.</p>
<p>So given your partial information about the state</p>
<p>of the world, given by your perception,</p>
<p>your model of the world fills in the missing information</p>
<p>and that includes predicting the future,</p>
<p>re predicting the past, filling in things</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t immediately perceive.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t have to be purely generic vision</p>
<p>or visual information or generic language.</p>
<p>You can go to specifics like predicting</p>
<p>what control decision you make when you&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>in a lane, you have a sequence of images from a vehicle</p>
<p>and then you have information if you record it on video</p>
<p>where the car ended up going so you can go back in time</p>
<p>and predict where the car went</p>
<p>based on the visual information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very specific, domain specific.</p>
<p>Right, but the question is whether we can come up</p>
<p>with sort of a generic method for training machines</p>
<p>to do this kind of prediction or filling in the blanks.</p>
<p>So right now, this type of approach has been unbelievably</p>
<p>successful in the context of natural language processing.</p>
<p>Every modern natural language processing is pre trained</p>
<p>in self supervised manner to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>You show it a sequence of words, you remove 10% of them</p>
<p>and then you train some gigantic neural net</p>
<p>to predict the words that are missing.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;ve pre trained that network,</p>
<p>you can use the internal representation learned by it</p>
<p>as input to something that you train supervised</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been incredibly successful.</p>
<p>Not so successful in images, although it&rsquo;s making progress</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s based on sort of manual data augmentation.</p>
<p>We can go into this later,</p>
<p>but what has not been successful yet is training from video.</p>
<p>So getting a machine to learn to represent</p>
<p>the visual world, for example, by just watching video.</p>
<p>Nobody has really succeeded in doing this.</p>
<p>Okay, well, let&rsquo;s kind of give a high level overview.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference in kind and in difficulty</p>
<p>between vision and language?</p>
<p>So you said people haven&rsquo;t been able to really</p>
<p>kind of crack the problem of vision open</p>
<p>in terms of self supervised learning,</p>
<p>but that may not be necessarily</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fundamentally more difficult.</p>
<p>Maybe like when we&rsquo;re talking about achieving,</p>
<p>like passing the Turing test in the full spirit</p>
<p>of the Turing test in language might be harder than vision.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>So in your view, which is harder</p>
<p>or perhaps are they just the same problem?</p>
<p>When the farther we get to solving each,</p>
<p>the more we realize it&rsquo;s all the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same cake.</p>
<p>I think what I&rsquo;m looking for are methods</p>
<p>that make them look essentially like the same cake,</p>
<p>but currently they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And the main issue with learning world models</p>
<p>or learning predictive models is that the prediction</p>
<p>is never a single thing</p>
<p>because the world is not entirely predictable.</p>
<p>It may be deterministic or stochastic.</p>
<p>We can get into the philosophical discussion about it,</p>
<p>but even if it&rsquo;s deterministic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not entirely predictable.</p>
<p>And so if I play a short video clip</p>
<p>and then I ask you to predict what&rsquo;s going to happen next,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many, many plausible continuations</p>
<p>for that video clip and the number of continuation grows</p>
<p>with the interval of time that you&rsquo;re asking the system</p>
<p>to make a prediction for.</p>
<p>And so one big question with self supervised learning</p>
<p>is how you represent this uncertainty,</p>
<p>how you represent multiple discrete outcomes,</p>
<p>how you represent a sort of continuum</p>
<p>of possible outcomes, et cetera.</p>
<p>And if you are sort of a classical machine learning person,</p>
<p>you say, oh, you just represent a distribution, right?</p>
<p>And that we know how to do when we&rsquo;re predicting words,</p>
<p>missing words in the text,</p>
<p>because you can have a neural net give a score</p>
<p>for every word in the dictionary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big list of numbers, maybe 100,000 or so.</p>
<p>And you can turn them into a probability distribution</p>
<p>that tells you when I say a sentence,</p>
<p>the cat is chasing the blank in the kitchen.</p>
<p>There are only a few words that make sense there.</p>
<p>It could be a mouse or it could be a lizard spot</p>
<p>or something like that, right?</p>
<p>And if I say the blank is chasing the blank in the Savannah,</p>
<p>you also have a bunch of plausible options</p>
<p>for those two words, right?</p>
<p>Because you have kind of a underlying reality</p>
<p>that you can refer to to sort of fill in those blanks.</p>
<p>So you cannot say for sure in the Savannah,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a lion or a cheetah or whatever,</p>
<p>you cannot know if it&rsquo;s a zebra or a do or whatever,</p>
<p>wildebeest, the same thing.</p>
<p>But you can represent the uncertainty</p>
<p>by just a long list of numbers.</p>
<p>Now, if I do the same thing with video,</p>
<p>when I ask you to predict a video clip,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a discrete set of potential frames.</p>
<p>You have to have somewhere representing</p>
<p>a sort of infinite number of plausible continuations</p>
<p>of multiple frames in a high dimensional continuous space.</p>
<p>And we just have no idea how to do this properly.</p>
<p>Fine night, high dimensional.</p>
<p>So like you,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s finite high dimensional, yes.</p>
<p>Just like the words,</p>
<p>they try to get it down to a small finite set</p>
<p>of like under a million, something like that.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>a distribution over every single possible word</p>
<p>for language and it works.</p>
<p>It feels like that&rsquo;s a really dumb way to do it.</p>
<p>Like there seems to be like there should be</p>
<p>some more compressed representation</p>
<p>of the distribution of the words.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>And so do you have any interesting ideas</p>
<p>about how to represent all of reality in a compressed way</p>
<p>such that you can form a distribution over it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the big questions, how do you do that?</p>
<p>Right, I mean, what&rsquo;s kind of another thing</p>
<p>that really is stupid about, I shouldn&rsquo;t say stupid,</p>
<p>but like simplistic about current approaches</p>
<p>to self supervised learning in NLP in text</p>
<p>is that not only do you represent</p>
<p>a giant distribution over words,</p>
<p>but for multiple words that are missing,</p>
<p>those distributions are essentially independent</p>
<p>of each other.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t pay too much of a price for this.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t, so the system in the sentence</p>
<p>that I gave earlier, if it gives a certain probability</p>
<p>for a lion and cheetah, and then a certain probability</p>
<p>for gazelle, wildebeest and zebra,</p>
<p>those two probabilities are independent of each other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the case that those things are independent.</p>
<p>Lions actually attack like bigger animals than cheetahs.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge independent hypothesis in this process,</p>
<p>which is not actually true.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to represent properly distributions</p>
<p>over combinatorial sequences of symbols,</p>
<p>essentially because the number grows exponentially</p>
<p>with the length of the symbols.</p>
<p>And so we have to use tricks for this,</p>
<p>but those techniques can get around,</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t even deal with it.</p>
<p>So the big question is would there be some sort</p>
<p>of abstract latent representation of text</p>
<p>that would say that when I switch lion for gazelle,</p>
<p>lion for cheetah, I also have to switch zebra for gazelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this independence assumption,</p>
<p>let me throw some criticism at you that I often hear</p>
<p>and see how you respond.</p>
<p>So this kind of filling in the blanks is just statistics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not learning anything</p>
<p>like the deep underlying concepts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just mimicking stuff from the past.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not learning anything new such that you can use it</p>
<p>to generalize about the world.</p>
<p>Or okay, let me just say the crude version,</p>
<p>which is just statistics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not intelligence.</p>
<p>What do you have to say to that?</p>
<p>What do you usually say to that</p>
<p>if you kind of hear this kind of thing?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get into those discussions</p>
<p>because they are kind of pointless.</p>
<p>So first of all, it&rsquo;s quite possible</p>
<p>that intelligence is just statistics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just statistics of a particular kind.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the philosophical question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of is it possible</p>
<p>that intelligence is just statistics?</p>
<p>Yeah, but what kind of statistics?</p>
<p>So if you are asking the question,</p>
<p>are the models of the world that we learn,</p>
<p>do they have some notion of causality?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So if the criticism comes from people who say,</p>
<p>current machine learning system don&rsquo;t care about causality,</p>
<p>which by the way is wrong, I agree with them.</p>
<p>Your model of the world should have your actions</p>
<p>as one of the inputs.</p>
<p>And that will drive you to learn causal models of the world</p>
<p>where you know what intervention in the world</p>
<p>will cause what result.</p>
<p>Or you can do this by observation of other agents</p>
<p>acting in the world and observing the effect.</p>
<p>Other humans, for example.</p>
<p>So I think at some level of description,</p>
<p>intelligence is just statistics.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t have models</p>
<p>that have deep mechanistic explanation for what goes on.</p>
<p>The question is how do you learn them?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people who actually voice their criticism</p>
<p>say that those mechanistic model</p>
<p>have to come from someplace else.</p>
<p>They have to come from human designers,</p>
<p>they have to come from I don&rsquo;t know what.</p>
<p>And obviously we learn them.</p>
<p>Or if we don&rsquo;t learn them as an individual,</p>
<p>nature learn them for us using evolution.</p>
<p>So regardless of what you think,</p>
<p>those processes have been learned somehow.</p>
<p>So if you look at the human brain,</p>
<p>just like when we humans introspect</p>
<p>about how the brain works,</p>
<p>it seems like when we think about what is intelligence,</p>
<p>we think about the high level stuff,</p>
<p>like the models we&rsquo;ve constructed,</p>
<p>concepts like cognitive science,</p>
<p>like concepts of memory and reasoning module,</p>
<p>almost like these high level modules.</p>
<p>Is this serve as a good analogy?</p>
<p>Like are we ignoring the dark matter,</p>
<p>the basic low level mechanisms?</p>
<p>Just like we ignore the way the operating system works,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just using the high level software.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re ignoring that at the low level,</p>
<p>the neural network might be doing something like statistics.</p>
<p>Like meaning, sorry to use this word</p>
<p>probably incorrectly and crudely,</p>
<p>but doing this kind of fill in the gap kind of learning</p>
<p>and just kind of updating the model constantly</p>
<p>in order to be able to support the raw sensory information</p>
<p>to predict it and then adjust to the prediction</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>But like when we look at our brain at the high level,</p>
<p>it feels like we&rsquo;re doing, like we&rsquo;re playing chess,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re like playing with high level concepts</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re stitching them together</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re putting them into longterm memory.</p>
<p>But really what&rsquo;s going underneath</p>
<p>is something we&rsquo;re not able to introspect,</p>
<p>which is this kind of simple, large neural network</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just filling in the gaps.</p>
<p>Right, well, okay.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of questions and a lot of answers there.</p>
<p>Okay, so first of all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole school of thought in neuroscience,</p>
<p>computational neuroscience in particular,</p>
<p>that likes the idea of predictive coding,</p>
<p>which is really related to the idea</p>
<p>I was talking about in self supervised learning.</p>
<p>So everything is about prediction.</p>
<p>The essence of intelligence is the ability to predict</p>
<p>and everything the brain does is trying to predict,</p>
<p>predict everything from everything else.</p>
<p>Okay, and that&rsquo;s really sort of the underlying principle,</p>
<p>if you want, that self supervised learning</p>
<p>is trying to kind of reproduce this idea of prediction</p>
<p>as kind of an essential mechanism</p>
<p>of task independent learning, if you want.</p>
<p>The next step is what kind of intelligence</p>
<p>are you interested in reproducing?</p>
<p>And of course, we all think about trying to reproduce</p>
<p>sort of high level cognitive processes in humans,</p>
<p>but like with machines, we&rsquo;re not even at the level</p>
<p>of even reproducing the learning processes in a cat brain.</p>
<p>The most intelligent or intelligent systems</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have as much common sense as a house cat.</p>
<p>So how is it that cats learn?</p>
<p>And cats don&rsquo;t do a whole lot of reasoning.</p>
<p>They certainly have causal models.</p>
<p>They certainly have, because many cats can figure out</p>
<p>how they can act on the world to get what they want.</p>
<p>They certainly have a fantastic model of intuitive physics,</p>
<p>certainly the dynamics of their own bodies,</p>
<p>but also of praise and things like that.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re pretty smart.</p>
<p>They only do this with about 800 million neurons.</p>
<p>We are not anywhere close to reproducing this kind of thing.</p>
<p>So to some extent, I could say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not even worry about like the high level cognition</p>
<p>and kind of longterm planning and reasoning</p>
<p>that humans can do until we figure out like,</p>
<p>can we even reproduce what cats are doing?</p>
<p>Now that said, this ability to learn world models,</p>
<p>I think is the key to the possibility of learning machines</p>
<p>that can also reason.</p>
<p>So whenever I give a talk, I say there are three challenges</p>
<p>in the three main challenges in machine learning.</p>
<p>The first one is getting machines to learn</p>
<p>to represent the world</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m proposing self supervised learning.</p>
<p>The second is getting machines to reason</p>
<p>in ways that are compatible</p>
<p>with essentially gradient based learning</p>
<p>because this is what deep learning is all about really.</p>
<p>And the third one is something</p>
<p>we have no idea how to solve,</p>
<p>at least I have no idea how to solve</p>
<p>is can we get machines to learn hierarchical representations</p>
<p>of action plans?</p>
<p>We know how to train them</p>
<p>to learn hierarchical representations of perception</p>
<p>with convolutional nets and things like that</p>
<p>and transformers, but what about action plans?</p>
<p>Can we get them to spontaneously learn</p>
<p>good hierarchical representations of actions?</p>
<p>Also gradient based.</p>
<p>Yeah, all of that needs to be somewhat differentiable</p>
<p>so that you can apply sort of gradient based learning,</p>
<p>which is really what deep learning is about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s background, knowledge, ability to reason</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s differentiable</p>
<p>that is somehow connected, deeply integrated</p>
<p>with that background knowledge</p>
<p>or builds on top of that background knowledge</p>
<p>and then given that background knowledge</p>
<p>be able to make hierarchical plans in the world.</p>
<p>So if you take classical optimal control,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something in classical optimal control</p>
<p>called model predictive control.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been around since the early sixties.</p>
<p>NASA uses that to compute trajectories of rockets.</p>
<p>And the basic idea is that you have a predictive model</p>
<p>of the rocket, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>or whatever system you intend to control,</p>
<p>which given the state of the system at time T</p>
<p>and given an action that you&rsquo;re taking the system.</p>
<p>So for a rocket to be thrust</p>
<p>and all the controls you can have,</p>
<p>it gives you the state of the system</p>
<p>at time T plus Delta T, right?</p>
<p>So basically a differential equation, something like that.</p>
<p>And if you have this model</p>
<p>and you have this model in the form of some sort of neural net</p>
<p>or some sort of a set of formula</p>
<p>that you can back propagate gradient through,</p>
<p>you can do what&rsquo;s called model predictive control</p>
<p>or gradient based model predictive control.</p>
<p>So you can unroll that model in time.</p>
<p>You feed it a hypothesized sequence of actions.</p>
<p>And then you have some objective function</p>
<p>that measures how well at the end of the trajectory,</p>
<p>the system has succeeded or matched what you wanted to do.</p>
<p>Is it a robot harm?</p>
<p>Have you grasped the object you want to grasp?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a rocket, are you at the right place</p>
<p>near the space station, things like that.</p>
<p>And by back propagation through time,</p>
<p>and again, this was invented in the 1960s,</p>
<p>by optimal control theorists, you can figure out</p>
<p>what is the optimal sequence of actions</p>
<p>that will get my system to the best final state.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a form of reasoning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically planning.</p>
<p>And a lot of planning systems in robotics</p>
<p>are actually based on this.</p>
<p>And you can think of this as a form of reasoning.</p>
<p>So to take the example of the teenager driving a car,</p>
<p>you have a pretty good dynamical model of the car.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to be very accurate.</p>
<p>But you know, again, that if you turn the wheel</p>
<p>to the right and there is a cliff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna run off the cliff, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to have a very accurate model</p>
<p>to predict that.</p>
<p>And you can run this in your mind</p>
<p>and decide not to do it for that reason.</p>
<p>Because you can predict in advance</p>
<p>that the result is gonna be bad.</p>
<p>So you can sort of imagine different scenarios</p>
<p>and then employ or take the first step</p>
<p>in the scenario that is most favorable</p>
<p>and then repeat the process again.</p>
<p>The scenario that is most favorable</p>
<p>and then repeat the process of planning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called receding horizon model predictive control.</p>
<p>So even all those things have names going back decades.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re not a classical optimal control,</p>
<p>the model of the world is not generally learned.</p>
<p>Sometimes a few parameters you have to identify.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called systems identification.</p>
<p>But generally, the model is mostly deterministic</p>
<p>and mostly built by hand.</p>
<p>So the question of AI,</p>
<p>I think the big challenge of AI for the next decade</p>
<p>is how do we get machines to learn predictive models</p>
<p>of the world that deal with uncertainty</p>
<p>and deal with the real world in all this complexity?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the trajectory of a rocket,</p>
<p>which you can reduce to first principles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even just the trajectory of a robot arm,</p>
<p>which again, you can model by careful mathematics.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s everything else,</p>
<p>everything we observe in the world.</p>
<p>People, behavior,</p>
<p>physical systems that involve collective phenomena,</p>
<p>like water or trees and branches in a tree or something</p>
<p>or complex things that humans have no trouble</p>
<p>developing abstract representations</p>
<p>and predictive model for,</p>
<p>but we still don&rsquo;t know how to do with machines.</p>
<p>Where do you put in these three,</p>
<p>maybe in the planning stages,</p>
<p>the game theoretic nature of this world,</p>
<p>where your actions not only respond</p>
<p>to the dynamic nature of the world, the environment,</p>
<p>but also affect it.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s other humans involved,</p>
<p>is this point number four,</p>
<p>or is it somehow integrated</p>
<p>into the hierarchical representation of action</p>
<p>in your view?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s integrated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that now your model of the world has to deal with,</p>
<p>it just makes it more complicated.</p>
<p>The fact that humans are complicated</p>
<p>and not easily predictable,</p>
<p>that makes your model of the world much more complicated,</p>
<p>that much more complicated.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a chess,</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose chess is an analogy.</p>
<p>So multicolored tree search.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, I go, you go, I go, you go.</p>
<p>Like Andre Capote recently gave a talk at MIT</p>
<p>about car doors.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some machine learning too,</p>
<p>but mostly car doors.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a dynamic nature to the car,</p>
<p>like the person opening the door,</p>
<p>checking, I mean, he wasn&rsquo;t talking about that.</p>
<p>He was talking about the perception problem</p>
<p>of what the ontology of what defines a car door,</p>
<p>this big philosophical question.</p>
<p>But to me, it was interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s obvious that the person opening the car doors,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get out, like here in New York,</p>
<p>trying to get out of the car.</p>
<p>You slowing down is going to signal something.</p>
<p>You speeding up is gonna signal something,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a dance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a asynchronous chess game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So it feels like it&rsquo;s not just,</p>
<p>I mean, I guess you can integrate all of them</p>
<p>to one giant model, like the entirety</p>
<p>of these little interactions.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not as complicated as chess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a little dance.</p>
<p>We do like a little dance together,</p>
<p>and then we figure it out.</p>
<p>Well, in some ways it&rsquo;s way more complicated than chess</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s continuous, it&rsquo;s uncertain</p>
<p>in a continuous manner.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel more complicated.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t feel more complicated</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve evolved to solve.</p>
<p>This is the kind of problem we&rsquo;ve evolved to solve.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re good at it</p>
<p>because nature has made us good at it.</p>
<p>Nature has not made us good at chess.</p>
<p>We completely suck at chess.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s why we designed it as a game,</p>
<p>is to be challenging.</p>
<p>And if there is something that recent progress</p>
<p>in chess and Go has made us realize</p>
<p>is that humans are really terrible at those things,</p>
<p>like really bad.</p>
<p>There was a story right before AlphaGo</p>
<p>that the best Go players thought</p>
<p>there were maybe two or three stones behind an ideal player</p>
<p>that they would call God.</p>
<p>In fact, no, there are like nine or 10 stones behind.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re just bad.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not good at,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because we have limited working memory.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not very good at doing this tree exploration</p>
<p>that computers are much better at doing than we are.</p>
<p>But we are much better</p>
<p>at learning differentiable models to the world.</p>
<p>I mean, I said differentiable in a kind of,</p>
<p>I should say not differentiable in the sense that</p>
<p>we went back far through it,</p>
<p>but in the sense that our brain has some mechanism</p>
<p>for estimating gradients of some kind.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes us efficient.</p>
<p>So if you have an agent that consists of a model</p>
<p>of the world, which in the human brain</p>
<p>is basically the entire front half of your brain,</p>
<p>an objective function,</p>
<p>which in humans is a combination of two things.</p>
<p>There is your sort of intrinsic motivation module,</p>
<p>which is in the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>the base of your brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that measures pain and hunger</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>like immediate feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>And then there is the equivalent</p>
<p>of what people in reinforcement learning call a critic,</p>
<p>which is a sort of module that predicts ahead</p>
<p>what the outcome of a situation will be.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not a cost function,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of not an objective function,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of a train predictor</p>
<p>of the ultimate objective function.</p>
<p>And that also is differentiable.</p>
<p>And so if all of this is differentiable,</p>
<p>your cost function, your critic, your world model,</p>
<p>then you can use gradient based type methods</p>
<p>to do planning, to do reasoning, to do learning,</p>
<p>to do all the things that we&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>an intelligent agent to do.</p>
<p>And gradient based learning,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably at the core of what can solve intelligence.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need like logic based reasoning in your view.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to make logic based reasoning</p>
<p>compatible with efficient learning.</p>
<p>Okay, I mean, there is a big question,</p>
<p>perhaps a philosophical question.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not that philosophical,</p>
<p>but that we can ask is that all the learning algorithms</p>
<p>we know from engineering and computer science</p>
<p>proceed by optimizing some objective function.</p>
<p>So one question we may ask is,</p>
<p>does learning in the brain minimize an objective function?</p>
<p>I mean, it could be a composite</p>
<p>of multiple objective functions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still an objective function.</p>
<p>Second, if it does optimize an objective function,</p>
<p>does it do it by some sort of gradient estimation?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to be a back prop,</p>
<p>but some way of estimating the gradient in efficient manner</p>
<p>whose complexity is on the same order of magnitude</p>
<p>as actually running the inference.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t afford to do things</p>
<p>like perturbing a weight in your brain</p>
<p>to figure out what the effect is.</p>
<p>And then sort of, you can do sort of</p>
<p>estimating gradient by perturbation.</p>
<p>To me, it seems very implausible</p>
<p>that the brain uses some sort of zeroth order black box</p>
<p>gradient free optimization,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so much less efficient</p>
<p>than gradient optimization.</p>
<p>So it has to have a way of estimating gradient.</p>
<p>Is it possible that some kind of logic based reasoning</p>
<p>emerges in pockets as a useful,</p>
<p>like you said, if the brain is an objective function,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a mechanism for creating objective functions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mechanism for creating knowledge bases, for example,</p>
<p>that can then be queried.</p>
<p>Like maybe it&rsquo;s like an efficient representation</p>
<p>of knowledge that&rsquo;s learned in a gradient based way</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Well, so I think there is a lot of different types</p>
<p>of intelligence.</p>
<p>So first of all, I think the type of logical reasoning</p>
<p>that we think about that we are maybe stemming</p>
<p>from sort of classical AI of the 1970s and 80s.</p>
<p>I think humans use that relatively rarely</p>
<p>and are not particularly good at it.</p>
<p>But we judge each other based on our ability</p>
<p>to solve those rare problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called an IQ test.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not very good at chess.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m judging you this whole time.</p>
<p>Because, well, we actually.</p>
<p>With your heritage, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re good at chess.</p>
<p>No, stereotypes.</p>
<p>Not all stereotypes are true.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m terrible at chess.</p>
<p>So, but I think perhaps another type of intelligence</p>
<p>that I have is this ability of sort of building models</p>
<p>to the world from reasoning obviously,</p>
<p>but also data.</p>
<p>And those models generally are more kind of analogical.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s reasoning by simulation,</p>
<p>and by analogy, where you use one model</p>
<p>to apply to a new situation.</p>
<p>Even though you&rsquo;ve never seen that situation,</p>
<p>you can sort of connect it to a situation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve encountered before.</p>
<p>And your reasoning is more akin</p>
<p>to some sort of internal simulation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of simulating what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re building, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a box out of wood or something, right?</p>
<p>You can imagine in advance what would be the result</p>
<p>of cutting the wood in this particular way.</p>
<p>Are you going to use screws or nails or whatever?</p>
<p>When you are interacting with someone,</p>
<p>you also have a model of that person</p>
<p>and sort of interact with that person,</p>
<p>having this model in mind to kind of tell the person</p>
<p>what you think is useful to them.</p>
<p>So I think this ability to construct models to the world</p>
<p>is basically the essence, the essence of intelligence.</p>
<p>And the ability to use it then to plan actions</p>
<p>that will fulfill a particular criterion,</p>
<p>of course, is necessary as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to ask you a series of impossible questions</p>
<p>as we keep asking, as I&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s the fundamental sort of dark matter</p>
<p>of intelligence, this ability to form a background model,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your intuition about how much knowledge is required?</p>
<p>You know, I think dark matter,</p>
<p>you could put a percentage on it</p>
<p>of the composition of the universe</p>
<p>and how much of it is dark matter,</p>
<p>how much of it is dark energy,</p>
<p>how much information do you think is required</p>
<p>to be a house cat?</p>
<p>So you have to be able to, when you see a box going in,</p>
<p>when you see a human compute the most evil action,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a thing that&rsquo;s near an edge,</p>
<p>you knock it off, all of that,</p>
<p>plus the extra stuff you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is a great self awareness of the physics</p>
<p>of your own body and the world.</p>
<p>How much knowledge is required, do you think, to solve it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to measure an answer to that question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how to measure it,</p>
<p>but whatever it is, it fits in about 800,000 neurons,</p>
<p>800 million neurons.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the representation does?</p>
<p>Everything, all knowledge, everything, right?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s less than a billion.</p>
<p>A dog is 2 billion, but a cat is less than 1 billion.</p>
<p>And so multiply that by a thousand</p>
<p>and you get the number of synapses.</p>
<p>And I think almost all of it is learned</p>
<p>through this, you know, a sort of self supervised running,</p>
<p>although, you know, I think a tiny sliver</p>
<p>is learned through reinforcement running</p>
<p>and certainly very little through, you know,</p>
<p>classical supervised running,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not even clear how supervised running</p>
<p>actually works in the biological world.</p>
<p>So I think almost all of it is self supervised running,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s driven by the sort of ingrained objective functions</p>
<p>that a cat or a human have at the base of their brain,</p>
<p>which kind of drives their behavior.</p>
<p>So, you know, nature tells us you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t tell us how to feed ourselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that the rest of our brain</p>
<p>has to figure out, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is there might be more</p>
<p>like deeper objective functions</p>
<p>than allowing the whole thing.</p>
<p>So hunger may be some kind of,</p>
<p>now you go to like neurobiology,</p>
<p>it might be just the brain trying to maintain homeostasis.</p>
<p>So hunger is just one of the human perceivable symptoms</p>
<p>of the brain being unhappy</p>
<p>with the way things are currently.</p>
<p>It could be just like one really dumb objective function</p>
<p>at the core.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how behavior is driven.</p>
<p>The fact that, you know, or basal ganglia</p>
<p>drive us to do things that are different</p>
<p>from say an orangutan or certainly a cat</p>
<p>is what makes, you know, human nature</p>
<p>versus orangutan nature versus cat nature.</p>
<p>So for example, you know, our basal ganglia</p>
<p>drives us to seek the company of other humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because nature has figured out</p>
<p>that we need to be social animals for our species to survive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true of many primates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true of orangutans.</p>
<p>Orangutans are solitary animals.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seek the company of others.</p>
<p>In fact, they avoid them.</p>
<p>In fact, they scream at them when they come too close</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re territorial.</p>
<p>Because for their survival, you know,</p>
<p>evolution has figured out that&rsquo;s the best thing.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re occasionally social, of course,</p>
<p>for, you know, reproduction and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re mostly solitary.</p>
<p>So all of those behaviors are not part of intelligence.</p>
<p>You know, people say,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re never gonna have intelligent machines</p>
<p>because, you know, human intelligence is social.</p>
<p>But then you look at orangutans, you look at octopus.</p>
<p>Octopus never know their parents.</p>
<p>They barely interact with any other.</p>
<p>And they get to be really smart in less than a year,</p>
<p>in like half a year.</p>
<p>You know, in a year, they&rsquo;re adults.</p>
<p>In two years, they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>So there are things that we think, as humans,</p>
<p>are intimately linked with intelligence,</p>
<p>like social interaction, like language.</p>
<p>We think, I think we give way too much importance</p>
<p>to language as a substrate of intelligence as humans.</p>
<p>Because we think our reasoning is so linked with language.</p>
<p>So to solve the house cat intelligence problem,</p>
<p>you think you could do it on a desert island.</p>
<p>You could have, you could just have a cat sitting there</p>
<p>looking at the waves, at the ocean waves,</p>
<p>and figure a lot of it out.</p>
<p>It needs to have sort of, you know,</p>
<p>the right set of drives to kind of, you know,</p>
<p>get it to do the thing and learn the appropriate things,</p>
<p>right, but like for example, you know,</p>
<p>baby humans are driven to learn to stand up and walk.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s kind of, this desire is hardwired.</p>
<p>How to do it precisely is not, that&rsquo;s learned.</p>
<p>But the desire to walk, move around and stand up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of probably hardwired.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very simple to hardwire this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, like the desire to, well, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hardwired to want to walk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s gotta be a deeper need for walking.</p>
<p>I think it was probably socially imposed by society</p>
<p>that you need to walk all the other bipedal.</p>
<p>No, like a lot of simple animals that, you know,</p>
<p>will probably walk without ever watching</p>
<p>any other members of the species.</p>
<p>It seems like a scary thing to have to do</p>
<p>because you suck at bipedal walking at first.</p>
<p>It seems crawling is much safer, much more like,</p>
<p>why are you in a hurry?</p>
<p>Well, because you have this thing that drives you to do it,</p>
<p>you know, which is sort of part of the sort of</p>
<p>human development.</p>
<p>Is that understood actually what?</p>
<p>Not entirely, no.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the reason you get on two feet?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>Like most animals don&rsquo;t get on two feet.</p>
<p>Well, they get on four feet.</p>
<p>You know, many mammals get on four feet.</p>
<p>Yeah, they do. Very quickly.</p>
<p>Some of them extremely quickly.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, you know, like from the last time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve interacted with a table,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more stable than a thing than two legs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a really hard problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, birds have figured it out with two feet.</p>
<p>Well, technically we can go into ontology.</p>
<p>They have four, I guess they have two feet.</p>
<p>They have two feet.</p>
<p>Chickens.</p>
<p>You know, dinosaurs have two feet, many of them.</p>
<p>Allegedly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just now learning that T. rex was eating grass,</p>
<p>not other animals.</p>
<p>T. rex might&rsquo;ve been a friendly pet.</p>
<p>What do you think about,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you looked at the test</p>
<p>for general intelligence that Fran√ßois Chollet put together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you got a chance to look</p>
<p>at that kind of thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition about how to solve</p>
<p>like an IQ type of test?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so outside of my radar screen</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not really relevant, I think, in the short term.</p>
<p>Well, I guess one way to ask,</p>
<p>another way, perhaps more closer to what do you work is like,</p>
<p>how do you solve MNIST with very little example data?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the answer to this probably</p>
<p>is self supervised learning.</p>
<p>Just learn to represent images</p>
<p>and then learning to recognize handwritten digits</p>
<p>on top of this will only require a few samples.</p>
<p>And we observe this in humans, right?</p>
<p>You show a young child a picture book</p>
<p>with a couple of pictures of an elephant and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>The child knows what an elephant is.</p>
<p>And we see this today with practical systems</p>
<p>that we train image recognition systems</p>
<p>with enormous amounts of images,</p>
<p>either completely self supervised</p>
<p>or very weakly supervised.</p>
<p>For example, you can train a neural net</p>
<p>to predict whatever hashtag people type on Instagram, right?</p>
<p>Then you can do this with billions of images</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s billions per day that are showing up.</p>
<p>So the amount of training data there</p>
<p>is essentially unlimited.</p>
<p>And then you take the output representation,</p>
<p>a couple of layers down from the outputs</p>
<p>of what the system learned and feed this as input</p>
<p>to a classifier for any object in the world that you want</p>
<p>and it works pretty well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s transfer learning, okay?</p>
<p>Or weakly supervised transfer learning.</p>
<p>People are making very, very fast progress</p>
<p>using self supervised learning</p>
<p>for this kind of scenario as well.</p>
<p>And my guess is that that&rsquo;s gonna be the future.</p>
<p>For self supervised learning,</p>
<p>how much cleaning do you think is needed</p>
<p>for filtering malicious signal or what&rsquo;s a better term?</p>
<p>But like a lot of people use hashtags on Instagram</p>
<p>to get like good SEO that doesn&rsquo;t fully represent</p>
<p>the contents of the image.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll put a picture of a cat</p>
<p>and hashtag it with like science, awesome, fun.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know all kinds, why would you put science?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not very good SEO.</p>
<p>The way my colleagues who worked on this project</p>
<p>at Facebook, now Meta AI, a few years ago dealt with this</p>
<p>is that they only selected something like 17,000 tags</p>
<p>that correspond to kind of physical things or situations,</p>
<p>like that has some visual content.</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t have like hash TBT or anything like that.</p>
<p>Oh, so they keep a very select set of hashtags</p>
<p>is what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still in the order of 10 to 20,000.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fairly large.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can you tell me about data augmentation?</p>
<p>What the heck is data augmentation and how is it used</p>
<p>maybe contrast of learning for video?</p>
<p>What are some cool ideas here?</p>
<p>Right, so data augmentation.</p>
<p>I mean, first data augmentation is the idea</p>
<p>of artificially increasing the size of your training set</p>
<p>by distorting the images that you have</p>
<p>in ways that don&rsquo;t change the nature of the image, right?</p>
<p>So you do MNIST, you can do data augmentation on MNIST</p>
<p>and people have done this since the 1990s, right?</p>
<p>You take a MNIST digit and you shift it a little bit</p>
<p>or you change the size or rotate it, skew it,</p>
<p>you know, et cetera.</p>
<p>Add noise.</p>
<p>Add noise, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it works better if you train a supervised classifier</p>
<p>with augmented data, you&rsquo;re gonna get better results.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s become really interesting</p>
<p>over the last couple of years</p>
<p>because a lot of self supervised learning techniques</p>
<p>to pre train vision systems are based on data augmentation.</p>
<p>And the basic techniques is originally inspired</p>
<p>by techniques that I worked on in the early 90s</p>
<p>and Jeff Hinton worked on also in the early 90s.</p>
<p>They were sort of parallel work.</p>
<p>I used to call this Siamese network.</p>
<p>So basically you take two identical copies</p>
<p>of the same network, they share the same weights</p>
<p>and you show two different views of the same object.</p>
<p>Either those two different views may have been obtained</p>
<p>by data augmentation</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s two different views of the same scene</p>
<p>from a camera that you moved or at different times</p>
<p>or something like that, right?</p>
<p>Or two pictures of the same person, things like that.</p>
<p>And then you train this neural net,</p>
<p>those two identical copies of this neural net</p>
<p>to produce an output representation, a vector</p>
<p>in such a way that the representation for those two images</p>
<p>are as close to each other as possible,</p>
<p>as identical to each other as possible, right?</p>
<p>Because you want the system</p>
<p>to basically learn a function that will be invariant,</p>
<p>that will not change, whose output will not change</p>
<p>when you transform those inputs in those particular ways,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s easy to do.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s complicated is how do you make sure</p>
<p>that when you show two images that are different,</p>
<p>the system will produce different things?</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t have a specific provision for this,</p>
<p>the system will just ignore the inputs when you train it,</p>
<p>it will end up ignoring the input</p>
<p>and just produce a constant vector</p>
<p>that is the same for every input, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called a collapse.</p>
<p>Now, how do you avoid collapse?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two ideas.</p>
<p>One idea that I proposed in the early 90s</p>
<p>with my colleagues at Bell Labs,</p>
<p>Jane Barmley and a couple other people,</p>
<p>which we now call contrastive learning,</p>
<p>which is to have negative examples, right?</p>
<p>So you have pairs of images that you know are different</p>
<p>and you show them to the network and those two copies,</p>
<p>and then you push the two output vectors away</p>
<p>from each other and it will eventually guarantee</p>
<p>that things that are semantically similar</p>
<p>produce similar representations</p>
<p>and things that are different</p>
<p>produce different representations.</p>
<p>We actually came up with this idea</p>
<p>for a project of doing signature verification.</p>
<p>So we would collect signatures from,</p>
<p>like multiple signatures on the same person</p>
<p>and then train a neural net to produce the same representation</p>
<p>and then force the system to produce different</p>
<p>representation for different signatures.</p>
<p>This was actually, the problem was proposed by people</p>
<p>from what was a subsidiary of AT&amp;T at the time called NCR.</p>
<p>And they were interested in storing</p>
<p>representation of the signature on the 80 bytes</p>
<p>of the magnetic strip of a credit card.</p>
<p>So we came up with this idea of having a neural net</p>
<p>with 80 outputs that we would quantize on bytes</p>
<p>so that we could encode the signature.</p>
<p>And that encoding was then used to compare</p>
<p>whether the signature matches or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So then you would sign, you would run through the neural net</p>
<p>and then you would compare the output vector</p>
<p>to whatever is stored on your card.</p>
<p>Did it actually work?</p>
<p>It worked, but they ended up not using it.</p>
<p>Because nobody cares actually.</p>
<p>I mean, the American financial payment system</p>
<p>is incredibly lax in that respect compared to Europe.</p>
<p>Oh, with the signatures?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose of signatures anyway?</p>
<p>This is very different.</p>
<p>Nobody looks at them, nobody cares.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, so that&rsquo;s contrastive learning, right?</p>
<p>So you need positive and negative pairs.</p>
<p>And the problem with that is that,</p>
<p>even though I had the original paper on this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually not very positive about it</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t work in high dimension.</p>
<p>If your representation is high dimensional,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just too many ways for two things to be different.</p>
<p>And so you would need lots and lots</p>
<p>and lots of negative pairs.</p>
<p>So there is a particular implementation of this,</p>
<p>which is relatively recent from actually</p>
<p>the Google Toronto group where, you know,</p>
<p>Jeff Hinton is the senior member there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called SIMCLR, S I M C L R.</p>
<p>And it, you know, basically a particular way</p>
<p>of implementing this idea of contrastive learning,</p>
<p>the particular objective function.</p>
<p>Now, what I&rsquo;m much more enthusiastic about these days</p>
<p>is non contrastive methods.</p>
<p>So other ways to guarantee that the representations</p>
<p>would be different for different inputs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually based on an idea that Jeff Hinton</p>
<p>proposed in the early nineties with his student</p>
<p>at the time, Sue Becker.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s based on the idea of maximizing</p>
<p>the mutual information between the outputs</p>
<p>of the two systems.</p>
<p>You only show positive pairs.</p>
<p>You only show pairs of images that you know</p>
<p>are somewhat similar.</p>
<p>And you train the two networks to be informative,</p>
<p>but also to be as informative of each other as possible.</p>
<p>So basically one representation has to be predictable</p>
<p>from the other, essentially.</p>
<p>And, you know, he proposed that idea,</p>
<p>had, you know, a couple of papers in the early nineties,</p>
<p>and then nothing was done about it for decades.</p>
<p>And I kind of revived this idea together</p>
<p>with my postdocs at FAIR,</p>
<p>particularly a postdoc called Stefan Denis,</p>
<p>who is now a junior professor in Finland</p>
<p>at University of Aalto.</p>
<p>We came up with something that we call Barlow Twins.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a particular way of maximizing</p>
<p>the information content of a vector,</p>
<p>you know, using some hypotheses.</p>
<p>And we have kind of another version of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more recent now called VICREG, V I C A R E G.</p>
<p>That means Variance, Invariance, Covariance,</p>
<p>Regularization.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m the most excited about</p>
<p>in machine learning in the last 15 years.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m really, really excited about this.</p>
<p>What kind of data augmentation is useful</p>
<p>for that noncontrastive learning method?</p>
<p>Are we talking about, does that not matter that much?</p>
<p>Or it seems like a very important part of the step.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How you generate the images that are similar,</p>
<p>but sufficiently different.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important step and it&rsquo;s also an annoying step</p>
<p>because you need to have that knowledge</p>
<p>of what data augmentation you can do</p>
<p>that do not change the nature of the object.</p>
<p>And so the standard scenario,</p>
<p>which a lot of people working in this area are using</p>
<p>is you use the type of distortion.</p>
<p>So basically you do a geometric distortion.</p>
<p>So one basically just shifts the image a little bit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called cropping.</p>
<p>Another one kind of changes the scale a little bit.</p>
<p>Another one kind of rotates it.</p>
<p>Another one changes the colors.</p>
<p>You can do a shift in color balance</p>
<p>or something like that, saturation.</p>
<p>Another one sort of blurs it.</p>
<p>Another one adds noise.</p>
<p>So you have like a catalog of kind of standard things</p>
<p>and people try to use the same ones</p>
<p>for different algorithms so that they can compare.</p>
<p>But some algorithms, some self supervised algorithm</p>
<p>actually can deal with much bigger,</p>
<p>like more aggressive data augmentation and some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So that kind of makes the whole thing difficult.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the kind of distortions we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And so you train with those distortions</p>
<p>and then you chop off the last layer, a couple layers</p>
<p>of the network and you use the representation</p>
<p>as input to a classifier.</p>
<p>You train the classifier on ImageNet, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>or whatever, and measure the performance.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, the methods that are really good</p>
<p>at eliminating the information that is irrelevant,</p>
<p>which is the distortions between those images,</p>
<p>do a good job at eliminating it.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, you cannot use the representations</p>
<p>in those systems for things like object detection</p>
<p>and localization because that information is gone.</p>
<p>So the type of data augmentation you need to do</p>
<p>depends on the tasks you want eventually the system</p>
<p>to solve and the type of data augmentation,</p>
<p>standard data augmentation that we use today</p>
<p>are only appropriate for object recognition</p>
<p>or image classification.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not appropriate for things like.</p>
<p>Can you help me out understand what wide localizations?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s just not good at the negative,</p>
<p>like at classifying the negative,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why it can&rsquo;t be used for the localization?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just that you train the system,</p>
<p>you give it an image and then you give it the same image</p>
<p>shifted and scaled and you tell it that&rsquo;s the same image.</p>
<p>So the system basically is trained</p>
<p>to eliminate the information about position and size.</p>
<p>So now you want to use that to figure out</p>
<p>where an object is and what size it is.</p>
<p>Like a bounding box, like they&rsquo;d be able to actually.</p>
<p>Okay, it can still find the object in the image,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not very good at finding</p>
<p>the exact boundaries of that object, interesting.</p>
<p>Interesting, which that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>sort of philosophical question,</p>
<p>how important is object localization anyway?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like obsessed by measuring image segmentation,</p>
<p>obsessed by measuring perfectly knowing</p>
<p>the boundaries of objects when arguably</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not that essential to understanding</p>
<p>what are the contents of the scene.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think evolutionarily,</p>
<p>the first vision systems in animals</p>
<p>were basically all about localization,</p>
<p>very little about recognition.</p>
<p>And in the human brain, you have two separate pathways</p>
<p>for recognizing the nature of a scene or an object</p>
<p>and localizing objects.</p>
<p>So you use the first pathway called eventual pathway</p>
<p>for telling what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>The other pathway, the dorsal pathway,</p>
<p>is used for navigation, for grasping, for everything else.</p>
<p>And basically a lot of the things you need for survival</p>
<p>are localization and detection.</p>
<p>Is similarity learning or contrastive learning,</p>
<p>are these non contrastive methods</p>
<p>the same as understanding something?</p>
<p>Just because you know a distorted cat</p>
<p>is the same as a non distorted cat,</p>
<p>does that mean you understand what it means to be a cat?</p>
<p>To some extent.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a superficial understanding, obviously.</p>
<p>But what is the ceiling of this method, do you think?</p>
<p>Is this just one trick on the path</p>
<p>to doing self supervised learning?</p>
<p>Can we go really, really far?</p>
<p>I think we can go really far.</p>
<p>So if we figure out how to use techniques of that type,</p>
<p>perhaps very different, but the same nature,</p>
<p>to train a system from video to do video prediction,</p>
<p>essentially, I think we&rsquo;ll have a path towards,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say unlimited, but a path towards some level</p>
<p>of physical common sense in machines.</p>
<p>And I also think that that ability to learn</p>
<p>how the world works from a sort of high throughput channel</p>
<p>like vision is a necessary step towards</p>
<p>sort of real artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>In other words, I believe in grounded intelligence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can train a machine</p>
<p>to be intelligent purely from text.</p>
<p>Because I think the amount of information about the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s contained in text is tiny compared</p>
<p>to what we need to know.</p>
<p>So for example, and people have attempted to do this</p>
<p>for 30 years, the psych project and things like that,</p>
<p>basically kind of writing down all the facts that are known</p>
<p>and hoping that some sort of common sense will emerge.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s basically hopeless.</p>
<p>But let me take an example.</p>
<p>You take an object, I describe a situation to you.</p>
<p>I take an object, I put it on the table</p>
<p>and I push the table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely obvious to you that the object</p>
<p>will be pushed with the table,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sitting on it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no text in the world, I believe, that explains this.</p>
<p>And so if you train a machine as powerful as it could be,</p>
<p>your GPT 5000 or whatever it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never gonna learn about this.</p>
<p>That information is just not present in any text.</p>
<p>Well, the question, like with the psych project,</p>
<p>the dream I think is to have like 10 million,</p>
<p>say facts like that, that give you a headstart,</p>
<p>like a parent guiding you.</p>
<p>Now, we humans don&rsquo;t need a parent to tell us</p>
<p>that the table will move, sorry,</p>
<p>the smartphone will move with the table.</p>
<p>But we get a lot of guidance in other ways.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that we can give it a quick shortcut.</p>
<p>What about a cat?</p>
<p>The cat knows that.</p>
<p>No, but they evolved, so.</p>
<p>No, they learn like us.</p>
<p>Sorry, the physics of stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, so you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re putting a lot of intelligence</p>
<p>onto the nurture side, not the nature.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We seem to have, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very inefficient arguably process of evolution</p>
<p>that got us from bacteria to who we are today.</p>
<p>Started at the bottom, now we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>So the question is how, okay,</p>
<p>the question is how fundamental is that,</p>
<p>the nature of the whole hardware?</p>
<p>And then is there any way to shortcut it</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s fundamental?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not, if it&rsquo;s most of intelligence,</p>
<p>most of the cool stuff we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>is mostly nurture, mostly trained.</p>
<p>We figure it out by observing the world.</p>
<p>We can form that big, beautiful, sexy background model</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about just by sitting there.</p>
<p>Then, okay, then you need to, then like maybe,</p>
<p>it is all supervised learning all the way down.</p>
<p>Self supervised learning, say.</p>
<p>Whatever it is that makes, you know,</p>
<p>human intelligence different from other animals,</p>
<p>which, you know, a lot of people think is language</p>
<p>and logical reasoning and this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It cannot be that complicated because it only popped up</p>
<p>in the last million years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, it only involves, you know,</p>
<p>less than 1% of our genome might be,</p>
<p>which is the difference between human genome</p>
<p>and chimps or whatever.</p>
<p>So it can&rsquo;t be that complicated.</p>
<p>You know, it can&rsquo;t be that fundamental.</p>
<p>I mean, most of the complicated stuff</p>
<p>already exists in cats and dogs and, you know,</p>
<p>certainly primates, nonhuman primates.</p>
<p>Yeah, that little thing with humans</p>
<p>might be just something about social interaction</p>
<p>and ability to maintain ideas</p>
<p>across like a collective of people.</p>
<p>It sounds very dramatic and very impressive,</p>
<p>but it probably isn&rsquo;t mechanistically speaking.</p>
<p>It is, but we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>Like, you know, we have, I mean, this is number 634,</p>
<p>you know, in the list of problems we have to solve.</p>
<p>So basic physics of the world is number one.</p>
<p>What do you, just a quick tangent on data augmentation.</p>
<p>So a lot of it is hard coded versus learned.</p>
<p>Do you have any intuition that maybe</p>
<p>there could be some weird data augmentation,</p>
<p>like generative type of data augmentation,</p>
<p>like doing something weird to images,</p>
<p>which then improves the similarity learning process?</p>
<p>So not just kind of dumb, simple distortions,</p>
<p>but by you shaking your head,</p>
<p>just saying that even simple distortions are enough.</p>
<p>I think, no, I think data augmentation</p>
<p>is a temporary necessary evil.</p>
<p>So what people are working on now is two things.</p>
<p>One is the type of self supervised learning,</p>
<p>like trying to translate the type of self supervised learning</p>
<p>people use in language, translating these two images,</p>
<p>which is basically a denoising autoencoder method, right?</p>
<p>So you take an image, you block, you mask some parts of it,</p>
<p>and then you train some giant neural net</p>
<p>to reconstruct the parts that are missing.</p>
<p>And until very recently,</p>
<p>there was no working methods for that.</p>
<p>All the autoencoder type methods for images</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t producing very good representation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a paper now coming out of the fair group</p>
<p>at MNL Park that actually works very well.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t require data augmentation,</p>
<p>that requires only masking, okay.</p>
<p>Only masking for images, okay.</p>
<p>Right, so you mask part of the image</p>
<p>and you train a system, which in this case is a transformer</p>
<p>because the transformer represents the image</p>
<p>as non overlapping patches,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s easy to mask patches and things like that.</p>
<p>Okay, but then my question transfers to that problem,</p>
<p>the masking, like why should the mask be square or rectangle?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter, like, you know,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna come up probably in the future</p>
<p>with sort of ways to mask that are kind of random,</p>
<p>essentially, I mean, they are random already, but.</p>
<p>No, no, but like something that&rsquo;s challenging,</p>
<p>like optimally challenging.</p>
<p>So like, I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s a metaphor that doesn&rsquo;t apply,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re, it seems like there&rsquo;s a data augmentation</p>
<p>or masking, there&rsquo;s an interactive element with it.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re almost like playing with an image.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s like the way we play with an image</p>
<p>in our minds.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s like dropout.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Boston machine training.</p>
<p>You, you know, every time you see a percept,</p>
<p>you also, you can perturb it in some way.</p>
<p>And then the principle of the training procedure</p>
<p>is to minimize the difference of the output</p>
<p>or the representation between the clean version</p>
<p>and the corrupted version, essentially, right?</p>
<p>And you can do this in real time, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, Boston machine work like this, right?</p>
<p>You show a percept, you tell the machine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good combination of activities</p>
<p>or your input neurons.</p>
<p>And then you either let them go their merry way</p>
<p>without clamping them to values,</p>
<p>or you only do this with a subset.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re training the system</p>
<p>so that the stable state of the entire network</p>
<p>is the same regardless of whether it sees</p>
<p>the entire input or whether it sees only part of it.</p>
<p>You know, denoising autoencoder method</p>
<p>is basically the same thing, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re training a system to reproduce the input,</p>
<p>the complete inputs and filling the input</p>
<p>and filling the blanks, regardless of which parts</p>
<p>are missing, and that&rsquo;s really the underlying principle.</p>
<p>And you could imagine sort of, even in the brain,</p>
<p>some sort of neural principle where, you know,</p>
<p>neurons kind of oscillate, right?</p>
<p>So they take their activity and then temporarily</p>
<p>they kind of shut off to, you know,</p>
<p>force the rest of the system to basically reconstruct</p>
<p>the input without their help, you know?</p>
<p>And, I mean, you could imagine, you know,</p>
<p>more or less biologically possible processes.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>And I guess with this denoising autoencoder</p>
<p>and masking and data augmentation,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to worry about being super efficient.</p>
<p>You could just do as much as you want</p>
<p>and get better over time.</p>
<p>Because I was thinking, like, you might want to be clever</p>
<p>about the way you do all these procedures, you know,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s only, it&rsquo;s somehow costly to do every iteration,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>And then there is, you know,</p>
<p>data augmentation without explicit data augmentation.</p>
<p>This data augmentation by weighting,</p>
<p>which is, you know, the sort of video prediction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re observing a video clip,</p>
<p>observing the, you know, the continuation of that video clip.</p>
<p>You try to learn a representation</p>
<p>using dual joint embedding architectures</p>
<p>in such a way that the representation of the future clip</p>
<p>is easily predictable from the representation</p>
<p>of the observed clip.</p>
<p>Do you think YouTube has enough raw data</p>
<p>from which to learn how to be a cat?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>So the amount of data is not the constraint.</p>
<p>No, it would require some selection, I think.</p>
<p>Some selection?</p>
<p>Some selection of, you know, maybe the right type of data.</p>
<p>You need some.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go down the rabbit hole of just cat videos.</p>
<p>You might need to watch some lectures or something.</p>
<p>No, you wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>How meta would that be</p>
<p>if it like watches lectures about intelligence</p>
<p>and then learns,</p>
<p>watches your lectures in NYU</p>
<p>and learns from that how to be intelligent?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that would be enough.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your, do you find multimodal learning interesting?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about visual language,</p>
<p>like combining those together,</p>
<p>maybe audio, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that I find interesting</p>
<p>in the short term,</p>
<p>but are not addressing the important problem</p>
<p>that I think are really kind of the big challenges.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, things like multitask learning,</p>
<p>continual learning, you know, adversarial issues.</p>
<p>I mean, those have great practical interests</p>
<p>in the relatively short term, possibly,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re fundamental.</p>
<p>You know, active learning,</p>
<p>even to some extent, reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>I think those things will become either obsolete</p>
<p>or useless or easy</p>
<p>once we figured out how to do self supervised</p>
<p>representation learning</p>
<p>or learning predictive world models.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s what, you know,</p>
<p>the entire community should be focusing on.</p>
<p>At least people who are interested</p>
<p>in sort of fundamental questions</p>
<p>or, you know, really kind of pushing the envelope</p>
<p>of AI towards the next stage.</p>
<p>But of course, there&rsquo;s like a huge amount of,</p>
<p>you know, very interesting work to do</p>
<p>in sort of practical questions</p>
<p>that have, you know, short term impact.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it&rsquo;s difficult to talk about</p>
<p>the temporal scale,</p>
<p>because all of human civilization</p>
<p>will eventually be destroyed</p>
<p>because the sun will die out.</p>
<p>And even if Elon Musk is successful</p>
<p>in multi planetary colonization across the galaxy,</p>
<p>eventually the entirety of it</p>
<p>will just become giant black holes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna take a while though.</p>
<p>So, but what I&rsquo;m saying is then that logic</p>
<p>can be used to say it&rsquo;s all meaningless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying all that to say that multitask learning</p>
<p>might be, you&rsquo;re calling it practical</p>
<p>or pragmatic or whatever.</p>
<p>That might be the thing that achieves something</p>
<p>very akin to intelligence</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re trying to solve the more general problem</p>
<p>of self supervised learning of background knowledge.</p>
<p>So the reason I bring that up,</p>
<p>maybe one way to ask that question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very impressed</p>
<p>by what Tesla Autopilot team is doing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to glance</p>
<p>at this particular one example of multitask learning,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re literally taking the problem,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, Charles Darwin studying animals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re studying the problem of driving</p>
<p>and asking, okay, what are all the things</p>
<p>you have to perceive?</p>
<p>And the way they&rsquo;re solving it is one,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an ontology where you&rsquo;re bringing that to the table.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re formulating a bunch of different tasks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like over a hundred tasks or something like that</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re involved in driving.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re deploying it</p>
<p>and then getting data back from people that run into trouble</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to figure out, do we add tasks?</p>
<p>Do we, like, we focus on each individual task separately?</p>
<p>In fact, I would say,</p>
<p>I would classify Andre Karpathy&rsquo;s talk in two ways.</p>
<p>So one was about doors</p>
<p>and the other one about how much ImageNet sucks.</p>
<p>He kept going back and forth on those two topics,</p>
<p>which ImageNet sucks,</p>
<p>meaning you can&rsquo;t just use a single benchmark.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so, like, you have to have like a giant suite</p>
<p>of benchmarks to understand how well your system actually works.</p>
<p>Oh, I agree with him.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a very sensible guy.</p>
<p>Now, okay, it&rsquo;s very clear that if you&rsquo;re faced</p>
<p>with an engineering problem that you need to solve</p>
<p>in a relatively short time,</p>
<p>particularly if you have Elon Musk breathing down your neck,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to take shortcuts, right?</p>
<p>You might think about the fact that the right thing to do</p>
<p>and the longterm solution involves, you know,</p>
<p>some fancy self supervised running,</p>
<p>but you have, you know, Elon Musk breathing down your neck</p>
<p>and, you know, this involves, you know, human lives.</p>
<p>And so you have to basically just do</p>
<p>the systematic engineering and, you know,</p>
<p>fine tuning and refinements</p>
<p>and trial and error and all that stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called engineering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called, you know, putting technology out in the world.</p>
<p>And you have to kind of ironclad it before you do this,</p>
<p>you know, so much for, you know,</p>
<p>grand ideas and principles.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;m placing myself sort of, you know,</p>
<p>some, you know, upstream of this, you know,</p>
<p>quite a bit upstream of this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a Plato, think about platonic forms.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not platonic because eventually</p>
<p>I want that stuff to get used,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s okay if it takes five or 10 years</p>
<p>for the community to realize this is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been the case before that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made that case.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look back in the mid 2000, for example,</p>
<p>and you ask yourself the question, okay,</p>
<p>I want to recognize cars or faces or whatever,</p>
<p>you know, I can use convolutional net.</p>
<p>So I can use sort of more conventional</p>
<p>kind of computer vision techniques, you know,</p>
<p>using interest point detectors or assist density features</p>
<p>and, you know, sticking an SVM on top.</p>
<p>At that time, the datasets were so small</p>
<p>that those methods that use more hand engineering</p>
<p>worked better than ConvNets.</p>
<p>It was just not enough data for ConvNets</p>
<p>and ConvNets were a little slow with the kind of hardware</p>
<p>that was available at the time.</p>
<p>And there was a sea change when, basically,</p>
<p>when, you know, datasets became bigger</p>
<p>and GPUs became available.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, you know, two of the main factors</p>
<p>that basically made people change their mind.</p>
<p>And you can look at the history of,</p>
<p>like, all sub branches of AI or pattern recognition.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a similar trajectory followed by techniques</p>
<p>where people start by, you know, engineering the hell out of it.</p>
<p>You know, be it optical character recognition,</p>
<p>speech recognition, computer vision,</p>
<p>like image recognition in general,</p>
<p>natural language understanding, like, you know, translation,</p>
<p>things like that, right?</p>
<p>You start to engineer the hell out of it.</p>
<p>You start to acquire all the knowledge,</p>
<p>the prior knowledge you know about image formation,</p>
<p>about, you know, the shape of characters,</p>
<p>about, you know, morphological operations,</p>
<p>about, like, feature extraction, Fourier transforms,</p>
<p>you know, vernicke moments, you know, whatever, right?</p>
<p>People have come up with thousands of ways</p>
<p>of representing images</p>
<p>so that they could be easily classified afterwards.</p>
<p>Same for speech recognition, right?</p>
<p>There is, you know, it took decades</p>
<p>for people to figure out a good front end</p>
<p>to preprocess speech signals</p>
<p>so that, you know, all the information</p>
<p>about what is being said is preserved,</p>
<p>but most of the information</p>
<p>about the identity of the speaker is gone.</p>
<p>You know, kestrel coefficients or whatever, right?</p>
<p>And same for text, right?</p>
<p>You do named entity recognition and you parse</p>
<p>and you do tagging of the parts of speech</p>
<p>and, you know, you do this sort of tree representation</p>
<p>of clauses and all that stuff, right?</p>
<p>Before you can do anything.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how it starts, right?</p>
<p>Just engineer the hell out of it.</p>
<p>And then you start having data</p>
<p>and maybe you have more powerful computers.</p>
<p>Maybe you know something about statistical learning.</p>
<p>So you start using machine learning</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s usually a small sliver</p>
<p>on top of your kind of handcrafted system</p>
<p>where, you know, you extract features by hand.</p>
<p>Okay, and now, you know, nowadays the standard way</p>
<p>of doing this is that you train the entire thing end to end</p>
<p>with a deep learning system and it learns its own features</p>
<p>and, you know, speech recognition systems nowadays</p>
<p>or CR systems are completely end to end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s some giant neural net</p>
<p>that takes raw waveforms</p>
<p>and produces a sequence of characters coming out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a huge neural net, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, you know, Markov model,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no language model that is explicit</p>
<p>other than, you know, something that&rsquo;s ingrained</p>
<p>in the sort of neural language model, if you want.</p>
<p>Same for translation, same for all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>So you see this continuous evolution</p>
<p>from, you know, less and less hand crafting</p>
<p>and more and more learning.</p>
<p>And I think, I mean, it&rsquo;s true in biology as well.</p>
<p>So, I mean, we might disagree about this,</p>
<p>maybe not, this one little piece at the end,</p>
<p>you mentioned active learning.</p>
<p>It feels like active learning,</p>
<p>which is the selection of data</p>
<p>and also the interactivity needs to be part</p>
<p>of this giant neural network.</p>
<p>You cannot just be an observer</p>
<p>to do self supervised learning.</p>
<p>You have to, well, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>self supervised learning is just a word,</p>
<p>but I would, whatever this giant stack</p>
<p>of a neural network that&rsquo;s automatically learning,</p>
<p>it feels, my intuition is that you have to have a system,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a physical robot or a digital robot,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interacting with the world</p>
<p>and doing so in a flawed way and improving over time</p>
<p>in order to form the self supervised learning.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t just give it a giant sea of data.</p>
<p>Okay, I agree and I disagree.</p>
<p>I agree in the sense that I think, I agree in two ways.</p>
<p>The first way I agree is that if you want,</p>
<p>and you certainly need a causal model of the world</p>
<p>that allows you to predict the consequences</p>
<p>of your actions, to train that model,</p>
<p>you need to take actions, right?</p>
<p>You need to be able to act in a world</p>
<p>and see the effect for you to be,</p>
<p>to learn causal models of the world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not obvious because you can observe others.</p>
<p>You can observe others.</p>
<p>And you can infer that they&rsquo;re similar to you</p>
<p>and then you can learn from that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then you have to kind of hardwire that part,</p>
<p>right, and then, you know, mirror neurons</p>
<p>and all that stuff, right?</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s not clear to me</p>
<p>how you would do this in a machine.</p>
<p>So I think the action part would be necessary</p>
<p>for having causal models of the world.</p>
<p>The second reason it may be necessary,</p>
<p>or at least more efficient,</p>
<p>is that active learning basically, you know,</p>
<p>goes for the jugular of what you don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>Is, you know, obvious areas of uncertainty</p>
<p>about your world and about how the world behaves.</p>
<p>And you can resolve this uncertainty</p>
<p>by systematic exploration of that part</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And if you know that you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>then, you know, it makes you curious.</p>
<p>You kind of look into situations that,</p>
<p>and, you know, across the animal world,</p>
<p>different species have different levels of curiosity,</p>
<p>right, depending on how they&rsquo;re built, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, cats and rats are incredibly curious,</p>
<p>dogs not so much, I mean, less.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it could be useful</p>
<p>to have that kind of curiosity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be useful,</p>
<p>but curiosity just makes the process faster.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make the process exist.</p>
<p>The, so what process, what learning process is it</p>
<p>that active learning makes more efficient?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m asking that first question, you know,</p>
<p>you know, we haven&rsquo;t answered that question yet.</p>
<p>So, you know, I worry about active learning</p>
<p>once this question is&hellip;</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the more fundamental question to ask.</p>
<p>And if active learning or interaction</p>
<p>increases the efficiency of the learning,</p>
<p>see, sometimes it becomes very different</p>
<p>if the increase is several orders of magnitude, right?</p>
<p>Like&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But fundamentally it&rsquo;s still the same thing</p>
<p>and building up the intuition about how to,</p>
<p>in a self supervised way to construct background models,</p>
<p>efficient or inefficient, is the core problem.</p>
<p>What do you think about Yoshua Bengio&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talking about consciousness</p>
<p>and all of these kinds of concepts?</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t know what consciousness is, but&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good opener.</p>
<p>And to some extent, a lot of the things</p>
<p>that are said about consciousness</p>
<p>remind me of the questions people were asking themselves</p>
<p>in the 18th century or 17th century</p>
<p>when they discovered that, you know, how the eye works</p>
<p>and the fact that the image at the back of the eye</p>
<p>was upside down, right?</p>
<p>Because you have a lens.</p>
<p>And so on your retina, the image that forms is an image</p>
<p>of the world, but it&rsquo;s upside down.</p>
<p>How is it that you see right side up?</p>
<p>And, you know, with what we know today in science,</p>
<p>you know, we realize this question doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>or is kind of ridiculous in some way, right?</p>
<p>So I think a lot of what is said about consciousness</p>
<p>is of that nature.</p>
<p>Now, that said, there is a lot of really smart people</p>
<p>that for whom I have a lot of respect</p>
<p>who are talking about this topic,</p>
<p>people like David Chalmers, who is a colleague of mine at NYU.</p>
<p>I have kind of an orthodox folk speculative hypothesis</p>
<p>about consciousness.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about the study of a world model.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, our entire prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>basically is the engine for a world model.</p>
<p>But when we are attending at a particular situation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re focused on that situation.</p>
<p>We basically cannot attend to anything else.</p>
<p>And that seems to suggest that we basically have</p>
<p>only one world model engine in our prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>That engine is configurable to the situation at hand.</p>
<p>So we are building a box out of wood,</p>
<p>or we are driving down the highway playing chess.</p>
<p>We basically have a single model of the world</p>
<p>that we configure into the situation at hand,</p>
<p>which is why we can only attend to one task at a time.</p>
<p>Now, if there is a task that we do repeatedly,</p>
<p>it goes from the sort of deliberate reasoning</p>
<p>using model of the world and prediction</p>
<p>and perhaps something like model predictive control,</p>
<p>which I was talking about earlier,</p>
<p>to something that is more subconscious</p>
<p>that becomes automatic.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever played</p>
<p>against a chess grandmaster.</p>
<p>I get wiped out in 10 plays, right?</p>
<p>And I have to think about my move for like 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And the person in front of me, the grandmaster,</p>
<p>would just react within seconds, right?</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t need to think about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s become part of the subconscious</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s basically just pattern recognition</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>Same, the first few hours you drive a car,</p>
<p>you are really attentive, you can&rsquo;t do anything else.</p>
<p>And then after 20, 30 hours of practice, 50 hours,</p>
<p>the subconscious, you can talk to the person next to you,</p>
<p>things like that, right?</p>
<p>Unless the situation becomes unpredictable</p>
<p>and then you have to stop talking.</p>
<p>So that suggests you only have one model in your head.</p>
<p>And it might suggest the idea that consciousness</p>
<p>basically is the module that configures</p>
<p>this world model of yours.</p>
<p>You need to have some sort of executive kind of overseer</p>
<p>that configures your world model for the situation at hand.</p>
<p>And that leads to kind of the really curious concept</p>
<p>that consciousness is not a consequence</p>
<p>of the power of our minds,</p>
<p>but of the limitation of our brains.</p>
<p>That because we have only one world model,</p>
<p>we have to be conscious.</p>
<p>If we had as many world models</p>
<p>as situations we encounter,</p>
<p>then we could do all of them simultaneously</p>
<p>and we wouldn&rsquo;t need this sort of executive control</p>
<p>that we call consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>And somehow maybe that executive controller,</p>
<p>I mean, the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some kind of chemicals in biology</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creating a feeling,</p>
<p>like it feels to experience some of these things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like the hard question is,</p>
<p>what the heck is that and why is that useful?</p>
<p>Maybe the more pragmatic question,</p>
<p>why is it useful to feel like this is really you</p>
<p>experiencing this versus just like information</p>
<p>being processed?</p>
<p>It could be just a very nice side effect</p>
<p>of the way we evolved.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just very useful to feel a sense of ownership</p>
<p>to the decisions you make, to the perceptions you make,</p>
<p>to the model you&rsquo;re trying to maintain.</p>
<p>Like you own this thing and this is the only one you got</p>
<p>and if you lose it, it&rsquo;s gonna really suck.</p>
<p>And so you should really send the brain</p>
<p>some signals about it.</p>
<p>So what ideas do you believe might be true</p>
<p>that most or at least many people disagree with?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say in the space of machine learning.</p>
<p>Well, it depends who you talk about,</p>
<p>but I think, so certainly there is a bunch of people</p>
<p>who are nativists, right?</p>
<p>Who think that a lot of the basic things about the world</p>
<p>are kind of hardwired in our minds.</p>
<p>Things like the world is three dimensional, for example,</p>
<p>is that hardwired?</p>
<p>Things like object permanence,</p>
<p>is this something that we learn</p>
<p>before the age of three months or so?</p>
<p>Or are we born with it?</p>
<p>And there are very wide disagreements</p>
<p>among the cognitive scientists for this.</p>
<p>I think those things are actually very simple to learn.</p>
<p>Is it the case that the oriented edge detectors in V1</p>
<p>are learned or are they hardwired?</p>
<p>I think they are learned.</p>
<p>They might be learned before both</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really easy to generate signals</p>
<p>from the retina that actually will train edge detectors.</p>
<p>And again, those are things that can be learned</p>
<p>within minutes of opening your eyes, right?</p>
<p>I mean, since the 1990s,</p>
<p>we have algorithms that can learn oriented edge detectors</p>
<p>completely unsupervised</p>
<p>with the equivalent of a few minutes of real time.</p>
<p>So those things have to be learned.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also those MIT experiments</p>
<p>where you kind of plug the optical nerve</p>
<p>on the auditory cortex of a baby ferret, right?</p>
<p>And that auditory cortex</p>
<p>becomes a visual cortex essentially.</p>
<p>So clearly there&rsquo;s learning taking place there.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of what people think are so basic</p>
<p>that they need to be hardwired,</p>
<p>I think a lot of those things are learned</p>
<p>because they are easy to learn.</p>
<p>So you put a lot of value in the power of learning.</p>
<p>What kind of things do you suspect might not be learned?</p>
<p>Is there something that could not be learned?</p>
<p>So your intrinsic drives are not learned.</p>
<p>There are the things that make humans human</p>
<p>or make cats different from dogs, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the basic drives that are kind of hardwired</p>
<p>in our basal ganglia.</p>
<p>I mean, there are people who are working</p>
<p>on this kind of stuff that&rsquo;s called intrinsic motivation</p>
<p>in the context of reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>So these are objective functions</p>
<p>where the reward doesn&rsquo;t come from the external world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s computed by your own brain.</p>
<p>Your own brain computes whether you&rsquo;re happy or not, right?</p>
<p>It measures your degree of comfort or in comfort.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s your brain computing this,</p>
<p>presumably it knows also how to estimate</p>
<p>gradients of this, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier to learn when your objective is intrinsic.</p>
<p>So that has to be hardwired.</p>
<p>The critic that makes longterm prediction of the outcome,</p>
<p>which is the eventual result of this, that&rsquo;s learned.</p>
<p>And perception is learned</p>
<p>and your model of the world is learned.</p>
<p>But let me take an example of why the critic,</p>
<p>I mean, an example of how the critic may be learned, right?</p>
<p>If I come to you, I reach across the table</p>
<p>and I pinch your arm, right?</p>
<p>Complete surprise for you.</p>
<p>You would not have expected this from me.</p>
<p>I was expecting that the whole time, but yes, right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say for the sake of the story, yes.</p>
<p>So, okay, your basal ganglia is gonna light up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna hurt, right?</p>
<p>And now your model of the world includes the fact that</p>
<p>I may pinch you if I approach my&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t trust humans.</p>
<p>Right, my hand to your arm.</p>
<p>So if I try again, you&rsquo;re gonna recoil.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s your critic, your predictive,</p>
<p>your predictor of your ultimate pain system</p>
<p>that predicts that something bad is gonna happen</p>
<p>and you recoil to avoid it.</p>
<p>So even that can be learned.</p>
<p>That is learned, definitely.</p>
<p>This is what allows you also to define some goals, right?</p>
<p>So the fact that you&rsquo;re a school child,</p>
<p>you wake up in the morning and you go to school</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not because you necessarily like waking up early</p>
<p>and going to school,</p>
<p>but you know that there is a long term objective</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to optimize.</p>
<p>So Ernest Becker, I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with him,</p>
<p>the philosopher, he wrote the book Denial of Death</p>
<p>and his idea is that one of the core motivations</p>
<p>of human beings is our terror of death, our fear of death.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes us unique from cats.</p>
<p>Cats are just surviving.</p>
<p>They do not have a deep, like a cognizance introspection</p>
<p>that over the horizon is the end.</p>
<p>And then he says that, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a terror management theory</p>
<p>that just all these psychological experiments</p>
<p>that show basically this idea</p>
<p>that all of human civilization, everything we create</p>
<p>is kind of trying to forget if even for a brief moment</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>When do you think humans understand</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to die?</p>
<p>Is it learned early on also?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know at what point.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a question like at what point</p>
<p>do you realize that what death really is?</p>
<p>And I think most people don&rsquo;t actually realize</p>
<p>what death is, right?</p>
<p>I mean, most people believe that you go to heaven</p>
<p>or something, right?</p>
<p>So to push back on that, what Ernest Becker says</p>
<p>and Sheldon Solomon, all of those folks,</p>
<p>and I find those ideas a little bit compelling</p>
<p>is that there is moments in life, early in life,</p>
<p>a lot of this fun happens early in life</p>
<p>when you do deeply experience</p>
<p>the terror of this realization.</p>
<p>And all the things you think about about religion,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that we kind of think about</p>
<p>more like teenage years and later,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about way earlier.</p>
<p>No, it was like seven or eight years,</p>
<p>something like that, yeah.</p>
<p>You realize, holy crap, this is like the mystery,</p>
<p>the terror, like it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re a little prey,</p>
<p>a little baby deer sitting in the darkness</p>
<p>of the jungle or the woods looking all around you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s darkness full of terror.</p>
<p>I mean, that realization says, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go back in the comfort of my mind</p>
<p>where there is a deep meaning,</p>
<p>where there is maybe like pretend I&rsquo;m immortal</p>
<p>in however way, however kind of idea I can construct</p>
<p>to help me understand that I&rsquo;m immortal.</p>
<p>Religion helps with that.</p>
<p>You can delude yourself in all kinds of ways,</p>
<p>like lose yourself in the busyness of each day,</p>
<p>have little goals in mind, all those kinds of things</p>
<p>to think that it&rsquo;s gonna go on forever.</p>
<p>And you kind of know you&rsquo;re gonna die, yeah,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be sad, but you don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s their idea.</p>
<p>And I find that compelling because it does seem</p>
<p>to be a core unique aspect of human nature</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re able to think that we&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to really understand that this life is finite.</p>
<p>That seems important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different things there.</p>
<p>So first of all, I don&rsquo;t think there is a qualitative</p>
<p>difference between us and cats in the term.</p>
<p>I think the difference is that we just have a better</p>
<p>long term ability to predict in the long term.</p>
<p>And so we have a better understanding of how the world works.</p>
<p>So we have better understanding of finiteness of life</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So we have a better planning engine than cats?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the motivation for planning that far?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s just a side effect of the fact</p>
<p>that we have just a better planning engine</p>
<p>because it makes us, as I said,</p>
<p>the essence of intelligence is the ability to predict.</p>
<p>And so the, because we&rsquo;re smarter as a side effect,</p>
<p>we also have this ability to kind of make predictions</p>
<p>about our own future existence or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You say religion helps with that.</p>
<p>I think religion hurts actually.</p>
<p>It makes people worry about like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen after their death, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you believe that, you just don&rsquo;t exist after death.</p>
<p>Like, it solves completely the problem, at least.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying if you don&rsquo;t believe in God,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t worry about what happens after death?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You only worry about this life</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only one you have.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If I were to say what Ernest Becker says,</p>
<p>and obviously I agree with him more than not,</p>
<p>is you do deeply worry.</p>
<p>If you believe there&rsquo;s no God,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a deep worry of the mystery of it all.</p>
<p>Like, how does that make any sense that it just ends?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can truly understand that this ride,</p>
<p>I mean, so much of our life, the consciousness,</p>
<p>the ego is invested in this being.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>Science keeps bringing humanity down from its pedestal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just another example of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wonderful, but for us individual humans,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t like to be brought down from a pedestal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying like, but see, you&rsquo;re fine with it because,</p>
<p>well, so what Ernest Becker would say is you&rsquo;re fine with it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just a more peaceful existence for you,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not really fine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hiding from it.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the people that experience</p>
<p>the deepest trauma earlier in life,</p>
<p>they often, before they seek extensive therapy,</p>
<p>will say that I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you talk to people who are truly angry,</p>
<p>how are you doing, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>The question is, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Now I had a near death experience.</p>
<p>I had a very bad motorbike accident when I was 17.</p>
<p>So, but that didn&rsquo;t have any impact</p>
<p>on my reflection on that topic.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m basically just playing a bit of devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>pushing back on wondering,</p>
<p>is it truly possible to accept death?</p>
<p>And the flip side, that&rsquo;s more interesting,</p>
<p>I think for AI and robotics is how important</p>
<p>is it to have this as one of the suite of motivations</p>
<p>is to not just avoid falling off the roof</p>
<p>or something like that, but ponder the end of the ride.</p>
<p>If you listen to the stoics, it&rsquo;s a great motivator.</p>
<p>It adds a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>So maybe to truly fear death or be cognizant of it</p>
<p>might give a deeper meaning and urgency to the moment</p>
<p>to live fully.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t disagree with that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think what motivates me here</p>
<p>is knowing more about human nature.</p>
<p>I mean, I think human nature and human intelligence</p>
<p>is a big mystery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scientific mystery</p>
<p>in addition to philosophical and et cetera,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a true believer in science.</p>
<p>So, and I do have kind of a belief</p>
<p>that for complex systems like the brain and the mind,</p>
<p>the way to understand it is to try to reproduce it</p>
<p>with artifacts that you build</p>
<p>because you know what&rsquo;s essential to it</p>
<p>when you try to build it.</p>
<p>The same way I&rsquo;ve used this analogy before with you,</p>
<p>I believe, the same way we only started</p>
<p>to understand aerodynamics</p>
<p>when we started building airplanes</p>
<p>and that helped us understand how birds fly.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s kind of a similar process here</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t have a full theory of intelligence,</p>
<p>but building intelligent artifacts</p>
<p>will help us perhaps develop some underlying theory</p>
<p>that encompasses not just artificial implements,</p>
<p>but also human and biological intelligence in general.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re an interesting person to ask this question</p>
<p>about sort of all kinds of different other</p>
<p>intelligent entities or intelligences.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about kind of like the touring</p>
<p>or the Chinese room question?</p>
<p>If we create an AI system that exhibits</p>
<p>a lot of properties of intelligence and consciousness,</p>
<p>how comfortable are you thinking of that entity</p>
<p>as intelligent or conscious?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to build now systems</p>
<p>that have intelligence and there&rsquo;s metrics</p>
<p>about their performance, but that metric is external.</p>
<p>So how are you, are you okay calling a thing intelligent</p>
<p>or are you going to be like most humans</p>
<p>and be once again unhappy to be brought down</p>
<p>from a pedestal of consciousness slash intelligence?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ll be very happy to understand</p>
<p>more about human nature, human mind and human intelligence</p>
<p>through the construction of machines</p>
<p>that have similar abilities.</p>
<p>And if a consequence of this is to bring down humanity</p>
<p>one notch down from its already low pedestal,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just fine with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the reality of life.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p>
<p>Now you were asking me about things that,</p>
<p>opinions I have that a lot of people may disagree with.</p>
<p>I think if we think about the design</p>
<p>of autonomous intelligence systems,</p>
<p>so assuming that we are somewhat successful</p>
<p>at some level of getting machines to learn models</p>
<p>of the world, predictive models of the world,</p>
<p>we build intrinsic motivation objective functions</p>
<p>to drive the behavior of that system.</p>
<p>The system also has perception modules</p>
<p>that allows it to estimate the state of the world</p>
<p>and then have some way of figuring out</p>
<p>the sequence of actions that,</p>
<p>to optimize a particular objective.</p>
<p>If it has a critic of the type that I was describing before,</p>
<p>the thing that makes you recoil your arm</p>
<p>the second time I try to pinch you,</p>
<p>intelligent autonomous machine will have emotions.</p>
<p>I think emotions are an integral part</p>
<p>of autonomous intelligence.</p>
<p>If you have an intelligent system</p>
<p>that is driven by intrinsic motivation, by objectives,</p>
<p>if it has a critic that allows it to predict in advance</p>
<p>whether the outcome of a situation is gonna be good or bad,</p>
<p>is going to have emotions, it&rsquo;s gonna have fear.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When it predicts that the outcome is gonna be bad</p>
<p>and something to avoid is gonna have elation</p>
<p>when it predicts it&rsquo;s gonna be good.</p>
<p>If it has drives to relate with humans,</p>
<p>in some ways the way humans have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be social, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s gonna have emotions</p>
<p>about attachment and things of that type.</p>
<p>So I think the sort of sci fi thing</p>
<p>where you see commander data,</p>
<p>like having an emotion chip that you can turn off, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>So, I mean, here&rsquo;s the difficult</p>
<p>philosophical social question.</p>
<p>Do you think there will be a time like a civil rights</p>
<p>movement for robots where, okay, forget the movement,</p>
<p>but a discussion like the Supreme Court</p>
<p>that particular kinds of robots,</p>
<p>you know, particular kinds of systems</p>
<p>deserve the same rights as humans</p>
<p>because they can suffer just as humans can,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps, perhaps not.</p>
<p>Like imagine that humans were,</p>
<p>that you could, you know, die and be restored.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you could be sort of, you know,</p>
<p>be 3D reprinted and, you know,</p>
<p>your brain could be reconstructed in its finest details.</p>
<p>Our ideas of rights will change in that case.</p>
<p>If you can always just,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a backup you could always restore.</p>
<p>Maybe like the importance of murder</p>
<p>will go down one notch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But also your desire to do dangerous things,</p>
<p>like, you know, skydiving or, you know,</p>
<p>or, you know, race car driving,</p>
<p>you know, car racing or that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>you know, would probably increase</p>
<p>or, you know, aeroplanes, aerobatics</p>
<p>or that kind of stuff, right?</p>
<p>It would be fine to do a lot of those things</p>
<p>or explore, you know, dangerous areas and things like that.</p>
<p>It would kind of change your relationship.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s very likely that robots would be like that</p>
<p>because, you know, they&rsquo;ll be based on perhaps technology</p>
<p>that is somewhat similar to today&rsquo;s technology</p>
<p>and you can always have a backup.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible, I don&rsquo;t know if you like video games,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a game called Diablo and&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, my sons are huge fans of this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In fact, they made a game that&rsquo;s inspired by it.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Like built a game?</p>
<p>My three sons have a game design studio between them, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>They came out with a game.</p>
<p>They just came out with a game.</p>
<p>Last year, no, this was last year,</p>
<p>early last year, about a year ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>But so in Diablo, there&rsquo;s something called hardcore mode,</p>
<p>which if you die, there&rsquo;s no, you&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s possible with AI systems</p>
<p>for them to be able to operate successfully</p>
<p>and for us to treat them in a certain way</p>
<p>because they have to be integrated in human society,</p>
<p>they have to be able to die, no copies allowed.</p>
<p>In fact, copying is illegal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible with humans as well,</p>
<p>like cloning will be illegal, even when it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>But cloning is not copying, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t reproduce the mind of the person</p>
<p>and the experience.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a delayed twin, so.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s, but we were talking about with computers</p>
<p>that you will be able to copy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You will be able to perfectly save,</p>
<p>pickle the mind state.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that that will be illegal</p>
<p>because that goes against,</p>
<p>that will destroy the motivation of the system.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s say you have a domestic robot, okay?</p>
<p>Sometime in the future.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the domestic robot comes to you kind of</p>
<p>somewhat pre trained, it can do a bunch of things,</p>
<p>but it has a particular personality</p>
<p>that makes it slightly different from the other robots</p>
<p>because that makes them more interesting.</p>
<p>And then because it&rsquo;s lived with you for five years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve grown some attachment to it and vice versa,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s learned a lot about you.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s not a real household robot.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a virtual assistant that lives in your,</p>
<p>you know, augmented reality glasses or whatever, right?</p>
<p>You know, the horror movie type thing, right?</p>
<p>And that system to some extent,</p>
<p>the intelligence in that system is a bit like your child</p>
<p>or maybe your PhD student in the sense that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of you in that machine now, right?</p>
<p>And so if it were a living thing,</p>
<p>you would do this for free if you want, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s your child, your child can, you know,</p>
<p>then live his or her own life.</p>
<p>And you know, the fact that they learn stuff from you</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have any ownership of it, right?</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s a robot that you&rsquo;ve trained,</p>
<p>perhaps you have some intellectual property claim</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>Oh, intellectual property.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you meant like a permanence value</p>
<p>in the sense that part of you is in.</p>
<p>Well, there is permanence value, right?</p>
<p>So you would lose a lot if that robot were to be destroyed</p>
<p>and you had no backup, you would lose a lot, right?</p>
<p>You lose a lot of investment, you know,</p>
<p>kind of like, you know, a person dying, you know,</p>
<p>that a friend of yours dying</p>
<p>or a coworker or something like that.</p>
<p>But also you have like intellectual property rights</p>
<p>in the sense that that system is fine tuned</p>
<p>to your particular existence.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s now a very unique instantiation</p>
<p>of that original background model,</p>
<p>whatever it was that arrived.</p>
<p>And then there are issues of privacy, right?</p>
<p>Because now imagine that that robot has its own kind</p>
<p>of volition and decides to work for someone else.</p>
<p>Or kind of, you know, thinks life with you</p>
<p>is sort of untenable or whatever.</p>
<p>Now, all the things that that system learned from you,</p>
<p>you know, can you like, you know,</p>
<p>delete all the personal information</p>
<p>that that system knows about you?</p>
<p>I mean, that would be kind of an ethical question.</p>
<p>Like, you know, can you erase the mind</p>
<p>of a intelligent robot to protect your privacy?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do this with humans.</p>
<p>You can ask them to shut up,</p>
<p>but that you don&rsquo;t have complete power over them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t erase humans, yeah, it&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>with the relationships, you know, if you break up,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t erase the other human.</p>
<p>With robots, I think it will have to be the same thing</p>
<p>with robots, that risk, that there has to be some risk</p>
<p>to our interactions to truly experience them deeply,</p>
<p>it feels like.</p>
<p>So you have to be able to lose your robot friend</p>
<p>and that robot friend to go tweeting</p>
<p>about how much of an asshole you were.</p>
<p>But then are you allowed to, you know,</p>
<p>murder the robot to protect your private information</p>
<p>if the robot decides to leave?</p>
<p>I have this intuition that for robots with certain,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s almost like a regulation.</p>
<p>If you declare your robot to be,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it sentient or something like that,</p>
<p>like this robot is designed for human interaction,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not allowed to murder these robots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same as murdering other humans.</p>
<p>Well, but what about you do a backup of the robot</p>
<p>that you preserve on a hard drive</p>
<p>for the equivalent in the future?</p>
<p>That might be illegal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like piracy is illegal.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s your own robot, right?</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But then you can wipe out his brain.</p>
<p>So this robot doesn&rsquo;t know anything about you anymore,</p>
<p>but you still have, technically it&rsquo;s still in existence</p>
<p>because you backed it up.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be these great speeches</p>
<p>at the Supreme Court by saying,</p>
<p>oh, sure, you can erase the mind of the robot</p>
<p>just like you can erase the mind of a human.</p>
<p>We both can suffer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be some epic like Obama type character</p>
<p>with a speech that we,</p>
<p>like the robots and the humans are the same.</p>
<p>We can both suffer.</p>
<p>We can both hope.</p>
<p>We can both, all of those kinds of things,</p>
<p>raise families, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting for these, just like you said,</p>
<p>emotion seems to be a fascinatingly powerful aspect</p>
<p>of human interaction, human robot interaction.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re able to exhibit emotions</p>
<p>at the end of the day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably going to have us deeply consider</p>
<p>human rights, like what we value in humans,</p>
<p>what we value in other animals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why robots and AI is great.</p>
<p>It makes us ask really good questions.</p>
<p>The hard questions, yeah.</p>
<p>But you asked about the Chinese room type argument.</p>
<p>Is it real?</p>
<p>If it looks real.</p>
<p>I think the Chinese room argument is a really good one.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know what Chinese room is,</p>
<p>you can, I don&rsquo;t even know how to formulate it well,</p>
<p>but basically you can mimic the behavior</p>
<p>of an intelligence system by just following</p>
<p>a giant algorithm code book that tells you exactly</p>
<p>how to respond in exactly each case.</p>
<p>But is that really intelligent?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a giant lookup table.</p>
<p>When this person says this, you answer this.</p>
<p>And if you understand how that works,</p>
<p>you have this giant, nearly infinite lookup table.</p>
<p>Is that really intelligence?</p>
<p>Cause intelligence seems to be a mechanism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more interesting and complex</p>
<p>than this lookup table.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>So the, I mean, the real question comes down to,</p>
<p>do you think, you know, you can,</p>
<p>you can mechanize intelligence in some way,</p>
<p>even if that involves learning?</p>
<p>And the answer is, of course, yes, there&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a second question then, which is,</p>
<p>assuming you can reproduce intelligence</p>
<p>in sort of different hardware than biological hardware,</p>
<p>you know, like computers, can you, you know,</p>
<p>match human intelligence in all the domains</p>
<p>in which humans are intelligent?</p>
<p>Is it possible, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the hypothesis of strong AI.</p>
<p>The answer to this, in my opinion, is an unqualified yes.</p>
<p>This will as well happen at some point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that machines at some point</p>
<p>will become more intelligent than humans</p>
<p>in all domains where humans are intelligent.</p>
<p>This is not for tomorrow.</p>
<p>It is going to take a long time,</p>
<p>regardless of what, you know,</p>
<p>Elon and others have claimed or believed.</p>
<p>This is a lot harder than many of those guys think it is.</p>
<p>And many of those guys who thought it was simpler than that</p>
<p>years, you know, five years ago,</p>
<p>now think it&rsquo;s hard because it&rsquo;s been five years</p>
<p>and they realize it&rsquo;s going to take a lot longer.</p>
<p>That includes a bunch of people at DeepMind, for example.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually touched base with the DeepMind folks,</p>
<p>but some of it, Elon or Demis Hassabis.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes in your role,</p>
<p>you have to kind of create deadlines</p>
<p>that are nearer than farther away</p>
<p>to kind of create an urgency.</p>
<p>Because, you know, you have to believe the impossible</p>
<p>is possible in order to accomplish it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, of course, a flip side to that coin,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a weird, you can&rsquo;t be too cynical</p>
<p>if you want to get something done.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>But, I mean, you have to inspire people, right?</p>
<p>To work on sort of ambitious things.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s certainly a lot harder than we believe,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no question in my mind that this will happen.</p>
<p>And now, you know, people are kind of worried about</p>
<p>what does that mean for humans?</p>
<p>They are going to be brought down from their pedestal,</p>
<p>you know, a bunch of notches with that.</p>
<p>And, you know, is that going to be good or bad?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just going to give more power, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amplifier for human intelligence, really.</p>
<p>So, speaking of doing cool, ambitious things,</p>
<p>FAIR, the Facebook AI research group,</p>
<p>has recently celebrated its eighth birthday.</p>
<p>Or, maybe you can correct me on that.</p>
<p>Looking back, what has been the successes, the failures,</p>
<p>the lessons learned from the eight years of FAIR?</p>
<p>And maybe you can also give context of</p>
<p>where does the newly minted meta AI fit into,</p>
<p>how does it relate to FAIR?</p>
<p>Right, so let me tell you a little bit</p>
<p>about the organization of all this.</p>
<p>Yeah, FAIR was created almost exactly eight years ago.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t called FAIR yet.</p>
<p>It took that name a few months later.</p>
<p>And at the time I joined Facebook,</p>
<p>there was a group called the AI group</p>
<p>that had about 12 engineers and a few scientists,</p>
<p>like, you know, 10 engineers and two scientists</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I ran it for three and a half years as a director,</p>
<p>you know, hired the first few scientists</p>
<p>and kind of set up the culture and organized it,</p>
<p>you know, explained to the Facebook leadership</p>
<p>what fundamental research was about</p>
<p>and how it can work within industry</p>
<p>and how it needs to be open and everything.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s been an unqualified success</p>
<p>in the sense that FAIR has simultaneously produced,</p>
<p>you know, top level research</p>
<p>and advanced the science and the technology,</p>
<p>provided tools, open source tools,</p>
<p>like PyTorch and many others,</p>
<p>but at the same time has had a direct</p>
<p>or mostly indirect impact on Facebook at the time,</p>
<p>now Meta, in the sense that a lot of systems</p>
<p>that Meta is built around now are based</p>
<p>on research projects that started at FAIR.</p>
<p>And so if you were to take out, you know,</p>
<p>deep learning out of Facebook services now</p>
<p>and Meta more generally,</p>
<p>I mean, the company would literally crumble.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s completely built around AI these days.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really essential to the operations.</p>
<p>So what happened after three and a half years</p>
<p>is that I changed role, I became chief scientist.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not doing day to day management of FAIR anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more of a kind of, you know,</p>
<p>think about strategy and things like that.</p>
<p>And I carry my, I conduct my own research.</p>
<p>I have, you know, my own kind of research group</p>
<p>working on self supervised learning and things like this,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t have time to do when I was director.</p>
<p>So now FAIR is run by Joel Pinot and Antoine Bord together</p>
<p>because FAIR is kind of split in two now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called FAIR Labs,</p>
<p>which is sort of bottom up science driven research</p>
<p>and FAIR Excel, which is slightly more organized</p>
<p>for bigger projects that require a little more</p>
<p>kind of focus and more engineering support</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So Joel needs FAIR Lab and Antoine Bord needs FAIR Excel.</p>
<p>Where are they located?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delocalized all over.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no question that the leadership of the company</p>
<p>believes that this was a very worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>And what that means is that it&rsquo;s there for the long run.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So if you want to talk in these terms, which I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>this is a business model, if you want,</p>
<p>where FAIR, despite being a very fundamental research lab</p>
<p>brings a lot of value to the company,</p>
<p>either mostly indirectly through other groups.</p>
<p>Now what happened three and a half years ago</p>
<p>when I stepped down was also the creation of Facebook AI,</p>
<p>which was basically a larger organization</p>
<p>that covers FAIR, so FAIR is included in it,</p>
<p>but also has other organizations</p>
<p>that are focused on applied research</p>
<p>or advanced development of AI technology</p>
<p>that is more focused on the products of the company.</p>
<p>So less emphasis on fundamental research.</p>
<p>Less fundamental, but it&rsquo;s still research.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of papers coming out</p>
<p>of those organizations and the people are awesome</p>
<p>and wonderful to interact with.</p>
<p>But it serves as kind of a way</p>
<p>to kind of scale up if you want sort of AI technology,</p>
<p>which, you know, may be very experimental</p>
<p>and sort of lab prototypes into things that are usable.</p>
<p>So FAIR is a subset of Meta AI.</p>
<p>Is FAIR become like KFC?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll just keep the F.</p>
<p>Nobody cares what the F stands for.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll know soon enough, probably by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s not a giant change, Mare, FAIR.</p>
<p>Well, Mare doesn&rsquo;t sound too good,</p>
<p>but the brand people are kind of deciding on this</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been hesitating for a while now.</p>
<p>And they tell us they&rsquo;re going to come up with an answer</p>
<p>as to whether FAIR is going to change name</p>
<p>or whether we&rsquo;re going to change just the meaning of the F.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good call.</p>
<p>I would keep FAIR and change the meaning of the F.</p>
<p>That would be my preference.</p>
<p>I would turn the F into fundamental AI research.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>Within Meta AI.</p>
<p>So this would be meta FAIR,</p>
<p>but people will call it FAIR, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>And now Meta AI is part of the Reality Lab.</p>
<p>So Meta now, the new Facebook is called Meta</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of divided into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp</p>
<p>and Reality Lab.</p>
<p>And Reality Lab is about AR, VR, telepresence,</p>
<p>communication technology and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the, you can think of it as the sort of,</p>
<p>a combination of sort of new products</p>
<p>and technology part of Meta.</p>
<p>Is that where the touch sensing for robots,</p>
<p>I saw that you were posting about that.</p>
<p>Touch sensing for robot is part of FAIR actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a FAIR project.</p>
<p>Oh, it is.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is also the, no, but there is the other way,</p>
<p>the haptic glove, right?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s more Reality Lab.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Reality Lab research.</p>
<p>Reality Lab research.</p>
<p>By the way, the touch sensors are super interesting.</p>
<p>Like integrating that modality</p>
<p>into the whole sensing suite is very interesting.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the Metaverse?</p>
<p>What do you think about this whole kind of expansion</p>
<p>of the view of the role of Facebook and Meta in the world?</p>
<p>Well, Metaverse really should be thought of</p>
<p>as the next step in the internet, right?</p>
<p>Sort of trying to kind of make the experience</p>
<p>more compelling of being connected</p>
<p>either with other people or with content.</p>
<p>And we are evolved and trained to evolve</p>
<p>in 3D environments where we can see other people.</p>
<p>We can talk to them when we&rsquo;re near them</p>
<p>or an other viewer far away can&rsquo;t hear us,</p>
<p>things like that, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of social conventions</p>
<p>that exist in the real world that we can try to transpose.</p>
<p>Now, what is going to be eventually the,</p>
<p>how compelling is it going to be?</p>
<p>Like, is it going to be the case</p>
<p>that people are going to be willing to do this</p>
<p>if they have to wear a huge pair of goggles all day?</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>But then again, if the experience</p>
<p>is sufficiently compelling, maybe so.</p>
<p>Or if the device that you have to wear</p>
<p>is just basically a pair of glasses,</p>
<p>and technology makes sufficient progress for that.</p>
<p>AR is a much easier concept to grasp</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to have augmented reality glasses</p>
<p>that basically contain some sort of virtual assistant</p>
<p>that can help you in your daily lives.</p>
<p>But at the same time with the AR,</p>
<p>you have to contend with reality.</p>
<p>With VR, you can completely detach yourself from reality.</p>
<p>So it gives you freedom.</p>
<p>It might be easier to design worlds in VR.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can imagine the metaverse</p>
<p>being a mix, right?</p>
<p>Or like, you can have objects that exist in the metaverse</p>
<p>that pop up on top of the real world,</p>
<p>or only exist in virtual reality.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask the hard question.</p>
<p>Oh, because all of this was easy so far.</p>
<p>This was easy.</p>
<p>The Facebook, now Meta, the social network</p>
<p>has been painted by the media as a net negative for society,</p>
<p>even destructive and evil at times.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve pushed back against this, defending Facebook.</p>
<p>Can you explain your defense?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the description,</p>
<p>the company that is being described in some media</p>
<p>is not the company we know when we work inside.</p>
<p>And it could be claimed that a lot of employees</p>
<p>are uninformed about what really goes on in the company,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a vice president.</p>
<p>I mean, I have a pretty good vision of what goes on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know everything, obviously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not involved in everything,</p>
<p>but certainly not in decision about content moderation</p>
<p>or anything like this,</p>
<p>but I have some decent vision of what goes on.</p>
<p>And this evil that is being described, I just don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>And then I think there is an easy story to buy,</p>
<p>which is that all the bad things in the world</p>
<p>and the reason your friend believe crazy stuff,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an easy scapegoat in social media in general,</p>
<p>Facebook in particular.</p>
<p>But you have to look at the data.</p>
<p>Is it the case that Facebook, for example,</p>
<p>polarizes people politically?</p>
<p>Are there academic studies that show this?</p>
<p>Is it the case that teenagers think of themselves less</p>
<p>if they use Instagram more?</p>
<p>Is it the case that people get more riled up</p>
<p>against opposite sides in a debate or political opinion</p>
<p>if they are more on Facebook or if they are less?</p>
<p>And study after study show that none of this is true.</p>
<p>This is independent studies by academic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not funded by Facebook or Meta.</p>
<p>Study by Stanford, by some of my colleagues at NYU actually</p>
<p>with whom I have no connection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study recently, they paid people,</p>
<p>I think it was in former Yugoslavia,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure in what part,</p>
<p>but they paid people to not use Facebook for a while</p>
<p>in the period before the anniversary</p>
<p>of the Srebrenica massacres.</p>
<p>So people get riled up, like should we have a celebration?</p>
<p>I mean, a memorial kind of celebration for it or not.</p>
<p>So they paid a bunch of people</p>
<p>to not use Facebook for a few weeks.</p>
<p>And it turns out that those people ended up</p>
<p>being more polarized than they were at the beginning</p>
<p>and the people who were more on Facebook were less polarized.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study from Stanford of economists at Stanford</p>
<p>that try to identify the causes</p>
<p>of increasing polarization in the US.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been going on for 40 years</p>
<p>before Mark Zuckerberg was born continuously.</p>
<p>And so if there is a cause,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not Facebook or social media.</p>
<p>So you could say if social media just accelerated,</p>
<p>but no, I mean, it&rsquo;s basically a continuous evolution</p>
<p>by some measure of polarization in the US.</p>
<p>And then you compare this with other countries</p>
<p>like the West half of Germany</p>
<p>because you can go 40 years in the East side</p>
<p>or Denmark or other countries.</p>
<p>And they use Facebook just as much</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not getting more polarized,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting less polarized.</p>
<p>So if you want to look for a causal relationship there,</p>
<p>you can find a scapegoat, but you can&rsquo;t find a cause.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to fix the problem,</p>
<p>you have to find the right cause.</p>
<p>And what rise me up is that people now are accusing Facebook</p>
<p>of bad deeds that are done by others</p>
<p>and those others are we&rsquo;re not doing anything about them.</p>
<p>And by the way, those others include the owner</p>
<p>of the Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>in which all of those papers were published.</p>
<p>So I should mention that I&rsquo;m talking to Schrepp,</p>
<p>Mike Schrepp on this podcast and also Mark Zuckerberg</p>
<p>and probably these are conversations you can have with them</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very interesting to me,</p>
<p>even if Facebook has some measurable negative effect,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just consider that in isolation.</p>
<p>You have to consider about all the positive ways</p>
<p>that it connects us.</p>
<p>So like every technology.</p>
<p>It connects people, it&rsquo;s a question.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say like there&rsquo;s an increase in division.</p>
<p>Yes, probably Google search engine</p>
<p>has created increase in division.</p>
<p>But you have to consider about how much information</p>
<p>are brought to the world.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m sure Wikipedia created more division.</p>
<p>If you just look at the division,</p>
<p>we have to look at the full context of the world</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t make a better world.</p>
<p>And you have to.</p>
<p>The printing press has created more division, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, so when the printing press was invented,</p>
<p>the first books that were printed were things like the Bible</p>
<p>and that allowed people to read the Bible by themselves,</p>
<p>not get the message uniquely from priests in Europe.</p>
<p>And that created the Protestant movement</p>
<p>and 200 years of religious persecution and wars.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a bad side effect of the printing press.</p>
<p>Social networks aren&rsquo;t being nearly as bad</p>
<p>as the printing press,</p>
<p>but nobody would say the printing press was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of it is perception</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of different incentives operating here.</p>
<p>Maybe a quick comment,</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re one of the top leaders at Facebook</p>
<p>and at Meta, sorry, that&rsquo;s in the tech space,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Facebook involves a lot of incredible</p>
<p>technological challenges that need to be solved.</p>
<p>A lot of it probably is in the computer infrastructure,</p>
<p>the hardware, I mean, it&rsquo;s just a huge amount.</p>
<p>Maybe can you give me context about how much of Shrepp&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>is AI and how much of it is low level compute?</p>
<p>How much of it is flying all around doing business stuff?</p>
<p>And the same with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>They really focus on AI.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly in the run up of the creation of FAIR</p>
<p>and for at least a year after that, if not more,</p>
<p>Mark was very, very much focused on AI</p>
<p>and was spending quite a lot of effort on it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s his style.</p>
<p>When he gets interested in something,</p>
<p>he reads everything about it.</p>
<p>He read some of my papers, for example, before I joined.</p>
<p>And so he learned a lot about it.</p>
<p>He said he liked notes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And Shrepp was really into it also.</p>
<p>I mean, Shrepp is really kind of,</p>
<p>has something I&rsquo;ve tried to preserve also</p>
<p>despite my not so young age,</p>
<p>which is a sense of wonder about science and technology.</p>
<p>And he certainly has that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a wonderful person.</p>
<p>I mean, in terms of like as a manager,</p>
<p>like dealing with people and everything.</p>
<p>Mark also, actually.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re very human people.</p>
<p>In the case of Mark, it&rsquo;s shockingly human</p>
<p>given his trajectory.</p>
<p>I mean, the personality of him that is painted in the press,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just completely wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you have to know how to play the press.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I put some of that responsibility on him too.</p>
<p>You have to, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>like the director, the conductor of an orchestra,</p>
<p>you have to play the press and the public</p>
<p>in a certain kind of way</p>
<p>where you convey your true self to them.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a depth and kindness to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably not the best at it.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>You have to learn.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad to see, and I&rsquo;ll talk to him about it,</p>
<p>but Shrep is slowly stepping down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always sad to see folks sort of be there</p>
<p>for a long time and slowly.</p>
<p>I guess time is sad.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s done the thing he set out to do.</p>
<p>And, you know, he&rsquo;s got, you know,</p>
<p>family priorities and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I understand, you know, after 13 years or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good run.</p>
<p>Which in Silicon Valley is basically a lifetime.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, because, you know, it&rsquo;s dog years.</p>
<p>So, NeurIPS, the conference just wrapped up.</p>
<p>Let me just go back to something else.</p>
<p>You posted that a paper you coauthored</p>
<p>was rejected from NeurIPS.</p>
<p>As you said, proudly, in quotes, rejected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>So, can you describe this paper?</p>
<p>And like, what was the idea in it?</p>
<p>And also, maybe this is a good opportunity to ask</p>
<p>what are the pros and cons, what works and what doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>about the review process?</p>
<p>Yeah, let me talk about the paper first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about the review process afterwards.</p>
<p>The paper is called VicReg.</p>
<p>So, this is, I mentioned that before.</p>
<p>Variance, invariance, covariance, regularization.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a technique, a noncontrastive learning technique</p>
<p>for what I call joint embedding architecture.</p>
<p>So, SiameseNets are an example</p>
<p>of joint embedding architecture.</p>
<p>So, joint embedding architecture is,</p>
<p>let me back up a little bit, right?</p>
<p>So, if you want to do self supervised learning,</p>
<p>you can do it by prediction.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s say you want to train the system</p>
<p>to predict video, right?</p>
<p>You show it a video clip and you train the system</p>
<p>to predict the next, the continuation of that video clip.</p>
<p>Now, because you need to handle uncertainty,</p>
<p>because there are many continuations that are plausible,</p>
<p>you need to have, you need to handle this in some way.</p>
<p>You need to have a way for the system</p>
<p>to be able to produce multiple predictions.</p>
<p>And the way, the only way I know to do this</p>
<p>is through what&rsquo;s called a latent variable.</p>
<p>So, you have some sort of hidden vector</p>
<p>of a variable that you can vary over a set</p>
<p>or draw from a distribution.</p>
<p>And as you vary this vector over a set,</p>
<p>the output, the prediction varies</p>
<p>over a set of plausible predictions, okay?</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>I call this a generative latent variable model.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Okay, now there is an alternative to this,</p>
<p>to handle uncertainty.</p>
<p>And instead of directly predicting the next frames</p>
<p>of the clip, you also run those through another neural net.</p>
<p>So, you now have two neural nets,</p>
<p>one that looks at the initial segment of the video clip,</p>
<p>and another one that looks at the continuation</p>
<p>during training, right?</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re trying to do is learn a representation</p>
<p>of those two video clips that is maximally informative</p>
<p>about the video clips themselves,</p>
<p>but is such that you can predict the representation</p>
<p>of the second video clip</p>
<p>from the representation of the first one easily, okay?</p>
<p>And you can sort of formalize this</p>
<p>in terms of maximizing mutual information</p>
<p>and some stuff like that, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What you want is informative representations</p>
<p>of the two video clips that are mutually predictable.</p>
<p>What that means is that there&rsquo;s a lot of details</p>
<p>in the second video clips that are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a video clip consists in a camera panning</p>
<p>the scene, there&rsquo;s gonna be a piece of that room</p>
<p>that is gonna be revealed, and I can somewhat predict</p>
<p>what that room is gonna look like,</p>
<p>but I may not be able to predict the details</p>
<p>of the texture of the ground</p>
<p>and where the tiles are ending and stuff like that, right?</p>
<p>So, those are irrelevant details</p>
<p>that perhaps my representation will eliminate.</p>
<p>And so, what I need is to train this second neural net</p>
<p>in such a way that whenever the continuation video clip</p>
<p>varies over all the plausible continuations,</p>
<p>the representation doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s the, yeah, yeah, got it.</p>
<p>Over the space of the representations,</p>
<p>doing the same kind of thing</p>
<p>as you do with similarity learning.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, these are two ways to handle multimodality</p>
<p>in a prediction, right?</p>
<p>In the first way, you parameterize the prediction</p>
<p>with a latent variable,</p>
<p>but you predict pixels essentially, right?</p>
<p>In the second one, you don&rsquo;t predict pixels,</p>
<p>you predict an abstract representation of pixels,</p>
<p>and you guarantee that this abstract representation</p>
<p>has as much information as possible about the input,</p>
<p>but sort of, you know,</p>
<p>drops all the stuff that you really can&rsquo;t predict,</p>
<p>essentially.</p>
<p>I used to be a big fan of the first approach.</p>
<p>And in fact, in this paper with Hicham Mishra,</p>
<p>this blog post, the Dark Matter Intelligence,</p>
<p>I was kind of advocating for this.</p>
<p>And in the last year and a half,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve completely changed my mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now a big fan of the second one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because of a small collection of algorithms</p>
<p>that have been proposed over the last year and a half or so,</p>
<p>two years, to do this, including vCraig,</p>
<p>its predecessor called Barlow Twins,</p>
<p>which I mentioned, a method from our friends at DeepMind</p>
<p>called BYOL, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of others now</p>
<p>that kind of work similarly.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re all based on this idea of joint embedding.</p>
<p>Some of them have an explicit criterion</p>
<p>that is an approximation of mutual information.</p>
<p>Some others at BYOL work, but we don&rsquo;t really know why.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been like lots of theoretical papers</p>
<p>about why BYOL works.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not that, because we take it out</p>
<p>and it still works, and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I mean, so there&rsquo;s like a big debate,</p>
<p>but the important point is that we now have a collection</p>
<p>of noncontrastive joint embedding methods,</p>
<p>which I think is the best thing since sliced bread.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m super excited about this</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s our best shot</p>
<p>for techniques that would allow us</p>
<p>to kind of build predictive world models.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>learn hierarchical representations of the world,</p>
<p>where what matters about the world is preserved</p>
<p>and what is irrelevant is eliminated.</p>
<p>And by the way, the representations,</p>
<p>the before and after, is in the space</p>
<p>in a sequence of images, or is it for single images?</p>
<p>It would be either for a single image, for a sequence.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be images.</p>
<p>This could be applied to text.</p>
<p>This could be applied to just about any signal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for methods that are generally applicable</p>
<p>that are not specific to one particular modality.</p>
<p>It could be audio or whatever.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the story behind this paper?</p>
<p>This paper is describing one such method?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this vcrack method.</p>
<p>So, this is coauthored.</p>
<p>The first author is a student called Adrien Barne,</p>
<p>who is a resident PhD student at Fair Paris,</p>
<p>who is coadvised by me and Jean Ponce,</p>
<p>who is a professor at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure,</p>
<p>also a research director at INRIA.</p>
<p>So, this is a wonderful program in France</p>
<p>where PhD students can basically do their PhD in industry,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>And this paper is a followup on this Bardo Twin paper</p>
<p>by my former postdoc, now St√©phane Denis,</p>
<p>with Li Jing and Iorij Bontar</p>
<p>and a bunch of other people from Fair.</p>
<p>And one of the main criticism from reviewers</p>
<p>is that vcrack is not different enough from Bardo Twins.</p>
<p>But, you know, my impression is that it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>Bardo Twins with a few bugs fixed, essentially,</p>
<p>and in the end, this is what people will use.</p>
<p>Right, so.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;m used to stuff</p>
<p>that I submit being rejected for a while.</p>
<p>So, it might be rejected and actually exceptionally well cited</p>
<p>because people use it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s already cited like a bunch of times.</p>
<p>So, I mean, the question is then to the deeper question</p>
<p>about peer review and conferences.</p>
<p>I mean, computer science is a field that&rsquo;s kind of unique</p>
<p>that the conference is highly prized.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because the peer review process there</p>
<p>is similar, I suppose, to journals,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s accelerated significantly.</p>
<p>Well, not significantly, but it goes fast.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a nice way to get stuff out quickly,</p>
<p>to peer review it quickly,</p>
<p>go to present it quickly to the community.</p>
<p>So, not quickly, but quicker.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, it has many of the same flaws</p>
<p>of peer review,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a limited number of people look at it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s bias and the following,</p>
<p>like that if you want to do new ideas,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get pushback.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s self interested people that kind of can infer</p>
<p>who submitted it and kind of, you know,</p>
<p>be cranky about it, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of social phenomena there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one social phenomenon, which is that</p>
<p>because the field has been growing exponentially,</p>
<p>the vast majority of people in the field</p>
<p>are extremely junior.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, as a consequence,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just a consequence of the field growing, right?</p>
<p>So, as the number of, as the size of the field</p>
<p>kind of starts saturating,</p>
<p>you will have less of that problem</p>
<p>of reviewers being very inexperienced.</p>
<p>A consequence of this is that, you know, young reviewers,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a phenomenon which is that</p>
<p>reviewers try to make their life easy</p>
<p>and to make their life easy when reviewing a paper</p>
<p>is very simple.</p>
<p>You just have to find a flaw in the paper, right?</p>
<p>So, basically they see the task as finding flaws in papers</p>
<p>and most papers have flaws, even the good ones.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s easy to, you know, to do that.</p>
<p>Your job is easier as a reviewer if you just focus on this.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s important is like,</p>
<p>is there a new idea in that paper</p>
<p>that is likely to influence?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the experiments are not that great,</p>
<p>if the protocol is, you know, so, so, you know,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>As long as there is a worthy idea in it</p>
<p>that will influence the way people think about the problem,</p>
<p>even if they make it better, you know, eventually,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really what makes a paper useful.</p>
<p>And so, this combination of social phenomena</p>
<p>creates a disease that has plagued, you know,</p>
<p>other fields in the past, like speech recognition,</p>
<p>where basically, you know, people chase numbers</p>
<p>on benchmarks and it&rsquo;s much easier to get a paper accepted</p>
<p>if it brings an incremental improvement</p>
<p>on a sort of mainstream well accepted method or problem.</p>
<p>And those are, to me, boring papers.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re not useless, right?</p>
<p>Because industry, you know, strives</p>
<p>on those kinds of progress,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not the ones that I&rsquo;m interested in,</p>
<p>in terms of like new concepts and new ideas.</p>
<p>So, papers that are really trying to strike</p>
<p>kind of new advances generally don&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>Now, thankfully we have Archive.</p>
<p>Archive, exactly.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s open review type of situations</p>
<p>where you, and then, I mean, Twitter&rsquo;s a kind of open review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge believer that review should be done</p>
<p>by thousands of people, not two people.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And so Archive, like do you see a future</p>
<p>where a lot of really strong papers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already the present, but a growing future</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;ll just be Archive</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re presenting an ongoing continuous conference</p>
<p>called Twitter slash the internet slash Archive Sanity.</p>
<p>Andre just released a new version.</p>
<p>So just not, you know, not being so elitist</p>
<p>about this particular gating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a question of being elitist or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question of being basically recommendation</p>
<p>and sort of approvals for people who don&rsquo;t see themselves</p>
<p>as having the ability to do so by themselves, right?</p>
<p>And so it saves time, right?</p>
<p>If you rely on other people&rsquo;s opinion</p>
<p>and you trust those people or those groups</p>
<p>to evaluate a paper for you, that saves you time</p>
<p>because, you know, you don&rsquo;t have to like scrutinize</p>
<p>the paper as much, you know, is brought to your attention.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the whole idea of sort of, you know,</p>
<p>collective recommender system, right?</p>
<p>So I actually thought about this a lot, you know,</p>
<p>about 10, 15 years ago,</p>
<p>because there were discussions at NIPS</p>
<p>and, you know, and we&rsquo;re about to create iClear</p>
<p>with Yoshua Bengio.</p>
<p>And so I wrote a document kind of describing</p>
<p>a reviewing system, which basically was, you know,</p>
<p>you post your paper on some repository,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say archive or now could be open review.</p>
<p>And then you can form a reviewing entity,</p>
<p>which is equivalent to a reviewing board, you know,</p>
<p>of a journal or program committee of a conference.</p>
<p>You have to list the members.</p>
<p>And then that group reviewing entity can choose</p>
<p>to review a particular paper spontaneously or not.</p>
<p>There is no exclusive relationship anymore</p>
<p>between a paper and a venue or reviewing entity.</p>
<p>Any reviewing entity can review any paper</p>
<p>or may choose not to.</p>
<p>And then, you know, given evaluation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not published, not published,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just an evaluation and a comment,</p>
<p>which would be public, signed by the reviewing entity.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s signed by a reviewing entity,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s one of the members of reviewing entity.</p>
<p>So if the reviewing entity is, you know,</p>
<p>Lex Friedman&rsquo;s, you know, preferred papers, right?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s Lex Friedman writing the review.</p>
<p>Yes, so for me, that&rsquo;s a beautiful system, I think.</p>
<p>But in addition to that,</p>
<p>it feels like there should be a reputation system</p>
<p>for the reviewers.</p>
<p>For the reviewing entities,</p>
<p>not the reviewers individually.</p>
<p>The reviewing entities, sure.</p>
<p>But even within that, the reviewers too,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s another thing here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the reputation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an incentive for an individual person to do great.</p>
<p>Right now, in the academic setting,</p>
<p>the incentive is kind of internal,</p>
<p>just wanting to do a good job.</p>
<p>But honestly, that&rsquo;s not a strong enough incentive</p>
<p>to do a really good job in reading a paper,</p>
<p>in finding the beautiful amidst the mistakes and the flaws</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re the person that first discovered</p>
<p>a powerful paper, and you get to be proud of that discovery,</p>
<p>then that gives a huge incentive to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big part of my proposal, actually,</p>
<p>where I describe that as, you know,</p>
<p>if your evaluation of papers is predictive</p>
<p>of future success, okay,</p>
<p>then your reputation should go up as a reviewing entity.</p>
<p>So yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, I even had a master&rsquo;s student</p>
<p>who was a master&rsquo;s student in library science</p>
<p>and computer science actually kind of work out exactly</p>
<p>how that should work with formulas and everything.</p>
<p>So in terms of implementation,</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s doable?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been sort of, you know,</p>
<p>talking about this to sort of various people</p>
<p>like, you know, Andrew McCallum, who started Open Review.</p>
<p>And the reason why we picked Open Review</p>
<p>for iClear initially,</p>
<p>even though it was very early for them,</p>
<p>is because my hope was that iClear,</p>
<p>it was eventually going to kind of</p>
<p>inaugurate this type of system.</p>
<p>So iClear kept the idea of Open Reviews.</p>
<p>So where the reviews are, you know,</p>
<p>published with a paper, which I think is very useful,</p>
<p>but in many ways that&rsquo;s kind of reverted</p>
<p>to kind of more of a conventional type conferences</p>
<p>for everything else.</p>
<p>And that, I mean, I don&rsquo;t run iClear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just the president of the foundation,</p>
<p>but you know, people who run it</p>
<p>should make decisions about how to run it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to tell them because they are volunteers</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really thankful that they do that.</p>
<p>So, but I&rsquo;m saddened by the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not being innovative enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>I hope that changes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cause the communication science broadly,</p>
<p>but communication computer science ideas</p>
<p>is how you make those ideas have impact, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think, you know, a lot of this is</p>
<p>because people have in their mind kind of an objective,</p>
<p>which is, you know, fairness for authors</p>
<p>and the ability to count points basically</p>
<p>and give credits accurately.</p>
<p>But that comes at the expense of the progress of science.</p>
<p>So to some extent,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re slowing down the progress of science.</p>
<p>And are we actually achieving fairness?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not achieving fairness.</p>
<p>You know, we still have biases.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re doing, you know, a double blind review,</p>
<p>but you know, the biases are still there.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of biases.</p>
<p>You write that the phenomenon of emergence,</p>
<p>collective behavior exhibited by a large collection</p>
<p>of simple elements in interaction</p>
<p>is one of the things that got you</p>
<p>into neural nets in the first place.</p>
<p>I love cellular automata.</p>
<p>I love simple interacting elements</p>
<p>and the things that emerge from them.</p>
<p>Do you think we understand how complex systems can emerge</p>
<p>from such simple components that interact simply?</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big mystery.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s a mystery for physicists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mystery for biologists.</p>
<p>You know, how is it that the universe around us</p>
<p>seems to be increasing in complexity and not decreasing?</p>
<p>I mean, that is a kind of curious property of physics</p>
<p>that despite the second law of thermodynamics,</p>
<p>we seem to be, you know, evolution and learning</p>
<p>and et cetera seems to be kind of at least locally</p>
<p>to increase complexity and not decrease it.</p>
<p>So perhaps the ultimate purpose of the universe</p>
<p>is to just get more complex.</p>
<p>Have these, I mean, small pockets of beautiful complexity.</p>
<p>Does that, cellular automata,</p>
<p>these kinds of emergence of complex systems</p>
<p>give you some intuition or guide your understanding</p>
<p>of machine learning systems and neural networks and so on?</p>
<p>Or are these, for you right now, disparate concepts?</p>
<p>Well, it got me into it.</p>
<p>You know, I discovered the existence of the perceptron</p>
<p>when I was a college student, you know, by reading a book</p>
<p>and it was a debate between Chomsky and Piaget</p>
<p>and Seymour Papert from MIT was kind of singing the praise</p>
<p>of the perceptron in that book.</p>
<p>And I, the first time I heard about the running machine,</p>
<p>right, so I started digging the literature</p>
<p>and I found those paper, those books,</p>
<p>which were basically transcription of workshops</p>
<p>or conferences from the fifties and sixties</p>
<p>about self organizing systems.</p>
<p>So there were, there was a series of conferences</p>
<p>on self organizing systems and there&rsquo;s books on this.</p>
<p>Some of them are, you can actually get them</p>
<p>at the internet archive, you know, the digital version.</p>
<p>And there are like fascinating articles in there by,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy whose name has been largely forgotten,</p>
<p>Heinz von F√∂rster, he&rsquo;s a German physicist</p>
<p>who immigrated to the US and worked</p>
<p>on self organizing systems in the fifties.</p>
<p>And in the sixties he created at University of Illinois</p>
<p>at Urbana Champagne, he created the biological</p>
<p>computer laboratory, BCL, which was all about neural nets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was kind of towards the end</p>
<p>of the popularity of neural nets.</p>
<p>So that lab never kind of strived very much,</p>
<p>but he wrote a bunch of papers about self organization</p>
<p>and about the mystery of self organization.</p>
<p>An example he has is you take, imagine you are in space,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no gravity and you have a big box</p>
<p>with magnets in it, okay.</p>
<p>You know, kind of rectangular magnets</p>
<p>with North Pole on one end, South Pole on the other end.</p>
<p>You shake the box gently and the magnets will kind of stick</p>
<p>to themselves and probably form like complex structure,</p>
<p>you know, spontaneously.</p>
<p>You know, that could be an example of self organization,</p>
<p>but you know, you have lots of examples,</p>
<p>neural nets are an example of self organization too,</p>
<p>you know, in many respect.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a bit of a mystery, you know,</p>
<p>how like what is possible with this, you know,</p>
<p>pattern formation in physical systems, in chaotic system</p>
<p>and things like that, you know, the emergence of life,</p>
<p>you know, things like that.</p>
<p>So, you know, how does that happen?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a big puzzle for physicists as well.</p>
<p>It feels like understanding this,</p>
<p>the mathematics of emergence</p>
<p>in some constrained situations</p>
<p>might help us create intelligence,</p>
<p>like help us add a little spice to the systems</p>
<p>because you seem to be able to in complex systems</p>
<p>with emergence to be able to get a lot from little.</p>
<p>And so that seems like a shortcut</p>
<p>to get big leaps in performance, but&hellip;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a missing concept that we don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something also I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by</p>
<p>since my undergrad days,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s how you measure complexity, right?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t actually have good ways of measuring,</p>
<p>or at least we don&rsquo;t have good ways of interpreting</p>
<p>the measures that we have at our disposal.</p>
<p>Like how do you measure the complexity of something, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all those things, you know,</p>
<p>like, you know, Kolmogorov, Chaitin, Solomonov complexity</p>
<p>of, you know, the length of the shortest program</p>
<p>that would generate a bit string can be thought of</p>
<p>as the complexity of that bit string, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by that concept.</p>
<p>The problem with that is that</p>
<p>that complexity is defined up to a constant,</p>
<p>which can be very large.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There are similar concepts that are derived from,</p>
<p>you know, Bayesian probability theory,</p>
<p>where, you know, the complexity of something</p>
<p>is the negative log of its probability, essentially, right?</p>
<p>And you have a complete equivalence between the two things.</p>
<p>And there you would think, you know,</p>
<p>the probability is something that&rsquo;s well defined mathematically,</p>
<p>which means complexity is well defined.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>You need to have a model of the distribution.</p>
<p>You may need to have a prior</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing Bayesian inference.</p>
<p>And the prior plays the same role</p>
<p>as the choice of the computer</p>
<p>with which you measure Kolmogorov complexity.</p>
<p>And so every measure of complexity we have</p>
<p>has some arbitrary density,</p>
<p>you know, an additive constant,</p>
<p>which can be arbitrarily large.</p>
<p>And so, you know, how can we come up with a good theory</p>
<p>of how things become more complex</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t have a good measure of complexity?</p>
<p>Yeah, which we need for this.</p>
<p>One way that people study this in the space of biology,</p>
<p>the people that study the origin of life</p>
<p>or try to recreate the life in the laboratory.</p>
<p>And the more interesting one is the alien one,</p>
<p>is when we go to other planets,</p>
<p>how do we recognize this life?</p>
<p>Because, you know, complexity, we associate complexity,</p>
<p>maybe some level of mobility with life.</p>
<p>You know, we have to be able to, like,</p>
<p>have concrete algorithms for, like,</p>
<p>measuring the level of complexity we see</p>
<p>in order to know the difference between life and non life.</p>
<p>And the problem is that complexity</p>
<p>is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>So let me give you an example.</p>
<p>If I give you an image of the MNIST digits, right,</p>
<p>and I flip through MNIST digits,</p>
<p>there is obviously some structure to it</p>
<p>because local structure, you know,</p>
<p>neighboring pixels are correlated</p>
<p>across the entire data set.</p>
<p>I imagine that I apply a random permutation</p>
<p>to all the pixels, a fixed random permutation.</p>
<p>Now I show you those images,</p>
<p>they will look, you know, really disorganized to you,</p>
<p>more complex.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;re not more complex in absolute terms,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re exactly the same as originally, right?</p>
<p>And if you knew what the permutation was,</p>
<p>you know, you could undo the permutation.</p>
<p>Now, imagine I give you special glasses</p>
<p>that undo that permutation.</p>
<p>Now, all of a sudden, what looked complicated</p>
<p>becomes simple.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if you have two, if you have, you know,</p>
<p>humans on one end, and then another race of aliens</p>
<p>that sees the universe with permutation glasses.</p>
<p>Yeah, with the permutation glasses.</p>
<p>Okay, what we perceive as simple to them</p>
<p>is hardly complicated, it&rsquo;s probably heat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Heat, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, and what they perceive as simple to us</p>
<p>is random fluctuation, it&rsquo;s heat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s truly in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It depends what kind of glasses you&rsquo;re wearing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It depends what kind of algorithm you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>in your perception system.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll have a theory of intelligence,</p>
<p>self organization, evolution, things like this,</p>
<p>until we have a good handle on a notion of complexity</p>
<p>which we know is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s sad to think that we might not be able</p>
<p>to detect or interact with alien species</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re wearing different glasses.</p>
<p>Because their notion of locality</p>
<p>might be different from ours.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>This actually connects with fascinating questions</p>
<p>in physics at the moment, like modern physics,</p>
<p>quantum physics, like, you know, questions about,</p>
<p>like, you know, can we recover the information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lost in a black hole and things like this, right?</p>
<p>And that relies on notions of complexity,</p>
<p>which, you know, I find this fascinating.</p>
<p>Can you describe your personal quest</p>
<p>to build an expressive electronic wind instrument, EWI?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What does it take to build it?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a tinker.</p>
<p>I like building things.</p>
<p>I like building things with combinations of electronics</p>
<p>and, you know, mechanical stuff.</p>
<p>You know, I have a bunch of different hobbies,</p>
<p>but, you know, probably my first one was little,</p>
<p>was building model airplanes and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I still do that to some extent.</p>
<p>But also electronics, I taught myself electronics</p>
<p>before I studied it.</p>
<p>And the reason I taught myself electronics</p>
<p>is because of music.</p>
<p>My cousin was an aspiring electronic musician</p>
<p>and he had an analog synthesizer.</p>
<p>And I was, you know, basically modifying it for him</p>
<p>and building sequencers and stuff like that, right, for him.</p>
<p>I was in high school when I was doing this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the interesting, like, progressive rock, like 80s.</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the greatest band of all time,</p>
<p>according to Yann LeCun?</p>
<p>Oh, man, there&rsquo;s too many of them.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s a combination of, you know,</p>
<p>Mahavishnu Orchestra, Weather Report,</p>
<p>yes, Genesis, you know, pre Peter Gabriel,</p>
<p>Gentle Giant, you know, things like that.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Okay, so this love of electronics</p>
<p>and this love of music combined together.</p>
<p>Right, so I was actually trained to play</p>
<p>Baroque and Renaissance music and I played in an orchestra</p>
<p>when I was in high school and first years of college.</p>
<p>And I played the recorder, crumb horn,</p>
<p>a little bit of oboe, you know, things like that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a wind instrument player.</p>
<p>But I always wanted to play improvised music,</p>
<p>even though I don&rsquo;t know anything about it.</p>
<p>And the only way I figured, you know,</p>
<p>short of like learning to play saxophone</p>
<p>was to play electronic wind instruments.</p>
<p>So they behave, you know, the fingering is similar</p>
<p>to a saxophone, but, you know,</p>
<p>you have wide variety of sound</p>
<p>because you control the synthesizer with it.</p>
<p>So I had a bunch of those, you know,</p>
<p>going back to the late 80s from either Yamaha or Akai.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both kind of the main manufacturers of those.</p>
<p>So they were classically, you know,</p>
<p>going back several decades.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never been completely satisfied with them</p>
<p>because of lack of expressivity.</p>
<p>And, you know, those things, you know,</p>
<p>are somewhat expressive.</p>
<p>I mean, they measure the breath pressure,</p>
<p>they measure the lip pressure.</p>
<p>And, you know, you have various parameters.</p>
<p>You can vary with fingers,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not really as expressive</p>
<p>as an acoustic instrument, right?</p>
<p>You hear John Coltrane play two notes</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s John Coltrane,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s got a unique sound.</p>
<p>Or Miles Davis, right?</p>
<p>You can hear it&rsquo;s Miles Davis playing the trumpet</p>
<p>because the sound reflects their, you know,</p>
<p>physiognomy, basically, the shape of the vocal track</p>
<p>kind of shapes the sound.</p>
<p>So how do you do this with an electronic instrument?</p>
<p>And I was, many years ago,</p>
<p>I met a guy called David Wessel.</p>
<p>He was a professor at Berkeley</p>
<p>and created the Center for Music Technology there.</p>
<p>And he was interested in that question.</p>
<p>And so I kept kind of thinking about this for many years.</p>
<p>And finally, because of COVID, you know, I was at home,</p>
<p>I was in my workshop.</p>
<p>My workshop serves also as my kind of Zoom room</p>
<p>and home office.</p>
<p>And this is in New Jersey?</p>
<p>In New Jersey.</p>
<p>And I started really being serious about, you know,</p>
<p>building my own iwi instrument.</p>
<p>What else is going on in that New Jersey workshop?</p>
<p>Is there some crazy stuff you&rsquo;ve built,</p>
<p>like just, or like left on the workshop floor, left behind?</p>
<p>A lot of crazy stuff is, you know,</p>
<p>electronics built with microcontrollers of various kinds</p>
<p>and, you know, weird flying contraptions.</p>
<p>So you still love flying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a family disease.</p>
<p>My dad got me into it when I was a kid.</p>
<p>And he was building model airplanes when he was a kid.</p>
<p>And he was a mechanical engineer.</p>
<p>He taught himself electronics also.</p>
<p>So he built his early radio control systems</p>
<p>in the late 60s, early 70s.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what got me into,</p>
<p>I mean, he got me into kind of, you know,</p>
<p>engineering and science and technology.</p>
<p>Do you also have an interest in appreciation of flight</p>
<p>in other forms, like with drones, quadroptors,</p>
<p>or do you, is it model airplane, the thing that&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>You know, before drones were, you know,</p>
<p>kind of a consumer product, you know,</p>
<p>I built my own, you know,</p>
<p>with also building a microcontroller</p>
<p>with JavaScripts and accelerometers for stabilization,</p>
<p>writing the firmware for it, you know.</p>
<p>And then when it became kind of a standard thing</p>
<p>you could buy, it was boring, you know,</p>
<p>I stopped doing it.</p>
<p>It was not fun anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You were doing it before it was cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today</p>
<p>in high school and college</p>
<p>that dreams of doing something big like Yann LeCun,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s talk in the space of intelligence,</p>
<p>dreams of having a chance to solve</p>
<p>some fundamental problem in space of intelligence,</p>
<p>both for their career and just in life,</p>
<p>being somebody who was a part</p>
<p>of creating something special?</p>
<p>So try to get interested by big questions,</p>
<p>things like, you know, what is intelligence?</p>
<p>What is the universe made of?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s life all about?</p>
<p>Things like that.</p>
<p>Like even like crazy big questions,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s time?</p>
<p>Like nobody knows what time is.</p>
<p>And then learn basic things,</p>
<p>like basic methods, either from math,</p>
<p>from physics or from engineering.</p>
<p>Things that have a long shelf life.</p>
<p>Like if you have a choice between,</p>
<p>like, you know, learning, you know,</p>
<p>mobile programming on iPhone</p>
<p>or quantum mechanics, take quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re gonna learn things</p>
<p>that you have no idea exist.</p>
<p>And you may not, you may never be a quantum physicist,</p>
<p>but you will learn about path integrals.</p>
<p>And path integrals are used everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same formula that you use</p>
<p>for, you know, Bayesian integration and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So the ideas, the little ideas within quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>within some of these kind of more solidified fields</p>
<p>will have a longer shelf life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll somehow use indirectly in your work.</p>
<p>Learn classical mechanics, like you&rsquo;ll learn</p>
<p>about Lagrangian, for example,</p>
<p>which is like a huge, hugely useful concept,</p>
<p>you know, for all kinds of different things.</p>
<p>Learn statistical physics, because all the math</p>
<p>that comes out of, you know, for machine learning</p>
<p>basically comes out of, was figured out</p>
<p>by statistical physicists in the, you know,</p>
<p>late 19th, early 20th century, right?</p>
<p>So, and for some of them actually more recently</p>
<p>for, by people like Giorgio Parisi,</p>
<p>who just got the Nobel prize for the replica method,</p>
<p>among other things, it&rsquo;s used for a lot of different things.</p>
<p>You know, variational inference,</p>
<p>that math comes from statistical physics.</p>
<p>So a lot of those kind of, you know, basic courses,</p>
<p>you know, if you do electrical engineering,</p>
<p>you take signal processing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll learn about Fourier transforms.</p>
<p>Again, something super useful is at the basis</p>
<p>of things like graph neural nets,</p>
<p>which is an entirely new sub area of, you know,</p>
<p>AI machine learning, deep learning,</p>
<p>which I think is super promising</p>
<p>for all kinds of applications.</p>
<p>Something very promising,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re more interested in applications,</p>
<p>is the applications of AI machine learning</p>
<p>and deep learning to science,</p>
<p>or to science that can help solve big problems</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>I have colleagues at Meta, at Fair,</p>
<p>who started this project called Open Catalyst,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an open project collaborative.</p>
<p>And the idea is to use deep learning</p>
<p>to help design new chemical compounds or materials</p>
<p>that would facilitate the separation</p>
<p>of hydrogen from oxygen.</p>
<p>If you can efficiently separate oxygen from hydrogen</p>
<p>with electricity, you solve climate change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as that,</p>
<p>because you cover, you know,</p>
<p>some random desert with solar panels,</p>
<p>and you have them work all day,</p>
<p>produce hydrogen,</p>
<p>and then you shoot the hydrogen wherever it&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need anything else.</p>
<p>You know, you have controllable power</p>
<p>that can be transported anywhere.</p>
<p>So if we have a large scale,</p>
<p>efficient energy storage technology,</p>
<p>like producing hydrogen, we solve climate change.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another way to solve climate change,</p>
<p>is figuring out how to make fusion work.</p>
<p>Now, the problem with fusion</p>
<p>is that you make a super hot plasma,</p>
<p>and the plasma is unstable and you can&rsquo;t control it.</p>
<p>Maybe with deep learning,</p>
<p>you can find controllers that will stabilize plasma</p>
<p>and make, you know, practical fusion reactors.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s very speculative,</p>
<p>but, you know, it&rsquo;s worth trying,</p>
<p>because, you know, the payoff is huge.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a group at Google working on this,</p>
<p>led by John Platt.</p>
<p>So control, convert as many problems</p>
<p>in science and physics and biology and chemistry</p>
<p>into a learnable problem</p>
<p>and see if a machine can learn it.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, there&rsquo;s properties of, you know,</p>
<p>complex materials that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>from first principle, for example, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, if we could design new, you know,</p>
<p>new materials, we could make more efficient batteries.</p>
<p>You know, we could make maybe faster electronics.</p>
<p>We could, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of things we can imagine</p>
<p>doing, or, you know, lighter materials</p>
<p>for cars or airplanes or things like that.</p>
<p>Maybe better fuel cells.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all kinds of stuff we can imagine.</p>
<p>If we had good fuel cells, hydrogen fuel cells,</p>
<p>we could use them to power airplanes,</p>
<p>and, you know, transportation wouldn&rsquo;t be, or cars,</p>
<p>and we wouldn&rsquo;t have emission problem,</p>
<p>CO2 emission problems for air transportation anymore.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of those things, I think,</p>
<p>where AI, you know, can be used.</p>
<p>And this is not even talking about</p>
<p>all the sort of medicine, biology,</p>
<p>and everything like that, right?</p>
<p>You know, like, you know, protein folding,</p>
<p>you know, figuring out, like, how could you design</p>
<p>your proteins that it sticks to another protein</p>
<p>at a particular site, because that&rsquo;s how you design drugs</p>
<p>in the end.</p>
<p>So, you know, deep learning would be useful,</p>
<p>although those are kind of, you know,</p>
<p>would be sort of enormous progress</p>
<p>if we could use it for that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>If you take, this is like from recent material physics,</p>
<p>you take a monoatomic layer of graphene, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just carbon on a hexagonal mesh,</p>
<p>and you make this single atom thick.</p>
<p>You put another one on top,</p>
<p>you twist them by some magic number of degrees,</p>
<p>three degrees or something.</p>
<p>It becomes superconductor.</p>
<p>Nobody has any idea why.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I want to know how that was discovered,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the kind of thing that machine learning</p>
<p>can actually discover, these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Maybe not, but there is a hint, perhaps,</p>
<p>that with machine learning, we would train a system</p>
<p>to basically be a phenomenological model</p>
<p>of some complex emergent phenomenon,</p>
<p>which, you know, superconductivity is one of those,</p>
<p>where, you know, this collective phenomenon</p>
<p>is too difficult to describe from first principles</p>
<p>with the current, you know,</p>
<p>the usual sort of reductionist type method,</p>
<p>but we could have deep learning systems</p>
<p>that predict the properties of a system</p>
<p>from a description of it after being trained</p>
<p>with sufficiently many samples.</p>
<p>This guy, Pascal Foua, at EPFL,</p>
<p>he has a startup company that,</p>
<p>where he basically trained a convolutional net,</p>
<p>essentially, to predict the aerodynamic properties</p>
<p>of solids, and you can generate as much data as you want</p>
<p>by just running computational free dynamics, right?</p>
<p>So you give, like, a wing, airfoil,</p>
<p>or something, shape of some kind,</p>
<p>and you run computational free dynamics,</p>
<p>you get, as a result, the drag and, you know,</p>
<p>lift and all that stuff, right?</p>
<p>And you can generate lots of data,</p>
<p>train a neural net to make those predictions,</p>
<p>and now what you have is a differentiable model</p>
<p>of, let&rsquo;s say, drag and lift</p>
<p>as a function of the shape of that solid,</p>
<p>and so you can do back rate and descent,</p>
<p>you can optimize the shape</p>
<p>so you get the properties you want.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible, and on top of all that,</p>
<p>probably you should read a little bit of literature</p>
<p>and a little bit of history</p>
<p>for inspiration and for wisdom,</p>
<p>because after all, all of these technologies</p>
<p>will have to work in the human world.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the human world is complicated.</p>
<p>It is, sadly.</p>
<p>Jan, this is an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really honored that you would talk with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the amazing work you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>at FAIR, at Meta, and thank you for being so passionate</p>
<p>after all these years about everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on, you&rsquo;re a beacon of hope</p>
<p>for the machine learning community,</p>
<p>and thank you so much for spending</p>
<p>your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me on.</p>
<p>That was a pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jan Lacune.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Isaac Asimov.</p>
<p>Your assumptions are your windows on the world.</p>
<p>Scrub them off every once in a while,</p>
<p>or the light won&rsquo;t come in.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
