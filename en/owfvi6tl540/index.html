we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about macros and i&amp;rsquo;m going to give you an easy way to calculate the quantity of macros on keto i have a picture of a plate here and it&amp;rsquo;s divided in half on the left side we have the carbs on the right side we have fat and protein and so the difficulty of really showing you this is that most foods are not a pure fat carbohydrate or protein they&amp;rsquo;re a combination of things so the way i did this should be pretty simple so let&amp;rsquo;s start with carbohydrates you want the majority of carbohydrates to be vegetables at least seven cups or servings okay now how much is that how could you visualize that well if you know about cups you could just take a cup or just take a fist full of salad so you need a minimum of seven cups now problem is that quantity is not going to fit on the half of your plate so i recommend getting an additional bowl to put your salad in now if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do other types of vegetables not leafy greens like broccoli cauliflower bell pepper carrots etc then the quantity goes down to about three and a half cups or servings which is about three fistfuls of those dense types of vegetables and those would definitely fit on half of your plate one cup or serving equals 250 milliliters now if we&amp;rsquo;re going to add berries in there strawberries blueberries and raspberries and there&amp;rsquo;s other barriers as well you can measure that by just having like a cupped hand full of berries on your plate all right now other carbs well there&amp;rsquo;s carbs and avocados there&amp;rsquo;s carbs in hummus there&amp;rsquo;s some carbs and olives but those three have a combination of carbs and fats so i put them right in the kind of the center there and so if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do olives roughly that would be like a half of a cup and you can pretty much judge that if you know what a cup looks like hummus same thing half of a cup avocado we&amp;rsquo;re just talking about a half of an avocado or a lot of times i&amp;rsquo;ll just do a whole avocado so roughly between a half to a whole now let&amp;rsquo;s shift to the fat and protein normally that&amp;rsquo;s combined and i recommend that you try to consume the fattiest protein that you can consume so don&amp;rsquo;t cut off the fat don&amp;rsquo;t take off the skin leave that on try to consume like fish for example that has more fat like salmon would be the ideal situation so if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do meat or fish the size of that quantity if you&amp;rsquo;re male should be the size of the palm if you&amp;rsquo;re male you would do one to two of those okay if you&amp;rsquo;re female you would do one so that&amp;rsquo;s the size of how much your meat or fish should be i realize this is a generalization so if you&amp;rsquo;re a large young person with a fast metabolism maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit more okay so you really have to judge and figure out what&amp;rsquo;s right for you okay so that would be your protein or let&amp;rsquo;s say you get your protein from eggs that would be between two and four eggs for that meal now when we get to nuts nut is a combination between a small amount of carb some is a little bit more than others and protein and fat now a lot of times i&amp;rsquo;ll actually add nuts to the meat or the eggs to give me a little bit more fat and so that would be like a cupped handful of nuts i like to do pecans sometimes i do walnuts now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the quantity of cheese that would be roughly about the size of two of your thumbs of course my thumb is huge so of course that would be a lot of cheese all right and then peanut butter would be also the size of two of your thumbs it could be a little bit more could be a little bit less a lot of times i like to do celery with peanut butter after a meal just because i&amp;rsquo;m trying to get more fat now as far as butter goes now i don&amp;rsquo;t recommend adding a bunch of butter to just eat with your meal but let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re putting it over your vegetables or you&amp;rsquo;re cooking with it i really don&amp;rsquo;t want you to measure it at this point but if you wanted to measure it let&amp;rsquo;s say two tablespoons of butter and then we have olive oil which you can put over your salad or even cook with it and i prefer you not to measure that one because you want to consume a good amount of olive oil and make sure your olive oil is extra virgin and it&amp;rsquo;s the real olive oil with not extra things so also want to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s authentic it&amp;rsquo;s the extra virgin olive oil it&amp;rsquo;s not the fake olive oil coconut oil the same thing don&amp;rsquo;t worry about measuring it just put some in the pan and cook with it now if you&amp;rsquo;re doing mct oil that could be between one and two tablespoons so i just wanted to create this video to give a rough idea of your macros and what they might look like hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down

i&rsquo;m going to give you an easy way to calculate  </p><p>the quantity of macros on keto i have a picture of 
a plate here and it&rsquo;s divided in half on the left  </p><p>side we have the carbs on the right side we have 
fat and protein and so the difficulty of really  </p><p>showing you this is that most foods are not a pure 
fat carbohydrate or protein they&rsquo;re a combination  </p><p>of things so the way i did this should be pretty 
simple so let&rsquo;s start with carbohydrates you want  </p><p>the majority of carbohydrates to be vegetables 
at least seven cups or servings okay now how  </p><p>much is that how could you visualize that 
well if you know about cups you could just  </p><p>take a cup or just take a fist full of salad so 
you need a minimum of seven cups now problem is  </p><p>that quantity is not going to fit on the half of 
your plate so i recommend getting an additional  </p><p>bowl to put your salad in now if you&rsquo;re going 
to do other types of vegetables not leafy greens  </p><p>like broccoli cauliflower bell pepper carrots etc 
then the quantity goes down to about three and a  </p><p>half cups or servings which is about three 
fistfuls of those dense types of vegetables  </p><p>and those would definitely fit on half of your 
plate one cup or serving equals 250 milliliters  </p><p>now if we&rsquo;re going to add berries in there 
strawberries blueberries and raspberries and  </p><p>there&rsquo;s other barriers as well you can measure 
that by just having like a cupped hand full of  </p><p>berries on your plate all right now other carbs 
well there&rsquo;s carbs and avocados there&rsquo;s carbs in  </p><p>hummus there&rsquo;s some carbs and olives but those 
three have a combination of carbs and fats so  </p><p>i put them right in the kind of the center there 
and so if you&rsquo;re going to do olives roughly that  </p><p>would be like a half of a cup and you can pretty 
much judge that if you know what a cup looks like  </p><p>hummus same thing half of a cup avocado we&rsquo;re 
just talking about a half of an avocado or a lot  </p><p>of times i&rsquo;ll just do a whole avocado so roughly 
between a half to a whole now let&rsquo;s shift to the  </p><p>fat and protein normally that&rsquo;s combined and i 
recommend that you try to consume the fattiest  </p><p>protein that you can consume so don&rsquo;t cut off the 
fat don&rsquo;t take off the skin leave that on try to  </p><p>consume like fish for example that has more 
fat like salmon would be the ideal situation  </p><p>so if you&rsquo;re going to do meat or fish the size of 
that quantity if you&rsquo;re male should be the size of  </p><p>the palm if you&rsquo;re male you would do one to two 
of those okay if you&rsquo;re female you would do one  </p><p>so that&rsquo;s the size of how much your meat or fish 
should be i realize this is a generalization so  </p><p>if you&rsquo;re a large young person with a fast 
metabolism maybe it&rsquo;s a little bit more okay  </p><p>so you really have to judge and figure out what&rsquo;s 
right for you okay so that would be your protein  </p><p>or let&rsquo;s say you get your protein from eggs 
that would be between two and four eggs  </p><p>for that meal now when we get to nuts nut is 
a combination between a small amount of carb  </p><p>some is a little bit more than others and protein 
and fat now a lot of times i&rsquo;ll actually add nuts  </p><p>to the meat or the eggs to give me a little 
bit more fat and so that would be like a cupped  </p><p>handful of nuts i like to do pecans sometimes i 
do walnuts now let&rsquo;s talk about the quantity of  </p><p>cheese that would be roughly about the size of 
two of your thumbs of course my thumb is huge so  </p><p>of course that would be a lot of cheese all right 
and then peanut butter would be also the size of  </p><p>two of your thumbs it could be a little bit more 
could be a little bit less a lot of times i like  </p><p>to do celery with peanut butter after a meal 
just because i&rsquo;m trying to get more fat now as  </p><p>far as butter goes now i don&rsquo;t recommend adding 
a bunch of butter to just eat with your meal but  </p><p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re putting it over your vegetables 
or you&rsquo;re cooking with it i really don&rsquo;t want you  </p><p>to measure it at this point but if you wanted to 
measure it let&rsquo;s say two tablespoons of butter  </p><p>and then we have olive oil which you can 
put over your salad or even cook with it  </p><p>and i prefer you not to measure that one because 
you want to consume a good amount of olive oil and  </p><p>make sure your olive oil is extra virgin and 
it&rsquo;s the real olive oil with not extra things so  </p><p>also want to make sure it&rsquo;s authentic it&rsquo;s the 
extra virgin olive oil it&rsquo;s not the fake olive oil  </p><p>coconut oil the same thing don&rsquo;t worry 
about measuring it just put some in the pan  </p><p>and cook with it now if you&rsquo;re doing mct oil 
that could be between one and two tablespoons so  </p><p>i just wanted to create this video to give a 
rough idea of your macros and what they might  </p><p>look like hey before you go real quick i 
have a course entitled how to bulletproof  </p><p>your immune system it&rsquo;s a free course i want 
you to take it and here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you  </p><p>here is your environment everyone is focused on 
this over here avoiding your environment but what  </p><p>about here what about strengthening your immune 
system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show  </p><p>you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can 
tolerate and resist your environment much better  </p><p>by strengthening your own immune system i put 
a link down in the description right down below  </p><p>check it out and get signed up today</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
