    <p>The following is a conversation with Catherine Duclir, a professor of Planetary Science and</p>
<p>Astronomy at Caltech.</p>
<p>Her research is on the surface environments, atmospheres, and thermochemical histories</p>
<p>of the planets and moons in our solar system.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Fundrise, Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and Magic Spoon.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that this conversation and a few others, quite big ones actually,</p>
<p>that are coming up were filmed in a studio where I was trying to outsource some of the</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>Like all experiments, it was a learning experience for me.</p>
<p>It had some positives and negatives.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to return back to doing it the way I was doing before, but hopefully</p>
<p>with a team who can help me out and work with me long term.</p>
<p>The point is, I will always keep challenging myself, trying stuff out, learning, growing,</p>
<p>and hopefully improving over time.</p>
<p>My goal is to surround myself with people who love what they do, are amazing at it,</p>
<p>and are obsessed with doing the best work of their lives.</p>
<p>To me, there&rsquo;s nothing more energizing and fun than that.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m currently hiring a few folks to work with me on various small projects.</p>
<p>If this is something of interest to you, go to lexfreedman.com slash hiring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I will always post opportunities for working with me.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Catherine DeClear.</p>
<p>Why is Pluto not a planet anymore?</p>
<p>Does this upset you or has justice finally been served?</p>
<p>So I get asked this all the time.</p>
<p>I think all planetary scientists get asked about Pluto, especially by kids who, we just</p>
<p>love for Pluto to still be a planet.</p>
<p>But the reality is, when we first discovered Pluto, it was a unique object in the outer</p>
<p>solar system.</p>
<p>And we thought we were adding a planet to the inventory of planets that we had.</p>
<p>And then over time, it became clear that Pluto was not a unique, large object in the outer</p>
<p>solar system, that there were actually many of these.</p>
<p>And as we started discovering more and more of them, we realized that the concept of Pluto</p>
<p>being a planet didn&rsquo;t make sense unless maybe we added all the rest of them as planets.</p>
<p>So you could have imagined actually a different direction that this could have gone where</p>
<p>all the other objects that were discovered in that belt, or at least all the ones, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say, above a certain size, became planets instead of Pluto being declassified.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re now aware of many objects out there in the outer solar system and what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the Kuiper Belt that are of the same size or in some cases even larger than Pluto.</p>
<p>So the declassification was really just a realization that it was not in the same category</p>
<p>as the other planets in the solar system.</p>
<p>And we basically needed to refine our definition in such a way that took into account that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this belt of debris out there in the outer solar system of things with a range</p>
<p>of sizes.</p>
<p>Is there a hope for clear categorization of what is a planet and not, or is it all just</p>
<p>gray area?</p>
<p>When you study planets, when you study moons, satellites of those planets, is there lines</p>
<p>that could be cleanly drawn or is it just a giant mess?</p>
<p>Is it all like a fluid, let&rsquo;s say not mess, but it&rsquo;s like fluid of what is a planet, what</p>
<p>is a moon of a planet, what is debris, what is asteroids, all that kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>So there are technically clear definitions that were set down by the IAU, the International</p>
<p>Astronomy Union.</p>
<p>Is it size related?</p>
<p>Like what are the parameters based on?</p>
<p>So the parameters are that it has to orbit the sun, which was essentially to rule out</p>
<p>satellites.</p>
<p>Of course, this was a not very forward thinking definition because it technically means that</p>
<p>all extrasolar planets according to that definition are not planets.</p>
<p>So it has to orbit the sun.</p>
<p>It has to be large enough that its gravity has caused it to become spherical in shape,</p>
<p>which also applies to satellites and also applies to Pluto.</p>
<p>The third part of the definition is the thing that really rules out everything else, which</p>
<p>is that it has to have cleared out its orbital path.</p>
<p>And because Pluto orbits in a belt of material, it doesn&rsquo;t satisfy that stipulation.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you clear out the path?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not big enough to knock everybody out of the way.</p>
<p>And this actually is not the first time it has happened.</p>
<p>So Ceres, when it was discovered, Ceres is the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt,</p>
<p>and it was originally considered a planet when it was first discovered.</p>
<p>And it went through exactly the same story, history, where people actually realized that</p>
<p>it was just one of many asteroids in the asteroid belt region, and then it got declassified</p>
<p>to an asteroid, and now it&rsquo;s back to a dwarf planet.</p>
<p>So there is a lot of reclassification.</p>
<p>So to me, as somebody who studies solar system objects, I just personally don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>My level of interest in something has nothing to do with what it&rsquo;s classified as.</p>
<p>So my favorite objects in the solar system are all moons, and frequently when I talk</p>
<p>about them, I refer to them as planets because to me they are planets.</p>
<p>They have volcanoes, they have geology, they have atmospheres, they&rsquo;re planet like worlds.</p>
<p>And so the distinction is not super meaningful to me, but it is important just for having</p>
<p>a general framework for understanding and talking about things to have a precise definition.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have a special romantic appreciation of a moon versus a planet versus an asteroid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an object that flies out there and it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the categorization</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s movies about asteroids and stuff, and then there&rsquo;s movies about the moon,</p>
<p>whatever, it&rsquo;s a really good movie.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about moons that&rsquo;s almost like an outlier.</p>
<p>You think of a moon as a thing that&rsquo;s the secret part, and the planet is the more vanilla</p>
<p>regular part.</p>
<p>None of that?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any of that?</p>
<p>No, I actually do.</p>
<p>I really, satellites are, the moons are my favorite things in the solar system.</p>
<p>I think part of what you&rsquo;re saying, I agree from maybe a slightly different perspective,</p>
<p>which is from the perspective of exploration, we&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time sending spacecraft</p>
<p>missions to planets.</p>
<p>We had a mission to Jupiter, we had a mission to Saturn, we have plenty of missions to Mars</p>
<p>and missions to Venus.</p>
<p>I think the exploration of the moons in the outer solar system is the next frontier of</p>
<p>solar system exploration.</p>
<p>The belt of debris, just real quick, that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Is there something incredible to be discovered there?</p>
<p>Again, we tend to focus on the planets and the moons, but it feels like there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>a lot of stuff out there and it probably, what is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a garbage collector from outside of the solar system, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Like, doesn&rsquo;t it protect from other objects that kind of fly in and what, it just feels</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a cool, you know when you like walk along the beach and look for stuff and like</p>
<p>look for, it feels like that&rsquo;s that kind of place where you can find cool weird things.</p>
<p>Or I guess in our conversation today, when we think about tools and what science is studying,</p>
<p>is there something to be studied out there or we just don&rsquo;t have maybe the tools yet</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s nothing to be found?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely a lot to be found.</p>
<p>So the material that&rsquo;s out there is remnant material from the formation of our solar system.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think it comes from outside the solar system, at least not most of it.</p>
<p>But there are so many fascinating objects out there and I think what you fit on is exactly</p>
<p>right that we just don&rsquo;t have the tools to study them in detail.</p>
<p>But we can look out there and we can see there are different species of ice on their surface</p>
<p>that tells us about, you know, the chemical composition of the disk that formed our solar</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>Some of these objects are way brighter than they should be, meaning they have some kind</p>
<p>of geological activity.</p>
<p>People have hypothesized that some of these objects have subsurface oceans.</p>
<p>You could even stretch your imagination and say some of those oceans could be habitable.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t get very detailed information about them because they&rsquo;re so far away.</p>
<p>And so I think if any of those objects were in the inner solar system, it would be studied</p>
<p>intently and would be very interesting.</p>
<p>So would you be able to design a probe in that like very dense debris field, be able</p>
<p>to like hop from one place to another?</p>
<p>Is that just outside of the realm of like how would you even design devices or sensors</p>
<p>that go out there and take pictures and land?</p>
<p>Do you have to land to truly understand a little piece of rock or can you understand</p>
<p>it from remotely, like fly up close and remotely observe?</p>
<p>You can learn quite a lot from just a flyby and that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re currently capable of</p>
<p>doing in the outer solar system.</p>
<p>The New Horizons mission is a recent example which flew by Pluto and then they had searched</p>
<p>for another object that was out there in the Kuiper Belt, any object that was basically</p>
<p>somewhere that they could deflect their trajectory to actually fly by.</p>
<p>And so they did fly by another object out there in the Kuiper Belt and they take pictures</p>
<p>and they do what they can do.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve seen the images from that mission of Pluto, you can see just how much detail</p>
<p>we have compared to just the sort of reddish dot that we knew of before.</p>
<p>So you do get an amazing amount of information actually from just essentially a high speed</p>
<p>flyby.</p>
<p>It always makes me sad to think about flybys that we might be able to, we might fly by</p>
<p>a piece of rock, take a picture and think, oh, that looks pretty and cool and whatever.</p>
<p>And that you could study certain like composition of the surface and so on.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually teeming with life and we won&rsquo;t be able to see it at first.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>Cause you know, like when you&rsquo;re on a deserted island and you wave your hands and the thing</p>
<p>flies by and you&rsquo;re trying to get their attention and they probably do the same, well in their</p>
<p>own way, bacteria probably, right?</p>
<p>But and we miss it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, some reason it makes me, it&rsquo;s the FOMO, it&rsquo;s fear of missing out.</p>
<p>It makes me sad that there might be life out there and we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re not in touch with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>A sad pause, a Russian philosophical pause.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What are the tools available to us to study planets and their moons?</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>That is such a big question.</p>
<p>So among the field of astronomy, so planetary science broadly speaking, well, it falls kind</p>
<p>of at the border of astronomy, geology, climate science, chemistry, and even biology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of on the border of many things, but part of it falls under the heading of</p>
<p>astronomy.</p>
<p>And among the things that you can study with telescopes, like solar system moons and planets,</p>
<p>the solar system is really unique in that we can actually send spacecraft missions to</p>
<p>the objects and study them in detail.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the kind of type of tool that is, that people are most</p>
<p>aware of, that&rsquo;s most popularized, these amazing NASA missions that either you fly by the object,</p>
<p>you orbit the object, you land on the object, potentially you can talk about digging into</p>
<p>it, drilling, trying to detect tectonic tremors on its surface.</p>
<p>The types of tools that I use are primarily telescopes and so I, my background is in astrophysics</p>
<p>and so I actually got into solar system science from astronomy, not from, you know, a childhood</p>
<p>fascination with spacecraft missions, which is actually what a lot of planetary scientists</p>
<p>became planetary scientists because of childhood fascination with spacecraft missions, which</p>
<p>is kind of interesting for me to talk to people and see that trajectory.</p>
<p>I kind of came at it from the fascination with telescopes angle.</p>
<p>So you like telescopes, not rockets, or at least when I was a kid it was looking at the</p>
<p>stars and playing with telescopes that really fascinated me and that&rsquo;s how I got into this.</p>
<p>But telescopes, it&rsquo;s amazing how much detail and how much information you can get from</p>
<p>telescopes today.</p>
<p>You can resolve individual cloud features and watch them kind of sheer out in the atmosphere</p>
<p>of Titan.</p>
<p>You can literally watch volcanoes on Io change from day to day as the lava flows expand.</p>
<p>So and then, you know, spectroscopy, you get compositional information on all these things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, when I started doing solar system astronomy, I was surprised by how much detail</p>
<p>and how much information you can get even from Earth and then as well as from orbit</p>
<p>like the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb.</p>
<p>So with the telescope, you can, I mean, how much information can you get about volcanoes,</p>
<p>about storms, about sort of weather, just so we kind of get a sense, like what a resolution</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of resolution, so at a, you know, on a given night, if I go and take a</p>
<p>picture of Io and its volcanoes, you can sometimes see at least a dozen different volcanoes.</p>
<p>You can see the infrared emission coming off of them and resolve them, separate them from</p>
<p>one another on the surface and actually watch how the heat coming off of them changes with</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And I think this time variability aspect is one of the big advantages we get from telescopes.</p>
<p>So you send a spacecraft mission there and you get an incredible amount of information</p>
<p>over a very short time period.</p>
<p>But for some science questions, you need to observe something for 30 years, 40 years.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s say you want to look at the moon Titan, which has one of the most interesting</p>
<p>atmospheres in the solar system.</p>
<p>Its orbital period is 29, 30 years.</p>
<p>And so if you want to look at how its atmospheric seasons work, you have to observe it over</p>
<p>that long of a time period.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not going to do that with a spacecraft, but you can do it with telescopes.</p>
<p>Can we just zoom in on certain things like, let&rsquo;s talk about Io, which is the moon of</p>
<p>Jupiter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so big.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like volcanoes all over the place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from a distance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So can you tell me about this moon and you&rsquo;re sort of a scholar of many planets and moons,</p>
<p>but that one kind of stood out to me.</p>
<p>So why is that an interesting one?</p>
<p>For so many reasons, but Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system.</p>
<p>It has hundreds of active volcanoes on it.</p>
<p>It has volcanic plumes that go hundreds of kilometers up above its surface.</p>
<p>It puts out more volume of magma per volcano than volcanoes on Earth today.</p>
<p>But I think to me, the reason that it&rsquo;s most interesting is as a laboratory for understanding</p>
<p>planetary processes.</p>
<p>So one of the broad goals of planetary science is to put together a sort of more general</p>
<p>and coherent framework for how planets work in general.</p>
<p>Our current framework, you know, it started out very Earth centric.</p>
<p>We start to understand how Earth volcanoes work.</p>
<p>But then when you try to transport that to somewhere like Io that doesn&rsquo;t have an atmosphere,</p>
<p>which has a very tenuous atmosphere, which makes a big difference for how the magma degasses,</p>
<p>for something that&rsquo;s really small, for something that has a different heat source, for something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s embedded in another object&rsquo;s magnetic field, the kind of intuition we have from</p>
<p>Earth doesn&rsquo;t apply.</p>
<p>And so broadly, planetary science is trying to broaden that framework so that you have</p>
<p>a kind of narrative that you can understand how each planet became different from every</p>
<p>other planet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m already making a mistake.</p>
<p>When I say planet, I mean planets and moons.</p>
<p>Like I said, I see the moons as planets.</p>
<p>As planets.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I actually already noticed that you didn&rsquo;t introduce Io as the moon of Jupiter.</p>
<p>You completely, you kind of ignored the fact that Jupiter exists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s focus on this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, and you also didn&rsquo;t mention Europa, which I think is the, is that the most famous moon</p>
<p>of Jupiter?</p>
<p>Is that the one gets attention because it might have life?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But to you, Io is also beautiful.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between volcanoes on Io versus Earth?</p>
<p>You said atmosphere makes a difference.</p>
<p>What the heat source plays a big role.</p>
<p>So many of the moons in the outer solar system are heated from gravitationally by tidal heating.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to describe what that is or, yeah, please, what&rsquo;s tidal?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So tidal heating is, it&rsquo;s, if you want to understand and contextualize planets and moons,</p>
<p>you have to understand their heat sources.</p>
<p>So for Earth, we have radioactive decay in our interior as well as residual heat of formation.</p>
<p>But for satellites, tidal heating plays a really significant role and in particular</p>
<p>in driving geological activity on satellites and potentially making those subsurface oceans</p>
<p>in places like Europa and Enceladus habitable.</p>
<p>And so the way that that works is if you have multiple moons and their orbital periods are</p>
<p>integer multiples of one another, that means that they&rsquo;re always encountering each other</p>
<p>at the same point in the orbit.</p>
<p>So if they were on just random orbits, they&rsquo;d be encountering each other at random places</p>
<p>and the gravitational effect between the two moons would be canceling out over time.</p>
<p>But because they&rsquo;re always meeting each other at the same point in the orbit, those gravitational</p>
<p>interactions add up coherently.</p>
<p>And so that tweaks them into eccentric orbits.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an eccentric orbit?</p>
<p>So eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit, it just means noncircular, so a deviation from</p>
<p>a circular orbit.</p>
<p>And that means that for Io or Europa, at some points in their orbit, they&rsquo;re closer to Jupiter</p>
<p>and at some points in their orbit, they&rsquo;re farther away.</p>
<p>And so when they&rsquo;re closer, they&rsquo;re stretched out in a sense, but literally just not very</p>
<p>stretched out, like a couple hundred meters, something like that.</p>
<p>And then when they&rsquo;re farthest away, they&rsquo;re less stretched out.</p>
<p>And so you actually have the shape of the object deforming over the course of the orbit.</p>
<p>And these orbits are like just a couple of days.</p>
<p>And so that, in the case of Io, that is literally sufficient friction in its mantle to melt</p>
<p>the rock of its mantle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what generates the magma.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the source of the magma.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So why is, so Europa is, I thought there was like ice and oceans underneath kind of thing.</p>
<p>So why is Europa not getting the friction?</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s just a little bit farther away from Jupiter.</p>
<p>And then Ganymede is also in the orbital resonance.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a three object orbital resonance in the Jupiter system.</p>
<p>But we have these sorts of orbital resonances all over the solar system and also in exoplanets.</p>
<p>So for Europa, basically because it&rsquo;s farther from Jupiter, the effect is not as extreme,</p>
<p>but you do still have heat generated in its interior in this way.</p>
<p>And that may be driving, could be driving hydrothermal activity at the base of its ocean,</p>
<p>which obviously would be a really valuable thing for life.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like heating up the ocean a little bit.</p>
<p>Heating up the ocean a little bit.</p>
<p>And specifically in these like hydrothermal vents where we see really interesting life</p>
<p>evolve in the bottom of Earth&rsquo;s oceans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s Io, what else?</p>
<p>So we know the source is this friction, but there&rsquo;s no atmosphere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get a sense of what it&rsquo;s like if you and I were to visit Io, like what would</p>
<p>that look like?</p>
<p>What would it feel like?</p>
<p>Is this the entire thing covered in basically volcanoes?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting because there&rsquo;s very little atmosphere.</p>
<p>The surface is actually really cold, very far below freezing on the surface when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>away from a volcano, but the volcanoes themselves are over a thousand degrees or the magma when</p>
<p>it comes out is over a thousand degrees.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>But it does come to the surface, the magma?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In particular places.</p>
<p>Whoa, that probably looks beautiful.</p>
<p>So like, so it&rsquo;s frozen, not ice.</p>
<p>Like what is, is rock, it&rsquo;s really cold rock.</p>
<p>And then you just have this like, what is, what does that look, what would that look</p>
<p>like with no atmosphere?</p>
<p>Would that, uh, would it be smoke?</p>
<p>What does it look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just magma, like just red, yellow, like liquidy things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s black, it&rsquo;s black and red, I guess.</p>
<p>Like think of the type of magma that you see in Hawaii.</p>
<p>So different types of magma flow in different ways, for example.</p>
<p>So in somewhere like Io, the magma is really hot and so it will flow out in sheets because</p>
<p>it has really low viscosity.</p>
<p>And I think the lava flows that we&rsquo;ve been having in Hawaii over the past couple of years</p>
<p>are probably a decent analogy, although Io&rsquo;s magma&rsquo;s lavas are even more fluid and faster</p>
<p>moving.</p>
<p>How faster?</p>
<p>Like what, uh, how fat, like if you, uh, by the way, sorry, through the telescope, are</p>
<p>you tracking at what timescale?</p>
<p>Like every frame is how far apart?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking through a telescope, are we talking about seconds or we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about days, months, when you kind of track, try to get a picture of what the surface might</p>
<p>look like, what&rsquo;s the frequency?</p>
<p>So it depends a little bit on what you want to do.</p>
<p>I, ideally every night, um, but you could take a frame every second and see how things</p>
<p>are changing.</p>
<p>The, the problem with that is that for things to change on a one second timescale, you to</p>
<p>actually see something change that fast, you have to have super high resolution.</p>
<p>The spatial resolution we have is a couple of hundred kilometers.</p>
<p>And so things are not changing on those scales over one second, unless you have something</p>
<p>really crazy happening.</p>
<p>So if you get, if you get a telescope closer to Io, if you get a, or a camera closer to</p>
<p>Io, would you be able to understand something?</p>
<p>Is that something of interest to you?</p>
<p>Would you be able to understand something deeper about these volcanic eruptions and</p>
<p>how magma flows and just the, like the rate of the magma is, or is it basically enough</p>
<p>to have the kilometer resolution?</p>
<p>Do you get it?</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>We want to go there.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You want to go, you want to go to Io?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to go there personally, but I want to send a spacecraft mission there.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why are you scared?</p>
<p>Why am I scared?</p>
<p>Oh, you mean you don&rsquo;t like, I don&rsquo;t want to go there as a human as a human.</p>
<p>I want to send a robot there to look at it though.</p>
<p>This is again, everybody&rsquo;s discriminating against robots.</p>
<p>This is not, but it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not hospitable to humans in any way, right?</p>
<p>Just very cold and very hot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very cold.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is composed of sulfur dioxide, so you can breathe it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pressure.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of all the same things you talk about.</p>
<p>One talks about, about Mars only worse, the atmosphere is still a thousand times less</p>
<p>dense than Mars is.</p>
<p>And the radiation environment is terrible because you&rsquo;re embedded deep within Jupiter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>magnetic field and Jupiter&rsquo;s magnetic field is full of charged particles that have all</p>
<p>come out of Io&rsquo;s volcanoes actually.</p>
<p>So Jupiter&rsquo;s magnetic field strips all this material out of Io&rsquo;s atmosphere and that populates</p>
<p>its entire magnetosphere and then that material comes back around and hits Io and spreads</p>
<p>throughout the system actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s like Io is the massive polluter of the Jupiter system.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So what does studying Io teach you about volcanoes on earth or vice versa?</p>
<p>Is in the difference of the two, what insights can you mine out?</p>
<p>That might be interesting in some way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we try to port the tools that we use to study earth volcanism to Io and it works</p>
<p>to some extent, but it is challenging because the situations are so different and the compositions</p>
<p>are really different.</p>
<p>When you talk about outgassing, you know, earth volcanoes outgassed primarily water</p>
<p>and carbon dioxide, and then sulfur dioxide is the third most abundant gas.</p>
<p>And on Io, the water and carbon dioxide are not there, either it didn&rsquo;t form with them</p>
<p>or it lost them, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And so the chemistry of how the magma outgassed this is completely different.</p>
<p>But the kind of one to me most interesting analogy to earth is that, so Io, as I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>it has these really low viscosity magmas, the lava spreads really quickly across its</p>
<p>surface, it can put out massive volumes of magma in relatively short periods of time.</p>
<p>And that sort of volcanism is not happening anywhere else in the solar system today.</p>
<p>But literally every terrestrial planet and the moon had this, what we call very effusive</p>
<p>volcanism early in their history.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is almost like a little glimpse into the early history of earth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So what are the chances that a volcano on earth destroys all of human civilization?</p>
<p>Maybe I wanted to sneak in that question.</p>
<p>Yeah, a volcano on earth.</p>
<p>Do you think about that kind of stuff when you just study volcanoes elsewhere?</p>
<p>Because isn&rsquo;t it kind of humbling to see something so powerful and so hot, like so unpleasant</p>
<p>for humans, and then you realize we&rsquo;re sitting on many of them here?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yellowstone is a classic example.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the chances are of that happening.</p>
<p>My intuition would be that the chances of that are lower than the chances of us getting</p>
<p>wiped out by some other means, that maybe it&rsquo;ll happen eventually, that there&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>one of these massive volcanoes on earth, but we&rsquo;ll probably be gone by then by some other</p>
<p>means.</p>
<p>Not to sound bleak.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very comforting.</p>
<p>Okay, so can we talk about Europa?</p>
<p>Is there, so maybe can you talk about the intuition, the hope that people have about</p>
<p>life being in Europa?</p>
<p>Maybe also, what are the things we know about it?</p>
<p>What are the things to you that are interesting about that particular moon of Jupiter?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, Europa is, from many perspectives, one of the really interesting places in the solar</p>
<p>system among the solar system moons.</p>
<p>So there are a few, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in looking for or understanding the potential</p>
<p>for life to evolve in the subsurface oceans.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fairly widely accepted that the chances of life evolving on the surfaces of</p>
<p>really anything in the solar system is very low.</p>
<p>The radiation environment is too harsh and there&rsquo;s just not liquids on the surface of</p>
<p>most of these things and it&rsquo;s canonically accepted that liquids are required for life.</p>
<p>And so the subsurface oceans, in addition to maybe Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, the subsurface</p>
<p>oceans of the icy satellites are one of the most plausible places in the solar system</p>
<p>for life to evolve.</p>
<p>Europa and Cellitus are interesting because for many of the big satellites, so Ganymede</p>
<p>and Callisto, also satellites of Jupiter, also are thought to have subsurface oceans.</p>
<p>But they have these ice shells and then there&rsquo;s an ocean underneath the ice shell.</p>
<p>But on those moons around Ganymede, we think that there&rsquo;s another ice shell underneath</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s rock.</p>
<p>And the reason that that is a problem for life is that your ocean is probably just pure</p>
<p>water because it&rsquo;s trapped between two big shells of ice.</p>
<p>So Europa doesn&rsquo;t have this ice shell at the bottom of the ocean, we think.</p>
<p>And so the water and rock are in direct interaction and so that means that you can basically dissolve</p>
<p>a lot of material out of the rock.</p>
<p>You potentially have this hydrothermal activity that&rsquo;s injecting energy and nutrients for</p>
<p>life to survive.</p>
<p>And so this rock water interface is considered really important for the potential habitability.</p>
<p>As a small aside, you kind of said that it&rsquo;s canonically assumed that water is required</p>
<p>for life.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have life like in a volcano?</p>
<p>I remember people were like in that National Geographic program or something kind of hypothesizing</p>
<p>that you can really have life anywhere.</p>
<p>So as long as there&rsquo;s a source of heat, a source of energy, do you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to have life in a volcano, like no water?</p>
<p>I think anything&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be water.</p>
<p>You can tell, as you identified, I phrased that really carefully.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s canonically accepted that because scientists recognize that we have no idea what broad</p>
<p>range of life could be out there and all we really have is our biases of life as we know</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But for life as we know it, it&rsquo;s very helpful to have or even necessary to have some kind</p>
<p>of liquid and preferably a polar solvent that can actually dissolve molecules, something</p>
<p>like water.</p>
<p>So the case of liquid methane on Titan is less ideal from that perspective.</p>
<p>But liquid magma, if it stays liquid long enough for life to evolve, you have a heat</p>
<p>source, you have a liquid, you have nutrients.</p>
<p>In theory, that checks your three classic astrobiology boxes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;d be fascinating if it&rsquo;s possible to detect it easily.</p>
<p>How would we detect if there is life on Europa?</p>
<p>Is it possible to do in a noncontact way from a distance through telescopes and so on?</p>
<p>Or do we need to send robots and do some drilling?</p>
<p>I think realistically you need to do the drilling.</p>
<p>So Europa also has these long tectonic features on its surface where it&rsquo;s thought that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>potential for water from the ocean to be somehow making its way up onto the surface.</p>
<p>And you could imagine some out there scenario where there&rsquo;s bacteria in the ocean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow working its way up through the ice shell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spilling out on the surface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being killed by the radiation.</p>
<p>But your instrument could detect some spectroscopic signature of that dead bacterium.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s many ifs and assumptions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hope because then you don&rsquo;t have to do that much drilling.</p>
<p>You can collect from the surface.</p>
<p>Skeletons of bacteria.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking even remotely.</p>
<p>Oh, remotely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sad that there&rsquo;s a single cell civilization living underneath all that ice trying to get</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Trying to get out.</p>
<p>Enceladus gives you a slightly better chance of that because Enceladus is a moon of Saturn</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s broadly similar to Europa in some ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an icy satellite.</p>
<p>It has a subsurface ocean that&rsquo;s probably in touch with the rocky interior.</p>
<p>But it has these massive geysers at its south pole where it&rsquo;s spewing out material that</p>
<p>appears to be originating all the way from the ocean.</p>
<p>And so in that case, you could potentially fly through that plume and scoop up that material</p>
<p>and hope that at the velocities you&rsquo;d be scooping it up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not destroying any signature of the life you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say that you have some ingenuity and can come up with a way to do that.</p>
<p>It potentially gives you a more direct opportunity at least to try to measure those bacteria</p>
<p>directly.</p>
<p>Can you tell me a little more on, how do you pronounce it, Salas?</p>
<p>Enceladus.</p>
<p>Can you tell me a little bit more about Enceladus?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve been talking about way too much about Jupiter, Saturn doesn&rsquo;t get enough love.</p>
<p>Saturn doesn&rsquo;t get as much love.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s Enceladus?</p>
<p>Is that the most exciting moon of Saturn?</p>
<p>Depends on your perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very exciting from a astrobiology perspective.</p>
<p>I think Enceladus and Titan are the two most unique and interesting moons of Saturn that</p>
<p>definitely both get the most attention also from the life perspective.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the more likely Titan or Enceladus for life?</p>
<p>If you were to bet all your money in terms of like investing, which to investigate, what</p>
<p>are the differences between the two that are interesting to you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the potential for life in each of those two places is very different.</p>
<p>So Titan is the one place in the solar system where you might imagine, again, all of this</p>
<p>is so speculative, but you might imagine life evolving in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So from a biology perspective, Titan is interesting because it forms complex organic molecules</p>
<p>in its atmosphere.</p>
<p>It has a dense atmosphere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually denser than Earth&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only moon that has an atmosphere denser than Earth&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s got tons of methane</p>
<p>in it.</p>
<p>What happens is that methane gets irradiated, it breaks up and it reforms with other things</p>
<p>in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It makes these complex organic molecules and it&rsquo;s effectively doing prebiotic chemistry</p>
<p>in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>While still being freezing cold?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What would that be like?</p>
<p>Would that be pleasant for humans to hang out there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really cold?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nowhere in the solar system that would be pleasant for humans.</p>
<p>It would be cold.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t breathe the air.</p>
<p>But colonization wise, if there&rsquo;s an atmosphere, isn&rsquo;t that a big plus?</p>
<p>Or still a ton of radiation?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Titan, that&rsquo;s a really nice feature that life could be in the atmosphere because then</p>
<p>it might be remotely observable or certainly is more accessible if you visit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what about Enceladus?</p>
<p>So that would be still in the ocean.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And Enceladus has the advantage, like I said, of spewing material out of its south pole</p>
<p>so you could collect it.</p>
<p>But it has the disadvantage of the fact that we don&rsquo;t actually really understand how its</p>
<p>ocean could stay globally liquid over the age of the solar system.</p>
<p>And so there are some models that say that it&rsquo;s going through this cyclical evolution</p>
<p>where the ocean freezes completely and thaws completely and the orbit sort of oscillates</p>
<p>in and out of these eccentricities.</p>
<p>And in that case, the potential for life ever occurring there in the first place is a lot</p>
<p>lower because if you only have an ocean for 100 million years, is that enough time?</p>
<p>It also means there might be mass extinction events if it does occur and then it just freezes.</p>
<p>Again, very sad, man.</p>
<p>This is very depressing, all the slaughter of life elsewhere.</p>
<p>How unlikely do you think life is on Earth?</p>
<p>So when you study other planets and you study the contents of other planets, does that give</p>
<p>you a perspective on the origin of life on Earth, which again is full of mystery in itself,</p>
<p>not the evolution, but the origin, the first springing to life, like from nothing to life,</p>
<p>from the basic ingredients to life?</p>
<p>I guess another way of asking it is how unique are we?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great question and it&rsquo;s one that just scientifically we don&rsquo;t have an answer</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know how many times life evolved on Earth, if it was only once or if it happened</p>
<p>independently a thousand times in different places.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s happened anywhere else in the universe, although it feels absurd</p>
<p>to believe that we are the only life that evolved in the entire universe, but it&rsquo;s conceivable.</p>
<p>We just have just no real information.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand really how life came about in the first place on Earth.</p>
<p>I mean, so if you look at the Drake equation that tries to estimate how many alien civilizations</p>
<p>are out there, planets have a big part to play in that equation.</p>
<p>If you were to bet money in terms of the odds of origins of life on Earth, I mean, this</p>
<p>all has to do with how special and unique is Earth.</p>
<p>What you land in terms of the number of civilizations has to do with how unique their rare Earth</p>
<p>hypothesis is.</p>
<p>How rare and special is Earth?</p>
<p>How rare and special is the solar system?</p>
<p>Like if you had to bet all your money on a completely unscientific question, well, no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a rigorously scientific, we just don&rsquo;t know a lot of things in that equation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of mysteries about that and it&rsquo;s slowly becoming better and better understood</p>
<p>in terms of exoplanets, in terms of how many solar systems are out there where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>planets that are Earth like planets, it&rsquo;s getting better and better understood.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense from that perspective, how many alien civilizations out there, zero or</p>
<p>one plus?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that the equation is being better understood, but you&rsquo;re really only talking</p>
<p>about the first three parameters in the equation or something.</p>
<p>How many stars are there, how many planets per star, and then we&rsquo;re just barely scratching</p>
<p>the surface of what fraction of those planets might be habitable.</p>
<p>The rest of the terms in the equation are like how likely is life to evolve given habitable</p>
<p>conditions, how likely is it to survive, all these things.</p>
<p>There are all these huge unknowns.</p>
<p>Actually I remember when I first saw that equation, I think it was my first year of</p>
<p>college and I thought this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is A, common sense that didn&rsquo;t need to give a name, you know, and B, just a bunch</p>
<p>of unknowns, it&rsquo;s like putting our ignorance together in one equation.</p>
<p>But now I understand this equation, you know, it&rsquo;s not something we&rsquo;ll ever necessarily</p>
<p>have the answer to, it just gives us a framework for having the exact conversation we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s how it was intended in the first place when it was put into writing</p>
<p>was to give people a language to communicate about the factors that go into the potential</p>
<p>for aliens to be out there and for us to find them.</p>
<p>I would put money on there being aliens, I would not put money on us having definitive</p>
<p>evidence of them in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Well, definitive is a funny, is a funny word.</p>
<p>My sense is, this is the saddest part for me, is my sense in terms of intelligent alien</p>
<p>civilizations, I feel like we&rsquo;re so, we&rsquo;re so self obsessed that we literally would not</p>
<p>be able to detect them.</p>
<p>Even when they&rsquo;re like in front of us, like trees could be aliens, but just their intelligence</p>
<p>could be realized on a scale, on a time scale or physical scale that we&rsquo;re not appreciating.</p>
<p>Like trees could be way more intelligent than us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a dumb example.</p>
<p>It could be rocks or it could be things like, this, I love this, this is a Dawkins memes.</p>
<p>It could be that ideas are the, like ideas we have, like where do ideas come from?</p>
<p>Where do thoughts come from?</p>
<p>Maybe thoughts are the aliens or maybe thoughts is the actual mechanisms of communication</p>
<p>in physics, right?</p>
<p>This is like, we think of thoughts as something that springs up from neurons firing or where</p>
<p>the hell they come from.</p>
<p>And now what about consciousness?</p>
<p>Maybe consciousness is the communication.</p>
<p>It sounds like ridiculous, but like we&rsquo;re so self centered on this space, time, communication</p>
<p>and physical space using like written language, like spoken with audio on a time scale that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very specific on a physical scale, it&rsquo;s very specific.</p>
<p>So I tend to think that, but bacteria will probably recognize like moving organisms will</p>
<p>probably recognize, but when that forms itself into intelligence, most likely it&rsquo;ll be robots</p>
<p>of some kind because we won&rsquo;t be meeting the origins.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be meeting the creations of those intelligences.</p>
<p>We just would not be able to appreciate it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the saddest thing to me that we, yeah, we&rsquo;re too dumb to see aliens.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re too, we kind of think like, look at the progress of science, we&rsquo;ve accomplished</p>
<p>so much.</p>
<p>The sad thing it could be that we&rsquo;re just like in the first 0.0001% of understanding</p>
<p>anything is humbling.</p>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s true because I feel like we&rsquo;re very ignorant as a species.</p>
<p>And I hope that our current level of knowledge only represents the 0.001% of what we will</p>
<p>someday achieve.</p>
<p>That actually feels optimistic to me.</p>
<p>Well, I feel like that&rsquo;s easier for us to comprehend in the space of biology and not</p>
<p>as easy to comprehend in the space of physics, for example, because we have a sense that</p>
<p>like we have it, like if you, if you talk to theoretical physicists, they have a sense</p>
<p>that we understand the basic laws that form the nature of reality of our universe.</p>
<p>But so there&rsquo;s much more, like physicists are much more confident.</p>
<p>Biologists are like, uh, this is a squishy mess, we&rsquo;re doing our best, physicists, but</p>
<p>I would be, it&rsquo;d be fascinating to see if physicists themselves would also be humbled</p>
<p>by their being like, what the hell is dark matter and dark energy?</p>
<p>What the hell is the, not just the origin of the, not just the big bang, but everything</p>
<p>that happened since the big bang.</p>
<p>A lot of things that happened since the big bang, we have no ideas about except basic</p>
<p>models of physics.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What happened before the big bang?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What happened before?</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s happening inside the black hole?</p>
<p>Why is there a black hole at the center of our galaxy?</p>
<p>Can somebody answer this?</p>
<p>A supermassive black hole.</p>
<p>Nobody knows how it started.</p>
<p>And they seem to be like in the middle of all galaxies.</p>
<p>Um, so that could be a portal for aliens to communicate through consciousness.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Um, all right, back to planets.</p>
<p>How, um, what&rsquo;s your favorite outside of earth?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite planet or moon?</p>
<p>Maybe outside of the ones we, well, first, have we talked about it already or, and then</p>
<p>if we did mention it, what&rsquo;s the one outside of that?</p>
<p>Oh gosh.</p>
<p>I have to come up with another favorite that&rsquo;s not IO.</p>
<p>Oh, IO is the favorite.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Why is IO the favorite?</p>
<p>I mean, basically everything I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve already said, it&rsquo;s just such a, an amazing and unique</p>
<p>object.</p>
<p>Um, but on, I guess a personal note, it&rsquo;s probably the object that made me become a</p>
<p>planetary scientist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first thing in the solar system that really deeply captured my interest.</p>
<p>Um, and when I started my PhD, I wanted to be an astrophysicist working on things like</p>
<p>galaxy evolution, um, and sort of slowly, I had done some projects in the solar system,</p>
<p>but IO was the thing that like really caught me in to doing solar system science.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s leave, uh, moons aside.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite planet?</p>
<p>It sounds like you like moons better than planets.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, uh, that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>Um, but the planets are, are fascinating.</p>
<p>I think, you know, I find that the planets in the solar system really fascinating.</p>
<p>What I like about the moons is that they, there&rsquo;s so much less that is known.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot more discovery space and the questions that we can ask are still the,</p>
<p>the bigger questions.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Um, which, you know, I, and maybe I&rsquo;m being unfair to the planets because we&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>trying to understand things like, was there ever life on Mars?</p>
<p>And that is a huge question and one that we&rsquo;ve sent numerous robots to Mars to try to answer.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;m being unfair to the planets, but, but there is certainly quite a bit more</p>
<p>information, uh, that we have about the planets than the moons.</p>
<p>But I mean, Venus is, is a fascinating object.</p>
<p>So I like the objects that lie at the extremes.</p>
<p>I think that if we can make a sort of theory or, or like I&rsquo;ve been saying, framework for</p>
<p>understanding planets and moons that can incorporate even the most extreme ones, then, you know,</p>
<p>those are the things that really test your theory and test your understanding.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve always really fascinated me.</p>
<p>Not so much the nice habitable places like Earth, but these extreme places like Venus</p>
<p>that have, um, sulfuric acid clouds and just incredibly hot and dense surfaces.</p>
<p>And Venus, of course, I love volcanism for some reason, and, and Venus has, probably</p>
<p>has volcanic activity, definitely has in their recent past, maybe has ongoing today.</p>
<p>What do you make of the news and maybe you can update it in terms of life being discovered</p>
<p>in the atmosphere of Venus?</p>
<p>Is that, sorry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You have opinion.</p>
<p>I can already tell you have opinions.</p>
<p>Was that fake news?</p>
<p>I got excited when I saw that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, what&rsquo;s the final, uh, is there a life on Venus?</p>
<p>So the detection that was reported was the detection of the molecule phosphine.</p>
<p>Um, and they said that they tried every other mechanism they could think of to produce phosphine</p>
<p>and they, none of, no mechanism worked.</p>
<p>And then they said, well, we know that life produces phosphine.</p>
<p>And so that was sort of the train of logic.</p>
<p>And, um, I don&rsquo;t personally believe that phosphine was detected in the first place.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then, I mean, this is just one study, but I, as a layman, I&rsquo;m skeptical a little bit</p>
<p>about tools that sense the contents of an atmosphere, like contents of an atmosphere</p>
<p>from remotely and making conclusive statements about life.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Well that connection that you just made, the contents of the atmosphere to the life is,</p>
<p>is a tricky one.</p>
<p>And yeah, I know that that claim received a lot of criticism for the lines of logic</p>
<p>that went from detection to, uh, to claim of life.</p>
<p>Even the detection itself though, did, doesn&rsquo;t, doesn&rsquo;t meet the sort of historical scientific</p>
<p>standards of, of a detection.</p>
<p>Um, the, it was a very tenuous detection and only one line of the species was detected.</p>
<p>And a lot of really complicated data analysis methods had to be applied to even make that</p>
<p>weak detection.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>So it could be, it could be noise, it could be polluted data, it could be all the, all</p>
<p>those things.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t have, it doesn&rsquo;t meet the, the level of rigor that you would hope.</p>
<p>But of course, I mean, we&rsquo;re doing our best and it&rsquo;s clear that, uh, the human species</p>
<p>are hopeful to find life.</p>
<p>Clearly.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Everyone is so excited about that possibility.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, uh, let me ask you about Mars.</p>
<p>So, um, there&rsquo;s a guy named Elon Musk and, uh, he seems to want to take something called</p>
<p>Dogecoin there.</p>
<p>First of the month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m just kidding about the Dogecoin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what the heck is up with that whole, um, I think, uh, I think humor</p>
<p>has power in the 21st century in a way to spread ideas in the most positive way.</p>
<p>So I love that kind of humor because it makes people smile, but it also kind of sneaks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Trojan horse for cool ideas.</p>
<p>You you open with humor and you, uh, like the humor is the appetizer.</p>
<p>And then the main meal is the science and the engineering anyway, uh, do you think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible to colonize Mars or other planets in the solar system, but we&rsquo;re especially</p>
<p>looking to Mars.</p>
<p>Is there something about planets that make them very harsh to humans?</p>
<p>Is there something in particular you think about and maybe in a high like big picture</p>
<p>perspective, do you have a hope we, we do in fact become a multi planetary species?</p>
<p>I do think that if our species survives long enough and we don&rsquo;t wipe ourselves out or</p>
<p>get wiped out by some other means that we will eventually be able to colonize other</p>
<p>planets.</p>
<p>I do not expect that to happen in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I mean, tourists may go to Mars, tourists, people who commit years of their life to go</p>
<p>into Mars as a tourist may go to Mars.</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t think that we will colonize it.</p>
<p>Um, is there a sense why it&rsquo;s just too harsh on the environment to, uh, to, to, like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too costly to build something habitable there for a large population.</p>
<p>I think that we need to do a lot of work and learning how to use the resources that are</p>
<p>are on the planet already to do the things we need.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re talking about someone going there for a few months, um, so we&rsquo;ll back up a little</p>
<p>bit.</p>
<p>There are many things that make Mars not hospitable, temperature, you can&rsquo;t breathe the air, you</p>
<p>need a pressure suit, even if you&rsquo;re on the surface, the radiation environment is, you</p>
<p>know, even in all of those things, the radiation environment is too harsh for the human body.</p>
<p>Um, all of those things seem like they could eventually have technological solutions.</p>
<p>Um, the challenge, the, the real significant challenge to me seems to be the, the creation</p>
<p>of a self sustaining civilization there.</p>
<p>You know, you can bring pressure suits, you can bring oxygen to breathe, but those are</p>
<p>all in limited supply.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re going to colonize it, we need to find ways to make use of the resources</p>
<p>that are there to do things like produce food, produce the air, the humans need to keep breathing</p>
<p>just in order to make it self sustaining.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of work that has to be done.</p>
<p>And people are working on these problems, but I think that&rsquo;s going to be a major obstacle</p>
<p>in going from visiting where we can bring everything we need to survive in the short</p>
<p>term to actually colonizing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I find that whole project of the human species quite inspiring these like huge moonshot projects.</p>
<p>Somebody I was reading something, um, in terms of the source of food that&rsquo;s that may be the</p>
<p>most effective on Mars is you could farm insects.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the easiest thing to farm.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d be eating like cockroaches before living on Mars because that&rsquo;s the easiest</p>
<p>thing to actually, um, as a source of protein.</p>
<p>So growing a source of protein is the easiest thing as insects.</p>
<p>I just imagine this giant for people who are afraid of insects.</p>
<p>This is not a pleasant, maybe you&rsquo;re not supposed to even think of it that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be like a cockroach milkshake or something like that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I wonder if, have people been working on the genetic engineering of, of insects to make</p>
<p>them radiation friendly, right.</p>
<p>Or pressure resistant or whatever.</p>
<p>What can possibly go wrong with making radiation resistant, they&rsquo;re already like survived everything.</p>
<p>Plus I, um, I took an allergy test, um, in Austin.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s alert is like the allergy levels are super high there.</p>
<p>Uh, and, uh, one of the things, apparently I&rsquo;m not allergic to any insects except cockroaches.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>So maybe, uh, um, well, I&rsquo;m going to use that as a, you know, people use, uh, an excuse</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m allergic to cats to not have cats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use that as an excuse to, uh, not go to Mars as one of the first batch of</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>I was going to ask if you had the opportunity, would you go?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m joking about the cockroach thing.</p>
<p>I would definitely go.</p>
<p>I love challenges.</p>
<p>I love, I love things.</p>
<p>I love doing things where the possibility of death is, is, uh, not insignificant because</p>
<p>it makes me appreciate it more.</p>
<p>Meditating on death makes me appreciate life.</p>
<p>And uh, when the meditation on death is forced on you because of how difficult the task is,</p>
<p>I enjoy those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t, it seems like, but I love the idea of difficult journeys, um, for no</p>
<p>purpose whatsoever, except exploration, going into the unknown, seeing what the limits of</p>
<p>the human mind and the human body are is like, what the hell else is this whole journey that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on for?</p>
<p>I, I, uh, but it could be because I grew up in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of love for space, like the, the space race, the cold war created.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if still it permeates American culture as much, but especially with the dad</p>
<p>as a scientist, I think I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve loved the idea of humans striving out towards the stars</p>
<p>always, like from the engineering perspective has been really exciting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people love that as much in America anymore.</p>
<p>I think, uh, Elon is bringing that back a little bit, that excitement about rockets</p>
<p>and going out there.</p>
<p>But, uh, so that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s hopeful, but for me, I always loved that idea.</p>
<p>From a alien scientist perspective, if you were to look back on earth, is there something</p>
<p>interesting you could say about earth?</p>
<p>Like, how would you summarize earth?</p>
<p>Like in a report, you know, like, uh, Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy, like if you had to report,</p>
<p>like write a paper on earth or like a letter, like a, like a one pager, um, summarizing</p>
<p>the contents of the surface and the atmosphere, is there, is there something interesting?</p>
<p>Like, do you ever take that kind of perspective on it?</p>
<p>I know you like volcanism, so volcanoes that will probably be in the report.</p>
<p>I was going to say that&rsquo;s where I was going to go first.</p>
<p>Uh, there are a few things to say about the atmosphere, but in terms of the volcanoes,</p>
<p>so one of the really interesting puzzles to me in planetary science is so we can, we can</p>
<p>look out there and we&rsquo;ve been talking about surfaces and volcanoes and atmospheres and</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>But that is just, you know, this tiny little veneer on the outside of the planet and most</p>
<p>of the planet is completely sort of inaccessible to telescopes or to spacecraft missions.</p>
<p>You can drill a meter into the surface, but you know, that&rsquo;s still really the veneer.</p>
<p>Um, and one of the cool puzzles is looking at what&rsquo;s going on on the surface and trying</p>
<p>to figure out what&rsquo;s happening underneath or just any kind of indirect means that you</p>
<p>have to study the interior because you can&rsquo;t dig into it directly, even on Earth.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t dig deep into Earth.</p>
<p>Uh, so from that perspective, looking at Earth, um, one thing that you would be able to tell</p>
<p>from orbit, given enough time, is that Earth has tectonic plates.</p>
<p>So you would see that volcanoes follow the edges.</p>
<p>If you trace where all the volcanoes are on Earth, they follow these lines that trace</p>
<p>the edges of the plates.</p>
<p>And similarly, you would see things like the, uh, Hawaiian string of volcanoes that you</p>
<p>could infer just like, you know, we did as people actually living on Earth, that the</p>
<p>plates are moving over some plume that&rsquo;s coming up through the mantle.</p>
<p>And so you could use that to say, if the aliens could look at where the volcanoes are, are</p>
<p>happening on Earth and say something about the fact that Earth has plate tectonics, which</p>
<p>makes it really unique in the solar system.</p>
<p>Um&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>So the other planets don&rsquo;t have plate tectonics?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only one that has plate tectonics.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about Io and the friction and all that, that&rsquo;s not plate tectonics?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s plate tectonics, like another layer of like solid rock that moves around and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cracks.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, so Earth has plates of solid rock sitting on top of a partially molten layer, and those</p>
<p>plates are kind of shifting around.</p>
<p>Um, on Io, it doesn&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>And the volcanism is what we call heat pipe volcanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the magma just punches a hole through the crust and comes out on the surface.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a simplification, but that&rsquo;s effectively what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Through the freezing cold crust?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Very cold, very rigid crust.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you, how does that look like, by the way?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve mentioned, so the gas that&rsquo;s expelled, like if we were to look at</p>
<p>it, is it beautiful or is it like boring?</p>
<p>The gas?</p>
<p>I mean, the whole thing, like the magma punching through, the icy&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m sure it would be beautiful, and the pictures we&rsquo;ve seen of it are beautiful.</p>
<p>You have, so the magma will come out of the lava, will come out of these fissures, and</p>
<p>you have these curtains of lava that are maybe even a kilometer high.</p>
<p>So if you looked at videos, I don&rsquo;t know how many volcano videos you&rsquo;ve looked at on Earth,</p>
<p>but you sometimes see a tiny, tiny version of this in Iceland.</p>
<p>You see just these sheets of magma coming out of a fissure when you have this really</p>
<p>low viscosity magma, sort of water like, coming out of these sheets.</p>
<p>And the plumes that come out, because there&rsquo;s no atmosphere, all the plume molecules are</p>
<p>just plume particles, where they end up is just a function of the direction that they</p>
<p>left the vent, so they&rsquo;re all following ballistic trajectories, and you end up with these umbrella</p>
<p>plumes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get these sort of complicated plumes that you have on Earth that are occurring</p>
<p>because of how that material is interacting with the atmosphere that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>You just have these huge umbrellas, and it&rsquo;s been hypothesized, actually, that the atmosphere</p>
<p>is made of sulfur dioxide, and that you could have these kind of ash particles from the</p>
<p>volcano and the sulfur dioxide would condense onto these particles, and you&rsquo;d have sulfur</p>
<p>dioxide snow coming out of these volcanic plumes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not much light, though, right?</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to, like, it would not make a good Instagram photo, because you</p>
<p>have to, would you see the snow?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So you could, okay.</p>
<p>It depends what angle you&rsquo;re looking at it, where the sun is, all the things like that.</p>
<p>You know, the sunlight is much weaker, but it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>And how big is Io in terms of gravity?</p>
<p>Is it smaller?</p>
<p>Is it a pretty small moon?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite a bit smaller than Earth anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s smaller than Earth.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So they float up for a little bit.</p>
<p>So it floats.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That would be gorgeous.</p>
<p>What else about Earth is interesting besides volcanoes?</p>
<p>So plate tectonics.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that that was a unique element of a planet in the solar system, because that,</p>
<p>I wonder what, I mean, we experienced as human beings, it&rsquo;s quite painful because of earthquakes</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things, but I wonder if there&rsquo;s nice features to it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So coming back to habitability again, things like tectonics and plate tectonics are thought</p>
<p>to play an important role in the surface being habitable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you have a way of recycling materials.</p>
<p>So if you have a stagnant surface, everything, you know, you use up all the free oxygen,</p>
<p>everything reacts until you no longer have reactants that life can extract energy from.</p>
<p>And so if nothing&rsquo;s changing on your surface, you kind of reach this stagnation point.</p>
<p>But something like plate tectonics recycles material, you bring up new fresh material</p>
<p>from the interior, you bring down material that&rsquo;s up on the surface, and that can kind</p>
<p>of refresh your nutrient supply, in a sense, or the sort of raw materials that the surface</p>
<p>has to work with.</p>
<p>So from a kind of astrobiologist perspective, looking at Earth, you would see that recycling</p>
<p>of material because the plate tectonics, you would also see how much oxygen is in Earth&rsquo;s</p>
<p>atmosphere.</p>
<p>And between those two things, you would identify Earth as a reasonable candidate for a habitable</p>
<p>environment in addition to, of course, the, you know, pleasant temperature and liquid</p>
<p>water.</p>
<p>But the abundance of oxygen and the plate tectonics both play a role as well.</p>
<p>And also see like tiny dot satellites flying around and rockets.</p>
<p>Well, sure, yes.</p>
<p>I wonder if they would be able to, I really think about that, like, if aliens were to</p>
<p>visit, and would they really see humans as the thing they should be focusing on?</p>
<p>I think it would take a while, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so obvious that that should, because there&rsquo;s like so much incredible,</p>
<p>in terms of biomass, humans are a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like ants, they would probably detect ants, right?</p>
<p>Or they probably would focus on the water and the fish because there&rsquo;s like a lot of</p>
<p>water.</p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that there&rsquo;s more species on land than there is in the sea.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s 90, I think 90 to 95% of the species are on land.</p>
<p>Or on land?</p>
<p>On land.</p>
<p>Not in the sea?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Not in the sea.</p>
<p>Not in the sea, but no, the variety that like the branches created by evolution, apparently</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a good answer from evolutionary biology perspective, why land created so much</p>
<p>diversity, but it did.</p>
<p>So like the sea, there&rsquo;s so much not known about the sea, about the oceans, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not, it&rsquo;s not diversity friendly.</p>
<p>What can I say?</p>
<p>It needs to improve its diversity.</p>
<p>Do you think the aliens would come, I mean, the first thing they would see is I suppose</p>
<p>our cities, assuming that they had some idea of what a natural world looked like, they</p>
<p>would see cities and say, these don&rsquo;t belong.</p>
<p>Which of these many species created these?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, if I were to guess, it would, it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you do this when you look at the telescope, whether you look at geometric</p>
<p>shapes.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s, cause to me like hard corners, like what do we think is engineered?</p>
<p>Things that are like, have kind of straight lines and corners and so on, they would probably</p>
<p>detect those in terms of buildings would stand out to them because that&rsquo;s, that goes against</p>
<p>the basic natural physics of the world.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if the electricity and lights and so on, it could be, I honestly, it could</p>
<p>be the plate tectonics.</p>
<p>It could be like, that they&rsquo;re like the volcanoes that&rsquo;d be okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a source of heat.</p>
<p>And then they would focus.</p>
<p>They might literally, I mean, depending on how alien life forms are, they might notice</p>
<p>the microorganisms before they notice the big, like notice the ant before the elephant.</p>
<p>Cause like there&rsquo;s a lot more of them depending what they&rsquo;re measuring.</p>
<p>We think like size matters, but maybe with their tools of measurement, they would look</p>
<p>for quantity versus size.</p>
<p>Like why focus on the big thing, focus on the thing that there&rsquo;s a lot of.</p>
<p>And when they see humans, depending on their measurement devices, they might see we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>made up of billions of organisms.</p>
<p>Like the fact that we have, we&rsquo;re very human.</p>
<p>We think we&rsquo;re one organism, but that may not be the case.</p>
<p>They might see, in fact, they may also see like a human city as one organism.</p>
<p>Like what is this thing that like, clearly this organism gets aroused at night because</p>
<p>the lights go on and then, and then it like, it sleeps during the day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how, like the, what perspective you take on the city.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting about earth or other planets in terms of weather patterns?</p>
<p>So we talked a lot about volcanic patterns.</p>
<p>Is there something else about weather that&rsquo;s interesting, like storms or variations in</p>
<p>temperature, all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s sort of every planet and moon has a kind of interesting and unique weather pattern.</p>
<p>And those weather patterns are really, we don&rsquo;t have a good understanding of them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even have a good understanding of the global circulation patterns of many of</p>
<p>these atmospheres, why the storm systems occur.</p>
<p>So the composition and occurrence of storms and clouds and these objects is another one</p>
<p>of these kind of windows into the interior that I was talking about with surfaces.</p>
<p>One of these ways that we can get perspective and what the composition is at the interior</p>
<p>and how the circulation is working.</p>
<p>So circulation will bring some species up from deeper in the atmosphere of the planet</p>
<p>to some altitude that&rsquo;s a little bit colder and that species will condense out and form</p>
<p>a cloud at that altitude.</p>
<p>And we can detect in some cases what those clouds are composed of.</p>
<p>But looking at where those occur can tell you how the circulation cells are, whether</p>
<p>the atmospheric circulation is, say, coming up at the equator and going down at the poles</p>
<p>or whether you have multiple cells in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And I mean, Jupiter&rsquo;s atmosphere is just insane.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much going on.</p>
<p>You look at these pictures and there&rsquo;s all these vortices and antivortices and you have</p>
<p>these different bands that are moving in opposite directions that may be giving you information</p>
<p>about the deep, like deep in the atmosphere, physically deep properties of Jupiter&rsquo;s interior</p>
<p>and circulation.</p>
<p>What are these vortices?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the basic material of the storms?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s condensed molecules from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So ammonia ice particles in the case of Jupiter, it&rsquo;s methane ice in the case of let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>Uranus and Neptune and other species, you can kind of construct a chemical model for</p>
<p>which species can condense where.</p>
<p>And so you see a cloud at a certain altitude within the atmosphere and you can make a guess</p>
<p>at what that cloud is made of and sometimes measure it directly and different species</p>
<p>make different colors as well.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Ice storms.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, the climate of Uranus has always been fascinating to me because it orbits on its</p>
<p>side and it has a 42 year orbital period.</p>
<p>And so, you know, with Earth, our seasons are because our equator is tipped just a little</p>
<p>bit to the plane that we orbit in.</p>
<p>So sometimes the sunlight&rsquo;s a little bit above the equator and sometimes it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>below the equator.</p>
<p>But on Uranus, it&rsquo;s like for 10 years, the sunlight is directly on the North Pole and</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s directly on the equator and then it&rsquo;s directly on the South Pole.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually kind of amazing that the atmosphere doesn&rsquo;t look crazier than it does.</p>
<p>But understanding how, taking again, like one of these extreme examples, if we can understand</p>
<p>why that atmosphere behaves in the way it does, it&rsquo;s kind of a test of our understanding</p>
<p>of how atmosphere is.</p>
<p>So like heats up one side of the planet for 10 years and then freezes it the next, like,</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re saying should probably lead to some chaos.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The fact that it doesn&rsquo;t tells you something about the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So atmospheres have a property that surfaces don&rsquo;t have, which is that they can redistribute</p>
<p>heat a lot more effectively.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So they have a stabilizing, like self regulating aspect to them that they&rsquo;re able to deal with</p>
<p>extreme conditions.</p>
<p>But predicting how that complex system unrolls is very difficult, as we know, about predicting</p>
<p>the weather on Earth even.</p>
<p>Oh, my goodness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even with the little variation we have on Earth.</p>
<p>You know, people have tried to put together global circulation models.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve done this for Earth.</p>
<p>People have tried to do these for other planets as well.</p>
<p>And it is a really hard problem.</p>
<p>So Titan, for example, like I said, it&rsquo;s one of the best studied atmospheres in the solar</p>
<p>system, and people have tried to make these global circulation models and actually predict</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen moving into sort of the next season of Titan.</p>
<p>And those predictions have ended up being wrong.</p>
<p>And so then, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s always exciting when a prediction is wrong</p>
<p>because it means that there&rsquo;s something more to learn, like your theory wasn&rsquo;t sufficient.</p>
<p>And then you get to go back and learn something by how you have to modify the theory to make</p>
<p>it fit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited by the possibility of one day there will be for various moons and planets,</p>
<p>there will be like news programs reporting the weather with the fake confidence of like</p>
<p>as if you can predict the weather.</p>
<p>We talked quite a bit about planets and moons.</p>
<p>Can we talk a little bit about asteroids?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>What is, what&rsquo;s an asteroid?</p>
<p>And what kind of asteroids are there?</p>
<p>So the asteroids, let&rsquo;s talk about just the restricted to the main asteroid belt, which</p>
<p>is the region, it&rsquo;s a region of debris basically between Mars and Jupiter.</p>
<p>And the, these sort of belts of debris throughout the solar system, the outer solar system,</p>
<p>you know, the Kuiper belt that we talked about, the asteroid belt, as well as certain other</p>
<p>populations where they accumulate because they&rsquo;re gravitationally more favored, are</p>
<p>remnant objects from the origin of the solar system.</p>
<p>And so one of the reasons that we are so interested in them, aside from potentially the fact that</p>
<p>they could come hit Earth, but scientifically it&rsquo;s, it gives us a window into understanding</p>
<p>the composition of the material from which Earth and the other planets formed and how</p>
<p>that material was kind of redistributed over the history of the solar system.</p>
<p>So the asteroids, one could classify them in two different ways.</p>
<p>Some of them are ancient objects.</p>
<p>So they accreted out of the sort of disc of material that the whole solar system formed</p>
<p>out of and have kind of remained ever since more or less the same.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve probably collided with each other and we see the, all these collisional fragments</p>
<p>and you can actually look and based on their orbits say, you know, like these 50 objects</p>
<p>originated as the same object.</p>
<p>You can see them kind of dynamically moving apart after some big collision.</p>
<p>And so some of them are these ancient objects maybe that have undergone collisions.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this other category of object that is the one that I personally find really</p>
<p>interesting which is remnants of objects that could have been planets.</p>
<p>So early on a bunch of potential planets accreted that we call planetesimals and they formed</p>
<p>and they formed with a lot of energy and they had enough time to actually differentiate.</p>
<p>So some of these objects differentiated into cores and mantles and crests.</p>
<p>And then they were subsequently disrupted in these massive collisions and they, now</p>
<p>we have these fragments, we think fragments floating around the asteroid belt that are</p>
<p>like bits of mantle, bits of core, bits of crest basically.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like puzzle pieces that you might be able to stitch together or I guess it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all mixed up so you can&rsquo;t stitch together the original planet candidates or is that</p>
<p>possible to try to see if they kind of, I mean, there&rsquo;s too many objects in there to.</p>
<p>I think that there are cases where people have kind of looked at objects and by looking</p>
<p>at their orbits, they say these objects should have originated together, but they have very</p>
<p>different compositions.</p>
<p>And so then you can hypothesize maybe they were different fragments of a differentiated</p>
<p>object.</p>
<p>But one of the really cool things about this is, you know, we&rsquo;ve been talking about getting</p>
<p>clues into the interiors of planets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never seen a planetary core or deep mantle directly.</p>
<p>Some mantle material comes up on our surface and then we can see it, but, you know, sort</p>
<p>of in bulk.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen these things directly and these asteroids potentially give us a chance</p>
<p>to like look at what our own core and mantle is like, or at least would be like if it had</p>
<p>been also floating through space for a few billion years and getting irradiated and all</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a cool potential window or like analogy into the interior of our own planet.</p>
<p>Well, how do you begin studying some of these asteroids?</p>
<p>What if you were to put together a study, like what are the interesting questions to</p>
<p>ask that are a little bit more specific?</p>
<p>Do you find a favorite asteroid that could be tracked and try to track it through telescopes?</p>
<p>Or do you, is it has to be, do you have to land on those things to study it?</p>
<p>So when it comes to the asteroids, there are so many of them and the big pictures or the</p>
<p>big questions are answered, so some questions can be answered by zooming in in detail on</p>
<p>individual object, but mostly you&rsquo;re trying to do a statistical study.</p>
<p>So you want to look at thousands of objects, even hundreds of thousands of objects and</p>
<p>figure out what their composition is and look at, you know, how many big asteroids there</p>
<p>are of this composition versus how many small asteroids of this other composition and put</p>
<p>together these kinds of statistical properties of the asteroid belt.</p>
<p>And those properties can be directly compared with the results of simulations for the formation</p>
<p>of the solar system.</p>
<p>What do we know about the surfaces of asteroids or the contents of the insides of asteroids</p>
<p>and what are still open questions?</p>
<p>So I would say that we don&rsquo;t know a whole lot about their compositions.</p>
<p>Most of them are small and so you can&rsquo;t study them in such detail with telescopes as you</p>
<p>could, you know, a planet or moon and at the same time, because there are so many of them,</p>
<p>you could send a spacecraft to a few, but you can&rsquo;t really like get a statistical survey</p>
<p>with spacecraft.</p>
<p>And so a lot of what we, a lot of what has been done comes down to sort of classification.</p>
<p>You look at how bright they are, you look at whether they&rsquo;re red or blue, simply, you</p>
<p>know, whether their spectrum is sloped towards long wavelengths or short wavelengths.</p>
<p>There are certain, if you point a spectrograph at their surfaces, there are certain features</p>
<p>you can see.</p>
<p>So you can tell that some of them have silicates on them.</p>
<p>But these are the sort of, they&rsquo;re pretty basic questions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still trying to classify them based on fairly basic information in kind of combination</p>
<p>with our general understanding of the material the solar system formed from.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re sort of, you&rsquo;re coming in with prior knowledge, which is that you more or</p>
<p>less know what the materials are the solar system formed from, and then you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to classify them into these categories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a huge amount of room for understanding them better and for understanding how their</p>
<p>surfaces are changing in the space environment.</p>
<p>Is it hard to land on an asteroid?</p>
<p>Is this a dumb question?</p>
<p>It feels like it would be quite difficult to actually operate a spacecraft in such a</p>
<p>dense field of debris.</p>
<p>Oh, the asteroid belt, there&rsquo;s a ton of material there, but it&rsquo;s actually not that dense.</p>
<p>It is mostly open space.</p>
<p>So mentally do picture like mostly open space with some rocks.</p>
<p>The problem is some of them are not thought to be solid.</p>
<p>So some of these asteroids, especially these, these core mantle fragments, you can think</p>
<p>of as sort of solid like a planet, but some of them are just kind of aggregates of material.</p>
<p>We call them rubble piles.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s not necessarily.</p>
<p>Might look like a rock, but do a lot of them have kind of clouds around them, like a dust</p>
<p>cloud thing, or like, do you know what you&rsquo;re stepping on when you try to land on it?</p>
<p>Like what are we supposed to be visualizing here?</p>
<p>This is like very few have water, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some water in the outer part of the asteroid belt, but they&rsquo;re not quite like</p>
<p>comets in the sense of having clouds around them.</p>
<p>There are some crazy asteroids that do become active like comets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole other category of thing that we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>But their surfaces, I mean, we have visited some, you can find pictures that spacecraft</p>
<p>have taken of them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually scooped up material off of the surface of some of these objects.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bringing it back to analyze it in the lab.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a mission that&rsquo;s launching next year to land on one of these supposedly core</p>
<p>fragment objects to try to figure out what the heck it is and what&rsquo;s going on with it.</p>
<p>But the surfaces, you know, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, you can picture a solid surface with some</p>
<p>little grains of sand or pebbles on it and occasional boulders, maybe some fine dusty</p>
<p>regions, dust kind of collecting in certain places.</p>
<p>Is there this, do you worry about this?</p>
<p>Is there any chance that one of these fellas destroys all of human civilization by an asteroid</p>
<p>kind of colliding with something, changing its trajectory and then heading its way towards</p>
<p>earth?</p>
<p>That is definitely possible.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t even have to necessarily collide with something and change its trajectory.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not tracking all of them.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t track all of them yet.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s still a lot of them.</p>
<p>People are, people are tracking a lot of them and we are doing our best to track more of</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of them out there and it would be potentially catastrophic if one</p>
<p>of them impacted earth.</p>
<p>Have you, are you aware of this Apophis object?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an asteroid, a near earth object called Apophis that people thought had a decent</p>
<p>probability of hitting earth in 2029 and then potentially again in 2036.</p>
<p>So they did a lot of studies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually going to hit earth, but it is going to come very close.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be visible in the sky in a relatively dark, I mean, not even that dark, probably</p>
<p>not visible from Los Angeles, but, and it&rsquo;s going to come a 10th of the way between the</p>
<p>earth and the moon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to come closer apparently than some geosynchronous communication satellites.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>So that is a close call, but people have studied it and apparently are very confident it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not actually going to hit us, but it was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to look into this because I&rsquo;m very sure, I&rsquo;m very sure what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen if an asteroid actually hits earth.</p>
<p>That the scientific community and government will confidently say that, uh, we have nothing</p>
<p>to worry about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a close call.</p>
<p>And then last minute they&rsquo;ll be like, there was a miscalculation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not lying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the space of possibilities, because it&rsquo;s very difficult to track these</p>
<p>kinds of things and there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of, um, there&rsquo;s complexities involved in this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainties that I just, something tells me that human civilization</p>
<p>will end with, we&rsquo;ll see it coming.</p>
<p>And then last minute there&rsquo;ll be a, oops, we&rsquo;ll like, we&rsquo;ll see it coming and we&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be like, no, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just threatening, but no problem.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>And last minute it&rsquo;ll be like, oops, that was a miscalculation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all over in a matter of like a week, or just very positive and optimistic today.</p>
<p>Is there any chance that Bruce Willis can save us in the sense that from what you know</p>
<p>about asteroids, is there something that, um, you can catch them early enough to, uh,</p>
<p>change volcanic, uh, eruptions, right, um, sort of drill, put a nuclear weapon inside</p>
<p>and break up the asteroid or change its trajectory?</p>
<p>There is potential for that.</p>
<p>If you catch it early enough in advance, um, I think in theory, if you knew five years</p>
<p>in advance, um, depending on the objects and how close, how much you would need to deflect</p>
<p>it, um, you could deflect it a little bit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it would be sufficient in all cases.</p>
<p>Um, and this is definitely not my specific area of expertise, but my understanding is</p>
<p>that there is something you could do.</p>
<p>Um, but it also, how you would carry that out depends a lot on the properties of the</p>
<p>asteroid.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a solid object versus a rubble pile.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you planted some bomb in the middle of it and it blew up, but it was just</p>
<p>kind of a pile of material anyway.</p>
<p>And then that material comes back together and then you kind of just have the same thing.</p>
<p>Presumably its trajectory would be altered, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like a terminator too.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s like the thing that just like you shoot it in splashes and then comes back together</p>
<p>will be very useless.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It was fascinating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of hope from watching, uh, uh, SpaceX rockets that land.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Oh wow.</p>
<p>From an AI perspective, from a robotics perspective, wow, we can do a hell of an amazing job with</p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>And but then we have an understanding about surfaces here on earth, we can map up a lot</p>
<p>of things.</p>
<p>I wonder if we can do that.</p>
<p>Some kind of detail of being able to have that same level of precision in landing on</p>
<p>surfaces with as wide of a variety as asteroids have to be able to understand the exact properties</p>
<p>of the surface and be able to encode that into whatever rocket that lands sufficiently</p>
<p>to, I presume humans, unlike the, unlike the movies, humans would likely get in the way.</p>
<p>Like it should all be done by robots and like land drill, place the, the explosive that</p>
<p>should all be done through control, the robots.</p>
<p>And then you should be able to dynamically adjust to, um, to the surface.</p>
<p>The flip side of that for a robotics person, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen these, it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>very heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Uh, somebody I know well, Russ Tedrick at MIT led the DARPA robotics challenge team for</p>
<p>the humanoid robot challenge for DARPA.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen videos of robots on two feet falling, but you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>millions, you know, several years of work from with some of the most brilliant roboticists</p>
<p>in the world, millions of dollars.</p>
<p>And the final thing is a highlight video on YouTube of robots falling, but they had a</p>
<p>lot of trouble with uneven surfaces.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what you have to do with, uh, the challenge involves you&rsquo;re mostly autonomous</p>
<p>with some partial human communication, but that human communication is broken up.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t get a, you get a noisy channel, so you can, humans can, which is very similar</p>
<p>to what it would be like in humans remotely operating a thing on an asteroid.</p>
<p>And so with that, robots really struggled.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some hilarious painful videos of like a robot, not able to like open the door.</p>
<p>And then it tries to open the door without like, it misses the handle and in doing so</p>
<p>like falls, I mean, it&rsquo;s, um, it&rsquo;s painful to watch.</p>
<p>So like that, there&rsquo;s that, and then there&rsquo;s SpaceX.</p>
<p>So I have hope from SpaceX and then I have less hope from bipedal robotics, um, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to kind of imagine.</p>
<p>And I think the planetary side of it comes into play in understanding the surfaces of</p>
<p>these asteroids more and more that, you know, forget sort of destruction of human civilization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be cool to have like spacecraft just landing on all these asteroids to study them</p>
<p>at scale and being able to figure out dynamically what, you know, whether it&rsquo;s a rubble pile</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s, um, a solid objects, like, do you see that kind of future of science?</p>
<p>Maybe a hundred, 200, 300 years from now, where there&rsquo;s just robots expanding out through</p>
<p>the solar system, like sensors, essentially.</p>
<p>Some of it taking pictures from a distance, some of them landing, just exploring and giving</p>
<p>us data.</p>
<p>Cause it feels like we&rsquo;re working with very little data right now.</p>
<p>Sure I, I do see exploration going that way.</p>
<p>I think, um, the way that NASA is currently or historically has been doing missions is</p>
<p>putting together these, these really large missions that do a lot of things and are extremely</p>
<p>well tested and have a very low rate of failure.</p>
<p>But now that, um, these sort of CubeSat technologies are, are becoming easier to build, easier</p>
<p>to launch, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re very cheap.</p>
<p>And you know, NASA is getting involved in this as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in these missions that are relatively small, relatively</p>
<p>cheap and just do one thing.</p>
<p>So you can really optimize it to just do this one thing.</p>
<p>And maybe you could build a hundred of them and send them to different asteroids.</p>
<p>And they would just collect this one piece of information from each asteroid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of different, more distributed way of doing science, I guess.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a ton of potential there, I agree.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about objects or one particular object from outside our solar system.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get to study many of these, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t get stuff that just flies in out of nowhere from outside the solar system</p>
<p>and flies through.</p>
<p>Apparently there&rsquo;s been two recently in the past few years.</p>
<p>One of them is Amuamua.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Amuamua?</p>
<p>So fun to say.</p>
<p>Could it, could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization or is it just a weird shaped</p>
<p>comet?</p>
<p>I like the way that&rsquo;s phrased.</p>
<p>Um, so Amuamua is, is a fascinating object.</p>
<p>Just the fact that we have started discovering things that are coming in from outside our</p>
<p>solar system is amazing and can, can start to study them.</p>
<p>And now that we have seen some, we can design now kind of thinking in advance.</p>
<p>The next time we see one, we will be much more ready for it.</p>
<p>We will know which telescopes we want to point at it.</p>
<p>We will have explored whether we could even launch a fast turnaround mission to actually</p>
<p>like get to it before it leaves the solar system.</p>
<p>In terms of Amuamua, yeah, it&rsquo;s, for an object in our solar system, it&rsquo;s really unusual in</p>
<p>two particular ways.</p>
<p>One is the dimensions that we don&rsquo;t see natural things in our solar system that are kind of</p>
<p>long and skinny.</p>
<p>We see, the things we see in our solar system don&rsquo;t deviate from spherical by that much.</p>
<p>And then that it showed these strange properties of accelerating as it was leaving the solar</p>
<p>system, which was not understood at first.</p>
<p>So in terms of the alien space junk, you know, as a scientist, I cannot rule out that possibility.</p>
<p>I have no evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Um, however,</p>
<p>See, you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a chance.</p>
<p>I cannot, I cannot, as a scientist, honestly say that I can rule out that it&rsquo;s alien space</p>
<p>junk.</p>
<p>However, I see the kind of alien explanation as following this, the Sagan&rsquo;s extraordinary</p>
<p>claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>If you are going to actually claim that something is aliens, you need to carefully evaluate,</p>
<p>everyone needs to carefully evaluate the other options and see whether it could just be something</p>
<p>that we know exists that makes sense.</p>
<p>In the case of Oumuamua, there are explanations that fit well within our understanding of</p>
<p>how things work.</p>
<p>So there are a couple, there are two hypotheses for what it could be made of.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both basically just ice shards.</p>
<p>In one case, it&rsquo;s a nitrogen ice shard that came off of something like Pluto in another</p>
<p>solar system, that Pluto got hit with something and broke up into pieces, and one of those</p>
<p>pieces came through our solar system.</p>
<p>In the other scenario, it&rsquo;s a bit of a failed solar system.</p>
<p>So our solar system formed out of a collapsing molecular cloud.</p>
<p>Sometimes those molecular clouds are not massive enough, and they sort of collapse into bits,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t actually form a solar system, but you end up with these kind of chunks of</p>
<p>hydrogen ice, apparently.</p>
<p>And so one of those chunks of hydrogen ice could have got ejected and passed through</p>
<p>our solar system.</p>
<p>So both cases explain these properties in about the same way.</p>
<p>So those ices will sublimate once they&rsquo;ve passed the sun, and so as they&rsquo;re moving away</p>
<p>from the sun, you have the hydrogen or nitrogen ice sublimating off the sunward part of it,</p>
<p>and so that is responsible for the acceleration.</p>
<p>The shape also, because you have all this ice sublimating off the surface, if you take</p>
<p>something, the analogy that works pretty well here is for a bar of soap.</p>
<p>Your bar of soap starts out sort of close to spherical, at least from a physicist perspective,</p>
<p>and as you use it over time, you eventually end up with this long, thin shard because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been just by sort of weathering, as we would call it.</p>
<p>And so in the same way, if you just sublimate material off of one of these ice shards, it</p>
<p>ends up long and thin, and it ends up accelerating out of the solar system.</p>
<p>And so given that these properties can be reasonably well explained that way, we should</p>
<p>be extremely skeptical about attributing things to aliens.</p>
<p>See, the reason I like to think that it&rsquo;s aliens is because it puts a lot of priority</p>
<p>on us not being lazy and we need to catch this thing next time it comes around.</p>
<p>I like the idea that there&rsquo;s objects, it almost saddens me, they come out of the darkness</p>
<p>really fast and just fly by and go and leave.</p>
<p>It just seems like a wasted opportunity not to study them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the easiest way to do space travel outside of the solar system is having the things come</p>
<p>to us.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I like that way of putting it.</p>
<p>And it would be nice to just land on it.</p>
<p>And first of all, really importantly, detect it early and then land on it with a really</p>
<p>nice spacecraft and study the hell out of it.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a chance it&rsquo;s aliens, alien life, it just feels like such a cheap way, inexpensive</p>
<p>way to get information about alien life or something interesting that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure if an ice shard from another planetary system will be interesting, but</p>
<p>it very well could be.</p>
<p>It could be totally new sets of materials.</p>
<p>It could be, tell us about composition of planets we don&rsquo;t quite understand.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just nice when, especially in the case of a Moa Moa, I guess it was pretty</p>
<p>close to earth.</p>
<p>It would have been nice to, don&rsquo;t go there, they come to us, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes me quite sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>And whether you think it&rsquo;s aliens or not, it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity, but we weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prepared and we will be prepared for the next ones.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been a movement in astronomy more towards what&rsquo;s called time domain astronomy.</p>
<p>So kind of monitoring the whole sky all the time at all wavelengths.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the goal.</p>
<p>And so we expect to detect many more of these in the future, even though these were the</p>
<p>first two we saw, our potential to detect them is only increasing with time.</p>
<p>And so there will be more opportunities and based on these two, we now can actually sit</p>
<p>and think about what we&rsquo;ll do when the next one shows up.</p>
<p>I also, what it made me realize, I know I didn&rsquo;t really think through this, but it made</p>
<p>me realize if there is alien civilizations out there, the thing we&rsquo;re most likely to</p>
<p>see first would be space junk.</p>
<p>My stupid understanding of it.</p>
<p>And the second would be really dumb kind of, you could think of maybe like relay nodes</p>
<p>or something objects that you need to have a whole lot of for particular purposes of</p>
<p>like space travel and so on.</p>
<p>Like a speed limit signs or something, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever we have on earth, a lot of</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not alien aliens in themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like artifacts that are useful to the engineering in the systems that are engineered</p>
<p>by alien civilizations.</p>
<p>So like it would, we would see a lot of stuff in terms of setting, in terms of looking for</p>
<p>alien life and trying to communicate with it.</p>
<p>Maybe we should be looking not for like smart creatures or systems to communicate with.</p>
<p>Maybe we should be looking for artifacts or even as dumb as like space junk.</p>
<p>It just kind of reframed my perspective of like, what are we looking for as signs?</p>
<p>Cause there could be a lot of stuff that doesn&rsquo;t have intelligence, but gives us really strong</p>
<p>signs that there&rsquo;s somewhere is life or intelligent life.</p>
<p>And yeah, that made me kind of, I know it might be dumb to say, but reframe the kind</p>
<p>of thing that we should be looking for.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the benefit of looking for intelligent life is that we perhaps have a better chance</p>
<p>of recognizing it.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t necessarily recognize what an alien stop sign look like.</p>
<p>And maybe the theorists are the people who sort of model and try to understand slow system</p>
<p>objects are pretty good at coming up with models for anything.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe a mua mua was a stop sign, but we&rsquo;re clever enough that we could come up</p>
<p>with some physical explanations for it.</p>
<p>And then we all want to go with the simplest possible, we all want to believe the sort</p>
<p>of most skeptical possible explanation.</p>
<p>And so we missed it because we&rsquo;re too good at coming up with alternate explanations for</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such an outlier, such a rare phenomenon that we can&rsquo;t study a hundred or a thousand</p>
<p>of these objects.</p>
<p>We have to, we had just one.</p>
<p>And so the science almost destroys the possibility of something special being there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Johnny Ive, this designer of Apple, I don&rsquo;t know if you know who that is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the lead designer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the person who designed the iPhone and all the major things.</p>
<p>And he talked about, he&rsquo;s brilliant, one of my favorite humans on earth and one of the</p>
<p>best designers in the history of earth.</p>
<p>He talked about like when he had this origins of an idea, like in his baby stages, he would</p>
<p>not tell Steve Jobs because Steve would usually like trample all over it.</p>
<p>He would say, this is a dumb idea.</p>
<p>And so I sometimes think of the scientific community in that sense, because the weapon</p>
<p>of the scientific method is so strong at its best that it sometimes crushes the out of</p>
<p>the box outlier evidence.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get a lot of that evidence because we don&rsquo;t have, we&rsquo;re not lucky enough to have</p>
<p>a lot of evidence.</p>
<p>So we have to deal with just special cases and special cases could present an inkling</p>
<p>of something much bigger, but the scientific method user tramples all over it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to know what to do with that because the scientific method works, but at</p>
<p>the same time, every once in a while, it&rsquo;s like a balance.</p>
<p>You have to do 99% of the time, you have to do like scientific rigor, but every once in</p>
<p>a while, this is not you saying, me saying, smoke some weed and sit back and think, I</p>
<p>wonder, you know, it&rsquo;s the Joe Rogan thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely possible that it&rsquo;s alien space junk.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>And I think that most scientists do speculate about these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just at what point do you act on those things?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right that the scientific method has inherent skepticism, and for the most</p>
<p>part, that&rsquo;s a good thing because it means that we&rsquo;re not just believing crazy things</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an interesting point that requiring that high level of rigor occasionally means</p>
<p>that you will miss something that is truly interesting because you needed to verify it</p>
<p>three times and it wasn&rsquo;t verifiable.</p>
<p>I also think like when you communicate with the general public, I think there&rsquo;s power</p>
<p>in that 1% speculation of just demonstrating authenticity as a human being, as a curious</p>
<p>human being.</p>
<p>I think too often, I think this is changing, but I saw, I&rsquo;ve been quite disappointed in</p>
<p>my colleagues throughout 2020 with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much speaking from authority as opposed to speaking from curiosity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some of the most incredible science has been done in 2020, especially on the virology</p>
<p>biology side.</p>
<p>And the kind of being talked down to by scientists is always really disappointing to me as opposed</p>
<p>to inspiring.</p>
<p>Like the things we, there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty about the coronavirus, but we know a lot of</p>
<p>this stuff and we speak from scientists from various disciplines, speak from data in the</p>
<p>face of that uncertainty.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re curious, we don&rsquo;t know what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if this virus is going to evolve, mutate.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if this virus or the next one might destroy all human civilization.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t speak with certainty.</p>
<p>In fact, I was on a survey paper about masks, something I don&rsquo;t talk much about because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like politics, but we don&rsquo;t know if masks work, but there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence</p>
<p>to show that they work for this particular virus.</p>
<p>The transmission of the virus is fascinating actually.</p>
<p>The biomechanics of the way viruses spread is fascinating.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t destructive, it would be beautiful.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s inspiring to apply the scientific method to the best of our ability,</p>
<p>but also to show that you don&rsquo;t always know everything and to, perhaps not about the virus</p>
<p>as much, but other things speculate.</p>
<p>What if, you know, what if it&rsquo;s the worst case and the best case?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s ultimately what we are, descendants of apes that are just curious about the world</p>
<p>around us.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll just add to that, not on the topic of masks, but on the topic of curiosity.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s, astronomy and planetary sciences, a field are a little, are unique</p>
<p>because for better and for worse, they don&rsquo;t directly impact humanity.</p>
<p>So you know, we&rsquo;re not studying virology to prevent transmission of, you know, illness</p>
<p>amongst humans.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not characterizing volcanoes on earth that could destroy cities.</p>
<p>We, it really is a more curious and in my opinion, playful scientific field than many.</p>
<p>So for better and worse, we can kind of afford to pursue some of the speculation more because</p>
<p>human lives are not in danger if we speculate a little bit too freely and get something</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>In the space of AI, I am worried that we&rsquo;re sometimes too eager, speaking for myself,</p>
<p>to like flip the switch to on just to see like what happens.</p>
<p>Maybe sometimes we want to be a little bit careful about that because bad things might</p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p>Is there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that were inspiring, had an</p>
<p>impact on you that you would recommend?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So many that I just don&rsquo;t know where to start with it.</p>
<p>So I love reading.</p>
<p>I read obsessively.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading fiction and a little bit of nonfiction, but mostly fiction obsessively</p>
<p>since I was a child and just never stopped.</p>
<p>So I have some favorite books.</p>
<p>None of them are easy readings.</p>
<p>So I definitely, I mean, I recommend them for somebody who likes an intellectual challenge</p>
<p>in the books that they read.</p>
<p>So maybe I should go chronologically.</p>
<p>I have at least three.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go through 50 here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d love to also like maybe ideas that you took away from what you mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why they were so compelling to me.</p>
<p>One of the first books that really captured my fascination was Nabokov&rsquo;s book Pale Fire.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with it?</p>
<p>So I read it actually for a class.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the few books I&rsquo;ve ever read for a class that I actually really liked.</p>
<p>And the book is, it&rsquo;s in some sense a puzzle.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brilliant writer, of course, but the book is like, it&rsquo;s formatted like a poem.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an introduction, a very long poem and footnotes, and you get partway through</p>
<p>it before realizing that the whole thing is actually a novel, unless you sort of read</p>
<p>up on it going in.</p>
<p>But the whole thing is a novel and there&rsquo;s a story that slowly reveals itself over the</p>
<p>course of all of this and kind of reveals this just fascinating character basically</p>
<p>and how his mind works in this story.</p>
<p>The idea of a novel also being a kind of intellectual puzzle and something that slowly reveals itself</p>
<p>over the course of reading was really fascinating to me and I have since found a lot more writers</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>In a contemporary example that comes to mind is Kazuo Ishiguro, who&rsquo;s pretty much all of</p>
<p>his books are like slow reveals over the course of the book and like nothing much happens</p>
<p>in the books, but you keep reading them because you just want to know like what the reality</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s slowly revealing to you.</p>
<p>The kind of discovery oriented reading maybe.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the second one?</p>
<p>Perhaps my favorite writer is Renier Maria Rilke.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with him?</p>
<p>No, also not familiar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hitting hidden ones.</p>
<p>I mean, I know in the book of Well, but I&rsquo;ve never read Pale Fire, but Rilke, I&rsquo;ve never,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a very difficult read, I know that much.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>All of these are difficult reads.</p>
<p>I think I just, I read for in part for an intellectual challenge, but Rilke, so he wrote</p>
<p>one thing that might be characterizable as a novel, but he wrote a lot of poetry.</p>
<p>I mean, he wrote this series of poems called the Duino Elegies that were very impactful</p>
<p>for me personally, just emotionally, which actually it kind of ties in with astronomy</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s a sense in which we&rsquo;re all going through our lives alone and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just this sense of profound loneliness in the existence of every individual human.</p>
<p>I think I was drawn to astronomy in part because the sort of vast spaces, the kind of loneliness</p>
<p>and desolateness of space made the sort of internal loneliness feel okay.</p>
<p>In a sense, it like gave companionship and that&rsquo;s how I feel about Rilke&rsquo;s poetry.</p>
<p>He turns the kind of desolation and loneliness of human existence into something joyful and</p>
<p>almost meaningful.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something about melancholy, I don&rsquo;t know about Rilke in general, but like</p>
<p>contemplating the melancholy nature of the human condition that makes it okay.</p>
<p>I got gentle from an engineering perspective, think that there is so much loneliness we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t explored within ourselves yet and that&rsquo;s my hope is to build AI systems that</p>
<p>help us explore our own loneliness.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of what love is and friendship is, is somebody who in a very small way helps</p>
<p>us explore our own loneliness, like they listen, we connect like two lonely creatures connect</p>
<p>for a time and it&rsquo;s like, oh, like acknowledge that we exist together for a brief time, but</p>
<p>in a somewhat shallow way, I think relative to how much it&rsquo;s possible to truly connect</p>
<p>as two consciousnesses.</p>
<p>So AI might be able to help on that front.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the third one?</p>
<p>Actually, you know, I hadn&rsquo;t realized until this moment, but it&rsquo;s yet another one of these</p>
<p>kind of slow reveal books.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a contemporary Russian, I think Russian American writer named Olga Grushin and she</p>
<p>wrote this just phenomenal book called The Dream Life of Sukhanov that I read this year.</p>
<p>Maybe it was last year for the first time and it&rsquo;s just a really beautiful, this one</p>
<p>you could call a character study, I think of a Russian father coming to terms with himself</p>
<p>and his own past as he potentially slowly loses his mind.</p>
<p>Slow reveal.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s apparent from the beginning.</p>
<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a spoiler.</p>
<p>Decline into madness.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert.</p>
<p>So all of these are really heavy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t have anything lighter to recommend.</p>
<p>Ishiguro is the light version of this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, heavy has a certain kind of beauty to it in itself.</p>
<p>Is there advice you would give to a young person today that looks up to the stars and</p>
<p>wonders what the heck they want to do with their life?</p>
<p>So career, science, life in general, you&rsquo;ve for now chosen a certain kind of path of curiosity.</p>
<p>What insights do you draw from that that you can give us advice to others?</p>
<p>I think for somebody, I would not presume to speak to giving people advice on life and</p>
<p>humanity overall, but for somebody thinking of being a scientist.</p>
<p>So there are a couple of things, one sort of practical thing, which is career wise,</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t appreciated this going into science, but you need to, so the questions you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>on and the techniques you use are both of very high importance, maybe equal importance</p>
<p>for being happy in your career.</p>
<p>If there are questions you&rsquo;re interested in, but the techniques that you need to use to</p>
<p>do them are tedious for you, then your job is going to be miserable even if the questions</p>
<p>are inspiring.</p>
<p>So you have to find, but if the techniques that you use are things that excite you, then</p>
<p>your job is fun every day.</p>
<p>So for me, I&rsquo;m fascinated by the solar system and I love telescopes and I love doing data</p>
<p>analysis, playing with data from telescopes, coming up with new ways to use telescopes</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s where I have found that mesh.</p>
<p>But if I was interested in, you know, the dynamical evolution of the solar system, how</p>
<p>the orbits of things evolve, then I would need to do a different type of work that I</p>
<p>would just not find as appealing and so it just wouldn&rsquo;t be a good fit.</p>
<p>And so it sort of seems like an unromantic thing to have to think about the techniques</p>
<p>being the thing you want to work on also, but it really makes a profound difference</p>
<p>for I think your happiness and your scientific career.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really profound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the thing, the menial tasks.</p>
<p>If you enjoy those, that&rsquo;s a really good sign that that&rsquo;s the right path for you.</p>
<p>I think David Foster Wallace said that the key to life is to be unborable.</p>
<p>So basically everything should be exciting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s feasible, but you should find an area where everything is exciting.</p>
<p>I mean, depending on the day, but you could find the joy in everything, not just the big</p>
<p>exciting things that everyone thinks is exciting, but the details, the repetitive stuff, the</p>
<p>menial stuff, the stuff that takes years, the stuff that involves a lot of failure and</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that you find that enjoyable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually really profound to focus on that because people talk about like dreams</p>
<p>and passion and goals and so on, the big thing, but that&rsquo;s not actually what takes you there.</p>
<p>What takes you there is every single day, putting in the hours, and that&rsquo;s what actually</p>
<p>makes up life is the boring bits.</p>
<p>If the boring bits aren&rsquo;t boring, then that&rsquo;s an exciting life because when you were talking</p>
<p>so romantically and passionately about IO, I remember the poem by Robert Frost.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, let me read the poem and ask what your opinion is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called Fire and Ice.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I could almost recite this from memory.</p>
<p>Some say the world will end in fire.</p>
<p>Some say in ice.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire.</p>
<p>But if I had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate to say that for destruction</p>
<p>ice is also great and would suffice.</p>
<p>So let me ask, if you had to only choose one, would you choose the world to end in fire,</p>
<p>in volcanic eruptions, in heat and magma, or in ice, frozen over?</p>
<p>Fire or ice?</p>
<p>Fire.</p>
<p>Excellent choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of chaos and the idea of things just slowly getting cold and stopping</p>
<p>and dying is just so depressing to me.</p>
<p>So much more depressing than things blowing up or burning or getting covered by a lava</p>
<p>flow.</p>
<p>Somehow the activity of it endows it with more meaning to me, maybe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just now had this vision of you in action films where you&rsquo;re walking away without looking</p>
<p>back and this explosion&rsquo;s behind you and you put on shades and then it goes to credits.</p>
<p>Catherine, this is awesome, I think your work is really inspiring.</p>
<p>The kind of things we&rsquo;ll discover about planets in the next few decades is super cool and</p>
<p>I hope, I know you said there&rsquo;s probably not life in one of them, but there might be and</p>
<p>I hope we discover just that.</p>
<p>And perhaps even on Io, within the volcanic eruptions, there&rsquo;s a little creature hanging</p>
<p>on that we&rsquo;ll one day discover.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for wasting all your valuable time with me today, it was really awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, likewise, thank you for having me here.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Catherine Duclear and thank you to Fundrise,</p>
<p>Blinkist, ExpressVPN and Magic Spoon.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>On Titan, the molecules that have been raining down like mana from heaven for the last four</p>
<p>billion years might still be there, largely unaltered, deep frozen, awaiting for the chemists</p>
<p>from Earth.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
