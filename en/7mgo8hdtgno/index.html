Byrd I want so much for</p><p>all the videos that you&rsquo;ve created I</p><p>love sitting at my desk and watching</p><p>them oh my question today is about the</p><p>digestate and the gall bladder formula I</p><p>know that I had stomach issues because</p><p>when I first started using the tool on</p><p>my neck I thought my herniated disc had</p><p>flared up and then I read your book and</p><p>it said that sometimes and few occasions</p><p>if you have stomach problems you&rsquo;d have</p><p>problems with the tool so I started</p><p>watching all your videos on digestion</p><p>and on one of the videos that mentioned</p><p>the colostrum the l-glutamine and the</p><p>probiotic so I did that for a month and</p><p>finished all of the colostrum half a day</p><p>out glutamate and then I tried the tool</p><p>again and I&rsquo;m able to use it without any</p><p>problems so I thought everything was</p><p>fine but I&rsquo;m noticing that I still have</p><p>brittle nails and hair I have some dry</p><p>spots above my eyelids dry skin so that</p><p>means I feel like I&rsquo;m still not</p><p>digesting well mm-hmm so when I make my</p><p>shake at about 2:00 o&rsquo;clock I take three</p><p>of the digestate</p><p>I know that it&rsquo;s going to be probably an</p><p>hour before I eat my meat and vegetables</p><p>so once I finish the shake I go ahead</p><p>and take to gallbladder formulas and</p><p>then before I start my meat and</p><p>vegetables I take another three of the</p><p>digest aids and then after the meat and</p><p>vegetables to gallbladder formulas okay</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was maybe taking too</p><p>much not taking enough I mean is there</p><p>can you take too much of a good thing</p><p>yeah good question so let&rsquo;s just answer</p><p>that so she&rsquo;s talking about using the</p><p>massage tool on your neck okay a lot of</p><p>times when you&rsquo;re working on your neck</p><p>it might actually aggravate the neck if</p><p>there&rsquo;s a gallbladder issue because</p><p>there&rsquo;s a little nerve that causes the</p><p>referred pain into your neck so really</p><p>there&rsquo;s not any problem in the neck it&rsquo;s</p><p>coming from somewhere else so if you&rsquo;re</p><p>working on the neck and not the cause it</p><p>won&rsquo;t get better it can aggravate the</p><p>area so so she&rsquo;s trying to fix the</p><p>digestion which it&rsquo;s starting to work</p><p>but there&rsquo;s two things one is that</p><p>digests formula which satisfies the</p><p>stomach and then the gallbladder formula</p><p>which helps you get more bile here&rsquo;s the</p><p>thing really you only need to digest</p><p>plus when you&rsquo;re doing protein not a</p><p>kale shake okay so you can do it right</p><p>before you eat the big protein meal okay</p><p>so do the digest plugs right before and</p><p>some people need to some people need</p><p>five my guitar teacher said that when he</p><p>had nine he can eat go to five guys and</p><p>that was defeating the purpose so I told</p><p>them not to do that but the point is</p><p>just helps you digest and some people it</p><p>takes a while for it to build up because</p><p>you&rsquo;re not like drink you&rsquo;re not</p><p>consuming battery acid you&rsquo;re just</p><p>you&rsquo;re just slowly building up the acid</p><p>over a period of you know weeks or even</p><p>months so it&rsquo;s gradual so you may not</p><p>known the change by the way now the</p><p>gallbladder formula is should only be</p><p>taken right after the meal and you</p><p>really don&rsquo;t need much so if you&rsquo;re you</p><p>just need one and if you don&rsquo;t see quick</p><p>change it just means it just it&rsquo;s gonna</p><p>take some time on that but you should</p><p>notice a better skin</p><p>better absorption of fats have a vitamin</p><p>so the vision will be better but the</p><p>thing is that what I would do is a</p><p>combination of just keep that in there</p><p>keep the digest plus before the meal and</p><p>then the gallbladder after and just keep</p><p>it in for a period of you know time and</p><p>then start working on the intermittent</p><p>fasting so you&rsquo;re doing two meals a day</p><p>that are a little bit closer and I think</p><p>just with time that&rsquo;s going to improve</p><p>so that&rsquo;s what I would do if I were you</p><p>but great question thank you let&rsquo;s go to</p><p>zachary been waiting for fifty minutes</p><p>from missouri you had a question you&rsquo;re</p><p>a type 1 diabetic right yes sir okay hi</p><p>dr. Berglas my mom is calling before and</p><p>express that we all love your videos we</p><p>feel like we know you and everything</p><p>thank you very much for everything you</p><p>do let me get right with my main</p><p>question here I called in with the</p><p>question about the adrenals and</p><p>wondering if it&rsquo;s more key to my house</p><p>and I realized it&rsquo;s type 1 diabetes</p><p>familiy mmm that it produces anti</p><p>inflammatory hormones I also have an</p><p>addition to that and that is I am having</p><p>trouble absorbing potassium nutrients</p><p>because you know they are transporting</p><p>themselves with insulin I&rsquo;m having to</p><p>take insulin to be able to absorb any</p><p>kind of passing or anything is there any</p><p>kind of way around that so where I don&rsquo;t</p><p>have to take the insulin or something</p><p>you know and still get those nutrients</p><p>in yeah good question really good</p><p>question yeah you&rsquo;re smart because</p><p>you&rsquo;re actually supporting the adrenals</p><p>which will take the stress off the</p><p>pancreas take the stress off insulin</p><p>because that&rsquo;s always kind of a factor</p><p>now here&rsquo;s the thing with the type 1 the</p><p>diet should be pretty much the same as</p><p>if you have type 2 the goal for you is</p><p>to take the minimal amount of insulin</p><p>possible and out of all the things you</p><p>can do the greatest thing you can do is</p><p>basically doing in a minute fasting with</p><p>diabetes type 1 because think about it</p><p>what we&rsquo;re trying to do is minimize the</p><p>need for insulin but every time you ate</p><p>it raised it okay so of course you&rsquo;re</p><p>cutting out the carbs you&rsquo;re doing keto</p><p>and that&rsquo;s great</p><p>but in a minute fasting is gonna be pry</p><p>be even more powerful and to the point</p><p>where you don&rsquo;t have to raise insulin as</p><p>much the other factor that you want to</p><p>focus on is the type of insulin that</p><p>you&rsquo;re taking because unfortunately 99%</p><p>of all the instant sold in America is</p><p>from 3 companies and it&rsquo;s all GMO which</p><p>I don&rsquo;t like so if you could find a</p><p>better quality insulin that would be the</p><p>ideal scene I don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna find it I have no idea but that</p><p>would be better and then just see if</p><p>that doesn&rsquo;t help you greatly now as far</p><p>as the potassium goes believe it or not</p><p>taking more potassium will actually</p><p>improve your absorption it actually</p><p>helps insulin resistance because what&rsquo;s</p><p>happening now</p><p>you might have a combination of of</p><p>diabetes type 1 and insulin resistance</p><p>at the same time because of the insulin</p><p>you&rsquo;re taking is creating insulin</p><p>resistance so what you&rsquo;re trying to</p><p>solve I think is insulin resistance and</p><p>the way to do that is to take even more</p><p>potassium you might have to take like</p><p>five thousand even six thousand a day to</p><p>cram it and nothing there to actually</p><p>start kicking it in but on one of my</p><p>videos I talked about other things you</p><p>can do to increase your improvements and</p><p>resistance vitamin D omega-3 fatty acids</p><p>sulfur o faint from all the</p><p>phytonutrients from the vegetables b1</p><p>really important in trician alii so use</p><p>the nutrition to actually improve it and</p><p>then once it improves the absorption</p><p>will go up as well so but I would you</p><p>know if your type one you probably going</p><p>to have to work towards a doing like one</p><p>meal a day eventually okay thanks for</p><p>your question Zack alright let&rsquo;s go to</p><p>the Soddy Adi do we have any questions</p><p>yet yes yes we do we have a lot okay but</p><p>before I start there&rsquo;s a lot of</p><p>greetings from around the world we have</p><p>India Japan Canada Chicago Puerto Rico</p><p>Chile Brazil Spain New Zealand Wow York</p><p>Virginia and Baltimore awesome yes</p><p>so the first question</p><p>from YouTube and he in is asking</p><p>basically she&rsquo;s not feeling thirsty</p><p>while doing keto shouldn&rsquo;t be the other</p><p>way around</p><p>or what do you think well that&rsquo;s a good</p><p>question because when you&rsquo;re a diabetic</p><p>you&rsquo;re more thirsty because your body&rsquo;s</p><p>trying to dilute the sugar by increasing</p><p>more fluid and more pink okay so when</p><p>you do on keto you&rsquo;re no longer focusing</p><p>on replenishing and focusing on trying</p><p>to build up this glycogen reserve which</p><p>means you&rsquo;re gonna dump a lot of fluid</p><p>and the need for fluid will go down yeah</p><p>so that&rsquo;s fine but again you know make</p><p>sure you you drink somewhat a some</p><p>liquids through the day especially if</p><p>you&rsquo;re prone to kidney stones but don&rsquo;t</p><p>ever force yourself to drink more than</p><p>when you&rsquo;re thirsty for okay okay all</p><p>right good so do we have another</p><p>question yes now going to Facebook</p><p>LaShonda is asking is keto okay for</p><p>people with heart failure congestive</p><p>heart failure well I do the video on</p><p>that it&rsquo;s actually for people with heart</p><p>problems the number one killer on planet</p><p>earth right now the number one death is</p><p>heart disease and yeah so the best thing</p><p>you can do is in is to help improve your</p><p>insulin levels your blood sugar levels</p><p>because that creates inflammation in the</p><p>arteries so by doing ketone and then</p><p>fasting you&rsquo;re dropping inflammation all</p><p>over the place and you&rsquo;re gonna start</p><p>healing up the the internal tissues</p><p>there&rsquo;s four main tissues that are going</p><p>to be improved when you do kita one is</p><p>the vision number two is the nerve and</p><p>your brain three is the kidney and four</p><p>is the arteries because with the high</p><p>sugar it makes the artery stiff and</p><p>Harden so we can actually make them more</p><p>elastic if we get off this sugar okay is</p><p>that a good answer yes good one more</p><p>question oh okay so YouTube pH is asking</p><p>a spam safe for a keto diet spam spam</p><p>Oh spam right that&rsquo;s a good question</p><p>yeah when you go to the dollar store in</p><p>America you see these little</p><p>can meets spam that&rsquo;s are you talking</p><p>about</p><p>yes yeah Wow that&rsquo;s college food right</p><p>there that is so so bad I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s</p><p>first of all meat in a can</p><p>I mean there&rsquo;s no shelf life there&rsquo;s</p><p>probably not a lot of nutrients in there</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do it it&rsquo;s kind of a mystery</p><p>meat yeah okay just don&rsquo;t do it</p><p>so because you brought up spam yeah so</p><p>what I&rsquo;m gonna ask I&rsquo;m gonna ask the</p><p>first question okay first question of</p><p>the day there&rsquo;s three questions guys so</p><p>you got a sticker on for the whole whole</p><p>time until we get all these questions</p><p>but the first question is what&rsquo;s going</p><p>to trigger insulin more number one going</p><p>consuming low-fat lean protein or higher</p><p>fat protein okay I type in your answer</p><p>right now what&rsquo;s going to trigger</p><p>insulin more low fat lean protein or</p><p>higher fat protein let me know what you</p><p>think see if you&rsquo;ve been watching my</p><p>videos okay so okay so while people are</p><p>answering that question we&rsquo;re gonna go</p><p>right to Debbie from upstate New York</p><p>you had a question about smoking good</p><p>morning good morning of yours appreciate</p><p>your videos um I have watched your</p><p>videos on smoking and I have the three</p><p>sorry I&rsquo;m losing what I&rsquo;m trying to say</p><p>I have the three supplements that you</p><p>recommended I take them in the morning</p><p>and I do notice a difference but you</p><p>never quite go into like what would be a</p><p>good way to transition after the</p><p>cigarette yeah I was wondering if you</p><p>could elaborate a little more on it and</p><p>then I have a quick question on you&rsquo;re</p><p>sleeping okay which is I take it and I</p><p>sleep really well which I&rsquo;m assuming</p><p>because I&rsquo;m a light sleeper and I</p><p>usually notice the time going by at</p><p>night I don&rsquo;t with this stuff so I&rsquo;m</p><p>assuming that it&rsquo;s working very well the</p><p>only other thing is I get warm and cold</p><p>flashes at night you&rsquo;re what I&rsquo;m</p><p>wondering if it&rsquo;s warm and cold flashes</p><p>warm and cold light like that it wakes</p><p>me up yeah</p><p>and I&rsquo;m wondering if that goes away if</p><p>that&rsquo;s normal</p><p>oh ok ok good so the first question is</p><p>smoking of course I&rsquo;m an expert at</p><p>smoking no I&rsquo;m just kidding I&rsquo;m not an</p><p>expert</p><p>I never inhaled any time even in college</p><p>so here&rsquo;s the thing about smoking once</p><p>you start oh my gosh it&rsquo;s really highly</p><p>addictive so some people can go cold</p><p>turkey and come off if they have good</p><p>adrenals it&rsquo;s fine other people do it</p><p>gradually but the point is that I think</p><p>even worse than the nicotine is that all</p><p>this smoke stuff in there so you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to do some organic cigarettes</p><p>and which is least harmful because I</p><p>mean I mean less harmful because there&rsquo;s</p><p>less chemicals coming in and then I</p><p>would honestly start the the the patch</p><p>it&rsquo;s a nicotine patch I would do that</p><p>for a while that&rsquo;s actually better and</p><p>think about it that&rsquo;s this this nicotine</p><p>is calming the adrenals down so you want</p><p>to support the adrenals at the same time</p><p>as you go less and less and less and</p><p>less and lessen to the point where you</p><p>don&rsquo;t need it anymore but it really has</p><p>to do with neurotransmitters so your</p><p>neurotransmitters are are messed up</p><p>right now so you have to reestablish</p><p>those so a lot of B vitamins a lot of</p><p>nutritional yeast is going to be very</p><p>important as you transition off this</p><p>until eventually you don&rsquo;t need it so</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I would recommend people</p><p>that have addictions to anything need to</p><p>keep really really really busy and then</p><p>really kind of take a look at why why</p><p>you&rsquo;re smoking in the first place</p><p>usually people smoke to relax so they</p><p>can breathe better which doesn&rsquo;t make</p><p>sense but when they start smoking it</p><p>pays to dilate the arteries it calms</p><p>down the nerve so you could find</p><p>something else that does the same thing</p><p>and I I think the my adrenal knife for</p><p>my adrenal day formula what&rsquo;s which is</p><p>called adrenal cortisol support works</p><p>really good for that because it actually</p><p>gives you some instant release and</p><p>relaxation and then of course the</p><p>massage tool so that&rsquo;s what I would</p><p>recommend for that and then you ask the</p><p>next question you get these cold and hot</p><p>flashes if it&rsquo;s triggered by the night</p><p>formula usually that will go away over a</p><p>period of time but it could also mean</p><p>that it it&rsquo;s kind of supporting or</p><p>activating the adrenals a little bit</p><p>more in a way that you may need to do</p><p>something else called the estrogen</p><p>balance formula</p><p>with dim because especially if it&rsquo;s more</p><p>like a hot flash that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s for</p><p>so you might want to look at that</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re going through</p><p>menopause I&rsquo;m not sure if you are in</p><p>fact I don&rsquo;t even know if you&rsquo;re 20</p><p>years old or 30 years old I have no idea</p><p>okay</p><p>thanks Debbie all right so we&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>go right to Derek from New York go ahead</p><p>Derek hey dr. burr good morning how are</p><p>you good</p><p>dr. Berg do you remember my situation I</p><p>I kind of call you every week yeah yes I</p><p>do remember digestive issues and</p><p>everything mm-hmm gotcha</p><p>dr. Berg now I&rsquo;m experiencing I guess I</p><p>would call it diabetic neuropathy where</p><p>the the hair on my legs basically from</p><p>my ankle a little bit above my ankle to</p><p>a little bit below my knee the hair is</p><p>just gone and I&rsquo;m feeling burning</p><p>stinging and itching sensations now on</p><p>my lower leg and it travels all around</p><p>my body as well okay you told me to take</p><p>benfotiamine which I have in grapeseed</p><p>extract</p><p>I do take your gall bladder formula as</p><p>well and I did have my glucose level and</p><p>I just checked my blood work from</p><p>September it was actually 103 end of</p><p>September then beginning of December it</p><p>was at 102 and then two weeks later at</p><p>one but it went to 96 so I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p><p>eat I&rsquo;m not a I&rsquo;m not someone who ever</p><p>had a sweet tooth diabetes doesn&rsquo;t run</p><p>in my family</p><p>I don&rsquo;t eat junk I don&rsquo;t eat fast food I</p><p>don&rsquo;t eat sweets over the past two weeks</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been craving sweets actually okay</p><p>yeah okay so here&rsquo;s what you need to do</p><p>Derek you ready for this yeah are you</p><p>sitting down yeah okay good so sounds</p><p>like you got two things going on the</p><p>peripheral neuropathy is definitely</p><p>related to higher sugar or higher</p><p>instant</p><p>now the fact that you crave sweets means</p><p>there&rsquo;s something going on with the</p><p>blood sugar so here&rsquo;s the interesting</p><p>thing Derek that I wanted to tell you</p><p>and everyone else way before the high</p><p>sugar there&rsquo;s high insulin I would love</p><p>for you to actually get a test with your</p><p>insulin test do a fasting insulin and</p><p>then a post meal insulin test that would</p><p>give you the full picture because I</p><p>think there&rsquo;s high insulin that still</p><p>not bring coming down because you can</p><p>have high insulin because of the height</p><p>and because of the insulin resistance</p><p>the blood sugars don&rsquo;t go out of control</p><p>so if you&rsquo;re evaluating everything on</p><p>the blood sugars you&rsquo;re gonna miss like</p><p>a big picture of what&rsquo;s going on deeper</p><p>because the fact you have died bruh</p><p>diabetic neuropathy tells us that there</p><p>must be high insulin so you with high</p><p>insulin you have all the side effects</p><p>but normal sugars why because you have</p><p>insulin resistance until that fat cell</p><p>becomes so big and so congested it</p><p>spills off into the liver the pancreas</p><p>clogs everything up and then you start</p><p>getting high blood sugar so that&rsquo;s</p><p>probably what&rsquo;s happening right now so</p><p>you want to continue what you&rsquo;re doing</p><p>increase the been phone to mean maybe</p><p>add some alpha lipoic acid which is</p><p>another thing for peripheral neuropathy</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I would recommend the other</p><p>last thing I want to mention is the hair</p><p>that&rsquo;s falling off your lower legs</p><p>that&rsquo;s probably not related to</p><p>peripheral neuropathy that is related to</p><p>high levels of estrogen a lot of men</p><p>have that the estrogen in the</p><p>environment starts going up and then the</p><p>testosterone goes down and it burns out</p><p>that the the hair follicles so it&rsquo;s</p><p>estrogen that&rsquo;s what you need to maybe</p><p>clean up by cutting off the soy milk no</p><p>I&rsquo;m just kidding I know you don&rsquo;t do</p><p>that but if you do cruciferous</p><p>vegetables more of those that actually</p><p>would help you so you can balance this</p><p>out okay but so the fact that you&rsquo;re</p><p>going from 103 down the 96 is a good</p><p>indicator that it&rsquo;s working but it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna take some more time alright now</p><p>we&rsquo;re gonna go right to day what are</p><p>people answering with this this question</p><p>here alright so we have 90 percent of</p><p>people or actually more saying low-fat</p><p>lean protein okay okay drumroll please</p><p>the answer is to the question what</p><p>triggers more insulin they&rsquo;re correct</p><p>it&rsquo;s low fat lean proteins trigger</p><p>higher amounts of insulin Wow</p><p>you guys are smart you&rsquo;ve been watching</p><p>my videos I just want to show you</p><p>something I brought this from my house</p><p>this is a summer sausage okay this is</p><p>from the us wellness meats I love this</p><p>company because it&rsquo;s grass-fed</p><p>grass-finished and there&rsquo;s no nitrates</p><p>no sugar Celtic sea salt spices and</p><p>garlic powder can orders online do a</p><p>search but it&rsquo;s pretty cool stuff I love</p><p>it sounds like I&rsquo;m doing a commercial</p><p>but I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m just telling you I also</p><p>bought their hamburger that they have</p><p>55% which is 45 percent fat and 55</p><p>percent protein so I&rsquo;ve never seen it at</p><p>the grocery store so it&rsquo;s like the</p><p>fattiest hamburger you&rsquo;ve ever had in</p><p>your life so you put that on the grill</p><p>it&rsquo;s over but I like this because this</p><p>is higher fat so we want higher fat</p><p>meats we don&rsquo;t want the low fat turkey</p><p>bacon we don&rsquo;t want the the chicken</p><p>without the skin it&rsquo;s too lean</p><p>we want the fattier stuff because we&rsquo;ll</p><p>keep insulin check again the exact</p><p>opposite what you&rsquo;ve been taught so all</p><p>right so let&rsquo;s go right to Megan had a</p><p>question go ahead Megan hi dr. Berg how</p><p>are you good how are you good good I</p><p>have two questions I&rsquo;ve been doing your</p><p>way of life pretty consistently since</p><p>November the only reason why I say</p><p>pretty consistently is because sometimes</p><p>I&rsquo;ll fall off but I get right back on I</p><p>love how I feel I haven&rsquo;t really lost</p><p>any weight but I&rsquo;ve been patient with it</p><p>because I&rsquo;ve been tweaking and it seems</p><p>like it took me a long time to get my</p><p>insulin resistance and check now I&rsquo;m to</p><p>the point where I do one meal a day and</p><p>my biggest issue are getting my</p><p>vegetables and I don&rsquo;t have a problem</p><p>with eating vegetables I actually like</p><p>them the issue is I don&rsquo;t bloat or</p><p>anything</p><p>that but as soon as I eat I thought it</p><p>was just cruciferous it&rsquo;s not pretty</p><p>much anything green will constipate me</p><p>and I won&rsquo;t go for a couple of days so</p><p>that counterproductive to my weight loss</p><p>because I only have nine pounds left to</p><p>go I&rsquo;ve got my my stress under control I</p><p>have my estrogen issues under control</p><p>I&rsquo;m taking your cruciferous supplement</p><p>six pills a day and I&rsquo;m doing apple</p><p>cider vinegar three times a day so but</p><p>I&rsquo;m concerned about my liver you know</p><p>for the future I feel great when I don&rsquo;t</p><p>eat veggies but I know that&rsquo;s not ideal</p><p>so that&rsquo;s my first issue and then my</p><p>other question would be I used ionic</p><p>foot baths once a month I have for years</p><p>it helps keep my sciatic nerve you know</p><p>not you I don&rsquo;t have any pain with it</p><p>and also I feel better internally</p><p>cleansed with what comes out of my you</p><p>know my cleanse with it I wanted to ask</p><p>you your opinion on that as far as</p><p>implementing that with this way of life</p><p>ketogenic and helping with liver and</p><p>hormones and my gallbladder okay great</p><p>well I think that ionic foot bath is a</p><p>great thing I would keep doing that</p><p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>now chances are if it&rsquo;s you the weights</p><p>not coming off as fast and but you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting improvements it tells me that</p><p>you probably had insulin resistance</p><p>pretty deep in your body and so</p><p>interesting when you have a there&rsquo;s a</p><p>huge connection between insulin insulin</p><p>resistance high sugar and your flora in</p><p>your gut because if you get worse with</p><p>vegetables simply that means you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have the enzymes you know because you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have the microbes in your gut to</p><p>be able to deal with these microbes so</p><p>if you don&rsquo;t have the microbes you&rsquo;re</p><p>not going to be able to fully break this</p><p>thing down because the microbes live on</p><p>the on the fiber so I think what you</p><p>might want to think about doing is</p><p>getting a some type of probiotic right</p><p>now to build up your flora because even</p><p>alone will speed up insulin resistance</p><p>and actually or not speed ups will</p><p>improve it to a degree that there&rsquo;s even</p><p>people that work on the gut and improve</p><p>diabetes so it&rsquo;s just something to look</p><p>at something the research because then</p><p>you&rsquo;ll start developing the microbes so</p><p>you can have the enzymes to break down</p><p>the vegetables now what we want from the</p><p>vegetables is the fiber but if it&rsquo;s</p><p>constipating you&rsquo;re just kind of</p><p>overloading the microbes so I would do</p><p>maybe some steamed vegetables see if</p><p>that is okay and then the next thing I</p><p>would try is fermented vegetables and</p><p>then there is some other viewpoints out</p><p>there that you can also experiment on</p><p>because at the other day we want the</p><p>nutrients from the vegetables right and</p><p>we don&rsquo;t want to constipate you so there</p><p>is some viewpoints that you can get a</p><p>lot of these nutrients from organ meats</p><p>and even animal products so that&rsquo;s</p><p>something else you can research but</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing if you&rsquo;re consuming</p><p>these animal products and no vegetables</p><p>and you&rsquo;re going you&rsquo;re eliminating and</p><p>then you add vegetables and you&rsquo;re</p><p>constipated obviously we don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>continue that because that&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>bad so some people do a lot better</p><p>without too many vegetables as long as</p><p>you&rsquo;re getting your nutrients that&rsquo;s all</p><p>I care about</p><p>personally I found that when I started</p><p>consume when I was having my low-fat</p><p>diet I was doing grains and all that I</p><p>started adding more saturated fats from</p><p>animal products my bowel started going</p><p>really perfectly so and it wasn&rsquo;t the</p><p>fact I thought like we need fiber to go</p><p>but that&rsquo;s really not always it so try</p><p>those things and see if that can help</p><p>you but definitely try the fermented</p><p>okay and hey guys I want to just mention</p><p>I wanted to mention something let me</p><p>just figure out okay so I have a new</p><p>download this is called keto essentials</p><p>click down below if you want it this is</p><p>pretty cool it tells you all the foods</p><p>that you should focus on what type of</p><p>carbs

the</p><p>download click down below now and get</p><p>your key dough essentials download okay</p><p>so that&rsquo;s the giveaway for today</p><p>now we&rsquo;re gonna go right to Audie for</p><p>the next question alright so on YouTube</p><p>we have Pam asking is there an age</p><p>restriction to keto intimate fasting did</p><p>you find a hold cheese</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t you gotta find out because it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna be a little less than what you</p><p>said yeah so it&rsquo;s age restrictive if</p><p>you&rsquo;re over the age of 45 you shouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>be doing keto because then you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>get too healthy now there is no age</p><p>limit absolutely no age limit at all in</p><p>fact the older you get the more you want</p><p>to do it because it&rsquo;s healthy it&rsquo;s anti</p><p>aging it&rsquo;s gonna help extend your life</p><p>especially at a minute fasting and</p><p>cutting out the sugar okay okay great</p><p>good yeah next question</p><p>okay so I have Leah on Facebook and she</p><p>I know you went over a gallbladder but</p><p>she&rsquo;s asking if she doesn&rsquo;t have one</p><p>does she still need to take the formula</p><p>then you&rsquo;re good to go if you don&rsquo;t have</p><p>one then you really don&rsquo;t need to worry</p><p>about it right sure no you need a gall</p><p>blood if you don&rsquo;t have a gall bladder</p><p>then what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;re you have</p><p>this severe reduction of bile so</p><p>therefore you&rsquo;re gonna have a reduction</p><p>of the absorption of fat soluble</p><p>vitamins it might not show up because</p><p>fat soluble vitamins are stored in your</p><p>fat and your liver and you have a lot</p><p>that can be sitting there for a period</p><p>of months and months but eventually you</p><p>could you could show signs of vitamin A</p><p>D and K two deficiencies so I&rsquo;m gonna</p><p>recommend you know take a little bile</p><p>extract there&rsquo;s something I have co</p><p>gallbladder formula that you can take</p><p>just take like one after the meal maybe</p><p>every day or every other day just to</p><p>make sure you&rsquo;re getting that file in</p><p>there to start pulling in a better</p><p>absorption of that type of vitamins</p><p>without a gallbladder your reduction</p><p>goes down by 50% so you&rsquo;re still</p><p>producing bile from the liver but it&rsquo;s</p><p>not being stored in constant</p><p>in the gallbladder so gallbladder is</p><p>stored like by 20x the concentration so</p><p>think about that you don&rsquo;t have that</p><p>super concentration and is this</p><p>trickling down are you really going to</p><p>get your full digestion no so that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s that answer good say did you have</p><p>another question I do all right</p><p>Barbara on YouTube is asking how can one</p><p>obtain calcium and keto and intimate</p><p>passing well most people are taking too</p><p>much calcium so the best thing to do or</p><p>calcium is get it from the food and you</p><p>can get it from leafy greens you can get</p><p>it from like grass-fed like cheese</p><p>like grass-fed cows that cows that eat</p><p>cheese that then make the make the</p><p>cheese</p><p>so make the milk that then actually</p><p>turns into cheese but the point is that</p><p>that&rsquo;s where I would recommend you</p><p>getting your calcium if you&rsquo;re sensitive</p><p>to Dairy then get it from the vegetables</p><p>but make sure you&rsquo;re not taking a lot of</p><p>calcium these people that are going to</p><p>GNC and getting this very poorly</p><p>absorbed calcium carbonate which</p><p>basically is limestone you&rsquo;d be better</p><p>off chewing on the cement outside Bobby</p><p>because they&rsquo;re like taking these huge</p><p>heavy pills and by the way if you have a</p><p>multivitamin that you take and it weighs</p><p>heavier than a paper weight then chances</p><p>are it has calcium carbonate rocks in</p><p>there and that&rsquo;s probably gonna be the</p><p>first ingredient and you&rsquo;re taking rocks</p><p>as your stuff iment and it&rsquo;s not going</p><p>to really absorb that well so it&rsquo;s great</p><p>if you want to plaque up your arteries</p><p>but other than that I don&rsquo;t wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>recommend it okay thank you</p><p>good so let&rsquo;s go to Maria she&rsquo;s been</p><p>waiting for just under one hour</p><p>Maria go ahead you&rsquo;re from Chicago yes</p><p>yes thank you doctor I&rsquo;m calling for my</p><p>daughter my daughter she has type 1</p><p>diabetes to use insulin 50 units and</p><p>also now she had she&rsquo;s low in iron</p><p>she got an Amy she only got four</p><p>or sin then also vitamin D H is deficit</p><p>okay you know she&rsquo;s an Italian a keto</p><p>diet since last October to only lose six</p><p>pounds but uh she want to know what you</p><p>recommend for her is she in a minute</p><p>fasting yes okay how many meals a day</p><p>cool - okay all right so here&rsquo;s the</p><p>thing Maria a couple things I&rsquo;m gonna</p><p>recommend when you&rsquo;re type 1 diabetic</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more severe you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have the insulin so then you have to</p><p>take insulin the problem is the taking</p><p>influence so we want to get a situation</p><p>when you take the least not possible so</p><p>you might want to recommend for your</p><p>daughter to go on like one meal a day I</p><p>think that&rsquo;s where she needs to go but</p><p>the other thing is if she&rsquo;s anemic</p><p>usually she needs more stomach acid so</p><p>if you were to recommend you the upside</p><p>of vinegar or taking the pill or maybe</p><p>betaine how to chloride that will then</p><p>acidify the stomach allow her to absorb</p><p>the minerals much much better and then</p><p>one of the best sources of iron is of</p><p>red meat honestly or even liver that</p><p>would give her enough you can even will</p><p>liverwurst if you go to the US wellness</p><p>meets to have this liverwurst that&rsquo;s</p><p>actually pretty healthy it&rsquo;s grass-fed</p><p>it&rsquo;s hard to find high quality</p><p>liverwurst but anyway that way you&rsquo;ll</p><p>get the vitamin D as well but I think</p><p>that&rsquo;s the thing if she&rsquo;s low in vitamin</p><p>D that usually related to lacking a bile</p><p>so she might benefit from some gall</p><p>bladder formula to help her with that</p><p>but I would I would push for like one</p><p>meal a day and then you&rsquo;ll find things</p><p>start really changing I think diabetics</p><p>type one if they can gradually work to</p><p>one meal a day and it&rsquo;s really nutrient</p><p>dense but they&rsquo;re gonna have to enhance</p><p>their diet because that you really need</p><p>the nutrients I think you&rsquo;ll see the</p><p>most changes the other thing you want to</p><p>research is the stem-cell stuff I mean</p><p>it&rsquo;s amazing the new stem-cell stuff</p><p>they can do for diabetes and kind of</p><p>regrow</p><p>the cells that produce insulin I think</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I would do if I were a</p><p>diabetic type 1 but thanks for the</p><p>question hey guys just want to let you</p><p>know that we&rsquo;re finally on to nin.com so</p><p>you could if you&rsquo;re driving your car</p><p>you&rsquo;re you can have your cell phone you</p><p>can hear me it&rsquo;s like a radio type thing</p><p>you can pull up dr. Berg listen to the</p><p>latest live shows and just you know that</p><p>way it&rsquo;s not like a video you can listen</p><p>anywhere ok and we are also an anchor</p><p>that app as well okay all right so now</p><p>we&rsquo;re gonna go to Keith from Toronto go</p><p>ahead Keith hi dr. bird hi are you good</p><p>um quickly I guess I&rsquo;ve been on the keto</p><p>diet eh I found you about a month ago</p><p>and I was experiencing a lot of the</p><p>problems that you described as a trainer</p><p>problems so I&rsquo;ve been rectifying all of</p><p>those issues I&rsquo;m still having problems</p><p>so I&rsquo;ve lost eight pounds in about three</p><p>weeks and which which I found so easy</p><p>now to stay on this the intermittent</p><p>fasting but I still feel that in the</p><p>morning I don&rsquo;t wake up as bright and</p><p>there&rsquo;s cheery as I as I end up being in</p><p>the afternoon right okay have you ever</p><p>tried coffee before no I&rsquo;m just kidding</p><p>so let me yeah I have that I have that</p><p>t-shirt too</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing that you usually if</p><p>you&rsquo;re waking up not bright and I think</p><p>you you started off telling me exactly</p><p>where the issue is the adrenal is the</p><p>key for the quality of sleep if that</p><p>adrenal is like kicked in a little too</p><p>much higher cortisol it won&rsquo;t let you</p><p>get into the full relaxed state I&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna recommend this torture I mean</p><p>treatment device that I have which is a</p><p>massage tool that you use on a different</p><p>parts of your body to extract stress an</p><p>average person goes through a lot of</p><p>stress in their life and all that stress</p><p>accumulates like a sponge and when you</p><p>go to sleep at night you lay there and</p><p>there</p><p>could be certain parts of your body that</p><p>are kind of more energetic or just that</p><p>won&rsquo;t turn off so I use this for that</p><p>purpose to take every part of your body</p><p>and just turn it off so it&rsquo;s not like</p><p>you know energetic and then you can get</p><p>into a deeper sleep and then you&rsquo;ll</p><p>start to recharge better and better and</p><p>better so the key with sleep is to be</p><p>able to recover and turn off verses kind</p><p>of stuck in a state of stress because</p><p>that&rsquo;s what it does and it keeps you</p><p>kind of revved up all the time and you</p><p>wake up kind of feeling grout groggy so</p><p>I have an adrenal formula you might even</p><p>be taking now I use that every night</p><p>before we go to sleep to support</p><p>nutritionally but I would use this as</p><p>another tool to take your sleep to the</p><p>next level there&rsquo;s nothing better than a</p><p>good night&rsquo;s sleep we wake up feeling</p><p>refreshed and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s worth it to</p><p>focus on that because then the whole</p><p>days like you&rsquo;re bright you&rsquo;re creative</p><p>you&rsquo;re mentally energetic okay so that&rsquo;s</p><p>what I&rsquo;m going to that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p><p>recommending and I&rsquo;m sticking to it</p><p>okay good so Adi give me another</p><p>question okay so have Monique on</p><p>Facebook and she&rsquo;s asking how often</p><p>should you be working out on keto well</p><p>Monique that&rsquo;s a very unique question</p><p>you should you should work out depending</p><p>it really depends on your level of</p><p>fitness in your age if you&rsquo;re my age</p><p>you&rsquo;re probably working out two times a</p><p>week is plenty but on the days that I</p><p>don&rsquo;t work out our core is I I do my</p><p>bike or I&rsquo;ll do some walking and things</p><p>like that but I like two times a week</p><p>for the average person if you&rsquo;re younger</p><p>maybe three times a week if you&rsquo;re</p><p>really fit a little bit more but always</p><p>give yourself a chance to recover make</p><p>sure that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re still sore or</p><p>you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s interfering with your sleep</p><p>or you&rsquo;re a little tired</p><p>don&rsquo;t push it because you&rsquo;re gonna over</p><p>train and stop your progress</p><p>I had this Adi I don&rsquo;t know if you</p><p>remember this this patient who came in</p><p>she was working out six hours a day I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if you remember that lady six</p><p>hours a day okay every day that was a</p><p>little bit much I told him Gina to cut</p><p>down to at least not like five hours a</p><p>day yeah and now</p><p>like freaking her out so I just wanted</p><p>to kind of slowly kind of bring her down</p><p>because she wasn&rsquo;t losing any weight</p><p>she was completely overtraining she was</p><p>in her 50s but it just wasn&rsquo;t working so</p><p>I never I never knew what happened to</p><p>him but I would recommend to cut it back</p><p>because what really produces the results</p><p>with exercise is the recovery part so</p><p>you want to stress the body and then let</p><p>it recover and let it heal that&rsquo;s where</p><p>you get the benefits okay do you have</p><p>any other questions yes I do</p><p>I have Marilla on YouTube and he&rsquo;s</p><p>asking if he&rsquo;s doing intermittent</p><p>fasting could that cause thyroid</p><p>problems okay so here&rsquo;s a common</p><p>question I did a video on this as well</p><p>if you do intimate fasting and you</p><p>really cut your calories down too much</p><p>it&rsquo;s really about the calories in the</p><p>lack of nutrients that can weaken the</p><p>thyroid but if you keep your meals nice</p><p>and large and they&rsquo;re healthy it will</p><p>not affect the thyroid okay good good so</p><p>I&rsquo;m ready for another question oh okay</p><p>[Music]</p><p>I have Wanda on Facebook and she&rsquo;s</p><p>asking what&rsquo;s the best way to get</p><p>started on keto okay Wanda what you need</p><p>to do is I have a mini course okay it&rsquo;s</p><p>on my website under education tab it</p><p>says how to do ketosis click that</p><p>there&rsquo;s three videos they may they may</p><p>be five minutes each so watch them and</p><p>you&rsquo;ll get the basics of how to do keto</p><p>okay but in a thumbnail sketch here&rsquo;s</p><p>the thing if you want to do keto</p><p>obviously you want to try to burn fat</p><p>right</p><p>very few people know how to burn fat but</p><p>there&rsquo;s three things about the fat cell</p><p>you need to know number one fat is</p><p>controlled by hormones okay I&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about the fat burning or the fat storing</p><p>excuse me and what happens is when</p><p>there&rsquo;s a little enzyme enzymes of</p><p>little little things that make things</p><p>work in the body the there&rsquo;s a certain</p><p>enzyme that causes the fat to be burnt</p><p>okay if you wanted to know this aadhi</p><p>the name of that is called hormones</p><p>sensitive lipase like Lippo meaning fat</p><p>and ace meaning enzyme so there&rsquo;s an</p><p>enzyme that helps you dissolve fat right</p><p>so then the question is how do you</p><p>activate this enzyme you want to know</p><p>yes well this kind of brings me to the</p><p>last question here that I was going to</p><p>ask everyone right before we end off so</p><p>I guess I&rsquo;m left I have to answer this</p><p>now okay so before I give you the answer</p><p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask everyone how do you</p><p>trigger the enzyme that burns fat what</p><p>is the main trigger okay go ahead and</p><p>answer it below see if you guys can</p><p>answer this and then I&rsquo;ll come we&rsquo;ll</p><p>come back all right okay now I&rsquo;m gonna</p><p>go right to Rhonda you had a question</p><p>you&rsquo;re from Ontario</p><p>go ahead Rhonda yes good

program</p><p>for 17 months now and I had gone to my</p><p>doctor I was very very sick</p><p>and she told me I had this unbelievable</p><p>eating a rash on my stomach that I</p><p>almost scratched my

cholesterol sleeping pills</p><p>metformin because my doctor told me that</p><p>I was going to have a heart attack or a</p><p>stroke due to the fact that</p><p>being a diabetic is reason why I had all</p><p>this itching and my brain wasn&rsquo;t good I</p><p>also have been on medication and I&rsquo;m off</p><p>that too is for the co D and of course I</p><p>drank red wine every day so this

Burke um I have a couple</p><p>actually my first one is my daughter was</p><p>32 is going to be having gastric bypass</p><p>in couple months and she also suffers</p><p>from gallstones so there&rsquo;s a possibility</p><p>they&rsquo;re going to remove her gallbladder</p><p>so I was going to recommend this</p><p>lifestyle to her and I was wondering</p><p>what you think about her doing the keto</p><p>and</p><p>interesting after her gastric bypass my</p><p>second question is I have issues with</p><p>dizzy spells and lightheadedness because</p><p>my blood pressure tends to run low and</p><p>recently I&rsquo;ve realized that my sugar</p><p>levels kind of draw found out when I was</p><p>in the ER and they tested my blood sugar</p><p>and it was it was quite low so they had</p><p>to give me two cups of apple juice to</p><p>get it up right and it tends to happen</p><p>in the morning so if I&rsquo;m doing the</p><p>intermittent fasting and going as far as</p><p>12 before eating my first meal how do I</p><p>go about trying to not having the dizzy</p><p>spells and lightheadedness doing this</p><p>lifestyle ubicool it&rsquo;s a great question</p><p>there is a video on this of course so</p><p>let me just give you the summary of the</p><p>video that&rsquo;s out there and this is I</p><p>think under a hypoglycemia what happens</p><p>to is when you have high insulin like</p><p>this is the common theme of today right</p><p>high insulin think about what insulin is</p><p>it lowers blood sugars so it&rsquo;s gonna</p><p>lower your blood Sugar&rsquo;s if your</p><p>adrenals are strong that will counter</p><p>that and keep the sugars somewhat high</p><p>so it sounds to me like your adrenals</p><p>need some support that&rsquo;s one thing so</p><p>that&rsquo;s and look looks at some of my</p><p>videos of how to do that okay the other</p><p>thing is that you&rsquo;re on the right track</p><p>with your intermittent fasting and</p><p>you&rsquo;re in your keto lifestyle because</p><p>eventually that&rsquo;s gonna actually help</p><p>you you may also want to increase your</p><p>salt intake I think that&rsquo;s going to help</p><p>you but and then the last thing you want</p><p>to improve is your liver function so</p><p>there&rsquo;s a couple things dandelion greens</p><p>as in a salad would be good or even milk</p><p>thistle will be really good because then</p><p>that will help you support the liver and</p><p>help release the glycogen more of an 11</p><p>leveled area so it&rsquo;s not too out of</p><p>balance in the mornings when you wake up</p><p>now some people have wake up with a high</p><p>sugar you&rsquo;re waking it with low sugar</p><p>but still you want to support the liver</p><p>so there could be a fatty liver going on</p><p>in the background that&rsquo;s keeping</p><p>you from keeping the normal blood sugars</p><p>so that&rsquo;s another factor but I would</p><p>start with your adrenals and I think</p><p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;ll solve your problem now</p><p>with your daughter what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p><p>they&rsquo;re gonna do gastric bypass if she&rsquo;s</p><p>totally convinced to doing this then and</p><p>she&rsquo;s unwilling to change her mind about</p><p>it I would totally recommend keto in a</p><p>minute fasting the reason for that is</p><p>that she&rsquo;s gonna have a smaller surface</p><p>area for her digestion so there&rsquo;s going</p><p>to be complications of of just</p><p>absorption of nutrients so when she does</p><p>in a minute fasting that actually aligns</p><p>with someone that doesn&rsquo;t have that full</p><p>strength of digestion because now we&rsquo;re</p><p>not traumatizing by eating so frequently</p><p>so that&rsquo;s one thing also when you do</p><p>less meals the need for nutrients goes</p><p>down so you have you body starts</p><p>recycling the nutrients that has</p><p>especially the proteins so you don&rsquo;t</p><p>need the calories like you did before so</p><p>that&rsquo;s gonna be really cool the only</p><p>thing I would recommend is the trace</p><p>minerals for her and probably some</p><p>digestive support because that&rsquo;s the</p><p>thing that a lot of people that have</p><p>that procedure they don&rsquo;t get enough</p><p>trace minerals from the food so there&rsquo;s</p><p>a plant-based liquid that you can take</p><p>that&rsquo;ll least give you all that and</p><p>that&rsquo;ll help her protein so she doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>end up with atrophied muscles but that</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot more that I have a video</p><p>on that you can actually watch on</p><p>gastric bypass but thanks for your</p><p>questions okay so now we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p><p>Addie for another question on social</p><p>media all right so have Rita on Facebook</p><p>and she&rsquo;s asking if she&rsquo;s doing the one</p><p>meal a day is it recommended for someone</p><p>that&rsquo;s healing their adrenals yeah I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s if she could if she&rsquo;s</p><p>feeling good with it I think it&rsquo;s going</p><p>to help you with your adrenals now</p><p>there&rsquo;s always a transition step of</p><p>going into this and it&rsquo;s kind of like</p><p>you&rsquo;re in the middle of keto adaptation</p><p>so you might not feel great so then you</p><p>want to just load up with the</p><p>nutritional yeast and the electrolytes</p><p>because that way it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll give you</p><p>the nutrients to make this transition</p><p>easier but it&rsquo;s going to take stress off</p><p>the adrenals when you get fully adapted</p><p>because you&rsquo;re no longer running on</p><p>glucose which is going to it&rsquo;s a hue</p><p>improvement for the adrenals just make</p><p>sure what you&rsquo;re eating is healthy and</p><p>make sure with adrenal you do not want</p><p>to cut down your cholesterol fatty foods</p><p>you want to go up with those because all</p><p>these adrenal hormones are made from fat</p><p>so we do not want to deprive the body of</p><p>fat that&rsquo;s like the most important thing</p><p>okay so one more question awesome all</p><p>right have Corinne on YouTube and he&rsquo;s</p><p>asking your electric drink is it okay to</p><p>drink drink fasting yeah the doctor</p><p>light drinks it&rsquo;s just a drink there&rsquo;s</p><p>there&rsquo;s hardly any calories and there&rsquo;s</p><p>all minerals and yes you can take that</p><p>when you&rsquo;re fasting and it actually will</p><p>help you and you just brought them to</p><p>the point there&rsquo;s something called</p><p>Ticino Ticino is an alternative coffee</p><p>it&rsquo;s better than decaf because it has no</p><p>caffeine and it&rsquo;s made from chicory root</p><p>tastes just like coffee I&rsquo;d like to have</p><p>that and when I&rsquo;m fasting because it&rsquo;s</p><p>like no caffeine you&rsquo;re drinking this I</p><p>make these like cups this big it&rsquo;s like</p><p>coffee and what I&rsquo;ll do is I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll</p><p>take Ticino and I&rsquo;ll put in these little</p><p>bags it&rsquo;s a little you can get it out to</p><p>healthy store I&rsquo;ll put these bags it&rsquo;s</p><p>probably like three tablespoons you know</p><p>Lent the water hot water steep for a</p><p>like probably five to six minutes I&rsquo;ll</p><p>put a little bit of xylitol and heavy</p><p>cream</p><p>it makes this thick coffee I&rsquo;m digging</p><p>it I love that and you do that when</p><p>you&rsquo;re fasting it really helps okay now</p><p>we&rsquo;re gonna go to Ashley from Memphis</p><p>you had a question</p><p>hey dr. Berg pollinates Ashley I&rsquo;m 55</p><p>fifty-two years ago 52 years old I&rsquo;m</p><p>being following you for two years right</p><p>in the past I eat all day long and I</p><p>have a no way the problem I&rsquo;m saying I</p><p>in five seven about the 120-pound I&rsquo;m</p><p>always hungry I was always hungry and</p><p>probably I eat old because I either all</p><p>day long I probably damaged my pancreas</p><p>I probably have a fatty liver</p><p>I had a lipoma surgery probably three</p><p>years ago it was on my left shoulder</p><p>and I have a low block low blood</p><p>pressure my blood pressure the high</p><p>usually is like 4050 something and at</p><p>the end the high is the dagger -

Murray I</p><p>started I started following you about</p><p>mid-november and pretty much felt real</p><p>good didn&rsquo;t have any problems</p><p>eliminating carbohydrates and sugars I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t have any problem with the</p><p>intermittent fasting I usually don&rsquo;t eat</p><p>anything after my bulletproof coffee in</p><p>the morning tool usually 3:30 or 4</p><p>o&rsquo;clock good I was feeling real</p><p>comfortable with that and I decided I</p><p>would do a three day fast and on our</p><p>about 70 the best way I can describe it</p><p>is I just went blank and as I told my</p><p>wife I cannot quote I cannot find my</p><p>voice and I had had a prior heart attack</p><p>in October 2013</p><p>so she was concerned about a possible</p><p>stroke so she said well I&rsquo;m calling 911</p><p>I was okay because I knew I was not</p><p>functioning correctly well when I got to</p><p>the ER of course they did blood work and</p><p>my sodium was 116 so I had worked in the</p><p>medical profession and my last boss was</p><p>a geriatrician doctor and he said will</p><p>Glenn usually it&rsquo;s pretty hard for a</p><p>human being to get low sodium I think it</p><p>might be your antidiuretic enzyme that</p><p>was holding water thus diluting your</p><p>sodium but he said I should get in to</p><p>see endocrinologist to check into that</p><p>now once they gave me hydration my</p><p>sodium went from 116 120</p><p>1:27 but they kept me overnight in an</p><p>observation room just to make sure</p><p>because I had had the prior heart attack</p><p>what&rsquo;s your take on that particular</p><p>situation so what did didn&rsquo;t did it go</p><p>down after well no it went from 1016 the</p><p>next time they did it was 122 and then</p><p>127 yeah and then the next day the next</p><p>morning they did a lab draw and it was</p><p>like 130 ok so then they were okay great</p><p>we&rsquo;re okay with releasing me at that</p><p>time yeah so here&rsquo;s the thing about that</p><p>Glenn and and this is going to be real</p><p>quick because I would have to kind of</p><p>get more history on you but when you do</p><p>longer fast the the problem with fasting</p><p>with some people is that it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>like you&rsquo;re mimicking starving so you</p><p>just want to make sure you go you&rsquo;re</p><p>nutrients especially like sea salt and</p><p>things like that because it can then</p><p>show up in various deficiencies whether</p><p>it&rsquo;s a B vitamin sodium electrolyte</p><p>potassium so the key with this the</p><p>cinnamon fasting is make sure that maybe</p><p>if you have pre-existing heart failure</p><p>don&rsquo;t go that long maybe go once a day</p><p>eat and I have make sure it&rsquo;s a</p><p>nutrient-dense meal make sure you get</p><p>your sea salt your potassium your</p><p>electrolytes and I think that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>would recommend but hey Thank You Glen</p><p>for that and thank everyone thanks</p><p>thanks everyone for the wonderful</p><p>questions there are questions that I</p><p>could finally answer and thanks AVI have</p><p>a wonderful weekend and we&rsquo;ll see you</p><p>next week</p><p>[Music]</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
