    <p>hi friends how are you</p>
<p>today i hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not don&rsquo;t worry take a deep breath</p>
<p>you know some</p>
<p>things you just cannot control and that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be okay you know we&rsquo;re gonna be okay i&rsquo;m hi</p>
<p>how are you doing let me adjust my pants</p>
<p>my name is bailey syrian and today is monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup monday</p>
<p>if you are new here hi my name is bailey</p>
<p>syrian and on</p>
<p>mondays i sit down and i talk about true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>not again and i do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true crime and you like makeup</p>
<p>i highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m out of breath</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know cause i don&rsquo;t even think i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it here on murder mystery makeup but i</p>
<p>started another series called dark history</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like murder mystery makeup except it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder mystery and history</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s so fun</p>
<p>no makeup though i mean i&rsquo;m wearing makeup but like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more storytelling the reason i started this</p>
<p>series was because while researching true</p>
<p>crime i always came</p>
<p>across stories throughout history that i wanted to talk</p>
<p>about here on monday</p>
<p>but because they were more like history</p>
<p>focus i felt like</p>
<p>kinda like didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>belong in a way so i&rsquo;ve been wanting to</p>
<p>start a new</p>
<p>series that was</p>
<p>essentially stories throughout history that</p>
<p>at least i never</p>
<p>learned about in school</p>
<p>cause let me tell you history is wild</p>
<p>okay wild we kind of got off her</p>
<p>rocky start at</p>
<p>first but i&rsquo;m finding</p>
<p>my groove in it and getting way more comfortable</p>
<p>at least i think so</p>
<p>my whole goal with the</p>
<p>series was to talk</p>
<p>about lesser</p>
<p>known stories throughout history</p>
<p>but make it realistic for like the</p>
<p>everyday person to</p>
<p>understand you know</p>
<p>cause have you ever read a history book</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>what kind of language are they</p>
<p>speaking i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what i just read i know not everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna relate</p>
<p>to that but that&rsquo;s how i felt of all the times</p>
<p>well i wanted</p>
<p>dark history to be</p>
<p>kind of like this</p>
<p>where if i sit down and i tell you what i learned</p>
<p>cause let me tell you it&rsquo;s freaking</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>so on dark history we&rsquo;ve partnered with historians and</p>
<p>specialists in the</p>
<p>field for each episode</p>
<p>who helps us tell the real stories and know like</p>
<p>sugar coat and</p>
<p>things you know it&rsquo;s been an incredible</p>
<p>experience and i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>learning so much</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in that you can find the dark history podcast</p>
<p>every wednesday</p>
<p>wherever you listen to podcast</p>
<p>and i upload the</p>
<p>video version on</p>
<p>thursday here on my youtube</p>
<p>for those of you who</p>
<p>are more of a visual person like myself you know if you</p>
<p>wanna watch the</p>
<p>video version so i&rsquo;ll stop yip</p>
<p>yapping and let&rsquo;s get into</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>story this one has been highly requested</p>
<p>and it honestly</p>
<p>drove me nuts</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t like unsolved stories</p>
<p>this one it is unsolved i know</p>
<p>ugh i hate them</p>
<p>so today&rsquo;s story takes</p>
<p>place in springfield missouri</p>
<p>in june of 1992</p>
<p>now like many kids in june it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>graduation day for the students over at kickapoo</p>
<p>high school so</p>
<p>the kids are all excited</p>
<p>you know many are waiting</p>
<p>for this day for so long and they&rsquo;re just excited to</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>graduating you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>excited to get out of high school</p>
<p>and start like that new chapter in life</p>
<p>but at first a lot of the students</p>
<p>after graduation</p>
<p>what do they wanna do</p>
<p>they want a party</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of</p>
<p>you know parties</p>
<p>after graduation</p>
<p>going on and you know how high</p>
<p>school parties are</p>
<p>honestly nothing good happens but</p>
<p>hey whatever time to celebrate</p>
<p>you know within the</p>
<p>graduating class there were two good friends stacy</p>
<p>mccall and suzie</p>
<p>streeter yes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>ss in this name too</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t matter but</p>
<p>it was kind of</p>
<p>throwing me off</p>
<p>so stacy is 18</p>
<p>and it was said that she was fun she&rsquo;s bubbly she had a</p>
<p>great sense of humor</p>
<p>she hung out with a lot of the</p>
<p>class clowns it seemed</p>
<p>and she loved</p>
<p>to joke around have fun</p>
<p>she just seemed</p>
<p>like an all around fun person to be around</p>
<p>it was said that she was very good looking and</p>
<p>she did a couple of like</p>
<p>modeling gigs for a</p>
<p>local wedding shop but after high</p>
<p>school she was</p>
<p>ready to graduate and go to missouri</p>
<p>state university susie</p>
<p>now susie was nineteen</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s also similar</p>
<p>to stacy it was said she was very outspoken</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s outgoing</p>
<p>she was super fun to be around</p>
<p>and seemed like a genuinely like</p>
<p>happy person</p>
<p>susie was said to</p>
<p>like be one to hang out with the popular</p>
<p>crowd even dating one of the high</p>
<p>school bad boys</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m rolling my eyes</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>well yeah okay yeah bad boys in</p>
<p>class it plays</p>
<p>later on it makes</p>
<p>sense i guess i just don&rsquo;t like bad boys</p>
<p>whatever children with problems</p>
<p>anywho doesn&rsquo;t matter she was dating one of the high</p>
<p>school bad boys you know but</p>
<p>susie herself she stayed out of</p>
<p>trouble you know though they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>teenagers being</p>
<p>teenagers some of</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>would tease her because</p>
<p>she was like a creature of habit</p>
<p>i guess that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m laughing because like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not but i get it</p>
<p>cause when you&rsquo;re a teenager</p>
<p>people just</p>
<p>pick on you for anything but she was a creature of</p>
<p>habit she liked a routine</p>
<p>susie did she liked a routine</p>
<p>and some of her friends believe that she may have had</p>
<p>ocd tendencies</p>
<p>cannot confirm or deny</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what her friends</p>
<p>kind of were</p>
<p>thinking after high</p>
<p>school susie</p>
<p>she wanted to follow in her mom&rsquo;s footsteps and become</p>
<p>a hairdresser</p>
<p>so there are a lot of</p>
<p>things going on this</p>
<p>night there were a lot of parties</p>
<p>all around many people were heading to branson missouri</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>gonna stay the</p>
<p>night out there at a hotel</p>
<p>and everyone was like</p>
<p>gonna celebrate at the</p>
<p>hotel party</p>
<p>and then the next day they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna head to the</p>
<p>local water park it was called</p>
<p>white water so</p>
<p>party at the hotel</p>
<p>wake up go to</p>
<p>white water</p>
<p>and celebrate</p>
<p>there with all the friends and</p>
<p>stuff you know</p>
<p>so stacy and susie were</p>
<p>gonna do this they were</p>
<p>gonna go out to the</p>
<p>hotel then join everybody at the water park</p>
<p>great but at the last</p>
<p>minute they decided to</p>
<p>change their minds</p>
<p>they decided to head to another friends</p>
<p>of theirs house</p>
<p>her name was janelle</p>
<p>kirby stacy</p>
<p>calls her mom</p>
<p>at ten thirty p m</p>
<p>to let her know</p>
<p>that the plans had</p>
<p>changed okay so stacy and</p>
<p>susie are hanging out together</p>
<p>she calls up her mom she&rsquo;s like hey mom i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to the</p>
<p>hotel anymore i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to janelle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause she&rsquo;s having like a little</p>
<p>party over there</p>
<p>and then tomorrow i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go to the water park</p>
<p>so her mom was like</p>
<p>great have fun</p>
<p>call me in the morning</p>
<p>before you head to the</p>
<p>water park just so i know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re safe and all that you know</p>
<p>mom&rsquo;s gonna check in</p>
<p>so stacy and</p>
<p>susie they head</p>
<p>over to janelle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house where</p>
<p>her neighbor was having a</p>
<p>graduation party of some sorts it was said that it was</p>
<p>crowded and it seemed to be a lot of fun</p>
<p>so they had stayed up</p>
<p>until around like 2 am</p>
<p>and then stacy and</p>
<p>susie decide like hey</p>
<p>we should probably go to bed</p>
<p>because we gotta wake up early and</p>
<p>head to the water park</p>
<p>so stacy and susier</p>
<p>go inside of like janelle&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and they plan on staying the</p>
<p>night there but they&rsquo;re like oh it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>crowded we can&rsquo;t stay here</p>
<p>i guess janelle&rsquo;s family like a</p>
<p>bunch of her family members had</p>
<p>come into town</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t know they were coming into town</p>
<p>but there was no room for stacy and</p>
<p>susie to crash</p>
<p>so they were like okay</p>
<p>one more now</p>
<p>so they decide like let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and sleep there instead</p>
<p>so they go their friend janelle</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like hey</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re heading out but we&rsquo;ll be back in the morning you</p>
<p>know so we could all head to the</p>
<p>water park together pick her up</p>
<p>go together you know</p>
<p>and janelle&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>great you know see you then</p>
<p>so the girls head over</p>
<p>to 1717 east del mar</p>
<p>street where susie</p>
<p>lived with her mom</p>
<p>cheryl levitt so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got stacy</p>
<p>susie and cheryl</p>
<p>cheryl and her</p>
<p>daughter susie</p>
<p>they had recently</p>
<p>moved into this home</p>
<p>i guess like</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s parents had divorced</p>
<p>and the two</p>
<p>her mom and</p>
<p>susie they moved into the</p>
<p>house they were</p>
<p>still kind of like</p>
<p>settling in it seems like</p>
<p>it was said that cheryl</p>
<p>the mom she was forty</p>
<p>seven years old</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m laughing because</p>
<p>i was watching some interviews</p>
<p>trying to get an idea of like who cheryl was you know</p>
<p>and you know most of the time</p>
<p>in a story like</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s people are like oh so and so</p>
<p>lit up a room when she walked inside and her</p>
<p>smile would</p>
<p>turn anyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>day around like they were just amazing as a person well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awkward it&rsquo;s awkward because</p>
<p>cheryl&rsquo;s sister in a</p>
<p>later interview</p>
<p>would describe her as</p>
<p>quote a pretty fierce lady</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t do a lot</p>
<p>of half measures in her life so yeah</p>
<p>i really sat with that for a</p>
<p>while i was</p>
<p>like what does that mean half measures in her life huh</p>
<p>was that even me</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get it you know</p>
<p>most of times you get like</p>
<p>other smile lit up a room</p>
<p>and the way she said it was like very</p>
<p>straightforward like no like</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what that meant i really sat with that for like</p>
<p>a while and</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t figure out what she was getting out there half</p>
<p>measures in her life i&rsquo;m sure someone will let me know</p>
<p>down below can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>cheryl she also worked as a hairstylist at one of the</p>
<p>local salons so the two of them</p>
<p>drive over to</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s house okay</p>
<p>they change out of their</p>
<p>clothes they wash off</p>
<p>their makeup and then they head to bed here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the mystery comes in</p>
<p>so the next morning it&rsquo;s 8 a</p>
<p>m janelle is calling susie</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s calling her house it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>again 8 a m</p>
<p>but nobody&rsquo;s picking up the</p>
<p>phone bring</p>
<p>bring bring</p>
<p>bring bring</p>
<p>brain brain</p>
<p>nothing goes to voicemail okay</p>
<p>weird susie and stacy</p>
<p>were supposed to head over to janelle&rsquo;s that morning</p>
<p>to go to the water park</p>
<p>and everyone is kind of like waiting for them</p>
<p>so they can all head out so janelle ends up calling</p>
<p>again bang bang</p>
<p>bang you know</p>
<p>again no answer</p>
<p>so janelle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking like okay i bet they slept in</p>
<p>right i mean they had a late</p>
<p>night last night</p>
<p>and they probably just don&rsquo;t hear the</p>
<p>phone ringing</p>
<p>make sense so janelle and her boyfriend they decide to</p>
<p>drive over to</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s around nine am</p>
<p>when they arrive when they get there</p>
<p>so when janelle and her boyfriend pull up to</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>they see that all</p>
<p>three of their cars</p>
<p>are out front in the</p>
<p>driveway so</p>
<p>again they must be home all</p>
<p>their cars are there looks like everybody&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>great this is a</p>
<p>random side note</p>
<p>but remember</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you know but it&rsquo;s nineteen ninety two</p>
<p>okay no cell phones</p>
<p>member no cell</p>
<p>phones this is a time when people people</p>
<p>back then before cell</p>
<p>phones they</p>
<p>would just show up to your</p>
<p>house oh yeah</p>
<p>let me tell you it was a different time people</p>
<p>would just show up</p>
<p>knock knock</p>
<p>knock and you&rsquo;re like oh hi</p>
<p>it sounds awful</p>
<p>but honestly</p>
<p>kinda miss it</p>
<p>anyways so no cell phones</p>
<p>great so they go to the house they</p>
<p>see all the cars</p>
<p>okay so janelle</p>
<p>and her boyfriend mike</p>
<p>they walk up to the</p>
<p>front door and the</p>
<p>first thing that they noticed is that the</p>
<p>front porch</p>
<p>light it was broken</p>
<p>and there was</p>
<p>glass all over the</p>
<p>floor but the weird</p>
<p>thing was or is i don&rsquo;t know the weird</p>
<p>thing was is</p>
<p>the weird thing was that the porch</p>
<p>light itself was broken</p>
<p>but not the bulb inside</p>
<p>do you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying like just the outer part was broken</p>
<p>but not the bulb</p>
<p>and that was something that was noted okay</p>
<p>weird but more annoying</p>
<p>because janelle said that she wasn&rsquo;t wearing</p>
<p>any shoes she was barefoot</p>
<p>so she was just more</p>
<p>like worried that she was</p>
<p>gonna step on glass</p>
<p>so it was said that the boyfriend</p>
<p>janelle&rsquo;s boyfriend his name is mike</p>
<p>he makes like a makeshift</p>
<p>broom and is able to</p>
<p>sweep up the</p>
<p>glass okay they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t even got to the door yet they</p>
<p>saw the glass</p>
<p>just sweeping it up</p>
<p>super nice my question here</p>
<p>because i was trying to</p>
<p>figure this out was</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how he the boyfriend had like a</p>
<p>broom on deck or</p>
<p>where this said</p>
<p>broom came from</p>
<p>because it said that he swept it up with a</p>
<p>broom and in my mind i was</p>
<p>thinking i was</p>
<p>thinking it</p>
<p>would make sense if it was a makeshift broom</p>
<p>you know like if you have two pieces of</p>
<p>cardboard in your car or something and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>so i was like</p>
<p>maybe it was a makeshift broom</p>
<p>but a lot of reports said he</p>
<p>grabbed a broom and swept up the</p>
<p>glass either way</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it matters or not but that part to me i just</p>
<p>i get fixated on the</p>
<p>weird stuff</p>
<p>right i was like</p>
<p>where did this</p>
<p>broom come from</p>
<p>but he swept up the glass</p>
<p>so after doing so</p>
<p>which honestly was nice</p>
<p>but crime scene so not good so</p>
<p>after he swept it up he goes to the front door</p>
<p>knock knock</p>
<p>knock no answer</p>
<p>and then they realize</p>
<p>that the um the</p>
<p>front door was unlocked okay so the</p>
<p>doors unlocked and the two of them go inside okay they</p>
<p>start looking around the</p>
<p>house now the</p>
<p>house itself was pretty quiet</p>
<p>um the tv was left on</p>
<p>which was weird i</p>
<p>guess it was left on like when those</p>
<p>static channels were just like the</p>
<p>white black and</p>
<p>white you know what i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>hopefully you don&rsquo;t so the tv was left on</p>
<p>and then they see cheryl&rsquo;s dog</p>
<p>his name is cinnamon</p>
<p>he comes walking into the</p>
<p>living room and he seems very anxious little cinnamon</p>
<p>very anxious</p>
<p>he just wants to like be held</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like okay</p>
<p>they said that like</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t see anything unusual but something felt</p>
<p>off and you know how that is i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just saying like you know our feelings man sometimes</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense but man are we</p>
<p>little weirdos i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re saying like they felt something something</p>
<p>felt off so the two of them are looking around the</p>
<p>house and they come across all</p>
<p>three of the ladies</p>
<p>purses jewelry</p>
<p>and makeup out the house</p>
<p>now to janelle and her boyfriend</p>
<p>it meant like oh they must have</p>
<p>literally just been here</p>
<p>but the house was</p>
<p>empty so it was like okay</p>
<p>we must have just missed them</p>
<p>so other than the</p>
<p>light fixture outside being</p>
<p>broken there was really like no signs of a struggle</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>weird vibes inside</p>
<p>you know janelle</p>
<p>would say later on that she honestly thought that</p>
<p>the girls just must have like headed out to the park</p>
<p>the water park</p>
<p>already at that</p>
<p>point and they just must have like missed each</p>
<p>other so janelle and her boyfriend they</p>
<p>decide like okay let&rsquo;s just head to the park they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably already there and we&rsquo;ll probably run into like</p>
<p>susie and stacy you know</p>
<p>so while they are walking out to the</p>
<p>front door the</p>
<p>phone rings</p>
<p>the phone rings janelle</p>
<p>answers the</p>
<p>phone now on the</p>
<p>other end of the</p>
<p>phone was a man she didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and whoever it was was saying like a</p>
<p>bunch of sexual innuendos</p>
<p>yeah i couldn&rsquo;t figure out like what i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it matters it was just said sexual</p>
<p>anyone knows it was enough to</p>
<p>gross janelle out</p>
<p>and she just hangs up the</p>
<p>phone she&rsquo;s like ew</p>
<p>click not long</p>
<p>after she hangs up</p>
<p>the phone rings</p>
<p>again and this time janelle</p>
<p>says that she kind of hesitated a little bit more</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t know if i want to answer this but</p>
<p>she ends up picking it up again and</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a man on the</p>
<p>other end just saying all sorts of like</p>
<p>freak nasty</p>
<p>stuff janelle</p>
<p>says she gets</p>
<p>grossed out she&rsquo;s like ew</p>
<p>and then hangs up at this moment janelle said</p>
<p>that she had like a</p>
<p>light bulb moment she had remembered not long ago</p>
<p>susie had mentioned that she was getting like</p>
<p>weird prank calls is it</p>
<p>prank calls or</p>
<p>crank calls by the way i</p>
<p>should have looked that up</p>
<p>i really don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve heard both and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i always say prank</p>
<p>so janelle was like yeah that was</p>
<p>weird that must have been like</p>
<p>the prank caller i guess</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t think much</p>
<p>about it and then she decides to head out and go</p>
<p>catch up with</p>
<p>their friends at the</p>
<p>water park so they leave</p>
<p>now i know what you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>right now you&rsquo;re like uh</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you be worried</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you do this</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you do that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you blah blah blah blah blah</p>
<p>could would have should</p>
<p>right but honestly</p>
<p>again nobody cared like that ninety two no cell</p>
<p>phones if someone wasn&rsquo;t home they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t home and it wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t thinking i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak for them</p>
<p>but they just</p>
<p>yeah do you get what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we could play</p>
<p>coulda woulda</p>
<p>shoulda all day but</p>
<p>at the end of the day they left and they went to the</p>
<p>water park so around this time janice mccall</p>
<p>stacy&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah stacy&rsquo;s mom what</p>
<p>mom we know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come stacy&rsquo;s mom she&rsquo;s feeling a little uneasy</p>
<p>she hadn&rsquo;t heard from her</p>
<p>daughter that morning</p>
<p>and it was very unlike her to</p>
<p>not call at least like</p>
<p>check in so stacy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother she decides to call janelle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house remember janelle</p>
<p>the original plan so she calls janelle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and then</p>
<p>janelle tells her oh they end up staying at</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s house and</p>
<p>i think at this</p>
<p>point stacy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mom was like oh okay she must be just doing her thing</p>
<p>like graduation</p>
<p>night plans are</p>
<p>changing like she&rsquo;s fine just</p>
<p>let her do her</p>
<p>thing and she kind of just lets</p>
<p>her daughter be</p>
<p>and i say this because janice</p>
<p>ends up waiting</p>
<p>about seven</p>
<p>hours she lets</p>
<p>seven hours go by</p>
<p>until she tries to</p>
<p>again connect with her</p>
<p>daughter again we</p>
<p>coulda woulda</p>
<p>shoulda all damn day</p>
<p>but she was just kind of like you know what my</p>
<p>daughter she</p>
<p>just graduated</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s hanging out with her friend she&rsquo;s doing her</p>
<p>thing she&rsquo;s responsible like let her be she&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>which is super sad because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure you want to like</p>
<p>trust your daughter and</p>
<p>stuff and now it&rsquo;s not the time to be</p>
<p>trusting them</p>
<p>anyway so seven</p>
<p>hours go by so then</p>
<p>stacy&rsquo;s mother she decides to call</p>
<p>cheryl&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>see if her daughter&rsquo;s there because</p>
<p>again seven</p>
<p>hours go by she hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard from her</p>
<p>daughter at all and</p>
<p>ring ring ring</p>
<p>no answer so janice</p>
<p>figures that something must be</p>
<p>wrong with the</p>
<p>house phone because like it&rsquo;s ringing</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s answering so like something must be</p>
<p>wrong with the phone</p>
<p>so she decides just to go by cheryl&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and see if they&rsquo;re there so when janice</p>
<p>gets to the home she finds that the</p>
<p>front door is unlocked</p>
<p>and she goes inside and the</p>
<p>house is empty</p>
<p>now at this very same time janelle</p>
<p>and her boyfriend show back up at the</p>
<p>house to check and see why</p>
<p>susie and stacy didn&rsquo;t show up</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of like a little</p>
<p>scooby doo meeting</p>
<p>you know like the</p>
<p>three of them</p>
<p>are all there and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re looking for them i&rsquo;m looking for them we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen them so all</p>
<p>three of them decide to</p>
<p>kind of walk around the</p>
<p>house and do some investigating</p>
<p>you know looking for any answers</p>
<p>so janice goes into</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s room and she notices that stacy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>purse and makeup bag</p>
<p>were sitting on the floor</p>
<p>right next to not only</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s purse</p>
<p>but also her mom</p>
<p>cheryl&rsquo;s purse</p>
<p>too now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>first of all if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going somewhere most likely you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take your bag with you okay</p>
<p>has all of your</p>
<p>cards id you get it you</p>
<p>would take it great</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>what was really</p>
<p>weird i think what was even more</p>
<p>weird was the fact that all</p>
<p>three of their purses</p>
<p>were on the ground</p>
<p>next to each</p>
<p>other tell me that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>weird that suspicious</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>that would give me the chills</p>
<p>like why are all</p>
<p>their bags on the floor</p>
<p>next to each</p>
<p>other so this obviously kind of like gives</p>
<p>janice a weird feeling she&rsquo;s not feeling that great</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like you know what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna call police</p>
<p>okay so she calls police</p>
<p>lets him know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on and then</p>
<p>afterwards she</p>
<p>calls her husband and tells him to come over</p>
<p>while she waits for police so she hangs up the phone</p>
<p>and then janice</p>
<p>she notices that</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>chair i&rsquo;m not farting</p>
<p>the on the answering machine</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a blinking light</p>
<p>going off informing</p>
<p>her that there&rsquo;s a message on the answering machine</p>
<p>and on the old</p>
<p>school answering machines it</p>
<p>would blink</p>
<p>you know great</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>let me listen to the answering machine because</p>
<p>maybe someone</p>
<p>maybe they left me a message or something janice</p>
<p>listens to the answering machine</p>
<p>and whoever it was left a very</p>
<p>lewd message</p>
<p>and it was pointless</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really get to anything it was just somebody</p>
<p>again making</p>
<p>sexual innuendos</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like oh my god that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>gross that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird you know</p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing the old</p>
<p>school answering machines</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t save your messages</p>
<p>most of the</p>
<p>time like you had to make sure and save the messages</p>
<p>most of the times they</p>
<p>would be automatically deleted once you played them</p>
<p>so with that being said</p>
<p>after listening to the message</p>
<p>it gets deleted from the answering machine no</p>
<p>yes like i get it she shouldn&rsquo;t have listened</p>
<p>to the answering machine and</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>roast her i know it in the comment section we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>gonna be like why</p>
<p>would you do that</p>
<p>but i i get it i get it she wanted</p>
<p>to know and she didn&rsquo;t mean for it to get deleted but</p>
<p>it got deleted</p>
<p>poor lady i&rsquo;m sure she regrets that very much</p>
<p>i know this may be wrong but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in love with stacy&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>so by the time all this has taken</p>
<p>place and the police are called</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been like a full day</p>
<p>since anyone</p>
<p>has heard from any of the</p>
<p>ladies okay</p>
<p>but police end up coming out</p>
<p>and they try to investigate the scene</p>
<p>but since people were coming and going</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed that it contaminated the</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>plus on top of that the</p>
<p>voice message was deleted</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s really not a lot to work with also a side</p>
<p>note that i kind of was purposely leaving out cause it</p>
<p>could get a bit confusing</p>
<p>for a lot of people</p>
<p>so while stacy&rsquo;s mom is</p>
<p>waiting for</p>
<p>the police and</p>
<p>stuff to show up</p>
<p>she starts cleaning the</p>
<p>house a little bit okay and i</p>
<p>guess like some neighbors</p>
<p>kind of hang out too it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>clear if it was neighbors or if it was like um</p>
<p>chanel and her boyfriend but they start</p>
<p>cleaning up the</p>
<p>house they&rsquo;re like oh</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;m here like let me just</p>
<p>pick up and make</p>
<p>things look nice</p>
<p>not realizing that this is a</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>and you shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>cleaning it up you know</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re cleaning up the</p>
<p>house they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;m here let me just</p>
<p>be polite and do the dishes for her and vacuum so</p>
<p>they literally</p>
<p>clean the house</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re waiting and</p>
<p>yeah so that</p>
<p>all bad stacy&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>literally did</p>
<p>everything you</p>
<p>should not do</p>
<p>um great that part was a little confusing</p>
<p>to me because i wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was like the</p>
<p>neighbors because i know people were kind of coming and</p>
<p>going everyone seemed to be really</p>
<p>close which</p>
<p>sounds nice</p>
<p>but not when it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crime scene ugh</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>ah whoopsie</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in love with stacy</p>
<p>bailey stop</p>
<p>with that song it&rsquo;s not appropriate right now</p>
<p>okay so police come out and they&rsquo;re looking around</p>
<p>and kind of like what</p>
<p>everybody else was saying there&rsquo;s like not much for</p>
<p>police to be working with they did note that the the</p>
<p>porch light was indeed broken right</p>
<p>but other than that there was no sign of a struggle</p>
<p>the house looked very normal</p>
<p>and very clean</p>
<p>cause it was cleaned</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s bed it looked like it had been</p>
<p>slept in the girl&rsquo;s clothes</p>
<p>they were folded</p>
<p>and they were like on the</p>
<p>dresser next to</p>
<p>their jewelry</p>
<p>and it was said that in</p>
<p>the room there were makeup wipes around suggesting that</p>
<p>at some point they must have came home</p>
<p>they got unready</p>
<p>and then they went to bed they</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at least at some</p>
<p>point were there</p>
<p>okay also upon</p>
<p>further investigation everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stuff was still there they found 900</p>
<p>in cheryl&rsquo;s purse</p>
<p>her car keys and</p>
<p>again there was jewelry</p>
<p>so it was clear to the police that it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a robbery yeah</p>
<p>cause those are</p>
<p>prime things to be stolen</p>
<p>especially the 900</p>
<p>and then one</p>
<p>thing that was noted</p>
<p>many found odd</p>
<p>was that cheryl her pack of</p>
<p>smokes and her</p>
<p>lighter were</p>
<p>still in her bag in the</p>
<p>house now this</p>
<p>may not seem that important to many of us out here in</p>
<p>youtube world</p>
<p>but cheryl was a big time smoker</p>
<p>and it was said that there was no way in heck that she</p>
<p>would leave the</p>
<p>house without her</p>
<p>smokes yeah she</p>
<p>could have gotten another pack or something but she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t waste a pack like that</p>
<p>it would go with her</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>so police they</p>
<p>tried their best</p>
<p>to try and like recover</p>
<p>the deleted</p>
<p>voice message but</p>
<p>it was a dead end they couldn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>about it it was just gone</p>
<p>and again there was nothing in the</p>
<p>house that gave any clues as to what happened that</p>
<p>night no furniture out of</p>
<p>place there was no signs of a struggle</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no dna</p>
<p>no blood splatter</p>
<p>spatter it&rsquo;s a con</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s nothing so police they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know where to go from here well some</p>
<p>time goes by and there are not many leads so police</p>
<p>start digging around</p>
<p>you know and they look into all of the</p>
<p>girls past and they&rsquo;re trying to figure out you know</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s gone off</p>
<p>freaking something so they</p>
<p>start looking into</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s background</p>
<p>and they see that she was dating a guy</p>
<p>named dustin</p>
<p>for a bit of time now remember in the beginning i said</p>
<p>she was dating a bad boy yeah</p>
<p>well dustin was indeed</p>
<p>a very bad boy okay they see that they were dating</p>
<p>for a bit of time and he had recently been arrested</p>
<p>for being part of a</p>
<p>grave robbing gang</p>
<p>yes he robbed someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grave and then got caught</p>
<p>so he got like gold teeth</p>
<p>or something like super</p>
<p>i hate people they&rsquo;re just so</p>
<p>stupid like why just leave them</p>
<p>alone they&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>leave them alone</p>
<p>anyway so he got caught okay and i</p>
<p>guess at some point</p>
<p>susie had learned</p>
<p>about this that they had robbed graves</p>
<p>and she ended up</p>
<p>breaking up with him</p>
<p>now there were rumors</p>
<p>going around that said</p>
<p>susie was the one who turned him into police</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it was a</p>
<p>rumor because i</p>
<p>found another source that said</p>
<p>that she had actually given a</p>
<p>statement to police</p>
<p>on march 5th 1992 so yeah she</p>
<p>definitely said something and</p>
<p>the boys this gang</p>
<p>they were going on</p>
<p>trial and susie was</p>
<p>scheduled to testify</p>
<p>against her ex boyfriend and his gang</p>
<p>at the trial in a few</p>
<p>months so if that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t scream a</p>
<p>freaking motive i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what else does i mean all signs are kind of</p>
<p>pointing to him</p>
<p>hello boop boop</p>
<p>boop like yes</p>
<p>you police are like okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it it&rsquo;s this guy for sure no ifs ands or buts</p>
<p>so police they go out and they question dustin</p>
<p>and they question also the</p>
<p>friends that he&rsquo;s hanging out with and they all pass</p>
<p>a polygraph</p>
<p>test and they denied having anything to do with</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>now there was nothing</p>
<p>there was no evidence to link them to any crime okay</p>
<p>so the police they had to let them go</p>
<p>but it was noted</p>
<p>that none of them had like a</p>
<p>solid alibi</p>
<p>as to where they were the</p>
<p>night that the</p>
<p>ladies went missing kind of seem like everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story was kind of wishy washy</p>
<p>okay and they&rsquo;re like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna freaking get you i know</p>
<p>them it has to be</p>
<p>next the police decide to look into bart</p>
<p>streeter so they&rsquo;re looking into this</p>
<p>older brother</p>
<p>and they look into his</p>
<p>background and they find that bart he</p>
<p>was about nine years</p>
<p>older than susie</p>
<p>and he was kind of considered the</p>
<p>black sheep in the family</p>
<p>years before 1992</p>
<p>this whole situation happened</p>
<p>bart was kicked out of the family home and he</p>
<p>was like on his own and he was struggling with alcohol</p>
<p>and he just really</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have the best relationship with his family</p>
<p>and for a while he kept his distance</p>
<p>and then after a bad</p>
<p>breakup he had recently</p>
<p>moved back to springfield</p>
<p>bart wanted to try</p>
<p>and fix things between his family</p>
<p>pretty much his mom&rsquo;s relationship</p>
<p>and his sister</p>
<p>so he cleaned up</p>
<p>he got a job and</p>
<p>think he got sober</p>
<p>for my understanding but</p>
<p>it was said that he was doing a lot better</p>
<p>and then there was one</p>
<p>point when susie</p>
<p>actually ended up moving in with bart for a bit</p>
<p>of time to try and bond and like rebuild the brother</p>
<p>sister relationship but</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t last</p>
<p>that long the two had gotten into a really bad</p>
<p>fight i guess bart was drinking</p>
<p>and then he got</p>
<p>aggressive towards</p>
<p>susie so it was</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t long</p>
<p>after she moved in she ends up moving back home</p>
<p>and then that was the end of</p>
<p>their relationship so cops</p>
<p>bring bart in</p>
<p>for questioning and he tells them that on the</p>
<p>night of june 6 the night</p>
<p>before the women</p>
<p>went missing</p>
<p>he had been in a neighbor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and he was super</p>
<p>drunk he said i was just wasted</p>
<p>so he said he was</p>
<p>super wasted</p>
<p>but he ended up</p>
<p>going home at</p>
<p>about 11 30</p>
<p>pm and then he passed out now there were no witnesses</p>
<p>to confirm if his</p>
<p>story was even true</p>
<p>so plus he kept saying he was super</p>
<p>drunk so it&rsquo;s like how much do we believe you bud</p>
<p>so they asked if bart</p>
<p>would do a polygraph test</p>
<p>and bart agrees</p>
<p>and it says that he passes with flying</p>
<p>colors and again because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>direct evidence</p>
<p>that connects bart to the disappearance the cops</p>
<p>police investigators whoever they have to let him go</p>
<p>cause they got nothing</p>
<p>a couple of days</p>
<p>after the disappearance another lead comes in</p>
<p>this time it&rsquo;s from an</p>
<p>older woman who lived</p>
<p>in the same neighborhood as the girls who were missing</p>
<p>so i guess this</p>
<p>older woman she would sit</p>
<p>like outside</p>
<p>on her little patio</p>
<p>pretty often</p>
<p>as one does</p>
<p>you know and she</p>
<p>would just kind of observe her surroundings</p>
<p>she knew what</p>
<p>kind of cars came through the neighborhood</p>
<p>and she just kind of knew when</p>
<p>things seemed out of</p>
<p>place well she</p>
<p>had called the police to report that a couple of days</p>
<p>after the woman&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>she had noticed a strange</p>
<p>greenish van</p>
<p>driving on the block</p>
<p>yeah it was like one of those</p>
<p>creeper vans</p>
<p>and it was definitely out of</p>
<p>place but what</p>
<p>was even more strange to her was that there was a</p>
<p>young woman driving</p>
<p>with blonde hair okay she&rsquo;s driving the van</p>
<p>and she seemed to be stressed or</p>
<p>worried or bothered like she wasn&rsquo;t driving</p>
<p>happy she was just very</p>
<p>some something told the</p>
<p>woman that she was very stressed</p>
<p>now the woman also said that she had</p>
<p>heard a male</p>
<p>voice talking to the driver or whoever was driving</p>
<p>and this male</p>
<p>voice it sounded very</p>
<p>aggressive so she reported hearing a male</p>
<p>voice saying</p>
<p>quote don&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>stupid at least it was</p>
<p>along those lines</p>
<p>so police asked her like</p>
<p>what took you so long to like report this information</p>
<p>and the lady was like well i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about these</p>
<p>women that were missing</p>
<p>until recently and then she made the connection</p>
<p>about the van</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like okay</p>
<p>let me at least</p>
<p>they got it</p>
<p>so police show this woman a</p>
<p>photo of the</p>
<p>three missing women</p>
<p>and she said that the person who was driving the van</p>
<p>definitely looked like susie so</p>
<p>could be true</p>
<p>could be not true you know how eyewitness accounts go</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>wanna believe it you really do but it&rsquo;s hard because</p>
<p>eyewitness accounts are not</p>
<p>not the best but</p>
<p>hey they got nothing so the</p>
<p>woman reporting this</p>
<p>sighting had no description</p>
<p>of the man who was talking in the van</p>
<p>but she did give a good description of the</p>
<p>vehicle itself she said that it was like a</p>
<p>greenish color</p>
<p>it was between 1960 to 1970s</p>
<p>and um the police</p>
<p>they thought that she was a very credible witness</p>
<p>so with this information they go on a</p>
<p>search for anyone with this type of</p>
<p>vehicle they</p>
<p>start pulling over</p>
<p>every van that matches the description</p>
<p>and they go</p>
<p>as far as to buying a van similar to the one that the</p>
<p>woman described</p>
<p>and they parked it in</p>
<p>front of the</p>
<p>local police station with like a message</p>
<p>in the window that said like have you seen this van</p>
<p>looking for information</p>
<p>you know so it&rsquo;s parked out</p>
<p>front so anyone driving by</p>
<p>if they saw</p>
<p>that vans i come forward with any information</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like okay</p>
<p>i thought it was a good idea i was like oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great you know how</p>
<p>these stories go most of the time police are like</p>
<p>oh well you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen it here</p>
<p>so at least they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really hoping that anybody will come forward</p>
<p>with some information like have they seen that ban</p>
<p>and over time they end up getting a lot of tips</p>
<p>in regards to this van</p>
<p>right but many were reporting it to be like a different</p>
<p>color but it</p>
<p>sounded like police</p>
<p>were saying that it was like</p>
<p>every color you can</p>
<p>think of people were saying they saw this van but in</p>
<p>black white</p>
<p>purple but you</p>
<p>know and it was just it wasn&rsquo;t helping it just wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going anywhere</p>
<p>so six months go by</p>
<p>still no leads</p>
<p>on new year&rsquo;s eve of 1992</p>
<p>an episode of america&rsquo;s most wanted was playing on tv</p>
<p>and they were sharing the</p>
<p>story about the strange disappearance</p>
<p>of what was now called the springfield</p>
<p>three because it&rsquo;s springfield and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three missing</p>
<p>on the show they</p>
<p>share all the information they had</p>
<p>right and they tell people</p>
<p>to call and come forward if they have any information</p>
<p>you know like they do so that</p>
<p>night a man calls in saying that he had information</p>
<p>about this case</p>
<p>and the operator on the</p>
<p>phone who initially answered the call</p>
<p>then was trying to connect them to the</p>
<p>springfield detectives but sadly</p>
<p>the call was</p>
<p>dropped or whoever called hung up but either way</p>
<p>call was done so whoever it was hung up whatever</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t call back</p>
<p>and the hotline was unable to</p>
<p>trace the call</p>
<p>so once again a</p>
<p>freaking dead end</p>
<p>i guess it sounded promising</p>
<p>promising enough to like</p>
<p>bring it up</p>
<p>but who knows what if it was just a</p>
<p>prank call prank call</p>
<p>whatever it is</p>
<p>well again more time just goes by</p>
<p>and then in</p>
<p>1993 there&rsquo;s a man by the name of steven garrison</p>
<p>he came forward saying that he knew</p>
<p>what happened to the</p>
<p>springfield 3</p>
<p>and he said he knew</p>
<p>where they were buried at</p>
<p>and was willing to</p>
<p>share this information</p>
<p>only if he could get a plea bargain</p>
<p>for what he was dealing with so this guy</p>
<p>steve says that one</p>
<p>night he was at a party</p>
<p>and he was like getting</p>
<p>drunk with some friends you know</p>
<p>and this other friend who was there that was</p>
<p>super drunk comes up to him and</p>
<p>starts confessing to killing</p>
<p>these women</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what he tells the police</p>
<p>now police are kind of like hmm</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about your story</p>
<p>sir you know like</p>
<p>okay but then steven</p>
<p>start to share some</p>
<p>information that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>released to the public</p>
<p>regarding the case</p>
<p>so they decide to have steven</p>
<p>take them where the</p>
<p>bodies were buried allegedly</p>
<p>according to him</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure what it was he shared that was</p>
<p>not public information but it was something that</p>
<p>definitely got police interested like</p>
<p>okay maybe he&rsquo;s onto something here</p>
<p>police also</p>
<p>serve three</p>
<p>search warrants in two different</p>
<p>states where they</p>
<p>think there</p>
<p>might be more clues</p>
<p>based off of what the stephen guy was saying</p>
<p>and so steven he ends up</p>
<p>bringing them to some</p>
<p>property a property that was</p>
<p>searched was</p>
<p>a site that was once mentioned in another case</p>
<p>of two missing</p>
<p>women back in</p>
<p>1990 now this was not related</p>
<p>to this this</p>
<p>springfield</p>
<p>three case at all</p>
<p>but it was weird that this was like the same location</p>
<p>for another missing case</p>
<p>so maybe steven got his cases</p>
<p>mixed up or</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know police</p>
<p>found something</p>
<p>they found something okay the property</p>
<p>owner was said to be an</p>
<p>older man i don&rsquo;t know and he pled guilty to two</p>
<p>counts of second degree murder</p>
<p>which was a case that was believed to be a drug deal</p>
<p>gone bad again not related</p>
<p>to this case</p>
<p>at all but please find something on his property</p>
<p>and they end up putting a gag</p>
<p>order on steven</p>
<p>which pretty much says that he legally cannot</p>
<p>speak about this case or anything that they may have</p>
<p>found on the property</p>
<p>so they put on this gag</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s called a gag</p>
<p>order it sounds</p>
<p>dirty but it&rsquo;s called a gag</p>
<p>order so no one can talk</p>
<p>about the case</p>
<p>right not even the police could talk</p>
<p>about the case</p>
<p>some people are</p>
<p>asking police like what are the updates or information</p>
<p>about these missing</p>
<p>women like what</p>
<p>happened to them because there&rsquo;s like nothing</p>
<p>nobody can talk</p>
<p>about it because of the gag</p>
<p>order so whatever was on this property</p>
<p>or whatever was</p>
<p>found they were not</p>
<p>going to talk about it</p>
<p>nobody was allowed to talk</p>
<p>about it nothing</p>
<p>very strange</p>
<p>you know naturally people are like oh my god</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s related</p>
<p>to the springfield</p>
<p>three i mean</p>
<p>hello makes sense</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being so hush hush</p>
<p>about it and it</p>
<p>could be true but it also</p>
<p>might not be and</p>
<p>maybe they found</p>
<p>stuff on the property that was not related</p>
<p>in any way but</p>
<p>maybe it was related</p>
<p>to another case uh</p>
<p>huh but police did find steven&rsquo;s information credible</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>pretty familiar with steven&rsquo;s past as well</p>
<p>you see steven was not a very</p>
<p>great person to say the</p>
<p>least steven</p>
<p>steven steven</p>
<p>steven was in</p>
<p>prison serving a 40 year sentence for kidnapping</p>
<p>and rape charges</p>
<p>from a springfield college girl</p>
<p>who was kidnapped in 1993 so</p>
<p>again like he wanted some sort of plea</p>
<p>bargain to help him out with that situation</p>
<p>no who freaking knows what they</p>
<p>found who knows what they</p>
<p>found on that property i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a super weird</p>
<p>story and no answer seemed to be coming from this lead</p>
<p>especially with the gag</p>
<p>order in place</p>
<p>again this story</p>
<p>three women just</p>
<p>vanished poof stacy</p>
<p>susie and cheryl</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bizarre</p>
<p>no answers seem to be coming from anyone</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>another tip comes in from florida suggesting that a guy</p>
<p>named robert</p>
<p>cox was responsible for the disappearances now</p>
<p>robert was said to be a</p>
<p>highly trained army ranger who was recently convicted</p>
<p>and sentenced to</p>
<p>death for brutally</p>
<p>murdering another 19 year old girl in florida</p>
<p>but in the end his verdict was reversed</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole mess that we&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>touch right now</p>
<p>but please do some digging around and find out that</p>
<p>robert had moved to springfield</p>
<p>right before these</p>
<p>women went missing and he used to work at the same</p>
<p>dealership as stacy&rsquo;s dad</p>
<p>so i mean mmm</p>
<p>you know police question him</p>
<p>and he says</p>
<p>that he was at a golf tournament with his parents</p>
<p>he was staying with them for the</p>
<p>night and then the next morning he took his</p>
<p>girlfriend to church</p>
<p>and according to his</p>
<p>girlfriend that&rsquo;s exactly what happened</p>
<p>you know they don&rsquo;t really believe him</p>
<p>or her but again</p>
<p>without any hard evidence</p>
<p>they have to let him go they don&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how i feel</p>
<p>about this robert guy i mean yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like mmm</p>
<p>could be but i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>when he robbed them or so i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>later in 1995</p>
<p>robert was arrested in</p>
<p>texas for aggravated robbery but</p>
<p>this time his</p>
<p>girlfriend or the</p>
<p>now ex girlfriend</p>
<p>starts singing a different tune</p>
<p>you know she</p>
<p>snatches back her original alibi</p>
<p>on the night</p>
<p>of the springfield 3</p>
<p>when they went missing so</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like actually i lied for him</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t with me that night</p>
<p>so when springfield police hear this they go down to</p>
<p>texas to question him but he refuses to talk</p>
<p>but then oddly enough</p>
<p>in nineteen ninety six during an interview with the</p>
<p>local reporter</p>
<p>robert says something just</p>
<p>super weird</p>
<p>super weird this reporter</p>
<p>asked him hey do you know anything</p>
<p>about the springfield three</p>
<p>and then robert</p>
<p>says i know that they&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll say that well police</p>
<p>again get word of this</p>
<p>and they head out to question</p>
<p>robert once again</p>
<p>but he refuses to</p>
<p>admit killing the women</p>
<p>being involved</p>
<p>he starts saying like</p>
<p>super cryptic mysterious</p>
<p>messages to police like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t give you any specifics</p>
<p>until my mom is dead</p>
<p>i just know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dead that&rsquo;s not my theory i just know that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like dude shut up don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so annoying</p>
<p>so robert is</p>
<p>still considered</p>
<p>a person of interest but they don&rsquo;t have any confession</p>
<p>or hard evidence</p>
<p>linking him to the case</p>
<p>so until then the case</p>
<p>goes cold once again</p>
<p>great you know</p>
<p>so with no new</p>
<p>solid information or leads</p>
<p>after five years the</p>
<p>cops finally have to stop actively working on the case</p>
<p>the three women were legally</p>
<p>declared dead in june of 1997</p>
<p>even though</p>
<p>their case file</p>
<p>still considers them to be missing yeah</p>
<p>super sad there&rsquo;s nothing there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>so weird so years go by</p>
<p>and then in 2007 there&rsquo;s a journalist</p>
<p>named kathy</p>
<p>bared anyway she gets a tip from someone</p>
<p>who either claimed to be a psychic</p>
<p>or claimed to have like had a vision or a dream</p>
<p>about the springfield iii case</p>
<p>she said that the</p>
<p>three missing</p>
<p>women were buried in the</p>
<p>foundation of the</p>
<p>south parking garage</p>
<p>at cox hospital</p>
<p>mmm her vision told her this</p>
<p>so back in 1992</p>
<p>when the women went missing</p>
<p>this parking</p>
<p>structure at the hospital</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>built yet it was just a big lot of dirt</p>
<p>she shares this information with investigators</p>
<p>but they pretty much just</p>
<p>laugh in her face</p>
<p>and they say something like there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>what are we</p>
<p>gonna do like tear up all the parking</p>
<p>structure you know</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like well</p>
<p>are you wanna do anything</p>
<p>about it and they&rsquo;re telling her like no</p>
<p>if they are there they&rsquo;re buried by a</p>
<p>ton of cement and we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to go like blow up a parking</p>
<p>structure just</p>
<p>because a psychic said so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what police are saying</p>
<p>well kathy she</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just let go of this tip she needs to know</p>
<p>if this tip is</p>
<p>right she needs closure</p>
<p>like i get it girl</p>
<p>we would all be like wait no</p>
<p>i need to investigate myself then</p>
<p>so she hires a</p>
<p>mechanical engineer</p>
<p>to use a ground penetrating</p>
<p>radar to scan the parking garage</p>
<p>floor and see if anything</p>
<p>turns up now she&rsquo;s recording this guy i guess</p>
<p>and this guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>using his machine and he</p>
<p>says that he&rsquo;s getting two images that are parallel</p>
<p>in one spot</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s another like a</p>
<p>third nearby that&rsquo;s perpendicular</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and then kathy she gets</p>
<p>super excited and</p>
<p>she goes over to the guy she hired and she tells him</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m working on a missing persons case</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s very casually like oh yeah that&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>because like this is exactly what i see on my radar</p>
<p>when i go over old graves</p>
<p>huh well this parking garage it wasn&rsquo;t built</p>
<p>until a year</p>
<p>after the women went missing so in theory</p>
<p>the bodies should</p>
<p>have turned up during an excavation when they actually</p>
<p>started to build the garage</p>
<p>right kathy</p>
<p>goes to police</p>
<p>and tells him that she also records the guy</p>
<p>doing it so she</p>
<p>could show police like look at what he</p>
<p>found i hired him</p>
<p>this is what he&rsquo;s saying blah</p>
<p>blah please tell kathy</p>
<p>that the radar</p>
<p>scans aren&rsquo;t enough for them to demolish the garage</p>
<p>they still need more evidence so kathy</p>
<p>starts doing some more digging and then</p>
<p>strangely she just stops</p>
<p>now there was a podcast this girl&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda weird</p>
<p>this don&rsquo;t get too</p>
<p>excited okay</p>
<p>because there was</p>
<p>a podcast who was doing an episode on the springfield 3</p>
<p>and they interviewed kathy</p>
<p>was it a podcast</p>
<p>no i think it was a youtube</p>
<p>video and they interview kathy</p>
<p>about the radar scan in her investigation</p>
<p>and in the interview she mentions that she</p>
<p>thinks she knows what happened</p>
<p>and unfortunately</p>
<p>stacy was just collateral damage</p>
<p>in the scenario she gets</p>
<p>god what&rsquo;s the word cryptic i</p>
<p>guess herself and she gets</p>
<p>super tense</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s awkward and uncomfortable</p>
<p>cause the interviewer</p>
<p>presses her for more information</p>
<p>about who the real</p>
<p>target was and</p>
<p>cathy says that</p>
<p>she gets all uncomfortable she&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to talk about that</p>
<p>and then she goes on to say like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been advised</p>
<p>to leave this case</p>
<p>alone and i&rsquo;m afraid for my safety</p>
<p>and then she goes on to say a little bit more</p>
<p>but kathy said that she</p>
<p>would not leave this case alone</p>
<p>until she had</p>
<p>solid proof of who did</p>
<p>it okay look in the interview she&rsquo;s giving off the vibe</p>
<p>that she knows who did it</p>
<p>that i can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about it because</p>
<p>i will be murdered next and she&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>super again cryptic</p>
<p>like she knows</p>
<p>and then in the interview she even</p>
<p>goes on to say that she knows who was responsible</p>
<p>but that she won&rsquo;t give up the information</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s solved</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like girl</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t solve the mystery</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>up the information</p>
<p>as to who did it but you&rsquo;re on national tv</p>
<p>it just kind of seemed like she</p>
<p>i hate to say it i hate to say it girl i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry but it kind of seems like she was doing</p>
<p>whole interview and</p>
<p>stuff for attention</p>
<p>because why</p>
<p>would you do</p>
<p>an interview if you know all the information</p>
<p>go to police like what are you doing on this interview</p>
<p>alluding that you know but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not gonna say anything like why are you here then</p>
<p>why are you wasting our damn time</p>
<p>it just seemed a little</p>
<p>self serving</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know she</p>
<p>might be onto something with the parking garage area</p>
<p>but police they felt like her timeline didn&rsquo;t add up</p>
<p>and i couldn&rsquo;t find a straight answer</p>
<p>as to why they didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>search more into this tip that to me</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense i mean i</p>
<p>understand that blowing up a parking garage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably a headache but</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t you supposed to</p>
<p>solve some mysteries</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to do i don&rsquo;t know i didn&rsquo;t like that lady</p>
<p>but i just was</p>
<p>gonna mention it because</p>
<p>she is mentioned a lot of the time in this story</p>
<p>she acts like she knows something</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t like her i don&rsquo;t get good vibes</p>
<p>so since then</p>
<p>there have only</p>
<p>been two more leads that didn&rsquo;t really pan out</p>
<p>all that much</p>
<p>and then in 2002</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>lead of a similar looking van that was spotted when the</p>
<p>three went missing</p>
<p>so cops went to</p>
<p>a concrete company</p>
<p>where the van was spotted</p>
<p>and they brought</p>
<p>cadaver dogs with them and the dogs did find some bones</p>
<p>i know but then testing</p>
<p>reports came back saying that the bones were too old</p>
<p>to be the women</p>
<p>so great now they saw</p>
<p>someone else&rsquo;s mystery i guess</p>
<p>i hope they circle back on that one</p>
<p>and then in 2003 a tip leads investigators to a farm</p>
<p>about an hour away from springfield and</p>
<p>after some digging police find possible</p>
<p>blood evidence</p>
<p>and a piece of a</p>
<p>vehicle that</p>
<p>maybe could be part of the van that was seen</p>
<p>so police are</p>
<p>excited and immediately they sent</p>
<p>the blood to the lab for testing</p>
<p>but it came back inconclusive</p>
<p>so they just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>catch a break it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird because it seems like they do want to</p>
<p>solve this case</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying but then with the concrete thing</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>solve they don&rsquo;t want to do that though i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe they just don&rsquo;t find her credible</p>
<p>that lady anywho</p>
<p>this case is</p>
<p>still ongoing</p>
<p>and hopefully one day we&rsquo;ll know what happened to</p>
<p>these three ladies</p>
<p>springfield three</p>
<p>they just freaking</p>
<p>disappeared</p>
<p>and nobody knows</p>
<p>anything it&rsquo;s just bizarre</p>
<p>i spent so much time</p>
<p>on this one like looking around just trying to look for</p>
<p>you just want something</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing a couple of</p>
<p>things one was it</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s boyfriend the bad boy</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s a motive there</p>
<p>i guess at one</p>
<p>point it was mentioned like oh i</p>
<p>would kill her</p>
<p>from the boyfriend</p>
<p>because he was so mad that she rat him out</p>
<p>and honestly like that makes the most</p>
<p>sense right the boyfriend and like the the</p>
<p>grave diggers</p>
<p>if any if any of them that</p>
<p>seems like the</p>
<p>thing but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing and this is</p>
<p>my theory i don&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>who am i exactly</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just in youtube box but um</p>
<p>people like to talk you know</p>
<p>people love talking</p>
<p>they love sharing stories</p>
<p>they love sharing</p>
<p>secrets oh yes</p>
<p>you love sharing a</p>
<p>secret don&rsquo;t lie don&rsquo;t lie</p>
<p>secret you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna tell someone</p>
<p>so if it was the boyfriend and the gang of friends</p>
<p>there was like</p>
<p>five or six of them chances are</p>
<p>one of them</p>
<p>would say something right</p>
<p>one of them</p>
<p>would open their</p>
<p>mouth chicken out confess</p>
<p>live with regret</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no way they</p>
<p>would all keep</p>
<p>their mouth</p>
<p>shut for this long you know so that&rsquo;s kind of why i was</p>
<p>thinking maybe it&rsquo;s not them</p>
<p>because i cannot believe that they</p>
<p>would keep the</p>
<p>secret for this long</p>
<p>they would someone</p>
<p>would crack by now</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know it</p>
<p>could be i mean</p>
<p>again they have</p>
<p>the motive and all that it totally makes</p>
<p>sense maybe they did keep the</p>
<p>secret for this song</p>
<p>but then i was</p>
<p>thinking i was marinating on this a little bit</p>
<p>and i was like okay</p>
<p>so everyone seemed to know or be aware</p>
<p>that the kids were</p>
<p>graduating high</p>
<p>school that weekend</p>
<p>remember graduation</p>
<p>means parties</p>
<p>kids doing stuff</p>
<p>kids hanging out at</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s houses</p>
<p>just not home whatever</p>
<p>so my thought was</p>
<p>or is or i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is that the killer</p>
<p>or whoever was</p>
<p>knew that the girls were not</p>
<p>going to be home that</p>
<p>night susie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and it</p>
<p>would just be mom</p>
<p>by herself at the home because the kids</p>
<p>remember they were originally</p>
<p>gonna stay at janelle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house well first they were</p>
<p>gonna stay at the hotel</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna stay at janelle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and they didn&rsquo;t tell their mom</p>
<p>that they were coming home so mom</p>
<p>she seemed outgoing</p>
<p>and it kind of almost seems like</p>
<p>maybe wrong</p>
<p>place wrong time</p>
<p>like the two girls were supposed to stay the</p>
<p>night at the</p>
<p>hotel originally</p>
<p>they had their friends</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be home</p>
<p>so mom is back at the house</p>
<p>okay maybe she invites a lone ranger over to the house</p>
<p>since the kids are away and</p>
<p>this visitor</p>
<p>parks in the driveway</p>
<p>in the spot that</p>
<p>the daughter always</p>
<p>parked in remember in the beginning when i described</p>
<p>susie and her</p>
<p>friends had said that she had like ocd tendencies</p>
<p>okay well it was said that susie</p>
<p>always parked in the same</p>
<p>exact spot at her</p>
<p>house when she</p>
<p>arrived there okay</p>
<p>but then that day when janelle</p>
<p>went to the</p>
<p>house she noted that</p>
<p>susie&rsquo;s car was not parked</p>
<p>where it normally is and that was like</p>
<p>major it was</p>
<p>something that she obviously remembered like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird so the thought is</p>
<p>what if somebody was at the</p>
<p>house and was parked in the spot that the</p>
<p>daughter would always park in</p>
<p>right so susie pulls up and was like oh</p>
<p>weird someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in my spot i&rsquo;ll just park here behind my mom</p>
<p>and then stacy</p>
<p>followed her</p>
<p>and parked behind her</p>
<p>cause there was</p>
<p>three cards there mom</p>
<p>susie stacey</p>
<p>or something like that</p>
<p>maybe someone was parked in her spot</p>
<p>somebody was hanging out with mom</p>
<p>okay maybe mom was at the</p>
<p>house the visitor is at the</p>
<p>house and the two girls come home that</p>
<p>night totally unplanned</p>
<p>oh no they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>supposed to be here they&rsquo;re supposed to be whatever now</p>
<p>this killer this bad person&rsquo;s like shit i</p>
<p>gotta get rid of all</p>
<p>three of these people now not just</p>
<p>cheryl or whatever you know</p>
<p>and my thought is that</p>
<p>whoever it was</p>
<p>it was a super random hit</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s like no</p>
<p>trace back to anyone</p>
<p>because it was someone</p>
<p>random or completely new</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s why nobody</p>
<p>has solved it that&rsquo;s my thought because</p>
<p>people again love to talk</p>
<p>somebody would have said something</p>
<p>unless it was someone who was</p>
<p>completely new</p>
<p>and not around</p>
<p>and just left and nobody knew this</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i obviously am not solving any mysteries but like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hmm i&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>i hate unsolve stories you know you just want closure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so sad like</p>
<p>weird i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i would love to hear your guys theories down below</p>
<p>let me know in the comment section what you guys think</p>
<p>but other than that is</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s really sad story</p>
<p>three just go missing like damn</p>
<p>scary anyways</p>
<p>thank you guys so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day</p>
<p>a great week</p>
<p>ahead and i&rsquo;ll be seeing you very soon</p>
<p>make good choices</p>
<p>be safe and</p>
<p>i love you okay bye</p>
<p>my foot fell asleep oh</p>
