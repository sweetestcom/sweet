<p>uh from west virginia are you there</p>
<p>weston</p>

<p>let&rsquo;s try another call okay let&rsquo;s try um</p>
<p>esther from oklahoma are you there</p>
<p>it sounds like it&rsquo;s uh it needs to be</p>
<p>retested or</p>
<p>something with my could be something</p>
<p>with my</p>
<p>microphone</p>
<p>okay i have facebook but i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>youtube here</p>
<p>what about jason from santa barbara</p>
<p>okay all right i&rsquo;ll let these guys fix</p>
<p>that so</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re going to jump right into a quiz</p>
<p>guys because um</p>
<p>i have some questions to see if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on top of things</p>
<p>so the first question</p>
<p>is you know it&rsquo;s all related to vitamin</p>
<p>d vitamin d is</p>
<p>just so so powerful for the immune</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>and other things but i have a question</p>
<p>for you and the question is</p>
<p>what has more vitamin d herring</p>
<p>or salmon all right</p>
<p>i hope the answer&rsquo;s salmon well karen</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to find out</p>
<p>once we see the answers there right now</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have youtube coming up here</p>
<p>steve</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s showing okay but i have</p>
<p>facebook</p>
<p>okay in the meantime while we&rsquo;re letting</p>
<p>these answers come up</p>
<p>is it okay to take vitamin c on an empty</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>yeah in fact it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s a water</p>
<p>soluble vitamin it&rsquo;s not fat soluble so</p>
<p>yes you can it&rsquo;s better to take the fat</p>
<p>soluble when you eat something but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a necessity so</p>
<p>like the fat cell would be vitamin a</p>
<p>d e k okay k1 and k2</p>
<p>you want to take those like with food</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>um the d3 and k2 that i have and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>biased</p>
<p>has some bile pure5 bile salts</p>
<p>so it helps the absorption much better</p>
<p>and especially if you have anything</p>
<p>going on with the liver or sluggish</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>but you know the thing that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to consume with vitamin c</p>
<p>which i know won&rsquo;t be a problem for a</p>
<p>hundred percent of our viewers is you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to consume any sugar</p>
<p>because when you eat sugar it competes</p>
<p>the chemistry vitamin c is very similar</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>sugar so sugar in your body you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to absorb vitamin c</p>
<p>so that is what&rsquo;s going on let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>can is weston are you there weston does</p>
<p>that does it work yet</p>
<p>all right hey yeah can you hear me yeah</p>
<p>i can hear you perfectly</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;ve been on healthy keto for a year</p>
<p>and out of nowhere for the last three</p>
<p>months i&rsquo;ve been experiencing extreme</p>
<p>fatigue</p>
<p>body aches loss of appetite brain fog</p>
<p>but um sometimes i feel okay for a few</p>
<p>hours but then i&rsquo;ll start feeling</p>
<p>exhausted so i had a previous infection</p>
<p>of ebv count like it was high but my</p>
<p>blood work doesn&rsquo;t indicate that i have</p>
<p>an active infection could this still be</p>
<p>related to</p>
<p>the epstein-barr virus good question i</p>
<p>have a question for you though</p>
<p>are you finding that potentially you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not out in the sun</p>
<p>very much and you&rsquo;re not really taking</p>
<p>vitamin d is that a possibility</p>
<p>i take 10 15 000 i use the vitamin d but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been going outside because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been stuck in the house because i feel</p>
<p>so bad</p>
<p>okay what about zinc are you taking</p>
<p>anything</p>
<p>30 milligrams of zinc by glycinate</p>
<p>chelate</p>
<p>okay good so you&rsquo;re good on that um what</p>
<p>about are you under</p>
<p>any type of stress yes extremely</p>
<p>okay um because here&rsquo;s the thing and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna just kind of</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna put you on um silent i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>tell you what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>which i think um epstein-barr virus</p>
<p>is the virus that can go into um</p>
<p>remission</p>
<p>goes dormant it&rsquo;s called latent and it</p>
<p>just goes into this state where it just</p>
<p>kind of sits there and it waits</p>
<p>until you go through stress or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>nutritionally deficient</p>
<p>but i will say stress is the number one</p>
<p>thing that will put that virus and kind</p>
<p>of reactivate it</p>
<p>and maybe not even a full activation as</p>
<p>an infection</p>
<p>but activating it enough so some of</p>
<p>those viruses</p>
<p>are creating some problem with your</p>
<p>immune system</p>
<p>creating more histamines and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>experiencing fatigue</p>
<p>so one of the things real simple way to</p>
<p>do this is to</p>
<p>isolate the exact stress do whatever you</p>
<p>can to improve it</p>
<p>and i think you&rsquo;re going to feel much</p>
<p>much better now</p>
<p>many people experience the epstein-barr</p>
<p>virus after like they have mono</p>
<p>in high school something like that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a this is just an acupressure</p>
<p>thing that helps relieve stress and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been</p>
<p>very beneficial to reduce the body</p>
<p>stress and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s classified under</p>
<p>on my youtube channel</p>
<p>but you would want to do the acupressure</p>
<p>on the upper part of the neck</p>
<p>and then the lower part of the neck and</p>
<p>that seems just to reduce a lot of</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>in the upper part of your body it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just feel like a good relief you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>sleep better</p>
<p>but yes that virus definitely can create</p>
<p>an immune reaction and</p>
<p>keep you in a state of fatigue for sure</p>
<p>so that is my advice find the location</p>
<p>of the stress and</p>
<p>kind of do what you can to improve it</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see if esther is</p>
<p>available</p>
<p>uh from oklahoma are you there yes</p>
<p>i am can you hear me yes hi how are you</p>
<p>great how are you</p>
<p>good good to see you guys back yeah</p>
<p>and i an</p>
<p>issue with i just did a black test uh</p>
<p>about 10 days ago and my segmentation</p>
<p>rate was 38 my theory active was</p>
<p>2.8 you hear me</p>
<p>yeah yes and the last time i spoke to</p>
<p>you you</p>
<p>i asked you about carnivore diet and you</p>
<p>said why don&rsquo;t you go ahead and try it</p>
<p>for a month and i started it a week ago</p>
<p>this saturday my issue is</p>
<p>i cannot eat as much meat as they say</p>
<p>i should i can hardly eat beyond</p>
<p>13 ounces or 12 ounces anyways less than</p>
<p>a pound</p>
<p>and the other thing is i&rsquo;m reading a</p>
<p>book by dr sean baker about</p>
<p>a carnival diet and he says the</p>
<p>carnivore diet is not for</p>
<p>weight loss it&rsquo;s for being healthy</p>
<p>and i have lost 45 pounds</p>
<p>with keto and i don&rsquo;t want to gain back</p>
<p>and i need your advice so i keep on</p>
<p>losing weight while i&rsquo;m getting rid of</p>
<p>this inflammation</p>
<p>okay i mean sean baker is a um</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a medical doctor he recommends the</p>
<p>carnivore diet which is</p>
<p>great i i recommend it if you have any</p>
<p>type of</p>
<p>inflammatory digestive issues maybe sibo</p>
<p>for a period of time but the</p>
<p>the version of keto that i recommend has</p>
<p>been working so nicely</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not going to change it or recommend</p>
<p>something else but it&rsquo;s a healthy</p>
<p>version of keto were you doing</p>
<p>plant-based vegetables</p>
<p>not grains and also high quality protein</p>
<p>meats and things like that so a</p>
<p>combination of both now</p>
<p>as far as your situation i think that</p>
<p>you definitely if you&rsquo;ve been doing it a</p>
<p>week and a half that&rsquo;s great i would</p>
<p>continue to do a little longer</p>
<p>but as far as inflammation goes the best</p>
<p>bet for that</p>
<p>honestly is to increase</p>
<p>beef up no pun intended your vitamin d</p>
<p>levels</p>
<p>okay so take more vitamin d for pain in</p>
<p>your knees</p>
<p>and your shoulders because that is the</p>
<p>topic of it today and i think that will</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>reduce your c-reactive protein</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re set you&rsquo;ll help your sed rate</p>
<p>so try that</p>
<p>and be very strict</p>
<p>with your carbs okay thanks very much</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go right to the answers karen</p>
<p>what are people um</p>
<p>is it going to be salmon or</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of 50 50. really i&rsquo;m gonna say</p>
<p>uh youtube answered way more than the</p>
<p>guys on on facebook this morning</p>
<p>i think facebook was more salmon</p>
<p>but a lot fewer answers youtube guys</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>uh 50 50. so what would you guess i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go with what i&rsquo;m really hoping</p>
<p>which is salmon okay and then if you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t hoping what would you go with if</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hoping i would still say salmon</p>
<p>and if you wanted to pick another answer</p>
<p>and if i went</p>
<p>with um the answer i thought or hoped it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be i would definitely say</p>
<p>herring</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right yes all right awesome so</p>
<p>the answer is herring so herring has a</p>
<p>bit more vitamin d but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay salmon also has a tremendous</p>
<p>amount of vitamin d</p>
<p>so both are going to be fine it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the fattier</p>
<p>the fattier the fish the better okay and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to roll right into it</p>
<p>amsterdam is a fattier fish than salmon</p>
<p>amsterdam i mean i&rsquo;m sorry i just read</p>
<p>hamstring</p>
<p>i was like i&rsquo;ve heard about that fish</p>
<p>herring</p>
<p>wow that just yes circuits well i&rsquo;m with</p>
<p>karen because</p>
<p>salmon is the only fish i&rsquo;ll walk by in</p>
<p>the kitchen and pick off more and just</p>
<p>eat it</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s so good like snack cake</p>
<p>but i never thought herring or amsterdam</p>
<p>was fatty yeah it&rsquo;s a fatty country um</p>
<p>but what happens is that you have um</p>
<p>wow you have certain amounts of</p>
<p>you know the fat soluble vitamins are in</p>
<p>the fat so um</p>
<p>you want fattier things so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>well i think i just blew it i blew the</p>
<p>coi i blew the next question</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to ask it anyway maybe no one</p>
<p>heard me no it&rsquo;s okay there was so much</p>
<p>going on you should ask me a question</p>
<p>anyway all right here&rsquo;s the question is</p>
<p>there any significant vitamin d</p>
<p>in cod fish yes or no</p>
<p>cod fish yeah you didn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>cod i know i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so is the question is is there any</p>
<p>significant vitamin d in cud</p>
<p>fish okay and while you are answering</p>
<p>that uh let&rsquo;s go to jason</p>
<p>well we haven&rsquo;t asked a single social</p>
<p>media question</p>
<p>oh okay go ahead huh these guys are</p>
<p>waiting</p>
<p>here right i know there&rsquo;s a lot more of</p>
<p>those questions i know</p>
<p>karen&rsquo;s got your back i i&rsquo;ve got your</p>
<p>back amsterdam</p>
<p>okay so is it okay to do no protein on</p>
<p>keto</p>
<p>uh no it&rsquo;s not okay because um what are</p>
<p>you gonna do about your</p>
<p>your requirements for your own</p>
<p>replacement of your</p>
<p>your muscles all the protein</p>
<p>interactions the chemistry</p>
<p>uh hormones and then the repair</p>
<p>what are you going to do about that if</p>
<p>you have no protein and keto now i think</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>is it okay to do no animal protein on</p>
<p>keto</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more difficult it&rsquo;s more difficult</p>
<p>as possible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a lot more difficult so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my answer on that</p>
<p>fair enough here&rsquo;s the next one what are</p>
<p>some other signs of a fatty liver other</p>
<p>than a belly</p>
<p>what if you don&rsquo;t have a belly does that</p>
<p>mean you then absolutely you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>fatty liver no</p>
<p>no because it could be hidden it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>deep down inside there so</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s really really difficult to pick</p>
<p>up a fatty liver until certain stages</p>
<p>until it like gets in a major way</p>
<p>because you can have a</p>
<p>you know a good portion of the liver</p>
<p>fatty and not even know it</p>
<p>so i would say the other way is also do</p>
<p>an ultrasound</p>
<p>that would be a good way um but another</p>
<p>way is just to</p>
<p>if you have symptoms of</p>
<p>insulin resistance and the other way is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing carbs we know you have a</p>
<p>fatty liver if you&rsquo;re doing a lot of</p>
<p>carbs on a regular basis</p>
<p>eventually it&rsquo;s going to be converted</p>
<p>into fat and</p>
<p>kind of spill over i mean if you think</p>
<p>about it to have</p>
<p>even a fat in your belly what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>spill over from your blood into your</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s filling up with fat and then it</p>
<p>spills over into the organs around the</p>
<p>organs</p>
<p>so you might kind of look in the mirror</p>
<p>and go i have a big belly it&rsquo;s fine but</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;re getting all</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>extra uh storage and it&rsquo;s your body is</p>
<p>stuffing it here and there because</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t want it in the blood so the</p>
<p>blood might be fine but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being stored in other places in your</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>okay good uh and then speaking of grains</p>
<p>is it okay if someone is a long distance</p>
<p>runner</p>
<p>is it okay to add some grains into your</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t recommend grains</p>
<p>under any circumstances</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a long distance runner and you</p>
<p>want to add some carbs i would do</p>
<p>probably berries and maybe</p>
<p>sweet potato but i would definitely stay</p>
<p>away from the carbs</p>
<p>you might say well what about brown rice</p>
<p>well what about brown rice</p>
<p>well the broth good question the brown</p>
<p>rice</p>
<p>apparently has been found to have higher</p>
<p>levels of arsenic</p>
<p>and also the phytates in the brown rice</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like a whole rice</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a phytate phytate is is a</p>
<p>chemical</p>
<p>that locks up certain things in that</p>
<p>seed</p>
<p>that then can create a difficulty in</p>
<p>absorption of zinc</p>
<p>so when you have food that have the</p>
<p>fiber with it like the whole grains or</p>
<p>brown rice and that&rsquo;s going to block</p>
<p>your ability to absorb</p>
<p>zinc and you&rsquo;re going to show zinc</p>
<p>deficiencies and</p>
<p>zinc is kind of important when your</p>
<p>immune system is trying to work</p>
<p>right so all right</p>
<p>so what do we have for the answers to</p>
<p>all the the question which is</p>
<p>does cod fish have any significant</p>
<p>amounts of vitamin d</p>
<p>so again it&rsquo;s a mixed bag yes and no yes</p>
<p>a lot</p>
<p>no it doesn&rsquo;t cod liver oil has</p>
<p>d no we&rsquo;re not talking about cod liver</p>
<p>oil ah talk about cod fish</p>
<p>cod fish the actual fish i</p>
<p>see so these guys some of these guys</p>
<p>jumped right to cod liver oil</p>
<p>yeah no no we&rsquo;re not talking about so</p>
<p>just the fish all right well why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you tell us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no it is very almost insignificant</p>
<p>amounts of vitamin d</p>
<p>wow so if i was going to the fish fry</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to do the cod i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do the cod if i was looking to get my</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>from that fish no you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>get any see the thing is like people</p>
<p>have this idea that well i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>have a</p>
<p>lean fish and like even like trouts lean</p>
<p>unless they do like</p>
<p>maybe some farm raised that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>enhanced with vitamin d</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not going to see significant</p>
<p>vitamin d from those fish and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the benefits of fish is</p>
<p>the vitamin d the vitamin a</p>
<p>would you want raised anyway no you want</p>
<p>wild caught</p>
<p>right so you you know now the next</p>
<p>question is</p>
<p>what about all the toxins what about</p>
<p>mercury okay</p>
<p>well these fatty fish just happen to</p>
<p>coincidentally have lots of</p>
<p>selenium and selenium is the buffer it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the counter measure to the mercury so</p>
<p>if that hasn&rsquo;t it has a little bit more</p>
<p>selenium which it does then mercury</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>totally fine and the benefits of that</p>
<p>fish are just huge</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>so yes i have some more interesting</p>
<p>questions coming up so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go away um i&rsquo;m going to go to</p>
<p>jason okay</p>
<p>from santa barbara jason are you there</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m here hey what&rsquo;s your question</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>okay my question is uh ken what</p>
<p>uh i want to mix uh i want to try to mix</p>
<p>some of your electrolyte</p>
<p>with apple cider vinegar is that okay or</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been i&rsquo;ve been doing it i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>had any side effects that i know of</p>
<p>but i just can&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t like drinking</p>
<p>it plain it&rsquo;s just too harsh</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve been doing like 16 ounces of</p>
<p>water one scoop of years and i do three</p>
<p>tablespoons apple cider vinegar and i</p>
<p>drink it down</p>
<p>no problem i&rsquo;ve been doing it for a</p>
<p>while so i just don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>well okay i&rsquo;m gonna run with it here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing if you start</p>
<p>twitching underneath the left eyelid no</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be fine jason</p>
<p>grayson that&rsquo;s not a problem at all in</p>
<p>fact um i&rsquo;ve done that before it gives a</p>
<p>lesson a little kick</p>
<p>if you mix the outside of vinegar with</p>
<p>water electrolytes it makes a nice</p>
<p>little drink absolutely</p>
<p>no way will be negative in fact that</p>
<p>acidity will help you absorb these</p>
<p>minerals</p>
<p>a little better so i think you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>the right thing</p>
<p>thanks jason okay so</p>
<p>what do we have karen okay well question</p>
<p>about keto and gout</p>
<p>yeah when you go when especially when</p>
<p>you do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting or even keto</p>
<p>sometimes you may have</p>
<p>a flare-up of gout and i want to talk</p>
<p>about that because</p>
<p>gout comes from the kidney not releasing</p>
<p>and getting rid of uric acid and uric</p>
<p>acid if</p>
<p>can come out of solution and go into the</p>
<p>joints</p>
<p>especially your big toe um</p>
<p>uric acid is also considered an</p>
<p>antioxidant</p>
<p>so you might not realize that but a very</p>
<p>simple way is to if you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>enough</p>
<p>vegetable your ph will go in the right</p>
<p>level it becomes slightly more</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll just prevent some of the</p>
<p>acidity from the keto</p>
<p>because ketones are a bit acid and so</p>
<p>that will actually put that gout in</p>
<p>remission and you might want to even</p>
<p>take</p>
<p>potassium citrate would be a good thing</p>
<p>to take to kind of alkalize</p>
<p>the blood because this gout attack tends</p>
<p>to happen in an acidic</p>
<p>environment in your urine the other</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>when you consume a bit too much protein</p>
<p>that could aggravate the gout situation</p>
<p>and this is but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to run into it if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the healthy version</p>
<p>of what i&rsquo;m talking about right here</p>
<p>which is</p>
<p>keto which is you know it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>protein because</p>
<p>keto is just low carb but we want the</p>
<p>healthy version we want to add all the</p>
<p>nutrients in there as well</p>
<p>um but yeah there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s other things</p>
<p>you can do with gout as well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like vitamin e will help</p>
<p>because like it&rsquo;s loaded with a cool</p>
<p>vitamin an antioxidant</p>
<p>make sure if you do vitamin e do the</p>
<p>tocopherols and the tocotrienols</p>
<p>kevin he looks at me because i can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure i could say if i pres practice</p>
<p>it but</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t i cut your mic off and you</p>
<p>say it so if you blow it no one will</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ll just chuck</p>
<p>um what he said i have another question</p>
<p>go ahead okay so scoliosis</p>
<p>and we were just talking about this um</p>
<p>what</p>
<p>what are some of the causes or what are</p>
<p>you familiar with with regard to</p>
<p>scoliosis and what</p>
<p>could be done in your wheelhouse that</p>
<p>can help</p>
<p>well i think i&rsquo;m going to turn that into</p>
<p>a question because that was one of the</p>
<p>questions that i had</p>
<p>okay um so here&rsquo;s the question guys out</p>
<p>of all the vitamins</p>
<p>which one if it&rsquo;s deficient</p>
<p>is most likely to cause</p>
<p>scoliosis kyphosis lordosis</p>
<p>or any problems all the doses yes with</p>
<p>any type of</p>
<p>spinal malformation i&rsquo;m talking about a</p>
<p>hunchback</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m talking about like a c-curve of your</p>
<p>back</p>
<p>or an excess you know curve in your</p>
<p>lower back where it sways inward</p>
<p>what vitamin deficiency is most likely</p>
<p>to cause those especially</p>
<p>if your mother is deficient in it when</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know carrying you or she&rsquo;s deficient</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>breastfeeding you now you were looking</p>
<p>at me for a long time i was looking over</p>
<p>there karen</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t even looking at you i was</p>
<p>looking at that figure out over there</p>
<p>that came</p>
<p>something you must think something i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking that way</p>
<p>okay so that was a question and as</p>
<p>people are answering the question i want</p>
<p>to go to connie</p>
<p>from michigan are you there connie</p>
<p>michigan</p>
<p>hi hi hi</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your question um i was</p>
<p>just released from the hospital</p>
<p>yesterday</p>
<p>with dehydration low sodium</p>
<p>high phosphorous and high potassium</p>
<p>and diagnosed with stage for chronic</p>
<p>kidney disease and i wanted to know what</p>
<p>i can do to prevent it going any further</p>
<p>to stage five</p>
<p>okay um yeah you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re stuck between</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>rock and a hard place because it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just jump right into the keto diet</p>
<p>because we recommend</p>
<p>lots of potassium and if you have a</p>
<p>later stage</p>
<p>kidney problem and the doctors will tell</p>
<p>you this so you want to ask your doctor</p>
<p>about this</p>
<p>what minerals do you have or what</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals you have to avoid</p>
<p>as much as possible because your body is</p>
<p>going to retain them</p>
<p>so once you have that data then you need</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>adapt your eating and there are</p>
<p>books out there that you can find even</p>
<p>kindle books that will tell you</p>
<p>what foods are low in certain nutrients</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>unfortunately you need them but your</p>
<p>body just is holding on to them they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting rid of them</p>
<p>i will say though for the rest of the</p>
<p>population</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have advanced kidney disease</p>
<p>potassium is</p>
<p>protective against the kidney so don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be afraid of it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause kidney problems even in large</p>
<p>amounts because your body can release it</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing the most important</p>
<p>thing connie so if you&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>make note of this keeping</p>
<p>the carbs low keeping your carbohydrates</p>
<p>as low as possible</p>
<p>because as soon as the carbs go up okay</p>
<p>your glucose goes up</p>
<p>you lose glucose through the urine and</p>
<p>water follows you become dehydrated</p>
<p>and you you create imbalances the best</p>
<p>support for kidney function is being</p>
<p>doing something</p>
<p>which is the opposite of a diabetic</p>
<p>which is keeping your carbs low</p>
<p>because the sugar is high because</p>
<p>glucose kind of destroys the kidney</p>
<p>also you want to</p>
<p>possibly find some natural</p>
<p>phytonutrients to support kidney</p>
<p>function because you have a lot of</p>
<p>free radicals going on and damage but i</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>i would research what diet you can do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a low potassium and probably low</p>
<p>phosphorus</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s books out on</p>
<p>that okay connie</p>
<p>thanks for your call all right</p>
<p>we had a question did we answer it no</p>
<p>do you remember the question yes it was</p>
<p>the doses question</p>
<p>yes what vitamin deficiency will create</p>
<p>these um back curve typhosis lordosis</p>
<p>and scoliosis okay so we got a variety</p>
<p>of answers i would say</p>
<p>the number one answer is d hmm</p>
<p>what are you doing there were other</p>
<p>things what do you think you said</p>
<p>vitamin right</p>
<p>yes so there other people gave some</p>
<p>minerals</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see i would say</p>
<p>d you are correct karen you are correct</p>
<p>okay so you know for all the d&rsquo;s if you</p>
<p>look</p>
<p>up um research on scoliosis</p>
<p>the causes it&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s coming from</p>
<p>the environment</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;m like what do you mean</p>
<p>environment just bad posture no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>coming from that</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll say that 68 of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>idiopathic</p>
<p>and say oh okay what does that mean it</p>
<p>means unknown cause</p>
<p>and they say well you know partially</p>
<p>genetic but we haven&rsquo;t isolated a gene</p>
<p>yet</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s complex so basically they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a clue they don&rsquo;t know but if you</p>
<p>look</p>
<p>at the definition like the more data on</p>
<p>vitamin d deficiency one of the side</p>
<p>effects would be</p>
<p>scoliosis so um because vitamin d is</p>
<p>necessary in the formation of bones</p>
<p>especially when you are young</p>
<p>and it creates ricketts</p>
<p>what what happens with records you got</p>
<p>your your knees start to be</p>
<p>going inward you have bow legs but you</p>
<p>have your knees can actually knee knock</p>
<p>knocking of the knees you can have um</p>
<p>just problems with your bone formation</p>
<p>in general so</p>
<p>what does all this mean this means that</p>
<p>you need to</p>
<p>the next time you women get pregnant you</p>
<p>need to start taking vitamin d in large</p>
<p>amounts</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re breastfeeding you need to just</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>get a lot of vitamin d now the other</p>
<p>thing if you&rsquo;re an adult</p>
<p>one way to know that you&rsquo;re deficient is</p>
<p>if you have like bone</p>
<p>pain if you were to press on your</p>
<p>sternum right here</p>
<p>and it hurts you might need some or your</p>
<p>shin</p>
<p>press on your shin if it if it&rsquo;s sore</p>
<p>you might need some vitamin d it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good indication because bone pain</p>
<p>a lot of vitamin d also low back pain is</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>um high blood pressure is vitamin d um</p>
<p>depression is vitamin d deficiency</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things related to that</p>
<p>and vitamin d is probably one of the</p>
<p>most important things for your immune</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>which i will be doing a video and one</p>
<p>last little</p>
<p>interesting tidbit karen because i was</p>
<p>going to tell you this when i</p>
<p>woke up this morning that you were still</p>
<p>asleep but um would you love</p>
<p>for me to come i love that every morning</p>
<p>i come in and i have something to</p>
<p>teach karen but she&rsquo;s like could you</p>
<p>wait a little bit can you wait till i</p>
<p>wake up every minute i open my eyes</p>
<p>and he says did you realize that during</p>
<p>the black</p>
<p>the black plague right or did you know</p>
<p>that the</p>
<p>mitochondrial blah blah blah like this</p>
<p>well i have a question for you guys do</p>
<p>you mind sharing with us how much</p>
<p>vitamin d your</p>
<p>d2k whatever i take it i take two of</p>
<p>those a day how much do you take</p>
<p>see here&rsquo;s the thing i would take like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking 20 000 ius totally fine</p>
<p>i like that that&rsquo;s what i take if anyone</p>
<p>says oh yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too much just ask them for a reference</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t be able to find it</p>
<p>there is no problem like when you get up</p>
<p>into maybe 150</p>
<p>000 ius which no one&rsquo;s taking that much</p>
<p>there could potentially be</p>
<p>um a side effect of hypercalcemia which</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>could be a kidney stone but that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>rare and if you&rsquo;re drinking enough water</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to happen</p>
<p>so but i do want to kind of complete the</p>
<p>one little thing i was i was going to</p>
<p>tell you about this</p>
<p>this black plague you know they they</p>
<p>found</p>
<p>since in the topic they actually found</p>
<p>some um</p>
<p>graves um unmarked graves in northern</p>
<p>london and they found this was from the</p>
<p>year</p>
<p>1364 or</p>
<p>it was either that or right around that</p>
<p>year and uh</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how they determine that and</p>
<p>so they found that</p>
<p>that was at uh a burial site where they</p>
<p>um from the black plague and</p>
<p>they looked at these skeletons and there</p>
<p>was a very</p>
<p>large percentage of people who had</p>
<p>rickets which is fascinating and they</p>
<p>had terrible teeth</p>
<p>and that that&rsquo;s actually a vitamin d</p>
<p>deficiency which</p>
<p>which makes sense because if you have</p>
<p>this vitamin</p>
<p>this huge systemic or this huge pandemic</p>
<p>of vitamin d deficiency</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be very susceptible to</p>
<p>getting you know all sorts of infections</p>
<p>and so i think and i just released a</p>
<p>video recently i think we have a</p>
<p>pandemic of vitamin d</p>
<p>74 percent of the population worldwide</p>
<p>has a vitamin d deficiency which is a</p>
<p>primer for you know having an infections</p>
<p>you know or epidemic so anyway i just</p>
<p>want to point out that</p>
<p>interesting piece of information karen</p>
<p>if you wanted to know interesting</p>
<p>okay good good all right sandy from</p>
<p>texas had a question are you there sandy</p>
<p>hi guys i&rsquo;m so glad to talk to you guys</p>
<p>i want to thank you for</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve done for me i was 270</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 185 with that pizza recipe</p>
<p>awesome awesome just love it</p>
<p>thank you that pizza&rsquo;s wonderful my</p>
<p>question is this</p>
<p>um i had to get an emergency</p>
<p>hysterectomy at 38 years old and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 51 now and i&rsquo;m just wondering</p>
<p>like the menopause so far from 38 to 51</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m kind of handling it pretty good they</p>
<p>gave me</p>
<p>zoloft and blood pressure medicine now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>the doctor when i go in she&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>lost a lot of weight do you want to get</p>
<p>off your</p>
<p>blood pressure and your zoloft and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>kind of excited want to</p>
<p>kind of scared too i know a lot of girls</p>
<p>are doing</p>
<p>hormones and all kinds of stuff at my</p>
<p>age and with the exercise and eating</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>and you know a lot of prayer i&rsquo;m working</p>
<p>on it</p>
<p>my mom says she still has menopause and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s 80. so it&rsquo;s obviously it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going to continue</p>
<p>but i was wondering um do you recommend</p>
<p>anything besides the zoloft that seems</p>
<p>to be the thing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m kind of like don&rsquo;t know if uh</p>
<p>anything that you could suggest that uh</p>
<p>for me</p>
<p>yeah i think i would totally agree with</p>
<p>your doctor you should come off those</p>
<p>medications and i would also</p>
<p>um recommend that you take the b</p>
<p>vitamins</p>
<p>um nutritional yeast is a good source</p>
<p>but take a lot more b vitamins and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find that your mood is</p>
<p>going to come up with the vitamin d</p>
<p>both of those together will help to</p>
<p>replace what you&rsquo;ve been taking but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing great test the waters and</p>
<p>see how you do</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s great that your doctor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recommending that you come off</p>
<p>the medication i mean that&rsquo;s not our</p>
<p>our area to tell you what to do about</p>
<p>medications but it&rsquo;s always i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always a great sign when you have a</p>
<p>medical doctor</p>
<p>that is actually looking at your body</p>
<p>and looking at your</p>
<p>vitals and and everything that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on and says hey how about we take you</p>
<p>off something</p>
<p>no matter what it is i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome you have a good doctor</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s if you could find um a</p>
<p>product a standard process</p>
<p>just look that up and there&rsquo;s a product</p>
<p>called utrophin utrophin</p>
<p>pmg it&rsquo;s called get some of that as well</p>
<p>take about two maybe three before bed</p>
<p>and i used to use that when i was in</p>
<p>practice it&rsquo;s a great product for</p>
<p>women that had a hysterectomy okay</p>
<p>so i think that should help you sandy</p>
<p>thanks for your call</p>
<p>all right i have an itch karen at my</p>
<p>nose okay sometimes you just gotta</p>
<p>scratch the edge</p>
<p>sort of i won&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s a saying right</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay so</p>
<p>i i lost the name here but</p>
<p>someone wrote in that they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>frustrated</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been on keto for one week</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not losing a lot of weight</p>
<p>which means they&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>some weight the very first week on keto</p>
<p>yeah what do you say to that this is why</p>
<p>we call you a patient because you must</p>
<p>have patience and we put you in a</p>
<p>waiting room because you have to</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a waiting process but um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real good principle that you</p>
<p>need to know and that is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about losing weight getting</p>
<p>healthy it&rsquo;s getting healthy</p>
<p>first if you really understand that and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>health being one of the most important</p>
<p>indicators first is your</p>
<p>hunger goes away your cravings go away</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>realize how long you had this problem</p>
<p>this does take a process to correct</p>
<p>uh i&rsquo;m surprised that you&rsquo;re losing any</p>
<p>weight in the first week a lot of times</p>
<p>right you don&rsquo;t lose anything so what i</p>
<p>would do</p>
<p>i would maybe if you really want to</p>
<p>speed things up</p>
<p>you know just reduce your carbs even</p>
<p>more fast</p>
<p>longer and you will you&rsquo;ll do fine</p>
<p>but your body will go after the fat loss</p>
<p>around your liver first you might not</p>
<p>see it</p>
<p>so you know focus on the health your</p>
<p>energy</p>
<p>inflammation and with that karen</p>
<p>i have the next question for people okay</p>
<p>all right go ahead</p>
<p>okay what plant source</p>
<p>will give you the most vitamin d</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry i was listening to steve</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine i was asking everyone here</p>
<p>you go ahead i&rsquo;m back now go ahead what</p>
<p>ask again i was distracted</p>
<p>i like that when you&rsquo;re talking to</p>
<p>someone like i&rsquo;m sorry i wasn&rsquo;t painting</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t listening</p>
<p>at all i heard steve and terry howling</p>
<p>over there and i thought</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the question what plant source</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>uh the most vitamin d okay</p>
<p>what kind of plants can you eat to get</p>
<p>vitamin d tell me</p>
<p>very good question okay yes this is a</p>
<p>very good question</p>
<p>all right so now i need to go to susan</p>
<p>from saint paul</p>
<p>are you there yes i am good morning good</p>
<p>morning</p>
<p>my question has to do with i finally</p>
<p>found a doctor who would order</p>
<p>a home ir test for me</p>
<p>and the the</p>
<p>lab results that i got back call it a</p>
<p>serum insulin test which i understand is</p>
<p>not as accurate as a homo ir</p>
<p>and the the measurement on the lab</p>
<p>results were measured in</p>
<p>lowercase u lowercase l capital u</p>
<p>slash lowercase m lowercase l</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m sorry capital l and it says that</p>
<p>the range is 1.9 to 23.0</p>
<p>and mine came back 6.7</p>
<p>which according to this test tells me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s low</p>
<p>but when i went online to investigate</p>
<p>houma ir</p>
<p>their measurements were not the same as</p>
<p>the measurements they gave me and</p>
<p>according to what i&rsquo;ve read online</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m actually very um insulin resistant</p>
<p>and i need to know how to</p>
<p>interpret this because i&rsquo;m going to see</p>
<p>her again this month</p>
<p>okay susan so there&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really not a lot of agreement on</p>
<p>what normal</p>
<p>is so people</p>
<p>that i study medical professionals in</p>
<p>the keto</p>
<p>world they recommend to keep</p>
<p>that cla that insulin right around like</p>
<p>two to three</p>
<p>area right there so i wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely</p>
<p>crazy high but i would say you would</p>
<p>strive to get it lower okay</p>
<p>and to do that you just get unhealthy</p>
<p>keto bring your carbs down</p>
<p>do intermittent fasting and just do it</p>
<p>for a longer period of time</p>
<p>and but it&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m glad that you got the</p>
<p>test so now we have a baseline so you</p>
<p>can go back</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say two months from now and retest</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>and probably be a lot better but</p>
<p>insulin resistance does for some people</p>
<p>take a bit of time</p>
<p>to correct that and so an insulin</p>
<p>resistance by itself</p>
<p>will cause a compensatory reaction of</p>
<p>the pancreas to make more insulin so</p>
<p>that could be why you&rsquo;re having this</p>
<p>problem but i&rsquo;m glad that you did get</p>
<p>the test</p>
<p>and now we have a baseline but strive to</p>
<p>get it down to</p>
<p>maybe ideally a two okay</p>
<p>thanks for your question susan all right</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see what people have</p>
<p>said karen okay</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s the dark green leafy greens</p>
<p>category and then there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>specifically kale</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s mushrooms and</p>
<p>flaxseed okay are the primary there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some other</p>
<p>couple of people said spinach is part of</p>
<p>the leafy green</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s some other egg and fish</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one person</p>
<p>avocado okay yeah that egg is an</p>
<p>interesting plant uh</p>
<p>that okay um okay so the answer is</p>
<p>he got you there the answer is</p>
<p>zero there is no vitamin d in plants</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re set up so here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the uh here&rsquo;s some additional</p>
<p>information um</p>
<p>mushrooms or fungus i guess maybe you</p>
<p>can consider that a</p>
<p>plant but i look at it more like a</p>
<p>fungus oh</p>
<p>mushrooms do produce vitamin d2</p>
<p>that has to be converted in your liver</p>
<p>to d3 but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to give you a lot of</p>
<p>vitamin d i&rsquo;ll promise you that</p>
<p>but it does have some plant okay okay</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>then that would be one that has a little</p>
<p>tiny bit some mushroom</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re a vegan and you want to get</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>you could do algae and that does have</p>
<p>vitamin d3</p>
<p>um i guess would that be a plant or as</p>
<p>an algae</p>
<p>any well you know are you sure</p>
<p>or not phylum class order genus species</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somewhere in there i would call it</p>
<p>a plant okay karen</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some biologists did anyone</p>
<p>say algae</p>
<p>not that i saw okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so sun so really yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a nice plant too but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing um you don&rsquo;t have to worry about</p>
<p>plants if you get out in the sun</p>
<p>you know just for the fact that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a lot of vitamin d</p>
<p>if any zero in plant tells us that we</p>
<p>need to have a variety of foods</p>
<p>the ideal you know eating is a variety</p>
<p>of foods to get all your nutrients</p>
<p>but of course you got the sun so but</p>
<p>what are you going to do in the winter</p>
<p>karen the sun still shines in the winter</p>
<p>so what what foods have the most</p>
<p>what animal foods have the most vitamin</p>
<p>d now i&rsquo;m just going to ask you</p>
<p>well i think we covered this fatty fish</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>karen college listening yes</p>
<p>this is probably one of the reasons why</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>higher latitude northern hemisphere</p>
<p>countries like the nordic countries that</p>
<p>consume a lot of fish</p>
<p>have a lower risk for the covid because</p>
<p>um they consume fish and cod liver oil</p>
<p>and i knew they they get a good amount</p>
<p>of sun as well they they sunbathe and</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>i think they have a um sun</p>
<p>sun tan now they actually have a the sun</p>
<p>well it depends</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also dark depending on how</p>
<p>north</p>
<p>you go it&rsquo;s dark for half the year well</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in love</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting so um but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing you know who</p>
<p>what countries have a very large</p>
<p>percentage of</p>
<p>vitamin d efficiency it&rsquo;s the middle</p>
<p>east</p>
<p>um probably because you&rsquo;re wearing a lot</p>
<p>of clothing maybe</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s other other issues too food</p>
<p>wise that could prevent that</p>
<p>interesting yes okay okay good</p>
<p>so now uh let&rsquo;s go to brian from orange</p>
<p>county california are you there brian</p>
<p>i am thank you dr berg for taking my</p>
<p>call sure</p>
<p>i have a question about hypoglycemia um</p>
<p>i found out that i had hypoglycemia</p>
<p>after suffering it for most of my life</p>
<p>about a year ago</p>
<p>i started the keto diet and i felt</p>
<p>immediately much better</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s starting to fade</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m starting to feel the effects of</p>
<p>hypoglycemia</p>
<p>more again and so i would like to know</p>
<p>if you have any tips for me</p>
<p>and then also i have not been able to</p>
<p>find any supplements for people that</p>
<p>have hypoglycemia there&rsquo;s plenty of</p>
<p>supplements for blood</p>
<p>you know sugar control of that are</p>
<p>trying to lower their blood sugar</p>
<p>but is there a supplement that will help</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>balance my blood sugar you know is there</p>
<p>a supplement</p>
<p>for hypoglycemia good question um</p>
<p>can you quickly briefly tell me</p>
<p>what generally type of what type of</p>
<p>foods do you eat</p>
<p>during the day</p>
<p>so in the morning it&rsquo;s typically uh eggs</p>
<p>and bacon something you know or</p>
<p>something similar to that</p>
<p>yeah um in</p>
<p>the afternoon and in the evening</p>
<p>generally some protein with</p>
<p>salad okay and how many meals do you</p>
<p>have some peanut butter</p>
<p>okay how many meals a day do you have</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>see even with the keto i&rsquo;m still having</p>
<p>to eat multiple times and if i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>then i wake up you know a few hours into</p>
<p>the night</p>
<p>starving okay um so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a nasty cycle and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so driven by food and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m tired of it you know when you</p>
<p>wake up in the morning are you hungry</p>
<p>yes okay so here&rsquo;s what you do brian</p>
<p>um first of all you gave me a good you</p>
<p>gave me a really good idea for</p>
<p>one of my next videos because the</p>
<p>supplements</p>
<p>for hypoglycemia definitely definitely</p>
<p>definitely vitamin d</p>
<p>and definitely potassium and magnesium</p>
<p>too</p>
<p>as an electrolyte powder</p>
<p>so the one i have has a thousand</p>
<p>milligrams so i would probably do</p>
<p>two of those the potassium is going to</p>
<p>really speed things up</p>
<p>all you really your goal should be to</p>
<p>address insulin resistance so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really what&rsquo;s happening because you have</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>your insulin goes higher and this has a</p>
<p>stronger push down</p>
<p>wave for your blood sugars you end up</p>
<p>with low blood sugar um</p>
<p>i think you really got to focus on large</p>
<p>salads</p>
<p>with that protein that you have but i</p>
<p>had hypoglycemia just like you</p>
<p>and it did take a bit of time to turn</p>
<p>things around</p>
<p>and i was i did what you did with the</p>
<p>protein things but if you have just the</p>
<p>protein and the several meals a day</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to correct hypoglycemia</p>
<p>you have to also</p>
<p>get your fat up a little bit to create</p>
<p>sustaining</p>
<p>effect and then you need to have a lot</p>
<p>of of the minerals</p>
<p>potassium and vitamin d and probably</p>
<p>even vitamin c from from the greens</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s going to help you right</p>
<p>there and the second thing is that</p>
<p>your goal should be to try to work on</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>fasting as much as possible and it might</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>done at a very gradual way because</p>
<p>you know your insulin resistance could</p>
<p>be very severe so</p>
<p>you would want to increase your fats</p>
<p>so you can now you&rsquo;re actually not</p>
<p>hungry you do not want to go low protein</p>
<p>lean protein you want to go fatty</p>
<p>protein and you want to reduce your</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>and lastly nutritional yeast</p>
<p>a lot of b vitamins are going to help</p>
<p>this tremendously</p>
<p>so do those things and then i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>allow you to fast longer and then the</p>
<p>more you fast less meals you have</p>
<p>the better it&rsquo;s going to be and then</p>
<p>make sure that you do not have any</p>
<p>hidden carbs because that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>screw everything up</p>
<p>thanks brian all right karen</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what kind of questions we have</p>
<p>do you have a couple</p>
<p>i have a couple so one gal</p>
<p>is allergic to fish and is wondering</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving all these great</p>
<p>recommendations</p>
<p>about fatty fish for vitamin d</p>
<p>yeah then if you allergic to fish just</p>
<p>do the um</p>
<p>eggs and meat like</p>
<p>lamb or beef or even some high quality</p>
<p>pork</p>
<p>okay that has the same amount of d um no</p>
<p>no it doesn&rsquo;t but would she need to</p>
<p>supplement i would</p>
<p>get a lot of sun and sun is actually</p>
<p>pretty cheap</p>
<p>source of vitamin d you can save a lot</p>
<p>in fact it&rsquo;s uh i think it&rsquo;s even free</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing when you go in the</p>
<p>sun and you only have exposure to your</p>
<p>face</p>
<p>and you think even 15 minutes you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting a lot of vitamin d you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting some</p>
<p>you need to kind of um expose more of</p>
<p>your arms or your legs go out with</p>
<p>shorts and get more</p>
<p>exposure but without burning yourself</p>
<p>okay if your skin&rsquo;s darker you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to absorb as much</p>
<p>so you may need to get more sun</p>
<p>or add more vitamin d in fact um</p>
<p>probably be best to just take some</p>
<p>vitamin e just to make sure um</p>
<p>yeah okay cool uh now what could someone</p>
<p>do they have</p>
<p>this person has very dry brutal hair</p>
<p>brittle yeah that has to do</p>
<p>with either an iron deficiency</p>
<p>it could be zinc but it&rsquo;s usually the</p>
<p>trace minerals</p>
<p>that actually allow you to make</p>
<p>wonderful hair because hair is a protein</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all these little enzymes</p>
<p>that make hair</p>
<p>and you need the trace minerals as these</p>
<p>called the cofactors to go in there to</p>
<p>do that</p>
<p>the other thing is that cofactors</p>
<p>minerals also work with</p>
<p>healthy essential fatty acids so again</p>
<p>we need the</p>
<p>um you can do like the fish oils omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids um</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t go low fat anything</p>
<p>okay good all right let&rsquo;s go to sunny</p>
<p>from india are you there</p>
<p>yeah hi doctor hi</p>
<p>good morning good morning</p>
<p>so uh i&rsquo;m a big fan i have been</p>
<p>following your videos since</p>
<p>a long time and i have got a huge help</p>
<p>in any of the matters</p>
<p>now my question today is that i have</p>
<p>been suffering from autoimmune since</p>
<p>childhood so</p>
<p>to list down i had alopecia for three to</p>
<p>four years</p>
<p>which went off then</p>
<p>i have eczema and psoriasis</p>
<p>mild i would say but since like six to</p>
<p>seven years</p>
<p>and now i&rsquo;m 30</p>
<p>and i have started suffering from</p>
<p>erectile dysfunction since last one and</p>
<p>a half year</p>
<p>okay so sorry i came across your video</p>
<p>on proto most person and i would like</p>
<p>some advice</p>
<p>okay i have a question for you um</p>
<p>do you have any problem with um</p>
<p>slouching or bad posture like your</p>
<p>your back is kind of hunched over easily</p>
<p>um yeah i i if i get a question yes i</p>
<p>have lower back problems and i had a</p>
<p>lower back</p>
<p>pain since many years but which has gone</p>
<p>off now</p>
<p>since the last two years and one more</p>
<p>one more thing i would like to bring to</p>
<p>notice</p>
<p>that my father is suffering from chronic</p>
<p>kidney failure</p>
<p>since last 18 years and he is also</p>
<p>having autoimmune</p>
<p>uh symptoms like psoriasis and he is</p>
<p>which is very uh severe i would say and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also suffering from arthritis and</p>
<p>mostly 60 70</p>
<p>disabled now so you know i am starting</p>
<p>to see all those symptoms in myself</p>
<p>got it one last question um</p>
<p>do you do you have a history of taking a</p>
<p>lot of antibiotics</p>
<p>or anything that could have destroyed</p>
<p>your good bacteria</p>
<p>i would say yes because you know i</p>
<p>whenever i used to do some exercise</p>
<p>in the last eight ten years uh if i go</p>
<p>to work out</p>
<p>for a gym for a couple of weeks and then</p>
<p>i fall in very</p>
<p>frequently which i understand from now</p>
<p>from your videos that you know</p>
<p>when it is autoimmune the body gets</p>
<p>inflamed very easily and then you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fever</p>
<p>and then like digestive infection and</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>obviously i have to go on antibiotics</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>okay let me let me just give you my two</p>
<p>cents</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a classic vitamin d deficiency as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>it sounds like because vitamin d is</p>
<p>wonderful for autoimmune and</p>
<p>inflammatory conditions</p>
<p>but also the erectile dysfunction is</p>
<p>more of a zinc deficiency now</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the link between vitamin d and</p>
<p>zinc</p>
<p>they both need to be absorbed in the</p>
<p>small intestine not the large but the</p>
<p>small intestine</p>
<p>and if you had a history of antibiotics</p>
<p>then what antibiotics do is they really</p>
<p>alter</p>
<p>not just the flora but they can they can</p>
<p>create a problem with</p>
<p>inflammation if you&rsquo;re deficient in that</p>
<p>and that can scar</p>
<p>the small intestine to the point where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not able to absorb vitamin d</p>
<p>that well or zinc for that matter so you</p>
<p>could be taking it but not really seeing</p>
<p>the benefit</p>
<p>so what do you do there is a type of</p>
<p>vitamin d that you can get</p>
<p>which is liquid and you can take lar</p>
<p>higher amounts of that okay maybe 40 000</p>
<p>iu&rsquo;s a day</p>
<p>so the liquid kind of is much better and</p>
<p>that can help you and then the zinc you</p>
<p>might have to take more zinc</p>
<p>as well um so those two together</p>
<p>with healthy keto and especially</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m also talking about your dad as</p>
<p>well your father put him on that as well</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re going to be in good good</p>
<p>shape</p>
<p>there is um one product that you can try</p>
<p>to locate as well and i think i may have</p>
<p>rec</p>
<p>i may have recommended that pmg but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically finding um</p>
<p>a glance not a glandular product but an</p>
<p>intestinal</p>
<p>extract and i think that you were the</p>
<p>one i talked to before</p>
<p>but it acts as a decoy if you have an</p>
<p>autoimmune to your gut</p>
<p>but i would do those things vitamin d</p>
<p>and zinc and i think that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>benefit you greatly because vitamin d is</p>
<p>majorly necessary for anyone with an</p>
<p>inflammatory condition especially if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s autoimmune</p>
<p>and autoimmune conditions tend to</p>
<p>originate from the gut</p>
<p>all right thanks for your question all</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>i am ready for another question karen</p>
<p>you are yep</p>
<p>okay so what what could someone do if</p>
<p>they needed to regrow their hair what</p>
<p>vitamins are supplements</p>
<p>well trace minerals are one the b</p>
<p>vitamins are second</p>
<p>um biotin is one of them but your biotin</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>actually made by your gut from in the</p>
<p>gut so</p>
<p>usually you need more probiotics to make</p>
<p>that vitamin so</p>
<p>you know people will take biotin oh my</p>
<p>gosh my hair is growing back but then</p>
<p>they stop taking the hair goes away</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because you need to take</p>
<p>probiotics</p>
<p>but the hair is like a really good</p>
<p>reflection of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>all over and it&rsquo;s not just about taking</p>
<p>vitamins it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>getting the foundation your diet</p>
<p>corrected</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re going through a lot of</p>
<p>stress and you&rsquo;re taking vitamins</p>
<p>it might not might not work so you have</p>
<p>to get rid of the stress</p>
<p>keep a low um you know i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>release</p>
<p>karen i&rsquo;m going to do i&rsquo;m releasing a</p>
<p>video on</p>
<p>being too serious and that</p>
<p>i think will help people recognize</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;re just way too serious</p>
<p>and they need to just chill out reduce</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be surprised how much your</p>
<p>hair comes back from that but</p>
<p>the other thing is like um making sure</p>
<p>you have keto as a foundation and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting i&rsquo;m not looking at</p>
<p>you karen i&rsquo;m looking over there</p>
<p>at steve well karen&rsquo;s got this big</p>
<p>lion&rsquo;s mane of hair so she&rsquo;s the poster</p>
<p>child for</p>
<p>doing keto right apparently people with</p>
<p>hair problems she&rsquo;s certainly not among</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>oh thank you steve you see you know if</p>
<p>you said that</p>
<p>every day i would be less stressed</p>
<p>thanks steve i appreciate that let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to brooke</p>
<p>from phoenix arizona got a question you</p>
<p>were</p>
<p>310 pounds hi dr berg good morning</p>
<p>and good morning your beautiful wife</p>
<p>karen hi</p>
<p>uh yes dr berg i&rsquo;ve lost 310 pounds with</p>
<p>your program thank you so much for your</p>
<p>content sir</p>
<p>wow thank you</p>
<p>thank you um i have put on 27 pounds of</p>
<p>muscle</p>
<p>in the last year and a half but since</p>
<p>the corona has hit the gym has been</p>
<p>closed</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been working out at home and still</p>
<p>doing a good job staying healthy and fit</p>
<p>sticking with the program healthy keto</p>
<p>if omad</p>
<p>but i just don&rsquo;t have access to those</p>
<p>heavier weights that are at the gym</p>
<p>and my body feels healthy and strong but</p>
<p>my mind is</p>
<p>feels like i&rsquo;m withering away so my</p>
<p>question is</p>
<p>how well is my body maintaining all that</p>
<p>muscle</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;ve worked so hard yeah i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be okay though in</p>
<p>general but i think that</p>
<p>um in addition to the the weight</p>
<p>training if you could do more</p>
<p>body weight type things because you can</p>
<p>position your body and it really</p>
<p>makes them serious that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like push-ups on the angle and</p>
<p>all these things you can actually create</p>
<p>some</p>
<p>good amount of resistance but the long</p>
<p>walks</p>
<p>will help reduce cortisol the long walks</p>
<p>produce or reduce</p>
<p>reduced cortisol and adrenaline</p>
<p>more oxygen less stress which will</p>
<p>automatically counter</p>
<p>the um the stress and also it&rsquo;ll if your</p>
<p>cortisol goes down</p>
<p>the hormone that is really important in</p>
<p>muscle growth and protection of muscle</p>
<p>loss is growth hormone</p>
<p>that will go up if cortisol goes down so</p>
<p>i would focus on keeping the stress down</p>
<p>with long walks</p>
<p>i mean we walk probably an hour a day</p>
<p>and then also</p>
<p>make sure your sleep is really really</p>
<p>good and also</p>
<p>make sure your protein is moderate and</p>
<p>then the exercise is intense intensity</p>
<p>is a good factor to stimulate growth</p>
<p>more than just</p>
<p>heavier weights so if you were to do go</p>
<p>outside and do sprinting</p>
<p>that is the ultimate but some people</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that because the knees</p>
<p>so anything high pulse rate high</p>
<p>intensity interval training is going to</p>
<p>be awesome so</p>
<p>but well done on the amount of weight</p>
<p>loss that&rsquo;s amazing and also</p>
<p>so well done and the amount of muscle</p>
<p>gain um</p>
<p>keep checking in with us there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other things you can do but um for right</p>
<p>now focus on that yeah google</p>
<p>as many bodyweight exercises as you can</p>
<p>yes those cans of tomatoes</p>
<p>right congratulations from the control</p>
<p>room that&rsquo;s unbelievable</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing all right do we have a</p>
<p>another question</p>
<p>oh i was so busy listening to that one i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>all right you look for someone i&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to look for another one i&rsquo;m going to go</p>
<p>to joann</p>
<p>uh from pennsylvania are you there</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;m here hi hi dania yay</p>
<p>the poconos right pocono summit yes sir</p>
<p>karen knows about the poconos i do it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great where are you from</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m originally from brooklyn but i&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>pokemon summit right now oh you are in</p>
<p>25 years</p>
<p>oh wow yeah</p>
<p>cool what&rsquo;s your question</p>
<p>how do i know if i&rsquo;m eating enough on</p>
<p>omad or who must yeah</p>
<p>good question started last week okay</p>
<p>well this is always a question that</p>
<p>comes up because people are so used to</p>
<p>counting those calories measuring the</p>
<p>calories</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s a much better way to do</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>i would not recommend counting your</p>
<p>calories and even worrying about</p>
<p>calories i want you to go by your</p>
<p>ability to perceive that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>full or not so you eat the meal</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re eating the right things and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a point where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>i am really full but then stop don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep going to your stuffed</p>
<p>yet because here&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re if</p>
<p>we go by calories it&rsquo;s going to be so</p>
<p>difficult to figure that out because</p>
<p>some people like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t consume that amount of food and</p>
<p>then other other group is like i&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>hungry</p>
<p>so i would go by what your body is</p>
<p>satisfied with</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say for example you sit down</p>
<p>on your first meal and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>you have these greens and meat right so</p>
<p>start with the vegetables</p>
<p>your salad first because if you start</p>
<p>with the protein especially if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>chicken wings</p>
<p>you may find that you&rsquo;re not hungry for</p>
<p>that salad after you ate like</p>
<p>like about 20 of them so and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>making any names</p>
<p>steve so what you want to do is start</p>
<p>with the salad first large salad and</p>
<p>then have your protein</p>
<p>second and it seems to work out good and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>very satisfied and then see how that</p>
<p>works out</p>
<p>and if you can go for a period of time</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say i don&rsquo;t know five hours later</p>
<p>or four hours later</p>
<p>have the second meal and then you just</p>
<p>have two meals and then you do the same</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re gonna find that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna be too stuffed</p>
<p>yet you&rsquo;ll have enough so that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>would do</p>
<p>and i have done some videos on that for</p>
<p>more details on that</p>
<p>but because we have 30 seconds you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>leave it at that okay in the last 30</p>
<p>seconds we&rsquo;re going to mention two</p>
<p>things one we mentioned early on which</p>
<p>is our new</p>
<p>keto recipe channel yes go to go to our</p>
<p>the youtube channel under channels</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see it right there</p>
<p>been asking for recipes so here we go</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m really excited to also karen</p>
<p>makes the world&rsquo;s best lasagna</p>
<p>now i love lasagna i know you do but i</p>
<p>like it keto</p>
<p>but this lasagna that you can make karen</p>
<p>is like literally over the top</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s identical to commercial lasagna but</p>
<p>so much healthier and i&rsquo;m very looking</p>
<p>forward to that and i know you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>very excited about getting that recipe</p>
<p>but go ahead yes</p>
<p>and uh i was going to ask a survey</p>
<p>question myself but</p>
<p>uh what what i&rsquo;ll do is i&rsquo;ll mention the</p>
<p>keto summit when you go to the youtube</p>
<p>channel or you go to drburg.com the keto</p>
<p>summit is completely digital so whether</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in france or</p>

<p>u.s you can join it it&rsquo;s a virtual this</p>
<p>year</p>

<p>question with regard to recipes</p>
<p>are and you can enter this even after we</p>
<p>hang up are you guys</p>
<p>interested in things that are really</p>
<p>simple and fast or are you ready for</p>
<p>something a little uh more complex not</p>
<p>complicated but something that takes a</p>
<p>little bit more</p>
<p>time and create so let me know fast and</p>
<p>quick</p>
<p>or you know a good sound recipe because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s a good recipe it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good question</p>
<p>yeah because we want to know what you</p>
<p>want okay great</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s it then well i will say</p>
<p>that um some of these recipes might be</p>
<p>complex but we have to</p>
<p>teach how to do them and i think that we</p>
<p>have to we have to teach you how to do</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>yeah because they&rsquo;re so they&rsquo;re so good</p>
