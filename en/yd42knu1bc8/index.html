<p>and i&rsquo;ve lost about 20 pounds which is</p>
<p>great um but i still have a big uh</p>
<p>nascar tire around my waist that i need</p>
<p>to get rid of</p>
<p>um i know that i&rsquo;m looking at your</p>
<p>videos and stuff insulin resistance and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>i want to go into keto diet i have no</p>
<p>idea where to even start the internet is</p>
<p>just so full of so much information i</p>
<p>just need someone to hold my hand that</p>
<p>says right eat this eat this do this eat</p>
<p>this eat this</p>
<p>hey i got i have some suggestions for</p>
<p>you and the good news is i do have uh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re we completely reham revamped our</p>
<p>uh membership site to do exactly that um</p>
<p>very soon we&rsquo;ll be able to kind of walk</p>
<p>people by the hand and</p>
<p>get them to</p>
<p>make the changes</p>
<p>uh long enough for them to really start</p>
<p>to have it become a habit and a routine</p>
<p>and so we are we&rsquo;re almost there</p>
<p>but in the meantime</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>this i&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re doing fasting</p>
<p>um now it&rsquo;s time to add the uh the keto</p>
<p>and i did create a video on my site if</p>
<p>you just go to uh blog and then keto it</p>
<p>says start here watch the first video</p>
<p>to keep it really really really really</p>
<p>simple</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t actually even worry at first</p>
<p>about the quality of your foods i would</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>focus on eating foods that are low carb</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even worry about fats proteins</p>
<p>low carb will start to produce the</p>
<p>biggest change especially with chronic</p>
<p>fatigue syndrome um</p>
<p>do you have um</p>
<p>have you ever had mono by the way or uh</p>
<p>epstein-barr virus that you know of</p>
<p>uh no</p>
<p>i i don&rsquo;t know where they are</p>
<p>okay have you ever had really bad tonsil</p>
<p>tonsil problems in high school or</p>
<p>college do you mean because of the</p>
<p>chronic fatigue syndrome yeah</p>
<p>so probably literally about 15-20 years</p>
<p>ago i had something called</p>
<p>guillain-barry syndrome</p>
<p>which attacked my nervous system and i</p>
<p>think they think that that&rsquo;s what um a</p>
<p>lot of people have glandular fever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the trigger but i think that one</p>
<p>was the trigger for me i&rsquo;ve had my</p>
<p>tonsils removed is the answer to your</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and you had them removed because of a</p>
<p>certain reason</p>
<p>because they kept on getting infected</p>
<p>when i was really young</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>well okay so you&rsquo;ll have to find um</p>
<p>my video on sore throats not that you</p>
<p>have a sore throat but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>technique in there that</p>
<p>i want you to apply and rate your energy</p>
<p>before and after you do it because i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>create a really cool change for you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a technique that i stumbled on but</p>
<p>that being said um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sound like</p>
<p>gilliam beret that&rsquo;s an autoimmune</p>
<p>disease</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>
<p>yeah so you</p>
<p>attack your nervous system and you have</p>
<p>paralysis and some people you know need</p>
<p>to learn how to eat and speak again i</p>
<p>was quite lucky in that i just had a</p>
<p>half paralysis</p>
<p>yes so what you can do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things you do need to start</p>
<p>taking higher quantities that number one</p>
<p>is the b i&rsquo;m sorry vitamin d</p>
<p>i get a lot of sun but you want to take</p>
<p>at least 40 000</p>
<p>iu vitamin d on a regular basis right</p>
<p>now because if there&rsquo;s inflammation</p>
<p>going on from this autoimmune that will</p>
<p>kind of put it into a remission state</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll start feeling better the</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>key nutrient for gilliam beret is a is a</p>
<p>lot of vitamin b1</p>
<p>even</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re initially taking it synthetic</p>
<p>just to kind of beef up</p>
<p>your levels that&rsquo;ll be another thing</p>
<p>that i think you&rsquo;ll notice a lot of</p>
<p>change if you start doing research on</p>
<p>gilliam beret and also vitamin b1 or</p>
<p>thymine deficiency you&rsquo;ll see some</p>
<p>fascinating research on that topic so</p>
<p>those are the two things i would</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>but the fasting is also going to help</p>
<p>you but i think what&rsquo;s holding you back</p>
<p>right now is um</p>
<p>is the keto the lower carb so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to just get the</p>
<p>list of foods to avoid right now and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about anything else just to</p>
<p>keep it simple and then um</p>
<p>follow my um</p>
<p>my protocol on um</p>
<p>improving that over time till you get</p>
<p>the full knowledge of exactly how to do</p>
<p>it but i think out of all the things</p>
<p>that you can do right now lowering the</p>
<p>carbs combined with intermittent fasting</p>
<p>will start to not just handle the belly</p>
<p>fat but your energy will increase</p>
<p>unless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hidden virus</p>
<p>in which case</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of remedies for</p>
<p>that too i&rsquo;ve done a video on that</p>
<p>recently you can take that remedy but i</p>
<p>i would start with your fuel right now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll work on your fuel source which is</p>
<p>going to be the ketones</p>
<p>um you can even buy those little ketone</p>
<p>strips and just check your urine it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you if it&rsquo;s working um it&rsquo;ll turn</p>
<p>like dark purple and you&rsquo;re like okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working if it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>then you have some hidden carbs that you</p>
<p>need to</p>
<p>handle</p>
<p>okay perfect</p>
<p>brilliant all right awesome there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot to talk about but i think that&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>a good start and then stay tuned for</p>
<p>this membership program i think</p>
<p>um a lot of people need that um support</p>
<p>at least initially to get you on the</p>
<p>right track</p>
<p>exactly that&rsquo;s exactly right thank you</p>
<p>thank you you&rsquo;re welcome thanks so much</p>

<p>turkey malaysia bulgaria syria guatemala</p>
<p>wales dubai cashmere denmark</p>
<p>and all across these united states you</p>
<p>know dr burr we&rsquo;re going to have to have</p>
<p>a separate show just to read all the</p>
<p>people that are interested in getting</p>
<p>healthy because they are coming to us</p>
<p>all around the world so thank you all so</p>
<p>much for joining</p>
<p>us in that way and to prove that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>listening to you we&rsquo;re going to go to</p>
<p>social media and kick it off with tonya</p>
<p>from facebook i am suffering from</p>
<p>chronic fatigue and have a terrible</p>
<p>addiction to caffeine join uh welcome to</p>
<p>the club i love any tips to assist</p>
<p>improving my energy as i begin cutting</p>
<p>back on caffeine</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re probably in the caffeine to</p>
<p>stay awake right so um chronic fatigue</p>
<p>syndrome i just did a video on that we</p>
<p>just talked about that i think the um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>i i had chronic fatigue syndrome and i</p>
<p>just searched out for</p>
<p>literally years to take the right</p>
<p>vitamin to get my energy back i would</p>
<p>my wife and i would be driving in the</p>
<p>street and say oh yeah let&rsquo;s try it</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to this health food store and</p>
<p>take more vitamins and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to this place and try that and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you it never ever ever</p>
<p>worked because the foundation was</p>
<p>missing the</p>
<p>actual fuel that i was running on was</p>
<p>run up just glucose so once you convert</p>
<p>your body over ketones by cutting the</p>
<p>carbs out</p>
<p>uh and reducing insulin the magic</p>
<p>happens it&rsquo;s like someone will take</p>
<p>this fatigue helmet off of your head</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll feel um</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>awake more aware</p>
<p>so um that&rsquo;s what i would recommend</p>
<p>starting with and then</p>
<p>if by chance you still have a problem</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably a virus that&rsquo;s could be</p>
<p>activated reactivated from</p>
<p>the epstein bar virus not a reason virus</p>
<p>but an old virus that gets reactivated</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>reactivated through this thing called</p>
<p>stress so unless you</p>
<p>really handle that stress um</p>
<p>you know which usually relates to people</p>
<p>people stress</p>
<p>personality and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be really hard to</p>
<p>get this virus back in remission where</p>
<p>it belongs</p>
<p>okay very interesting good luck with</p>
<p>that and let&rsquo;s go to our first quiz</p>
<p>question doc if you can see that let him</p>
<p>have it</p>
<p>all right so which deficiency is behind</p>
<p>dry skin</p>
<p>all right audience leap on it and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to social media</p>
<p>when most of our listeners come from</p>
<p>uh buddhism from facebook what are your</p>
<p>thoughts on the carnivore diet</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s great i think it&rsquo;s great i</p>
<p>think a lot of people are are getting</p>
<p>amazing results um i&rsquo;m not converting my</p>
<p>whole program over the carnivore</p>
<p>um because</p>
<p>what we have is working fine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working very well</p>
<p>carnivores are really restricted but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good for people that have</p>
<p>gut issues inflammation of the gut</p>
<p>anything related to</p>
<p>um like</p>
<p>ibs or advanced damage to your gut you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tolerate the fibers of</p>
<p>of any kind like especially vegetables</p>
<p>or definitely the grains of course you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do that but um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>with certain conditions i think people</p>
<p>need to to use that and try it but</p>
<p>um i have not gone carnivore because</p>
<p>what we have um</p>
<p>works really well and i i benefit from</p>
<p>vegetables personally i feel better and</p>
<p>if i don&rsquo;t consume</p>
<p>enough</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel quite right i don&rsquo;t feel i</p>
<p>feel like there&rsquo;s something missing i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s there are nutrients in uh</p>
<p>vegetables they&rsquo;re phytonutrients yes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s anti-nutrients</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also phytonutrients that are</p>
<p>beneficial</p>
<p>a wide scale and there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals especially</p>
<p>potassium and manganese i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>magnesium</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do well on vegetables some people</p>
<p>do so i think the majority do that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>opinion but i&rsquo;m sticking to it steve</p>
<p>well you should because wide awake as he</p>
<p>calls himself from youtube says 12 days</p>
<p>of keto now and i haven&rsquo;t felt this</p>
<p>great since my early 20s thank you dr</p>
<p>berg so there&rsquo;s evidence of success out</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>all right awesome that&rsquo;s great let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>oh here&rsquo;s one eric from youtube</p>
<p>uh my 15 year old daughter has been</p>
<p>diagnosed with seizures and apparently</p>
<p>the keto diet can help how does keto</p>
<p>impact that condition</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s essential i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really essential um</p>
<p>i just was doing some a deep dive on</p>
<p>epilepsy and i found there was a really</p>
<p>interesting link</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>infant formulas with the soy and</p>
<p>increasing your</p>
<p>your risk of getting um</p>
<p>epilepsy which is fascinating um good</p>
<p>thing a lot of</p>
<p>small children never started out on soy</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>but um epilepsy if you have that</p>
<p>condition</p>
<p>you need to do the ketogenic diet but</p>
<p>not just any old ketogenic diet you need</p>
<p>because the one that they recommend is</p>
<p>like a traditional ketogenic diet they</p>
<p>do not look at the quality of</p>
<p>ingredients there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>low</p>
<p>nutrient dense foods and you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of fat with low carb</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine but if you can actually</p>
<p>combine that with healthy ingredients i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the optimum</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>i think a lot of</p>
<p>families give up on the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>because of the side effects from the</p>
<p>the unhealthy ingredients like the</p>
<p>diarrhea and the bloating and the lack</p>
<p>of choices so um</p>
<p>there is a way to do it correctly</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the healthy way because um</p>
<p>what they provide now like you you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give you depend a child you know give</p>
<p>your child these like an mct oil drink</p>
<p>with whipping cream</p>
<p>and broccoli and uh maybe some</p>
<p>some shake it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to do it for a</p>
<p>period of time</p>
<p>but i will say i want to say one thing</p>
<p>about kids i think kids</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think they i think they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like vegetables because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re like the best</p>
<p>group of</p>
<p>people that can judge if uh</p>
<p>if something is um nutrient dense or not</p>
<p>like if you give these typical</p>
<p>vegetables to kids they&rsquo;re like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna eat it because it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>bland like even a tomato if you give a</p>
<p>child a really good carrot that&rsquo;s grown</p>
<p>in healthy soils it&rsquo;s actually sweet</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s really really</p>
<p>healthy kids will eat it</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s nutrients dense and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a relationship between nutrient</p>
<p>dense</p>
<p>and sweet and vegetables i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about like tomatoes and carrots and</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>and or even flavor as well so i will be</p>
<p>doing more videos on that but um</p>
<p>if you start your kids out on these</p>
<p>nutrient-dense foods they&rsquo;ll stick with</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s fantastic well the audience</p>
<p>as usual is absolutely on it and</p>
<p>you had asked which deficiency is behind</p>
<p>dry skin</p>
<p>and 55 percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>vitamin e 20 insist its vitamin a 15 say</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>and 10 say b vitamins any winter well</p>
<p>you your all of the answers definitely</p>
<p>uh affect skin so that&rsquo;s they can all</p>
<p>cause dry skin there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>really more popular or more common that</p>
<p>would be an essential fatty acid</p>
<p>deficiency now what is an essential</p>
<p>fatty acid</p>
<p>those are the omegas</p>
<p>unsaturated omegas so now of course you</p>
<p>have omega-6 which</p>
<p>i do not think you have a deficiency of</p>
<p>that um but it&rsquo;s omega-3 is the one that</p>
<p>most people have a problem with now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to be releasing a video on</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>not necessarily a face mask but like a</p>
<p>moisturizer type</p>
<p>material you can put on your face</p>
<p>that can</p>
<p>infuse these</p>
<p>high levels of omega-3 fatty acids into</p>
<p>the skin</p>
<p>and get rid of dryness but ultimately</p>
<p>you need to consume more omega-3 fatty</p>
<p>acids</p>
<p>and yes fish oils sardines</p>
<p>salmon things like that</p>
<p>but also you can get the precursor ones</p>
<p>from walnuts chia seed things like that</p>
<p>and even algae okay blue-green algae has</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>has it as well so you can you can get</p>
<p>some of these precursors to the omega-3</p>
<p>active form so</p>
<p>stay tuned for that video</p>
<p>fantastic well dr berg i&rsquo;m going to brag</p>
<p>on some of your stuff so i discovered</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m jogging a couple times my</p>
<p>calves cramped up so bad in about the</p>
<p>first quarter mile i had to quit</p>
<p>and uh so the remedy is i thought was</p>
<p>you know being dehydrated and</p>
<p>electrolyte formula so from now on</p>
<p>i drink a big glass with electrolyte for</p>
<p>me about an hour before i uh jog and i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had the cramp since and i you</p>
<p>know i don&rsquo;t want to give it all the</p>
<p>credit to the electrolyte form and i</p>
<p>guess you got to stay hydrated but man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s curated and a good friend of the</p>
<p>show was mowing the grass and his calves</p>
<p>were all tight and we discussed that</p>
<p>this morning anyway that&rsquo;s a long way</p>
<p>around to get to judith from utah from</p>
<p>youtube and wants to ask when is the</p>
<p>best time to take your electrolyte</p>
<p>powder will it affect ketone production</p>
<p>you know some</p>
<p>i tell people to take it in the morning</p>
<p>but some people take right before bed</p>
<p>and they do fine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s going to push a lot of fluid</p>
<p>out of your body for most people but not</p>
<p>everyone so you might want to test it</p>
<p>out and see where you want to take it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>there is no best time to take it you can</p>
<p>take it with food without food but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just putting the electrolytes</p>
<p>back into your body and making your body</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>filled with things to help push things</p>
<p>through and make things work better</p>
<p>electrically both the muscle and the</p>
<p>nerve</p>
<p>and you have this little thing in your</p>
<p>all your cells called a sodium potassium</p>
<p>pump that generates</p>
<p>electro electrical activity</p>
<p>in your nerve nervous system and your</p>
<p>muscles that allow nerves to</p>
<p>transmit in muscles to contract and</p>
<p>relax so</p>
<p>without these electrolytes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel kind of</p>
<p>weaker you&rsquo;re going to feel tired</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t forget</p>
<p>salt is also an electrolyte so</p>
<p>you can</p>
<p>if you if you have a lot of these other</p>
<p>electrolytes but not enough salt that</p>
<p>can also create</p>
<p>a problem</p>
<p>steve i do want to mention um</p>
<p>we do have a new salt product coming out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very very different</p>
<p>most sea salt</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>is beneficial for people it has but the</p>
<p>problem is most sea salt is like 98</p>
<p>sodium chloride and then the rest the</p>
<p>trace minerals and other minerals so</p>
<p>this is a very unique type of salt</p>
<p>that is uh natural okay and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sun-dried from a certain part of</p>
<p>the world that has a very different</p>
<p>ratio of minerals that has</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 77 sodium chloride and then</p>
<p>you also have</p>
<p>all the other</p>
<p>minerals potassium calcium</p>
<p>in and also the trace minerals so when</p>
<p>you sprinkle this on your food what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to notice it&rsquo;s a completely</p>
<p>different flavor</p>
<p>i love it it actually enhances the</p>
<p>flavor</p>
<p>but also you get a lot of these other</p>
<p>minerals from your salt not just sodium</p>
<p>chloride which you do need but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a completely different thing</p>
<p>so i will be releasing that very soon</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a interesting interesting product</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s exciting so selfishly dr</p>
<p>berg if i&rsquo;m jogging is there any time</p>
<p>how long before</p>
<p>uh should i take electrolyte stuff</p>
<p>i think you did i think you get a good</p>
<p>job but</p>
<p>you know at least 10 to 15 minutes</p>
<p>before you work out um i think that</p>
<p>would be good but like i think you did</p>
<p>an hour before that&rsquo;s totally fine too</p>
<p>wonderful okay enough about me why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go to india and let&rsquo;s talk to gayatri</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>is like so many in india a uh vegetarian</p>
<p>and has some questions for you guys</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd</p>
<p>okay thank you hello dr berg</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m glad that i got a chance to</p>
<p>talk to you and i thank you for giving</p>
<p>me an opportunity to talk to you</p>
<p>absolutely</p>
<p>yeah so my question is uh what kind of</p>
<p>diet do you suggest for kids i have two</p>
<p>kids one is five years other one ten</p>
<p>years</p>
<p>so is it like keto diet even for the</p>
<p>kids or what type of diet</p>
<p>you know probably not as</p>
<p>hardcore as what i would recommend for</p>
<p>you but i would definitely go low carb</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>you know maybe that you they can get</p>
<p>away with more fruit maybe they can get</p>
<p>away with a occasional um</p>
<p>sweet potato something like that um but</p>
<p>but definitely don&rsquo;t do the sweets like</p>
<p>normal normal people give their kids</p>
<p>right um don&rsquo;t do the cereals don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>the grains with these kids and honestly</p>
<p>what i would do too is i would do three</p>
<p>solid meals but i wouldn&rsquo;t do a lot of</p>
<p>snacks either a lot of times</p>
<p>you know parents just want to keep</p>
<p>giving their kids all these snacks</p>
<p>between meals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the best thing because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like this constant spike of</p>
<p>insulin early on not good</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>kids have a very fast metabolism if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re active um they can</p>
<p>burn off some of the extra</p>
<p>uh carbs from the fruit and things like</p>
<p>that but</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>we have a granddaughter lucy and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s pretty keto but she does have</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>a little bit more fruit and things like</p>
<p>that but um</p>
<p>she does not do</p>
<p>candy and the cookies like that we do</p>
<p>the keto version of it</p>
<p>but definitely it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>and this kid is like super super</p>
<p>coordinated</p>
<p>uh super healthy</p>
<p>dental structure everything so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m convinced that&rsquo;s the way to go</p>
<p>yeah even for my kids i give a lot of</p>
<p>salads</p>
<p>actually you know influenced by your</p>
<p>videos i gave them salads and then</p>
<p>of course now i have reduced even the</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>all the so-called junk foods</p>
<p>so yes earlier i used to give but now</p>
<p>since a month i&rsquo;ve totally stopped and</p>
<p>they are quite cooperative and they</p>
<p>listen to me i mean they&rsquo;re okay with</p>
<p>that like they&rsquo;re okay with the salads</p>
<p>you know i would get them involved also</p>
<p>in nutrition like get them to make</p>
<p>cook different recipes with you get them</p>
<p>to grow certain</p>
<p>foods to get them educated</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just glad that they don&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>have a lot of sugar in india and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>glad that they don&rsquo;t have cultural</p>
<p>um activities and events with sugar in</p>
<p>your country that&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>thankful for that</p>
<p>that was my sarcasm</p>
<p>okay uh i actually had uh actually after</p>
<p>workouts i just wanted to ask like</p>
<p>afterwards workouts uh i do get body</p>
<p>pain like even after taking like</p>
<p>supplements you know vegetarian so i</p>
<p>take omega three fatty acid supplements</p>
<p>then i take</p>
<p>vitamin b12 supplement</p>
<p>and omega-3 fatty acid is</p>
<p>alaskan wild caught fish so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that so</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re getting sore when you exercise</p>
<p>sorry you said yeah i get sore</p>
<p>yes yes</p>
<p>not during the exercise sorry it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>during the exercise during the exercise</p>
<p>i am really energetic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s after that post</p>
<p>workout</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s a positive thing you you</p>
<p>do want to get sore after an exercise so</p>
<p>i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re making yourself sore</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the goal is to break down um your</p>
<p>muscle tissue so you get sore so then</p>
<p>you can recover um the only thing i</p>
<p>would say about that is that if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking you a long time to recover</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t push it don&rsquo;t exercise too</p>
<p>frequently you want to</p>
<p>exercise break down and stress your body</p>
<p>out and then recover i mean it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>kind of interesting um what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re exercising especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to build muscle</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re literally destroying your muscles</p>
<p>it sounds bizarre</p>
<p>destroying your muscles and</p>
<p>if you want to grow muscles faster you</p>
<p>destroy them more to the point where you</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re really sore i remember</p>
<p>in wrestling</p>
<p>there was there was days i couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>walk after a wrestling match i was</p>
<p>barely i could barely sit down but then</p>
<p>i recovered</p>
<p>and i became stronger so the point is</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>if you keep your diet really good with</p>
<p>like you said the omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>uh yes vitamin e</p>
<p>b1</p>
<p>for um then that will minimize the</p>
<p>soreness but</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s normal to have soreness</p>
<p>when you exercise</p>
<p>okay so i just had a doubt any</p>
<p>supplement</p>
<p>uh proteins or something yeah the</p>
<p>exercise omega-3 fatty acids are just</p>
<p>going to speed up but they can&rsquo;t speed</p>
<p>up</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the healing more than what your body is</p>
<p>designed to heal at the rate at which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re recovering out of hints you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go beyond your normal</p>
<p>recovery process so like just like with</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the recent video i did with your uh an</p>
<p>acute injury people use ice right</p>
<p>to try to reduce swelling to somehow</p>
<p>think that they&rsquo;re going to speed up the</p>
<p>recovery process when in fact you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to slow the recovery process</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting rid of</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>inflammation is there to heal you so</p>
<p>you have to just allow it to go through</p>
<p>its normal cycle so that way</p>
<p>and adding</p>
<p>ice slows the healing process</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>we have this certain rate that we heal</p>
<p>and recover</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>certain people heal faster than others</p>
<p>um and that&rsquo;s a whole different topic</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>uh so do you suggest like i should work</p>
<p>out alternate days or daily yes okay yes</p>
<p>i would give your chance your body a</p>
<p>chance to recover</p>
<p>and at least every other day and then</p>
<p>the walk on the days that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>some people need</p>
<p>especially as you get older you need two</p>
<p>or three days to recover in between the</p>
<p>workout</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>uh and regarding the salads now is it</p>
<p>like always raw or even if cooked like</p>
<p>since you suggest that seven to ten cups</p>
<p>so can it include a bit of boiled</p>
<p>vegetables also like</p>
<p>yeah you can you want you know some of</p>
<p>it raw but some of it can be steamed you</p>
<p>can boil it um</p>
<p>when i say seven to ten cups i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about um like salad leafy greens things</p>
<p>like that i&rsquo;m not talking about seven</p>
<p>cups of broccoli or brussels sprouts</p>
<p>that would be very very difficult so</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about these other</p>
<p>vegetables then you&rsquo;re looking at maybe</p>
<p>five cups</p>
<p>so i actually take uh</p>
<p>cilantro and this curry leaves</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i just make a paste out of that and then</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to consume curry</p>
<p>leaves in a large quantity</p>
<p>yes so i can make the paste out of that</p>
<p>and i mix it with other vegetables raw</p>
<p>vegetables like tomato or carrots like</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re making me hungry right now</p>
<p>and i think too that</p>
<p>having all those wonderful indian herbs</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>make it such a pleasure</p>
<p>to consume those those foods</p>
<p>the curries and the</p>
<p>cardamoms and all the different</p>
<p>wonderful herbs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well listen gayatri thank</p>
<p>you so much for representing uh india so</p>
<p>well uh we&rsquo;re gonna have to move along</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve run behind a little bit i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t gotten these quiz questions out</p>
<p>fast enough so saying that dr berg</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the next one</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>what is the primary cause of tmj</p>
<p>dysfunction like like a problem with</p>
<p>your jaw what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the primary cause</p>
<p>of that</p>
<p>okay folks climb onto that and let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to how about oscar</p>
<p>let me find his little clip there in uh</p>
<p>mexico city he&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>ready to go on with you oscar you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>with dr burton</p>
<p>hey eric here i am hey victor berg how</p>
<p>are you</p>
<p>great thanks</p>
<p>thank you well first of all thank you</p>
<p>for all the information that you share</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been dealing now with what i think</p>
<p>it is a restless leg syndrome for almost</p>
<p>three years i have taken all the tests</p>
<p>and analyses that doctors have asked me</p>
<p>to do and we haven&rsquo;t found like any</p>
<p>specific cost for these pains in my legs</p>
<p>actually i previously spoke with you</p>
<p>about two months ago</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>in this program</p>
<p>and i have been doing now health keto</p>
<p>for two months and i have been following</p>
<p>in this guide that i found in your</p>
<p>website</p>
<p>and uh actually this week i made a urine</p>
<p>test</p>
<p>and it appeared that i have 2.8 of</p>
<p>ketosis</p>
<p>and well also i&rsquo;ve been taking</p>
<p>the 4 700 milligrams of potassium a day</p>
<p>four teaspoons of magnesium</p>
<p>and about 15 milligrams of apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar a day and with my nutritional</p>
<p>yeast for the b vitamin right so uh</p>
<p>right now so far i haven&rsquo;t felt any</p>
<p>change in my in the syndrome and the</p>
<p>interesting thing is that even the pain</p>
<p>in my legs is also in my feet</p>
<p>and the pain in my feet feels similar to</p>
<p>the pain that i have in my legs but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now like even worse because it even</p>
<p>hurts when i&rsquo;m in movement which is not</p>
<p>like a restless leg symptom right</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s now even when it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>movement so it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a</p>
<p>muscular things but it feels similar to</p>
<p>the pain that i have in my legs with</p>
<p>restless leg syndrome it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>tingling burning inside the hot pain</p>
<p>that he</p>
<p>that i feel when i am when i am sitting</p>
<p>down or when i am walking or when i am</p>
<p>dancing i have it like all day in my</p>
<p>feet and it&rsquo;s the same is the same uh</p>
<p>pain in both of my feet and well i</p>
<p>wanted to know and my question is if i</p>
<p>am missing something in relation with</p>
<p>those of supplements that i&rsquo;m taking or</p>
<p>with the fasting and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very something that you recommend</p>
<p>and in a specific</p>
<p>doubt that i&rsquo;ve been having is that what</p>
<p>quantity of nutritional cheese or apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar do you recommend</p>
<p>every meal because i never know if i am</p>
<p>taking too much or not enough right okay</p>
<p>so i think um</p>
<p>i think i think we just have to look at</p>
<p>exactly what you have i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not convinced it&rsquo;s restless leg</p>
<p>syndrome i think it&rsquo;s more pain in your</p>
<p>legs or your feet it sounds to me</p>
<p>um because the restless leg syndrome</p>
<p>which by the way i had you know happens</p>
<p>like in the middle of the night where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so restless you have to like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much energy built up in your</p>
<p>legs you can&rsquo;t get it out</p>
<p>which should be handled with the b</p>
<p>b vitamin but if you have this pain in</p>
<p>your legs upon upon activation</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that come to</p>
<p>mind okay</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the first one</p>
<p>is a uh neuropathy of the of the feet or</p>
<p>the legs</p>
<p>which could cause those symptoms it</p>
<p>could be b12 but i think it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be um a deficiency but i think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to benefit by ben photomean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called ben photamine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fat soluble b vitamin that you</p>
<p>have to take</p>
<p>uh like four of those a day and like</p>
<p>higher amounts</p>
<p>that i think is going to help you with</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>your leg pain now let&rsquo;s say you do that</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it gets better but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a hundred percent</p>
<p>ben</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>yes yes and it&rsquo;s a fat soluble thymine</p>
<p>that penetrates</p>
<p>the the nervous system</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you do that though and you</p>
<p>still have problems then i would</p>
<p>recommend getting a vascular test</p>
<p>uh some type of uh</p>
<p>test from your doctor just to evaluate</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>the vascular system of your lower</p>
<p>extremities especially because there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>condition</p>
<p>called intermittent claudication which</p>
<p>can happen in your lower legs</p>
<p>which is more of a your arteries and</p>
<p>veins and things don&rsquo;t are not</p>
<p>delivering the oxygen</p>
<p>to your legs now i don&rsquo;t think you have</p>
<p>that because it doesn&rsquo;t sound like you</p>
<p>do but it&rsquo;s just one thing that</p>
<p>you know you always want to check and</p>
<p>look at all the possibilities that it</p>
<p>could be just in case this benfotamine</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fully 100 percent</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>perfect thank you thank you yes because</p>
<p>the interesting thing is that</p>
<p>i have also taken like vascular tests</p>
<p>and like all kinds of blood tests and</p>
<p>everything</p>
<p>and there is not like a specific like</p>
<p>cost that</p>
<p>we have found that that okay this is the</p>
<p>wrong thing so that&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s why in</p>
<p>the beginning and we were like okay it</p>
<p>is restless legs because sometimes it</p>
<p>gets better with movement</p>
<p>but now the thing is that now with the</p>
<p>feet it doesn&rsquo;t gets better with</p>
<p>movement and i think in my fear is every</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>so uh</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m gonna try the thing</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>i think i think they&rsquo;re in like 300</p>
<p>milligram tablets if i&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>
<p>in c and 300 milligrams</p>
<p>four doses a day you were saying yes</p>
<p>like around that okay perfect so uh</p>
<p>and in specific like any other like test</p>
<p>that you would like recommend me i mean</p>
<p>you probably already did the nerve</p>
<p>conduction velocity testing i&rsquo;m guessing</p>
<p>you had that done but that would be a</p>
<p>test that i would i would look at and</p>
<p>that would show up</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s actual nerve damage to a</p>
<p>major degree but if it doesn&rsquo;t show up</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>then it could be subclinical and and</p>
<p>then the ben photomean will help you</p>
<p>hey by the way you&rsquo;re breaking up a</p>
<p>little bit oscar i hope that helped you</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d love to have you back and let</p>
<p>us know of some of those things uh</p>
<p>provided some relief for you and thanks</p>
<p>again for coming to us from mexico yes</p>
<p>sir steve i think the uh i think you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s interesting a lot of</p>
<p>people have a lot of questions and i</p>
<p>think uh</p>
<p>every time we&rsquo;ll say just that one quick</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;ve ever had one person</p>
<p>ask one question steve</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that just have a lot of questions</p>
<p>well they do and you&rsquo;re gonna squeeze</p>
<p>them in there well listen if i if i came</p>
<p>on as a guest you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>shut me up because you know i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>blabbermouth so i feel for the condition</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just hard to</p>
<p>you know hard to keep on track so i have</p>
<p>uh complete empathy with all of them</p>
<p>and the audience though is very fast</p>
<p>in terms of their ability to answer</p>
<p>these questions and they know i&rsquo;m behind</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re helping me out with some</p>
<p>quick answers and it was what is the</p>
<p>primary cause of tmj dysfunction the jaw</p>
<p>thing you spoke of and sixty percent of</p>
<p>our respondents say magnesium deficiency</p>
<p>thirty percent say a calcium deficiency</p>
<p>and finally ten percent say a vitamin d</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s correct</p>
<p>well it sounds like no you guys actually</p>
<p>watched my recently released video on</p>
<p>tmj ouch because</p>
<p>the number one cause is recent</p>
<p>dental work that causes your teeth not</p>
<p>to fit correctly and that when you start</p>
<p>chewing and you start closing your mouth</p>
<p>oh my goodness does it throw off the</p>
<p>muscles</p>
<p>imbalances into your neck and then right</p>
<p>into your jaw and good luck trying to</p>
<p>fix that with a splint or surgery or</p>
<p>whatever or even a vitamin it won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>so you got to go back to the dentist</p>
<p>have them re-evaluate</p>
<p>make sure the teeth are fitting</p>
<p>perfectly</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s great now let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>this is uh something we hear somewhat</p>
<p>often alan from youtube i lost 27 pounds</p>
<p>quickly on omad but now i&rsquo;ve hit a</p>
<p>plateau what should i do next</p>
<p>the plateau i would check number one</p>
<p>re-evaluate your carbohydrates are they</p>
<p>are they low enough number two</p>
<p>fast longer</p>
<p>also make sure there&rsquo;s no hidden</p>
<p>carbohydrates in the things that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming i&rsquo;ll give you one example</p>
<p>there are a few copycats out there of</p>
<p>electrolyte electrolyte powder</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re cheaper than mine and now i</p>
<p>know why because they</p>
<p>they get their</p>
<p>their ingredients from china and the</p>
<p>problem is that</p>
<p>some of these chinese ingredients have</p>
<p>hidden maltodextrin in the flavoring</p>
<p>and the flavoring is really hard to find</p>
<p>it without maltodextrin which is a</p>
<p>sugar so it&rsquo;s loaded with sugar and here</p>
<p>you are trying to be keto friendly and</p>
<p>they have this hidden</p>
<p>maltodextrin which is terrible for um</p>
<p>so that so these there&rsquo;s hidden</p>
<p>ingredients you also have</p>
<p>like um</p>
<p>even some of the keto friendly foods</p>
<p>are not keto friendly</p>
<p>so you have</p>
<p>fast longer lower your carb more</p>
<p>sleeping get more sleep</p>
<p>is there a hidden stress that you need</p>
<p>to deal with</p>
<p>that could be a problem</p>
<p>and then the list goes even</p>
<p>deeper you can watch my videos i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>probably at least 20 videos on plateau</p>
<p>interesting well i&rsquo;m looking at the feed</p>
<p>going by and the folks on youtube at</p>
<p>least they&rsquo;re admonishing themselves</p>
<p>from missing the tmj question</p>
<p>uh but you guys are great uh and uh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna give you a mulligan on that</p>
<p>one so you just keep up the good work</p>
<p>speaking of which we&rsquo;re going to give</p>
<p>you a chance to redeem yourself let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>up with the next question dr berg here</p>
<p>it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>the most utilized ingredient in animal</p>
<p>feeds</p>
<p>worldwide</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>fill in the blank</p>
<p>all right climb honestly</p>
<p>the top ingredient</p>
<p>in most animal feats</p>
<p>on planet earth okay we&rsquo;re going to give</p>
<p>you a chance to shine once again</p>
<p>audience and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>some questions here</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh terry&rsquo;s giving me some sense of</p>
<p>guitarist yeah</p>
<p>um boy this terrible nothing worse than</p>
<p>dead air</p>
<p>oh here we go richard from facebook in</p>
<p>your opinion what are the five most</p>
<p>important supplements to take regularly</p>
<p>if there are five</p>
<p>well the first one is vitamin d that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the most important because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very difficult to get it from your diet</p>
<p>but unless you&rsquo;re on the sun you know</p>
<p>you can get it from the sun pretty</p>
<p>easily so so vitamin d is like number</p>
<p>one and number two</p>
<p>potassium simply because we need so much</p>
<p>of it and it&rsquo;s like most people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>consume enough salads so you want to get</p>
<p>it from other things like maybe a good</p>
<p>electrolyte powder the third thing is</p>
<p>zinc that&rsquo;s very very important it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trace mineral it really only lasts</p>
<p>roughly about four days in your body and</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a fat soluble mineral</p>
<p>or anything like that or nutrient so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not consuming it where is it</p>
<p>coming from so we have vitamin d</p>
<p>with potassium</p>
<p>zinc</p>
<p>and then the next one would be vitamin</p>
<p>b1 because b1 is intimately involved in</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what is that called</p>
<p>memory</p>
<p>uh without b1 you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>remember anything so and it creates</p>
<p>stress and all sorts of issues</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many negative things</p>
<p>that are like a cascade effect</p>
<p>from that and i think that if we talk</p>
<p>about um just nutrients in general i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to say omega-3 fatty acid</p>
<p>that is</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>related to so many um</p>
<p>problems with your heart and your brain</p>
<p>and inflammation</p>
<p>and a lot of people are just doing too</p>
<p>much of the omega-6 so then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to throw off the omega-3 so that</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>the five most important ones</p>
<p>wonderful okay well as promised the</p>
<p>audience is right on it with these</p>
<p>questions and the latest question number</p>
<p>three</p>
<p>asked the most utilized ingredient in</p>
<p>animal feeds worldwide is</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see 60 percent say soy and 40</p>
<p>say corn</p>
<p>i initially thought it was soy but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually corn</p>
<p>uh but soy is second on the list and uh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>um even</p>
<p>like corn on the cob that you would eat</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of a field corn that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that sweet it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very different and it&rsquo;s gmo</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the the primary ingredient so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re literally</p>
<p>you know feeding the animals this corn</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a fascinating study</p>
<p>that i don&rsquo;t even know if i want to make</p>
<p>a video on it because i think i might</p>
<p>get in trouble but i will tell you um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>study that uh is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time finding it</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>relating to</p>
<p>the feed</p>
<p>a combination of soy and corn</p>
<p>on pigs and and they actually dissected</p>
<p>their stomachs and looked at them and it</p>
<p>just filled with ulcers and inflammatory</p>
<p>issues and problems with the stomach so</p>
<p>i do have pigs and i don&rsquo;t feed them</p>
<p>uh gmo corn or soy</p>
<p>and so um</p>
<p>because of that study</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>a pig&rsquo;s stomach is actually kind of</p>
<p>close to</p>
<p>human stomach by the way</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s not identical</p>
<p>but think about how many people are</p>
<p>consuming</p>
<p>these grains definitely soy</p>
<p>and maybe maybe corn too</p>
<p>not that</p>
<p>people are eating corn chips or corn</p>
<p>tortillas but the corn these grains can</p>
<p>create a lot of inflammatory issues with</p>
<p>our guts</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s just my theory</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t proved it</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something to think about steve</p>
<p>very good well i don&rsquo;t know if my</p>
<p>stomach is reminiscent of a pig but my</p>
<p>appetite certainly is and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>constant battle for me</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m winning through with dr berg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great council</p>
<p>okay a genuine idea is the name of this</p>
<p>person claiming from youtube what are</p>
<p>the best food sources for omega-3s</p>
<p>uh salmon</p>
<p>krill</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>seafood</p>
<p>fatty fish sardines you can also use</p>
<p>algae</p>
<p>and seaweed</p>
<p>um but seaweed is high on the precursor</p>
<p>like ala that turns into</p>
<p>uh epa in</p>
<p>dha</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>walnuts have uh some dha i&rsquo;m sorry the</p>
<p>all the eight the precursor to dha so</p>
<p>walnuts and chia seed as well um but</p>
<p>those those would be the best foods the</p>
<p>fatty fish the salmon and especially</p>
<p>the cod liver oil</p>
<p>as well as cod liver</p>
<p>steve have you ever tried cod liver did</p>
<p>i ever give you some of that in a can</p>
<p>you know you did have me you had some in</p>
<p>the uh in the studio one time</p>
<p>and i think a little bit no i i like it</p>
<p>some people just hate it but i like cobb</p>
<p>liver itself and it can it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>pudding</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>man is that loaded with omega-3 fatty</p>
<p>acids</p>
<p>but um and it&rsquo;s actually bathed in cod</p>
<p>liver oil so</p>
<p>um you know</p>
<p>if if it&rsquo;s something that you like</p>
<p>um you should consume a little bit of</p>
<p>that each day uh to get your omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids i would not</p>
<p>consume the whole can because that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of fat</p>
<p>but maybe half of a can but don&rsquo;t let it</p>
<p>sit in the fridge for over a few days</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>it can go bad very fishy</p>
<p>i have personal experience with that</p>
<p>stuff oh gross that&rsquo;s horrible let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>so the audience has redeemed themselves</p>
<p>with the last question let&rsquo;s see if they</p>
<p>can keep up the trend so there&rsquo;s a next</p>
<p>question doc</p>
<p>okay so</p>
<p>the cracking on your heels on your back</p>
<p>of your feet</p>
<p>and your heel</p>
<p>you know like if it&rsquo;s very dry and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cracking</p>
<p>indicates the deficiency of something</p>
<p>of a nutrient what would that be</p>
<p>all right well why don&rsquo;t we go to uh my</p>
<p>friend alvin jackson who is from georgia</p>
<p>and we were talking about how everything</p>
<p>is related to peaches down there and of</p>
<p>course peaches are probably not good for</p>
<p>keto enough of that alvin can you hear</p>
<p>us you&rsquo;re on with dr bird</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re muted sir</p>
<p>yes i can</p>
<p>go ahead with your</p>
<p>question yes i guess first i want to say</p>
<p>that after listening to him there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of things he said that have</p>
<p>explained things that happened to me and</p>
<p>as you go short on one thing</p>
<p>my teeth are completely evil right when</p>
<p>i close them they fall on top of each</p>
<p>other so the dentist tried to do some</p>
<p>shaving give me a bit of an overbite</p>
<p>and i and and i had this tremendous pain</p>
<p>in my jaw and i thought it came from</p>
<p>flying in the airplane but now i know it</p>
<p>came from dental work</p>
<p>wow here&rsquo;s my question</p>
<p>uh i&rsquo;ve been on keto for about two</p>
<p>two years and it&rsquo;s been perfect for me</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>but this time around i have found that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m having trouble</p>
<p>driving my diabetes levels down my my ph</p>
<p>my countdown</p>
<p>when it first i had problems</p>
<p>with keeping it up and keeping it up for</p>
<p>me was good because i could easily get</p>
<p>it back up</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>uh trying to get it you know trying to</p>
<p>get my high my my high glucose reading</p>
<p>down while on keto is a problem that i</p>
<p>never had and keto&rsquo;s been so good for me</p>
<p>losing weight or energy uh i&rsquo;m a retired</p>
<p>veteran i suffer from uh chronic pain</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>just just a tremendous amount of</p>
<p>diseases i have a bowel</p>
<p>scientific stimulator in my back</p>
<p>uh i&rsquo;m patched up</p>
<p>uh from from uh</p>
<p>from the rogic cervical</p>
<p>uh lumbar all the way down to l5 s1</p>
<p>but once i got on keto i was able to</p>
<p>ride like 26 miles a day on my bicycle</p>
<p>every other week 100 mile bicycle ride</p>
<p>but my problem is my diabetes</p>
<p>so so i have a question i have a</p>
<p>question um</p>
<p>would you say that you&rsquo;re doing um keto</p>
<p>100 or maybe</p>
<p>close to that but you you&rsquo;re not perfect</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;m 100 when it comes to uh</p>
<p>carbohydrates or sugar alcohol</p>
<p>subtraction the fiber subtraction uh so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m 100</p>
<p>stand below my</p>
<p>carbohydrates</p>
<p>uh maybe my protein will go a little</p>
<p>high</p>
<p>uh maybe i&rsquo;m not so disciplined on the</p>
<p>calories</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>i eat at least one avocado per day and i</p>
<p>i definitely get all my fats in</p>
<p>and then how about your um your fasting</p>
<p>how many meals a day do you have</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>lately my fasting hasn&rsquo;t been as good as</p>
<p>it has been in the past</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right so here&rsquo;s so here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>suggestion um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a diabetic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>this is gonna have to be a way a</p>
<p>lifestyle like more of a</p>
<p>not something you go on and off you have</p>
<p>to do it consistently for a period of</p>
<p>time but the fact that you had all those</p>
<p>problems tells me that you have pretty</p>
<p>advanced insulin resistance which means</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your liver</p>
<p>is going to actually</p>
<p>make more sugar than it should it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis so um</p>
<p>this is what happens with even a</p>
<p>diabetic like they&rsquo;re not like if they</p>
<p>have high sugar but where did it come</p>
<p>from i didn&rsquo;t eat any sugar well because</p>
<p>your body is making it from other things</p>
<p>like protein and even fat and even</p>
<p>ketones so that could be</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on um i would first get</p>
<p>really strict with your intermittent</p>
<p>fasting i would do one meal a day i</p>
<p>would not do</p>
<p>any other meals in one meal a day and i</p>
<p>would make sure those carbs are really</p>
<p>low and i would i&rsquo;m talking like 20</p>
<p>grams of carbs do the greens and just</p>
<p>give it time but if your sugar goes high</p>
<p>then what you want to do is you want to</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>routinely to burn off that extra sugar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s made by your liver because the</p>
<p>liver is the weak link</p>
<p>of course</p>
<p>you know you can do the a1c test which</p>
<p>is like an average which</p>
<p>is actually even better than</p>
<p>checking a day-to-day but the point is</p>
<p>that i think those are the some really</p>
<p>important things that i would do and</p>
<p>then last thing</p>
<p>is i would do things to focus in and</p>
<p>help your liver like</p>
<p>um milk thistle that&rsquo;s a good one</p>
<p>like some of the cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>for the liver the liver likes the bitter</p>
<p>bitter food so in your salad you can do</p>
<p>a little bit of dandelion greens which</p>
<p>is way better than regular lettuce</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do for</p>
<p>the liver</p>
<p>broccoli things like that and then give</p>
<p>it some time um</p>
<p>and your sugar will come down now you</p>
<p>mentioned your sugar coming lower and</p>
<p>bringing it up when you&rsquo;re on keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting your sugars will</p>
<p>come</p>
<p>low they&rsquo;ll go down to 60</p>
<p>maybe even high 50s and you might think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem but it&rsquo;s not because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new normal because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating the sugar and so if you try to</p>
<p>raise it then you were countering this</p>
<p>effect so they kind of diagnose</p>
<p>hypoglycemia is anything below 70 but</p>
<p>honestly when you do keto and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating sugar it&rsquo;s gonna go below that</p>
<p>the key is how you feel if your blood</p>
<p>sugars are low and you feel okay then</p>
<p>guess what it&rsquo;s normal it&rsquo;s your normal</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great hey alvin listen we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of close to out of time but love to</p>
<p>hear back because you got an interesting</p>
<p>thing there it worked great your sugars</p>
<p>were great for a while then it changed</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d love to see if you can swap it back</p>
<p>to that great success you had before so</p>
<p>alvin thanks for joining us and</p>
<p>representing georgia so well and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh the audience is once again right</p>
<p>on it the the question number four was</p>
<p>the cracking on your heels could</p>
<p>indicate a deficiency of what</p>
<p>and our audience 65</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>uh a b vitamin deficiency 15 say a</p>
<p>magnesium or potassium deficiency 10</p>
<p>percent say a zinc deposit excuse me</p>
<p>deficiency and 10 say a vitamin e</p>
<p>deficiency are they on the right track</p>
<p>this time doc</p>
<p>they are on the right track but not</p>
<p>exactly on the right track</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a b</p>
<p>b3 and b2 deficiency</p>
<p>but it can also</p>
<p>be an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency</p>
<p>so again the skin the dryness the</p>
<p>flakiness the the cracking um you need</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>fish oil you need more uh collaboration</p>
<p>you need the omega-3 fatty acid but the</p>
<p>b vitamin deficiency</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t consume these grain products</p>
<p>in the sugar so if you&rsquo;re off the grains</p>
<p>like the bread pasta cereal crackers</p>
<p>biscuits waffles pancakes muffins</p>
<p>then you probably are not going to end</p>
<p>up with a b deficiency</p>
<p>unless you took</p>
<p>an antibiotic</p>
<p>which basically destroys the the gut</p>
<p>microbiome that makes your b vitamins a</p>
<p>lot of your b vitamins come from your</p>
<p>gut</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another little factor that</p>
<p>you might be dealing with like why why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t why do i show b vitamin</p>
<p>deficiencies i&rsquo;m taking b vitamins well</p>
<p>because your gut is is imbalanced so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>reason why you should consume sauerkraut</p>
<p>and fermented things fermented</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>kimchi that would be a good one and even</p>
<p>sometimes some good</p>
<p>kefir better than yogurt the reason i</p>
<p>like kefir is it has</p>
<p>a combination of uh friendly yeast and</p>
<p>friendly bacteria a lot more than the</p>
<p>yogurt</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>it um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s and there&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>like a lot of lactose in there because</p>
<p>the microbes are going to eat that</p>
<p>lactose so if you have a lactose</p>
<p>intolerance</p>
<p>uh you probably won&rsquo;t have that when you</p>
<p>take keeper because it also these</p>
<p>microbes make</p>
<p>the enzyme to break down lactose now i</p>
<p>do want to say one thing</p>
<p>right now the way i make my kefir is</p>
<p>from the raw milk not the pasteurized</p>
<p>milk and boy is that</p>
<p>way better uh experience and so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying well my state doesn&rsquo;t sell</p>
<p>raw milk if you look up real milk.com</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll like 43 states you can you can</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>get raw milk and um you can get the</p>
<p>cream you can get butter you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to get the milk</p>
<p>and um so these farms are now</p>
<p>you you have to do it like you might</p>
<p>have to do cow sharing and things like</p>
<p>that but there&rsquo;s a way to do it and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a little spoiled now with my</p>
<p>raw</p>
<p>cream in my coffee in the morning i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t go back to anything else because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>once you have that it&rsquo;s like wow it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like over the top wow sounds delicious</p>
<p>okay uh we are short on time but corey</p>
<p>is going to demonstrate how we can get a</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>in 30 seconds so corey unmute yourself</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd</p>
<p>sure i can do that hey zuckerberg um</p>
<p>great to be on you&rsquo;re so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>knowledgeable really appreciate it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so i had a hip pain for the last like</p>
<p>year and a half</p>
<p>and i watched some of your videos and</p>
<p>just kind of wanted to maybe get some</p>
<p>first hand you know advice from you</p>
<p>what to do like what the most important</p>
<p>things to do</p>
<p>and um how long it might take to fix it</p>
<p>is it is it the right hip or the left</p>
<p>hip</p>
<p>my left hip</p>
<p>okay um is it right in the socket or is</p>
<p>it uh</p>
<p>the front part or the back where the</p>
<p>sacroiliac joint is like where exactly</p>
<p>is it</p>
<p>you know it kind of travels so sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more in my groin</p>
<p>and then sometimes it&rsquo;s kind of like on</p>
<p>my thigh and then definitely kind of</p>
<p>towards the back right on that hip bone</p>
<p>uh the side back i guess i know the</p>
<p>definition</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>you know um when someone would come into</p>
<p>my office with that i would i would just</p>
<p>the first thing i would do is i would</p>
<p>check the range of motion just to see</p>
<p>um if there was a</p>
<p>a tightness like in your psoas and the</p>
<p>or your hamstring on that side or</p>
<p>to look at the imbalances</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>so so there is some loss of uh</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s some loss of or</p>
<p>asymmetrical type</p>
<p>motion in that hip with the other one</p>
<p>yeah and i know my body is very very</p>
<p>tight</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>you know honestly i i would um</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>the structure of your muscles um are</p>
<p>dependent on those muscles um</p>
<p>and so i would honestly start getting</p>
<p>involved either in um</p>
<p>some pilates stretches which i really</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re they really put the</p>
<p>symmetry back in there and the</p>
<p>flexibility</p>
<p>or the yoga stretches</p>
<p>you know you can do the acupressure</p>
<p>which is fine and do that on the</p>
<p>opposite hip but that has limited</p>
<p>uh relief because as soon as you start</p>
<p>walking again</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll give you an example if you do any</p>
<p>type of uh</p>
<p>sport or whether golfing or riding your</p>
<p>bike where you&rsquo;re doing um this</p>
<p>repetitive motion or asymmetrical</p>
<p>type activities or even just like</p>
<p>sitting</p>
<p>over time that can just you can lock up</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>that psoas on the right side so</p>
<p>you really need to um start doing</p>
<p>stretching type things and to keep</p>
<p>things symmetrical</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so i would i would</p>
<p>evaluate some of the pilate exercises</p>
<p>and start to put that back into your</p>
<p>lifestyle because that&rsquo;s probably what</p>
<p>you need and you might find that</p>
<p>like your right quadricep might be</p>
<p>extremely tight when you test it</p>
<p>and as soon as you loosen that thing up</p>
<p>all of a sudden the pain completely goes</p>
<p>away so</p>
<p>um i used to have a lot of stiffness and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um i i can relate to what you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through right now</p>
<p>but you got to isolate which one it is</p>
<p>first</p>
<p>go ahead</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>um i have started some of that and i had</p>
<p>i think i did notice that my right thigh</p>
<p>is very very tight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually the strength i do where</p>
<p>my left leg is</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s um you know some people find</p>
<p>that oh yeah you have a short leg and</p>
<p>wearing a heel lift and like no no no no</p>
<p>first check the um</p>
<p>the the thigh muscles because the thigh</p>
<p>muscles</p>
<p>one of them is going to be very very</p>
<p>very tight</p>
<p>the quadricep and then that</p>
<p>will throw off the whole dynamic</p>
<p>of your hip the sacroiliac joint on that</p>
<p>side</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>if you take your</p>
<p>foot</p>
<p>backward and you do that stretch on the</p>
<p>thigh muscle and you also hit these</p>
<p>psoas on that side</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s going to give your</p>
<p>your hip and back tremendous relief</p>
<p>that would be like a simple thing to do</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great corey thank you so</p>
<p>much for coming on love to hear if that</p>
<p>helps you and marianne has been so</p>
<p>patient with us poor thing has been</p>
<p>waiting we&rsquo;re going to stay over to make</p>
<p>sure we get to her marianne would you</p>
<p>tilt your camera down a little bit we</p>
<p>just see your chin right on the top</p>
<p>there there we go that looks lovely and</p>
<p>marianne you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd</p>
<p>i wanted to say hi dr burke and thank</p>
<p>you for your time and all that you try</p>
<p>to help everybody with my pleasure thank</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>welcome and my question is kind of like</p>
<p>a statement and then you can take it</p>
<p>from there i&rsquo;ve tried keto before i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t lose hardly anything</p>
<p>so my doctor had some concerns recently</p>
<p>about like blood sugars and high</p>
<p>cholesterol and i have a little bit of a</p>
<p>big tummy so</p>
<p>i just wondered what would be your</p>
<p>suggestions where do i start</p>
<p>yeah um the the stomach weight really is</p>
<p>related to um visceral fat which</p>
<p>actually is a kind of a spill off of</p>
<p>from liver liver being fatty and so um</p>
<p>and and that really just tells you tells</p>
<p>um tells you what&rsquo;s going on with your</p>
<p>insulin levels the insulin levels are</p>
<p>just too high and that that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>cause the cholesterol the metabolic</p>
<p>syndrome and a whole series of other</p>
<p>things so</p>
<p>the goal that i would recommend for you</p>
<p>would be to</p>
<p>do what you can to lower insulin and</p>
<p>that way</p>
<p>you cannot just fix the um this</p>
<p>belly fat but you can also</p>
<p>remove</p>
<p>fat from your liver like over 50 of it</p>
<p>within 14 days so you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>i think if you uh get on keto but even</p>
<p>more importantly</p>
<p>is that intermittent fasting the</p>
<p>combination of both of those are going</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>very powerful um</p>
<p>now intermittent fasting what do you</p>
<p>mean by that if you don&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t want to do snacks anymore</p>
<p>you want to do um like just two meals a</p>
<p>day and then even go to one meal a day</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t even worry about your calories</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>do the infrequent eating so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>having these small meals for the day</p>
<p>because when you fast you force your</p>
<p>body to convert</p>
<p>over to you burning your fat and so you</p>
<p>really drop insulin</p>
<p>which is the kind of like the</p>
<p>in the presence of insulin you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>lose weight it&rsquo;s impossible so we want</p>
<p>to actually keep the insulin low</p>
<p>by doing two things lowering the carb</p>
<p>and eating less frequently now when you</p>
<p>first do this you&rsquo;re going to find that</p>
<p>you might think wow i&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>hungry all the time but not when your</p>
<p>body after three days of doing it we</p>
<p>show you how to do it on the website</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll switch over</p>
<p>to your a different type of metabolism</p>
<p>where now you&rsquo;re burning your fat</p>
<p>between the meals and your hunger goes</p>
<p>away your cravings go away and now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot easier to stick with it</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t have any problems with hunger</p>
<p>or cravings i&rsquo;ve done fasting before so</p>
<p>maybe i just need to restart my sour</p>
<p>start up again</p>
<p>yes restart it and go one meal a day and</p>
<p>you should start seeing change</p>
<p>pretty quick</p>
<p>yeah because i don&rsquo;t have any health</p>
<p>issues per se they&rsquo;re just wanted to</p>
<p>prevent them so they don&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>i love it okay great plan</p>
<p>on that note i really appreciate all of</p>
<p>your wonderful questions and your</p>
<p>attentions and the comments on the</p>
<p>videos that i&rsquo;m released releasing</p>
<p>recently i&rsquo;m reading all your comments</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re amazing have a wonderful weekend</p>
<p>stay tuned for some fascinating</p>
<p>data this next week i&rsquo;m going to release</p>
<p>all right have a good one</p>

<p>you</p>
