    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re talking all about sleep</p>
<p>and how to optimize your sleep.</p>
<p>This is a topic we&rsquo;ve covered previously on this podcast</p>
<p>in the episode called Master Your Sleep.</p>
<p>However, since the airing of that episode,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been some terrific new science to come out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also received thousands,</p>
<p>yes, literally thousands of questions</p>
<p>related to the specific protocols covered in that episode,</p>
<p>as well as in the episode on jet lag and shift work.</p>
<p>And while today&rsquo;s episode is not specifically</p>
<p>about jet lag and shift work,</p>
<p>we are going to cover tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to shift your schedule</p>
<p>if you need to for work or travel.</p>
<p>And we will also cover tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to fall back asleep</p>
<p>if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>or if you get a poor night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>how to actually recover</p>
<p>from that poor night&rsquo;s sleep more quickly.</p>
<p>And yes, indeed, even replace sleep that you&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s episode is going to be filled</p>
<p>with practical tools.</p>
<p>We will touch on some of the underlying science,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really designed to be a practical toolkit</p>
<p>for optimizing your sleep</p>
<p>depending on your specific sleep needs.</p>
<p>Various times throughout today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I will refer to studies</p>
<p>that form the backbone of the tools that I&rsquo;ll be describing.</p>
<p>But whereas most of the podcast episodes here</p>
<p>tend to be deep scientific mechanism,</p>
<p>and then tools, scientific mechanism, then tools,</p>
<p>today, I&rsquo;m mainly going to focus on the practical tools</p>
<p>that anyone, indeed, all people, I believe,</p>
<p>should use in order to optimize their sleep.</p>
<p>Why should everybody want to optimize their sleep</p>
<p>and put considerable effort into optimizing their sleep?</p>
<p>Well, put simply,</p>
<p>sleep is the foundation of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance of all kinds,</p>
<p>cognitive performance, physical performance, et cetera.</p>
<p>It also controls things like our immune system,</p>
<p>wound healing, our skin health, and our appearance,</p>
<p>whether or not we can think clearly or not,</p>
<p>whether or not we will live as long as we possibly can</p>
<p>or not, whether or not we suffer</p>
<p>from dramatic age-related cognitive decline or not.</p>
<p>In other words, whether or not we keep our memory as we age.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about all the terrible things</p>
<p>that can happen to somebody if they don&rsquo;t sleep well.</p>
<p>Thanks to the great work of Professor Matt Walker</p>
<p>at University of California, Berkeley,</p>
<p>and the wonderful book that he wrote,</p>
<p>Why We Sleep, I think the world is largely on board now</p>
<p>that sleep is critical to our health,</p>
<p>our mental health, our physical health, and our performance.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s not often discussed is how great life is,</p>
<p>that is how much more focused and energetic</p>
<p>and how positive our mood gets when we are sleeping</p>
<p>for the appropriate amount of time at the appropriate depth</p>
<p>and when we were doing that regularly.</p>
<p>Basically everything in life gets better</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re sleeping well.</p>
<p>So today I&rsquo;m going to teach you the tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to optimize your sleep.</p>
<p>That is get to sleep and stay asleep,</p>
<p>fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and adjust your sleep given the various life demands</p>
<p>you may be experiencing.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training</p>
<p>to get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentous for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partnered with Momentous on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentous</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capabilities.</p>
<p>It turns out that your body temperature</p>
<p>and your ability to fall and stay asleep</p>
<p>are very closely related.</p>
<p>If your body does not drop by one to three degrees,</p>
<p>you are simply not going to get into deep sleep</p>
<p>or stay in deep sleep.</p>
<p>And waking up, it also turns out,</p>
<p>is related to body temperature.</p>
<p>Every time you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>your body is warming up in order to wake you up.</p>
<p>And this has an enormous number of hormonal and metabolic</p>
<p>and other cascades that are vitally important,</p>
<p>not just to what happens while you sleep,</p>
<p>but your health and your energy</p>
<p>and focus throughout the day.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep is an incredible device.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve been using for six months or so,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely transformed my sleep.</p>
<p>And I already thought I was sleeping pretty well.</p>
<p>The way it works is that you can cool or heat your mattress</p>
<p>according to different times throughout the night.</p>
<p>So for instance, you can cool your mattress</p>
<p>if you tend to run warm,</p>
<p>and that will help you fall and stay deeply asleep.</p>
<p>And then toward morning,</p>
<p>you can have the mattress programmed,</p>
<p>or I should say the mattress cover programmed,</p>
<p>so that you warm up your sleeping environment</p>
<p>and you wake up when you want to wake up.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been sleeping pretty well,</p>
<p>but waking up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>you might also find that by cooling your mattress</p>
<p>even further toward the middle of your sleep bout,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;ll stay in deep sleep much longer.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about sleep and tools to optimize your sleep.</p>
<p>I want you to conceptualize yourself</p>
<p>as contained within a room that has only very few windows</p>
<p>or very few entry points.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>Well, your brain and your nervous system</p>
<p>control whether or not you move or don&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>They control whether or not you&rsquo;re digesting food</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not digesting food.</p>
<p>They control whether or not you&rsquo;re stressed or not stressed,</p>
<p>happy or sad, et cetera.</p>
<p>All of that stuff that controls all that stuff</p>
<p>is housed inside your skin and skull, et cetera.</p>
<p>That might seem pretty obvious,</p>
<p>but what that means is that for your brain and body</p>
<p>to feel alert and focused, ready to move and exercise</p>
<p>or do some work, or if your brain and body</p>
<p>are going to lie down and go to sleep,</p>
<p>well, that brain and body needs cues.</p>
<p>It needs inputs to determine</p>
<p>when to do those different things.</p>
<p>And those cues and inputs arrive through a defined set</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;ll call stimuli,</p>
<p>but you can also think of these as levers or tools.</p>
<p>The main levers and tools that are going to allow you</p>
<p>to control when you are awake and when you are asleep</p>
<p>and to get better sleep every single night are light,</p>
<p>literally photons, light energy, could be from sunlight,</p>
<p>could be from artificial light.</p>
<p>We will discuss those particulars in a moment,</p>
<p>as well as darkness.</p>
<p>That is the absence of light.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got light and dark.</p>
<p>Those are two very powerful tools</p>
<p>to encourage your nervous system</p>
<p>to be in one state or another, meaning awake or asleep.</p>
<p>Temperature is another tool or lever.</p>
<p>It turns out that when your body is cooling down,</p>
<p>you have a greater tendency to fall and stay asleep.</p>
<p>In fact, every night when you actually sleep,</p>
<p>your body is dropping by one to three degrees</p>
<p>and that drop in temperature is required.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a gate that your body has to go through</p>
<p>in order for you to get into sleep.</p>
<p>And in fact, the converse is also true.</p>
<p>If your body heats up by one to three degrees or so,</p>
<p>you will wake up.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got light, dark, temperature, food.</p>
<p>And when we say food, we mean what we eat,</p>
<p>when we eat and the amount that we eat.</p>
<p>Okay, so light, dark, temperature, food, exercise.</p>
<p>And of course, exercise comes in different forms.</p>
<p>We can do cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>That can be low intensity, long distance exercise.</p>
<p>It can be high intensity,</p>
<p>so-called high intensity interval training.</p>
<p>It could be weight training, it could be yoga,</p>
<p>it could be swimming, any number of different activities.</p>
<p>But exercise in general causes an increase</p>
<p>in body temperature and tends to make us more alert,</p>
<p>not just during the exercise,</p>
<p>but in the immediate hours after that exercise.</p>
<p>Exercise does some other things</p>
<p>that relate to our sleep as well.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about those today</p>
<p>and how you can leverage them.</p>
<p>Another potent lever for adjusting your sleepiness</p>
<p>and wakefulness is caffeine.</p>
<p>This of course comes as no surprise to people,</p>
<p>but why and how caffeine works</p>
<p>might come as a surprise very briefly.</p>
<p>We have a molecule in our body called adenosine.</p>
<p>And the longer we have been awake,</p>
<p>the more adenosine builds up in our brain and body.</p>
<p>And adenosine is part of the reason why we get sleepy.</p>
<p>Caffeine effectively operates as a adenosine antagonist.</p>
<p>It works by basically occupying the receptor for adenosine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit of a convoluted mechanism,</p>
<p>but basically all you need to know</p>
<p>is that caffeine prevents the actions of adenosine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why caffeine makes us feel alert.</p>
<p>But how much caffeine we drink and when we drink caffeine</p>
<p>turns out to be vitally important</p>
<p>for adjusting our wakefulness and for optimizing our sleep.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about that as well.</p>
<p>The other category of lever tools,</p>
<p>which are immensely powerful for optimizing sleep</p>
<p>are supplements.</p>
<p>There now exist as many as eight different supplements</p>
<p>that can powerfully modulate sleep in healthy ways</p>
<p>and that have huge margins for safety.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about what those supplements are.</p>
<p>In previous episodes of this podcast</p>
<p>and as a guest on other podcasts,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about three particular supplements,</p>
<p>magnesium threonate, apigenin and theanine,</p>
<p>which together can really enhance the speed</p>
<p>at which one falls asleep</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s ability to stay asleep</p>
<p>and to really get into those deep stages of sleep.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re particularly restorative.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about each of those three</p>
<p>and how they can best be used in combination.</p>
<p>But we are also going to touch on some other supplements</p>
<p>that I have not talked about much before, if at all.</p>
<p>Things like glycine and GABA, as well as inositol.</p>
<p>Many people are going to find inositol interesting</p>
<p>and of particular use to them,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re following a low carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>or if they are fasting before sleep</p>
<p>or just trying to avoid eating too close to bedtime</p>
<p>and yet they&rsquo;re having a hard time falling asleep.</p>
<p>Inositol also turns out to be especially useful</p>
<p>for people who have a tendency to wake up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and have a hard time falling back asleep.</p>
<p>It also has some interesting and potent effects</p>
<p>on anxiety throughout the day.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about inositol as a tool as well.</p>
<p>And then last in our list of general categories</p>
<p>of levers and tools for optimizing sleep are digital tools.</p>
<p>When I say digital tools,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean devices.</p>
<p>What I mean are things like non-sleep deep rest scripts.</p>
<p>These are zero cost scripts that you listen to</p>
<p>that take your body through some deep relaxation</p>
<p>and that can help people both fall asleep, stay asleep,</p>
<p>fall back asleep, and get better at sleeping.</p>
<p>Also going to talk about digital tools</p>
<p>related to self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>This is distinctly different from stage hypnosis.</p>
<p>So I know some of you hear hypnosis and you think,</p>
<p>oh, you know, people, you know, clucking like chickens</p>
<p>and doing things that are outside their control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not at all what I&rsquo;m referring to here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about clinically and research supported tools</p>
<p>that have been shown to enhance people&rsquo;s ability to fall</p>
<p>and stay asleep and that can get you far better at sleeping.</p>
<p>So again, to recap the list of levers and tools,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got light and dark,</p>
<p>and that includes the intensity of light,</p>
<p>the timing of light, et cetera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got temperature, we have food,</p>
<p>we have exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital tools,</p>
<p>not just limited to devices,</p>
<p>but zero cost tools that you can access on YouTube</p>
<p>and elsewhere in various apps</p>
<p>that can really help you optimize your sleep.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to talk about all of these.</p>
<p>I really want to provide you as many tools as possible,</p>
<p>give you the logic behind each of those tools</p>
<p>and when and how best to apply them</p>
<p>so that you can develop the sleep toolkit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ideal for your sleep needs.</p>
<p>As we head into our description</p>
<p>of tools for optimizing sleep,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s consider what the perfect 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>would look like.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start this 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>with when you wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>So for some of you, that will be 5 a.m.,</p>
<p>for others of you, that will be 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Most people, I believe,</p>
<p>wake up sometime between 6.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m.</p>
<p>But regardless of when you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>one of the first things that happens</p>
<p>is that your body temperature is increasing,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just going to happen naturally.</p>
<p>Some of it is going to be the consequence</p>
<p>of your moving around a bit,</p>
<p>but really the increase in body temperature</p>
<p>is one of the main triggers</p>
<p>for why you woke up in the first place.</p>
<p>That increase in body temperature, in turn,</p>
<p>causes an increase in the release</p>
<p>of a hormone called cortisol.</p>
<p>Cortisol is often discussed as a stress hormone,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just associated with stress.</p>
<p>It also enhances your immune system,</p>
<p>provided cortisol is elevated at the right times,</p>
<p>and the right time for cortisol to be elevated</p>
<p>is when you first wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>That increase in cortisol</p>
<p>is also going to increase metabolism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also going to increase your ability to focus mentally</p>
<p>and for you to move your body.</p>
<p>So again, cortisol is often demonized</p>
<p>and considered this bad thing,</p>
<p>and indeed, you don&rsquo;t want cortisol to be chronically</p>
<p>or consistently elevated throughout the day or night,</p>
<p>but you do want cortisol to reach its peak early in the day,</p>
<p>right about the time you wake up.</p>
<p>One way that you can ensure</p>
<p>that that cortisol peak occurs early in the day,</p>
<p>right about the time that you wake up,</p>
<p>is to view bright light, ideally from sunlight,</p>
<p>within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>View bright sunlight</p>
<p>within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get into all the caveats</p>
<p>about what happens if you wake up before the sun is out.</p>
<p>What if you live in the UK where there is no sun</p>
<p>or people claim there is no sun?</p>
<p>Hate to tell you this folks, but there is sun in the UK.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about all that.</p>
<p>But everybody, whether or not you live in a cloudy place</p>
<p>or a sunny place, whether or not there&rsquo;s cloud cover</p>
<p>or not that day, should really strive</p>
<p>to get bright light in your eyes, ideally from sunlight,</p>
<p>within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>The reason for that is very simple.</p>
<p>You want to trigger that cortisol increase</p>
<p>to occur very early in your day.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want that cortisol peak to happen later,</p>
<p>which is what will happen</p>
<p>if you wait to get outside and see sunlight.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that you have a set of neurons,</p>
<p>nerve cells in your eye,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells,</p>
<p>but you do not need to know that name.</p>
<p>Those neurons respond best to bright light.</p>
<p>And especially right after waking early in the day,</p>
<p>they are best able to signal to a set of neurons</p>
<p>that reside over the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,</p>
<p>which is a cluster of neurons</p>
<p>that then sends a huge number of other signals,</p>
<p>electrical and chemical, out to your entire body</p>
<p>that triggers that cortisol increase,</p>
<p>provides a wake-up signal for your brain and body,</p>
<p>and sets in motion a timer</p>
<p>for you to fall asleep later that night.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re not trying to go into too much mechanism.</p>
<p>Today, we are trying to really hammer on tools,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll substantiate those tools</p>
<p>just a bit with some mechanism,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s what you do, or at least here&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>I wake up in the morning and I want to reach for my phone,</p>
<p>but I know that even if I were to crank up the brightness</p>
<p>on that phone screen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not bright enough to trigger that cortisol spike</p>
<p>and for me to be at my most alert and focused</p>
<p>throughout the day and to optimize my sleep at night.</p>
<p>So what I do is I get out of bed and I go outside,</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s a bright, clear day,</p>
<p>and the sun is low in the sky,</p>
<p>or the sun is starting to get overhead,</p>
<p>what we call low solar angle,</p>
<p>then I know I&rsquo;m getting outside at the right time.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s cloud cover and I can&rsquo;t see the sun,</p>
<p>I also know I&rsquo;m doing a good thing because it turns out,</p>
<p>especially on cloudy days,</p>
<p>you want to get outside and get as much light energy</p>
<p>or photons in your eyes.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a very clear day</p>
<p>and I can see where the sun is.</p>
<p>I do not need to stare directly into the sun.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s very low in the sky,</p>
<p>I might do that because it&rsquo;s not going to be very painful</p>
<p>to my eyes.</p>
<p>However, if the sun is a little bit brighter</p>
<p>and a little bit higher in the sky,</p>
<p>sometimes it can be painful to look at.</p>
<p>So the way to get this sunlight viewing early in the day</p>
<p>is to look toward the sun.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s too bright to look at directly,</p>
<p>well then don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You just look toward it, but not directly at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely fine to blink.</p>
<p>In fact, I encourage you to blink</p>
<p>whenever you feel the impulse to blink.</p>
<p>Never look at any light, sunlight or otherwise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so bright that it&rsquo;s painful to look at</p>
<p>because you can damage your eyes.</p>
<p>But for this morning sunlight viewing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s best to not wear sunglasses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, to not wear sunglasses,</p>
<p>at least for this morning sunlight viewing.</p>
<p>It is absolutely fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses,</p>
<p>so-called corrective lenses.</p>
<p>In fact, those will serve you well in this practice</p>
<p>or this tool because they will focus the light</p>
<p>onto your neural retina and onto those melanopsin</p>
<p>intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells.</p>
<p>If your eyeglasses or contact lenses have UV protection,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many different wavelengths of light</p>
<p>coming from the sun and they are bright enough</p>
<p>that they will trigger the mechanisms</p>
<p>that you want triggered at this early time of day.</p>
<p>So try and get outside,</p>
<p>ideally within the first five minutes of waking,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s 15 minutes,</p>
<p>but certainly within the first hour after waking.</p>
<p>I want to share with you three critical things</p>
<p>about this tool of morning sunlight viewing.</p>
<p>First of all, this is not some woo biology thing.</p>
<p>This is grounded in the core of our physiology.</p>
<p>There are literally hundreds,</p>
<p>if not thousands of quality peer reviewed papers</p>
<p>showing that light viewing early in the day</p>
<p>is the most powerful stimulus for wakefulness</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>And it has a powerful positive impact on your ability</p>
<p>to fall and stay asleep at night.</p>
<p>So this is really the foundational power tool</p>
<p>for ensuring a great night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>and for feeling more awake during the day.</p>
<p>Second of all, if you wake up before the sun is out,</p>
<p>you can, and probably should flip on artificial lights</p>
<p>in your internal home environment or apartment</p>
<p>or wherever you happen to live,</p>
<p>if your goal is to be awake, right?</p>
<p>If you wake up at four in the morning</p>
<p>and you need to be awake,</p>
<p>well then turn on artificial lights.</p>
<p>Once the sun is out, however, once the sun has risen,</p>
<p>then you still want to get outside and view sunlight.</p>
<p>Some of you will wake up before the sun comes out.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re asking whether or not turning on</p>
<p>artificial lights can replace sunlight at those hours,</p>
<p>unfortunately, the answer is no.</p>
<p>Unless you have a very special light.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about what kind of light.</p>
<p>The bright artificial lights in your home environment</p>
<p>are not, I repeat, are not going to be sufficiently bright</p>
<p>to turn on the cortisol mechanism</p>
<p>and the other wake-up mechanisms</p>
<p>that you need early in the day.</p>
<p>The diabolical twist, however,</p>
<p>is that those lights in your home or apartment</p>
<p>or even on your phone are bright enough</p>
<p>to disrupt your sleep if you look at them too late at night</p>
<p>or in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this asymmetry in our retinal, our eye biology,</p>
<p>and in our brain&rsquo;s biology,</p>
<p>whereby early in the day, right around waking,</p>
<p>you need a lot of light, a lot of photons,</p>
<p>a lot of light energy.</p>
<p>And artificial lights generally just won&rsquo;t accomplish</p>
<p>what you need them to accomplish.</p>
<p>But at night, even a little bit of artificial light</p>
<p>can really mess up your so-called circadian,</p>
<p>your 24-hour clocks and all these mechanisms</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So if you wake up before the sun is out and it&rsquo;s still dark,</p>
<p>please turn on as many bright artificial lights</p>
<p>as you possibly can or need,</p>
<p>but then get outside once the sun is out.</p>
<p>On cloudy days, you especially need to get outside.</p>
<p>I repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days,</p>
<p>you especially need to get outside and get sunlight.</p>
<p>You just need to get more of it.</p>
<p>Now, how much light and how much light viewing do you need?</p>
<p>This is going to vary depending on person and place,</p>
<p>literally where you live on earth,</p>
<p>whether or not there&rsquo;s a lot of tree cover,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re somebody who has sensitive eyes</p>
<p>or less sensitive eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really impossible for me</p>
<p>to give an absolute prescriptive,</p>
<p>but we can give some general guidelines.</p>
<p>In general, on a clear day,</p>
<p>meaning no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover,</p>
<p>you want to get this sunlight exposure to your eyes</p>
<p>for about five minutes or so.</p>
<p>Could be three minutes one day, could be seven minutes</p>
<p>the next day, about five minutes.</p>
<p>On a day where there&rsquo;s cloud cover,</p>
<p>so the sun is just peeking through the clouds</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s more dense cloud cover,</p>
<p>you want to get about 10 minutes of sunlight exposure</p>
<p>to your eyes early in the day.</p>
<p>And on days that are really densely overcast</p>
<p>or maybe even a rainy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to get as much as 20 or 30 minutes</p>
<p>of sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Another key thing is do not forget about,</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t try and get this sunlight exposure</p>
<p>through a windshield of a car or a window,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s tinted or otherwise.</p>
<p>It takes far too long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply not going to trigger the relevant mechanisms.</p>
<p>You would be standing there all day</p>
<p>trying to get enough light into your eyes</p>
<p>from the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>And by then the sun will have already moved</p>
<p>from low solar angle to overhead.</p>
<p>And it simply won&rsquo;t work for all sorts of mechanisms</p>
<p>related to your circadian rhythm functions.</p>
<p>So just don&rsquo;t try and do it through a windshield,</p>
<p>sunglasses, or a window.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not going to work.</p>
<p>Get outside.</p>
<p>If the weather is really bad or for whatever reason,</p>
<p>safety reasons, you cannot get outside,</p>
<p>well then I suppose try and get near a window.</p>
<p>That would be the last, last resort.</p>
<p>But you really want to get outside</p>
<p>to get the sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Now, if you live in a part of the world</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s extremely dark and overcast,</p>
<p>or the weather won&rsquo;t let you outside,</p>
<p>or you live in a cave or some other small box</p>
<p>that does not allow any natural light into it</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>well then you&rsquo;re going to need a replacement</p>
<p>for that sunlight.</p>
<p>And there are sunlight simulators or daylight simulators</p>
<p>that you can purchase.</p>
<p>Those are quite expensive in general.</p>
<p>And therefore I suggest cheaper options</p>
<p>that work just as well because they get just as bright.</p>
<p>Things like ring lights that are sold</p>
<p>in order for people to take selfies and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>A drawing LED tablet will work pretty well.</p>
<p>I actually have one of those</p>
<p>and I put it on my desk all morning,</p>
<p>even though I still get outside</p>
<p>and look at sunlight first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Again, also, especially I should say on cloudy days.</p>
<p>We do not have any affiliation to any ring lights</p>
<p>or LED lights or these panels.</p>
<p>So we will provide a link to a couple of different options.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the various options,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what people&rsquo;s different budgets are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where people live.</p>
<p>I just know that many of our listeners</p>
<p>live in locations throughout the world where for instance,</p>
<p>during the winter, it gets very, very dark.</p>
<p>So they can&rsquo;t get sufficient sunlight,</p>
<p>but get that morning light ideally from sunlight</p>
<p>and take into account all the specific points</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve given you here.</p>
<p>And I should say, enjoy this practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really nice to get outside first thing in the morning</p>
<p>and get the sunlight.</p>
<p>In fact, when you start doing this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that your body will start</p>
<p>to feel more energized</p>
<p>and it will feel more energized more quickly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll actually start to notice this mechanism</p>
<p>kicking in each day,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re paying attention to your physiology.</p>
<p>So enjoy this practice of getting outside.</p>
<p>Yes, you can take your morning beverage outside.</p>
<p>Yes, you can take your dog with you.</p>
<p>In fact, animals intuitively know</p>
<p>to get this morning sunlight.</p>
<p>They actually seek it out at the right times of days.</p>
<p>We human beings need to be told by podcasters</p>
<p>and other people about the science</p>
<p>that supports these kinds of practices.</p>
<p>Our pets apparently do not,</p>
<p>but get outside alone or with somebody,</p>
<p>with your kids, with your dog,</p>
<p>however you go about this practice,</p>
<p>make sure you do this practice</p>
<p>at least 80% of the days of your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If you miss a day, for instance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bedridden for a day,</p>
<p>try and get next to a window.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are traveling or for whatever reason,</p>
<p>you are not able to get outside</p>
<p>first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Well then try to get twice as much sunlight in your eyes,</p>
<p>or I should say,</p>
<p>extend the duration of sunlight viewing in the morning</p>
<p>for twice as long the following day.</p>
<p>This is a slow integrative mechanism</p>
<p>that underlies this whole thing of wakefulness</p>
<p>during the day and sleep at night due to sunlight viewing.</p>
<p>And if you miss a day,</p>
<p>you can make up for it the next day,</p>
<p>but you have to get twice as much light</p>
<p>or twice as much duration of light.</p>
<p>If you really want to get technical</p>
<p>and you really want to measure</p>
<p>how much light is in your environment,</p>
<p>you can download a free app,</p>
<p>something like Light Meter.</p>
<p>And that will allow your phone</p>
<p>to act as a bit of a light meter.</p>
<p>It gives you a pretty accurate measurement</p>
<p>of how many lux,</p>
<p>which is a measure of brightness</p>
<p>are in your environment in the morning.</p>
<p>And in general,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just going to be a good tool</p>
<p>for evaluating your environments.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I suggest you do.</p>
<p>Wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>take Light Meter,</p>
<p>point it at the brightest light in your home</p>
<p>and take a measurement.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll probably find is it&rsquo;s about a thousand lux.</p>
<p>Now go outside.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s some sunlight out</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s cloud cover,</p>
<p>point it at the sky and press that button.</p>
<p>You can actually hold it down</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll give you a dynamically updated lux measurement.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll find is like 5,000, 10,000,</p>
<p>sometimes even 90,000 lux,</p>
<p>even though you don&rsquo;t experience it as so much brighter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because an indoor artificial light</p>
<p>is very concentrated over a small spatial area,</p>
<p>whereas the sunlight is very diffuse,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s that diffuse, very bright sunlight,</p>
<p>that photon energy that you really want</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to set all the rhythms of your brain and body</p>
<p>in the proper way,</p>
<p>not just that cortisol peak,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s going to trigger proper metabolism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to set a timer for you to be able to fall asleep</p>
<p>about 16 hours later and on and on and on.</p>
<p>And I should mention within the on and on and on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also going to suppress any melatonin,</p>
<p>a hormone that makes you sleepy,</p>
<p>that happens to be swimming around in your bloodstream</p>
<p>at the time you wake up.</p>
<p>It does a number of other things too,</p>
<p>including interact with the adenosine system</p>
<p>and kind of wash out some of the adenosine</p>
<p>that might still be residual if you didn&rsquo;t sleep enough.</p>
<p>Fundamentally speaking, get that morning sunlight viewing.</p>
<p>I promise you will be grateful that you did.</p>
<p>It makes everybody feel better, feel more alert,</p>
<p>and it will greatly assist with your ability to fall</p>
<p>and stay asleep later that night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal</p>
<p>and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we&rsquo;re still focusing</p>
<p>on this early part of the day when you&rsquo;ve woken up,</p>
<p>like the first hour or so after waking.</p>
<p>And we can go to our list of other levers and tools, right?</p>
<p>We have light and dark.</p>
<p>We already talked about light and sunlight in particular.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got temperature, food, exercise, caffeine,</p>
<p>supplements, and digital tools.</p>
<p>Now, once you&rsquo;ve woken up and you want to be awake, okay?</p>
<p>So this is likely to be early in the day</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re following a more standard schedule.</p>
<p>You will also want to leverage not just light,</p>
<p>but temperature as a tool.</p>
<p>If you are inclined, it would be wise to try</p>
<p>and increase your core body temperature a bit more quickly</p>
<p>than it would otherwise if you were to just, you know,</p>
<p>shuffle around outside, get your sunlight,</p>
<p>maybe read a little bit, et cetera.</p>
<p>And there are two main ways you can do that.</p>
<p>The first way is to get into cold water of some sort.</p>
<p>This could be a cold shower</p>
<p>of anywhere from one to three minutes.</p>
<p>This could be an ice bath.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s your thing, it could be a cold tub.</p>
<p>Or if you own a cold tub that&rsquo;s specifically designed</p>
<p>for deliberate cold exposure, get under some cold water.</p>
<p>That will certainly wake you up.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever jumped into cold water</p>
<p>or had a cold shower, you know it really wakes you up</p>
<p>because you release adrenaline, epinephrine</p>
<p>from both your brain and body.</p>
<p>The body from your adrenals and your brain</p>
<p>from a little cluster of neurons called locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>Again, the names don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>One to three minutes of cold water exposure</p>
<p>will wake you up because of that adrenaline release.</p>
<p>And, and I want to highlight the and,</p>
<p>it will serve to increase your core body temperature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Your body and brain interact as a bit of a thermostat system</p>
<p>where if you put something cold on the surface of your body,</p>
<p>your brain, a little cluster of neurons</p>
<p>in the so-called medial preoptic area,</p>
<p>act as a thermostat and say, ah,</p>
<p>the external of my body is cold.</p>
<p>And therefore I&rsquo;m going to heat up my core body temperature.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little bit paradoxical.</p>
<p>People think, oh, if you get into cold water or an ice bath,</p>
<p>your body temperature is going to drop.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s true if you stay in for a while,</p>
<p>but if you just get in for about one to three minutes</p>
<p>or under the cold shower for one to three minutes,</p>
<p>your core body temperature will increase.</p>
<p>So then when you get out of that cold water,</p>
<p>your body temperature is increasing at a rate,</p>
<p>at a slope that&rsquo;s steeper than it would otherwise.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to feel more alert.</p>
<p>It also has the advantage of increasing,</p>
<p>not just adrenaline, but dopamine,</p>
<p>which is a molecule involved in motivation, focus, et cetera.</p>
<p>So this is great for waking up.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got sunlight,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got temperature triggered by cold water,</p>
<p>and we have exercise.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to increase your core body temperature</p>
<p>early in the day is to do exercise.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might choose to do your full-blown workout</p>
<p>for the day first thing when you wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>I always say the best time to exercise,</p>
<p>at least what the research points to,</p>
<p>is immediately when you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>or three hours after waking or 11 hours after waking.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really getting down into optimization</p>
<p>for sake of muscular strength and grip strength.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to give a strict prescriptive.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I suggest.</p>
<p>If you want to be alert early in the day</p>
<p>and you want to sleep great at night,</p>
<p>get that bright sunlight, get into some cold water.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t want to get into some cold water,</p>
<p>try and get some movement.</p>
<p>It could be a walk.</p>
<p>So you can get your sunlight exposure</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re taking a walk first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>It could be a light jog.</p>
<p>It could be skipping rope.</p>
<p>These days I skip rope for about 10 minutes or 20 minutes</p>
<p>while looking at the sun.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to layer in these different things</p>
<p>for waking up.</p>
<p>And then I take a cold shower afterwards.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;ve been doing as of lately,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t do that all year long necessarily.</p>
<p>Or some of you are going to be working out mid morning.</p>
<p>I sometimes do that,</p>
<p>but try and get your core body temperature increased</p>
<p>first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>And a great way to do that is with the cold water</p>
<p>and or with exercise.</p>
<p>And again, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be your full blown workout</p>
<p>for the day if you&rsquo;re doing workouts consistently,</p>
<p>which I hope everybody is</p>
<p>because everybody really should exercise</p>
<p>at least I believe five or six</p>
<p>or maybe even seven days a week.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s six days a week, sometimes five,</p>
<p>rarely is it seven.</p>
<p>So get that exercise</p>
<p>or even just a modest amount of movement,</p>
<p>walking, jogging, skipping rope, some light calisthenics.</p>
<p>That will further increase your core body temperature</p>
<p>and help you feel more awake.</p>
<p>Then we have the category of caffeine.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re just talking about this early part</p>
<p>of the day and you might be saying, wait a second,</p>
<p>I thought this was an episode about tools for sleep.</p>
<p>Well, everything that we&rsquo;re talking about doing</p>
<p>in these first 60 to 90 minutes of the day,</p>
<p>really set in motion a wave of biological cascades</p>
<p>that carry through the entire day and into the evening</p>
<p>and into the night and really do serve to optimize sleep.</p>
<p>So just hang in there with me.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are interested in focus</p>
<p>and attention, your ability to learn all of these tools</p>
<p>and practices are going to greatly enhance those as well.</p>
<p>So the next category of tool for use early in the day</p>
<p>is caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a very important compound to think about.</p>
<p>I do realize that some people who are prone to anxiety,</p>
<p>especially panic attacks, anxiety attacks</p>
<p>might avoid caffeine entirely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely fine.</p>
<p>You do not have to drink caffeine.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m about to describe are ways to leverage caffeine</p>
<p>use to optimize sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with caffeine, if you like caffeine,</p>
<p>I happen to love caffeine.</p>
<p>I like it in the form of coffee or espresso</p>
<p>or yerba mate tea.</p>
<p>In particular, non-smoked varieties of yerba mate teas.</p>
<p>Non-smoked because the smoked varieties seem to carry</p>
<p>some carcinogenic, some cancer causing risk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s increasing data on that.</p>
<p>So non-smoked varieties of yerba mate.</p>
<p>So caffeine is something that a lot of people consume</p>
<p>early in the day.</p>
<p>How much depends on your tolerance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of individual variability here.</p>
<p>Again, caffeine is a adenosine antagonist</p>
<p>or effectively works as a adenosine antagonist</p>
<p>and limits sleepiness.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that everybody delay their caffeine</p>
<p>intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>However painful it may be to eventually arrive at that 90</p>
<p>to 120 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>You want, and I encourage you to clear out whatever</p>
<p>residual adenosine is circulating in your system</p>
<p>in that first 90 to 120 minutes of the day,</p>
<p>get that sunlight exposure, get some movement to wake up.</p>
<p>And then, and only then start to ingest caffeine</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;ll do if you delay caffeine intake</p>
<p>until 90 to 120 minutes after waking</p>
<p>is you will avoid this so-called afternoon crash.</p>
<p>And you may still get a little bit of dip in energy</p>
<p>in the afternoon, but it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>that massive crash.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the reasons for that crash</p>
<p>on previous episodes.</p>
<p>But if you delay your caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes</p>
<p>after waking, you are doing yourself a great service</p>
<p>towards wakefulness and to avoid the crash.</p>
<p>And the afternoon crash has another liability to it,</p>
<p>which is typically people will emerge from that afternoon</p>
<p>crash, either grumpy or groggy,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll lean into drinking more caffeine,</p>
<p>which can then disrupt their sleep.</p>
<p>So wait 90 to 120 minutes after waking in the morning</p>
<p>to drink caffeine.</p>
<p>And if you drink caffeine at any point throughout the day,</p>
<p>really try and avoid any caffeine.</p>
<p>Certainly avoid drinking more than a hundred milligrams</p>
<p>of caffeine after 4 p.m.</p>
<p>And probably even better to limit your last caffeine intake</p>
<p>to 3 p.m. or even 2 p.m.</p>
<p>And for many people shifting that caffeine intake</p>
<p>from immediately after waking in the morning</p>
<p>to 90 to 120 minutes,</p>
<p>gives them a much longer arc of energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t feel the need to drink more caffeine</p>
<p>later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>If you do drink caffeine later in the afternoon,</p>
<p>really try and limit the total amount or drink decaf.</p>
<p>Certainly keep the total amount to less than a hundred</p>
<p>milligrams if you are interested in getting into the best</p>
<p>possible sleep.</p>
<p>And I say this knowing that many people, including myself,</p>
<p>can drink a double espresso with 200 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>or more at 5 p.m. or even 6 p.m. or after dinner,</p>
<p>and still quote unquote fall asleep fine</p>
<p>or still sleep fine.</p>
<p>However, there are terrific data.</p>
<p>Matt Walker and I talked about this,</p>
<p>and there are more and more papers all the time that point</p>
<p>to the fact that caffeine intake late in the day,</p>
<p>after 4 p.m. that is,</p>
<p>can really disrupt the architecture of your sleep.</p>
<p>So you might think you&rsquo;re sleeping well,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not sleeping nearly as well as you could</p>
<p>if you avoided caffeine in those afternoon hours.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might be doing your main bout of exercise</p>
<p>first thing in the morning,</p>
<p>and you want your caffeine before that bout of exercise.</p>
<p>In that case, I say, go for it.</p>
<p>Drink your caffeine, do your workout right after waking up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that.</p>
<p>You will find, however,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to get an early afternoon dip in energy.</p>
<p>And that dip in energy is going to be substantial because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a dip in energy that naturally follows that</p>
<p>workout from the morning.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s dependent on temperature,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be related to the elimination of that</p>
<p>adenosine blockade by caffeine.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting a kind of a one,</p>
<p>two punch on your energy levels by taking a lot of caffeine</p>
<p>and exercising early in the day,</p>
<p>you can sort of expect that you&rsquo;re going to get a drop in</p>
<p>energy in the early afternoon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay if that&rsquo;s works for you,</p>
<p>but just know that delaying that caffeine 90 to 120 minutes</p>
<p>after waking would be the ideal scenario,</p>
<p>most days and most scenarios.</p>
<p>All that said,</p>
<p>I absolutely respect the fact that people have different work</p>
<p>schedules, kid schedules, et cetera.</p>
<p>So if you want to do some or none or all these tools,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really up to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just providing them to you in the simplest form that I</p>
<p>can possibly provide them.</p>
<p>Now, the other lever or tool that you have available to you</p>
<p>is food, not just what you eat, but when you eat.</p>
<p>And it turns out that if you eat early in the day,</p>
<p>you support a biological clock mechanism that will make you</p>
<p>more alert early in the day.</p>
<p>That said many people choose to fast in the early morning</p>
<p>hours of the day or in the first part of the day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one such person.</p>
<p>I generally don&rsquo;t ingest any food until about 11 AM or 12</p>
<p>noon. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll have a protein shake.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll have some almonds.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll have breakfast.</p>
<p>If people are meeting for brunch or breakfast,</p>
<p>I will have breakfast for social reasons every once in a</p>
<p>while, but most of the time I don&rsquo;t eat until about lunch</p>
<p>time. However,</p>
<p>some people are really hungry when they wake up in the</p>
<p>morning, just know that if you eat early in the day,</p>
<p>you are further triggering an increase in metabolism and in</p>
<p>temperature that will make you more alert.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to eat early in the day,</p>
<p>but you can start to see how these different tools layer</p>
<p>together, sunlight, viewing exercise, cold water, eating.</p>
<p>Many of them are converging on the same mechanisms.</p>
<p>In fact, when you drink caffeine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a small increase in body temperature due to the</p>
<p>adrenaline increase that it stimulates.</p>
<p>So all of these things can be layered on top of one</p>
<p>another, or you can use them individually or think about</p>
<p>them individually.</p>
<p>Now food is an interesting lever or tool because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just about when you eat, but it&rsquo;s also about what you eat.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about eating for energy and what that</p>
<p>means in terms of caloric energy versus neural energy,</p>
<p>et cetera, in previous podcast episodes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to focus on that now because frankly,</p>
<p>to get into a description of whether or not somebody should</p>
<p>eat fruits or vegetables or animal proteins or dairy,</p>
<p>et cetera, early in the day, that&rsquo;s very nuanced.</p>
<p>But what you eat for your breakfast,</p>
<p>or if you choose to not eat breakfast is really up to you.</p>
<p>All that said, if you eat a very large meal,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you slept terrifically well,</p>
<p>10 hours the night before,</p>
<p>or if you are about to go to sleep,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s the middle of the afternoon,</p>
<p>if your gut is full of food,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a large volume of food in your gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to divert a lot of blood and other critical</p>
<p>resources away from other organs of your body,</p>
<p>in particular, your brain,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to be sleepy after eating a big meal.</p>
<p>So this is sort of a duh,</p>
<p>but I think oftentimes in the discussions about what to eat</p>
<p>for energy,</p>
<p>people neglect to consider food volume as a strong parameter</p>
<p>or variable in that discussion.</p>
<p>So if you eat a huge breakfast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that you are going to be tired immediately</p>
<p>after eating that breakfast,</p>
<p>unless of course you exercise very hard prior to that.</p>
<p>And you metabolize all that food very quickly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s up to you whether or not to eat first thing in the</p>
<p>morning or not.</p>
<p>But if you do eat in the first few hours of the morning,</p>
<p>just understand that you are setting,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re helping to set a food in trained as it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>circadian clock, light, temperature,</p>
<p>timing of food intake, movement, and exercise.</p>
<p>All of these things literally funnel in, in a neural sense,</p>
<p>they funnel into this thing that we call the circadian</p>
<p>clock, and they let that clock,</p>
<p>that set of neurons predict when you are likely to be eating</p>
<p>and active and viewing sunlight the next day.</p>
<p>And the next day and the next day,</p>
<p>I say all this because there are some beautiful studies and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll highlight one again in the show note captions that show</p>
<p>that if people are having a hard time waking up in the</p>
<p>morning,</p>
<p>one of the things they can do is maximize sunlight viewing</p>
<p>exercise in the morning, drink caffeine.</p>
<p>Although again,</p>
<p>I support the idea that that would best be done about 90 to</p>
<p>120 minutes after waking,</p>
<p>eating some food in those early morning hours, et cetera,</p>
<p>et cetera,</p>
<p>you can layer in multiple levers or tools in order to be</p>
<p>more alert.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what these levers and tools are really there for</p>
<p>in this sense of what we&rsquo;re talking about today,</p>
<p>which is optimizing sleep.</p>
<p>Yes, they will make you more alert.</p>
<p>Yes, they will provide some adrenaline and dopamine,</p>
<p>for instance, the cold water, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the reason we&rsquo;re talking about these things in the</p>
<p>context of sleep is that they start to give your body some</p>
<p>predictable autonomic timing.</p>
<p>What is predictable autonomic timing?</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>your autonomic nervous system is the components of your brain</p>
<p>and body that cause wakefulness and sleepiness.</p>
<p>And you can start to create some predictability in that</p>
<p>autonomic timing.</p>
<p>You can start to do things that really make it such that you</p>
<p>naturally wake up at six in the morning or five in the</p>
<p>morning. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who naturally is a night owl,</p>
<p>who likes to stay up until two in the morning and sleep until</p>
<p>10 AM and you now have a job or you have to go to school or</p>
<p>you have a partner that likes to get up early and go to</p>
<p>sleep early.</p>
<p>Well, you can make that happen.</p>
<p>And you can make that happen pretty painlessly.</p>
<p>If you take a week or so and go to sleep 30 minutes or an</p>
<p>hour earlier each night,</p>
<p>set an alarm and wake up 30 minutes or an hour earlier each</p>
<p>morning until of course you&rsquo;re waking up at the time you</p>
<p>want to wake up.</p>
<p>And then even in that groggy state, get some exercise,</p>
<p>get some sunlight viewing.</p>
<p>If the sun&rsquo;s not out, turn on those bright,</p>
<p>artificial lights, have some breakfast.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not hungry.</p>
<p>In fact, for those of you that engage in shift work,</p>
<p>because you have to or travel and you&rsquo;re jet lagged,</p>
<p>one of the quickest ways to shift your circadian clock and</p>
<p>get onto the local schedule is to eat on the local schedule.</p>
<p>So what all these tools do is they really set up a cascade.</p>
<p>Think of it as kind of a wave front of wakefulness and</p>
<p>focus throughout the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take you through the middle of the day in the</p>
<p>afternoon stages we&rsquo;ll talk about in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but really they take you to this period that is about 5 PM</p>
<p>until your bedtime.</p>
<p>I realize some people are going to bed very early,</p>
<p>like 8 PM or 9 PM, which to me seems very early,</p>
<p>but very few people go to sleep at 5 PM, right?</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re doing that for shift work or other reasons,</p>
<p>but from 5 PM until bedtime is really a critical period in</p>
<p>which you need to leverage particular tools in order to get</p>
<p>and stay asleep optimally and to be able to sleep through</p>
<p>the night.</p>
<p>So really there are three critical periods throughout each</p>
<p>24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>And during each of those critical periods,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to do as many specific things as you can</p>
<p>to optimize your wakefulness and focus and mood throughout</p>
<p>the day and your sleep at night.</p>
<p>The first critical period is the one that we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about up until now.</p>
<p>Things like morning sunlight, viewing caffeine,</p>
<p>90 to 120 minutes after waking, exercise, and so on.</p>
<p>We can call that critical period one.</p>
<p>And it really encompasses the time from which you wake up</p>
<p>until about three hours after waking.</p>
<p>Although I should just mention,</p>
<p>because there are always those people say, wait,</p>
<p>I wake up at 4 AM and the sun isn&rsquo;t out until 8 AM.</p>
<p>Okay, so it might be four hours,</p>
<p>but really it&rsquo;s those early morning hours of your day.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>The second critical period is the time throughout the day and</p>
<p>afternoon leading into evening.</p>
<p>So you may ask what are the things that you can do</p>
<p>throughout the day,</p>
<p>the middle of your day and into the afternoon and evening</p>
<p>hours that are really going to set you up for the best</p>
<p>possible sleep later that night.</p>
<p>Well, there are a few do&rsquo;s and there are a few don&rsquo;ts.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>be careful about ingesting too much caffeine throughout the</p>
<p>middle of the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of an obvious one for the reasons that we talked</p>
<p>about earlier.</p>
<p>Second of all, if you are a napper and I raise my hand now,</p>
<p>for those of you listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m raising my right hand because I love naps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved naps.</p>
<p>Nowadays I do NSDR or a reverie sleep hypnosis almost every</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>And I tend to do that, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>in the early afternoon hours, if I&rsquo;m feeling kind of sleepy,</p>
<p>because even though I optimize my caffeine intake,</p>
<p>timing, et cetera,</p>
<p>I tend to get a little sleepy in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Most people get a little sleepy in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Some of that is related to hitting that peak of body</p>
<p>temperature. And you might think, wait,</p>
<p>I thought high body temperature is associated with alertness</p>
<p>and it is,</p>
<p>but right as you crest that high body temperature and your</p>
<p>body temperature starts to drop,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tendency to be a little bit sleepy.</p>
<p>So some of you might opt to take a nap in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Should you nap? Should you not nap?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question that I get asked a lot.</p>
<p>And that I asked Dr.</p>
<p>Matthew Walker when he was a guest on this podcast,</p>
<p>here was his answer.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what the data support.</p>
<p>It is fine to nap in the afternoon,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t nap so late in the day or for so long that it</p>
<p>disrupts your ability to fall and stay asleep at night for</p>
<p>your major sleep bout. Okay.</p>
<p>So naps are fine,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t sleep so long during the day or too late in the</p>
<p>day that it disrupts your ability to fall and stay asleep.</p>
<p>I should also say you do not have to nap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of an interesting phenomenon that happens on</p>
<p>these podcasts and on social media,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ll talk about naps and the fact that naps are</p>
<p>great and don&rsquo;t make them longer than 90 minutes,</p>
<p>but then all the non-nappers get really worried.</p>
<p>Like, wait, am I supposed to nap? I don&rsquo;t like naps.</p>
<p>I wake up groggy. You do not have to nap.</p>
<p>In fact, if you can make it through your whole day without</p>
<p>napping, great, more power to you.</p>
<p>But if you do nap and you find that naps serve you well,</p>
<p>keep those naps shorter than 90 minutes for reasons related</p>
<p>to ultradian cycles and so forth,</p>
<p>and make sure that you don&rsquo;t nap too late in the day that</p>
<p>you are then staying up too late at night and having a hard</p>
<p>time waking up the next morning.</p>
<p>I will say that for a lot of people who do not like naps or</p>
<p>that find they wake up really grumpy from naps or groggy</p>
<p>from naps, I encourage you to try the Reverie app,</p>
<p>try an NSDR script, try yoga, Nidra,</p>
<p>try something of that sort for anywhere from 10 to 20 to 30</p>
<p>minutes. I tend to do this every day.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll just lie down and I love yoga, Nidra.</p>
<p>I love NSDR scripts.</p>
<p>I love using the Reverie app in particular,</p>
<p>the portion of the Reverie app that gets you better at</p>
<p>sleeping.</p>
<p>It really is beneficial for me because it serves as very</p>
<p>replenishing while I&rsquo;m doing that hypnosis,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also gotten me much better at falling and staying</p>
<p>asleep and falling back asleep in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>So this critical period throughout the day is one in which</p>
<p>most people are doing a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re emailing and picking up kids and they&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re commuting and doing all sorts of things,</p>
<p>taking phone calls and zooms, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if you can get that period of deep relaxation through a</p>
<p>nap or NSDR, that&rsquo;s going to serve you well,</p>
<p>try not to drink too much caffeine,</p>
<p>certainly no more than a hundred milligrams of caffeine after</p>
<p>4 p.m. if your goal is to fall asleep at a reasonably normal</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And for those of you that exercise in the afternoon,</p>
<p>understand that if you exercise very intensely,</p>
<p>so this might be weight training or running or some other</p>
<p>very intense exercise,</p>
<p>typically that&rsquo;s going to further increase your body</p>
<p>temperature.</p>
<p>It makes sense, right?</p>
<p>Based on everything we know about metabolism and body</p>
<p>temperature,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to so-called delay your circadian clock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to make it such that you want to fall asleep a</p>
<p>little bit later, maybe even a lot later.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re exercising in the afternoon or evening,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the only time you can exercise,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s the time that you prefer to exercise great,</p>
<p>but be careful about ingesting too much caffeine in order to</p>
<p>get the energy to do that exercise.</p>
<p>Cause that caffeine will disrupt your sleep and just know</p>
<p>that you are delaying your circadian clock.</p>
<p>You are making it such that you will naturally want to go to</p>
<p>sleep later and wake up later.</p>
<p>Contrast that with, if you exercise early in the day,</p>
<p>say immediately after waking up or in the first zero to four</p>
<p>hours after waking in most cases,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to shift your circadian clock much.</p>
<p>And toward the end of the episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about forced exercise prior to wake</p>
<p>up times.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean doing exercise in your sleep.</p>
<p>That means deliberately setting alarm and getting out of</p>
<p>bed much earlier than you naturally would.</p>
<p>That turns out to be a very potent tool to so-called advance</p>
<p>your circadian clock.</p>
<p>So we can talk about that a little bit later in the episode,</p>
<p>but this critical period two in the middle of the day is</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going to want to leverage specific tools.</p>
<p>And we talked about those limiting caffeine intake,</p>
<p>being mindful of the clock delaying effects of exercise.</p>
<p>The fact that also, if you&rsquo;re going to nap,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to nap too long or too late into the day.</p>
<p>Otherwise you&rsquo;ll disrupt your nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>So this critical period two or second critical period,</p>
<p>I should say during the middle of the day is a time in which</p>
<p>you should be doing certain things and avoiding doing</p>
<p>certain things.</p>
<p>So that raises the question of whether or not you should also</p>
<p>be getting a lot of light in particular sunlight throughout</p>
<p>the day.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s something that hasn&rsquo;t been explored too much in</p>
<p>the literature until recently when Dr. Sam Rathar,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the director of the chronobiology unit at the national</p>
<p>institutes of mental health has decided to do a number of</p>
<p>experiments,</p>
<p>exploring the effects of light on mood and other aspects of</p>
<p>brain function and body function.</p>
<p>When that light is delivered, not just in the morning,</p>
<p>which is great for us, but also throughout the day.</p>
<p>So should you be looking at sunlight or bright artificial</p>
<p>lights throughout the day?</p>
<p>Now on the face of it, you might just think, yes,</p>
<p>you know, sunlight&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>provided we&rsquo;re not getting a sunburn and we&rsquo;re not staring at</p>
<p>the sun and damaging our eyes.</p>
<p>We should get as much sunlight as we possibly can.</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p>we talked about this in the episode on hormones,</p>
<p>about how getting light onto as much of our skin as we can</p>
<p>throughout the day can really help in the production of</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen in both men and women and healthy</p>
<p>ways that improves mood and libido and all sorts of things</p>
<p>that are associated with wellbeing.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>because light is such a powerful stimulus for controlling</p>
<p>the timing of your sleepfulness or sleepiness,</p>
<p>I should say, and wakefulness,</p>
<p>we might want to be cautious about how much light we are</p>
<p>viewing in the afternoon,</p>
<p>in particular in the early evening hours, right?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it&rsquo;s not so straightforward viewing.</p>
<p>So sunlight to the eyes,</p>
<p>sunlight in the late afternoon and evening hours.</p>
<p>So again, depends on time of year,</p>
<p>depends on location that you happen to be in,</p>
<p>but getting some sunlight in your eyes for, again,</p>
<p>maybe five or 10, maybe 30 minutes,</p>
<p>depending on how much cloud cover there is,</p>
<p>doing that in the afternoon serves an additional beneficial</p>
<p>purpose,</p>
<p>which is you protect or you inoculate your nervous system</p>
<p>against some of the negative effects of bright artificial</p>
<p>light,</p>
<p>or even dim artificial light in the nighttime hours between</p>
<p>10 PM and 4 AM,</p>
<p>which is really critical period three.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about what to do and what to not do during</p>
<p>critical period three of every 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>But to make it very clear what I&rsquo;m saying here,</p>
<p>get that morning sunlight in your eyes,</p>
<p>but also get some sunlight in your eyes in the late</p>
<p>afternoon and evening hours,</p>
<p>when the sun is at so-called low solar angle,</p>
<p>when it starts to descend in the sky, again,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to stare directly at the sun,</p>
<p>although if you can catch a nice, beautiful sunset,</p>
<p>go for it.</p>
<p>But as the sun starts to descend,</p>
<p>it triggers those same neurons in your eye that communicate</p>
<p>with your circadian clock,</p>
<p>but it communicates with a different component or different</p>
<p>compartment within the circadian clock.</p>
<p>That circadian clock is not just one thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s multiple things.</p>
<p>And you have what are called morning oscillators and evening</p>
<p>oscillators.</p>
<p>And to make a long story short,</p>
<p>the tool that I&rsquo;m describing of looking at the sun in the</p>
<p>late afternoon and evening, again, blinking is fine.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stare at the sun,</p>
<p>but getting that sunlight in your eyes in the late afternoon</p>
<p>and evening signals to that clock that it&rsquo;s evening time and</p>
<p>that sleep is coming.</p>
<p>It also serves as a second anchor or reference point for</p>
<p>your body and your brain to know where it is in time.</p>
<p>Remember back to the beginning of the episode when I said</p>
<p>your brain and your body and all your organs are locked</p>
<p>inside this skin and the skull,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in the outside world.</p>
<p>Well, that morning sunlight viewing and the other things you</p>
<p>do during critical period one,</p>
<p>those provide one strong set of signals that it&rsquo;s wake up</p>
<p>time and time to be alert and time to be focused.</p>
<p>And then in the evening,</p>
<p>by getting sunlight in your eyes again,</p>
<p>and in particular sunlight that comes from low solar angle</p>
<p>sunlight, well,</p>
<p>that provides a second stimulus or a second reference point</p>
<p>that tells your brain and body, Hey, it&rsquo;s evening.</p>
<p>The sun is descending.</p>
<p>And you might say, wait,</p>
<p>how does the brain and these neurons know the difference</p>
<p>between morning light and evening light?</p>
<p>It turns out has to do with the particular wavelengths of</p>
<p>light that are present in morning versus evening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible mechanism.</p>
<p>And you are probably familiar with the fact that when the</p>
<p>sun is directly overhead, it&rsquo;s really bright,</p>
<p>white and yellow, and the sky is often blue.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s cloud cover,</p>
<p>it just comes through as a bunch of bright light.</p>
<p>Well, next time you&rsquo;re out in the morning,</p>
<p>take a look at what a sunrise looks like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of yellow, blue contrast,</p>
<p>and those yellow blues signal important specific sets of</p>
<p>cells in your eye and brain that it&rsquo;s morning in the evening.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also going to see yellow and blue,</p>
<p>but the ratio of yellows and blues has now changed.</p>
<p>And you also see some oranges and in a really brilliant</p>
<p>sunset, you&rsquo;ll see some reds.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t noticed this already,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll really want to look for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like kind of fun and cool to look at.</p>
<p>Well, those yellows and blues and oranges that you see in the</p>
<p>evening sunsets, those signal to your brain and body,</p>
<p>that evening is there and that nighttime is coming.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really establishing a second reference point or</p>
<p>wave front of biological signals that are going to optimize</p>
<p>your nighttime hours and your transition into really</p>
<p>terrific sleep.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about what I&rsquo;m calling critical period</p>
<p>three of each 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>So this would be the period of time of late evening.</p>
<p>So it might be 6 PM for some,</p>
<p>depending on when you go to sleep or 7 PM extending into the</p>
<p>hours in which you decide to get into bed and go to sleep.</p>
<p>And then throughout the night,</p>
<p>there are a number of things that you&rsquo;re going to want to do.</p>
<p>And there are a number of things that you are going to want</p>
<p>to avoid doing in order to optimize your sleep.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to avoid bright artificial lights of</p>
<p>any color. Yes. Of any color.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked a lot about blue blockers, you know,</p>
<p>lenses that block blue wavelengths or short wavelengths of</p>
<p>light. I don&rsquo;t have anything against blue blockers.</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p>many people find that blue blockers provide them some relief</p>
<p>from headache and some eye strain if they wear blue blockers</p>
<p>throughout the day and certainly at night,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need them.</p>
<p>And even if you do wear them,</p>
<p>you will find that if lights are very bright,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a blue light,</p>
<p>a yellow light or a red light,</p>
<p>those bright lights will wake up your brain and body.</p>
<p>They will activate the same mechanisms that were activated</p>
<p>early in the day by sunlight.</p>
<p>However, and here&rsquo;s the really diabolical twist.</p>
<p>I mentioned this earlier,</p>
<p>but the diabolical twist in the way that your brain and body</p>
<p>respond to light is that early in the day,</p>
<p>in the morning hours,</p>
<p>you need a lot of bright light,</p>
<p>ideally from sunlight to be very alert and to wake up.</p>
<p>But in the evening hours and nighttime hours,</p>
<p>it takes very little light,</p>
<p>very few photons in order to wake up your brain and body and</p>
<p>to disrupt your circadian clock and disrupt your sleep.</p>
<p>So what that means is that once the sun goes down,</p>
<p>which of course is going to happen at different times of</p>
<p>year in different places on earth.</p>
<p>But once the sun goes down,</p>
<p>you would be wise to try and dim the lights in your indoor</p>
<p>environment most days, right?</p>
<p>I realized some nights you&rsquo;re going to throw a party and</p>
<p>have people over.</p>
<p>You might not want to dim the lights.</p>
<p>Some nights you&rsquo;re going to go out.</p>
<p>You might view a lot of bright lights,</p>
<p>but most nights of your life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to dim the lights in your internal</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>And ideally the lights that you do use,</p>
<p>you would place low in that physical environment.</p>
<p>So you would try and not use overhead lights,</p>
<p>but rather rely on desk lamps or lights,</p>
<p>even place low to the floor, even on the floor.</p>
<p>If you are going to use light at night, and most people do,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to use as little artificial light as</p>
<p>is required to carry out the activities you need to require</p>
<p>safely.</p>
<p>That could be studying in which case you might need a</p>
<p>little bit more light in order to read or study.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re watching a television show or you&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>something on your computer, dim that screen way,</p>
<p>way down as dim as possible while still, of course,</p>
<p>being able to view what you need to view.</p>
<p>Even better, I should say,</p>
<p>ideally you would use candlelight and or moonlight.</p>
<p>Now some nights the moon is really bright and you actually</p>
<p>can use moonlight to go about your usual activities.</p>
<p>Moonlight might seem very, very bright,</p>
<p>but actually moonlight is fairly low light intensity and</p>
<p>candlelight, which can also seem very bright,</p>
<p>actually is very low light intensity.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sitting across the table with some candlelight</p>
<p>there and it&rsquo;s a really bright candle,</p>
<p>chances are it&rsquo;s only about three to 10 Lux,</p>
<p>which is very, very little light energy compared to say an</p>
<p>artificial desk lamp or an overhead light,</p>
<p>which is going to be in the area of anywhere from a hundred</p>
<p>to a thousand Lux.</p>
<p>So candlelight is fine, of course,</p>
<p>be cautious with open flame, but candlelight is fine.</p>
<p>Moonlight is fine.</p>
<p>Dimming artificial lights is fine,</p>
<p>provided they&rsquo;re dimmed way, way down.</p>
<p>And again,</p>
<p>try and avoid using overhead artificial lights.</p>
<p>The absolute worst lights are going to be overhead</p>
<p>fluorescent lights of the sort that you would have in the</p>
<p>supermarket or that you would see at a gas station or</p>
<p>something of that sort.</p>
<p>And I confess there are times in which I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>driving home and it&rsquo;s late at night and I want to be able to</p>
<p>get to sleep and I&rsquo;ll need to stop at the grocery store or a</p>
<p>gas station or something like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually put on sunglasses at night in order to avoid</p>
<p>getting that bright light exposure at night.</p>
<p>Although that&rsquo;s a little bit extreme.</p>
<p>I have done that from time to time because that bright light</p>
<p>exposure will absolutely quash.</p>
<p>It will eliminate any melatonin that happens to be</p>
<p>circulating in your brain and body.</p>
<p>Now, melatonin, a lot of people think of as a supplement,</p>
<p>but melatonin is naturally released as the evening comes</p>
<p>about and into the nighttime hours,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hormone that makes you feel sleepy and allows you to</p>
<p>fall asleep.</p>
<p>So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and</p>
<p>nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality</p>
<p>and your ability to fall and stay asleep.</p>
<p>So for most people,</p>
<p>a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright</p>
<p>artificial lights of all colors.</p>
<p>And in particular overhead,</p>
<p>bright artificial lights between the hours of 10 PM and 4</p>
<p>AM. That&rsquo;s right between 10 PM and 4 AM,</p>
<p>avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible use</p>
<p>only as much light as is absolutely necessary in order to</p>
<p>carry out the routines and activities you need to carry out</p>
<p>safely.</p>
<p>I should mention that the reason overhead lights are</p>
<p>problematic is the same reason why sunlight is so great</p>
<p>early in the day, which is that the cells that is the</p>
<p>neurons that can wake up your brain and body through</p>
<p>activation of the circadian clock reside mainly in the</p>
<p>bottom half or two thirds of your neural retina.</p>
<p>And the way the optics of your eyes work is that the cells</p>
<p>on the bottom half of your eye view the upper visual field.</p>
<p>So this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism that allows these</p>
<p>cells to respond to overhead light from sunlight in the</p>
<p>early part of the day and throughout the day.</p>
<p>But in the evening,</p>
<p>if you have bright artificial lights on in those bright</p>
<p>artificial lights or overhead lights,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to more closely mimic what sunlight does in the</p>
<p>evening time.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be a bad thing.</p>
<p>If your goal is to eventually go to sleep.</p>
<p>So again, do like the Scandinavians do use lights that are</p>
<p>set low in the room at night.</p>
<p>And if you really want to optimize your sleep-wake cycles,</p>
<p>I suppose you could also do the opposite throughout the day.</p>
<p>You could really emphasize the use of bright artificial</p>
<p>lights and sunlight that comes from above.</p>
<p>And of course, sunlight always comes from above,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re working in a given, you know,</p>
<p>office environment and you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 2 PM or 3 PM and you want to be as awake as possible,</p>
<p>really crank up the overhead lights.</p>
<p>And then in the evening is,</p>
<p>which is this critical period three that we&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>really try and dim those lights or have them off or just</p>
<p>rely on candlelight or moonlight from the hours of about 10</p>
<p>PM until 4 AM.</p>
<p>Our good friend, Samer Hattar,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been on this podcast before.</p>
<p>Samer is director of the chronobiology unit at the national</p>
<p>institutes of mental health.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s absolutely obsessive about this light stuff and</p>
<p>avoiding light at night.</p>
<p>In fact, he lives in what I joke is like a cave at night from</p>
<p>9 PM until 5 AM, which is really his kind of sleep cycle.</p>
<p>He has his house so dark that you&rsquo;d be lucky to be able to</p>
<p>find a spoon in the kitchen.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;d be lucky to find your way down the hallway if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re me, but in any case,</p>
<p>dim the lights from them way, way down.</p>
<p>It will serve you well.</p>
<p>It will make it much easier for you to get sleepy and stay</p>
<p>sleepy and fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night.</p>
<p>Now not to depart from this critical period three,</p>
<p>but if you recall viewing that afternoon light, right?</p>
<p>The low solar angle light as the sun is heading down in the</p>
<p>sky.</p>
<p>So it could be sunset or what I call circus sunset around</p>
<p>sunset while doing that is going to slightly,</p>
<p>but not completely offset any of the negative effects of</p>
<p>viewing artificial light at night.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to give people a pass here,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you know that you&rsquo;re going to watch some</p>
<p>Netflix at night, or you&rsquo;re going to be up late studying,</p>
<p>and yet you still want to be able to fall and stay asleep.</p>
<p>Definitely make sure you see that evening light.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great study.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link to this study,</p>
<p>which showed that if people view evening sunset light or</p>
<p>evening sunsets or sunlight right around the time of sunset,</p>
<p>it really serves to inoculate or offset some again,</p>
<p>some not all of the negative effects of artificial light</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 PM and 4 AM.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>But as you recall,</p>
<p>we also have this tool related to temperature and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably not going to be surprised that the way to leverage</p>
<p>temperature in the evening is the exact opposite of the way</p>
<p>that you want to leverage temperature early in the day,</p>
<p>early in the day,</p>
<p>temperature increases from cold showers or exercise, et cetera,</p>
<p>wake you up.</p>
<p>What that means is that taking a cold shower late at night is</p>
<p>probably a bad idea rather taking a nice hot bath or a</p>
<p>sauna.</p>
<p>You might think would heat up your body.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s what happens if you stay in a very long</p>
<p>time, but if you do hot tub or a hot bath or a sauna in the</p>
<p>evening,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t stay in for more than 20 or 30 minutes and you</p>
<p>get out, you take maybe a cool ish shower or a warm shower.</p>
<p>Then what happens is there&rsquo;s a compensatory cooling off of</p>
<p>your core body temperature for the reasons we discussed</p>
<p>earlier and your body temperature will drop by one to three</p>
<p>degrees and it will make it much easier to get into sleep.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that enjoys hot baths,</p>
<p>hot showers or hot tubs evening and nighttime is going to</p>
<p>be the best time to do that.</p>
<p>If your goal is to facilitate sleep.</p>
<p>Similarly,</p>
<p>you should try and make your sleeping environment pretty</p>
<p>cool, if not cold.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to be cold while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>asleep.</p>
<p>You can get under as many blankets as you need,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good idea to make your sleeping environment cool.</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p>drop the temperature in that sleeping environment by at least</p>
<p>three degrees.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be happy that you did.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>some people rely on things like eight sleep that I use that</p>
<p>one of these controllable temperature mattress covers.</p>
<p>Other people would simply do this by putting a fan in the</p>
<p>room or opening a window again,</p>
<p>depends on time of year, depends on technology,</p>
<p>depends on budgets, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to want to sleep in a relatively cool or</p>
<p>cold sleeping environment and then layer on the blankets as</p>
<p>needed to stay asleep.</p>
<p>And I say as needed,</p>
<p>because one of the things that you&rsquo;re going to do in your</p>
<p>sleep,</p>
<p>or if you happen to wake up is if you&rsquo;re too warm,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to put a foot or a hand out from under those</p>
<p>blankets.</p>
<p>And the reason for doing that is very logical.</p>
<p>Once you understand the mechanism,</p>
<p>you have special portals.</p>
<p>You essentially have ways of passing heat, excuse me,</p>
<p>in and out of your body,</p>
<p>primarily through the palms of your hands,</p>
<p>the upper half of your face and the bottoms of your feet</p>
<p>through so-called glabrous skin.</p>
<p>This was covered in the episode with Dr. Craig Heller from</p>
<p>the biology department at Stanford.</p>
<p>If you lower the temperature in your sleeping environment,</p>
<p>so lower the temperature in that room,</p>
<p>or use a controllable mattress cover that can cool down like</p>
<p>eight sleep or something of that sort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s naturally going to make your sleep environment cooler.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re too warm under the blankets,</p>
<p>all you have to do is extend a hand or a foot out from under</p>
<p>those blankets.</p>
<p>Whereas if the sleeping environment that you&rsquo;re in is too</p>
<p>warm, there&rsquo;s very little you can do to cool off besides</p>
<p>push off those blankets.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re too warm and you&rsquo;re waking up in the middle of the</p>
<p>night, which is what happens if you get too warm,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll push off those blankets.</p>
<p>But if the room is too warm, well, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably have to put your hands into some cool water or</p>
<p>take a coolish shower or something for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not very practical,</p>
<p>better to just keep the sleeping environment cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of people putting socks on while they</p>
<p>sleep, or I should say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of putting socks on while I sleep because that</p>
<p>eliminates this glabrous skin portal on the bottoms of one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>feet. So for those of you that have heard, you know,</p>
<p>wear socks while you sleep,</p>
<p>that works great for people that tend to run too cold while</p>
<p>they sleep and wake up because their feet get cold.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re somebody who wakes up in the middle of the</p>
<p>night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waking up because you&rsquo;re getting too warm.</p>
<p>And the best thing that you could do is to cool or lower the</p>
<p>temperature in the room that you&rsquo;re sleeping and not wear</p>
<p>socks, get under as many blankets as you need to fall asleep.</p>
<p>And then across the night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll naturally just move a hand or a foot or all hands and</p>
<p>feet out from under those blankets to cool off because of</p>
<p>the relationship between temperature and sleep.</p>
<p>That is dropping your core body temperature one to three</p>
<p>degrees gets you into sleep and helps you stay asleep.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you do exercise late in the day and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>finding yourself very alert in the evening and you need to</p>
<p>fall asleep,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve exercised and you needed four cups of</p>
<p>espresso in order to do that exercise.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>there are a few things that you can do to try and bring your</p>
<p>nervous system down into more state of calmness.</p>
<p>And you can do that also by lowering your core body</p>
<p>temperature.</p>
<p>One of those I already talked about before taking a nice hot</p>
<p>shower or a hot bath,</p>
<p>and then getting out and cooling off will decrease your body</p>
<p>temperature.</p>
<p>Maybe not enough to get you into sleep.</p>
<p>If you have a ton of caffeine in your system, but again,</p>
<p>you can use this mechanism of temperature shifts to wake up</p>
<p>or temperature shifts to fall asleep in ways that really can</p>
<p>help you overcome some of the, you know,</p>
<p>irregularities in your sleep-wake cycle and exercise cycle,</p>
<p>et cetera, because of course, nobody&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>Some days we end up having a workout in the afternoon,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll miss the workout entirely.</p>
<p>Other days we end up having that cup of coffee in the</p>
<p>afternoon with a friend,</p>
<p>and then we have a hard time falling asleep.</p>
<p>So you can use these tools,</p>
<p>not just in their optimized form, you know,</p>
<p>being absolutely obsessive and compulsive about exactly when</p>
<p>you do each of those tools, that would be wonderful.</p>
<p>But life happens as they say,</p>
<p>and some days you&rsquo;re going to feel too alert at night and</p>
<p>you want to fall asleep,</p>
<p>or you got to get up especially early the next morning.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not somebody who normally goes to bed at 10 PM.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s when something like a hot bath or a sauna can</p>
<p>really benefit you because it can adjust your temperature</p>
<p>rhythm accordingly.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t touch on alcohol and CBD and</p>
<p>THC.</p>
<p>I always get questions about these.</p>
<p>And I should say, of course, many places, but not all THC is</p>
<p>illegal, although there are medical uses and some places</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s decriminalized other places it&rsquo;s legal.</p>
<p>Alcohol of course is consumed almost as frequently as</p>
<p>caffeine is consumed.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t drink alcohol.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything against it per se.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t tend to enjoy it.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I don&rsquo;t enjoy it is if I drink alcohol,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve simply fall asleep.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t really accomplish any of the things that I</p>
<p>really want to accomplish because the sleep that one gets</p>
<p>after drinking alcohol is greatly disrupted sleep.</p>
<p>Hate to break it to you, but that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>And when Dr. Matt Walker came on this podcast,</p>
<p>he said exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>While THC and alcohol do help some people fall asleep and</p>
<p>maybe even stay asleep.</p>
<p>The architecture of that sleep is suboptimal compared to the</p>
<p>sleep they would get without alcohol or THC in their system.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not here to tell you what to do or not to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not the substance police.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my role.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just reporting to you the biology.</p>
<p>If your sleep is not restoring you to the extent that you</p>
<p>feel it should,</p>
<p>or if you are regularly relying on a drink or two in order to</p>
<p>fall asleep or THC in order to fall asleep,</p>
<p>that is disrupting your total pattern of sleep.</p>
<p>However, I do realize that nowadays,</p>
<p>a lot of people are relying on THC and or CBD,</p>
<p>especially edible forms in order to fall and stay asleep.</p>
<p>And, you know, we can just acknowledge the data.</p>
<p>It does seem that there&rsquo;s a anxiety lowering effect of some</p>
<p>of those compounds that do help people who have a hard time</p>
<p>falling and staying asleep because of reasons related to</p>
<p>anxiety.</p>
<p>Although in a moment,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about some supplement and supplement protocols</p>
<p>that can also assist in the ability to fall and stay asleep</p>
<p>and that can adjust anxiety.</p>
<p>And that do not seem to disrupt sleep architecture in</p>
<p>negative ways.</p>
<p>And in fact,</p>
<p>can enhance the depth and quality of sleep architecture.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done everything correctly up until now,</p>
<p>you got your morning routine from critical period one,</p>
<p>you got your afternoon routine.</p>
<p>You saw some sunlight in the afternoon.</p>
<p>You avoided caffeine in the eight hours or 10 hours before</p>
<p>bedtime. You&rsquo;re not drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve cooled down the room.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing all these things, right?</p>
<p>You dim the lights, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>What else can we do in order to optimize our sleep?</p>
<p>Well, I always say behavioral tools first,</p>
<p>then look to nutrition.</p>
<p>Then if necessary, look to supplementation.</p>
<p>And then if still necessary, look to prescription drugs,</p>
<p>obviously prescribed by a board certified physician.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the behavioral tools for</p>
<p>critical period three.</p>
<p>We have not talked a lot about the supplementation based</p>
<p>tools.</p>
<p>There are supplements that for most people will greatly</p>
<p>improve their ability to fall and stay asleep.</p>
<p>And the three main supplements in that category or that kit</p>
<p>of sleep supplements,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked about these before are magnesium threonate.</p>
<p>So T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,</p>
<p>apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,</p>
<p>and theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine.</p>
<p>Now, some important things to point out about magthreonate</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called apigenin and theanine.</p>
<p>First of all, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to take all three,</p>
<p>although many people get a synergistic effect from taking</p>
<p>all three.</p>
<p>In fact, you may not even need to take even one.</p>
<p>What I recommend is that if you&rsquo;re already doing all the</p>
<p>behavioral tools regularly and you&rsquo;re still having trouble</p>
<p>falling asleep and staying asleep,</p>
<p>well then you might try one of the supplements within this</p>
<p>sleep stack.</p>
<p>They do have fairly wide margins for safety.</p>
<p>Although I should also say,</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re going to add or remove something from your</p>
<p>supplement protocol, your nutritional program,</p>
<p>you definitely want to talk to your physician.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect us.</p>
<p>I say that to protect you.</p>
<p>But for most people,</p>
<p>the margins of safety on these things are going to be pretty</p>
<p>broad. A couple of notes about dosages.</p>
<p>For some people,</p>
<p>the dosages of any one or several of the supplements I</p>
<p>mentioned will be zero.</p>
<p>That is you won&rsquo;t need them in order to get and stay asleep</p>
<p>most nights of your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrific if you don&rsquo;t need them.</p>
<p>For many people, however,</p>
<p>taking 145 milligrams of magnesium threonate can be very</p>
<p>beneficial.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dosage that most people will benefit from.</p>
<p>Some people need to go a little higher.</p>
<p>Some people need to go a little bit lower.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that we&rsquo;ve been pointing people towards</p>
<p>single ingredient formulations these days is because it</p>
<p>allows people to adjust the dosage of one component of a so</p>
<p>called sleep stack without having to disrupt the dosage of</p>
<p>another component and so on.</p>
<p>It also allows people to try just one element within the</p>
<p>sleep stack without having to purchase and try the others,</p>
<p>which is a problem if you&rsquo;re buying a blend of a lot of</p>
<p>different ingredients.</p>
<p>So 145 milligrams of magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>50, five, zero milligrams of apigenin.</p>
<p>And again, you could just take the apigenin on its own.</p>
<p>And 100 to 400 milligrams of theanine taken again,</p>
<p>alone or in combination with the other supplements mentioned</p>
<p>in this stack,</p>
<p>many people find allows them to get really drowsy and fall</p>
<p>asleep, sleep really deeply.</p>
<p>And they feel much more refreshed the next day.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t have a grogginess to them.</p>
<p>Now, a couple of notes about these different supplements,</p>
<p>about 5% of people report that magnesium threonate really</p>
<p>disrupts their gut.</p>
<p>It gives them diarrhea or gastric distress,</p>
<p>in which case don&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>If magnesium threonate disrupts your gut or your digestion</p>
<p>to a point where it&rsquo;s uncomfortable or at all,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t like it, don&rsquo;t take any of it.</p>
<p>The proper dosage for you, in other words,</p>
<p>would be zero milligrams.</p>
<p>Now in a slightly different way,</p>
<p>many people who can tolerate magnesium threonate or really</p>
<p>thrive on magnesium threonate and like apigenin might find</p>
<p>that theanine, even at the lowest dose of a hundred</p>
<p>milligrams, because again,</p>
<p>the range is a hundred to 400 milligrams that theanine gives</p>
<p>them such vivid dreams that they actually find it disruptive</p>
<p>or they wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>or they find that the sleep that they&rsquo;re getting is kind of</p>
<p>anxiety ridden because of the intensity of those dreams.</p>
<p>So some people might choose to leave theanine out of the</p>
<p>sleep stack and just take magnesium threonate or apigenin.</p>
<p>And again,</p>
<p>some people might leave magnesium threonate out of the</p>
<p>sleep stack.</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>all of this is really about finding the supplementation</p>
<p>protocol that&rsquo;s ideal for you.</p>
<p>I should mention that whether or not you&rsquo;re taking one or</p>
<p>two or three of the components of the sleep stack,</p>
<p>the ideal time to take those is 30 to 60 minutes before</p>
<p>bedtime,</p>
<p>especially if you haven&rsquo;t had anything to eat for the three</p>
<p>hours or so before bedtime.</p>
<p>I confess that oftentimes I&rsquo;ll have a little bit of a snack</p>
<p>late in the evening, some berries or something.</p>
<p>I try not to eat too close to bedtime,</p>
<p>but some evenings just because of work schedule,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get home late,</p>
<p>be 9 PM and I&rsquo;ll eat a big meal.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll take the sleep stack and fall asleep.</p>
<p>Every once in a while that just so happens.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>Certainly I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>but that sleep stack can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>And I do think that it&rsquo;s preferable to melatonin.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the reason.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>melatonin is a hormone that you endogenously make.</p>
<p>You now know a lot about melatonin and its control by light,</p>
<p>meaning light inhibits it or eliminates it.</p>
<p>Darkness promotes it and melatonin indeed can help us fall</p>
<p>asleep.</p>
<p>But the dosages of melatonin that are contained in most</p>
<p>commercial products is far, far,</p>
<p>far greater than what we would make endogenously.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really supra physiological.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s of concern because melatonin is not just</p>
<p>responsible for making us sleepy and fall asleep.</p>
<p>It also does things like interacts with other hormone</p>
<p>systems, testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>even in the puberty system and kids.</p>
<p>Is taking melatonin every once in a while,</p>
<p>a problem for adjusting to jet lag, et cetera, probably not.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even say no,</p>
<p>but taking it chronically over time,</p>
<p>especially kids taking it chronically over time can</p>
<p>potentially be problematic.</p>
<p>So at least in my opinion,</p>
<p>these other supplements are going to be preferable to,</p>
<p>to melatonin.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>there are some other things that I certainly take every once</p>
<p>in a while and that other people might consider taking in</p>
<p>addition to the sleep stack I talked about before,</p>
<p>or in place of that sleep stack,</p>
<p>if that sleep stack doesn&rsquo;t work well for them.</p>
<p>So every third or fourth night,</p>
<p>I will take two grams of glycine and a hundred milligrams of</p>
<p>GABA in addition to the standard sleep stack that I talked</p>
<p>about before.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m taking mag three and eight apogenin and theanine.</p>
<p>And then I will also take two grams of glycine and GABA,</p>
<p>which I find greatly enhances my ability to get into sleep.</p>
<p>But the reason I only add glycine and GABA every third or</p>
<p>fourth night is that if I take it too often,</p>
<p>I find that the entire sleep stack doesn&rsquo;t work quite as</p>
<p>effectively. I don&rsquo;t know exactly why this is the case,</p>
<p>but in any event, that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>And more recently I&rsquo;ve also started using inositol in</p>
<p>particular myoinositol every other night,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take 900 milligrams of myoinositol in addition to mag</p>
<p>three and eight apogenin and theanine and not on the nights</p>
<p>when I take glycine and GABA.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m adding 900 milligrams of inositol to the standard</p>
<p>sleep stack of mag three and eight theanine and apogenin.</p>
<p>And what I find is not only does it greatly enhance my</p>
<p>ability to fall asleep quickly,</p>
<p>but if I wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>which I often do to use the bathroom,</p>
<p>I find it very, very easy to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>Whereas when I don&rsquo;t take inositol every other night or so,</p>
<p>I find that if I wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit more of a challenge to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>So inositol has a number of different uses that have been</p>
<p>discussed in terms of mental health and in terms of</p>
<p>adjusting anxiety for its daytime use.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is taking 900 milligrams of myoinositol</p>
<p>also 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,</p>
<p>along with the standard sleep stack.</p>
<p>And I found that to be immensely beneficial.</p>
<p>I also noticed that it has a pretty long tail of anxiety</p>
<p>suppression throughout the day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not somebody who suffers from anxiety,</p>
<p>but I have to say it just has led me to feel a bit calmer</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t really know how to say this,</p>
<p>except in subjective terms to feel a bit more buffered</p>
<p>against or resilience against stress events.</p>
<p>And if you look at the literature on inositol and its</p>
<p>interactions with the serotonin system and other systems,</p>
<p>that all makes sense as to why that would be the case.</p>
<p>So we will provide links to our so-called sleep kit,</p>
<p>which is part of our neural network newsletter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a zero cost newsletter where you can access this</p>
<p>information about supplements and other behavioral tools for</p>
<p>sleep in list form.</p>
<p>But that sleep kit doesn&rsquo;t include some of the newer</p>
<p>information that I&rsquo;ve provided this episode,</p>
<p>in particular, the information about inositol</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m finding to be the very beneficial use of</p>
<p>inositol for the ability to fall back asleep after waking up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>which is something that a lot of people struggle with.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s supplementation for falling and staying asleep,</p>
<p>but we can return to the behavioral tools also as powerful</p>
<p>levers and tools for falling asleep and getting back to</p>
<p>sleep. And again, we look to NSDR,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest or the Reverie app as a way to do that.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the Reverie app has been developed on the basis of really</p>
<p>high quality peer reviewed research,</p>
<p>both clinical and non-clinical by my colleague,</p>
<p>David Spiegel,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful tool.</p>
<p>It does carry a cost after the initial seven day trial.</p>
<p>I can tell you what the,</p>
<p>what the cost on that is so you can get a sense because I do</p>
<p>realize that anything that carries a cost for some people,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be accessible right now Reverie.</p>
<p>And I should just mention they didn&rsquo;t pay us for an ad read.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling you what they told me so that I can</p>
<p>accurately report what, what it costs to use Reverie.</p>
<p>They have a monthly subscription to use the Reverie app at</p>
<ol start="1499">
<li>You do get the seven day free trial.</li>
</ol>
<p>They have a yearly subscription of 99,</p>
<p>99, 99 with a seven day free trial.</p>
<p>And they have a lifetime purchase,</p>
<p>one-time purchase of 249 with no trial.</p>
<p>It right now is only available for Apple, not for Android,</p>
<p>but they are yes.</p>
<p>Going to have it available for Android soon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a signup list there.</p>
<p>I should mention that while the cost might seem high,</p>
<p>if you compare that cost to say supplements,</p>
<p>or you compare that cost to a poor night&rsquo;s sleep over time,</p>
<p>the cost to at least to me seems somewhat modest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly within range for a number of people,</p>
<p>but I acknowledge not within range for other people,</p>
<p>which is why I also want to point to zero cost tools.</p>
<p>And the zero cost tool for getting asleep,</p>
<p>staying asleep and falling back asleep is going to be NSDR.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put a link to a non-sleep deep rest protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s available on YouTube.</p>
<p>So available to anybody, zero cost,</p>
<p>provided you have a internet connection.</p>
<p>Again, dim the screen,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to turn that on late at night.</p>
<p>And there are a number of other yoga nidra scripts and apps</p>
<p>and sources around the internet in particular on YouTube</p>
<p>that are zero costs that you could use</p>
<p>if the Reverie app is outside your price range</p>
<p>or is not preferable to you, et cetera.</p>
<p>When I wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually to use the restroom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go use the restroom.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll keep the lights as dim as possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get back into bed.</p>
<p>And if I find that it&rsquo;s easy to fall asleep, great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asleep.</p>
<p>And if not, then I will generally plug in the Reverie app.</p>
<p>They have a fall back asleep hypnosis</p>
<p>and 99 times out of a hundred,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back asleep within minutes</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wake up until morning.</p>
<p>Now, very briefly, I just want to touch on some tools</p>
<p>that are very commonly used by many people out there.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>there is peer reviewed science on things like eye masks.</p>
<p>Do eye masks improve your ability to stay asleep?</p>
<p>And indeed they do, provided they are not too tight</p>
<p>and provided that the room is cool enough.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, eye masks cover the upper half of your face,</p>
<p>which is where glabrous skin is localized.</p>
<p>Remember palms of the hands, bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>glabrous skin on the face.</p>
<p>So a lot of people who wear eye masks will wake up</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re too warm if the room is too warm.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to use an eye mask to keep light out,</p>
<p>definitely make sure the room and your sleeping environment</p>
<p>and your bed are cool enough</p>
<p>in order for you to stay asleep.</p>
<p>In addition, I get a lot of questions</p>
<p>about earplugs.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal with earplugs.</p>
<p>Some people find that earplugs are very beneficial</p>
<p>because of course they prevent the entrance of sound</p>
<p>into the ear that could wake us up.</p>
<p>But some people find that the sound of their own beating</p>
<p>of their own heart can be disruptive.</p>
<p>And they get a sort of humming in their head</p>
<p>when they have those earplugs in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one such person, although I have family members</p>
<p>that like using earplugs when they sleep.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really up to you.</p>
<p>You have to see whether or not those earplugs</p>
<p>help or disrupt your sleep.</p>
<p>For me, they&rsquo;re no good.</p>
<p>For some people, they really enjoy them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use an eye mask</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m sleeping in a really bright environment</p>
<p>or I need to sleep on a plane and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Other tools that I&rsquo;ll just mention</p>
<p>that have peer-reviewed research to support them,</p>
<p>elevating your feet either with a pillow</p>
<p>or by elevating the end of your bed</p>
<p>by about three to five degrees</p>
<p>can be really beneficial for increasing the depth of sleep</p>
<p>because of the so-called glymphatic washout.</p>
<p>This is the movement of and circulation of fluids</p>
<p>in your brain at night that lead to more wakefulness</p>
<p>and actually can improve cognitive function</p>
<p>and a number of other things related to brain health.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one caveat to that</p>
<p>for people that suffer from acid reflux,</p>
<p>having your ankles elevated above your chest</p>
<p>or above your heart in the middle of the night</p>
<p>can actually exacerbate that acid reflux.</p>
<p>You want to do the opposite.</p>
<p>You want to actually elevate the head side of your bed</p>
<p>by about three to five degrees.</p>
<p>Now, one of the common causes of sleep disruption</p>
<p>that has tremendously detrimental effects</p>
<p>is so-called sleep apnea.</p>
<p>So this is basically bouts of suffocation</p>
<p>or lack of oxygenation during sleep.</p>
<p>This is particularly the case</p>
<p>for people that are very heavyset</p>
<p>and that heavyset could be from obesity.</p>
<p>It could also be heavyset from having too much muscle.</p>
<p>A lot of people who are carrying too much muscle</p>
<p>will actually have sleep apnea without realizing it.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea is actually very dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with a number of cardiovascular issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with issues with cognition.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea is bad.</p>
<p>A lot of people will have to use the PAP,</p>
<p>which is a, it&rsquo;s a device.</p>
<p>It looks like a sort of like a snorkel mask or dive mask.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole apparatus that people go to sleep with.</p>
<p>However, many people can relieve themselves of sleep apnea</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not too serious and can sleep much better.</p>
<p>In fact, I think all people can sleep much better</p>
<p>if they train themselves to be nose breathers</p>
<p>while they sleep.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to be a nose breather</p>
<p>unless you are breathing very hard due to exercise</p>
<p>or talking or eating.</p>
<p>That was all covered in James Nestor&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>Breath, The New Science of a Lost Art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been covered in a number of different podcasts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about it on this podcast as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to be a nose breather</p>
<p>unless you need to mouth breathe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a superb idea to be a nose breather in sleep.</p>
<p>And one way to really get good at that</p>
<p>is to take a little bit of medical tape</p>
<p>and to tape your mouth shut before going to sleep.</p>
<p>You heard me right.</p>
<p>Put some medical tape over your mouth</p>
<p>and force yourself to nose breathe during sleep.</p>
<p>It also prevents snoring in most cases,</p>
<p>really offset sleep apnea.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea, again, being a very serious health concern.</p>
<p>I should also mention as a tool</p>
<p>that if you have a hard time being a nose breather in sleep,</p>
<p>you can try doing your cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>at least the lower intensity cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>through purely nasal breathing.</p>
<p>And one way to do that, again, is to tape your mouth shut</p>
<p>or put a gulp of water in your mouth,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t actually swallow that mouthful of water</p>
<p>or to use a mouthpiece or just deliberately</p>
<p>keep your mouth closed</p>
<p>and insist on breathing through your nose.</p>
<p>Most people find that</p>
<p>when they start doing cardiovascular exercise that way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really challenging at first,</p>
<p>but over time they actually can feel quite calm</p>
<p>and still can generate a lot of physical effort</p>
<p>purely using nose breathing.</p>
<p>The reason that doing nose breathing</p>
<p>during cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>translates to being a nose breather during sleep</p>
<p>is that your sinuses actually can dilate their plastic</p>
<p>and over time, plastic meaning they&rsquo;re malleable, that is,</p>
<p>and they can become wider.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get giant nostrils.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Your airways within your skull,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the sinuses really are,</p>
<p>these little passages within the skull.</p>
<p>And of course, within the nasal passages will dilate</p>
<p>and will allow you to breathe more easily through your nose.</p>
<p>But for those of you that are waking up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night, breathing on your back,</p>
<p>or your partner is telling you that,</p>
<p>or other people are telling you that,</p>
<p>or that person on the plane with your mouth hanging open</p>
<p>and drooling and your mouth breathing.</p>
<p>Terrible, terrible, terrible for health reasons</p>
<p>and other reasons.</p>
<p>Put some medical take over your mouth.</p>
<p>Learn to be a nose breather during sleep.</p>
<p>Your sleep will improve</p>
<p>and your daytime feelings of wakefulness</p>
<p>and focus will improve.</p>
<p>Your cardiovascular health will improve</p>
<p>and on and on and on.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve largely covered the tools</p>
<p>that one could use to get and stay asleep.</p>
<p>And we talked about exercise.</p>
<p>We talked about temperature.</p>
<p>We talked about supplements.</p>
<p>And we talked about, of course,</p>
<p>keeping the sleeping environment both cool</p>
<p>and as dark as possible.</p>
<p>I do want to mention a couple of broad contour tools</p>
<p>that will impact your ability to sleep really well</p>
<p>on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>And the one that impacts the most number of people</p>
<p>is weekends.</p>
<p>Turns out that most everybody feels the impulse</p>
<p>to sleep in on the weekend,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;ve been out late the night before.</p>
<p>However, the data show</p>
<p>that keeping relatively consistent sleep and wake times</p>
<p>is really going to enhance the quality</p>
<p>and depth of your sleep.</p>
<p>So if you stay out late one night,</p>
<p>sure, you might allow yourself to sleep in</p>
<p>an extra hour or so,</p>
<p>but you should really try to avoid sleeping in longer</p>
<p>than an hour beyond your normal wake up time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If you normally get eight hours of sleep</p>
<p>and you wake up at 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>probably okay to wake up at 8 a.m. on the weekend</p>
<p>or after a night out the night before,</p>
<p>but try not to sleep until 11 or noon</p>
<p>thinking that you&rsquo;re going to catch up on your sleep</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s better than waking up at a consistent time.</p>
<p>It would be better to wake up at a consistent time</p>
<p>plus or minus an hour and get a nap in the afternoon</p>
<p>provided that nap, again, isn&rsquo;t too long.</p>
<p>And the other tool that relates to nights</p>
<p>that you stayed out too late</p>
<p>or that you feel like you want to sleep in a bit more</p>
<p>in the morning is if you are going to wake up</p>
<p>at your consistent time.</p>
<p>So for example, normally you go to bed at 10</p>
<p>and you wake up at six.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s your schedule</p>
<p>and you end up staying up late one night</p>
<p>until midnight or one for whatever reason.</p>
<p>And the next morning you wake up at seven</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still groggy.</p>
<p>In that case, you absolutely want to wait</p>
<p>to ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>You really do because there are good data</p>
<p>to support the fact that caffeine can disrupt sleep.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>Caffeine especially disrupts sleep</p>
<p>if you take it too late in the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very obvious as to why that would be the case.</p>
<p>But caffeine especially disrupts</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called compensatory sleep.</p>
<p>So if you start changing your waking time</p>
<p>and your to sleep time,</p>
<p>and you start using additional caffeine</p>
<p>to offset the sleepiness that you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>because of those late nights out,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s when you really start to disrupt</p>
<p>not just your nighttime sleep</p>
<p>but your daytime compensatory sleep.</p>
<p>So those naps, you also are disrupting</p>
<p>the total architecture of sleep in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of great science that&rsquo;s been put to this</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s emerged from this, I should say.</p>
<p>So try and keep those sleep-wake times relatively constant</p>
<p>plus or minus an hour.</p>
<p>And try as much as you can to delay that caffeine intake</p>
<p>90 to 120 minutes after waking every day,</p>
<p>but especially on days where you wake up</p>
<p>and you feel you haven&rsquo;t gotten enough sleep.</p>
<p>In that case, I highly recommend you just use NSDR</p>
<p>or the Reverie app or some other form of deep relaxation</p>
<p>to try and compensate for the lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Knowing of course,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no complete compensation for lack of sleep.</p>
<p>There are just things that we can do</p>
<p>to partially offset lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Now, a couple of final points</p>
<p>and additional tools that I think are going to be useful</p>
<p>to everybody, in particular, people who have young children</p>
<p>or following a shift work schedule</p>
<p>or who are experiencing jet lag.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, jet lag can be due to travel,</p>
<p>which is obvious, but jet lag can also be due</p>
<p>to getting woken up in the middle of the night, right?</p>
<p>Your body doesn&rsquo;t know the difference</p>
<p>between flying to a new time zone</p>
<p>and getting woken up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The tool that I&rsquo;d like to offer you is an understanding</p>
<p>of something called temperature minimum.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to make this as simple as possible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m confident that everyone can understand this,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have any science background.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the question you need to ask yourself.</p>
<p>What is your typical wake-up time?</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s your typical wake-up time?</p>
<p>If for you, your typical wake-up time is 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>plus or minus half an hour.</p>
<p>So, and that could be 7 a.m. because you set an alarm clock</p>
<p>or it could be 7 a.m. because you naturally wake up</p>
<p>at 7 a.m., doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If your typical wake-up time most days is 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>well, then your temperature minimum is 5 a.m.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, your temperature minimum is not a temperature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a time within your 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>Approximately two hours before your typical wake-up time,</p>
<p>your body is at its lowest temperature</p>
<p>that it will ever be in the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>If you view bright light, exercise, or drink caffeine,</p>
<p>or all of the above in the two to four hours</p>
<p>before your temperature minimum, that will delay your clock.</p>
<p>What that means when I say delay your clock</p>
<p>is it will make you want to go to sleep later</p>
<p>and wake up later the next night.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s run this exercise for you,</p>
<p>the person waking up at 7 a.m. on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I can predict with almost certainty that your body</p>
<p>is going to be at its lowest temperature at 5 a.m.</p>
<p>So what that means is that if you get up at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>or at 4 a.m. and you flip on bright lights in your house</p>
<p>or in your bathroom, or you have a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>or you do any kind of exercise,</p>
<p>or you get up and head to the airport,</p>
<p>the mechanisms in your brain and body that control timing</p>
<p>of sleep and timing of waking will shift, they will delay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if you put your clock on hold for a little while</p>
<p>and then let it start again.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s the simplest way I can describe it.</p>
<p>And you will tend to want to go to sleep later</p>
<p>and wake up later the following night.</p>
<p>Now, the opposite is true if you view bright light,</p>
<p>drink caffeine, or exercise, or socialize, I should say,</p>
<p>in the hours immediately after your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>So for you, in this example,</p>
<p>the person who&rsquo;s waking up at 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>your temperature minimum is 5 a.m.</p>
<p>If you view bright light, exercise, maybe have a snack,</p>
<p>maybe not, or socialize, move about at 5.30 or 6 a.m.</p>
<p>or 7 a.m., that will tend to phase advance your clock.</p>
<p>It will tend to basically make you want to go to bed earlier</p>
<p>and wake up earlier the following night.</p>
<p>Now, I use this example of a person who wakes up</p>
<p>typically at 7 a.m., whose temperature minimum is 5 a.m.,</p>
<p>but of course you need to adjust that for yourself</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who wakes up at 9 a.m.</p>
<p>or at 5 a.m., et cetera.</p>
<p>Why do I offer this as a tool?</p>
<p>Well, this is an immensely powerful tool if, for instance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re headed to a time zone</p>
<p>where you need to go to bed earlier</p>
<p>and wake up earlier once you arrive in that time zone.</p>
<p>What it means is in the day or two before you leave,</p>
<p>you can force yourself to exercise, drink caffeine,</p>
<p>maybe even to eat a meal early in the morning,</p>
<p>or maybe you still fast early in the morning,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really up to you,</p>
<p>but you force yourself to do the activities</p>
<p>that are going to phase advance your clock.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re traveling to a time zone</p>
<p>where you are going to need to go to sleep much later</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to need to wake up much later,</p>
<p>or even a little bit later,</p>
<p>you can do those things in the hours</p>
<p>prior to your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that work shift work,</p>
<p>this can be especially useful,</p>
<p>but I want to say a couple of things about shift work.</p>
<p>There are a lot of details about shift work and jet lag</p>
<p>in an episode that I did specifically</p>
<p>about jet lag and shift work,</p>
<p>so for the deep dive, go there,</p>
<p>but suffice to say this for now.</p>
<p>If you are going to do shift work,</p>
<p>try to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very detrimental to brain and body.</p>
<p>It can even be horrifically challenging</p>
<p>for your brain and body in a number of ways.</p>
<p>If you are switching on the so-called swing shift,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re working three days, the night shift,</p>
<p>three days, the day shift, three days, the night shift,</p>
<p>three days, try and stay on the same schedule</p>
<p>as much as possible.</p>
<p>And I should say for everybody,</p>
<p>people who are jet lagged and engaged in shift work or not,</p>
<p>but just for everybody,</p>
<p>if you need to be awake in the middle of your sleep cycle,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just a quick departure to the bathroom</p>
<p>and back to bed, but you really need to be awake,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re feeding a baby</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re taking care of a loved one</p>
<p>or you need to do something that&rsquo;s critical</p>
<p>or you need to work, if possible, use red light, okay?</p>
<p>Now for shift workers who really are trying</p>
<p>to stay awake all night and sleep all day,</p>
<p>this is not going to be ideal.</p>
<p>But for people that, for instance,</p>
<p>need to stay up really late one night</p>
<p>or wake up especially early,</p>
<p>like 3 a.m. to prepare for an exam</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just not ready for</p>
<p>or to head to the airport, et cetera.</p>
<p>Using red light has been shown to allow people</p>
<p>to be awake enough and obviously see what they need to see</p>
<p>in order to perform their activity safely.</p>
<p>But it does not seem to disrupt the cortisol rhythm</p>
<p>that is the healthy, normal cortisol rhythm.</p>
<p>I realize this is kind of an advanced tool</p>
<p>and many people won&rsquo;t have access to this.</p>
<p>There are a number of different sources for red lights now.</p>
<p>Companies like Juve or Cozy Light,</p>
<p>these are different brands.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any affiliation to any of these brands,</p>
<p>I should say.</p>
<p>There are a number of different red light bulb sources</p>
<p>out there and commercial sources</p>
<p>that you can explore if you want.</p>
<p>But understanding this temperature minimum</p>
<p>is really powerful because it allows you</p>
<p>to adjust your schedule depending on travel,</p>
<p>depending on changing work schedules or school schedules.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not a morning person,</p>
<p>you can use the tools related to temperature minimum</p>
<p>to really become a morning person over time.</p>
<p>And it actually is pretty easy.</p>
<p>And I talked about this in a previous episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just mention that there have been shown</p>
<p>to be important positive effects on cognition,</p>
<p>on even grip strength and physical performance</p>
<p>for people that are early morning risers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s especially true for night owls</p>
<p>that deliberately shift themselves to become early risers.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s a lot of information and a lot of tools.</p>
<p>And I suppose the one set of tools</p>
<p>that I really didn&rsquo;t drill into too deeply,</p>
<p>the ones related to jet lag and shift work.</p>
<p>And again, please check out the episode</p>
<p>on jet lag and shift work if that&rsquo;s relevant to you.</p>
<p>But I think for most people who are going to sleep at night</p>
<p>and are trying their best to sleep well at night</p>
<p>and are trying their best to wake up in the morning</p>
<p>at whatever hour and stay alert and focused</p>
<p>throughout the day, maybe with a brief nap,</p>
<p>the tools that I talked about today related</p>
<p>to light temperature, food, exercise, caffeine,</p>
<p>supplements, and digital tools,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping will prove to be very useful for you.</p>
<p>They certainly are all supported</p>
<p>by excellent peer-reviewed research.</p>
<p>And I should just emphasize again</p>
<p>that most of the tools we talked about</p>
<p>are completely zero cost.</p>
<p>So while the supplements and some of the digital tools</p>
<p>do carry some costs to them,</p>
<p>I really want to encourage everybody</p>
<p>to get your behaviors right.</p>
<p>Get all of the things related to your timing of exercise</p>
<p>and type of exercise in the best possible order</p>
<p>and time of day.</p>
<p>We talked about this critical period early in the day</p>
<p>and then another critical period in the middle of the day</p>
<p>and the late afternoon,</p>
<p>and then this third critical period</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Different tools for the different three critical periods.</p>
<p>I promise that if you start to implement some</p>
<p>or ideally all of these tools,</p>
<p>the quality of your sleep will increase tremendously.</p>
<p>And of course, in doing so,</p>
<p>the quality of your daytime alertness</p>
<p>and your ability to focus will improve tremendously.</p>
<p>Again, sleep is the absolute foundation</p>
<p>of your mental health, your physical health,</p>
<p>and your performance in all endeavors.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s one area of your life to really focus on</p>
<p>and try and optimize,</p>
<p>if your goal is to be happier and more productive</p>
<p>and just to have a better life overall,</p>
<p>I can confidently say that sleep</p>
<p>is really the thing to optimize.</p>

<p>During today&rsquo;s podcast and on many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast, we talked about supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like sleep and focus</p>
<p>and hormone support and so forth.</p>
<p>For reasons mentioned at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see many of the supplements described on today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and other episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Again, all as single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>They ship internationally.</p>
<p>Their quality is exceedingly high.</p>
<p>And by largely focusing on single ingredient</p>
<p>and various dosages of different supplements,</p>
<p>you can create the optimized supplement protocol for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following us on social media,</p>
<p>we are Huberman Lab on Instagram</p>
<p>and also Huberman Lab on Twitter.</p>
<p>There I cover science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlaps with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast, and other of which,</p>
<p>I should say much of which is distinct</p>

<p>So thank you for joining me today</p>

<p>but your daytime feelings of alertness and focus</p>
<p>and your overall health.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
