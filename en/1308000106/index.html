    <p>J. Cal, what&rsquo;s it feel like to be a guest on your own podcast</p>
<p>today? I&rsquo;m excited. Oh, god. So delightful. You did a great job</p>
<p>by the way. Really like the punch up to the formatting where</p>
<p>you actually put the questions in. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s cuz I</p>
<p>want us to all agree on the stuff we wanna grok on, you</p>
<p>know? In a professional TV show, they would have pre-interviews</p>
<p>with everybody, get all their positions, then they put the</p>
<p>positions into the document and they, you know, they basically</p>
<p>do what&rsquo;s called a pre-interview. Or here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another idea. You could do your job. Well, I mean, do your job.</p>
<p>How about that? How about you try that? Yeah. Or, you know,</p>
<p>or how about I turned you three miserable **** into actual</p>
<p>likable people in 91 episodes which nobody thought was</p>
<p>possible. I actually think I&rsquo;m becoming less likable the</p>
<p>longer I&rsquo;m on this **** show. I think that correlates with all</p>
<p>of us. All of our likability is just</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride. Rain Man, David Satterthwaite.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>gone crazy with it. Love you guys. Queen of Kinwan. Hello</p>
<p>and welcome to the All In Pod. I am your moderator for today</p>
<p>out of the hot seat doing the easy beat, Dave Friedberg. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>joined today by our esteemed panel. Back from his European</p>
<p>shopping spree, our national treasure, America&rsquo;s favorite</p>
<p>dictator, Chamath Paliapatiya. Chamath, how are you feeling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling great. Jet lagged. You&rsquo;re okay. You&rsquo;re recovered.</p>
<p>Yeah. I&rsquo;m a little, I&rsquo;ve got, I got a little head cold though.</p>
<p>Oh, well, sorry to hear that. Hope it&rsquo;s not COVID 2.0. No, I</p>
<p>tested. I&rsquo;m COVID negative. Thank god. Okay. Also with us</p>
<p>as usual from his emergency bunker ahead of the US Civil</p>
<p>War, the Rain Man, David Sachs. How are you, David? Good. Happy</p>
<p>with the late start this morning, I&rsquo;m sure. And of</p>
<p>course, everyone&rsquo;s favorite ski bum, producer of the Woodstock</p>
<p>of Tech Conferences, the one and done All In Summit in Miami,</p>
<p>Jason Calacanis. Jason, what&rsquo;s it like to be a guestie today?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s so delightful. When you said you wanted to moderate</p>
<p>that to me was chef&rsquo;s kiss. I get to, I get to comment and not</p>
<p>be the moderator. I love it. Yeah, so we&rsquo;re mixing it up a</p>
<p>little bit today. I&rsquo;m going to take the lead. J Cal is going to</p>
<p>sit back. I&rsquo;ll say a couple of words before we start because I</p>
<p>think last week we got a little nasty. Definitely heard that</p>
<p>from listeners. You know, and so I want to kind of just address</p>
<p>it real quick. And then we can kick off the show. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to say that none of us really started out doing this</p>
<p>pod as a job or thinking that it would become a real regular</p>
<p>thing, right? We started doing it for fun, ad hoc from time to</p>
<p>time. And then it became this thing that people listen to. And</p>
<p>it became this thing that we started doing every week and</p>
<p>people actually cared about it and suddenly became this real</p>
<p>obligation. It&rsquo;s almost like we got pregnant and had a baby and</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like four men and a baby. And so, you know, I think</p>
<p>we all feel this like, you know, challenging obligation that</p>
<p>we never expected to take on. It&rsquo;s like taking care of the</p>
<p>show, taking care of the pod. And we all have like different</p>
<p>points of view on what we want the pod to be and what we want</p>
<p>it to become. J Cal cares about, you know, getting up in the</p>
<p>rankings and listening to the audience and ultimately has</p>
<p>shared that he wants to monetize, you know, at points.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve not always agreed on different points about that.</p>
<p>You know, Tamath has the things he wants to bring to the table.</p>
<p>Zach says things he wants to talk about. And so, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really difficult kind of running the pod, managing the</p>
<p>pod with four very different points of view, very different</p>
<p>perspectives on what it is we all want to kind of get out of</p>
<p>this over time. And I think it causes us to get really</p>
<p>frustrated with each other. We end up having real fights. You</p>
<p>know, you have the biggest fights with your best friends.</p>
<p>You know, you really let loose and lash out. I think last week</p>
<p>I listened back, I was pretty contemptuous in my kind of</p>
<p>retort to J Cal about hitting up on the inflation topic. And I</p>
<p>want to apologize to J Cal for doing that. I think it was, you</p>
<p>know, I think, yeah, I think it was a little rough. But at the</p>
<p>same time, I just want to point out like, you know, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to keep doing the show. Because I think, you know, as much as we</p>
<p>all disagree, as much as we fight, and as much as we may</p>
<p>even start to dislike each other, and not get along, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s really important that we keep doing this. And I</p>
<p>think restating that commitment and trying to do better is</p>
<p>really important. So you know, we&rsquo;re going to try different</p>
<p>stuff out, try and find ways to find common ground and keep</p>
<p>doing the show productively with each other. As one experiment</p>
<p>this week, I&rsquo;m going to moderate and we&rsquo;re going to, you know,</p>
<p>try and take it that way. But you know, I just wanted to say</p>
<p>those few words before we kick this off, guys, because I thought</p>
<p>it was important, especially after the last couple of weeks,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s been a bit of a struggle. We&rsquo;ve been having a</p>
<p>tough time. And I just want to be open about it. And you know,</p>
<p>highlight that, you know, as an example, you can fight with</p>
<p>people, you can disagree with them, and you can still keep</p>
<p>trying. And I want to set that example. I want us to keep doing</p>
<p>that. So anyway, just I would just like to say, apology</p>
<p>accepted. And I thought that was a lovely opening. One thing I</p>
<p>would just punch up there is, the real reason we did this was</p>
<p>because we missed each other, we missed hanging out with each</p>
<p>other. And then this is, you know, something that&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>more successful than any of us ever imagined. It&rsquo;s got an</p>
<p>audience size that is just, you know, hard to imagine how many</p>
<p>people are listening to this, which then does put a little bit</p>
<p>of pressure on it, we want it to be great for the audience. And</p>
<p>I just want to say, like, I don&rsquo;t take it personally, when</p>
<p>we when we battle on stuff, even with politics and sacks and</p>
<p>stuff like that. I respect each of you, you are each brothers to</p>
<p>me, I love each of you deeply. And when we fight and things</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work out, I look at it as like personal growth or</p>
<p>progress towards some other goals that we each have. The</p>
<p>amount of support I&rsquo;ve gotten in my career, from David Sacks</p>
<p>and Chamath has been unparalleled. David Sacks was my</p>
<p>first LP, he encouraged me to create my first venture fund.</p>
<p>Chamath supported supported me relentlessly in my career, showed</p>
<p>up for me every event I ever did. And I tried to do those</p>
<p>same things for them. You and I haven&rsquo;t done much business</p>
<p>together, Friberg, but I&rsquo;m enjoying the business that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>started. Yeah, starting to and I showed up for both of your</p>
<p>events when you needed me. Yeah, doing some syndicates with</p>
<p>you. And I love doing this each week. I love doing this each</p>
<p>week. Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, like, I think my point was, it&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>easier to be friends and have wine together and play poker</p>
<p>together than it is to do a job together. And this has become</p>
<p>really a job. And so you know, you can have really good</p>
<p>friends. And then you try and start a company together or do a</p>
<p>job together and you can hate each other. I think it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean that you guys stopped being friends or that we should stop</p>
<p>doing the work. I think we should still keep trying to do</p>
<p>the work, figure out a way to make it work. So anyway, that</p>
<p>was the point I wanted to make. And that&rsquo;s the end of my my</p>
<p>statements. Okay. Those weren&rsquo;t prepared. Those are just a</p>
<p>reaction to yours. I don&rsquo;t know if I say anything, but I doubt</p>
<p>it. Okay, let&rsquo;s have any emotions right now. Zack, what</p>
<p>are you feeling? Yeah, I mean, Chamath, do you think grass fed</p>
<p>is better or the regular?</p>
<p>Saxon, I were texting while you guys were, we&rsquo;re hugging it out</p>
<p>talking about different kinds of jerky.</p>
<p>While we were jerking each other off, you guys were</p>
<p>researching jerky. Great. Okay. I was recommending built on to</p>
<p>him. Oh, great. Awesome. Speaking of jerky, let&rsquo;s get</p>
<p>into Adam Newman. Oh, okay. So now Hey, okay. So first thing to</p>
<p>talk about today, and I kind of wanted to take it in a little</p>
<p>bit of a different direction that I think all the other tech</p>
<p>media have kind of addressed this, you know, Adam Newman is</p>
<p>back, he raised $350 million from Andreessen Horowitz, there</p>
<p>was announcement this week for his new company called flow,</p>
<p>which as we understand it, is trying to develop residential</p>
<p>apartments, you know, in the same sort of vibe, quality, and</p>
<p>attention to experience as maybe was intended with we work. And</p>
<p>flow, you know, seems to have started originated with Adam</p>
<p>doing a bunch of acquisitions of real estate with his own</p>
<p>capital. And now he seems to have turned this into a real</p>
<p>business and raise money from Andreessen. So there&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>commentary and joking about Andreessen putting this money in</p>
<p>Are they crazy, as well as all the, you know, commentary about</p>
<p>Adam Newman, how could anyone back him, the guy was so awful</p>
<p>the first time around, let me just do a quick round the horn</p>
<p>with you guys, you know, initial reactions to the to the</p>
<p>Adam Newman deal. And then I&rsquo;d love to talk about founders</p>
<p>having a second act. Because, you know, Adam happens to be</p>
<p>high profile. So his failure was high profile, but a lot of</p>
<p>founders have a failed, low profile first experience and</p>
<p>come back and kick ass the second time around. And</p>
<p>investors have taken notice of that. And so I&rsquo;d love to go</p>
<p>there. But maybe we just do a quick reaction. J. Cal, I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about this on your other show, maybe you can kind</p>
<p>of give us your quick commentary on on the opportunity</p>
<p>of the transaction. And what are people talking about with</p>
<p>respect to this, this deal happening,</p>
<p>you know, people are wondering why he&rsquo;s able to raise money.</p>
<p>And what I always tell founders is when you see these like weird</p>
<p>fundings, and you can&rsquo;t get your heads around them, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>typically has to do with track record and credible audacity,</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s prior blunders. So say what you will about Adam Newman,</p>
<p>he is audacious, and he has credibility, people forget his</p>
<p>origin story, they only remember the Masa Yoshisan $4</p>
<p>billion. And what happened and what he did with that, and that</p>
<p>was a complete clusterfuck. It went off the rails, he did all</p>
<p>kinds of inside dealing. And it was it was madness. But before</p>
<p>that, he did Green Desk, he was a bootstrapped entrepreneur. And</p>
<p>then he created the category defining co working space,</p>
<p>which to this day, when you say I need to get an office, the</p>
<p>first thing people say is get a we were just like they say,</p>
<p>take an Uber, just like they say, Google it, just like, you</p>
<p>know, any other verb that we talk about. And so it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>easy to dismiss him and say, the tech industry has no morals,</p>
<p>they just back they&rsquo;ll back anybody. He has a publicly</p>
<p>traded company that&rsquo;s in the market right now, he defined the</p>
<p>category, and he also put $300 million, apparently of his own</p>
<p>money at stake to buy these apartments. So I think it&rsquo;s, I</p>
<p>would say the bet makes sense to me. And I think it will make</p>
<p>sense if we go into the bet, which I&rsquo;d love to hear everybody</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s thoughts on. It&rsquo;s an audacious bet, because housing</p>
<p>is one of the hardest industries to tackle. And he already did</p>
<p>it for commercial. So why wouldn&rsquo;t he be able to do it for</p>
<p>residential sex? Did you see this opportunity in the market?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t? Did you guys take a look at it? Or have any points of</p>
<p>view on it?</p>
<p>No, I mean, we, we don&rsquo;t write $350 million size check. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just not something that we&rsquo;re going to take a look at. For</p>
<p>that matter, we don&rsquo;t really do non software investments. We</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do, you know, in the physical world type investments.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve kind of learned that doing anything in the physical</p>
<p>world with atoms is 10 times harder than doing anything with</p>
<p>bits. So, you know, one of my takeaways over the last few</p>
<p>years is, you know, we tend to like pure software models, not</p>
<p>even hybrid or tech enabled models, because it really does</p>
<p>take a 10x entrepreneur to do anything in the physical world.</p>
<p>So we, you know, we, software is kind of our knitting, and we</p>
<p>like to stick to that. In terms of, you know, Andreessen</p>
<p>Horowitz, making this investment, here&rsquo;s right, or your</p>
<p>larger topic of repeat founders, look, most startups fail. And</p>
<p>most founders or good founders have an entrepreneurial streak</p>
<p>in them. And so you combine those two things, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a lot of repeat second time founders, people who are</p>
<p>fundamentally entrepreneurial, and their first thing doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work out, I think that that can be a positive thing to invest</p>
<p>in, because they&rsquo;ve gotten some of their mistakes out of the</p>
<p>way. And they&rsquo;ve learned from that experience. So I think the</p>
<p>question we would just ask is, what were the learnings? And</p>
<p>did they conduct their failed startup honorably? You know,</p>
<p>like, if they lie to investors, or misled investors, then</p>
<p>obviously, we don&rsquo;t want any part of that. But I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>most failures are like that. And, and so as long as the</p>
<p>founder, I think conducted themselves, honorably had some</p>
<p>good learnings, it&rsquo;s certainly not a disqualifier for their</p>
<p>next startup. I mean, Chamath, you&rsquo;ve been open in the past</p>
<p>about startups that waste money and do the kind bars and red</p>
<p>brick, you know, offices, and, you know, easy living at the</p>
<p>office. There&rsquo;s no better example of over the top</p>
<p>exuberance as there was at WeWork, right? I mean, does that</p>
<p>indicate to you that this guy doesn&rsquo;t have a clue in terms of</p>
<p>how to be prudent with investors capital, and it&rsquo;s not backable?</p>
<p>Or how do you think about it? I have a couple thoughts. The</p>
<p>first is that WeWork is a really interesting business. But</p>
<p>that business had been built many times before, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the REIT. And I think what Adam was able to</p>
<p>arbitrage was a period of time where he pitched a non real</p>
<p>estate investor, a technology company that was really just a</p>
<p>real estate investment trust. And that&rsquo;s why he was able to</p>
<p>get these incredibly heady valuations. I think the peak</p>
<p>valuation of WeWork was like 45 or $50 billion. But what</p>
<p>happened, which is that when WeWork ultimately went public,</p>
<p>the collective intelligence of the public markets imposed a</p>
<p>REIT based valuation model on WeWork, and it is now a $3.6</p>
<p>billion public company. And I don&rsquo;t think you can dunk on Adam</p>
<p>for that. It&rsquo;s hard to build any kind of company, let alone a</p>
<p>$3.6 billion company. And he was instrumental in that. So he</p>
<p>should get some amount of credit. But the reality was</p>
<p>that he was pitching people that didn&rsquo;t want to hear about a</p>
<p>business that was a real estate investment trust, they wanted to</p>
<p>hear about some technology and all of these other things. But</p>
<p>ultimately, when you stripped it away, it was a REIT. Now you</p>
<p>started again, and from the outside in not knowing anything,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know anything. What it looks like is the</p>
<p>beginnings of another REIT, except focused on residential,</p>
<p>right. So when you buy hundreds or 1000s of apartments, but</p>
<p>again, same pig different lipstick. The issue at hand,</p>
<p>though, is that, again, he has found a technology investor to</p>
<p>buy a technology story. And again, time will tell whether</p>
<p>there is a technology business here. But if it ultimately is an</p>
<p>amalgamation of a bunch of apartments with some sort of,</p>
<p>you know, interconnected technology that helps enable a</p>
<p>better community or what have you, those kinds of REITs have</p>
<p>also been built before and REITs are valued in a very</p>
<p>structured way on this thing called FFO funds from</p>
<p>operations. And you know what the upper bound of valuation is,</p>
<p>which is if you go and you know, look in the stock market, the</p>
<p>most valuable REIT in the world is a company called prologis.</p>
<p>They have about a billion square feet under management,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re about $100 billion company, we work has about 45</p>
<p>million square feet under management, there are $3.6</p>
<p>billion company. So if you just interpolate from those two data</p>
<p>points, on the residential side, Adam&rsquo;s gonna have to buy, you</p>
<p>know, if you think an average apartment is 1500 square feet,</p>
<p>he has to buy, you know, 665,000 more apartments. In order for</p>
<p>that to be prologis scale, you know, I don&rsquo;t know to invest at</p>
<p>a billion dollar valuation, or 1.5, or two, or whatever the</p>
<p>number turns out to be, make sense if you think the upper</p>
<p>bound is unlimited. But if you think the upper bound is three</p>
<p>or 4 billion, the only reason to do it, by the way, it still</p>
<p>makes sense for unreason to do it. And this is why I think</p>
<p>people get tilted. Because now this comes to my second point,</p>
<p>which is that what Adam Newman is able to take advantage of is</p>
<p>a very obvious, powerful understanding of the venture</p>
<p>capital business model that other founders don&rsquo;t, especially</p>
<p>the ones that dunk on him. And let me just explain this. We</p>
<p>talked about this last week, the only mistake I think that</p>
<p>SoftBank really made was a velocity of money mistake, which</p>
<p>is not setting the investment cycle of their vision fund to be</p>
<p>10 years instead of five. Well, every other fund has a five year</p>
<p>investment cycle to including ahs. And so when you have 10s of</p>
<p>billions of dollars under management, guys, guess what,</p>
<p>they have the same problem SoftBank did, except with just a</p>
<p>different quantum of capital. They want velocity of money. And</p>
<p>so if a founder comes and asks for $350 million, it actually in</p>
<p>a perverse way makes your life easier. Because now that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saying yes once versus saying five or six times to people</p>
<p>asking for $50 million, or heaven forbid 350 times for</p>
<p>people asking for a million dollars. And so if you&rsquo;re if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in that seat, come up if you&rsquo;re in the investor seat, are</p>
<p>you putting all that capital once with the one guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>managed that money before? Or do you want to find the guy who</p>
<p>has it or the guy who has it? You have to understand the</p>
<p>Andreessen business model and recent Horowitz business model</p>
<p>is to become Blackstone. But for technology,</p>
<p>you have like 30 billion aum now, right?</p>
<p>Right, which is still, you know, a drop in the bucket and</p>
<p>something like that. So if you if you look at Blackstone, right,</p>
<p>a trillion Blackstone is 100 plus billion dollar market cap</p>
<p>company, right built on three pillars, credit, private equity</p>
<p>and real estate, you can make the argument that technology is</p>
<p>near is as important as those three categories. And so, you</p>
<p>know, if I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Andreessen is</p>
<p>trying to build a publicly ownable security that</p>
<p>represents all things in technology. So again, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that they&rsquo;re necessarily out to generate massive returns</p>
<p>for LPS. They want to become a credible, reliable institution</p>
<p>for to absorb hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And so ultimately, the objective, you think is to</p>
<p>end the monetize their, their ultimate goal is to is for</p>
<p>Andreessen and Horowitz to monetize the equity of Andreessen</p>
<p>Horowitz of the management company. Yeah, that&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a, by the way, that&rsquo;s a laudable goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to build a business. They built an</p>
<p>incredible business, and then they should get credit for that</p>
<p>tax. Do you agree?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, they are they, I think she must write that their</p>
<p>stated goal is to build like a larger institutional VC type</p>
<p>investor. I mean, doesn&rsquo;t Andreessen have a portrait of</p>
<p>JP Morgan hanging on his wall or something? I mean, they want</p>
<p>to turn VC from being like a little craft business is</p>
<p>something larger, more institutional. So yeah, I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>they jump at the chance to write a $350 million check if they</p>
<p>believe in the company. But can I shift this conversation just</p>
<p>for a second. So I&rsquo;ve done a lot of commercial real estate</p>
<p>investing. I think there are reasons to think that flow,</p>
<p>this new company could actually be better than we work. And let</p>
<p>me just explain. So with we work, you know, if you talk to</p>
<p>commercial office space, owners, landlords, about we work like</p>
<p>10 years ago, what they would have told you is, yeah, look,</p>
<p>that model is great. But we want tenants who are high credit</p>
<p>and sign long term leases. Why? Because they&rsquo;re not worried</p>
<p>about what happens in a bull market, they&rsquo;re worried about</p>
<p>what happens in a recession, and they want to make sure they</p>
<p>can cover their bank debt. So landlords have always cared not</p>
<p>just about rents, but also about having high credit long term</p>
<p>leases. What we work basically did is arbitrage that, of</p>
<p>course, it was a much better deal for startups. Because if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a startup, you don&rsquo;t have to go through a complicated</p>
<p>process on a lease, you could just go month to month at a we</p>
<p>work and you&rsquo;d be willing to pay a premium for that. So we</p>
<p>worked business work great during an upmarket because they</p>
<p>would rent space for say 50 bucks a foot, lease it for 100.</p>
<p>And they would capture the spread. The problem is the</p>
<p>business was highly levered to a boom cycle. And at the first</p>
<p>recession or bus cycle, all of a sudden, they&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>massive vacancy because everyone can leave. And all of a sudden</p>
<p>their rents go below their the rents are collecting go below</p>
<p>the rent, they&rsquo;re paying and the arbitrage goes away. They</p>
<p>magnified that problem by making two mistakes. Number one,</p>
<p>they signed a lot of top of market leases, right, they were</p>
<p>signing leases at $100 plus per foot in hot markets. And the</p>
<p>other thing is, they didn&rsquo;t seem to have a lot of financial</p>
<p>discipline. You know, I guess that show kind of makes fun of</p>
<p>these sort of Bacchanalian parties they had, and so forth</p>
<p>like that you can get away with a lack of spending discipline if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a 90% gross margin business like a Google, but when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a real estate business, who&rsquo;s got real cogs, not having</p>
<p>spending discipline is actually a problem. So for all those</p>
<p>reasons, I think we were kind of contained the seeds of its own</p>
<p>implosion inside of their model, and they needed to manage or</p>
<p>mitigate those risks a lot better. That&rsquo;s not to say,</p>
<p>though, that it wasn&rsquo;t a great product. I mean, for every</p>
<p>reason, the early was an amazing product.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, in the early days, so to your point, they were</p>
<p>taking under market, like really low cost per square foot space,</p>
<p>like in the tenderloin, and then selling it for, you know,</p>
<p>Bryant and third street rents, right? I mean, that was the</p>
<p>arbitrage and it worked. It&rsquo;s only they lost that discipline</p>
<p>sounds like in the second half of the company&rsquo;s history, right?</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s interesting about flow is that it&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>multi family, these apartment type buildings, those tend to</p>
<p>be, you know, let&rsquo;s call it one year leases anyway, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>owning them. They&rsquo;re not leasing from a landlord. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically so Chamath&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s basically a standard</p>
<p>apartment replay, where Newman is going to create a consistent</p>
<p>experience and brand across the country. I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really been done before where there&rsquo;s like a brand for</p>
<p>apartment living. It&rsquo;s never been done. Yeah. And so</p>
<p>actually, it&rsquo;s pretty simple in terms of measuring if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to work or not, which is simply can Adam Newman deliver</p>
<p>lower vacancy rates and higher rents, and then you know, buy</p>
<p>apartment buildings at market prices. So in other words,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the arbitrage is can he extract more rent and less</p>
<p>vacancy from apartment units by creating this national brand,</p>
<p>and this experience, but this is what we do with financial</p>
<p>discipline. Yeah, go ahead. This is my point. Everything you</p>
<p>talked about is how we would actually do a teardown of any</p>
<p>other read that was looking for money, David, you know, we would</p>
<p>look at what is the FFO? Ultimately, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the implied cap rate? And what&rsquo;s the FFO? Can you get</p>
<p>paid for owning this? How much do you have to spend? And can</p>
<p>you get paid? And this is where this is where I think like, you</p>
<p>know, trying to then, you know, so if, if, if on the if on the</p>
<p>inside of it, what what instead, it was not that, but it was</p>
<p>pitched as some, you know, convoluted technology play, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little bit harder to believe. Again, we don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>details. So maybe this play. Sure. Actually, what I would say</p>
<p>building on sacks and schmutz, if they are going to do 700,000</p>
<p>apartments, you can actually put some numbers on this, you know,</p>
<p>700,000 apartments, you think they can get extra 100, maybe</p>
<p>150 bucks out of a renter, I think they could for like that</p>
<p>experience, right, people pay a little bit, they&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>pay 300 more 400 more, because then they would just get a</p>
<p>larger apartment. And you know, they could spend that money</p>
<p>because it would be better spent. They have 700,000 of</p>
<p>those, you&rsquo;re talking about a billion dollars in revenue a</p>
<p>year, that&rsquo;s what 700,000 apartments, okay, 10 times</p>
<p>profits, you know, whatever $10 billion valuation, if</p>
<p>interest in hearts is buying in at 1.5, or two, like Jamal</p>
<p>saying is probably correct, somewhere in that range, they</p>
<p>bought 20%. Okay, yeah, maybe they get a six or seven bagger</p>
<p>out of this, but it&rsquo;s a six or seven bagger on a big number</p>
<ol start="350">
<li>It&rsquo;s not like a 20 x or a 50 x. And you also get the</li>
</ol>
<p>branding, which I would not under value here of being the</p>
<p>firm that backs bad boy, entrepreneurs, and is like</p>
<p>willing to go there and support. I think it&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>positive for Andreessen. It&rsquo;s like, look, yeah, I do. You</p>
<p>know, you just raised a ton of money. Well, guess what, you</p>
<p>got to put that money out, because it&rsquo;s not as if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to think to themselves, oh, I really only want to run</p>
<p>this fund over three years instead of two. They&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking that they&rsquo;re like, I want to keep going out because</p>
<p>I think their business model works by taking as much oxygen</p>
<p>in the room as possible, which means to be actively</p>
<p>fundraising. Always. That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s tied. It&rsquo;s true of</p>
<p>Blackstone. It&rsquo;s true of Apollo. It&rsquo;s true of Carlisle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true of KKR, any of these publicly traded investment</p>
<p>managers, they live and die by their ability to constantly be</p>
<p>raising funds, which implicitly means you have to constantly be</p>
<p>writing funds, the returns decay, but that&rsquo;s okay, because</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re feeding your you know, you&rsquo;re taking money from</p>
<p>pension funds and other institutional limited partners</p>
<p>who are fine, because their hurdle is like six or 7%. So if</p>
<p>you deliver 11%, you still look like a genius, because you can</p>
<p>absorb so much money. So Andreessen wins by showing that</p>
<p>Adam Newman goes and picks him. Andreessen wins because they</p>
<p>have the ability to write a $350 million check. Andreessen</p>
<p>wins because they have $350 million less that they have to</p>
<p>actually put into the hands of other entrepreneurs. Now they</p>
<p>can do it with just one check. So it&rsquo;s a multifaceted win for</p>
<p>them. And it&rsquo;s a multifaceted win for Newman. I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also brand value for the entrepreneurs that have had</p>
<p>failed startups or issues with their first startup imploding,</p>
<p>and knowing that there&rsquo;s still a second bite at the apple. I</p>
<p>remember a survey and I just tried to pull it up, but I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t find it. So I may be wrong on this. But first round</p>
<p>capital years ago surveyed or did an analysis of all the</p>
<p>investments they had made. And I think one of the biggest</p>
<p>predictors of success in a startup was that it was the</p>
<p>founder&rsquo;s second startup. And so if you&rsquo;ve had failings the</p>
<p>first time around, you&rsquo;re more likely to have learned from</p>
<p>those failings to improve your performance the second time</p>
<p>around. And so as an entrepreneur, I looked at</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz after this investment and think, you know,</p>
<p>these guys will still back, you know, great entrepreneurs, even</p>
<p>if things went sideways, or there was an issue the first</p>
<p>time. And you&rsquo;ve got, you know, the ultimate kind of case for</p>
<p>that. Okay, speaking of Andreessen, I&rsquo;m going to move us</p>
<p>along. You guys wanted to cover this topic, not my favorite</p>
<p>topic. Just because I want to be careful about you guys decide</p>
<p>what you want to say. But I&rsquo;m going to bring up the Andreessen</p>
<p>NIMBYism thing in Atherton. You guys wanted to cover this,</p>
<p>right? Yeah, thumbs up. Sure. I mean, I mean, it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>well, I mean, everybody&rsquo;s talking about why wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s talking about it? Okay. So during COVID, Mark</p>
<p>Andreessen wrote a an essay called build. And I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>read an excerpt, he says, you don&rsquo;t just see the smug</p>
<p>complacency, the satisfaction with the status quo, and the</p>
<p>unwillingness to build in the pandemic or in healthcare.</p>
<p>Generally, you see it throughout Western life, and</p>
<p>specifically throughout American life, you see it in housing, and</p>
<p>the physical footprint of our cities, we can&rsquo;t build nearly</p>
<p>enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential,</p>
<p>which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in</p>
<p>places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for</p>
<p>regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. And</p>
<p>then last week, Mark and his wife, Laura submitted a letter</p>
<p>to the town of Atherton, to fight against multifamily</p>
<p>housing, saying I&rsquo;m writing this letter to communicate our</p>
<p>immense objection to the creation of multifamily overlay</p>
<p>zones in Atherton, please immediately remove all</p>
<p>multifamily overlay zoning projects from the housing</p>
<p>element, which will be submitted to the state in July, they will</p>
<p>massively decrease our home values, the quality of life</p>
<p>ourselves and our neighbors, and immensely increase the noise</p>
<p>pollution and traffic. sex. I&rsquo;m just gonna hand the mic over.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m happy to defend the residents of</p>
<p>Atherton on this. I&rsquo;m going to take the contrarian standpoint,</p>
<p>but I was gonna do the same. I thought you guys were gonna</p>
<p>match it. So well, look, I mean, do we have a problem where</p>
<p>housing is too hard to construct in the state of</p>
<p>California? Yes. And there&rsquo;s a bunch of reasons for that the</p>
<p>permitting process is Byzantine, it takes years, all</p>
<p>those delays cost money, the tenant rights movement has gone</p>
<p>so far that landlords basically can&rsquo;t, you know, it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>impossible to evict anybody. And that makes it so no one wants</p>
<p>to be a landlord, no one wants to build these multifamily</p>
<p>buildings, or buy them. And then you know, you&rsquo;ve got like</p>
<p>all these taxes. So you&rsquo;re just in California, in San Francisco,</p>
<p>for example, they just passed a 6% transfer tax, where if we</p>
<p>talked about in the show, and they basically just took 6% of</p>
<p>my home, and there&rsquo;s like nothing you can do about it. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons why people don&rsquo;t want to invest in</p>
<p>more housing in California. And I think that this Atherton</p>
<p>example is sort of cherry picked, because what this is,</p>
<p>is really zoning, you know, there are these suburbs, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just Atherton, I mean, you got the East Bay as well,</p>
<p>where people live in these areas that are zoned for single</p>
<p>family residences, as opposed to multifamily. And that</p>
<p>determines the character of the neighborhood. Now, if you go buy</p>
<p>a house in one of those neighborhoods, with that zoning,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s what you expect to be the case. I mean, you have to</p>
<p>spend more money buying a house in that neighborhood, because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re investing in the character of that neighborhood.</p>
<p>So it is unfair to the residents of that neighborhood for a</p>
<p>developer to come along and say, hey, I&rsquo;m going to change the</p>
<p>character of this place. So I can make money, I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>take a bunch of single family lots, turn them into multifamily</p>
<p>apartment complexes or something like that. So I can</p>
<p>understand why the residents would be against that. So I</p>
<p>would differentiate between legitimate reasons for zoning</p>
<p>and then things that the state or cities have done to undermine</p>
<p>the market for housing, basically creating frictions or</p>
<p>impediments in the market for housing. Now, it is the case</p>
<p>that as cities get bigger and need to free up land that you</p>
<p>might need to rezone, but the areas that you should look at</p>
<p>for that should make sense, right? I mean, I don&rsquo;t think you</p>
<p>go off to Atherton and change the character of that</p>
<p>neighborhood so that you can buy five more units. Yeah, I</p>
<p>mean, you should, you should look at like, why not look at</p>
<p>the areas around, say, public transit, like the BARTs and so</p>
<p>forth, where you could basically go up around there, and it</p>
<p>would make sense for the neighborhood. I mean, the</p>
<p>example I would give to kind of paint an extreme picture is</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you own a farm in the countryside, someone buys the</p>
<p>farm next to you, and then decides they want to build a 50</p>
<p>story tall skyscraper next to your farm, you would have a</p>
<p>serious objection because I think that the I mean, look,</p>
<p>look at the town of Venice in Italy. I mean, Chamath, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been there recently, but, you know, communities, local</p>
<p>communities can define the character of their community by</p>
<p>making zoning laws that, you know, allow a small city to</p>
<p>remain like a small city. I&rsquo;ve also always been against this</p>
<p>notion that we should allow any developer to build any size</p>
<p>building anywhere they want in San Francisco, which has been</p>
<p>an ardent cry from Silicon Valley progressives for years</p>
<p>that we need to let them build, let them build. But at the end</p>
<p>of the day, I moved to San Francisco 22 years ago. And it</p>
<p>was a small quaint city, it felt like a small city. And</p>
<p>building skyscrapers made it more congested, made it less</p>
<p>inviting, made it feel more industrial. And it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appealing to me as a resident. And I think that residents need</p>
<p>to have the right to define what they want their community to</p>
<p>be. The question it brings up then is, where do you build</p>
<p>because all residents everywhere would want to block</p>
<p>family housing, multifamily housing, skyscrapers. So I mean,</p>
<p>Chamath, I don&rsquo;t know if you have a point of view to counter</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re saying. But you know, how do we think about solving</p>
<p>this problem at scale, if everyone wants their local</p>
<p>communities to remain quaint, and interesting and not be built</p>
<p>out? Well, I think I think that&rsquo;s true for people who can</p>
<p>afford really nice homes in the suburbs, right? But there are a</p>
<p>lot of people that live in highly dense housing in urban</p>
<p>environments. And I think that&rsquo;s where we need to focus. First,</p>
<p>if you look at the data, California needs to build three</p>
<p>and a half million extra homes by 2025. That&rsquo;s a rule, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a so David&rsquo;s right, like focusing on a town with a</p>
<p>population of 7000 people is not going to solve the three and a</p>
<p>half million homes we need to build. And it brings up a bigger</p>
<p>question, which is then who is going to pay for all the</p>
<p>physical infrastructure that&rsquo;s going to be required, let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re able to actually double the population of</p>
<p>Atherton to 14,000. Well, you know, I live near that area. So</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll tell you is, Atherton has bad flooding, David, you</p>
<p>know, sacks actually used to live near there, too. So sacks</p>
<p>can can confirm this. You know, depending on when it rains, huge</p>
<p>pockets of water just collect everywhere that infrastructure</p>
<p>is bad. There are no sidewalks, right? So you kind of walk just</p>
<p>on the road. Cars whipping by, you know, could pick you off at</p>
<p>any moment. Now, those were decisions that, as David said,</p>
<p>the residents of that town made decades ago because of the</p>
<p>lifestyle that it created. And they traded away a highly dense</p>
<p>urban environment. Whereas if you just moved a mile, you know,</p>
<p>south, there are parts of Menlo Park and parts of Palo Alto</p>
<p>that are already in a situation to absorb very dense housing</p>
<p>where you could put that extra seven or 8000 people pretty</p>
<p>easily in a much what do you what do you do when those</p>
<p>people in that neighborhood in Menlo Park say I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>another apartment building here. I want it to be down the road</p>
<p>in Atherton, right? How do you resolve this conflict? And I</p>
<p>just want to remind everyone in September, Cal, I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>signed these bills, right? He signed 31 affordable housing</p>
<p>bills, which mandate by zip code and by city and by town,</p>
<p>the building of affordable housing to create equity in this</p>
<p>problem, or which basically means all these cities and all</p>
<p>these towns are now scrambling to figure out how do we meet our</p>
<p>state mandated objectives of new affordable housing in our zip</p>
<p>code, or in our town? And by the way, look, coming real</p>
<p>soon. Yeah, I mean, look, the and I think exactly as you said,</p>
<p>what will happen now as it goes to some state commission, and I</p>
<p>think that state commission can issue some sort of penalty or</p>
<p>something. So, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, I think the the residents</p>
<p>will pay for that freedom, if you will, to not have that</p>
<p>building happen. But again, I just go back to it doesn&rsquo;t solve</p>
<p>the crux of the problem. The crux of the problem is we need</p>
<p>to solve this housing crisis in the order of magnitude of</p>
<p>millions of homes. Okay. And so millions of homes can only be</p>
<p>absorbed mostly in cities. So the real conversation and you</p>
<p>know, is I have more sympathy for the residents of Atherton</p>
<p>than I do for residents of the city of San Francisco. Okay,</p>
<p>because there is dense housing in San Francisco, there already</p>
<p>is an infrastructure, social services that were designed and</p>
<p>built, there are sidewalks. Again, simple example, there are</p>
<p>stoplights, you know, in San Francisco, that a lot of these</p>
<p>towns don&rsquo;t actually have. Now, again, that was a decision they</p>
<p>made 50 years ago, and they would have to change that</p>
<p>decision. But my point is like, there are there are places that</p>
<p>are already shovel ready. And the real question is, why can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we build hundreds of 1000s of units. And so this is a good</p>
<p>article to write, because it&rsquo;s a Tony neighborhood. And you</p>
<p>know, there&rsquo;s a few 1000 folks. But I think the real issue won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get solved until we figure out how to green light hundreds of</p>
<p>1000s and millions, because we are three and a half million</p>
<p>homes short. J. Cal, what do you think? I mean, are you?</p>
<p>Well, you know, the the truth here is that this is not about</p>
<p>Atherton, this is every town, every city in California is</p>
<p>fighting all development, because if you fight the</p>
<p>development, well, yeah, you would obviously have less</p>
<p>traffic and supply and demand your homes become more valuable.</p>
<p>The place that&rsquo;s fought it most of all is San Francisco in the</p>
<p>city, where you cannot convert homes, you cannot take your</p>
<p>Victorian and make it into a townhome. And then if you look</p>
<p>at what&rsquo;s actually happening here, what they&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>against, and you know, this is the hypocrisy of it is, you</p>
<p>know, these are townhomes, this isn&rsquo;t like a 20 story, you know,</p>
<p>giant apartment building, their townhomes, and they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be $3 million each. And they&rsquo;re not going to be for scary people</p>
<p>and criminals and ruining people&rsquo;s quality of life. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be the venture partner or the receptionist, not even</p>
<p>the receptionist gonna be a venture partner, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be a CTO at a tech company who&rsquo;s going to be able to buy this,</p>
<p>and then be that much closer to work. And so it does reek of</p>
<p>hypocrisy. And there&rsquo;s a really simple solution here, which is,</p>
<p>you know, there are Caltrain stations up and down the</p>
<p>peninsula, there are, you know, in some places, you have other</p>
<p>municipal transportation along those corridors, they should</p>
<p>build up and they should build 10 story apartments, etc.</p>
<p>Redwood City did this recently, we&rsquo;ve all been there and seen</p>
<p>the apartments, they&rsquo;re just they&rsquo;re 60 cal, you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about you&rsquo;re talking about the exact kind of solution we need</p>
<p>because instead of trying to solve 100 units here or there,</p>
<p>Redwood City did an incredible job, they solved it in the scale</p>
<p>of 10s of 1000s of units. And it completely changed the downtown</p>
<p>of Redwood City. It is awesome. And it&rsquo;s awesome. Incredible.</p>
<p>Afraid of so what is incredible afraid of this is NIMBY ISM at</p>
<p>its worst, in my mind, I&rsquo;m not going to specifically make it</p>
<p>about Marc Andreessen. I think everybody, you know, has the</p>
<p>right to live in the neighborhood they want, they get</p>
<p>to state their feelings. I think what we need to do is convince</p>
<p>people. And I think there&rsquo;s two really good arguments here.</p>
<p>Number one, do you want your chef, you&rsquo;re saying convince</p>
<p>people, convince people to let their neighborhoods change,</p>
<p>because to let them evolve modestly to have homes that</p>
<p>their own children, or their own chefs and housekeepers and</p>
<p>associates, we all know people in the in the area who have</p>
<p>bought apartment buildings for their nannies, because you</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get a nanny, or you couldn&rsquo;t get a chef. So you you</p>
<p>bought some unit in Redwood City, and you rented it for your</p>
<p>nannies or whatever, like, we don&rsquo;t know people that have not</p>
<p>everyone. I do. I know multiple, or who have considered it. And</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the way you would convince NIMBY people to evolve</p>
<p>here. And then there&rsquo;s a second one. This has to do with work</p>
<p>from home. When you commute, you know, the issues of domestic</p>
<p>violence, depression, drug abuse, substance abuse, alcohol</p>
<p>abuse, all of that goes way up. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s somewhere between</p>
<p>30 and 40 minutes of a commute, you start to see people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quality of life seriously deteriorates. And so if we want</p>
<p>people to come back to offices, which Apple just mandated last</p>
<p>week, everybody&rsquo;s coming back three days a week, like it or</p>
<p>not, Tuesday, Thursdays, and you pick the other Wednesday, you</p>
<p>want to come to work, I guess. If we want people to come back</p>
<p>to work, but yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna have to build some taller homes.</p>
<p>The CEOs, the founders of the companies, the founders of the</p>
<p>venture firms, it&rsquo;s not about Marc Andreessen, it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>everybody. They don&rsquo;t have to commute, the office is within</p>
<p>walking distance or a bike ride of their office. People need to</p>
<p>start thinking about their nanny, their chef, their</p>
<p>firefighter and their employees. Jason, I may have</p>
<p>misread it, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have solved the problem for the</p>
<p>nanny, the chef, the teacher. No, this would be $3 million</p>
<p>units. No, it wouldn&rsquo;t even be that because the way that it</p>
<p>read, because I read it, said that it, you would have</p>
<p>qualified it by building what&rsquo;s called an ADU on your property.</p>
<p>Yes. So, that&rsquo;s another solution. So, people would have</p>
<p>built it for their grandmother or their in-law. A lot of</p>
<p>people are doing that, by the way. So, my point is the law,</p>
<p>the law as proposed was already hacked. And so, it would never</p>
<p>have accomplished what you were saying. I think the answer to</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying is what Redwood City did. It&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>towns all around the country should be doing, which is like</p>
<p>in and around particularly like transportation hubs, you should</p>
<p>be green lighting a lot of dense housing. But Jason, those are</p>
<p>not ADUs that sit on a property. No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Those are, those are $500,000. And by the way, those also</p>
<p>require not just the infrastructure, but it also</p>
<p>requires the financing and all of the, you know, the banks and</p>
<p>construction. The market&rsquo;s there to construct it. That&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>problem in California. The opposition is the problem, which</p>
<p>is why the federal, I&rsquo;m sorry, the state government&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>involved and superseding or trying to supersede what</p>
<p>happens on a local level. That&rsquo;s why Gavin Newsom is</p>
<p>passing these things is because each town is refusing to do it.</p>
<p>But another possible solution is if Atherton is so good at</p>
<p>blocking this stuff, and they have so much money, let them</p>
<p>pay a penalty and have Redwood City or San Carlos or another</p>
<p>neighborhood, Millbrae, that wants money, and they want to</p>
<p>build up. Millbrae is building, because that&rsquo;s where the BART</p>
<p>station ends, is it Millbrae? They&rsquo;re building up there.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re describing, like, are all these contortions and</p>
<p>what should be a more free market for housing construction.</p>
<p>I mean, the reality is, we&rsquo;ve done so many things to distort</p>
<p>the market.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>With these labyrinthine permit process processes that delay</p>
<p>projects for years and years, to, you know, to all the taxes</p>
<p>and other rules.</p>
<p>Well, they fight it, they fight it with all these environmental</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>Zoning is a little different. Yeah. So the nimbyism factors</p>
<p>into the permitting process. But, but I would, again, I would</p>
<p>differentiate zoning. But my point is just, we&rsquo;ve like, so</p>
<p>broken the free market for housing, that we then come along</p>
<p>and say, see, the free market&rsquo;s not working, we need more</p>
<p>government mandates. Look, is this happening in Miami? No, go</p>
<p>to Miami, there are cranes everywhere. They&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building multifamily or exactly. So in these, frankly,</p>
<p>red cities, red states, which are much more lightly regulated,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building a lot more. But at the same time, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>and in New York, which is constrained, so you have to</p>
<p>build up. Yeah. But Houston has no zoning.</p>
<p>Yeah, New York City has always had a very non sentimental view</p>
<p>towards construction. The city has always said, Okay, if you</p>
<p>want to build something bigger and better, you can tear it down</p>
<p>and start over. I mean, they have like air rights and so on</p>
<p>that you have to respect, but but New York City has never</p>
<p>they by and large, they don&rsquo;t constantly label buildings as</p>
<p>historic and say, you can&rsquo;t touch them and things like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s New York City has always wanted to keep being dynamic and</p>
<p>growing. So there are other places that just don&rsquo;t have this</p>
<p>problem. And they&rsquo;re able to achieve this growth without</p>
<p>building an apartment complex, like in the lot next to you, if</p>
<p>you live in the suburbs, and have a single family residence.</p>
<p>I mean, so I just think like, you know, the politicians in</p>
<p>California have so thoroughly broken the market for housing.</p>
<p>And now, what happens is, you get an article like this,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically scapegoating the residents of a suburb as</p>
<p>being the source of the problem when they didn&rsquo;t create this</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just fighting to keep the status quo. So they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>perpetuating it, I would say.</p>
<p>But you know, like, so first of all, I have no special love for</p>
<p>Atherton, Toronto. I lived there for a couple years. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like a Stepford community. I mean, I had to move</p>
<p>back to the city. Well, I&rsquo;m like, you know, somehow, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just more comfortable stepping over dirty needles and</p>
<p>excrement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re voting with your dollar.</p>
<p>I moved back to San Francisco, but look, it&rsquo;s like a really</p>
<p>weird place, because it&rsquo;s like Al Pacino and the devil&rsquo;s</p>
<p>advocate. Go ahead.</p>
<p>In addition to there being no sidewalks, there&rsquo;s literally no</p>
<p>offices, there&rsquo;s no grocery store, there&rsquo;s no commercial</p>
<p>real estate of any kind. There is no downtown there is there,</p>
<p>you know, so I don&rsquo;t know, like, where the hook is that you would</p>
<p>all of a sudden put an apartment complex. I mean, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>literally going to be building it in someone&rsquo;s backyard.</p>
<p>So the character of that neighborhood just doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>support it. And I think, you know, people coming together to</p>
<p>form their own cities, you know, under the principle of</p>
<p>subsidiarity, should be allowed reasonable freedom to basically</p>
<p>construct a city as they want in the way that they want to live.</p>
<p>And there are other cities that competition, Friedberg, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other cities that competition, Houston has no zoning,</p>
<p>essentially. So you can if you have a lot and you want to make</p>
<p>it into a school, or a hotel or a restaurant, you can do it.</p>
<p>And then outside of Austin, you kind of have that same thing,</p>
<p>people build all kinds of weird compounds and stuff. Are you</p>
<p>guys following? So it&rsquo;s a competition between those</p>
<p>cities. And I think San Francisco is losing. Yeah. Are</p>
<p>you guys following any of the startup cities that are being</p>
<p>built, where there&rsquo;s like a new city being built from the</p>
<p>ground up? And any of those seem like pull the sack? I mean, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know the names of any of them. But cul-de-sac is one.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, are these real? Are these real projects? Are we</p>
<p>going to see these emerging like next gen cities that, you</p>
<p>know, could be viable places to move to and live? Or is it</p>
<p>really just about, you know, transforming some of these cities</p>
<p>that are less regulatory? And that&rsquo;s ultimately what will win</p>
<p>in the market. You know, part of why the the regulation has</p>
<p>gotten so perverted in a lot of these towns is because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been able to gerrymander how you know, these public school</p>
<p>districts get funded. Yeah. And so you know, why folks are so</p>
<p>protective of it is, is again, and and, you know, to, to</p>
<p>underscore one of Saksa&rsquo;s points, this is much more</p>
<p>prevalent in democratic states and democratic cities where,</p>
<p>you know, coastal elites have really gerrymandered these</p>
<p>school districts. And that&rsquo;s a large reason why they, they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want a lot of building, they want to protect the tax</p>
<p>base, and they want to be able to funnel those specific tax</p>
<p>dollars into a few schools for their kids. And that&rsquo;s it. Yeah.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s actually a really good point. People don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know this undercurrent, which is, oh, it is. By the way, this</p>
<p>is the dirtiest little secret in these democratic states.</p>
<p>Again, mostly democratic. But if you look inside of</p>
<p>California, and a couple of other states, how horrendously</p>
<p>gerrymandered it is, so that you can basically redistrict in a</p>
<p>way to cordon off tax dollars to only then send to one or two</p>
<p>public schools that sit inside of your area, your zip code,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the law says. It&rsquo;s a zip code oriented</p>
<p>scheme is perverse, it&rsquo;s created incredibly horrible incentives</p>
<p>for people. So now David is right, which is that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a contortion of laws that come together, that</p>
<p>underlie some of these decisions that then manifest in</p>
<p>a petition like this, and etc, they all need to get cleaned up.</p>
<p>And Chamath it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s even worse than that, because</p>
<p>the same people who have rigged it so that all their tax dollars</p>
<p>stay in their non development community, then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>overfunding their public schools, they could have easily</p>
<p>afford private, but they&rsquo;re using all that money for just</p>
<p>their private school, and the one in the town next to it, East</p>
<p>Palo Alto, whatever, they have no money. And then these people</p>
<p>have the audacity to fight against school choice, so that</p>
<p>those poor people can take tax dollars, and then pick a better</p>
<p>school. So it&rsquo;s hypocrisy all the way up and down. And you</p>
<p>know, I think this is why people are largely moving to</p>
<p>different places around the country. And it&rsquo;s a competition</p>
<p>between states and cities. Okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go from super local to global. You know, this is a</p>
<p>topic I wanted to talk about today, because I want to bring</p>
<p>together a couple of breads, and get your guys&rsquo;s take on, you</p>
<p>know, all of these things kind of coming together and what it</p>
<p>means for foreign policy, and how things might play out on the</p>
<p>global stage in the next, you know, call it years to decades,</p>
<p>Xi Jinping, it&rsquo;s been reported this week, is taking a trip to</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia. You know, this is just a few weeks after Joe</p>
<p>Biden made his trip to Saudi Arabia, I&rsquo;ll read a just an</p>
<p>excerpt, he&rsquo;s going to end his more than two years of</p>
<p>self-imposed, in person diplomatic isolation, and his</p>
<p>first trip is going to be to Saudi Arabia. You know, this is</p>
<p>from unnamed Saudi sources. So it&rsquo;s unclear. This isn&rsquo;t an</p>
<p>official statement. This is just reporting. You know, the Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal reported in March that after six years of</p>
<p>negotiations, China and Saudi Arabia are getting close for</p>
<p>China to start paying, paying yuan for oil that they would be</p>
<p>buying from the Saudis. So there&rsquo;s an important kind of</p>
<p>economic tie up that may be emerging that that could affect</p>
<p>the US dollar and the the importance of the US dollar on</p>
<p>the global economic stage. And meanwhile, this week as well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been reported that China is doing military exercises with</p>
<p>Russia, inside Russia. So there is an extension of China and</p>
<p>their influence, and their economic tie ups and their</p>
<p>military activity with both China, sorry, with both Russia</p>
<p>and Saudi. I also want to highlight another important</p>
<p>point that came out this week, Saudi Aramco reported their</p>
<p>earnings, the largest earnings ever for a company $48 billion</p>
<p>of net profit in a quarter. That is more profit than Microsoft,</p>
<p>Apple, Facebook and Tesla combined. In a single quarter.</p>
<p>It is the most profitable business. And Saudis have been</p>
<p>very public about their intention of divesting their</p>
<p>interest in Saudi Aramco, which is their state owned and state</p>
<p>run oil company, and moving into other businesses. Over the</p>
<p>past couple of months, it&rsquo;s been reported that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>accumulated a nearly $100 billion equity portfolio, owning</p>
<p>stocks like Alphabet, zoom, Microsoft and others. It&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>been reported that they own over $160 billion of US treasuries.</p>
<p>So the US is very dependent in the private equity community in</p>
<p>the VC community and in the public markets on Saudi dollars.</p>
<p>Saudis have been large holders of US dollars. And now through</p>
<p>China, it looks like the Saudis may be having a tie up that</p>
<p>brings them closer to China it through this trade relationship</p>
<p>with the yuan and the visit from Xi Jinping, while China is</p>
<p>actively exercising, you know, their military inside of Russia</p>
<p>is the future, a China, Russia, Saudi axis, and should we be</p>
<p>concerned and should we be changing any of our tactics on</p>
<p>foreign policy, David Sachs, as this, you know, set of threads</p>
<p>plays out over the next couple of months and you know, going</p>
<p>Yes, I think we do need to make some changes finds backing away</p>
<p>from this now, but in his first year, he declared the Saudis be</p>
<p>pariahs and he did push them into China&rsquo;s arms. What was the</p>
<p>point of that? Biden recently had to go to the Middle East to</p>
<p>basically beg Saudi Arabia to increase their production of</p>
<p>oil. So he&rsquo;s already acknowledged that policy didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work. And one of the reasons it didn&rsquo;t work is because</p>
<p>simultaneously with declaring these allies to be enemies, he</p>
<p>basically restricted us to energy production, which is, you</p>
<p>know, strategically undermined. So</p>
<p>and the US has military bases in Saudi Arabia, very strategic</p>
<p>assets for the US military.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s listen, we sell them weapons, the US relationship</p>
<p>with Saudi Arabia is always going to be complex. They&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>complicated friend to have, but it&rsquo;s much better to have them as</p>
<p>a friend than basically drive them into China&rsquo;s arms. And the</p>
<p>reality is, whatever you think about the regime there and how</p>
<p>oppressive it is, first of all, we don&rsquo;t get to choose the</p>
<p>people running these countries. That&rsquo;s the lesson we should have</p>
<p>learned over and over again from all these failed regime change</p>
<p>operations. Second, do we have any reason to believe that if</p>
<p>that regime got toppled, it would get replaced with</p>
<p>something better. I think we all know that if the regime there</p>
<p>fell, it would probably be replaced with something</p>
<p>fundamentalist that we would like even less. And certainly,</p>
<p>if another nation were to basically dominate the region,</p>
<p>like Iran, that would be worse for us as well. So our</p>
<p>relationship with them is complicated, but ultimately,</p>
<p>they should be, I think, allies of the United States, and we</p>
<p>should not be working over time to push them into China&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>And I think similarly, with Russia, we&rsquo;ve basically declared</p>
<p>ourselves to be engaged in this proxy war with Russia, which</p>
<p>strategically, there&rsquo;s just nothing in it for us. You can</p>
<p>sympathize with the people of Ukraine all you want. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that in the past. And I think the question is,</p>
<p>does this China military exercise in Russia indicate an</p>
<p>escalation of our conflict with China to you? You know, or is</p>
<p>this something that, you know, just kind of par for the course</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, neighbors, you know, conducting</p>
<p>Mearsheimer, just an article in foreign affairs talking about</p>
<p>the Ukraine war reminding us that it&rsquo;s still going on. I</p>
<p>think people somehow think that this war is just stable, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll settle into forever war status, kind of like, like</p>
<p>Afghanistan, these conflicts in the Middle East, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on forever. It&rsquo;s actually very dangerous, it can always</p>
<p>escalate out of control. And as long as it&rsquo;s going on, I think</p>
<p>we just have to remember that it&rsquo;s going on, it poses a huge</p>
<p>global risk. And I would say that one of the things that,</p>
<p>again, we should be aware of is this idea that even though we</p>
<p>have problems and conflicts with multiple nations, we still</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually want to push them into each other&rsquo;s arms. Again,</p>
<p>the Soviet Union and China during the Cold War being the</p>
<p>key example. I mean, this principle of geopolitics goes</p>
<p>back 1000s of years to the Romans, right? Divide et impere,</p>
<p>divide and rule, you do not want to unite your enemies. And</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve done here is we keep pushing them together. You know,</p>
<p>China and Russia, historically have not been friends. They</p>
<p>share long borders together, neighbors generally have</p>
<p>problems with each other. These are nations with serious</p>
<p>conflicts or differences of interest. And we&rsquo;ve made it</p>
<p>really easy for China to turn Russia into the junior partner</p>
<p>in that relationship.</p>
<p>Tomas, do you think US foreign policy needs to change and that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re setting up this, you know, access of conflict, this</p>
<p>access of allies, that we don&rsquo;t want to have the allies? And</p>
<p>you know, would you kind of advise and also, you know, do</p>
<p>you get concerned about this oil yuan trade, where there may be</p>
<p>some, you know, economic tie ups that that really could</p>
<p>affect, you know, the dollar as a reserve currency?</p>
<p>Look, a couple things. I think it&rsquo;s really dramatic to kind of</p>
<p>paint it in the stark kind of like bipolar terms. I think we</p>
<p>are post all of that. So I understand how in the Cold War,</p>
<p>it was easy to fall into binary definitions of good and evil</p>
<p>one and zero us versus them team A versus team B. But in</p>
<p>2022, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how things work anymore. We&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>highly interconnected, highly global world. It&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>complicated. Dollar flows are real time. They&rsquo;re massive.</p>
<p>Cooperation is real time. It&rsquo;s all over the world. It&rsquo;s with</p>
<p>every country. So it allows every country actually the first</p>
<p>chance that they&rsquo;ve ever really had to maximize their own</p>
<p>potential for their own citizens. And that&rsquo;s really what</p>
<p>every country&rsquo;s goal is. Right. And so in that lens, look what</p>
<p>just happened today. gasprom said they&rsquo;re going to shut off</p>
<p>Nord Stream one just for a few, you know, a few days, right. But</p>
<p>as a result of that EU net gas has just gone absolutely</p>
<p>nuclear and just close at all time high 14 x 14 x where it was</p>
<p>pandemic, right? You know, price per unit for a year ahead.</p>
<p>So if you so if you take a step back, we are at max energy</p>
<p>production with all of the capacity all around the world 100</p>
<p>plus odd million barrels a day. Okay, global productivity</p>
<p>absorbs that there is very little room right now to expand</p>
<p>that without pushing the date in which that capacity is</p>
<p>available out until you know, 2028 to 2030. So effectively a</p>
<p>decade from now. So if you&rsquo;re in this situation, and you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>country with vast natural resources, of which I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>remind us America is one. I think the most important thing</p>
<p>you can do for your own citizens is to monetize these</p>
<p>petrochemicals. Now, get it out of the ground in a reasonable</p>
<p>way, sell them in the marketplace, because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>demand for it. Take that money and reinvest it in your people.</p>
<p>And I think if you look at it that way, the best run countries</p>
<p>are responding to this moment in time, like any company would,</p>
<p>how do you maximize demand and sell the product you have to the</p>
<p>most number of customers globally. And so I think the</p>
<p>Middle East is doing an incredible job the US by the</p>
<p>way, by passing the IRA. Finally, I think is on the right</p>
<p>footing because we can talk about this in a moment. But the</p>
<p>path to permitting and the path to clean up and by the way, it</p>
<p>puts fossil fuels on a level playing field with with clean</p>
<p>energy alternatives, emerging alternatives. Yeah, the best</p>
<p>thing that could have happened. Okay. So I think we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>behaving in a very rational, market focused way. And so I</p>
<p>would focus less on trying to dramatically kind of resolve</p>
<p>these things as a few countries versus everybody else. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening. Yeah, now it&rsquo;s more complex,</p>
<p>much more complicated than that. But I think the simple</p>
<p>explanation is people with resources in the ground of the</p>
<p>country in which they rule, have a responsibility, if they</p>
<p>believe that there&rsquo;s market demand to absorb that, so that</p>
<p>they can take the revenue that comes from it and reinvest it</p>
<p>in their people. That is true for the United States. It&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>for Saudi Arabia. It&rsquo;s true for every country in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Saudi Arabia is clearly making these</p>
<p>investments, right? Not just on Yeah, by the way, I mean, but</p>
<p>also housing and new industry and education. And then by the</p>
<p>way, and Saudi Arabia is becoming much more liberal as a</p>
<p>result to write the education standards. Yeah. And if you look</p>
<p>at the investment, like, you know, you didn&rsquo;t, you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to go to Dave Swenson, and understand portfolio allocation,</p>
<p>although I think the guys in Saudi are smart enough to have</p>
<p>probably done it. But if you&rsquo;re, if you have a lot of money</p>
<p>coming from one kind of business, and you need to make</p>
<p>sure that you can diversify so that you can reinvest over a</p>
<p>long period of time. If you look at countries that had huge</p>
<p>petrochemical related revenue flows, the Nordics, what did</p>
<p>they do, they stood up these huge sovereign wealth funds. And</p>
<p>those sovereign wealth funds went abroad, and they bought all</p>
<p>kinds of non correlated assets to those petrochemicals. That is</p>
<p>the same thing that Saudi is doing. Financial security for</p>
<p>their people. But it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like, what is the furthest</p>
<p>uncorrelated asset from oil? It turns out it&rsquo;s Apple, Facebook,</p>
<p>meta and Google. And US US Treasuries. Yeah. Yeah. Uber.</p>
<p>Hey, Jacob. So Jacob, let me let me ask this contrarian question</p>
<p>for you. Because you often talk about the authoritarianism of</p>
<p>these states, Saudi, China, Russia. You know, it seems to me</p>
<p>as we observe what&rsquo;s going on in Saudi, and maybe the case</p>
<p>could be made in China, to some degree, although there are</p>
<p>steps taken back, but also in Russia, that the US influence,</p>
<p>the economic and the political influence associated with these</p>
<p>these foreign policy conversions, could they maybe be</p>
<p>driving these business, these countries to be more liberal,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re seeing in Saudi now, of course, that women can</p>
<p>drive that there&rsquo;s new industry that there&rsquo;s education that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a technology industry booming, that the you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to have a turnover of government and a turnover of what is often</p>
<p>classified as authoritarian regime, for the operating model</p>
<p>to be influenced by the West in such a way that change happens</p>
<p>more slowly. And you do see liberalism emerge in these</p>
<p>countries with better educational standards, more</p>
<p>equality, more, more human rights. And so do you think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of because you often kind of paint a picture that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bad guys versus us? You know, do you not think that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re making an influence on these places locally, and that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing? Well, I would take exception to like, it&rsquo;s bad guys</p>
<p>versus us. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think we want to create a legion of</p>
<p>dictators. And nor do I think that&rsquo;s what this is, I would</p>
<p>actually agree with sacks, we should be embracing these folks</p>
<p>and having strong relationships with them, even though we are</p>
<p>fundamentally different operating systems for our</p>
<p>countries, democracy, we should be embracing. Sorry, you think</p>
<p>we should have a relationship with Putin, just 100%. I mean,</p>
<p>and we did, right? I mean, Obama was making some progress</p>
<p>on that. And we we did some great work. When, and obviously,</p>
<p>Trump has a very, very long standing, very deep. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know exactly how deep relationship with Putin. And we</p>
<p>did great work with we did. I mean, they did the he did his</p>
<p>pageant over there. I&rsquo;m making some jokes. They bought a lot</p>
<p>of apartments. That was a joke. Okay, just a little joke there.</p>
<p>But who knows? We&rsquo;ll find out over time, I suppose. Okay. But</p>
<p>we did great work with China in terms of containing North</p>
<p>Korea&rsquo;s nuclear ambitions, right. And so there are things</p>
<p>we can collaborate on. I think the most important thing,</p>
<p>though, is that while we are embracing them, building fabric</p>
<p>between them, communication, trade, whatever it is, we are</p>
<p>not relying on them. And that&rsquo;s really what we have to look at</p>
<p>when it comes to the kingdom. Because if not for the fact that</p>
<p>the kingdom won the you know, born on top of, you know, oil</p>
<p>fields, lottery, we would not be in a deep relationship with</p>
<p>this country. They&rsquo;re living under a 10th century, you know,</p>
<p>rule in terms of how they treat women, gay people, etc. And the</p>
<p>human rights is an important issue. And we wouldn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>deep relationship with them if we didn&rsquo;t have to do with the</p>
<p>oil, but we do. And so what I think we really need to be</p>
<p>focusing on here is maintaining great relationships with them.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t want to drive them to each other&rsquo;s arms. But</p>
<p>to Chamath&rsquo;s point, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re creating the</p>
<p>legion of doom to take on the US, I think they&rsquo;re just doing</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in their economic interest. And we need to do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in our economic interest, which really is investing in</p>
<p>nuclear investing in solar batteries, wind, and even</p>
<p>different rituals. And in the interest of the free world and</p>
<p>Europe, exactly. And if we are independent of them, then we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to go over there and kiss the ring. Like Biden had</p>
<p>to do, we don&rsquo;t have to, you know, deal with excuses. When</p>
<p>they do horrible things like murder, Khashoggi, or, you know,</p>
<p>just this past week, they put some Al Shihab in jail, she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>PhD student from the University of Leeds. She&rsquo;s now going to go</p>
<p>to jail for decades, because when she went back to Saudi</p>
<p>Arabia on vacation, this happened last week, gentlemen,</p>
<p>because she retweeted people. And so these human rights</p>
<p>violations, the murder of Khashoggi, all these things add</p>
<p>up the Uyghurs, etc. And we&rsquo;ll have a better ability to</p>
<p>negotiate and lead them as the shining city on the hill when we</p>
<p>work on being that shining city on the hill. And we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>dependent on them. And that&rsquo;s really what I think we have to</p>
<p>focus on is reducing the dependency on these countries. I</p>
<p>think we all agree on whether it&rsquo;s medical devices, PP drugs,</p>
<p>making our iPhones or oil to keep us right and then sort of</p>
<p>Europe. And that&rsquo;s where nuclear comes in.</p>
<p>Speaking of reducing dependency, you know, Joe Biden signed the</p>
<p>inflation Reduction Act, some people have said this is the</p>
<p>most important bill signed in years, if not decades, by, you</p>
<p>know, passed by US Congress signed by a president, because</p>
<p>it touches on so many points that folks believe will really</p>
<p>move the needle with respect to climate change. Chamath, I think</p>
<p>you made an interesting point in our group chat. And I think</p>
<p>maybe we should start there, which is, you know, at the end</p>
<p>of the day, the systems of industrial production on planet</p>
<p>Earth, were made in such a way that we never accounted for the</p>
<p>costs of the external output of these systems, meaning we can</p>
<p>burn fuel, put co2 into the atmosphere or put methane into</p>
<p>the atmosphere in the case of animal agriculture. And we get a</p>
<p>low cost product that we consume. And ultimately, no one</p>
<p>specifically pays for the cost of the carbon going into the</p>
<p>atmosphere, which I, and you know, many scientists would</p>
<p>argue, is having an anthropogenic effect on the</p>
<p>warming of the planet and more catastrophic weather and all</p>
<p>these other risks that we&rsquo;re now facing. And so the idea was,</p>
<p>you know, first principles, you should tax people for tax</p>
<p>industry tax businesses for the production of atmospheric carbon</p>
<p>that causes an effect that we&rsquo;re all going to have to pay to</p>
<p>repair over time. So you know, is that a point of view that you</p>
<p>hold Chamath because you know, you kind of brought this up in</p>
<p>our group text, but that&rsquo;s the that would be the ideal scenario</p>
<p>to resolve climate change is if you just tax carbon, we kind of,</p>
<p>you know, have a real solution here. And that this whole bill</p>
<p>is ultimately, you know, meant to kind of resolve the fact that</p>
<p>we simply cannot find a way to a carbon tax.</p>
<p>I actually think that what this bill did was killed the idea of</p>
<p>a carbon tax. I think it makes it completely unimportant, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll never see the light of day. Why? I think it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>in the absence of what we did in the IRA, there wasn&rsquo;t a clear</p>
<p>way of doing exactly what you said, which is letting people</p>
<p>figure out what the equivalent trading price would be for</p>
<p>burning a pound of coal versus, you know, generating the energy</p>
<p>needed to run something off of nuclear, there was no market</p>
<p>clearing function for that. And the reason is because you</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get an equivalent amount of capacity effectively</p>
<p>available online so that they could compete one for one. What</p>
<p>we did through this IRA was essentially use money to create</p>
<p>so many subsidies, and then to also greenlight the way that</p>
<p>incremental fossil fuel projects would come to market. So that</p>
<p>now they actually going to be put on a level playing field in</p>
<p>the broad open market so that they can compete. When that</p>
<p>happens, I think you will make those trade offs better</p>
<p>yourself. And as a result, I don&rsquo;t think that there will be a</p>
<p>necessary offset mechanism that will be required. Because this</p>
<p>plan will still get us to about 40% of the way there where we</p>
<p>want it to be by 2030, which is still a pretty decent leap</p>
<p>forward. There is no plan that gets us to where we all need to</p>
<p>be anyways. And I think that the appetite to go from this plan</p>
<p>to where we need to be doesn&rsquo;t really exist. So I think that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just going to have to kind of grit our teeth, get through</p>
<p>the implementation of the IRA, and realize that this is the</p>
<p>beginning of a probably 100 plus year project, nothing&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to get solved by 2050. Maybe you&rsquo;ll see something done by</p>
<ol start="2100">
<li>Probably not. It&rsquo;ll probably be a 2150 2200 kind of</li>
</ol>
<p>an objective. And in that lens, I think like a whole bunch of</p>
<p>business models got turned upside down. So I think carbon</p>
<p>markets and carbon trading are not going to be the thing that</p>
<p>we thought it was going to be. I think stuff like direct air</p>
<p>capture, again, are going to be toy projects off to the side. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think those are those are not those are not going to be</p>
<p>credible businesses, totally like we thought they were going</p>
<p>to be. Instead, the raw tonnage of dollars will do what America</p>
<p>was able to do for solar and PV over 2000 to 2022, which is</p>
<p>just crush the cost per watt into the pennies so that it can</p>
<p>be equivalent to hydro coal and nuclear and put everything on a</p>
<p>level playing field, and then allow the market to figure out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of other stuff in this bill. I want</p>
<p>to highlight for you guys. I don&rsquo;t know if any of you looked</p>
<p>at the CBO. So the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office,</p>
<p>anytime a bill is being voted on, they do an accounting</p>
<p>analysis on how much spending and how much revenue there will</p>
<p>be as a result of this bill for 10 years. Awesome. Yeah, I</p>
<p>checked it out. And so yeah, if you look at every year for the</p>
<p>next 10 years, the CBO score for this bill is that we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to spend an incremental we&rsquo;re going to increase the deficit by</p>
<p>$330 billion for the next five years. And then we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>decrease the deficit by 320 billion in the five years after</p>
<p>that. So the net effect over 10 years is we&rsquo;re only spending</p>
<p>$17 billion on the on the bill. And then on the revenue basis,</p>
<p>the expectation is we&rsquo;re going to generate 67 billion in</p>
<p>revenue in the first five years, and then another 20 billion in</p>
<p>the in the back five years. So this is actually being</p>
<p>accounted for and presented as deficit reduction. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s 87,000 new IRS agents being hired to go out and</p>
<p>audit people and find new revenue. And there&rsquo;s a 15%</p>
<p>corporate minimum tax being imposed on all companies. And</p>
<p>what this means is that companies, public companies,</p>
<p>private companies doing over a billion in revenue, historically</p>
<p>pay taxes on a book basis. Now they&rsquo;re paying taxes on a</p>
<p>financial statement basis, meaning the actual accounting</p>
<p>that they present to their shareholders.</p>
<p>Can I can ask you guys a question? How much was given to</p>
<p>the IRS?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, 10s of billions. Yeah,</p>
<p>80 billion. How much do you think it would cost? I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, pick your pick the pick the most excruciatingly</p>
<p>expensive third party outsourcing firm you could</p>
<p>Okay, to build an entire system to basically automatically</p>
<p>review every single tax return and throw exceptions and machine</p>
<p>learn and machine learn what fraud look like or what</p>
<p>misrepresentation let&rsquo;s say $5 billion, it&rsquo;d be the most</p>
<p>expensive, it&rsquo;d be the most expensive piece of software</p>
<p>ever written. And this is what was so kind of like that was the</p>
<p>only part of the bill that made less sense to me, I think</p>
<p>like, if you put really smart computers on the case, or gave</p>
<p>it to deep mind at Google and said, Can you guys build this</p>
<p>system, or machine learning and AI, you&rsquo;d be done acts and a</p>
<p>simpler tax, which I guess this is trying to do, but you know,</p>
<p>free bird, when I looked at this, and you sent it, my</p>
<p>initial reaction was, you know, this old adage, it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>impossible for these guys to find 87,000 humans that want to</p>
<p>work at the IRS. Number one, by the way, there&rsquo;s a funny video</p>
<p>on the recruiting that&rsquo;s been going on for that. But yeah, go</p>
<p>ahead. Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty good. I mean, you know, they were</p>
<p>asking for people who were ready to like have guns and like</p>
<p>be put their body in harm. And as I get the I was like, that</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be real. Anyway, the greatest this is what I got from</p>
<p>this Excel spreadsheet. The greatest tool for writing</p>
<p>fiction is not Microsoft Word. It&rsquo;s Excel. Like, there is no</p>
<p>way this thing is netting out to zero. Like this thing&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>cost us a fortune. Government is in shambles. We don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing. I thought that the links you sent for the</p>
<p>podcast with the pros and cons of the carbon tax was really</p>
<p>interesting. Because it is so complicated. When I heard these</p>
<p>tax experts explaining how you would implement a carbon tax,</p>
<p>and the import and export and then how often it would have to</p>
<p>be tweaked. And then who decides what your carbon footprint of</p>
<p>your watches and and where did the minerals come from to make</p>
<p>the watch and who gets paid on carbon, it just seemed to me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s errand. It&rsquo;d be much better to just what if</p>
<p>your watch is made from diamond and not carbon? Well, in that</p>
<p>case, you should just pay a million dollars because you are</p>
<p>the latest coastal elite. And we should just start with yachts</p>
<p>and watches. What I realized was what we really need to focus</p>
<p>on and you tell me if what you think, Friedberg, instead of</p>
<p>doing this carbon tax, which seems incredibly elegant, but we</p>
<p>all know is impossible to get consensus across hundreds of</p>
<p>governments and locales to negotiate this, it&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>happen, at least not effectively. And in real time,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be a much better technique to do what we do in</p>
<p>venture, which is here are the biggest problems in the world.</p>
<p>Here are the which in this case would be the biggest emitters.</p>
<p>Here are the best solutions. Here are the teams working on</p>
<p>the best solutions. Let&rsquo;s give the teams working on the best</p>
<p>solutions money to work down that list. And if it happens to</p>
<p>be, you know, ships coming from China, you know, with a bunch of</p>
<p>containers on and container ships, we measure that and you</p>
<p>know, the the thing I&rsquo;ve learned after the first six months of</p>
<p>investing in carbon because we have a syndicate now at Molly</p>
<p>wood who&rsquo;s working with me on this climate syndicate, we</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t find a lot of great investments. You know, that made</p>
<p>sense that weren&rsquo;t, you know, asset heavy, but then we</p>
<p>started to find, we found two great monitoring companies, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re monitoring air pollution, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>monitoring ship pollution. And we made investments in both of</p>
<p>those. And that seems to be where we&rsquo;re at is we should be</p>
<p>monitoring and figuring out where the carbon is and then</p>
<p>trying to solve it based on which ones are the easiest to</p>
<p>solve. Let me just say two things on that Bill Gates has</p>
<p>done a great job of this, you can read his latest book or go</p>
<p>to Gates notes. And he&rsquo;s done exactly what you described,</p>
<p>which is break it all down, show what we should do. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually how he&rsquo;s investing his own money. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>putting his money where his mouth is. So there&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good blueprint for this. He&rsquo;s done the best job of anyone</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen. The issue with the carbon tax is you have to come</p>
<p>up with a consistent, reliable way of measuring the carbon. And</p>
<p>then you have to do it consistently and broadly. How do</p>
<p>you miss you know, if you miss one factory or another, then</p>
<p>you have to ratchet up the price over time. So first thing</p>
<p>is the challenge of how do you agree on measuring? Second is</p>
<p>how do you agree on broad accountability? Third thing is</p>
<p>how do you ratchet the pricing over time? Fourth thing is how</p>
<p>do you deal with the offshoring problem? As soon as you start</p>
<p>taxing companies in the US for carbon emissions, all the</p>
<p>production is going to go offshore where they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>taxing for carbon emissions. And there&rsquo;s no way to account for</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing offshore. And this has been the challenge</p>
<p>with China. There is there is because part of your first</p>
<p>problem. Yeah, sorry, let me just hit the final one. We&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>come back to it. But the final big one is just the equity and</p>
<p>carbon tax. People have said that the ultimate increment in</p>
<p>cost of production is going to adversely affect lower income</p>
<p>people because they cannot afford the price of some stuff</p>
<p>going up by 25 to 50%. And it&rsquo;s really, you know, a luxury,</p>
<p>good, luxury, kind of privilege to be able to pay for the</p>
<p>incremental cost of stuff to account for the carbon offset</p>
<p>needed. So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the set of issues that have been</p>
<p>pushed back against the carbon tax. And it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>impossible to get implemented, and to really get into market.</p>
<p>Sorry, come on, go ahead.</p>
<p>No, I was just gonna say part of the problem in all of those</p>
<p>issues, if you offshore is still that there&rsquo;s people pushing for</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the scope three accounting, which is like, you</p>
<p>know, you got to go back to your supplier and your supplier,</p>
<p>supplier, and your supplier, supplier, supplier, and where</p>
<p>does it it&rsquo;s impossible, where does it end? It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>credible. So, you know, I think that the bill has actually</p>
<p>cleaned up a lot of future question marks about what we</p>
<p>have to do as a country to go about doing our part for climate</p>
<p>change. And I think it probably creates a reasonable blueprint</p>
<p>for everybody else. And now they&rsquo;re gonna have to do some</p>
<p>version of the same thing. And what&rsquo;s amazing is that if we</p>
<p>actually pass this framework, which is still yet to be</p>
<p>written around how to make permitting more seamless and</p>
<p>efficient for these hydrocarbon projects, it will really</p>
<p>unleash a massive torrent of both revenues back to the</p>
<p>United States. It&rsquo;ll increase our national security. And it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>allow us to really kind of put a dent in this thing, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll pull forward the amount of competition that it creates to</p>
<p>actually get off those hydrocarbons, which is a</p>
<p>alternative, I got, I got a notice from someone who&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>investor. And so there&rsquo;s a lot of climate tech funds now, a lot</p>
<p>of funds, J. Cal, you said you got a syndicate and carbon, but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of funds and a lot of investors that are putting a</p>
<p>lot of capital just into early stage climate technologies,</p>
<p>which travels everything from energy to materials to food, to</p>
<p>industrial and manufacturing, and so on. And I got a note from</p>
<p>one of these, these, these companies, a startup that</p>
<p>highlighted that the dollar 25 per gallon credit, a tax credit</p>
<p>for, you know, clean production of fuel, which kit which has to</p>
<p>demonstrate a 50% emissions reduction in the manufacturing</p>
<p>process will now make this startup profitable. And by the</p>
<p>way, you get an extra penny per gallon for every 1% reduction in</p>
<p>emissions below that 50% threshold. And so there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of startups that I&rsquo;m hearing about that their unit economic</p>
<p>models were questionable before. Now, because of this</p>
<p>bill, they are flipping profitable. And so I personally</p>
<p>think we are going to see a significant influx of venture</p>
<p>capital and support for a lot of these climate tech and you know,</p>
<p>new energy material and manufacturing projects that</p>
<p>otherwise may have been held back, because the subsidy will</p>
<p>kickstart. The question for me that I still don&rsquo;t have a good</p>
<p>answer to is are they sustainable? Over the long run,</p>
<p>if this bill gets shut down or repealed, and the funding sources</p>
<p>stop and the subsidies stop? Do these businesses survive? Or</p>
<p>are we simply creating regulatory capture models like</p>
<p>we did with other energy products in the past and with</p>
<p>food? If you&rsquo;re not contribution margin positive today, free this</p>
<p>bill in climate change. And the bill is the only way that you</p>
<p>get there. You&rsquo;re doing you just don&rsquo;t know. Great point. Yep.</p>
<p>sacks. The biggest line in this bill is the corporate minimum</p>
<p>tax. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this, but 15% minimum tax</p>
<p>applied to the accounting profit reported by any company</p>
<p>over a billion dollars. And they&rsquo;re estimating it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>generate 313 billion of incremental tax revenue over the</p>
<p>next 10 years. Do you have a point of view on whether this</p>
<p>corporate minimum tax is going to cause an issue with startups</p>
<p>and companies going public or the valuation in the public</p>
<p>markets? Or is this just you know, hey, this should happen.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you spent much</p>
<p>time on this. Well, no, I mean, I think the the issue here is</p>
<p>that why is it that these companies are able to pay so</p>
<p>little taxes? Well, the reason is because there&rsquo;s a zillion</p>
<p>loopholes and incentives and tax breaks in the existing code</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re taking advantage of. I mean, these large</p>
<p>companies have lots of accountants and lawyers, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not deliberately violating the law, they&rsquo;re scrupulously</p>
<p>adhering to it and taking advantage of it. So it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these tax breaks that they&rsquo;re able to use to pay no taxes.</p>
<p>Well, what does this bill do? You talk about the spending on</p>
<p>climate, you know, the 386 billion, most of it is tax</p>
<p>incentives, and some block grants. So this is now the</p>
<p>preferred form of, you know, quote, unquote, spending in</p>
<p>these bills are tax credits and incentives. This is the way</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to change people&rsquo;s behavior. So in other</p>
<p>words, the bill on the one hand is complaining that</p>
<p>corporations don&rsquo;t pay enough taxes, because there&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>many tax breaks, while the other hand creating a whole</p>
<p>slew of new tax breaks. So there&rsquo;s a little bit of a</p>
<p>contradiction there. Again, why are companies paying no</p>
<p>taxes because of the last 10 bills tax breaks that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to move the behavior of businesses and consumers</p>
<p>in a certain direction. So just recognize that that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>case. I think you also made a really good point about the</p>
<p>phantom deficit reduction here. So like you mentioned, and</p>
<p>we see this in lots of bills, all the excess spending, all</p>
<p>the deficit spending occurs in the first five years, and all</p>
<p>the deficit reduction occurs in the last five years,</p>
<p>something always intervenes to prevent the savings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like startup projections, right, sex?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re a sales guy, we&rsquo;ll cut the budget next</p>
<p>year, you know, and so just to give one example of this, so</p>
<p>this ACA subsidy extension, so this is the Obamacare</p>
<p>subsidies, about 60 something billion a year, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>extending it for three years, but they&rsquo;re assuming it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to die at that point, as opposed to keep being extended.</p>
<p>And no one&rsquo;s going to want to vote to make that go away in</p>
<p>three years, just like they don&rsquo;t want to vote to make it</p>
<p>go away now. So if you extend that subsidy, three years from</p>
<p>now, just that one item alone, makes the deficit reduction of</p>
<p>this bill go from 305 billion over the 10 year period, to</p>
<p>negative 155 billion. So just that one item, if you continue</p>
<p>it, and don&rsquo;t sunset it, just that one thing makes this a</p>
<p>hugely deficit, not reducing bill, but deficit increasing</p>
<p>bill. And so you wonder what problem is this bill really</p>
<p>solving? And they can&rsquo;t seem to agree on that. I mean, first,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re telling us, it&rsquo;s a deficit reduction bill, then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re telling us it&rsquo;s a climate bill, then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>telling us it&rsquo;s an inflation reduction bill. It seems to me</p>
<p>that if they&rsquo;re really proud of this and believe in it, they</p>
<p>would choose a name for the bill that actually reflected what it</p>
<p>was, well, all bills would be named something for everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sex. I mean, like, that&rsquo;s how all these bills get in order to</p>
<p>pass a bill bipartisan bill, you got to give something to</p>
<p>everyone. I mean, but this is mostly you know, this is mostly</p>
<p>a climate related bill. You know, this is mostly this is</p>
<p>mostly tax breaks, and block grants.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a huge tax issue with the the IRS agents</p>
<p>that are corporate minimum tax, but there&rsquo;s also a huge</p>
<p>component on prescription drugs. Chamath, I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>spent any time looking at this, but</p>
<p>Sorry, just on the IRS agent, kind of say add one detail on</p>
<p>that. Yeah. So the claim of the administration and the sponsors</p>
<p>of the bill is that this would not increase taxes on any one</p>
<p>sort of middle class. And so the Republicans, I think this is</p>
<p>one of the few politically smart things they did. They introduced</p>
<p>an amendment, basically prohibiting these new 87,000 IRS</p>
<p>agents from conducting audits of anyone making less than $400,000</p>
<p>a year, which was what Biden said, you know, he wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>increase taxes on anyone below 400,000. That amendment was</p>
<p>rejected on straight party lines. So this idea, yes, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the Crapo amendment, it was 5050. And Vice President</p>
<p>Harris had to come in and make the tiebreaking vote. So</p>
<p>obviously, they know that there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of net new</p>
<p>audits on people making less than four. Yes, exactly. So my</p>
<p>understanding of this is it&rsquo;s like small business owners,</p>
<p>people who run a small business and a service business. And are</p>
<p>they really accounting for their books correctly? Are they</p>
<p>really expensing the right things, etc? Are they accounting</p>
<p>for? They&rsquo;re gonna get whammy by this, because look, let&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>it, billionaires are already getting audited. You know, Elon</p>
<p>had a tweet saying, Listen, I get audited as a matter of</p>
<p>course, every year, you know, these people already have. So</p>
<p>yeah, dude, I use a big four accounting firm. Yeah. I mean,</p>
<p>the amount of I have a partner is crazy. I have a partner like</p>
<p>Anderson that is literally like, you know, covers a fortune</p>
<p>500 fucking company might as well be in your office, put them</p>
<p>in your your your put them in your unit. I mean, by the way,</p>
<p>sacks sacks is right. Like, if you look at them, you know, the</p>
<p>ultra wealthy, I think it would be I would be shocked if any of</p>
<p>those folks were actually evading taxes at all, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible the way that this infrastructure runs, like,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re getting k ones from Blackstone, what are you</p>
<p>gonna do to change that? Like, totally, you know, like, do you</p>
<p>guys even know the pin number of your bank card? I have no</p>
<p>idea. So like complicated. Yeah. Okay, so so my point is, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that if there is if there is cheating of taxes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s happening at that level. What&rsquo;s happening at that level</p>
<p>are much more structural issues like carried interest, which</p>
<p>they decided not to touch, or in a state law trust in a state</p>
<p>law. Those are those. No, I don&rsquo;t think that this is my</p>
<p>point. It&rsquo;s not mistakes. There&rsquo;s nobody with a pencil</p>
<p>really filling out a k one for Bill Gates, dummy. That&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>point. No, I know. But people can make mistakes. What if a k</p>
<p>one gets left off? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying is when they find</p>
<p>usually easily found to happen doesn&rsquo;t happen. I&rsquo;ve had my tax</p>
<p>return. It&rsquo;s done by an accounting firm. And I just</p>
<p>signed it. I don&rsquo;t know. I know that what I&rsquo;m talking about is</p>
<p>what are the IRS people going to find is you know, I&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you what they&rsquo;re going to find. They&rsquo;re going to find a lot of</p>
<p>guests, they&rsquo;re going to find a lot of middle class and upper</p>
<p>middle class folks. And they&rsquo;re going to have to focus on them</p>
<p>because individually, it may not represent a lot. But when you</p>
<p>multiply it by the number of people inside the United States,</p>
<p>and this is what the Wall Street Journal and a bunch of</p>
<p>other folks have been saying now, when you apply 87,000</p>
<p>people and task them incrementally with doing a job,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to touch these folks that are already audited,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to touch the folks that are not audited. And by</p>
<p>and large, a much much larger majority of middle income and</p>
<p>upper middle income people are not audited, which is why I</p>
<p>think you could spend a lot less than $80 billion and just</p>
<p>build software that guarantees only those that should be</p>
<p>audited are and uses machines to help figure out these leaks</p>
<p>or start simplifying the tax code. Because when you add this</p>
<p>15% minimum, Friedberg, what is that going to do to the strategy</p>
<p>of a public company? Okay, so we should show less earnings put</p>
<p>more to work, oh, we&rsquo;re not going to be able to depreciate</p>
<p>this or, you know, whatever. I mean, it&rsquo;s going to create all</p>
<p>these actually third order impact impacts that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. Well, I think sax&rsquo;s point is important, which is one that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t yet have insight into, which is what is this going to</p>
<p>cannibalize? Because ultimately, if there is a</p>
<p>minimum tax, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to pursue incentives that</p>
<p>create a tax break today. And therefore those incentives won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be invested in whatever those incentives are, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what they are, you know, low income manufacturing zone</p>
<p>development or whatever, who knows, you know what they are,</p>
<p>you know, come and build your business here and get tax</p>
<p>breaks, etc, etc. local, state and federal tax breaks. If</p>
<p>those start to get written over, then there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>really adverse effects. And I think that that&rsquo;s something to</p>
<p>watch. I don&rsquo;t understand it well enough. Certainly, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>an accountant. But I would be kind of worried about and</p>
<p>keeping an eye on that front. I do think the bigger question,</p>
<p>which is a biotech one, the prescription drug price cap</p>
<p>minimizes the profits that a number of pharmaceutical</p>
<p>companies will be making. It gives authority to go and</p>
<p>negotiate prices. This is the second largest line in the bill.</p>
<p>And there was a survey done by health affairs.org on an R&amp;D</p>
<p>survey, which said, Will you guys reduce your, your</p>
<p>investment in new drug development. And I think that</p>
<p>they came based on this bill. And I think that they came up</p>
<p>with some estimate that there would be two, the number two,</p>
<p>fewer drugs that would be kind of, you know, made available</p>
<p>per year, because of reduced spending, as a result of the</p>
<p>price cap, which basically reduces revenue, which will, in</p>
<p>essence, reduce R&amp;D investment. You know, guys like Bernie</p>
<p>Sanders will say, Hey, that&rsquo;s not true, all that money is</p>
<p>going to share buybacks and dividends, and so on. But it is</p>
<p>a fact that those share buybacks and those dividends will still</p>
<p>continue. And if they are reduced, so will the R&amp;D</p>
<p>expense. And if the R&amp;D expense is reduced, fewer drugs will</p>
<p>come to market. And so you know, there&rsquo;s also a question mark.</p>
<p>And people will debate this for the next decade, which is how</p>
<p>much will this prescription drug price cap actually have an</p>
<p>effect on R&amp;D investment and ultimately on new drugs that</p>
<p>come to market. My personal opinion, sorry, let me just say</p>
<p>my personal opinion is I don&rsquo;t think that this will have a</p>
<p>huge effect. I think this is an excellent part of the bill. I</p>
<p>think that the government should have authority to go and</p>
<p>negotiate. They&rsquo;re the largest buyer of these drugs. And</p>
<p>typically, when the US government, the federal</p>
<p>government steps in to be the largest spender on a particular</p>
<p>line, the cost of that line balloons, like we&rsquo;ve seen in</p>
<p>healthcare, like we&rsquo;ve seen in education, and like we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in military and defense spending. And so I&rsquo;m hopeful</p>
<p>that this will actually provide a more effective market force</p>
<p>in allowing the biggest customer in the market to negotiate</p>
<p>prices. And that the the VCs instead of making 48% IRR,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll ultimately make 28% IRR on the investments that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making in biotech startups. Well,</p>
<p>hold on, what exactly does it mean for the government to</p>
<p>negotiate prices, as opposed to the government just to fix</p>
<p>prices? I mean, is this price fixing? Well, in this, in this</p>
<p>example, he thinks the right answer if they&rsquo;re the largest</p>
<p>single largest customer sacks, right? I mean, you know, and</p>
<p>then they are the market. I mean, what&rsquo;s the right thing to</p>
<p>do? Well, I mean, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re saying that these drug companies</p>
<p>are going to make a lot less money. Well, obviously, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to have a downstream impact in the willingness to</p>
<p>fund new drugs, new investment, new R&amp;D. Yeah, now no one likes</p>
<p>pharma companies. So I&rsquo;m not defending exorbitant profits or</p>
<p>whatever. But I don&rsquo;t really know what it means for the</p>
<p>government to say they&rsquo;re negotiating. I mean, the</p>
<p>government just tells you what it&rsquo;s going to be. That&rsquo;s price</p>
<p>fixing. And these companies are going to adjust. Yes, the</p>
<p>government will pay less money in the near term. In the long</p>
<p>term, there could be reduced investment in R&amp;D. I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a balance of, you know, do you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>benefit? Don&rsquo;t all governments I know that you&rsquo;re close to some</p>
<p>of these drug companies, don&rsquo;t all governments negotiate the</p>
<p>purchase of these drugs. And then if they don&rsquo;t like the</p>
<p>price, there are alternative drugs. And they&rsquo;ll say, hey,</p>
<p>listen, your drug is too expensive compared to these</p>
<p>other two solutions. So we&rsquo;re going to buy this one primarily</p>
<p>for our universal healthcare. There&rsquo;s an interesting thing</p>
<p>that happens, which is that there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s these drugs</p>
<p>that are proprietary and under patent, okay? These could be</p>
<p>chemical drugs, or they could be biologics, okay. And</p>
<p>eventually, what happens is when they go generic, then folks</p>
<p>will step in and make lower cost versions of those generics</p>
<p>like, you know, I mean, I&rsquo;m on a stat and I think a couple of</p>
<p>you guys are on a stat and like, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s Lipitor,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not Lipitor, right? It&rsquo;s a tour of a stat. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like some generic drug that I just take, okay, as an example.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of folks that make that and the cost of those</p>
<p>pills basically go to zero. But there&rsquo;s a bunch of categories,</p>
<p>particularly for biologic drugs, where it&rsquo;s very different,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to make out what&rsquo;s called the biosimilar.</p>
<p>This is a generic drug. So long and short of it is there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these classes of drugs that kind of like standalone without</p>
<p>enough competition. And I think there are two ways to solve</p>
<p>this problem. One is where the government steps in, which I</p>
<p>think is good, but the better way has already is already been</p>
<p>happening in the United States. So, you know, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nonprofit, which is a collective between a bunch of hospitals</p>
<p>called civic up. And I think that&rsquo;s a really interesting</p>
<p>example. And what those guys do was they said, we&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>to create our own generic drug manufacturer, and we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>make the drugs we want, we&rsquo;re just going to make them super</p>
<p>cheap. And, you know, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re in the midst right now</p>
<p>of completing a massive facility. I think it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>Virginia, where they&rsquo;ll be able to make as much insulin as is</p>
<p>needed for the entirety of America, for no more than 35</p>
<p>bucks a dose. That gangster, that&rsquo;s gangster, it&rsquo;s super</p>
<p>gangster, make our own. And by the way, when California said</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to make their own, what they really meant was that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to go and RFP it out. And my hope is that they</p>
<p>end up going with somebody like civica, who has the experience</p>
<p>of actually building it. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s just going to</p>
<p>California is just going to waste hundreds of millions of</p>
<p>dollars proposal if you don&rsquo;t know what RFP is request for</p>
<p>proposal. Yeah. But there are these emerging nonprofits that</p>
<p>are basically doing the work of the government. I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a better solution to what sacks is actually a petition, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of creates competition. Yeah, competition.</p>
<p>We got to move along because I think</p>
<p>job Friedberg, right, just one moderator to another exceptional</p>
<p>job. You know, I appreciate it. I think one of the interesting</p>
<p>things sitting in your seat, J. Cal is you see everyone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>face. And you see the boredom and the annoyance that people</p>
<p>experienced during the pod. Watch the eye rolls, right? For</p>
<p>a drink. I think I think Chamath is eating Funyuns sacks and</p>
<p>no jerky jerky jerky. Okay, you shouldn&rsquo;t be don&rsquo;t tube in on</p>
<p>the podcast, please. Yeah, no. And I think that the don&rsquo;t what</p>
<p>the challenge Jeffrey to have been on this podcast. What is</p>
<p>it? No, that was a CNN anchor who on zoom accidentally. No, he</p>
<p>masturbated on a zoom call with his the fuck does that have to</p>
<p>do with beef jerky? You said jerking and I just I said I was</p>
<p>eating jerky dummy. You said you were jerking something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I heard. I&rsquo;m sorry. Oh, by the way, so I am no</p>
<p>longer fighting with Phil Hellmuth. I oh my god guys still</p>
<p>blocked. No, so I was so mad at him. Okay, so you know, I</p>
<p>finished I finished this transaction. I finished I</p>
<p>finished the fucking transaction to sell the warriors. You know,</p>
<p>this is this is a six month ordeal. Okay, I started in</p>
<p>November, right? I&rsquo;m starting to sell things. I decide I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to sell the warriors. I sell it to a large private</p>
<p>equity fund in November, December, and then we had to</p>
<p>wait for them to close the second fund and then we sold the</p>
<p>rest of it and it closed in June or July. And then I put out</p>
<p>this tweet, right? Like thanking everybody and thanking</p>
<p>Hellmuth the same line in which I I&rsquo;m like I thank Peter Thiel</p>
<p>and I thank Joe Lacob. Everybody is happy except for</p>
<p>Hellmuth who called me and is angry and he&rsquo;s like II. You</p>
<p>know, he had this issue with how it was characterized that</p>
<p>how he had introduced me or something where he wanted credit</p>
<p>for having done the first tweet of the tweet storm. He should</p>
<p>have been higher up or you know and I was like, well, Phil, what</p>
<p>if it hadn&rsquo;t made me money? Would you have just made me</p>
<p>whole? Like what would you have done? Like it&rsquo;s like you were</p>
<p>like the architect of this thing. Anyways, I was so mad. I</p>
<p>just said, I&rsquo;m not talking to this dipshit anymore. I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>with him. I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m breaking up with him and he would call</p>
<p>me when I was in Europe and I would ignore and I would get</p>
<p>this incredible enjoyment from just pressing to to voicemail.</p>
<p>He would send me text messages, ignore. And then I I mean this</p>
<p>is always happens this way. I did it once and Nat caught me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, why did you ignore his phone call? And I said, I</p>
<p>hate Phil. I&rsquo;m done with Hellmuth. I told her the story.</p>
<p>She got so **** mad at me and then I had to send this text.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just read you the text because I think it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>**** hilarious. I was going to ignore you for the rest of my</p>
<p>life. Based on your tantrum with me earlier this year. But</p>
<p>Nat has convinced me to see where you are coming from in</p>
<p>part. Anyways, we&rsquo;re good. Call me later. He called me one</p>
<p>second later. I was waiting. He had your text window open. I</p>
<p>could just picture Nat. He&rsquo;s your friend. Why do you gotta</p>
<p>be? You&rsquo;re such a jerk. He&rsquo;s your friend. You have no</p>
<p>friends. All of your friends are going away. Anyways, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>back in the good with me. I&rsquo;m back in the good. Okay. Well,</p>
<p>you gotta play poker. Um we do need to get a poker game.</p>
<p>Before we wrap, Saks is going to give us instead of doing</p>
<p>science corner, we&rsquo;re going to do Mar-a-Lago corner. Uh tell</p>
<p>us what it&rsquo;s like Saks. Yeah, what is Mar-a-Lago like? You&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had your membership now for 18 months? Never been there. Never</p>
<p>been there but no, I wanted I wanted to um I want to give a</p>
<p>shout out to this article because last week I took some</p>
<p>heat because somehow I guess you&rsquo;re not allowed to question</p>
<p>anymore the rectitude of the FBI. J Edgar Hoover&rsquo;s FBI. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not allowed to question anymore or a lot of people feel that</p>
<p>way. There was an article that came out in real clear</p>
<p>investigations just I think yesterday and what it exposed</p>
<p>is pretty amazing. The group, the unit within the FBI that</p>
<p>conducted the raid on Mar-a-Lago is the the same group</p>
<p>that conducted the investigation into Trump back in</p>
<p>2016 that lied to the FISA court that had its members, its</p>
<p>leaders, Peter Strzok were fired for basically wrongdoing</p>
<p>whose members are actually under investigation right now</p>
<p>by the special counsel John Durham and you&rsquo;ve got people</p>
<p>who are on probation right now. So, this is the same unit</p>
<p>that basically conducted the raid on Mar-a-Lago. So, I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still more to come out about this but it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>amazing to me actually that Christopher Ray, the head of</p>
<p>the FBI, Americ Garland, the head of the DOJ thought that</p>
<p>this wouldn&rsquo;t create the appearance of a conflict of</p>
<p>interest or impropriety. The fact that you&rsquo;ve got the same</p>
<p>unit that previously was disciplined for wrongdoing in</p>
<p>an investigation of Trump is the one conducting the raid on</p>
<p>Mar-a-Lago. So, pretty amazing. J-Cal, retort. I&rsquo;m sorry, what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about. No, I&rsquo;ll tell you. So brutal. No, I just</p>
<p>want to make a couple of child actors. Oh, they&rsquo;re on camera.</p>
<p>Look at these props. Amazing. Good work. Nice props. Oh,</p>
<p>beautiful. Sax, what you&rsquo;re seeing there. Hold on, Sax.</p>
<p>Before you get back to Trump, what you&rsquo;re seeing there is a</p>
<p>family unit. This is when a family gets together and</p>
<p>expresses love towards each other but continue about</p>
<p>Mar-a-Lago. No, that&rsquo;s wonderful. That&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wonderful. You could take a picture of this and you</p>
<p>could send it to your friends on Christmas. Alright, Jason,</p>
<p>you you are you do not accept the real clear investigation</p>
<p>report that maybe there is some long term. I&rsquo;ll um I have uh</p>
<p>actually some feedback. It&rsquo;s nothing to do with Sax. I just</p>
<p>think a lot of times I get positioned as sometimes when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moderating, I like to challenge Sax. Last week, I</p>
<p>chose to stay out of it. I let him go and I think one of the</p>
<p>reasons people didn&rsquo;t like your comments last week, Sax was</p>
<p>other than, you know, JR Grover being dead for 50 years,</p>
<p>putting that aside and it being irrelevant. I think the reason</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t like it was because I didn&rsquo;t come back at</p>
<p>you and question some of the things you were saying and so I</p>
<p>think they felt it was an unbalanced discussion. They</p>
<p>expect me to do that but I don&rsquo;t want to be pinned as the</p>
<p>adversary to to Sax&rsquo;s positions in every case because I&rsquo;m an</p>
<p>independent. I&rsquo;m a moderate. I voted Republican. I voted uh</p>
<p>Democrat my whole life. I voted for both of those parties but I</p>
<p>do think that what&rsquo;s happening here is you know, Trump is</p>
<p>under five different investigations. He&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>career of doing disgraceful, criminal, fraudulent things and</p>
<p>I feel very bad for GOP friends. Uh I feel bad for</p>
<p>Republicans because they have to carry water for him and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they they put themselves in this really difficult position of</p>
<p>defending him and you know, we&rsquo;ve talked on this podcast</p>
<p>about January 6th. We talked about voter fraud. My good</p>
<p>friend, one of my besties, David Sax said he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe that the election was there was election fraud and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t he he thought January 6th was disgusting. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>speaking for you. That&rsquo;s what you said and so I think you</p>
<p>know, the fact that the Republicans feel the need to</p>
<p>defend him constantly is one of the big problems here and I</p>
<p>think on the other side, the fact that the media is forcing</p>
<p>Republicans to defend him and creating this narrative and</p>
<p>this hysterics like, oh my god, see espionage act. He&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>espionage. This might be very simple. Trump lied, cheated,</p>
<p>stole his whole career from Trump University to what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening with you know, the Trump Corporation now uh with</p>
<p>the CFO and his nonprofit. This is his life is a history of</p>
<p>grifts and crimes and unethical behavior. What the GOP needs to</p>
<p>do is stop defending him and just let him go off into the</p>
<p>sunset as sex pointed out last week and that&rsquo;s what this</p>
<p>podcast needs to do. Because there&rsquo;s no reason for me to sit</p>
<p>here and do the left wing talking points or for you know,</p>
<p>sacks to do the right wing talking points. The fact is</p>
<p>first principles, Trump&rsquo;s a grifter. He&rsquo;s a democrat. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it. My point is not to defend every shady deal that Trump&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever done or even to defend Trump at all. My interest is</p>
<p>having a DOJ and FBI that&rsquo;s not politicized and is not used as</p>
<p>a political weapon or to pursue political targeting or</p>
<p>vendettas and the reality is at some point we&rsquo;re gonna move</p>
<p>past Trump as a country but the precedents that are created now</p>
<p>are gonna stick with us for a long time and the reality is we</p>
<p>should not have an FBI and a unit within the FBI that is</p>
<p>pursuing these political vendettas and in this article by</p>
<p>Real Clear Politics, the amazing thing, yeah, the amazing</p>
<p>thing is Christopher Wray prohibited this unit from</p>
<p>seeking warrants from the FISA court. So he knew there was</p>
<p>enough misbehavior last time to basically prohibit them but</p>
<p>seems to me that&rsquo;s a very narrow takeaway. It seems to me</p>
<p>that the takeaway should be we don&rsquo;t allow this unit to pursue</p>
<p>Trump again because they committed so much wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be cleaner to have a clean unit, right? Why wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they do that? Yeah, if that&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s true, because that is</p>
<p>from a biased source and if it is true, that&rsquo;ll be good. I</p>
<p>mean, Real Clear Politics is kind of like a politico. Look,</p>
<p>guys, this has been a lot of fun. J Cal, thank you for</p>
<p>letting me sit in your seat today. Yeah, we did great.</p>
<p>Awesome. You know, I appreciate that. It was it was a lot of</p>
<p>fun. Maybe Sax would like to have a run in the seat at some</p>
<p>point here. He doesn&rsquo;t. But for your as your guest moderator</p>
<p>for today, I&rsquo;m Dave Friedberg and this is your All In Pop.</p>
<p>Thank you. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride. Rain Man, David Sacks.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>gone crazy with it. Love you, Wes. I&rsquo;m the queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride. Besties are gone. That&rsquo;s my dog taking</p>
<p>a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh, man. We should all just get a room and just have one big</p>
<p>huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bee. We need to get merch.</p>
