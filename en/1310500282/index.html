    <p>we would come up to these rafts and these boats</p>
<p>that were in really dire shape and people would be pushed off</p>
<p>and people would jump off</p>
<p>and people would fall into the water</p>
<p>and some of them couldn&rsquo;t swim.</p>
<p>And so we found ourselves in this moment</p>
<p>where we had a choice.</p>
<p>We could film someone drown in front of us</p>
<p>or we could put our cameras down</p>
<p>and pull them out of the water.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Sky Fitzgerald,</p>
<p>a two time Oscar nominated documentary filmmaker</p>
<p>who made the films Hunger Ward, about the war in Yemen,</p>
<p>Lifeboat, about the search and rescue operations</p>
<p>off the coast of Libya,</p>
<p>and 50 Feet from Syria, about the war in Syria.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>

<p>Now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Sky Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>Nearly 811 million people worldwide are hungry today</p>
<p>and 45 million people are on the edge of famine</p>
<p>across 43 countries.</p>
<p>How do you feel?</p>
<p>How do you make sense of that many people suffering</p>
<p>from hunger and famine in the world today?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can make sense of it, Lex.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s deeply disturbing to me</p>
<p>that as a global community, we&rsquo;ve allowed this number</p>
<p>of people to go hungry when the food to feed them exists</p>
<p>and the resources to feed them exists.</p>
<p>I think the thing that disturbs me most about those figures</p>
<p>is that many of those who are starving today</p>
<p>or going hungry today are the net result of war</p>
<p>and intentional acts by leaders to starve entire populations.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the most deeply disturbing part to me.</p>
<p>You know your history and we all know that deeply embedded</p>
<p>in the Geneva Conventions post World War II,</p>
<p>the intent of one of those articles was to ban the use</p>
<p>of starvation as a weapon of war because of what Hitler did</p>
<p>during World War II.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been reiterated multiple times over the years</p>
<p>in international humanitarian law, including in 2018</p>
<p>because of the Saudi blockade over Yemen.</p>
<p>And yet to this day, starvation as a weapon of war</p>
<p>continues to be used in Ethiopia,</p>
<p>obviously in Ukraine right now and in Yemen</p>
<p>with the blockade over the country.</p>
<p>And that disgusts me that the law is in place</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t be enforced by the international bodies</p>
<p>and the nation states that make up</p>
<p>the international community.</p>
<p>So when the starvation is a result of human actions,</p>
<p>human decisions, that it&rsquo;s especially painful</p>
<p>to make sense of.</p>
<p>For me personally, yeah.</p>
<p>I think that if you and I sit in here,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t eat for three days and had to lay our head</p>
<p>on the sidewalk for a couple nights,</p>
<p>I think we would take hunger and homelessness</p>
<p>a lot more seriously.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, for some reason,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s missing at this moment in history, tragically.</p>
<p>And I think until that we can generate enough empathy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s immediate for all of us to understand</p>
<p>what that means to go hungry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re gonna sort of marshal</p>
<p>the global community to solve it.</p>
<p>I did just that by the way, fasted for three days recently.</p>
<p>It was fundamentally different, I think,</p>
<p>because the thing that would be terrifying to me</p>
<p>is not the fasting, but the hopelessness</p>
<p>at the end of the fasting.</p>
<p>Like I wouldn&rsquo;t know when the next meal is coming.</p>
<p>I always had the freedom to have the meal.</p>
<p>The fear, not just your own ability to eat and survive,</p>
<p>but your family&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s loved ones, that&rsquo;s the other thing I don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m single.</p>
<p>So I feel like the worst suffering</p>
<p>is watching somebody you love</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re supposed to be a caretaker of</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t take care of them.</p>
<p>And if all of that is caused by leaders</p>
<p>as a weapon of war, that is especially painful.</p>
<p>So how can we help?</p>
<p>What are the ways to help?</p>
<p>How do we alleviate this suffering?</p>
<p>Well, I think on the humanitarian front,</p>
<p>we have to be aggressive and attentive</p>
<p>and intervene in significant ways.</p>
<p>And I think on the political front,</p>
<p>we have to hold players accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>So the leaders that start the war.</p>
<p>So when you say we have to speak up</p>
<p>about the decisions and the humans making those decisions</p>
<p>that lead to the starvation.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s make it concrete.</p>
<p>So when I was, I don&rsquo;t wanna jump ahead,</p>
<p>but when I was filming Hunger Ward in Yemen,</p>
<p>I met a mother who, when she gave birth, weighed 70 pounds.</p>
<p>The mother weighed 70 pounds.</p>
<p>And so her daughter was starved in the womb.</p>
<p>When she was born, she was born into a world</p>
<p>with no breast milk, very little formula.</p>
<p>So she was starved before birth.</p>
<p>She was born into a world where she continued to be starved</p>
<p>by a mother who herself was starved.</p>
<p>I watched that child, her name is Asila, die in front of me.</p>
<p>Asila had no chance for all those things we hope for,</p>
<p>for a child in this world.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have a chance to grow up.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have a chance to discover love.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have a chance to have a career.</p>
<p>She was robbed of all of those things</p>
<p>because of the insidious nature of hunger</p>
<p>that she was born into.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have to die, she was not starving.</p>
<p>Her mother was being starved</p>
<p>because of the blockade over the country.</p>
<p>Now, who instituted that blockade?</p>
<p>MBS in Saudi Arabia with the reinforcement</p>
<p>and sort of tacit approval of the United States,</p>
<p>our own government here.</p>
<p>And so there are people who are responsible</p>
<p>for the starvation of children</p>
<p>and I think we need to hold them accountable.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to do,</p>
<p>but just because it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it ought not to be done.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about many cases like these</p>
<p>throughout history and going on today.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about Hunger Ward.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been nominated for an Oscar twice.</p>
<p>This is one of the times for a documentary.</p>
<p>Can you please tell me what Hunger Ward,</p>
<p>The Last Hope Between War and Starvation is about?</p>
<p>Hunger Ward is a short documentary</p>
<p>that really is an attempt to illustrate</p>
<p>the effects of the conflict on Yemen,</p>
<p>specifically on civilians.</p>
<p>And we document it in both the north</p>
<p>and the south of the country</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a bifurcated country.</p>
<p>The south is held by the globally recognized government</p>
<p>in the south, which up until last week</p>
<p>was run by, at least on the surface,</p>
<p>by President Hadi holed up in Riyadh.</p>
<p>He was essentially removed from office last week</p>
<p>by, most people would agree,</p>
<p>the Emiratis and the Saudis</p>
<p>to put in place a presidential council.</p>
<p>So we wanted to show that starvation was happening</p>
<p>in very similar fashions, both in the south and the north.</p>
<p>And we wanted to do this film</p>
<p>because so few people in the west</p>
<p>know anything about the conflict in Yemen,</p>
<p>nor the US&rsquo;s complicity in it.</p>
<p>And so my intent with the project</p>
<p>was try to bring it to a larger western audience</p>
<p>as an attempt to intervene</p>
<p>and change the political status quo,</p>
<p>which allows the use of starvation in Yemen to continue.</p>
<p>So US complicity, who are the bad guys?</p>
<p>Now, the world, unfortunately,</p>
<p>cannot be painted in black and white</p>
<p>of good guys and bad guys.</p>
<p>But for the purpose of conversation,</p>
<p>who is causing suffering in the world in this situation?</p>
<p>Who started the war?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>And then, of course, the roots of war go back in history.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s start at the top.</p>
<p>Well, there are bad actors and there are less bad actors.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s always the case in war, probably.</p>
<p>And everybody loses in war.</p>
<p>Yeah, I concur with that statement.</p>
<p>In the case of the status quo in Yemen right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a completely asymmetrical war.</p>
<p>And so the Saudi coalition,</p>
<p>which is made up of primarily Saudi Arabia,</p>
<p>the Emiratis, United States, France, Britain,</p>
<p>supplying weapons, but it&rsquo;s really driven</p>
<p>and catalyzed by Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s asymmetrical to a great extent</p>
<p>just because of the incredible firepower by air</p>
<p>that the Saudis use continuously to pummel Northern Yemen.</p>
<p>When I was there, the sheer volume of airstrikes</p>
<p>is hard to describe.</p>
<p>And we show the result of only one in the film, really.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an asymmetrical war.</p>
<p>The de facto authorities of the North,</p>
<p>Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthi rebel group,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have an air force, right?</p>
<p>They have a drone force, but they don&rsquo;t have an air force.</p>
<p>And so from a military standpoint,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely asymmetrical.</p>
<p>The Saudis really don&rsquo;t commit troops to the ground.</p>
<p>They use only proxies to fight on the ground.</p>
<p>What is the narrative they use to justify war?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a story on every side in war.</p>
<p>Some of it is grounded in truth.</p>
<p>Some of it is not at all grounded in truth,</p>
<p>also known as propaganda.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the narrative used by the Saudis for this war?</p>
<p>The Saudi line is essentially that the Houthis</p>
<p>are an illegitimate government,</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s really a proxy war between Iran,</p>
<p>who supports the Houthis nominally,</p>
<p>and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Saudi narrative.</p>
<p>The reality is something altogether different.</p>
<p>While the Houthis do receive support from Iran,</p>
<p>this is a war started by and sustained by MBS in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s MBS?</p>
<p>Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
<p>And who is he?</p>
<p>He is the son of the ruler of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his power?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking basic dumb questions.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the de facto ruler.</p>
<p>Of the military and the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, he seized control of the country several years ago,</p>
<p>even though he, on the surface,</p>
<p>is not the ruler of Saudi Arabia, he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the crown prince.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt often, but who is he as a man?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense of the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ve never met him,</p>
<p>and I likely will never meet him, hopefully.</p>
<p>But he is, I know a lot about him through his actions,</p>
<p>sort of in the MENA region,</p>
<p>Middle East and North Africa region.</p>
<p>And he is one of three, in my view,</p>
<p>as an American sitting here in the US,</p>
<p>three people in the world that I think</p>
<p>has caused such an incredible volume of misery</p>
<p>and suffering and murder on this planet</p>
<p>that I think if he weren&rsquo;t around,</p>
<p>the world would be a lot better place.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a violent person by nature,</p>
<p>but there are three human beings</p>
<p>that I think the world would be better off without.</p>
<p>Do you mind, before I ask other questions,</p>
<p>mentioning the three?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, Assad is one in Syria,</p>
<p>and that comes out of an earlier project</p>
<p>that I did in Syria and Turkey,</p>
<p>and what I saw Assad as a ruler do to his own people.</p>
<p>And Putin would be the third.</p>
<p>Those three human beings are murderers on a scale</p>
<p>beyond imagining.</p>
<p>On MBS, are you able to think as a documentary filmmaker,</p>
<p>as a human being, as a scholar, as a thinker,</p>
<p>with an open mind about a man like that</p>
<p>who does evil onto the world,</p>
<p>and what that must feel like</p>
<p>to be inside the mind of that man?</p>
<p>So basically, consider his worldview.</p>
<p>With most evil people, with all people, probably,</p>
<p>but with people who do evil onto the world,</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re doing good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the hero of their own story.</p>
<p>Right, and so to be able to place yourself,</p>
<p>I feel like, for me, to understand a person,</p>
<p>I have to literally, like the way actors</p>
<p>kind of have to do, you know,</p>
<p>live inside the body of the person they&rsquo;re trying to study.</p>
<p>Inhabit the character.</p>
<p>Inhabit the person.</p>
<p>So are you able to do that, or because you</p>
<p>are also studying the people who suffer</p>
<p>as a result, as a consequence of their actions,</p>
<p>you just, you put them in a box,</p>
<p>and you say, I hate the person in that box.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to move on.</p>
<p>This goes back to your black and white statement</p>
<p>at the beginning, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, the world as a whole, of course,</p>
<p>you know, is every gradation of gray, right?</p>
<p>My background is theater, Lex,</p>
<p>and so I was trained long before I picked up a camera</p>
<p>to inhabit other characters, right?</p>
<p>I have two degrees in theater,</p>
<p>and so that level of sort of like</p>
<p>walking in other people&rsquo;s shoes</p>
<p>and trying to understand and empathize</p>
<p>with their worldview is fundamental</p>
<p>to how I live my life and how I do my work.</p>
<p>So in the case of those three that I named,</p>
<p>Assad, MBS, and Putin, yeah, I can go there</p>
<p>and think through how they came to be,</p>
<p>who they are, right, from afar, right?</p>
<p>And after I go through that process,</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any way</p>
<p>that one can justify what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about each of those people, for sure.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not an expert on any of them.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re a human being,</p>
<p>which makes you a partial expert on human nature</p>
<p>because nobody&rsquo;s an expert.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just as good as anyone else.</p>
<p>Anybody who actually carries a camera</p>
<p>and listens and observe others</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t especially an expert of human nature.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s willing to take that leap</p>
<p>and truly understand somebody of any level, not leaders.</p>
<p>I feel like to understand a leader,</p>
<p>you have to first understand humans,</p>
<p>and to understand humans, you have to see humans</p>
<p>at their worst and their best,</p>
<p>which is something that you&rsquo;ve definitely done.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s stick on Hunger Ward.</p>
<p>This lens that you&rsquo;ve chosen to look at this</p>
<p>is through a single, maybe you can speak to that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned the starvation as a result of war.</p>
<p>What is the documentary?</p>
<p>Like, what is the lens you&rsquo;ve chosen</p>
<p>to give the world a peek at the results,</p>
<p>at the suffering that&rsquo;s a result of this war?</p>
<p>People a lot of times will ask me</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;ve seen Hunger Ward, you know.</p>
<p>They ask where the hope is, right?</p>
<p>You read the byline earlier, The Lost Hope.</p>
<p>And what I try to focus on in many of my films,</p>
<p>including Hunger Ward, is in the very difficult context</p>
<p>of war, as the case is in Hunger Ward in Yemen,</p>
<p>I look for hope, and I look for inspiration,</p>
<p>and I do that through people who are doing incredible things</p>
<p>under the most difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>So when I set out to do a film</p>
<p>about starvation in Yemen, right?</p>
<p>I mean, just listen to that statement.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the hope there, right?</p>
<p>And yet what I found, what I discovered,</p>
<p>were human beings that we could tell the story through</p>
<p>who are incredible, inspirational human beings</p>
<p>doing amazing things every day.</p>
<p>One of those is Makiya Maji, a nurse practitioner</p>
<p>in the north of the country at a small rural clinic.</p>
<p>And another is Dr. Aida Al Sadiq,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a pediatrician in the south of the country.</p>
<p>And so we chose to tell the story</p>
<p>sort of through their experiences as caregivers,</p>
<p>devoting their lives to try to save this entire cohort,</p>
<p>this entire generation of children</p>
<p>that has been born into starvation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an incredible, difficult task,</p>
<p>but equally inspirational to watch these human beings</p>
<p>devote every minute of every day to save a child.</p>
<p>I mean, in my view,</p>
<p>nothing is more important than that action.</p>
<p>Maybe on that point, real quick.</p>
<p>So there is suffering at scale, starvation at scale.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I mean, the numbers,</p>
<p>maybe you can mention in Yemen,</p>
<p>what are the numbers in terms of people in starvation,</p>
<p>but from a perspective of a nurse practitioner or a doctor,</p>
<p>you always have, you&rsquo;re treating one person in front of you.</p>
<p>So how do you make sense of that calculus,</p>
<p>of like there&rsquo;s a huge number of people suffering,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s just the person in front of you?</p>
<p>Is that all we can do as humans,</p>
<p>is just to help one person at a time?</p>
<p>Is that the right way to think and to approach these problems</p>
<p>or can you actually make sense of the numbers?</p>
<p>Speaking just as a human being,</p>
<p>I think the scale of suffering is so great in Yemen</p>
<p>that I think I&rsquo;d be overwhelmed if I focused on that scale.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard that a child dies</p>
<p>every 75 seconds in Yemen from hunger.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been sitting here, how long?</p>
<p>35 minutes or so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good handful of children</p>
<p>that have already passed away.</p>
<p>So to overcome sort of, I think,</p>
<p>that danger of psychic numbing, which can happen</p>
<p>when you think about suffering on such a large scale,</p>
<p>as a filmmaker, as a human being,</p>
<p>I have to focus in on the individuals,</p>
<p>on those human beings in front of me.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s exactly what Dr. Al Sadiq and Makiya do</p>
<p>to keep going each day.</p>
<p>And one of the amazing things</p>
<p>about these two healthcare providers</p>
<p>that we showcased in the film is that</p>
<p>they treat anyone who shows up, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to have money.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to have any resources.</p>
<p>They just have to get to the clinic or the hospital.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s incredibly moving to see sort of the flexibility</p>
<p>of their thinking in terms of how they make that work.</p>
<p>Makiya, for example, I saw her in the north of the country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly rural clinic that she works at.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a magnet for all the cases</p>
<p>in the north of the country.</p>
<p>People come from hundreds of kilometers away sometimes</p>
<p>for specialty treatment of pediatric malnutrition.</p>
<p>And one time I saw a child come in</p>
<p>and it was a male relative that brought this young girl in.</p>
<p>And just because of sort of the gender dynamics in Yemen,</p>
<p>there had to be a parent or a relative there</p>
<p>to stay with the child while they&rsquo;re at the clinic.</p>
<p>And it was a male relative.</p>
<p>And so what many doctors in that instance would do</p>
<p>would just turn them away.</p>
<p>And instead what Makiya did is she walked</p>
<p>into one of the rooms, talked to one of the other mothers</p>
<p>and convinced them to become the temporary guardian,</p>
<p>essentially, of this child</p>
<p>until a female relative could arrive.</p>
<p>So, you know, she&rsquo;s flexible.</p>
<p>She finds solutions rather than allowing the problems</p>
<p>to deter solutions.</p>
<p>One child at a time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, one child at a time.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you saw a child die in front of you.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re filming this as a filmmaker,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that like psychologically, philosophically,</p>
<p>creatively as a filmmaker, as a storyteller?</p>
<p>What do you do there as a human and as a filmmaker?</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s that whole experience like?</p>
<p>Because you get to, like you said,</p>
<p>you take it to the whole journey</p>
<p>of a starving mother giving birth to a starving child.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something I want to film.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that I certainly wanted to happen</p>
<p>or seek out, but it happened.</p>
<p>And the sad truth is that it happens every week</p>
<p>at that hospital.</p>
<p>And so when it happened in this instance,</p>
<p>I felt an incredible responsibility</p>
<p>to do justice to that reality,</p>
<p>to acknowledge that a child had just died</p>
<p>of starvation related causes.</p>
<p>And to find some way, if the parents wanted us to,</p>
<p>to integrate that into this story</p>
<p>we bring back to a Western audience.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve filmed many difficult things over the years.</p>
<p>And usually I really love filming.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t love filming Hunger Ward.</p>
<p>It was not a process that I enjoyed</p>
<p>on any way, show, perform, sadly, because of the content.</p>
<p>Because who wants to watch a child die in front of them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, but I did.</p>
<p>And I had to.</p>
<p>And when that happened,</p>
<p>I felt an incredible responsibility again,</p>
<p>to go deep, right?</p>
<p>To go deep with that family,</p>
<p>to tell the story of this hospital</p>
<p>with every sort of ounce of focus and talent</p>
<p>that I could bring to the story.</p>
<p>Because people should know</p>
<p>that children are dying of starvation right now</p>
<p>as we sit here.</p>
<p>And that that doesn&rsquo;t have to happen.</p>
<p>And it is happening because of political dynamics</p>
<p>that we can intervene on.</p>
<p>Is there times you wanted to walk away,</p>
<p>quit the telling of the story,</p>
<p>come back to the United States</p>
<p>where you can just appreciate</p>
<p>the wonderful comfort you can have</p>
<p>just sitting there and having food</p>
<p>and freedom to do whatever you want,</p>
<p>those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have to be in the United States.</p>
<p>In a lot of places in the world.</p>
<p>Well, that dynamic of sort of like survivor&rsquo;s guilt</p>
<p>on some level definitely exists.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things from Hunger Report actually</p>
<p>was eating, right?</p>
<p>Because we were in these malnutrition clinics,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called TFCs, Therapeutic Feeding Centers,</p>
<p>where over a long period of time,</p>
<p>children lost the ability to eat normal food, right?</p>
<p>And couldn&rsquo;t digest it and just were literally starving.</p>
<p>And the practitioners were trying to bring them back</p>
<p>to a state of thriving.</p>
<p>But to leave those clinics, right?</p>
<p>And to go to our camp or to go to our hotel</p>
<p>and then to have access to food, right?</p>
<p>Because we could buy food on the streets and in the hotels.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a very intentional act</p>
<p>throughout the course of the shoot</p>
<p>to look at a piece of bread, right?</p>
<p>Or to look at a bowl of rice and think about that child</p>
<p>in the TFC and think about how the privilege</p>
<p>of having that bowl of rice that I could eat and digest.</p>
<p>So it certainly every day helped me appreciate, right?</p>
<p>The privilege I had.</p>
<p>Every bite you take.</p>
<p>With every bite, absolutely.</p>
<p>And so I wouldn&rsquo;t call it guilt.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t exactly guilt,</p>
<p>but it was definitely mindfulness, right?</p>
<p>Meditate on the suffering of people who can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, exactly.</p>
<p>So that knowledge sort of, it was catalytic in some ways.</p>
<p>It sort of moved us forward really wanting</p>
<p>to shape the most powerful story we could</p>
<p>because we were surrounded by so much suffering.</p>
<p>So much suffering every day.</p>
<p>How did filming that movie change you as a man?</p>
<p>As a human being?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve filmed a few difficult documentaries.</p>
<p>That one is a heavy one.</p>
<p>When you think of the person you were before you filmed it,</p>
<p>and now when you wake up every morning</p>
<p>and look yourself in the mirror,</p>
<p>how is that person different?</p>
<p>Every documentary I do changes me in a different way.</p>
<p>Like I am not static in that sense, right?</p>
<p>And preformed, it&rsquo;s like I change with every project</p>
<p>because so many of them are difficult and challenging, right?</p>
<p>And so in order to do them,</p>
<p>I have to allow myself to change and be changed by them.</p>
<p>In the case of Hunger Ward,</p>
<p>you may remember the girl Omeima,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the 10 year old girl who we showcase in Auden</p>
<p>in the south of the country.</p>
<p>And we were there when she was admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>And when she was admitted,</p>
<p>this 10 year old girl weighed 24 pounds</p>
<p>and she could barely stand up.</p>
<p>And we started with the permission of the family</p>
<p>to start to document her treatment</p>
<p>and to see what would happen with this young girl</p>
<p>who is so severely malnourished.</p>
<p>And we watched her be treated by the nurses</p>
<p>and the doctors in Sadaka Hospital.</p>
<p>And slowly over the course of a couple of weeks,</p>
<p>we saw her change.</p>
<p>We saw her start to sort of gain strength</p>
<p>and start to recover.</p>
<p>And she also watched the caregivers very carefully.</p>
<p>And I watched her watch them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll never forget there was a moment</p>
<p>where about two and a half weeks, I think,</p>
<p>into her treatment, we walked into a room</p>
<p>and I saw her offering a cap full of water</p>
<p>to another younger child who was also starving.</p>
<p>The shot&rsquo;s actually in the film.</p>
<p>And so to see Omeima, this child who&rsquo;s starving,</p>
<p>giving sustenance to a younger, more vulnerable child</p>
<p>who is also starving, moved me deeply.</p>
<p>So I saw her learn from the caregivers around her.</p>
<p>And as a human being, as a filmmaker,</p>
<p>I was incredibly inspired by Omeima.</p>
<p>That capacity for compassion is there.</p>
<p>Even within a 10 year old girl who&rsquo;s starving.</p>
<p>And so you asked what changed me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one moment, right?</p>
<p>Rather than being crushed by such heavy content,</p>
<p>it was actually the opposite,</p>
<p>where I came away inspired by a 10 year old girl.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t anticipate that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what this content would do,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s what it did.</p>
<p>It reinforced for me sort of this incredible capacity</p>
<p>we all have as human beings, right?</p>
<p>To do good, right?</p>
<p>To even within the most difficult circumstances,</p>
<p>to choose who we become and what we do.</p>
<p>And a 10 year old girl taught me that</p>
<p>or reinforced that for me.</p>
<p>Were you able to feel the culture of the people,</p>
<p>so the language barrier,</p>
<p>were you able to break through the language barrier,</p>
<p>the culture barrier, to understand the people?</p>
<p>Because even suffering has a language of sorts,</p>
<p>depending on where you are.</p>
<p>The way people joke about things,</p>
<p>the way they cry, the way.</p>
<p>This is an interesting thing I actually wanna ask you.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m asking a million questions.</p>
<p>I find that the people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking to people in Ukraine and Russia,</p>
<p>but in general, I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to talk to people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been through trauma in their life.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a humor they have about trauma</p>
<p>in hard times.</p>
<p>It depends on the culture, of course.</p>
<p>Certainly, Russian speaking folk,</p>
<p>I mean, the more suffering you&rsquo;ve experienced,</p>
<p>for some reason, the more they joke about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re able to see something deep</p>
<p>about humanity now that they have suffered</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to laugh at the absurdity,</p>
<p>the injustice of it all.</p>
<p>And you could also say it&rsquo;s a way for them to deal with it.</p>
<p>But that humor has a kind of profound understanding</p>
<p>within it about what it means to be human.</p>
<p>That I just, and then you, to really understand it,</p>
<p>you have to know the language.</p>
<p>So I guess I&rsquo;m asking, were you able to really feel</p>
<p>the humans on the other side of the language?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think so.</p>
<p>I mean, as you noted, there are universities</p>
<p>and there are universals in life that transcend language.</p>
<p>I mean, suffering is suffering.</p>
<p>Love is love.</p>
<p>Compassion doesn&rsquo;t take place only through language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s through actions.</p>
<p>And so was there a language barrier?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Did we try to bridge that through other means</p>
<p>and sort of universal emotions and experiences?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things I always think about</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m filming is how do we distill down to universals</p>
<p>through imagery, through the vocabulary of cinema?</p>
<p>Because I believe so deeply that</p>
<p>that vocabulary should be visual.</p>
<p>So the words, what&rsquo;s the most powerful way</p>
<p>to express the universal?</p>
<p>Is it visual or is it language words?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s visual.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about the human face</p>
<p>or human face, human body, everything.</p>
<p>Through actions as well.</p>
<p>Actions, the dynamic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about a woman named Salha in the film</p>
<p>who isn&rsquo;t named, but you see her multiple times</p>
<p>throughout the film.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s basically the matron of the ward in the South.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s the gatekeeper for the ward.</p>
<p>So no one enters that ward without her permission.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s literally the gatekeeper at the door.</p>
<p>So no one comes in unless Salha allows them to come in.</p>
<p>But then she also is sort of like</p>
<p>the first point of contact for compassion in the ward.</p>
<p>So when mothers and families are admitted,</p>
<p>she forms relationships between the moms</p>
<p>and the grandmothers, for example,</p>
<p>who are admitted and who are living there on the ward.</p>
<p>And she does it through hugging, right?</p>
<p>She does it through bringing them food, right?</p>
<p>And she forms these really rather quickly</p>
<p>deep relationships of compassion with the families.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s amazing to watch</p>
<p>and no language is needed, right, to bear witness to this.</p>
<p>And she also suffers because of that, right?</p>
<p>And so near the end of the film, if you recall,</p>
<p>when another child dies and the mother is wailing,</p>
<p>we actually cut away to Salha, who&rsquo;s in the hallway,</p>
<p>who walks into another room and begins sobbing.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not a family member,</p>
<p>but she has a deep relationship with that family</p>
<p>that she forged as soon as they stepped into the ward.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s universal, right?</p>
<p>To see a woman weep because a child has died,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not related to that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a universal sort of emotional experience</p>
<p>we can all relate to.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean by visual vocabulary.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s especially powerful</p>
<p>because she has seen much of this kind of suffering</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s still, maybe she has built up some callous</p>
<p>to be able to work day to day,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still an ocean underneath the ice.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s kept her heart open</p>
<p>despite all the pain that she sees and feels every day.</p>
<p>Somehow she&rsquo;s a human being who&rsquo;s able to do that,</p>
<p>which is a very difficult thing to do, right?</p>
<p>She still allows herself to be vulnerable.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s why she can do what she does.</p>
<p>What lessons do you draw from other families in history?</p>
<p>So for me personally, one that&rsquo;s touched my family</p>
<p>and one of the great families in history is in Ukraine,</p>
<p>Holodomor in the 30s.</p>
<p>32, 33, right?</p>
<p>32, 33 with Stalin.</p>
<p>Maybe you could speak to the universals of the suffering here.</p>
<p>What lessons do you draw from those other famines</p>
<p>if you looked at them or in general about famine</p>
<p>that are manufactured by the decisions of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, authoritarian leaders?</p>
<p>Well, famine doesn&rsquo;t have to exist</p>
<p>or the bulk of famines on this planet,</p>
<p>I believe don&rsquo;t have to exist.</p>
<p>And most of them, or at least a good number of them</p>
<p>are manufactured by the leaders</p>
<p>that choose to use famine as a weapon, right?</p>
<p>And Ukraine is one of the obvious examples right now,</p>
<p>with siege tactics that are happening</p>
<p>in different parts of the country.</p>
<p>And we built international humanitarian law for a reason,</p>
<p>many years ago, and it continues to be written to this day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s there to prevent</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there to prevent what&rsquo;s been happening in Yemen</p>
<p>for seven years.</p>
<p>And yet there hasn&rsquo;t been any teeth behind it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what disturbs me is that we can see</p>
<p>how these famines are being used as weapons in war.</p>
<p>And yet we aren&rsquo;t sort of using the levers of power</p>
<p>that exist in order to, I think, to call out</p>
<p>in important and powerful ways those who are causing them</p>
<p>and to make sure that we hold them accountable</p>
<p>on the global stage.</p>
<p>Now, to some extent, that seems to be happening in Ukraine</p>
<p>in a way that hasn&rsquo;t happened for a long time.</p>
<p>And that gives me hope, right?</p>
<p>And yet I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve done enough.</p>
<p>And I think the national community needs to do far more</p>
<p>than we are both in Yemen, in Ethiopia,</p>
<p>and in Ukraine right now.</p>
<p>There are certain kinds of things that captivate</p>
<p>the global attention, and it seems like starvation</p>
<p>is not always one of them.</p>
<p>For some reason, murder and destruction</p>
<p>gets people&rsquo;s attention more.</p>
<p>The death, of course, is easy to enumerate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the suffering that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you know, when we went to film Hunger Ward,</p>
<p>that was one of the creative questions</p>
<p>that I was really concerned about because starvation,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not a quick action, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long, slow, insidious process, right?</p>
<p>Just like hunger, right?</p>
<p>And yet when you&rsquo;re hungry, right, it takes you over.</p>
<p>It becomes the most important thing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just absolutely fundamental to life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like drawing breath.</p>
<p>And so I really, before I filmed Hunger Ward,</p>
<p>I struggled to sort of answer</p>
<p>how we could creatively approach that</p>
<p>because, you know, someone&rsquo;s sitting in a clinic, right?</p>
<p>Starving or being treated for starvation, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pretty static scene, right?</p>
<p>And what we found was that because of the volume of cases</p>
<p>and because of the nature of sort of how quickly</p>
<p>how quickly people were coming and going</p>
<p>is that it was more dynamic than we anticipated.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something also about starvation.</p>
<p>You get tired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s a quiet suffering.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, there&rsquo;s something about</p>
<p>when I think about dark times,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ll hear me chuckle, for example.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like, it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>you have to kind of laugh at,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t help but laugh at like the injustice</p>
<p>and the cruelty in the world.</p>
<p>Somehow that helps your mind deal with it.</p>
<p>I mean, I see this all the time.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re struggling, you can&rsquo;t feed your family.</p>
<p>You lost your home.</p>
<p>The last thing you have is jokes about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humor.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s humor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, ah, the fucking man fucked me over again.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s jokes all around that.</p>
<p>And then you laugh and you drink vodka and you play music.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gallows humor, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of, I think, simultaneously acknowledging</p>
<p>and allowing yourself to move forward, right?</p>
<p>Beyond the pain and the suffering.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Ukraine and you mentioned Putin.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about the humanitarian crisis</p>
<p>and generally the suffering that&rsquo;s resulting</p>
<p>from the war in Ukraine?</p>
<p>Well, first off, I think the conflict</p>
<p>is just gonna exacerbate, you know,</p>
<p>sort of the global challenge we have with displacement.</p>
<p>The last entire trilogy I did was about displacement</p>
<p>to great extent due to war.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is a huge displacement of human beings</p>
<p>regardless of the cause.</p>
<p>And that is gonna sort of have a ripple effect</p>
<p>across the globe for many, many years to come</p>
<p>regardless of even if the conflict ended today.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna set up a whole nother strain</p>
<p>on sort of the global sort of resources</p>
<p>that come into play to deal with refugees.</p>
<p>You know, there were 79 million displaced people</p>
<p>on this globe prior to the Ukrainian conflict, right?</p>
<p>You probably know the numbers better than I do</p>
<p>in terms of what the current estimates are</p>
<p>for displacement from Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s four to six million.</p>
<p>So what are we up to now?</p>
<p>73, 74 million individuals on this planet now</p>
<p>who are displaced?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a significant bump.</p>
<p>I wish that the levers of power were used differently</p>
<p>in situations like Ukraine and Syria, for example.</p>
<p>So what are the levers of power?</p>
<p>Well, military might.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take that for one, right?</p>
<p>So I have always felt after working in Syria and Turkey</p>
<p>that we completely missed our opportunity</p>
<p>as a player on the global stage with military capability</p>
<p>to prevent the killing of hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of civilians in Syria.</p>
<p>We had the ability and we didn&rsquo;t leverage that ability.</p>
<p>You know, the fact that I talked with so many Syrians</p>
<p>during the course of doing that project</p>
<p>who told me their stories of living in their house, right?</p>
<p>And having a Syrian helicopter fly over their house</p>
<p>and drop a 55 gallon drum full of explosives</p>
<p>and shrapnel in their neighborhood</p>
<p>over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Not focused on any military targets,</p>
<p>only meant to kill and sow fear, right?</p>
<p>And early in the conflict, we could have stopped that.</p>
<p>Before Russia got involved, we could have intervened</p>
<p>and created a no fly zone.</p>
<p>That we, the United States or coalition</p>
<p>that we were a part of, yeah.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t do it and we could have.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an example where we have</p>
<p>the military capability to actually do good</p>
<p>in a situation like that.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t usually use it for those purposes.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what a military ought to be used for</p>
<p>beyond just defending our borders is to save others</p>
<p>with the privilege that that power affords.</p>
<p>What do you think about the power of the military</p>
<p>versus the power of sanctions</p>
<p>versus the power of conversation?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all different tools, right?</p>
<p>To be used at different moments.</p>
<p>But if words fail, if sanctions fail, right?</p>
<p>I think there are moments in history</p>
<p>where power is justified, right?</p>
<p>And I think Syria was one of them.</p>
<p>I think when barrel bombs were dropping</p>
<p>on civilian neighborhoods for months and months and months</p>
<p>with no intent to do anything</p>
<p>other than kill Syrian civilians,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an instance I think where might is justified</p>
<p>to shoot those helicopters out of the sky.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the difficult thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about Yemen.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the line between good and evil</p>
<p>for US intervention in different countries</p>
<p>and conflicts in the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to look back 10, 20, 30 years</p>
<p>to know what was and wasn&rsquo;t a quote unquote just war.</p>
<p>In the moment, how do we know?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to answer that, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why leaders make the wrong choices</p>
<p>so often, right?</p>
<p>Is they second guess themselves.</p>
<p>I think you take all the data at your fingertips,</p>
<p>all the intelligence that you have, right?</p>
<p>And you look at it all very carefully</p>
<p>and you make a decision, right?</p>
<p>There are some instances though</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very clear what&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>And leaders still don&rsquo;t act, right?</p>
<p>In Yemen right now, for example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear what&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>Children are being starved because of a blockade.</p>
<p>All the US would have to do is ensure that blockade,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s a two month ceasefire in place now,</p>
<p>but remains lifted beyond the ceasefire</p>
<p>and children will stop starving.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>You can trace, it&rsquo;s a direct connection.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t had the sort of the moral wherewithal</p>
<p>to make that decision because we&rsquo;re too interested</p>
<p>in maintaining positive ties with Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>where oil flows from and so much influence</p>
<p>because Saudi Arabia has so much influence</p>
<p>throughout the MENA region.</p>
<p>We want to keep that relationship tight</p>
<p>despite sort of the moral wounds that come from that.</p>
<p>About half the world is under authoritarian regimes</p>
<p>and everybody operates under narratives.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a narrative in the United States</p>
<p>that freedom is good, democracy is good.</p>
<p>I have fallen victim to this narrative.</p>
<p>I believe in it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying this jokingly, but not really</p>
<p>because who knows the truth of anything in this world?</p>
<p>I eat meat, factory farm meat,</p>
<p>and I seem to not be intellectually</p>
<p>and philosophically tortured by this, and I should be.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of suffering there.</p>
<p>What do we do to lessen the suffering</p>
<p>of the people under authoritarian regimes?</p>
<p>Again, the same question.</p>
<p>Military conflict, diplomacy, sanctions,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Does that lessen suffering or increase the suffering</p>
<p>for what you see in Yemen?</p>
<p>Is it something that has to be healed across generations</p>
<p>or can be healed on a scale of months and years?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a guy with a camera, Alex, you know?</p>
<p>But as a guy with a camera,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of things in a lot of places</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen the effects these decisions made</p>
<p>by authoritarian leaders have on their own citizens.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what drives my thinking on this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what drives and motivates me each day</p>
<p>to raise the red flag through my films</p>
<p>and say, listen, Biden,</p>
<p>you campaigned for president in part on a platform</p>
<p>that said that we would regain our prominence</p>
<p>on the moral stage of the world</p>
<p>and that we would prioritize sort of a moral paradigm</p>
<p>over relationships with authoritarian regimes,</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia being one.</p>
<p>And yet when the CIA report came out</p>
<p>that clearly articulated in detail</p>
<p>that MBS was responsible for Khashoggi&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>and for cutting his body into pieces</p>
<p>and probably burning it in the backyard of the embassy,</p>
<p>what did Biden do?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t really make a pariah out of MBS</p>
<p>like he said he was going to, right?</p>
<p>What if he&rsquo;d done something else</p>
<p>and actually done what he said he was gonna do,</p>
<p>which was make MBS?</p>
<p>What if he had removed the ability for MBS</p>
<p>to fly to the United States, for example?</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a sanction, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sanction that&rsquo;s individual and concrete</p>
<p>and would be hugely embarrassing for MBS.</p>
<p>That would have been Biden saying,</p>
<p>this is unacceptable behavior, right?</p>
<p>This is something which because you executed</p>
<p>such a horrendous act on someone living in the United States,</p>
<p>we are not going to give you a stage here at least, right?</p>
<p>Within the borders of our country.</p>
<p>Those are the things that leaders can do</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think they do often enough.</p>
<p>And certainly our leader right now isn&rsquo;t doing it</p>
<p>in the way I wish he were.</p>
<p>He certainly has taken a different stand on Ukraine</p>
<p>and been very vocal.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many instances we could talk about</p>
<p>where I feel like the political game and ship, right?</p>
<p>Often falls into maintaining relationships</p>
<p>like with MBS and Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>rather than doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Rather than as a nation, a leader of a nation saying,</p>
<p>this is unacceptable.</p>
<p>We have a higher standard than this.</p>
<p>Cause I think when leaders do that,</p>
<p>it becomes aspirational, right?</p>
<p>It becomes aspirational for other leaders</p>
<p>in the progressive world at least.</p>
<p>And also it rings the alarm bells</p>
<p>for other authoritarian leaders and says,</p>
<p>you know what, there are lines, right?</p>
<p>There are things that can&rsquo;t be done</p>
<p>or there will be significant consequences.</p>
<p>Like you will not be able to fly into our airspace anymore.</p>
<p>And sanctions I think need to be concrete and individual</p>
<p>to some, in addition to the larger scope.</p>
<p>But when they&rsquo;re concrete and individual,</p>
<p>I think often they&rsquo;re felt in a different way.</p>
<p>You mean felt obviously by the individuals.</p>
<p>And so the ripple effects of that</p>
<p>might have the power to steer the direction of nations.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of authoritarian regimes, right?</p>
<p>Individuals have so much power.</p>
<p>Exactly, right.</p>
<p>So if Putin is put on trial in the Hague at some point,</p>
<p>or at least there&rsquo;s the threat of that, right?</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s likely never to happen of course</p>
<p>because someone has to be in custody to go on trial, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s never gonna allow that to happen.</p>
<p>But just knowing that that danger exists</p>
<p>is going to change his travel plans in the future, right?</p>
<p>MBS not being able to fly to the US,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna feel that and be embarrassed by that.</p>
<p>So I think they have a special meaning and consequence</p>
<p>in authoritarian regimes because of that.</p>
<p>So you said you&rsquo;re just a guy with a camera.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would say you&rsquo;re a brilliant guy with a camera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a kind of guy with a camera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a guy with a couple cameras.</p>
<p>A couple cameras.</p>
<p>I have more.</p>
<p>A couple mics too.</p>
<p>You got a couple mics, a couple cameras, robot over here.</p>
<p>When you can&rsquo;t beat them with quality,</p>
<p>you bring the quantity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So to me, that&rsquo;s also an interest partially</p>
<p>because I also speak Russian and a bit Ukrainian.</p>
<p>I wanna study that part of the world.</p>
<p>I wanna talk to a lot of people.</p>
<p>I wanna talk to the leaders.</p>
<p>I wanna talk to regular people.</p>
<p>To be honest, and I would love to get your comments on this,</p>
<p>the regular quote unquote people</p>
<p>are way more fascinating to me.</p>
<p>As a filmmaker, how do you figure out how to tell this story?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a guy with a camera,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at war in Ukraine,</p>
<p>but also what&rsquo;s going on in Yemen and Syria</p>
<p>and other places in the world.</p>
<p>I mentioned North Korea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a super interesting one.</p>
<p>Hard to bring cameras along.</p>
<p>China, in Canada, the truckers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of fascinating things</p>
<p>happening in the world.</p>
<p>So you as a scholar of human suffering</p>
<p>and human flourishing,</p>
<p>how do you choose how to tell the story?</p>
<p>How do I choose a story?</p>
<p>How do I choose how to tell a story?</p>
<p>Both a story and how, I assume those are coupled.</p>
<p>So how do you choose which story to tell?</p>
<p>And how do you choose how to tell that story?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of how to choose which story,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit of a mystery potion for me, frankly.</p>
<p>I go often on instinct,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a highly intentional piece of it</p>
<p>for me as well.</p>
<p>And the intentional piece is,</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;d call it the do I care threshold,</p>
<p>or the so what threshold.</p>
<p>You personally, just something in your heart</p>
<p>just kind of gets excited or hurts or just feels something.</p>
<p>So one of the things that disturbs me</p>
<p>about American culture, Lex,</p>
<p>is that we seem to be a people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinated by reality television, for example.</p>
<p>Like look at how many of us here in America</p>
<p>watch reality television, right?</p>
<p>That deeply disturbs me.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;ve never watched an episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve shot a whole season of it once to make a living, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like I know it, right?</p>
<p>But I feel like the things we should be paying attention to</p>
<p>are the things, personally,</p>
<p>are the things I choose to film, right?</p>
<p>As a human being, as a dad, as a filmmaker,</p>
<p>I think we should be paying attention</p>
<p>to the fact that children are being starved in Yemen.</p>
<p>I think we should be paying attention</p>
<p>to the fact that Ukrainians are being displaced</p>
<p>by the millions.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this so what threshold that I use.</p>
<p>And I feel like it has to be a topic</p>
<p>that if we don&rsquo;t cover and we don&rsquo;t put out in the world</p>
<p>in the largest possible way,</p>
<p>in the hope of intervening,</p>
<p>in the hope of marshaling maximum resources</p>
<p>and attention to solving the problem,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m dedicated to as a filmmaker.</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t pick up a camera initially</p>
<p>to film puppy dogs, right?</p>
<p>To make people smile.</p>
<p>I believe the camera is a tool for change.</p>
<p>I believe the camera is a powerful tool</p>
<p>that we can use to raise awareness and marshal resources</p>
<p>and help people understand the impact</p>
<p>that these geopolitical decisions have</p>
<p>on real people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the intent I create each film with.</p>
<p>Now, how I choose each story,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the magic potion piece of it, right?</p>
<p>And often one flows rather organically</p>
<p>into another, frankly.</p>
<p>So you just kind of, like you said,</p>
<p>you go with instinct a little bit.</p>
<p>To some extent, but oftentimes I choose the next project</p>
<p>based on relationships I&rsquo;ve developed in the last film.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And so one often flows into another</p>
<p>through relationships I develop.</p>
<p>And then a colleague will share a detail</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s happening in a certain place.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll go, hmm, really, I didn&rsquo;t know that, right?</p>
<p>And usually it&rsquo;s before it&rsquo;s hit the world stage</p>
<p>in a big way.</p>
<p>And so I start to do due diligence.</p>
<p>And often that, it reveals it to be a much bigger</p>
<p>and more pressing topic that I wanna learn more about.</p>
<p>Before I talk to you about Syria and Lifeboat,</p>
<p>you mentioned a camera is the best weapon.</p>
<p>Maybe just, well, I can&rsquo;t take out a tank, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a good weapon.</p>
<p>Second, top three.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love the humor throughout this.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>We were talking about such dark topics.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It resets the mind in a way that allows me to think.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>As a filmmaker, I almost wanna talk</p>
<p>about the technical details.</p>
<p>Uh oh.</p>
<p>How do you choose to shoot stuff?</p>
<p>Again, so maybe you can explain to me.</p>
<p>I work with incredible folks that care about lenses</p>
<p>and equipment and so on.</p>
<p>And I tend to be somebody that just wants to kinda go</p>
<p>as like a gorilla shooting, like not plan too much,</p>
<p>just go with gritty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to come up with words that sound positive.</p>
<p>Do a positive spin on what I try to do.</p>
<p>But like gritty, don&rsquo;t over plan, use,</p>
<p>like we had a big discussion if you see this light.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on a stand that&rsquo;s a very ghetto stand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You need a sandbag on that, man.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So no sandbag and like the stand is actually bending</p>
<p>under the weight of that thing.</p>
<p>It could fall on us.</p>
<p>It could fall.</p>
<p>It probably won&rsquo;t reach us, but it could fall.</p>
<p>But the danger, live under that danger.</p>
<p>Embrace that danger.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because that thing is easier to transport</p>
<p>than a heavier one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sandbag, that&rsquo;s extra weight.</p>
<p>So if you keep, like people tell me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the right way to do stuff.</p>
<p>Like here&rsquo;s these giant cases with all the kinds of padding</p>
<p>for transporting stuff.</p>
<p>I transport most of the equipment in a garbage bag.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just a preference because that&rsquo;s somehow</p>
<p>that chaos allows me to ignore all the stupidity</p>
<p>of loving the equipment and focusing on the story.</p>
<p>So that said, I&rsquo;ve never shot anything like worthwhile.</p>
<p>Like there is power to the visual.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like definitely.</p>
<p>And so finding a certain angle, a certain light</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s natural light or additional artificial lighting</p>
<p>just capturing a tear, capturing when the person forgets</p>
<p>themselves for a moment and looks out into the distance</p>
<p>missing somebody, thinking about somebody.</p>
<p>All of those like moments you can capture a lens,</p>
<p>a camera can do magic with that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know the question I&rsquo;m asking you</p>
<p>but how do both technical and philosophical,</p>
<p>how do you capture the visual power that you&rsquo;re after?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, so many of my films I think are built</p>
<p>on the premise of access, right?</p>
<p>Built on this notion that the biggest hurdle</p>
<p>to the story is getting there, being there in the room</p>
<p>or being there on the boat while a crisis is unfolding.</p>
<p>And that access typically is really nuanced</p>
<p>and difficult to gain.</p>
<p>And then trust flows from that, right?</p>
<p>Cause usually it takes a long time to gain that access</p>
<p>because that access is so hard fought.</p>
<p>It necessarily informs how we film, right?</p>
<p>To be in a room at Sadaka Hospital in Southern Yemen</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t have five people in that room, right?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t have a boom mic over a scene.</p>
<p>I want in creatively the opposite of that as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just a logistical question,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a creative question to capture intimate moments</p>
<p>where families are dealing with suffering children</p>
<p>and dying children and caretaking is active</p>
<p>and ongoing all the time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to interrupt that moment.</p>
<p>And so that informs how I do things.</p>
<p>So we go fleet and nimble and small.</p>
<p>Those are all really good words.</p>
<p>But so it&rsquo;s logistical on the one hand,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a creative choice, right?</p>
<p>So when we filmed Hunger Ward,</p>
<p>two people were filming the entire film, right?</p>
<p>Me and my director of photography.</p>
<p>That was the two people in the room?</p>
<p>Two people in the room.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>The whole film, right?</p>
<p>We had a field producer as well in this part of the country,</p>
<p>but in terms of camera, it&rsquo;s just two people</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing everything.</p>
<p>And we have lenses that are long enough</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have to move to camera.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to move to capture the film.</p>
<p>So we can tuck into a corner sometimes, right?</p>
<p>And so just what&rsquo;s long mean?</p>
<p>That means they&rsquo;re standing farther away</p>
<p>and they can look.</p>
<p>Zoom lens, it&rsquo;s not a prime lens.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a fixed focal length, right?</p>
<p>Because a fixed focal length,</p>
<p>you have to move a lot more in order to capture action.</p>
<p>With a zoom lens, maybe a 105 at the long end,</p>
<p>I can tuck into a corner and just film from 15 feet away</p>
<p>instead of having to get right up on someone, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re less likely to interrupt the scene</p>
<p>and you can kind of become the fly on the wall sometimes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very intentional about that piece of it</p>
<p>so that we can capture those vulnerable moments</p>
<p>and not interrupt them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating too, because the access,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often think about this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably true for me as well.</p>
<p>Part of the storytelling is to be in the room.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the hard part.</p>
<p>For me, most of my films, that&rsquo;s the hardest part.</p>
<p>Actually, as hard as Hunger Ward and Lifeboat were to film</p>
<p>and 50 Feet From Syria,</p>
<p>the getting there piece of it for the last two</p>
<p>was much harder.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s a creative act.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know if it is for you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the kind of people you talk to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how you live your life.</p>
<p>Like the kind of people I talk to right now,</p>
<p>they steer the direction of my life</p>
<p>and steer the direction of things I&rsquo;ll film.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like you&rsquo;re trying to get access.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>It builds, it builds and builds and builds and builds.</p>
<p>It builds on itself, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, part of the thing, even saying,</p>
<p>talking about some of these leaders</p>
<p>and conversations with them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like steering your life</p>
<p>into the direction of the difficult,</p>
<p>of like taking the leap.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a good human being</p>
<p>and a lot of people know who you are as a human,</p>
<p>like not as a name, but as really who you are,</p>
<p>that like putting that attention out there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somehow the world opens doors</p>
<p>where the access becomes,</p>
<p>the access that once seemed impossible becomes possible.</p>
<p>And then all of that is a creative journey</p>
<p>to be in the room.</p>
<p>I think that probably is,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true even for fiction films probably,</p>
<p>is like everything that led to that,</p>
<p>like to be in the room, the journey to be in the room</p>
<p>and to shoot the scene is maybe more important</p>
<p>than the scene itself.</p>
<p>And like really focus on the creative act of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>And especially, I mean, with a documentary,</p>
<p>you get one take.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t say, hey, reset, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Ah, that is so interesting.</p>
<p>As you were in some of the most difficult parts of the world</p>
<p>in the room with some of the most difficult stories</p>
<p>to be told.</p>
<p>And yet, I think that&rsquo;s why I keep doing these stories.</p>
<p>Because once you have that lived experience for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>It moves me to bear witness</p>
<p>to these inspiring people under difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t come back to the US afterwards</p>
<p>and walk down the grocery aisle</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s 50 different choices for canned peas, right?</p>
<p>And not sort of feel that lived tension, right?</p>
<p>That lived tension of the privilege</p>
<p>that I have here in the US.</p>
<p>And then I have a choice about what to do</p>
<p>with that privilege, right?</p>
<p>And the last thing I wanna do is start</p>
<p>doing stories about dandelions, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s far more important things to do</p>
<p>on this very limited time that I have on the planet.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s catalytic for me.</p>
<p>Like I feel that mortality each day.</p>
<p>And my goal is to tell as many of these stories</p>
<p>before I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
<p>Could you speak to the getting access?</p>
<p>Is this just, you know, is there interesting stories</p>
<p>of how a weird or funny or profound ways</p>
<p>that led you to get access to a room?</p>
<p>Each one is a different adventure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s definitely an adventure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an adventure.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s an adventure, yeah.</p>
<p>Probably one of the easiest ones I ever had</p>
<p>in the recent past was for 50 Feet from Syria</p>
<p>where I literally broke my hand in a bicycle race.</p>
<p>And after many months of trying to get an appointment</p>
<p>with an orthopedic hand surgeon, a specialist,</p>
<p>I finally did and he was Syrian American.</p>
<p>And the Syrian conflict had just begun</p>
<p>and we just started talking about it.</p>
<p>And after he looked at my hand in the first five minutes,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, yeah, you need surgery, great.</p>
<p>But then somehow we started talking about Syria</p>
<p>and like five minutes in, he just stood up</p>
<p>and like put the privacy curtain around us,</p>
<p>supposed to be a 15 minute appointment or so.</p>
<p>And we talked for an hour, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, those moments</p>
<p>of sort of mysterious confluence happen, right?</p>
<p>And I think you have to be open to them when they do happen</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a storyteller, I&rsquo;m always looking as well, right?</p>
<p>So, because he then contacted me later and said,</p>
<p>Skye, I am going back to the Syrian border to volunteer</p>
<p>as a surgeon, do you want to come with me?</p>
<p>That was an easy one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the easiest one I could give you.</p>
<p>But it came out of this interesting moment,</p>
<p>very personal moment, right?</p>
<p>Lifeboat and Hunger Ward are completely different.</p>
<p>And I had to really work hard to gain access</p>
<p>to those stories.</p>
<p>So you intentionally thought like what,</p>
<p>I want to get access to the story.</p>
<p>And then what are the different ideas?</p>
<p>And they often might involve a doctor or a dentist</p>
<p>or just being maybe intentionally and aggressively open</p>
<p>to experiences that lead you into the room.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny you mentioned the doctor</p>
<p>because I have similar experiences now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just gotten access to all kinds of fascinating people</p>
<p>in the same way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all around us.</p>
<p>You just have to look.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s fascinating people everywhere</p>
<p>who are doing incredible things,</p>
<p>but we have to be open and keep our eyes open</p>
<p>and realize that there are amazing human beings everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s networks that connect people</p>
<p>just through life.</p>
<p>You meet people, you share a beer or a drink</p>
<p>or just you fall in love</p>
<p>or you share trauma together.</p>
<p>You go through a hard time together.</p>
<p>And those little sticky things connects us humans.</p>
<p>And if you just keep yourself open</p>
<p>and embrace the curiosity.</p>
<p>And then also the persistence, I suppose.</p>
<p>Like how long have you chased access?</p>
<p>Does it take days, weeks, months, years?</p>
<p>Lex, I&rsquo;m not the most talented filmmaker in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the smartest guy in the world.</p>
<p>I think if there&rsquo;s qualities</p>
<p>that have served me well in my career,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s persistence and tenacity, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been sort of a slow burn human being.</p>
<p>Like I would never hit a home run,</p>
<p>but I hit a first, right?</p>
<p>A single to first,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d hit another single to first.</p>
<p>So I ran a marathon when I was 18.</p>
<p>And I think that is illustrative</p>
<p>of sort of how my career has been.</p>
<p>I just keep going.</p>
<p>And I believe in this notion of incremental evolution</p>
<p>that with each project, I try to learn from it</p>
<p>and take away lessons learned and improve my craft, right?</p>
<p>And improve how I leverage that craft</p>
<p>and improve how I tell the story</p>
<p>from a narrative standpoint each time.</p>
<p>So that on the next project, it&rsquo;s a little bit better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the arc of my career</p>
<p>is learning, learning, evolving, evolving,</p>
<p>so that I can make a little better film the next time.</p>
<p>How do you gain people&rsquo;s trust?</p>
<p>Like for example, there&rsquo;s a line between journalists</p>
<p>and documentary filmmakers.</p>
<p>Nobody really trusts journalists.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, exactly.</p>
<p>But a documentary filmmaker,</p>
<p>of course I&rsquo;m joking, half joking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which percentage joking, but some truth.</p>
<p>But documentary filmmaker is a kind of storyteller,</p>
<p>an artist, and somehow that&rsquo;s more trustworthy</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re on the same side in some way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe on the same side, yeah.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said</p>
<p>how you gain the trust of people to gain access?</p>
<p>Are you just trying to be a good human being?</p>
<p>Is there something to be said there?</p>
<p>Well, so I do draw a distinction</p>
<p>between journalism and filmmaking</p>
<p>because I think you&rsquo;re right, they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>And there are some filmmakers who do hue</p>
<p>to sort of the journalistic tenets</p>
<p>of who, what, where, when, why,</p>
<p>fair and balanced on both sides, right?</p>
<p>Make sure everyone has a voice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you say fair and balanced,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re rarely either fair or balanced.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that with journalists.</p>
<p>Journalists often, unfortunately, in my perspective,</p>
<p>sorry to interrupt you rudely and go on a rant,</p>
<p>but they seem to have. Go on a rant, do it.</p>
<p>They seem to have an agenda.</p>
<p>As opposed to seeking to truly tell a story</p>
<p>or to truly understand,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re talking to people</p>
<p>who have some degree of evil in them.</p>
<p>Well, we all have an agenda, right?</p>
<p>I think in anything we do,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s like to seek truth</p>
<p>or some larger principle,</p>
<p>I always have an agenda.</p>
<p>I chose to work with civilians and caretakers in Yemen</p>
<p>on Hunger Ward rather than to go interview MBS, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m interested in</p>
<p>is bringing that to the world, right?</p>
<p>But in terms of building relationships and trust,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really, I think about transparency</p>
<p>as much as anything else</p>
<p>and going in in a collaborative sense.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think of the people</p>
<p>that I film with as subjects, for example.</p>
<p>I think of them as collaborators.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different mindset that I go into projects with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s based on relationships, right?</p>
<p>You have to build relationships with other human beings,</p>
<p>however you can, and that takes time</p>
<p>and it takes listening and it&rsquo;s active.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked about the notion of consent before,</p>
<p>which is so important in nonfiction film.</p>
<p>And I hew to this idea that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t just slide a piece of paper in front of someone,</p>
<p>have release form and have them sign it, right?</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the nature of true consent in my mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you have to work on a foundation of active consent</p>
<p>every single day that you&rsquo;re working with someone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s based on relationship, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s based on dialogue.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s trust that I&rsquo;m always aiming for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the building of relationships,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m always aiming for,</p>
<p>which is why yesterday I got a bunch of photos</p>
<p>from Dr. Al Sadiq in the South of Yemen.</p>
<p>And she sends me photos all the time</p>
<p>of the children that she&rsquo;s currently treating</p>
<p>because we have an active relationship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s continues on and probably will</p>
<p>for many years to come.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to continue.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only way that I can do these kinds of films.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about silly little details of filming.</p>
<p>Before we go to the big picture stories,</p>
<p>cameras, lenses, how much do those matter?</p>
<p>You mentioned director of photography.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your, how much do you love the feel,</p>
<p>the smell of equipment that does the visual filming?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some people, they&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>ah, they love lenses.</p>
<p>How much do you love that or versus how much</p>
<p>do you focus on the story or the access</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a tech geek, but because during the bulk</p>
<p>of my career, I&rsquo;ve worked as a director of photography</p>
<p>myself for other people in order to pay the bills</p>
<p>over the years, you know, I know the technical side of it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve had to know it and I&rsquo;ve had to train myself</p>
<p>and learn it.</p>
<p>So I see them as necessary tools.</p>
<p>And again, because I believe, you know,</p>
<p>film and cinema is and should be visually driven</p>
<p>and not verbally driven.</p>
<p>I want the best tools possible within my means, right?</p>
<p>And within the logistical ability of the project</p>
<p>because we have to go so small, right?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t afford nor can I bring a huge $100,000 lens.</p>
<p>So if I gave you a trillion dollars.</p>
<p>A trillion dollars?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Unlimited.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still huge constraints that have nothing</p>
<p>to do with money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you just said.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what cameras would you use?</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;d do with a trillion dollars?</p>
<p>I could do a lot with a trillion dollars.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only allowed to fund the film and no corrupt stuff</p>
<p>where you like use the film to actually help children.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not allowed to do any of that.</p>
<p>What I would do with a trillion is I wouldn&rsquo;t invest in it.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I would invest in current.</p>
<p>I would increase capacity to do more films.</p>
<p>What I would do.</p>
<p>So I would buy basically the perfect little,</p>
<p>you know, mini equipment set, right?</p>
<p>But then I would train three teams maybe</p>
<p>to do the same thing that I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>so we could multiply and scale up.</p>
<p>More and more stories.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I would do with the money.</p>
<p>But the actual setup.</p>
<p>Would remain small and nimble.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what about lighting?</p>
<p>Do you usually use natural light?</p>
<p>Do you ever do?</p>
<p>I mean, sorry for the technical questions here,</p>
<p>but highlighting the drama of the human face.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the visual.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, to reveal reality at its deepest is art.</p>
<p>And do you use lighting?</p>
<p>Lighting&rsquo;s such a big part of that.</p>
<p>Do you ever do artificial lighting?</p>
<p>Do you try to do natural always?</p>
<p>You know the best lighting instrument in the world?</p>
<p>Is the sun.</p>
<p>At the right moment of the day.</p>
<p>And so I predominantly use natural light</p>
<p>at certain moments and just shape natural light</p>
<p>during the course of these small human rights stocks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say we don&rsquo;t bring instruments sometimes,</p>
<p>but when we do, they&rsquo;re very small and again, compact.</p>
<p>So for example, I have this small little tube kit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just three instruments, right?</p>
<p>That you can charge with USB.</p>
<p>Because electricity is often a major issue where we go.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just three little tube lights with magnetic backs</p>
<p>that if we find in a situation where, you know,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t get enough exposure for a hallway or something,</p>
<p>and we have the time to throw it up,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll throw it up if people are walking,</p>
<p>if collaborators are walking down that hallway a lot,</p>
<p>for example, at night, just so we can see them, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s instances like that.</p>
<p>Or if we do do an interview, which we don&rsquo;t do very often,</p>
<p>but if we do, just so we have a key light on the face, right?</p>
<p>And always bring a reflector or two, you know,</p>
<p>just to shape natural light as well in ways.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s about shaping rather than producing light for us.</p>
<p>Got it, as we sit surrounded by black curtains</p>
<p>in complete natural light.</p>
<p>So just so you know, this room is like a violation</p>
<p>of the basic principles of using the sun.</p>
<p>So behind the large curtains are giant windows.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this whole.</p>
<p>Should I rip them open?</p>
<p>Should I rip open the curtains real quick?</p>
<p>How much of the work is done in the edit?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another question I&rsquo;m curious about.</p>
<p>And how much do you sort of anticipate that?</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re actually shooting,</p>
<p>are you thinking of the final story as it appears on screen</p>
<p>or are you just collecting, as a human,</p>
<p>collecting little bits of story here and there</p>
<p>and in the edit is where most of the storytelling happens?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve developed this sort of mental paradigm</p>
<p>for myself over the years that speaks to that.</p>
<p>And I call it the three creations, right?</p>
<p>And so when I&rsquo;m doing a film, the first creation for me</p>
<p>is my preconception or visualization</p>
<p>of what the film is going to be before I shoot it, right?</p>
<p>So I have this entire vision of what a film&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>And sometimes it can be pretty specific.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll think through the scenes</p>
<p>if I know the locations and everything,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll have this idea of what I&rsquo;m gonna create, right?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m there filming, right?</p>
<p>And always without fail, reality is something</p>
<p>altogether different than what I thought it would be.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still good to have the original idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but if I tried to hold to that original vision,</p>
<p>right, and to create a film out of that idea,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be crap, all the films would be crap.</p>
<p>So I have to adapt, I have to evolve my approach</p>
<p>and then embrace what is actually occurring</p>
<p>with the people actually doing it and then reenvision.</p>
<p>So that reenvision is very active</p>
<p>during the entire filming process.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the second creation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the rethinking and revisualizing</p>
<p>based on what we&rsquo;re actually experiencing and seeing</p>
<p>what this film is going to be.</p>
<p>And then I finished filming, right?</p>
<p>And we bring the hard drives back</p>
<p>and we plug in the hard drives in the edit bay.</p>
<p>And oftentimes, because it&rsquo;s two of us filming</p>
<p>most of the time, I haven&rsquo;t seen all the footage.</p>
<p>Because in the field, it&rsquo;s all about just filming, right?</p>
<p>And then just transferring the footage</p>
<p>and getting on safely, you know, clone to multiple drives.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a chance to review everything.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do rushes like you do on a large feature.</p>
<p>So because I&rsquo;m filming half of it,</p>
<p>I know what I&rsquo;ve filmed, right?</p>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t seen everything</p>
<p>the director of photography has filmed, right?</p>
<p>So the next stage for me is reviewing every single frame</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s been filmed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where discovery happens the third time, right?</p>
<p>Or the second time rather is,</p>
<p>wow, now I thought we&rsquo;d filmed this,</p>
<p>but actually there&rsquo;s this over here.</p>
<p>And then I have to open up this second vision</p>
<p>and turn it and transform it into a third vision</p>
<p>for the film based on what&rsquo;s actually on the hard drive.</p>
<p>So is this like a daily process?</p>
<p>So what I do, my process is that</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a really difficult project,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take a break before I go through this</p>
<p>just for healing, you know,</p>
<p>and some space away and fresh eyes.</p>
<p>And usually that&rsquo;s about a month.</p>
<p>And then once I reengage, I reengage whole hog,</p>
<p>I reengage fully and I review every single frame.</p>
<p>And as I do that, I create a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>And for Hunger War, that spreadsheet was,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 1500 lines long or something</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s basically log notes.</p>
<p>And I watch every scene and I take notes</p>
<p>and I know really what we have.</p>
<p>And once I&rsquo;ve gone through that process</p>
<p>that takes about a month</p>
<p>and I really know what we came back with,</p>
<p>I create an outline for the film from that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the third visioning, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually completely different</p>
<p>than my original vision for the film to some extent, right?</p>
<p>But I have to stay open to that entire process</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;d be trying to create something</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t really create.</p>
<p>So I think those are the three creations for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cool to know what we have,</p>
<p>just to lay it all out and to load it in into your mind.</p>
<p>Cause like, this is the capture of reality we have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very kind of scientific process too.</p>
<p>Cause you know, in science,</p>
<p>you collect a bunch of data about a phenomena</p>
<p>and now you have to like analyze that data,</p>
<p>but now your phenomena is long gone.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>Now you just have the data.</p>
<p>Just the data and you have to write a paper about it,</p>
<p>like analyze the data, it&rsquo;s similar things.</p>
<p>You have to like load it all in.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the story?</p>
<p>How do you, that last probably profound piece</p>
<p>of doing the editing, like in your mind,</p>
<p>like how to lay those things out?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s almost like the scientific process, right?</p>
<p>I have a hypothesis, a creative hypothesis, right?</p>
<p>Not a scientific one.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;m testing the hypothesis</p>
<p>during the course of filming, right?</p>
<p>And I have to stay true to what the data tells me</p>
<p>in the end creatively.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very similar to the scientific processes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what we should, we should probably coin that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Creative scientific process or something like that.</p>
<p>But then you actually do the edit and then you watch,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also iterative in a sense,</p>
<p>because maybe when you have a film,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 20, 30, 40 minutes, or if it&rsquo;s feature length,</p>
<p>like do you ever have it where it sucks?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not at all.</p>
<p>Is there a stage where it sucks?</p>
<p>Like a stage where, right, right.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s like, no, this is not,</p>
<p>this is not what I was, like when it&rsquo;s all put together</p>
<p>in this way, this doesn&rsquo;t, this is not working right.</p>
<p>This is not right.</p>
<p>Or do you, is it always like an incremental step</p>
<p>towards better and better?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incremental.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s incremental.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s always some moment in the editing process</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a breakthrough,</p>
<p>where suddenly I understand how it fits together more fully.</p>
<p>And you have to be, like you said, resilient.</p>
<p>You have to be patient that that moment will come.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Are you ultra self critical</p>
<p>or are you generally optimistic and patient?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think those are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Right, so you just oscillate</p>
<p>or are they like dance partners or something?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dance partners, yeah.</p>
<p>Definitely dancing all the way through the process.</p>
<p>By way of advice, you know, to young filmmakers,</p>
<p>how to film something that is recognized</p>
<p>by the world in some way.</p>
<p>I would say, you know, first off, learn your craft, right?</p>
<p>Because I think craft is incredibly foundational, right?</p>
<p>To creating a powerful story.</p>
<p>And sorry to interrupt, but when you say craft,</p>
<p>do you mean just the raw technical,</p>
<p>the director of photography, like the filming aspect?</p>
<p>Is it the storytelling, is it the access, the whole thing?</p>
<p>I think craft is more than just knowing</p>
<p>how to push record on a camera or what lens to use, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of it, right?</p>
<p>But I think at least in nonfiction,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m a product to some extent</p>
<p>of having to know how to do it all, right?</p>
<p>Having to teach myself how to do it all.</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t go to film school, you know?</p>
<p>But I became so enamored of telling stories through a camera.</p>
<p>What was the leap, by the way,</p>
<p>from theater to storyteller?</p>
<p>Oh, I just needed an extra class in grad school.</p>
<p>I was in a MFA directing class</p>
<p>and I needed an extra class and I just sort of like</p>
<p>talked my way into a television directing class</p>
<p>and fell in love with it.</p>
<p>And the actor became the director.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, I wasn&rsquo;t an actor,</p>
<p>but I had to act and I had to know the craft of acting</p>
<p>because I was in the theater, you know,</p>
<p>to work with actors. Did you love it, though?</p>
<p>Did you love acting? The theater?</p>
<p>Yeah, theater?</p>
<p>The first, yeah, as an undergraduate, yeah.</p>
<p>But then I learned pretty quickly</p>
<p>that I was pretty bad at it, or at least not very good,</p>
<p>and that my skills lay elsewhere</p>
<p>in more sort of behind the scenes and shaping a story.</p>
<p>When you started taking a class,</p>
<p>but also telling stories as a director,</p>
<p>did you quickly realize that you&rsquo;re pretty good at this</p>
<p>or was it a grind?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question, Max.</p>
<p>I think, I definitely knew right away</p>
<p>that it was more my wheelhouse, right?</p>
<p>And I think part of that was because</p>
<p>I grew up in sort of a world of imagination.</p>
<p>And I think that active imagination as a child</p>
<p>really lent itself well to the skillset</p>
<p>that a director needs, right?</p>
<p>To shape story, to shape narrative, to shape performances.</p>
<p>So I think it was a much more natural fit for me.</p>
<p>Was I excellent at the beginning?</p>
<p>Heck no, no, I think few people are, but I learned.</p>
<p>Where was the biggest struggle for you?</p>
<p>Is it, so your imagination clearly was something</p>
<p>that you worked on for a lifetime.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure that was pretty strong.</p>
<p>Books, came from books.</p>
<p>Books.</p>
<p>But the actual conversion of the imagination,</p>
<p>you said shape the story.</p>
<p>Where was the skill most lacking</p>
<p>in the shaping of the story initially?</p>
<p>Technical side.</p>
<p>Just technical side.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, you know,</p>
<p>cause I taught myself everything.</p>
<p>What kind of microphone should I use, right?</p>
<p>What kind of camera?</p>
<p>What does this lens do?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that lens do?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know any of that.</p>
<p>And so I essentially was,</p>
<p>I have been self taught, technically.</p>
<p>How do you get good technically,</p>
<p>would you say, when you&rsquo;re self taught?</p>
<p>Just doing it over and over again.</p>
<p>And what kind of stories were you telling?</p>
<p>I began shooting local commercials for.</p>
<p>For money?</p>
<p>For money, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing professional projects?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so I kind of learned on the job as I did it.</p>
<p>How many hobby projects did you do,</p>
<p>just for the hell of it?</p>
<p>Or were you trying to focus on the professional?</p>
<p>Well, I was trying to make money, right?</p>
<p>Right out of grad school, just to pay the rent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a forcing function to,</p>
<p>I mean, I personally love having my back to the wall</p>
<p>or financially you&rsquo;re screwed if you don&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>I mean, I lived out of the trunk of my car</p>
<p>for a couple of years after grad school,</p>
<p>just freelancing, just like,</p>
<p>but that couple of years really helped me learn fast</p>
<p>because I had to learn fast.</p>
<p>So I did a couple of voyages around the world</p>
<p>for this group called Semester at Sea,</p>
<p>that is a floating university</p>
<p>that where they go out three and a half months at a time</p>
<p>with about 500 college level students</p>
<p>and about 35 professors.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re shooting every day for three and a half months</p>
<p>in like nine different countries.</p>
<p>And so that really was like instrumental to me</p>
<p>becoming a pretty good camera person pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And you were doing most of the work yourself?</p>
<p>One man, one man band, yeah.</p>
<p>The second voyage, I at least had an editor with me.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I was shooting everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the perfect team?</p>
<p>Is it two people for nonfiction asking for a friend?</p>
<p>Some kind of interested in some storytelling,</p>
<p>not of the level and the sophistication that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but more.</p>
<p>I think you have to allow the story</p>
<p>to dictate what the size of the film should be.</p>
<p>For these small human rights docs I do,</p>
<p>I think two or three, it means you work your butt off,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing everything, right?</p>
<p>But it allows you to tell intimate stories</p>
<p>and have that access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a film this summer that&rsquo;s a scripted piece</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ll probably have 25 crew people.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a completely different endeavor altogether.</p>
<p>But doing it yourself, what do you think about that?</p>
<p>Even though you have that trillion dollars.</p>
<p>Oh, I have that trillion dollars again?</p>
<p>Sweet, you can write that check before I leave, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I will.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a check for that big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be interesting.</p>
<p>How many zeros is that?</p>
<p>I write them so often, I&rsquo;ve lost track.</p>
<p>Or the United States government sure as heck</p>
<p>writes them often.</p>
<p>Okay, anyway, I mean, is there an argument</p>
<p>can you steel man the case for a single person?</p>
<p>Not for me, not for me, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve found is that by being a team of two filming</p>
<p>with a field producer, by two people filming,</p>
<p>it allows us to double our footage first off, right?</p>
<p>So we have twice as much footage in the time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re filming to come back with as opposed</p>
<p>to one person filming.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re each manning a camera?</p>
<p>Yeah, constantly.</p>
<p>And how much, sorry to keep interrupting,</p>
<p>how much interaction and interplay there is?</p>
<p>Sometimes the director of photography is in another room</p>
<p>filming a different scene, if it makes sense.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;re cross shooting in the same room, right?</p>
<p>Just depends on the needs of the moment.</p>
<p>So we come back with double the footage is one thing.</p>
<p>But as a director, so that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>given how access is sometimes shaped by the events</p>
<p>so that we can only, something, you know,</p>
<p>in Lifeboat, for example, you know,</p>
<p>a rescue operation may only happen three days, right?</p>
<p>So you want as much footage of that as you can.</p>
<p>But the other piece of it that&rsquo;s really critical for me,</p>
<p>I found is that by having another human being</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m filming with, who I&rsquo;m co shooting with,</p>
<p>it frees me up as a director to not always</p>
<p>have to be shooting either.</p>
<p>I can do all the other work to build relationships, right?</p>
<p>To have side conversations with people,</p>
<p>to sort out the right way to tell a story, right?</p>
<p>Or to transfer footage, knowing that the director</p>
<p>of photography is still filming during all that.</p>
<p>So it frees me up to think of as a director</p>
<p>rather than just an image acquirer.</p>
<p>Yeah, cause there&rsquo;s also, I don&rsquo;t know how distracting it is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve obviously done it for years, but setting stuff up,</p>
<p>it preoccupies your mind.</p>
<p>Like pressing the record button,</p>
<p>and like framing stuff and all that,</p>
<p>that still takes up some part of your mind</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t think freely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my choice, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I work best.</p>
<p>That said, the caveat there would be</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the only way to do it, obviously, right?</p>
<p>Like one of my favorite documentaries of all time</p>
<p>is a documentary called A Woman Captured, shot in Hungary,</p>
<p>by a single filmmaker with a single camera</p>
<p>with a single lens, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s brilliant, and powerful,</p>
<p>and moving, and interventional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible filmmaking, and it was a single human being</p>
<p>who created that film with a collaborator or subject.</p>
<p>So it can be done, it&rsquo;s just not how I work best.</p>
<p>Yeah, how much personally would the other person,</p>
<p>how important is the relationship with them</p>
<p>outside of the filming?</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>With the director of photography?</p>
<p>The director of photography, say.</p>
<p>Like, how much drinking, and if you don&rsquo;t drink,</p>
<p>whatever the equivalent of that is,</p>
<p>do you have to do together?</p>
<p>How much soul searching?</p>
<p>Or is it more like two surgeons getting together?</p>
<p>Is it surgeons, or is it a jazz band?</p>
<p>Well, it could be either, right?</p>
<p>Hopefully not at the same time, though,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think surgeons and jazz bands</p>
<p>go well together, probably.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both good with fingers, I suppose.</p>
<p>Exactly, but I&rsquo;d rather maybe not play jazz</p>
<p>while they operate on me.</p>
<p>But I think, for me, I think there are moments of both,</p>
<p>but usually not at the same time, right?</p>
<p>There are surgical moments where the moment is so pressing,</p>
<p>you really have to be that task driven, right?</p>
<p>To capture as thoroughly as possible</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s unfolding, right?</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s other times</p>
<p>where you do improvise like jazz, right?</p>
<p>And where you have a lot of choices ahead of you,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing maybe a dance</p>
<p>with the other camera person, right?</p>
<p>In order to capture a scene as creatively</p>
<p>and fully as possible during a fixed duration.</p>
<p>How much, you said shaping, because it is nonfiction.</p>
<p>But I feel like there&rsquo;s so many ways</p>
<p>to tell the same nonfiction,</p>
<p>that is bordering on fiction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s storytelling.</p>
<p>And how much shaping do you see yourself as doing?</p>
<p>Like how important is your role?</p>
<p>How you tell the story?</p>
<p>I suppose the question I&rsquo;m asking is,</p>
<p>how many ways can you really screw this up?</p>
<p>Every day you can screw it up.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really the,</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;re asking about</p>
<p>is really the ethos of documentary filmmaking, right?</p>
<p>I allow a lot of things to guide my choices.</p>
<p>One of them being, am I being fair, right?</p>
<p>Not balanced, but am I being fair to what I&rsquo;m witnessing?</p>
<p>Does the camera capturing in a fair way</p>
<p>the truth of the reality?</p>
<p>Some fundamental truth of it.</p>
<p>And it also speaks to consent, right?</p>
<p>Am I being fair in a sense of consent?</p>
<p>Do I have active consent in this moment, right?</p>
<p>Regardless of whether I have a signed piece of paper.</p>
<p>I always find some way to document it,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s just direct address to camera</p>
<p>or a translated release.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, actually that&rsquo;s an interesting little,</p>
<p>so they say something to the camera that they consent</p>
<p>or they sign the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for example, the large broadcast companies</p>
<p>have this formalized process</p>
<p>where they present a piece of paper, right?</p>
<p>And the subject reads it and they sign it</p>
<p>and then you have permission and that&rsquo;s irrevocable, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll hold up in court.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how I operate, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just, for example, that doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s illiterate</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t read that piece of paper, right?</p>
<p>What if they don&rsquo;t know how to sign their name, right?</p>
<p>So instead you have to have a conversation,</p>
<p>ask questions, have them ask questions,</p>
<p>come to a complete understanding</p>
<p>before you even know whether they understand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re asking, right?</p>
<p>And then in that case, if someone&rsquo;s illiterate,</p>
<p>then you have that conversation,</p>
<p>you just sit down and it takes a long time sometimes,</p>
<p>but you have to do it.</p>
<p>And then if they still wanna participate</p>
<p>and they give you their consent,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t sign a piece of paper, right?</p>
<p>So then you just do in their native language, right?</p>
<p>Direct consent to camera in their language.</p>
<p>Interesting, but also you&rsquo;re speaking to the consent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a human placing trust in you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You make a connection like this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most important consent, yeah.</p>
<p>I hate papers, I hate papers and lawyers</p>
<p>because they, exactly for that reason,</p>
<p>yeah, okay, great, but you should be focusing</p>
<p>on the human connection that leads to the trust,</p>
<p>like real consent and consent day to day,</p>
<p>minute to minute, because that can change.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and it does change.</p>
<p>You mentioned A Woman Captured.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can&rsquo;t answer that, but I will force you.</p>
<p>What are the top three documentaries of all time,</p>
<p>short or feature length?</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>This is not your opinion, this is objective truth.</p>
<p>Maybe top one, what&rsquo;s the greatest?</p>
<p>We got, let&rsquo;s see, March of the Penguins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably number one for me.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I do seem to, the metaphor of penguins</p>
<p>huddling together in hard, cold,</p>
<p>like in the harsh conditions of nature,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s kind of beautiful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love all nature documentaries,</p>
<p>but something about March of the Penguins.</p>
<p>I think Morgan Freeman.</p>
<p>Yeah, he narrated it.</p>
<p>Narrates it, so maybe everything,</p>
<p>just any documentary with Morgan Freeman,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for that.</p>
<p>Warner, Herzog, The Life and the Taiga, The Simple People.</p>
<p>I love Grizzly Man, I love Grizzly Man.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of his best works.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s Joe Rogan&rsquo;s favorite documentary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both comedy and, I mean it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tragic comedy.</p>
<p>Tragic comedy, yeah.</p>
<p>Is there something that stands out to you,</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m joking about best,</p>
<p>something that was impactful to you?</p>
<p>Just to put it out there,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any way to say</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re objectively the best three documentaries</p>
<p>of all time, but for me,</p>
<p>and you may find this interesting given your background,</p>
<p>is that I think my top three are all</p>
<p>from the Eastern Bloc, actually.</p>
<p>So Aquarella by Viktor Kosokovsky is one of my favorite,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a couple years old now,</p>
<p>which is sort of a meditation on the place water has</p>
<p>on our planet and on our lives.</p>
<p>I think A Woman Captured that I mentioned,</p>
<p>which was shot in Hungary.</p>
<p>Is it a feature length one?</p>
<p>Both are feature lengths, yeah.</p>
<p>It is just brilliant,</p>
<p>and it I think has yet to find distribution here in the U.S.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the perfect example of what they call verite,</p>
<p>or direct nonfiction filmmaking.</p>
<p>A European woman, this is the synopsis,</p>
<p>a European woman has been kept by a family</p>
<p>as a domestic slave for 10 years,</p>
<p>drawing courage from the filmmaker&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>She decides to escape the unbearable oppression</p>
<p>and become a free person.</p>
<p>Wow, so the filmmaker is part of the story.</p>
<p>Part of the story, it didn&rsquo;t start that way,</p>
<p>but during the course of the story,</p>
<p>the filmmaker comes to understand</p>
<p>that this is actually modern day slavery.</p>
<p>And rather than just allow it to be,</p>
<p>actually enables and assists this woman</p>
<p>to free herself from slavery and become a free woman.</p>
<p>I wonder, sorry, on a small tangent</p>
<p>before we get to number three,</p>
<p>like Icarus is interesting too.</p>
<p>How often do you become part of the story,</p>
<p>or the story is different because of your presence?</p>
<p>Like you changed the tide of history.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, back to just like one person at a time</p>
<p>that we keep talking,</p>
<p>we keep coming back to that theme on some level.</p>
<p>So this could tie in interesting</p>
<p>to one of my favorite films actually.</p>
<p>So the last two films that I would mention</p>
<p>for my top four list would be,</p>
<p>the third Eastern Bloc one</p>
<p>would be a film called Immortal in 2019,</p>
<p>which was shot in Russia by a Russian woman</p>
<p>that sort of examines the place of the state</p>
<p>in shaping individuals to be vehicles for the state.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s my own synopsis,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one of my takeaways</p>
<p>from the brilliant 60 minute doc or so.</p>
<p>Again, Russian filmmaking is really quite good and powerful.</p>
<p>The fourth one would be a Frederick Wiseman film,</p>
<p>Titicate Follies, which was filmed in the US decades ago,</p>
<p>inside basically the bowels of an insane asylum</p>
<p>or a mental health institution.</p>
<p>And I bring up Wiseman because he is really the godfather,</p>
<p>so to speak, of direct cinema or cinema verite.</p>
<p>And when early in my career,</p>
<p>I really believed in what he expressed</p>
<p>as the place of the verite filmmaker,</p>
<p>which is simply fly on the wall,</p>
<p>which is only observational in nature, right?</p>
<p>And I believe that that&rsquo;s how I should be</p>
<p>as a nonfiction filmmaker,</p>
<p>that I was there only to bear witness, to observe,</p>
<p>and not to intervene in any way, shape, or form.</p>
<p>And that was the sort of foundation</p>
<p>for how I operated for many, many years.</p>
<p>And then some things happened.</p>
<p>So one of those things that happened was I filmed Lifeboat.</p>
<p>And during the course of filming Lifeboat,</p>
<p>which covered rescue operations in the Mediterranean</p>
<p>off the coast of Libya,</p>
<p>in the first three days of that rescue mission,</p>
<p>we came upon over 3,000 people, asylum seekers,</p>
<p>floating in flimsy rafts in the water.</p>
<p>And we were on the Zodiacs and we were filming.</p>
<p>And within the first couple hours,</p>
<p>we would come up to these rafts and these boats</p>
<p>that were in really dire shape,</p>
<p>and people would be pushed off, and people would jump off,</p>
<p>and people would fall into the water,</p>
<p>and some of them couldn&rsquo;t swim.</p>
<p>And so we found ourselves in this moment</p>
<p>where we had a choice.</p>
<p>We could film someone drown in front of us,</p>
<p>or we could put our cameras down</p>
<p>and pull them out of the water.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>We put our cameras in the bottom of the water,</p>
<p>bottom of the Zodiac,</p>
<p>and just started pulling people out of the water.</p>
<p>And if I was Wiseman, according to his paradigm,</p>
<p>then we should have just filmed.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t anticipate that moment beforehand.</p>
<p>I had no sort of foreknowledge</p>
<p>that I was gonna find myself faced</p>
<p>with that dilemma of the moment as a documentarian.</p>
<p>But there was no question in my mind</p>
<p>that I had to put my camera down</p>
<p>and pull that fellow human being out of the water.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t regret it at all.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve come to a different place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve evolved to what I believe for the kind of film</p>
<p>that I do is more appropriate.</p>
<p>I can go to sleep at night knowing that,</p>
<p>regardless of how the film would have been different</p>
<p>if I hadn&rsquo;t made that choice,</p>
<p>I made the right choice as a human being.</p>
<p>So I think of it as being a human being first</p>
<p>and a filmmaker second in moments like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put, but I also think</p>
<p>you could be a human being in small ways too,</p>
<p>like silly ways, and put a little bit of yourself</p>
<p>in documentaries.</p>
<p>I tend to see that as really beautiful.</p>
<p>Like the meta piece of it?</p>
<p>Yeah, just put yourself into the movie a little bit.</p>
<p>Because break that third, fourth, whatever the wall is,</p>
<p>is realize that there&rsquo;s a human behind the camera too.</p>
<p>For some reason, me as a fan, as a viewer,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enjoyable too.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a real authenticity there</p>
<p>behind the story, especially with these hard stories</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing that there&rsquo;s a human being struggling to.</p>
<p>Like observing the suffering</p>
<p>and having to bear the burden</p>
<p>that this kind of suffering exists in the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re behind that camera living that struggle.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s small ways to show yourself in that way.</p>
<p>As you know, I don&rsquo;t do that in a big way.</p>
<p>But I actually, there are subtle moments</p>
<p>where I allow that presence to live just for a second.</p>
<p>Like I hate belly button docs, that&rsquo;s what I call them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a belly button doc?</p>
<p>A belly button doc is navel gazing, right?</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s sort of a narcissistic filmmaking</p>
<p>where someone just studies their own place in the world.</p>
<p>Right, I think.</p>
<p>I see, yeah.</p>
<p>I think my, I&rsquo;m more concerned</p>
<p>with how I can intervene, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you&rsquo;re trying to really deeply empathize.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, if you do empathize, who am I?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna center myself in these stories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about me, right?</p>
<p>I am so unimportant.</p>
<p>What is important is what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s unfolding in the world that we need to act upon.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s selfish and narcissistic</p>
<p>to push myself into these stories unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Now that said, I think there is some small value</p>
<p>in what you&rsquo;re saying just to remind viewers</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s obviously a filmmaker at play.</p>
<p>So sometimes the way that I do that</p>
<p>is just like through a question on camera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d allow the audio to live of a question</p>
<p>or during a conversation I&rsquo;m having with someone</p>
<p>so they can just hear how it&rsquo;s posed, for example, right?</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I do like moments when people recognize that you exist.</p>
<p>They look at the filmmaker past the camera</p>
<p>and yes, you ask the question in an interview</p>
<p>or something like that and they respond to that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like they respond to this like new perturbation</p>
<p>into their reality that was created by this other human.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I especially like when those questions</p>
<p>or those perturbations are like a little bit absurd</p>
<p>and like add something very novel to their situation</p>
<p>and that novelty reveals something about them.</p>
<p>So as opposed to capturing the day to day reality</p>
<p>of their life, you do that plus the perturbations</p>
<p>of like something novel.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But of course, there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways to do this.</p>
<p>Let me, what was number five, by the way?</p>
<p>I only gave you four.</p>
<p>You just.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna stay at four.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a short doc I like, I mentioned,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called The Toxic Pigs of Fukushima.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great title though, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great title.</p>
<p>Yeah, great title.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s seen it, but it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It says what it sounds like.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s exactly what it sounds like,</p>
<p>but really brilliantly executed.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about Lifeboat</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s extremely, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really moving idea.</p>
<p>Just the fact that this exists in the world,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s, as a metaphor, as a reality,</p>
<p>that there is a set of people trying to flee desperately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the desperation of it.</p>
<p>And now with these refugees, the desperation of that,</p>
<p>of trying to escape towards a world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s full of mystery, uncertainty, doubt,</p>
<p>could be hopeless at times,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re willing to do a lot for your own survival</p>
<p>and for the survival of your family</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the human spirit,</p>
<p>and you just capture it in Lifeboat.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the story behind this film</p>
<p>as you started to already tell?</p>
<p>Can you tell me what is it about?</p>
<p>So Lifeboat really seeks to sort of lift up</p>
<p>and showcase the asylum seeker crisis in the Mediterranean</p>
<p>when it was at its height in 2016.</p>
<p>And it came to be for many reasons,</p>
<p>but one of those reasons is colleagues</p>
<p>in the NGO community really shared with me</p>
<p>that when the borders between Greece and Turkey</p>
<p>were shut down, that the flow of Syrian asylum seekers</p>
<p>that was initially going across from Turkey to Greece</p>
<p>was going to shift westward across the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>So I started to research that</p>
<p>and discovered that was exactly the case,</p>
<p>and then further stumbled upon the fact</p>
<p>that nation states hadn&rsquo;t really stepped up to address it</p>
<p>and that there were hundreds of asylum seekers</p>
<p>often drowning in these flimsy crafts</p>
<p>that were pushed off from the shores of Libya</p>
<p>because the EU wasn&rsquo;t doing its duty</p>
<p>to patrol those waters from a humanitarian standpoint.</p>
<p>And so the net result of that was that</p>
<p>this whole sort of like humanitarian community sprung up</p>
<p>and it was civil society based</p>
<p>that tried to meet the needs of those asylum seekers</p>
<p>to just ensure that fellow human beings</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t drowning, simply put.</p>
<p>And one of those was the small little NGO called Sea Watch,</p>
<p>which when they discovered what was happening,</p>
<p>just cobbled together a coalition of volunteers,</p>
<p>bought a research vessel, retrofitted it,</p>
<p>and motored down off the coast of Libya</p>
<p>to start pulling people out of the water.</p>
<p>And again, I found that inspiring, right?</p>
<p>I found that inspiring that this group of volunteers</p>
<p>was doing something that our leaders wouldn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>And it was something as basic and simple</p>
<p>as saving human beings.</p>
<p>And I thought there was an inspiring story there.</p>
<p>And as it turned out, there was.</p>
<p>Have you ever saved someone&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>as part of making these documentaries directly?</p>
<p>And directly, I think you probably have countless lives,</p>
<p>but directly, were you put in that position?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna, I mean, I certainly poured people</p>
<p>out of the water who couldn&rsquo;t swim, I did that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s again, speaking to the basic humanity,</p>
<p>put down the camera and help, yeah.</p>
<p>So this is people coming from Libya,</p>
<p>trying to make it across the Mediterranean Sea</p>
<p>on a crappy, tiny boat.</p>
<p>From a filmmaker perspective, how do you film that?</p>
<p>Was there decisions to capture the desperation?</p>
<p>Well, we were going back to this idea of access</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s so fundamental to my approach.</p>
<p>And we were bound by the strictures of the rescue operation</p>
<p>on this Sea Watch vessel, which was 30 meters long.</p>
<p>And we were two of a crew of 15, right?</p>
<p>So we had to multitask all the time</p>
<p>because the only reason we were on that boat</p>
<p>was by agreeing that if needed,</p>
<p>we would do whatever necessary, right?</p>
<p>To help, right?</p>
<p>And so it was very active on multiple levels</p>
<p>and we were making decisions each and every day</p>
<p>that were not only filmmaking and creative decisions,</p>
<p>but also decisions about how to live that duality, right?</p>
<p>Of being a humanitarian and a filmmaker simultaneously.</p>
<p>And the greatest example I can share of that was,</p>
<p>or with my director of photography in that project,</p>
<p>Kenny Allen, Kenny&rsquo;s a big guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s got like arms like tree trunks.</p>
<p>And he, because he was so physically able and strong,</p>
<p>the head of mission really tasked him</p>
<p>to be on the Zodiacs to pull people out of the water</p>
<p>because he could literally with one arm reach down</p>
<p>and just oftentimes pull someone out, right?</p>
<p>Whereas usually it would take two or three people, right?</p>
<p>And so when we were at the height of triage</p>
<p>and there were people in the water all over</p>
<p>and rafts were sinking,</p>
<p>Kenny was out pulling people out of the water.</p>
<p>And this went on for like 24 hours, right?</p>
<p>And at the end of that first day,</p>
<p>I remember like looking over on the deck</p>
<p>and seeing Kenny like help people up from the ladders</p>
<p>to walk them back, right?</p>
<p>And his camera was nowhere to be seen, right?</p>
<p>And so I walked over to him</p>
<p>and I just grabbed him by the shoulders and said,</p>
<p>Kenny, where&rsquo;s your camera?</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He had no idea where his camera was, right?</p>
<p>And so I just said, Kenny,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here to do what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also here to film it, right?</p>
<p>To make sure that we document</p>
<p>what is unfolding in front of us</p>
<p>so that we have a record of it, right?</p>
<p>So we can bring it to a larger audience.</p>
<p>So you need to go find your camera</p>
<p>so we can also document it.</p>
<p>And that kind of pulled him out</p>
<p>and he went and got his camera and started filming again,</p>
<p>but that gives you a sense of sort of this world</p>
<p>that we had to live in in order to get the story done.</p>
<p>But I think to be a great director of photography,</p>
<p>to be a great director,</p>
<p>you have to lose yourself like that in the story too.</p>
<p>But usually with a camera in your hand, right?</p>
<p>But sometimes you forget the camera.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I feel like if you&rsquo;re obsessed with the camera too much,</p>
<p>you can lose the humanity of it.</p>
<p>You get obsessed with the film and the story.</p>
<p>It can become clinical.</p>
<p>Yes, it can become clinical.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and it&rsquo;s, you know, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t wanna become,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna become clinical in my film, certainly.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a strange and perhaps edgy question.</p>
<p>So some filmmakers believe it&rsquo;s justified</p>
<p>to break the rules in order to tell a powerful story.</p>
<p>Warner Herzog, I read this somewhere,</p>
<p>teaches young filmmakers to pick locks</p>
<p>and forge documents and so on.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that, interesting.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>Bending the rules in service of telling a story.</p>
<p>You would, of course, never break the law,</p>
<p>but is there, does that, just generally speaking,</p>
<p>speaking, bending the rules and so on?</p>
<p>You know, just to elaborate on this question, perhaps,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m distinctly aware that there&rsquo;s parts in the world</p>
<p>where the rule of law is not, like,</p>
<p>enforced as cleanly as it is in the United States,</p>
<p>as fairly as it is in the United States,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a kind of, there&rsquo;s a lot of bribery,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of, like, you don&rsquo;t really know to trust,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know if you can trust the cops</p>
<p>or basically anybody.</p>
<p>So, like, the rules are a very hazy kind of concept.</p>
<p>And a lot of them, especially, like, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>but authoritarian regimes often have</p>
<p>a giant bureaucracy buildup that&rsquo;s full of rules.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more rules than you know what to deal with,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t actually live life</p>
<p>unless you break the rules.</p>
<p>Anyway, laying that all out on the table,</p>
<p>do you ever contend with that,</p>
<p>on what are the rules I can break or should break</p>
<p>to keep to the spirit of the story?</p>
<p>I think you have to ask yourself, are the rules just,</p>
<p>and why are they in place, right?</p>
<p>So, for example, coming into the airport</p>
<p>in southern Yemen, right?</p>
<p>If I just tried to walk through the airport</p>
<p>with all my equipment, even with all the permissions</p>
<p>beforehand, like we had, without having a fixer</p>
<p>at the airport beforehand to make sure</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t go through the standard line, right?</p>
<p>We would have been caught up for three hours at least</p>
<p>negotiating over our equipment and eventually paying</p>
<p>a bribe to get it through, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just reality in a place like Yemen.</p>
<p>And so, of course, knowing that, right?</p>
<p>Having talked to colleagues who had taken</p>
<p>that path previously, I took a different path, right?</p>
<p>Where we hire a fixer beforehand to sort it out</p>
<p>beforehand, right?</p>
<p>Rather than spending three hours of our time</p>
<p>and paying a series of bribes, right?</p>
<p>Instead, we&rsquo;re going to get it fixed beforehand</p>
<p>so that we can walk through a different line</p>
<p>and have no one look at any of our equipment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty good trade off in my mind.</p>
<p>What about security when you&rsquo;re traveling in these places?</p>
<p>Do you ever have bodyguards?</p>
<p>Well, several questions around that.</p>
<p>Are you ever afraid for your life</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re filming in a war zone?</p>
<p>Is there any way to lessen the probability of death?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a death wish.</p>
<p>I try to mitigate risk however I can, however I can.</p>
<p>But one of the ways I can&rsquo;t do it in a conflict zone</p>
<p>is by having armed security with me.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is because,</p>
<p>especially in a place like Yemen, right?</p>
<p>If you have armed security, you become a target</p>
<p>in a way that if you&rsquo;re operating under sort of</p>
<p>the auspices of international humanitarian law,</p>
<p>I actually have more protection.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t bring security.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re working in Northern Yemen, for example,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have someone from the de facto authorities</p>
<p>with you anyway the entire time you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>So the authorities are with you in form anyway.</p>
<p>Regarding fear, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>I mean, fear is a natural human emotion, right?</p>
<p>And I think we have a weird mindset,</p>
<p>this sort of heroic mindset surrounding fear in the US,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t pay tribute to.</p>
<p>I believe as a natural human emotion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an alarm bell that I need to pay attention to.</p>
<p>And I think rather than pretending to be brave,</p>
<p>I think you have to just acknowledge that fear has a place</p>
<p>to keep you alive.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a matter of not letting the fear arrest you</p>
<p>and allowing the fear to live and then acting anyway.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think as a documentary filmmaker,</p>
<p>the fear is a really good signal</p>
<p>for potentially a good thing to do</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a story there?</p>
<p>So is fear is an indicator that you shouldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>or is it an indicator that you should do it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably an indication you should do it, right?</p>
<p>And strangely, I think that&rsquo;s why,</p>
<p>I think that if there&rsquo;s something unusual</p>
<p>about the work I do in some part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of these types of stories, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard to access, but you also have to have</p>
<p>a threshold of willingness to do them when you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there is no guarantee of physical safety, right?</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s why you should do them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much motivated by the things that scare me.</p>
<p>They seem to direct the things that are worth doing</p>
<p>in this all too short life.</p>
<p>How often do you interact with our friendly friends</p>
<p>at the police departments of various locations?</p>
<p>Like, because of the humanitarian nature of your work,</p>
<p>are you able to avoid all such friendly conversations</p>
<p>or are you often making friends with our?</p>
<p>I try to avoid the friendly police people</p>
<p>all over the world as much as possible,</p>
<p>but in some instances, it&rsquo;s important to be proactive,</p>
<p>right, and make sure that they know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>before you do it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about the context and the situation.</p>
<p>For example, working in Northern Yemen,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t film for five minutes</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t have paperwork,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d be taken away.</p>
<p>So you have to make sure you have all those permissions</p>
<p>ahead of time.</p>
<p>50 Feet from Syria, I would love to talk</p>
<p>at least a little bit about this film.</p>
<p>First, can you, high level, can you tell</p>
<p>what this documentary is about?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was early in the Syrian uprising,</p>
<p>and we returned to the Syrian Turkish border</p>
<p>with a Syrian American orthopedic surgeon</p>
<p>who was volunteering, operating on refugees</p>
<p>as they float across the border from Syria into Turkey.</p>
<p>And it was an attempt at the time,</p>
<p>before a lot of films had come out about the conflict,</p>
<p>to really show again the effects of the war on civilians.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard me echo that sentiment multiple times now,</p>
<p>but people knew there was a major conflict in Syria,</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t really understand the form that that was taking</p>
<p>and the impact it was having.</p>
<p>And so we embedded into the,</p>
<p>at the time it was the only clinic in Turkey</p>
<p>that was sanctioned by the Turkish government</p>
<p>to treat Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>And so we filmed there with surgeons</p>
<p>as they operated on war victims.</p>
<p>And we also went into Syria into some of the camps as well.</p>
<p>So in this film, there&rsquo;s a man who crosses the border</p>
<p>every day to retrieve the wounded</p>
<p>and fair them safety and care.</p>
<p>And you also mentioned about heroism in the United States.</p>
<p>Can you tell me about this man and just people like him?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the heroic action</p>
<p>in some of these places that you&rsquo;ve visited?</p>
<p>So in that instance, you know,</p>
<p>I thought of him as the Turkish Schindler, right?</p>
<p>Because he was a human being who of his own volition,</p>
<p>no one was paying him to do this,</p>
<p>but he was spending much of his time.</p>
<p>He was just a local businessman</p>
<p>who really saw the need in the camps</p>
<p>right across the border 10 K away.</p>
<p>And he saw the medical need in particular</p>
<p>and how hard it was to get people</p>
<p>in desperate medical conditions across the border</p>
<p>where there was a clinic just right across the border.</p>
<p>But because of the security and the layers of security,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t get out by themselves.</p>
<p>So he took it upon himself as a Turkish person</p>
<p>to build relationships with the Turkish guards,</p>
<p>which was relatively easy.</p>
<p>And then he built relationships</p>
<p>with sort of the guards in the no man&rsquo;s land</p>
<p>between the Syrian guards</p>
<p>and sort of those who lived in the middle area.</p>
<p>And then also with the Syrian guards at the camp.</p>
<p>And he would drive out there daily and bring them food,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Talk them up and build relationships.</p>
<p>And so every day he would bring these guards food</p>
<p>and build relationships with them.</p>
<p>And what that meant was eventually, right?</p>
<p>He had this avenue of access to and from the camps.</p>
<p>And so he started using it</p>
<p>and he would drive this avenue of access</p>
<p>through the three layers of guards each day.</p>
<p>And then they would open the gates for him</p>
<p>because he had made himself trustworthy in their eyes.</p>
<p>And he would receive the most desperate medical cases</p>
<p>that were coming from all over Northern Syria, right?</p>
<p>To receive medical treatment.</p>
<p>And he would, as you see in the film,</p>
<p>he would ferry them into the back of his car, right?</p>
<p>And then drive them to the hospital</p>
<p>where they would receive operations.</p>
<p>And then he would bring them back if they wanted</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;d healed and recovered back to Syria,</p>
<p>if they wanted to return out post recovery.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t get paid for that.</p>
<p>He was spending his own money to do it</p>
<p>because he saw other human beings in need.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s heroic, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s selfless.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s aspirational for me, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s someone who is spending their time on the planet</p>
<p>doing something of value and good to other human beings.</p>
<p>I mean, if you draw parallels to Schindler,</p>
<p>I feel like the fascinating thing about Schindler</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s kind of a flawed human</p>
<p>and is not the kind of human that does these things usually.</p>
<p>But he just can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the basic humanity.</p>
<p>Despite who you are, the basic humanity shines through.</p>
<p>I think the whims of war test people in those ways, right?</p>
<p>They ask of you things that you may not even know</p>
<p>were going to be asked of you.</p>
<p>And then it speaks to who you are fundamentally</p>
<p>as a human being.</p>
<p>They reveal who you are as a human being, just as you said.</p>
<p>Let me ask a kind of stupid technical question</p>
<p>about publications of movies and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been recently becoming good friends with Thomas Tall,</p>
<p>who was the producer.</p>
<p>His company, Legendary, funded some of the big</p>
<p>sort of blockbuster films and so on.</p>
<p>And so obviously money is part of filmmaking,</p>
<p>but also the release of movies.</p>
<p>And me as a consumer, with Netflix, with YouTube,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I&rsquo;m a huge fan of YouTube</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s like out in the open.</p>
<p>Access, especially historical access.</p>
<p>Like over time, you can look back years later.</p>
<p>If you pay some money, you can watch</p>
<p>some of the great films ever made.</p>
<p>YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, I don&rsquo;t know what other services</p>
<p>there are, HBO, Paramount.</p>
<p>Paramount Plus.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s all these platforms.</p>
<p>Spotify now.</p>
<p>I understand they want to create paywalls and so on.</p>
<p>It makes sense, but I&rsquo;m a huge fan of openness</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really kind of torn by this whole thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s a discussion for perhaps another time.</p>
<p>But the short question is why is it so hard</p>
<p>to watch your documentaries and other films,</p>
<p>other incredible films on the internet?</p>
<p>If I want to pay unlimited amount of money,</p>
<p>I want to pay a lot of money to watch it.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard?</p>
<p>Well, Lifeboat is streaming free on the New Yorker.</p>
<p>Yes, I saw that, which is interesting.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And then also Hunger Ward is on Paramount Plus,</p>
<p>but also it&rsquo;s also streaming free.</p>
<p>So you can either go through a paywall</p>
<p>or you can watch it with ads with Big Macs interspersed.</p>
<p>Big Macs.</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, the contrast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Well, no, it really reveals the power of the documentary.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s still not, even those platforms are,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re not as easily accessible</p>
<p>because you have to like, you have to use,</p>
<p>you have to think and you have to chase a particular.</p>
<p>You have to chase it, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I guess from an economic standpoint,</p>
<p>the answer to that is pretty clear, right?</p>
<p>It may not be what people want to watch.</p>
<p>Maybe people want to watch reality.</p>
<p>Maybe people want to watch animal rescue shows</p>
<p>here in the US, which is exactly why in part,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so vital that we continue to do stories</p>
<p>on things that aren&rsquo;t about flowers and puppy dogs, right?</p>
<p>I would push back on that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s TikTok and you could say,</p>
<p>well, look, humans just want to watch really short content</p>
<p>because they seem to be addicted to that kind of thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s partially true.</p>
<p>But they also watch two, three, four, five hour podcasts.</p>
<p>On TikTok?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s different platforms for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place called YouTube, I&rsquo;ll teach you about it.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, I&rsquo;ve never heard of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good place to publish documentaries, I think.</p>
<p>Humans are interested in a lot of things</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen many times a thing that you think</p>
<p>is a niche thing become a very big thing.</p>
<p>But for them to become mainstream,</p>
<p>they have to have a platform</p>
<p>that allows for the mainstream to happen.</p>
<p>The access.</p>
<p>The access, the dumb, simple, frictionless access.</p>
<p>The frictionless access is a really important thing.</p>
<p>Paywalls create friction and not just because of the money.</p>
<p>It can be free, but if you have to click on a thing</p>
<p>or maybe sign up or put your email,</p>
<p>it prevents you to enjoy the thing you would really enjoy</p>
<p>and you know you would enjoy,</p>
<p>but your baser human nature prevents you from enjoying</p>
<p>because you can just open up TikTok and keep scrolling.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just something to say about platforms</p>
<p>because I think the things that need platforms the most</p>
<p>are things like your films.</p>
<p>The things that I think a lot of people would love watching.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very important and they can have viral impact</p>
<p>on the world that is fundamentally positive.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just, it makes me sad</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not a machine for celebrating those films.</p>
<p>There are lots of machines to celebrate them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just not as always accessible as YouTube, right?</p>
<p>I mean, as soon as you write me that check</p>
<p>for a trillion dollars when I walk out of here,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m gonna put all my films on YouTube</p>
<p>because then I won&rsquo;t have to worry about, you know,</p>
<p>selling them in order so I can make the next film</p>
<p>because you know, film is not just an art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also an industry, right?</p>
<p>And that tension between the two is a constant interplay</p>
<p>that is a reality for me.</p>
<p>So I always have to think about</p>
<p>how can I access the largest audience,</p>
<p>but also, right, go out and shoot the next film, right?</p>
<p>So that longevity question is also an issue</p>
<p>and the finances are part of that sort of equation</p>
<p>that I constantly have to rewrite over and over again.</p>
<p>How often, as a creative mind,</p>
<p>do you feel the constraints, the financial constraints?</p>
<p>I wish I could do a lot more films</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t always because of financial constraints.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the number of films.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And is a film that you do currently,</p>
<p>is a film that you do at any one time</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re filming it already funded</p>
<p>or is it the funding from previous stuff</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to use?</p>
<p>Before Hunger Ward,</p>
<p>I would just take a flyer on my films, right?</p>
<p>Where I would just say this meets the so what threshold.</p>
<p>This is a story that has to be told and I want to tell it.</p>
<p>And then I could just go shoot it.</p>
<p>And usually on credit, usually on a credit card, right?</p>
<p>So based on a belief that Lifeboat was done that way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>50 Feet from Syria was done that way.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re on a boat, broke.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s free food, right?</p>
<p>And free lodging because there&rsquo;s a bunk on the boat.</p>
<p>But I do that not intending to stay broke, right?</p>
<p>But based on a foundational belief</p>
<p>that if I bring to bear</p>
<p>all of my sort of quiver of creative arrows to it, right?</p>
<p>That I can create something of value, right?</p>
<p>In the world, but hopefully also financially</p>
<p>that then I can sell to someone.</p>
<p>And you know, every time I&rsquo;ve done that Lex,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten into the black.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a risk and I have to have a certain risk threshold</p>
<p>financially to do that.</p>
<p>But I believe so deeply in these stories</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m willing to do that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to do that with Hunger Ward.</p>
<p>Luckily I had funders for that film.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, take risks in this life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna pay off.</p>
<p>Which reminds me of, let me ask you,</p>
<p>I already asked you for advice about,</p>
<p>for a filmmaker, how to win an Oscar.</p>
<p>Well, I haven&rsquo;t won an Oscar.</p>
<p>How to get nominated for an Oscar, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Or just how to make great documentaries,</p>
<p>how to make great film.</p>
<p>But let me ask, even zoom out bigger.</p>
<p>You mentioned some of these things,</p>
<p>doing the things that you think matters.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people,</p>
<p>high school, college,</p>
<p>dreaming of living a life worth living?</p>
<p>What advice would you give them about career</p>
<p>or maybe just life in general?</p>
<p>How to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re gonna react to this</p>
<p>given sort of your expertise.</p>
<p>But I would say put down the smartphone,</p>
<p>step away from the monitor, right?</p>
<p>Because real life is not a screen, right?</p>
<p>I believe that sort of the foundational skills</p>
<p>which are conducive and important to success</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t necessarily those technical skills</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re going to learn in trade schools or university.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re more foundational than that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re learning how to interact and listen.</p>
<p>With humans?</p>
<p>With humans, yeah, to really see and listen, right?</p>
<p>And observe.</p>
<p>And observe, right?</p>
<p>And how to step out of your door</p>
<p>and if the electricity goes out, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re five miles away from your house,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need a smartphone to get home</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve set visual markers for yourself</p>
<p>on how to get back to where you live, right?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in danger right now</p>
<p>of living in a world where</p>
<p>if the satellites stop functioning, right?</p>
<p>Then a whole lot of people</p>
<p>have become completely dysfunctional, right?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re so reliant upon the screens in our lives.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot of foundational skills</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with technology</p>
<p>that we need to learn and everything rests upon those.</p>
<p>So I would say learn those foundations,</p>
<p>learn how to write well.</p>
<p>Read a lot, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different kind of knowledge and wisdom</p>
<p>that comes out of that.</p>
<p>So reading is kind of the equivalent of listening</p>
<p>and observing and writing is</p>
<p>kind of integration of all of that</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve observed and listened to</p>
<p>and tried to express something with that.</p>
<p>So I think my training in the theater</p>
<p>has served me so well in the documentary world, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s all about interaction</p>
<p>and listening and talking and dialogue, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I do in documentaries, right?</p>
<p>Is I listen.</p>
<p>Yeah, we mentioned fear.</p>
<p>Being an introvert, I&rsquo;m very afraid of people</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m drawn to them and fascinated by them</p>
<p>because of that.</p>
<p>Enjoy listening to them.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And observing them.</p>
<p>And you mentioned reading.</p>
<p>You mentioned books as a catalyst,</p>
<p>as a stimulator of your imagination.</p>
<p>Is there books in your life, a couple, one, two, three,</p>
<p>that kind of left an impact</p>
<p>or a little bit of a spark of inspiration</p>
<p>early on in life that stand out from your memory?</p>
<p>I was given The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran</p>
<p>as a graduation present from my high school</p>
<p>English teacher.</p>
<p>And I still have that book in a special place</p>
<p>on my bookshelf because I think it speaks</p>
<p>to the nature of human experience, right?</p>
<p>And I return to it all the time</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s wisdom there, you know?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s many, many books.</p>
<p>Fiction or nonfiction, what connects with you usually</p>
<p>in the past, for the imagination?</p>
<p>I read mostly nonfiction most of the time.</p>
<p>Ten Points is a book I love a lot.</p>
<p>What is Ten Points?</p>
<p>Ten Points is, I think his name is Bill Strickland.</p>
<p>He was the editor of, I think, Bicycle Magazine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of his personal memoir</p>
<p>of his experience growing up with a lot of abuse</p>
<p>and how that transformed him as a human being.</p>
<p>You know, one instrumental book for me</p>
<p>that I bumped into in my early 20s,</p>
<p>boy, these are all nonfiction,</p>
<p>except for The Princess Bride.</p>
<p>Have to mention, it&rsquo;s an outlier.</p>
<p>No, no, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.</p>
<p>I read that in my early 20s,</p>
<p>and I found so many of the principles in that book.</p>
<p>What are the habits from that one?</p>
<p>Seek first to understand, then to be understood</p>
<p>is one of them, you know?</p>
<p>The notion of proactivity is one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, and so I&rsquo;ve held onto some of those principles</p>
<p>through my life as well, for sure.</p>
<p>What have been, you&rsquo;ve observed</p>
<p>suffering darker aspects of human nature</p>
<p>in your own personal life.</p>
<p>What has been some of the darkest moments in your life,</p>
<p>darkest times in your life?</p>
<p>Is there something that you went through</p>
<p>and then perhaps you carry it through your work?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably one of the darkest moments</p>
<p>was an experience that I had, again, in my early 20s,</p>
<p>and I was living in Southern California,</p>
<p>and the Pacific Coast Highway</p>
<p>that goes north and south along the beach,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s that little concrete path</p>
<p>that people jog and ride their bikes,</p>
<p>and I was riding my bike on the PCH,</p>
<p>and I was coming up to a corner on it,</p>
<p>and I heard this tremendous crash, and it was really loud,</p>
<p>and I came around the corner,</p>
<p>and it was a car accident, a car crash.</p>
<p>It was a multiple vehicle crash,</p>
<p>and what had happened is that a Volvo had hit another car,</p>
<p>and then when it hit it, it went over the top of the car</p>
<p>and hit a Volkswagen van,</p>
<p>and it peeled away the top of the Volkswagen van</p>
<p>when it hit it and then landed.</p>
<p>So three vehicles, and it just happened,</p>
<p>and lying in the middle of the road</p>
<p>was a body decapitated,</p>
<p>and there was another person from one of the cars</p>
<p>lying in the middle of the road, still alive,</p>
<p>and then on the hood of the Volvo</p>
<p>was this woman who had come through the windshield,</p>
<p>just a mess, blood everywhere, moaning back and forth,</p>
<p>and a bystander ran into the middle of the road</p>
<p>and started administering first aid</p>
<p>to the person lying in the road,</p>
<p>and I stood there watching the scene</p>
<p>and every fiber of my being,</p>
<p>wanted to run to the woman on the hood of the Volvo</p>
<p>and do something, anything, right, just to be there,</p>
<p>and it was obvious to me that she was gonna die,</p>
<p>but I felt like at least if I ran there,</p>
<p>I could offer some comfort for her last moment,</p>
<p>and right then, the sirens started to blare,</p>
<p>and I knew that there&rsquo;d be paramedics there</p>
<p>within minutes, that people would come to help,</p>
<p>and I froze, and I was scared,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t do anything,</p>
<p>and I watched while this woman died on the hood of the Volvo,</p>
<p>and that experience is sort of seared into my consciousness,</p>
<p>the fact that I watched and didn&rsquo;t act,</p>
<p>I feel is one of the great failures of my life,</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t able to act in a moment of need,</p>
<p>no matter how small,</p>
<p>and from that, I made a decision out of that experience</p>
<p>that if I ever found myself in a situation</p>
<p>where I had the ability to act and I could act</p>
<p>to help another human being,</p>
<p>I would act to help another human being in such need</p>
<p>that I would act, that I wouldn&rsquo;t let fear freeze me.</p>
<p>Instead, I would allow that fear to catalyze me into action</p>
<p>and do something and intervene in whatever way I could,</p>
<p>even if I didn&rsquo;t have the skillset.</p>
<p>And in some ways, all of that echoes in your documentaries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna let fear stop you from trying to help.</p>
<p>I think that experience, that experience of failure,</p>
<p>what I framed as just human failure on my part</p>
<p>is foundational probably to my work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that to happen again, Lex.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be that person who watches.</p>
<p>I want to do what I can when I can.</p>
<p>If we zoom out, you were just one human</p>
<p>that witnessed that, that trauma.</p>
<p>One human that witnessed so much suffering</p>
<p>in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>And as we zoom out across space and time and look at Earth,</p>
<p>why do you think we&rsquo;re here on this Earth?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of human civilization?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of your life, of individual human life?</p>
<p>And broadly speaking, what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Skyfish, Cheryl.</p>
<p>Oh boy, yeah.</p>
<p>For me, I can speak personally on that only.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that I believe that the meaning of my life</p>
<p>is to try to make the world a little bit better before I go.</p>
<p>You know, I, when I was in theater in grad school,</p>
<p>I directed a play called Shadowlands by C.S. Lewis.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a quote from that, it goes like this.</p>
<p>We are like blocks of stone</p>
<p>out of which the sculptor carves the forms of men.</p>
<p>The blows of his chisel, which hurt us so much,</p>
<p>are what make us perfect.</p>
<p>Now, I would take away the perfect part, right?</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;ve remembered that quote for so many years</p>
<p>because I believe in the underlying notion</p>
<p>that the blows of the chisel,</p>
<p>which are the experiences that we go through,</p>
<p>shape us, right, necessarily so,</p>
<p>and hopefully shape us into a better human being.</p>
<p>And in my case, a human being that I hope</p>
<p>can make the world a little better,</p>
<p>you know, through those blows.</p>
<p>Before it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Yeah, before it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Before you go, as you said, do you think about that?</p>
<p>Do you think about the going part, your mortality?</p>
<p>You ever think about that?</p>
<p>You said you don&rsquo;t have a death wish,</p>
<p>you try to minimize risk, but eventually it&rsquo;s gonna be over.</p>
<p>Yeah, for all of us, absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, speak for yourself.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve got other plans as well.</p>
<p>I tend to merge, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got other plans as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to merge with robots, embody, no, not at all.</p>
<p>Yes, for all of us, unfortunately or fortunately,</p>
<p>or who the heck knows.</p>
<p>But do you ponder your mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>I live with my mortality, knowing that it&rsquo;s fleeting,</p>
<p>that my life is fleeting and that I&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>into the ground, just like everyone else,</p>
<p>or maybe as ashes, you know?</p>
<p>So I live with that knowledge every day,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t allow it to stop me or hold me up.</p>
<p>Rather, I really, it drives me, right?</p>
<p>It drives me to try to get as much done</p>
<p>as I can before I go, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the knowledge of your death</p>
<p>is a kind of dance partner,</p>
<p>and you try to dance beautifully.</p>
<p>This guy, you&rsquo;re an incredible human,</p>
<p>incredible artist and filmmaker,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would sit</p>
<p>and spend your really valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>I really, really enjoyed this conversation.</p>
<p>I did too, thanks for having me, Lex,</p>
<p>and thanks for doing what you do.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Sky Fist Gerald.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Elie Wiesel.</p>
<p>The opposite of love is not hate, it&rsquo;s indifference.</p>
<p>The opposite of art is not ugliness, it&rsquo;s indifference.</p>
<p>The opposite of faith is not heresy, it&rsquo;s indifference.</p>
<p>And the opposite of life is not death, it&rsquo;s indifference.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
