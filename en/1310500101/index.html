    <p>The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach, VP of Research at the AI Foundation,</p>
<p>with a history of research positions at MIT and Harvard. Yosha is one of the most unique</p>
<p>and brilliant people in the artificial intelligence community, exploring the workings</p>
<p>of the human mind, intelligence, consciousness, life on Earth, and the possibly simulated</p>
<p>fabric of our universe. I could see myself talking to Yosha many times in the future.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the ads. Two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App. Please consider supporting the</p>
<p>podcast by signing up at expressvpn.com slash LexPod and downloading Cash App and using code</p>
<p>LEXPodcast. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>review it with five stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with</p>
<p>me on Twitter at LexFriedman. Since this comes up more often than I ever would have imagined,</p>
<p>I challenge you to try to figure out how to spell my last name without using the letter E.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll probably be the correct way. As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now and never hear</p>
<p>any yas in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. This show is sponsored by</p>
<p>ExpressVPN. Get it at expressvpn.com slash LexPod to support this podcast and to get an extra three</p>
<p>months free on a one year package. I&rsquo;ve been using ExpressVPN for many years. I love it.</p>
<p>I think ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there. They told me to say it, but I think it actually</p>
<p>happens to be true. It doesn&rsquo;t log your data, it&rsquo;s crazy fast, and it&rsquo;s easy to use. Literally,</p>
<p>just one big power on button. Again, for obvious reasons, it&rsquo;s really important that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>log your data. It works on Linux and everywhere else too. Shout out to my favorite flavor of Linux,</p>
<p>Bantu Mate 2004. Once again, get it at expressvpn.com slash LexPod to support this podcast and to get</p>
<p>an extra three months free on a one year package. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one</p>
<p>finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code LexPodcast. Cash App lets you send money to</p>
<p>friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar. Since Cash</p>
<p>App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that works</p>
<p>behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel.</p>
<p>So big props to the Cash App engineers for taking a step up to the next layer of abstraction over</p>
<p>the stock market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LexPodcast,</p>
<p>you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to First, an organization that is helping</p>
<p>advanced robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Joscha Bach. As you&rsquo;ve said, you grew up in a forest in East</p>
<p>Germany, just as we&rsquo;re talking about off mic, to parents who are artists. And now I think,</p>
<p>at least to me, you&rsquo;ve become one of the most unique thinkers in the AI world.</p>
<p>So can we try to reverse engineer your mind a little bit?</p>
<p>What were the key philosopher, scientist ideas, maybe even movies or just realizations that</p>
<p>had an impact on you when you were growing up that kind of led to the trajectory,</p>
<p>or were the key sort of crossroads in the trajectory of your intellectual development?</p>
<p>My father came from a long tradition of architects, a distant branch of the Bach family.</p>
<p>And so basically, he was technically a nerd. And nerds need to interface in society with</p>
<p>nonstandard ways. Sometimes I define a nerd as somebody who thinks that the purpose of</p>
<p>communication is to submit your ideas to peer review. And normal people understand that the</p>
<p>primary purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment. And these purposes tend to conflict,</p>
<p>which means that nerds have to learn how to interact with society at large.</p>
<p>Who is the reviewer in the nerd&rsquo;s view of communication?</p>
<p>Everybody who you consider to be a peer. So whatever hapless individual is around,</p>
<p>well, you would try to make him or her the gift of information.</p>
<p>Okay. So you&rsquo;re now, by the way, my research malinformed me. So you&rsquo;re architect or artist?</p>
<p>So he did study architecture. But basically, my grandfather made the wrong decision. He married</p>
<p>an aristocrat and was drawn into the war. And he came back after 15 years. So basically, my father</p>
<p>was not parented by a nerd, but by somebody who tried to tell him what to do, and expected him</p>
<p>to do what he was told. And he was unable to. He&rsquo;s unable to do things if he&rsquo;s not intrinsically</p>
<p>motivated. So in some sense, my grandmother broke her son. And her son responded when he became an</p>
<p>architect to become an artist. So he built 100 Wasser architecture. He built houses without</p>
<p>right angles. He built lots of things that didn&rsquo;t work in the more brutalist traditions of eastern</p>
<p>Germany. And so he bought an old watermill, moved out to the countryside, and did only what he wanted</p>
<p>to do, which was art. Eastern Germany was perfect for Boheme, because you had complete material</p>
<p>safety. Food was heavily subsidized, healthcare was free. You didn&rsquo;t have to worry about rent or</p>
<p>pensions or anything. So it&rsquo;s a socialized communist side. Yes. And the other thing is,</p>
<p>it was almost impossible not to be in political disagreement with your government, which is very</p>
<p>productive for artists. So everything that you do is intrinsically meaningful, because it will</p>
<p>always touch on the deeper currents of society of culture and be in conflict with it and tension</p>
<p>with it. And you will always have to define yourself with respect to this. So what impacted</p>
<p>your father, this outside of the box thinker against the government, against the world artists?</p>
<p>He was actually not a thinker. He was somebody who only got self aware to the degree that he</p>
<p>needed to make himself functional. So in some sense, he was also in the late 1960s. And he was</p>
<p>in some sense a hippie. So he became a one person cult. He lived out there in his kingdom. He built</p>
<p>big sculpture gardens and started many avenues of art and so on and convinced a woman to live with</p>
<p>him. She was also an architect and she adored him and decided to share her life with him.</p>
<p>And I basically grew up in a big cave full of books. I&rsquo;m almost feral. And I was bored out</p>
<p>there. It was very, very beautiful, very quiet, and quite lonely. So I started to read. And by</p>
<p>the time I came to school, I&rsquo;ve read everything until fourth grade and then some. And there was</p>
<p>not a real way for me to relate to the outside world. And I couldn&rsquo;t quite put my finger on why.</p>
<p>And today I know it was because I was a nerd, obviously, and it was the only nerd around. So</p>
<p>there was no other kids like me. And there was nobody interested in physics or computing or</p>
<p>mathematics and so on. And this village school that I went to was basically a nice school.</p>
<p>Kids were nice to me. I was not beaten up, but I also didn&rsquo;t make many friends or</p>
<p>build deep relationships. They only happened in starting from ninth grade when I went into a</p>
<p>school for mathematics and physics. Do you remember any key books from this moment?</p>
<p>I basically read everything. So I went to the library and I worked my way through the</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s and young adult sections. And then I read a lot of science fiction,</p>
<p>for instance, Stanislav Lem, basically the great author of Cybernetics, has influenced me. Back</p>
<p>then, I didn&rsquo;t see him as a big influence because everything that he wrote seemed to be so natural</p>
<p>to me. And it&rsquo;s only later that I contrasted it with what other people wrote. Another thing that</p>
<p>was very influential on me were the classical philosophers and also the literature of romanticism.</p>
<p>So German poetry and art, Troste Hilshoff and Heine and up to Hesse and so on.</p>
<p>Hesse. I love Hesse. So at which point do the classical philosophers end? At this point,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the 21st century. What&rsquo;s the latest classical philosopher? Does this stretch through</p>
<p>even as far as Nietzsche or is this, are we talking about Plato and Aristotle?</p>
<p>I think that Nietzsche is the classical equivalent of a shit poster.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very smart and easy to read, but he&rsquo;s not so much trolling others. He&rsquo;s trolling himself</p>
<p>because he was at odds with the world. Largely his romantic relationships didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>He got angry and he basically became a nihilist.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a beautiful way to be as an intellectual is to constantly be trolling yourself,</p>
<p>to be in that conflict, in that tension?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a lack of self awareness. At some point, you have to understand the</p>
<p>comedy of your own situation. If you take yourself seriously and you are not functional,</p>
<p>it ends in tragedy as it did for Nietzsche.</p>
<p>I think you think he took himself too seriously in that tension.</p>
<p>And as you find the same thing in Hesse and so on, this Steppenwolf syndrome is classic</p>
<p>adolescence where you basically feel misunderstood by the world and you don&rsquo;t understand that all the</p>
<p>misunderstandings are the result of your own lack of self awareness because you think that you are</p>
<p>a prototypical human and the others around you should behave the same way as you expect them</p>
<p>based on your innate instincts and it doesn&rsquo;t work out and you become a transcendentalist</p>
<p>to deal with that. So it&rsquo;s very, very understandable and have great sympathies for this</p>
<p>to the degree that I can have sympathy for my own intellectual history.</p>
<p>But you have to grow out of it.</p>
<p>So as an intellectual, a life well lived, a journey well traveled is one where you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take yourself seriously from that perspective?</p>
<p>No, I think that you are neither serious or not serious yourself because you need to become</p>
<p>unimportant as a subject. That is, if you are a philosopher, belief is not a verb.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do this for the audience and you don&rsquo;t do it for yourself.</p>
<p>You have to submit to the things that are possibly true and you have to follow wherever</p>
<p>your inquiry leads. But it&rsquo;s not about you. It has nothing to do with you.</p>
<p>So do you think then people like Ayn Rand believed sort of an idea of there&rsquo;s objective</p>
<p>truth. So what&rsquo;s your sense in the philosophical, if you remove yourself as objective from the</p>
<p>picture, you think it&rsquo;s possible to actually discover ideas that are true or are we just</p>
<p>in a mesh of relative concepts that are either true nor false? It&rsquo;s just a giant mess.</p>
<p>You cannot define objective truth without understanding the nature of truth in the first</p>
<p>place. So what does the brain mean by saying that discover something as truth? So for instance,</p>
<p>a model can be predictive or not predictive. Then there can be a sense in which a mathematical</p>
<p>statement can be true because it&rsquo;s defined as true under certain conditions. So it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>a particular state that a variable can have in a simple game. And then you can have a</p>
<p>correspondence between systems and talk about truth, which is again, a type of model correspondence.</p>
<p>And there also seems to be a particular kind of ground truth. So for instance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re confronted with the enormity of something existing at all. It&rsquo;s stunning when you realize</p>
<p>something exists rather than nothing. And this seems to be true. There&rsquo;s an absolute truth in</p>
<p>the fact that something seems to be happening. Yeah, that to me is a showstopper. I could just</p>
<p>think about that idea and be amazed by that idea for the rest of my life and not going any farther</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t even know the answer to that. Why does anything exist at all?</p>
<p>Well, the easiest answer is existence is the default, right? So this is the lowest number of</p>
<p>bits that you would need to encode this. Whose answer?</p>
<p>The simplest answer to this is that existence is the default.</p>
<p>What about nonexistence? I mean, that seems&hellip;</p>
<p>Nonexistence might not be a meaningful notion in this sense. So in some sense,</p>
<p>if everything that can exist exists, for something to exist, it probably needs to be implementable.</p>
<p>The only thing that can be implemented is finite automata. So maybe the whole of existence is the</p>
<p>superposition of all finite automata and we are in some region of the fractal that has the properties</p>
<p>that it can contain us. What does it mean to be a superposition of finite automata?</p>
<p>Superposition of all possible rules? Imagine that every automaton is basically an operator</p>
<p>that acts on some substrate and as a result, you get emergent patterns.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the substrate?</p>
<p>I have no idea to know. But some substrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that can store information.</p>
<p>Something that can store information, there&rsquo;s a automaton.</p>
<p>Something that can hold state.</p>
<p>Still, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me the why that exists at all. I could just sit there</p>
<p>with a beer or a vodka and just enjoy the fact, pondering the why.</p>
<p>It may not have a why. This might be the wrong direction to ask into this. So there could be no</p>
<p>relation in the why direction without asking for a purpose or for a cause. It doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that everything has to have a purpose or cause. So we mentioned some philosophers in that early,</p>
<p>just taking a brief step back into that. So we asked ourselves when did classical philosophy end?</p>
<p>I think for Germany, it largely ended with the first revolution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically when we entered the monarchy and started a democracy. And at this point,</p>
<p>we basically came up with a new form of government that didn&rsquo;t have a good sense of</p>
<p>this new organism that society wanted to be. And in a way, it decapitated the universities.</p>
<p>So the universities went on through modernism like a headless chicken.</p>
<p>At the same time, democracy failed in Germany and we got fascism as a result.</p>
<p>And it burned down things in a similar way as Stalinism burned down intellectual traditions</p>
<p>in Russia. And Germany, both Germanys have not recovered from this. Eastern Germany had this</p>
<p>vulgar dialectic materialism and Western Germany didn&rsquo;t get much more edgy than Habermas. So in</p>
<p>some sense, both countries lost their intellectual traditions and killing off and driving out the</p>
<p>Jews didn&rsquo;t help. Yeah. So that was the end of really rigorous what you would say is classical</p>
<p>philosophy. There&rsquo;s also this thing that in some sense, the low hanging foods in philosophy</p>
<p>were mostly wrapped. And the last big things that we discovered was the constructivist turn</p>
<p>in mathematics. So to understand that the parts of mathematics that work are computation,</p>
<p>there was a very significant discovery in the first half of the 20th century. And it hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fully permeated philosophy and even physics yet. Physicists checked out the code libraries</p>
<p>for mathematics before constructivism became universal. What&rsquo;s constructivism? What are you</p>
<p>referring to, G√∂del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem, those kinds of ideas? So basically, G√∂del himself,</p>
<p>I think, didn&rsquo;t get it yet. Hilbert could get it. Hilbert saw that, for instance, countries</p>
<p>set theoretic experiments and mathematics led into contradictions. And he noticed that with the</p>
<p>current semantics, we cannot build a computer in mathematics that runs mathematics without crashing.</p>
<p>And G√∂del could prove this. And so what G√∂del could show is using classical mathematical</p>
<p>semantics, you run into contradictions. And because G√∂del strongly believed in these semantics and</p>
<p>more than what he could observe and so on, he was shocked. It basically shook his world to the core</p>
<p>because in some sense, he felt that the world has to be implemented in classical mathematics.</p>
<p>And for Turing, it wasn&rsquo;t quite so bad. I think that Turing could see that the solution is to</p>
<p>understand that mathematics was computation all along, which means you, for instance, pi</p>
<p>in classical mathematics is a value. It&rsquo;s also a function, but it&rsquo;s the same thing. And in</p>
<p>computation, a function is only a value when you can compute it. And if you cannot compute the last</p>
<p>digit of pi, you only have a function. You can plug this function into your local sun, let it run</p>
<p>until the sun burns out. This is it. This is the last digit of pi you will know. But it also means</p>
<p>there can be no process in the physical universe or in any physically realized computer that depends</p>
<p>on having known the last digit of pi. Which means there are parts of physics that are defined in</p>
<p>such a way that cannot strictly be true, because assuming that this could be true leads into</p>
<p>contradictions. So I think putting computation at the center of the world view is actually the</p>
<p>right way to think about it. Yes. And Wittgenstein could see it. And Wittgenstein basically preempted</p>
<p>the logitist program of AI that Minsky started later, like 30 years later. Turing was actually</p>
<p>a pupil of Wittgenstein. I didn&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s any connection between Turing and Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein even cancelled some classes when Turing was not present because he thought it</p>
<p>was not worth spending the time with the others. If you read the Tractatus, it&rsquo;s a very beautiful</p>
<p>book, like basically one thought on 75 pages. It&rsquo;s very non typical for philosophy because it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have arguments in it and it doesn&rsquo;t have references in it. It&rsquo;s just one thought that is not intending</p>
<p>to convince anybody. He says, it&rsquo;s mostly for people that had the same insight as me,</p>
<p>just spell it out. And this insight is there is a way in which mathematics and philosophy</p>
<p>ought to meet. Mathematics tries to understand the domain of all languages by starting with those</p>
<p>that are so formalizable that you can prove all the properties of the statements that you make.</p>
<p>But the price that you pay is that your language is very, very simple. So it&rsquo;s very hard to say</p>
<p>something meaningful in mathematics. And it looks complicated to people, but it&rsquo;s far less complicated</p>
<p>than what our brain is casually doing all the time when it makes sense of reality. And philosophy is</p>
<p>coming from the top. So it&rsquo;s mostly starting from natural languages with vaguely defined concepts.</p>
<p>And the hope is that mathematics and philosophy can meet at some point. And Wittgenstein was trying</p>
<p>to make them meet. And he already understood that, for instance, you could express everything with</p>
<p>the NAND calculus, that you could reduce the entire logic to NAND gates as we do in our modern</p>
<p>computers. So in some sense, he already understood Turing universality before Turing spelled it out.</p>
<p>I think when he wrote the Tractatus, he didn&rsquo;t understand yet that the idea was so important</p>
<p>and significant. And I suspect then when Turing wrote it out, nobody cared that much. Turing was</p>
<p>not that famous when he lived. It was mostly his work in decrypting the German codes that made him</p>
<p>famous or gave him some notoriety. But this saint status that he has to computer science right now</p>
<p>and the AI is something that I think he could acquire later. That&rsquo;s kind of interesting. Do</p>
<p>you think of computation and computer science? And you kind of represent that to me is maybe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the modern day. You in a sense are the new philosopher by sort of the computer scientist</p>
<p>who dares to ask the bigger questions that philosophy originally started is the new</p>
<p>philosopher. Certainly not me. I think I&rsquo;m mostly still this child that grows up in a</p>
<p>very beautiful valley and looks at the world from the outside and tries to understand what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on. And my teachers tell me things and they largely don&rsquo;t make sense. So I have to make my</p>
<p>own models. I have to discover the foundations of what the others are saying. I have to try to fix</p>
<p>them to be charitable. I try to understand what they must have thought originally or what their</p>
<p>teachers or their teacher&rsquo;s teachers must have thought until everything got lost in translation</p>
<p>and how to make sense of the reality that we are in. And whenever I have an original idea,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually late to the party by say 400 years. And the only thing that&rsquo;s good is that the parties</p>
<p>get smaller and smaller the older I get and the more I explore it. The parties get smaller and</p>
<p>more exclusive and more exclusive. So it seems like one of the key qualities of your upbringing</p>
<p>was that you were not tethered, whether it&rsquo;s because of your parents or in general,</p>
<p>maybe something within your mind, some genetic material, you were not tethered to the ideas</p>
<p>of the general populace, which is actually a unique property. We&rsquo;re kind of the education</p>
<p>system and whatever, not education system, just existing in this world forces certain sets of</p>
<p>ideas onto you. Can you disentangle that? Why are you not so tethered? Even in your work today,</p>
<p>you seem to not care about perhaps a best paper in Europe, right? Being tethered to particular</p>
<p>things that current today in this year, people seem to value as a thing you put on your CV and</p>
<p>resume. You&rsquo;re a little bit more outside of that world, outside of the world of ideas that people</p>
<p>are especially focused in the benchmarks of today, the things. Can you disentangle that?</p>
<p>Because I think that&rsquo;s inspiring. And if there were more people like that,</p>
<p>we might be able to solve some of the bigger problems that AI dreams to solve.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a big danger in this because in a way you are expected to marry into an</p>
<p>intellectual tradition and visit this tradition into a particular school. If everybody comes up</p>
<p>with their own paradigms, the whole thing is not cumulative as an enterprise. So in some sense,</p>
<p>you need a healthy balance. You need paradigmatic thinkers and you need people that work within</p>
<p>given paradigms. Basically, scientists today define themselves largely by methods. And it&rsquo;s almost a</p>
<p>disease that we think as a scientist, as somebody who was convinced by their guidance counselor,</p>
<p>that they should join a particular discipline and then they find a good mentor to learn the</p>
<p>right methods. And then they are lucky enough and privileged enough to join the right team. And then</p>
<p>their name will show up on influential papers. But we also see that there are diminishing returns</p>
<p>with this approach. And when our field, computer science and AI started, most of the people that</p>
<p>joined this field had interesting opinions. And today&rsquo;s thinkers in AI either don&rsquo;t have interesting</p>
<p>opinions at all, or these opinions are inconsequential for what they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>doing. Because what they&rsquo;re doing is they apply the state of the art methods with a small epsilon.</p>
<p>And this is often a good idea if you think that this is the best way to make progress. And for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s first of all, very boring. If somebody else can do it, why should I do it? If the current</p>
<p>methods of machine learning lead to strong AI, why should I be doing it? I will just wait until</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re done and wait until they do this on the beach or read interesting books or write some</p>
<p>and have fun. But if you don&rsquo;t think that we are currently doing the right thing, if we are missing</p>
<p>some perspectives, then it&rsquo;s required to think outside of the box. It&rsquo;s also required to understand</p>
<p>the boxes. But it&rsquo;s necessary to understand what worked and what didn&rsquo;t work and for what reasons.</p>
<p>So you have to be willing to ask new questions and design new methods whenever you want to</p>
<p>answer them. And you have to be willing to dismiss the existing methods if you think that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to yield the right answers. It&rsquo;s very bad career advice to do that. So maybe to briefly</p>
<p>stay for one more time in the early days, when would you say for you was the dream</p>
<p>before we dive into the discussions that we just almost started, when was the dream to understand</p>
<p>or maybe to create human level intelligence born for you?</p>
<p>I think that you can see AI largely today as advanced information processing. If you would</p>
<p>change the acronym of AI into that, most people in the field would be happy. It would not change</p>
<p>anything what they&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;re automating statistics and many of the statistical models</p>
<p>are more advanced than what statisticians had in the past. And it&rsquo;s pretty good work. It&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>productive. And the other aspect of AI is philosophical project. And this philosophical</p>
<p>project is very risky and very few people work on it and it&rsquo;s not clear if it succeeds.</p>
<p>So first of all, you keep throwing sort of a lot of really interesting ideas and I have to</p>
<p>pick which ones we go with. But first of all, you use the term information processing,</p>
<p>just information processing as if it&rsquo;s the mere, it&rsquo;s the muck of existence as if it&rsquo;s the epitome</p>
<p>of existence, that the entirety of the universe might be information processing, that consciousness</p>
<p>and intelligence might be information processing. So that maybe you can comment on if the advanced</p>
<p>information processing is a limiting kind of a round of ideas. And then the other one is,</p>
<p>what do you mean by the philosophical project? So I suspect that general intelligence is the</p>
<p>result of trying to solve general problems. So intelligence, I think, is the ability to model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily goal directed rationality or something. Many intelligent people are bad at this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the ability to be presented with a number of patterns and see a structure in those patterns</p>
<p>and be able to predict the next set of patterns, to make sense of things. And</p>
<p>some problems are very general. Usually intelligence serves control, so you make these</p>
<p>models for a particular purpose of interacting as an agent with the world and getting certain results.</p>
<p>But the intelligence itself is in the sense instrumental to something, but by itself it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just the ability to make models. And some of the problems are so general that the system that makes</p>
<p>them needs to understand what itself is and how it relates to the environment. So as a child,</p>
<p>for instance, you notice you do certain things despite you perceiving yourself as wanting</p>
<p>different things. So you become aware of your own psychology. You become aware of the fact that you</p>
<p>have complex structure in yourself and you need to model yourself, to reverse engineer yourself,</p>
<p>to be able to predict how you will react to certain situations and how you deal with yourself</p>
<p>in relationship to your environment. And this process, this project, if you reverse engineer</p>
<p>yourself and your relationship to reality and the nature of a universe that can continue, if you go</p>
<p>all the way, this is basically the project of AI, or you could say the project of AI is a very</p>
<p>important component in it. The Turing test, in a way, is you ask a system, what is intelligence?</p>
<p>If that system is able to explain what it is, how it works, then you should assign it the property</p>
<p>of being intelligent in this general sense. So the test that Turing was administering</p>
<p>in a way, I don&rsquo;t think that he couldn&rsquo;t see it, but he didn&rsquo;t express it yet in the original 1950</p>
<p>paper, is that he was trying to find out whether he was generally intelligent. Because in order to</p>
<p>take this test, the rub is, of course, you need to be able to understand what that system is saying.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t yet know if we can build an AI. We don&rsquo;t yet know if we are generally intelligent.</p>
<p>Basically, you win the Turing test by building an AI. Yes. So in a sense, hidden within the Turing</p>
<p>test is a kind of recursive test. Yes, it&rsquo;s a test on us. The Turing test is basically</p>
<p>a test of the conjecture, whether people are intelligent enough to understand themselves.</p>
<p>Okay. But you also mentioned a little bit of a self awareness and then the project of AI.</p>
<p>Do you think this kind of emergent self awareness is one of the fundamental aspects of intelligence?</p>
<p>So as opposed to goal oriented, as you said, kind of puzzle solving, is</p>
<p>coming to grips with the idea that you&rsquo;re an agent in the world.</p>
<p>I find that many highly intelligent people are not very self aware, right? So self awareness</p>
<p>and intelligence are not the same thing. And you can also be self aware if you have good priors,</p>
<p>especially, without being especially intelligent. So you don&rsquo;t need to be very good at solving</p>
<p>puzzles if the system that you are already implements the solution.</p>
<p>But I do find intelligence, you kind of mentioned children, right? Is that the fundamental project</p>
<p>of AI is to create the learning system that&rsquo;s able to exist in the world. So you kind of drew</p>
<p>a difference between self awareness and intelligence. And yet you said that the self</p>
<p>awareness seems to be important for children. So I call this ability to make sense of the</p>
<p>world and your own place in it. So to make you able to understand what you&rsquo;re doing in this world,</p>
<p>sentience. And I would distinguish sentience from intelligence because sentience is</p>
<p>possessing certain classes of models. And intelligence is a way to get to these models</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t already have them. I see. So can you maybe pause a bit and try to</p>
<p>answer the question that we just said we may not be able to answer? And it might be a recursive</p>
<p>meta question of what is intelligence? I think that intelligence is the ability to make models.</p>
<p>So models. I think it&rsquo;s useful as examples. Very popular now. Neural networks form representations</p>
<p>of a large scale data set. They form models of those data sets. When you say models and look</p>
<p>at today&rsquo;s neural networks, what are the difference of how you&rsquo;re thinking about what is intelligent</p>
<p>in saying that intelligence is the process of making models? Two aspects to this question. One</p>
<p>is the representation. Is the representation adequate for the domain that we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>One is the representation. Is the representation adequate for the domain that we want to represent?</p>
<p>The other one is the type of the model that you arrive at adequate. So basically, are you</p>
<p>modeling the correct domain? I think in both of these cases, modern AI is lacking still. I think</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not saying anything new here. I&rsquo;m not criticizing the field. Most of the people that</p>
<p>design our paradigms are aware of that. One aspect that we&rsquo;re missing is unified learning.</p>
<p>When we learn, we at some point discover that everything that we sense is part of the same</p>
<p>object, which means we learn it all into one model and we call this model the universe.</p>
<p>So the experience of the world that we are embedded on is not a secret direct via to physical</p>
<p>reality. Physical reality is a weird quantum graph that we can never experience or get access to.</p>
<p>But it has these properties that it can create certain patterns that are systemic interface to</p>
<p>the world. And we make sense of these patterns and the relationship between the patterns that</p>
<p>we discover is what we call the physical universe. So at some point in our development as a nervous</p>
<p>system, we discover that everything that we relate to in the world can be mapped to a region in the</p>
<p>same three dimensional space, by and large. We now know in physics that this is not quite true.</p>
<p>The world is not actually three dimensional, but the world that we are entangled with at the level</p>
<p>which we are entangled with is largely a flat three dimensional space. And so this is the</p>
<p>model that our brain is intuitively making. And this is, I think, what gave rise to this intuition</p>
<p>of res extensa of this material world, this material domain. It&rsquo;s one of the mental domains,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the class of all models that relate to this environment, this three dimensional</p>
<p>physics engine in which we are embedded. Physics engine which we&rsquo;re embedded. I love that. Just</p>
<p>slowly pause. So the quantum graph, I think you called it, which is the real world, which you</p>
<p>can never get access to, there&rsquo;s a bunch of questions I want to sort of disentangle that.</p>
<p>But maybe one useful one, one of your recent talks I looked at, can you just describe the basics?</p>
<p>Can you talk about what is dualism? What is idealism? What is materialism? What is functionalism?</p>
<p>And what connects with you most in terms of, because you just mentioned there&rsquo;s a reality</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have access to. Okay. What does that even mean? And why don&rsquo;t we get access to it?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t we part of that reality? Why can&rsquo;t we access it? So the particular trajectory that</p>
<p>mostly exists in the West is the result of our indoctrination by a cult for 2000 years.</p>
<p>A cult? Which one? Oh, 2000 years. The Catholic cult mostly. And for better or worse,</p>
<p>it has created or defined many of the modes of interaction that we have that has created</p>
<p>the society. But it has also in some sense scarred our rationality. And the intuition that exists,</p>
<p>if you would translate the mythology of the Catholic church into the modern world is that</p>
<p>the world in which you and me interact is something like a multiplayer role playing adventure. And the</p>
<p>money and the objects that we have in this world, this is all not real. Or as Eastern philosophers</p>
<p>would say, it&rsquo;s Maya. It&rsquo;s just stuff that appears to be meaningful. And this embedding in this</p>
<p>meaning, if you believe in it, is samsara. It&rsquo;s basically the identification with the needs of</p>
<p>the mundane, secular, everyday existence. And the Catholics also introduced the notion of</p>
<p>higher meaning, the sacred. And this existed before, but eventually the natural shape of God</p>
<p>is the Platonic form of the civilization that you&rsquo;re part of. It&rsquo;s basically the superorganism</p>
<p>that is formed by the individuals as an intentional agent. And basically, the Catholics</p>
<p>used a relatively crude mythology to implement software on the minds of people and get the</p>
<p>software synchronized to make them walk on lockstep, to basically get this God online</p>
<p>and to make it efficient and effective. And I think God technically is just a self that</p>
<p>spends multiple brains as opposed to your and my self, which mostly exists just on one brain.</p>
<p>Right? And so in some sense, you can construct a self functionally as a function is implemented</p>
<p>by brains that exists across brains. And this is a God with a small g.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the, if you, Yuval Harari kind of talking about,</p>
<p>this is one of the nice features of our brains. It seems to that we can</p>
<p>all download the same piece of software like God in this case and kind of share it.</p>
<p>Yeah. So basically you give everybody a spec and the mathematical constraints</p>
<p>that are intrinsic to information processing,</p>
<p>make sure that given the same spec, you come up with a compatible structure.</p>
<p>Okay. So that&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s the space of ideas that we all share. And we think that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of the mind, but that&rsquo;s separate from the idea is from Christianity for,</p>
<p>from religion is that there&rsquo;s a separate thing between the mind.</p>
<p>There is a real world. And this real world is the world in which God exists.</p>
<p>God is the coder of the multiplayer adventure, so to speak. And we are all players in this game.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s dualism.</p>
<p>Yes. But the aspect is because the mental realm exists in a different implementation</p>
<p>than the physical realm. And the mental realm is real. And a lot of people have this intuition</p>
<p>that there is this real room in which you and me talk and speak right now, then comes a layer of</p>
<p>physics and abstract rules and so on. And then comes another real room where our souls are</p>
<p>and our true form isn&rsquo;t a thing that gives us phenomenal experience. And this is, of course,</p>
<p>a very confused notion that you would get. And it&rsquo;s basically, it&rsquo;s the result of connecting</p>
<p>materialism and idealism in the wrong way.</p>
<p>So, okay. I apologize, but I think it&rsquo;s really helpful if we just try to define,</p>
<p>try to define terms. Like what is dualism? What is idealism? What is materialism? For</p>
<p>people that don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So the idea of dualism in our cultural tradition is that there are two substances, a mental</p>
<p>substance and a physical substance. And they interact by different rules. And the physical</p>
<p>world is basically causally closed and is built on a low level causal structure. So</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically a bottom level that is causally closed. That&rsquo;s entirely mechanical</p>
<p>and mechanical in the widest sense. So it&rsquo;s computational. There&rsquo;s basically a physical</p>
<p>world in which information flows around and physics describes the laws of how information</p>
<p>flows around in this world.</p>
<p>Would you compare it to like a computer where you have hardware and software?</p>
<p>The computer is a generalization of information flowing around. Basically,</p>
<p>but if you want to discover that there is a universal principle, you can define this</p>
<p>universal machine that is able to perform all the computations. So all these machines</p>
<p>have the same power. This means that you can always define a translation between them,</p>
<p>as long as they have unlimited memory to be able to perform each other&rsquo;s computations.</p>
<p>So would you then say that materialism is this whole world is just the hardware and</p>
<p>idealism is this whole world is just the software?</p>
<p>Not quite. I think that most idealists don&rsquo;t have a notion of software yet because software</p>
<p>also comes down to information processing. So what you notice is the only thing that</p>
<p>is real to you and me is this experiential world in which things matter, in which things</p>
<p>have taste, in which things have color, phenomenal content, and so on.</p>
<p>You are bringing up consciousness. Okay.</p>
<p>This is distinct from the physical world in which things have values only in an abstract</p>
<p>sense. And you only look at cold patterns moving around. So how does anything feel like</p>
<p>something? And this connection between the two things is very puzzling to a lot of people,</p>
<p>of course, too many philosophers. So idealism starts out with the notion that mind is primary,</p>
<p>materialism, things that matter is primary. And so for the idealist, the material patterns that</p>
<p>we see playing out are part of the dream that the mind is dreaming. And we exist in a mind</p>
<p>on a higher plane of existence, if you want. And for the materialist, there is only this</p>
<p>material thing, and that generates some models, and we are the result of these models. And in</p>
<p>some sense, I don&rsquo;t think that we should understand, if we understand it properly,</p>
<p>materialism and idealism as a dichotomy, but as two different aspects of the same thing.</p>
<p>So the weird thing is we don&rsquo;t exist in the physical world. We do exist inside of a story</p>
<p>that the brain tells itself. Okay. Let my information processing take that in.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t exist in the physical world. We exist in the narrative.</p>
<p>Basically, a brain cannot feel anything. A neuron cannot feel anything. They&rsquo;re physical</p>
<p>things. Physical systems are unable to experience anything. But it would be very useful for the</p>
<p>brain or for the organism to know what it would be like to be a person and to feel something.</p>
<p>Yeah. So the brain creates a simulacrum of such a person that it uses to model the interactions</p>
<p>of the person. It&rsquo;s the best model of what that brain, this organism thinks it is in relationship</p>
<p>to its environment. So it creates that model. It&rsquo;s a story, a multimedia novel that the brain</p>
<p>is continuously writing and updating. But you also kind of said that</p>
<p>you said that we kind of exist in that story. Yes.</p>
<p>In that story. What is real in any of this? So again, these terms are&hellip; You kind of said</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a quantum graph. I mean, what is this whole thing running on then? Is the story&hellip;</p>
<p>And is it completely fundamentally impossible to get access to it? Because isn&rsquo;t the story</p>
<p>supposed to&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t the brain in something existing in some kind of context?</p>
<p>So what we can identify as computer scientists, we can engineer systems and test our theories this</p>
<p>way that might have the necessary insufficient properties to produce the phenomena that we are</p>
<p>observing, which is the self in a virtual world that is generated in somebody&rsquo;s neocortex that is</p>
<p>contained in the skull of this primate here. And when I point at this, this indexicality is of</p>
<p>course wrong. But I do create something that is likely to give rise to patterns on your retina</p>
<p>that allow you to interpret what I&rsquo;m saying. But we both know that the world that you and me are</p>
<p>seeing is not the real physical world. What we are seeing is a virtual reality generated in your</p>
<p>brain to explain the patterns on your retina. How close is it to the real world? That&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of the question. Is it when you have people like Donald Hoffman that say that you&rsquo;re really far</p>
<p>away. The thing we&rsquo;re seeing, you and I now, that interface we have is very far away from anything.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even have anything close to the sense of what the real world is. Or is it a very surface</p>
<p>piece of architecture? I imagine you look at the Mandelbrot fractal, this famous thing that</p>
<p>Bernard Mandelbrot discovered. You see an overall shape in there. But if you truly understand it,</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s two lines of code. It&rsquo;s basically in a series that is being tested for complex</p>
<p>numbers in the complex number plane for every point. And for those where the series is diverging,</p>
<p>you paint this black. And where it&rsquo;s converging, you don&rsquo;t. And you get the intermediate colors</p>
<p>by taking how far it diverges. This gives you this shape of this fractal. But imagine you live</p>
<p>inside of this fractal and you don&rsquo;t have access to where you are in the fractal. Or you have not</p>
<p>discovered the generator function even. So what you see is, all I can see right now is a spiral.</p>
<p>And this spiral moves a little bit to the right. Is this an accurate model of reality? Yes, it is.</p>
<p>It is an adequate description. You know that there is actually no spiral in the Mandelbrot fractal.</p>
<p>It only appears like this to an observer that is interpreting things as a two dimensional space and</p>
<p>then defines certain regularities in there at a certain scale that it currently observes. Because</p>
<p>if you zoom in, the spiral might disappear and turn out to be something different at a different</p>
<p>resolution. So at this level, you have the spiral. And then you discover the spiral moves to the</p>
<p>right and at some point it disappears. So you have a singularity. At this point, your model is no</p>
<p>longer valid. You cannot predict what happens beyond the singularity. But you can observe again</p>
<p>and you will see it hit another spiral and at this point it disappeared. So we now have a second</p>
<p>order law. And if you make 30 layers of these laws, then you have a description of the world</p>
<p>that is similar to the one that we come up with when we describe the reality around us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reasonably predictive. It does not cut to the core of it. It does not explain how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being generated, how it actually works. But it&rsquo;s relatively good to explain the universe that we</p>
<p>are entangled with. But you don&rsquo;t think the tools of computer science, the tools of physics could</p>
<p>get, could step outside, see the whole drawing and get at the basic mechanism of how the pattern,</p>
<p>the spirals are generated. Imagine you would find yourself embedded into a motherboard fractal and</p>
<p>you try to figure out what works and you somehow have a Turing machine with enough memory to think.</p>
<p>And as a result, you come to this idea, it must be some kind of automaton. And maybe you just</p>
<p>enumerate all the possible automata until you get to the one that produces your reality.</p>
<p>So you can identify necessary and sufficient condition. For instance,</p>
<p>we discover that mathematics itself is the domain of all languages. And then we see that most of</p>
<p>the domains of mathematics that we have discovered are in some sense describing the same fractals.</p>
<p>This is what category theory is obsessed about, that you can map these different domains to each</p>
<p>other. So they&rsquo;re not that many fractals. And some of these have interesting structure and</p>
<p>symmetry breaks. And so you can discover what region of this global fractal you might be embedded</p>
<p>in from first principles. But the only way you can get there is from first principles. So basically</p>
<p>your understanding of the universe has to start with automata and then number theory and then</p>
<p>spaces and so on. Yeah. I think like Stephen Wolfram still dreams that he&rsquo;ll be able to arrive</p>
<p>at the fundamental rules of the cellular automata or the generalization of which</p>
<p>is behind our universe. Yeah. You&rsquo;ve said on this topic, you said in a recent conversation</p>
<p>that quote, some people think that a simulation can&rsquo;t be conscious and only a physical system can,</p>
<p>but they got it completely backward. A physical system cannot be conscious. Only a simulation can</p>
<p>be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property that simulates itself. Just like you said,</p>
<p>the mind is kind of the, we&rsquo;ll call it story narrative. There&rsquo;s a simulation. So our mind</p>
<p>is essentially a simulation. Usually I try to use the terminology so that the mind is basically</p>
<p>a principles that produce the simulation. It&rsquo;s the software that is implemented by your brain.</p>
<p>And the mind is creating both the universe that we are in and the self, the idea of a person that</p>
<p>is on the other side of attention and is embedded in this world. Why is that important that</p>
<p>idea of a self, why is that an important feature in the simulation? It&rsquo;s basically a result of</p>
<p>the purpose that the mind has. It&rsquo;s a tool for modeling, right? We are not actually monkeys. We</p>
<p>are side effects of the regulation needs of monkeys. And what the monkey has to regulate is</p>
<p>the relationship of an organism to an outside world that is in large part also consisting of</p>
<p>other organisms. And as a result, it basically has regulation targets that it tries to get to.</p>
<p>These regulation targets start with priors. They&rsquo;re basically like unconditional reflexes</p>
<p>that we are more or less born with. And then we can reverse engineer them to make them more</p>
<p>consistent. And then we get more detailed models about how the world works and how to interact with</p>
<p>it. And so these priors that you commit to are largely target values that our needs should</p>
<p>approach set points. And this deviation to the set point creates some urge, some tension. And we find</p>
<p>ourselves living inside of feedback loops, right? Consciousness emerges over dimensions of</p>
<p>disagreements with the universe, things that you care, things are not the way they should be,</p>
<p>but you need to regulate. And so in some sense, the sense self is the result of all the</p>
<p>identifications that you&rsquo;re having. And that identification is a regulation target that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re committing to. It&rsquo;s a dimension that you care about, you think is important. And this is</p>
<p>also what locks you in. If you let go of these commitments, of these identifications, you get</p>
<p>free. There&rsquo;s nothing that you have to do anymore. And if you let go of all of them, you&rsquo;re completely</p>
<p>free and you can enter nirvana because you&rsquo;re done. And actually, this is a good time to pause and say</p>
<p>thank you to a friend of mine, Gustav Soderstr√∂m, who introduced me to your work. I wanted to give</p>
<p>him a shout out. He&rsquo;s a brilliant guy. And I think the AI community is actually quite amazing. And</p>
<p>Gustav is a good representative of that. You are as well. So I&rsquo;m glad, first of all, I&rsquo;m glad the</p>
<p>internet exists, YouTube exists, where I can watch your talks and then get to your book and study</p>
<p>your writing and think about, you know, that&rsquo;s amazing. Okay. But you&rsquo;ve kind of described</p>
<p>sort of this emergent phenomenon of consciousness from the simulation. So what about the hard</p>
<p>problem of consciousness? Can you just linger on it? Why does it still feel like, I understand</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of, the self is an important part of the simulation, but why does the simulation</p>
<p>feel like something? So if you look at a book by, say, George R. R. Martin, where the characters</p>
<p>have plausible psychology and they stand on a hill because they want to conquer the city below</p>
<p>the hill and they&rsquo;re done in it. And they look at the color of the sky and they are apprehensive</p>
<p>and feel empowered and all these things. Why do they have these emotions? It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>written into the story, right? And it&rsquo;s written to the story because there&rsquo;s an adequate model of the</p>
<p>person that predicts what they&rsquo;re going to do next. And the same thing is true for us. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically a story that our brain is writing. It&rsquo;s not written in words. It&rsquo;s written in perceptual</p>
<p>content, basically multimedia content. And it&rsquo;s a model of what the person would feel if it existed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a virtual person. And you and me happen to be this virtual person. So this virtual person</p>
<p>gets access to the language center and talks about the sky being blue. And this is us.</p>
<p>But hold on a second. Do I exist in your simulation?</p>
<p>You do exist in an almost similar way as me. So there are internal states that are less</p>
<p>accessible for me that you have and so on. And my model might not be completely adequate.</p>
<p>There are also things that I might perceive about you that you don&rsquo;t perceive. But in some sense,</p>
<p>both you and me are some puppets, two puppets that enact a play in my mind. And I identify</p>
<p>with one of them because I can control one of the puppets directly. And with the other one,</p>
<p>I can create things in between. So for instance, we can go on an interaction that even leads to</p>
<p>a coupling to a feedback loop. So we can think things together in a certain way or feel things</p>
<p>together. But this coupling is itself not a physical phenomenon. It&rsquo;s entirely a software</p>
<p>phenomenon. It&rsquo;s the result of two different implementations interacting with each other.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting. So are you suggesting, like the way you think about it, is the entirety</p>
<p>of existence a simulation and where kind of each mind is a little subsimulation,</p>
<p>that like, why don&rsquo;t you, why doesn&rsquo;t your mind have access to my mind&rsquo;s full state?</p>
<p>Like, for the same reason that my mind doesn&rsquo;t have access to its own full state.</p>
<p>So what, I mean,</p>
<p>There is no trick involved. So basically, when I know something about myself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I made a model. So one part of your brain is tasked with modeling what other parts of</p>
<p>your brain are doing.</p>
<p>Yes. But there seems to be an incredible consistency about this world in the physical</p>
<p>sense that there&rsquo;s repeatable experiments and so on. How does that fit into our silly,</p>
<p>the center of apes simulation of the world? So why is it so repeatable? Why is everything so</p>
<p>repeatable? And not everything. There&rsquo;s a lot of fundamental physics experiments that are repeatable</p>
<p>for a long time, all over the place and so on. Laws of physics. How does that fit in?</p>
<p>It seems that the parts of the world that are not deterministic are not long lived.</p>
<p>So if you build a system, any kind of automaton, so if you build simulations of something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that the phenomena that endure are those that give rise to stable dynamics.</p>
<p>So basically, if you see anything that is complex in the world, it&rsquo;s the result of usually of some</p>
<p>control of some feedback that keeps it stable around certain attractors. And the things that</p>
<p>are not stable that don&rsquo;t give rise to certain harmonic patterns and so on, they tend to get</p>
<p>weeded out over time. So if we are in a region of the universe that sustains complexity, which is</p>
<p>required to implement minds like ours, this is going to be a region of the universe that is very</p>
<p>tightly controlled and controllable. So it&rsquo;s going to have lots of interesting symmetries and also</p>
<p>symmetry breaks that allow the creation of structure. But they exist where? So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such an interesting idea that our mind is simulation that&rsquo;s constructing the narrative.</p>
<p>But my question is, just to try to understand how that fits with this, with the entirety of the</p>
<p>universe, you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s a region of this universe that allows enough complexity to</p>
<p>create creatures like us. But what&rsquo;s the connection between the brain, the mind, and the broader</p>
<p>universe? Which comes first? Which is more fundamental? Is the mind the starting point,</p>
<p>the universe is emergent? Is the universe the starting point, the minds are emergent?</p>
<p>I think quite clearly the latter. That&rsquo;s at least a much easier explanation because it allows us to</p>
<p>make causal models. And I don&rsquo;t see any way to construct an inverse causality.</p>
<p>So what happens when you die to your mind simulation?</p>
<p>My implementation ceases. So basically the thing that implements myself will no longer be present,</p>
<p>which means if I am not implemented on the minds of other people, the thing that I identify with,</p>
<p>the weird thing is I don&rsquo;t actually have an identity beyond the identity that I construct.</p>
<p>If I was the Dalai Lama, he identifies as a form of government. So basically the Dalai Lama gets</p>
<p>reborn, not because he&rsquo;s confused, but because he is not identifying as a human being. He runs on</p>
<p>a human being. He&rsquo;s basically a governmental software that is instantiated in every new</p>
<p>generation and you. So his advice is to pick someone who does this in the next generation.</p>
<p>So if you identify with this, you are no longer a human and you don&rsquo;t die in the sense that what</p>
<p>dies is only the body of the human that you run on. To kill the Dalai Lama, you would have to kill</p>
<p>his tradition. And if we look at ourselves, we realize that we are to a small part like this,</p>
<p>most of us. So for instance, if you have children, you realize something lives on in them. Or if you</p>
<p>spark an idea in the world, something lives on, or if you identify with the society around you,</p>
<p>because you are in part that you&rsquo;re not just this human being.</p>
<p>Yeah. So in a sense, you are kind of like a Dalai Lama in the sense that you,</p>
<p>Joshua Bach, is just a collection of ideas. So like you have this operating system on which</p>
<p>a bunch of ideas live and interact. And then once you die, they kind of part, some of them</p>
<p>jump off the ship.</p>
<p>You put it put it the other way. Identity is a software state. It&rsquo;s a construction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not physically real. Identity is not a physical concept.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a representation of different objects on the same world line.</p>
<p>But identity lives and dies. Are you attached? What&rsquo;s the fundamental thing? Is it the ideas</p>
<p>that come together to form identity? Or is each individual identity actually a fundamental thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a representation that you can get agency over if you care. So basically,</p>
<p>you can choose what you identify with if you want to.</p>
<p>No, but it just seems if the mind is not real, that the birth and death is not a crucial part</p>
<p>of it. Well, maybe I&rsquo;m silly. Maybe I&rsquo;m attached to this whole biological organism. But it seems</p>
<p>that being a physical object in this world is an important aspect of birth and death.</p>
<p>Like it feels like it has to be physical to die. It feels like simulations don&rsquo;t have to die.</p>
<p>The physics that we experience is not the real physics. There is no color and sound in the real</p>
<p>world. Color and sound are types of representations that you get if you want to model reality with</p>
<p>oscillators. So colors and sound in some sense have octaves, and it&rsquo;s because they are represented</p>
<p>probably with oscillators. So that&rsquo;s why colors form a circle of use. And colors have harmonics,</p>
<p>sounds have harmonics as a result of synchronizing oscillators in the brain. So the world that we</p>
<p>subjectively interact with is fundamentally the result of the representation mechanisms in our</p>
<p>brain. They are mathematically to some degree universal. There are certain regularities that</p>
<p>you can discover in the patterns and not others. But the patterns that we get, this is not the real</p>
<p>world. The world that we interact with is always made of too many parts to count. So when you look</p>
<p>at this table and so on, it&rsquo;s consisting of so many molecules and atoms that you cannot count</p>
<p>them. So you only look at the aggregate dynamics, at limit dynamics. If you had almost infinitely</p>
<p>many particles, what would be the dynamics of the table? And this is roughly what you get. So</p>
<p>geometry that we are interacting with is the result of discovering those operators that</p>
<p>work in the limit that you get by building an infinite series that converges. For those parts</p>
<p>where it converges, it&rsquo;s geometry. For those parts where it doesn&rsquo;t converge, it&rsquo;s chaos.</p>
<p>Right. And then so all of that is filtered through the consciousness that&rsquo;s emergent in our</p>
<p>narrative. The consciousness gives it color, gives it feeling, gives it flavor.</p>
<p>So I think the feeling, flavor and so on is given by the relationship that a feature has to all the</p>
<p>other features. It&rsquo;s basically a giant relational graph that is our subjective universe. The color</p>
<p>is given by those aspects of the representation or this experiential color where you care about,</p>
<p>where you have identifications, where something means something, where you are the inside of a</p>
<p>feedback loop. And the dimensions of caring are basically dimensions of this motivational system</p>
<p>that we emerge over. The meaning of the relations, the graph. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?</p>
<p>Like where does the, maybe we can even step back and ask the question of what is consciousness to</p>
<p>be sort of more systematic. Like what do you, how do you think about consciousness?</p>
<p>I think that consciousness is largely a model of the contents of your attention. It&rsquo;s a mechanism</p>
<p>that has evolved for a certain type of learning. At the moment, our machine learning systems</p>
<p>largely work by building chains of weighted sums of real numbers with some nonlinearity.</p>
<p>And you learn by piping an error signal through these different chained layers and adjusting the</p>
<p>weights in these weighted sums. And you can approximate most polynomials with this</p>
<p>if you have enough training data. But the price is you need to change a lot of these weights.</p>
<p>Basically, the error is piped backwards into the system until it accumulates at certain junctures</p>
<p>in the network. And everything else evens out statistically. And only at these junctures,</p>
<p>this is where you had the actual error in the network, you make the change there. This is a</p>
<p>very slow process. And our brains don&rsquo;t have enough time for that because we don&rsquo;t get old</p>
<p>enough to play Go the way that our machines learn to play Go. So instead, what we do is</p>
<p>an attention based learning. We pinpoint the probable region in the network where we can</p>
<p>make an improvement. And then we store this binding state together with the expected outcome</p>
<p>in a protocol. And this ability to make index memories for the purpose of learning to revisit</p>
<p>these commitments later, this requires a memory of the contents of our attention.</p>
<p>Another aspect is when I construct my reality, I make mistakes. So I see things that turn out to</p>
<p>be reflections or shadows and so on, which means I have to be able to point out which features of</p>
<p>my perception gave rise to a present construction of reality. So the system needs to pay attention to</p>
<p>the features that are currently in its focus. And it also needs to pay attention to whether</p>
<p>it pays attention itself, in part because the attentional system gets trained with the same</p>
<p>mechanism, so it&rsquo;s reflexive, but also in part because your attention lapses if you don&rsquo;t pay</p>
<p>attention to the attention itself. So it&rsquo;s the thing that I&rsquo;m currently seeing, just a dream</p>
<p>that my brain has spun off into some kind of daydream, or am I still paying attention to my</p>
<p>percept? So you have to periodically go back and see whether you&rsquo;re still paying attention. And</p>
<p>if you have this loop and you make it tight enough between the system becoming aware of the contents</p>
<p>of its attention and the fact that it&rsquo;s paying attention itself and makes attention the object</p>
<p>of its attention, I think this is the loop over which we wake up. So there&rsquo;s this attentional</p>
<p>mechanism that&rsquo;s somehow self referential that&rsquo;s fundamental to what consciousness is. So just</p>
<p>ask you a question, I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;re familiar with the recent breakthroughs in natural</p>
<p>language processing, they use attentional mechanism, they use something called transformers to</p>
<p>learn patterns and sentences by allowing the network to focus its attention to particular</p>
<p>parts of the sentence and each individual. So like parameterize and make it learnable</p>
<p>the dynamics of a sentence by having like a little window into the sentence. Do you think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a little step towards that eventually will take us to the attentional mechanisms from</p>
<p>which consciousness can emerge? Not quite. I think it models only one aspect of attention.</p>
<p>In the early days of automated language translation, there was an example that I</p>
<p>found particularly funny where somebody tried to translate a text from English into German</p>
<p>and it was a bat broke the window. And the translation in German was</p>
<p>to translate back into English a bat, this flying mammal broke the window with a baseball bat.</p>
<p>Yes. And it seemed to be the</p>
<p>most similar to this program because it somehow maximized the possibility of translating the</p>
<p>concept bat into German in the same sentence. And this is a mistake that the transformer model is</p>
<p>not doing because it&rsquo;s tracking identity. And the attentional mechanism in the transformer</p>
<p>model is basically putting its finger on individual concepts and make sure that these concepts pop up</p>
<p>later in the text and tracks basically the individuals through the text. And it&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>the system can learn things that other systems couldn&rsquo;t before it, which makes it, for instance,</p>
<p>possible to write a text where it talks about the scientist, then the scientist has a name</p>
<p>and has a pronoun and it gets a consistent story about that thing. What it does not do,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t fully integrate this. So this meaning falls apart at some point, it loses track of this</p>
<p>context. It does not yet understand that everything that it says has to refer to the same universe.</p>
<p>And this is where this thing falls apart. But the attention in the transformer model does not go</p>
<p>beyond tracking identity. And tracking identity is an important part of attention, but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>different, very specific attentional mechanism. And it&rsquo;s not the one that gives rise to the type</p>
<p>of consciousness that we have. Just to linger on, what do you mean by</p>
<p>identity in the context of language? So when you talk about language,</p>
<p>you have different words that can refer to the same concept.</p>
<p>Got it. And in the sense that&hellip;</p>
<p>The space of concepts. So&hellip; Yes. And it can also be in a nominal sense</p>
<p>or in an inexical sense that you say this word does not only refer to this class of objects,</p>
<p>but it refers to a definite object, to some kind of agent that waves their way through the story.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only referred by different ways in the language. So the language is basically a</p>
<p>projection from a conceptual representation from a scene that is evolving into a discrete string</p>
<p>of symbols. And what the transformer is able to do, it learns aspects of this projection</p>
<p>mechanism that other models couldn&rsquo;t learn. So have you ever seen an artificial intelligence</p>
<p>or any kind of construction idea that allows for, unlike neural networks or perhaps within</p>
<p>neural networks, that&rsquo;s able to form something where the space of concepts continues to be</p>
<p>integrated? So what you&rsquo;re describing, building a knowledge base, building this consistent,</p>
<p>larger and larger sets of ideas that would then allow for deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein thought that we can build everything from language,</p>
<p>from basically a logical grammatical construct. And I think to some degree,</p>
<p>this was also what Minsky believed. So that&rsquo;s why he focused so much on common sense reasoning and</p>
<p>so on. And a project that was inspired by him was Psych. That was basically going on.</p>
<p>Yes. Of course, ideas don&rsquo;t die. Only people die.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And Alt Psych is a productive project. It&rsquo;s just probably not one that is going to</p>
<p>converge to general intelligence. The thing that Wittgenstein couldn&rsquo;t solve,</p>
<p>and he looked at this in his book at the end of his life, Philosophical Investigations,</p>
<p>was the notion of images. So images play an important role in Tractatus. The Tractatus is</p>
<p>an attempt to basically turn philosophy into logical probing language, to design a logical</p>
<p>language in which you can do actual philosophy that&rsquo;s rich enough for doing this. And the</p>
<p>difficulty was to deal with perceptual content. And eventually, I think he decided that he was</p>
<p>not able to solve it. And I think this preempted the failure of the logitist program in AI.</p>
<p>And the solution, as we see it today, is we need more general function approximation. There are</p>
<p>geometric functions that we learn to approximate that cannot be efficiently expressed and computed</p>
<p>in a grammatical language. We can, of course, build automata that go via number theory and so on</p>
<p>to learn in algebra and then compute an approximation of this geometry.</p>
<p>But to equate language and geometry is not an efficient way to think about it.</p>
<p>So function, well, you kind of just said that neural networks are sort of, the approach that</p>
<p>neural networks takes is actually more general than what can be expressed through language.</p>
<p>Yes. So what can be efficiently expressed through language at the data rates at which</p>
<p>we process grammatical language?</p>
<p>Okay. So you don&rsquo;t think languages, so you disagree with Wittgenstein,</p>
<p>that language is not fundamental to&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree with Wittgenstein. I just agree with the late Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>And I also agree with the beauty of the early Wittgenstein. I think that the Tractatus itself</p>
<p>is probably the most beautiful philosophical text that was written in the 20th century.</p>
<p>But language is not fundamental to cognition and intelligence and consciousness.</p>
<p>So I think that language is a particular way or the natural language that we&rsquo;re using is a</p>
<p>particular level of abstraction that we use to communicate with each other. But the languages</p>
<p>in which we express geometry are not grammatical languages in the same sense. So they work slightly</p>
<p>differently, more general expressions of functions. And I think the general nature of a model is you</p>
<p>have a bunch of parameters. These have a range, these are the variances of the world, and you have</p>
<p>relationships between them, which are constraints, which say if certain parameters have these values,</p>
<p>then other parameters have to have the following values. And this is a very early insight in</p>
<p>computer science. And I think some of the earliest formulations is the Boltzmann machine.</p>
<p>And the problem with the Boltzmann machine is that it has a measure of whether it&rsquo;s good. This</p>
<p>is basically the energy on the system, the amount of tension that you have left in the constraints</p>
<p>where the constraints don&rsquo;t quite match. It&rsquo;s very difficult to, despite having this global</p>
<p>measure, to train it. Because as soon as you add more than trivially few elements,</p>
<p>parameters into the system, it&rsquo;s very difficult to get it settled in the right architecture.</p>
<p>And so the solution that Hinton and Zanofsky found was to use a restricted Boltzmann machine,</p>
<p>which uses the hidden links, the internal links in the Boltzmann machine and only has</p>
<p>basically input and output layer. But this limits the expressivity of the Boltzmann machine. So now</p>
<p>he builds a network of these primitive Boltzmann machines. And in some sense, you can see almost</p>
<p>continuous development from this to the deep learning models that we&rsquo;re using today,</p>
<p>even though we don&rsquo;t use Boltzmann machines at this point. But the idea of the Boltzmann</p>
<p>machine is you take this model, you clamp some of the values to perception, and this forces</p>
<p>the entire machine to go into a state that is compatible with the states that you currently</p>
<p>perceive. And this state is your model of the world. I think it&rsquo;s a very general way of thinking</p>
<p>about models, but we have to use a different approach to make it work. We have to find</p>
<p>different networks that train the Boltzmann machine. So the mechanism that trains the Boltzmann</p>
<p>machine and the mechanism that makes the Boltzmann machine settle into its state</p>
<p>are distinct from the constrained architecture of the Boltzmann machine itself.</p>
<p>The kind of mechanisms that we want to develop, you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Yes. So the direction in which I think our research is going to go</p>
<p>is going to, for instance, what you notice in perception is our perceptual models of the world</p>
<p>are not probabilistic, but possibilistic, which means you should be able to perceive things that</p>
<p>are improbable, but possible. A perceptual state is valid, not if it&rsquo;s probable, but if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible, if it&rsquo;s coherent. So if you see a tiger coming after you, you should be able to see this</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s unlikely. And the probability is necessary for convergence of the model. So</p>
<p>given the state of possibilities that is very, very large and a set of perceptual features,</p>
<p>how should you change the states of the model to get it to converge with your perception?</p>
<p>But the space of ideas that are coherent with the context that you&rsquo;re sensing</p>
<p>is perhaps not as large. I mean, that&rsquo;s perhaps pretty small.</p>
<p>The degree of coherence that you need to achieve depends, of course, how deep your models go.</p>
<p>That is, for instance, politics is very simple when you know very little about game theory and</p>
<p>human nature. So the younger you are, the more obvious it is how politics would work, right?</p>
<p>And because you get a coherent aesthetics from relatively few inputs. And the more layers you</p>
<p>model, the more layers you model reality, the harder it gets to satisfy all the constraints.</p>
<p>So, you know, the current neural networks are fundamentally supervised learning system with</p>
<p>a feed forward neural network is back propagation to learn. What&rsquo;s your intuition about what kind</p>
<p>of mechanisms might we move towards to improve the learning procedure?</p>
<p>I think one big aspect is going to be meta learning and architecture search starts in</p>
<p>this direction. In some sense, the first wave of classical AI work by identifying a problem</p>
<p>and a possible solution and implementing the solution, right? A program that plays chess.</p>
<p>And right now we are in the second wave of AI. So instead of writing the algorithm that</p>
<p>implements the solution, we write an algorithm that automatically searches</p>
<p>for an algorithm that implements the solution. So the learning system in some sense is an</p>
<p>algorithm that itself discovers the algorithm that solves the problem, like Go. Go is too hard</p>
<p>to implement the solution by hand, but we can implement an algorithm that finds the solution.</p>
<p>Yeah. So now let&rsquo;s move to the third stage, right? The third stage would be meta learning.</p>
<p>Find an algorithm that discovers a learning algorithm for the given domain.</p>
<p>Our brain is probably not a learning system, but a meta learning system.</p>
<p>This is one way of looking at what we are doing. There is another way. If you look at the way our</p>
<p>brain is, for instance, implemented, there is no central control that tells all the neurons how</p>
<p>to wire up. Instead, every neuron is an individual reinforcement learning agent. Every neuron is a</p>
<p>single celled organism that is quite complicated and in some sense quite motivated to get fed.</p>
<p>And it gets fed if it fires on average at the right time. And the right time depends on the</p>
<p>context that the neuron exists in, which is the electrical and chemical environment that it has.</p>
<p>So it basically has to learn a function over its environment that tells us when to fire to get fed.</p>
<p>Or if you see it as a reinforcement learning agent, every neuron is in some sense making a</p>
<p>hypothesis when it sends a signal and tries to pipe a signal through the universe and tries to</p>
<p>get positive feedback for it. And the entire thing is set up in such a way that it&rsquo;s robustly</p>
<p>self organizing into a brain, which means you start out with different neuron types</p>
<p>that have different priors on which hypothesis to test and how to get its reward.</p>
<p>And you put them into different concentrations in a certain spatial alignment,</p>
<p>and then you entrain it in a particular order. And as a result, you get a well organized brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, so okay, so the brain is a meta learning system with a bunch of reinforcement learning</p>
<p>agents. And what I think you said, but just to clarify, there&rsquo;s no centralized government that</p>
<p>tells you, here&rsquo;s a loss function, here&rsquo;s a loss function, here&rsquo;s a loss function. Who says what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the objective? There are also governments which impose loss functions on different parts of the</p>
<p>brain. So we have differential attention. Some areas in your brain get specially rewarded when</p>
<p>you look at faces. If you don&rsquo;t have that, you will get prosopagnosia, which basically</p>
<p>the inability to tell people apart by their faces. And the reason that happens is because</p>
<p>it had an evolutionary advantage. So like evolution comes into play here. But it&rsquo;s basically an</p>
<p>extraordinary attention that we have for faces. I don&rsquo;t think that people with prosopagnosia have a</p>
<p>perceived defective brain, the brain just has an average attention for faces. So people with</p>
<p>prosopagnosia don&rsquo;t look at faces more than they look at cups. So the level at which they resolve</p>
<p>the geometry of faces is not higher than for cups. And people that don&rsquo;t have prosopagnosia look</p>
<p>obsessively at faces, right? For you and me, it&rsquo;s impossible to move through a crowd</p>
<p>without scanning the faces. And as a result, we make insanely detailed models of faces that allow</p>
<p>us to discern mental states of people. So obviously, we don&rsquo;t know 99% of the details</p>
<p>of this meta learning system. That&rsquo;s our mind. Okay. But still, we took a leap from something</p>
<p>much dumber to that from through the evolutionary process. Can you first of all, maybe say how hard</p>
<p>the, how big of a leap is that from our brain, from our ancestors to multi cell organisms? And</p>
<p>is there something we can think about? As we start to think about how to engineer intelligence,</p>
<p>is there something we can learn from evolution? In some sense, life exists because of the market</p>
<p>opportunity of controlled chemical reactions. We compete with dump chemical reactions and we win</p>
<p>in some areas against this dump combustion because we can harness those entropy gradients where you</p>
<p>need to add a little bit of energy in a specific way to harvest more energy. So we out competed</p>
<p>combustion. Yes, in many regions we do and we try very hard because when we are in direct</p>
<p>competition, we lose, right? So because the combustion is going to close the entropy</p>
<p>gradients much faster than we can run. So basically we do this because every cell has</p>
<p>a Turing machine built into it. It&rsquo;s like literally a read write head on the tape.</p>
<p>So everything that&rsquo;s more complicated than a molecule that just is a vortex around attractors</p>
<p>that needs a Turing machine for its regulation. And then you bind cells together and you get next</p>
<p>level organizational organism where the cells together implement some kind of software.</p>
<p>For me, a very interesting discovery in the last year was the word spirit because I realized that</p>
<p>what spirit actually means is an operating system for an autonomous robot. And when the word was</p>
<p>invented, people needed this word. But they didn&rsquo;t have robots that they built themselves yet. The</p>
<p>only autonomous robots that were known were people, animals, plants, ecosystems, cities,</p>
<p>and so on. And they all had spirits. And it makes sense to say that the plant has an operating</p>
<p>system, right? If you pinch the plant in one area, then it&rsquo;s going to have repercussions</p>
<p>throughout the plant. Everything in the plant is in some sense connected into some global aesthetics</p>
<p>like in other organisms. An organism is not a collection of cells, it&rsquo;s a function that</p>
<p>tells cells how to behave. And this function is not implemented as some kind of supernatural thing,</p>
<p>like some morphogenetic field. It is an emergent result of the interactions of each cell with each</p>
<p>other cell. Oh my God. So what you&rsquo;re saying is the organism is a function that tells what to do</p>
<p>and the function emerges from the interaction of the cells. Yes. So it&rsquo;s basically a description</p>
<p>of what the plant is doing in terms of microstates. And the microstates, the physical implementation</p>
<p>are too many of them to describe them. So the software that we use to describe what the plant is</p>
<p>doing, the spirit of the plant is the software, the operating system of the plant, right? This is</p>
<p>a way in which we, the observers, make sense of the plant. And the same is true for people. So</p>
<p>people have spirits, which is their operating system in a way, right? And there&rsquo;s aspects of</p>
<p>that operating system that relate to how your body functions and others, how you socially interact,</p>
<p>how you interact with yourself and so on. And we make models of that spirit. And we think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>loaded term because it&rsquo;s from a pre scientific age. But it took the scientific age a long time</p>
<p>to rediscover a term that is pretty much the same thing. And I suspect that the differences that we</p>
<p>still see between the old word and the new word are translation errors that have happened over</p>
<p>the centuries. Can you actually linger on that? Why do you say that spirit, just to clarify,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a little bit confused. So the word spirit is a powerful thing. But why did you say</p>
<p>in the last year or so that you discovered this? Do you mean the same old traditional idea of a</p>
<p>spirit? I try to find out what people mean by spirit. When people say spirituality in the US,</p>
<p>it usually refers to the phantom limb that they develop in the absence of culture.</p>
<p>And a culture is in some sense, you could say the spirit of a society that is long game. This thing</p>
<p>that is become self aware at a level above the individuals where you say, if you don&rsquo;t do the</p>
<p>following things, then the grand, grand, grand grandchildren of our children will have nothing</p>
<p>to eat. So if you take this long scope, where you try to maximize the length of the game that you</p>
<p>are playing as a species, you realize that you&rsquo;re part of a larger thing that you cannot fully</p>
<p>control. You probably need to submit to the ecosphere instead of trying to completely control</p>
<p>it. There needs to be a certain level at which we can exist as a species if you want to endure.</p>
<p>And our culture is not sustaining this anymore. We basically made this bet with the industrial</p>
<p>revolution that we can control everything. And the modernist societies with basically unfettered</p>
<p>growth led to a situation in which we depend on the ability to control the entire planet.</p>
<p>And since we are not able to do that, as it seems, this culture will die. And we realize that it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a future, right? We called our children generation Z. That&rsquo;s a very optimistic</p>
<p>thing to do. Yeah. So you can have this kind of intuition that our civilization, you said culture,</p>
<p>but you really mean the spirit of the civilization, the entirety of the civilization may not exist</p>
<p>for long. Yeah. Can you untangle that? What&rsquo;s your intuition behind that? So you kind of offline</p>
<p>mentioned to me that the industrial revolution was kind of the moment we agreed to accept</p>
<p>the offer sign on the paper on the dotted line with the industrial revolution, we doomed ourselves.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on that? This is a suspicion. I, of course, don&rsquo;t know how it plays out. But</p>
<p>it seems to me that in a society in which you leverage yourself very far over an entropic abyss</p>
<p>without land on the other side, it&rsquo;s relatively clear that your cantilever is at some point</p>
<p>going to break down into this entropic abyss. And you have to pay the bill. Okay. Russia is</p>
<p>my first language. And I&rsquo;m also an idiot. Me too. This is just two apes.</p>
<p>Instead of playing with a banana, trying to have fun by talking. Okay. Anthropic what? And what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>entropic? Entropic. So entropic in the sense of entropy. Oh, entropic. Got it. And entropic,</p>
<p>what was the other word you used? Abyss. What&rsquo;s that? It&rsquo;s a big gorge. Oh, abyss. Abyss, yes.</p>
<p>Entropic abyss. So many of the things you say are poetic. It&rsquo;s hurting my ears. And this one</p>
<p>is amazing, right? It&rsquo;s mispronounced, which makes you more poetic. Wittgenstein would be proud. So</p>
<p>entropic abyss. Okay. Let&rsquo;s rewind then. The industrial revolution. So how does that get us</p>
<p>into the entropic abyss? So in some sense, we burned a hundred million years worth of trees</p>
<p>to get everybody plumbing. Yes. And the society that we had before that had a very limited number</p>
<p>of people. So basically since zero BC, we hovered between 300 and 400 million people. Yes. And this</p>
<p>only changed with the enlightenment and the subsequent industrial revolution. And in some</p>
<p>sense, the enlightenment freed our rationality and also freed our norms from the preexisting order</p>
<p>gradually. It was a process that basically happened in feedback loops. So it was not that</p>
<p>just one caused the other. It was a dynamic that started. And the dynamic worked by basically</p>
<p>increasing productivity to such a degree that we could feed all our children. And I think the</p>
<p>definition of poverty is that you have as many children as you can feed before they die, which is</p>
<p>in some sense, the state that all animals on earth are in. The definition of poverty is having</p>
<p>enough. So you can have only so many children as you can feed and if you have more, they die. Yes.</p>
<p>And in our societies, you can basically have as many children as you want, they don&rsquo;t die. Right.</p>
<p>So the reason why we don&rsquo;t have as many children as we want is because we also have to pay a price</p>
<p>in terms of we have to insert ourselves in a lower social stratum if we have too many children.</p>
<p>So basically everybody in the under middle and lower upper class has only a limited number of</p>
<p>children because having more of them would mean a big economic hit to the individual families.</p>
<p>Yes. Because children, especially in the US, super expensive to have. And you only are taken out of</p>
<p>this if you are basically super rich or if you are super poor. If you&rsquo;re super poor, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter how many kids you have because your status is not going to change. And these children allow</p>
<p>you not going to die of hunger. So how does this lead to self destruction? So there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>unpleasant properties about this process. So basically what we try to do is we try to</p>
<p>let our children survive, even if they have diseases. Like I would have died before my</p>
<p>mid twenties without modern medicine. And most of my friends would have as well. And so many of us</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t live without the advantages of modern medicine and modern industrialized society. We</p>
<p>get our protein largely by subduing the entirety of nature. Imagine there would be some very clever</p>
<p>microbe that would live in our organisms and would completely harvest them and change them into a</p>
<p>thing that is necessary to sustain itself. And it would discover that for instance,</p>
<p>brain cells are kind of edible, but they&rsquo;re not quite nice. So you need to have more fat in them</p>
<p>and you turn them into more fat cells. And basically this big organism would become a</p>
<p>vegetable that is barely alive and it&rsquo;s going to be very brittle and not resilient when the</p>
<p>environment changes. Yeah, but some part of that organism, the one that&rsquo;s actually doing all the</p>
<p>using of the, there&rsquo;ll still be somebody thriving. So it relates back to this original question</p>
<p>I suspect that we are not the smartest thing on this planet. I suspect that basically every complex</p>
<p>system has to have some complex regulation if it depends on feedback loops. And so for instance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that we should describe a certain degree of intelligence to plants. The problem is</p>
<p>that plants don&rsquo;t have a nervous system. So they don&rsquo;t have a way to telegraph messages over large</p>
<p>distances almost instantly in the plant. And instead, they will rely on chemicals between</p>
<p>adjacent cells, which means the signal processing speed depends on the signal processing with a</p>
<p>rate of a few millimeters per second. And as a result, if the plant is intelligent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be intelligent at similar timescales as this.</p>
<p>Yeah, the time scale is different. So you suspect we might not be the most intelligent</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re the most intelligent in this spatial scale in our timescale.</p>
<p>So basically, if you would zoom out very far, we might discover that there have been intelligent</p>
<p>ecosystems on the planet that existed for thousands of years in an almost undisturbed state. And it</p>
<p>could be that these ecosystems actively related their environment. So basically change the course</p>
<p>of the evolution vision, this ecosystem to make it more efficient in the future.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible something like plants is actually a set of living organisms,</p>
<p>an ecosystem of living organisms that are just operating a different timescale and are far</p>
<p>superior in intelligence than human beings. And then human beings will die out and plants will</p>
<p>still be there and they&rsquo;ll be there.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an evolutionary adaptation playing a role at all of these levels. For instance,</p>
<p>if mice don&rsquo;t get enough food and get stressed, the next step is to</p>
<p>get more sparse and more scrawny. And the reason for this is because they in a natural</p>
<p>environment, the mice have probably hidden a drought or something else. And if they&rsquo;re overgrazed,</p>
<p>then all the things that sustain them might go extinct. And there will be no mice a few</p>
<p>generations from now. So to make sure that there will be mice in five generations from now,</p>
<p>basically the mice scale back. And a similar thing happens with the predators of mice.</p>
<p>They should make sure that the mice don&rsquo;t completely go extinct. So in some sense, if the predators are</p>
<p>smart enough, they will be tasked with shepherding their food supply. Maybe the reason why lions have</p>
<p>much larger brains than antelopes is not so much because it&rsquo;s so hard to catch an antelope as</p>
<p>opposed to run away from the lion. But the lions need to make complex models of their environment,</p>
<p>more complex than the antelopes.</p>
<p>So first of all, just describing that there&rsquo;s a bunch of complex systems and human beings may not</p>
<p>even be the most special or intelligent of those complex systems, even on Earth, makes me feel a</p>
<p>little better about the extinction of human species that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Yes, maybe you&rsquo;re just Guy Astploit to put the carbon back into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is just a nice, we tried it out.</p>
<p>The big stain on evolution is not us, it was trees. Earth evolved trees before there could be</p>
<p>digested again. There were no insects that could break all of them apart. Cellulose is so robust</p>
<p>that you cannot get all of it with microorganisms. So many of these trees fell into swamps and all</p>
<p>this carbon became inert and could no longer be recycled into organisms. And we are the species</p>
<p>that is destined to take care of that.</p>
<p>So this is kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>To get out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the Earth is already greening.</p>
<p>So we have to be careful about that.</p>
<p>To get out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the Earth is already greening.</p>
<p>So within a million years or so when the ecosystems have recovered from the rapid changes,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not compatible with right now, the Earth is going to be awesome again.</p>
<p>And there won&rsquo;t be even a memory of us, of us little apes.</p>
<p>I think there will be memories of us. I suspect we are the first generally intelligent species</p>
<p>in the sense. We are the first species within industrial society because we will leave more</p>
<p>phones than bones in the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Phones than bones. I like it. But then let me push back. You&rsquo;ve kind of suggested that</p>
<p>we have a very narrow definition of&hellip; I mean, why aren&rsquo;t trees a higher level of general</p>
<p>intelligence?</p>
<p>If trees were intelligent, then they would be at different timescales, which means within</p>
<p>a hundred years, the tree is probably not going to make models that are as complex as</p>
<p>the ones that we make in 10 years.</p>
<p>But maybe the trees are the ones that made the phones, right?</p>
<p>You could say the entirety of life did it. The first cell never died. The first cell</p>
<p>only split, right? And every cell in our body is still an instance of the first cell that</p>
<p>split off from that very first cell. There was only one cell on this planet as far as</p>
<p>we know. And so the cell is not just a building block of life. It&rsquo;s a hyperorganism. And we</p>
<p>are part of this hyperorganism.</p>
<p>So nevertheless, this hyperorganism, no, this little particular branch of it, which is us</p>
<p>humans, because of the industrial revolution and maybe the exponential growth of technology</p>
<p>might somehow destroy ourselves. So what do you think is the most likely way we might</p>
<p>destroy ourselves? So some people worry about genetic manipulation. Some people, as we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked about, worry about either dumb artificial intelligence or super intelligent artificial</p>
<p>intelligence destroying us. Some people worry about nuclear weapons and weapons of war in</p>
<p>general. What do you think? If you were a betting man, what would you bet on in terms</p>
<p>of self destruction? And then would it be higher than 50%?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very likely that nothing that we bet on matters after we win our bets. So I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that bets are literally the right way to go about this.</p>
<p>I mean, once you&rsquo;re dead, you won&rsquo;t be there to collect the wings.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also not clear if we as a species go extinct. But I think that our present</p>
<p>civilization is not sustainable. So the thing that will change is there will be probably</p>
<p>fewer people on the planet than there are today. And even if not, then still most of</p>
<p>people that are alive today will not have offspring in 100 years from now because of</p>
<p>the geographic changes and so on and the changes in the food supply. It&rsquo;s quite likely</p>
<p>that many areas of the planet will only be livable with a close cooling chain in 100</p>
<p>years from now. So many of the areas around the equator and in subtropical climates that</p>
<p>are now quite pleasant to live in, will stop to be inhabitable without air conditioning.</p>
<p>So you honestly, wow, cooling chain, close knit cooling chain communities. So you think</p>
<p>you have a strong worry about the effects of global warming?</p>
<p>By itself, it&rsquo;s not a big issue. If you live in Arizona right now, you have basically three</p>
<p>months in the summer in which you cannot be outside. And so you have a close cooling chain.</p>
<p>You have air conditioning in your car and in your home and you&rsquo;re fine. And if the air</p>
<p>conditioning would stop for a few days, then in many areas you would not be able to survive.</p>
<p>Can we just pause for a second? You say so many brilliant, poetic things. Do people use</p>
<p>that term closed cooling chain? I imagine that people use it when they describe how they get</p>
<p>meat into a supermarket, right? If you break the cooling chain and this thing starts to thaw,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in trouble and you have to throw it away. That&rsquo;s such a beautiful way to put it. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>calling a city a closed social chain or something like that. I mean, that&rsquo;s right. I mean, the</p>
<p>locality of it is really important. It basically means you wake up in a climatized room, you go</p>
<p>to work in a climatized car, you work in a climatized office, you shop in a climatized</p>
<p>supermarket and in between you have very short distance in which you run from your car to the</p>
<p>supermarket, but you have to make sure that your temperature does not approach the temperature of</p>
<p>the environment. The crucial thing is the wet barb temperature. The wet barb temperature. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you get when you take a wet cloth and you put it around your thermometer and then you move</p>
<p>it very quickly through the air so you get the evaporation heat. And as soon as you can no longer</p>
<p>cool your body temperature via evaporation to a temperature below something like I think 35</p>
<p>degrees, you die. Which means if the outside world is dry, you can still cool yourself down</p>
<p>by sweating. But if it has a certain degree of humidity or if it goes over a certain temperature,</p>
<p>then sweating will not save you. And this means even if you&rsquo;re a healthy, fit individual within</p>
<p>a few hours, even if you try to be in the shade and so on, you&rsquo;ll die unless you have</p>
<p>some climatizing equipment. And this itself, as long as you maintain civilization and you have</p>
<p>energy supply and you have foot trucks coming to your home that are climatized, everything is fine.</p>
<p>But what if you lose large scale open agriculture at the same time? So basically you run into foot</p>
<p>insecurity because climate becomes very irregular or weather becomes very irregular and you have a</p>
<p>lot of extreme weather events. So you need to roll most of your foot maybe indoor or you need to</p>
<p>import your foot from certain regions. And maybe you&rsquo;re not able to maintain the civilization</p>
<p>throughout the planet to get the infrastructure to get the foot to your home.</p>
<p>Right. But there could be significant impacts in the sense that people begin to suffer.</p>
<p>There could be wars over resources and so on. But ultimately, do you not have a, not a faith, but</p>
<p>what do you make of the capacity of technological innovation to help us prevent some of the worst</p>
<p>damages that this condition can create? So as an example, as an almost out there example,</p>
<p>is the work that SpaceX and Elon Musk is doing of trying to also consider our propagation</p>
<p>throughout the universe in deep space to colonize other planets. That&rsquo;s one technological step.</p>
<p>But of course, what Elon Musk is trying on Mars is not to save us from global warming,</p>
<p>because Mars looks much worse than Earth will look like after the worst outcomes of global warming</p>
<p>imaginable, right? Mars is essentially not habitable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exceptionally harsh environment, yes. But what he is doing, what a lot of people throughout</p>
<p>history since the Industrial Revolution are doing, are just doing a lot of different technological</p>
<p>innovation with some kind of target. And when it ends up happening, it&rsquo;s totally unexpected new</p>
<p>things come up. So trying to terraform or trying to colonize Mars, extremely harsh environment,</p>
<p>might give us totally new ideas of how to expand or increase the power of this closed cooling</p>
<p>circuit that empowers the community. So it seems like there&rsquo;s a little bit of a race between our</p>
<p>open ended technological innovation of this communal operating system that we have and our</p>
<p>general tendency to want to overuse resources and thereby destroy ourselves. You don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>technology can win that race? I think the probability is relatively low, given that our</p>
<p>technology is, for instance, the US is stagnating since the 1970s roughly, in terms of technology.</p>
<p>Most of the things that we do are the result of incremental processes. What about Intel?</p>
<p>What about Moore&rsquo;s Law? It&rsquo;s basically, it&rsquo;s very incremental. The things that we&rsquo;re doing is,</p>
<p>so the invention of the microprocessor was a major thing, right? The miniaturization</p>
<p>of transistors was really major. But the things that we did afterwards largely were not that</p>
<p>innovative. We had gradual changes of scaling things from CPUs into GPUs and things like that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that there are, basically there are not many things. If you take a person that</p>
<p>died in the 70s and was at the top of their game, they would not need to read that many books</p>
<p>to be current again. But it&rsquo;s all about books. Who cares about books? There might be things that are</p>
<p>beyond books. Or say papers. No, papers. Forget papers. There might be things that are, so papers</p>
<p>and books and knowledge, that&rsquo;s a concept of a time when you were sitting there by candlelight</p>
<p>and individual consumers of knowledge. What about the impact that we&rsquo;re not in the middle of,</p>
<p>might not be understanding of Twitter, of YouTube? The reason you and I are sitting here today</p>
<p>is because of Twitter and YouTube. So the ripple effect, and there&rsquo;s two minds, sort of two dumb</p>
<p>apes coming up with a new, perhaps a new clean insights, and there&rsquo;s 200 other apes listening</p>
<p>right now, 200,000 other apes listening right now. And that effect, it&rsquo;s very difficult to understand</p>
<p>what that effect will have. That might be bigger than any of the advancements of the microprocessor</p>
<p>or any of the industrial revolution, the ability of spread knowledge. And that knowledge,</p>
<p>like it allows good ideas to reach millions much faster. And the effect of that, that might be the</p>
<p>new, that might be the 21st century, is the multiplying of ideas, of good ideas. Because if</p>
<p>you say one good thing today, that will multiply across huge amounts of people, and then they will</p>
<p>say something, and then they will have another podcast, and they&rsquo;ll say something, and then they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>write a paper. That could be a huge, you don&rsquo;t think that? Yeah, we should have billions for</p>
<p>Neumann&rsquo;s right now in two rings, and we don&rsquo;t for some reason. I suspect the reason is that</p>
<p>we destroy our attention span. Also the incentives, of course, different. Yeah, we have extreme</p>
<p>Kardashians, yeah. So the reason why we&rsquo;re sitting here and doing this as a YouTube video is because</p>
<p>you and me don&rsquo;t have the attention span to write a book together right now. And you guys probably</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the attention span to read it. So let me tell you, it&rsquo;s very short. But we&rsquo;re an hour</p>
<p>and 40 minutes in, and I guarantee you that 80% of the people are still listening. So there is an</p>
<p>attention span. It&rsquo;s just the form. Who said that the book is the optimal way to transfer information?</p>
<p>This is still an open question. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re&hellip; It&rsquo;s something that social media could be doing</p>
<p>that other forms could not be doing. I think the end game of social media is a global brain.</p>
<p>And Twitter is in some sense a global brain that is completely hooked on dopamine, doesn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>kind of inhibition, and as a result is caught in a permanent seizure. It&rsquo;s also in some sense a</p>
<p>multiplayer role playing game. And people use it to play an avatar that is not like them,</p>
<p>as they were in this sane world, and they look through the world through the lens of their phones</p>
<p>and think it&rsquo;s the real world. But it&rsquo;s the Twitter world that is distorted by the popularity</p>
<p>incentives of Twitter. Yeah, the incentives and just our natural biological, the dopamine rush</p>
<p>of a like, no matter how&hellip; I try to be very kind of Zen like and minimalist and not be influenced</p>
<p>by likes and so on, but it&rsquo;s probably very difficult to avoid that to some degree.</p>
<p>Speaking at a small tangent of Twitter, how can Twitter be done better?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an incredible mechanism that has a huge impact on society</p>
<p>by doing exactly what you&rsquo;re doing. Sorry, doing exactly what you described, which is having this&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, is this some kind of game, and we&rsquo;re kind of our individual RL agents in this game,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s uncontrollable because there&rsquo;s not really a centralized control. Neither Jack Dorsey nor</p>
<p>the engineers at Twitter seem to be able to control this game. Or can they? That&rsquo;s sort</p>
<p>of a question. Is there any advice you would give on how to control this game?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t give advice because I am certainly not an expert, but I can give my thoughts on this.</p>
<p>And our brain has solved this problem to some degree. Our brain has lots of individual agents</p>
<p>that manage to play together in a way. And we have also many contexts in which other organisms</p>
<p>have found ways to solve the problems of cooperation that we don&rsquo;t solve on Twitter.</p>
<p>And maybe the solution is to go for an evolutionary approach. So imagine that you</p>
<p>have something like Reddit or something like Facebook and something like Twitter,</p>
<p>and you think about what they have in common. What they have in common, they are companies</p>
<p>that in some sense own a protocol. And this protocol is imposed on a community, and the</p>
<p>protocol has different components for monetization, for user management, for user display, for rating,</p>
<p>for anonymity, for import of other content, and so on. And now imagine that you take these</p>
<p>components of the protocol apart, and you do it in some sense like communities within this</p>
<p>social network. And these communities are allowed to mix and match their protocols and design new</p>
<p>ones. So for instance, the UI and the UX can be defined by the community. The rules for sharing</p>
<p>content across communities can be defined. The monetization can be redefined. The way you reward</p>
<p>individual users for what can be redefined. The way users can represent themselves and to each</p>
<p>other can redefined. Who could be the redefiner? So can individual human beings build enough</p>
<p>intuition to redefine those things? This itself can become part of the protocol. So for instance,</p>
<p>it could be in some communities, it will be a single person that comes up with these things.</p>
<p>And others, it&rsquo;s a group of friends. Some might implement a voting scheme that has some interesting</p>
<p>weighted voting. Who knows? Who knows what will be the best self organizing principle for this.</p>
<p>But the process can&rsquo;t be automated. I mean, it seems like the brain.</p>
<p>It can be automated so people can write software for this. And eventually the idea is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not make an assumption about this thing if you don&rsquo;t know what the right solution is. In</p>
<p>those areas that we have no idea whether the right solution will be people designing this ad hoc,</p>
<p>or machines doing this. Whether you want to enforce compliance by social norms like Wikipedia,</p>
<p>or with software solutions, or with AI that goes through the posts of people, or with a</p>
<p>legal principle, and so on. This is something maybe you need to find out. And so the idea would</p>
<p>be if you let the communities evolve, and you just control it in such a way that you are</p>
<p>incentivizing the most sentient communities. The ones that produce the most interesting</p>
<p>behaviors that allow you to interact in the most helpful ways to the individuals.</p>
<p>You have a network that gives you information that is relevant to you.</p>
<p>It helps you to maintain relationships to others in healthy ways. It allows you to build teams. It</p>
<p>allows you to basically bring the best of you into this thing and goes into a coupling into</p>
<p>a relationship with others in which you produce things that you would be unable to produce alone.</p>
<p>Yes, beautifully put. But the key process of that with incentives and evolution</p>
<p>is things that don&rsquo;t adopt themselves to effectively get the incentives have to die.</p>
<p>And the thing about social media is communities that are unhealthy or whatever you wanted that</p>
<p>defines the incentives really don&rsquo;t like dying. One of the things that people really get aggressive,</p>
<p>protest aggressively is when they&rsquo;re censored. Especially in America. I don&rsquo;t know much about</p>
<p>the rest of the world, but the idea of freedom of speech, the idea of censorship is really painful</p>
<p>in America. And so what do you think about that? Having grown up in East Germany, do you think</p>
<p>censorship is an important tool in our brain and the intelligence and in social networks?</p>
<p>So basically, if you&rsquo;re not a good member of the entirety of the system, they should be blocked</p>
<p>away. Well, locked away, blocked. An important thing is who decides that you are a good member.</p>
<p>Who? Is it distributed? And what is the outcome of the process that decides it,</p>
<p>both for the individual and for society at large. For instance, if you have a high trust society,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need a lot of surveillance. And the surveillance is even in some sense undermining</p>
<p>trust. Because it&rsquo;s basically punishing people that look suspicious when surveyed,</p>
<p>but do the right thing anyway. And the opposite, if you have a low trust society,</p>
<p>then surveillance can be a better trade off. And the US is currently making a transition from a</p>
<p>relatively high trust or mixed trust society to a low trust society. So surveillance will increase.</p>
<p>Another thing is that beliefs are not just inert representations. There are implementations that</p>
<p>run code on your brain and change your reality and change the way you interact with each other</p>
<p>at some level. And some of the beliefs are just public opinions that we use to display our</p>
<p>alignment. So for instance, people might say, all cultures are the same and equally good,</p>
<p>but still they prefer to live in some cultures over others, very, very strongly so. And it turns</p>
<p>out that the cultures are defined by certain rules of interaction. And these rules of interaction</p>
<p>lead to different results when you implement them. So if you adhere to certain rules,</p>
<p>you get different outcomes in different societies. And this all leads to very tricky</p>
<p>situations when people do not have a commitment to a shared purpose.</p>
<p>And our societies probably need to rediscover what it means to have a shared purpose and how</p>
<p>to make this compatible with a non totalitarian view. So in some sense, the US is caught in a</p>
<p>conundrum between totalitarianism and diversity, and doesn&rsquo;t need to know how to resolve this.</p>
<p>And the solutions that the US has found so far are very crude because it&rsquo;s a very young society</p>
<p>that is also under a lot of tension. It seems to me that the US will have to reinvent itself.</p>
<p>What do you think, just philosophizing, what kind of mechanisms of government do you think</p>
<p>we as a species should be involved with, US or broadly? What do you think will work well</p>
<p>as a system? Of course, we don&rsquo;t know. It all seems to work pretty crappily,</p>
<p>some things worse than others. Some people argue that communism is the best. Others say,</p>
<p>yeah, look at the Soviet Union. Some people argue that anarchy is the best and then completely</p>
<p>discarding the positive effects of government. There&rsquo;s a lot of arguments. US seems to be doing</p>
<p>pretty damn well in the span of history. There&rsquo;s a respect for human rights, which seems to be a</p>
<p>nice feature, not a bug. And economically, a lot of growth, a lot of technological development.</p>
<p>People seem to be relatively kind on the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>What lessons do you draw from that? What kind of government system do you think is good?</p>
<p>Ideally, a government should not be perceivable. It should be frictionless. The more you notice the</p>
<p>influence of the government, the more friction you experience, the less effective and efficient</p>
<p>the government probably is. A government, game theoretically, is an agent that imposes</p>
<p>an offset on your payout metrics to make your Nash equilibrium compatible with the common good.</p>
<p>You have these situations where people act on local incentives and these local incentives,</p>
<p>everybody does the thing that&rsquo;s locally the best for them, but the global outcome is not good.</p>
<p>And this is even the case when people care about the global outcome, because a regulation mechanism</p>
<p>exists that creates a causal relationship between what I want to have for the global good and what</p>
<p>I do. For instance, if I think that we should fly less and I stay at home, there&rsquo;s not a single plane</p>
<p>that is going to not start because of me, right? It&rsquo;s not going to have an influence, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get from A to B. So the way to implement this would be to have a government that is sharing</p>
<p>this idea that we should fly less and is then imposing a regulation that, for instance,</p>
<p>makes flying more expensive and gives incentives for inventing other forms of transportation that</p>
<p>are less putting that strain on the environment, for instance. So there&rsquo;s so much optimism and</p>
<p>so many things you describe, and yet there&rsquo;s the pessimism of you think our civilization is going</p>
<p>to come to an end. So that&rsquo;s not a hundred percent probability. Nothing in this world is.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the trajectory out of self destruction, do you think? I suspect that in some sense,</p>
<p>we are both too smart and not smart enough, which means we are very good at solving near</p>
<p>term problems. And at the same time, we are unwilling to submit to the imperatives that</p>
<p>we would have to follow in if you want to stick around. So that makes it difficult. If you were</p>
<p>unable to solve everything technologically, you can probably understand how high the child mortality</p>
<p>needs to be to absorb the mutation rate and how high the mutation rate needs to be to adapt to a</p>
<p>slowly changing ecosystemic environment. So you could in principle compute all these things game</p>
<p>theoretically and adapt to it. But if you cannot do this, because you are like me and you have</p>
<p>children, you don&rsquo;t want them to die, you will use any kind of medical information to keep</p>
<p>mortality low. Even if it means that within a few generations, we have enormous genetic drift,</p>
<p>and most of us have allergies as a result of not being adapted to the changes that we</p>
<p>made to our food supply. That&rsquo;s for now, I say technologically speaking, we&rsquo;re just very young,</p>
<p>300 years industrial revolution, we&rsquo;re very new to this idea. So you&rsquo;re attached to your kids being</p>
<p>alive and not being murdered for the good of society. But that might be a very temporary</p>
<p>moment of time that we might evolve in our thinking. So like you said, we&rsquo;re both smart</p>
<p>and not smart enough. We are probably not the first human civilization that has discovered</p>
<p>technology that allows us to efficiently overgraze our resources. And this overgrazing,</p>
<p>this thing, at some point, we think we can compensate this because if we have eaten all</p>
<p>the grass, we will find a way to grow mushrooms. But it could also be that the ecosystems tip.</p>
<p>And so what really concerns me is not so much the end of the civilization, because we will</p>
<p>invent a new one. But what concerns me is the fact that, for instance, the oceans might tip.</p>
<p>So for instance, maybe the plankton dies because of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria take over,</p>
<p>and as a result, we can no longer breathe the atmosphere. This would be really concerning.</p>
<p>So basically a major reboot of most complex organisms on Earth. And I think this is a</p>
<p>possibility. I don&rsquo;t know what the percentage for this possibility is, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be</p>
<p>outlandish to me if you look at the scale of the changes that we&rsquo;ve already triggered on this</p>
<p>planet. And so Danny Hiller suggests that, for instance, we may be able to put chalk into the</p>
<p>stratosphere to limit solar radiation. Maybe it works. Maybe this is sufficient to counter</p>
<p>the effects of what we&rsquo;ve done. Maybe it won&rsquo;t be. Maybe we won&rsquo;t be able to implement it by</p>
<p>the time it&rsquo;s prevalent. I have no idea how the future is going to play out in this regard. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just, I think it&rsquo;s quite likely that we cannot continue like this. All our cousin species,</p>
<p>the other hominids are gone. So the right step would be to what? To rewind</p>
<p>and to rewind towards the industrial revolution and slow the, so try to contain the technological</p>
<p>process that leads to the overconsumption of resources? Imagine you get to choose,</p>
<p>you have one lifetime. You get born into a sustainable agricultural civilization,</p>
<p>300, maybe 400 million people on the planet tops. Or before this, some kind of nomadic</p>
<p>species was like a million or 2 million. And so you don&rsquo;t meet new people unless you give birth</p>
<p>to them. You cannot travel to other places in the world. There is no internet. There is no</p>
<p>interesting intellectual tradition that reaches considerably deep. So you would not discover</p>
<p>human completeness probably and so on. We wouldn&rsquo;t exist. And the alternative is you get born into an</p>
<p>insane world. One that is doomed to die because it has just burned a hundred million years worth</p>
<p>of trees in a single century. Which one do you like? I think I like this one. It&rsquo;s a very weird</p>
<p>thing that when you find yourself on a Titanic and you see this iceberg and it looks like we</p>
<p>are not going to miss it. And a lot of people are in denial. And most of the counter arguments</p>
<p>sound like denial to me. They don&rsquo;t seem to be rational arguments. And the other thing is we</p>
<p>are born on this Titanic. Without this Titanic, we wouldn&rsquo;t have been born. We wouldn&rsquo;t be here. We</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be talking. We wouldn&rsquo;t be on the internet. We wouldn&rsquo;t do all the things that we enjoy.</p>
<p>And we are not responsible for this happening. If we had the choice, we would probably try to</p>
<p>prevent it. But when we were born, we were never asked when we want to be born, in which society</p>
<p>we want to be born, what incentive structures we want to be exposed to. We have relatively</p>
<p>little agency in the entire thing. Humanity has relatively little agency in the whole thing. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically a giant machine that&rsquo;s tumbling down a hill and everybody is frantically trying to push</p>
<p>some buttons. Nobody knows what these buttons are meaning, what they connect to. And most of them</p>
<p>are not stopping this tumbling down the hill. Is it possible that artificial intelligence will give</p>
<p>us an escape latch somehow? So there&rsquo;s a lot of worry about existential threats of artificial</p>
<p>intelligence. But what AI also allows, in general forms of automation, allows the potential of</p>
<p>extreme productivity growth that will also perhaps in a positive way transform society,</p>
<p>that may allow us to inadvertently to return to the more, to the same kind of ideals of closer to</p>
<p>nature that&rsquo;s represented in hunter gatherer societies. That&rsquo;s not destroying the planet,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not doing overconsumption and so on. I mean, generally speaking,</p>
<p>do you have hope that AI can help somehow? I think it&rsquo;s not fun to be very close to nature</p>
<p>until you completely subdue nature. So our idea of being close to nature means being close to</p>
<p>agriculture, basically forests that don&rsquo;t have anything in them that eats us.</p>
<p>TITO See, I mean, I want to disagree with that. I think the niceness of being close to nature</p>
<p>is to being fully present and in like, when survival becomes your primary,</p>
<p>not just your goal, but your whole existence. I&rsquo;m not just romanticizing, I can just speak for</p>
<p>myself. I am self aware enough that that is a fulfilling existence.</p>
<p>I personally prefer to be in nature and not fight for my survival. I think fighting for your survival</p>
<p>while being in the cold and in the rain and being hunted by animals and having open wounds</p>
<p>is very unpleasant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a contradiction in there. Yes, I and you, just as you said, would not choose it.</p>
<p>But if I was forced into it, it would be a fulfilling existence.</p>
<p>Yes, if you are adapted to it, basically, if your brain is wired up in such a way that you</p>
<p>get rewards optimally in such an environment. And there&rsquo;s some evidence for this that for</p>
<p>a certain degree of complexity, basically, people are more happy in such an environment because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what you largely have evolved for. In between, we had a few thousand years in which</p>
<p>I think we have evolved for a slightly more comfortable environment. So</p>
<p>there is probably something like an intermediate stage in which people would be more happy than</p>
<p>they would be if they would have to fend for themselves in small groups in the forest and</p>
<p>often die. Versus something like this, where we now have basically a big machine, a big</p>
<p>Mordor in which we run through concrete boxes and press buttons and machines, and largely</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel well cared for as the monkeys that we are. So returning briefly to, not briefly,</p>
<p>but returning to AI, what, let me ask a romanticized question, what is the most beautiful</p>
<p>to you, silly ape, the most beautiful or surprising idea in the development of artificial</p>
<p>intelligence, whether in your own life or in the history of artificial intelligence that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>come across? If you built an AI, it probably can make models at an arbitrary degree of detail,</p>
<p>right, of the world. And then it would try to understand its own nature. It&rsquo;s tempting to think</p>
<p>that at some point when we have general intelligence, we have competitions where we</p>
<p>will let the AIs wake up in different kinds of physical universes, and we measure how many</p>
<p>movements of the Rubik&rsquo;s cube it takes until it&rsquo;s figured out what&rsquo;s going on in its universe and</p>
<p>what it is in its own nature and its own physics and so on, right? So what if we exist in the</p>
<p>memory of an AI that is trying to understand its own nature and remembers its own genesis and</p>
<p>remembers Lex and Joscha sitting in a hotel room, sparking some of the ideas off that led to the</p>
<p>development of general intelligence. So we&rsquo;re a kind of simulation that&rsquo;s running in an AI</p>
<p>system that&rsquo;s trying to understand itself. It&rsquo;s not that I believe that, but I think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>beautiful idea. I mean, you kind of returned to this idea with the Turing test of intelligence</p>
<p>being the process of asking and answering what is intelligence. I mean, do you think there is an</p>
<p>answer? Why is there such a search for an answer? So does there have to be like an answer? You just</p>
<p>said an AI system that&rsquo;s trying to understand the why of what, you know, understand itself.</p>
<p>Is that a fundamental process of greater and greater complexity, greater and greater</p>
<p>intelligence is the continuous trying of understanding itself?</p>
<p>No, I think you will find that most people don&rsquo;t care about that because they&rsquo;re well adjusted</p>
<p>enough to not care. And the reason why people like you and me care about it probably has to</p>
<p>do with the need to understand ourselves. It&rsquo;s because we are in fundamental disagreement with</p>
<p>the universe that we wake up in. They look down on me and they see, oh my God, I&rsquo;m caught in a</p>
<p>monkey. What&rsquo;s that? Some people are unhappy with the government and I&rsquo;m unhappy with the entire</p>
<p>universe that I find myself in. Oh, so you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a fundamental aspect of human nature</p>
<p>that some people are just suppressing? That they wake up shocked they&rsquo;re in the body of a monkey?</p>
<p>No, there is a clear adaptive value to not be confused by that and by&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, no, that&rsquo;s not what I asked. So you have this clear adaptive value, then there&rsquo;s clear</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s clear adaptive value to while fundamentally your brain is confused by that,</p>
<p>by creating an illusion, another layer of the narrative that says, you know, that tries to</p>
<p>suppress that and instead say that, you know, what&rsquo;s going on with the government right now</p>
<p>is the most important thing. What&rsquo;s going on with my football team is the most important thing.</p>
<p>But it seems to me, like for me, it was a really interesting moment reading Ernest</p>
<p>Becker&rsquo;s Denial of Death. That, you know, this kind of idea that we&rsquo;re all, you know,</p>
<p>the fundamental thing from which most of our human mind springs is this fear of mortality</p>
<p>and being cognizant of your mortality and the fear of that mortality. And then you construct</p>
<p>illusions on top of that. I guess you being just a push on it, you really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that this worry of the big existential questions is actually fundamental as the existentialist</p>
<p>thought to our existence. I think that the fear of death only plays a role as long as you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see the big picture. The thing is that minds are software states, right? Software doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>identity. Software in some sense is a physical law. But it feels like there&rsquo;s an identity. I</p>
<p>thought that was the for this particular piece of software and the narrative it tells, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fundamental property of it. The maintenance of the identity is not terminal. It&rsquo;s instrumental</p>
<p>to something else. You maintain your identity so you can serve your meaning. So you can do the</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;re supposed to do before you die. And I suspect that for most people the fear of</p>
<p>death is the fear of dying before they are done with the things that they feel they have to do,</p>
<p>even though they cannot quite put their finger on it, what that is.</p>
<p>Right. But in the software world, to return to the question, then what happens after we die?</p>
<p>Why would you care? You will not be longer there. The point of dying is that you are gone.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&rsquo;m not. This is what, you know, it seems like there&rsquo;s so much,</p>
<p>in the idea that this is just, the mind is just a simulation that&rsquo;s constructing a narrative around</p>
<p>some particular aspects of the quantum mechanical wave function world that we can&rsquo;t quite get direct</p>
<p>access to. Then like the idea of mortality seems to be a little fuzzy as well. It doesn&rsquo;t, maybe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a clear answer. The fuzzy idea is the one of continuous existence. We don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>continuous existence. How do you know that? Because it&rsquo;s not computable. Because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s going to be directly infinite. There is no continuous process. The only thing that</p>
<p>binds you together with the Lex Friedman from yesterday is the illusion that you have memories</p>
<p>about him. So if you want to upload, it&rsquo;s very easy. You make a machine that thinks it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>Because this is the same thing that you are. You are a machine that thinks it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s immortality. Yeah, but it&rsquo;s just a belief. You can create this belief very easily</p>
<p>once you realize that the question whether you are immortal or not depends entirely on your beliefs</p>
<p>and your own continuity. But then you can be immortal by the continuity of the belief.</p>
<p>You cannot be immortal, but you can stop being afraid of your mortality because you realize you</p>
<p>were never continuously existing in the first place. Well, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be more terrified</p>
<p>or less terrified by that. It seems like the fact that I existed.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know this state in which you don&rsquo;t have a self. You can&rsquo;t turn off yourself.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t turn off myself.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t turn it off. You can&rsquo;t turn it off.</p>
<p>I can.</p>
<p>Yes. And you can basically meditate yourself in a state where you are still conscious,</p>
<p>where still things are happening, where you know everything that you knew before,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re no longer identified with changing anything.</p>
<p>And this means that yourself, in a way, dissolves. There is no longer this person. You know that this</p>
<p>person construct exists in other states and it runs on this brain of Lex Friedman, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a real thing. It&rsquo;s a construct. It&rsquo;s an idea. And you can change that idea. And if you let go of</p>
<p>this idea, if you don&rsquo;t think that you are special, you realize it&rsquo;s just one of many people and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not your favorite person even. It&rsquo;s just one of many. And it&rsquo;s the one that you are doomed to</p>
<p>control for the most part. And that is basically informing the actions of this organism as a</p>
<p>control model. And this is all there is. And you are somehow afraid that this control model gets</p>
<p>interrupted or loses the identity of continuity.</p>
<p>Yeah. So I&rsquo;m attached. I mean, yeah, it&rsquo;s a very popular, it&rsquo;s a somehow compelling notion that</p>
<p>being attached, like there&rsquo;s no need to be attached to this idea of an identity.</p>
<p>But that in itself could be an illusion that you construct. So the process of meditation,</p>
<p>while popular, is thought of as getting under the concept of identity. It could be just putting a</p>
<p>cloak over it, just telling it to be quiet for the moment. I think that meditation is eventually just</p>
<p>a bunch of techniques that let you control attention. And when you can control attention,</p>
<p>you can get access to your own source code, hopefully not before you understand what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing. And then you can change the way it works temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>So yeah, meditation is to get a glimpse at the source code, get under, so basically control or</p>
<p>turn off the attention.</p>
<p>The entire thing is that you learn to control attention. So everything else is downstream</p>
<p>from controlling attention.</p>
<p>And control the attention that&rsquo;s looking at the attention.</p>
<p>Normally we only get attention in the parts of our mind that create heat, where you have a</p>
<p>mismatch between model and the results that are happening. And so most people are not self aware</p>
<p>because their control is too good. If everything works out roughly the way you want, and the only</p>
<p>things that don&rsquo;t work out is whether your football team wins, then you will mostly have</p>
<p>models about these domains. And it&rsquo;s only when, for instance, your fundamental relationships to</p>
<p>the world around you don&rsquo;t work, because the ideology of your country is insane, and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why it&rsquo;s insane, and the other kids are not nerds, and don&rsquo;t understand why you</p>
<p>understand physics, and you don&rsquo;t, why you want to understand physics, and you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>why somebody would not want to understand physics.</p>
<p>So we kind of brought up neurons in the brain as reinforcement learning agents.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been some successes as you brought up with Go, with AlphaGo, AlphaZero, with ideas</p>
<p>which I think are incredibly interesting ideas of systems playing each other in an automated way</p>
<p>to improve by playing other systems in a particular construct of a game that are a little</p>
<p>bit better than itself, and then thereby improving continuously. All the competitors in the game</p>
<p>are improving gradually. So being just challenging enough and from learning from the process of the</p>
<p>competition. Do you have hope for that reinforcement learning process to achieve</p>
<p>greater and greater level of intelligence? So we talked about different ideas in AI that need to</p>
<p>be solved. Is RL a part of that process of trying to create an AGI system? What do you think?</p>
<p>Definitely forms of unsupervised learning, but there are many algorithms that can achieve that.</p>
<p>And I suspect that ultimately the algorithms that work, there will be a class of them or many of</p>
<p>them. And they might have small differences of like a magnitude and efficiency, but eventually</p>
<p>what matters is the type of model that you form and the types of models that we form right now</p>
<p>are not sparse enough. What does it mean to be sparse? It means that ideally every potential</p>
<p>model state should correspond to a potential world state. So basically if you vary states</p>
<p>in your model, you always end up with valid world states and our mind is not quite there.</p>
<p>So an indication is basically what we see in dreams. The older we get, the more boring our</p>
<p>dreams become because we incorporate more and more constraints that we learned about how the</p>
<p>world works. So many of the things that we imagine to be possible as children turn out to be</p>
<p>constrained by physical and social dynamics. And as a result, fewer and fewer things remain</p>
<p>possible. It&rsquo;s not because our imagination scales back, but the constraints under which it operates</p>
<p>become tighter and tighter. And so the constraints under which our neural networks operate are</p>
<p>almost limitless, which means it&rsquo;s very difficult to get a neural network to imagine things that</p>
<p>look real. So I suspect part of what we need to do is we probably need to build dreaming systems.</p>
<p>I suspect that part of the purpose of dreams is similar to a generative adversarial network,</p>
<p>we learn certain constraints and then it produces alternative perspectives on the same set of</p>
<p>constraints. So you can recognize it under different circumstances. Maybe we have flying</p>
<p>dreams as children because we recreate the objects that we know and the maps that we know from</p>
<p>different perspectives, which also means from a bird&rsquo;s eye perspective. So I mean, aren&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>doing that anyway? I mean, not with our eyes closed and when we&rsquo;re sleeping, aren&rsquo;t we just</p>
<p>constantly running dreams and simulations in our mind as we try to interpret the environment?</p>
<p>I mean, sort of considering all the different possibilities, the way we interact with the</p>
<p>environment seems like, essentially, like you said, sort of creating a bunch of simulations</p>
<p>that are consistent with our expectations, with our previous experiences, with the things we just</p>
<p>saw recently. And through that hallucination process, we are able to then somehow stitch</p>
<p>together what actually we see in the world with the simulations that match it well and thereby</p>
<p>interpret it. I suspect that you and my brain are slightly unusual in this regard,</p>
<p>which is probably what got you into MIT. So this obsession of constantly pondering possibilities</p>
<p>and solutions to problems. Oh, stop it. I think I&rsquo;m not talking about intellectual stuff. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about just doing the kind of stuff it takes to walk and not fall. Yes, this is</p>
<p>largely automatic. Yes, but the process is, I mean&hellip; It&rsquo;s not complicated. It&rsquo;s relatively</p>
<p>easy to build a neural network that, in some sense, learns the dynamics. The fact that we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done it right so far doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s hard, because you can see that a biological</p>
<p>organism does it with relatively few neurons. So basically, you build a bunch of neural</p>
<p>oscillators that entrain themselves with the dynamics of your body in such a way that the</p>
<p>regulator becomes isomorphic in its model to the dynamics that it regulates, and then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>automatic. And it&rsquo;s only interesting in the sense that it captures attention when the system is off.</p>
<p>See, but thinking of the kind of mechanism that&rsquo;s required to do walking as a controller,</p>
<p>as a neural network, I think it&rsquo;s a compelling notion, but it discards quietly,</p>
<p>or at least makes implicit, the fact that you need to have something like common sense reasoning</p>
<p>to walk. It&rsquo;s an open question whether you do or not. But my intuition is to act in this world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge knowledge base that&rsquo;s underlying it somehow. There&rsquo;s so much information</p>
<p>of the kind we have never been able to construct in neural networks in an artificial intelligence</p>
<p>systems period, which is like, it&rsquo;s humbling, at least in my imagination, the amount of information</p>
<p>required to act in this world humbles me. And I think saying that neural networks can accomplish</p>
<p>it is missing the fact that we don&rsquo;t have yet a mechanism for constructing something like</p>
<p>common sense reasoning. I mean, what&rsquo;s your sense about to linger on the idea of what kind of</p>
<p>mechanism would be effective at walking? You said just a neural network, not maybe the kind we have,</p>
<p>but something a little bit better, would be able to walk easily. Don&rsquo;t you think it also needs to know</p>
<p>like a huge amount of knowledge that&rsquo;s represented under the flag of common sense reasoning?</p>
<p>How much common sense knowledge do we actually have? Imagine that you are really hardworking</p>
<p>for all your life and you form two new concepts every half hour or so. You end up with something</p>
<p>like a million concepts because you don&rsquo;t get that old. So a million concepts, that&rsquo;s not a lot.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just a million concepts. I think it would be a lot. I personally think it might be</p>
<p>much more than a million. But if you think just about the numbers, you don&rsquo;t live that long.</p>
<p>If you think about how many cycles do your neurons have in your life, it&rsquo;s quite limited.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get that old. Yeah, but the powerful thing is the number of concepts, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably deeply hierarchical in nature. The relations, as you described between them,</p>
<p>is the key thing. So it&rsquo;s like, even if it&rsquo;s a million concepts, the graph of relations that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>formed and some kind of, perhaps, some kind of probabilistic relationships, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s common</p>
<p>sense reasoning is the relationship between things. Yeah, so in some sense, I think of the concepts as</p>
<p>the address space for our behavior programs. And the behavior programs allow us to recognize objects</p>
<p>and interact with them, also mental objects. And a large part of that is the physical world that we</p>
<p>interact with, which is this RAS extender thing, which is basically navigation of information in</p>
<p>space. And basically, it&rsquo;s similar to a game engine. It&rsquo;s a physics engine that you can use to</p>
<p>describe and predict how things that look in a particular way, that feel when you touch them in</p>
<p>a particular way, that love proprioception, that love auditory, for example. So it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of auditory perception and so on, how they work out. So basically, the geometry of all these</p>
<p>things. And this is probably 80% of what our brain is doing is dealing with that, with this real time</p>
<p>simulation. And by itself, a game engine is fascinating, but it&rsquo;s not that hard to understand</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s doing. And our game engines are already, in some sense, approximating the fidelity of what</p>
<p>we can perceive. So if we put on an Oculus Quest, we get something that is still relatively crude</p>
<p>with respect to what we can perceive, but it&rsquo;s also in the same ballpark already. It&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>couple order of magnitudes away from saturating our perception in terms of the complexity that</p>
<p>it can produce. So in some sense, it&rsquo;s reasonable to say that the computer that you can buy and put</p>
<p>into your home is able to give a perceptual reality that has a detail that is already in</p>
<p>the same ballpark as what your brain can process. And everything else are ideas about the world.</p>
<p>And I suspect that they are relatively sparse and also the intuitive models that we form about</p>
<p>social interaction. Social interaction is not so hard. It&rsquo;s just hard for us nerds because we all</p>
<p>have our wires crossed, so we need to deduce them. But the pyres are present in most social animals.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting thing to notice that many domestic social animals, like cats and dogs,</p>
<p>have better social cognition than children. Right. I hope so. I hope it&rsquo;s not that many concepts</p>
<p>fundamentally to do to exist in this world. For me, it&rsquo;s more like I&rsquo;m afraid so because this</p>
<p>thing that we only appear to be so complex to each other because we are so stupid is a little</p>
<p>bit depressing. Yeah, to me that&rsquo;s inspiring if we&rsquo;re indeed as stupid as it seems. The things</p>
<p>our brains don&rsquo;t scale and the information processing that we build tend to scale very well.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, one of the things that worries me is that the fact that the brain doesn&rsquo;t scale</p>
<p>means that that&rsquo;s actually a fundamental feature of the brain. All the flaws of the brain,</p>
<p>everything we see that we see as limitations, perhaps there&rsquo;s a fundamental, the constraints</p>
<p>on the system could be a requirement of its power, which is different than our current</p>
<p>understanding of intelligent systems where scale, especially with deep learning, especially with</p>
<p>reinforcement learning, the hope behind OpenAI and DeepMind, all the major results really have</p>
<p>to do with huge compute. It could also be that our brains are so small, not just because they</p>
<p>take up so much glucose in our body, like 20% of the glucose, so they don&rsquo;t arbitrarily scale.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some animals like elephants which have larger brains than us and they don&rsquo;t seem to be</p>
<p>smarter. Elephants seem to be autistic. They have very, very good motor control and they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>good with details, but they really struggle to see the big picture. So you can make them</p>
<p>recreate drawings stroke by stroke, they can do that, but they cannot reproduce a still life. So</p>
<p>they cannot make a drawing of a scene that they see. They will always be only able to reproduce</p>
<p>the line drawing, at least as far from what I could see in the experiments. So why is that?</p>
<p>Maybe smarter elephants would meditate themselves out of existence because their brains are too</p>
<p>large. So basically the elephants that were not autistic, they didn&rsquo;t reproduce.</p>
<p>Yeah. So we have to remember that the brain is fundamentally interlinked with the body in our</p>
<p>human and biological system. Do you think that AGI systems that we try to create or greater</p>
<p>intelligent systems would need to have a body? I think they should be able to make use of a body</p>
<p>if you give it to them. But I don&rsquo;t think that they fundamentally need a body. So I suspect if</p>
<p>you can interact with the world by moving your eyes and your head, you can make controlled</p>
<p>experiments. And this allows you to have many magnitudes, fewer observations in order to reduce</p>
<p>the uncertainty in your models. So you can pinpoint the areas in your models where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not quite sure and you just move your head and see what&rsquo;s going on over there and you get additional</p>
<p>information. If you just have to use YouTube as an input and you cannot do anything beyond this,</p>
<p>you probably need just much more data. But we have much more data. So if you can build a system that</p>
<p>has enough time and attention to browse all of YouTube and extract all the information that there</p>
<p>is to be found, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an obvious limit to what it can do. Yeah, but it seems that</p>
<p>the interactivity is a fundamental thing that the physical body allows you to do. But let me ask on</p>
<p>that topic sort of that that&rsquo;s what a body is, is allowing the brain to like touch things and move</p>
<p>things and interact with the whether the physical world exists or not, whatever, but interact with</p>
<p>some interface to the physical world. What about a virtual world? Do you think we can do the same kind</p>
<p>of reasoning, consciousness, intelligence if we put on a VR headset and move over to that world?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s any fundamental difference between the interface to the physical world that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s here in this hotel and if we were sitting in the same hotel in a virtual world? The question</p>
<p>is, does this nonphysical world or this other environment entice you to solve problems that</p>
<p>require general intelligence? If it doesn&rsquo;t, then you probably will not develop general intelligence</p>
<p>and arguably most people are not generally intelligent because they don&rsquo;t have to solve</p>
<p>problems that make them generally intelligent. And even for us, it&rsquo;s not yet clear if we are smart</p>
<p>enough to build AI and understand our own nature to this degree. So it could be a matter of capacity</p>
<p>and for most people, it&rsquo;s in the first place a matter of interest. They don&rsquo;t see the point</p>
<p>because the benefit of attempting this project are marginal because you&rsquo;re probably not going</p>
<p>to succeed in it and the cost of trying to do it requires complete dedication of your entire life.</p>
<p>Right? But it seems like the possibilities of what you can do in the virtual world,</p>
<p>so imagine that is much greater than you can in the real world. So imagine a situation,</p>
<p>maybe interesting option for me. If somebody came to me and offered what I&rsquo;ll do is,</p>
<p>so from now on, you can only exist in the virtual world. And so you put on this headset and when you</p>
<p>eat, we&rsquo;ll make sure to connect your body up in a way that when you eat in the virtual world,</p>
<p>your body will be nourished in the same way in the virtual world. So the aligning incentives</p>
<p>between our common sort of real world and the virtual world, but then the possibilities become</p>
<p>much bigger. Like I could be other kinds of creatures. I could do, I can break the laws</p>
<p>of physics as we know them. I could do a lot. I mean, the possibilities are endless, right? As far</p>
<p>as we think it&rsquo;s an interesting thought, whether like what existence would be like, what kind of</p>
<p>intelligence would emerge there? What kind of consciousness? What kind of maybe greater</p>
<p>intelligence, even in me, Lex, even at this stage in my life, if I spend the next 20 years in that</p>
<p>world to see how that intelligence emerges. And if that happened at the very beginning,</p>
<p>before I was even cognizant of my existence in this physical world, it&rsquo;s interesting to think</p>
<p>how that child would develop. And the way virtual reality and digitization of everything is moving,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not completely out of the realm of possibility that we&rsquo;re all, that some part of our lives will,</p>
<p>if not entirety of it, will live in a virtual world to a greater degree than we currently have</p>
<p>living on Twitter and social media and so on. Do you have, I mean, does something draw you</p>
<p>intellectually or naturally in terms of thinking about AI to this virtual world where more</p>
<p>possibilities are? I think that currently it&rsquo;s a waste of time to deal with the physical world</p>
<p>before we have mechanisms that can automatically learn how to deal with it.</p>
<p>The body gives you second order agency, but what constitutes the body is the things that</p>
<p>you can indirectly control. The third order are tools, and the second order is the things that</p>
<p>are basically always present, but you operate on them with first order things, which are mental</p>
<p>operators. And the zero order is in some sense, the direct sense of what you&rsquo;re deciding. Right.</p>
<p>So you observe yourself initiating an action, there are features that you interpret as the</p>
<p>initiation of an action. Then you perform the operations that you perform to make that happen.</p>
<p>And then you see the movement of your limbs and you learn to associate those and thereby model</p>
<p>your own agency over this feedback, right? But the first feedback that you get is from this first</p>
<p>order thing already. Basically, you decide to think a thought and the thought is being thought.</p>
<p>You decide to change the thought and you observe how the thought is being changed.</p>
<p>And in some sense, this is, you could say, an embodiment already, right? And I suspect it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sufficient as an embodiment for intelligence. And so it&rsquo;s not that important at least at</p>
<p>this time to consider variations in the second order. Yes. But the thing that you also put</p>
<p>mentioned just now is physics that you could change in any way you want.</p>
<p>So you need an environment that puts up resistance against you. If there&rsquo;s nothing to control,</p>
<p>you cannot make models, right? There needs to be a particular way that resists you.</p>
<p>And by the way, your motivation is usually outside of your mind. It resists you. Motivation</p>
<p>is what gets you up in the morning even though it would be much less work to stay in bed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically forcing you to resist the environment and it forces your mind to serve it,</p>
<p>to serve this resistance to the environment. So in some sense, it is also putting up resistance</p>
<p>against the natural tendency of the mind to not do anything. Yeah. So some of that resistance,</p>
<p>just like you described with motivation is like in the first order, it&rsquo;s in the mind.</p>
<p>Some resistance is in the second order, like actual physical objects pushing against you and so on.</p>
<p>It seems that the second order stuff in virtual reality could be recreated.</p>
<p>Of course. But it might be sufficient that you just do mathematics and mathematics is already</p>
<p>putting up enough resistance against you. So basically just with an aesthetic motive,</p>
<p>this could maybe sufficient to form a type of intelligence. It would probably not be a very</p>
<p>human intelligence, but it might be one that is already general. So to mess with this zero order,</p>
<p>maybe first order, what do you think about ideas of brain computer interfaces? So again, returning</p>
<p>to our friend Elon Musk and Neuralink, a company that&rsquo;s trying to, of course, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>a trying to cure diseases and so on with a near term, but the longterm vision is to add an extra</p>
<p>layer to basically expand the capacity of the brain connected to the computational world.</p>
<p>Do you think one that&rsquo;s possible too, how does that change the fundamentals of the zeroth order</p>
<p>in the first order? It&rsquo;s technically possible, but I don&rsquo;t see that the FDA would ever allow me to</p>
<p>drill holes in my skull to interface my neocortex the way Elon Musk envisions. So at the moment,</p>
<p>I can do horrible things to mice, but I&rsquo;m not able to do useful things to people,</p>
<p>except maybe at some point down the line in medical applications. So this thing that we</p>
<p>are envisioning, which means recreational and creational brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>are probably not going to happen in the present legal system.</p>
<p>I love it how I&rsquo;m asking you out there philosophical and sort of engineering</p>
<p>questions. And for the first time ever, you jumped to the legal FDA.</p>
<p>There would be enough people that would be crazy enough to have holes drilled in their skull to</p>
<p>try a new type of brain computer interface. But also, if it works, FDA will approve it.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, it&rsquo;s like, you know, I work a lot with autonomous vehicles. Yes,</p>
<p>you can say that it&rsquo;s going to be a very difficult regulatory process of approving</p>
<p>autonomous, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean autonomous vehicles are never going to happen.</p>
<p>No, they will totally happen as soon as we create jobs for at least two lawyers</p>
<p>and one regulator per car.</p>
<p>Yes, lawyers, that&rsquo;s actually like lawyers is the fundamental substrate of reality.</p>
<p>In the US, it&rsquo;s a very weird system. It&rsquo;s not universal in the world. The law is a very</p>
<p>interesting software once you realize it, right? These circuits are in some sense streams of</p>
<p>software and this is largely works by exception handling. So you make decisions on the ground</p>
<p>and they get synchronized with the next level structure as soon as an exception is being</p>
<p>thrown. So it escalates the exception handling. The process is very expensive,</p>
<p>especially since it incentivizes the lawyers for producing work for lawyers.</p>
<p>Yes, so the exceptions are actually incentivized for firing often. But to return, outside of</p>
<p>lawyers, is there anything interesting, insightful about the possibility of this extra layer</p>
<p>of intelligence added to the brain?</p>
<p>I do think so, but I don&rsquo;t think that you need technically invasive procedures to do</p>
<p>so. We can already interface with other people by observing them very, very closely and getting</p>
<p>in some kind of empathetic resonance. And I&rsquo;m not very good at this, but I noticed that</p>
<p>people are able to do this to some degree. And it basically means that we model an interface</p>
<p>layer of the other person in real time. And it works despite our neurons being slow because</p>
<p>most of the things that we do are built on periodic processes. So you just need to entrain</p>
<p>yourself with the oscillation that happens. And if the oscillation itself changes slowly</p>
<p>enough, you can basically follow along.</p>
<p>Right. But the bandwidth of the interaction, it seems like you can do a lot more computation</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course. But the other thing is that the bandwidth that our brain, our own mind is</p>
<p>running on is actually quite slow. So the number of thoughts that I can productively</p>
<p>think in any given day is quite limited. If they had the discipline to write it down</p>
<p>and the speed to write it down, maybe it would be a book every day or so. But if you think</p>
<p>about the computers that we can build, the magnitudes at which they operate, this would</p>
<p>be nothing. It&rsquo;s something that it can put out in a second.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know. So it&rsquo;s possible the number of thoughts you have in your brain is&hellip; It</p>
<p>could be several orders of magnitude higher than what you&rsquo;re possibly able to express</p>
<p>through your fingers or through your voice.</p>
<p>Most of them are going to be repetitive because they&hellip;</p>
<p>How do you know that?</p>
<p>If they have to control the same problems every day. When I walk, there are going to</p>
<p>be processes in my brain that model my walking pattern and regulate them and so on. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be pretty much the same every day.</p>
<p>But that could be&hellip;</p>
<p>Every step.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m talking about intellectual reasoning, thinking. So the question, what is the best</p>
<p>system of government? So you sit down and start thinking about that. One of the constraints</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t have access to a lot of facts, a lot of studies. You always have to</p>
<p>interface with something else to learn more, to aid in your reasoning process. If you can</p>
<p>directly access all of Wikipedia in trying to understand what is the best form of government,</p>
<p>then every thought won&rsquo;t be stuck in a loop. Every thought that requires some extra piece</p>
<p>of information will be able to grab it really quickly. That&rsquo;s the possibility of if the</p>
<p>bottleneck is literally the information that&hellip; The bottleneck of breakthrough ideas is just</p>
<p>being able to quickly access huge amounts of information, then the possibility of connecting</p>
<p>your brain to the computer could lead to totally new breakthroughs. You can think of mathematicians</p>
<p>being able to just up the orders of magnitude of power in their reasoning about</p>
<p>mathematical proofs. What if humanity has already discovered the optimal form of</p>
<p>government through an evolutionary process? There is an evolution going on. So what we</p>
<p>discover is that maybe the problem of government doesn&rsquo;t have stable solutions for us as a species,</p>
<p>because we are not designed in such a way that we can make everybody conform to them.</p>
<p>But there could be solutions that work under given circumstances or that are the best for</p>
<p>certain environment and depends on, for instance, the primary forms of ownership and the means</p>
<p>of production. So if the main means of production is land, then the forms of government will be</p>
<p>regulated by the landowners and you get a monarchy. If you also want to have a form of</p>
<p>government in which you depend on some form of slavery, for instance, where the peasants have</p>
<p>to work very long hours for very little gain, so very few people can have plumbing, then maybe</p>
<p>you need to promise them to get paid in the afterlife, the overtime. So you need a theocracy.</p>
<p>And so for much of human history in the West, we had a combination of monarchy and theocracy</p>
<p>that was our form of governance. At the same time, the Catholic Church implemented game theoretic</p>
<p>principles. I recently reread Thomas Aquinas. It&rsquo;s very interesting to see this because he was not</p>
<p>dualist. He was translating Aristotle in a particular way for designing an operating</p>
<p>system for the Catholic society. And he says that basically people are animals in very much the same</p>
<p>way as Aristotle envisions, which is basically organisms with cybernetic control. And then he</p>
<p>says that there are additional rational principles that humans can discover and everybody can</p>
<p>discover them so they are universal. If you are sane, you should understand, you should submit to</p>
<p>them because you can rationally deduce them. And these principles are roughly you should be willing</p>
<p>to self regulate correctly. You should be willing to do correct social regulation. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>intraorganismic. You should be willing to act on your models so you have skin in the game.</p>
<p>And you should have goal rationality. You should be choosing the right</p>
<p>goals to work on. So basically these three rational principles, goal rationality he calls</p>
<p>prudence or wisdom, social regulation is justice, the correct social one, and the internal regulation</p>
<p>is temperance. And this willingness to act on your models is courage. And then he says that</p>
<p>there are additionally to these four cardinal virtues, three divine virtues. And these three</p>
<p>divine virtues cannot be rationally deduced, but they reveal themselves by the harmony, which means</p>
<p>if you assume them and you extrapolate what&rsquo;s going to happen, you will see that they make sense.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s often been misunderstood as God has to tell you that these are the things. So basically</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something nefarious going on. The Christian conspiracy forces you to believe</p>
<p>some guy with a long beard that they discovered this. So these principles are relatively simple.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s for high level organization for the resulting civilization that you form.</p>
<p>A commitment to unity. So basically you serve this higher, larger thing,</p>
<p>this structural principle on the next level. And he calls that faith. Then there needs to be a</p>
<p>commitment to shared purpose. This is basically this global reward that you try to figure out</p>
<p>what that should be and how you can facilitate this. And this is love. The commitment to shared</p>
<p>purpose is the core of love, right? You see the sacred thing that is more important than your own</p>
<p>organismic interests in the other, and you serve this together. And this is how you see the sacred</p>
<p>in the other. And the last one is hope, which means you need to be willing to act on that</p>
<p>principle without getting rewards in the here and now because it doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.</p>
<p>Then you start out building the civilization, right? So you need to be able to do this in the</p>
<p>absence of its actual existence yet. So it can come into being. So the way it comes into being</p>
<p>is by you accepting those notions and then you see these three divine concepts and you see them</p>
<p>realized. Divine is a loaded concept in our world because we are outside of this cult and we are</p>
<p>still scarred from breaking free of it. But the idea is basically we need to have a civilization</p>
<p>that acts as an intentional agent, like an insect state. And we are not actually a tribal species,</p>
<p>we are a state building species. And what enables state building is basically the formation of</p>
<p>religious states and other forms of rule based administration in which the individual doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter as much as the rule or the higher goal. We got there by the question, what&rsquo;s the optimal</p>
<p>form of governance? So I don&rsquo;t think that Catholicism is the optimal form of governance</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s obviously on the way out, right? So it is for the present type of society that we are</p>
<p>in. Religious institutions don&rsquo;t seem to be optimal to organize that. So what we discovered right now</p>
<p>that we live in in the West is democracy. And democracy is the rule of oligarchs that are the</p>
<p>people that currently own the means of production that is administered not by the oligarchs</p>
<p>themselves because there&rsquo;s too much disruption. We have so much innovation that we have in every</p>
<p>generation new means of production that we invent. And corporations die usually after 30 years or so</p>
<p>and something other takes a leading role in our societies. So it&rsquo;s administered by institutions</p>
<p>and these institutions themselves are not elected but they provide continuity and they are led by</p>
<p>electable politicians. And this makes it possible that you can adapt to change without having to</p>
<p>kill people, right? So you can, for instance, have a change in governments if people think that the</p>
<p>current government is too corrupt or is not up to date, you can just elect new people. Or if a</p>
<p>journalist finds out something inconvenient about the institution and the institution has no plan B</p>
<p>like in Russia, the journalist has to die. This is when you run society by the deep state. So ideally</p>
<p>you have an administration layer that you can change if something bad happens, right? So you</p>
<p>will have a continuity in the whole thing. And this is the system that we came up in the West.</p>
<p>And the way it&rsquo;s set up in the US is largely a result of low level models. So it&rsquo;s mostly just</p>
<p>second, third order consequences that people are modeling in the design of these institutions. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a relatively young society that doesn&rsquo;t really take care of the downstream effects of</p>
<p>many of the decisions that are being made. And I suspect that AI can help us this in a way if you</p>
<p>can fix the incentives. The society of the US is a society of cheaters. It&rsquo;s basically cheating is</p>
<p>so indistinguishable from innovation and we want to encourage innovation. Can you elaborate on what</p>
<p>you mean by cheating? It&rsquo;s basically people do things that they know are wrong. It&rsquo;s acceptable</p>
<p>to do things that you know are wrong in this society to a certain degree. You can, for instance,</p>
<p>suggest some non sustainable business models and implement them. Right. But you&rsquo;re always pushing</p>
<p>the boundaries. I mean, yes, this is seen as a good thing largely. Yes. And this is different</p>
<p>from other societies. So for instance, social mobility is an aspect of this. Social mobility</p>
<p>is the result of individual innovation that would not be sustainable at scale for everybody else.</p>
<p>Right. Normally you should not go up, you should go deep, right? We need bakers and if we are very</p>
<p>very good bakers, but in a society that innovates, maybe you can replace all the bakers with a really</p>
<p>good machine. Right. And that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. And it&rsquo;s a thing that made the US so successful,</p>
<p>right? But it also means that the US is not optimizing for sustainability, but for innovation.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not obvious as the evolutionary process is unrolling, it&rsquo;s not obvious that that</p>
<p>long term would be better. It has side effects. So you basically, if you cheat, you will have a</p>
<p>certain layer of toxic sludge that covers everything that is a result of cheating.</p>
<p>And we have to unroll this evolutionary process to figure out if these side effects are so damaging</p>
<p>that the system is horrible, or if the benefits actually outweigh the negative effects.</p>
<p>How do we get to which system of government is best? That was from,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to trace back the last like five minutes.</p>
<p>I suspect that we can find a way back to AI by thinking about the way in which our brain has to</p>
<p>organize itself. In some sense, our brain is a society of neurons. And our mind is a society</p>
<p>of behaviors. And they need to be organizing themselves into a structure that implements</p>
<p>regulation and government is social regulation. We often see government as the manifestation of</p>
<p>power or local interests, but it&rsquo;s actually a platform for negotiating the conditions of human</p>
<p>survival. And this platform emerges over the current needs and possibilities and the trajectory</p>
<p>that we have. So given the present state, there are only so many options on how we can move into</p>
<p>the next state without completely disrupting everything. And we mostly agree that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bad idea to disrupt everything because it will endanger our food supply for a while and the entire</p>
<p>infrastructure and fabric of society. So we do try to find natural transitions,</p>
<p>and there are not that many natural transitions available at any given point.</p>
<p>What do you mean by natural transitions?</p>
<p>So we try not to have revolutions if we can have it.</p>
<p>Right. So speaking of revolutions and the connection between government systems and the mind,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve also said that in some sense, becoming an adult means you take charge of your emotions.</p>
<p>Maybe you never said that. Maybe I just made that up. But in the context of the mind,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of emotion? And what is it? First of all, what is emotion? What&rsquo;s its role?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s several things. So psychologists often distinguish between emotion and feeling,</p>
<p>and in common day parlance, we don&rsquo;t. I think that emotion is a configuration of the cognitive</p>
<p>system. And that&rsquo;s especially true for the lowest level for the affective state. So when you have</p>
<p>an affect, it&rsquo;s the configuration of certain modulation parameters like arousal, valence,</p>
<p>your attentional focus, whether it&rsquo;s wide or narrow, inter reception or extra reception,</p>
<p>and so on. And all these parameters together put you in a certain way. You relate to the</p>
<p>environment and to yourself, and this is in some sense an emotional configuration.</p>
<p>In the more narrow sense, an emotion is an affective state. It has an object,</p>
<p>and the relevance of that object is given by motivation. And motivation is a bunch of needs</p>
<p>that are associated with rewards, things that give you pleasure and pain. And you don&rsquo;t actually act</p>
<p>on your needs, you act on models of your needs. Because when the pleasure and pain manifest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too late, you&rsquo;ve done everything. So you act on expectations that will give you pleasure and</p>
<p>pain. And these are your purposes. The needs don&rsquo;t form a hierarchy, they just coexist and compete.</p>
<p>And your brain has to find a dynamic homeostasis between them. But the purposes need to be</p>
<p>consistent. So you basically can create a story for your life and make plans. And so we organize</p>
<p>them all into hierarchies. And there is not a unique solution for this. Some people eat to make</p>
<p>art and other people make art to eat. They might end up doing the same things, but they cooperate</p>
<p>in very different ways. Because their ultimate goals are different. And we cooperate based on</p>
<p>shared purpose. Everything else that is not cooperation on shared purpose is transactional.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I understood that last piece of achieving the homeostasis.</p>
<p>Are you distinguishing between the experience of emotion and the expression of emotion?</p>
<p>Of course. So the experience of emotion is a feeling. And in this sense, what you feel is</p>
<p>an appraisal that your perceptual system has made of the situation at hand. And it makes this based</p>
<p>on your motivation and on your estimates, not your but of the subconscious geometric parts of your</p>
<p>mind that assess the situation in the world with something like a neural network. And this neural</p>
<p>network is making itself known to the symbolic parts of your mind, to your conscious attention</p>
<p>by mapping them as features into a space. So what you will feel about your emotion is a projection</p>
<p>usually into your body map. So you might feel anxiety in your solar plexus, and you might feel</p>
<p>it as a contraction, which is all geometry. Your body map is the space that is always instantiated</p>
<p>and always available. So it&rsquo;s a very obvious cheat if your non symbolic parts of your brain</p>
<p>try to talk to your symbolic parts of your brain to map the feelings into the body map.</p>
<p>And then you perceive them as pleasant and unpleasant, depending on whether the appraisal</p>
<p>has a negative or positive valence. And then you have different features of them that give you</p>
<p>more knowledge about the nature of what you&rsquo;re feeling. So for instance, when you feel</p>
<p>connected to other people, you typically feel this in your chest region around the heart.</p>
<p>And you feel this is an expansive feeling in which you&rsquo;re reaching out, right? And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very intuitive to encode it like this. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s encoded like this. It&rsquo;s a code in which the</p>
<p>non symbolic parts of your mind talk to the symbolic ones. And then the expression of emotion</p>
<p>is then the final step that could be sort of gestural or visual and so on. That&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>the communication. This probably evolved as part of an adversarial communication. So as soon as</p>
<p>you started to observe the facial expression and posture of others to understand what emotional</p>
<p>state they&rsquo;re in, others started to use this as signaling and also to subvert your model of their</p>
<p>emotional state. So we now look at the inflections, at the difference between the standard face that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to make in this situation. When you are at a funeral, everybody expects you to make a</p>
<p>solemn face, but the solemn face doesn&rsquo;t express whether you&rsquo;re sad or not. It just expresses that</p>
<p>you understand what face you have to make at a funeral. Nobody should know that you are triumphant.</p>
<p>So when you try to read the emotion of another person, you try to look at the delta</p>
<p>between a truly sad expression and the things that are animating this face behind the curtain.</p>
<p>So the interesting thing is, so having done this podcast and the video component, one of the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned is that now I&rsquo;m Russian and I just don&rsquo;t know how to express emotion on my face.</p>
<p>One, I see that as weakness, but whatever. The people look to me after you say something,</p>
<p>they look to my face to help them see how they should feel about what you said,</p>
<p>which is fascinating because then they&rsquo;ll often comment on why did you look bored or why did you</p>
<p>particularly enjoy that part or why did you whatever. It&rsquo;s a kind of interesting, it makes</p>
<p>me cognizant of I&rsquo;m part, like you&rsquo;re basically saying a bunch of brilliant things, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>part of the play that you&rsquo;re the key actor in by making my facial expressions and then</p>
<p>therefore telling the narrative of what the big, like the big point is, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>Makes me cognizant that I&rsquo;m supposed to be making facial expressions. Even this conversation is hard</p>
<p>because my preference would be to wear a mask with sunglasses to where I could just listen.</p>
<p>Yes, I understand this because it&rsquo;s intrusive to interact with others this way. And basically</p>
<p>Eastern European society have a taboo against that and especially Russia,</p>
<p>the further you go to the East and in the US it&rsquo;s the opposite. You&rsquo;re expected to be</p>
<p>hyperanimated in your face and you&rsquo;re also expected to show positive affect.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And if you show positive affect without a good reason in Russia,</p>
<p>people will think you are a stupid, unsophisticated person.</p>
<p>Exactly. And here positive affect without reason goes either appreciated or goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the default. It&rsquo;s being expected. Everything is amazing. Have you seen these?</p>
<p>Lego movie?</p>
<p>No, there was a diagram where somebody gave the appraisals that exist in the US and Russia,</p>
<p>so you have your bell curve. And the lower 10% in the US, it&rsquo;s a good start. Everything</p>
<p>above the lowest 10%, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And for Russians, everything below the top 10%, it&rsquo;s terrible. And then everything except the</p>
<p>top percent is, I don&rsquo;t like it. And the top percent is even so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, but it&rsquo;s kind of true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deeper aspect to this. It&rsquo;s also how we construct meaning in the US. Usually you focus on</p>
<p>the positive aspects and you just suppress the negative aspects. And in our Eastern European</p>
<p>traditions, we emphasize the fact that if you hold something above the waterline, you also need to</p>
<p>put something below the waterline because existence by itself is as best neutral.</p>
<p>Right. That&rsquo;s the basic intuition, at best neutral. Or it could be just suffering,</p>
<p>the default is suffering.</p>
<p>There are moments of beauty, but these moments of beauty are inextricably linked to the reality</p>
<p>of suffering. And to not acknowledge the reality of suffering means that you are really stupid and</p>
<p>unaware of the fact that basically every conscious being spends most of the time suffering.</p>
<p>Yeah. You just summarized the ethos of the Eastern Europe. Yeah. Most of life is suffering</p>
<p>with an occasional moments of beauty. And if your facial expressions don&rsquo;t acknowledge</p>
<p>the abundance of suffering in the world and in existence itself, then you must be an idiot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thing when you raise children in the US and you, in some sense,</p>
<p>preserve the identity of the intellectual and cultural traditions that are embedded in your</p>
<p>own families. And your daughter asks you about Ariel the mermaid and asks you,</p>
<p>why is Ariel not allowed to play with the humans? And you tell her the truth. She&rsquo;s a siren. Sirens</p>
<p>eat people. You don&rsquo;t play with your food. It does not end well. And then you tell her the original</p>
<p>story, which is not the one by Anderson, which is the romantic one. And there&rsquo;s a much darker one,</p>
<p>which is Undine&rsquo;s story. What happened? So Undine is a mermaid or a water woman. She lives on the</p>
<p>ground of a river and she meets this prince and they fall in love. And the prince really,</p>
<p>really wants to be with her. And she says, okay, but the deal is you cannot have any other woman.</p>
<p>If you marry somebody else, even though you cannot be with me, because obviously you cannot breathe</p>
<p>underwater and have other things to do than managing your kingdom as you have here, you will</p>
<p>die. And eventually after a few years, he falls in love with some princess and marries her. And</p>
<p>she shows up and quietly goes into his chamber and nobody is able to stop her or willing to do</p>
<p>so because she is fierce. And she comes quietly and sad out of his chamber. And they ask her,</p>
<p>what has happened? What did you do? And she said, I kissed him to death.</p>
<p>All done.</p>
<p>And you know the Anderson story, right? In the Anderson story, the mermaid is playing with</p>
<p>this prince that she saves and she falls in love with him and she cannot live out there. So she is</p>
<p>giving up her voice and her tale for a human like appearance so she can walk among the humans. But</p>
<p>this guy does not recognize that she is the one that you would marry. Instead, he marries somebody</p>
<p>who has a kingdom and economical and political relationships to his own kingdom and so on,</p>
<p>as he should. And she dies.</p>
<p>Yeah. Instead, Disney, the Little Mermaid story has a little bit of a happy ending. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>Western, that&rsquo;s the American way.</p>
<p>My own problem is this, of course, that I read Oscar Wilde before I read the other things. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m indoctrinated, inoculated with this romanticism. And I think that the mermaid is right. You</p>
<p>sacrifice your life for romantic love. That&rsquo;s what you do. Because if you are confronted with</p>
<p>either serving the machine and doing the obviously right thing under the economic and social and</p>
<p>other human incentives, that&rsquo;s wrong. You should follow your heart.</p>
<p>So do you think suffering is fundamental to happiness along these lines?</p>
<p>Suffering is the result of caring about things that you cannot change. And if you are able to</p>
<p>change what you care about to those things that you can change, you will not suffer.</p>
<p>But would you then be able to experience happiness?</p>
<p>Yes. But happiness itself is not important. Happiness is like a cookie. When you are a child,</p>
<p>you think cookies are very important and you want to have all the cookies in the world,</p>
<p>you look forward to being an adult because then you have as many cookies as you want.</p>
<p>But as an adult, you realize a cookie is a tool. It&rsquo;s a tool to make you eat vegetables.</p>
<p>And once you eat your vegetables anyway, you stop eating cookies for the most part,</p>
<p>because otherwise you will get diabetes and will not be around for your kids.</p>
<p>Yes, but then the cookie, the scarcity of a cookie, if scarcity is enforced,</p>
<p>nevertheless, so like the pleasure comes from the scarcity.</p>
<p>Yes. But the happiness is a cookie that your brain bakes for itself. It&rsquo;s not made by the</p>
<p>environment. The environment cannot make you happy. It&rsquo;s your appraisal of the environment</p>
<p>that makes you happy. And if you can change the appraisal of the environment, which you can learn</p>
<p>to, then you can create arbitrary states of happiness. And some meditators fall into this</p>
<p>trap. So they discover the womb, this basement womb in their brain where the cookies are made,</p>
<p>and they indulge and stuff themselves. And after a few months, it gets really old and</p>
<p>the big crisis of meaning comes. Because they thought before that their unhappiness was the</p>
<p>result of not being happy enough. So they fixed this, right? They can release the newer</p>
<p>transmitters at will if they train. And then the crisis of meaning pops up in a deeper layer.</p>
<p>And the question is, why do I live? How can I make a sustainable civilization that is meaningful to</p>
<p>me? How can I insert myself into this? And this was the problem that you couldn&rsquo;t solve in the</p>
<p>first place. But at the end of all this, let me then ask that same question. What is the answer</p>
<p>to that? What could the possible answer be of the meaning of life? What could an answer be? What is</p>
<p>it to you? I think that if you look at the meaning of life, you look at what the cell is. Life is the</p>
<p>cell. Or this principle, the cell. It&rsquo;s this self organizing thing that can participate in evolution.</p>
<p>In order to make it work, it&rsquo;s a molecular machine. It needs a self replicator and an</p>
<p>entropy extractor and a Turing machine. If any of these parts is missing, you don&rsquo;t have a cell</p>
<p>and it is not living. And life is basically the emergent complexity over that principle.</p>
<p>Once you have this intelligent super molecule, the cell, there is very little that you cannot</p>
<p>make it do. It&rsquo;s probably the optimal computronium and especially in terms of resilience. It&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>hard to sterilize the planet once it&rsquo;s infected with life. So it&rsquo;s active function of these three</p>
<p>components or the supercell cell is present in the cell, it&rsquo;s present in us, and it&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>We are just an expression of the cell. It&rsquo;s a certain layer of complexity in the organization</p>
<p>of cells. So in a way, it&rsquo;s tempting to think of the cell as a von Neumann probe. If you want to</p>
<p>build intelligence on other planets, the best way to do this is to infect them with cells</p>
<p>and wait for long enough and there&rsquo;s a reasonable chance the stuff is going to evolve into an</p>
<p>information processing principle that is general enough to become sentient.</p>
<p>That idea is very akin to the same dream and beautiful ideas that are expressed to</p>
<p>cellular automata in their most simple mathematical form. If you just inject the system with some</p>
<p>basic mechanisms of replication and so on, basic rules, amazing things would emerge.</p>
<p>The cell is able to do something that James Trardy calls existential design. He points out</p>
<p>that in technical design, we go from the outside in. We work in a highly controlled environment in</p>
<p>which everything is deterministic, like our computers, our labs, or our engineering workshops.</p>
<p>And then we use this determinism to implement a particular kind of function that we dream up and</p>
<p>that seamlessly interfaces with all the other deterministic functions that we already have in</p>
<p>our world. So it&rsquo;s basically from the outside in. Biological systems designed from the inside out</p>
<p>as seed will become a seedling by taking some of the relatively unorganized matter around it and</p>
<p>turning it into its own structure and thereby subdue the environment. Cells can cooperate if</p>
<p>they can rely on other cells having a similar organization that is already compatible. But</p>
<p>unless that&rsquo;s there, the cell needs to divide to create that structure by itself. So it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>self organizing principle that works on a somewhat chaotic environment. And the purpose of life in</p>
<p>this sense is to produce complexity. And the complexity allows you to harvest entropy gradients</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t harvest without the complexity. And in this sense, intelligence and life are very</p>
<p>strongly connected because the purpose of intelligence is to allow control under conditions</p>
<p>and the conditions of complexity. So basically, you shift the boundary between the ordered systems</p>
<p>into the realm of chaos. You build bridge heads into chaos with complexity. And this is what we</p>
<p>are doing. This is not necessarily a deeper meaning. I think the meaning that we have priors</p>
<p>for that we are all for outside of the priors, there is no meaning. Meaning only exists if the</p>
<p>mind projects it. That is probably civilization. I think that what feels most meaningful to me is</p>
<p>to try to build and maintain a sustainable civilization. And taking a slight step outside</p>
<p>of that, we talked about a man with a beard and God, but something, some mechanism, perhaps must</p>
<p>have planted the seed, the initial seed of the cell. Do you think there is a God? What is a God?</p>
<p>And what would that look like? If there was no spontaneous biogenesis, in the sense that the</p>
<p>first cell formed by some happy random accidents where the molecules just happened to be in the</p>
<p>right constellation to each other. But there could also be the mechanism that allows for the random.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like turtles all the way down. There seems to be, there has to be a head turtle</p>
<p>at the bottom. Let&rsquo;s consider something really wild. Imagine, is it possible that a gas giant</p>
<p>could become intelligent? What would that involve? So imagine you have vortices that spontaneously</p>
<p>emerge on the gas giants, like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years.</p>
<p>And some of these storm systems produce electromagnetic fields because some of the</p>
<p>clouds are ferromagnetic or something. And as a result, they can change how certain clouds react</p>
<p>rather than other clouds and thereby produce some self stabilizing patterns that eventually</p>
<p>lead to regulation feedback loops, nested feedback loops and control. So imagine you have such this</p>
<p>thing that basically has emergent self sustaining, self organizing complexity. And at some point,</p>
<p>this breaks up and realizes and basically lam solaris, I am a thinking planet, but I will not</p>
<p>replicate because I can recreate the conditions of my own existence somewhere else. I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>basically an intelligence that has spontaneously formed because it could. And now it builds a</p>
<p>von Neumann probe and the best von Neumann probe for such a thing might be the cell.</p>
<p>So maybe it, because it&rsquo;s very, very clever and very enduring, creates cells and sends them out.</p>
<p>And one of them has infected our planet. And I&rsquo;m not suggesting that this is the case,</p>
<p>but it would be compatible with the Prince Birmingham hypothesis. And it was my intuition</p>
<p>that our biogenesis is very unlikely. It&rsquo;s possible, but you probably need to roll the</p>
<p>cosmic dice very often, maybe more often than there are planetary surfaces. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So God is just a large enough, a system that&rsquo;s large enough that allows randomness.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think that God has anything to do with creation. I think it&rsquo;s a mistranslation</p>
<p>of the Talmud into the Catholic mythology. I think that Genesis is actually the childhood</p>
<p>memories of a God. So the, when. Sorry, Genesis is the.</p>
<p>The childhood memories of a God. It&rsquo;s basically a mind that is remembering how it came into being.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And we typically interpret Genesis as the creation of a physical universe by a supernatural being.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think when you read it, there is light and darkness that is being created. And then you</p>
<p>discover sky and ground, create them. You construct the plants and the animals and you</p>
<p>give everything their names and so on. That&rsquo;s basically cognitive development. It&rsquo;s a sequence</p>
<p>of steps that every mind has to go through when it makes sense of the world. And when you have</p>
<p>children, you can see how initially they distinguish light and darkness and then they</p>
<p>make out directions in it and they discover sky and ground and they discover the plants and the</p>
<p>animals and they give everything their name. And it&rsquo;s a creative process that happens in every mind</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not given. Your mind has to invent these structures to make sense of the patterns</p>
<p>on your retina. Also, if there was some big nerd who set up a server and runs this world on it,</p>
<p>this would not create a special relationship between us and the nerd. This nerd would not</p>
<p>have the magical power to give meaning to our existence. So this equation of a creator god</p>
<p>with the god of meaning is a sleight of hand. You shouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>The other one that is done in Catholicism is the equation of the first mover,</p>
<p>the prime mover of Aristotle, which is basically the automaton that runs the universe. Aristotle</p>
<p>says if things are moving and things seem to be moving here, something must move them. If something</p>
<p>moves them, something must move the thing that is moving it. So there must be a prime mover.</p>
<p>This idea to say that this prime mover is a supernatural being is complete nonsense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an automaton in the simplest case. So we have to explain the enormity that this automaton</p>
<p>exists at all. But again, we don&rsquo;t have any possibility to infer anything about its properties</p>
<p>except that it&rsquo;s able to produce change in information. So there needs to be some kind</p>
<p>of computational principle. This is all there is. But to say this automaton is identical again with</p>
<p>the creator of the first cause or with the thing that gives meaning to our life is confusion.</p>
<p>No, I think that what we perceive is the higher being that we are part of. The higher being that</p>
<p>we are part of is the civilization. It&rsquo;s the thing in which we have a similar relationship as the cell</p>
<p>has to our body. And we have this prior because we have evolved to organize in these structures.</p>
<p>So basically, the Christian God in its natural form without the mythology,</p>
<p>if you undress it, is basically the platonic form of the civilization.</p>
<p>Is the ideal?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s this ideal that you try to approximate when you interact with others,</p>
<p>not based on your incentives, but on what you think is right.</p>
<p>Wow, we covered a lot of ground. And we&rsquo;re left with one of my favorite lines, and there&rsquo;s many,</p>
<p>which is happiness is a cookie that the brain bakes itself. It&rsquo;s been a huge honor and a</p>
<p>pleasure to talk to you. I&rsquo;m sure our paths will cross many times again.</p>
<p>Joshua, thank you so much for talking today. I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>spell it without the E. And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Joshua Bach.</p>
<p>If you take this as a computer game metaphor, this is the best level for humanity to play.</p>
<p>And this best level happens to be the last level, as it happens against the backdrop of a dying</p>
<p>world. But it&rsquo;s still the best level. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
