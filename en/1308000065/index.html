    <p>Is Chamath in a room with his PR crew right now like rehearsing and practicing and this pod is ruined</p>
<p>Hey everybody, so I just wanted to make sure based on last week&rsquo;s pod</p>
<p>It was absolutely clear. I care about human rights</p>
<p>Many of you know my origin story. But for those of you that don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>Was born in a country that&rsquo;s no stranger to civil war and religious and political persecution</p>
<p>Growing up my family and I felt those effects it affected our safety</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in part what led my family to file for refugee status and stay in Canada. So this is a</p>
<p>Real part of my lived experience that said, you know</p>
<p>I realized that what I said last week lacked empathy particularly towards others</p>
<p>Who are dealing with persecution in this case the Uyghurs and based on what I read this week</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s happening to them in Western China is a terrible situation. I</p>
<p>Also want to talk about this idea about nobody caring</p>
<p>Look, if we take a step back and replace Uyghur with other really important issues like the conflict in Yemen the potential war in the Ukraine</p>
<p>gun control school shootings healthcare equity</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re faced with horrible events every day</p>
<p>However, the unfortunate state of the world today is that we&rsquo;ve also normalized this routine of being confronted with something tragic or horrible or</p>
<p>unjust and</p>
<p>Being allowed to react with thoughts and prayers and this was the real intent of what I was trying to get across</p>
<p>So when I talk about my line, it&rsquo;s not about whether something matters or not</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about which issues of all the important issues we face every day</p>
<p>Where I have the expertise and I believe I have the ability to have a real impact even if just by a little</p>
<p>For me those areas happen to be climate change life sciences and deep tech</p>
<p>But just because this is where I spend my time</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to take away from any of the real work. Any of you are doing in other areas and</p>
<p>Then lastly, I just wanted to explain to people who may be new to the pod because of last week</p>
<p>That this is a place where four of us four friends talk about a whole wide range of things. We explore our curiosities</p>
<p>We try to learn from each other. We challenge each other, but we&rsquo;ve always done it in a really supportive space</p>
<p>And I hope you keep that in mind as you listen and watch going forward</p>
<p>And hopefully it can you can bring some of that to your own conversations. That&rsquo;s I have to say</p>
<p>Well said</p>
<p>Sacks, I mean, I know you have something to say but I&rsquo;ll say I got a lot of messages this past week after the show</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>Which which I felt a little bit hurt by and mischaracterized and maybe it was simply I said the wrong thing at the wrong time</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>So I want to just be very clear about a couple of points if I can take a minute</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all right with you guys</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>So I said I just wanted to I was gonna actually send this out on Twitter and I decided it was better just to address</p>
<p>It on the pod. So to be clear. I strongly believe in and</p>
<p>support absolute freedom of all people and this means de facto</p>
<p>I strongly disagree with the suppression of free speech denial of religious freedom imprisonment harm capital punishment</p>
<p>Slavery and genocide. I thought this was obvious when we were having our conversation. I did not know I&rsquo;m not in favor of genocide</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in favor of genocide. I&rsquo;m not in favor of slavery or capital punishment or suppression of religious freedom</p>
<p>I thought this was obvious the conversation</p>
<p>I tried to have was the wrong conversation at the wrong time, which was to trying to talk about the broader</p>
<p>China V US narrative that is swelling and will continue to swell this decade</p>
<p>I think that the primary function of civilized society or any advanced social system is to take care of and protect those that cannot</p>
<p>Take care of or protect themselves and this is usually done by government</p>
<p>But when government fails and government is in fact the oppressor</p>
<p>I think it is the responsibility of other governments and other peoples to step in and have a voice and to take action</p>
<p>And so that is that is kind of my moral framework. I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t deny any of the harm being done to the Uyghur population in China. I don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>With it on a principled basis and I don&rsquo;t think that what the Chinese government is doing. It&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>And the point that I was trying to make during our conversation was a very different one that I think got completely lost in the moment</p>
<p>Which was really just about what&rsquo;s going on with the China US narrative right now. I&rsquo;m not pro China</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not anti China</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in understanding the broader China US dynamic and what it means for the world over the coming decade and decades</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important for us when we evaluate these things and to understand them to not just take sides</p>
<p>but to understand the context in the broadest way possible and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I am trying to get both sides and understand the mindset of the people that are involved in running these governments and</p>
<p>The way that this of this world is going to evolve as this economic tension continues to mount</p>
<p>And so that that&rsquo;s where I was trying to go</p>
<p>And I was just trying to highlight where I think everything is headed over the next decade or two</p>
<p>Independent of what are obvious human rights issues going on</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Let me just stop there and say thanks for letting me say that but that was important for me to just be really clear</p>
<p>On because clearly I wasn&rsquo;t clear last week</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll just add to what you said that I also thought it was implied that you care about these things and that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>In favor of them. I didn&rsquo;t think that need to be spoken</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nice that you&rsquo;re clarifying it</p>
<p>But I think any reasonable person would understand that if you care deeply as a vegan about factory farming that you also care</p>
<p>About humans and you know genocide and torture or whatever issue. So I I think it&rsquo;s like enough</p>
<p>Your statement is so obvious that I wonder if you even had to have made it, but I&rsquo;m glad you did sax</p>
<p>Okay, so I guess first I should say that</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s happening to the Uyghurs and China&rsquo;s indefensible you&rsquo;ve got reports of upwards of a million</p>
<p>You know of these people being held in detention camps. There&rsquo;s reports of</p>
<p>Mass sterilization and rape. It&rsquo;s like ethnic cleansing over there</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s absolutely wrong and it&rsquo;s one of a growing list of issues that we have serious problems with China on</p>
<p>Which include theft or intellectual property cyber espionage the bullying of their neighbors?</p>
<p>Their crackdown on dissidents the list goes on and on</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>I think we have to be clear-eyed about the challenge and the threat that China represents and we&rsquo;ve discussed that on this pod many times</p>
<p>That being said, you know, I think we saw this week was really about cancel culture, right?</p>
<p>you had in response to last week&rsquo;s pod you have this online mob form and</p>
<p>They want to take what Jamal said and interpret in the worst possible light</p>
<p>so they can turn the outrage meter up to 11 and everyone gets to basically go on Twitter and</p>
<p>Virtue signal and say what great people they are and because Chamath is a bad person</p>
<p>And I just want to speak to that issue</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of hypocrisy</p>
<p>Going on in that because how many of the people who are tweeting their outrage and their denunciation of Chamath are</p>
<p>Doing it from a device made by forced labor in China wearing their Nikes</p>
<p>Made by forced labor in China on their way to target to buy cheap goods made in China</p>
<p>I mean those people have actually lifted a finger in the real world to help the Uyghurs</p>
<p>How many of them have sacrificed an economic benefit?</p>
<p>In any way and so when Chamath said nobody cares</p>
<p>I thought it was a really startling statement by him</p>
<p>But if you define</p>
<p>caring as doing something more than just virtue signaling and expressing your feelings as actually making a sacrifice or</p>
<p>Taking a risk in the real world. I thought he was frankly telling us a very uncomfortable truth</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t really most of us done anything and in that sense</p>
<p>I think the reason why his comments hit such a nerve</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you get the kind of pylon that we got unless</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying something that&rsquo;s hitting a nerve and I think the nerve the thing that he exposed is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not really doing more than virtue signaling on this issue and</p>
<p>Then came all the you know, all the hypocrites. You&rsquo;ve got the NBA</p>
<p>Denouncing him issuing a statement when what have they done? I mean when Daryl Maury spoke up</p>
<p>on behalf of the protesters in Hong Kong the NBA shut down and sanctioned him and</p>
<p>You know LeBron James said he was uneducated</p>
<p>Actually, I think Daryl Maury was pretty educated about what was going on. So you&rsquo;ve got those hypocrites</p>
<p>You got the White House issuing a statement</p>
<p>disavowing</p>
<p>Chamath but Hunter Biden went over to China to manage billions of dollars for them and profited by his business dealings over there</p>
<p>So there are a bunch of hypocrites and the list goes on and on and so, you know</p>
<p>I think that if</p>
<p>In order for the mob to summon the outrage that it summons</p>
<p>It requires them to I would say first put the worst possible light on what Chamath is saying and to ignore</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the fundamental truth of it and second to engage in this massive</p>
<p>Hypocrisy and that is the way that cancel culture operates and I don&rsquo;t think we should buy into it</p>
<p>So I appreciate what what Chamath said. I think he&rsquo;s clarifying his remarks</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s showing that he does care and he does have empathy as we all should</p>
<p>But I think there was a fundamental truth in what Chamath said last week and that is what people are so uncomfortable with</p>
<p>Okay, well said I have feelings and</p>
<p>Most of all, I&rsquo;m thankful we had the discussion</p>
<p>The goal of this pod</p>
<p>I think what makes it special and why?</p>
<p>You all who are listening come here every week is because you know</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be honest with you and we&rsquo;re gonna tackle these hard discussions and I think Friedberg&rsquo;s comments and sax&rsquo;s comments</p>
<p>Really</p>
<p>Explain that and what our intent here is and is human rights is one of the hardest issues to discuss</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t hear it being discussed and there are not easy answers. And I think you know, I was challenged</p>
<p>By my besties on the episode and their questions and their challenges were absolutely critical</p>
<p>Yeah, yes, how can we care about one group of people when the people in our backyard?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not caring about are we going to invade countries? These are very nuanced difficult questions, but we must have</p>
<p>This discussion and if we try to cancel people with a 20-second clip that looks completely different</p>
<p>If you look at the two-minute clip or you take the time to have a 40-minute</p>
<p>listen of the whole segment you get a totally different picture and I</p>
<p>Think it&rsquo;s very important to raise awareness about human rights</p>
<p>And it is an issue that I have been passionate about my whole life</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not trying to virtue signal or score any points here</p>
<p>but I know firsthand that raising awareness and having the discussions reduces the violations because</p>
<p>Dictators despots and people doing this kind of stuff do not want the heat of</p>
<p>What happened this past week and what happened this past week is that more awareness was raised about the Uyghurs and the situation?</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re going through. I</p>
<p>Think then you know as somebody who&rsquo;s monitored the situation then I&rsquo;ve seen in the last couple of years</p>
<p>Perhaps this was a tipping point and that is something good that can come out of that</p>
<p>Discussion now on a personal basis. I have had some feelings of guilt</p>
<p>Because I was very hard for me to watch what happened to Chamath this week and to watch people dunking on him</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s face it I brought the topic up and</p>
<p>I dug in with my feelings and it got a little heated and and I&rsquo;m suddenly being portrayed as</p>
<p>You know like a hero in this discussion that that&rsquo;s not the intent and there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no hero or villain in this</p>
<p>There is a hard discussion in this and I am extremely proud of my friendship with each of you, especially you Chamath</p>
<p>I am extremely proud of your candidness and tackling these issues and making people think about them and</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m just so proud to be friends with each of you and I&rsquo;m so proud of the work</p>
<p>We hear we do here every week and I think it&rsquo;s important work</p>
<p>And I feel like I get smarter every week and and I hope the audience does too and I hope we can keep having these</p>
<p>discussions</p>
<p>Yeah, now let&rsquo;s yeah make fun of each other I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re allowed to laugh</p>
<p>This is like so serious and heavy. But so what you&rsquo;re saying is Thank You Chamath</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s going to be clipped for 20 seconds I&rsquo;m going to get canceled. Jason Calacatt is thanking Chamath</p>
<p>But Saxe&rsquo;s point about I mean look we&rsquo;ve talked about cancel culture a lot on this show</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve always been I think generally able to be third-party observers to what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>And it was really interesting to go through the cycle this week</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>You know, there was just kind of a an echoing narrative</p>
<p>On one thing that was said with one direction. There were a few pieces though Chamath, right?</p>
<p>I mean it wasn&rsquo;t there a piece from the Atlantic and some other pieces that kind of highlighted that</p>
<p>Things that you said were things that a lot of people won&rsquo;t say and that&rsquo;s what was really so shocking for so many people</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Peter Thiel?</p>
<p>Comment on this whole on all of this stuff. Yeah, he said if no one&rsquo;s saying it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably true or if you&rsquo;re not allowed to say it, it&rsquo;s probably true. Yeah, if you&rsquo;re not allowed to say it</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Yeah, it was what you think based on the the mob that formed and you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already kind of blown over and that&rsquo;s the way this kind of cancel culture starts</p>
<p>But for that sort of that white hot really intense day or two, you would think that like Chamath had practiced genocide himself</p>
<p>You know it</p>
<p>you know because everybody comes out and the way that they</p>
<p>Make themselves feel better is by virtue signaling on this issue</p>
<p>And again, I would just say that well, I think we should be thinking about what do we do?</p>
<p>You know, how do we actually make a difference because I don&rsquo;t think just virtually on the issue is gonna do it</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You know at the same time that this mob was forming against Chamath</p>
<p>We had a two-hour Biden press conference in which Biden never mentioned the Uyghurs once the press corps never mentioned the Uyghurs once</p>
<p>So does that mean the Uyghurs are below their line</p>
<p>You know, why wasn&rsquo;t it mentioned, you know, shouldn&rsquo;t we be ganging up on Biden?</p>
<p>Well, why is you know, why is the press getting up on Chamath when they&rsquo;re not getting up on Biden for that?</p>
<p>So there is a fair amount of hypocrisy here. I actually think Jason</p>
<p>I think you make an excellent point that by discussing these issues and raising these issues</p>
<p>it creates a little bit of a check on the people perpetrating these atrocities because</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like to be exposed that way and you know, maybe we should be boycotting the Beijing Olympics</p>
<p>I mean, maybe that should be on the table. Maybe we should be boycotting the NBA. I mean, let&rsquo;s have that</p>
<p>Conversation. Yeah, or maybe everybody who goes I wouldn&rsquo;t want to see the athletes miss the Olympics</p>
<p>But maybe they could each just raise their hand and do a you</p>
<p>Or some sort of a signal to show they support the situation or they&rsquo;re aware of it with the Uyghurs</p>
<p>There could be some, you know modest protest or statement they could make without ruining, you know, their lives work</p>
<p>I always hate when the Olympics get canceled for some political reason because I think those people work so hard for it</p>
<p>But racing awareness, you know is a noble goal in all of this and then also doing things is a noble goal</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean I it was very weird to watch the</p>
<p>The mob form and then dissipate and</p>
<p>Just who was you know, taking the time to actually listen to the full episodes</p>
<p>It was clear from that Atlantic article and some of the nuance takes that they listen to the full</p>
<p>discussion because there are bullet points here like</p>
<p>Like there was somebody asked me a very challenging question</p>
<p>I think it might have been you freeberg like are we going to start invading countries over human rights?</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s more suffering and death and pain from the wars and and when do you decide as</p>
<p>The the democracies of the world to invade the dictatorships of the world to</p>
<p>Promote human rights like this is a very difficult issue</p>
<p>That the world has had to deal with sadly before and there is no easy answer there, you know</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a point that I also try to make on the last episode like freeberg did which is I</p>
<p>Think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s actually great to have these ideals and we should have moral clarity about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>And I think it what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>Wrong it&rsquo;s outrageous. It&rsquo;s an atrocity</p>
<p>But but the question is what we do about it and</p>
<p>and the the reality is even though it&rsquo;s important to speak out about human rights these types of</p>
<p>fulminations about human rights when they become this sort of</p>
<p>You know when people when we get to this like frenzy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been the prelude and pretext for every misguided foreign intervention that we&rsquo;ve had over the last 20 years and</p>
<p>the example</p>
<p>The iraq war. I mean saddam hussein was suddenly hitler</p>
<p>you know the the goals of nation-building afghanistan for 20 years our invasion of</p>
<p>Libya, we got rid of gaddafi and we replaced it with chaos for years</p>
<p>We were talking about how evil the taliban and their social system was and then we just handed afghanistan back to them a few weeks</p>
<p>ago</p>
<p>exactly, so</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>and so these types of um, you know when when you kind of you whip people up</p>
<p>Over human rights. I mean I agree with the sentiment and I agree with the moral clarity, but I also can&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>But recognize that neocons and the military industrial complex and the washington blob have used this type of rhetoric</p>
<p>For decades to corral us and stampede us</p>
<p>Into wars and foreign interventions that don&rsquo;t make any sense and we all recognize after the whole project has gone wrong like afghanistan</p>
<p>We become suddenly more realistic about the whole thing and suddenly, you know, we&rsquo;re not talking about you know</p>
<p>The the the sort of the moral atrocities of the taliban anymore</p>
<p>But the discipline is they&rsquo;re still there. They&rsquo;re still there the discipline though is to be able to check ourselves</p>
<p>Before we get into these interventions and I don&rsquo;t think we do a good job of that</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re whipping ourselves up into these mobs and we&rsquo;re in a frenzy</p>
<p>And the the raising awareness is something that has been lacking the you know certain organizations</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very important that we don&rsquo;t take organizations that have engaged with a country. Let&rsquo;s say china or saudi arabia</p>
<p>They may have engaged in good faith with the goal of you know</p>
<p>Engagement is a positive for humanity in the world. Okay, if we engage with china and we are co-dependent on each other</p>
<p>Um that will lead to a better arc for human rights and for humanity and less wars because our</p>
<p>Economies are entangled and we do business together. Okay. This is a a fine premise</p>
<p>What the dictators and despots want you to do is to fight each other and not look at the human rights atrocities</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier for us to say. Oh the nba. Oh apple. Oh</p>
<p>You know pick the uh, the the company or corporate interest or organization that has engaged</p>
<p>um, but by raising awareness, um</p>
<p>Consistently</p>
<p>It gives other people the ability to talk about this</p>
<p>Some organizations weren&rsquo;t willing to even talk about this or say the name</p>
<p>Uyghurs and if we keep talking about the uyghurs the chances that that situation improves</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a chance it does improve but I do think this like notion that the four of us can get together on</p>
<p>a podcast and not get canceled</p>
<p>Because you know, we we don&rsquo;t collect money from advertisers and we started having these conversations amongst friends and we just put it on the internet</p>
<p>Um, first of all, it&rsquo;s a great kind of reflection of what you can do in the united states</p>
<p>The freedom of speech that we have and we can just put this on the internet. Anyone can watch it around the world</p>
<p>Uh, I don&rsquo;t know how many people are watching it, but mostly freedom of speech mostly freedom of speech</p>
<p>But I do think that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty valuable and I do think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>You know an important point for us is you know as much as chamath got completely</p>
<p>destroyed this week</p>
<p>Um, you know the I gotta I gotta say other than covid i&rsquo;m uh, i&rsquo;m feeling pretty good you feel better</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pretty bummed for a day or two</p>
<p>I mean, I think the the covid thing was scary because four of my five kids got it. Um,</p>
<p>So I was just like oh my god, how&rsquo;s everyone doing by the way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be very honest with you. So, uh between both houses, um, you know mine and my ex-wife&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Four of the five kids got it</p>
<p>Our nanny got it nat did not and the youngest baby did not</p>
<p>Uh, there&rsquo;s a real difference between in my house</p>
<p>how the boys</p>
<p>Experienced covid and how the girls experienced covid quite honestly it</p>
<p>Like we you know, we&rsquo;ve expressed certain symptoms specifically a really bad sore throat and a cough</p>
<p>That the girls in our house did not the girls had more intestinal issues. The boys roughly did not</p>
<p>So it all manifested kind of in odd ways</p>
<p>Uh, but god my god, I mean what a pain in the ass</p>
<p>Well to be going through that and then also like monitoring twitter and inbound your phone must have been blowing up</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t doing any of that. Okay, jason start the pod. Let&rsquo;s go. All right. Well, okay everybody welcome to the podcast with us</p>
<p>Uh the sultan of science who&rsquo;s got a new startup. He launched we&rsquo;ll hear about that later in the show</p>
<p>the rain man himself and</p>
<p>dare I say</p>
<p>the dictator</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, it&rsquo;s not like we it&rsquo;s not like we didn&rsquo;t warn you we</p>
<p>Got a 63 episodes. We called him the dictator. This was about to happen</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start the show everybody you guys were like after 20 years of friendship</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t know the list is like 9 000 items long. I was like, yeah, i&rsquo;m gonna cancel and we got a long list</p>
<p>All right, uh, so first up I think we should start with um,</p>
<p>A duo of stories that relate to each other microsoft announced. It&rsquo;s buying activision blizzard</p>
<p>For 68 billion dollars of cash microsoft&rsquo;s got a lot of cash</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and I think we all understand like why this is a great idea for microsoft with xbox and</p>
<p>Obviously activision owns call of duty which has 120 million or so monthly active users</p>
<p>They also own a bunch of nerd stuff from blizzard like diablo world of warcraft my favorite starcraft</p>
<p>And those have upwards of 40 million</p>
<p>They also had black king if you remember that they make candy crush and those kind of casual games which have a quarter billion users</p>
<p>But even with all these, uh, it&rsquo;s a highly fragmented market, but in related news</p>
<p>Alina khan the I believe 32 year old head of the ftc</p>
<p>Uh who has written a bunch of pieces we talked about this on all in episode 36</p>
<p>sat down with cara swisher and andrew ross sorkin for an interview</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>uh, basically</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re moving or she intends to move the goalposts on antitrust</p>
<p>I want to play three clips and have you each react to them. Here&rsquo;s the first one</p>
<p>and this is her take on changing the antitrust from consumer harm to</p>
<p>now shift to</p>
<p>Does this deal and we&rsquo;ll take the activision deal here as uh, but one example, but you could take the instagram and the youtube deals</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>Do these deals substantially reduce competition?</p>
<p>In the future. Let&rsquo;s watch the first clip in certain cases</p>
<p>Maybe too much success. And so the question is when is the regulator supposed to say?</p>
<p>This could work and if it works, it&rsquo;s actually worked too well</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question and I think you know for enforcers the real question is is this a deal that could lessen competition</p>
<p>And in hindsight all deals to some degree all deals to some degree</p>
<p>Substantially less than competition or tend to create a monopoly</p>
<p>Um, and there&rsquo;s also indication that congress wanted enforcers not just to act when you know</p>
<p>The third and fourth companies are merging or the first and second but actually in the incipiency when you said see trends towards</p>
<p>Concentration that those can also be important moments for enforcers to jump in</p>
<p>So, uh, what do we think?</p>
<p>Uh freeberg about this sort of new rubric</p>
<p>not consumer harm because obviously if</p>
<p>Microsoft buys activision and makes those part of game pass and you get call of duty for free with your game pass</p>
<p>And the candy crush games and blizzard games. That&rsquo;s good for consumers. They get a whole bunch of more games</p>
<p>It would be like disney buying star wars. You get all the star wars stuff in disney plus for the same low price</p>
<p>Yeah, look saxes are legal eagle here</p>
<p>But but i&rsquo;ll just say um before uh, you know, he probably speaks better informed than me</p>
<p>Um, if it&rsquo;s not about consumer harm and it&rsquo;s about decreasing competition in this broadly I would argue subjective sense</p>
<p>Then um, what&rsquo;s scary is that there are going to be decisions made by interpreters of what is and isn&rsquo;t competitive</p>
<p>And ultimately if they&rsquo;re not trying to keep in mind the best interest of the consumer</p>
<p>Then it is in fact going to cause consumer harm at some point not necessarily</p>
<p>Deals that they block but there will be deals that they may block that may have benefited consumers</p>
<p>Meaning prices go down</p>
<p>Imagine having all of your products integrated in one streaming service instead of having to pay for three streaming services</p>
<p>So instead of paying 70 across</p>
<p>HBO max and disney plus and netflix you get everything in one</p>
<p>But today the regulators would not let those businesses merge because that would be anti-competitive under this context</p>
<p>And so this is going to be a touchy debate and it&rsquo;s going to be difficult</p>
<p>I think ultimately to rationalize this if there is going to be a point</p>
<p>In the future where we can actually show that consumer harm would be caused by decreasing competition in the marketplace</p>
<p>And so I would be nervous about that subjectivity and the slippery slope it enables</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great point think about it</p>
<p>If you had to pay instead of for disney plus you paid for pixar plus disney plus marvel plus and star wars plus</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be chaos in your household to manage all those accounts. It&rsquo;s a much better offering better consumer experience</p>
<p>Yeah, much better consumer experience and and cheaper and this is why by the way, I said, sorry</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this is what I said in the past</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s we use the term monopoly as if it&rsquo;s de facto evil and bad</p>
<p>But not all monopolies or businesses that have very big moats is another way to kind of describe them</p>
<p>Are necessarily bad for the customer you get cheaper products you get better products you get more of an advantage</p>
<p>They may ultimately be yielded to be anti-competitive in a harmful way</p>
<p>Not necessarily always but let me explain to you where she&rsquo;s coming from like there&rsquo;s a fundamental pillar of capitalism that says that excess returns</p>
<p>Must get competed away. So if a capitalist system is to be efficient if a company has profit margins of 99</p>
<p>competitors emerge pushing those profit margins down to something reasonable where you get to some sort of equilibrium and</p>
<p>The whole principle of what she&rsquo;s saying is in in the absence of competition</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know what the equilibrium</p>
<p>Return really looks like and she&rsquo;s not saying that but that is the implicitness of what she&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>And so in the if you allow all of this stuff to aggregate</p>
<p>Maybe google shouldn&rsquo;t have 45% EBITDA margins maybe in a really competitive society</p>
<p>They would only have 18%</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually better net net for the system</p>
<p>The problem is that counterfactual to your point Friedberg is impossible to measure</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>And how much value do you need to take away of the panoply of things that google does?</p>
<p>To figure that out and that&rsquo;s I think where the problem with it, but you know, let&rsquo;s be clear</p>
<p>I in 2019 I wrote in my annual letter</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a section called the the tightening of the regulatory noose and meaning it was a framework for how to basically dismantle big tech</p>
<p>And element number one of that was a changing regulatory landscape</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really incredible to see it in front of our eyes. We got a bill that just left judiciary</p>
<p>right that was</p>
<p>Effectively voted across the aisle that&rsquo;s now going to go to the floor of the senate</p>
<p>Which is going to rewrite some of these anti-competitors like 75 25 and it was the 50 50 committee of democrats and republicans</p>
<p>So clearly across the aisle clearly across the aisle</p>
<p>Uh, and I mean the funny thing about that was speinstein and padilla the two democratic senators from california where most of these companies are</p>
<p>In in the wall street journal article that I read railed against it, but still voted for it to go to the floor</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s I think some version of that is going to pass. She&rsquo;s going to go and scrutinize these companies</p>
<p>I still think this microsoft activision deal on balance gets done</p>
<p>Because if you take the absolute values away from it</p>
<p>The reality is that it&rsquo;s an adjacent part of microsoft&rsquo;s core business and there&rsquo;s nothing fundamentally</p>
<p>Monopolistic about what would happen if you let microsoft and activision come together</p>
<p>Could it reduce competition in the future?</p>
<p>I think would be her new lens and if xbox has call of duty and sony playstation doesn&rsquo;t or the next console doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Maybe it does you could make the argument sax. What are your takes on this?</p>
<p>Very hard</p>
<p>To apply standard of reducing future competition because as aaron ross sarkin said very clearly</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>of these</p>
<p>Reduced competition. It&rsquo;s now we got to get into what does the word substantially mean in this context?</p>
<p>Yeah, so my take on on lena khan is that she&rsquo;s got some worthwhile observations</p>
<p>On the problems posed by these big tech monopolies, but I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s got the right remedies</p>
<p>So on the observations, I think she&rsquo;s correct broadly speaking that these big tech companies the fangs</p>
<p>They have way too much power in the marketplace</p>
<p>There are now gatekeepers over the internet that control all these powerful platforms</p>
<p>and broadly speaking</p>
<p>it is time I think to</p>
<p>to basically</p>
<p>Have some limits on those powers make sure they don&rsquo;t abuse it</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s also right that the traditional standard of consumer harm doesn&rsquo;t really capture</p>
<p>That sort of concept of market power for these free ad-based services right because there is no pricing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and furthermore</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s got a point when she says that you know</p>
<p>When you say no pricing you mean facebook and google the consumer doesn&rsquo;t pay so how can there be consumer harm, right?</p>
<p>So clearly that there&rsquo;s that standard of consumer harm doesn&rsquo;t really capture the market power dynamic</p>
<p>And then I think the last observation she makes which I think is pretty</p>
<p>Pretty valid is this idea that you know when facebook bought instagram at that time it didn&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>Be a problem, but it definitely allowed them to extend their monopoly</p>
<p>From the desktop into mobile and it probably should be scrutinized harder. My problem is with her remedies</p>
<p>I mean what she&rsquo;s basically saying</p>
<p>Is first of all, like you said any deal that could decrease competition in the future is a problem</p>
<p>Well, the whole goal of business and making business moves like an acquisition</p>
<p>Is to build your moat is to win is to win create a more competitive offering so there&rsquo;s no limiting factor</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no bright line test there at least with consumer harm. There&rsquo;s a bright line test, which is about pricing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mathematically measurable. You could create a model around it here. There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing</p>
<p>And so what it&rsquo;s going to do is completely politicize</p>
<p>The process of getting a an m&amp;a deal approved and you can see this when she&rsquo;s talking about the impact on labor</p>
<p>I mean, this is a total</p>
<p>This is a total sop to the labor</p>
<p>constituency in the democratic party because look</p>
<p>Facebook and google no matter how powerful monopolies they may be they don&rsquo;t have a dominant position in the labor market</p>
<p>This is not true</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re competing for the same engineers that every tech company is competing for so she&rsquo;s bringing a purely political consideration in now</p>
<p>And so again, there&rsquo;s no bright line rule. It&rsquo;s going to be heavily political companies trying to get a merger approval</p>
<p>Never know whether they&rsquo;re good or not and even after they get approved</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll never know they&rsquo;re good and I have a big problem with her saying that any deal</p>
<p>That they approve can be reopened and re-evaluated a decade into the future and reversed</p>
<p>The actions they&rsquo;re taking companies need certainty. That&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the real issue</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the the rules of capitalism have been that</p>
<p>the smarter slash more strategic</p>
<p>You know entity</p>
<p>If they can run their plays more efficiently has the right to win</p>
<p>Um, this is almost trying to say actually not really and that is very problematic. Yes</p>
<p>You never know you&rsquo;re good and then the problem that it&rsquo;ll create in the equity market specifically is how do you actually?</p>
<p>Drive shareholder returns and then what do all these shareholders then do?</p>
<p>If these companies are rendered to basically stay where they are</p>
<p>So you take a snapshot?</p>
<p>I mean you take a snapshot of the economy and you say this was what it will be from now on</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s sax&rsquo;s point is really interesting</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to require mna to become kind of a political maneuvering process similar, you know create sort of these</p>
<p>uh, you know, um</p>
<p>Obfuscated gates where you don&rsquo;t really know what it&rsquo;s going to take to get through there</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got to go do what you do when you try and convince foreign governments to work with you or allow you</p>
<p>To do a transaction in a foreign government in a foreign country</p>
<p>Well, you got to go in and you got to go figure out the politicians who they want who they are</p>
<p>What they want and then put together a political consortium that&rsquo;s going to approve the deal</p>
<p>Given that there&rsquo;s now going to be subjective</p>
<p>Uh, you know validation whereas before I think the the criteria were much more objective</p>
<p>Let me play this other clip. This is the clip that the sax was referencing</p>
<p>Alina khan also talks about how labor uh</p>
<p>Unions are trying to get in on the action slash griff. See on the other side</p>
<p>Some of this research has showed that labor markets are significantly concentrated</p>
<p>um, and it&rsquo;s led to you know additional thinking at the policy level of</p>
<p>How this should be affecting what anti-trust enforcers are doing. So the justice department, um, including in the last administration started looking at</p>
<p>No poach agreements, uh more closely instances in which employers may be colluding to suppress wages</p>
<p>Um, both agencies have been looking at the ways in which mergers in particular may lessen competition for labor</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And have downstream effects on workers in ways that are harmful and that also needs to be on our radar</p>
<p>so I think this is an ongoing conversation, but</p>
<p>Increasingly the question is, you know, how we implement some of these priorities and not you know, whether they&rsquo;re important</p>
<p>But this is the first time you&rsquo;ve included labor</p>
<p>this is something laborers wanted for a long time the idea of looking at antitrust through the lens of</p>
<p>Unemployment essentially</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an interesting history here</p>
<p>I mean, um, you know, there were cases in which uh, you know</p>
<p>Unions were supportive of transactions because they thought they would lead to more downstream benefits</p>
<p>But I think um, we started to see uh through retrospective studies instances in which you know</p>
<p>Mergers actually ended up having a harmful effect. And so I think that is what&rsquo;s significantly contributing to this</p>
<p>This is this is also part of what I said in 2019</p>
<p>The third element of that plan was you have to change the rules on stock-based compensation</p>
<p>So instead of her talking about it as labor</p>
<p>I think the the more accurate way to say it is like there&rsquo;s very valuable human capital in technology business a few people have</p>
<p>You know discontinuous impact on these businesses</p>
<p>And it has been a stated strategy of all of big tech to use their balance sheets to buy small companies</p>
<p>In their incipiency to use her words not because it helps advantage their monopoly</p>
<p>But it prevents the leakage of human capital</p>
<p>Into other ideas and it prevents those other ideas from really flourishing</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s been happening for years in silicon valley, and we all know that</p>
<p>You know, all the aqua hiring we see is about hoarding talent</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d rather pay these people millions of dollars a year if you&rsquo;re big tech</p>
<p>To basically work on next to nothing</p>
<p>Then take the risk of them going across the street to a competitor and then having them</p>
<p>Do something that disrupts you and this was such a this is such a no the only way</p>
<p>But the sorry just to finish the old one of the ways that you can change it is you have to change</p>
<p>The way that stock-based compensation works how it&rsquo;s accounted for</p>
<p>you know how you can actually deal with it on a gap basis how</p>
<p>Capitalists then treat that in terms of their earnings if you don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>None of the models change people look past it people look through it</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a real cost which it is</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re allowed to continue to do it. That&rsquo;s really the underlying issue</p>
<p>So much so chamath that the human the hoarding of human capital was a reoccurring theme on the silicon valley hbo show</p>
<p>Where people in hooli were getting paid millions of dollars and hanging out on the roof</p>
<p>Uh freeberg when you look at this</p>
<p>Uh human capital labor being brought into it. Isn&rsquo;t the point of a lot of mna?</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>Um eliminate jobs and eliminate redundancy. So if you brought in youtube at google</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not sure if you were there at that time period the distinct concept was hey</p>
<p>We already have an advanced ad network. We already have accounting and we already have servers around the world and storage</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to hire those people. We can get rid of them or whatever</p>
<p>And we get rid of that redundancy</p>
<p>Large-scale consolidation. That&rsquo;s certainly true</p>
<p>Most mna and technology is the opposite where an acquisition takes place and the acquisition</p>
<p>Gets fueled by further investment after the acquisition is made when youtube was acquired</p>
<p>There was a few dozen employees there and then very quickly google scaled that team the engineering team the infrastructure team</p>
<p>They even had their own independent ad sales team</p>
<p>um to thousands of employees</p>
<p>And without that it would have been very difficult for youtube to achieve that scale both from a product success perspective an infrastructure perspective</p>
<p>But also an employee-based perspective with the amount of capital</p>
<p>It would have taken to go and raise that from venture capitalists</p>
<p>Maybe nowadays where there&rsquo;s billions of dollars floating around it would be different</p>
<p>But back then it would have been very hard. And so what&rsquo;s the same for uh, whatsapp and instagram?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly whatsapp was 19 people when it was acquired and now it&rsquo;s thousands i&rsquo;m certain and instagram&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;ve seen traditionally or not traditionally but over the last 10-15 years with internet-based acquisitions</p>
<p>Is not about consolidation and reduction in costs</p>
<p>But about taking and enabling technology and accelerating it on an existing platform</p>
<p>Now number one it makes that new technology or product far more successful far more far-reaching and more consumers benefit from it</p>
<p>Number two is it now makes that platform harder to compete with so as a platform</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a lot harder to catch up with the cash flows being generated at google and at facebook</p>
<p>Given how quickly they reinvest that capital in new technology to further their advancement</p>
<p>To your point, yeah, but I would say</p>
<p>What what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been so significant over the past 15 years that people are lifting their head up</p>
<p>Is that it has been both beneficial to consumers?</p>
<p>And anti-competitive so that was exactly what I was going to get to here</p>
<p>Your youtube example is the perfect one because if you look at youtube think about all the joy education</p>
<p>Communication it has created on a global basis as a juggernaut free and it&rsquo;s free</p>
<p>That has helped humanity so much in this new lens</p>
<p>But no one else can make a video ad site like</p>
<p>Exactly. So we&rsquo;re now looking at all the benefit that youtube has created for humanity</p>
<p>Versus the fact that it&rsquo;s going to be impossible to displace youtube now to your point sax</p>
<p>How do you get past the bright line? Do you have a suggestion?</p>
<p>for a way and would you now look at something like youtube and say we shouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>Allowed that to happen youtube was on debt store because of the lawsuits and the server bills. We all know that</p>
<p>Right. Well, this is the uncertainty that&rsquo;s going to be created and</p>
<p>I think this administration&rsquo;s creating tremendous business uncertainty</p>
<p>I think the reaction of a lot of big tech companies is this is going to be to stop</p>
<p>Doing m&amp;a until the situation gets clarified because they just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>Um, you know targets are target companies are going to want to have huge breakup fees</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just going to have a chilling effect on the market for m&amp;a</p>
<p>I mean business needs certainty and they&rsquo;re not giving it in this business environment</p>
<p>Um trim up before we get to you just let me kind of make one point about that last clip</p>
<p>on on the labor point</p>
<p>Listen, this feels to me just like when the administration</p>
<p>uh talked about clean tech and clean energy and electric vehicles, but then they only gave the subsidy to the</p>
<p>car companies</p>
<p>That were uh that were basically union shops and so give tesla the same. That&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>They excluded tesla. They excluded tesla from the ev center</p>
<p>They tried to pretend that ford and gm were the ones driving the ev revolution in the u.s</p>
<p>It was laughable what they were trying to do. There is there a shoehorning a union agenda</p>
<p>Into clean tech and I think that&rsquo;s what lena horn was doing in that clip</p>
<p>she was shoehorning a union agenda into antitrust law and it&rsquo;s a bit absurd because</p>
<p>Facebook and google even though they are very powerful companies when it comes to talent</p>
<p>They are in a war for talent just like everybody else. They compete</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a union issue there. These are not factory. These are not mistreated employees</p>
<p>These are very well-paid employees and moreover</p>
<p>The market is highly competitive and we don&rsquo;t need them trying to insert this union agenda into antitrust law</p>
<p>You got to think that for example going back to microsoft activision</p>
<p>obviously the bankers</p>
<p>Would have called apple and facebook and google as well. I mean, it&rsquo;s absurd that they wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>Yeah, it has to be the minute that you think you have a bona fide offer</p>
<p>One of the things you have to do is essentially, you know</p>
<p>Get an opinion letter and also to make sure that as a public market shareholder</p>
<p>You can justify that you&rsquo;ve evaluated all the other options, right? Sure</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really quite telling to david&rsquo;s point. I don&rsquo;t think that if you were facebook or google or apple</p>
<p>You could have credibly made an offer because the calculus in the back of your head was not whether it had business logic</p>
<p>But whether you could actually get it through the fdc</p>
<p>But microsoft did because microsoft is no longer seen as a threat and look we said this we said this in our awards show</p>
<p>Two or three episodes ago, you know, they have really been the most untouched</p>
<p>Uh in the last decade by antitrust scrutiny whether it domestically or internationally</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve largely skated under the radar after</p>
<p>Paying the price for an entire decade</p>
<p>I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that microsoft&rsquo;s effectively pivoted with the exception of this gaming into being an</p>
<p>enterprise software company and</p>
<p>The politicians just care a lot less about enterprise software. It doesn&rsquo;t capture the public&rsquo;s imagination. It&rsquo;s the big consumer</p>
<p>You know companies that get all of that attention fascinating point</p>
<p>like literally the consumer and the bread and circuses of this is what&rsquo;s driving it like</p>
<p>People hate big tech and trump got banned from it. Yada. Yada</p>
<p>But I gotta say, you know these um increasing restrictions on big tech and the these</p>
<p>Prohibitions and the chilling effect the uncertainty</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to do it when the market is just completely ripping and we can sort of afford</p>
<p>To run these experiments and tinker with these these rules, but I gotta say i&rsquo;m starting to get pretty worried here</p>
<p>That you know, we had jeremy grantham is sort of a old school. Yeah old school kind of bearish type market commentator</p>
<p>He had this expression that the yeah, I mean it&rsquo;s more one of these stop clock right twice a day things</p>
<p>Jeremy grantham has never found a market. He didn&rsquo;t yeah. Yeah, exactly</p>
<p>but but but a stop clock can be right twice a day and</p>
<p>The the line he had today is we&rsquo;re seeing the popping of a super bubble</p>
<p>And you know, we&rsquo;ve been talking about bubble. Yeah, exactly. Basically, that&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s not true. But I mean, it&rsquo;s good. Yes</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s evocative. Well the the sense in which it might be true is that I mean we&rsquo;ve talked about this last few months</p>
<p>Is that you had the fed and the the the federal government?</p>
<p>Pump a 10 trillion of liquidity into the market over the past two years because of covet now</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re starting to pull that back</p>
<p>And there was I think a general asset inflation across asset classes certain types of assets</p>
<p>Clearly got more inflated than others. We&rsquo;ve seen a huge correction in growth stocks. We&rsquo;ve seen a huge correction</p>
<p>in uh in crypto</p>
<p>Basically anything long dated as the fear of interest rates increasing has gone up. They&rsquo;ve massively corrected</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>so the concern is that</p>
<p>You know with the losses we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>And I mean every day it just keeps like you&rsquo;ve seen more red that this could turn into a recession</p>
<p>you know popping of bubbles is usually followed by</p>
<p>Uh by recessions or so. I think you know the fortunes of the economy could turn really quickly here</p>
<p>And that is that is the marginal risk the marginal risk is actually for a recession</p>
<p>We we talked about this before by the way, just to your point</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that we pumped in 10 trillion dollars</p>
<p>But over the last three weeks and really over the last two and a half months we have actually eviscerated</p>
<p>10 trillion dollars of value as well. So if you want to measure it</p>
<p>We put 10 trillion of excess capital in but we&rsquo;ve now destroyed 10 trillion dollars of equity</p>
<p>Destroyed it by lowering the prices or repricing stuff</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve repriced everything crypto. I mean crypto in the last couple of days has just been</p>
<p>Schlocked</p>
<p>Yeah, uh growth stocks have been shellacked. Um, biotech stocks have been just absolutely spoken. Everything is getting crushed</p>
<p>COVID stocks, but david is saying something really important the risk in my opinion is not</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>Runaway inflation anymore. And the reason was what happened this weekend was incredibly important</p>
<p>And we have seen this happen just a few years ago so this weekend</p>
<p>uh, china cut interest rates now</p>
<p>As we know we are dealing in the united states with this issue of whether we should raise rates</p>
<p>And by how much because we&rsquo;re worried about inflation while if you&rsquo;re cutting rates</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re worried about the other problem, which is that the economy is basically turned over and you need to become more accommodating</p>
<p>Right. You need to incentivize businesses to spend by turned over you mean</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s slowed down</p>
<p>People are not building companies not doing new projects</p>
<p>So you want to insight you want to give them an incentive or maybe?</p>
<p>Some catalyst to start some new company or start some new project because all the real estate projects have wound down in 2018</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s exactly what happened the setup was</p>
<p>The fed we were everybody was worried about what the fed was going to do on interest rates</p>
<p>The fed was looking at china as the canary in the coal mine the leading indicator of what we should do</p>
<p>And at the end of 2018</p>
<p>Uh, jerome powell decided to raise rates</p>
<p>And we raised rates</p>
<p>And then enter 2019</p>
<p>and uh, the chinese economy turned over and uh</p>
<p>We realized that their economy was not nearly as strong as we thought it would be</p>
<p>And so our reaction was disproportionate to what the actual data on the ground said we entered a recession in 2019</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you guys probably saw</p>
<p>Trump going crazy blaming powell. I mean most of us ignored it because you know, we were all dealing with you know</p>
<p>Trump derangement syndrome, but the underlying thing of what he was saying was hey, hold on a second</p>
<p>Uh, you just caused a recession in america by raising too quickly</p>
<p>The fed is now in this really delicate situation where china cut rates last week</p>
<p>We have an fomc meeting the open markets committee that sets rates on wednesday. I think of this coming week</p>
<p>What is he supposed to do?</p>
<p>You know bill ackman two weeks ago. It was advocating for a 50 basis point raise in this meeting</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s way beyond what people even thought is supposed to happen</p>
<p>We should just remember that bill ackman has bets macroeconomic bets in the market if he&rsquo;s calling for a 50 point raise</p>
<p>I guarantee you you&rsquo;re gonna make a lot of money. You&rsquo;ll make a lot of money. No conflict. No interest. Yeah</p>
<p>My only point is the setup is a very complicated one for the fed coming into this week and</p>
<p>The risk is to a recession because if we over correct</p>
<p>Yes, and the leading indicators all around the world tell us that their economies are weak</p>
<p>Then inflation may have actually been much more transitory than we thought and right now we have to decide</p>
<p>Because if we over correct we&rsquo;re going to plunge the united states economy into a recession</p>
<p>This is why uh</p>
<p>I think friedberg when you look at this when you have so many different things happening at once and you&rsquo;re trying to pilot a plane</p>
<p>Or a car, you know in rain on ice going really fast</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something wrong with the brakes and you got to be very delicate</p>
<p>With you know how you steer into this what is the right strategy here on a policy basis?</p>
<p>coming out of omicron</p>
<p>Um, should we just take a pause on raising rates?</p>
<p>What do you think the right situation here obviously putting a bunch of regulation on top of big, you know mergers and acquisitions and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to create headwinds</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many different variables we want to add to the mix of an economy that feels like we&rsquo;re in a perfect storm</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Look a lot of us kind of talk about</p>
<p>The valuation of things in markets as being the economy, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>The economy is the productivity of businesses that are valued in the market</p>
<p>And as long as the productivity of the businesses in the market continues to improve that businesses continue to grow that</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stability to pricing that&rsquo;s not run away or or declining</p>
<p>and either inflationary or too deflationary</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>You know, I think those are the indicators that matter most now the reality is over the last couple of years</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had trillions of dollars that have flowed into these markets for free</p>
<p>And those trillions of dollars have created lots of mini asset bubbles</p>
<p>Lots of little new markets have emerged nfts</p>
<p>Random cryptocurrencies that don&rsquo;t actually do anything the collectibles market the art market. There are lots of</p>
<p>I mean there are and lots of examples of these speculative early stage businesses that have gone public</p>
<p>And uh people back them and they they said look when there&rsquo;s this much money around i&rsquo;m going to start making more risky bets</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to make more speculative bets</p>
<p>And uh regardless the money&rsquo;s coming out of the markets</p>
<p>The money&rsquo;s going to come out one way or another and as it starts to come out</p>
<p>These little bubbles are the first that are going to pop and that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the economy is at risk</p>
<p>It means that there are valuation bubbles that are going to burst they&rsquo;re going to decline</p>
<p>And no interest rate policy is going to change that because the inevitable</p>
<p>Growth in the underlying economy the inevitable end to the pandemic</p>
<p>Is what&rsquo;s ultimately going to drive capital out of these markets?</p>
<p>And back into ultimately more productive assets and less speculative assets</p>
<p>And so this is a transition that i&rsquo;m not sure you can really kind of manage</p>
<p>I think underlying businesses and the growth of the economy and the ability for people to get jobs</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible number of open jobs are in the u.s</p>
<p>Right now three million open job listings go apply for a job million eleven million, whatever it is</p>
<p>Go go go sign up for a new job three point. What is it sax three million three point seven percent unemployment?</p>
<p>There are not a lot of people</p>
<p>Yeah, there are not a lot of people in the u.s</p>
<p>That don&rsquo;t have an option to go out right now and go improve their their working condition</p>
<p>There are a lot of open jobs in the u.s</p>
<p>And salaries have gone up. That&rsquo;s what I mean. You&rsquo;re working condition. You can go make more money and um,</p>
<p>And so, you know the economy underlying there are lots of great businesses that are growing and doing well and there&rsquo;s stability that&rsquo;s emerging</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a bunch that aren&rsquo;t and there are a bunch that were always speculative and that they were hyped and overvalued</p>
<p>And you know as those assets get devalued a lot of us that have most of our</p>
<p>Worth and income coming from capital are uh are gonna feel the burn</p>
<p>I have two questions by the way that we I want to go around the horn on</p>
<p>Uh first jamal if we could do if each of you could do one thing</p>
<p>To one or two things</p>
<p>Uh to manage this economic policy in the next year</p>
<p>What would it be like?</p>
<p>What two things do you think we should do david one or two things be the top of the list?</p>
<p>That regulators should do in terms of managing this</p>
<p>seemingly chaotic situation</p>
<p>Just feel not to it just feels to me like we&rsquo;re pinballing from one overreaction to another</p>
<p>So we overreacted in terms of flooding the zone with liquidity because of covid</p>
<p>I mean remember like druckenmiller</p>
<p>He was like the one of the only voices about a year ago when they did that to that last two trillion dollar</p>
<p>Stimulus bill the covid relief bill. Yep</p>
<p>And he said look retail is already 15 percent above trend meaning if you looked at demand the demand side of the economy</p>
<p>It had fully recovered and was actually above trend people were spending</p>
<p>More money and then we flood the zone with another two trillion and then lo and behold six months later</p>
<p>We have this inflation and then in response to that inflation. We&rsquo;re now jacking up rates</p>
<p>So quickly that I think we&rsquo;re risking such a mass point or recession</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re pinballing from one overreaction to another and I just the big meta thought I had this week was just how many of our problems</p>
<p>Are just self-inflicted right now. I mean even on covid right?</p>
<p>We could live with this variant of covid omicron</p>
<p>You know chamath and all of our friends. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>Everyone I know in the last few weeks basically has had it and it&rsquo;s been very mild</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically been a cold but in large swaths of the country. We&rsquo;re not choosing to live with it</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at each other&rsquo;s throats about these vaccine mandates these other restrictions and okay</p>
<p>And similarly and and the same thing just to make even more local</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a crime wave in america going on right now. Why because we emptied the jails last year</p>
<p>And stopped prosecuting totally self-inflicted. Okay. So what things do we need to do?</p>
<p>Just if you had one or two things that you think we should do one</p>
<p>You said we&rsquo;re ping-ponging. So you think more consistent policy communicating?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I think that you want some neat little answer that&rsquo;s tweetable and there is none. No, it&rsquo;s I wanted you</p>
<p>I mean, let me explain that was a good idea</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one or two things anybody can do</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a collective set of things that we have to do in an organized way</p>
<p>So look just to set up, right?</p>
<p>We have had more</p>
<p>Activity and hedging</p>
<p>Than in any other period in recent memory</p>
<p>Except the great financial crisis just to set the tone of where we are in terms of volatility in the capital markets</p>
<p>Mutual funds who don&rsquo;t short stocks, right? The multi-trillion dollar mutual fund complex whose only job is to buy</p>
<p>Has been a net seller</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t even started buying a single thing yet</p>
<p>We have an fomc meeting</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to happen next week</p>
<p>Where jerome powell and the you know, the fed has to decide what to do in the face of incomplete data</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if we&rsquo;ve even stopped all of the purchasing</p>
<p>Uh of assets that we&rsquo;ve been doing. We&rsquo;re still putting money into system</p>
<p>I just want to be clear. We were debating when we stopped the spigot</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even debating when we shrink our balance sheet as a country. So</p>
<p>We are in a really complicated moment. And I think the risk is</p>
<p>that there is</p>
<p>An overreaction to incomplete data and we plunge the u.s. Economy into a recession</p>
<p>And I just think that that that has to be really thoughtfully measured and we guys we&rsquo;ve seen this in 2019 2018 19</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid break any thoughts. Uh, no, i&rsquo;m not an economist and i&rsquo;m not a central banker. And so I have no clue</p>
<p>okay, um</p>
<p>the next thing</p>
<p>But to my point, I mean we are dealing with balancing the risks of inflation against the risk of recession</p>
<p>I think that is fundamental and right now</p>
<p>All the statements have been so hawkish</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>you know the markets have been</p>
<p>just flowing red now for months and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting. I think I think the the balance of risk is</p>
<p>starting to make recession possible in a way that</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t seem possible two three months. Doesn&rsquo;t the repricing of assets though? Like we look at peloton, you know, it&rsquo;s down</p>
<p>Whatever 80 you look at zoom is down 70 80 percent when you see those things that were obviously mispriced</p>
<p>Uh rivian, uh, which we talked about. I wouldn&rsquo;t use the term mispriced</p>
<p>They were priced. I would say they&rsquo;re repriced. They&rsquo;re repriced. They were mispriced. They&rsquo;re not repriced</p>
<p>Someone paid something someone someone sold them for something. They were they were priced</p>
<p>Yesterday they paid 25 percent more and then today they&rsquo;re paying 25 percent less</p>
<p>What difference does it make whether it&rsquo;s yesterday an hour ago or a year ago?</p>
<p>Priced every day pricing changes. Well, no, here&rsquo;s the thing about the pricing</p>
<p>The pricing was based on people with a lot of money placing a lot of bets</p>
<p>Uh, maybe who are new retail? Okay, fine. What&rsquo;s the point? The market condition changed</p>
<p>Well, I think maybe we had enthusiastic people</p>
<p>Betting things up without looking at fundamentals is my point. I think sax agrees with me here on this</p>
<p>So I think I think you&rsquo;re right about that. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, so now you have market participants who were gambling on like momentum now</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re repricing stuff. Do we think where are we at in this repricing or correct pricing assets?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the eighth in my opinion. I think we&rsquo;re in the eighth inning of of the tech drawdown</p>
<p>So got it</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a high growth tech company, you&rsquo;ve been smashed for three months in a row as you said jason</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re off some stocks are off 80</p>
<p>You know 50 to 80 percent of their highs. That&rsquo;s like dot-com era corrections. It really is that&rsquo;s crashed</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dot-com era crash</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re uh</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in other areas like value, you&rsquo;ve had a pretty good rally if you&rsquo;re in crypto</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just starting to get smoked now</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in um</p>
<p>Why is it crypto? This is I want your thoughts on this trim up</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t crypto getting smoked like peloton and zoom is because those people are hodlers or something</p>
<p>Well crypto I think has slightly different dynamics than than individual stocks like a peloton</p>
<p>But I think that you&rsquo;re gonna see no earnings release for one, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re gonna because like you have to understand what all the all the market is is who&rsquo;s bidding and who&rsquo;s coming into the market</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s still thousands of millions of people from around the world stepping into the crypto markets each day</p>
<p>That are putting more money into these markets and that balances out the withdrawals and that&rsquo;s all that crypto is there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>Underlying business that you&rsquo;re valuing the peloton release was really bad. Okay. I mean it was very strange. Yeah</p>
<p>Well, I think it was strange. It was just like uh, we&rsquo;re just gonna basically stop producing anything</p>
<p>Because all of our inventory will meet our demand for the foreseeable future. That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good statement if you&rsquo;re supposed to be a high growth</p>
<p>Okay, so if we&rsquo;re seeing 50 to 80 percent</p>
<p>Sachs gavin baker had a tweet that&rsquo;s capital allocator. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah the bottom of the market</p>
<p>He and it was a phrase something like when we shoot the generals and his comment was the generals are big tech</p>
<p>When those things trade down 25 the bottom is in and I think that collectively most people think that</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a little bit oversold</p>
<p>In all areas except big tech. I think big tech is down 10 11 12</p>
<p>Percent when you see this thing really get cracked is when those folks, you know</p>
<p>Trade down another 10 or 15 and then I think we&rsquo;re kind of through most of the pain</p>
<p>So peloton and zoom were kind of mid-tech. I don&rsquo;t know what we call those but I would call them like mid-tech</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re obviously not big tech, but they&rsquo;re not small either mid-tech gets their asses kick 50 to 80 percent big tech 15</p>
<p>But if big tech goes down 30 then we start really seeing a bottom and we consider netflix part of that</p>
<p>Because I think big tech you have to remember is basically the index and in the last</p>
<p>10 or 20 years you&rsquo;ve never seen drawdowns more than 15 to 25</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never seen it and in when you&rsquo;ve ever had a 15 to 25 percent drawdown meaning the market goes off 15 or 25</p>
<p>You have to remember the thing that we have also done over the last 20 years has created so much money on the sidelines</p>
<p>always looking</p>
<p>For a cheap buying opportunity and so the minute that these things so even you know in march of 2020</p>
<p>Remember when we started to do this pod and it literally looked like the world was ending</p>
<p>Yeah, the bottom existed for a week</p>
<p>Yep</p>
<p>And then within a week the entire 25</p>
<p>Loss in the stock market was wiped out and we were back to normal. So that&rsquo;s when I sold</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take our advice</p>
<p>Okay. Well, let&rsquo;s talk specifically about nef. I think it was good that we talked about panicked at the lows</p>
<p>Oh my god, I did too. I remember selling I remember selling slack going</p>
<p>This is the dumbest thing but I have no choice because I was how about literally going to 15</p>
<p>How about when uber goes to 15 from 45?</p>
<p>I was ready to basically curled up in a ball and said i&rsquo;m not selling but i&rsquo;m not feeling good, right?</p>
<p>By the way, this is why I was saying jason like any comment you made earlier. I think you made a comment about um,</p>
<p>You know, what do you do right now to drive or make change in these markets?</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>That at the end of the day</p>
<p>The drive or the change is being made as much as the change that&rsquo;s being made is being driven by the market itself</p>
<p>There is just so many dynamics at play that it&rsquo;s very difficult to kind of ascertain where things are headed next what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all going to sit here and we&rsquo;re all going to speculate</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to flip a coin. It&rsquo;s going to come up heads. It&rsquo;s going to come up tails. We&rsquo;re going to be right</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be wrong</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really difficult to kind of put put our foot down and for any of us to put our foot down and say this is</p>
<p>What I think needs to happen and this is what I think should happen or could happen or will happen</p>
<p>Half of us will be right half of us will be wrong. But man, let&rsquo;s take another stock</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting to talk about this netflix was at 700. Uh, just a couple of months ago. It&rsquo;s at 390 today</p>
<p>Um, this is an incredible large business. Yeah, that&rsquo;s like a real business that you can assess what&rsquo;s going on in the business itself</p>
<p>Well, they think they&rsquo;re not going to grow</p>
<p>Uh, 20 30 percent a year. They think I grow eight nine ten percent a year, but a fabulous business, right? Like, uh, great business</p>
<p>Incredible. So is that now the time so is this growing so much? I mean time netflix is so saturated</p>
<p>It is it has achieved such incredible market share by growing so quickly every year for years and years and end</p>
<p>At some point the growth was going to slow down. They hit their natural audience. I think</p>
<p>I think netflix is going to be the best example</p>
<p>of consumer surplus at scale and what I mean by that is</p>
<p>They have given so much value</p>
<p>Away for an incredibly small amount of money</p>
<p>Like if you think about the value you get from netflix as compared to what you would get from comcast</p>
<p>And you spend ten bucks a month ten dollars or fifteen dollars for netflix versus a hundred bucks for comcast</p>
<p>There was such a huge gap in value</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But netflix had to spend so much money to keep people entertained. The real question is</p>
<p>At what point do they start to sort of like run out of the things that they can do to keep people?</p>
<p>Engaged and otherwise they jason do what you did, which is you have a subscription to hbo max</p>
<p>You have a subscription to disney plus yeah</p>
<p>I mean the headwinds are the competition everybody gets in the game. The only real winner is the consumer. Yeah</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>And any individual company I think gets gets into a real tough spot</p>
<p>And I think what you saw was their earnings release basically said just that disney&rsquo;s doing a great job competing against us</p>
<p>Hbo max is doing a great job competing against us</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not sure</p>
<p>With the incremental dollar that we can give you the growth that we&rsquo;ve given you before when we had no competition</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s by the way</p>
<p>Lena&rsquo;s lena khan&rsquo;s comment, which is the other side of the coin</p>
<p>Which is when you have more competition the consumer does when it contains prices</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t contain asset inflation, which does impact the shareholders of these companies</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, and still even at this level 172 billion dollars. They have a 35</p>
<p>xp</p>
<p>I mean one way that to look at this here</p>
<p>I think your point is an interesting one chamath where you talk about how much value they&rsquo;ve given away over the years and what</p>
<p>They have today</p>
<p>You can always look at the balance sheet of a business a public company</p>
<p>And in the balance sheet, there&rsquo;s this um</p>
<p>this line goodwill, um, no, well not even goodwill just the um, uh, the accumulated loss, um,</p>
<p>The accumulated deficit and if you look at that, um on netflix, they basically run the business right now</p>
<p>As of their last earning statement, which was december 31st negative 40 million dollars</p>
<p>So in terms of the total net cash that they&rsquo;ve generated as a business since their founding as a business</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve lost 40 million dollars. So, you know, and meanwhile the question is okay. What&rsquo;s the you know, so they&rsquo;re not necessarily</p>
<p>Uh at a stage where they&rsquo;ve been generating cash</p>
<p>But for many many years amazon had a similar strategy where they were reinvesting all their capital</p>
<p>And that capital was going into building the business and growing the platform and adding the next layer of growth</p>
<p>The question is has netflix from a fundamental business perspective not a valuation perspective</p>
<p>Have they added enough growth platforms into the business?</p>
<p>Have they found enough other products services or ways to build</p>
<p>Linear video they don&rsquo;t have gaming. They don&rsquo;t have anything else. They did start doing sports. They don&rsquo;t have comedy</p>
<p>Really? They they they are dabbling. They dabbled with doing a couple of podcasts</p>
<p>They dabble with doing a couple of games and there&rsquo;s rumors that they might try to get the other 20 or 30</p>
<p>Percent of people who don&rsquo;t pay by creating a lighter version that was ad supported in other words</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get the new season of ozark, but maybe you can get the first two or three</p>
<p>Uh, you&rsquo;re a year behind the production schedule, but you can watch it all with ads</p>
<p>So why isn&rsquo;t netflix in video games and sports?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an obvious one and that&rsquo;s why I think they released a series of games based on their ip</p>
<p>So as their ip grows and I think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll see with disney pluses</p>
<p>Think about an app store inside of disney plus a merch store inside of disney plus I think there&rsquo;s so many verticals next to them</p>
<p>Why is there no merch store inside? Why don&rsquo;t they own spotify or have a spotify competitor?</p>
<p>Well, I think spotify sees themselves as a that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a really good point, you know</p>
<p>When you look at the peloton, I was looking at the peloton. Um</p>
<p>Earnings when you know this it was down 25 yesterday or the day before</p>
<p>And I was like this is an incredible business because they have 2.1 million subscribers that pay 40 bucks a month</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible. I mean, it&rsquo;s a money printing machine money printing machine. I actually have a subscription</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even have a peloton peloton. I don&rsquo;t have you just pay 500 a year to use the classes. I have the app</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy. I don&rsquo;t even use the app, but I think that&rsquo;s 20 bucks for the just an app</p>
<p>Yeah, but the point I was trying to make is when you look at it</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s about 30 percent of that revenue that goes right back to the music labels for the music</p>
<p>So, you know to your point like, uh, there&rsquo;s just an enormous value in actually</p>
<p>Music, you know, so as netflix built library values and content they could be they could point it to music as well</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these things they could do to reignite growth</p>
<p>A lot of people discount the value of having a subscription consumer business when you have a consumer&rsquo;s credit card on file</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re paying every month for something</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible point because you don&rsquo;t have the friction of getting the sale done. You&rsquo;ve already done the sale</p>
<p>Yep</p>
<p>Now the question is can you upsell them some new service or some new addition that they&rsquo;re not paying for today?</p>
<p>So obvious. Yeah, it&rsquo;s so obvious, right?</p>
<p>and so like by the way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this like for years google struggled with this question, which is what is google&rsquo;s consumer subscription business because google did not have</p>
<p>Consumer credit cards across its platform despite a billion daily users</p>
<p>And so google for years was strategically trying to figure out what business can or should we be in?</p>
<p>To have a subscription model with consumers because once you have that</p>
<p>Then you can charge for all sorts of stuff. You can charge for storing photos</p>
<p>You can charge for accessing audio. You can charge for accessing unlimited</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;ll be the i&rsquo;ll take the contrarian side of this. Okay, here we go. Yeah, go ahead peter</p>
<p>Well, no, look I I invest in b2b subscription businesses</p>
<p>I hate b2c subscription businesses and the reason is just the churn rates what we see when we look at</p>
<p>b2c subscription businesses is five percent monthly churn is not uncommon. It&rsquo;s pretty much the standard so</p>
<p>Call that 50 60 churn in the subscription base every year</p>
<p>So effectively you&rsquo;re rebuilding the company from scratch every two years. I don&rsquo;t see like how you can build a successful business</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why you&rsquo;re wrong about this</p>
<p>But when you contrast that to b2b with b2b subscription businesses</p>
<p>You do lose some customers, but the ones who stick with you keep adding seats for more employees usually</p>
<p>And so actually it expands your land and expands your courts are actually</p>
<p>Your cohorts are growing 20 every year instead of shrinking 50</p>
<p>Now obviously there are some of these b2c subscription businesses like netflix and peloton. They are obviously valuable. They&rsquo;ve defied gravity</p>
<p>Well netflix has done it because they spend billions of dollars on content and peloton&rsquo;s got it because they</p>
<p>Plop a expensive machine in your house</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t forget about it and that keeps you a little bit more recurring</p>
<p>Than like a lot of these subscriptions which are just very easy to cancel</p>
<p>But so look they&rsquo;ve been able to make it work, but i&rsquo;m most here&rsquo;s why I think you&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>It turns out these are so low priced these subscriptions that you get a lot of consumers</p>
<p>Trialing them. So because it&rsquo;s only five or ten bucks a month to use something like a spotify or a disney</p>
<p>um because they&rsquo;re so low price you do get a little bit of</p>
<p>Sampling and that&rsquo;s why the rate&rsquo;s higher whereas in business</p>
<p>There is a massive onboarding of people have to take their time to set up the software learn how to use it</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to commit to it, it does reduce it and you do have land and expand</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re talking about with product expansion is the equivalent in sass of land and expand</p>
<p>So imagine if disney plus or spotify</p>
<p>After you listen to an album or it&rsquo;s in your top rotation</p>
<p>They showed you the merch for that band or after you completed the season of mandalorian or book of boba fett</p>
<p>They showed you the merchandise and said here&rsquo;s a limited edition of</p>
<p>Um grogu baby yoda when we tried to get baby yoda stuff last christmas</p>
<p>Disney dropped the ball. They didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>Uh, and they could have had all that made and they would have sold millions of we were buying stuff on etsy</p>
<p>The reason baby yoda works is because it&rsquo;s leveraged off a platform</p>
<p>This massive disney platform of which this b2c subscription service is just one piece. I mean look obviously there are</p>
<p>valuable consumer subscription businesses, so</p>
<p>The way i&rsquo;m approaching it can&rsquo;t be right in all cases</p>
<p>However, I think people really get themselves in trouble when they start to value</p>
<p>These b2c subscription businesses the same as the b2b ones in one case</p>
<p>You in the b2c case</p>
<p>churn is the predominant characteristic and it means that you&rsquo;re gonna have to spend more</p>
<p>On marketing or cogs or content or what have you to keep rebuilding the user base</p>
<p>Whereas in the b2b context the user base is compounding on its own</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll that just makes for I think a more finally attractive business opportunity. Yes, but it grows slower again just</p>
<p>At the end of the day, these are all variables just the weights just changed. I agree with david that consumer</p>
<p>Churn businesses or consumer businesses have much higher churn</p>
<p>Than enterprise and enterprises have negative churn, which means that they just naturally grow</p>
<p>But the reality is consumers just have an unbounded tam that enterprises do not</p>
<p>And the way that the way that the ltvs work, uh</p>
<p>Just tend to be different and the cash flow cycle of these companies tend to be very different</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you see netflix get these enormous valuations that enterprise subscription businesses do not</p>
<p>What some people are now doing when they look at consumer consumer businesses</p>
<p>They look at churn is they take out the ones that are based on credit card</p>
<p>To look at like people who actually unsubscribe because they don&rsquo;t want it but not because their credit card</p>
<p>So basically so if you think about like netflix&rsquo;s business if it&rsquo;s churning two and a half percent per month</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call that 30 of the user base is a trading every year</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to rebuild their user base from scratch every three or four years now</p>
<p>They can do that. Um, I guess at some point though, they may run out of</p>
<p>You know greenfield opportunity to grow their customer base</p>
<p>um, but you know, it&rsquo;s going to pressurize their margins because they&rsquo;re going to have to constantly</p>
<p>Spend on content original content to retain you you have to spend on marketing to keep going after the portion</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re leaving out the archive. These archives are going to be super valuable and I don&rsquo;t think we even know how to value</p>
<p>These archives yet because if you look at the marvel archive or the star wars archive</p>
<p>These things just keep printing money year after year and then you&rsquo;ll see netflix and hbo max</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll keep being able to go back to them hbo max being the canonical example now because</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t think that that business would have</p>
<p>You know a lot of ip to build on but suddenly you have the many saints of newark</p>
<p>Um, and the uh, sex in the city reboot. I mean they&rsquo;re going right down the line</p>
<p>When you own the franchise it has value disney has shown that you own the best franchise</p>
<p>Hbo max is now showing it and then that means netflix will show it next but how much of netflix&rsquo;s content do they even own?</p>
<p>Are they licensed? No now it&rsquo;s 100</p>
<p>Netflix is 100 they stopped and that&rsquo;s why disney started taking it off</p>
<p>Their whole spend that I think they&rsquo;re spending 20 billion or something. It&rsquo;s all on original content</p>
<p>So that that&rsquo;s why they made that move is because they knew they were going to have the disney content the marvel content pulled</p>
<p>Where do we want to go next guys? Because I have covid</p>
<p>Uh, I want to I want I want sax to to talk to me about his</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with fauci?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, this is quite a story. This really is. Um, i&rsquo;m trying to get my head around the story</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;d be totally honest, can you slow it down and explain it to us? Because I think we all please my head is</p>
<p>Okay, so um a series of emails have come out that were requested of the freedom of information act and what they show</p>
<p>Is that at the nih?</p>
<p>Fauci and francis collins who was the head of it. They had a series of conversations with scientists</p>
<p>Around uh, january. Sorry january 31st or february 1st. There are emails</p>
<p>On february 1st summarizing those conversations and basically what they say is that a</p>
<p>group of scientists advised</p>
<p>Fauci and collins that covid likely came from a lab how they know because it had you know</p>
<p>Hallmark signatures like the furan sites the same reasons we now believe</p>
<p>Uh, the the virus came from a lab, okay</p>
<p>But by february 4th officials at so three days later officials at the nih including fauci</p>
<p>Had come to the conclusion</p>
<p>That the virus must have been passed zoonotically from an animal like a pangolin</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t come from the lab and furthermore. They were starting to use language like conspiracy theory to discredit</p>
<p>The the lab leak the lab leak idea</p>
<p>Um, so that within a few days they were all in</p>
<p>on this sort of so-called zoonotic theory</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>they really began a</p>
<p>campaign</p>
<p>In the words of collins a devastating takedown</p>
<p>Of scientists who were trying to discuss the lab leak theory that became the official position</p>
<p>Why social?</p>
<p>Why well, okay. So this is where it gets really interesting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Obviously, I can&rsquo;t speculate to modus, but here&rsquo;s what we know the nih fauci&rsquo;s division</p>
<p>Years ago, there was a debate in the scientific community about how we study viruses</p>
<p>Fauci&rsquo;s an epidemiologist. He wants to study them makes sense. The debate</p>
<p>Is over whether you should enhance the viruses as a way to study them so-called gain-of-function research</p>
<p>Their fauci is on the side of uh engaging in that kind of research. There are other scientists</p>
<p>Who think it&rsquo;s crazy they lose</p>
<p>The nih then makes grants to a group called the eco health alliance as run by</p>
<p>Uh a british scientist named peter daszak. Okay, by the way, who doesn&rsquo;t who doesn&rsquo;t support eco health and an alliance?</p>
<p>Branding yeah, exactly. We love puppies. Yeah. We&rsquo;re yes</p>
<p>Angel puppy love. Yes, exactly</p>
<p>So so eco health alliance, which is has neither been good for the ecology for our health</p>
<p>or uh</p>
<p>Yes, so they then provide funding</p>
<p>To the wuhan institute of virology to study bat viruses where get you know function research then occurs</p>
<p>This lab in wuhan is known to have had leaks in the past</p>
<p>So just from a security choice not the best recipient of a grant, but that is what happens</p>
<p>Okay, and then we know the history from there. It&rsquo;s almost certain that what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the what&rsquo;s the element?</p>
<p>of this story that has to deal with the lancet and the yes, i&rsquo;ll tell you that worked for fauci and then uh</p>
<p>And then that person got a grant afterwards what well and then just one other thing. I want to point out here</p>
<p>Um, so we&rsquo;re clear. This has become a very partisan issue, but the original foas were done by buzzfeed</p>
<p>And the washington post sorry the foyer releases were done by buzzfeed and washington post</p>
<p>and now you have ran paul on the other side of it who seems like really wacky and</p>
<p>Obviously conspiracy right wing so you have this like really weird partisanship. That&rsquo;s now been embedded in it. Okay</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>So sax, can you explain the partisan nature and then has a question?</p>
<p>I almost want to take uh chamath&rsquo;s question first about who is this dazzic guy and what is this lancet letter?</p>
<p>Let me come back to the partisan thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, just going to try to establish the facts before we get into the partisan mess of this thing</p>
<p>So peter dazzic is the guy who made these grants to the wuhan institute of virology, okay</p>
<p>There is one other interesting fact when the west wanted to come in and investigate what happened in this lab</p>
<p>China approved one person from the west to come in and conduct the investigation. Guess who that was</p>
<p>Peter dazzic. Okay. He was the only guy</p>
<p>The ccp let in to go look at this lab. He then comes out of this</p>
<p>Whatever he did and says it has to be the zoonotic theory. He endorsed the wet market idea. It cannot be lab leak</p>
<p>That is a conspiracy theory and then he</p>
<p>Rounds up a group of scientists to write a letter to the lancet</p>
<p>Which is a respected scientific publication which incredibly respected. Yes, which he signs</p>
<p>In which he basically advocates the zoonotic theory, but he goes further and says there is no way</p>
<p>that it could be lab leak and anyone who says as a conspiracy theorist and that has</p>
<p>An incredibly chilling effect</p>
<p>On the scientific community because no scientist wants to be labeled a kook or conspiracy theory or heretical to the lancet</p>
<p>Exactly, and this is a tight-knit ecosystem</p>
<p>of um of</p>
<p>Insiders and institutions and grants no scientists wants to lose their funding, right?</p>
<p>And then furthermore big tech starts censoring as disinformation the lab leak theory because they say well these officials</p>
<p>Look at all the scientists we have to follow the science, right? So the science according to this letter from the lancet</p>
<p>Is basically on the side of the zoonotic theory</p>
<p>So you then have downstream censorship of this so that is who peter daszak is and and and in this letter</p>
<p>In the lancet, he never disclosed his conflict of interest, which is the fact that he funded</p>
<p>This wuhan institute of virology to conduct the type of research that might have led to the leak of the virus</p>
<p>So this guy is hopelessly conflicted and has a reason to want to suppress and cover up a lab leak</p>
<p>And he never disclosed it and look so does fauci. I mean because fauci</p>
<p>funded daszak</p>
<p>so imagine when in february</p>
<p>of 2020</p>
<p>When the lab leak is coming across the desk of fauci</p>
<p>Does he tell the president? Mr. President? He&rsquo;s at the right hand of the president. Mr. President. We might have funded this thing</p>
<p>We funded daszak who funded the wuhan lab</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>Collectively the united states government might have some responsibility in this. Do you think that conversation ever took place?</p>
<p>When he was making his recommendations, he was hopelessly conflicted and if the truth about this had come out and look i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>He had any intentional role. I&rsquo;m not saying he wanted this to happen</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not even saying that he knew for sure that daszak was funding the wuhan lab</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s just give fauci the benefit of the doubt, but we all know how politics works if it had come out in february of</p>
<p>2020 that fauci had funded the guy who funded the wuhan lab and that&rsquo;s where the virus</p>
<p>Likely came from his career would have been finished. Okay finished. We know that as a political reality</p>
<p>And so within days of scientists advising fauci. Hey, this thing probably came from the lab. The nih has consolidated around</p>
<p>The idea that this is a conspiracy theory and they work to suppress it and they wage a public campaign</p>
<p>I gotta tell you when I have learned all these facts. I gotta tell you what I compare it to</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like we learned all those revelations about bill cosby that here&rsquo;s this guy on tv for years</p>
<p>Pretending to be america&rsquo;s dad and then we find out he&rsquo;s a monster fauci has been on tv for years lecturing us about covid</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been like america&rsquo;s dad america&rsquo;s doctor and lo and behold we find out that he has a role</p>
<p>In this whole thing and look i&rsquo;m not saying his intent was not to of course</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s intent has been always to help people. So it&rsquo;s a little bit of course</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give him i&rsquo;m gonna give him the benefit of every doubt here</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give him the benefit of every doubt. Okay, just called him bill cosby</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give him the benefit of the doubt in the sense that he didn&rsquo;t want this to happen</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have any he didn&rsquo;t cause that but we know for a fact that he funded dazic who funded this lab</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where the virus came from. Come on</p>
<p>We know that and he covered it up he engaged in a campaign. Okay, we suppress the lab leak theory that is a conflict of interest</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get let&rsquo;s get freebie again on the science. What do you think as some a man of science?</p>
<p>Friedberg the sultan of science in fact about uh, these emails and the chances that fauci</p>
<p>essentially was</p>
<p>Funding gain of research and then attempting to cover it up, which is the accusation. That&rsquo;s a question of science</p>
<p>Look there. Um, I mentioned this in the past jamie science community, you know, jamie metzel did a um a podcast interview with lex friedman</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth listening to</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s a couple hours long if you&rsquo;ve got some time to kill</p>
<p>Um, but he does a good job contextualizing</p>
<p>These matters and what may have gone on that led ultimately to</p>
<p>Um the the lab leak and also the lab leak cover-up</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened with fauci and emails. I have not read this stuff</p>
<p>um, so I</p>
<p>You know, I have no reason to believe that fauci is malintentioned in the sense that</p>
<p>He has some reason to harm or hurt</p>
<p>um, I I could see that</p>
<p>There is a certain degree of nervousness to accuse the biggest</p>
<p>Foreign government and potential u.s adversary of causing a global pandemic and not wanting that sort of conflict to arise</p>
<p>At a period of time when you really need to take care of your people</p>
<p>And we really need to focus internally as a country on how do we get through this pandemic?</p>
<p>And making that I gotta respond to that I gotta respond to that</p>
<p>I have to respond to that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not saying that fauci or anyone involved in that process should have accused china</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what was their decision that what was not was debated. They decided to stop the debate altogether</p>
<p>They decided to suppress the debate</p>
<p>What would you have done in that seat sax you&rsquo;re sitting in that seat and the country is potentially facing a pandemic that could wipe</p>
<p>Out millions of americans. I&rsquo;ll tell you where do you prioritize?</p>
<p>If I was sitting at the nih and I wasn&rsquo;t hopelessly conflicted I would probably have just said listen</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the origin of the virus is. Let that debate continue</p>
<p>I would not have tried to wage a public campaign against the people against the scientists who were honestly</p>
<p>pursuing in good faith</p>
<p>Where this virus might have come from so we can learn things maybe how to avoid something like this from happening again</p>
<p>the people at the nih should not have engaged in that type of</p>
<p>Politically minded pr campaign they just shouldn&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s not their job as scientists and then to find out that they have a conflict of interest</p>
<p>On top of that that might be motivating that desire</p>
<p>That is not that is not appropriate. I think it&rsquo;s really important freeberg</p>
<p>You can probably agree with this that at some point some journalist</p>
<p>should really simplify this for all of us because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly important</p>
<p>Topic that we need to look at at the end of all of this assuming that omicron is the end of this chapter</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s been a horrible chapter for the world</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But we do need an accounting of the truth, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>there was an episode many ago when I said I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care about whether or not the virus came out of</p>
<p>China and um again, I was somewhat kind of misstated as the intention of why I said that the reason I said that</p>
<p>And what I really meant</p>
<p>Was that what happened even if it was a lab leak?</p>
<p>What happened was really the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>The ability to bioengineer pathogenic organisms is becoming ubiquitous</p>
<p>The toolkit to do gain-of-function research as it&rsquo;s being called in the press is a very simple toolkit</p>
<p>The ability to engineer organisms that can cause catastrophic harm to the human species</p>
<p>Is becoming available on the internet and with tools that any of us can buy and use in our garage</p>
<p>And so what i&rsquo;m more questioning and what i&rsquo;m more concerned about and what I care more about</p>
<p>Is what is our global biodefense strategy?</p>
<p>How are we getting ahead of the next wave of this happening?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not about the who said he said she said those things</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important to understand how we even know we need biodefense when they&rsquo;re saying it came zoonotically</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying it came from an animal when actually was created in the lab</p>
<p>If you want to have biodefense, we got to first say that whether it did or did. Yeah, you&rsquo;re right whether it did</p>
<p>Separate question to me whether it did or didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>The tooling to do this is absolutely possible and the ability for these sorts of viruses to leak out and be made</p>
<p>And turned into a weapon is significant. It&rsquo;s a real risk</p>
<p>And so i&rsquo;m with you guys. I think both of you guys are figuring out. How do we solve this problem?</p>
<p>Like how do we yeah, both of you guys are but both of you guys are saying nuanced versions of</p>
<p>David is saying we have to have</p>
<p>An honest accounting of what happened if we could if we&rsquo;re supposed to actually have an eco health alliance. Yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not by the way</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, i&rsquo;m not just making i&rsquo;m not dismissing that. Yeah, and you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>we need to actually formalize gain-of-function research because</p>
<p>Everybody has it and so it&rsquo;s going to be inappropriate for us to ignore it</p>
<p>We need to assume game and function research leads to dangerous pathogenic bioorganisms</p>
<p>And one doesn&rsquo;t cancel the other and then we need to formulate it doesn&rsquo;t and then we need to formulate a biodefense strategy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, just saying like we don&rsquo;t the implication the reason why sax&rsquo;s thing is important to me is the implications</p>
<p>We have to have an honest accounting of these implications. We saw another implication just this week in flint, michigan</p>
<p>They shut down</p>
<p>Indefinitely the public school system in flint, michigan</p>
<p>Okay, this is a society just to give you a sense of the facts here. 90 are minority</p>
<p>80 why did they shut it down because 80 percent because of covid. Yeah because of the fear</p>
<p>Uh of of catching covid and spreading covid</p>
<p>Uh, but and 90 are minority kids 80 are in poverty. I don&rsquo;t know how you know</p>
<p>80 of kids who are in poverty are expected to have</p>
<p>A laptop and internet access on a consistent basis. This is the same place that screwed up the water system</p>
<p>so, uh, I don&rsquo;t I so I think like we have to have an honest accounting of um,</p>
<p>Of all of these things because the implications are real</p>
<p>This is the biggest story of our lifetimes covet</p>
<p>I mean, it might be the biggest international incident since world war ii and the fact that</p>
<p>The major let&rsquo;s call it prestige publications have not really fully investigated. Hold on</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable conundrum to me because this started</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>Um a massive amount of coverage from buzzfeed washington post new york times in june of last year 2021</p>
<p>They were covering this like crazy vanity fair did a major investigation and then it seems to have gone</p>
<p>Silent and then ran paul has been going after this and it all of a sudden became partisan</p>
<p>So the only coverage i&rsquo;m seeing of it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s independent is the intercept</p>
<p>But then everything else is the hill and you know, really weird far right stuff that want to like, you know</p>
<p>Fauci needs to be whatever and how did it become so partisan if it started</p>
<p>With left-leaning publications getting this information sacks, like how did this become partisan? It&rsquo;s because the president changed in the middle</p>
<p>Of all this like what?</p>
<p>Do you have an honest?</p>
<p>Handicapping of why we can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>You know like a consensus on what&rsquo;s actually happening here from the press. Is it ran paul&rsquo;s too polarizing?</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>I think what happened is if you go back to february of 2020</p>
<p>If you look I just had this conversation with ashley rinsberg on my call-in show and you know, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Now available</p>
<p>Can I he he literally wrote the book on the new york times and I asked him about their coverage of</p>
<p>You could trade that on robert</p>
<p>So fine, can I can I finish</p>
<p>Sorry, this is the guy who literally this is the guy who literally wrote the book on</p>
<p>The new york times and I asked him about the new york times coverage of of covet and covet origins</p>
<p>He says that on february 17th. So basically two weeks after</p>
<p>These officials at the nih settle on the conspiracy theory narrative</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>That narrative is then published almost word for word verbatim using the same language</p>
<p>Not just the new york times in the washington post across all these major publications. So what you see there is a pr campaign</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a concerted effort</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get the same words and language being used across all the major publications at the same time</p>
<p>Unless somebody&rsquo;s pushing that narrative. We all know this. This is corporations do this, right?</p>
<p>They run pr campaigns. That is what basically happened. And so</p>
<p>the prestige media got on board this zoonotic theory and this idea look</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ve done so many times they got on board wmd in iraq before realizing it was a total farce and a hoax</p>
<p>Okay, they so they got themselves on record behind this conspiracy theory idea</p>
<p>and similarly</p>
<p>I think the democrats got themselves on record as being pro fauci and everything</p>
<p>Because of you know tds right anyone who&rsquo;s standing up to trump must be correct and defend it</p>
<p>And so all of this happened in 2020</p>
<p>And so by the time we now fast forward to let&rsquo;s call it an honest</p>
<p>Investigation of the origins the virus which should be bipartisan. This should not be partisan</p>
<p>We should all want to know what happened</p>
<p>We should all want to take the politics out of it because without knowing what happened. How do we prepare for it in the future?</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s already like hopelessly committed to positions. They took in 2020 and I think this was driving the partisanship</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean that&rsquo;s the thing i&rsquo;m trying to get to is like when I saw you wanted to put it on the docket</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>Trying to grok this and I can&rsquo;t find i&rsquo;m finding</p>
<p>all the</p>
<p>left-leaning coverage from june of 2021</p>
<p>None since then and then it&rsquo;s all right coverage now, and I think it&rsquo;s something we need to get</p>
<p>Some independent coverage with so i&rsquo;ll take credit. I&rsquo;ll take credit for saying fauci is the biggest political luther at our all-in</p>
<p>Uh podcast recap. Thank you. I&rsquo;ll take my bow now</p>
<p>Well, I mean and the the other thing that&rsquo;s kind of my half our predictions have come true already. I mean right now</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so correct on these things</p>
<p>um, the thing that&rsquo;s I think just infuriating right now is that everybody is trying to manipulate the public</p>
<p>And they have not understood that in this media environment the truth comes out</p>
<p>Kind of not only eventually but pretty quickly</p>
<p>So stop trying to game the public either way that the vaccines don&rsquo;t work. Jason</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve delayed the public reckoning on this by what like two years. Well, here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a so I agree with you on that</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a fuller release that happened in the uk</p>
<p>where and it&rsquo;s a little too much to get into right now, but</p>
<p>This fuller release now is looking at all the people who died in the uk of covid</p>
<p>Uh, and it turns out like maybe more people are dying because they didn&rsquo;t get their cancer or a large number of people</p>
<p>Died because they didn&rsquo;t go in to get tested for cancer and all of this is going to come out eventually and not</p>
<p>putting out every day</p>
<p>the ages</p>
<p>um, and the comorbidities of people who died of covid just led to this</p>
<p>Feeling that we&rsquo;re getting gamed and turning on cnn and seeing the case counts in a cumulative chart</p>
<p>Is like a startup giving me like the cumulative number of people who registered for their company</p>
<p>But for their product we don&rsquo;t care about that. We want to know your daily active users</p>
<p>What about what about the catastrophic impact of school closures that we&rsquo;ve been talking about in this show repeatedly?</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s being manipulated stop manipulating the public look you you have to realize that there is huge political motivations here because</p>
<p>Huge cya going on because the heads of the teachers union said there is no learning loss</p>
<p>They are the ones who lobby to shut the schools down. They sure as hell aren&rsquo;t going to admit their mistake now</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re covering it up. And so any politician who takes their money is basically they&rsquo;re going to muffle their criticism</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one really honest like left-wing guy i&rsquo;ve seen acknowledge the school closure issue, which was jonathan chait had a great article</p>
<p>in new york magazine</p>
<p>Saying that progressives must acknowledge the mistake of school closures because otherwise we can&rsquo;t learn from it</p>
<p>He has been a voice in the wilderness on that side of the aisle</p>
<p>We got to wrap up now that uh, sax has cracked open the plugs</p>
<p>Uh, what are we all working on because I want to give a plug to friedberg</p>
<p>Who did a great interview?</p>
<p>On a tech podcast called this week in startups where he announced canna</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a dual plug here, uh friday&rsquo;s episode of this week in startups</p>
<p>Uh, maybe you could tell us a little bit about the launch of canna your new uh, yeah, we&rsquo;re just we&rsquo;re just announcing the business</p>
<p>Um, which I talk about a lot on jason&rsquo;s pod</p>
<p>So definitely worth hearing but as you guys know i&rsquo;ve talked a lot about this concept of decentralized manufacturing where we can kind of move</p>
<p>old school industrial production systems</p>
<p>Which are super inefficient. We use lots of resources move stuff into factories process them and then ship the products back out</p>
<p>And um, you know technology now allows us to have more distributed or decentralized manufacturing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Potentially so what you know what we&rsquo;ve been working on for three years at this point is a company called canna</p>
<p>Which is really about you know, uh</p>
<p>Printing beverages in your home so you can use a single device</p>
<p>to print a iced coffee or iced tea</p>
<p>cocktail juice wine soda</p>
<p>Etc. Um all using a single flavoring system and water from your from your sink</p>
<p>We talked more about it on the pod, but I think this is a big theme, you know, forget about canna for a second</p>
<p>But generally like the systems of old like, you know</p>
<p>The industrial revolution created all these old school systems that are big contributors to carbon emissions and are super resource inefficient</p>
<p>Uh, and I do think that everything from 3d printing to biomanufacturing to this system that we kind of introduced today with canna</p>
<p>Um can completely reinvent our global industries in different ways</p>
<p>Um and ultimately lead to cheaper products better products and products that use much less natural resources and put less carbon out</p>
<p>um, and so it&rsquo;s been a big thing that we&rsquo;ve been working on i&rsquo;m excited to kind of</p>
<p>Open it up a little bit and talk more about what we&rsquo;re doing. So, um, thanks for having me on</p>
<p>Did you hire the muth, uh as a spokesperson he may or may not have his brand on here</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see there. So right now the business is um</p>
<p>Uh is signing up lots of different folks that can create digital beverage brands</p>
<p>And so if any of you guys want to have jcals</p>
<p>You know hard cider hard cider. Um, here we go. We&rsquo;ll uh, we&rsquo;ll be launching that but but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Actually told me his his new um, his new soda that he&rsquo;s going to be bringing it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>Muth cola it has five times the sugar of coca-cola other than that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like any other colder, but you get five times the calorie if it rips out like maple syrup</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, i&rsquo;d like to i&rsquo;d like to do a plug. You got a plug. I&rsquo;m, sorry project</p>
<p>I want to I want to say it again. Um</p>
<p>in genesee county in michigan flint</p>
<p>Indefinitely shut down their public schools this week what is going on? You have thousands of kids</p>
<p>um who at best will have to learn via zoom and internet access that most of these kids may or may not have because</p>
<p>again</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re in poverty</p>
<p>And so I just want to make sure that everybody just understands that everybody tweet that and self-inflicted wounds. Well, here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>These kids, um, this is one of eric adam&rsquo;s 90 90 percent minority 80 percent in poverty</p>
<p>Um all virtual until further notice. Well, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen. It goes right against the cdc guidelines</p>
<p>okay, and uh</p>
<p>This is really the accounting of the cost</p>
<p>And we are as we said before learning loss in our kids is going to be the single biggest thing</p>
<p>We look back in 20 years coming out of this pandemic</p>
<p>Uh and realize was the the the biggest price we paid for this so</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the stupidity of it the what the and eric adams and the in the new york city, uh,</p>
<p>You know sort of uh leadership. We&rsquo;re talking about this when these kids are in school</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chance they&rsquo;re gonna get omicron like everybody got omicron like everybody has it now like it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>How many people in our circle have it? The only person who doesn&rsquo;t have is phil helmut</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen when they go home or they&rsquo;re not in school and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Hanging out with their friends or looking for something. They&rsquo;re gonna get it. Anyway</p>
<p>What eric adams said is that school is the safest place for them to be. Yes, totally</p>
<p>Totally and school shutdowns are just so insane to me right now</p>
<p>Unicef had an article which i&rsquo;ll dig up where they said that the cost in future earnings by this generation</p>
<p>Of students who suffered learning loss is going to be 17 trillion</p>
<p>Worldwide, uh, that&rsquo;s going to be the economic impact from this thing not to mention the</p>
<p>Stunted emotional development by locking these kids down for anxiety ptsd. I mean this is going to create depression in kids</p>
