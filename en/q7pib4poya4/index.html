content="Video Transcript ﻿now when we talk about exercise we have to talk about the different parts of exercise the anatomy of exercise it&amp;rsquo;s really simply composed of the duration the intensity the recovery and the frequency how many times you do the duration intensity in a given workout and then you can also talk about the frequency per week and so there&amp;rsquo;s different variables to exercise that create different effects for example duration if you exercise at a certain constant rate of exercise over a long period of time let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re doing a marathon that tends to spike cortisol and the third factor of recovery is very very important too especially if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to lose weight and especially if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get rid of soreness for example because if you over exercise you over train and you don&amp;rsquo;t get the recovery that puts a tremendous amount of stress on your heart on the muscle tissue but today i want to talk about the importance of intensity so number one doing a workout that has a sufficient amount of intensity can increase your aerobic capacity it increases more capacity to deliver oxygen to your muscles and so more oxygen to the muscles is going to get rid of the lactic acid buildup you&amp;rsquo;ll have more endurance and overall you&amp;rsquo;re going to repair a lot better all right number two there&amp;rsquo;s a greater reduction in cardiovascular disease and premature death now you now this is interesting because you would think the more intense you go the more dangerous this exercise would be but apparently not especially if you keep your duration shorter and i think the reason why especially if you&amp;rsquo;re comparing an intense workout to let&amp;rsquo;s say a moderate amount of intensity over a sustained period of time the sustained exercise is working against the heart because it&amp;rsquo;s not following a wave like pattern where you&amp;rsquo;re doing short duration high intensity short duration high intensity the heart works on the rhythm so any type of exercise you can mimic a rhythm is a lot healthier than a sustained type of workout all right number three significant improvement in insulin sensitivity so if you&amp;rsquo;re a diabetic if you are a pre-diabetic if you have insulin resistance or you&amp;rsquo;re in keto you&amp;rsquo;re trying to speed up the results which is all about improving insulin resistance and reducing insulin the intensity of exercise is what you should focus on all right number four intensity is a potent trigger to increase growth hormone now what is growth hormone it&amp;rsquo;s a hormone that&amp;rsquo;s made by your pituitary it works through the liver and it&amp;rsquo;s an anabolic hormone that means it builds things up builds your muscles up it helps you make certain proteins other proteins other than muscle protein it helps grow your bones it helps grow your organs and as you get older it starts going down so after the age of 50 it&amp;rsquo;s very important to do some form of exercise that involves intensity with a lot of recovery also growth hormone is all about calcium retention in the bone fat burning it&amp;rsquo;s anti-aging it helps your immune system and it helps you convert t4 to t3 the active form of the thyroid hormone interesting so intensity is a potent trigger to growth hormone you also have sleep delta wave sleep that&amp;rsquo;s when you trigger the majority of growth hormone also having low blood glucose can help stimulate growth hormone that&amp;rsquo;s keto right low carb vitamin b3 niacin can help stimulate growth hormone fasting is a potent trigger of growth hormone keeping your stress low will also help you enhance growth hormone because when as soon as you increase cortisol from stress you diminish your growth hormone and of course the last one which i already mentioned the intensity of exercise is a potent

about the different parts of exercise the anatomy  </p><p>of exercise it&rsquo;s really simply composed of 
the duration the intensity the recovery and  </p><p>the frequency how many times you do the duration 
intensity in a given workout and then you can also  </p><p>talk about the frequency per week and so there&rsquo;s 
different variables to exercise that create  </p><p>different effects for example duration if you 
exercise at a certain constant rate of exercise  </p><p>over a long period of time let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing 
a marathon that tends to spike cortisol and the  </p><p>third factor of recovery is very very important 
too especially if you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight  </p><p>and especially if you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of 
soreness for example because if you over exercise  </p><p>you over train and you don&rsquo;t get the recovery that 
puts a tremendous amount of stress on your heart  </p><p>on the muscle tissue but today i want to talk 
about the importance of intensity so number one  </p><p>doing a workout that has a sufficient amount of 
intensity can increase your aerobic capacity it  </p><p>increases more capacity to deliver oxygen to 
your muscles and so more oxygen to the muscles  </p><p>is going to get rid of the lactic acid buildup 
you&rsquo;ll have more endurance and overall you&rsquo;re  </p><p>going to repair a lot better all right number 
two there&rsquo;s a greater reduction in cardiovascular  </p><p>disease and premature death now you now this 
is interesting because you would think the more  </p><p>intense you go the more dangerous this exercise 
would be but apparently not especially if you keep  </p><p>your duration shorter and i think the reason why 
especially if you&rsquo;re comparing an intense workout  </p><p>to let&rsquo;s say a moderate amount of intensity over 
a sustained period of time the sustained exercise  </p><p>is working against the heart because it&rsquo;s not 
following a wave like pattern where you&rsquo;re doing  </p><p>short duration high intensity short duration 
high intensity the heart works on the rhythm  </p><p>so any type of exercise you can mimic a rhythm is 
a lot healthier than a sustained type of workout  </p><p>all right number three significant improvement 
in insulin sensitivity so if you&rsquo;re a diabetic  </p><p>if you are a pre-diabetic if you have insulin 
resistance or you&rsquo;re in keto you&rsquo;re trying to  </p><p>speed up the results which is all about improving 
insulin resistance and reducing insulin the  </p><p>intensity of exercise is what you should focus 
on all right number four intensity is a potent  </p><p>trigger to increase growth hormone now what 
is growth hormone it&rsquo;s a hormone that&rsquo;s made  </p><p>by your pituitary it works through the liver 
and it&rsquo;s an anabolic hormone that means it  </p><p>builds things up builds your muscles up 
it helps you make certain proteins other  </p><p>proteins other than muscle protein it helps 
grow your bones it helps grow your organs  </p><p>and as you get older it starts going down so 
after the age of 50 it&rsquo;s very important to do  </p><p>some form of exercise that involves intensity with 
a lot of recovery also growth hormone is all about  </p><p>calcium retention in the bone fat burning 
it&rsquo;s anti-aging it helps your immune system  </p><p>and it helps you convert t4 to t3 the active form 
of the thyroid hormone interesting so intensity is  </p><p>a potent trigger to growth hormone you also have 
sleep delta wave sleep that&rsquo;s when you trigger the  </p><p>majority of growth hormone also having low blood 
glucose can help stimulate growth hormone that&rsquo;s  </p><p>keto right low carb vitamin b3 niacin can help 
stimulate growth hormone fasting is a potent  </p><p>trigger of growth hormone keeping your stress low 
will also help you enhance growth hormone because  </p><p>when as soon as you increase cortisol from stress 
you diminish your growth hormone and of course the  </p><p>last one which i already mentioned the intensity 
of exercise is a potent trigger for growth hormone  </p><p>before you go if you&rsquo;re 
benefiting from any of my content  </p><p>i would love to hear about your success
