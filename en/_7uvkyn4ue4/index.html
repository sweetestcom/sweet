<p>﻿[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>hello everyone we&rsquo;re back for another q</p>
<p>a and uh hopefully hope you have a lot</p>
<p>of questions because we have a lot of</p>
<p>answers for you</p>
<p>um we have the answers already written</p>
<p>out even before your questions but</p>
<p>anything that we say is definitely not</p>
<p>meant to diagnose or replace your</p>
<p>medical care check with your doc before</p>
<p>um doing anything that we tell you to do</p>
<p>absolutely great Council</p>
<p>uh Dr Berg anyway why don&rsquo;t we kick</p>
<p>things off right with those we love on</p>
<p>social media which is everyone and</p>
<p>Sharon from YouTube starts it off I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>68 year old woman what vitamins and</p>
<p>minerals should be in my Arsenal for</p>
<p>Optimal Health good for you Sharon</p>
<p>foreign well if if you want to get a</p>
<p>multivitamin just make sure it&rsquo;s a food</p>
<p>base complex versus a synthetic version</p>
<p>that would be the most important thing</p>
<p>but out of all the nutrients</p>
<p>um that are difficult to get in your</p>
<p>Foods we should probably run on the list</p>
<p>for that that would be the vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 okay that would be number one</p>
<p>trace minerals are sometimes hard</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids sometimes are a bit</p>
<p>difficult sometimes even the B vitamins</p>
<p>are hard to get</p>
<p>potassium is another one that&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>get in magnesium so those are the ones</p>
<p>that probably are more important than</p>
<p>other ones</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;ll give you uh kind of a rough</p>
<p>idea of of what you should focus on and</p>
<p>I will give a Shameless plug for the</p>
<p>electrolyte formula it&rsquo;s a Super Value</p>
<p>because you get a zillion Scoops out of</p>
<p>one of those jugs and they have all that</p>
<p>stuff that Dr Berg talks about and it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>keep you healthy and if you drink with a</p>
<p>lot of water hydrated and all that so</p>
<p>grab a jug of that you won&rsquo;t be sorry</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see uh moving on from</p>
<p>social media uh moving on to social</p>
<p>media again John from YouTube how can I</p>
<p>get rid of stiffness in my back legs and</p>
<p>hips John&rsquo;s just all tweaked up</p>
<p>well I think I I did a video on that um</p>
<p>if you have stiffness in the back of</p>
<p>your legs</p>
<p>um obviously the hamstrings are</p>
<p>something you need to stretch but a</p>
<p>little tip on that if you stretch out</p>
<p>your quadricep</p>
<p>um thigh muscles that will actually</p>
<p>allow you to loosen up the hamstrings so</p>
<p>uh anytime you have a tight muscle</p>
<p>stretch the opposite muscle and Watch</p>
<p>What Happens another common muscle that</p>
<p>becomes stiff especially in the lower</p>
<p>back area that crate low crazy low back</p>
<p>pain is the psoas and that&rsquo;s the hip</p>
<p>flexor so if you were to lay on your</p>
<p>stomach on the floor or on your bed and</p>
<p>then kind of arch back up you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to stretch that that muscle I did a</p>
<p>video on that muscle if you look up the</p>
<p>psoas how to stretch it and that really</p>
<p>gets rid of low back pain in a big way</p>
<p>so anything you can do to um</p>
<p>do arching back would be a very very</p>
<p>good thing</p>
<p>the other thing that I want to point out</p>
<p>uh backward walking helps reverse the</p>
<p>the Dynamics and strengthens the glutes</p>
<p>in different parts of your your knee</p>
<p>which will help um put balance more in</p>
<p>for your lower back</p>
<p>so um that would be something I would</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>all right very good well I tell you what</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re excited to have some guests</p>
<p>from Qatar and Nigeria and they&rsquo;ll be on</p>
<p>a little later but in in addition here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s listening around the world uh we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like to say a welcome to everyone in the</p>
<p>UK Canada Mexico Lithuania India Wales</p>
<p>Georgia uh the country that is Jordan</p>
<p>Australia Japan France the Netherlands</p>
<p>Tigre Pakistan Sweden Chile the</p>
<p>Dominican Republic Oman Iran Switzerland</p>
<p>New Zealand Taiwan Algeria Poland Greece</p>
<p>Italy Nigeria there we go Belgium Ghana</p>
<p>Norway Ethiopia Peru South Africa</p>
<p>Bulgaria</p>
<p>Ireland Pakistan Uganda Guadalupe</p>
<p>Zimbabwe Eritrea Saudi Arabia Austria</p>
<p>the Virgin Islands Madagascar Hong Kong</p>
<p>Jamaica Slovakia Trinidad and Tobago</p>
<p>Germany Germany Nepal Malaysia Bermuda</p>
<p>Bermuda excuse me United Arab Emirates</p>
<p>Kenya the Philippines Cyprus Singapore</p>
<p>Israel Venezuela Egypt and of course all</p>
<p>across the United States of America so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so exciting to know that people</p>
<p>from absolutely every corner of the</p>
<p>globe are listening and trying to figure</p>
<p>out how to live healthily and not just</p>
<p>trying but succeeding for goodness sakes</p>
<p>um if I can find well Steve you know</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re on the topic of uh Global</p>
<p>different countries and and I think</p>
<p>I would love to have everyone type in if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re watching from other countries</p>
<p>um a traditional</p>
<p>um sausage I&rsquo;m doing a video on</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>kind of traditional authentic sausages</p>
<p>from different countries that involve</p>
<p>different recipes I just need to know</p>
<p>the name so I can look at it if if you</p>
<p>would type in comment below if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if your country kind of like whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in Hungary or Yugoslavia and you</p>
<p>have or Poland and you have this amazing</p>
<p>sausage that I can look up I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>interested in that a lot of times these</p>
<p>sausages use recipes that use organ</p>
<p>Meats so I&rsquo;m looking into that area and</p>
<p>you would greatly help me if you just</p>
<p>type that in down below and I&rsquo;ll read it</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re done that&rsquo;s fantastic well I</p>
<p>guarantee you our audience well they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so wonderfully responsive with all that</p>
<p>and I said that the people around every</p>
<p>corner of the globe uh you know want to</p>
<p>include their names because they want to</p>
<p>pursue Health well many of them have and</p>
<p>succeeded Tom from YouTube is one of</p>
<p>them Tom has lost 106 pounds on healthy</p>
<p>keto and intermittent fasting thank you</p>
<p>can you talk about switching over to</p>
<p>maintenance mode and what I can do now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve reached my ideal weight</p>
<p>without lose using any more pounds</p>
<p>well the thing about maintenance is you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to change too many things now</p>
<p>the question is let&rsquo;s say you start</p>
<p>losing too much weight that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>completely different thing so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>losing too much weight then you maybe</p>
<p>want to add in a bit more</p>
<p>fat and then maybe raise the carbs a</p>
<p>little bit more not to go over that 50</p>
<p>grams</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um you know I think with maintenance</p>
<p>if you have</p>
<p>really improved your your health and</p>
<p>your have less of a insulin resistance</p>
<p>problem and you have more leeway</p>
<p>to get away with things that you</p>
<p>probably were not able to get away with</p>
<p>before so you might want to test the</p>
<p>waters and see if you can occasionally</p>
<p>have those days where you go off the</p>
<p>program and see how you do if you can</p>
<p>get back on readily it just it just</p>
<p>gives you more flexibility the more</p>
<p>Health you have in your reserve tank the</p>
<p>better you are but unfortunately those</p>
<p>people who</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that leeway can&rsquo;t afford to</p>
<p>do that they&rsquo;re the ones that are doing</p>
<p>that more than the people that do have</p>
<p>that Health Reserve very good well</p>
<p>listen Tom and this goes for anyone this</p>
<p>is a free service if you need to gain</p>
<p>weight just hang around me for a week</p>
<p>and I guarantee results no questions I</p>
<p>think you should create a book Steve on</p>
<p>how to gain weight on keto or borderline</p>
<p>keto right borderline I call borderline</p>
<p>keto Krispy Kreme as you know in fact</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll call it the keto-like done the</p>
<p>keto like or lie about what you eat keto</p>
<p>uh is another very popular one that I</p>
<p>come up you know this morning we were</p>
<p>worried we didn&rsquo;t have enough gas in the</p>
<p>green room and Terry said well it looks</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re just going to have to go</p>
<p>through your top five Donuts Steve</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll keep people entertained in lieu</p>
<p>of other stuff all right enough about my</p>
<p>horrible eating Hatters actually I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>lying I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of weight</p>
<p>intermittent fasting love it what a</p>
<p>great lifestyle Hannah from Facebook</p>
<p>which deficiency do I have that causes</p>
<p>excess earwax ew</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the deficiency of Q-tips</p>
<p>um you need to get more of those and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t stick them too deep in your ear uh</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s you know it could be I did a</p>
<p>video on this it could be and many</p>
<p>different things</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not usually just a specific</p>
<p>thing sometimes you might find that you</p>
<p>might low in vitamin D but if you</p>
<p>just realize that um</p>
<p>if you get in the healthy version of</p>
<p>Keto</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have more normalized um</p>
<p>oil that&rsquo;s on your skin so your</p>
<p>sebaceous glands will do better</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;ll have less wax in your ears</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>less artery plaquing just by putting</p>
<p>implementing the basic healthy eating</p>
<p>plan that I recommend it&rsquo;s right on the</p>
<p>website you can down it download it and</p>
<p>watch the videos and implement it within</p>
<p>a day</p>
<p>all right interesting okay</p>
<p>um I feel her pain pray neat from</p>
<p>YouTube what is causing gray hair in</p>
<p>someone who is very young in their early</p>
<p>20s like me CDOC as things move on it</p>
<p>changes from that to no hair so count</p>
<p>your blessings no that&rsquo;s all I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re what 28 now so yeah all right 29.</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>29 I&rsquo;m sorry that&rsquo;s right um yeah it</p>
<p>really has to do there are certain</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>nutrient deficiency links</p>
<p>to the screen like paba would be one if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient but I personally think</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s a couple things involved</p>
<p>there might be a pre uh like a weakness</p>
<p>within the genes but then stress stress</p>
<p>would probably be the biggest thing that</p>
<p>can generate and one hand it could</p>
<p>generate too much hydrogen peroxide</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have the antioxidants so</p>
<p>um that would be the thing that kind of</p>
<p>jumps out is that uh cortisol</p>
<p>um stress response chronic stress is</p>
<p>probably the single most biggest factor</p>
<p>in graying graying hair</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s mix things up</p>
<p>with today&rsquo;s first question here it is</p>
<p>Doc</p>
<p>Okay so which has a stronger anti-cancer</p>
<p>effect</p>
<p>broccoli Sprouts or you could say micro</p>
<p>greens or radish Sprouts or micro greens</p>
<p>All Right audience climb on it good luck</p>
<p>with that first question uh and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see Omar from YouTube dear Dr Berg how</p>
<p>formal could you please make a video</p>
<p>about the best way to treat post nasal</p>
<p>drip</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>um I have several videos on that topic</p>
<p>but I tell you what uh I will promise</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at it to see if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anything I&rsquo;m missing or maybe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>new information I think that&rsquo;s a I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good good topic and I&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>looking for</p>
<p>new topics that people want to know</p>
<p>about and um that I haven&rsquo;t already</p>
<p>talked about which is becoming a bit</p>
<p>more difficult Steve</p>
<p>all right very good well Barb speaking</p>
<p>of nutrients or supplements Barbara from</p>
<p>Facebook can you offer your electrolytes</p>
<p>in a capsule form</p>
<p>uh I think we do I think we do already</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not mistaken it&rsquo;s uh we do have</p>
<p>that in a capsule form so that way</p>
<p>um you can swallow them</p>
<p>all right well let&rsquo;s go right to the</p>
<p>website it might be on Amazon too so</p>
<p>just check around that&rsquo;s good all right</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m not sure this is completely</p>
<p>related but it&rsquo;s time to talk about it</p>
<p>and speaking of finding out about stuff</p>
<p>you can download Dr Berg&rsquo;s free app for</p>
<p>both iOS Apple stuff or Android and get</p>
<p>tons of answers to your questions and</p>
<p>watch all the latest videos and they are</p>
<p>uniquely organized as I understand so we</p>
<p>love you going to YouTube and so on but</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to find what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for but not so in the app the</p>
<p>app is all organized and will help you</p>
<p>fare it through things until you find</p>
<p>now the the good and bad news is that Dr</p>
<p>Berg has like a zillion videos how many</p>
<p>now four or five thousand</p>
<p>well I deleted a lot of the older ones</p>
<p>so I think I&rsquo;m down to like</p>
<p>5462 right now wow wow that&rsquo;s fantastic</p>
<p>and all freshened up</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s great yeah trying to hit</p>
<p>that 6 000 Mark it&rsquo;s just taken taken</p>
<p>forever well you don&rsquo;t uh you don&rsquo;t um</p>
<p>you know go quickly through those I know</p>
<p>you put a lot of work and a lot of</p>
<p>research so we appreciate your</p>
<p>thoroughness and we&rsquo;ll wait for the 6000</p>
<p>Mark uh with great patience okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>we already talked about Hannah&rsquo;s ear wax</p>
<p>sorry to tease you about that Hannah</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back up here</p>
<p>um you talked about stiffness how about</p>
<p>Zappa Frank</p>
<p>borrowing a name from YouTube what can I</p>
<p>take to shrink lung nodules have you</p>
<p>heard of such a thing Doc</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m I I hope they&rsquo;re not you know</p>
<p>cancer but um I I don&rsquo;t um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>too much about nodules in the lung but</p>
<p>maybe are you talking about cysts</p>
<p>um fluid-filled cysts which is your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s trying to protect something or</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trying to encapsulate something</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and um I did a video on that but as far</p>
<p>as nodules go</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t have a lot of data I would</p>
<p>imagine like the thing about the lungs</p>
<p>is that um all the particles all the</p>
<p>smoke all the pollution all the stuff</p>
<p>that you breathe in and goes right into</p>
<p>the lungs and something can start</p>
<p>irritating and forming a you know maybe</p>
<p>some type of encapsulated nodule a lot</p>
<p>of that stuff ends up in the liver so um</p>
<p>I would probably look at your</p>
<p>environment where you live secondhand</p>
<p>smoke or even third hand smoke where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually touching it on furniture</p>
<p>and things like that probably play a big</p>
<p>factor I recently have done a series of</p>
<p>videos on on lung health and how to</p>
<p>detoxify your lung I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever released that I may have not</p>
<p>released that yet but stay tuned because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show different ways to clean your</p>
<p>lungs out especially if you have been a</p>
<p>smoker or a round smoke or pollution all</p>
<p>right very good well as we suspected the</p>
<p>audience is leapt right on the first</p>
<p>question which asks what has a stronger</p>
<p>anti-cancer effect broccoli Sprouts or</p>
<p>radish sprouts and the audience</p>
<p>suggested at least 50 percent of them</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s broccoli sprouts</p>
<p>and the other 50 right down the middle</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s radish sprouts who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>you know this is um one of those topics</p>
<p>that if you search broccoli Sprouts it</p>
<p>just always talks about cancer and the</p>
<p>powerful effects there&rsquo;s some new</p>
<p>research out which I just created a</p>
<p>video on that uh talks Compares these</p>
<p>two sprouts and uh apparently the radish</p>
<p>Sprout has a more potent effect on</p>
<p>cancer and for and then I will talk</p>
<p>about why that is but that was quite new</p>
<p>news for me and so you know I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>be eating more of</p>
<p>um radish Sprouts but uh</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>great but rather Sprouts have that X</p>
<p>Factor radish rashes are interesting too</p>
<p>because they tend to</p>
<p>whole mucus from the body they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>high in Sulfur and they pull mucus from</p>
<p>the deeper parts of the the lung the</p>
<p>lymphatic system they&rsquo;re a great cleaner</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re great for sinus congestion I</p>
<p>remember one day I I Juiced um I think</p>
<p>it was 13 ounces of Daikon radish and I</p>
<p>drank it without I would I plug my nose</p>
<p>I will never do that again Steve oh my</p>
<p>God but um you talked about a</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter clean up your mucus actually</p>
<p>it it pulls mucus out of your body</p>
<p>versus suppressing it wow all right well</p>
<p>anyway why don&rsquo;t we go to the first true</p>
<p>falser which our audience loves because</p>
<p>you got a 50 50 chance of being right</p>
<p>and there it is Doc okay here we go true</p>
<p>or false fat cell dysfunction is the</p>
<p>trigger for insulin resistance</p>
<p>all right what say you audience climb on</p>
<p>that and I tell Why Don&rsquo;t We Now go to</p>
<p>um the west coast of Africa to the</p>
<p>beautiful Nigeria of which the beautiful</p>
<p>Mary is on with us and Mary if you will</p>
<p>uh unmute yourself you are on with Dr</p>
<p>Burr go ahead with your one question</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>hi Dr Bank</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>hi so my question is basically on acid</p>
<p>reflux and ulcer I have listened to most</p>
<p>of your videos and I just started on the</p>
<p>um side of the apple cider drink but my</p>
<p>son and I have been suffering this and</p>
<p>my son is eight</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure I mean based on what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to it sounded more like it</p>
<p>should be something that should happen</p>
<p>to an older person</p>
<p>um but being my son is eight now and he</p>
<p>started having an ulcer when he was</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>uh six or seven but yeah</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just wondering what I take should</p>
<p>he take it and um</p>
<p>when you have</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>ulcer and then you have to treat acid</p>
<p>reflux and intermittent fasting how does</p>
<p>that all work out right before an 80</p>
<p>year old as well okay quick question I</p>
<p>have for you would you say that he has</p>
<p>kind of a</p>
<p>typical diet of a young person where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that healthy before the saucer</p>
<p>okay good so yeah I think um the the</p>
<p>most important thing is to get him</p>
<p>educated so he can change the diet</p>
<p>radically because the sugar the refined</p>
<p>flowers all that set them up for an</p>
<p>ulcer uh for sure</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s number one now</p>
<p>if you were to get him to have</p>
<p>those green things called salads with uh</p>
<p>maybe radish Sprouts or even broccoli</p>
<p>Sprouts will have sulforaphane the</p>
<p>sulforaphane will actually</p>
<p>help if there is an H pylori micro which</p>
<p>usually is involved yeah and then that</p>
<p>will put that thing back in remission</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll start to heal it with</p>
<p>maybe some cabbage juice and then also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh some zinc</p>
<p>now the problem is if we start adding</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar with an</p>
<p>ulcer now we&rsquo;re going to create a</p>
<p>problem because you have to heal the</p>
<p>ulcer first which does take some months</p>
<p>so you really can&rsquo;t get into the</p>
<p>acidifiers yet until everything&rsquo;s healed</p>
<p>up so this is kind of like</p>
<p>just getting the person eating healthy</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s intense burning I would</p>
<p>add just a little bit of baking soda</p>
<p>that way it can um that would be the</p>
<p>only time I would recommend baking soda</p>
<p>to help with um kind of just the</p>
<p>acidifying effect because we cannot acid</p>
<p>we can add that it&rsquo;s not going to worsen</p>
<p>things but it&rsquo;ll actually give them some</p>
<p>relief</p>
<p>in the meantime there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gastritis and uh so we just need to heal</p>
<p>that with the correct diet</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what I would recommend and for</p>
<p>both you and your son for sure like okay</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have radish Sprouts around</p>
<p>here oh okay you can you can do just uh</p>
<p>cabbage cabbage juice and drink that</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;ll that&rsquo;ll work and eat it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s enough sulforaphane in that and</p>
<p>you can even eat broccoli too that&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>it as well</p>
<p>okay so just one</p>
<p>um so the thing about cabbage I heard it</p>
<p>has some thyroid problems it causes I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how true that is it&rsquo;s it is</p>
<p>uh a cruciferous and all the cruciferous</p>
<p>are um quatrogenic uh to some degree but</p>
<p>you would have to consume a tremendous</p>
<p>amount and to deplete your iodine so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>um if you have any concerns all you have</p>
<p>to do is add a little C kelp to that mix</p>
<p>you know maybe one tablet a day or even</p>
<p>c-calp in the diet and then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>counter any negative effects from that</p>
<p>um that cabbage</p>
<p>okay okay yeah thank you thank you thank</p>
<p>you so much for joining us Mary we</p>
<p>really appreciate your time and patience</p>
<p>with us and look forward to hearing back</p>
<p>from you if you don&rsquo;t mind and see just</p>
<p>how well these various things work for</p>
<p>you and your son I believe&rsquo;s diet all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s uh see oh my gosh audience</p>
<p>how do you do it the audience is always</p>
<p>they actually answer the questions</p>
<p>before we ask them how do you do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s AI or something anyway but here</p>
<p>you had asked true false fat cell</p>
<p>dysfunction is the trigger for insulin</p>
<p>resistance and the audience astutely</p>
<p>said we hope seventy percent of them say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true and thirty percent say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false</p>
<p>who gets the Cadillac well the answer is</p>
<p>true because we always when I talk about</p>
<p>insulin resistance I&rsquo;m talking about you</p>
<p>know eating a lot of sugar raising</p>
<p>insulin and creating this problem but</p>
<p>there also there&rsquo;s this other thing that</p>
<p>um is going on behind the scenes that um</p>
<p>and that has to do with dysfunctional</p>
<p>fat cells the fat cells become filled up</p>
<p>to the point where they they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>okay I had enough so then you start</p>
<p>getting fat that leaks outside the fat</p>
<p>cell into and around the cells that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called ectopic fat and it starts going</p>
<p>in the liver and your pancreas that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when the insulin resistance becomes more</p>
<p>severe to the point where you then</p>
<p>develop diabetes so it&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>dysfunctional fat cell so how can we</p>
<p>apply this information well let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the ketogenic plan and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going on this low fat low carb diet and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of insulin</p>
<p>resistance and someone tells you oh you</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>um consume more fat so that way you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;ll help you</p>
<p>um well the problem is your fat cells</p>
<p>are already filled up so it probably is</p>
<p>not a good thing to start drinking</p>
<p>gobs the fat I mean just eat the protein</p>
<p>that normally comes with the fat but</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t add extra fat unless you need to</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>but also don&rsquo;t go on the low fat diet at</p>
<p>the same time there are certain</p>
<p>ketogenic plan programs out there like</p>
<p>one is ideal protein that they</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s low carb</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s low fat</p>
<p>and protein I think it&rsquo;s maybe a</p>
<p>moderate protein</p>
<p>the problem with that is they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>the type of protein you&rsquo;re using is a is</p>
<p>like low quality soy protein isolates</p>
<p>like these packaged foods with really</p>
<p>crappy ingredients but they have very</p>
<p>low fat so I don&rsquo;t recommend that</p>
<p>because that you end up you might end up</p>
<p>losing weight but I&rsquo;ve noticed people</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t look good when they lose</p>
<p>weight probably because they&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>very dirty version of Keto without</p>
<p>high quality proteins</p>
<p>okay well let&rsquo;s do a quick assessment of</p>
<p>our audience so it&rsquo;s quiz question</p>
<p>number two seventy percent I said it was</p>
<p>true and they were correct now 30</p>
<p>percent were wrong however it takes a</p>
<p>lot of courage to be an outlier and go</p>
<p>against the uh you know go against the</p>
<p>stream so good for you all for trying</p>
<p>out there and we&rsquo;re going to let</p>
<p>everyone have an opportunity to correct</p>
<p>this percentage with the next question</p>
<p>which is also a true falcer and here it</p>
<p>is Doc</p>
<p>Okay so</p>
<p>to stimulate deeper ketosis</p>
<p>just add more fat to your diet</p>
<p>true or false</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good now let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Facebook</p>
<p>Carrie uh from Facebook what is the best</p>
<p>time to take apple cider vinegar and</p>
<p>lemon an hour before a meal or two hours</p>
<p>after question mark trying to avoid</p>
<p>making my stomach too alkaline</p>
<p>well apple cider vinegar will acidify</p>
<p>you so you just take it right before you</p>
<p>eat that would be good but you can also</p>
<p>realize you&rsquo;re not taking it straight</p>
<p>you want to dilute it so you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be um</p>
<p>you know adding it with water</p>
<p>so um I mean like a couple tablespoons</p>
<p>in a glass of water so it&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>be like straight</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>that upside of vinegar right before you</p>
<p>eat will be a good thing but some people</p>
<p>do it early in the morning</p>
<p>like I do it and I also you can actually</p>
<p>even do it right before you go to bed</p>
<p>but that um</p>
<p>the opposite of vinegar will help</p>
<p>digestion but it goes beyond that it</p>
<p>actually can act to help increase energy</p>
<p>it greatly improves your blood sugars</p>
<p>because it targets insulin resistance it</p>
<p>makes the glucose more sensitive it does</p>
<p>a lot so um I&rsquo;m all for apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but uh the one that um</p>
<p>when you look at the label when you buy</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar um apparently the</p>
<p>brags which you know the original</p>
<p>company got bought out by another</p>
<p>company they start to dilute their</p>
<p>opposite of vinegar with water so</p>
<p>is that a problem that&rsquo;s not a problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;re buying something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s diluted and you know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>with water so and then they charge the</p>
<p>same price so anyway I would find</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s just like regular</p>
<p>concentrated just apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>organic and nothing else that would be</p>
<p>the ideal</p>
<p>um apple cider vinegar that I would</p>
<p>recommend very good by the way uh you</p>
<p>know Emmylou Harris was an absolutely is</p>
<p>a beautiful was a beautiful girl</p>
<p>beautiful woman and her hair turned gray</p>
<p>at about 22. it&rsquo;s fascinating I think</p>
<p>she died but anyway the person asked</p>
<p>that question you&rsquo;re from good lineage</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just absolutely gorgeous and now</p>
<p>sports are great here in a great way</p>
<p>still long so no worries you know I</p>
<p>forgot I forgot one thing that causes</p>
<p>graying uh Steve and that&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>old age</p>
<p>for some reason you had to pick on me</p>
<p>the hair color</p>
<p>all right well that&rsquo;s all right I had my</p>
<p>time in the sun all right let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um quiz question number three believe it</p>
<p>or not is already answered another true</p>
<p>falser let&rsquo;s see how they did uh and the</p>
<p>question asked true false to stimulate</p>
<p>deeper ketosis add more fat to your diet</p>
<p>uh and 65 of our uh respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true and the other 35 percent may be the</p>
<p>same one say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s false because adding more</p>
<p>fat is not going to trigger more ketosis</p>
<p>what triggers ketosis is the reduction</p>
<p>of carbohydrates</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re struggling to lose weight</p>
<p>um adding more fat is not going to help</p>
<p>you too you want to get deeper into</p>
<p>ketosis so if you drop the extra added</p>
<p>fat like in the Bulletproof Coffee and</p>
<p>the MCT oil and all these other things</p>
<p>like in the fat bombs and all this extra</p>
<p>fat that people</p>
<p>tend to eat when they think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the right thing then it forces</p>
<p>your body to go after your own fat</p>
<p>reserves so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s one thing to look at</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;re consuming too</p>
<p>much fat on this plan uh it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>unlimited fat it&rsquo;s a lot of that fat</p>
<p>does turn into fat cells uh especially</p>
<p>if you are not burning it off so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just pointing that out for those people</p>
<p>who are kind of like stuck and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wondering why aren&rsquo;t I losing more</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>Facebook again this time with Miriam and</p>
<p>she wants to know what books you are</p>
<p>reading to keep your research current</p>
<p>unless that&rsquo;s a trade secret</p>
<p>uh well it&rsquo;s not a tracing I&rsquo;m reading</p>
<p>recently I&rsquo;m reading this uh this one</p>
<p>right here it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>radical mycology now you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>going what the heck is that this is the</p>
<p>treaties on seeing and working with</p>
<p>fungi It&rsquo;s the Most Fascinating book I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even put it down it&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>um this Hidden World of fungus and the</p>
<p>amazing amazing under appreciated</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>living culture that is one of the it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing that breaks everything down in</p>
<p>the soil and it&rsquo;s essential for plants</p>
<p>to get their nutrients fascinating book</p>
<p>um and now I&rsquo;m looking at the uh the</p>
<p>nutrient levels</p>
<p>and fungus especially mushrooms I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>blown away like vitamin D and uh vitamin</p>
<p>beta-carotene and phytonutrients I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating topic and there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a lot of data on this but this book is</p>
<p>quite fascinating so I I just can&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>it down that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m reading</p>
<p>lately Steve oh that&rsquo;s interesting you</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of hanging</p>
<p>out with Dr Berg uh in his office and</p>
<p>areas several times and he has these</p>
<p>expensive medical journals and stuff I</p>
<p>could buy two flat screens a year for</p>
<p>what he he unloads for these various</p>
<p>things so he&rsquo;s very serious about him</p>
<p>many of the mainstream medical journals</p>
<p>I mean he deals and unfortunately a lot</p>
<p>of the textbooks that</p>
<p>that I need are just crazy expensive but</p>
<p>of course I have to get them because I</p>
<p>need to need need to know everything</p>
<p>about certain topics but yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s um I don&rsquo;t know why they</p>
<p>charge so well I know how they charge</p>
<p>because no one no one really buys those</p>
<p>books so the few that they do sell they</p>
<p>have to</p>
<p>pay for the cost of the production so</p>
<p>well we uh all appreciate your sacrifice</p>
<p>Dr Berg it leads to better counsel I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure okay uh quinoa from Facebook my</p>
<p>headaches get worse when I&rsquo;m on keto</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried electrolytes and minerals but</p>
<p>nothing seems to work what&rsquo;s going on in</p>
<p>Dr Berg is keto no good after all</p>
<p>so are you saying your electrolytes are</p>
<p>are off and or she&rsquo;s tried electrolytes</p>
<p>I guess and minerals but nothing seems</p>
<p>to work</p>
<p>well with with okay but what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the symptom did she mention that oh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry headaches she&rsquo;s and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting worse while she&rsquo;s on keto oh oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s salt salt she needs salt that will</p>
<p>handle it</p>
<p>salt is what you need um which is one</p>
<p>electrolytes but in my powder I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of it but you just add more</p>
<p>sea salt and your headaches will go away</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you that in writing and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>put a guarantee on it all right</p>
<p>wonderful okay you know we we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>hitting Facebook a lot this morning and</p>
<p>we should because sometimes they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not as responsive but let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to</p>
<p>um YouTube because we love all of them</p>
<p>too Afrin from YouTube please discuss</p>
<p>the health benefits of taking sea moss</p>
<p>CMOS is equivalent to sea kelp or</p>
<p>seaweed and you get all these wonderful</p>
<p>ocean minerals to trace minerals</p>
<p>so you get that and you also get amino</p>
<p>acids in there but and some B vitamins</p>
<p>but but mainly the trace minerals in the</p>
<p>in the right form so you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the iodine the zinc the selenium</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s wonderful</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t get a lot of these trace</p>
<p>minerals in our Foods unless you consume</p>
<p>foods from the ocean or near the</p>
<p>coastline so I think it&rsquo;s important to</p>
<p>eat more shellfish sea or uh seafood and</p>
<p>or sea kelp or CMOS</p>
<p>excellent okay let&rsquo;s go all the way to</p>
<p>Qatar</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to speak with a very</p>
<p>nice young lady Angie who is on with us</p>
<p>and I better unmute her so we can hear</p>
<p>what she has to say Angie you are on</p>
<p>with Dr Berg with your one question go</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s muted unmute yourself dear</p>
<p>I see a red mute button on her yeah</p>
<p>I mean audience we&rsquo;d like you to imagine</p>
<p>what Angie has to say while she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working on that</p>
<p>okay Kenji it should be on the left</p>
<p>lower corner of your screen</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something blocking your your</p>
<p>yeah you want I mean and Dr Burke sees</p>
<p>the mute thing on so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s um hard evidence I do at Angie I</p>
<p>want you to work on that for a little</p>
<p>bit we&rsquo;re not going to forget you but</p>
<p>please look and then worst case scenario</p>
<p>she can type a question in the chat but</p>
<p>um yeah but we want to we want to hear</p>
<p>so keep looking for that uh Angie we</p>
<p>will come back to you so stand by all</p>
<p>right in the meantime let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>another question which Angie&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>legal for her to</p>
<p>um write an answer another true false</p>
<p>sir oh no no wrong excuse me Dr Burke</p>
<p>let me delete that we just did it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not another true false sir it&rsquo;s this one</p>
<p>okay good which amino acid quickly</p>
<p>eliminates the craving for alcohol</p>
<p>who wants to get rid of the craving for</p>
<p>alcohol well whoever does let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get you on that audience there are some</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>um and this is a very dramatic in the</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>um very quickly and um</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see what you guys have to say</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a it&rsquo;s a single amino acid</p>
<p>all right well utotlers can relax on</p>
<p>this one but everyone else I dig in</p>
<p>there and let&rsquo;s see if we can find a</p>
<p>remedy uh I was going to say a brand of</p>
<p>beer but I&rsquo;m not going to do it all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s um let&rsquo;s go on</p>
<p>from there uh</p>
<p>wanted fragile is the handle of this</p>
<p>person uh can I get just 12 hours and</p>
<p>still get the benefits of HGH growth I</p>
<p>am underweight team can I fast I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>can I fast for just 12 hours and get um</p>
<p>you know those great benefits</p>
<p>not not too much that&rsquo;s a very low level</p>
<p>fasting time period so you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>not going to get a lot of benefits from</p>
<p>from that specific fast now if you</p>
<p>exercise you&rsquo;ll get benefits from growth</p>
<p>hormone especially if you do high</p>
<p>intensity Level Training</p>
<p>um if you eat on low carb you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>benefits because sugar</p>
<p>to lower growth hormone</p>
<p>um so these are just things I would look</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>um the other thing about</p>
<p>growth hormone is the quality of sleep</p>
<p>if you have low stress you have more</p>
<p>growth hormone because it occurs at</p>
<p>night because that&rsquo;s when all the</p>
<p>recovery occurs</p>
<p>um now if let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>young person and you&rsquo;re of a short</p>
<p>stature you want to increase your growth</p>
<p>you want to get taller</p>
<p>um in practice</p>
<p>I swear this worked great for those</p>
<p>smaller kids that wanted to just boost</p>
<p>their growth I recommend standard</p>
<p>process is called pituitrophin PMG it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a cystic glandular extract it has no</p>
<p>hormones in it</p>
<p>but it supports the pituitary and I</p>
<p>swear every time I gave that to someone</p>
<p>who is just not growing as fast they</p>
<p>would just shoot up I mean dramatically</p>
<p>within days I&rsquo;m being sarcastic but uh</p>
<p>definitely it it was quite interesting</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not making any claims Steve okay</p>
<p>all right uh hang in there short people</p>
<p>Angie how you doing are you able to get</p>
<p>rid of the mute button once you chat</p>
<p>with me for a second let me see if we</p>
<p>can hear you oh wonderful I can&rsquo;t stand</p>
<p>by Angie you are finally being</p>
<p>recognized with your one question in 30</p>
<p>seconds for Dr Burke</p>
<p>hi doctor so I have a bloating issue</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>um in the morning so I work out so in</p>
<p>the morning I have a flat stomach but</p>
<p>then as soon as I consume even a small</p>
<p>amount of water I start bloating and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a normal bloating it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>um large amount of bloating that goes on</p>
<p>throughout the day and then the next</p>
<p>morning it&rsquo;s gone again</p>
<p>um and I&rsquo;ve had it for a while I just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t notice until I started working</p>
<p>out a year ago</p>
<p>um so yeah</p>
<p>so um question I have for you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>college is stress level</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m pretty fine I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really stress much yeah</p>
<p>okay good do you get any Vitamin D from</p>
<p>the Sun</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>okay good do you um do you get more</p>
<p>bloated when you have salads and and uh</p>
<p>vegetables and plants</p>
<p>um no I think it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>when I have</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>gluten like something maybe maybe like</p>
<p>bread but in general it is</p>
<p>um like it it&rsquo;s normally just always</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s always loaded there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of things</p>
<p>um and I&rsquo;m still bloated after eating</p>
<p>but you wake up feeling it but it&rsquo;s flat</p>
<p>when you wake up in the morning yeah and</p>
<p>then as soon as I consume even water</p>
<p>like I just skipped yeah yeah yeah I</p>
<p>think I think the water&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that goes beyond just</p>
<p>the water but</p>
<p>um of course I don&rsquo;t know what kind of</p>
<p>water you&rsquo;re drinking but here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things that I would I would</p>
<p>change around</p>
<p>um I would</p>
<p>implement this thing called it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet have you ever heard</p>
<p>of it before yeah</p>
<p>okay so I would get on that immediately</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say for example you did that</p>
<p>and all of a sudden your stomach went</p>
<p>flat then problem solved because on the</p>
<p>key to the plan there is no gluten</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no grains things like that but</p>
<p>typically the average person that has</p>
<p>bloating boy it&rsquo;s the grains or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some of the beans or whatever so they</p>
<p>have to eliminate that right off the bat</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say for example they get on</p>
<p>keto and they limited all that stuff and</p>
<p>they still have bloating then</p>
<p>um they may have something called small</p>
<p>intestinal bacterial overgrowth which</p>
<p>produces a lot of gas and it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>permanent bloat</p>
<p>that may occur with you in which case</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re gonna have to avoid any and</p>
<p>all fiber for a while uh for a couple</p>
<p>months and go on the carnivore diet</p>
<p>because that fiber feeds the microbes in</p>
<p>your small intestine and you&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>like you have this</p>
<p>this gut you know I mean if you take a</p>
<p>look at horses there&rsquo;s something called</p>
<p>Hay belly and these horses get this ex</p>
<p>accentuated distension of their bellies</p>
<p>um primarily because they&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>too many grains</p>
<p>so this is why let&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>natural for a horse to have like grass</p>
<p>and hay</p>
<p>um versus all these grains so you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a similar thing in humans as well</p>
<p>all right thank you thank you so much</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try that out you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great Angie and thank you for</p>
<p>your concise question I feel a certain</p>
<p>kinship with Angie because I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to have 16 Cherry turnovers I</p>
<p>noticed some bloating</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but yeah all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s move</p>
<p>on now back to um</p>
<p>well how about questions uh and the last</p>
<p>one asked which amino acid eliminates</p>
<p>the craving for alcohol</p>
<p>45 percent of our respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>glutamine 20 say it&rsquo;s Arginine and 20</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s taurine wow oh and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another 10 that say it&rsquo;s Gaba and five</p>
<p>percent say it&rsquo;s tryptophan good for you</p>
<p>audience a lot of research out there are</p>
<p>we onto something doc</p>
<p>we are on something the answer is</p>
<p>glutamine glutamine um</p>
<p>um is fascinating because uh it it can</p>
<p>turn into sugar without the insulin</p>
<p>effects in your brain and and feed your</p>
<p>brain pretty quickly and so it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>for even sugar Cravings</p>
<p>um but of course</p>
<p>if you just do keto that that might</p>
<p>solve your problem but specifically for</p>
<p>alcohol</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you take glutamine it really will</p>
<p>help to um just decrease that craving it</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>um turns into glutamate which is one of</p>
<p>the most abundant neurotransmitters in</p>
<p>your brain so it can greatly affect your</p>
<p>mood especially anxiety depression</p>
<p>things like that so if you think about</p>
<p>even alcohol</p>
<p>why do people drink they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to relieve pressure maybe</p>
<p>stress anxiety they&rsquo;re just there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>impulse to drink just to feel</p>
<p>relief just like you know smoking does</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>um so even though alcohol does reduce</p>
<p>stress it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of a it does it</p>
<p>artificially it&rsquo;s going to add more</p>
<p>stress but the um</p>
<p>the glutamine is a simple no-brainer if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to get off alcohol that is</p>
<p>a really great solution I would</p>
<p>definitely recommend that like two to</p>
<p>five grams per day should handle that</p>
<p>and then get on the Keto Plan it&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>make it easier to make the transition</p>
<p>off alcohol</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very encouraging doc all right</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s wrap things up not the show but</p>
<p>the questions with this last one for the</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>okay so what is the primary reason why</p>
<p>you should eat your greens before your</p>
<p>protein in your meal</p>
<p>interesting climb on it audience and we</p>
<p>are going to continue to put a lot of</p>
<p>love out to social media uh and let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to Michael this time from YouTube my</p>
<p>wife&rsquo;s hands and feet swell after</p>
<p>consuming carbs and especially Chinese</p>
<p>food oops what&rsquo;s the reason behind it</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a lot of sugar which</p>
<p>retains water for every</p>
<p>gram of glucose</p>
<p>your body takes in it has to store three</p>
<p>grams of water</p>
<p>so you can imagine you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>developing a water filled balloon in</p>
<p>your body but not only that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of hidden MSG and certain</p>
<p>fast food restaurants and Chinese</p>
<p>restaurants in America I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;ve never been</p>
<p>to other out of the country and had to</p>
<p>one of those Asian</p>
<p>countries so I don&rsquo;t know about that but</p>
<p>I do know MSG tends to have this a lot</p>
<p>of hidden sodium and it&rsquo;s a fluid</p>
<p>retainer and uh you&rsquo;ll just your fingers</p>
<p>will be swollen</p>
<p>um and you&rsquo;ll have to wait for that to</p>
<p>be released to the body one antidote to</p>
<p>that if you happen to accidentally</p>
<p>someone forces you a gunpoint to eat</p>
<p>some of that MSG</p>
<p>what you can do is an antidote is to</p>
<p>start taking more potassium to offset</p>
<p>that and that will push some of this</p>
<p>fluid out</p>
<p>just the tip Steve all right very good</p>
<p>try to get back with us please Christmas</p>
<p>by the way Steve I just also when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking monosodium sodium glutamate yeah</p>
<p>glutamate we just talked about glutamine</p>
<p>right so um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re deficient in glutamine you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>you make even crave food like with</p>
<p>monosodium glutamate trying to get this</p>
<p>this neurotransmitter but you know your</p>
<p>body has this really cool way of um</p>
<p>balancing out</p>
<p>glutamate which is which is kind of like</p>
<p>a stimulatory thing with with Gaba so it</p>
<p>kind of goes back to Gaba and glutamate</p>
<p>depending what you need so Gaba is</p>
<p>really calming so it&rsquo;s not going to make</p>
<p>things worse by taking glutamine as a as</p>
<p>an amino acid you know I&rsquo;ve always heard</p>
<p>MSG such a big thing with Chinese food</p>
<p>but I must defend them because instead</p>
<p>of a little Corner Carryout perhaps but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of great Chinese</p>
<p>restaurants that just do not include</p>
<p>that in their Preparatory stuff and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just delicious stuff so yeah let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>exactly stand on them too hard okay</p>
<p>Chris May from India on YouTube please</p>
<p>share any information on reducing</p>
<p>prostate swelling</p>
<p>the first thing that pops up is to avoid</p>
<p>any and all dairy products because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s hormones in there that can</p>
<p>influence your prostate the next thing</p>
<p>is to avoid any and all soy products</p>
<p>which could also affect your hormones</p>
<p>so those are the two things I would</p>
<p>recommend I have a lot of videos on this</p>
<p>topic you should um</p>
<p>watch them</p>
<p>um now when someone gets up more than</p>
<p>once a night to urinate they always</p>
<p>think about a prostate enlargement but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another cause to this frequent</p>
<p>urination at night that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessarily involved with prostate and</p>
<p>that has to do with insulin resistance</p>
<p>and this is why getting that on that</p>
<p>really good standard Keto Plan and</p>
<p>avoiding those snacks especially at</p>
<p>night</p>
<p>when a lot of people reach for the</p>
<p>snacks we&rsquo;ll avoid that Spike of insulin</p>
<p>and help you overcome this and if you do</p>
<p>it with good discipline you&rsquo;ll find that</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t get up 10 times a night you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get up less and less to the point where</p>
<p>you can sleep through the entire night</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll give you a guarantee on</p>
<p>that because it definitely works almost</p>
<p>100 of the time wonderful okay as a show</p>
<p>courtesy poor Vena from Alabama has got</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s worst internet connection uh but</p>
<p>and she keeps blocking off let me see if</p>
<p>we can reach Vena can you hear us Veena</p>
<p>trying to get you back on the air here</p>
<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s spinning so she&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have to oh wait there she goes to do it</p>
<p>on the chat oh yeah there she is uh Vina</p>
<p>can you hear us and if so would you go</p>
<p>ahead with your one question please</p>
<p>oh poor thing I tell you what next week</p>
<p>Vina why don&rsquo;t you uh give it a shot</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll keep an eye on her though and if</p>
<p>that uh if that comes about we&rsquo;ll put</p>
<p>you on the air immediately Vena all</p>
<p>right so the final question uh asks what</p>
<p>is the primary reason why you should eat</p>
<p>your greens before your protein</p>
<p>uh and it&rsquo;s no surprise that the</p>
<p>audience had</p>
<p>um an opinion on that fifty percent of</p>
<p>our respondents say greens will reduce a</p>
<p>spike in insulin 30 percent say they</p>
<p>will help optimize digestion 15 say they</p>
<p>will help you feel Fuller and thus eat</p>
<p>less are they under something doc</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not on uh something but they um</p>
<p>they might be onto something that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>correct but here&rsquo;s the thing there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hypothesis called the protein</p>
<p>leverage hypothesis and um</p>
<p>uh in animals and even certain insects</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll keep eating until they get their</p>
<p>protein requirements satisfied and then</p>
<p>the hunger goes away I really think this</p>
<p>applies to humans as well</p>
<p>so if you consume your protein</p>
<p>first you probably are not going to have</p>
<p>the appetite to consume that salad that</p>
<p>you probably don&rsquo;t like in the first</p>
<p>place so get the salad out of the way</p>
<p>first</p>
<p>because you know when I when I um</p>
<p>was a vegan in my 20s I um I tried to do</p>
<p>that and boy I was eating all this these</p>
<p>greens and the plant-based it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>it was really hard to satisfy the</p>
<p>protein requirements so I would eat</p>
<p>massive amounts have all this bloating</p>
<p>and wondering this is not working</p>
<p>um but when I switched over from my</p>
<p>cereal breakfast to a protein breakfast</p>
<p>oh my gosh talk about satisfying brain</p>
<p>health so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you tend to feel that you overeat</p>
<p>um it could be you just don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough</p>
<p>protein and I&rsquo;m talking about the</p>
<p>balance of amino acids to satisfy you</p>
<p>um I even know like with horses that</p>
<p>even develop laminitis which is uh</p>
<p>inflammation in the hoof and uh also</p>
<p>um they have insulin resistance</p>
<p>and they have a lot of other issues a</p>
<p>lot of that is connected to</p>
<p>um trying to get enough protein from the</p>
<p>grass because they&rsquo;re eating all the</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>um and they&rsquo;re just not getting that</p>
<p>protein so I recently found a great that</p>
<p>to supply that protein and so they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>overeat and develop too much carb in</p>
<p>their diet from all the spring grass</p>
<p>but I created a video on that and I will</p>
<p>share that soon very good okay well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s observe a moment of silence for</p>
<p>the audience who I&rsquo;m afraid did not get</p>
<p>this right in any way shape or form but</p>
<p>we love you and know that you will</p>
<p>redeem yourself next week with a fresh</p>
<p>set of questions and you really did very</p>
<p>well today and I&rsquo;d be lying to say that</p>
<p>I knew the answer that too so I join you</p>
<p>in um</p>
<p>a little bit of shame for having not</p>
<p>gotten that question right all right</p>
<p>Sharon from YouTube what can I take to</p>
<p>increase my deep sleep time I only get</p>
<p>about 12 minutes of deep sleep in eight</p>
<p>hours of bedtime oh Sharon</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that can prevent</p>
<p>that from happening</p>
<p>one big one is</p>
<p>um too much light before bed</p>
<p>can affect that we really want to get</p>
<p>your melatonin</p>
<p>you know so the clock in the brain</p>
<p>re-synced and vitamin D in high amounts</p>
<p>a lot of times will reset the biological</p>
<p>clock but when you&rsquo;re sleeping too high</p>
<p>levels of cortisol will bump you out of</p>
<p>that deep Delta wave sleep</p>
<p>um but exercise high intensity interval</p>
<p>training with offset with a good amount</p>
<p>of aerobic type exercise</p>
<p>which which will help you sleep deeper</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something even better than</p>
<p>that if you were to do physical work</p>
<p>around the house or wherever you have a</p>
<p>combination of exercise and really kind</p>
<p>of getting your</p>
<p>attention off problems of life that is a</p>
<p>great way to sleep like a baby now</p>
<p>when you sleep</p>
<p>really focus on nose breathing because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to increase more CO2 which</p>
<p>will allow your oxygen to be released</p>
<p>from your blood now I&rsquo;m not just talking</p>
<p>about saturation of oxygen in your blood</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about that next step further</p>
<p>where the oxygen goes into the cells so</p>
<p>you need CO2</p>
<p>so breathing through your nose will help</p>
<p>increase more oxygen through the CO2 and</p>
<p>then focusing on your a nice even breath</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>breathing out if you can keep your</p>
<p>window open that will help</p>
<p>but I have a lot of videos on sleep that</p>
<p>can tweak things so you can get this</p>
<p>deep Delta wave sleep that you</p>
<p>desperately need yeah well that was a a</p>
<p>fascinating thing you told us a couple</p>
<p>weeks ago I think where you explained</p>
<p>that hyperventilating it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>counter-intuitive that you smack your</p>
<p>face into a bag and keep yourself</p>
<p>seemingly from getting more oxygen but</p>
<p>you explain the CO2 is a catalyst for</p>
<p>helping you get that oxygen and absorbed</p>
<p>do I have that right because that is</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s called the bore effect Bo</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>HR and um it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s an effect that it</p>
<p>happens uh in relationship to</p>
<p>getting oxygen and um it might sound</p>
<p>counter and contrainable because we</p>
<p>think that CO2 is just a waste product</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a necessary thing to help you</p>
<p>pull in oxygen and um</p>
<p>so I mean you even think about</p>
<p>um when you exercise if you could try to</p>
<p>do some of that through the nose I know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some it&rsquo;s Hospital impossible if</p>
<p>you really do high intensity you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that you can go further</p>
<p>because it allows you to get more O2</p>
<p>into the tissues and prevent this what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called hypoxia so I&rsquo;ve tried it and uh</p>
<p>it does work I can go longer if I</p>
<p>breathe through my nose it might seem</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m restricting air but I I&rsquo;m able</p>
<p>to do it and so it&rsquo;s pretty interesting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh especially if you have any type</p>
<p>of asthma or panic attacks or uh or</p>
<p>anxiety you should be starting to</p>
<p>breathe through your nose immediately</p>
<p>through the day</p>
<p>and slow down your breath in and out and</p>
<p>that will turn things around pretty</p>
<p>quick for you wow you know interestingly</p>
<p>my wife Lori hyperventilates at the end</p>
<p>of the month if she doesn&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>earned enough for the family so I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have to remember to keep a brown bag</p>
<p>handy I have to get her through that uh</p>
<p>monthly yes get more carbon dioxide and</p>
<p>more jobs and more jobs yeah for</p>
<p>goodness sakes yeah get more jobs give</p>
<p>her another job all right well here&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>bibla who from YouTube will black pepper</p>
<p>help absorption of certain nutrients</p>
<p>yeah black pepper and even white pepper</p>
<p>can increase the absorption of certain</p>
<p>phytonutrients like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>curcumin for example and other ones as</p>
<p>well so that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll usually</p>
<p>see uh turmeric or curcumin with that</p>
<p>black pepper so uh</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>even if you take that sulforaphane</p>
<p>molecule that we talked about if you add</p>
<p>you can add something else to spike the</p>
<p>potency of it and that would be mustard</p>
<p>seed</p>
<p>so um there&rsquo;s a lot of cool things you</p>
<p>can mix together that I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>interested in now and I&rsquo;m doing um all</p>
<p>sorts of deep dives into how do we like</p>
<p>enhance these nutrients so we can be</p>
<p>healthier so I have a lot of research</p>
<p>coming down the pike I did a experiment</p>
<p>on any broccoli Sprouts recently and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share the results but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re gonna have a meeting and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to redo it</p>
<p>um because there was a couple glitches</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very high interest to me and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do more research on that all right</p>
<p>wonderful well here&rsquo;s some good and bad</p>
<p>news Syed from Facebook I suffer from</p>
<p>GERD I take apple cider vinegar betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride and zinc and the symptoms</p>
<p>disappeared about 90 however now the</p>
<p>problem is when I have any kind of fiber</p>
<p>after taking these supplements I have</p>
<p>symptoms of diarrhea</p>
<p>yeah I think you if you had gerd okay</p>
<p>which means you didn&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>stomach acid chances are</p>
<p>um you were not able to kill off all the</p>
<p>microbes while you&rsquo;re eating into the so</p>
<p>you could actually kind of prevent this</p>
<p>other condition from happening called</p>
<p>small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</p>
<p>sibo</p>
<p>so you may still have some of that with</p>
<p>even some alteration of the microbes in</p>
<p>your large intestine so I think uh you</p>
<p>may be benefit from like a more</p>
<p>carnivore for a while so you can kind of</p>
<p>reset that and the way that you&rsquo;ll know</p>
<p>is that when you reduce fiber in</p>
<p>probiotics you feel better</p>
<p>then we know okay think sibo</p>
<p>um so just try that</p>
<p>see if it doesn&rsquo;t help you very good all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s see Donna from Facebook what</p>
<p>are your thoughts about taking colloidal</p>
<p>silver to treat ulcers my aunt has had</p>
<p>Success With It</p>
<p>colloidal silver is great for um</p>
<p>anything involving</p>
<p>microbes or pathogens and since there</p>
<p>are pathogens involved with ulcers that</p>
<p>would be a good remedy to take I like</p>
<p>colloidal silver for many different</p>
<p>things especially for kids it seems you</p>
<p>can even put</p>
<p>um some diluted silver nitrate even in</p>
<p>your eyes for a certain type of</p>
<p>infections but there&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s a long</p>
<p>history of it of course you can patent</p>
<p>it so you&rsquo;re not going to probably get</p>
<p>this recommendation on mainstream</p>
<p>medicine they&rsquo;re probably going to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a voodoo stay away from it stick</p>
<p>with your medications because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where all the Sciences but um</p>
<p>anyway I would um I would look into it</p>
<p>and because it has a lot less side</p>
<p>effects</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see did we</p>
<p>talk about Chris naves from India about</p>
<p>any information on reducing prostate</p>
<p>swelling I don&rsquo;t think I did yeah we did</p>
<p>talk about prostate enlargement already</p>
<p>all right very good well there&rsquo;s a re</p>
<p>brief reminder of that let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>colloidal silver just did that you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having such a great time with</p>
<p>social media because we were a little</p>
<p>slaw a little Slim in The Green Room uh</p>
<p>we talked about uh oh here we go</p>
<p>Jacqueline from Facebook I have</p>
<p>throbbing pain on my right side and</p>
<p>lower back pain could this be a kidney</p>
<p>stone</p>
<p>ouch</p>
<p>it can be a kidney stone it could be a</p>
<p>gallstone okay it could be a gallstone</p>
<p>it really depends on where that</p>
<p>throbbing is is it in your abdomen is it</p>
<p>in the back part where the kidney is a</p>
<p>little higher up in the lower back or is</p>
<p>it maybe down your leg as a sciatica so</p>
<p>um you just have to understand where the</p>
<p>structures are and how they can affect</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>these different type of pain syndromes</p>
<p>but I will say this uh gallstone and a</p>
<p>kidney stone can be so similar in</p>
<p>symptoms it&rsquo;s hard to differentiate one</p>
<p>from the other</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you need an ultrasound</p>
<p>wow well good luck to you because uh</p>
<p>kidney stones as I understand never had</p>
<p>one or no fun A friend of mine I took to</p>
<p>the hospital because he was just out of</p>
<p>it from that pain and the nurse said</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s had she would rather have two</p>
<p>babies at once than suffer that pain</p>
<p>again she&rsquo;d had them so I understand</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awful so anyway let&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>encourage our audience quickly that uh</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re out of the country which the</p>
<p>vast majority appear to be that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hope for uh continued efforts to get</p>
<p>um you know stuff products delivered to</p>
<p>you uh so that&rsquo;s well we just we just</p>
<p>got into India so now we have uh access</p>
<p>to uh getting new products in India and</p>
<p>I will put a link down below uh at some</p>
<p>point today so that way those people in</p>
<p>India can get some products at a less</p>
<p>lesser shipping cost</p>
<p>wonderful</p>
<p>well doc I think the club on that note</p>
<p>Steve</p>
<p>um I just want to thank everyone for</p>
<p>your wonderful attention and sticking</p>
<p>around for this this long</p>
<p>um stay tuned for some</p>
<p>more videos on very interesting topics I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing these topics on things that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really interested in and I think you</p>
<p>will be too so stay tuned for more and</p>
<p>have a wonderful weekend</p>
