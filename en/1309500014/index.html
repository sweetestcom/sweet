    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>hi guys how are you</p>
<p>today I hope you are having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Sarian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s Murder Mystery and Makeup Monday</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my intro song</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all I got anyways if you are new here</p>
<p>every Monday I upload a</p>
<p>video where I sit down I do my makeup and I talk</p>
<p>about a true</p>
<p>crime story or</p>
<p>true crime case that has been heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and I do my makeup</p>
<p>because it just keeps me busy it&rsquo;s a 2 for one makeup</p>
<p>true crime it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here we&rsquo;re doing it so I was</p>
<p>going down the</p>
<p>comment section and I was like reading all your guys</p>
<p>recommendations and I want to</p>
<p>shout out Lindsay Mccord who</p>
<p>has commented</p>
<p>and recommended this case a couple of times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of your comments girl</p>
<p>shout out to you</p>
<p>so she recommended this case in the</p>
<p>story and I hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard about it so I went looking</p>
<p>okay and let me just tell you that my Google history</p>
<p>is questionable all right</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably like a red flag on it anyways</p>
<p>so I was looking up this case</p>
<p>never heard of it and I was like boy this case is awful</p>
<p>so warning the following presentation is intended for</p>
<p>mature audiences</p>
<p>it contains</p>
<p>graphic descriptions of</p>
<p>crime scenes</p>
<p>adult dialogue and</p>
<p>strong language</p>
<p>viewer discretion is advised</p>
<p>so today I want to talk about</p>
<p>Casey Joe Stodart</p>
<p>Casey was born on December 21st</p>
<p>1989 she had</p>
<p>2 siblings a younger brother and an</p>
<p>older sister</p>
<p>and they lived in</p>
<p>Pocatello pocatello Idaho</p>
<p>pocatello Idaho is like</p>
<p>mainly a Mormon town in</p>
<p>southeast Idaho</p>
<p>not that that&rsquo;s bad or anything</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;m getting at is that it&rsquo;s like very simple</p>
<p>felt very safe everybody</p>
<p>kind of minded</p>
<p>their own most of her</p>
<p>childhood Cassie</p>
<p>she and her brother</p>
<p>lived with her</p>
<p>grandparents</p>
<p>they still remained really</p>
<p>close to their</p>
<p>mother I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>exactly sure</p>
<p>like why they were staying with</p>
<p>their grandparents and not their mom</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it really matters</p>
<p>cause it doesn&rsquo;t play a role in</p>
<p>what could have happened in the fall of 2006</p>
<p>Cassie was a 16 years old she was a junior in high</p>
<p>school she had a boyfriend his name was Matt</p>
<p>and they went to</p>
<p>school together they have been together</p>
<p>at that point for</p>
<p>about 5 months they</p>
<p>spent a lot of</p>
<p>their time at cassie&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smiling because I can&rsquo;t seem to get cassie&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>right I keep on to say</p>
<p>Casey what the fuck is my problem</p>
<p>sorry so both of them</p>
<p>would spend a lot of time together</p>
<p>hanging out at cassie&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>yeah I mean they&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>young and in love you know</p>
<p>you know how that goes</p>
<p>back in high school</p>
<p>Cassie was determined</p>
<p>to buy her own car so during the summer she</p>
<p>would babysit</p>
<p>and she just</p>
<p>kind of wanted to show that she was responsible</p>
<p>Cassie her uncle and aunt they</p>
<p>lived pretty close by</p>
<p>and she had cousins and</p>
<p>she would go over and babysit</p>
<p>her younger cousins</p>
<p>make some extra</p>
<p>money there as well</p>
<p>she was saving her</p>
<p>money because she wanted to get her own car</p>
<p>you know most 16 year olds</p>
<p>wanna get their own car</p>
<p>so when she had the opportunity to house sit</p>
<p>for her Uncle</p>
<p>Frank and her Aunt</p>
<p>Allison they</p>
<p>asked her if she</p>
<p>would house it because they were</p>
<p>going out of town the</p>
<p>whole family was</p>
<p>going out of town for something</p>
<p>and they were wondering if Cassie</p>
<p>could just watch the</p>
<p>house and also the animals</p>
<p>so Cassie said like</p>
<p>yeah first of all she&rsquo;d get to hang out at this big old</p>
<p>house by herself</p>
<p>and make some extra</p>
<p>money Cassie</p>
<p>really wanted to</p>
<p>prove that she was responsible and she</p>
<p>could like take this on</p>
<p>so this is a perfect opportunity</p>
<p>the weekend of September 20th</p>
<p>Cassie her mom</p>
<p>drove her up to the</p>
<p>house and it was on</p>
<p>Whispering Cliffs</p>
<p>drive which is</p>
<p>already in itself</p>
<p>uncomfortable it was in a remote area and there</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t many</p>
<p>other houses like super</p>
<p>close by they were neighbors but</p>
<p>it was kind of a mission to get there</p>
<p>the house is</p>
<p>it was pretty</p>
<p>large and if you know you&rsquo;re left in it</p>
<p>alone it could be kind of</p>
<p>spooky when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>alone but she was mainly there to take care of and</p>
<p>watch and feed</p>
<p>the 3 cats and 2 dogs</p>
<p>while the family was away</p>
<p>so Cassie asked</p>
<p>her Aunt Allison if it was okay that her boyfriend</p>
<p>Matt came over and hung out with her Cassie was</p>
<p>a good kid she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink she didn&rsquo;t use drugs</p>
<p>she was a straight A student she was responsible</p>
<p>and they knew</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have anything to worry</p>
<p>about she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna throw a</p>
<p>house party or something</p>
<p>so yes they said her boyfriend</p>
<p>could come over like no problem</p>
<p>so Matt came over that</p>
<p>night it was Friday</p>
<p>night Cassie and Matt</p>
<p>were at the</p>
<p>home and they were just hanging out they were</p>
<p>watching a movie or they were</p>
<p>going to watch a movie</p>
<p>so Matt invited</p>
<p>his 2 friends over</p>
<p>Brian and Tori</p>
<p>so the 2 boys came over and they decided to have a</p>
<p>movie night</p>
<p>they were all</p>
<p>somewhat friends they all</p>
<p>went to the same high</p>
<p>school together</p>
<p>but they all knew each</p>
<p>other they all hung out</p>
<p>Cassie wasn&rsquo;t really too</p>
<p>happy about it</p>
<p>because she only</p>
<p>asked her aunt</p>
<p>if Matt could come over</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t ask if</p>
<p>these other people</p>
<p>could come over so she was a little</p>
<p>upset with Matt</p>
<p>like why are you just trying to invite all</p>
<p>these random ass people over</p>
<p>I only asked if you can come over</p>
<p>so Matt assured her that it&rsquo;s fine like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna hang out we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna watch a</p>
<p>movie we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do anything crazy</p>
<p>so all the guys and Cassie are hanging out at the</p>
<p>house they start to</p>
<p>watch a movie</p>
<p>and Tori and Brian</p>
<p>they say like</p>
<p>this is lame</p>
<p>we thought it was gonna be a</p>
<p>party here there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>party going on</p>
<p>and that they</p>
<p>would rather just go</p>
<p>watch a movie like at the</p>
<p>movie theater</p>
<p>so Tori and Brian tell</p>
<p>Cassie and Matt</p>
<p>that they are</p>
<p>gonna go to the</p>
<p>movies instead and</p>
<p>watch something that&rsquo;s out in the theater</p>
<p>so they take off Cassie was a little</p>
<p>excited because</p>
<p>I mean she&rsquo;d rather hang out with her boyfriend</p>
<p>alone at the house</p>
<p>about 15 minutes</p>
<p>after Tori and</p>
<p>Brian left the</p>
<p>power at the house</p>
<p>while Cassie and Matt were</p>
<p>watching a movie</p>
<p>it went out</p>
<p>the power just</p>
<p>completely went out</p>
<p>so Cassie is</p>
<p>super freaked out she&rsquo;s feeling really uneasy</p>
<p>it just scared I mean</p>
<p>I would be too because I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>bitch I don&rsquo;t like the dark I&rsquo;m scared</p>
<p>but she is 16 too</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s scared</p>
<p>instead of like</p>
<p>trying to find the circuit box or anything they just</p>
<p>decide to like</p>
<p>stay in the living room okay just wait it out the</p>
<p>power is out</p>
<p>no big deal</p>
<p>matt the boyfriend he was trying to calm</p>
<p>Cassie down</p>
<p>and let her know like it&rsquo;s fine it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the power is out like not a big deal</p>
<p>after a few minutes</p>
<p>some of the</p>
<p>power comes on</p>
<p>like back on but not</p>
<p>all of it so like half of the</p>
<p>lights come back on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit better like okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as dark and</p>
<p>scary anymore</p>
<p>and at that time</p>
<p>Matt had called his mom and</p>
<p>asked for permission</p>
<p>to stay the</p>
<p>night with Cassie</p>
<p>and he wanted to stay because</p>
<p>she was afraid to be by herself</p>
<p>alone in the</p>
<p>house she just wanted him to stay</p>
<p>matt&rsquo;s mom said</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re 16 years old you are not gonna stay</p>
<p>alone with your</p>
<p>girlfriend in this house</p>
<p>according to Matt</p>
<p>one of the dogs that was in the</p>
<p>house he this dog was hanging out in</p>
<p>front of the basement</p>
<p>stairs which were in the</p>
<p>kitchen and this dog was just staring</p>
<p>like at the</p>
<p>stairs and he was just barking</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would come back to the living room</p>
<p>to where Matt</p>
<p>and Cassie were at</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would go back to barking</p>
<p>matt said that this made him feel</p>
<p>uncomfortable but like</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think to investigate further</p>
<p>or maybe he was too afraid to investigate further</p>
<p>so at 11 pm</p>
<p>matt&rsquo;s mom came and picked him up at the home he</p>
<p>asked his mom one more time if</p>
<p>he could stay the</p>
<p>night with Cassie</p>
<p>he explained like the</p>
<p>lights were</p>
<p>going off and she&rsquo;s just feeling scared can I</p>
<p>stay with her</p>
<p>and matt&rsquo;s mom said</p>
<p>no but she said Cassie</p>
<p>could come and stay the</p>
<p>night at our</p>
<p>house drive her back in the morning</p>
<p>and be fine</p>
<p>so Matt uh went</p>
<p>to Cassie and said hey</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>wanna stay the</p>
<p>night at my</p>
<p>house my mom said like that</p>
<p>would be okay Cassie declined</p>
<p>she said that it was her</p>
<p>responsibility to stay home well stay at the house to</p>
<p>watch the animals</p>
<p>she was being paid to</p>
<p>house it so</p>
<p>she felt like she needed to do that like that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>she promised she would do</p>
<p>so she said no it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be fine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a big deal</p>
<p>a few minutes later</p>
<p>after Matt has left</p>
<p>Cassie just goes back into the home she&rsquo;s laying on the</p>
<p>couch she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna have her own little like her own little</p>
<p>movie night</p>
<p>by herself and then the</p>
<p>lights in the home they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>flickering on and off again</p>
<p>then they eventually just go out completely</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s feeling scared obviously instead of</p>
<p>getting up and investigating she&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna sit here on the living room</p>
<p>couch like I don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>so 2 days later Cassie her aunt and</p>
<p>uncle and her cousin they come home from their</p>
<p>Cassie her 13 year old cousin</p>
<p>went into the home</p>
<p>first she knows that the door was unlocked</p>
<p>which was really</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>the door is usually always locked</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t it was open so she&rsquo;s like okay this is</p>
<p>weird so she walks into the house</p>
<p>and then she walks into the living room</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where she found a</p>
<p>Cassie stabbed to</p>
<p>death in a pool of</p>
<p>blood in the living room</p>
<p>on the floor</p>
<p>she screamed</p>
<p>her family came in</p>
<p>you know once she</p>
<p>heard her screaming</p>
<p>and they all</p>
<p>just like lost it and they called the police</p>
<p>and police investigators came out to the home</p>
<p>so the county</p>
<p>sheriff&rsquo;s office they actually put the family up in a</p>
<p>hotel for like 2 weeks during the investigation</p>
<p>investigators had determined</p>
<p>Cassie had been there for</p>
<p>a few days like this wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>something that just happened</p>
<p>they also determined that</p>
<p>it was not a robbery because nothing from the home was</p>
<p>taken all of</p>
<p>their expensive like jewelry</p>
<p>their TVs their DVD players they were all</p>
<p>still like in the home</p>
<p>everything left</p>
<p>undisturbed like nothing</p>
<p>shuffled through</p>
<p>so there were no signs of 4th century</p>
<p>and they believed that whoever came into the home</p>
<p>Cassie she must have like</p>
<p>known them or let them in willingly</p>
<p>or it was just someone that was familiar with the house</p>
<p>so later the autopsy revealed that Cassie had been</p>
<p>stabbed approximately 30 times</p>
<p>with 9 to 12 of</p>
<p>those being fatal</p>
<p>so it seemed a very personal attack</p>
<p>by someone that</p>
<p>knew her or someone that was just really</p>
<p>close to her so first</p>
<p>investigators went to go see</p>
<p>cassie&rsquo;s boyfriend</p>
<p>matt since he was the last person to see her</p>
<p>it was her boyfriend so</p>
<p>right off the bat they thought</p>
<p>Matt was super suspicious</p>
<p>because when they were asking him questions</p>
<p>about Cassie he didn&rsquo;t show any emotion</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t cry didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily seem like too</p>
<p>shocked it was just</p>
<p>nothing it was just blank</p>
<p>so they just thought it was</p>
<p>very strange that Matt didn&rsquo;t show any type of emotion</p>
<p>especially because of like</p>
<p>how horrifying the</p>
<p>whole situation</p>
<p>scene was I mean it was</p>
<p>also his girlfriend and also because I mean</p>
<p>he was at the</p>
<p>house if he were</p>
<p>still there</p>
<p>it could have been him too</p>
<p>so they just expected</p>
<p>a little bit more from that suspicious</p>
<p>keep an eye on him</p>
<p>so investigators</p>
<p>ask Matt like okay well tell us what happened that</p>
<p>night did they get into a</p>
<p>fight was anybody else there</p>
<p>trying to see if Matt</p>
<p>could potentially</p>
<p>point them in the</p>
<p>right direction</p>
<p>so Matt he explained that</p>
<p>the last people they were around were Tori and Brian</p>
<p>they had left</p>
<p>early to go see a movie</p>
<p>matt also said that when he left the house</p>
<p>he called Tori to see</p>
<p>where they were</p>
<p>and he could barely hear them because he was in a</p>
<p>movie and he was like trying to</p>
<p>whisper on the</p>
<p>phone apparently Matt was</p>
<p>reaching out to let him know that he was leaving the</p>
<p>house so that they</p>
<p>could all hang out somewhere else</p>
<p>the next day</p>
<p>Matt says that him and Tori hung out at matt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and that Matt</p>
<p>tried to call Cassie</p>
<p>the whole weekend</p>
<p>but he could not get</p>
<p>a hold of her</p>
<p>so then investigators know okay now we have to question</p>
<p>Brian and Tori figure out</p>
<p>who they were</p>
<p>their story</p>
<p>they learned that both</p>
<p>Brian and Tori they</p>
<p>loved making</p>
<p>movies they</p>
<p>would constantly</p>
<p>film themselves</p>
<p>film their days</p>
<p>they wanted to make</p>
<p>movies they were big</p>
<p>movie buffs</p>
<p>and they also just</p>
<p>watched anything horror</p>
<p>related horror horror</p>
<p>not horror but horror</p>
<p>they like to</p>
<p>watch scary</p>
<p>movies and they</p>
<p>watched anything</p>
<p>scary movie related</p>
<p>Brian he seemed</p>
<p>like the more outgoing type between him and Tori</p>
<p>it was said that</p>
<p>Brian had a really big</p>
<p>crush on Cassie</p>
<p>but she was not</p>
<p>interested she had a boyfriend at the times they</p>
<p>still remain friends he was kind of bummed that</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t like him like he liked her</p>
<p>Brian considered himself a</p>
<p>loser or an outcast</p>
<p>he said that</p>
<p>he had a really hard time fitting in in high</p>
<p>school and he had</p>
<p>a very strange obsession with</p>
<p>the Columbine</p>
<p>shooting the</p>
<p>school shooting well he</p>
<p>idolized the guys that did it</p>
<p>because he said they represented the outcasts</p>
<p>and the people that nobody paid attention to they got</p>
<p>their revenge and</p>
<p>Brian said that</p>
<p>he wanted to do something like them he wanted to be</p>
<p>great like they were</p>
<p>so Brian considered Tori like one</p>
<p>of his good friends so investigators questioned both</p>
<p>Brian and Tori</p>
<p>they explained that they were at the</p>
<p>house but they thought it was</p>
<p>gonna be like a</p>
<p>house party</p>
<p>and when they realized it wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>house party they decided to go to the</p>
<p>movies because</p>
<p>watching a movie was boring and</p>
<p>why watch a</p>
<p>movie when they can go to the</p>
<p>movie theater</p>
<p>and see something new</p>
<p>that just came out</p>
<p>both of the boys had</p>
<p>movie ticket</p>
<p>stubs to see the</p>
<p>movie holes</p>
<p>showing that they</p>
<p>indeed went to the</p>
<p>movie theater that</p>
<p>night so then 2 days</p>
<p>later they brought in Matt</p>
<p>Cory and Brian</p>
<p>again for questioning</p>
<p>they really didn&rsquo;t have many leads</p>
<p>and they thought okay well Matt</p>
<p>is not showing any type of emotion</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s bring him in</p>
<p>and question him a little bit</p>
<p>more and see what we can get out of him and then the</p>
<p>other boys are just</p>
<p>kinda suspicious</p>
<p>so they bring Matt</p>
<p>in for a polygraph test to see</p>
<p>if maybe they can get</p>
<p>something out of him they ask Matt</p>
<p>did you have anything to do with the murder of Cassie</p>
<p>matt says no</p>
<p>and he passes the polygraph test with like flying</p>
<p>colors so investigators decide to like step</p>
<p>back and they&rsquo;re like okay let&rsquo;s look at the other guys</p>
<p>so then they question</p>
<p>Brian and they</p>
<p>asked Brian</p>
<p>what did you do that</p>
<p>night and Brian repeated</p>
<p>to the investigators that he went to the</p>
<p>movies the investigators were like</p>
<p>okay well what</p>
<p>movie did you see then</p>
<p>Brian says like oh it was some</p>
<p>scary movie I can&rsquo;t remember the name right now</p>
<p>and investigators were like</p>
<p>okay and then they</p>
<p>asked Brian</p>
<p>okay well do you remember what the</p>
<p>movie was about</p>
<p>Brian was like well</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really remember</p>
<p>I just remember that it was boring</p>
<p>alright so then investigators</p>
<p>asked him do you remember who was in the</p>
<p>movie like do you remember anything</p>
<p>about the movie</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>um no I just like can&rsquo;t remember anyone&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>right now but I just remember</p>
<p>thinking the</p>
<p>whole time that</p>
<p>like it was boring and I didn&rsquo;t want to be there</p>
<p>so side note</p>
<p>all right so investigators are asking all these</p>
<p>basic questions like if you just</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>movie you would know the answer to</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>right and Brian</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know the answer to anything so</p>
<p>mean come on get it together</p>
<p>investigators thought it was definitely</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>both Brian and Tori</p>
<p>they both bragged</p>
<p>about being like</p>
<p>movie critics and how they were just like</p>
<p>everything about</p>
<p>movies and movies and</p>
<p>they just like</p>
<p>they would always brag</p>
<p>about how they&rsquo;re like the</p>
<p>movie gods and</p>
<p>there is definitely a red flag up</p>
<p>as far as like okay</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s got some shit</p>
<p>going on so then investigators they go down to the</p>
<p>movie theater to see who&rsquo;s working that</p>
<p>night at the</p>
<p>ticket booth</p>
<p>so they come across this girl who was working the</p>
<p>ticket booth Friday</p>
<p>night and they</p>
<p>asked her if she knew</p>
<p>Brian and Tori</p>
<p>and the girl working was like yeah I know them I go to</p>
<p>school with them</p>
<p>so then the investigator</p>
<p>asked okay well did they come to the</p>
<p>movies on Friday</p>
<p>night and the girl working the</p>
<p>ticket booth was like</p>
<p>no I would remember</p>
<p>seeing them because I was letting everybody in</p>
<p>when the ticket</p>
<p>booth girl said this they were like okay</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re definitely</p>
<p>lying about something</p>
<p>right on September</p>
<p>27th 2006 it was 5 days</p>
<p>after the murder</p>
<p>Brian comes into the investigator&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>to be questioned</p>
<p>again and right away they know that</p>
<p>Brian is acting</p>
<p>very strange</p>
<p>he seems more</p>
<p>quiet he seems more reserved he seems</p>
<p>upset set so as soon as</p>
<p>Brian sits down he</p>
<p>starts to cry and this makes investigators pretty</p>
<p>excited they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>hell yeah this is exactly what you want to happen</p>
<p>in your line of work</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re an investigator like</p>
<p>this is what you want you want someone to break down</p>
<p>Brian tells investigators at one</p>
<p>point when they were all</p>
<p>watching a movie</p>
<p>at cassie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house Brian</p>
<p>he snuck away to use the bathroom</p>
<p>but really he went down to the basement and unlocked</p>
<p>the back door so he told investigators that he and Tori</p>
<p>just wanted to</p>
<p>scare Matt and Cassie and</p>
<p>they were going to play a</p>
<p>prank on them</p>
<p>they told Cassie</p>
<p>and Matt that they were leaving and they were</p>
<p>gonna go to the movies</p>
<p>but really they left the house</p>
<p>and then they went around in the backyard they put</p>
<p>these creepy ass</p>
<p>clown face mask on</p>
<p>black clothing they brought</p>
<p>knives they did</p>
<p>that to make</p>
<p>their prank more realistic is what</p>
<p>Brian was saying</p>
<p>they went through the unlocked basement door</p>
<p>that he unlocked</p>
<p>earlier and then</p>
<p>it let them into the basement</p>
<p>where Brian and Tori were hanging out</p>
<p>a little bit trying to</p>
<p>wait for the perfect moment I</p>
<p>guess to scare them</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when they were messing with the</p>
<p>circuit box and they turned the</p>
<p>power off in the house</p>
<p>they thought it</p>
<p>would be funny to turn the</p>
<p>power on and off like</p>
<p>in the movie</p>
<p>Scream so they</p>
<p>just thought it</p>
<p>would be funny</p>
<p>if they turned off the</p>
<p>lights matt and Cassie</p>
<p>kind of went around to investigate and then they were</p>
<p>gonna pop out and scare them</p>
<p>they then go on to say that they turn the power</p>
<p>back half on then Matt</p>
<p>left so they thought okay well let&rsquo;s just further</p>
<p>mess with Cassie</p>
<p>and turn the</p>
<p>power back off</p>
<p>again they thought for sure this time cassie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come downstairs</p>
<p>down into the basement to</p>
<p>check the circuit box and then when she</p>
<p>would come downstairs that&rsquo;s when they were</p>
<p>gonna scare her</p>
<p>but Cassie never</p>
<p>came downstairs she stayed in the living room instead</p>
<p>and I was thinking when I was reading this I was like</p>
<p>girl me too like some people get up and go investigate</p>
<p>Nene now if something</p>
<p>if I feel like something bad&rsquo;s happening I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna stay right here</p>
<p>Brian says that Tori</p>
<p>started to get</p>
<p>super amped up</p>
<p>and he was like saying over and over</p>
<p>again that he had to do it he had to kill her</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do it let&rsquo;s do it like just getting</p>
<p>too jazzed up</p>
<p>Brian says that both of them went up the</p>
<p>stairs they went to find Cassie</p>
<p>Brian says Tori is the one</p>
<p>who attacked Cassie</p>
<p>and that he was</p>
<p>stabbing her</p>
<p>over and over and over again</p>
<p>and that he</p>
<p>never touched Cassie</p>
<p>Brian says that he was just there but</p>
<p>it was all Tori and it was supposed to just be a joke</p>
<p>over time Brian did</p>
<p>admit that he</p>
<p>stabbed Cassie</p>
<p>3 or 4 times because Tori told him to</p>
<p>and he was just afraid of Tori</p>
<p>because of how</p>
<p>aggressive he was getting</p>
<p>then he says</p>
<p>once Cassie was dead</p>
<p>Brian and Tori gathered up all of</p>
<p>their evidence they put</p>
<p>it in a bag and then they took it to like a wooded area</p>
<p>to bury Brian</p>
<p>takes investigators</p>
<p>where they had</p>
<p>barrier hidden the evidence</p>
<p>so then when investigators</p>
<p>get the evidence bag I mean it&rsquo;s filled with a bunch of</p>
<p>stuff there was</p>
<p>stick matches a pair of</p>
<p>black boots a pair of rubber</p>
<p>gloves workout</p>
<p>gloves the fingerless ones a melted</p>
<p>brown hydrogen</p>
<p>peroxide bottle</p>
<p>there were the creepy ass like</p>
<p>clown mask there was a</p>
<p>large dagger type</p>
<p>knife there was a shit tons of knives</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>large knife there was a silver</p>
<p>knife there was a</p>
<p>small knife there was a lot of</p>
<p>knives another</p>
<p>knife how many</p>
<p>knives were there</p>
<p>okay hold on then there was a Sony</p>
<p>video tape so a VHS</p>
<p>tape was also there so investigators</p>
<p>watch these tapes</p>
<p>and guess what</p>
<p>Tori and Brian</p>
<p>decided to videotape the</p>
<p>whole process</p>
<p>wow anyways so on</p>
<p>these tapes were what we</p>
<p>would call a vlog</p>
<p>so they were vlogging</p>
<p>their whole day that the murder took place</p>
<p>they were sitting down and they were writing</p>
<p>out how they are</p>
<p>going to kill somebody that day</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking to the camera both</p>
<p>saying that they picked Cassie to kill</p>
<p>and how they are</p>
<p>sorry to her family but they</p>
<p>quote had to do it</p>
<p>Cassie has to die</p>
<p>end quote on the 2 tapes you can</p>
<p>also see the 2 boys driving around and they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about how excited they are to kill someone</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>get better hobbies</p>
<p>is what you</p>
<p>wanna say so on</p>
<p>these tapes</p>
<p>Brian is the one who&rsquo;s like oh I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>excited I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna kill someone they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting themselves like all hyped up and then Tori</p>
<p>is not in the</p>
<p>frame but he says quote</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m horny just thinking</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>quote like talking</p>
<p>about killing her</p>
<p>there is video footage of this out there</p>
<p>you can watch it&rsquo;s on YouTube I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna put it in the</p>
<p>video cause</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to do that so the 2 boys they had filmed</p>
<p>their whole day leading up to the murder</p>
<p>and then they also filmed</p>
<p>after the murder</p>
<p>so they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>videotape the murder itself but</p>
<p>it was very</p>
<p>clear to investigators like</p>
<p>this whole thing was premeditated</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of footage for them to go through</p>
<p>but you can hear them explaining how the 2 boys are</p>
<p>outcast and how they wanted to go down in history like</p>
<p>Ted Bundy or the Roadside Strangler</p>
<p>how they needed to kill more people and</p>
<p>earn their spotlight</p>
<p>alongside these big serial killers like</p>
<p>you just hear them talking</p>
<p>about all this</p>
<p>so now on tape they see that</p>
<p>these 2 boys they were</p>
<p>planning to do this okay they see the</p>
<p>whole process</p>
<p>they see that it wasn&rsquo;t an accident it wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>joke it wasn&rsquo;t on a whim it wasn&rsquo;t just one of the boys</p>
<p>it was premeditated</p>
<p>and it was planned</p>
<p>they had all the evidence</p>
<p>they needed</p>
<p>when Tori was being investigated</p>
<p>he said that he just went</p>
<p>along for the ride like he thought it was just</p>
<p>gonna be a joke</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know that anybody was actually</p>
<p>going to die</p>
<p>we just both</p>
<p>pointed the finger</p>
<p>at each other</p>
<p>but after reviewing</p>
<p>these tapes investigators saw</p>
<p>that both of them seemed to take</p>
<p>equal parts in this</p>
<p>nobody knows who exactly I guess</p>
<p>stabbed Cassie</p>
<p>but based off of the</p>
<p>video tapes it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>could tell it was</p>
<p>both of their idea to do this</p>
<p>on September</p>
<p>27th 2006 both of the boys were arrested</p>
<p>again each one of them are</p>
<p>pointing the finger</p>
<p>Tori saying oh I thought we were just making a</p>
<p>movie I thought we were just joking but</p>
<p>Brian is the one who actually killed her</p>
<p>I was just there</p>
<p>and then Brian is saying that it was</p>
<p>all a joke and Tori is the one who actually killed her</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a mess it&rsquo;s like you guys</p>
<p>shut up I mean</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t they know what they</p>
<p>are on the video tapes</p>
<p>whatever there&rsquo;s also was evidence</p>
<p>found of Brian and Tori purchasing</p>
<p>knives at a pawn shop</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s video footage</p>
<p>shown of them</p>
<p>going to the pawn shop and</p>
<p>one of those</p>
<p>knives that they purchased was used to kill Cassie</p>
<p>it was just further</p>
<p>proof that this</p>
<p>whole thing was premeditated</p>
<p>so in trial both</p>
<p>Brian and Tori they didn&rsquo;t really have a defense</p>
<p>both just pointed the</p>
<p>blame on one another</p>
<p>and to explain the</p>
<p>videotape well</p>
<p>their defense</p>
<p>was that it was all acting that they were just making</p>
<p>their own horror film</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t real the main</p>
<p>point of difference</p>
<p>was that Brian actually confessed to</p>
<p>stabbing Cassie</p>
<p>and Tori had</p>
<p>never confessed to</p>
<p>stabbing or harming Cassie in</p>
<p>any way in tori&rsquo;s trial they</p>
<p>stuck to the evidence that was</p>
<p>found which</p>
<p>cassie&rsquo;s DNA was</p>
<p>found on one knife one</p>
<p>shirt and one glove</p>
<p>and those items were worn</p>
<p>by Brian they</p>
<p>also said that 4 different male DNA evidence was</p>
<p>found under cassie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right hand fingernails</p>
<p>and 2 male DNA evidence was</p>
<p>found on her left hand</p>
<p>according to</p>
<p>specialists</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s DNA was</p>
<p>found on both</p>
<p>cassie&rsquo;s right and left hand</p>
<p>but tori&rsquo;s DNA was not found</p>
<p>like under her</p>
<p>nails another</p>
<p>thing was the</p>
<p>videotape so</p>
<p>on the videotape you hear</p>
<p>after the murder had</p>
<p>taken place that Brian</p>
<p>is the one who&rsquo;s yelling I killed Cassie</p>
<p>like being excited</p>
<p>and Tori doesn&rsquo;t really say much about</p>
<p>what he did</p>
<p>nobody on the tape itself said</p>
<p>we killed Cassie it was just</p>
<p>I killed Cassie</p>
<p>tori&rsquo;s team</p>
<p>used this in his defense</p>
<p>saying that this proved</p>
<p>that Tori had nothing to do with it and it was all</p>
<p>Brian Brian and</p>
<p>Tori were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for</p>
<p>first degree murder without the possibility</p>
<p>of parole and 30 years to life</p>
<p>for conspiracy to commit</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>shortly after surprise surprise</p>
<p>both teens immediately appealed</p>
<p>their conviction</p>
<p>Brian argued</p>
<p>there were several</p>
<p>violations so</p>
<p>Brian argued that there were several</p>
<p>violations in the case and the</p>
<p>trial Brian said</p>
<p>in his 4th interview before he was arrested</p>
<p>with investigators his parents were not present so</p>
<p>Brian believed that any information from that interview</p>
<p>should have been suppressed</p>
<p>however the</p>
<p>court found that</p>
<p>everything that</p>
<p>was done in the interview was done correct so Brian</p>
<p>was told his Miranda</p>
<p>rights before he</p>
<p>was even questioned he signed a waiver saying that he</p>
<p>was read his Miranda</p>
<p>rights before being</p>
<p>and Brian didn&rsquo;t appear to be</p>
<p>tired upset or vulnerable</p>
<p>during his interview when the interview was happening</p>
<p>Brian did eventually stop and he</p>
<p>asked for his parents</p>
<p>which then at that point</p>
<p>the interview</p>
<p>itself had stopped with all of that information the</p>
<p>court determined that Brian</p>
<p>knowingly and willingly signed the waiver</p>
<p>which then petitioned his</p>
<p>right to counsel</p>
<p>appeal was denied</p>
<p>so tori&rsquo;s appeal was</p>
<p>focused on the fact that he</p>
<p>never admitted to</p>
<p>stabbing Cassie</p>
<p>he also focused on the</p>
<p>videotape itself saying that you</p>
<p>never hear him</p>
<p>admitting that he killed Cassie or did anything</p>
<p>to Cassie Tori</p>
<p>said he pretended to be high in the video and</p>
<p>never said anything that actually proved he was in the</p>
<p>house were a part of it so Tori also focused on</p>
<p>ineffective counsel</p>
<p>saying that his</p>
<p>rights had been violated due</p>
<p>to his counsel</p>
<p>not moving to</p>
<p>suppress evidence resulting from allegedly deficient</p>
<p>warrant so pretty much</p>
<p>according to the warrant that his</p>
<p>parents were served when they came to the</p>
<p>house to look through tori&rsquo;s</p>
<p>belongings the war in itself</p>
<p>it did not have any specific authority</p>
<p>to seize any computers or</p>
<p>electronics from tori&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>which ended up happening</p>
<p>and when investigators</p>
<p>searched tori&rsquo;s computer they</p>
<p>found evidence of</p>
<p>child pornography</p>
<p>and animal cruelty</p>
<p>on his computer</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>what Tori was saying was the evidence that was found</p>
<p>under the warrant</p>
<p>should have been suppressed because the warrant did not</p>
<p>state that his computers</p>
<p>could be taken</p>
<p>however the</p>
<p>court disagreed</p>
<p>and his appeal was denied the family was just</p>
<p>extremely heartbroken</p>
<p>at the loss of</p>
<p>their daughter</p>
<p>and they knew</p>
<p>Tori and Brian were responsible for it</p>
<p>which made them feel</p>
<p>pretty frustrated</p>
<p>when the 2 of them</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t take full responsibility</p>
<p>for what they had done</p>
<p>but also that they were trying to like appeal</p>
<p>and get out of</p>
<p>their sentencing like it</p>
<p>would just be exhausting</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t even just Cassie</p>
<p>that was harmed</p>
<p>the whole family was grieving at the loss cassie&rsquo;s aunt</p>
<p>uncle cousin</p>
<p>they all suffered</p>
<p>greatly after this</p>
<p>so cassie&rsquo;s 13 year old cousin was the one who</p>
<p>found her in the living room on the</p>
<p>floor she was</p>
<p>extremely traumatized</p>
<p>sadly it sent her into a really deep</p>
<p>depression and she</p>
<p>tried to commit suicide</p>
<p>and then cassie&rsquo;s aunt</p>
<p>she fell into a deep</p>
<p>depression as well she lost her job</p>
<p>and she just really struggled to make</p>
<p>sense of it all she felt like she</p>
<p>was responsible</p>
<p>for all of this</p>
<p>again I couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>imagine that burden you&rsquo;d be carrying</p>
<p>the aunt and</p>
<p>uncle they really just wanted out of this</p>
<p>house pretty much a reminder</p>
<p>of this horrible</p>
<p>crime and they were trying to sell the house</p>
<p>for years they had put it up</p>
<p>every year and</p>
<p>nobody was buying no one wanted to buy a home</p>
<p>with such a horrible</p>
<p>story so it just sent the family</p>
<p>into a deeper</p>
<p>depression because</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t escape this horrible</p>
<p>thing that happened it was a constant reminder</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t long</p>
<p>after that their case would</p>
<p>be brought back up into the spotlight because in</p>
<p>2012 the Supreme</p>
<p>Court in Idaho</p>
<p>ruled that mandatory life sentences are</p>
<p>unconstitutional for juvenile</p>
<p>defenders even</p>
<p>in cases of murder</p>
<p>so this decision left many people wondering if</p>
<p>Brian and Tori</p>
<p>their sentences</p>
<p>should be overturned</p>
<p>or reduced and in</p>
<p>2013 there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little documentary</p>
<p>called Lost for Life I</p>
<p>think it is</p>
<p>I just watched it last</p>
<p>night and I&rsquo;ll link it down</p>
<p>below cause it&rsquo;s on YouTube</p>
<p>watch it pretty much it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about life in prison</p>
<p>and how nobody</p>
<p>under the age of 18</p>
<p>should given a sentence of life in prison</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just all</p>
<p>about how it shouldn&rsquo;t be a</p>
<p>thing talks</p>
<p>about a handful of different cases and Tori and</p>
<p>Brian were both interviewed in this documentary as well</p>
<p>in the documentary it shows Brian who</p>
<p>he does show</p>
<p>a lot of remorse</p>
<p>and he seems very genuine</p>
<p>takes full responsibility for what he did and he came</p>
<p>to realize and accept that he killed somebody</p>
<p>who was a friend</p>
<p>how he&rsquo;s in debt</p>
<p>to Cassie and</p>
<p>her family he also says that like</p>
<p>accepts the fact that he probably won&rsquo;t be getting out</p>
<p>of prison he cries a lot and</p>
<p>first I was like oh</p>
<p>he seems so sad he knows what he did was</p>
<p>wrong he seems so mature now</p>
<p>you know and then I was like wait</p>
<p>wait a minute no</p>
<p>no you killed somebody you</p>
<p>videotaped it</p>
<p>you know it was just very</p>
<p>planned out that&rsquo;s takes a different kind of</p>
<p>brain I feel like personal opinion</p>
<p>though also like in the evidence there was a list of</p>
<p>other people they wanted to kill like</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want to kill one person they want to kill a</p>
<p>bunch of people so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say no</p>
<p>where I believe it</p>
<p>should be case by case</p>
<p>so then in this</p>
<p>documentary they interview Tori now Tori</p>
<p>on the other hand</p>
<p>he still to this</p>
<p>day does not take any responsibility for what he did</p>
<p>he does not take any responsibility for the role</p>
<p>the part he played in this</p>
<p>nothing and the whole time</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s being interviewed</p>
<p>his family is there with them his mom and dad and</p>
<p>they are acting like Tori</p>
<p>is the victim</p>
<p>the whole time his</p>
<p>mother keeps</p>
<p>speaking over him and refuses</p>
<p>he uses to believe that her</p>
<p>good son would ever do something like that he would</p>
<p>never do what he&rsquo;s being accused of</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s being one of those moms</p>
<p>wait don&rsquo;t come at me for that</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>those moms who like there&rsquo;s been a couple and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of any off the top of my head</p>
<p>but like when somebody commits a horrible</p>
<p>crime like in the Chris Watts case</p>
<p>oh man Chris Watts his mom like</p>
<p>would not believe that her son did what he did like</p>
<p>nope nope Chris is the</p>
<p>victim here</p>
<p>and it was just like lady</p>
<p>get a grip anyways that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>point the point is corey&rsquo;s mom was doing the same</p>
<p>thing during the interview</p>
<p>not once did they</p>
<p>bring up Cassie and</p>
<p>how her family is feeling what her family</p>
<p>maybe has been</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>instead they say like</p>
<p>how Tori is 100% innocent</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>victim in this</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s being locked up for no reason</p>
<p>except for the dad if you</p>
<p>watch it and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>again I&rsquo;ll link it down</p>
<p>below but if you</p>
<p>watch the dad he kind of seems iffy</p>
<p>okay he rarely speaks up</p>
<p>maybe he does and I missed it but he rarely like</p>
<p>speaks up and</p>
<p>he kind of low key looks like he&rsquo;s too afraid to</p>
<p>speak up because his wife is so like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s innocent yeah</p>
<p>I saw it in his eyes he was kind of like mmm mmm</p>
<p>hmm but that&rsquo;s just my opinion in the documentary</p>
<p>Brian also says that Tori was</p>
<p>the one who was like heavily</p>
<p>influenced and inspired by the movie</p>
<p>Scream and he wanted to create his own</p>
<p>murder that was pretty similar to that one that took</p>
<p>place in the movie Tori convinced Brian</p>
<p>to do something</p>
<p>based off of</p>
<p>screen so Brian was saying that he just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t understand why Tori won&rsquo;t admit</p>
<p>to anything Tori probably just wants to go home</p>
<p>which everybody in prison just wants to go home</p>
<p>so this I mean this case overall</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of our</p>
<p>worst nightmare</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re home</p>
<p>alone and you hear something</p>
<p>and you get that gut feeling that something isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right we constantly tell ourselves to</p>
<p>stop being a baby you&rsquo;re fine you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>and usually it is</p>
<p>like sadly for Cassie</p>
<p>this poor girl was just trying to make some</p>
<p>extra money</p>
<p>she was being a good kid</p>
<p>she was doing the</p>
<p>right thing</p>
<p>which is hard to do</p>
<p>especially in high</p>
<p>school and instead she gets brutally murdered by some</p>
<p>selfish ass hats who wanted to be in</p>
<p>their own horror</p>
<p>film I wish nothing but</p>
<p>peace healing and closure</p>
<p>for the families</p>
<p>all of the families on both ends</p>
<p>so that is a story</p>
<p>about Cassie</p>
<p>Joe Stodart</p>
<p>Cassie Joe Stoddart</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying Stoddart but it&rsquo;s probably Stodart</p>
<p>oh my God wait wait wait</p>
<p>wait a minute</p>
<p>I completely forgot</p>
<p>is everyone just</p>
<p>gonna ignore the fact that this</p>
<p>Tory guy yeah let&rsquo;s say he was innocent let&rsquo;s just say</p>
<p>he was innocent we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna ignore the fact that he had</p>
<p>child pornography</p>
<p>and some animal cruelty</p>
<p>photos on his computer</p>
<p>how come no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bringing that up</p>
<p>again no Tori</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re gonna stay there</p>
<p>okay okay but</p>
<p>other than that I hope you have a wonderful day</p>
<p>today you make</p>
<p>good choices and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
