    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, I have the pleasure</p>
<p>of introducing Dr. Robert Sapolsky.</p>
<p>Dr. Sapolsky is a professor of biology and neurosurgery</p>
<p>at Stanford University.</p>
<p>His laboratory has worked on a large variety of topics,</p>
<p>including stress, hormones,</p>
<p>including testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>and how the different members of a given species interact</p>
<p>according to factors like hormones,</p>
<p>hierarchy within primate troops,</p>
<p>and how things like stress, reproduction,</p>
<p>and competition impact behavior.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes Dr. Sapolsky&rsquo;s work so unique</p>
<p>is that it combines elements from primatology,</p>
<p>including field studies, with human behavior,</p>
<p>in essence, trying to unveil how humans,</p>
<p>as old world primates,</p>
<p>are controlled by different elements of our biology,</p>
<p>as well as our psychology.</p>
<p>Dr. Sapolsky is also a prolific author of popular books,</p>
<p>such as, Why Zebras Don&rsquo;t Get Ulcers,</p>
<p>The Trouble With Testosterone,</p>
<p>and Behave, The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst.</p>
<p>During the course of our discussion today,</p>
<p>Robert also revealed to me</p>
<p>that he is close to completing a new book</p>
<p>entitled, Determined, The Science of Life Without Free Will.</p>
<p>And indeed, we discuss the science of life</p>
<p>without free will during this episode.</p>
<p>We also discuss stress and how best to control stress,</p>
<p>and how stress controls us</p>
<p>at both conscious and subconscious levels.</p>
<p>We talk about testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>and hormone replacement therapy,</p>
<p>and how those impact our mind, our psychology,</p>
<p>and our interactions with others.</p>
<p>As with any discussion with Dr. Sapolsky,</p>
<p>we learn about scientific mechanisms</p>
<p>that make us who we are.</p>
<p>And today we also discuss tools</p>
<p>and how we can leverage those scientific mechanisms</p>
<p>in order to be better versions of ourselves.</p>
<p>I should mention that unlike most guest interviews</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>this one had to be carried out remotely</p>
<p>due to various constraints.</p>
<p>So you may hear the occasional audio artifact.</p>
<p>Please excuse that.</p>
<p>We felt that the value of a conversation with Dr. Sapolsky</p>
<p>was well worth those minor, minor glitches.</p>
<p>And indeed, the information that he delivers us</p>
<p>is tremendously valuable, interesting,</p>
<p>and in many cases, actionable as well.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now, without further ado,</p>
<p>my conversation with Dr. Robert Sapolsky.</p>
<p>Great, well, thank you so much, Robert,</p>
<p>for joining us today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this for a very long time</p>
<p>and I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s glad to be here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an enormous range of topics</p>
<p>that we could drill into,</p>
<p>but just to start off,</p>
<p>I want to return to a topic</p>
<p>that is near and dear to your heart, which is stress.</p>
<p>And one of the questions that I get most commonly</p>
<p>is what is the difference between short and long-term stress</p>
<p>in terms of their benefits and their drawbacks?</p>
<p>And the reason I say benefits is that,</p>
<p>obviously stress and the stress response can keep us alive,</p>
<p>but stress, of course, can also sharpen our mental acuity</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So how should we conceptualize stress</p>
<p>and how should we conceptualize stress</p>
<p>in the short-term and in the long-term?</p>
<p>Well, basically sort of two graphs that one would draw.</p>
<p>The first one is just all sorts</p>
<p>of beneficial effects of stress short-term.</p>
<p>And then once we get into chronicity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just downhill from there,</p>
<p>short-term because it saves you from the predator,</p>
<p>short-term because you&rsquo;re giving a presentation</p>
<p>and you think more clearly or your focus is better,</p>
<p>all sorts of aspects of that.</p>
<p>And what then winds up being an argument</p>
<p>is how long does it take to go from short-term to long-term?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s somewhat arbitrary,</p>
<p>but the sorts of chronic stressors</p>
<p>that most people deal with</p>
<p>are just undeniably in the chronic range,</p>
<p>like having spent the last 20 years daily traffic jams</p>
<p>or abusive boss or some such thing.</p>
<p>The other curve that&rsquo;s sort of perpendicular to this</p>
<p>is dealing with the fact</p>
<p>that sometimes stress is a great thing.</p>
<p>Like our goal is not to cure people of stress</p>
<p>because if it&rsquo;s the right kind, we love it.</p>
<p>We pay good money to be stressed that way</p>
<p>by a scary movie or a rollercoaster ride.</p>
<p>What you wind up seeing</p>
<p>is when it&rsquo;s the right amount of stress,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what we call stimulation.</p>
<p>And the basic curve there</p>
<p>is here&rsquo;s an optimal level of stimulation</p>
<p>and too little and function goes down</p>
<p>with what we would call boredom and too much</p>
<p>and function goes down with what we would call stress.</p>
<p>And the optimum is what all of us aim for.</p>
<p>In terms of the benefits of stress in the short-term,</p>
<p>one thing that&rsquo;s really striking to me</p>
<p>is how the physiologically the stress response</p>
<p>looks so much like the excitement response</p>
<p>to a positive event.</p>
<p>And we can speculate that the fundamental difference</p>
<p>between short-term stress and short-term excitement</p>
<p>is some neuromodulator like dopamine</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But is there anything else that we know about the biology</p>
<p>that reveals to us,</p>
<p>what really creates this thing we call valence</p>
<p>that an experience can be terrible or feel awful</p>
<p>or it can feel wonderful, exhilarating,</p>
<p>depending on this somewhat subjective feature</p>
<p>we call valence.</p>
<p>Do we know what valence is or where it resides?</p>
<p>On a really mechanical level,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a circumstance that is requiring</p>
<p>that your heart races and you&rsquo;re breathing as fast</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re using your muscles and some such thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be having roughly the same</p>
<p>brain activation profile,</p>
<p>whether this is for something wonderful</p>
<p>or something terrible,</p>
<p>with the one exception being that</p>
<p>if the amygdala is part of the activation,</p>
<p>this is something that&rsquo;s going to be counting as adverse.</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s the circumstance,</p>
<p>an adverse circumstance recruiting the amygdala into it</p>
<p>and how much it&rsquo;s the amygdala being involved</p>
<p>biases you towards interpreting it as even more awful.</p>
<p>The amygdala in some ways is kind of the checkpoint</p>
<p>as to whether we&rsquo;re talking about excitement</p>
<p>or terror.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the amygdala as a transition point</p>
<p>to another topic that you&rsquo;ve spent many years</p>
<p>working on and thinking about,</p>
<p>which is testosterone and other sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>I heard you say once before that</p>
<p>among all the brain areas that bind testosterone,</p>
<p>that where testosterone can park and create effects,</p>
<p>that the amygdala is among the most chock-a-block</p>
<p>full of these parking spots, these receptors.</p>
<p>I realize there&rsquo;s a lot here,</p>
<p>but how should we think about the role of testosterone</p>
<p>in the amygdala,</p>
<p>given that the engagement of the amygdala</p>
<p>is fundamental in this transition point</p>
<p>between a exhilarating positive response</p>
<p>and a negative stressful response?</p>
<p>Or maybe just broadly,</p>
<p>how should we think about testosterone</p>
<p>and its effects on the brain?</p>
<p>And pertinent to the transition</p>
<p>from whether this is a stressor that&rsquo;s evoking fear</p>
<p>or evoking aggression in terms of that continuum also,</p>
<p>because the amygdala is in the center</p>
<p>of all four points on those axes.</p>
<p>Basically, almost everybody out there</p>
<p>has a completely wrong idea as to what testosterone does,</p>
<p>which is testosterone makes you aggressive</p>
<p>because males in virtually every species out there</p>
<p>have more testosterone and are more aggressive</p>
<p>and seasonal maters have testosterone</p>
<p>surging at the time of year.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re punching it out over territory</p>
<p>and you take testosterone out of the picture.</p>
<p>You castrate any mammal out there, including us,</p>
<p>and levels of aggression will go down.</p>
<p>And the easy thing then to conclude</p>
<p>is that testosterone causes aggression.</p>
<p>And the reality is testosterone does no such thing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t cause aggression.</p>
<p>And you can see this both behaviorally and in the amygdala,</p>
<p>what does testosterone do?</p>
<p>It lowers the threshold for the sort of things</p>
<p>that would normally provoke you into being aggressive</p>
<p>so that it happens more easily.</p>
<p>It makes systems that are already turned on,</p>
<p>turn on louder rather than turning on aggressive music</p>
<p>or some such thing.</p>
<p>What does that look like behaviorally?</p>
<p>You take five male monkeys, put them together,</p>
<p>they form a dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p>Number one is great, number five is miserable,</p>
<p>number three is right in between.</p>
<p>Now take number three and shoot the guy up</p>
<p>with tons of testosterone</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gonna be involved in more fights.</p>
<p>Aha, testosterone uniformly causes aggression.</p>
<p>But you look closely and there&rsquo;s a pattern to it.</p>
<p>Is number three now challenging numbers two and one</p>
<p>for their place in the hierarchy?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>He is brown nosing them exactly as much as he used to.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on is he&rsquo;s just a miserable terror</p>
<p>to poor number four and five.</p>
<p>And in that case, what testosterone is doing</p>
<p>is amplifying the pre-existing patterns of aggression,</p>
<p>amplifying the social learning that&rsquo;s already gone into it.</p>
<p>Now on sort of the more reductive level,</p>
<p>so how does that translate into the amygdala?</p>
<p>Does testosterone make amygdaloid neurons</p>
<p>have action potentials?</p>
<p>Does it cause those neurons to suddenly speak</p>
<p>about fear and aggression spontaneously?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>What they do is if the amygdala is already being stimulated,</p>
<p>it increases the rate of neuronal firing.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s worth, it shortens after hyperpolarizations.</p>
<p>So the theme there exactly is it&rsquo;s not creating aggression,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just upping the volume</p>
<p>of whatever aggression is already there.</p>
<p>And once you factor that in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to say anything about what testosterone does</p>
<p>outside the context of what testosterone related behaviors,</p>
<p>how they get treated in your social setting.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in terms of status</p>
<p>and the relationship between individuals,</p>
<p>either non-human primates or humans,</p>
<p>can we say that testosterone and levels of testosterone,</p>
<p>or I should say, can we say that relative levels</p>
<p>of testosterone between individuals</p>
<p>is correlated to status within the hierarchy?</p>
<p>Yes, but in a way that winds up being totally uninteresting.</p>
<p>Like you go back, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>whatever number of decades to endocrinology texts,</p>
<p>and there were two totally reliable findings in there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, I have a dog in here that&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>We like dogs at the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s jingling a bit.</p>
<p>They are welcome.</p>
<p>They are absolutely welcome, yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;d be two truisms,</p>
<p>which is higher levels of testosterone</p>
<p>predict higher levels of aggression</p>
<p>in humans and other animals.</p>
<p>Higher levels of testosterone</p>
<p>predict higher levels of sexual activity.</p>
<p>Whoa, testosterone causing both.</p>
<p>And the correlation is there.</p>
<p>And when you look closely, we&rsquo;ve got cause and effect stuff.</p>
<p>Sexual behavior raises testosterone levels.</p>
<p>Aggression raises testosterone levels.</p>
<p>Your levels beforehand are barely predictive</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a response rather than a cause.</p>
<p>When you look at that though,</p>
<p>in terms of making sense of individual differences,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t matter a whole lot.</p>
<p>You can like spend an entire career</p>
<p>on the social circumstances that produce 3 1‚ÅÑ2%</p>
<p>more testosterone in the circulation</p>
<p>and expect to see all sorts of interesting implications.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not really the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat of a yes or no modulator</p>
<p>of the much more subtle social stuff that&rsquo;s already there.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>You know, I think that there are a lot of misconceptions</p>
<p>about human biology,</p>
<p>but testosterone seems to be one area where,</p>
<p>at least from what I can find on the internet,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sort of at the peak of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Maybe we could just ask a few more questions</p>
<p>about testosterone and sexual behavior,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an interesting story there</p>
<p>about castration versus non-castration</p>
<p>and the causality again.</p>
<p>But before you address that,</p>
<p>I just want to highlight something that you said</p>
<p>that I think is so vital,</p>
<p>which is that behaviors such as aggressive behaviors</p>
<p>and sexual behaviors can actually increase testosterone.</p>
<p>Did I hear that correctly?</p>
<p>And the reverse is sort of true,</p>
<p>but not in a causal way.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>The opposite direction of the causality?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if I were to increase somebody&rsquo;s testosterone by 30%,</p>
<p>male or female, doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>their sexual behavior may or may not change.</p>
<p>Essentially zero effect at all.</p>
<p>Your brain is not that sensitive</p>
<p>to fluctuations in testosterone levels.</p>
<p>In terms of things like aggression,</p>
<p>raising testosterone is a great footnote.</p>
<p>If you have the right type of willing to die</p>
<p>in the trenches devotion sort of thing,</p>
<p>watching your favorite team play a sport</p>
<p>will raise your testosterone levels</p>
<p>as you sit there with the potato chips in your armchair.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the physicality of aggression,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the psychological framing of it.</p>
<p>So yeah, testosterone is not causing that.</p>
<p>A great way to appreciate that is,</p>
<p>okay, so you had all these testosterone</p>
<p>sexual behavior correlations,</p>
<p>and you do the definitive endocrine intervention,</p>
<p>which is you do a subtraction study,</p>
<p>you remove the testes,</p>
<p>and as I said before,</p>
<p>levels of sexual behavior goes down.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just shown that testosterone is somehow causative.</p>
<p>Critically, they go down, but not down to zero,</p>
<p>whether you are a rat or a monkey or a human, whatever.</p>
<p>And what predicts how much residual sexual behavior is there?</p>
<p>How much sexual behavior there was before castration?</p>
<p>What that&rsquo;s telling you is by then,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s behavior that&rsquo;s being carried</p>
<p>by social learning and context,</p>
<p>rather than by a hormone.</p>
<p>Exact same thing with aggression.</p>
<p>Drops after castration doesn&rsquo;t go to zero.</p>
<p>The more prior history of it,</p>
<p>the more it just keeps coasting along on its own,</p>
<p>even without testosterone.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Can we say that there&rsquo;s an exception</p>
<p>in terms of the early organizing effects of hormones?</p>
<p>Like for instance, if a developing animal</p>
<p>is deprived of testosterone or estrogen</p>
<p>or aromatized testosterone into estrogen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole story there, as you know,</p>
<p>but then I could imagine that the circuits of the brain</p>
<p>that are responsible for initiating sexual behavior</p>
<p>in the first place might not emerge</p>
<p>and therefore not be sensitive to testosterone</p>
<p>later in life.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And a great way of seeing that</p>
<p>is this totally nutty biological factoid,</p>
<p>which is the second to fourth digit ratio in hands.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Totally obscure thing.</p>
<p>The ratio of one to the other,</p>
<p>in some way reflects levels of testosterone,</p>
<p>androgen exposure during fetal life.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t remember which way it goes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s minuscule.</p>
<p>I mean, you need a thousand people in your sample size</p>
<p>to be able to see anything,</p>
<p>but you see it in other primates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already there in fetal sonograms, all of that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a readout of subtle differences</p>
<p>in prenatal exposure.</p>
<p>And that winds up being a predictor</p>
<p>of a whole range of subtle stuff in adult behavior.</p>
<p>So yeah, at the fetal end,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re still building everything,</p>
<p>testosterone and the amount of it</p>
<p>is making a huge difference.</p>
<p>By the time you&rsquo;re an adult,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just somewhat of an all or none signal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have a confession,</p>
<p>which is that I was a master&rsquo;s student at Berkeley</p>
<p>in Mark Breedlove&rsquo;s arena.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m an author on that paper,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m deep within the author line</p>
<p>and you got the description of it exactly right,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the D2,</p>
<p>the index finger to the ring finger ratio</p>
<p>is more similar in females than it is in males.</p>
<p>In males, the index finger tends to be shorter.</p>
<p>And for people out there who are listening to this,</p>
<p>who are now freaking out or measuring,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a proper way to measure this,</p>
<p>which is eyeballing it doesn&rsquo;t work all the time</p>
<p>unless at the extremes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some interesting stories there.</p>
<p>It actually has been replicated</p>
<p>no fewer than five times, Mark Breedlove tells me.</p>
<p>But yes, in terms of these early organizing effects,</p>
<p>those seem very robust in most studies.</p>
<p>These later effects are a sort of activation</p>
<p>of neural circuits by hormones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely fascinated by this.</p>
<p>And I do have a couple other questions,</p>
<p>which is we normally associate testosterone with males,</p>
<p>but of course, females make testosterone as well</p>
<p>from the adrenals.</p>
<p>And presumably elsewhere too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing if we looked hard enough,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d probably find that there were other sources</p>
<p>of androgens in females.</p>
<p>Can we say that these general contours of effects</p>
<p>on aggression also pertain to females?</p>
<p>And I suppose I should ask in particular</p>
<p>about female-female aggression,</p>
<p>which does exist in many species,</p>
<p>female-male aggression, as well as maternal aggression,</p>
<p>which is a robust aspect of our evolution, of course,</p>
<p>that the mother will, an angry mother animal of any kind</p>
<p>protecting her young is truly dangerous</p>
<p>in the best sense of the word.</p>
<p>And that type of post parturition,</p>
<p>period after birth aggression is all about estrogen,</p>
<p>progesterone, those sorts of things.</p>
<p>Female aggression the rest of the time</p>
<p>has testosterone as a major player</p>
<p>at a much lower level on the average.</p>
<p>On the average, one always has to say,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically the same punchlines.</p>
<p>In females, the lower levels of testosterone</p>
<p>are essential for typical levels of aggression</p>
<p>and sexual behavior.</p>
<p>None of us, they&rsquo;re not causing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sensitive to small individual differences.</p>
<p>Same exact thing.</p>
<p>You can get way over impressed</p>
<p>with the importance of androgens in females</p>
<p>just as readily as in males.</p>
<p>So in line with that,</p>
<p>how should we conceptualize testosterone?</p>
<p>I realize there isn&rsquo;t a single sentence</p>
<p>or that can capture a hormone and all its effects</p>
<p>because hormones have so many different slow</p>
<p>and fast effects on the brain, on other glands,</p>
<p>on their own, on the very glands that produce them.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;ve heard you talk about testosterone today</p>
<p>and over the years, I start to get the impression</p>
<p>that as the most misunderstood molecule</p>
<p>in human health in the universe,</p>
<p>it has, it&rsquo;s clearly doing something very powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shifting the way that certain neural circuits work,</p>
<p>adjusting the gain on the amygdala as you described</p>
<p>and certainly other things as well.</p>
<p>Is there any truism about testosterone</p>
<p>like in its relationship to effort</p>
<p>or its relationship to resilience</p>
<p>and in a way that maybe will help me and other people</p>
<p>sort of think about how to think about testosterone?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe three separate answers to that.</p>
<p>The first one is, I think it&rsquo;s a fair summary</p>
<p>to think that when it comes to motivated strong behaviors,</p>
<p>what testosterone does is make you more</p>
<p>of whatever you already are in that domain.</p>
<p>Sexual arousal, libido, aggressiveness,</p>
<p>spontaneous aggression, reactive aggression,</p>
<p>things of that sort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s upping the volume of things</p>
<p>that are already strongly there.</p>
<p>Second way to think about it is,</p>
<p>well, here&rsquo;s like my favorite finding about testosterone.</p>
<p>And this was some wonderful work by a guy, John Wingfield,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the best behavioral endocrinologists out there</p>
<p>and about 20 years ago,</p>
<p>he formulated what was called the challenge hypothesis</p>
<p>of testosterone action.</p>
<p>What does testosterone do?</p>
<p>Testosterone is what you secrete</p>
<p>when your status is being challenged</p>
<p>and it makes it more likely that you&rsquo;ll do the behaviors</p>
<p>needed to hold on to your status.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s totally boringly straightforward</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a baboon.</p>
<p>If somebody is challenging your high rank,</p>
<p>the appropriate response on your part</p>
<p>is going to be aggression.</p>
<p>All right, so we&rsquo;ve just gotten through the back door</p>
<p>to testosterone and aggression again.</p>
<p>But then you get to humans</p>
<p>and humans have lots of different ways of achieving</p>
<p>or maintaining status.</p>
<p>And all you need to do is go to like some fancy</p>
<p>private schools annual auction</p>
<p>and you will see all these half drunk alpha males</p>
<p>competing to see who can give the most money away</p>
<p>as a show of conspicuous like,</p>
<p>property that they have.</p>
<p>And in a setting like that,</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t been able to take urine samples</p>
<p>at those times, unfortunately,</p>
<p>but that shows the flip side of it.</p>
<p>If you have a species that hands out status</p>
<p>in a very different sort of way,</p>
<p>testosterone is going to boost that also.</p>
<p>Okay, so that generates a totally nutty prediction.</p>
<p>Take people in a circumstance,</p>
<p>say playing an economic game,</p>
<p>where you get status by being trustworthy</p>
<p>and being generous in your interactions with the game.</p>
<p>If you give people testosterone,</p>
<p>does that make them more generous?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s absolutely the case.</p>
<p>Totally cool finding.</p>
<p>Showing you, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>basically if you took a whole bunch of Buddhist monks</p>
<p>and shot them up with testosterone,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d get all competitive with each other</p>
<p>as to who could do the most random acts of kindness.</p>
<p>And if we have a societal problem with too much aggression,</p>
<p>the first culprit to look at is not testosterone.</p>
<p>The first to look at is that we hand out</p>
<p>so much damn elevated status</p>
<p>for aggression in so many circumstances.</p>
<p>So I find that finding to be fantastic.</p>
<p>Third thing about subtlety of testosterone.</p>
<p>Okay, so like some subtler behavioral effects.</p>
<p>You give testosterone to people</p>
<p>and they become more confident.</p>
<p>They become more self-confident.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>People pay to take all sorts of nonsensical self-help courses</p>
<p>that will boost your self-esteem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing,</p>
<p>unless testosterone makes you more confident.</p>
<p>That is inaccurate.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re more likely to barrel into wrong decisions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s shown in economic gameplay</p>
<p>is that testosterone, by making you more confident,</p>
<p>makes you less cooperative.</p>
<p>Because who needs to cooperate?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m on top of this all on my own.</p>
<p>Testosterone makes people cocky and impulsive.</p>
<p>And that may be great in one setting.</p>
<p>But if in the others, you&rsquo;re absolutely sure</p>
<p>your army is gonna overrun the other country in three days.</p>
<p>So hell, let&rsquo;s start World War I</p>
<p>and you get a big surprise out of it.</p>
<p>Testosterone altering risk assessment beforehand</p>
<p>probably played a big role in that kind of miscalculation.</p>
<p>Super interesting.</p>
<p>I always think about testosterone and dopamine</p>
<p>being close cousins in the brain,</p>
<p>not just because of their relationship</p>
<p>through the pituitary and hypothalamus, that of course,</p>
<p>but also because of dopamine&rsquo;s salient role</p>
<p>in creating this bias towards exteroception.</p>
<p>You know, when somebody takes a drug</p>
<p>that increases dopamine</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re chock-a-block full of dopamine,</p>
<p>they tend, I want to highlight tend</p>
<p>because this is, I&rsquo;m really generalizing it,</p>
<p>but they tend to focus on outward goals,</p>
<p>you know, things beyond the boundaries of their skin.</p>
<p>And testosterone seems to do a bit of the same.</p>
<p>It tends to put us into a similar mode</p>
<p>of perceiving the outside world</p>
<p>in ways that we&rsquo;re asking questions like,</p>
<p>how do I relate to this other of my species?</p>
<p>How do I relate to these goals?</p>
<p>Is there anything that we can do</p>
<p>to better conceptualize the relationship</p>
<p>between testosterone and dopamine and motivation?</p>
<p>Or would that just take us down the alleyways</p>
<p>of neural pathways and the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which was fine too?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s got lots to do</p>
<p>with sort of this massive revisionism about dopamine.</p>
<p>Everyone since the pharaohs got brought up</p>
<p>being taught that dopamine is about pleasure and reward.</p>
<p>Turns out it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s about anticipation of reward.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about generating the motivation,</p>
<p>the goal-directed behavior needed to go get that reward.</p>
<p>And before you know it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using like elevated dopamine your entire life</p>
<p>to motivate you to do whatever is going to get you</p>
<p>like entry into heaven, afterlife,</p>
<p>kind of, you know, it&rsquo;s doing that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really about the motivation</p>
<p>and what testosterone does,</p>
<p>even in individuals who are not aggressive</p>
<p>and why testosterone replacement</p>
<p>is often a very helpful thing for aging males</p>
<p>is it increases energy.</p>
<p>It increases a sense of there-ness,</p>
<p>of presence, of alertness.</p>
<p>It increases motivation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a whole aspect,</p>
<p>which then takes us into,</p>
<p>is your motivation to get up and like go,</p>
<p>you know, hand out lots of soup</p>
<p>in a soup kitchen for homeless people,</p>
<p>or is it to get up and go ethnically cleanse a village?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got much to do with what your makeup was</p>
<p>before the testosterone got on board.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s activating in an energetic sense.</p>
<p>Testosterone within minutes</p>
<p>increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just more awake and alert and all of that.</p>
<p>And that has a lot to do with what dopamine does.</p>
<p>And as one might predict then,</p>
<p>getting just the right levels of testosterone</p>
<p>infused into your bloodstream feels great to lab rats.</p>
<p>They will lever press to get infused into the range</p>
<p>that optimizes dopamine release.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re deeply intertwined.</p>
<p>Yeah, such beautiful biology there.</p>
<p>And I love the way you encapsulate their relationship.</p>
<p>I want to ask about estrogen.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t hear as about estrogen as often.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always interesting to me now</p>
<p>doing some public facing education, you know,</p>
<p>that testosterone is this very controversial molecule,</p>
<p>just to say it is almost controversial.</p>
<p>But estrogen doesn&rsquo;t seem to hold</p>
<p>the same controversial weight.</p>
<p>And yet estrogen has a very powerful effects</p>
<p>on both the animal brain and on the human brain</p>
<p>of males and females.</p>
<p>Men do not want their estrogen to go too low.</p>
<p>Terrible things happen.</p>
<p>They will lose cognitive function.</p>
<p>Libido can drop.</p>
<p>So men need estrogen as well,</p>
<p>but perhaps maybe we can put the same filter on estrogen</p>
<p>as we did on testosterone.</p>
<p>Are there any general themes of estrogen</p>
<p>that people should be aware of,</p>
<p>or that you think that are generally misunderstood?</p>
<p>Is it really all about feelings and empathy</p>
<p>and making us more sensitive?</p>
<p>I sense not.</p>
<p>No, and it&rsquo;s once again, very context dependent.</p>
<p>And if estrogen after giving birth is playing a central role</p>
<p>and you wanting to shred the face</p>
<p>of somebody getting too close</p>
<p>to your kittens kind of thing,</p>
<p>we know it&rsquo;s not just warm, fuzzy,</p>
<p>you know, empathic kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Estrogen, you know, in lots of ways</p>
<p>could be summarized by if you had a choice in the matter</p>
<p>between having a lot of estrogen</p>
<p>in your bloodstream or not,</p>
<p>go for having a lot of estrogen.</p>
<p>It enhances cognitions, exactly as you said.</p>
<p>It stimulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>It increases glucose and oxygen delivery.</p>
<p>It protects you from dementia.</p>
<p>It decreases inflammatory oxidative damage to blood vessels,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s good for protecting</p>
<p>from cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>in contrast to testosterone,</p>
<p>which is making every one of those things worse.</p>
<p>This brings up this minefield of the question,</p>
<p>which is so what about postmenopausal estrogen?</p>
<p>And all sorts of lab studies with non-human primates</p>
<p>suggested that you keep estrogen levels high</p>
<p>after a monkey&rsquo;s equivalent of menopause,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna keep brain health a lot better,</p>
<p>decreasing the risk of dementia, stroke, every such thing.</p>
<p>Estrogen is a great antioxidant, all of that.</p>
<p>So in the 90s, I think, when Healy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m forgetting her name,</p>
<p>but when there was the first female head of the NIH,</p>
<p>Bernadette Healy set up this massive prospective human study</p>
<p>what was gonna be the biggest one of all times,</p>
<p>looking at the pluses and minuses</p>
<p>of postmenopausal estrogen.</p>
<p>And tens of thousands of women,</p>
<p>and they had to cut the study short</p>
<p>because what they were seeing was</p>
<p>estrogen was not only doing the normal bad stuff</p>
<p>that you expect in terms of some decalcification stuff,</p>
<p>but it was increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>and it was increasing the risk of stroke,</p>
<p>and it was increasing the risk of dementia.</p>
<p>And this ground to a halt, and everybody,</p>
<p>they stopped the study in front page news,</p>
<p>and everybody panicked at that point,</p>
<p>and nobody could make sense of it</p>
<p>who had been spending the last 20 years</p>
<p>studying the exact same thing in primates</p>
<p>and seeing all the protective effects.</p>
<p>And the explanation turned out to be one of those things</p>
<p>where like law of unexpected consequences,</p>
<p>okay, menopause in women last different lengths of time,</p>
<p>that may be a factor that&rsquo;s gonna come.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not start giving our study subjects more estrogen</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re totally past menopause.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;ve got that lag time in between,</p>
<p>you shift all sorts of estrogen receptor patterns,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where all of the bad effects come from.</p>
<p>All of the monkey studies had involved</p>
<p>just maintaining ovulatory levels</p>
<p>into the post-menopausal period.</p>
<p>And you do that, and you get great effects.</p>
<p>Estrogen is one of the greatest predictors</p>
<p>of protection from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, all of that,</p>
<p>but it needs to be physiological.</p>
<p>Just keep continuing what your body</p>
<p>has been doing for a long time</p>
<p>versus let the whole thing shut down</p>
<p>and suddenly like try to fire up the coal stoves</p>
<p>at the bottom of the basement kind of thing</p>
<p>and get that going,</p>
<p>there you get utterly different outcomes.</p>
<p>And that caused a lot of human health consequences</p>
<p>when people suddenly decided that estrogen</p>
<p>is in fact neurologically endangering post-menopausal age.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And I never thought that these steroid hormone receptors</p>
<p>could, you know, by not binding estrogen,</p>
<p>being devoid of estrogen binding, I should say,</p>
<p>could then set off opposite biochemical cascades.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>I guess it raises the question</p>
<p>about testosterone replacement too,</p>
<p>whether or not people should talk to their doctor</p>
<p>before too long,</p>
<p>men and women talk to your physicians before too long</p>
<p>to avoid whatever is happening in these periods</p>
<p>where there isn&rsquo;t sufficient testosterone and or estrogen.</p>
<p>Sounds like it could cause longer term problems</p>
<p>even when therapies are introduced.</p>
<p>Two additional miseries slash complications.</p>
<p>So, okay, you&rsquo;re trying to understand,</p>
<p>you look at women with a history</p>
<p>with or without post-menopausal estrogen replacement,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s done right.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re seeing 20 years later,</p>
<p>estrogen is a predictor of a decreased risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Then you gotta start trying to do</p>
<p>the unpacking prospective type studies.</p>
<p>How much estrogen?</p>
<p>At which times?</p>
<p>Estrogen is just a catch-all term for a bunch of hormones,</p>
<p>estrone, estradiol, estreal.</p>
<p>How much of each one of them?</p>
<p>Natural or synthetic?</p>
<p>Go try to figure all of that out.</p>
<p>And the second complication is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often hard to say anything about what estrogen does</p>
<p>outside the context of what progesterone is doing.</p>
<p>And often it&rsquo;s not the absolute levels of either,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ratio of the two.</p>
<p>This is such a more complicated endocrine system</p>
<p>than testosterone.</p>
<p>And because you have to generate dramatic cyclicity,</p>
<p>that no male hypothalamus ever has to dream of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much, much more complicated system.</p>
<p>Thus, it&rsquo;s a lot more complicated to understand,</p>
<p>let alone figure out what the ideal benefits are of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ken, I don&rsquo;t know what to make of the literature</p>
<p>on dropping rates of testosterone and endocrine disruptors.</p>
<p>You know, I was at Berkeley when Tyrone Hayes</p>
<p>published his data on these frogs that were drinking water</p>
<p>from various locations throughout the United States,</p>
<p>not just in California,</p>
<p>and seeing very severe endocrine disruption</p>
<p>through blockade of androgen receptors</p>
<p>and all sorts of issues.</p>
<p>And you hear this all the time now</p>
<p>that sperm counts are dropping,</p>
<p>that there are all these endocrine disruptors,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s birth control in the water,</p>
<p>in the drinking water.</p>
<p>It all starts to sound a little crazy.</p>
<p>And yet I&rsquo;ve also been fooled before by, you know,</p>
<p>I guess a good example would be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of crazy stuff in the world online</p>
<p>about all the terrible stuff in highly processed foods.</p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;ve got very respectable people,</p>
<p>endocrinologists at UCSF, like Robert Lustig saying,</p>
<p>yeah, a lot of these hidden sugars</p>
<p>and these emulsifiers, they&rsquo;re causing real problems.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve become more open-minded about the question.</p>
<p>And so are we suffering from drops in sperm counts</p>
<p>and testosterone and estrogen and fertility</p>
<p>as a consequence of endocrine disruptors</p>
<p>in the environments and food,</p>
<p>or because of social reasons?</p>
<p>Is there anything that we can hang our hat on,</p>
<p>like real data that you&rsquo;re confident in,</p>
<p>or is it just a mess?</p>
<p>No, the phenomenon does appear to be quite real.</p>
<p>Cross-sectional studies, human populations,</p>
<p>or I still don&rsquo;t understand why this was one</p>
<p>of the first things that Hayes spotted,</p>
<p>decreasing testicle size in crocodiles.</p>
<p>Go figure why that was one of the first contributions</p>
<p>to this, and I think the phenomenon is absolutely real.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re then left with is two classic challenges,</p>
<p>this is correlated with something broad,</p>
<p>environmental toxins, which ones, how much, when, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the other one always being, well, okay,</p>
<p>dropping, is it dropping enough to make a difference?</p>
<p>How big of an effect is this?</p>
<p>And those are where the juries are still out.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an area that I know there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got groups of people</p>
<p>who won&rsquo;t touch a receipt at a store</p>
<p>because of the BPAs that are on the inks of the,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t care about those things.</p>
<p>It is a fascinating area,</p>
<p>and I hope that more biology will be done there soon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to briefly return to stress.</p>
<p>You described a study once about two rats,</p>
<p>one running on a wheel voluntarily,</p>
<p>one who&rsquo;s basically stuck in a running wheel</p>
<p>and is forced to run anytime rat number one runs.</p>
<p>So in one case, the rat is voluntarily exercising,</p>
<p>and in the other case,</p>
<p>the rat is being forced to go to PE class, so to speak,</p>
<p>but really, and seeing divergent effects on biology.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to just touch into this</p>
<p>and use it as kind of a case study</p>
<p>for stress mitigation in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rather obsessed in our colleague, David Spiegel,</p>
<p>Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford,</p>
<p>is obsessed with this question of how humans</p>
<p>can start to mitigate their own stress.</p>
<p>What do you think about stress mitigation</p>
<p>and what should we do as individuals and as families</p>
<p>and as a culture to try and encourage people</p>
<p>to mitigate their stress,</p>
<p>but in ways that are not going to turn us</p>
<p>into rat number two,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re being forced to mitigate our own stress</p>
<p>and therefore becomes more stressful?</p>
<p>And what you see is rat number one</p>
<p>gets all the benefits of exercise.</p>
<p>Rat number two gets all the downsides of severe stress</p>
<p>with the same exact muscle expenditure</p>
<p>and movements going on, perfectly yoked.</p>
<p>Great example that it&rsquo;s the interpretation in your head.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t kept up with that literature,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll bet you rat number two</p>
<p>is having a whole lot more activity in its amygdala</p>
<p>than is rat number one.</p>
<p>Okay, so stress mitigation.</p>
<p>Anything I should say here,</p>
<p>I should preface with I&rsquo;m reasonably good at telling people</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen if they don&rsquo;t manage their stress,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m terrible at actually like managing stress</p>
<p>or advising how to manage it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much better with the bad news aspect of it.</p>
<p>But what you see is by now just a classic literature,</p>
<p>half a century old,</p>
<p>sort of showing what are the building blocks of stress.</p>
<p>Not, ooh, you step outside</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been gored by an elephant</p>
<p>and can you grow from your experience</p>
<p>and what doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger.</p>
<p>You could have a stress response,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re in the realm of the gray zone</p>
<p>of ambiguous social interactions, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Some people have massive stress responses,</p>
<p>others not at all in between, enjoy it.</p>
<p>Like what are the building blocks</p>
<p>of what makes psychological stress stressful?</p>
<p>And the first one is exactly what is brought up</p>
<p>by that running study.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of control?</p>
<p>A sense of control makes stressors less stressful.</p>
<p>And the running wheel shows that</p>
<p>or studies where you, you lab rat</p>
<p>or you college freshmen volunteer</p>
<p>have been trained that by pressing a lever,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re less likely to get a shock.</p>
<p>And today you&rsquo;re at the lever,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re working away and unbeknownst to you,</p>
<p>the lever has been turned off</p>
<p>and it has no effect on shock frequency,</p>
<p>but because you think you have some control,</p>
<p>you have less of a stress response.</p>
<p>If you were a rat and doing this day in and day out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re less likely to get an ulcer.</p>
<p>So a sense of control.</p>
<p>Related to that is a sense of predictability.</p>
<p>Rat gets shocked, human gets shocked, whatever.</p>
<p>And the scenario either is the shocks come now and then</p>
<p>or the shocks come now and then</p>
<p>and 10 seconds before a little warning light comes on.</p>
<p>And when you get the warning light,</p>
<p>the shocks aren&rsquo;t as stressful.</p>
<p>You got predictability</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re not getting warning lights,</p>
<p>any second you could be a half second away</p>
<p>from the next shock, you get a warning light</p>
<p>and you know that if there isn&rsquo;t one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got at least 10 seconds worth of relaxation.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>you can prepare your coping responses.</p>
<p>And best of all, afterward,</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re finally safe,</p>
<p>when you can recover from it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s enormously protective.</p>
<p>Others, outlet for frustration.</p>
<p>You take a rat who&rsquo;s getting shocked</p>
<p>and if it could run on a running wheel,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a protective thing.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s doing it voluntarily.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a rat and it can gnaw on a bar of wood,</p>
<p>a stressor is less stressful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you have a rat or primate or human</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>the ability to aggressively dump</p>
<p>on somebody smaller and weaker</p>
<p>also reduces the stress response</p>
<p>and the fact that displacement aggression reduces stress</p>
<p>accounts for a huge percentage of Earth&rsquo;s like unhappiness.</p>
<p>So all of those variables get social support as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>Interpreting circumstances as being good news</p>
<p>rather than bad.</p>
<p>Hooray.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this very simple sort of like take home recipe</p>
<p>of go out and get as much control</p>
<p>and as much predictability and as many outlets</p>
<p>and as much social support as possible.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna do just fine.</p>
<p>And you go out and do that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a recipe for total disaster.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s much, much more subtle than that.</p>
<p>One great example.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re getting shocked.</p>
<p>You want a warning beforehand.</p>
<p>Get a little warning light 10 seconds before each shock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderfully protective.</p>
<p>Get a warning shock.</p>
<p>Get a warning light one second before the shock.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough time for you</p>
<p>to get the psychological benefits of the anticipation.</p>
<p>Now instead, get the little warning</p>
<p>coming on two minutes before each shock</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna make things worse</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not gonna be sitting there</p>
<p>like reveling in sort of your sense of predictability</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s soon gonna be over.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be sitting there for two minutes</p>
<p>saying, damn, here it comes.</p>
<p>Predictive information only works in a narrow domain.</p>
<p>Similarly, control.</p>
<p>Do you wanna have a sense of control in the face of stress?</p>
<p>And the answer is only if it is a mild to moderate stressor</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s happening then,</p>
<p>your sense of control is completely independent</p>
<p>of the reality of whether you have control or not.</p>
<p>But in the face of mild to moderate stressors,</p>
<p>a sense of control gets interpreted as,</p>
<p>wow, look how much worse things could have been.</p>
<p>Thank God I have control.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on top of this mastermind fate.</p>
<p>In contrast, if it&rsquo;s a major stressor,</p>
<p>all that arbitrary sense of control does</p>
<p>is make you think, oh my God,</p>
<p>look how much better it could have been.</p>
<p>I could have prevented it.</p>
<p>And we all know that intuitively,</p>
<p>like we do that in the face of people&rsquo;s worst stressors.</p>
<p>Nobody could have stopped the car</p>
<p>the way the kid suddenly jumped out.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered if you had gotten them</p>
<p>to the doctor a month ago instead of now.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t have made me,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t actually have any control.</p>
<p>And what you see is,</p>
<p>you absolutely wanna have a huge sense of control</p>
<p>over mild to moderate stressors,</p>
<p>and especially ones that result in a good outcome.</p>
<p>Hooray for me.</p>
<p>And in the face of horrible stressors,</p>
<p>what you wanna do is like self-deception</p>
<p>and like truth and beauty don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>go hand in hand at that point.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why stress management techniques</p>
<p>about control and predictability</p>
<p>wind up being far worse than neutral</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re preaching that to somebody homeless</p>
<p>or somebody with terminal cancer</p>
<p>or somebody who&rsquo;s a refugee.</p>
<p>Tell a neurotic middle-class person</p>
<p>that they have the psychological tools</p>
<p>to turn hell into heaven.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some truth to that.</p>
<p>Do the same thing to somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going through a real hell.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just privileged heartlessness to do that</p>
<p>because that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>More and more, outlets, if your outlets are damaging,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a good way to mitigate stress.</p>
<p>Social support, if you&rsquo;re confusing mere acquaintances</p>
<p>for real social support,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have the rug pulled out</p>
<p>from under you at some point.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re mistaking social support</p>
<p>for being going and bitching and moaning</p>
<p>and demanding supportiveness from everyone around you,</p>
<p>rather than you doing some of that reciprocally,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna work very well either.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s not simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for nothing that lots of us are really lousy</p>
<p>at being good friends and things like that</p>
<p>and why it takes a lot of work to do it right</p>
<p>because you do it wrong</p>
<p>and it may temporarily seem like a great thing,</p>
<p>but when it turns out to be completely misplaced faith,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be feeling worse than before you started.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>These days, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest</p>
<p>in using physical practices to mitigate stress,</p>
<p>you know, trying to get out of the ruminating</p>
<p>and to some extent, take control of neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain by using exercise and using breathing</p>
<p>and hypnosis and of course,</p>
<p>hypnosis has a mental component as well.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on stress mitigation</p>
<p>from the standpoint of,</p>
<p>okay, so we don&rsquo;t want to be rat number two,</p>
<p>we want to select something for ourselves.</p>
<p>So we have to take the initiative for ourselves.</p>
<p>Being forced into exercising is not,</p>
<p>it could actually have negative health effects, perhaps.</p>
<p>So we need to pick something that we like,</p>
<p>we need to take control of it.</p>
<p>In terms of supporting other people,</p>
<p>you touched on that a bit.</p>
<p>What is the best way to support other people?</p>
<p>Is it to talk about the stressful thing?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not asking you to play psychologist here,</p>
<p>but I find divergent data on this.</p>
<p>You know, we can spin ourselves up into a lather</p>
<p>by ruminating on something and language seems to me</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a wonderful tool,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a fairly deprived tool</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t really get into the core</p>
<p>of our physiology like something like breathing would.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on more,</p>
<p>for lack of a better way to put it,</p>
<p>more head-centered cognitive approaches</p>
<p>to stress mitigation versus kind of</p>
<p>going at the core physiology?</p>
<p>Cold showers now are even a thing to some extent,</p>
<p>you know, just to get people stress acclimated,</p>
<p>voluntarily taking cold showers, you know?</p>
<p>That makes some sense physiologically preconditioning</p>
<p>for when the real stressors come.</p>
<p>In terms of what you bring up,</p>
<p>transcendental meditation, mindfulness, exercise, prayer,</p>
<p>sort of reflecting on gratitude, all that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Collectively, they work on the average.</p>
<p>They work in terms of they can lower heart rate</p>
<p>and cholesterol levels and have all sorts of good outcomes,</p>
<p>but they come with provisos.</p>
<p>One is exactly the caveat that comes out</p>
<p>of the running wheel study is it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>how many of your friends swear</p>
<p>by this stress management technique.</p>
<p>If doing it makes you wanna scream your head off</p>
<p>after 10 seconds, that&rsquo;s not the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna work for you.</p>
<p>So, you know, read the fine print and the testimonials,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gotta be something that works for you.</p>
<p>Another one is the stress management type techniques</p>
<p>that work, you can&rsquo;t save them for the weekend.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t save them for when you&rsquo;re stuck on hold</p>
<p>on the phone with Muzak for two minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be something where you stop what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and do it virtually daily or every other day</p>
<p>and spend 20, 30 minutes doing it.</p>
<p>And what you see coming out of that</p>
<p>is this like 80-20 rule from economics.</p>
<p>80-20, 80% of the complaints in the store</p>
<p>come from 20% of the customers, things like that.</p>
<p>What you see is if your entire life consists</p>
<p>of every single thing on your shoulders</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t say no to 24-7,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve stopped that and finally said,</p>
<p>my wellbeing is important enough</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m finally gonna say no to some of the stuff</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t say no to,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna do it every day for 20 minutes,</p>
<p>whatever stress management technique you then do</p>
<p>in those 20 minutes, short of who knows what,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already 80% of the way there</p>
<p>simply by having decided your wellbeing is important enough</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna stop every single day</p>
<p>and have that as a priority.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly the same finding</p>
<p>that you find people with chronic depression untreated</p>
<p>that merely calling and getting an appointment</p>
<p>to see a mental health professional,</p>
<p>people start feeling better already</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s evidence that you&rsquo;ve been activated</p>
<p>and you matter enough to do this</p>
<p>and you could conceive that this would actually</p>
<p>have a good outcome rather than a hopeless one.</p>
<p>Just doing something meditative or reflective</p>
<p>every day or so,</p>
<p>and it hardly even matters which one you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And what comes out of that is thus another warning,</p>
<p>which is do not trust anybody</p>
<p>who says it has been scientifically proven</p>
<p>that their brand of stress management</p>
<p>works better than the other ones.</p>
<p>Just watch your wallet at that point.</p>
<p>Yeah, amen.</p>
<p>I think one of the core goals of my lab</p>
<p>and David Spiegel&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>and I know you&rsquo;ve worked with David</p>
<p>and published papers with David as well,</p>
<p>is to really try and find out</p>
<p>what are the various entry points to this thing</p>
<p>that we call the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and the stress system and these systems</p>
<p>that when gone unchecked</p>
<p>really can take us down a dark path.</p>
<p>And the idea that there are so many entry points</p>
<p>is really the one that keeps,</p>
<p>what the data keep telling us over and over again.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no magic breathing tool or exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s any variety of those or one of those.</p>
<p>And again, we come back to this idea</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the one that you select</p>
<p>and the one that you make space for,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the one that you hopefully enjoy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to work best in terms of physiology.</p>
<p>I am one that&rsquo;s benign for those people</p>
<p>who were stuck around you.</p>
<p>Right, right, absolutely.</p>
<p>And that brings me to this question of,</p>
<p>I find it amazing that how we perceive an event</p>
<p>and whether or not we chose to be in that event or not</p>
<p>can have such incredibly different effects</p>
<p>on circuitry of the brain and circuitry of the body</p>
<p>and biology of cells.</p>
<p>And in some ways it boggles my mind.</p>
<p>Like how can a decision made presumably</p>
<p>with the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>although other parts of the brain as well,</p>
<p>how can that change essentially the polarity</p>
<p>of a response in the body?</p>
<p>And I mean, you&rsquo;ve talked before about type A personalities</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have to go into all the detail there</p>
<p>for sake of time,</p>
<p>but it is interesting that the effects of endothelial cells,</p>
<p>I mean, literally of the size of the portals for blood</p>
<p>are in opposite direction,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not somebody</p>
<p>wants to be in a situation as a highly motivated person.</p>
<p>Maybe you could just give us the top contour</p>
<p>of that because I think it really illustrates</p>
<p>this principle so beautifully.</p>
<p>And then maybe if you would,</p>
<p>you could just speculate on how the brain</p>
<p>might have this switch to turn one experience</p>
<p>from terrible to beneficial or from beneficial to terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, all you need to do is like tonight</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;re going to sleep and you&rsquo;re lying in bed</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re nice and drowsy</p>
<p>and your heart&rsquo;s beating nice and slow,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start thinking about the fact that,</p>
<p>that heart isn&rsquo;t going to beat forever.</p>
<p>And imagine your toes getting cold afterward</p>
<p>and imagine the flow of blood coming to a halt</p>
<p>and all of you clotting.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be doing something with your physiology</p>
<p>at that point that 99% of mammals out there</p>
<p>only do if they&rsquo;re running frantically.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna be turning on</p>
<p>your sympathetic stress response with thought,</p>
<p>with emotions, with memory.</p>
<p>And the measure of that is just how much the cortex</p>
<p>and the limbic system sends projections</p>
<p>down to all the autonomic regulators in the brain.</p>
<p>You can think autonomic regulatory neurons into action</p>
<p>in ways that only other animals can do</p>
<p>with like extremes of environmental circumstances.</p>
<p>Given that and the autonomic role,</p>
<p>I mean, the other big challenge in understanding it</p>
<p>is gigantic individual differences.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>we talk about the optimal amount of stress</p>
<p>that counts as stimulation.</p>
<p>And in general, that stress that&rsquo;s not too severe</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t go on for too long</p>
<p>and is overall in a benevolent setting.</p>
<p>And under those conditions,</p>
<p>we love being stressed by something unexpected</p>
<p>and out of control and predictability</p>
<p>like a really interesting plot turn</p>
<p>in the movie you&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great, but you get the individual differences</p>
<p>that somehow has to accommodate the fact that</p>
<p>for some people, the perfect stimulatory amount of stress</p>
<p>is like getting up early for an Audubon bird watching walk</p>
<p>next Sunday morning.</p>
<p>And for somebody else,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s signing up to be like a mercenary in Yemen.</p>
<p>Tremendous individual differences</p>
<p>that swamp any simple, you know, prescriptions.</p>
<p>Yeah, the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>this thinking machinery that we all harbor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s remarkable to me is how the areas of the brain,</p>
<p>like the hypothalamus and the amygdala,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sort of like switches.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s context and there&rsquo;s gain control.</p>
<p>You talked about the gain control by testosterone,</p>
<p>et cetera, but they&rsquo;re really like switches.</p>
<p>I mean, if you stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus,</p>
<p>you get the right neurons,</p>
<p>an animal will try and kill even an object</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sitting next to it.</p>
<p>You tickle some other neurons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll try and mate with that same object.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really wild.</p>
<p>I think there are probably rules to prefrontal cortex also,</p>
<p>but it sounds like the context plural</p>
<p>from which prefrontal cortex can draw from</p>
<p>is probably infinite,</p>
<p>so that we could probably learn to perceive threat</p>
<p>in anything, whether or not it&rsquo;s another group</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s science</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s version</p>
<p>of the shape of the earth versus another.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like you can plug in anything to this system</p>
<p>and give it enough data.</p>
<p>And I think it sounds like you could drive a fear response</p>
<p>or a love response.</p>
<p>Is that overstepping?</p>
<p>Or a mixed, horribly ambivalent one</p>
<p>that does changing by the millisecond</p>
<p>and then mutually contradictory?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s absolutely the case.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>I more than once have regretted</p>
<p>having wasted 30 years of my life studying the hippocampus</p>
<p>when I should have been studying the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so much more interesting what it does,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all this contextual stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the ways in which it&rsquo;s not okay to lie</p>
<p>in this setting, but it&rsquo;s a great thing in another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not okay to kill unless you do it to them,</p>
<p>and then you get a medal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all of this social context and moral relativity</p>
<p>and situational ethics stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the prefrontal cortex that&rsquo;s got to master that.</p>
<p>And that winds up meaning that&rsquo;s the place in your brain</p>
<p>more than anywhere where you say your perception of things</p>
<p>can powerfully influence the reality</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s coming into you.</p>
<p>Great example, just harking back to testosterone.</p>
<p>Okay, so exercise boosts up testosterone levels.</p>
<p>Does exercise and success do it more than exercise?</p>
<p>And failure of literature back in the 80s or so,</p>
<p>looking at outcomes of marathons,</p>
<p>did testosterone rise more in the people who win</p>
<p>than the losers?</p>
<p>Wrestling matches, things of that sort,</p>
<p>with a simple prediction, and the answer wound up being</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t see a simple answer.</p>
<p>Okay, you win the marathon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily an increase,</p>
<p>a predictor of increased testosterone.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>And then you find the winner, testosterone decreases,</p>
<p>and you find out the guy who came in 73rd</p>
<p>is having a massive testosterone increase.</p>
<p>Whoa, what&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that about is far more human subtlety.</p>
<p>The guy who won the race has a decline in testosterone</p>
<p>because he came in three minutes later</p>
<p>than he really, really was expecting,</p>
<p>and everybody now is gonna be writing it up</p>
<p>about how he&rsquo;s over the hill.</p>
<p>And the guy who came in 73rd is having a boost of testosterone</p>
<p>because he was assuming he&rsquo;d be dead from a heart attack</p>
<p>by the third mile, and instead he managed to finish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this interpretive stuff going on in there,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what prefrontal cortex is about.</p>
<p>Amazing, it raises this question of cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>Can we tell ourselves that something is good for us</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re not enjoying it?</p>
<p>And can we wriggle around these corners</p>
<p>of choosing the exercise or doing the&hellip;</p>
<p>I personally am not a big fan of long bouts of meditation,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve benefited tremendously from things</p>
<p>like dedicated breathing and shorter rounds of meditation.</p>
<p>Can I tell myself that it&rsquo;s good for me</p>
<p>and wriggle around the corner</p>
<p>and get my physiology working the way I want?</p>
<p>Do we have cognitive flexibility?</p>
<p>Can I be that third place runner and tell myself,</p>
<p>well, at least I came in, I wanted to win so badly.</p>
<p>That was my primary goal,</p>
<p>but another goal was to beat my previous time,</p>
<p>and I did do that.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, to what extent can we toggle</p>
<p>this relationship between the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and these other more primitive systems?</p>
<p>Oh, an enormous amount.</p>
<p>For example, being low in a hierarchy</p>
<p>is generally bad for health</p>
<p>and like every mammal out there, including us,</p>
<p>but we do something special,</p>
<p>which is we can be part of multiple hierarchies</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>And while you may be low ranking in one of them,</p>
<p>you could be extremely high ranking in another.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like have the crappiest job in your corporation,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re the captain of the team softball,</p>
<p>of the softball team this year for the company.</p>
<p>And you better bet that&rsquo;s somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna find all sorts of ways</p>
<p>to decide that nine to five Monday to Friday</p>
<p>is just stupid paying the bills.</p>
<p>And what really matters is the prestige on the weekend.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re poor, but you&rsquo;re the deacon of your church</p>
<p>and so we can play all sorts of psychological games</p>
<p>with that.</p>
<p>One of the most like consistent, reliable ones</p>
<p>that we do and need to use the frontal cortex like crazy</p>
<p>is somebody does something rotten</p>
<p>and you need to attribute it.</p>
<p>And the answer is they did something rotten</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re rotten.</p>
<p>Always have been, always will be</p>
<p>this constitutional explanation.</p>
<p>You do something rotten to somebody</p>
<p>and how do you explain it afterward?</p>
<p>A situational one.</p>
<p>I was tired, I was stressed in this sort of setting,</p>
<p>I misunderstood this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re best at excusing ourselves from bad things</p>
<p>because we have access to our inner lives</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got prefrontal cortexes</p>
<p>that are great at coming up with a situational explanation</p>
<p>rather than, hey, maybe you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>a selfish rotten human and you need to change.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and we do that every time we don&rsquo;t let somebody</p>
<p>merge in the lane in front of us,</p>
<p>even though you curse somebody</p>
<p>who does the same thing to you endlessly.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Your statement about the fact that we can select</p>
<p>multiple hierarchies to participate in,</p>
<p>to me seems like a particularly important one nowadays</p>
<p>with social media being so prevalent.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re not particularly active on social media,</p>
<p>although you might be pleasantly or I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>unpleasantly surprised to find out</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of positive discussion</p>
<p>about you and your work.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t even need to be on there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just continue to discuss your work.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting about social media I found</p>
<p>is that the context is very, very broad.</p>
<p>I mean, one could argue that who one selects to follow</p>
<p>and which news articles you&rsquo;re reading, et cetera,</p>
<p>can create a kind of a funneling of information</p>
<p>that itself can be dangerous.</p>
<p>More verification of crazy ideas</p>
<p>or even just less exposure to new ideas.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also this idea that social media</p>
<p>is an incredibly broad context.</p>
<p>So as you scroll through a feed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer like being in your eighth grade classroom</p>
<p>or your office or your faculty meeting.</p>
<p>You are being exposed to thousands,</p>
<p>if not millions of contexts.</p>
<p>This meal, that soccer game, this person&rsquo;s body,</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s intellect.</p>
<p>YouTube is another example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vast, vast landscape.</p>
<p>And so the context is completely mishmash.</p>
<p>Whereas I&rsquo;m assuming we evolved, I think we did evolve</p>
<p>under contexts that were much more constrained.</p>
<p>We interacted with a limited number of individuals</p>
<p>and a limited number of different domains.</p>
<p>Seasons tended to constrain us all.</p>
<p>And of course, then we got phones and televisions</p>
<p>and this started to expand.</p>
<p>But now more than ever, our brain,</p>
<p>our prefrontal cortex, and our sense of where we exist</p>
<p>in these multiple hierarchies</p>
<p>has essentially wicked out into infinity.</p>
<p>How do you think this might be interacting</p>
<p>with some of these more primitive systems</p>
<p>and other aspects of our biology?</p>
<p>Well, I think what you get is in some ways,</p>
<p>the punchline of what&rsquo;s most human about humans,</p>
<p>which is over and over, we use the exact same blueprint,</p>
<p>the same hormones, the same kinases, the same receptors,</p>
<p>the same everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re built out of the exact same stuff</p>
<p>as all these other species out there.</p>
<p>And then we go and use it in a completely novel way.</p>
<p>And usually in terms of being able to abstract stuff</p>
<p>over space and time and dramatic ways.</p>
<p>So, okay, you&rsquo;re a low ranking baboon</p>
<p>and you can feel badly because you just like killed a rabbit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re about to eat and some higher ranking guy boots you</p>
<p>off and takes it away from you.</p>
<p>And you feel crummy and it&rsquo;s stressful and you&rsquo;re unhappy.</p>
<p>We are doing the exact same things</p>
<p>with like our brain and bodies</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re losing a sense of self-esteem.</p>
<p>But we can do it by watching a movie character on the screen</p>
<p>and feeling inadequate compared to like how wonderful</p>
<p>or attractive they are.</p>
<p>We can do it by somebody driving past us in an expensive car</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t even see their face.</p>
<p>And you can feel belittled</p>
<p>by your own socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>You can watch like the lifestyles of the rich and famous</p>
<p>or read about what Bezos is up to.</p>
<p>And for some reason decide your life is less fulfilling</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t fly into space for 11 minutes.</p>
<p>And so you can feel miserable about yourself</p>
<p>in ways that no other organism can,</p>
<p>simply because we can have our meaningful social networks</p>
<p>include like the party you&rsquo;re reading about on Facebook</p>
<p>that you weren&rsquo;t invited to</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s taking place in Singapore</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know any of those people.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, somehow that could be a means</p>
<p>for you to feel less content</p>
<p>with who you&rsquo;ve turned out to be.</p>
<p>Do you take steps in your own life</p>
<p>to actively restrict the context in which you think</p>
<p>and live and contemplate in order to enhance</p>
<p>your creative life, your intellectual life?</p>
<p>Are those steps that you actively take?</p>
<p>Well, I very actively don&rsquo;t know how to make use</p>
<p>of anything with social media.</p>
<p>So I guess that counts as my having thus actively chosen</p>
<p>not to learn how.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the case certainly for the last year and a half,</p>
<p>like lots of people, I&rsquo;ve gone through stretches</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve managed to sort of enforce a moratorium</p>
<p>on looking at the news.</p>
<p>And that was wonderfully freeing.</p>
<p>I think in the larger sense though,</p>
<p>in addition to me being a neurobiologist,</p>
<p>I sort of spent decades spending part of each year</p>
<p>studying wild baboons out in a national park in East Africa.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d spend three months a year without electricity,</p>
<p>without phone calls, with going 12 hours a day</p>
<p>without saying a word to somebody.</p>
<p>And when I finally would, it would be somebody,</p>
<p>nomadic pastoralist guy in a different language.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did 90% of my like insightful thinking</p>
<p>about anything in the laboratory</p>
<p>during those three months each year</p>
<p>and not when in the lab and not when inundated with stuff.</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s sort of a shifting trend</p>
<p>towards trying to create a narrowing of context</p>
<p>that people, and I like what I see.</p>
<p>I have a niece, she&rsquo;s 14 years old</p>
<p>and she and her friends are very good</p>
<p>at putting their phones away.</p>
<p>They say, we&rsquo;re not going to have our phones</p>
<p>for this interaction, especially after,</p>
<p>and I realize we&rsquo;re still somewhat in this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear where it&rsquo;s headed,</p>
<p>but at 2020 was so restrictive</p>
<p>and she was so separated from her friends.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s really focus on being together</p>
<p>and not bring in all these other elements from our phones.</p>
<p>And that brings me great hope for that generation.</p>
<p>Maybe they will, or who knows,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;ll run off and study baboons.</p>
<p>We need more field researchers.</p>
<p>So along the lines of choice,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to shift gears slightly and talk about free will,</p>
<p>about our ability to make choices at all.</p>
<p>Well, my personal way out and left field inflammatory stance</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t think we have a shred of free will.</p>
<p>Despite 95% of philosophers,</p>
<p>and I think probably the majority of neuroscientists</p>
<p>saying that we have free will</p>
<p>in at least some circumstances,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any at all.</p>
<p>And the reason for this is you do something,</p>
<p>you behave, you make a choice, whatever.</p>
<p>And to understand why you did that,</p>
<p>where did that intention come from?</p>
<p>Part of it was due to like the sensory environment</p>
<p>you were in in the previous minute.</p>
<p>Some of it is from the hormone levels</p>
<p>in your bloodstream that morning.</p>
<p>Some of it is from whether you had a wonderful</p>
<p>or stressful last three months</p>
<p>and what sort of neuroplasticity happened.</p>
<p>Part of it is what hormone levels</p>
<p>you were exposed to as a fetus.</p>
<p>Part of it is what culture your ancestors came up with</p>
<p>and thus how you were parented when you were a kid.</p>
<p>All of those are in there</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t understand where behavior is coming from</p>
<p>without incorporating all of those.</p>
<p>And at that point,</p>
<p>not only are there all of these relevant factors,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re ultimately all one factor.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about what evolution</p>
<p>has to do with your behavior,</p>
<p>by definition, you&rsquo;re also talking about genetics.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about what your genes</p>
<p>have to do with behavior,</p>
<p>by definition, you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>how your brain was constructed</p>
<p>or what proteins are coded for.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about like your mood disorder now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about the sense of efficacy</p>
<p>you were getting as a five-year-old,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all intertwined.</p>
<p>And when you look at all those influences,</p>
<p>basically, like the challenge is,</p>
<p>show me a neuron that just caused that behavior</p>
<p>or show me a network of neurons</p>
<p>that just caused that behavior</p>
<p>and show me that nothing about what they just did</p>
<p>was influenced by anything from the sensory environment</p>
<p>one second ago to the evolution of your species.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no space in there to fit in</p>
<p>a free will concept that winds up being in your brain,</p>
<p>but not of your brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no wiggle room for it there.</p>
<p>So I can appreciate that our behaviors</p>
<p>and our choices are the consequence</p>
<p>of a long line of dominoes</p>
<p>that fell prior to that behavior.</p>
<p>But is it possible that I can intervene</p>
<p>in the domino effect, so to speak?</p>
<p>In other words, can my recognition of the fact</p>
<p>that genes have heritability, there&rsquo;s an epigenome,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a hormonal context,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a historical context,</p>
<p>can the knowledge of that give me some small,</p>
<p>small shard of free will?</p>
<p>Meaning does it allow me to say, ah, okay,</p>
<p>I accept that my choices are somewhat predetermined</p>
<p>and yet knowing that gives me</p>
<p>some additional layer of control.</p>
<p>Is there any philosophical or biological universe</p>
<p>in which that works?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>All of that can produce the wonderfully positive belief</p>
<p>that change can happen.</p>
<p>Even dramatic change, even in the worst of circumstances,</p>
<p>most unlikely people, and change can happen.</p>
<p>Things can change.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fatalistic, don&rsquo;t decide,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re mechanistic biological machines</p>
<p>that nothing can ever, change can happen.</p>
<p>But where people go off the rails</p>
<p>is translating that into, we can change ourselves.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, we can&rsquo;t, because there&rsquo;s no free will.</p>
<p>However, we can be changed by circumstance.</p>
<p>And the point of it is, like, you look at an aplesia,</p>
<p>a sea slug that has learned to retract its gill</p>
<p>in response to a shock on its tail.</p>
<p>You can do, like, conditioning,</p>
<p>Pavlovian conditioning on it,</p>
<p>and it has learned its behavior</p>
<p>has been changed by its environment.</p>
<p>And you hear news about something</p>
<p>like horrifically depressing going on,</p>
<p>and, you know, refugees in wherever,</p>
<p>and as a result, you feel a little bit more helpless</p>
<p>and a less of a sense of efficacy in the world,</p>
<p>and both of your behaviors have been changed.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, yeah, I guess that,</p>
<p>but the remarkable thing is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the exact same neurobiology.</p>
<p>The signal transduction pathways that were happening</p>
<p>in that sea snail incorporate the exact same kinases</p>
<p>and proteases and phosphatases that we do</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re having mammalian fear conditioning,</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s conserved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the exact same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply playing out in, obviously,</p>
<p>a much, much fancier domain.</p>
<p>And because you have learned that change is possible,</p>
<p>despite understanding mechanistically</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t change ourselves volitionally,</p>
<p>but because you understand change is possible,</p>
<p>you have just changed the ability of your brain</p>
<p>to respond to optimistic stimuli,</p>
<p>and you have changed the ability of your brain</p>
<p>to now send you in the direction</p>
<p>of being exposed to more information</p>
<p>that will seem cheerful rather than depressing.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that&rsquo;s amazing what Nelson Mandela</p>
<p>and Martin Luther King and all these folks did.</p>
<p>Wow, under the most adverse of circumstances,</p>
<p>they were able to do, maybe I can also.</p>
<p>Maybe I can go read more about people like them</p>
<p>to get even more data points of change to neurochemistry</p>
<p>so that your responses are different now.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re tilted a little bit more in that direction</p>
<p>of feeling like you can make a difference</p>
<p>instead of it&rsquo;s all damn hopeless.</p>
<p>So enormous change can happen,</p>
<p>but the last thing that can come out of a view</p>
<p>of we are nothing more or less than the sum of our biology</p>
<p>and this interaction with environment</p>
<p>is to throw up your hands and say,</p>
<p>and thus it&rsquo;s no use trying to change anything.</p>
<p>So we can acknowledge that change</p>
<p>is extremely hard to impossible,</p>
<p>that circumstances can change,</p>
<p>and yet that striving to be better human beings</p>
<p>is still a worthwhile endeavor.</p>
<p>Do I have that correct?</p>
<p>Absolutely, because simply the knowledge</p>
<p>either from experience or making it to the end</p>
<p>of the right neurobiology class has taught you</p>
<p>that change can happen within a framework</p>
<p>of a mechanistic neurobiology.</p>
<p>You are now more open to being made optimistic</p>
<p>by the good news in the world around you.</p>
<p>You are more likely to be inspired by this or that.</p>
<p>You are more resistant to getting discouraged by bad news</p>
<p>simply because you now understand it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, as somebody who spent much of his career</p>
<p>working on the hippocampus,</p>
<p>I have to assume that you are a believer in neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>that neural circuits can change in response to experience</p>
<p>and that some of the same so-called top-down mechanisms</p>
<p>of prefrontal cortex that we were talking about before</p>
<p>can play a role there,</p>
<p>that the decision to try and change</p>
<p>and the pursuit of knowledge and the pursuit of experience</p>
<p>can shape our circuitry</p>
<p>and therefore make us different machines, so to speak.</p>
<p>Yeah, and not only can, say, prenatal hormone exposure</p>
<p>change the way your brain is being constructed,</p>
<p>but learning that prenatal hormone exposure</p>
<p>can change the construction of your brain</p>
<p>will change your brain right now</p>
<p>and how you think about where your intentions came from.</p>
<p>Wow, maybe that had something to do with it.</p>
<p>The knowledge of the knowledge</p>
<p>is an effector in and of itself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an important and powerful statement to hear.</p>
<p>I think that many people think that if a tool,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t involve a pill or a protocol that it&rsquo;s useless,</p>
<p>and certainly there are pills and protocols</p>
<p>that are very useful in a variety of contexts</p>
<p>for a variety of things,</p>
<p>but the idea that knowledge itself,</p>
<p>or as you put it, knowledge of knowledge is itself a tool,</p>
<p>I think is a very important concept</p>
<p>for people to embed in their minds.</p>
<p>And listen, I&rsquo;m so grateful for this discussion</p>
<p>and for you raising these topics.</p>
<p>I think that people,</p>
<p>many people know your work on testosterone, on stress,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve covered some of that today.</p>
<p>The work on free will and this idea that we are hopeless</p>
<p>or that we are in total control,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m realizing in listening to you</p>
<p>that neither is true</p>
<p>and that the solution resides in understanding</p>
<p>more about free will and lack of it and also neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working on a book about free will.</p>
<p>Are you willing to tell us a little bit about that book</p>
<p>and where you are in that process</p>
<p>and what we can look forward to?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s going really slow.</p>
<p>Title is determined,</p>
<p>A Science of Life Without Free Will.</p>
<p>And essentially the first half of the book</p>
<p>is trying to convince a reader,</p>
<p>okay, if not that there&rsquo;s no free will whatsoever,</p>
<p>but at least there&rsquo;s a lot less than is normally assumed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going through all the standard arguments</p>
<p>for free will and why that doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>with 21st century science.</p>
<p>And that has led to reading a lot</p>
<p>of very frustrating philosophers</p>
<p>who basically are willing to admit</p>
<p>that stuff is made out of like atoms and molecules</p>
<p>and like there&rsquo;s a physical reality to the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just relying on magic,</p>
<p>but that they believe in free will for magical reasons</p>
<p>and where it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Okay, so the first half of the book</p>
<p>is to hopefully convince people</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s much less free will than we used to think.</p>
<p>And then the second half is this gigantic juncture</p>
<p>built around the fact that I haven&rsquo;t thought</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any free will since I was like an adolescent.</p>
<p>And despite thinking that way,</p>
<p>I still have absolutely no idea</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re supposed to function with that belief.</p>
<p>How are you supposed to like go about everyday life</p>
<p>if anything you feel entitled to isn&rsquo;t true,</p>
<p>if any angers and hatreds you feel aren&rsquo;t justified,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no such thing as appropriate,</p>
<p>blame or punishment or praise or reward,</p>
<p>and none of it makes any sense.</p>
<p>And somebody like even compliments you on your haircut</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been conditioned to like say,</p>
<p>oh, thanks as if you had something to do.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to function with that?</p>
<p>And so the second half is wrestling with that.</p>
<p>And what the punchline there is,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s gonna be incredibly hard.</p>
<p>And if you think it&rsquo;s gonna be hard</p>
<p>to subtract a notion of free will</p>
<p>out of making sense of like serial murderers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a thousand times harder</p>
<p>of making sense of when somebody says good job to you.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s the exact same unreality</p>
<p>of sort of our interpretations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be incredibly hard.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, when you look at the history</p>
<p>of how we have subtracted the notion of agency</p>
<p>out of all sorts of realms of blame,</p>
<p>starting with thinking that witches caused hailstorms</p>
<p>500 years ago to the notion</p>
<p>that psychodynamically screwed up mothers</p>
<p>cause schizophrenia, we&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done it endless number of times.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to subtract out a sense of volition</p>
<p>in understanding how the world works around us.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have murderers running amok on the street</p>
<p>and society hasn&rsquo;t collapsed into a puddle.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s a more humane society.</p>
<p>So the good news is it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve done it repeatedly in the past,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna be hard as hell.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard as hell to try to write</p>
<p>about that coherently I&rsquo;m discovering.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going slowly.</p>
<p>Well, I speak for many, many people</p>
<p>when I say that we&rsquo;re really excited</p>
<p>for the book when it&rsquo;s done and we will patiently wait,</p>
<p>but with great excitement for the book,</p>
<p>Determined, you said is the title, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, Determined, the Science of Life Without Free Will.</p>
<p>Seems like you can&rsquo;t publish a book these days</p>
<p>without a subtitle, so that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Fantastic, well, very excited to read the book.</p>
<p>Very grateful to you for this conversation today.</p>
<p>I learned a ton.</p>
<p>Every time you speak, I learn.</p>
<p>And for me, it&rsquo;s really been a pleasure</p>
<p>and a delight to interact with you today</p>
<p>and over the previous years, I should say, as colleagues.</p>
<p>And thank you again, Robert, for everything that you do</p>
<p>and all the hard, hard work and thinking</p>
<p>that you put into your work,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s clear that you put a lot of hard work</p>
<p>and thinking and we all benefit as a consequence.</p>
<p>Thanks, and thanks for having me.</p>
<p>This was a blast.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for my conversation</p>
