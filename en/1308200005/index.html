    <p>Hello, dear listener. I&rsquo;m Megan, host of this series. And before we get into the show,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a minute to tell you about our sponsor, FIRE, the Foundation for Individual</p>
<p>Rights and Expression. We live in a moment when free speech, the bedrock of our democracy</p>
<p>and of all free societies, is often viewed as suspect, where many argue that the right</p>
<p>to free speech is too dangerous, and that even listening to ideological opponents is</p>
<p>morally wrong. Many people just don&rsquo;t see a problem with using the law, corporate power,</p>
<p>and even extraordinary social pressure to censor viewpoints they disagree with.</p>
<p>But many of us feel the costs of all this in our everyday lives. We feel it when we</p>
<p>self-censor, afraid to say what we really think, sometimes even in private conversations</p>
<p>with friends or loved ones. We feel it when we opt out of a growing number of public discussions,</p>
<p>afraid of the potential cost to our jobs and even our relationships.</p>
<p>FIRE shares a mission with this show, to remind us why a culture of free speech and open dialogue</p>
<p>matters. And regardless of how loud the calls for censorship are, FIRE&rsquo;s defense of that</p>
<p>culture is unshakable and invaluable. And if you want to remember why we choose freedom,</p>
<p>even for people we strenuously disagree with, you can learn more about FIRE&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>work at thefire.org. And now, on to the show.</p>
<p>This episode contains explicit language and references to sexual violence. It is not suitable</p>
<p>for young listeners.</p>
<p>So when I first became interested and then deeply troubled by what I saw as a cultural</p>
<p>movement that was illiberal in its methods and was very questionable in its ideas, I</p>
<p>absolutely knew that if I spoke out, many people who had loved my books would be deeply</p>
<p>unhappy with me. I knew that. I knew because I knew that they, I could see that they believed</p>
<p>they were living the values that I had espoused in those books. I could tell that they believed</p>
<p>they were fighting for underdogs and difference and fairness. And I thought it would be easier</p>
<p>not to. You know that this could be really bad. And honestly, it has been bad. Personally,</p>
<p>it has not been fun. And I have been scared at times for my own safety and I overwhelmingly</p>
<p>for my family&rsquo;s safety. Time will tell whether I&rsquo;ve got this wrong. I can only say that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>thought about it deeply and hard and long. And I&rsquo;ve listened, I promise, to the other</p>
<p>side. And I believe absolutely that there is something dangerous about this movement</p>
<p>and it must be challenged.</p>
<p>Chapter five, the tweets. Let&rsquo;s talk about the tweets.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about them.</p>
<p>On the 19th of December, 2019, J.K. Rowling finally jumped into the public conversation</p>
<p>around sex and gender. By that point, she&rsquo;d spent years following the debate and had become</p>
<p>increasingly concerned about what she saw as a vocal group of trans rights advocates</p>
<p>unfairly targeting feminists who disagreed with them. So she weighed in with a tweet.</p>
<p>Would you be willing to read the tweet that you wrote that day?</p>
<p>Yeah. I tweeted, dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with</p>
<p>any consenting adult who&rsquo;ll have you. Live your best life in peace and security. But</p>
<p>force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.</p>
<p>Hashtag, I stand with Maya. Hashtag, this is not a drill.</p>
<p>What did you want to accomplish with that tweet?</p>
<p>This tweet was in response to the Maya Forstater case.</p>
<p>Maya Forstater had posted a series of messages on social media</p>
<p>opposing the government&rsquo;s proposals to reform the Gender Recognition Act.</p>
<p>Maya Forstater posted a number of tweets expressing her beliefs and her contract</p>
<p>with her employer was not renewed after a number of her colleagues complained.</p>
<p>The incident that would finally push Rowling into speaking publicly involved a woman named</p>
<p>Maya Forstater, who had spoken out online against the so-called self-ID proposal in the UK.</p>
<p>She asserted that biological sex was unchangeable and that this law would undermine women&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>After posting tweets like men cannot change into women,</p>
<p>she was accused of offensive language and lost her job.</p>
<p>She was called a bigot, a transphobe, and a danger to trans people. Some of her colleagues complained</p>
<p>and ultimately the non-profit where she worked did not renew her contract. And so she decided</p>
<p>to fight this, claiming that she&rsquo;d been the victim of unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p>Disagreement is not harassment. People can have different views and we ought to be able to talk</p>
<p>about them. This is Forstater speaking with a journalist for Sky News. Gender-critical belief,</p>
<p>which is the absolutely ordinary belief about sex, that your mother and your grandmother are women,</p>
<p>that being female is a thing, is worthy of respect in a democratic society. And people</p>
<p>who hold that belief shouldn&rsquo;t be discriminated against or harassed for expressing it.</p>
<p>In the UK, they have what&rsquo;s known as an Employment Tribunal, which is a dedicated</p>
<p>part of the legal system that exclusively deals with disputes between employers and employees.</p>
<p>When Forstater took her former employer to this court, she said that, as a citizen of a democracy,</p>
<p>she had a right to voice her criticism of a proposed law in public. But a few of her</p>
<p>colleagues saw her words as crossing the line into transphobia. Forstater&rsquo;s comments in dispute</p>
<p>before the court read, in part, everyone&rsquo;s equality and safety should be protected,</p>
<p>but women and girls lose out on privacy, safety, and fairness if males are allowed into changing</p>
<p>rooms, dormitories, prisons, and sports teams. She also wrote, of course, in social situations,</p>
<p>I would treat any trans women as an honorary female and use whatever pronouns, etc. I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>try to hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings, but I don&rsquo;t think people should be compelled to play along with</p>
<p>literal delusions like trans women are women. In December 2019, the judge ruled against Forstater.</p>
<p>In the published ruling, he wrote that Forstater&rsquo;s belief, quote,</p>
<p>is not a philosophical belief protected by British law. He wrote, I consider that the</p>
<p>claimant&rsquo;s view, in its absolutist nature, is incompatible with human dignity and fundamental</p>
<p>rights of others. The judgment said that basically her speech in this case could not be protected</p>
<p>because it was not worthy of respect in a democratic society. This is Kathleen Stock,</p>
<p>a philosopher, writer, and for many years, a professor at the University of Sussex.</p>
<p>This was shocking to me, very shocking to me, because it, first of all, it seemed like the</p>
<p>judge had completely lost the plot. Secondly, it made a big material difference to any other woman</p>
<p>who was in a employment situation and who went online to express reasonable worries about a</p>
<p>policy that says that any man can legally become a woman just by saying that he is.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Stock has become one of the most vocal academics in all of the UK</p>
<p>on behalf of the feminist side in the debate about self-ID. And she saw this ruling as a</p>
<p>danger to free speech in a democratic society. So I then went to my blog, In a Fury, really,</p>
<p>and typed out quite a short piece called This Is Not a Drill.</p>
<p>In the hours after the ruling, she wrote a call to action, directed at her fellow academics.</p>
<p>So I made a call in this blog post to them directly, I call upon you to stand up and say</p>
<p>that there should be free speech on this issue. And I was always very careful to distinguish</p>
<p>between the position of someone like Maya, who thinks that there are significant problems</p>
<p>with the idea you can change your sex, for instance, and the right of us to say it,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re wrong. So my plea to academics was to stand up for the principle that you</p>
<p>should be legally permitted to believe and say that biological sex is immutable,</p>
<p>without fear of losing your job. Even if it turns out that we&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>we should still absolutely have the right to say it.</p>
<p>The whole point of a university is to contest groupthink or received wisdom.</p>
<p>Maybe that contestation will only serve to reinforce the groupthink, but at least it</p>
<p>would have been tested. And it has to be tested because there&rsquo;s so many instances from history</p>
<p>of where groupthink can go wrong, severely wrong, either empirically or ethically.</p>
<p>So academics should have the central role in the culture of testing received wisdom and</p>
<p>introducing controversial ideas in order that they may be rationally and empirically discussed.</p>
<p>And while this post didn&rsquo;t cause a flood of support from her colleagues,</p>
<p>it very quickly found its way to J.K. Rowling.</p>
<p>The conclusion was reached that her belief that sex is fundamentally immutable was not</p>
<p>worthy of respect. You couldn&rsquo;t hold that as a philosophical belief.</p>
<p>Seeing other feminists stand up in support of Maya and against the notion that a person might</p>
<p>have to lose their job just for stating this view, Rowling decided that the time had come</p>
<p>for her to speak up. I felt that the tribunal was wrong.</p>
<p>I think there is, in my view, considerable evidence for the fact that a woman is</p>
<p>the producer of the large gametes. And I found it outrageous that this employment tribunal had</p>
<p>decided, no, that belief wasn&rsquo;t worthy of respect. So I decided I&rsquo;m standing up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m standing up right now. I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I drafted the tweet and then I was considerate enough to phone my management team and say,</p>
<p>uh, you cannot argue me out of this. And I read out what I was about to say</p>
<p>because I felt they needed warning because I knew it was going to cause a massive storm.</p>
<p>I tweeted, dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like,</p>
<p>sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.</p>
<p>Within seconds of her hitting publish, the replies started pouring in.</p>
<p>And I knew what was coming. And sure enough, it came.</p>
<p>Within hours, GLAAD, an organization that praised Rowling as a writer who helped LGBT fans find</p>
<p>their identities and communities, said, J.K. Rowling has aligned herself with an</p>
<p>anti-science ideology that denies the basic humanity of people who are transgender.</p>
<p>Amnesty International, a place where Rowling had actually worked for a time in her 20s</p>
<p>and which she credits as having a profound effect on her worldview,</p>
<p>tweeted facepalm emojis along with, just in case anyone needs reminding,</p>
<p>trans rights equal human rights, over and over again.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people who were genuinely troubled and they posted sincere questions</p>
<p>about what Rowling was thinking, like the actress Mara Wilson, who asked,</p>
<p>what exactly is to be gained by using your platform to be cruel and exclusionary to one</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable populations? And many of those responding were among the</p>
<p>most passionate fans of Harry Potter. I have been a huge fan of yours for as</p>
<p>long as I can remember, and it breaks my heart to see this.</p>
<p>Such a shame that you&rsquo;ve become the evil that you taught so many of us to stand up to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on the wrong side of history with this one. I hope you come to realize this with time.</p>
<p>Your open disdain towards the trans community is the most disappointing revelation my generation</p>
<p>has witnessed regarding people we once looked up to. This makes me so sad for millions of children</p>
<p>that grew up reading your books. Trans women are women, and you have broken this heart that</p>
<p>your book so often healed. As a gay man that found safety in Hogwarts throughout my childhood,</p>
<p>knowing that trans people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have that safety breaks my heart.</p>
<p>MuggleNet, the original Harry Potter fan site that Rowling had embraced all those years ago,</p>
<p>published a statement alongside a trans rights flag saying,</p>
<p>we want every single Potter fan out there to know that the MuggleNet community stands with you.</p>
<p>We see you. We hear you. We support you.</p>
<p>Harry Potter conference runners, YouTubers, and podcasts started tweeting things like,</p>
<p>I am baffled that the woman who created such a loving, welcoming, and accepting community</p>
<p>can be openly transphobic. I don&rsquo;t understand how you can write seven books about acceptance,</p>
<p>but then not accept everyone. It&rsquo;s truly disappointing.</p>
<p>From the outside, it really looked like the entire Harry Potter internet world,</p>
<p>these people who had largely placed you on this pedestal in a way that you said made you</p>
<p>uncomfortable, was now saying you were a disgrace. Yeah. There was absolutely fury</p>
<p>and incomprehension. We talked about this before when you got that criticism from the right,</p>
<p>and it was so wide of the mark, as you say, that it didn&rsquo;t really touch you.</p>
<p>I wondered, did it feel that way from the left as well?</p>
<p>No, because if it&rsquo;s coming from people that you would, well, you would have thought were allies.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s absolutely going to hit differently, but I don&rsquo;t hold myself-</p>
<p>Because you share those fundamental values.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I would assume we share certain values. So yeah, that hits differently. Of course</p>
<p>it hits differently. But at the same time, I have to tell you a ton of Potter fans</p>
<p>were still with me. And in fact, a ton of Potter fans were grateful that I&rsquo;d said what I said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to measure the weight of supporters versus detractors over something like a tweet.</p>
<p>But it is true that Rowling&rsquo;s post, which was retweeted and liked by hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of people, had many responses in support and appreciation. They said things like,</p>
<p>the number of likes for this tweet will never convey to you how much it mattered that you were</p>
<p>willing to tweet it. It felt like you stood with ordinary women and men who support them as well</p>
<p>as with Maya. And it was a joy and a relief that the woman who gave us Harry Potter was prepared</p>
<p>to do that. Rowling also told me that she received thousands of private emails of support to her fan</p>
<p>mail address, many of them saying that the sender was too scared to post publicly on Twitter. And</p>
<p>she shared some of these with me with names redacted. And Rowling&rsquo;s post seemed to surprise</p>
<p>and encourage several of the feminists who&rsquo;d been targeted by campaigns to get them removed</p>
<p>from their jobs and by protests. Women like Kathleen Stock. I was delighted to see, absolutely</p>
<p>delighted, because at the time it felt very like there was just a bunch of relatively insignificant</p>
<p>women, including myself, howling into the void about it, to be honest, and getting no traction in the</p>
<p>media, getting no traction politically. Everyone treating us as if we were just total deplorables,</p>
<p>which we were not. What&rsquo;s interesting is the fans that found themselves in positions of power</p>
<p>online, did they feel they needed to take this position because they themselves had followers?</p>
<p>Possibly. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, I do know that there is huge pressure on people to take certain</p>
<p>positions at the moment, and I know that there is a huge amount of fear around it.</p>
<p>Some of them, I don&rsquo;t doubt, sincerely felt it. They just couldn&rsquo;t understand. Why? Why? Why aren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>simply repeating trans women are women? Why aren&rsquo;t you doing that? That is the kind and good and</p>
<p>righteous thing to do. I don&rsquo;t understand. And I&rsquo;m constantly told I don&rsquo;t understand my own books.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly told that I have betrayed my own books. My position is that I&rsquo;m absolutely</p>
<p>upholding the positions that I took in Potter. My position is that this activist movement,</p>
<p>in the form that it&rsquo;s currently taking, echoes the very thing that I was warning against in Harry Potter.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been trying to hold out that, like, this person who created a universe that led to this</p>
<p>community that has meant so much to me and taught me so many of these values of tolerance and</p>
<p>acceptance and unconditional love, like, that she wouldn&rsquo;t really believe this, right? No way.</p>
<p>This is Jackson Bird, an author whose memoir tells the story of how his Harry Potter fandom</p>
<p>helped him find his true self. After Rowling&rsquo;s tweet, he wrote an essay for the New York Times</p>
<p>titled, Harry Potter Helped Me Come Out as Trans, But J.K. Rowling Disappointed Me. But as you can</p>
<p>hear in this excerpt from his appearance on Pottercast, like many fans in December 2019,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t ready to totally turn his back on Rowling. In some way, like, I try to put myself</p>
<p>in her shoes and I&rsquo;m like, well, you know, she probably lives in this kind of bubble, you know,</p>
<p>when you are that wealthy and you&rsquo;ve had so much success, like, you&rsquo;re not necessarily going to be</p>
<p>meeting all kinds of different people in your life. And it is a confusing topic. And so maybe</p>
<p>she came across this stuff from turf land and it made a little bit of sense to her. And she is such</p>
<p>a staunch feminist. And so she kind of fell for some of it, maybe. And I still kind of want to</p>
<p>believe that. I want to believe that after she gets over whatever defensiveness she&rsquo;s going to have</p>
<p>from this reaction, maybe she will be willing to listen and learn and grow a little bit.</p>
<p>But then she tweeted again. Only this time,</p>
<p>it was during the chaotic political moment that was the summer of 2020.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>
<p>This podcast is supported by Athletic Greens. I am a person who can be pretty obsessive about</p>
<p>my health. My routine typically includes things like 10,000 steps a day and smoothies and strength</p>
<p>workouts. And yes, I am even one of those people who forces myself to take cold showers,</p>
<p>even in the winter. But a lot of that flew out the window when I had a baby six months ago,</p>
<p>and I especially struggled to make sure that I was getting good nutrition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was so excited to add AG1 from Athletic Greens to my routine.</p>
<p>I love that I can get 75 vitamins, minerals, and nutrients from whole food sources</p>
<p>just by adding a scoop of AG1 to my smoothie in the morning or mixing it with a glass of</p>
<p>cold water. It&rsquo;s a really simple habit to get into, and it&rsquo;s so much easier than swallowing</p>
<p>a bunch of pills, which is what I did for years and came to completely dread.</p>
<p>AG1 is different, and it makes me feel grateful that even during the most chaotic times in my life,</p>
<p>I can do this small, powerful thing to help me cover my nutritional bases every day.</p>

<p>After that single tweet in December of 2019 and the backlash from many fans,</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling and her Twitter account went quiet.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t release any statements.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t respond to either supporters or critics.</p>
<p>And although the story of the fans disappointed in her</p>
<p>made its way around the world in news articles and tabloids,</p>
<p>the story seemed to fade from public consciousness pretty quickly.</p>
<p>There were no widespread calls for boycotts.</p>
<p>Her book sales did not suffer.</p>
<p>And quickly, much bigger stories dominated the world&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>We do have breaking news tonight,</p>
<p>a deeply divided moment playing out in American history as we come on the air.</p>
<p>President Trump has just been impeached on both Article 1 abuse of power.</p>
<p>The very same week that Rowling sent her I stand with Maya tweet.</p>
<p>Now Donald Trump has become only the third U.S. president to be impeached.</p>
<p>The American president was impeached for the first time since Clinton in the 90s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the single greatest witch hunt in American history,</p>
<p>probably in history, but in American history.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>China has more than 200 confirmed cases of coronavirus, it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>A new virus was spreading around the world.</p>
<p>A SARS-like virus, which has infected hundreds in China,</p>
<p>has now reached the United States.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has officially called it COVID-19.</p>
<p>A virus is more powerful in creating political,</p>
<p>economic and social upheaval than any terrorist attack.</p>
<p>The virus&rsquo;s spread then led to lockdowns around the world.</p>
<p>From this evening, I must give the British people a very simple instruction.</p>
<p>You must stay at home.</p>
<p>Offices were closed, schools closed, churches closed,</p>
<p>restaurants, bars, beaches and even public parks.</p>
<p>People stayed home and, according to data that came out later,</p>
<p>they were spending more time online, and especially on social media, than ever before.</p>
<p>Days turned into weeks. Weeks turned into months.</p>
<p>And by May, anti-lockdown protests started erupting around the world.</p>
<p>We do not consent! We do not consent!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had enough of being told what I can and cannot do.</p>
<p>I want to be free! I want to live my life!</p>
<p>I want all my friends to live their lives!</p>
<p>Then, a video came out of a white police officer</p>
<p>kneeling on the neck of a Black citizen named George Floyd.</p>
<p>Black lives matter! Black lives matter!</p>
<p>Outrage spread across the country.</p>
<p>No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace!</p>
<p>Then, the world.</p>
<p>Mass protests here in the United States have sparked a global movement</p>
<p>against racial discrimination.</p>
<p>Leading to one of the largest protest movements of the 21st century.</p>
<p>But also&hellip;</p>
<p>You can see police here now firing tear gas into the crowd.</p>
<p>They are trying to push these folks back.</p>
<p>Fuck police! Fuck police!</p>
<p>The most costly and deadly riots in America since the L.A. riots in the 90s.</p>
<p>Earlier today, just a few blocks away, there was looting underway nearby.</p>
<p>Police seem to have had enough.</p>
<p>The social contract is broken!</p>
<p>You broke the contract!</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they can burn this bitch to the ground.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t shoot! Don&rsquo;t shoot! Don&rsquo;t shoot!</p>
<p>This unrest was also present online,</p>
<p>where social media was full of outrage and anger and uncertainty</p>
<p>about COVID-19 and its origins.</p>
<p>About racial discrimination.</p>
<p>About racism in the U.S. and what should be done to remedy it.</p>
<p>About the gap between the haves and the have-nots.</p>
<p>And about whether the current systems could remedy these problems,</p>
<p>or whether those systems needed to be dismantled entirely.</p>
<p>There was a reckoning about the past, about historical figures and their statues,</p>
<p>but also about prominent people in the present.</p>
<p>We live in a time now where we have to be very careful about what we say.</p>
<p>We have what we call cancel culture, man.</p>
<p>If you do something wrong, you&rsquo;re supposed to be out of here.</p>
<p>And it could have been five minutes ago, or it could have been 20, 30 years ago.</p>
<p>When a Twitter mob wants to cancel somebody,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically saying that a person has done something harmful.</p>
<p>Famous journalists and writers faced backlashes over tweets and op-eds and lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Actors and musicians faced backlashes for insensitive lyrics or jokes</p>
<p>and released apology videos.</p>
<p>And it was into this environment that on June 6th, 2020,</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling tweeted again.</p>
<p>So can you set this up for me?</p>
<p>Like, where were you?</p>
<p>I was angry.</p>
<p>I was getting really angry.</p>
<p>What happens was I flipped open Twitter and I saw this article.</p>
<p>It was actually at the top of my feed.</p>
<p>Creating a more equal post-COVID-19 world for people who menstruate.</p>
<p>This article that Rowling saw was using this sort of language that&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>both more common and more polarizing in recent years,</p>
<p>where outlets avoid using gendered words like women or mothers,</p>
<p>and instead use phrases like cervix havers, uterus havers, or pregnant people,</p>
<p>or in this case, people who menstruate.</p>
<p>The idea is that it&rsquo;s more inclusive to those who don&rsquo;t identify as women,</p>
<p>but who are still experiencing things like menstruation or pregnancy.</p>
<p>But to many feminists, it&rsquo;s also seen as</p>
<p>removing women from the center of experiences that directly affect them.</p>
<p>You know, there is power to words with history, both good and ill.</p>
<p>And to me, the word woman has its own power.</p>
<p>And I do not believe we can meaningfully analyze the harms done to women and girls</p>
<p>without using language that has concrete meaning.</p>
<p>And I felt there&rsquo;s an obfuscation here.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m coming to that article on the background of what I see as</p>
<p>huge injustice and people trying to shut women down.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t doubt that I too was being affected by</p>
<p>the incredibly febrile, oppressive atmosphere that we are all currently living in.</p>
<p>And that was inflaming my sense of injustice on behalf of women.</p>
<p>Rowling, just like so many others over the COVID lockdowns,</p>
<p>had been spending more time online, in her case on Twitter.</p>
<p>And there, she continued to see how many women labeled as TERFs</p>
<p>were attacked as hate figures and told to shut up and go away,</p>
<p>and sent threats of violence and harassment day in and day out.</p>
<p>So I was angry and I was flippant.</p>
<p>So seeing this article, she just reacted.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice there was no courtesy call to my management at this point.</p>
<p>And a few seconds later, she sent a tweet to her 14 million followers.</p>
<p>And I tweeted in quotes,</p>
<p>people who menstruate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there used to be a word for those people.</p>
<p>Someone help me out.</p>
<p>And that was like dropping a hand grenade into Twitter.</p>
<p>Did I mean to drop a hand grenade in?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I was just keeping a rein on my own fury.</p>
<p>So off we went.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling is back at her bullshit again.</p>
<p>Nope, men have periods too.</p>
<p>Stop hating trans people, you awful weirdo.</p>
<p>And again, within seconds.</p>
<p>You fucking suck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fact that women can have penises and men can have vaginas.</p>
<p>The responses started pouring in.</p>
<p>Eat shit.</p>
<p>At J.K. Rowling, shut the fuck up, TERF.</p>
<p>You are ruining my childhood.</p>
<p>First of all, eat shit and die, you TERF-ass bastard.</p>
<p>Only this time, there were magnitudes more, and more enraged.</p>
<p>Never thought I would say this, but here we are.</p>
<p>Fuck you, J.K.</p>
<p>Your reductivism is harmful and ignorant.</p>
<p>At J.K. Rowling, fuck you.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up, you transphobic piece of shit.</p>
<p>A transphobic piece of shit.</p>
<p>Journalists and media figures started responding.</p>
<p>God, you&rsquo;re awful.</p>
<p>Good night and shut up.</p>
<p>I actually appreciate how much you are honest about being a huge fucking TERF,</p>
<p>so that no one is confused about whether or not you&rsquo;re awful.</p>
<p>Doubling down on your TERF-ness.</p>
<p>You are pathetic and embarrassing.</p>
<p>Your unapologetic ignorance is vile.</p>
<p>Celebrities with huge followings like Jameela Jamil and Halsey</p>
<p>tweeted that J.K. Rowling had ruined her legacy.</p>
<p>Jonathan Van Ness shared a viral meme that said,</p>
<p>Harry Potter and the audacity of this bitch.</p>
<p>Christ, you are such a colossal disappointment.</p>
<p>And it just kept going.</p>
<p>You are foul.</p>
<p>What a nasty piece of work you are.</p>
<p>I used to love your books.</p>
<p>You absolutely disgust me.</p>
<p>TERF, your hatred is a stench.</p>
<p>But this time, instead of just sending the tweet and walking away,</p>
<p>Rowling started to try to engage with her critics.</p>
<p>I responded with,</p>
<p>If sex isn&rsquo;t real, there&rsquo;s no same-sex attraction.</p>
<p>If sex isn&rsquo;t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased.</p>
<p>I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex</p>
<p>removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t hate to speak the truth.</p>
<p>Now, I stand by every word that I wrote there,</p>
<p>but the question is, what is the truth?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m arguing against people who are literally saying sex is a construct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>She tried to clarify that first flippant tweet and wrote,</p>
<p>I respect every trans person&rsquo;s right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans.</p>
<p>At the same time, my life has been shaped by being female.</p>
<p>I do not believe it&rsquo;s hateful to say so.</p>
<p>And yet, the more she responded, the more the criticism grew.</p>
<p>I literally cannot wrap my head around the fact that it is a global pandemic right now.</p>
<p>There is like a fucking revolution going on.</p>
<p>And JK Rowling sat down and thought, hmm, now is a good time to be transphobic.</p>
<p>Within minutes, the responses were moving from Twitter to other platforms,</p>
<p>like YouTube and TikTok.</p>
<p>It is highly problematic that this woman came out on Twitter</p>
<p>as a full-blown transphobe in the middle of a civil rights revolution.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how JK Rowling has been a piece of shit for a hot ass minute,</p>
<p>but we were all just too young and jaded and infatuated with Harry Potter to really see it.</p>
<p>JK Rowling, I hate you so much. I hate you so much. You&rsquo;re awful.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re tweeting these things, how do you feel it&rsquo;s going?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s important to say that I&rsquo;m not sitting there thinking,</p>
<p>how am I doing here? How am I positioning myself as though I&rsquo;m a brand?</p>
<p>I am talking and thinking and feeling as an individual human being.</p>
<p>Reading it now today, I&rsquo;m amazed that I was pretty measured</p>
<p>because I wasn&rsquo;t feeling measured at this point.</p>
<p>A lot of things had come together and I found it very enraging to watch hashtag be kind</p>
<p>attached to tweets that I thought were utterly dehumanizing of women,</p>
<p>utterly scathing about women&rsquo;s concerns.</p>
<p>JK Rowling is a whore.</p>
<p>Kindly fuck off, you turf cunt, you hateful, spiteful, ignorant hag.</p>
<p>Rowling had said that part of the reason she spoke up</p>
<p>was seeing the way that other women were harassed when they spoke up.</p>
<p>And now, that same harassment was coming for her.</p>
<p>At JK Rowling, choke on cock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really just love to fucking punch JK Rowling in her thick rectangle head.</p>
<p>JK Rowling, the transphobic fuck, can suck my dick and choke on it.</p>
<p>God, JK Rowling can gargle my cock and balls and hopefully choke on them right there and then</p>
<p>so she can die and never write another absolutely inane transphobic tweet ever again.</p>
<p>I do watch this movement behaving towards women in ways that I think are absolutely abhorrent.</p>
<p>As she read tweet after terrible tweet,</p>
<p>far from changing her mind, they all seemed to serve as evidence,</p>
<p>as confirmation that her concerns were justified.</p>
<p>Well, this is it, you see, because the turf is by her nature a hate-filled bigot.</p>
<p>Being a turf is evil.</p>
<p>At JK Rowling, you&rsquo;re a turf and need to be stoned.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s evil. She is evil. And that is said openly.</p>
<p>I mean, it is very biblical language that is used of women who say,</p>
<p>you know what, I think any measure that makes it easier for predators to get at</p>
<p>women and girls is a bad idea. That&rsquo;s, you know, and that there are plenty of women who don&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t identify themselves as feminists who are very concerned about this.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;ve internalized the idea of women and girls,</p>
<p>but once you&rsquo;ve internalized the idea that a turf is vermin and scum and all the other</p>
<p>words that are used, and that it&rsquo;s an easy step to punch all turfs, I kill turfs,</p>
<p>this baseball bat will be used to smash, I&rsquo;ve literally seen there is no point</p>
<p>in arguing with a turf. We need to make them too frightened to speak.</p>
<p>As all these tweets and other responses are coming in, and you&rsquo;re sitting there reading them,</p>
<p>how did you feel?</p>
<p>How did I feel? Was it nice? Was it fun? No, it&rsquo;s horrible. It&rsquo;s horrible to,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the scale. I think people who have never been in that position, it is the scale.</p>
<p>Even though I knew it was coming, but that&rsquo;s like knowing you&rsquo;re about to be punched. You know,</p>
<p>this is going to really hurt. It&rsquo;s still, you know, you really need to take the punch to know</p>
<p>how much it hurts. Was it fun? No. Was I enjoying myself? No.</p>
<p>When my producers and I started going through the responses to Rowling&rsquo;s tweets,</p>
<p>even though we knew there&rsquo;d be many threats and unhinged comments because,</p>
<p>of course, this is the internet, we weren&rsquo;t prepared for the sheer volume</p>
<p>of violent sexual threats that we found. It&rsquo;s hard to know exact numbers because</p>
<p>Twitter has a policy of removing these tweets. But by our count, on top of the thousands that</p>
<p>we saw that are still public, hundreds more have either been deleted by Twitter</p>
<p>or removed by the authors. Even if you just go to Twitter right now and type in J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that these sorts of comments are seemingly endless. And they aren&rsquo;t just coming</p>
<p>from online trolls writing from behind anonymous profiles. And they didn&rsquo;t just stay online.</p>
<p>Rowling&rsquo;s home address was doxed, and law enforcement contacted her to say they were</p>
<p>investigating credible threats of violence. And Rowling, in response to the hostility</p>
<p>flowing in her direction, posted a tweet that read, Feminazi. Turf. Bitch. Witch.</p>
<p>Times change. Woman hate is eternal. But that just led to hundreds of people accusing her,</p>
<p>one of the wealthiest, most privileged women in the world, of trying to paint herself as a victim.</p>
<p>Over the next 48 hours, the denunciations continued. There was a torrent of negative</p>
<p>headlines in news outlets around the globe calling her transphobic. Then,</p>
<p>the actors who&rsquo;d starred in the Harry Potter films began releasing statements and distancing</p>
<p>themselves from her, including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Bonnie Wright,</p>
<p>all of whom had known Rowling since they were children.</p>
<p>Some of the voices who&rsquo;ve been critical include the stars of her own movie,</p>
<p>including the biggest star, Daniel Radcliffe. That&rsquo;s right. Harry Potter himself responded.</p>
<p>And in that statement, he wrote, transgender women</p>
<p>are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people.</p>
<p>Warner Brothers, the studio that released the Harry Potter films, released a statement that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t denounce JK by name, but said they support the trans community and inclusivity.</p>
<p>On June 10, 2020, four days after her initial tweets,</p>
<p>Rowling published an essay on her website, expanding on her views.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an easy piece to write, she begins, for reasons that will shortly become clear.</p>
<p>But I know it&rsquo;s time to explain myself on an issue surrounded by toxicity.</p>
<p>I write this without any desire to add to that toxicity.</p>
<p>She then listed her reasons for speaking up. That she had concerns for women-only spaces,</p>
<p>like prisons and domestic violence shelters. That she worried about children not old enough</p>
<p>to make life-altering medical decisions. That, as the author of a series frequently targeted by</p>
<p>book bans, she was alarmed by the way conversations and debates were being shut down.</p>
<p>Then, she shared a personal story, which she hadn&rsquo;t revealed until this moment.</p>
<p>Not just that she had been abused by her ex-husband, but that separately,</p>
<p>she had also suffered a serious sexual assault. She wrote, I&rsquo;ve been in the public eye now for</p>
<p>over 20 years, and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault</p>
<p>survivor. This isn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m ashamed those things happened to me, but because they&rsquo;re traumatic</p>
<p>to revisit and remember. I&rsquo;m mentioning these things now, not in an attempt to garner sympathy,</p>
<p>but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine,</p>
<p>who have been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces.</p>
<p>If you could come inside my head and understand what I feel when I read about a trans woman</p>
<p>dying at the hands of a violent man, you&rsquo;d find solidarity and kinship. I have a visceral sense</p>
<p>of the terror in which those trans women will have spent their last seconds on earth, because I too</p>
<p>have known moments of blind fear when I realized that the only thing keeping me alive was the shaky</p>
<p>self-restraint of my attacker. I believe the majority of trans-identified people not only</p>
<p>pose zero threat to others, but are vulnerable for all the reasons I&rsquo;ve outlined. Trans people need</p>
<p>and deserve protection. Like women, they&rsquo;re most likely to be killed by sexual partners.</p>
<p>Trans women who work in the sex industry, particularly trans women of color, are at</p>
<p>particular risk. Like every other domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor I know,</p>
<p>I feel nothing but empathy and solidarity with trans women who&rsquo;ve been abused by men.</p>
<p>So I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make natal girls and women</p>
<p>less safe. When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who</p>
<p>believes or feels he&rsquo;s a woman, and as I&rsquo;ve said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted</p>
<p>without any need for surgery or hormones, then you open the door to any and all men</p>
<p>who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth.</p>
<p>Rowling ended her essay with the following.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t written this essay in the hope that anybody will get out a violin for me,</p>
<p>not even a teeny weeny one. I&rsquo;m extraordinarily fortunate. I&rsquo;m a survivor, certainly not a victim.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only mentioned my past because, like every other human being on this planet,</p>
<p>I have a complex backstory which shapes my fears, my interests, and my opinions.</p>
<p>I never forget that inner complexity when I&rsquo;m creating a fictional character.</p>
<p>And I certainly never forget it when it comes to trans people.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m asking, all I want, is for similar empathy, similar understanding, to be extended to the many</p>
<p>millions of women whose sole crime is wanting their concerns to be heard without receiving threats</p>
<p>and abuse. What in the living fuck did I read?</p>
<p>If her hope in writing that essay was to win over some of her critics,</p>
<p>in the days following its publication? But this is a matter of free speech, darling.</p>
<p>I suppose everyone&rsquo;s also conveniently forgotten that I was poor.</p>
<p>There was plenty of evidence that it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Let the joyous news be spread, the wicked old witch at last is dead.</p>
<p>Many saw Rowling&rsquo;s essay as her death knell and started sharing videos and memes.</p>
<p>Some saying that they were explaining J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s essay so you don&rsquo;t have to read it.</p>
<p>Others saying, ding dong, the witch is dead.</p>
<p>Seeing as J.K. Rowling is such a terrible person, I&rsquo;m here with an official statement</p>
<p>from the government to say we no longer recognize her as author of the Harry Potter series.</p>
<p>From now on, we&rsquo;re telling the future generations, look kid, we don&rsquo;t know who wrote that.</p>
<p>Just popped out of thin air like the Bible.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling uses the fact that misogyny is real, it does exist, to be the constant victim.</p>
<p>And in her warped, awful morality, she thinks being a victim entitles her to victimize</p>
<p>anyone that she wants to.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s opinions about trans issues literally get trans people killed,</p>
<p>but stay comfortable, I guess.</p>
<p>A trend started on TikTok where users began burning their Harry Potter books.</p>
<p>So let me talk about the infamous book burning video for a second.</p>
<p>I am not just offended by what J.K. Rowling says,</p>
<p>I am fearful because of what she is promoting on her platform.</p>
<p>Or tearing them into pieces.</p>
<p>What am I doing, you might ask?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making recycled paper out of this book that I used to love,</p>
<p>wrote by a transphobic author.</p>
<p>Campaigns were started to boycott her books and merchandise.</p>
<p>You need to stop buying Harry Potter books because a very homophobic,</p>
<p>transphobic and racist woman would be profiting off of them.</p>
<p>And others organized to get her books removed from schools.</p>
<p>Now, J.K. Rowling will not be the last author</p>
<p>that we need to vet and remove from our classrooms.</p>
<p>Our job as educators is to create safe and inclusive spaces for all our students.</p>
<p>We cannot do this if we have authors on our shelves that perpetuate hate and racism.</p>
<p>So vet your books and get rid of problematic authors.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>After Rowling&rsquo;s essay, Mugglenet called her comments harmful to trans people</p>
<p>and then, like other fan forums, they removed their photos of Rowling from the site.</p>
<p>Hardcore fans got their Harry Potter tattoos removed.</p>
<p>At least two British schools removed Rowling&rsquo;s name from houses they had titled in her honor.</p>
<p>Players of Quidditch, the fictional sport she invented,</p>
<p>ultimately changed its name to dissociate themselves from her.</p>
<p>An I Love J.K. Rowling poster that was hanging in a Scottish railway station</p>
<p>was criticized as hate speech by some members of the public,</p>
<p>and then removed by transportation authorities.</p>
<p>But the backlash had far more impact on women who lack Rowling&rsquo;s power and privilege.</p>
<p>Gillian Philip, a children&rsquo;s book author, added the hashtag</p>
<p>I Stand With J.K. Rowling to her Twitter bio, igniting a wave of rape threats,</p>
<p>death threats, and a campaign for her to be dropped by her publisher.</p>
<p>And just 24 hours later, she received a call from HarperCollins and was fired on the spot.</p>
<p>Unlike Rowling, she still needed income and now works as a truck driver.</p>
<p>Rosa Friedman, a human rights lawyer and professor, came out publicly against self-ID laws</p>
<p>and received death and rape threats, along with calls for her to be fired,</p>
<p>and even urine poured on her office door.</p>
<p>Jo Phoenix, a criminology researcher who works with women prisoners,</p>
<p>spoke publicly in support of female-only prisons,</p>
<p>and was pushed out of her position at Open University after a petition was passed around</p>
<p>calling her fundamentally hostile to the rights of trans people.</p>
<p>Jenny Lindsay, a prominent Scottish poet who only spoke up to oppose calls for violence</p>
<p>directed at so-called TERFs, she became the object of such intense threats</p>
<p>that the police counseled her to avoid public events for her own safety.</p>
<p>And Kathleen Stock, the philosophy professor whose essay,</p>
<p>This Is Not a Drill, was shared by Rowling,</p>
<p>who was advocating for academic freedom to debate these questions,</p>
<p>even if her side turned out to be wrong, she became the object of fierce campus protests.</p>
<p>In 2021, a group of students formed to demand that Stock be fired.</p>
<p>This group started coming to campus with big signs, they were letting off flares,</p>
<p>they were taking photos for this website that they&rsquo;d started called Kathleen Stock is a TERF,</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>The website&rsquo;s actually called Anti-TERF Sussex,</p>
<p>and their mission statement reads in part,</p>
<p>The website&rsquo;s actually called Anti-TERF Sussex,</p>
<p>and their mission statement reads in part,</p>
<p>We fucking had enough.</p>
<p>Our demand is simple.</p>
<p>Fire Kathleen Stock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t have a clue who I am.</p>
<p>And yet they were happy to stand there and try and get me out.</p>
<p>Stock, who is herself a lesbian,</p>
<p>rejects the accusations that she is anti-queer or anti-trans.</p>
<p>But the protesters continued their campaign.</p>
<p>They put up posters all over campus saying things like,</p>
<p>Kathleen Stock makes trans students unsafe.</p>
<p>They graffitied the walls of nearby subway tunnels and underpasses with the simple,</p>
<p>Stock out.</p>
<p>After that, I was advised to stay at home and teach from home.</p>
<p>Ultimately, after nearly two decades at the University of Sussex,</p>
<p>Stock felt forced to resign.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s Minister of Higher Education said,</p>
<p>It is absolutely appalling that the toxic environment at the University of Sussex</p>
<p>has made it untenable for Professor Kathleen Stock to continue in her position there.</p>
<p>The sustained campaign of harassment and intimidation she has faced</p>
<p>is deplorable, and the situation should never have got this far.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an extension of the whole experience, which is that you</p>
<p>do feel alternating between feeling like you&rsquo;re going crazy,</p>
<p>feeling anger, feeling total defeat,</p>
<p>and then also feeling all the feelings of shame and guilt that they want you to feel.</p>
<p>Because to just suddenly have all fingers pointing at you,</p>
<p>you feel you can&rsquo;t help but take on the feelings that they want you to have for a bit.</p>
<p>You have to really defend yourself against it.</p>
<p>You have to remind yourself.</p>
<p>You have to keep going back to what you actually wrote.</p>
<p>And you almost expect there to be some terrible inflammatory language there,</p>
<p>or some terrible threat to somebody that somehow you didn&rsquo;t notice that you&rsquo;d written.</p>
<p>But then you remind yourself,</p>
<p>No, I just wrote this sort of relatively centrist, moderate, in the middle, compassionate thing.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s really a psychological battle to stay strong</p>
<p>and not take on the projections that are coming at you in the moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it felt.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t always succeed.</p>
<p>What do you say to the people who say,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just accountability?</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ve heard this all the time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re holding you accountable.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re holding you accountable.</p>
<p>Well, I would say this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a great believer in looking at not what people say, but what they do.</p>
<p>How are you behaving?</p>
<p>If you are threatening, if you are threatening to remove livelihoods,</p>
<p>if you are saying this person is cancelled, that is the language of a dictator.</p>
<p>I cancel you.</p>
<p>I obliterate you.</p>
<p>You are dead.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve literally lost count of the number of times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the hashtag RIP JK Rowling floating around.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t about me.</p>
<p>You know, clearly I&rsquo;m pretty resilient.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t call that being held accountable.</p>
<p>If you want to debate with me, I am absolutely open to that.</p>
<p>And I think I have proven that I&rsquo;m very willing to engage on the ideas.</p>
<p>But I notice a remarkable disinclination to engage on the ideas.</p>
<p>The response is,</p>
<p>Well, we can&rsquo;t listen to you.</p>
<p>You are evil.</p>
<p>You must not be listened to.</p>
<p>That to me is intellectually incredibly cowardly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that any righteous movement behaves in such a way.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that many people are interested in what Rowling has done,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;ve never read Harry Potter,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t follow this debate between some feminists and some trans rights activists,</p>
<p>is because this experience she&rsquo;s describing</p>
<p>feels like it&rsquo;s become much more familiar over the past decade.</p>
<p>When it comes to controversial issues,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s abortion or racism, Brexit or Trump, vaccines or COVID school closures,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s becoming much more common,</p>
<p>not just for disagreement to be heated and fierce,</p>
<p>but for people to see anyone who doesn&rsquo;t share their view as evil.</p>
<p>For many onlookers,</p>
<p>even ones who vehemently disagree with the questions and objections that J.K. Rowling is raising,</p>
<p>she is highlighting a breakdown in the fabric of a pluralistic society.</p>
<p>One of my very dearest friends is a committed and practicing Catholic,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s also pro-life.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a feminist, I&rsquo;m pro-choice.</p>
<p>I understand exactly what his arguments are.</p>
<p>His arguments are.</p>
<p>And I respect his argument.</p>
<p>And he is prepared to make his argument.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with his argument,</p>
<p>but he respects my argument.</p>
<p>And we are both able to find shades of grey within our beliefs.</p>
<p>I think that is healthy.</p>
<p>I think that is productive.</p>
<p>I am not going to cut that person out of my life</p>
<p>because we disagree on something,</p>
<p>albeit something that is very important to me.</p>
<p>We have lost that in this particular debate.</p>
<p>What do you say to the people who say that you,</p>
<p>maybe because of your experiences,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t see that you&rsquo;ve actually become like the villains in your books,</p>
<p>that this fight you&rsquo;ve jumped into is a betrayal of some kind?</p>
<p>I suppose the thing I would say,</p>
<p>above all, to those who seek to tell me that I don&rsquo;t understand my own book,</p>
<p>I will say this.</p>
<p>Some of you have not understood the books.</p>
<p>The Death Eaters claimed we have been made to live in secret,</p>
<p>and now is our time.</p>
<p>And any who stand in our way must be destroyed.</p>
<p>If you disagree with us, you must die.</p>
<p>They demonised and dehumanised those who were not like them.</p>
<p>I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement</p>
<p>that I think has gained huge purchase in very influential areas of society.</p>
<p>I do not see this particular movement as either benign or powerless.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m afraid I stand with the women who are fighting to be heard</p>
<p>against threat of loss of livelihood and threats to their personal safety.</p>
<p>But as passionately as Rowling feels,</p>
<p>and as much as the experience of speaking up has served to confirm her feelings,</p>
<p>there are many Harry Potter fans,</p>
<p>especially transgender fans,</p>
<p>who feel that the threats and harassment she&rsquo;s received don&rsquo;t speak for them,</p>
<p>and who bristle at the idea that their side is the side with power.</p>
<p>And some of these fans are still holding out hope that Rowling will change her mind.</p>
<p>What would you want to say to JK Rowling?</p>
<p>I just kind of hope she could try to see why so many trans people are angry and hurt by this.</p>
<p>I realize that that means asking for a second to, like,</p>
<p>leave her own position of feeling hurt and threatened.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what she says that she wants to do.</p>
<p>And to me, what doing that would look like would be</p>
<p>understanding why people who are sort of being constantly rejected</p>
<p>and humiliated by our families, by the government,</p>
<p>who are either losing our access to health care or being threatened with it,</p>
<p>who are kind of just, like, fighting for a basic ability to participate in society,</p>
<p>like, why we might feel hurt and betrayed by her sort of contributing to, like, fear about us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I guess, what I would say.</p>
<p>More, next time.</p>
