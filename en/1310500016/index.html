    <p>The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a mathematician, economist, physicist, and the managing director of Teal Capital.</p>
<p>He coined the term, and you can say, is the founder of the intellectual dark web, which</p>
<p>is a loosely assembled group of public intellectuals that includes Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>Steven Pinker, Joe Rogan, Michael Shermer, and a few others.</p>
<p>This conversation is part of the Artificial Intelligence Podcast at MIT and beyond.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex</p>
<p>Friedman, spelled F R I D.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>Are you nervous about this?</p>
<p>Scared shitless.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You mentioned Kung Fu Panda as one of your favorite movies.</p>
<p>It has the usual profound master student dynamic going on.</p>
<p>So who was, who has been a teacher that significantly influenced the direction of your thinking</p>
<p>and life&rsquo;s work?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re the Kung Fu Panda, who was your Shifu?</p>
<p>Oh, well, it&rsquo;s interesting because I didn&rsquo;t see Shifu as being the teacher.</p>
<p>Who was the teacher?</p>
<p>Oogway, Master Oogway.</p>
<p>The turtle.</p>
<p>Oh, the turtle.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They only meet twice in the entire film.</p>
<p>And the first conversation sort of doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>So the magic of the film, in fact, its point is that the teaching that really matters is</p>
<p>transferred during a single conversation and it&rsquo;s very brief.</p>
<p>And so who played that role in my life?</p>
<p>I would say, uh, either, uh, my grandfather, uh, Harry Rubin and his wife, Sophie Rubin,</p>
<p>my grandmother, or Tom Lehrer.</p>
<p>Tom Lehrer?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In which way?</p>
<p>If you give a child Tom Lehrer records, what you do is you destroy their ability to be</p>
<p>taken over by later malware.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so irreverent, so witty, so clever, so obscene that it destroys the ability to</p>
<p>lead a normal life for many people.</p>
<p>So if I meet somebody who&rsquo;s usually really shifted from any kind of neurotypical presentation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll often ask them, uh, are you a Tom Lehrer fan?</p>
<p>And the odds that they will respond are quite high.</p>
<p>Tom Lehrer is, uh, poisoning pigeons in the park, Tom Lehrer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>There are a small number of Tom Lehrer songs that broke into the general population, poisoning</p>
<p>pigeons in the park, the element song, and perhaps the Vatican rag.</p>
<p>Uh, so when you meet somebody who knows those songs but doesn&rsquo;t know, oh, you&rsquo;re judging</p>
<p>me right now, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Harshly.</p>
<p>Uh, no, but you&rsquo;re a Russian, so I doubt as the, you know, Nikolai Ivanovich Lubachevsky,</p>
<p>that song.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, so that was a song about plagiarism that was in fact plagiarized, which most people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know from Danny Kay, uh, where Danny Kay did a song called Stanislavsky of the</p>
<p>Muskie arts.</p>
<p>And so Tom Lehrer did this brilliant job of plagiarizing a song about and making it about</p>
<p>plagiarism and then making it about this mathematician who worked in non Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>That was like, uh, giving heroin to a child.</p>
<p>It was extremely addictive and eventually led me to a lot of different places, one of</p>
<p>which may have been a PhD in mathematics.</p>
<p>And he was also at least a lecturer in mathematics, I believe at Harvard, something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just had dinner with him.</p>
<p>In fact, uh, when my son turned 13, we didn&rsquo;t tell him, but, um, his bar mitzvah present</p>
<p>was dinner with his hero, Tom Lehrer.</p>
<p>And Tom Lehrer was 88 years old, sharp as a tack, irreverent and funny as hell.</p>
<p>And just, you know, there are very few people in this world that you have to meet while</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still here.</p>
<p>And that was definitely one for our family.</p>
<p>So that wit is a reflection of intelligence in some kind of deep way, like where that</p>
<p>would be a good test of intelligence, whether you&rsquo;re a Tom Lehrer fan.</p>
<p>So what do you think that is about wit, about that kind of humor, ability to see the absurdity</p>
<p>in existence?</p>
<p>Well, do you think that&rsquo;s connected to intelligence or are we just two Jews on a mic that appreciate</p>
<p>that kind of humor?</p>
<p>No, I think that it&rsquo;s absolutely connected to intelligence.</p>
<p>So you can, you can see it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a place where Tom Lehrer decides that he&rsquo;s going to lampoon Gilbert of Gilbert and</p>
<p>Sullivan and he&rsquo;s going to outdo Gilbert with clever, meaningless wordplay.</p>
<p>And he has, forget the, well, let&rsquo;s see, he&rsquo;s doing Clementine as if Gilbert and Sullivan</p>
<p>wrote it.</p>
<p>That I misunderstood depressed her young sister named Mr. This Mr. Depester, she tried pestering</p>
<p>sisters of festering blister you best to resist or say I, the sister persisted the Mr. Resisted</p>
<p>I kissed her all loyalty slip when he said, when she said I could have her, her sister&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cadaver must surely have turned in its crypt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so dense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so insane that that&rsquo;s clearly intelligence because it&rsquo;s hard to construct something like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>If I look at my favorite Tom Lehrer, Tom Lehrer lyric, you know, there&rsquo;s a perfectly absurd</p>
<p>one, which is once all the Germans were warlike and mean, but that couldn&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>We taught them a lesson in 1918 and they&rsquo;ve hardly bothered us since then, right?</p>
<p>That is a different kind of intelligence.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re taking something that is so horrific and you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re sort of making</p>
<p>it palatable and funny and demonstrating also, um, just your humanity.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the thing that came through as, as Tom Lehrer wrote all of these terrible,</p>
<p>horrible lines was just what a sensitive and beautiful soul he was, who was channeling</p>
<p>pain through humor and through grace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen throughout Europe, throughout Russia, that same kind of humor emerged from the generation</p>
<p>of world war II.</p>
<p>It seemed like that humor is required to somehow deal with the pain and the suffering of that,</p>
<p>that war created.</p>
<p>You do need the environment to create the broad Slavic soul.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that many Americans really appreciate, um, Russian humor, how you had to joke during</p>
<p>the time of, let&rsquo;s say article 58 under Stalin, you had to be very, very careful.</p>
<p>You know, the concept of a Russian satirical magazine like Crocodile, uh, doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense.</p>
<p>So you have this cross cultural problem that there are certain areas of human experience</p>
<p>that it would be better to know nothing about.</p>
<p>And quite unfortunately, Eastern Europe knows a great deal about them, which makes the,</p>
<p>you know, the songs of Vladimir Vysotsky so potent, the, uh, you know, the pros of Pushkin,</p>
<p>whatever it is, uh, you have to appreciate the depth of the Eastern European experience.</p>
<p>And I would think that perhaps Americans knew something like this around the time of the</p>
<p>civil war or merit maybe, um, you know, under slavery and Jim Crow or even the, uh, harsh</p>
<p>tyranny of, uh, the coal and steel employers during the labor wars.</p>
<p>Um, but in general, I would say it&rsquo;s hard for us to understand and imagine the collective</p>
<p>culture unless we have the system of selective pressures that, for example, uh, Russians</p>
<p>were subjected to.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if there&rsquo;s one good thing that comes out of war, it&rsquo;s literature, art, and humor</p>
<p>and music.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think almost everything is good about war except for death and destruction.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Without the death, it would bring, uh, the romance of it.</p>
<p>The whole thing is nice.</p>
<p>Well, this is why we&rsquo;re always caught up in war and we have this very ambiguous relationship</p>
<p>to it is that it makes life real and pressing and meaningful and at an unacceptable price</p>
<p>and the price has never been higher.</p>
<p>So just jump in, uh, into AI a little bit.</p>
<p>You, uh, in one of the conversations you had or one of the videos, you described that one</p>
<p>of the things AI systems can&rsquo;t do and biological systems can is self replicate in the physical</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Oh no, no.</p>
<p>In the physical world.</p>
<p>Well, yes, the physical robots can&rsquo;t self replicate, but the fit, but you, this is a</p>
<p>very tricky point, which is that the only thing that we&rsquo;ve been able to create that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really complex that has an analog of our reproductive system is software.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, software replicates itself.</p>
<p>Uh, if we&rsquo;re speaking strictly for the replication in this kind of digital space.</p>
<p>So let me just to begin, let me ask a question.</p>
<p>Do you see a protective barrier or a gap between the physical world and the digital world?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not call it digital.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it the logical world versus the physical world.</p>
<p>Why logical?</p>
<p>Well, because even though we had, let&rsquo;s say Einstein&rsquo;s brain preserved, uh, it was meaningless</p>
<p>to us as a physical object because we couldn&rsquo;t do anything with what was stored in it at</p>
<p>a logical level.</p>
<p>And so the idea that something may be stored logically and that it may be stored physically,</p>
<p>uh, are not necessarily, uh, we don&rsquo;t always benefit from synonymizing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that there isn&rsquo;t a material basis to the logical world, but that it does</p>
<p>warrant identification with a separate layer that need not invoke logic gates and zeros</p>
<p>and ones.</p>
<p>And uh, so connecting those two worlds, the logical world and the physical world, or maybe</p>
<p>just connecting to the logical world inside our brain, Einstein&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>You mentioned the idea of out, outtelligence.</p>
<p>Artificial outtelligence.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is the only essay that John Brockman ever invited me to write that he refused to</p>
<p>publish in Edge.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t, it wasn&rsquo;t well written, um, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The idea is quite compelling is quite unique and new and at least from my view of a stance</p>
<p>point, maybe you can explain it.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What I was thinking about is why it is that we&rsquo;re waiting to be terrified by artificial</p>
<p>general intelligence when in fact, artificial life, uh, is terrifying in and of itself and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already here.</p>
<p>So in order to have a system of selective pressures, you need three distinct elements.</p>
<p>You need variation within a population.</p>
<p>You need heritability and you need differential success.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s really unique and I&rsquo;ve made this point, I think elsewhere about software is</p>
<p>that if you think about what humans know how to build, that&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>So I always take a car and I say, does it have an analog of each of the physical physiological</p>
<p>systems?</p>
<p>Does it have a skeletal structure?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s its frame.</p>
<p>Does it have a neurological structure?</p>
<p>Has an on board computer, has a digestive system.</p>
<p>The one thing it doesn&rsquo;t have is a reproductive system.</p>
<p>But if you can call spawn on a process, effectively you do have a reproductive system and that</p>
<p>means that you can create something with variation, heritability and differential success.</p>
<p>Now the next step in the chain of thinking was where do we see inanimate, non intelligent</p>
<p>life outwitting intelligent life?</p>
<p>And um, I have two favorite systems and I try to stay on them so that we don&rsquo;t get distracted.</p>
<p>One of which is the Ofres orchid, um, subspecies or subclade.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to call it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a type of flower.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a type of flower that mimics the female of a pollinator species in order to</p>
<p>dupe the males into, uh, engaging.</p>
<p>It was called pseudo copulation with the fake female, which is usually represented by the</p>
<p>lowest pedal.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a pheromone component to fool the males into thinking they have a mating</p>
<p>opportunity.</p>
<p>But the flower doesn&rsquo;t have to give up energy energy in the form of nectar as a lure because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tricking the males.</p>
<p>The other system is a particular species, uh, of muscle lampicillus in the clear streams</p>
<p>of Missouri and it fools bass into biting a fleshy lip that contain its young.</p>
<p>And when the bass see this fleshy lip, which looks exactly like a species of fish that</p>
<p>the bass like to eat, the, uh, the young explode and clamp onto the gills and parasitize the</p>
<p>bass and also lose the best redistribute them as they eventually release both of these systems.</p>
<p>You have a highly intelligent dupe being fooled by a lower life form and what is sculpting</p>
<p>these, these convincing lures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the intelligence of previously duped targets for these strategies.</p>
<p>So when the target is smart enough to avoid the strategy, uh, those weaker mimics, uh,</p>
<p>fall off.</p>
<p>They have terminal lines and only the better ones survive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an arms race between the target species, uh, that is being parasitized, getting smarter</p>
<p>and this other less intelligent or non intelligent object getting as if smarter.</p>
<p>And so what you see is, is that artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>is not needed to parasitize us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply sufficient for us to outwit ourselves.</p>
<p>So you could have a program, let&rsquo;s say, you know, one of these Nigerian scams, um, that</p>
<p>writes letters and uses whoever sends it Bitcoin, uh, to figure out which aspects of the program</p>
<p>should be kept, which should be varied and thrown away.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t need it to be in any way intelligent in order to have a really nightmarish scenario</p>
<p>of being parasitized by something that has no idea what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>So you, you, you phrased a few concepts really eloquently.</p>
<p>So let me try to, uh, as a few directions this goes.</p>
<p>So one first, first of all, in the way we write software today, it&rsquo;s not common that</p>
<p>we allow it to self modify.</p>
<p>But we do have that ability.</p>
<p>Now we have the ability, it&rsquo;s just not common.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just common.</p>
<p>So, so your, your thought is that that is a serious worry.</p>
<p>If there becomes, uh,</p>
<p>Self modifying code is, is available now.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s different types of self modification, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a personalization, you know, your email app, your Gmail is a self modifying</p>
<p>to you after you log in or whatever you can think of it that way.</p>
<p>But ultimately it&rsquo;s central, all the information is centralized, but you&rsquo;re thinking of ideas</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re completely, so this is an unique entity, uh, operating under selective pressures</p>
<p>and it changes.</p>
<p>Well, you just, if you think about the fact that our immune systems, uh, don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming at them next, but they have a small set of spanning components and if it&rsquo;s, if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sufficiently expressive system in that any shape, uh, or binding region can be approximated,</p>
<p>uh, with, with the Lego that is present, um, then you can have confidence that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to know what&rsquo;s coming at you because the combinatorics, um, are sufficient to reach</p>
<p>any configuration needed.</p>
<p>Uh, so that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Well, terrifying thing to worry about because it&rsquo;s so within our reach.</p>
<p>Whatever I suggest these things, I do always have a concern as to whether or not I will</p>
<p>bring them into being by talking about them.</p>
<p>So, uh, there&rsquo;s this thing from open AI, uh, next, next week to talk to the founder of</p>
<p>open AI, uh, this idea that, uh, their text generation, the new, uh, the new stuff they</p>
<p>have for generating texts is they didn&rsquo;t want to bring it, they didn&rsquo;t want to release it</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re worried about the.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to hear that, but they&rsquo;re going to end up releasing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing is I think talking about it, um, well, at least from my end, I&rsquo;m more</p>
<p>a proponent of technology preventing tech, uh, so further innovation, preventing the</p>
<p>detrimental effects of innovation.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re at a, we&rsquo;re sort of tumbling down a hill at accelerating speed.</p>
<p>So whether or not we&rsquo;re proponents or it doesn&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t really, it may not matter, but</p>
<p>I, well, I do feel that there are people who&rsquo;ve held things back and, uh, you know, died poor</p>
<p>than they might&rsquo;ve otherwise been.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know their names.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we should discount the idea that having the smartest people showing</p>
<p>off how smart they are by what they&rsquo;ve developed may be a terminal process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very mindful in particular of a beautiful letter that Edward Teller of all people wrote</p>
<p>to Leo Zillard and where Zillard was trying to figure out how to control the use of atomic</p>
<p>weaponry at the end of world war II and teller rather strangely because many of us view him</p>
<p>as a monster, um, showed some, a very advanced moral thinking talking about the slim chance</p>
<p>we have for survival and that the only hope is to make Warren thinkable.</p>
<p>I do think that not enough of us feel in our gut what it is we are playing with when we</p>
<p>are working on technical problems.</p>
<p>And I would recommend to anyone who hasn&rsquo;t seen it, a movie called the bridge over the</p>
<p>bridge on the river Kwai about, I believe captured British POWs who just in a desire</p>
<p>to do a bridge well, end up over collaborating with their Japanese captors.</p>
<p>Well now you&rsquo;re making me a question the unrestricted open discussion of ideas and AI.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I know the answer, I&rsquo;m just saying that I could make a decent case for</p>
<p>either our need to talk about this and to become technologically focused on containing</p>
<p>it or need to stop talking about this and try to hope that the relatively small number</p>
<p>of highly adept individuals who are looking at these problems is small enough that we</p>
<p>should in fact be talking about how to contain them.</p>
<p>Well the way ideas, the way innovation happens, what new ideas develop, Newton with calculus,</p>
<p>whether if he was silent, the idea would be, would emerge elsewhere in the case of Newton</p>
<p>of course.</p>
<p>But in the case of AI, how small is the set of individuals out of which such ideas would</p>
<p>arise?</p>
<p>Well the idea is that the researchers we know and those that we don&rsquo;t know who may live</p>
<p>in countries that don&rsquo;t wish us to know what level they&rsquo;re currently at are very disciplined</p>
<p>in keeping these things to themselves.</p>
<p>Of course I will point out that there&rsquo;s a religious school in Kerala that developed</p>
<p>something very close to the calculus, certainly in terms of infinite series in I guess religious</p>
<p>prayer and rhyme and prose.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that Newton had any ability to hold that back and I don&rsquo;t really believe</p>
<p>that we have an ability to hold it back.</p>
<p>I do think that we could change the proportion of the time we spend worrying about the effects</p>
<p>of what if we are successful rather than simply trying to succeed and hope that we&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to contain things later.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>So on the idea of intelligence, what form, treading cautiously as we&rsquo;ve agreed as we</p>
<p>tumbled down the hill, what form&hellip;</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t stop ourselves, can we?</p>
<p>We cannot.</p>
<p>What form do you see it taking?</p>
<p>So one example, Facebook, Google, do want to, I don&rsquo;t know a better word, you want to</p>
<p>influence users to behave a certain way and so that&rsquo;s one kind of example of how intelligence</p>
<p>is systems perhaps modifying the behavior of these intelligent human beings in order</p>
<p>to sell more product of different kinds.</p>
<p>But do you see other examples of this actually emerging in&hellip;</p>
<p>Just take any parasitic system, make sure that there&rsquo;s some way in which that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>differential success, heritability, and variation.</p>
<p>And those are the magic ingredients and if you really wanted to build a nightmare machine,</p>
<p>make sure that the system that expresses the variability has a spanning set so that it</p>
<p>can learn to arbitrary levels by making it sufficiently expressive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your nightmare.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s your nightmare, but it could also be, it&rsquo;s a really powerful mechanism by which</p>
<p>to create, well, powerful systems.</p>
<p>So are you more worried about the negative direction that might go versus the positive?</p>
<p>So you said parasitic, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be what the system converges towards.</p>
<p>It could be, what is it?</p>
<p>And the dividing line between parasitism and symbiosis is not so clear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they tell me about marriage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still single, so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well yeah, we could go into that too, but no, I think we have to appreciate, are you</p>
<p>infected by your own mitochondria?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in marriage, you fear the loss of independence, but even though the American therapeutic community</p>
<p>may be very concerned about codependence, what&rsquo;s to say that codependence isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>necessary to have a stable relationship in which to raise children who are maximally</p>
<p>case selected and require incredible amounts of care because you have to wait 13 years</p>
<p>before there&rsquo;s any reproductive payout and most of us don&rsquo;t want our 13 year olds having</p>
<p>kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very tricky situation to analyze and I would say that predators and parasites</p>
<p>drive much of our evolution and I don&rsquo;t know whether to be angry at them or thank them.</p>
<p>Well ultimately, I mean nobody knows the meaning of life or what even happiness is, but there</p>
<p>is some metrics.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t tell you?</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why all the poetry and books are about, you know, there&rsquo;s some metrics under which</p>
<p>you can kind of measure how good it is that these AI systems are roaming about.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re more nervous about software than you are optimistic about ideas of, yeah, self</p>
<p>replicating largely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve really felt where we are.</p>
<p>You know, occasionally we get a wake up, 9 11 was so anomalous compared to everything</p>
<p>else we&rsquo;ve experienced on American soil that it came to us as a complete shock that that</p>
<p>was even a possibility.</p>
<p>What it really was was a highly creative and determined R and D team deep in the bowels</p>
<p>of Afghanistan showing us that we had certain exploits that we were open to that nobody</p>
<p>had chosen to express.</p>
<p>I can think of several of these things that I don&rsquo;t talk about publicly that just seem</p>
<p>to have to do with, um, how relatively unimaginative those who wish to cause havoc and destruction</p>
<p>have been up until now.</p>
<p>But the great mystery of our time of this particular little era is how remarkably stable</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been since 1945 when we demonstrated the ability to use a nuclear weapons in anger.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know why things like that haven&rsquo;t happened since then.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had several close calls, we&rsquo;ve had mistakes, we&rsquo;ve had a brinksmanship.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s now happened is that we&rsquo;ve settled into a sense that, Oh, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;ll always</p>
<p>be nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been so long since something was at that level of danger that we&rsquo;ve got a wrong idea</p>
<p>in our head.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why when I went on the Ben Shapiro show, I talked about the need to resume above</p>
<p>ground testing of nuclear devices because we have people whose developmental experience</p>
<p>suggests that when let&rsquo;s say Donald Trump and North Korea engage on Twitter, Oh, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just posturing.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s just in it for money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s an, a sense that people are in a video game mode, which has been the right</p>
<p>call since 1945.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been mostly in video game mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re worried about a generation which has not seen any existential.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lived under it.</p>
<p>You see, you&rsquo;re younger.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, if, and again, you came from, from Moscow.</p>
<p>There was a TV show called the day after that had a huge effect on a generation growing</p>
<p>up in the U S and it talked about what life would be like after a nuclear exchange.</p>
<p>We have not gone through an embodied experience collectively where we&rsquo;ve thought about this.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s one of the most irresponsible things that the elders among us have done,</p>
<p>which is to provide this beautiful garden in which the thorns are cut off of the, of</p>
<p>the Rose bushes and all of the edges are rounded and sanded.</p>
<p>And so people have developed this, this totally unreal idea, which is everything&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be just fine.</p>
<p>And do I think that my leading concern is AGI or my leading concern is a thermonuclear</p>
<p>exchange or gene drives or any one of these things?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I know that our time here in this very long experiment here is finite</p>
<p>because the toys that we&rsquo;ve built are so impressive and the wisdom to accompany them has not materialized.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s, we actually got a wisdom uptick since 1945.</p>
<p>We had a lot of dangerous skilled players on the world stage who nevertheless, no matter</p>
<p>how bad they were managed to not embroil us in something that we couldn&rsquo;t come back from</p>
<p>the cold war.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the distance from the cold war, you know, I&rsquo;m very mindful of a, there was</p>
<p>a Russian tradition actually of on your wedding day, going to visit a memorial to those who</p>
<p>gave their lives.</p>
<p>Can you imagine this where you, on the happiest day of your life, you go and you pay homage</p>
<p>to the people who fought and died in the battle of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of communism, I got to say, but there were a couple of things that</p>
<p>the Russians did that were really positive in the Soviet era.</p>
<p>And I think trying to let people know how serious life actually is, is the Russian model</p>
<p>of seriousness is better than the American model.</p>
<p>And maybe like you mentioned, there was a small echo of that after 9 11.</p>
<p>But we wouldn&rsquo;t let it form.</p>
<p>We talk about 9 11, but it&rsquo;s 9 12 that really moved the needle when we were all just there</p>
<p>and nobody wanted to speak.</p>
<p>We witnessed something super serious and we didn&rsquo;t want to run to our computers and blast</p>
<p>out our deep thoughts and our feelings.</p>
<p>And it was profound because we woke up briefly, you know, I talk about the gated institutional</p>
<p>narrative that sort of programs our lives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it break three times in my life, one of which was the election of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Another time was the fall of Lehman Brothers when everybody who knew that Bear Stearns</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that important knew that Lehman Brothers met AIG was next.</p>
<p>And the other one was 9 11.</p>
<p>And so if I&rsquo;m 53 years old and I only remember three times that the global narrative was</p>
<p>really interrupted, that tells you how much we&rsquo;ve been on top of developing events.</p>
<p>You know, I mean we had the Murrow federal building explosion, but it didn&rsquo;t cause the</p>
<p>narrative to break.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t profound enough.</p>
<p>Around 9 12 we started to wake up out of our slumber and the powers that be did not want</p>
<p>to coming together.</p>
<p>They, you know, the admonition was go shopping.</p>
<p>And the powers that be was what is that force as opposed to blaming individuals?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So whatever that, whatever that force is, there&rsquo;s a component of it that&rsquo;s emergent</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a component of it that&rsquo;s deliberate.</p>
<p>So give yourself a portfolio with two components.</p>
<p>Some amount of it is emergent, but some amount of it is also an understanding that if people</p>
<p>come together, they become an incredible force.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re seeing right now I think is there are forces that are trying to come together</p>
<p>and there are forces that are trying to push things apart.</p>
<p>And you know, one of them is the globalist narrative versus the national narrative where</p>
<p>to the global, uh, globalist perspective, uh, the nation nations are bad things in essence</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re temporary, they&rsquo;re nationalistic, they&rsquo;re jingoistic, it&rsquo;s all negative to people</p>
<p>in the national, more in the national idiom, they&rsquo;re saying, look, this is where I pay</p>
<p>my taxes.</p>
<p>This is where I do my army service.</p>
<p>This is where I have a vote.</p>
<p>This is where I have a passport.</p>
<p>Who the hell are you to tell me that because you&rsquo;ve moved into someplace that you can make</p>
<p>money globally, that you&rsquo;ve chosen to abandon other people to whom you have a special and</p>
<p>elevated duty.</p>
<p>And I think that these competing narratives have been pushing towards the global perspective,</p>
<p>uh, from the elite and a larger and larger number of disenfranchised people are saying,</p>
<p>hey, I actually live in a, in a place and I have laws and I speak a language, I have</p>
<p>a culture.</p>
<p>And who are you to tell me that because you can profit in some far away land that my obligations</p>
<p>to my fellow countrymen are so, so much diminished.</p>
<p>So these tensions between nations and so on, ultimately you see being proud of your country</p>
<p>and so on, which creates potentially the kind of things that led to wars and so on.</p>
<p>They, they ultimately, it is human nature and it is good for us for wake up calls of</p>
<p>different kinds.</p>
<p>Well, I think that these are tensions and my point isn&rsquo;t, I mean, nationalism run amok</p>
<p>is a nightmare and internationalism run amok is a nightmare.</p>
<p>And the problem is we&rsquo;re trying to push these pendulums, uh, to some place where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>somewhat balanced, where we, we have a higher duty of care to those, uh, who share our log,</p>
<p>our laws and our citizenship, but we don&rsquo;t forget our duties of care to the global system.</p>
<p>I would think this is elementary, but the problem that we&rsquo;re facing concerns the ability</p>
<p>for some to profit at the, by abandoning their obligations, uh, to others within their system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve had for decades.</p>
<p>You mentioned nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>I was hoping to get answers from you since one of the many things you&rsquo;ve done as a economics</p>
<p>and maybe you can understand human behavior of why the heck we haven&rsquo;t blown each other</p>
<p>up yet.</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>So, uh, we&rsquo;ll get back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important to say that we really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>A mild uptick in wisdom.</p>
<p>Well, Steven Pinker, who I&rsquo;ve talked with has a lot of really good ideas about why,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t trust his optimism.</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m Russian, so I never trust a guy who was that optimistic.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;re talking about a guy who&rsquo;s looking at a system in which more and</p>
<p>more of the kinetic energy like war has been turned into potential energy, like unused</p>
<p>nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>You know, now I&rsquo;m looking at that system and I&rsquo;m saying, okay, well, if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a potential energy term, then everything&rsquo;s just getting better and better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>Only a physicist could.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a physicist.</p>
<p>Is that a dirty word?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I wish I were a physicist.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s a physicist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to live up that probably for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably gonna listen to this too.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So your friend, Sam Harris, uh, worries a lot about the existential threat of AI.</p>
<p>Not in the way that you&rsquo;ve described, but in the more, well, he hangs out with Elon.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Elon.</p>
<p>So are you worried about that kind of, uh, you know, about the, um, about either robotic</p>
<p>systems or, you know, traditionally defined AI systems essentially becoming a super intelligent,</p>
<p>much more intelligent than human beings and, uh, getting, well, they already are and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not when, when seen as a, um, a collective, you mean, well, I mean, I, I can mean all</p>
<p>sorts of things, but certainly many of the things that we thought were peculiar to general</p>
<p>intelligence or do not require general intelligence.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been one of the big awakenings that you can write a pretty convincing sports story</p>
<p>from stats alone, uh, without needing to have watched the game.</p>
<p>So you know, is it possible to write lively pros about politics?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, not yet.</p>
<p>So we were sort of all over the map.</p>
<p>One of the, one of the things about chess that you&rsquo;ll, there&rsquo;s a question I once asked</p>
<p>on Quora that didn&rsquo;t get a lot of response, which was what is the greatest brilliancy</p>
<p>ever produced by a computer in a chess game, which was different than the question of what</p>
<p>is the greatest game ever played.</p>
<p>So if you think about brilliancies is what really animates many of us to think of chess</p>
<p>as an art form.</p>
<p>Those are those moves and combinations that just show such flair, panache and, and, and</p>
<p>in soul, um, computers weren&rsquo;t really great at that.</p>
<p>They were great positional monsters and you know, recently we, we&rsquo;ve started seeing brilliancies</p>
<p>and so.</p>
<p>The grandmasters have identified with, uh, with alpha zero that things were quite brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a, you know, that&rsquo;s an example of something we don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s AGI, but in a very restricted set, a set of rules like chess, you&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>to see poetry, uh, of a high order.</p>
<p>And, and so I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t like the idea that we&rsquo;re waiting for AGI, AGI is sort of</p>
<p>slowly infiltrating our lives in the same way that I don&rsquo;t think a worm should be, you</p>
<p>know, the C elegans shouldn&rsquo;t be treated as non conscious because it only has 300 neurons.</p>
<p>Maybe it just has a very low level of consciousness because we don&rsquo;t understand what these things</p>
<p>mean as they scale up.</p>
<p>So am I worried about this general phenomena?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But I think that one of the things that&rsquo;s happening is that a lot of us are fretting</p>
<p>about this, uh, in part because of human needs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always been worried about the Golem, right?</p>
<p>Well, the Golem is the artificially created life, you know, it&rsquo;s like Frankenstein.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Jewish version and, um, Frankenberg, Frankenstein, yeah, that&rsquo;s makes sense, right?</p>
<p>So the, uh, but we&rsquo;ve always been worried about creating something like this and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting closer and closer and there are ways in which</p>
<p>we have to realize that the whole thing is kind of, the whole thing that we&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>are the context of our lives is almost certainly coming to an end.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that, uh, we won&rsquo;t survive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that it&rsquo;s coming tomorrow and it could be 300, 500 years, but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no plan that I&rsquo;m aware of if we have three rocks that we could possibly inhabit</p>
<p>that are, uh, sensible within current technological dreams, the earth, the moon and Mars.</p>
<p>And we have a very competitive civilization that is still forced into violence to sort</p>
<p>out disputes that cannot be arbitrated.</p>
<p>It is not clear to me that we have a longterm future until we get to the next stage, which</p>
<p>is to figure out whether or not the Einsteinian speed limit can be broken.</p>
<p>And that requires our source code.</p>
<p>Our source code, the stuff in our brains to figure out what do you mean by our source</p>
<p>code?</p>
<p>The source code of the context, whatever it is that produces the quarks, the electrons,</p>
<p>the neutrinos.</p>
<p>Oh, our source code.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>So this is,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about stuff that&rsquo;s written in a higher level language.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about the low level, the bits.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what is currently keeping us here.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even imagine, you know, we have harebrained schemes for staying within the Einsteinian</p>
<p>speed limit.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, maybe if we could just drug ourselves and go into a suspended state or</p>
<p>we could have multiple generations of that, I think all that stuff is pretty silly, but</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also pretty silly to imagine that our wisdom is going to increase to the</p>
<p>point that we can have the toys we have and, uh, we&rsquo;re not going to use them for 500 years.</p>
<p>Speaking of Einstein, I had a profound breakthrough when I realized you&rsquo;re just one letter away</p>
<p>from the guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m also one letter away from Feinstein.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, well, you get to pick.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So unified theory, you know, you&rsquo;ve worked, uh, you, you enjoy the beauty of geometry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know if you enjoy it.</p>
<p>You certainly are quite good at it.</p>
<p>I tremble before it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re religious, that is one of the, I don&rsquo;t have to be religious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>You will tremble anyway.</p>
<p>I mean, I just read Einstein&rsquo;s biography and one of the ways, uh, one of the things you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done is try to explore a unified theory, uh, talking about a 14 dimensional observers that</p>
<p>has the 4d space time continuum embedded in it.</p>
<p>I, I&rsquo;m just curious how you think and how philosophically at a high level about something</p>
<p>more than four dimensions, uh, how do you try to, what, what does it make you feel?</p>
<p>Talking in the mathematical world about dimensions that are greater than the ones we can perceive.</p>
<p>Is there something that you take away that&rsquo;s more than just the math?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, stick out your tongue at me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now on the front of that time, yeah, there was a sweet receptor and next to that were</p>
<p>salt receptors and two different sides, a little bit farther back.</p>
<p>There were sour receptors and you wouldn&rsquo;t show me the back of your tongue where your</p>
<p>bitter receptor was.</p>
<p>Show the good side always.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you had four dimensions of taste receptors, but you also had pain receptors on that tongue</p>
<p>and probably heat receptors on that time.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s assume that you had one of each, that would be six dimensions.</p>
<p>So when you eat something, you eat a slice of pizza and it&rsquo;s got some, some, uh, some</p>
<p>hot pepper on it, maybe some jalapeno, you&rsquo;re having a six dimensional experience, dude.</p>
<p>Do you think we overemphasize the value of time as one of the dimensions or space?</p>
<p>Well, we certainly overemphasize the value of time cause we like things to start and</p>
<p>end or we really don&rsquo;t like things to end, but they seem to.</p>
<p>Well, what if you flipped one of the spatial dimensions into being a temporal dimension?</p>
<p>And you and I were to meet in New York city and say, well, where, where and when should</p>
<p>we meet?</p>
<p>What about, I&rsquo;ll meet you on a 36 in Lexington at two in the afternoon and uh, 11 oclock</p>
<p>in the morning.</p>
<p>That would be very confusing.</p>
<p>Well, so it&rsquo;s convenient for us to think about time, you mean.</p>
<p>We happen to be in a delicious situation in which we have three dimensions of space and</p>
<p>one of time and they&rsquo;re woven together in this sort of strange fabric where we can trade</p>
<p>off a little space for a little time, but we still only have one dimension that is picked</p>
<p>out relative to the other three.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much Gladys Knight and the pips.</p>
<p>So which one developed for who?</p>
<p>Do we develop for these dimensions or did the dimensions or were they always there and</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Well, do you imagine that there isn&rsquo;t a place where there are four temporal dimensions or</p>
<p>two and two of space and time or three of time and one of space and then would time</p>
<p>not be playing the role of space?</p>
<p>Why do you imagine that the sector that you&rsquo;re in is all that there is?</p>
<p>I certainly do not, but I can&rsquo;t imagine otherwise.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t done ayahuasca or any of those drugs that hope to one day, but instead</p>
<p>of doing ayahuasca, you could just head over to building two.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the mathematicians are?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s where they hang.</p>
<p>Just to look at some geometry.</p>
<p>Well, just ask about pseudo Ramanian geometry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Or you could talk to a shaman and end up in Peru.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s an extra money for that trip.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you won&rsquo;t be able to do any calculations if that&rsquo;s how you choose to go about it.</p>
<p>Well, a different kind of calculation, so to speak.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One of my favorite people, Edward Frankel, Berkeley professor, author of Love and Math,</p>
<p>great title for a book, said that you are quite a remarkable intellect to come up with</p>
<p>such beautiful original ideas in terms of unified theory and so on, but you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>outside academia.</p>
<p>So one question in developing ideas that are truly original, truly interesting, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the difference between inside academia and outside academia when it comes to developing</p>
<p>such ideas?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a terrible choice.</p>
<p>Terrible choice.</p>
<p>So if you do it inside of academics, you are forced to constantly show great loyalty to</p>
<p>the consensus and you distinguish yourself with small, almost microscopic heresies to</p>
<p>make your reputation in general.</p>
<p>And you have very competent people and brilliant people who are working together, who form</p>
<p>very deep social networks and have a very high level of behavior, at least within mathematics</p>
<p>and at least technically within physics, theoretical physics.</p>
<p>When you go outside, you meet lunatics and crazy people, madmen.</p>
<p>And these are people who do not usually subscribe to the consensus position and almost always</p>
<p>lose their way.</p>
<p>And the key question is, will progress likely come from someone who has miraculously managed</p>
<p>to stay within the system and is able to take on a larger amount of heresy that is sort</p>
<p>of unthinkable?</p>
<p>In which case, that will be fascinating, or is it more likely that somebody will maintain</p>
<p>a level of discipline from outside of academics and be able to make use of the freedom that</p>
<p>comes from not having to constantly affirm your loyalty to the consensus of your field?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve characterized in ways that academia in this particular sense is declining.</p>
<p>You posted a plot, the older population of the faculty is getting larger, the younger</p>
<p>is getting smaller and so on.</p>
<p>So which direction of the two are you more hopeful about?</p>
<p>Well, the baby boomers can&rsquo;t hang on forever.</p>
<p>First of all, in general, true, and second of all, in academia.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really what this time is about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re used to financial bubbles that last a few years in length and then pop.</p>
<p>The baby boomer bubble is this really long lived thing, and all of the ideology, all</p>
<p>of the behavior patterns, the norms.</p>
<p>For example, string theory is an almost entirely baby boomer phenomenon.</p>
<p>It was something that baby boomers were able to do because it required a very high level</p>
<p>of mathematical ability.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think of string theory as an original idea?</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, it was original to Veneziano, probably is older than the baby boomers.</p>
<p>And there are people who are younger than the baby boomers who are still doing string</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that nothing discovered within the large string theoretic complex</p>
<p>is wrong.</p>
<p>Quite the contrary.</p>
<p>A lot of brilliant mathematics and a lot of the structure of physics was elucidated by</p>
<p>string theorists.</p>
<p>What do I think of the deliverable nature of this product that will not ship called</p>
<p>string theory?</p>
<p>I think that it is largely an affirmative action program for highly mathematically and</p>
<p>geometrically talented baby boomer physics physicists so that they can say that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working on something within the constraints of what they will say is quantum gravity.</p>
<p>Now there are other schemes, you know, there&rsquo;s like asymptotic safety, there are other things</p>
<p>that you could imagine doing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think much of any of the major programs, but to have inflicted this level of loyalty</p>
<p>through a shibboleth.</p>
<p>Well, surely you don&rsquo;t question X.</p>
<p>Well, I question almost everything in the string program.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I got out of physics.</p>
<p>When you called me a physicist, it was a great honor, but the reason I didn&rsquo;t become a physicist</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that I fell in love with mathematics.</p>
<p>I said, wow, in 1984, 1983, I saw the field going mad and I saw that mathematics, which</p>
<p>has all sorts of problems, was not going insane.</p>
<p>And so instead of studying things within physics, I thought it was much safer to study the same</p>
<p>objects within mathematics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge price to pay for that.</p>
<p>You lose physical intuition.</p>
<p>But the point is, is that it wasn&rsquo;t a North Korean reeducation camp either.</p>
<p>Are you hopeful about cracking open the Einstein unified theory in a way that has been really,</p>
<p>really understanding whether this, uh, uniting everything together with quantum theory and</p>
<p>so on?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m trying to play this role myself to do it to the extent of handing it over</p>
<p>to the more responsible, more professional, more competent community.</p>
<p>Um, so I think that they&rsquo;re wrong about a great number of their belief structures, but</p>
<p>I do believe, I mean, I have a really profound love, hate relationship with this group of</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>I think the physics side, cause the mathematicians actually seem to be much more open minded</p>
<p>and uh, well they are and they aren&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re open minded about anything that looks like</p>
<p>great math.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll study something that isn&rsquo;t very important physics, but if it&rsquo;s beautiful mathematics,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll have a, they have great intuition about these things as good as the mathematicians</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>And I might even intellectually at some horsepower level, give them the edge.</p>
<p>The theoretical theoretical physics community is bar none.</p>
<p>The most profound intellectual community that we have ever created.</p>
<p>It is the number one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody in second place as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, like in their spare time and the</p>
<p>spare time they invented molecular biology.</p>
<p>What, what was the origin of molecular biology?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying something like Francis Crick.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of, a lot of the early molecular biologists were physicists.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, Schrodinger wrote what is life and that was highly inspirational.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to appreciate that there is no community like the basic research community</p>
<p>in theoretical physics and it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m highly critical of these guys.</p>
<p>I think that they would just wasted the decades of time with a near religious devotion to</p>
<p>their misconception of where the problems were in physics.</p>
<p>But this has been the greatest intellectual collapse ever witnessed within academics.</p>
<p>You see it as a collapse or just a lull?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m terrified that we&rsquo;re about to lose the vitality.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t afford to pay these people.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t afford to give them an accelerator just to play with in case they find something</p>
<p>at the next energy level.</p>
<p>These people created our economy.</p>
<p>They gave us the rad lab and radar.</p>
<p>They gave us two atomic devices to end world war two.</p>
<p>They created the semiconductor and the transistor to power our economy through Moore&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>As a positive externality of particle accelerators, they created the worldwide web and we have</p>
<p>the insolence to say, why should we fund you with our taxpayer dollars?</p>
<p>No, the question is, are you enjoying your physics dollars?</p>
<p>These guys signed the world&rsquo;s worst licensing agreement and if they simply charged for every</p>
<p>time you used a transistor or a URL or enjoyed the piece that they have provided during this</p>
<p>period of time through the terrible weapons that they developed or your communications</p>
<p>devices, all of the things that power our economy, I really think came out of physics,</p>
<p>even to the extent the chemistry came out of physics and molecular biology came out</p>
<p>of physics.</p>
<p>So, first of all, you have to know that I&rsquo;m very critical of this community.</p>
<p>Second of all, it is our most important community.</p>
<p>We have neglected it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve abused it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t take it seriously.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even care to get them to rehab after a couple of generations of failure, right?</p>
<p>No one, I think the youngest person to have really contributed to the standard model of</p>
<p>theoretical level was born in 1951, right?</p>
<p>Frank Wilczek and almost nothing has happened that in theoretical physics after 1973, 74</p>
<p>that sent somebody to Stockholm for theoretical development that predicted experiment.</p>
<p>So we have to understand that we are doing this to ourselves.</p>
<p>Now, with that said, these guys have behaved abysmally in my opinion because they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>owned up to where they actually are, what problems they&rsquo;re really facing, how definite</p>
<p>they can actually be.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t shared some of their most brilliant discoveries, which are desperately needed</p>
<p>in other fields like gauge theory, which at least the mathematicians can, can share, which</p>
<p>is an upgrade of the differential calculus of Newton and Leibniz.</p>
<p>And they haven&rsquo;t shared the importance of renormalization theory.</p>
<p>Even though this should be standard operating procedure for people across the sciences dealing</p>
<p>with different layers and different levels of phenomena.</p>
<p>And by shared, you mean communicated in such a way that it disseminates throughout the</p>
<p>different sizes.</p>
<p>These guys are sitting, both theoretical physicists and mathematicians are sitting on top of a</p>
<p>giant stockpile of intellectual gold, right?</p>
<p>They have so many things that have not been manifested anywhere.</p>
<p>I was just on Twitter, I think I mentioned the Habermann switch pitch that shows the</p>
<p>self duality of the tetrahedron realized as a linkage mechanism.</p>
<p>Now this is like a triviality and it makes an amazing toy that&rsquo;s, you know, built a market,</p>
<p>hopefully a fortune for Chuck Habermann.</p>
<p>Well, you have no idea how much great stuff that these priests have in their monastery.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s truly a love and hate relationship for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like it&rsquo;s more on the love side.</p>
<p>This building that we&rsquo;re in right here is the building in which I really put together</p>
<p>the conspiracy between the National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation</p>
<p>through the government university industry research round table to destroy the bargaining</p>
<p>power of American academics, uh, using foreign labor with, uh, on microfeature in the base.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>That was done here in this building.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that weird?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m truly speaking with a revolutionary and a radical, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no,</p>
<p>no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>At an intellectual level, I am absolutely garden variety.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just straight down the middle.</p>
<p>The system that we are in this, this university is functionally insane.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Harvard is functionally insane and we don&rsquo;t understand that when we get these things wrong,</p>
<p>the financial crisis made this very clear.</p>
<p>There was a long period where every grownup, everybody with a tie, uh, who spoke in a,</p>
<p>you know, in Barrett, baritone tones, uh, with, with the right degree at the end of</p>
<p>their name.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, we&rsquo;re talking about how we banished volunteer volatility.</p>
<p>We were in the great moderation.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They were all crazy.</p>
<p>And who was, who was right?</p>
<p>It was like Nassim Taleb, Nouriel Roubini.</p>
<p>Now what happens is, is that they claimed the market went crazy, but the market didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go crazy.</p>
<p>The market had been crazy and what happened is, is that it suddenly went sane.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s where we are with academics.</p>
<p>Academics right now is mad as a hatter and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s absolutely evident.</p>
<p>I can show you graph after graph.</p>
<p>I can show you the internal discussions.</p>
<p>I can show you the conspiracies.</p>
<p>Barrett&rsquo;s dealing with one right now over, uh, it&rsquo;s admissions policies for people, uh,</p>
<p>of color, uh, who happened to come from Asia.</p>
<p>All of this madness is necessary to keep the game going.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about just on, well, we&rsquo;re on the topic of revolutionaries is we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the danger of an outbreak of sanity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re the guy pointing out the elephant in the room here and the elephant has no clothes.</p>
<p>Is that how that goes?</p>
<p>I was going to talk a little bit to, uh, Joe Rogan about this, ran out of time, but I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, you have some, you, just listening to you, you could probably speak really eloquently</p>
<p>to academia on the difference between the different fields.</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s a difference between science, engineering, and then the humanities</p>
<p>in academia in terms of tolerance that they&rsquo;re willing to tolerate?</p>
<p>So from my perspective, I thought computer science and maybe engineering is more tolerant</p>
<p>to radical ideas, but that&rsquo;s perhaps innocent of me is that I always, you know, all the</p>
<p>battles going on now are a little bit more on the humanity side and gender studies and</p>
<p>so on.</p>
<p>Have you seen the, uh, American mathematical society&rsquo;s publication of an essay called get</p>
<p>out the way?</p>
<p>I have not.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s the idea is that white men who hold, uh, positions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Within universities and mathematics should vacate their positions so that young black</p>
<p>women can take over something like this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in terms of diversity, which I also want to ask you about, but in terms of diversity</p>
<p>of strictly ideas, do you think, cause you&rsquo;re basically saying physics as a community has</p>
<p>become a little bit intolerant to some degree to new radical ideas, or at least you, uh,</p>
<p>you said it&rsquo;s changed a little bit recently, which is that even string theory is now admitting,</p>
<p>okay, we don&rsquo;t look very promising in the short term, right?</p>
<p>So the question is what compiles if you want to take the computer science metaphor, what</p>
<p>will get you into a journal?</p>
<p>Will you spend your life trying to push some paper into a journal or will it be accepted</p>
<p>easily?</p>
<p>What about the characteristics of the submitter and what gets taken up and what does not?</p>
<p>All of these fields are experiencing pressure because no field is performing so brilliantly</p>
<p>well, um, that it&rsquo;s revolutionizing our way of speaking and thinking in the ways in which</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve become accustomed.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think even in theoretical physics, a lot of times, even with theories like string</p>
<p>theory, you could speak to this, it does eventually lead to what are the ways that this theory</p>
<p>would be testable.</p>
<p>Yeah, ultimately, although look, there&rsquo;s this thing about popper and the scientific method</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a cancer and a disease and the minds of very smart people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really how most of the stuff gets worked out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how it gets checked.</p>
<p>All right, so, and there is a dialogue between theory and experiment, but everybody should</p>
<p>read Paul directs 1963 American scientific American article where he, he, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very interesting.</p>
<p>He talks about it as if it was about the Schrodinger equation and Schrodinger&rsquo;s failure to advance</p>
<p>his own work because of his failure to account for some phenomenon.</p>
<p>The key point is that if your theory is a slight bit off, it won&rsquo;t agree with experiment,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the theory is actually wrong.</p>
<p>Um, but direct could as easily have been talking about his own equation in which he predicted</p>
<p>that the electrons should have an antiparticle.</p>
<p>And since the only positively charged particle that was known at the time was the proton,</p>
<p>Heisenberg pointed out, well, shouldn&rsquo;t your antiparticle, the proton have the same mass</p>
<p>as the electron and doesn&rsquo;t that invalidate your theory?</p>
<p>So I think the direct was actually being quite potentially quite sneaky, um, and, uh, talking</p>
<p>about the fact that he had been pushed off of his own theory to some extent by Heisenberg.</p>
<p>Um, but look, we&rsquo;ve fetishized the scientific method and popper and falsification, um, because</p>
<p>it protects us from crazy ideas entering the field.</p>
<p>So you know, it&rsquo;s a question of balancing type one and type two error.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re pretty, we were pretty maxed out in one direction.</p>
<p>The opposite of that, let me say what comforts me sort of biology or engineering, uh, at</p>
<p>the end of the day, does the thing work?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can test the crazies away and the crazy.</p>
<p>Well see now you&rsquo;re saying, but some ideas are truly crazy and some are, are actually</p>
<p>correct.</p>
<p>So, well there&rsquo;s pre correct currently crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t want to get rid of everybody who&rsquo;s pre correct and currently crazy.</p>
<p>Um, the problem is, is that we don&rsquo;t have standards in general for trying to determine</p>
<p>who has to be put to the sword in terms of their career and who has to be protected,</p>
<p>uh, as some sort of giant time suck pain in the ass, uh, who may change everything.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>Uh, creating a mechanism of those select?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re not going to like the answer, but here it comes.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>It has to do with very human elements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to do this at the level of like rules and fairness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to work cause the only thing that really understands this, you read the</p>
<p>double helix?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a book.</p>
<p>Oh, you have to read this book.</p>
<p>Not only did Jim Watson, uh, half discover this three dimensional structure of DNA, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also one hell of a writer before he became an ass, uh, that no, he&rsquo;s tried to destroy</p>
<p>his own reputation.</p>
<p>I knew about the ass, I didn&rsquo;t know about the good writer.</p>
<p>Jim Watson is one of the most important people now living.</p>
<p>And uh, as I&rsquo;ve said before, Jim Watson is too important, a legacy to be left to Jim</p>
<p>Watson.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, that book tells you more about what actually moves the dial, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another story about him, which I don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t agree with, which is that he stole everything</p>
<p>from Rosalind Franklin.</p>
<p>I mean the, the problems that he had with Rosalind Franklin are real, but we should</p>
<p>actually honor that tension in our history by delving into it rather than having a simple</p>
<p>solution.</p>
<p>Jim Watson talks about Francis Crick being a pain in the ass that everybody secretly</p>
<p>knew was super brilliant.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an encounter between, uh, Chargaff, uh, who came up with the equimolar relations</p>
<p>between the nucleotides who should have gotten the structure of DNA and Watson and Crick.</p>
<p>And you know, he talks about missing a shiver in the heartbeat of biology and stuff is so</p>
<p>gorgeous.</p>
<p>It just makes you tremble even thinking about it.</p>
<p>Um, look, we know very often who is to be feared and we need to fund the people that</p>
<p>we fear.</p>
<p>The people who are wasting our time need to be excluded from the conversation.</p>
<p>You see, and you know, maybe we&rsquo;ll make some errors in both directions.</p>
<p>But we have known our own people.</p>
<p>We know the pains in the asses that might work out and we know the people who are really</p>
<p>just blowhards who really have very little to contribute most of the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a hundred percent, but you&rsquo;re not going to get there with rules.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a using some kind of instinct.</p>
<p>I mean, I, to be honest, I&rsquo;m going to make you roll your eyes for a second, but uh, and</p>
<p>the first time I heard that there is a large community of people who believe the earth</p>
<p>is flat actually made me pause and ask myself the question, why would there be such a community?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it possible the earth is flat?</p>
<p>So I had to like, wait a minute.</p>
<p>I mean, then you go through a thinking process that I think is really healthy.</p>
<p>It ultimately ends up being a geometry thing.</p>
<p>I think, uh, it&rsquo;s an interesting, it&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment at the very</p>
<p>least.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t, I do a different version of it.</p>
<p>I say, why is this community stable?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good, uh, way to analyze it.</p>
<p>Well, interesting that whatever we&rsquo;ve done has not erased the community.</p>
<p>So you know, they&rsquo;re taking a long shot bet that won&rsquo;t pan out, you know, maybe we just</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t thought enough about the rationality of the square root of two and somebody brilliant</p>
<p>will figure it out.</p>
<p>Maybe we will eventually land one day on the surface of Jupiter and explore it, right?</p>
<p>These are crazy things that will never happen.</p>
<p>So much of social media operates by AI algorithms.</p>
<p>You talked about this a little bit, uh, recommending the content you see.</p>
<p>So on this idea of radical thought, how much should AI show you things you disagree with</p>
<p>on Twitter and so on in a Twitter word verse in this question?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cause you don&rsquo;t know the answer?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Look, we&rsquo;ve been, they&rsquo;ve pushed out this cognitive Lego to us that will just lead to</p>
<p>madness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to be challenged with things that you disagree with.</p>
<p>The answer is no, it&rsquo;s good to be challenged with interesting things with which you currently</p>
<p>disagree, but that might be true.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really care about whether or not I disagree with something or don&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>I need to know why that particular disagreeable thing is being pushed out.</p>
<p>Is it because it&rsquo;s likely to be true?</p>
<p>Is it because, is there some reason?</p>
<p>Because I can write, I can write a computer generator, uh, to come up with an infinite</p>
<p>number of disagreeable statements that nobody needs to look at.</p>
<p>So please, before you push things at me that are disagreeable, tell me why.</p>
<p>There is an aspect in which that question is quite dumb, especially because it&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>used to, uh, almost, um, uh, very generically by these different networks to say, well,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to work this out.</p>
<p>But you know, basically, uh, how much do you see the value of seeing things, uh, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like, not you disagree with, because it&rsquo;s very difficult to know exactly what you articulated,</p>
<p>which is, uh, the stuff that&rsquo;s important for you to consider that you disagree with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really hard to figure out.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this stuff you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a, uh, uh, Hillary Clinton supporter, you may not want to, it might not make you</p>
<p>feel good to see anything about Donald Trump.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing algorithms can really optimize for currently.</p>
<p>They really can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now they can do better.</p>
<p>This is where we&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re engaged in some moronic back and forth where I have no idea why people who</p>
<p>are capable of building Google, Facebook, Twitter are having us in these incredibly</p>
<p>low level discussions.</p>
<p>Do they not know any smart people?</p>
<p>Do they not have the phone numbers of people who can elevate these discussions?</p>
<p>They do, but this, they&rsquo;re optimizing for a different thing and they&rsquo;re pushing those</p>
<p>people out of those rooms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re optimizing for things we can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>And yes, profit is there.</p>
<p>Nobody, nobody&rsquo;s questioning that, but they&rsquo;re also optimizing for things like political</p>
<p>control or the fact that they&rsquo;re doing business in Pakistan.</p>
<p>And so they don&rsquo;t want to talk about all the things that they&rsquo;re going to be bending to</p>
<p>in Pakistan.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re involved in a fake discussion.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>You think these conversations at that depth are happening inside Google?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think they have some basic metrics under user engagements?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having a fake conversation with us guys.</p>
<p>We know you&rsquo;re having a fake conversation.</p>
<p>I do not wish to be part of your fake conversation.</p>
<p>You know how to cool, you know, these units, you know, high availability, like nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>My Gmail never goes down.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>So you think just because they can do incredible work on the software side with infrastructure,</p>
<p>they can also deal with some of these difficult questions about human behavior, human understanding.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen the, I&rsquo;ve seen the developers screens that people take shots of inside of</p>
<p>Google.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard stories inside of Facebook and Apple.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not, we&rsquo;re engaged.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re engaging us in the wrong conversations.</p>
<p>We are not at this low level.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of my favorite questions.</p>
<p>Why is every piece of hardware that I purchase in tech space equipped as a listening device?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my physical shutter to cover my lens?</p>
<p>We had this in the 1970s, cameras that had lens caps, you know, how much would it cost</p>
<p>to have a security model pay five extra bucks?</p>
<p>Why is my indicator light software controlled?</p>
<p>Why when my camera is on, do I not see that the light is on by putting it as something</p>
<p>that cannot be bypassed?</p>
<p>Why have you set up my, all of my devices at some difficulty to yourselves as listening</p>
<p>devices and we don&rsquo;t even talk about this.</p>
<p>This is, this thing is total fucking bullshit.</p>
<p>Well, I hope these discussions are happening about privacy.</p>
<p>Is there a more difficult thing you&rsquo;re giving them credit for?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just privacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about social control.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about social control.</p>
<p>Why do I not have controls over my own levers?</p>
<p>Just have a really cute UI where I can switch, I can dial things or I can at least see what</p>
<p>the algorithms are.</p>
<p>You think that there is some deliberate choices being made here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s emergence and there is intention.</p>
<p>There are two dimensions.</p>
<p>The vector does not collapse onto either axis, but the idea that anybody who suggests that</p>
<p>intention is completely absent is a child.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really beautifully put and uh, like many things you&rsquo;ve said is going to make me</p>
<p>can I turn this around slightly?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I sit down with you and you say that you&rsquo;re obsessed with my feed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what my feed is.</p>
<p>What are you seeing that I&rsquo;m not?</p>
<p>I was obsessively looking through your feed on Twitter because it was really enjoyable</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s the Tom layer element is the humor in it.</p>
<p>By the way, that feed is Eric R. Weinstein on Twitter at Eric R. Weinstein.</p>
<p>No, but seriously, why?</p>
<p>Why did I find it enjoyable or what was I seeing?</p>
<p>What are you looking for?</p>
<p>Why are we doing this?</p>
<p>What is this podcast about?</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve got all these interesting people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just some guy who&rsquo;s sort of a podcast guest.</p>
<p>Sort of a podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even wearing a tie.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not even a serious interview.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m searching for meaning, for happiness, for a dopamine rush, so short term, long term.</p>
<p>And how are you finding your way to me?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t honestly know what I&rsquo;m doing to reach you.</p>
<p>The representing ideas which feel common sense to me and not many people are speaking.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like the intellectual dark web folks, right?</p>
<p>These folks from Sam Harris to Jordan Peterson to yourself are saying things where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like saying, look, there&rsquo;s an elephant and he&rsquo;s not wearing any clothes.</p>
<p>And I say, yeah, yeah, let&rsquo;s have more of that conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m finding you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m desperate to try to change the conversation we&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very worried we&rsquo;ve got an election in 2020.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can afford four more years of a misinterpreted message, which is what</p>
<p>Donald Trump was.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want the destruction of our institutions.</p>
<p>They all seem hell bent on destroying themselves.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to save theoretical physics, trying to save the New York Times, trying</p>
<p>to save our various processes.</p>
<p>And I think it feels delusional to me that this is falling to a tiny group of people</p>
<p>who are willing to speak out without getting so freaked out that everything they say will</p>
<p>be misinterpreted and that their lives will be ruined through the process.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re in an absolutely bananas period of time and I don&rsquo;t believe it should</p>
<p>fall to such a tiny number of shoulders to shoulder this way.</p>
<p>So I have to ask you on the capitalism side, you mentioned that technology is killing capitalism</p>
<p>or it has effects that are unintended, well, not unintended, but not what economists would</p>
<p>predict or speak of capitalism creating.</p>
<p>I just want to talk to you about in general, the effect of even then artificial intelligence</p>
<p>or technology automation taking away jobs and these kinds of things and what you think</p>
<p>is the way to alleviate that, whether the Andrew Ng presidential candidate with universal</p>
<p>basic income, UBI, what are your thoughts there?</p>
<p>How do we fight off the negative effects of technology that&hellip;</p>
<p>All right, you&rsquo;re a software guy, right?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>A human being is a worker is an old idea, a human being has a worker is a different</p>
<p>object, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you think about object oriented programming as a paradigm, a human being has a worker</p>
<p>and a human being has a soul.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the fact that for a period of time, the worker that a human being has</p>
<p>was in a position to feed the soul that a human being has.</p>
<p>However, we have two separate claims on the value in society.</p>
<p>One is as a worker and the other is as a soul and the soul needs sustenance, it needs dignity,</p>
<p>it needs meaning, it needs purpose.</p>
<p>As long as your means of support is not highly repetitive, I think you have a while to go</p>
<p>before you need to start worrying.</p>
<p>And if what you do is highly repetitive and it&rsquo;s not terribly generative, you are in the</p>
<p>cross hairs of for loops and while loops.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what computers excel at, repetitive behavior and when I say repetitive, I may</p>
<p>mean things that have never happened through combinatorial possibilities, but as long as</p>
<p>it has a looped characteristic to it, you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>We are seeing a massive push towards socialism because capitalists are slow to address the</p>
<p>fact that a worker may not be able to make claims, a relatively undistinguished median</p>
<p>member of our society is still has needs to reproduce, needs to have to dignity.</p>
<p>And when capitalism abandons the median individual or the bottom 10th or whatever it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to do, it&rsquo;s flirting with revolution.</p>
<p>And what concerns me is that the capitalists aren&rsquo;t sufficiently capitalistic to understand</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>You really want to court authoritarian control in our society because you can&rsquo;t see that</p>
<p>people may not be able to defend themselves in the marketplace because the marginal product</p>
<p>of their labor was too low to feed their dignity as a soul.</p>
<p>So my great concern is that our free society has to do with the fact that we are self organized.</p>
<p>I remember looking down from my office in Manhattan when Lehman brothers collapsed and</p>
<p>thinking who&rsquo;s going to tell all these people that they need to show up at work when they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a financial system to incentivize them to show up at work.</p>
<p>So my complaint is first of all, not with the socialists, but with the capitalists,</p>
<p>which is you guys are being idiots.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re courting revolution by continuing to harp on the same old ideas that, well, you</p>
<p>know, try, try harder, bootstrap yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, to an extent that works to an extent, but we are clearly headed in a place that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing that ties together our need to contribute and our need to consume.</p>
<p>And that may not be provided by capitalism because it may have been a temporary phenomena.</p>
<p>So check out my article on anthropic capitalism and the new gimmick economy.</p>
<p>I think people are late getting the wake up call and we would be doing a better job saving</p>
<p>capitalism from itself because I don&rsquo;t want this done under authoritarian control.</p>
<p>And the more we insist that everybody who&rsquo;s not thriving in our society during their reproductive</p>
<p>years in order to have a family is failing at a personal level.</p>
<p>I mean, what a disgusting thing that we&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>What horrible message who, who the hell have we become that we&rsquo;ve so bought into the Chicago</p>
<p>model that we can&rsquo;t see the humanity that we&rsquo;re destroying in that process.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I hate, I hate the thought of communism.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>My family has flirted with it decades past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wrong, bad idea, but we are going to need to figure out how to make sure that those</p>
<p>souls are nourished and respected and capitalism better have an answer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m betting on capitalism, but I&rsquo;ve got to tell you, I&rsquo;m pretty disappointed with</p>
<p>my team.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re still on the capitalism team.</p>
<p>You just, uh, there&rsquo;s a theme here.</p>
<p>Radical capitalism.</p>
<p>Hyper capitalism.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want, I think hyper capitalism is going to have to be coupled to hyper socialism.</p>
<p>You need to allow the most productive people to create wonders and you&rsquo;ve got to stop bogging</p>
<p>them down with all of these extra nice requirements.</p>
<p>You know, nice is dead.</p>
<p>Good has a future.</p>
<p>Nice doesn&rsquo;t have a future because nice ends up with, with gulags.</p>
<p>Damn, that&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Last question.</p>
<p>You tweeted today a simple, quite insightful equation saying, uh, imagine that every unit</p>
<p>F of fame you picked up as stalkers and H haters.</p>
<p>So I imagine S and H are dependent on your path to fame perhaps a little bit.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not as simple.</p>
<p>I mean, people always take these things literally when you have like 280 characters to explain</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>So you mean that that&rsquo;s not a mathematical, uh, no, there&rsquo;s no law.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So I put the word imagine because I still have a mathematician&rsquo;s desire for precision.</p>
<p>Imagine that this were true, but it was a beautiful way to imagine that there is a law</p>
<p>that has those variables in it.</p>
<p>And uh, you&rsquo;ve become quite famous these days.</p>
<p>So how do you yourself optimize that equation with the peculiar kind of fame that you have</p>
<p>gathered along the way?</p>
<p>I want to be kinder.</p>
<p>I want to be kinder to myself.</p>
<p>I want to be kinder to others.</p>
<p>I want to be able to have heart, compassion, or these things are really important.</p>
<p>And uh, I have a pretty spectrumy kind of approach to analysis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite literal.</p>
<p>I can go full rain man on you at any given moment.</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s facultative autism if you like, and people are gonna get angry because they want</p>
<p>autism to be respected.</p>
<p>So when you see me coding or you see me doing mathematics, I&rsquo;m, you know, I speak with speech</p>
<p>apnea, uh, be right down to dinner, you know, we have to try to integrate ourselves and</p>
<p>those tensions between, you know, it&rsquo;s sort of back to us as a worker and us as a soul.</p>
<p>Many of us are optimizing one to the, at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>And I struggle with social media and I struggle with people making threats against our families</p>
<p>and I struggle with, um, just how much pain people are in.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s one message I would like to push out there, um, you&rsquo;re responsible, everybody,</p>
<p>all of us, myself included with struggling, struggle, struggle mightily because you, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nobody else&rsquo;s job to do your struggle for you.</p>
<p>Now with that said, if you&rsquo;re struggling and you&rsquo;re trying and you&rsquo;re trying to figure</p>
<p>out how to better yourself and where you failed and where you&rsquo;ve let down your family, your</p>
<p>friends, your workers, all this kind of stuff, give yourself a break.</p>
<p>You know, if, if, if it&rsquo;s not working out, I have a lifelong relationship with failure</p>
<p>and success.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been no period of my life where both haven&rsquo;t been present in one form or another.</p>
<p>And I do wish to say that a lot of times people think this is glamorous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to go, you know, do a show with Sam Harris.</p>
<p>People are going to listen in on two guys having a conversation on stage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely crazy when I&rsquo;m always trying to figure out how to make sure that those</p>
<p>people get maximum value.</p>
<p>And uh, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing this podcast, you know, just give yourself a break.</p>
<p>You owe us, you owe us your struggle.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t owe your family or your coworkers or your lovers or your family members success.</p>
<p>Um, as long as you&rsquo;re in there and you&rsquo;re picking yourself up, recognize that this,</p>
<p>this new situation with the economy that doesn&rsquo;t have the juice to sustain our institutions</p>
<p>has caused the people who&rsquo;ve risen to the top of those institutions to get quite brutal</p>
<p>and cruel.</p>
<p>Everybody is lying at the moment.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s really a truth teller.</p>
<p>Um, try to keep your humanity about you.</p>
<p>Try to recognize that if you&rsquo;re failing, if things aren&rsquo;t where you want them to be and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re struggling and you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what you&rsquo;re doing wrong, which you could</p>
<p>do, it&rsquo;s not necessarily all your fault.</p>
<p>We are in a global situation.</p>
<p>I have not met the people who are honest, kind, good, successful.</p>
<p>Nobody that I&rsquo;ve met is checking all the boxes.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s getting all tens.</p>
<p>So I just think that&rsquo;s an important message that doesn&rsquo;t get pushed out enough.</p>
<p>Either people want to hold society responsible for their failures, which is not reasonable.</p>
<p>You have to struggle, you have to try, or they want to say you&rsquo;re a hundred percent</p>
<p>responsible for your failures, which is total nonsense.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>Eric, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me, buddy.</p>
