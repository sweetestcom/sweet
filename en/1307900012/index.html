    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History Addendum.</p>
<p>We told you when we first unveiled the Hardcore History Addendum feed that this was going</p>
<p>to be the everything else feed.</p>
<p>Anything that didn&rsquo;t belong in the main Hardcore History feed for one reason or another will</p>
<p>end up here.</p>
<p>We knew there would be interview shows because compared to what we normally do, the big Hardcore</p>
<p>History shows, interview shows are simple, so we knew that there&rsquo;d be quite a few of</p>
<p>those and that we would try to switch them up and do them differently like the one we</p>
<p>did recently where I was the one who got interviewed.</p>
<p>And then we knew there&rsquo;d be some funky kind of shows that probably would upset some people</p>
<p>on the main feed but that some people would really like, like our Caesar at Hastings show</p>
<p>which we put on this feed.</p>
<p>And then sometimes it&rsquo;s what probably could easily pass for a Hardcore History show but</p>
<p>for one reason or another it&rsquo;s not the right time or place.</p>
<p>We have the one that we did on Alexander the Great&rsquo;s mother that had we put it out</p>
<p>on the main feed, it would have interrupted an ongoing series, so we put it out on this</p>
<p>feed.</p>
<p>So I hope that over time when you look at the archives of the Hardcore History Addendum</p>
<p>show offerings, you know, en masse, you will have an eclectic grab bag of potential offerings,</p>
<p>you know, that looks pretty varied.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hate to fall into any ruts.</p>
<p>Case in point, today&rsquo;s offering.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new movie out that touches my heart in all the right places, as you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about Second World War naval history, so it&rsquo;s right up my alley.</p>
<p>Has to do with a commander of one of these escort ships guarding merchant men across</p>
<p>the Atlantic during the Battle of the Atlantic and trying to keep the U-boats off of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Greyhound, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on Apple TV+, stars Tom Hanks, who&rsquo;s done a lot of World War II history movies</p>
<p>or who&rsquo;s been involved in producing them or executive producing them.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a history fan, I think.</p>
<p>And by the way, I think he even did the screenplay of the movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll like it.</p>
<p>You should check it out.</p>
<p>And in an unusual move, I think, that I hope will be part of that eclectic grab bag of</p>
<p>offerings when you look at our archives over time, you&rsquo;ll notice, hey, they did a Hardcore</p>
<p>History Addendum with Tom Hanks.</p>
<p>And we did.</p>
<p>And here it is.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know who Tom Hanks is, well, I don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;ve been hiding, but</p>
<p>maybe Google that.</p>
<p>In any case, ladies and gentlemen, Tom Hanks.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanks, can you hear me OK?</p>
<p>This is Dan.</p>
<p>I can indeed, Dan.</p>
<p>You can call me Tom.</p>
<p>And it is a thrill to hear your voice on something other than one of the many podcasts.</p>
<p>You, sir, are as big as Bruce Springsteen in our house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to react to that as a man who&rsquo;s been watching since Bosom Buddy</p>
<p>did days.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the we were just we just drove from Los Angeles, myself and two of my kids.</p>
<p>We drove from Los Angeles to Twin Falls, Idaho.</p>
<p>During which we listened to the entirety of Ghosts of the Oast Front, which was just one</p>
<p>of. Oh, my Lord, I&rsquo;ve learned so much from you and have been in your enthralled by you</p>
<p>for many an hour.</p>
<p>So thank you for your passion and thank you for your output.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pleasure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be speaking to you now.</p>
<p>You know, as a guy who remembers pulling out my hair at like twenty five going, what the</p>
<p>hell are you doing with your career at this point?</p>
<p>To hear you say that is wonderful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, you know, because I was doing my research.</p>
<p>Let me start with this.</p>
<p>As a guy who would have thought of you as the great comic genius coming up during the</p>
<p>era when I was growing up, if you had told me back in 1980 that you were going to be</p>
<p>one of the great dramatic actors of our time and that you were going to have an IMDB page</p>
<p>that looked like you were an overachiever with some sort of some sort of inefficiency</p>
<p>attitude. I mean, I look at what you&rsquo;ve been doing and you don&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;ve lived</p>
<p>long enough to do all those things.</p>
<p>I want to ask you someday what the hell an executive producer does, because you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been an executive.</p>
<p>You tell me I can answer that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>OK, there is a there&rsquo;s a big there&rsquo;s a distinct difference between being an executive</p>
<p>producer on a motion picture, which is literally a powerless title that doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>require your presence to be an executive producer on a television series in which you</p>
<p>get to impact the the final product as much as you wish to.</p>
<p>You can get involved in the writing.</p>
<p>You can get involved in the casting and the shooting, get involved in the editing.</p>
<p>You actually can run as long as you&rsquo;re the executive producer of a TV, TV, anything on</p>
<p>television, TV, miniseries, series.</p>
<p>You get to run the quality assurance of that of that show.</p>
<p>You are you are literally what you are probably the you get to be the big boss man if</p>
<p>you decide to do so, meaning that, you know, you can if you think something is running</p>
<p>off the rails, you go in and put it back on.</p>
<p>Or if it&rsquo;s something running incredibly smoothly, you just call up and tell everybody</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing a slam bang job and keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>So two very different things.</p>
<p>So the things that I have been executive producer on on television, particularly the</p>
<p>miniseries, I&rsquo;ve had I&rsquo;ve had I&rsquo;ve had a hand in the way I put it is assuring we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>literally running the quality assurance on on motion pictures.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean. Well, let&rsquo;s talk about your choices then, because, like I said, as a</p>
<p>guy who thought you were going to be this great comic leader of a movement, basically</p>
<p>in our time period, I thought I thought I thought it was a brand new kind of comedy to</p>
<p>watch you choose the kind of topics that I would choose for a history show.</p>
<p>You know, we made this show originally with history fans in mind.</p>
<p>I feel like a history fan can can recognize one of his own.</p>
<p>You are a true fan of history, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I mean, in your own private time, in your own choice of of reading materials.</p>
<p>Tell me a little about what Tom reads at home.</p>
<p>I read history for pleasure.</p>
<p>Now, that being said, I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not a scholarly reader.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t read tomes.</p>
<p>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to make it too deep into the rise and fall of the Third Reich just</p>
<p>because the numbers and the math start driving me nuts.</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t think I need to invest in the wheat productions from Saxony during the</p>
<p>Weimar Republic. It ends up it ends up kind of like burying me.</p>
<p>When I started reading history, I ended up reading historical novels like Mila 18 or</p>
<p>Armageddon, things by Leon Uris that were, you know, turgid melodrama in a lot of</p>
<p>ways, but also ripped right out of the history books.</p>
<p>And so I ended up finding finding out and being enthralled by eras and moments and</p>
<p>periods of history. I now I read a lot of Don Miller&rsquo;s work, the building of the</p>
<p>Supreme City, for example, which is about architecture in New York.</p>
<p>I have read an awful lot of an awful lot of World War Two stuff.</p>
<p>I read an awful lot about communism.</p>
<p>I read an awful lot about East Germany.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m currently let me tell you this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve currently picked up finally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a copy of it for a long time.</p>
<p>But Howard Zinn&rsquo;s A People&rsquo;s History of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Because as a guy who has been reading history for pleasure and enlightenment and</p>
<p>entertainment, I&rsquo;m 64, I&rsquo;ve been doing I&rsquo;ve been reading and like that really since I</p>
<p>was like 13, 14 years old, when I started reading for pleasure, I was reading history.</p>
<p>I was not aware, Dan, of the Tulsa Black Wall Street destruction in 1921.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, OK. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I had never been taught that in American history.</p>
<p>I had never heard about it.</p>
<p>I literally learned of it just last May in an article in The New York Times.</p>
<p>And I thought, this is a huge gap.</p>
<p>This is a this is a massive whiff, a miss of something that would have altered my</p>
<p>consciousness. Let me go back just a little bit farther.</p>
<p>When we when we took on doing.</p>
<p>David McCullough&rsquo;s John Adams.</p>
<p>Yes. For HBO.</p>
<p>Graham Yost, who I&rsquo;d worked with on two previous miniseries, he called up and said,</p>
<p>look, I can&rsquo;t do this, but you might want to take a look at this, because I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a miniseries in this thing.</p>
<p>And really, John Adams with what the Tea Party and the Three Corner Hats and the</p>
<p>buckles on their shoes.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t we seen this stuff before?</p>
<p>He said, just read it, just read it, just read it, just read it.</p>
<p>So, OK. So I read it when I got up to the to the place where as as an attorney in the</p>
<p>Commonwealth of Massachusetts, John Adams took on the case of defending the British</p>
<p>soldiers that fired on the mob that became known as the Boston Massacre.</p>
<p>And nobody wanted that gig, by the way.</p>
<p>Nobody wanted the gig.</p>
<p>Nobody wanted to take it.</p>
<p>It was unpopular and everybody hated the lobster backs.</p>
<p>I love that term.</p>
<p>Right. John Adams said, if we let the mob rule.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doomed. That is not the that that that is the very rule of law is based on</p>
<p>certain respects.</p>
<p>For each other, among other for authority, but it is the opposite of letting a mob</p>
<p>decide what goes on.</p>
<p>So he takes on that case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say there&rsquo;s a dozen British soldiers who just want to excuse me, just</p>
<p>want to go. They just they just want to go home.</p>
<p>This cold, miserable country where everybody hates them.</p>
<p>Can we please can we please go home?</p>
<p>Not only does John Adams defend them, but he he wins their acquittal by way of the rule</p>
<p>of law. If I had been told somewhere, I think the first time I American history was a</p>
<p>subject that we had to take a requirement.</p>
<p>I believe I was 10 in fifth grade and then again in eighth grade at any other time in</p>
<p>the course between between then and now, if I had been told the future second</p>
<p>president of the United States, the future first president of the United States, one</p>
<p>of the authors of the Declaration of Independence had defended British soldiers</p>
<p>for firing upon a mob for being responsible for the Boston massacre and proved there</p>
<p>proved the circumstances that led to their acquittal and being sent home.</p>
<p>My head would have exploded.</p>
<p>It would have been it would have been it would have been an example.</p>
<p>Exaggeration of the very the very reason why certain things are written down on</p>
<p>parchment and accepted as these truths that we hold to be self-evident, the the</p>
<p>workings of we the people in order to make a more perfect union.</p>
<p>It would have it would have influenced me in a huge way.</p>
<p>And perhaps I would have been pissed off.</p>
<p>Hey, wait a minute.</p>
<p>British are the bad guys, right?</p>
<p>How can we how can we get why would we celebrate them getting up?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a rule of law.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Take two to talk about this take to the representative of the United States of</p>
<p>America, first ambassador to the court of St.</p>
<p>James, a place where if things had been different, he would have been brought in</p>
<p>chains and hung by the king of England.</p>
<p>He now has to John Adams, future vice president of the United States, co-author</p>
<p>of the Declaration of Independence, father of another U.S.</p>
<p>president, father of another U.S.</p>
<p>president, both of them one termers.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>He now because because we are no longer an English colony and protected not only</p>
<p>by the crown, but also by the crown&rsquo;s empirical navy, the big empire of the</p>
<p>Navy. America now has to go and they essentially negotiate all the deals that</p>
<p>were already made by England because they&rsquo;re their own country.</p>
<p>So one of the things he has to do is go talk to the Barbary pirates who have</p>
<p>enslaved American sailors that they take on the ship in North Africa.</p>
<p>Yes. In North Africa.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where they did. They kidnapped a bunch of people.</p>
<p>They got tribute. And that&rsquo;s how they make money.</p>
<p>They built in hostages.</p>
<p>They had built in kidnapping.</p>
<p>And the John Adams goes and speaks to the emir of the of Moorish North Africa.</p>
<p>And it says and he says, look, we are a poor country, your graciousness, we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>afford to keep buying our sailors out of your your kidnapping bondage.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have to we got to work something out here.</p>
<p>And the emir says, there&rsquo;s nothing to work out here, you pay us the money.</p>
<p>And John Adams says, as I said, once again, we cannot afford it.</p>
<p>And secondly, we do not want to get into a fight with you.</p>
<p>And the emir of the Barbary pirates says, oh, listen, dude, you do not want to get</p>
<p>into a fight with us because we don&rsquo;t play by your rules.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t take prisoners.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t negotiate.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t surrender.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t sign a piece of paper that says we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop the fighting.</p>
<p>You win. We we don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just keep killing you and terrorizing you till the cows come home.</p>
<p>And the end result, of course, is from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of</p>
<p>Tripoli, they they did have to mix it up.</p>
<p>Those two lessons alone, by the way, you know what they were you know what they</p>
<p>were enjoying at the time of that conversation between the ambassador of the</p>
<p>United States and the emir of Tunisia, the more I don&rsquo;t know what they were</p>
<p>having a nice cup of coffee.</p>
<p>They were enjoying they were enjoying to find tobacco products from the state of</p>
<p>Virginia. They were enjoying the bounty of the new world right there between the</p>
<p>two of them over that brand of branded diplomacy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the you know, you read that kind of stuff and everything comes alive</p>
<p>and it has absolutely nothing to do with the the bushels of wheat that was pulled</p>
<p>out of Saxony during the Weimar Republic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got some other stuff that&rsquo;s attached.</p>
<p>No, but I think what you&rsquo;re saying is and don&rsquo;t let me put words in your mouth, but</p>
<p>I think it applies to all of us who are fans of history is that, you know, you grow</p>
<p>up with a two dimensional version of history, especially with our heroes.</p>
<p>We shrink them into into cardboard cutouts.</p>
<p>We we we we we sand off all the rough edges and all the unpalatable stuff and turn</p>
<p>them into symbols. And then when you are able, like adding water to restore them</p>
<p>again to their three dimensional human qualities, they become so much more</p>
<p>relatable and interesting.</p>
<p>And the fact that and, you know, this is the most obvious part that&rsquo;s still the part</p>
<p>that you have to remember, the fact that they don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to turn out.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. You know, and for us, it&rsquo;s such a safe thing.</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;s a happy ending.</p>
<p>We know he becomes John Adams at the end of this story.</p>
<p>Story would have ended differently had he been taken prisoner, you know, and and</p>
<p>beheaded by the by the head of the Barbary Pirates.</p>
<p>I mean, and he doesn&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>So for me, I think, you know, it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a great line.</p>
<p>I wrote it down. And every time I quote anything on the program, I have to be careful</p>
<p>because someone will say something like that&rsquo;s actually not a real quote.</p>
<p>So I had to. But I wrote it down and it&rsquo;s a Latin line from from ancient times.</p>
<p>It says it will give you pleasure to look back on this scene of suffering.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a reminder to me that it would be very interesting to go back and talk to</p>
<p>somebody, say, from the Second World War, say a refugee and go to them and say,</p>
<p>listen, you have no idea how many tickets we&rsquo;re going to be able to sell to the</p>
<p>movie about the experiences you&rsquo;re going through right now.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s almost an obscene aspect to that.</p>
<p>Right. We&rsquo;re going to be entertained by the most traumatic, terrible thing you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever gone through. And the only thing that makes me feel like we can get away with</p>
<p>it is that those people themselves were fascinated by stories from earlier times</p>
<p>that were based of the same sorts of components, you know, human beings dealing</p>
<p>with struggle and overcoming the many things that were thrown that way, not knowing</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s going to turn out.</p>
<p>And it is exactly rooted in today&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>History shows us the human condition as as we can observe it right now across the</p>
<p>street. The great novelist Alan First, who I&rsquo;ve read, he writes essentially World</p>
<p>War Two era espionage books.</p>
<p>Fascinating, great stuff.</p>
<p>Novels, OK, but set firmly rooted in real places, real dates, real times, real</p>
<p>upheaval. All of his books, I&rsquo;m saying all I&rsquo;m I may not be 100 percent, but the</p>
<p>ones that I&rsquo;ve read are all set prior to the Battle of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Why? I heard him say this on the radio and it made me jump up and down in my car,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t recommend. But he said, why are all your why are all your books set</p>
<p>before the Battle of Stalingrad?</p>
<p>And he said. Until the Nazis gave up the ghost in Stalingrad, and this is why your</p>
<p>your ghosts of the Ost front really kicked my butt in all the one hundred and</p>
<p>fourteen hours of you talking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the shorter series, too, unfortunately, until the Nazis began their</p>
<p>retreat and were captured there at Stalingrad.</p>
<p>No one had any idea that they were beatable.</p>
<p>They had they had taken over their half of the world with relative ease and with</p>
<p>constant terror.</p>
<p>So. You tell me, Stalingrad, they they retreated from Stalingrad in nineteen</p>
<p>forty two, forty three, I think, by the end of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but forty two is when the battle happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely right.</p>
<p>OK, so not until nineteen forty three.</p>
<p>So from September of nineteen thirty nine and actually prior to that, until that</p>
<p>moment, the Nazi war machine was invincible.</p>
<p>So until until you get a sense of, hey, wait a minute, they&rsquo;ve lost there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at the I&rsquo;m looking at the map and I&rsquo;m looking the way things are</p>
<p>going. Holy cow.</p>
<p>They could actually lose this.</p>
<p>They they are defeatable.</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re losing ground like crazy.</p>
<p>You know what? It might only be a matter of time until Nazi Germany is wiped off</p>
<p>the map, destroyed.</p>
<p>Wow. There&rsquo;s actually hope.</p>
<p>Until that moment came, a human being, particularly in that sphere of the world,</p>
<p>had three options of how to conduct their lives.</p>
<p>They could either be a hero.</p>
<p>They could be a villain or they could be a coward, a bystander.</p>
<p>And I always whenever I&rsquo;m in the midst of any of these sagas in any of the midst of</p>
<p>these journeys of history and enlightenment, I always ask myself, gee, what</p>
<p>would I be? Hero, villain, coward.</p>
<p>Wow, I&rsquo;m not so sure of.</p>
<p>Look, I have hubris, but I&rsquo;m not so sure of at the end of the push comes the</p>
<p>shove. Am I going to say, hey, look, these are the rules now, guys.</p>
<p>They took over. We got to, you know, do we become a member of the Vichy French or</p>
<p>we do one of the we become one of those kids that suddenly wakes up one day, the</p>
<p>French Republic is collapsed and you have either an option to stay or run down to</p>
<p>the beach, get in a rowboat and and cross the English Channel and keep the fight</p>
<p>going on. We all face moments like that every single day of our lives.</p>
<p>We have some, you know, maybe taken to a ridiculous extreme or maybe not to an</p>
<p>extreme at all of that choice between what our actions are going to going to be</p>
<p>and what how we&rsquo;re going to view it in years to come.</p>
<p>You know, someday we&rsquo;ll be all laugh about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not. It could be that someday we never talk about any of this because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want the secrets to come out.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s too painful a memory.</p>
<p>You know, I used to say that when I talk to veterans, you can almost tell how much</p>
<p>combat and action they saw by how unwilling they are to get into it with you.</p>
<p>I wonder how much our fascination with these sorts of incidences would be</p>
<p>different had we actually experienced the incidences themselves.</p>
<p>I mean, if Tom Hanks had actually fought in the Second World War, as you have in</p>
<p>more than one film, how different then is Tom Hanks&rsquo;s portrait?</p>
<p>In other words, how much is Tom Hanks exploring a subject that he&rsquo;s interested</p>
<p>in? Because there is no answer, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how Tom behaves in the Second World War versus.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, I was trying to think, you know, ahead of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny not to change the subject at all, but I was going trying to do my</p>
<p>research for this program.</p>
<p>And I went and saw interviews with you that you&rsquo;d done in the past where you</p>
<p>talked about the celebrity mule train and all the and all the questions you</p>
<p>normally get asked. And so I wrote them all down and thought it would be funny to</p>
<p>just go through every one of those questions.</p>
<p>So actually, it just it but it&rsquo;s funny because how many of them get into this</p>
<p>thing about what&rsquo;s so interesting about this topic that you continue?</p>
<p>Because people ask me, my wife says to me all the time, you can&rsquo;t even I have to</p>
<p>walk out of the there was the Jeffrey Epstein series was on the other day on</p>
<p>Netflix or whatever. And she&rsquo;s watching and I have to walk out of the room every</p>
<p>two seconds because I can&rsquo;t handle what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And she says, how is a guy who talks about war all day long?</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t stay in the room during this.</p>
<p>And I said, I don&rsquo;t know what the difference is, but I think it has something to</p>
<p>do with unanswered questions about how we would be maybe in those situations.</p>
<p>You used to read about the veterans who always wondered about, OK, how will I</p>
<p>behave? Will I be a coward when the bullets first start out?</p>
<p>How how will that crucible in my life be when I hit the beach?</p>
<p>Had Tom Hanks been in these situations for real, as many of the Second World War</p>
<p>era actors were who then came back and had to portray the Sands of Iwo Jima or</p>
<p>whatever? How much do you think your portrayal would be different and how much</p>
<p>would you be still interested in exploring these questions?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s an unknowable question?</p>
<p>But, you know, there&rsquo;s a I&rsquo;ll tell you a story that that which I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>because, again, it&rsquo;s a combination of hubris and desire.</p>
<p>You know, I would like to I would like to seduce everybody by saying, oh, I know</p>
<p>exactly what I had no idea.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s a here&rsquo;s a great story.</p>
<p>And I some of it is apocryphal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say, but this is a fact.</p>
<p>My friend Ron Howard was was in a movie.</p>
<p>But Lee Marvin and there was gunplay involved.</p>
<p>Lee Marvin was a great guy.</p>
<p>He was he was hilarious.</p>
<p>He was a gregarious. He got the drill.</p>
<p>He knew that it was, you know, part leaning into the truth and part a racket.</p>
<p>You know, the movie is the movie biz.</p>
<p>But he was a great guy until the night gunfire scene came.</p>
<p>And he was not the same man, perhaps because he had been drinking, but he was</p>
<p>not the same man when it came down to shooting this stuff, the gunfight, the</p>
<p>muzzle flashes, the bang.</p>
<p>I got you because he says, oh, you&rsquo;re all pretending here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all pretending with your little guns.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s one story that I know for I heard that from the horse&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a story that I&rsquo;ve heard in in happenstance.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just going to assume that it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>All right, Lee Marvin is on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. And, you know, he&rsquo;s funny and he&rsquo;s Lee Marvin and he&rsquo;s intimidating and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all that and he&rsquo;s been in the Dirty Dozen and he&rsquo;s been in all these big red one,</p>
<p>all of those. He&rsquo;s Lee goddamn Marvin.</p>
<p>All right. So Johnny mentioned something about being a hero.</p>
<p>You know, somehow the word hero is mentioned.</p>
<p>Johnny Carson says, well, you&rsquo;re a hero.</p>
<p>Lee, you&rsquo;re a war hero.</p>
<p>You served in the Marines.</p>
<p>And he says, I&rsquo;m not a I&rsquo;m not a war hero, Johnny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guy who got shot in the ass.</p>
<p>But I will tell you who is a war hero.</p>
<p>I believe it was Iwo Jima, forgive me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but just say it&rsquo;s Iwo Jima</p>
<p>because it can stand in for Peleliu, Guadalcanal, Okinawa.</p>
<p>Pinion, Kwajalein, it could stand in for all of those island battles in World War</p>
<p>Two. But he was a Marine and he did get wounded.</p>
<p>He did get shot. He got a purple heart, et cetera, in combat.</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;ll tell you who&rsquo;s a hero.</p>
<p>The beach master at Iwo Jima was a hero.</p>
<p>That was a man who was unarmed and his job was to stand up on the beach under fire</p>
<p>from the from the defending Japanese forces, waving red flags in order to guide the</p>
<p>landing craft in to their appropriate landing sites.</p>
<p>So that the invasion could continue, disgorging their attacking Marines and then his</p>
<p>job as the beach master was to communicate with signal flags, with semaphores to the</p>
<p>pilots of these small boats all under fire.</p>
<p>He said, now, that man was a hero and that man&rsquo;s name was Sergeant Bob Keisham.</p>
<p>Do you know who Bob Keisham is?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t he the Captain Kangaroo or something?</p>
<p>He was Captain Kangaroo.</p>
<p>He was Clarabelle the Clown on Howdy Doody.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some therapy working itself out after the war right there, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Well, it is it is some aspect of that generation who says, hey, first of all, we all</p>
<p>signed up for for the duration plus six months.</p>
<p>There were a bajillion of us.</p>
<p>Secondly, all of us saw if you were in combat, you all went through something.</p>
<p>You all saw something, etc.</p>
<p>And thirdly, there&rsquo;s that great there&rsquo;s that great line from the best years of our</p>
<p>lives when Dana Andrews has been pulled down out of the derelict B-17 that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>demolished and turned into material for model homes.</p>
<p>And the guy says, hey, you get down from there.</p>
<p>And Dana Andrews comes out just reliving it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Well, when you fly boys are up there doing it, I was down on the ground in</p>
<p>the tanks. Dana Andrews said, hey, listen, brother, I&rsquo;d love to hear your war stories</p>
<p>if I have if I ever have the time.</p>
<p>They all had war stories.</p>
<p>And theirs were no different than others.</p>
<p>And those guys that did indeed, you know, faced it, you know, I don&rsquo;t want to mention</p>
<p>the names, but I know I know of actors, veteran actors who passed away, who killed the</p>
<p>enemy with their bare hands.</p>
<p>In foxholes.</p>
<p>Because they had to keep moving, how do you go through that and then come back and</p>
<p>either tell about it or laugh about it or view it as some sort of anecdote?</p>
<p>That is that is from the past, it&rsquo;s just or an entertainment vehicle, right?</p>
<p>A crowd pleaser, an audience applause, a prompter.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s one of the things and I was having a hard time coming up with specific</p>
<p>questions about your wonderful film Greyhound, because I didn&rsquo;t want to give away any</p>
<p>spoilers and everything I was going to ask about sort of led to a spoiler.</p>
<p>I do want to say, though, one of the things that really grabbed a hold of me and that I</p>
<p>got right away was because and you just alluded to it was that, you know, we celebrate</p>
<p>and always have the guys who hit the beaches at Iwo Jima and everything.</p>
<p>But but, you know, always in war, they talk about the snake, right?</p>
<p>The head of the snake or the combat troops, the tail of the snake or all the people that</p>
<p>it takes to keep the combat troops, you know, with bullets and food and all the things</p>
<p>that they need to do their jobs.</p>
<p>And the more modern the warfare, the longer the tail of the snake gets.</p>
<p>The number of people that it took to get the Second World War soldiers to where they</p>
<p>could fight and be the head of the snake, you&rsquo;re playing the role of one of these people</p>
<p>that essentially is, for lack of a better word, one of the many millions and millions of</p>
<p>functionaries who kept the I mean, the book that the movie is based on, the novel is</p>
<p>called The Good Shepherd.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the destroyer escorts are for these convoys.</p>
<p>They are shepherds.</p>
<p>They are people who who who guard the logistical supply train, and they&rsquo;re not the</p>
<p>people you normally think of as hitting the beach at Iwo Jima.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different kind of heroism, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It is. It&rsquo;s delivering the mail through.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Through through a maelstrom that that could take your life, that you make the wrong</p>
<p>turn, you make the wrong decision, you make the wrong assumption if you&rsquo;re if you if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so foolish as to live by assumptions.</p>
<p>Guess what? You have made the critical mistake of your life in that.</p>
<p>Now, our movie is set in nineteen forty two.</p>
<p>There is there is a couple of major buys in it, one of them being that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a ocean liner that&rsquo;s been converted and there&rsquo;s five thousand, you</p>
<p>know, fresh troops to it.</p>
<p>And this is all historical.</p>
<p>That happened a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it did.</p>
<p>And at any given moment, there would be 40 convoys crossing the North Atlantic, not</p>
<p>just one, not just two.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have all their eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>They were all different sizes made up of ships from all the Allied navies, the Poles,</p>
<p>the Norwegians, the Canadians, anybody who had a ship that you could load up with</p>
<p>anything from bayonets to raw iron ingots, coal, cans of tinned beef, screwdrivers,</p>
<p>socks, anything that was desperately needed, not just by the the populace of Great</p>
<p>Britain, but by the soldiers that were going to someday take on take on the Nazi</p>
<p>hordes themselves, was delivered there by these ships, slow, rust, buckety ships.</p>
<p>I think I think your top speed, you could only go as fast as the slowest ship in your</p>
<p>convoy. Captain Krauss and Greyhound are protecting thirty seven ships in a convoy.</p>
<p>The slowest of them can probably only manage about 14 knots, so that&rsquo;s the speed</p>
<p>which which they are crossing the North Atlantic, heavy seas, wintertime, nighttime,</p>
<p>twenty four hours a day, zigzagging in order to hopefully either to not be not be</p>
<p>found out or to evade the Nazi submarines, of which there are dozens and dozens and</p>
<p>dozens out there looking looking for targets in order to sink every time they sink</p>
<p>any ship. It&rsquo;s a plus for them to sink a ship with with troops.</p>
<p>Great. Sink a ship with a jeep.</p>
<p>Great. Sink a ship with tires or barrels of castor oil, whatever.</p>
<p>Great. That&rsquo;s a that that&rsquo;s a win.</p>
<p>So the guys who are in charge of that are over on board, the cook on board that one of</p>
<p>those ships, the guy who does the laundry.</p>
<p>The African-American messmates who, because of segregation, are relegated to those</p>
<p>duties, except when General Quarters are sounded and then they run off and man their</p>
<p>posts. All those all those guys are literally floating potential casualties that</p>
<p>could disappear in the wink of an eye, drown, be blown up, never be seen ever again.</p>
<p>And what have they been doing for how did they serve in the war, daddy?</p>
<p>Well, I made sure that there was enough potatoes served to our crew if the seas</p>
<p>allowed us to boil them in hot water, which often was not the case.</p>
<p>That that look, I&rsquo;m never I usually when I get something from the marketing</p>
<p>department, they say, oh, here&rsquo;s the tag line for for your movie.</p>
<p>I kind of go, OK, all right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a little hyperbole in there, guys.</p>
<p>I think you I think you&rsquo;re ratcheting it up a little.</p>
<p>But in this case, you know, it is it was let&rsquo;s not you can argue more dangerous than</p>
<p>the front. Let&rsquo;s just say as dangerous as your your your the odds of you dying at sea,</p>
<p>just being a guy on a boat whose job it is to protect a bunch of other slow moving boats</p>
<p>was the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhere somewhere between wildly out of your favor and possibly in your</p>
<p>favor. You&rsquo;re not a combat soldier until you are in that situation.</p>
<p>Right. So so let me talk a little bit about the screenplay, because you wrote that.</p>
<p>And and let me say as a guy who who my dad used to say he could he could always know</p>
<p>how the movie was going to go because he could tell how it was cut.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always there&rsquo;s always a mad lib quality to these kind of films where you</p>
<p>could almost write a template for how they&rsquo;re going to go.</p>
<p>And yours wasn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>You caught me off guard several times.</p>
<p>One thing when I was trying to learn how to write columns once upon a time, they used</p>
<p>to talk about how you should take out every word that you didn&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>And by the end, you had this very tight sort of thing that says everything you want to</p>
<p>say doesn&rsquo;t diminish the story at all, but is is as few words as possible.</p>
<p>I thought this was an amazingly snappy script.</p>
<p>I remember when it ended, I turned around, said I couldn&rsquo;t believe that we&rsquo;d already</p>
<p>gone through. It didn&rsquo;t drag for a second.</p>
<p>And if this was a wine and you were talking about the notes of chocolate and a little</p>
<p>bit of oak, I mean, this was this had overtones of sink the Bismarck to me.</p>
<p>And some, you know, run silent, run deep, but also some of some jaws mixed with some</p>
<p>of this idea of I mean, you were able and this is what I thought was so snappy.</p>
<p>You were able to take me into these.</p>
<p>And we love doing this on this history show, too, where we&rsquo;ll talk about the moral</p>
<p>quandaries and and and awful choices that people are put into because they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>sort of trapped in the gears of history.</p>
<p>Normally, there takes a lot of setup to really get to that moment.</p>
<p>And you put me in that moment three or four times in this film.</p>
<p>And I found myself in it without any setup at all.</p>
<p>I mean, the genius of being able to write it.</p>
<p>So I was in this moral quandary and all you had to give me was look in the distance.</p>
<p>Your character sees something in the distance.</p>
<p>We look into your eyes.</p>
<p>It would have taken me 15 minutes of conversation and thousands of words to set up</p>
<p>that same scene.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy the screenplay parts?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m getting tired of all of your talent.</p>
<p>Actors, screenplay, executive, I mean, it was you took this from a novel, right?</p>
<p>Not to steal one of your four questions from the celebrity mule train list, but tell me</p>
<p>a little about coming up with this and deciding you wanted to write the screenplay.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a novel, right?</p>
<p>A C.S. Forrester piece.</p>
<p>Yes, I purchased I purchased the novel from a bookstore that has since gone out of</p>
<p>business on Madison Avenue in New York City because it was it was a used bookstore and</p>
<p>not a used bookstore, but it had collectibles, you know, in the front window.</p>
<p>And I saw this thing, C.S.</p>
<p>Forrester, I was aware of from Horatio Horn.</p>
<p>Right. Okay.</p>
<p>Which I never read any Horatio Horn.</p>
<p>Was it? Oh, that&rsquo;s a guy who wrote Horatio Horn.</p>
<p>And it was the original cover and it was a painting, a drawing of this very old</p>
<p>gray haired guy on the railing of a ship with his tie askew, the wind blowing in his</p>
<p>face, his jacket undone.</p>
<p>He just looks bent.</p>
<p>Beaten on the horizon behind him, a ship is tilting up, smoking and sinking beside him</p>
<p>was some formless figure in a helmet that is sending out a signal on a on a signal lamp.</p>
<p>And I I said, who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that guy?</p>
<p>Who is that guy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to.</p>
<p>That, you know, the trope of the some some some form be somewhere between Don Amici and</p>
<p>Robert Mitchum as being the guy in command of the boat.</p>
<p>Yes. Some battle between Burt Lancaster and Clark Gable.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m used to that, that that I&rsquo;ve never seen some old silver haired guy who</p>
<p>looks like he shouldn&rsquo;t friggin be there.</p>
<p>So picked it up.</p>
<p>As of page two, I was enmeshed in Forrester&rsquo;s book that tells the tale of these of these</p>
<p>the sequence of days from inside Ernie Krause&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>All of his thoughts, the math that he does in his head, the geometry, the the the</p>
<p>sensibility of when he has to call off the general quarters so that sailors who have</p>
<p>been in their posts for the last five hours can go to the bathroom, maybe get some rest,</p>
<p>have some hot food if it&rsquo;s possible to serve hot food.</p>
<p>What it means as far as the time goes, how much time do they have to straighten up the</p>
<p>column? Because not all those ships can make the zigzags at the same time.</p>
<p>Do you know when when when the convoys the convoys were were told when to make a zigzag</p>
<p>either by a prescribed moment of time or by seeing the certain proper signal flags rise</p>
<p>up on the mast of the Commodore&rsquo;s ship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they weren&rsquo;t said, OK, convoy, time to make the turn that that did not</p>
<p>happen. They just understood that, oh, we have to make the turn now.</p>
<p>So 37 ships making a turn to the left or the right by a certain number of degrees is a</p>
<p>recipe for chaos.</p>
<p>It is literally sheep in a field following the cue of each other.</p>
<p>And on the periphery are the dogs that keep them in and in order, the good shepherds,</p>
<p>the good shepherds.</p>
<p>So all everything that happened in the it&rsquo;s right down to the quality of of a cup of</p>
<p>coffee or or the frustration that he doesn&rsquo;t get to have a full bite of what a</p>
<p>sandwich is or of his wolfing down a meal in a matter of three minutes because he knows</p>
<p>that if he doesn&rsquo;t have the calories in his body, he&rsquo;s not going to be able to think</p>
<p>clearly. And when the time comes up, he won&rsquo;t be able to do the math or respond.</p>
<p>Along with that came comes the fact that we know that we know we won the war, right?</p>
<p>Yes. And we have seen many, many times a sonar guy saying, wait a minute, what is it?</p>
<p>I think I hear something or radar coming on, going bloop, bloop, bloop, that&rsquo;s showing</p>
<p>us where something is. Radar, particularly in 1942, ridiculously complicated and and</p>
<p>glitchy. Yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes sometimes all you saw was the crest of the waves, the 20 foot waves on your</p>
<p>radar screen. You saw nothing else except patterns of these waves, even down to the</p>
<p>depth charges that in 1942 were bulky, nearly boxy.</p>
<p>They were not streamlined.</p>
<p>So each one of them sank at a varyingly slow rate.</p>
<p>Later on, they had streamlined depth charges.</p>
<p>They had hedgehogs and all these other all these other weaponry.</p>
<p>But in 1942, they had essentially they were dumping explosive garbage cans into the</p>
<p>water, waiting for them to float down to a certain depth and then exploding and maybe</p>
<p>damaging something that could be there, could not be there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to sonar recordings, training, training records, literally 45 records</p>
<p>that you put a needle on for and from from the era.</p>
<p>And it sounds something like this.</p>
<p>Example six.</p>
<p>A engine running at 14 knots, screw noises.</p>
<p>Example seven.</p>
<p>Torpedo on approach.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to tell me that in primitive 1942 headphones, earbuds, a la, you</p>
<p>know, FDR&rsquo;s era, that you&rsquo;re going to be able to figure out what that is over a over a</p>
<p>hydrophone that&rsquo;s also fighting waves and and what have you.</p>
<p>The the inaccuracy of all of this stuff preyed on Colonel on Ernie Krause&rsquo;s mind, and</p>
<p>he had to take it all into account.</p>
<p>So in the book there it was.</p>
<p>So adapting it was a fever dream for me.</p>
<p>I just said, OK, I&rsquo;m only doing this for myself because, damn it, no one else would</p>
<p>take the job. It&rsquo;s very, very frustrating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do this homework.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have to sit around and do all this.</p>
<p>I was hoping I was going to get one of my, you know, my great writer pals to take one</p>
<p>look at it and just say, oh, turn me loose.</p>
<p>First of all, nobody wants to do any anybody else&rsquo;s work but their own.</p>
<p>And no one wants to be, by and large, they don&rsquo;t want to be locked into the procedure of</p>
<p>adapting something that you have to stay pretty adhered to.</p>
<p>So I ended up taking off and I said, I am going to pick every cherry off this tree that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in love with and I&rsquo;m going to put it down here on paper.</p>
<p>And it was thick.</p>
<p>It had animation.</p>
<p>It had mind&rsquo;s eye demonstrations.</p>
<p>I wanted to try to to to communicate somehow that Krauss was thinking about where</p>
<p>these submarines could possibly be by having swastikas dancing on the waves of where</p>
<p>he thought they might be.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Now, the problem with that is, is, first of all, it blows the budget up because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just our special, our special effects budget here.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re trying to make all these ships in the sea and everything look</p>
<p>like photo reality, that requires a fidelity that ain&rsquo;t cheap.</p>
<p>So that was one aspect of it.</p>
<p>But coming also into anybody else who read it, to me, it was like, don&rsquo;t you see?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s like the imagining.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s haunting Krauss himself.</p>
<p>And almost to a to a to a person, everybody who read it down at the office, as well as</p>
<p>Aaron Schneider, who was the director, director of it, he he said this, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving it away, you&rsquo;re showing the shark.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, totally.</p>
<p>And I went, damn you to hell with your logic of of all this.</p>
<p>So there was that there was an awful lot of things.</p>
<p>And the paring away of all those things is what is required when you&rsquo;re making the</p>
<p>leap. I went, I adapted a book and put it in into a hundred and twenty some odd page</p>
<p>screenplay that remains only a blueprint for what has to be the cinematic narrative</p>
<p>that is visual and that has to be.</p>
<p>I was lucky in that we got to be as cryptic as we are.</p>
<p>Because the uninitiated and let&rsquo;s just call that let&rsquo;s call the uninitiated any</p>
<p>executive at the studio who sees the movie will say, can you help us understand a</p>
<p>little bit of what the danger is here, what the stakes are?</p>
<p>And of course, you know, I have to bite my tongue saying, do you honestly not</p>
<p>understand what the stakes are?</p>
<p>We just want to know what what what the jeopardy really is here.</p>
<p>Can you flesh it out a little bit more?</p>
<p>Can you can you give us some hints as to what the conflict is?</p>
<p>This war is a big thing.</p>
<p>This is a big war, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I would say, oh, yeah, you know what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to add a we&rsquo;re going to add a line so that one of the lookouts will say</p>
<p>this. Captain, there&rsquo;s a U-boat on the surface, they might be trying to sink us with</p>
<p>one of their torpedoes.</p>
<p>And I said, OK, we&rsquo;re not going to have those kind of lines.</p>
<p>We had, you know, I was schooled in a lot of this stuff by other directors that I</p>
<p>worked with and Ronnie Allard on on Apollo 13 when we were putting it all together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this concept of gimbal lock.</p>
<p>Gimbal lock, you do not you do not want to command module on the way to the moon to</p>
<p>experience gimbal lock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really bad thing.</p>
<p>It essentially negates all of your navigator.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell where you are if the three gimbals lock gimbal lock.</p>
<p>Bad thing.</p>
<p>Ron said, how are we going to know that&rsquo;s a bad thing?</p>
<p>And we said, because we&rsquo;re going to say it in a real serious manner.</p>
<p>Hey, do anything.</p>
<p>Make sure you don&rsquo;t make sure you don&rsquo;t go into gimbal lock.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you need. We don&rsquo;t have to talk about the three gyros that handle the X,</p>
<p>the Y and the Z.</p>
<p>Actually, we don&rsquo;t have to go through.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to go break down and do show schematics of the navigational propulsion</p>
<p>system in the command.</p>
<p>So we were able to enjoy the same sort of faith in in in being cryptic, as well as</p>
<p>letting the nomenclature and the procedure define itself as we went along.</p>
<p>The truth is about the pilot house under these circumstances is the only two people</p>
<p>that move around on who are permanently on watch is the commander, the captain and</p>
<p>the talker who follows him everywhere.</p>
<p>The talker communicating by the most primitive form of electronics imaginable.</p>
<p>He plugs in his headset into an outlet wherever he is standing and stands right</p>
<p>next to the captain to repeat everything he hears over his headphones and then to</p>
<p>repeat into the headphones anything the captain says to him.</p>
<p>Now, that means you end up hearing stuff from sonar.</p>
<p>You end up hearing stuff from the radar.</p>
<p>You end up hearing stuff from all over the ship that comes out of the voice and the</p>
<p>face of the actor who is playing the talker.</p>
<p>Everybody else stands stock still.</p>
<p>The helmsman does not move away from that steering wheel, the telegraph operator, the</p>
<p>guy who operates the engine, who sends the, you know, forward back speed all ahead</p>
<p>two thirds. He stands right next to the engine telegraph, the the guy who writes</p>
<p>down the plot, who keeps the right.</p>
<p>Nobody moves for four hours at a time.</p>
<p>And the nomenclature that goes off, the dialogue that goes back to when they said,</p>
<p>how can how can how do we know what a con is?</p>
<p>How can they how can they keep saying, I have a con, you have a con?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>And he said, you will you will figure out over time that one of the most important</p>
<p>things for everybody to know on the bridge is who&rsquo;s in charge of steering the boat.</p>
<p>So when someone comes on, when the captain comes on and says, Mr.</p>
<p>Harbert, I have the con, that means they don&rsquo;t listen to anybody else except the</p>
<p>captain. And when the captain says, Mr.</p>
<p>Harbert, you have the con, Mr.</p>
<p>Harbert says, yes, sir, I have the con.</p>
<p>So everybody knows you listen to Mr.</p>
<p>Harbert for all those.</p>
<p>Right. So there&rsquo;s never a question.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of stuff that becomes number one, the language of it.</p>
<p>I hearken it back to seeing like the Seven Samurai, Kurosawa&rsquo;s Seven Samurai in the</p>
<p>original Japanese. And you&rsquo;re reading the subtitles, but about three minutes and you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re hearing the Japanese.</p>
<p>You know, you think you speak Japanese because it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s all matched up so</p>
<p>perfectly. It&rsquo;s the same thing with this.</p>
<p>You figure out that, oh, oh, I actually understand the rules now a little bit</p>
<p>better. What&rsquo;s going on outside of that?</p>
<p>God bless C.S.</p>
<p>Forrester. He had absolutely no backstory whatsoever.</p>
<p>He did not go and he doesn&rsquo;t go to the Admiralty to show those people pushing around</p>
<p>the little model boats as they take messages from all around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no scene in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not even a scene on the Commodore&rsquo;s boat or on one of the submarines.</p>
<p>It all takes place, if not in Krause&rsquo;s head, on board the bridge and the decks</p>
<p>inside of the Greyhound itself, which is actually a code name for a ship called the</p>
<p>USS Keeling.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;d be amazed at how troublesome it can be to refer to the one ship in your</p>
<p>movie by two different names.</p>
<p>So it all just they all just became code names.</p>
<p>This is the Greyhound. One of the one of the great things that I did not know, I did</p>
<p>not know this until I read it, was the talk between ships.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to talk on the radio when you&rsquo;re when you&rsquo;re at sea like this, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be constantly getting on the radio and say, hey, I got a problem with</p>
<p>this. And can you hurry up and get to me there?</p>
<p>And where are you? You don&rsquo;t want to do that because the enemy is listening to</p>
<p>anything that comes in.</p>
<p>But how do you have that instantaneous conversation between the four shepherds, the</p>
<p>four ships that are that are tasked with this?</p>
<p>Well, it was a little thing called talk between ships.</p>
<p>Yes. Which was it?</p>
<p>Which was a radio.</p>
<p>Very short language.</p>
<p>It was VHF line of sight, meaning that if a ship was on the other side of the horizon,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t talk to it.</p>
<p>So you got on very quickly, you spoke in a more or less an abbreviated code, go back</p>
<p>to station. What is your status?</p>
<p>Things like that. So that even if and by the way, the Nazis were listening, they were</p>
<p>sitting around on their radios when they were up on the surface, just going back and</p>
<p>forth across the VHF spectrum to find a wavelength that the talk between ships was</p>
<p>using. And then they&rsquo;d land on that, listen in for as long as they could.</p>
<p>And then they would periodically change in order to in order just to in order to to</p>
<p>monkey around in order to make put in some some guesswork.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>I thought it was just, you know, Dan, we the average American knows most of its naval</p>
<p>terminology and and strategy from watching episodes of Star Trek.</p>
<p>Oh, I wish you said that.</p>
<p>I almost brought that up.</p>
<p>I said there&rsquo;s a little bit of Star Trek in this one of the real combat episodes, you</p>
<p>know, hailing frequencies, Mr.</p>
<p>Chekov. Romulans coming.</p>
<p>Yes. Romulans, we have this, you know, there&rsquo;s Spock over his little blue light visor</p>
<p>thing saying, hmm, he&rsquo;s got the sonar and the radar report saying it might be this.</p>
<p>It might be that it might be over here.</p>
<p>The Romulans use a cloaking device.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sure where they are.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing. Here&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>And this is, again, nobody knows this stuff because we we have been accepting the</p>
<p>tropes of the cinema of this in which is just too hard to explain something as basic as</p>
<p>this, except for probably Wolfgang Peterson&rsquo;s Dust Boat, which is the granddaddy of all</p>
<p>these things. You watch Dust Boat, you realize that, oh, my God, man, they had to take all</p>
<p>that food with them at any given time.</p>
<p>One of the toilets was filled up with bread and sausages.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They did not have a lot of room in this place.</p>
<p>One of the things that we that is so hard to communicate was incredibly important is</p>
<p>that when a Nazi submarine went down under, went under the water, it slowed down to to</p>
<p>only six knots.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t manage much more than six or seven knots.</p>
<p>So on the surface, they can keep up with a ship.</p>
<p>They can keep up with a convoy.</p>
<p>They just got to stay out of sight.</p>
<p>They just got to stay on the other side.</p>
<p>They got to stay muted.</p>
<p>Anytime they go underwater, they can only go about a third as fast as they could on the</p>
<p>surface. Nobody knows that.</p>
<p>Everybody thinks, oh, they just, you know, that&rsquo;s how they got there.</p>
<p>They went underwater and they found, no, no.</p>
<p>Once they sighted them, then they started going back up and down.</p>
<p>And they could not stay underwater for very long.</p>
<p>Why? Because their engines were powered by batteries.</p>
<p>They were the you know, there&rsquo;s a famous submarine plant in the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Electric Boat Company because they were electric boats.</p>
<p>When they went underwater, batteries, electricity powered their screws and drove them</p>
<p>through the water.</p>
<p>Batteries go dead, especially, you know, World War Two era Nazi batteries from 1939.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, you know, I don&rsquo;t know how long they could tune in the radio.</p>
<p>Eventually they have to be recharged.</p>
<p>And the only way to recharge them is to go back up to the surface where your exhaust</p>
<p>from your diesel engines can not only power your boat, but also power the generators that</p>
<p>recharge your batteries.</p>
<p>It ends up becoming such a convoluted thing that if you want to ignore it, you can.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re cheating the authenticity of all the serendipity of the one damn thing</p>
<p>after another aspect of the drama.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s what what could we throw into the mix there dialogue wise that would</p>
<p>communicate somehow that submarines, when they go underwater, have to go really slow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one line that Aaron and I and Stephen Graham came up with when we were doing</p>
<p>it, when we were mapping out, how do we communicate this stuff?</p>
<p>And Ernie Krauss says to Charlie, you know, can you plot a course on this heading at</p>
<p>six knots and give us a point of intersection?</p>
<p>All right. This much time going this, them going this speed, us going our speed, we</p>
<p>should be able to find them in, you know, like six miles.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a lot of math.</p>
<p>If you really had to explain it outside of a couple of visuals, you know, we show</p>
<p>literally a grease pencil and a protractor and a ruler on a map.</p>
<p>If you had to really get into it, my gosh, it would just take absolutely forever.</p>
<p>And so I said, we we do it and the audience, the audience will catch up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you where you kicked my rear end.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a place that it would have kicked my rear end if I was watching</p>
<p>Platoon in the 1980s and I was a 20 year old.</p>
<p>Right. You kicked my rear end when I&rsquo;m watching it.</p>
<p>And the the captain, of course, is almost a father figure.</p>
<p>But the the sailors on this ship, so many of them look like kids.</p>
<p>You really can.</p>
<p>And what was great about that is after it punched me in the gut and I was thinking to</p>
<p>myself, I still want to know where my 18 year old is.</p>
<p>You know, at midnight, I want a phone call.</p>
<p>And these people on this ship are no older than that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re looking at them like as a dad going, if that&rsquo;s my kid.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was like like flying with the World War two guys.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all like 23 years old.</p>
<p>If you told me my pilot on my on my Delta flight today is 23 years old.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going on that flight.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m watching this captain and he is like these these children who turned out</p>
<p>to be our grandparents, you know, 45 years later are there on this ship.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re looking to this one guy who&rsquo;s on his first mission across with the</p>
<p>convoy to protect them and to make the right decisions when he caught between a</p>
<p>rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost the transcendent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the historical experience right there of people put in the crux of the</p>
<p>moment, isn&rsquo;t it, where there&rsquo;s no good decisions and they&rsquo;re worried they</p>
<p>screwed up. And when they screwed up, people die.</p>
<p>Not to quote that Jack Nicholson line, but but I mean, that to me in that movie</p>
<p>made made that person, that captain of that ship, the everyman for me.</p>
<p>And and this could be you.</p>
<p>And what would you do in this situation?</p>
<p>And how many times would you replay it in your head for the rest of your days?</p>
<p>You know, you really made me feel that the that that that gray haired old man</p>
<p>that I saw on the cover of the book is what she is.</p>
<p>Forrester wrote. Ernie Krause graduated from the United States Naval Academy in</p>
<p>the early 1920s when there was no war.</p>
<p>He has been in the Navy ever since, and he has never risen above fitted and</p>
<p>retained that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what every one of his promotional ratings have been.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the good news.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re staying in the Navy.</p>
<p>The bad news is you&rsquo;re fitted and retained, meaning you&rsquo;re not getting an extra</p>
<p>stripe. You&rsquo;re not jumping up a pay grade.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re staying exactly where you are.</p>
<p>So Ernie Krause has written a desk, carried a briefcase to him, served on maybe</p>
<p>some ships, but not in a wartime capacity.</p>
<p>He was probably in charge of keeping track of an awful lot of things.</p>
<p>So at the top of the top of the movie, we do have we do have a one, quote, unquote,</p>
<p>flashback scene, which is right after Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>A guy who is on his way out of the Navy, probably because of lack of need as well</p>
<p>as lack of opportunity, instead is suddenly one of the most important men in</p>
<p>uniform. He&rsquo;s got he&rsquo;s got close to 20 years of naval experience.</p>
<p>As well as rank.</p>
<p>So he is now going to be given his own ship because they need a guy in charge of</p>
<p>it. He&rsquo;s going to have to go and drill a crew in training tactics.</p>
<p>A bunch of other people who, a bunch of other kids who have just signed up.</p>
<p>They signed up the day after Monday, December 8th, 1941.</p>
<p>They went in and joined up in the Navy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all kids. He is in, you know, I&rsquo;m let me just say this.</p>
<p>I play somebody who&rsquo;s like 48.</p>
<p>All right. He is not just a if you were 28 years old in the armed services in in</p>
<p>World War Two, you know what they called you?</p>
<p>Old man. They called you pop.</p>
<p>Yeah. So when they&rsquo;re making references to the old man on board Greyhound, they</p>
<p>are literally talking about an old man.</p>
<p>And not only is he an old man, he&rsquo;s an old man who&rsquo;s never done this before.</p>
<p>All of this stuff has only been theory in his head.</p>
<p>Theory in schoolwork, classroom work, book work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been at sea to a degree, but not like this and not not charged like that.</p>
<p>Aaron Schneider, the director, the conversations we always had was we wanted</p>
<p>to have I wanted to have four different watches.</p>
<p>We had three because I believe it was a watch was made up of everybody who was</p>
<p>crewing their position for four hours, four hours on, eight hours off, four hours</p>
<p>on, eight hours off, four hours on, eight hours off.</p>
<p>And so we needed fresh faces to help communicate, number one, how how much time</p>
<p>has passed. But number two, to escape that Star Trek trope of every time Captain</p>
<p>Kirk walked on the bridge, it was always the same crew, Uhuru and, you know,</p>
<p>Ensign Chekov. We needed guys who looked different, like the faces of the talkers,</p>
<p>them themselves. And we have I think we have two or three different talkers, the</p>
<p>guys who are the helmsman.</p>
<p>So we needed a parade and they were all look, I don&rsquo;t know how old they actually</p>
<p>are, but they all looked like they were 13.</p>
<p>They did. They did.</p>
<p>And and that is accurate.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, you know, Rob Morgan, who plays George Cleveland, one of the</p>
<p>Messmates. He is a he is a career Navy man.</p>
<p>He is an African-American who&rsquo;s been in the Navy probably for, you know, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably going for if he doesn&rsquo;t have his 20 years already, he&rsquo;s going to stay in</p>
<p>it because it&rsquo;s a great job.</p>
<p>You know, Charlie Cole, my executive officer, he&rsquo;s older.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a career Navy man and and probably the doctor, you know, the ship&rsquo;s doctor.</p>
<p>You know, he went through medical school.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s an older fellow.</p>
<p>But everybody else on board the ship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably average age has got to be 24 years old, and that could be as young as</p>
<p>18 or even as young as 17 for somebody who cheated on their enlistment, which a</p>
<p>lot of people did. Yes.</p>
<p>Listen, man, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s what a joy.</p>
<p>I appreciate you coming on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a great movie.</p>
<p>And if we could ever help you promote anything again or or for whatever reason,</p>
<p>keep my keep my contact handy in the Rolodex, the old digital Rolodex.</p>
<p>Would you? I will do that.</p>
<p>Indeed. Thank you so much for having this first time caller on your show.</p>
<p>I really enjoy it. Take care of yourself and thank you so much.</p>
<p>Take care, Dan. Bye bye.</p>
<p>My thanks to Tom Hanks for coming on the program, he really does sort of live up to</p>
<p>his reputation as the nicest guy in Hollywood and the movie is great.</p>
