    <p>We&rsquo;re seven minutes in and we&rsquo;ve produced absolutely nothing that will go in the show.</p>
<p>Here comes Sax, waking up with his commentary.</p>
<p>When Freeberg is criticizing you for being too negative, you&rsquo;re in a dark place, Sax.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually angry at Sax for not publishing my AMA from the other night while he publishes</p>
<p>an Evolved content. His app crashed.</p>
<p>We had such a crowded room. We had over 2,000 people in the room for like four hours.</p>
<p>It was crazy. It was like the original days of Clubhouse.</p>
<p>Everyone I know that was trying to get in was texting saying they couldn&rsquo;t get in. So</p>
<p>it definitely capped out, right? I know. Well, we hit some scalability.</p>
<p>You may want to buy an extra server, Sax. Cheap f***.</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t you the same guy who was responsible for scaring PayPal?</p>
<p>No, that was somebody else. That was eBay. They sold it before it scaled.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true. We had huge scalability challenges at PayPal, too.</p>
<p>It seems like a theme. Yeah, the theme is when you have an</p>
<p>app that&rsquo;s breaking out, you hit scalability challenges. It&rsquo;s called a high class problem.</p>
<p>2,000 people is not a high class problem. It&rsquo;s a trickle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2022. 2,000 people participating in the conversation</p>
<p>is a challenge. I haven&rsquo;t written code in 20 years.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you do when you get to 1,000 people coming to the room.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lie. Everybody else is in passive mode.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never written code ever. Of course I have.</p>
<p>Of course I have. That&rsquo;s a lie. That&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>Come on. Be honest. Oh, yeah. It&rsquo;s actually been 25.</p>
<p>The last time I wrote code was Lotus Notes.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>So there have been three cheating scandals across poker, chess, and even competitive fishing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw the fishing one, but they found weights and fillets during a fish</p>
<p>weigh-in, and then everybody wants us to check in on the chess and the poker</p>
<p>scandals. Chess.com just released their report that this grandmaster has been suspended.</p>
<p>They have evidence he cheated, basically, in a bunch of</p>
<p>tournaments that were, in fact, for money. He denied that he had done that.</p>
<p>But he had previously cheated as a kid. They now have the statistical proof</p>
<p>that he was playing, essentially, perfect chess.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve outlined this in hundreds of pages in a report.</p>
<p>Sax, what are your thoughts on this scandal in chess?</p>
<p>Magnus Carlsen finally came out and explained why he thought Hans Niemann was cheating. Basically,</p>
<p>he got the strong perception during the game that Hans wasn&rsquo;t really putting in a lot of effort,</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t under a lot of stress. It&rsquo;s his experience that when he&rsquo;s playing the top players,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re intensely concentrating, and Hans Niemann didn&rsquo;t seem to be exerting himself at all.</p>
<p>So his hackles were raised and got suspicious. Then he has had this meteoric rise, the fastest</p>
<p>rise in classical chess rating ever. I guess he had gotten suspended from chess.com in the past</p>
<p>for cheating. So on this basis, and maybe other things that Magnus isn&rsquo;t telling us,</p>
<p>Magnus basically said that this guy is cheating. I think that maybe the interesting part of this</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s been a lot of analysis now of Hans Niemann&rsquo;s games. I just think the methodology</p>
<p>is kind of interesting. So what they do is, they run all of his games through a computer,</p>
<p>and they compare his moves to the best computer move. They basically assign a percentage</p>
<p>that Hans matches, a correlation matches the computer move. What they found is,</p>
<p>there were a handful of games where it was literally 100%. That&rsquo;s basically impossible</p>
<p>without cheating. I mean, you look at the top players who, through an entire career, have never</p>
<p>had a 100% game. Chess is so subtle that the computer can now see so many moves into the future</p>
<p>that nailing the best move every single time for 40, 50, 100 moves is just&hellip;</p>
<p>And in chess, which a human really can&rsquo;t do that well, is that there are positional sacrifices</p>
<p>that you will make in short lines that pay off much, much later in the future,</p>
<p>which is impossible for a human to calculate. And you saw this, by the way,</p>
<p>when I think it was the Google AI, the DeepMind AI that also played chess. So the idea that this</p>
<p>guy could play absolutely perfectly according to those lines is only possible if you&rsquo;re cheating.</p>
<p>Right, exactly. So there were a handful of games at 100%, and then there were tournaments where</p>
<p>his percentages were in the 70-something plus. And so just to give you some basic comparison,</p>
<p>Bobby Fisher, during his legendary 20-game winning streak, was at 72%. So he only matched</p>
<p>the computer for best move 72% of the time. Magnus Carlsen, playing at his best, is 70%.</p>
<p>Garry Kasparov, in his career, was 69%. And then the super GMs category are typically in the 64%</p>
<p>to 68% range. So I think it&rsquo;s really interesting, actually, how you can now quantify, by comparing</p>
<p>the human move to the best computer move, who&rsquo;s playing the best. It provides a way to assess who</p>
<p>the greatest player ever is. I actually thought that it was Magnus, but now maybe there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>basis for believing it was Bobby Fisher, because he was at 72% and Magnus was only at 70%. However,</p>
<p>look, the idea that Hans Niemann is in the 70s, 80s, or 90s during tournaments would be,</p>
<p>you know, just an off-the-charts level of play. And if he&rsquo;s not cheating, then we should expect</p>
<p>over the next couple of years, that he should rapidly become the world&rsquo;s number one player</p>
<p>over the board. You know, now that they have all this anti-cheating stuff, right? So it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>interesting to see what happens in his career now that they&rsquo;ve really cracked down on, you know,</p>
<p>with anti-cheating technology. I have a general observation, which is these people are complete</p>
<p>fucking losers. The people that cheat in any of these games don&rsquo;t understand this basic,</p>
<p>simple idea, which is that trying is a huge part of the human experience. The whole point is to be</p>
<p>out there in the field of play, trying. And it&rsquo;s basically taking the wins and the losses and</p>
<p>getting better that is the path. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s fun. Yeah, once you actually win, it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>not that much fun, because then you have this pressure of maintaining excellence, that&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>less enjoyable than the path to getting there. And so the fact that these people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that makes them slightly broken, in my opinion. And then the other thing is, like, why is it that</p>
<p>we have this strain of people now that are just so devoid of any personal responsibility,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll just so brazenly take advantage of this stuff. It&rsquo;s really ridiculous to me,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s really sad. These people are pathetic. They&rsquo;re really pathetic.</p>
<p>This is but it is really interesting how they caught him and running this against the computer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart of his scores in these tournaments. Oh, here is this first chart is how quickly he</p>
<p>advanced, which was off the charts. And then the second chart that&rsquo;s really interesting is</p>
<p>his chess.com strength. So if you don&rsquo;t know chess.com, it has become like a juggernaut in</p>
<p>the chess world, especially after that HBO series came out, a lot of people subscribe to it, I</p>
<p>subscribe to it, I like to play chess there. And man, you look at the chess strength score there.</p>
<p>He was just like, perfect. And then the number of games he likely cheated. And you can see the</p>
<p>last two columns, he&rsquo;s basically cheating in every game. Queen&rsquo;s Gambit. Yeah, great show on Netflix.</p>
<p>And he said he didn&rsquo;t cheat in any of the games where they were live streaming,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve proven that wrong. Sax, how does he cheat in person then?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing no one really knows. And I don&rsquo;t want to overly judge until they have</p>
<p>hard proof that he was cheating. I mean, look, here&rsquo;s the thing he was never caught in the act</p>
<p>is just that the computer evidence, you know, seems pretty damning. And I don&rsquo;t know how they</p>
<p>prove. I don&rsquo;t know how they prove that he was cheating over the board without actually catching</p>
<p>him doing it. And I don&rsquo;t, I still don&rsquo;t think anyone really has a good theory in terms of how</p>
<p>he was able to do that. Well, it&rsquo;s not just in the look, look, the fishing thing, Jason,</p>
<p>which was crazy. I think Friedberg shared the video, this guy was in a fishing competition,</p>
<p>and they basically caught these fish, and then they put these big weighted pellets inside the</p>
<p>fish&rsquo;s body. They even put like a, you know, chicken breast and chicken fillets inside of</p>
<p>the thing so that they would. You know, then there&rsquo;s a poker now poker in poker, everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>afraid that there are ways in which you can read the RFID and some of the cards and some of these,</p>
<p>you know, televised situations and front run what the what the playing situation is so that you know</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re winning or losing. And again, I just asked the question, like, is it is it is this</p>
<p>are things that bad that this is what it gets to, like, we all play poker, the idea that we would</p>
<p>play against somebody that would take that edge. It&rsquo;s gross. It&rsquo;s really makes me really sad. So</p>
<p>disappointing. Yeah. One observation might be that across all three, because I&rsquo;m trying to find some</p>
<p>common thread across these, but it could be that there was a lot of cheating going on for a long</p>
<p>time. And maybe the fact that we do have so much digital imagery that&rsquo;s live on these things now,</p>
<p>and so much coverage, and everyone&rsquo;s got a cell phone that suddenly</p>
<p>our perception of the cheating in competitive events is becoming more tuned, whereas maybe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of cheating for a long time. And it&rsquo;s just kind of coming to light. I mean,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of live streaming in poker. Who knows? I mean, we could probably ask Phil this</p>
<p>or Keating, but like, for how many years? Well, there was visions. Yeah, there was tons of cheating</p>
<p>and online poker. Yeah. And online poker. Remember, like people are using these like software programs</p>
<p>that would track the hand history. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So. So it help you assess whether the</p>
<p>person might be bluffing in that particular situation. Yeah, like he has superhuman memory.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you guys I don&rsquo;t know if you guys watch Twitch, like video games, like Fortnite</p>
<p>or whatever. But there are like players that have been accused of using the screen overlay systems</p>
<p>that basically more accurately show you and drive the mouse to where an individual is on the screen</p>
<p>so you can more accurately shoot them. And so there&rsquo;s software overlays that make you a better,</p>
<p>you know, competitive video, tell you what the through line is. And then this stuff basically</p>
<p>became like, so now what&rsquo;s interesting is now there&rsquo;s eye tracking software that people are</p>
<p>using on Twitch streams to see if the individual is actually spotting the target when they shoot,</p>
<p>or if the software is spotting the target. Yeah, they&rsquo;re called reverse aim bots. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aimbot. Yeah, yeah. And like reverse cheat the whole thing. And I think what&rsquo;s interesting is</p>
<p>just that there&rsquo;s so much, you know, insight now so much more video streams, so much more. I mean,</p>
<p>think about all those guys at that competition. Yeah, and there&rsquo;s cell phones, and they all video</p>
<p>this thing happening. Yeah, I think 10 years ago, that wouldn&rsquo;t have been the case. And there</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have been a big story about it. And so there was a theme you wanted to, there was a I</p>
<p>think the theme is is pretty obvious, which is that there&rsquo;s been an absolute decay of personal</p>
<p>responsibility. People don&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s any downside to cheating anymore. And they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>willing to take it upon themselves to take a journey of wins and losses to get better at</p>
<p>something they want the easy solution. The easy solve the quick answer, you know, that gets them</p>
<p>to some sort of finish line that they&rsquo;ve imagined for themselves will solve all their problems. The</p>
<p>problem is it doesn&rsquo;t solve any problems. And it just makes them a wholly corrupt individual.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about this Hustler casino live cash game play. There&rsquo;s this woman,</p>
<p>Robbie, who is a new player. Apparently, she&rsquo;s being staked in a very high stakes game. She&rsquo;s</p>
<p>playing this guy, Garrett, who is a very, very known winning cash game player.</p>
<p>And it was a very strange hand on the turn, all the money gets in. She says she has a bluff catcher,</p>
<p>then she claims that she had a thought she misread her hand. Now people are saying that</p>
<p>the poker world seems to be 7030 that she cheated. But people keep vacillating back and forth.</p>
<p>There was a lot of weird words salad that she said that she had a bluff catcher,</p>
<p>which would normally be an ace. Then she said she thought she had a pair of threes. And then</p>
<p>she immediately said afterwards that he was giving her too much credit. They confronted her in the</p>
<p>hallway, she gave the money back because she supposedly loves production. So all this stuff</p>
<p>sounds very weird. One side says, Okay, well, this is happening because she&rsquo;s a new player.</p>
<p>The other side is saying, somebody was signaling her that she was good and giving her just a binary</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good. Because if you are going to cheat cheating with jack high in a situation where you</p>
<p>just put all in for a two and a quarter million dollar pot seems very suspect. I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>guys watch the hand breakdown, where does everybody stand on a percentage basis, I guess, if they</p>
<p>think she was cheating or not, because we this is not definitive. Obviously, it&rsquo;s not like they cut</p>
<p>it open and found the ball bearings. It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not so obvious in that situation. But I think the</p>
<p>way that that line played made no sense. Did not mean she was holding a jack four. And I guess in</p>
<p>her previous hand, she had a jack three, and there was a three on the board. So if she misread her</p>
<p>hand for 10 1093. No, but you would have but you would have you would have had to call the flop.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking what? Yeah, no, I get it. The hand makes no sense. But I&rsquo;m just trying to find a</p>
<p>logical explanation. And that jack three explanation, somebody kind of fed that to her. And</p>
<p>then she changed her story to that. So this changing of the story is the thing I was sort of</p>
<p>keyed on Friedberg is why does she keep changing your story? Is it because she&rsquo;s embarrassed?</p>
<p>Maybe she&rsquo;s had a couple of beverages or whatever. Or she&rsquo;s just a new player. And she&rsquo;s embarrassed</p>
<p>by her play and can&rsquo;t explain it. She can&rsquo;t explain the hand history. All of the things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying are probable. I don&rsquo;t think that Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any data for us to</p>
<p>have a strongly held point of view on this. I&rsquo;m just looking forward to us all playing live. Yeah,</p>
<p>HCL poker live October 21. Minus David Sachs, unfortunately, to mop J. Cal Gerstner, Stanley</p>
<p>Tang, Phil Hellmuth. So we&rsquo;re gonna be playing on the same stream. We&rsquo;re gonna be playing on the</p>
<p>same screen, same table. I figured out how to hack into the video stream for the car. I just</p>
<p>got my RFID sunglasses as well. I&rsquo;m gonna read all your shitty hands, J. Cal, I&rsquo;m gonna take your</p>
<p>money. And I&rsquo;m gonna get some I tell you, my my for my 40th birthday sky organized poker in Tahoe,</p>
<p>okay. And, and we brought in the team from CBS. That was the present. We&rsquo;re fine. And they taped</p>
<p>it as if it was being broadcast with whole cards and commentators. And we edited it into a two day</p>
<p>show. It was an incredible birthday present. I it was it&rsquo;s one of the greatest things that that</p>
<p>anybody&rsquo;s ever given me. I appreciate there was a one hour block, where somebody at the table said,</p>
<p>Okay, guys, how about we do a cheating free for all? Yes, where you could look at each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cards. And you know, you could sort of help somebody else, switch cards, whatever. In that</p>
<p>one hour, our beautiful home game of friendship became Lord of the Flies. I have never seen so</p>
<p>much hatred, angling, mean behavior. Oh my god, it was incredible. All that humans are capable of.</p>
<p>So I hope that we never, we never we never see cheating in our game. Yeah, well, we&rsquo;ll see how</p>
<p>it goes on October 21 at HCL poker live. I&rsquo;m excited. I can&rsquo;t wait. It should be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It should be a lot of fun. Oh, and we&rsquo;re not having any official 100 stuff. But the fans,</p>
<p>some of the fans who were at the all in summit 2022 are doing their own 100 episode 100 meetups</p>
<p>on October 15, I think, all in meetups.io. So there are fan meetups happening in Zurich,</p>
<p>and a bunch of other places. I&rsquo;m going to FaceTime into some of them and just say hi to the</p>
<p>fans. You know, it might be like 10 people in a bar somewhere. I think the largest one is like</p>
<p>Miami or San Francisco are going to be like 50 people or something. We should all that actually</p>
<p>be kind of fun. I&rsquo;m basically I told them to send me an invite and I&rsquo;ll FaceTime in any anytime.</p>
<p>This is next week. When is this? The 15th? I think this is occurring. Yeah, October 15. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Saturday, the Saturday after the 100th episode, people are doing these all in meetups.io. What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>next? Earlier this week, it was reported that Elon contacted Twitter&rsquo;s board and suggested that</p>
<p>they move forward with closing the transaction at the original terms and the original purchase price</p>
<p>of $54.20 a share in the couple of days since then. And even as of right now, with some news</p>
<p>reports coming out here on Thursday morning, it&rsquo;s it appears that there are still some question</p>
<p>marks around whether or not the deal is actually going to move forward at 5420 a share because Elon</p>
<p>as of right now the report said is still asking for a financing contingency in order to close and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of back and forth on what the terms are. Meanwhile, the court case in Delaware is</p>
<p>continuing forward on whether or not Elon breached his terms of the original agreement to close and</p>
<p>buy Twitter at 5420. As we know, leading up to the signed deal or post signing the deal,</p>
<p>Elon put together a financing syndicate, a combination of debt investors as well as equity</p>
<p>co investors with him to do the purchase of Twitter at $54.20 a share. So the 40 some odd</p>
<p>billion dollars of capital that&rsquo;s needed was committed by a set of investors that were going</p>
<p>to invest debt and equity. And there&rsquo;s a big question mark now on whether or not those investors</p>
<p>want to or would still consummate the transaction with Elon given how the markets have turned,</p>
<p>and given how debt markets are trading and equity markets are trading. So Chamath, I&rsquo;d love to hear</p>
<p>your point of view on what hurdles does Elon still have in front of him? Does he still want</p>
<p>to get this done? And is there still a financing syndicate that&rsquo;s standing behind him at the</p>
<p>original purchase price to get it done? It&rsquo;s a great question. Maybe the best way to start is</p>
<p>Nick, do you want to queue up what I said in August 25? The lawsuit really boils down to</p>
<p>one very specific clause, which is the pinnacle question at hand, which is there is a specific</p>
<p>performance clause that Elon signed up to, right, which, you know, his lawyers could have struck out</p>
<p>and either chose not to, or, you know, couldn&rsquo;t get the deal done without. And that specific</p>
<p>performance clause says that Twitter can force him to close at 5420 a share. And I think the</p>
<p>issue at hand at the Delaware Business Court is going to be that because Twitter is going to point</p>
<p>to all of these, you know, gotchas and disclaimers that they have around this bot issue as their</p>
<p>cover story. And I think that really, you know, this kind of, again, builds more and more momentum</p>
<p>in my mind that the most likely outcome here is a settlement where you have to pay the economic</p>
<p>difference between where the stock is now and 5420, which is more than a billion dollars,</p>
<p>or you close at some number below $54 and 20 cents a share. And I think that that is like,</p>
<p>you know, if you had to be a betting person, that&rsquo;s probably and if you look at the,</p>
<p>the way the stock is traded, and if you also look at the way the options market trades,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people are assuming that there&rsquo;s a seven to $10 billion swing. And if you impute</p>
<p>that into the stock price, you kind of get into the $51 a share kind of an acquisition price.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying that that is right, or should be right. That&rsquo;s just sort of what the</p>
<p>market says. Yeah, so so it turns out that, you know, sort of like that kind of guesstimate turned</p>
<p>out to be pretty accurate, because the stock today is at $51 a share. So I think that the</p>
<p>specific performance thing is exactly what this thing has always hinged on. And I think that there</p>
<p>was a realization that there were very few outs around how that contractual term was written and</p>
<p>agreed to. So there is an out in the contract. And that out says that I think it&rsquo;s by April,</p>
<p>if, if the deal doesn&rsquo;t get done by April, then the banks can walk away from their commitment to</p>
<p>fund the debt. And if the banks walk away, then Elon does have a financing contingency that allows</p>
<p>him to walk away. So the actual set of events that have to happen is those two things specifically,</p>
<p>get to April, so the banks can pass and say, we&rsquo;ve changed our mind, market conditions are different.</p>
<p>And then Elon is able to say, Oh, you know, the banks just walked away. Right now, the banks,</p>
<p>if you look at all of the debt that they&rsquo;ve committed to, what they committed at a point</p>
<p>in time when the debt markets were much better than they are today. In the last, you know,</p>
<p>six or seven months, since they agreed to do this, the debt markets have been clobbered,</p>
<p>and specifically junk bonds and a bunch of junk bond debt, the yields that you have to pay. So</p>
<p>the price to get that kind of debt has skyrocketed. So roughly back of the envelope math would tell me</p>
<p>that right now the banks are offside between one and $2 billion, because they&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>able to sell this debt to anybody else. So I think the banks obviously want to weigh out. The problem</p>
<p>is their only way out is to run the shot clock off until April. So I think that&rsquo;s the dance that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in right now. Elon&rsquo;s trying to find a way to solve, you know, for the merger. I think Twitter</p>
<p>is going to say, we&rsquo;re not going to give you a financing contingency, you have to bring the</p>
<p>banks in and close right now. And then we will not go to court. Otherwise, we&rsquo;re going to court.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s a very delicate predicament that they&rsquo;re all in. But my estimate is that</p>
<p>the equity is probably 20% offside. So it&rsquo;s not a huge thing. He can make that up because he can</p>
<p>create equity value like nobody&rsquo;s business. The debt is way offside by a couple billion dollars,</p>
<p>which is hard to make back. But I think in the end, you know, given enough time, they can probably</p>
<p>make that back. The best off in all of this are the Twitter shareholders. They&rsquo;re getting an</p>
<p>enormous premium to what that company is worth today in the open market. And so I think this</p>
<p>deal is going to close is probably going to close in the next few weeks. And had you bought Twitter,</p>
<p>when we were talking about it in August, you would have made 25% in six weeks. And you know,</p>
<p>if the deal closes at 54, you would have made, you know, a third of your money in eight weeks,</p>
<p>which is, you know, very hard to do in a market. If you&rsquo;re a GP at one of the funds,</p>
<p>like Andreessen or Sequoia, and you had made this commitment to Elon, or even Larry Ellison,</p>
<p>a couple months ago, do you fight against closing at 5420? Do you stick with the deal</p>
<p>and support him? I mean, what do you do given that the premium is so much higher than where</p>
<p>the market would trade it at today, some people are saying the stock should be at like 20 bucks</p>
<p>a share or something, the average premium in an M&amp;A transaction in the public markets is about</p>
<p>30%. So and I think the fair value of Twitter is around 32 to 35 bucks a share. So, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like he is massively, massively overpaying. And so, you know, I would just sort</p>
<p>of keep that in the realm of the possible. So like, if you take $35 as the midpoint,</p>
<p>fair value is really 4550. So yeah, he paid 20% more than he should have, but he didn&rsquo;t pay 100%</p>
<p>more. So it&rsquo;s not as if you can&rsquo;t make that equity back as a private company, particularly because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably $10 of fat in the stock. If you think about just opex, right in terms of all the</p>
<p>buildings they have, maybe they don&rsquo;t need as many employees, maybe they revisit salaries. You know,</p>
<p>one thing is when I looked at doing an activist play at Twitter, I think I mentioned this five</p>
<p>or six years ago, one of the things that I found was at that time, Twitter was running their own</p>
<p>data centers. And you know, the most obvious thing for me at that time was like, we&rsquo;re going to move</p>
<p>everything to AWS. Now, I don&rsquo;t know if that happened. But I&rsquo;m sure that if it hasn&rsquo;t, just</p>
<p>bidding that out to Azure, GCP and AWS can raise, you know, three or $4 billion, because I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>those companies would want this kind of an app on their cloud. So there&rsquo;s all kinds of things that</p>
<p>I think Elon can do as a private company, to make back, maybe the small bit that he overpaid. And</p>
<p>then he can get to the core job of rebuilding this company to be usable, or this product to</p>
<p>be usable. But look, I&rsquo;ll just speak as a user right now. It has been decaying at a very, very</p>
<p>rapid clip. And I think that his trepidation and closing the merger, in part also, even though he</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t said it has to do with the quality of the experience. It&rsquo;s just degraded. It&rsquo;s not as fun to</p>
<p>use as it was during the pandemic, or even before the pandemic. So something is happening inside</p>
<p>that app that needs to get fixed. And if he does it, he&rsquo;ll make a ton of money,</p>
<p>sort of like what happened with Friendster and MySpace and any social networking app over time,</p>
<p>the quality degrades. If it&rsquo;s not growing, it&rsquo;s shrinking. And it gets if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s not growing.</p>
<p>And also if the product hygiene isn&rsquo;t enforced in code and product hygiene, in this case, are this,</p>
<p>you know, spam bots, you know, the trolling, it can really take away from the experience.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, interestingly, like, if you think back to the original, the starting days,</p>
<p>the original days of Twitter, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember, you would send in an SMS to</p>
<p>do your tweet. And then it would post up and other people would get the SMS notification.</p>
<p>And it would crash all the time. And the apps were the app was notoriously crashing. It was</p>
<p>poorly architected at the beginning. And some people have argued that Twitter has had</p>
<p>a cultural technical incompetence from the earliest days.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a little harsh. So I do think look, Twitter was known for what&rsquo;s called a fail whale.</p>
<p>You know, they used to have these fail whales constantly. And they did hire people that</p>
<p>attempted to try to fix it. I remember the the funniest part of when I went in there and said,</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my plan. And here&rsquo;s what I want to do is literally a day or two later,</p>
<p>the head of engineering quit. I can&rsquo;t remember who his name was, but he was just out the door.</p>
<p>But it is a I think it is a team that has tried its best. That probably at the edges,</p>
<p>definitely made some technical miscalculations. Like I said, at that time,</p>
<p>the idea that any app of that scale would use their own data centers made no technical sense</p>
<p>whatsoever. It made the app laggy. It made it hard to use it made it more prone to downtime,</p>
<p>to your point. But that being said, I would be shocked if they haven&rsquo;t made meaningful improvements</p>
<p>because the stack of the internet has gotten so much better over the last seven years. And so</p>
<p>to your point, David, if they didn&rsquo;t take advantage of all these new abstractions and</p>
<p>mechanisms, mechanisms to rebuild the app or to rebuild search or to rebuild, you know, how,</p>
<p>you know, all these infrastructure elements of the app work, I would be really surprised because</p>
<p>then what are they doing over there? Yeah, well, look, I mean, to the point earlier,</p>
<p>besides the product points, there was a really good tweet. I liked that said, For what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth, I think Elon will show us just how lean the Silicon Valley advertising companies can be run.</p>
<p>At the very least, it&rsquo;ll be an interesting thought experiment for spectators. Because if he does go</p>
<p>in and actually does significantly reduce opex and headcount, and the company does turn profitable,</p>
<p>and he can grow it, well, it&rsquo;ll really, by the way, it&rsquo;ll really be a beacon for financial big</p>
<p>companies. Yeah, from a financial perspective, there is $10 a share in opex cuts that he should</p>
<p>make right away, just so that he is economically break even. And he looks like every other M&amp;A</p>
<p>transaction, you know, you paid a 30% premium and you bought a company, there&rsquo;s a lot of margin of</p>
<p>safety there if Elon does that. So to your point, there probably is. And there probably needs to be</p>
<p>a meaningful riff at Twitter. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s, you know, and I feel</p>
<p>for the people that may go through it. But from a financial perspective, the math makes sense for</p>
<p>him to do that, because then he is a break even proposition on a go in M&amp;A transaction. And I</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of intelligent financial sense, so that all the debt holders feel</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s doing the right thing. And all the equity holders, particularly see a chance for</p>
<p>them to make a decent return here. All right, well, let&rsquo;s move on. This is a great conversation</p>
<p>between Chamath Palihapitiya and Dave Friedberg about the Twitter transaction. And now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being rejoined by our besties. Yeah. How was your cappuccino? J Cal? That was great. I have I have</p>
<p>I have a nice cold brew here. A nice iced cold brew and a nice drip coffee. I&rsquo;m working but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk about topics. I&rsquo;m not being subpoenaed or depositioned about.</p>
<p>We will have a lot to say in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I love to talk about topics that my lawyers have advised me not to talk about.</p>
<p>How brutal how eerie was our prediction? 51 bucks a share. It is exactly where the</p>
<p>stock is right now. That&rsquo;s eerie. Yeah. All right. Lots of advances. Let&rsquo;s keep going.</p>
<p>Yeah. Speaking of Elon Tesla AI day was last week, I actually went it was great. This is a</p>
<p>recruiting event where what did you do after Phil Helmuth and I went and I drove Phil Helmuth home.</p>
<p>The end. No, it&rsquo;s a great event. And it is essentially a giant recruiting event. Hundreds</p>
<p>of AI. Sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. Can we just talk about Phil Helmuth non sequitur in the group</p>
<p>chat about Ken Griffin? I mean, oh, yeah, well, he&rsquo;s just like, I made a joke about his net worth</p>
<p>and why he responded. What is going on? We were talking about the most serious of topics and he</p>
<p>just comes seven seconds to fill. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on. Seven seconds to fill. By the way, I</p>
<p>was texting with Daniel Negreanu. He did an incredible podcast. If you guys with Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t listened to it, the Daniel Negreanu pod with Lex is incredible. But I was joking with</p>
<p>Daniel that there&rsquo;s a section where he&rsquo;s talking about the greatest poker players of all time.</p>
<p>And if you look in the bar of YouTube, it shows where the most viewership was. And it was exactly</p>
<p>the 30 seconds he talks about Helmuth. And I said to Daniel, this must have been Phil rewatching it</p>
<p>over. I put it on loop. I went to bed with it like it was ASMR to put him to bed. Oh,</p>
<p>great. Talking about him. Sorry, Jacob. Sorry. No, no, it&rsquo;s all good. So anyway, the event was</p>
<p>super impressive. Elon only spoke when he showed the optimist, the new robot,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s building a general purpose robot that will work in the factories. It&rsquo;s very early days.</p>
<p>But they showed two versions of it. And he said he thinks they could get it down to $20,000. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to work in the factory. So it&rsquo;s actually got a purpose. And obviously, the factories already</p>
<p>have a ton of robots. But this is more of a robot that will benefit from the general or the the</p>
<p>computer vision. And the AI, the narrow AI being pursued by the self driving team. This is like</p>
<p>two and a half hours of really intense presentations. The most interesting part for me was</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building their own supercomputer and their chips. And the dojo supercomputer</p>
<p>was really impressive at how much they can get through scenarios. So they&rsquo;re building every</p>
<p>scenario of every self driving, I actually have the full self driving beta on my car, I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>using it. It&rsquo;s pretty impressive. I have to say, if you haven&rsquo;t used it yet, I feel like AI is</p>
<p>moving at a pretty advanced clip. The past year, if you haven&rsquo;t also seen meta announced a text</p>
<p>video generator. So this is even more impressive than Dolly Dolly, you put in a couple of words,</p>
<p>Friedberg and you get a painting or whatever. This is put in a couple of words and you get a</p>
<p>short video. So they had one of a teddy bear painting a teddy bear. So it looks like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be able to essentially create a whole movie by just talking to a computer. Really</p>
<p>impressive. Where do you think we are? Friedberg in terms of the compounding nature of these narrow</p>
<p>AI efforts, you know, obviously, so poker chess, go, Dolly GPT, three, self driving, it feels like</p>
<p>this is all compounding at a faster rate. Or am I just imagining that? Yeah, look, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting when when people saw the first computer playing chess, they said the same thing.</p>
<p>I think any time that you see progress with a computer that starts to mimic the predictive</p>
<p>capabilities of a human. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s impressive. But I will argue, and I just I&rsquo;ll say a few words</p>
<p>on this. It&rsquo;s I think this is part of a 60 year cycle that we&rsquo;ve been going through.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, what humans and human brains do is we can sense our external environment,</p>
<p>then we generate knowledge from that sensing. And then our brains build a model that predicts</p>
<p>an outcome. And then that that predicted outcome is what drives our actions and our behavior.</p>
<p>We observe the sun rise every morning, then we observe that it sets. And you see that enough</p>
<p>times and you build a predictive model from that data that&rsquo;s been generated in your brain.</p>
<p>That I predict that the sun has risen, it will therefore set, it has set it will therefore rise.</p>
<p>And I think that the computing approach is very similar. It&rsquo;s all about sensing or generating data</p>
<p>and then creating a predictive model. And then you can drive action. And initially,</p>
<p>the first approach was just basic algorithms. And these are deterministic models that are built.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a piece of code that says, here&rsquo;s an input, here&rsquo;s an output. And that that model is really</p>
<p>built by a human and a human designed to design that algorithmic model and said, this is what the</p>
<p>predictive potential of this software is. Then there was this term called data science. So as</p>
<p>data generation began to proliferate, meaning there was far more sensors in the world, it was</p>
<p>really cheap to create digital data from the physical world, really cheap to transmit it</p>
<p>really cheap to store it really cheap to compute with it. Data Science became the hot term in</p>
<p>Silicon Valley for a while. And these models were not just a basic algorithm written by a human,</p>
<p>but it became an algorithm that was a similar deterministic model that had parameters,</p>
<p>and the parameters were ultimately resolved by the data that was being generated. And so these</p>
<p>models became much more complex and much more predictive, finer granularities, finer range,</p>
<p>then we use this term machine learning. And in the data science era, it was still like,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s a model. And you would solve it statically, you would get a bunch of data,</p>
<p>you would statically solve for the parameters, and that would be your model and it would run</p>
<p>machine learning then allowed those parameters to become dynamic. So the model was static.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, the parameters that drove the model became dynamic as more data came into</p>
<p>the system, and they were dynamically updated. And then this era of AI became and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>new catchword. And what AI is realizing is that there&rsquo;s so much data that rather than just resolve</p>
<p>the parameters of the model, you can actually resolve a model itself, the algorithm can be</p>
<p>written by the data, the algorithm can be written by the software. And so with a with AI example,</p>
<p>so poker playing an adaptive model, so people, so you&rsquo;re playing poker, and the software begins</p>
<p>to recognize behavior, and it builds a predictive model that says, here&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>And then over time, it actually changes not just the parameters of the model,</p>
<p>but the model itself, the algorithm itself. And so AI, and then it eventually gets to a point</p>
<p>where the algorithm is so much more complex that a human would have never written it.</p>
<p>And suddenly, the AI has built its own intelligence, its own ability to be predictive</p>
<p>in a way that a human algorithmic programmer would have never done. And this is all driven</p>
<p>by statistics. So none of this is new science, per se, there&rsquo;s new techniques that all on their</p>
<p>underlying use statistics as their basis. And then there&rsquo;s these techniques that allow us to build</p>
<p>these new systems of model development, like neural nets, and so on. And those statistics</p>
<p>build those neural nets, they solve those parameters, and so on. But fundamentally,</p>
<p>there is a geometric increase in data, and a geometric decline in the cost to generate data</p>
<p>from sensors, because the cost of sensors is coming down with Moore&rsquo;s law, transmit that data,</p>
<p>because the cost of moving data has come down with broadband communications, the cost of storing data,</p>
<p>because the cost of DRAM and solid state hard drives has come down with Moore&rsquo;s law. And now</p>
<p>the ability to actually have enough data to do this AI driven where people are calling AI,</p>
<p>but it really is the same. It&rsquo;s part of a spectrum of things that have been going on for 60 years.</p>
<p>To actually drive predictions in the in the world is really being realized in a bunch of areas that</p>
<p>we would have historically been really challenged and surprised to see. And so my argument is,</p>
<p>at this point, data played a big role. Yeah. Yeah, we&rsquo;ve over the last decade,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve reached this tipping point in terms of data generation, storage and computation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s allowed these statistical models to resolve dynamically. And as a result,</p>
<p>they are far more predictive. And as a result, we see far more human like behavior</p>
<p>in the predictive systems, both physics, both those that are, you know, like a like a robot</p>
<p>is the same as one that existed 20 years ago. But the way that it&rsquo;s run is using the software that</p>
<p>is driven by this dynamic model. And that data allows for a better answer.</p>
<p>Okay, I have two things to say. But one, the first one is a total non sequitur. So use the</p>
<p>term data scientists, do you know where the term data scientists came from?</p>
<p>As classically used in Silicon Valley, it came from Facebook. And it came from my team in a</p>
<p>critical moment. This was in 2007. I was trying to 2008, I was trying to build the growth team.</p>
<p>This is the team that became very famous for getting to a billion users. And, you know,</p>
<p>building a lot of these algorithmic insights. And I was trying to recruit a person from Google.</p>
<p>And he was like a PhD in some crazy thing like astrophysics or particle physics or something.</p>
<p>And we gave him an offer as a data analyst, because this is what I needed. At the time,</p>
<p>this is what I thought I needed an analyst, you know, to analyze data. And he said, absolutely</p>
<p>not. I&rsquo;m offended by the job title. And I remember talking to my, my HR, you know, business process</p>
<p>partner. And I asked her, like, I don&rsquo;t understand what is this? Where&rsquo;s this coming from? And she</p>
<p>said, he fashions himself a scientist. And I said, Well, then call him a data scientist. So we wrote</p>
<p>in the offer for the first time, data scientists. And at the time, people internally were like,</p>
<p>this is a dumb title. What does this mean? Anyways, we hired the guy, he was a star. And,</p>
<p>and that title just took off internally. It&rsquo;s funny, because parallel, we started climate</p>
<p>corp in 2006. And the original, the first guy I hired was a buddy of mine, who was a 4.0 for</p>
<p>applied math from Cal. And then everyone we hired on with him, we called them the math team. And</p>
<p>they were all applied math and statistics, PhDs. And we called them the math team. And it was</p>
<p>really cool to be part of the math team. But then we switched the team name to data scientist. And</p>
<p>then it obviously created this much more kind of impressive role, impressive title, central</p>
<p>function to the organization. That was more than just a math person or data analyst, as I think it</p>
<p>may have been classically treated, because they really were building the algorithms that drove</p>
<p>the models that made the product work, right? Peter Thiel is a very funny observation. Not</p>
<p>funny, but you know, observation, which is, you should always be wary of any science that actually</p>
<p>has science in the name, political science, social science, I guess, maybe data scientists,</p>
<p>you know, because the real sciences don&rsquo;t need to qualify themselves, physics, chemistry, biology.</p>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s, so here&rsquo;s what I wanted to talk about with respect to AI. Two very important</p>
<p>observations that I think is useful for people to know. The first one, Nick, if you throw it up here</p>
<p>is just a baselining of, you know, when we have thought about intelligence and compute capability,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve always talked about Moore&rsquo;s law. And Moore&rsquo;s law, essentially, this idea that there is a fixed</p>
<p>amount of time, where the density of transistors inside of a chip would double and roughly that</p>
<p>period for many, many years was around two years. And it was largely led by Intel. And we used to</p>
<p>equate this to intelligence, meaning the more density there was in a chip, the more things</p>
<p>could be learned and understood. And we used to think about that as the progression of how</p>
<p>computing intelligence would grow, and eventually AI and artificial intelligence would would get to</p>
<p>mass market. Well, what we are now at is a place where many people have said Moore&rsquo;s law has broken</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s because we cannot cram any more transistors into a fixed amount of area,</p>
<p>we are at the boundaries of physics. And so people think, well, does that mean that our ability to</p>
<p>compute will essentially come to an end and stop? And the answer is no. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s demonstrated</p>
<p>on this next chart, just to make it simple, which is that what you really see is that if you think</p>
<p>about, you know, supercomputing power, so the ability to get to an answer, that has actually</p>
<p>continued unabated. And if you look at this chart, the reason why this is possible is entirely</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve shifted from CPUs to these things called GPUs. So you&rsquo;ve you may have heard companies</p>
<p>like Nvidia, why is companies like Nvidia done so well, it&rsquo;s because they said they raised their</p>
<p>hand and said, we can take on the work. And by taking on the work away from a traditional CPU,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to do a lot of what Friedberg said is get into these very complicated models.</p>
<p>So this is just an observation that I think that we are continuing to compound knowledge</p>
<p>and intelligence effectively at the same rate as Moore&rsquo;s law. And we will continue to be able to</p>
<p>do that because this makes it a problem of power, and a problem of money. So as long as you can buy</p>
<p>enough GPUs from Nvidia or build your own, and as long as you can get access to enough power</p>
<p>to run those computers, there really isn&rsquo;t many problems you can&rsquo;t solve. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>fascinating and interesting. And this is what companies like OpenAI are really proving, you</p>
<p>know, when they raised a billion dollars, what they did was they attacked this problem, because</p>
<p>they realized that by shifting the problem to GPUs, it left all these amazing opportunities</p>
<p>for them to uncover. And that&rsquo;s effectively what they have. The second thing that I&rsquo;ll say very</p>
<p>quickly is that it&rsquo;s been really hard for us as a society to build intelligence in a multimodal way</p>
<p>like our brain works. So think about how our brain works, our brain works in a multimodal way, we can</p>
<p>process imagery, we can process words and sounds, we can process all of these different modes,</p>
<p>text into one system, and then intuit some intelligence from it and make a decision,</p>
<p>right. So you know, we could be watching this YouTube video, there&rsquo;s going to be transcription,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s video, voice, audio, everything all at once. And we are moving to a place very quickly</p>
<p>where computers will have that same ability as well. Today, we go to very specific models and</p>
<p>kind of balkanized silos, correct, solve different kinds of problems. But those are now quickly</p>
<p>merging again, because of what I just said about GPUs. So I think what&rsquo;s really important about AI</p>
<p>for everybody to understand is the marginal cost of intelligence is going to go to zero.</p>
<p>And this is where I&rsquo;m just going to put out another prediction of my own. When that happens,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be incredibly important for humans to differentiate themselves from computers.</p>
<p>And I think the best way for humans to differentiate ourselves is to be more human,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to be less compute intensive, it&rsquo;s to be more empathetic, it&rsquo;s to be more emotional,</p>
<p>less emotional, because those differentiators are very difficult for brute force compute to solve.</p>
<p>Be careful, the replicants on this call are getting a little nervous here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not processing that that was an emotional statement.</p>
<p>Do not want to process that one. Well, I to your point, during this AI day,</p>
<p>they were showing in self driving, as you&rsquo;re talking about this balkanization,</p>
<p>and trying to make decisions across many different decision trees. You know, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at lane changes, they&rsquo;re looking at other cars and pedestrians are looking at road</p>
<p>conditions like fog and rain. And then they&rsquo;re using all this big data to your point, Friedberg</p>
<p>to run tons of different simulations. So they&rsquo;re building like this virtual world on Market Street,</p>
<p>and then they will throw people, dogs, cars, people have weird behaviors into the simulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a wonderful example. Imagine that system. Here&rsquo;s a horn. Yeah. Well,</p>
<p>you hear a horn. So clearly, there&rsquo;s some auditory expression of risk, right? There&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>risky. And now you have to scan your visual field, you have to probabilistically decide</p>
<p>what it could be, what the evasive maneuver, if anything should be. So that&rsquo;s a multimodal</p>
<p>set of intelligence that today isn&rsquo;t really available. Yeah. But we have to get there if</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have real full self driving. So that&rsquo;s a perfect example, Jason, a real world</p>
<p>example of how hard the problem is, but it&rsquo;ll get solved because we can brute force it now with,</p>
<p>with chips and with compute. I think that&rsquo;s going to be the very interesting thing with the robots</p>
<p>as well as all of these decisions they&rsquo;re making, moving cars through roads, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to see that with VTOLs, vertical takeoff and landing, you know, aircraft, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to see it with this general robot. And everybody wanted to ask you a lot about general</p>
<p>AI, you know, the Terminator kind of stuff. And his position is, I think, if we solve enough of</p>
<p>these problems, Friedberg, it&rsquo;ll be an emergent behavior or an emergent phenomenon, I guess,</p>
<p>would be a better word, based on each of these cities crumbling, you know, each of these tasks</p>
<p>getting solved by groups of people. You have any thoughts as we wrap up here on the discussion</p>
<p>about general AI and the timeline for that, because obviously, we&rsquo;re going to solve every</p>
<p>vertical AI problem in short order. I spoke about this a little bit on the ask AMA on Colin</p>
<p>on Tuesday night. Once sax gets it out, you can listen to it. But I really have this strong belief</p>
<p>that servers crash. There&rsquo;s no way this episode drops. Okay, yeah, you guys can try to download</p>
<p>the app, but it might crash. So just be careful. So here&rsquo;s, here&rsquo;s my my court.</p>
<p>Friedberg that you were 10 times more popular than J Cal. So it was unexpected levels of traffic.</p>
<p>Well, you had you did have an account with 11,000 followers. I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right, Jake, I will put you on that account next time.</p>
<p>Yeah, please. I&rsquo;m starting from zero.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fair. That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, my my court thesis is I think humans transition from being,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it, you know, passive in the system on earth to being laborers. And then we transition</p>
<p>from being laborers to being creators. And I think our next transition with AI is to transition from</p>
<p>being creators to being narrators. And what I mean by that is, as as we started to do work on earth</p>
<p>and engineer the world around us, we did labor to do that we literally plowed the fields, we walk</p>
<p>distances, we built things. And over time, we built machines that automated a lot of that labor.</p>
<p>You know, everything from a plow to a tractor to a caterpillar equipment to a microwave that</p>
<p>cooks for us, labor became less, we became less dependent on our labor abilities. And then we got</p>
<p>to switch our time and spend our time as creators as knowledge workers. And a vast majority of the</p>
<p>developed world now primarily spends their time as knowledge workers creating and we create stuff</p>
<p>on computers, we do stuff on computers, but we&rsquo;re not doing physical labor anymore. As a lot of the</p>
<p>knowledge work gets supplanted by AI, or as it&rsquo;s being termed now, but really gets supplanted by</p>
<p>software, the role of the human I think transitions to being one of a narrator, where instead of</p>
<p>having to create the blueprint for a house, you narrate the house you want, and the software</p>
<p>creates the blueprint for you dictate. And instead of Yeah, and instead of creating the movie and</p>
<p>spending $100 million producing a movie, you dictate or you narrate the movie you want to see,</p>
<p>and you iterate with the computer and the computer renders the entire film for you,</p>
<p>because those films are shown digitally anyway, so you can have a computer render it. Instead of</p>
<p>creating a new piece of content, you narrate the content you want to experience, you create your</p>
<p>own video game, you create your own movie experience. And I think that there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>evolution that happens. And if you look, Steve Pinker&rsquo;s book, enlightenment now has a great</p>
<p>statistic, a set of statistics on this. But the amount of time that humans are spending on leisure</p>
<p>activities per week has climbed extraordinarily over the past couple of decades, we spend more</p>
<p>time enjoying ourselves and exploring our creative interests than we ever did in the in the past in</p>
<p>human history, because we were burdened by all the labor and all the creative and knowledge work</p>
<p>we have to do. And now things are much more accessible to us. And I think that AI allows</p>
<p>us to transition into an era that we never really thought possible to realize where the limits are</p>
<p>really our imagination of what we can do with the world around us. And the software resolves to the</p>
<p>automation resolves to make those things possible. And that&rsquo;s a really exciting kind of vision for</p>
<p>the future that I think AI enables</p>
<p>Star Trek had this right, people didn&rsquo;t have to work and they could pursue things in the holodeck</p>
<p>or whatever that they felt was rewarding to them. But speaking of jobs, the job reports for August</p>
<p>came in, we talked about this, we were trimming 300,000 jobs a month. We&rsquo;re wondering if the other</p>
<p>shoe would drop a boy did it drop 100 over a million jobs burned off in August. So without</p>
<p>getting into the macro talk, it does feel like what the Fed is doing, and companies doing hiring</p>
<p>freezes and cuts is finally finally having an impact. If we start losing a million, as we</p>
<p>predicted could happen here on the show. People might actually go back to work and lift and Uber</p>
<p>are reporting that the driver shortages are over, they no longer have to pay people spiffs and stuff</p>
<p>like that to get people to come back to work. So at least here in America feels like we&rsquo;re turning</p>
<p>a corner. Do we want to go? Can we let&rsquo;s talk about the marijuana? Yeah, breaking news. Biden</p>
<p>just did. Yeah, yeah, I was gonna say, we got a couple of things we really want to get to here.</p>
<p>Ukraine, section 230. And then this breaking news. We&rsquo;ll pull it up here on the screen.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re recording the show, President Biden says, and I&rsquo;m just going to quote here. First,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pardoning all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. There are 1000s of people</p>
<p>who are were previously convicted of simple possession, who may be denied employment,</p>
<p>housing or educational opportunities. So my pardon will remove this burden is big news.</p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;m calling on governors to pardon simple state marijuana possession offenses,</p>
<p>just as no one should be in a federal prison solely for possessing marijuana. No, we should</p>
<p>be in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either. Finally, this is happening.</p>
<p>Third, and this is an important one, we classify the marijuana at the same level as heroin and</p>
<p>even and more serious than fentanyl makes no sense. I&rsquo;m asking Secretary burr, but Kara and</p>
<p>the Attorney General to initiate the process of reviewing how marijuana scheduled under federal</p>
<p>law. I&rsquo;d also like to note that as federal and state regulators change, we still need important</p>
<p>limitations on trafficking, marketing and underage sales of marijuana. Thoughts on this breaking</p>
<p>news. Is this giving the timing on this is kind of midterm related. This seems is this is this I</p>
<p>guess, is this a politically popular decision to do? I think so. I mean, look, I support it. So</p>
<p>Biden finally did something I like. I mean, I thought that we should decriminalize marijuana</p>
<p>for a long time, or specifically, you know, I agree with this idea of descheduling it. It</p>
<p>does not make sense to treat marijuana the same as heroin as a schedule one narcotic.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. It should be regulated separately and differently. Obviously,</p>
<p>you want to keep it out of the hands of minors, but no one should be going to jail, I think,</p>
<p>for simple possession. So I do agree with this. And I think the thing they need to do,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it mentioned here is they should pass a federal law that would allow for the</p>
<p>normalization of let&rsquo;s call it legal, legal, you know, cannabis companies. So companies that are</p>
<p>allowed to operate under state laws, like in California, should have access to the banking</p>
<p>system, should have access to the payment rails. Because right now, the reason why the legal</p>
<p>cannabis industry isn&rsquo;t working at all in California is because they can&rsquo;t bank, they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take payments. So it&rsquo;s this weird all cash business that makes no sense. So listen, if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to criminalize it as a drug like heroin, if we&rsquo;re going to allow states to make it legal,</p>
<p>then allow it to be a more normal business where the state can tax it, and it can operate in a</p>
<p>more aboveboard way. So federal mandate is what you&rsquo;re saying the federal mandate,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s could still be regulated on a state by state basis. But I think you need</p>
<p>the feds to bless the idea that banks and payment companies can take on those clients,</p>
<p>which states have already said, are legally operating companies. And right now they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a huge gap in the law. So maybe that&rsquo;s the one thing I would add to this. But I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any complaints about this right now, based on what we know from this tweet storm. And I would</p>
<p>say, this, by the way, was an about face. This was an about face by Biden. Yeah, do you know what</p>
<p>the polling data says? I mean, is there? I&rsquo;m assuming there&rsquo;s big support in kind of the</p>
<p>independence in the middle. For this was 70%. At one point. Yeah, yeah. So So look, this,</p>
<p>to me, this is the kind of thing that Biden should be doing with the 5050. Senate finding these sorts</p>
<p>of bipartisan compromises, right? So yeah, I look, this is good news. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>why hasn&rsquo;t this happened in the past? Like, what&rsquo;s been the political reason that other presidents</p>
<p>Obama even didn&rsquo;t that have similar ideology? Like, why? But why? Does anyone know why this</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been done in the past? There was rumors he was going to do in the second term. They just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have the political capital. Why to do it? Why? I don&rsquo;t want to fire. Yeah, the pardon doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>require political capital. I think it&rsquo;s probably the perception that this is soft on crime in</p>
<p>some way, or there wasn&rsquo;t enough broad based support. As David said, I mean, I think the</p>
<p>the United States population has moved pretty meaningfully in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s off, look at the chart here. You know, we were talking about 2000, it was only 31%.</p>
<p>And then you look at 2018. It&rsquo;s up at 60 plus percent. So when people saw the states doing</p>
<p>it, and they saw absolutely no problem, you know, in every state, and I think what people will see</p>
<p>next, that&rsquo;s a Gallup poll. That&rsquo;s a Gallup poll. You&rsquo;re saying? Yeah. So I mean, it&rsquo;s increased</p>
<p>dramatically. MDMA, psilocybin, and some of these other plant based medicines, ayahuasca are next,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing studies on them. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to take away from how important this is for</p>
<p>all the people for whom this will positively impact. I just want to talk about the schedule</p>
<p>change for marijuana. As a parent, one of the things that I&rsquo;m really, really concerned about</p>
<p>is that through this process of legalization, getting access to marijuana has frankly become</p>
<p>too easy, particularly for kids. At the same time, I saw a lot of really alarming evidence that the</p>
<p>the intensity of these marijuana based products have gone, you know, I think it&rsquo;s like five or</p>
<p>six times more intense than they are 50 or 100 much higher, right? So So it&rsquo;s no longer, you know,</p>
<p>this kind of like, you know, do no harm drug that it was 20 years ago. This is this could be</p>
<p>actually, David, the way that it&rsquo;s productized today, as bad as some of these other, you know,</p>
<p>narcotics. So in June of this year, the Biden administration basically made this press release</p>
<p>that said the FDA is going to come out with regulations that would cap the amount of nicotine</p>
<p>and cigarettes. And I think that was a really smart move, because it basically set the stage</p>
<p>to taper nicotine out of out of cigarettes, which would essentially, you know, decapitate it as a</p>
<p>an addictive product. And I think by thinking about how it&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s dealt with, what I really</p>
<p>hope the administration does is it empowers the FDA, if you&rsquo;re going to legalize it, you need to</p>
<p>have expectations around what the intensity of these drugs are. Because if you&rsquo;re delivering</p>
<p>drugs, OTC, and now any kid can go in at 18 years old and buy them, which means that 18 year olds</p>
<p>are going to buy them for 16 year olds, 16 year olds are going to get fake IDs to buy them for</p>
<p>themselves. You need to do a better job so that parents you&rsquo;re helping parents do our job. Here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you need. Shouldn&rsquo;t it shouldn&rsquo;t be like alcohol? If alcohol is 21, then of course,</p>
<p>fine, but even alcohol, David, you know, that there are there are, we know what the intensity</p>
<p>of these are, there are labels, and there&rsquo;s warnings. And you know, the difference between</p>
<p>beer, they&rsquo;re getting wine versus hard alcohol. But let me just give you some statistics here,</p>
<p>Chamath. If you think about the the cannabis in the 90s. And prior to that, there was very,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been a ton of studies on this in Colorado, it was the THC content was less than 2%. And then</p>
<p>in 2017, we were talking about, you know, things going up to 17 to 28% for a specific strain. So</p>
<p>they have been building strains like Girl Scout cookies, etc, that have just increased and</p>
<p>increased. And then there are things like shards, and obviously edibles, you can create whatever</p>
<p>intensity you want. So you have this incredible there, you know, variation, you could have an</p>
<p>edible that&rsquo;s, you know, got one milligram of THC, you got one that has 100, or you could have a</p>
<p>pack of edibles. And you see this happen in the news all the time, some kid gets their parents</p>
<p>pack or somebody gives one, and the kids don&rsquo;t know. And this dabbing phenomenon combined with</p>
<p>dabbing is like the shards like this really intense stuff. Combined with the edibles is</p>
<p>really the issue and the labeling of them. So you got to be incredibly careful with this. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good for kids, it screws up their brains. And so yeah, be very careful. I have a zero tolerance</p>
<p>policy on this stuff. I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s legal or illegal. Like I don&rsquo;t want my kids touching any</p>
<p>of this stuff until it&rsquo;s not for kids, obviously. Yeah. But you also should not until they&rsquo;re until</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re 35 or 40. And even then I hope they never do it. But But I need some help. And I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only parent that&rsquo;s asking you can&rsquo;t have this stuff be available effectively sold like in</p>
<p>a convenience store. No, no, that&rsquo;s not gonna happen where there isn&rsquo;t even labeling at least</p>
<p>like cigarettes are labeled. It&rsquo;s very clear how bad this stuff is for you. Or do you guys have</p>
<p>any feedback on the job report or anything? They&rsquo;re all going away when when the when the AI wins?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why I brought it up is like, we&rsquo;re now going to see a potential, you know, a situation</p>
<p>where jobs go away. And a lot of the stuff like even developers, right? Don&rsquo;t you think Freeberg</p>
<p>developers are going to start development tasks? No, I designed tasks going to be AI based.</p>
<p>Everyone assumes a static lump of work. I think what happens particularly in things like developer</p>
<p>tools, is the developer can do so much more. And then we generate so much more output. And so the</p>
<p>overall productivity goes up, not down. So it&rsquo;s pretty exciting as these. And remember, like,</p>
<p>like we were talking on the AMA the other night, Adobe Photoshop was a tool for photographers.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t have to take the perfect photograph and then print it. You could, you know, you could</p>
<p>use the software to improve the quality of your photograph. And I think that that&rsquo;s what we see</p>
<p>happening with all software in the creative process is it helps people do more than they</p>
<p>realize they could do before. And that&rsquo;s pretty powerful. And it opens up all these new avenues of</p>
<p>interest and things we&rsquo;re not even imagining today. Alright, so SCOTUS is going to hear two</p>
<p>cases for section 230. The family of no Hema Gonzalez, a 23 year old American college student</p>
<p>who was killed in an ISIS terrorist attack in Paris back in 2015. Remember those horrible tax</p>
<p>is claiming that YouTube helped and aided and abetted ISIS. The family&rsquo;s argument is YouTube&rsquo;s</p>
<p>algorithm was recommending videos that make it that makes it a publisher of content. As you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s section 230 common carrier. If you make editorial decisions, if you promote certain</p>
<p>content, you lose your 230 protections. In court papers filed in 2016, they said the company quote,</p>
<p>no only permitted ISIS to post on YouTube hundreds of radicalizing videos inciting violence, which</p>
<p>helped the group recruit, including some who were actually involved in the terrorist attack. So they</p>
<p>have made that connection. Well, look, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s be honest, we can we can we can put a pin in this</p>
<p>thing. Because I think it would be shocking to me if this current SCOTUS all of a sudden found it</p>
<p>in the cockles of their heart to protect big tech. I mean, they&rsquo;ve dismantled a lot of other stuff</p>
<p>that I think is a lot more controversial than this. And so you know, we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve basically</p>
<p>looked at gun laws, we&rsquo;ve looked at affirmative action, we&rsquo;ve looked at abortion rights, sorry,</p>
<p>well, I mean, I think as we&rsquo;ve said, I think we all know where that die is, unfortunately going</p>
<p>to get cast. So to me, it just seems like this could be an interesting case where it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>nine zero in favor for complete for completely different sets of reasons. I mean, if you think</p>
<p>of the liberal left part of the court, they have their own reasons for saying that there are 230</p>
<p>protections for big tech. And if you look at the far right, or the right leaning parts members of</p>
<p>this of SCOTUS, they have they have another set of do you think you&rsquo;re gonna make a political</p>
<p>decision not illegal? No, but even even in their politics, they actually end up in the same place,</p>
<p>they both don&rsquo;t want the protections, but for different reasons. So there&rsquo;s a reasonable</p>
<p>outcome here where, you know, Roberts is gonna have a really interesting time trying to pick</p>
<p>who writes the majority opinion. There was a related case in the Fifth Circuit in Texas,</p>
<p>where do you guys see this Fifth Circuit decision, where Texas passed a law imposing</p>
<p>common carrier restrictions on social media companies, the idea being that social media</p>
<p>companies need to operate like phone companies, and they can&rsquo;t just arbitrarily deny you service or</p>
<p>deny you access to the platform. And the argument why previously that had been viewed actually as</p>
<p>unconstitutional was this idea of compelled speech that you can&rsquo;t compel a corporation to</p>
<p>support speech that they don&rsquo;t want to because that was a violation of their own First Amendment</p>
<p>rights. And what the First, the Fifth Circuit said is no, that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. Facebook or</p>
<p>Twitter can still advocate for whatever speech they want as a corporation. But as a platform,</p>
<p>they if Texas requires them to not discriminate against people on the basis of viewpoint,</p>
<p>then Texas has the right to impose that because that doesn&rsquo;t, their quote was that does not chill</p>
<p>speech. If anything, it chills censorship. So what&rsquo;s the right legal decision here in your</p>
<p>mind, putting aside politics, if you can, for a moment, putting on your legal hat,</p>
<p>what is the right thing for society? What is the right legal issue around section 230,</p>
<p>specifically in the YouTube case? And just generally, should we look at YouTube? Should</p>
<p>we look at a blogging platform like medium or blogger? Twitter? Should we look at those as</p>
<p>common carrier? And they&rsquo;re not responsible for what you publish on them. Obviously,</p>
<p>they have to take stuff down if it breaks our terms of service, etc. Or if it&rsquo;s illegal,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made the case before that I do think that common carrier requirements should apply</p>
<p>on some level of the stack to protect the rights of ordinary Americans to have their speech in the</p>
<p>face of these giant monopolies, which could otherwise deplatform them for arbitrary reasons.</p>
<p>Just to, you know, just explain this a little bit. So historically, there was always a debate between</p>
<p>so called positive rights and negative rights. So where the United States start off as a country</p>
<p>was with this idea of negative rights, that what a right meant is that you&rsquo;d be protected from the</p>
<p>government taking some action against you. And if you look at the Bill of Rights, you know,</p>
<p>the original rights are all about protecting the citizen against intrusion on their liberty</p>
<p>by a state or by the federal government. In other words, Congress shall make no law,</p>
<p>it was always a restriction. So the right was negative, and it wasn&rsquo;t sort of positively</p>
<p>enforced. And then with the progressive era, you started seeing, you know, more progressive rights,</p>
<p>like, for example, American citizens should have the right to healthcare, right? That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>protecting you from the government. That&rsquo;s saying that the government can be used to give you a</p>
<p>right that you didn&rsquo;t otherwise have. And so that was sort of the big progressive revolution.</p>
<p>My take on it is I actually think that the problem we have in our society right now</p>
<p>is that free speech is only a negative right. It&rsquo;s not a positive right. I think it actually</p>
<p>needs to be a positive right. I&rsquo;m embracing a more progressive version of rights, but on behalf of</p>
<p>sort of this original negative right. So and the reason is because the town square got privatized,</p>
<p>right? I mean, you used to be able to go anywhere in this country, there&rsquo;d be a multiplicity of</p>
<p>town squares, anyone could pull out their soapbox, draw a crowd, they could listen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how speech occurs anymore. It&rsquo;s not on public land or public spaces. The way that</p>
<p>speech political speech, especially occurs today, is in these giant social networks that are that</p>
<p>have giant network effects, and are basically monopolies. So if you don&rsquo;t protect the right</p>
<p>to free speech in a positive way, it no longer exists. So you not only believe Wow, that YouTube</p>
<p>should keep its section 230. You believe they YouTube shouldn&rsquo;t be able to D platform as a</p>
<p>private company. You know, Alex Jones as but one example, they should have their free speech rights,</p>
<p>and we should lean on that side of forcing YouTube to put Alex Jones or Twitter to put</p>
<p>Trump back on the platform side your position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the Constitution requires YouTube to do anything. What I&rsquo;m saying is that</p>
<p>if a state like Texas or if the federal government wants to pass a law saying that YouTube, if you</p>
<p>are say of a certain size, you&rsquo;re a social network of a certain size, you have monopoly network</p>
<p>effects, I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily apply this to all the little guys. But for those big monopolies,</p>
<p>we know who they are. If the if the federal government or state wanted to say that they</p>
<p>are required to be a common carrier, and they cannot discriminate against certain viewpoints,</p>
<p>I think the government should be allowed to do that because it furthers a positive right.</p>
<p>Historically, they&rsquo;ve not been able to do that because of this idea, because this idea of</p>
<p>compelled speech, meaning that it would infringe on YouTube speech rights. I don&rsquo;t think it would,</p>
<p>I mean, Google and YouTube can advocate for whatever positions they want, they can produce</p>
<p>whatever content they want. Yeah, but but the point that I think section 230 kind of makes</p>
<p>this point as well, is that they are platforms, they&rsquo;re distribution platforms, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>publishers. So if they want, so especially if they want section 230 protection, they should</p>
<p>not be engaging in viewpoint discrimination. So now there is a rub here. Can I just say,</p>
<p>can I just say, go ahead your explanation, David, your explanation that you just gave before</p>
<p>was so excellent. Thank you, that it allows me to understand it even more clearly. That was really</p>
<p>so trim off. Do you think the algorithm is an act of editorialization? Yes, yes, yes, yes. And so</p>
<p>then should YouTube look guys, at the end of the day, let me let me break down an algorithm for you.</p>
<p>Okay, effectively, it is a mathematical equation of variables and weights.</p>
<p>An editor 50 years ago was somebody who had that equation of variables and weights in his or her</p>
<p>mind. Okay. And so all we did was we translated, again, this multimodal model that was in somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brain into a model that&rsquo;s mathematical, that sits in code. You&rsquo;re talking about the front page and</p>
<p>I think New York Times Yeah, and I think it&rsquo;s a fake leaf to say that because there is not an</p>
<p>individual person who writes point two in front of this one variable and point eight in front of the</p>
<p>other, that all of a sudden that this isn&rsquo;t editorial decision making is wrong, we need to</p>
<p>understand the current moment in which we live, which is that these computers are thinking actively</p>
<p>for us, they&rsquo;re providing this, you know, computationally intensive decision making and</p>
<p>reasoning. And I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s pretty ridiculous to assume that that isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when you go to Google, and you search for, you know, Michael Jordan, we know what the</p>
<p>right Michael Jordan is, because it&rsquo;s reasoned, there is an algorithm that is doing that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making an editorial decision around what the right answer is, they have deemed it to be right.</p>
<p>And that is just true. And so I think we need to acknowledge that, because I think it allows us,</p>
<p>at least to be in a position to rewrite these laws through the lens of the 21st century.</p>
<p>And we need to update our understanding for how the world works today.</p>
<p>And you know, Chamath, there&rsquo;s such an easy way to do this. If you&rsquo;re tick tock, if you&rsquo;re YouTube,</p>
<p>if you want section 230, if you want to have common carrier and not be responsible, what&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>when a user signs up, it should give them the option, would you like to turn on an algorithm,</p>
<p>here are a series of algorithms, which you could turn on, you could bring your own algorithm,</p>
<p>you could write your own algorithm with a bunch of sliders, or here are ones that other users</p>
<p>and services provide, like an app store. So you Chamath could pick one for your family,</p>
<p>your kids, that would be I want one that&rsquo;s leaning towards education and takes out conspiracy</p>
<p>theories takes out cannabis use takes out this one. It&rsquo;s a wonderful what you&rsquo;re saying is so</p>
<p>wonderful. Because for example, like, you know, this organization, common sense media,</p>
<p>yes, I love that website. Every time I put in a movie, I put common sense media decide if we</p>
<p>should watch it. Or like an I use it a lot for apps, because they&rsquo;re pretty good at just telling</p>
<p>you which which apps are reasonable and unreasonable. But you know, if common sense media</p>
<p>could raise a little bit more money and create an algorithm that would help filter stories in</p>
<p>tick tock for my kids, I&rsquo;d be more likely to give my kids tick tock when they turn 14. Right now,</p>
<p>I know that they&rsquo;re going to sneak it by going to YouTube and looking at YouTube shorts and all</p>
<p>these other things, because I cannot control that algorithm. And it does worry me what kind</p>
<p>of content that they&rsquo;re getting access to. And you could do this, by the way, Chamath on the</p>
<p>operating system level or on the router level in your house, you could say I want the common</p>
<p>sense algorithm, I will pay $25 a month $100 a year for it, we are put it on your side, and then</p>
<p>any IP that goes through it would be programmed properly. I want less violence, I want less sex,</p>
<p>you know, whatever I think we are as a society sophisticated enough now, yes, to have these</p>
<p>controls. And so I think we need them. And so I think we do need to have the right observation</p>
<p>of the current state of play. Friedberg, where do you sit on this? Do you think the algorithm</p>
<p>should be? I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t really have 230. Yeah, I, I don&rsquo;t fully agree with sex on</p>
<p>the monopolistic assumption. I think that there are packet, I think that there are other places</p>
<p>to access content. And I think that there is still a free market to compete. And it is possible to</p>
<p>compete. I think that we saw this happen with Tick Tock, we saw it happen with Instagram,</p>
<p>we saw it happen with YouTube, competing against Google Video and Microsoft Video. Prior to that,</p>
<p>there has been a very significant battle for the attention of kind of being the next gen of media</p>
<p>businesses. And we have seen Spotify compete, and we&rsquo;re seeing Spotify continue to be challenged by</p>
<p>emerging competitors. So I don&rsquo;t buy the assumption that these are built in monopolies. And therefore</p>
<p>it allows some regulatory process to come in and say, hey, free speech needs to be actively</p>
<p>enforced because they&rsquo;re monopolies. This isn&rsquo;t like when utilities laid power lines, and sewer</p>
<p>lines and and trains across the country. And they had a physical monopoly on being able to access</p>
<p>and move goods and services. The internet is still thank God knock on wood open. And the ability for</p>
<p>anyone to build a competing service is still possible. And there is a lot of money that would</p>
<p>love to disrupt these businesses that is actively doing it. And I think every day, look at how big</p>
<p>Tick Tock has gotten, it is bigger than YouTube almost, or will be soon. And there is a competition</p>
<p>that happens. And because of that competition, I think that the the market will ultimately choose</p>
<p>where they want to get their content from and how they want to consume it. And I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>the government should play a role. sacks rebuttal to that you buy that? Well, so not all these</p>
<p>companies are monopolies. But I think they act in a monopolistic way with respect to restricting</p>
<p>free speech, which is they act as a cartel, they all share, like best practices with each other</p>
<p>on how to restrict speech. And we saw the the watershed here was there when Trump was thrown</p>
<p>off. First, Twitter made the decision. You know, Jack, I don&rsquo;t know if it was Jack, but basically,</p>
<p>the company,</p>
<p>Jack said it wasn&rsquo;t him. Actually, he said it was the woman who was running it specifically.</p>
<p>Jack later said it was a mistake for that. Yeah, yeah, Jack actually said it was a mistake. But</p>
<p>in any event, Twitter did it first. And then all the other companies followed suit. I mean,</p>
<p>even like Pinterest and Okta, and Snapchat, like officially</p>
<p>Facebook, YouTube, everybody.</p>
<p>But Trump was actually on Facebook, he wasn&rsquo;t on all these other companies, they still threw him</p>
<p>off. So they all copy each other. And Jack actually said that in his comments where he</p>
<p>said it was a mistake. He said he didn&rsquo;t realize the way in which Twitter&rsquo;s action would actually</p>
<p>cascade. He said that he thought originally that the action was okay, because it was just Twitter</p>
<p>deciding to take away Trump&rsquo;s right to free speech. But he could still go to all these</p>
<p>other companies. And then all these other companies, basically, you know, they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>subject to the same political forces. The leadership of these companies are all sort of,</p>
<p>they all drink from the same monocultural fountain. They all have the same political biases,</p>
<p>the polls show this. So the problem with Freeberg is, yeah, I agree, a bunch of these companies</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t quite monopolies, but they all act the same way. I hate to say it, but I agree with you,</p>
<p>Jack. I&rsquo;m agreeing with you. Yeah, the collective effect is of a speech cartel. So the question is,</p>
<p>how do you protect the rights of Americans to free speech in the face of a speech cartel that</p>
<p>wants to basically block them? Go ahead, Freeberg respond. Here&rsquo;s my argument. My argument is that</p>
<p>these are not public service providers, they&rsquo;re private service providers, and the market is</p>
<p>telling them what to do. The market is saying, and I think, I think that the pressure that was</p>
<p>felt by these folks was that so many consumers were pissed off that they were letting Trump</p>
<p>rail on or they were pissed off about Jan six, they were pissed off about whatever,</p>
<p>whatever the current fat is, the trend is, they respond to the market. And they say, you know</p>
<p>what, this is cross the line. And this was the case on public television, when nudity came out,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, Okay, you know what, we need to take that off the TV, we need to because the</p>
<p>market is telling us they&rsquo;re going to boycott us. And I think that there&rsquo;s a market pressure here</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re ignoring, that is actually pretty, pretty relevant, that as a private service</p>
<p>provider, if they&rsquo;re going to lose half their audience, because people are pissed about one or</p>
<p>two pieces of content showing up that they&rsquo;re acting in the best interest of their shareholders</p>
<p>and in the best interest of their platform, they&rsquo;re not acting as a public service.</p>
<p>Look, I love market forces as much as the next libertarian. But I just think that fundamentally,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just not what&rsquo;s going on here. This has nothing to do with market forces as everything</p>
<p>to do with political forces. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving this. Look, do you think the average</p>
<p>consumer, the average user of PayPal is demanding that they engage in all these restrictive policies,</p>
<p>throwing off all these accounts who have the wrong viewpoints? No, that has nothing to do with</p>
<p>that has to do with the vocal minority. It&rsquo;s a small number of people who are political activists</p>
<p>who work at these companies and create pressure from below. It&rsquo;s also the people from outside,</p>
<p>the activists who create these boycott campaigns and pressure from outside. And then it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>people on Capitol Hill who have the same ideology who basically create threats from above.</p>
<p>So these companies are under enormous pressure from above, below, and sideways. And it&rsquo;s 100%</p>
<p>political. Hold on, it&rsquo;s not about maximizing profits. I think it&rsquo;s about maximizing</p>
<p>political outcomes. That is what the American people need to be protected from.</p>
<p>Now, I will add one nuance to my theory, though, which is, I&rsquo;m not sure what level of the stack</p>
<p>we should declare to be common carrier. So in other words, you may be right, actually,</p>
<p>that at the level of YouTube or Twitter or Facebook, maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t make them common</p>
<p>carrier. And I&rsquo;ll tell you why, because just to take the other side of the argument for a second,</p>
<p>which is, because those companies do have legitimate reasons to take down some content.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the way they do it, but I do not want to see bots on there. I do not want to see</p>
<p>fake accounts. And I actually don&rsquo;t want to see truly hateful speech or harassment.</p>
<p>And the problem is, I do worry that if you subject them to common carrier,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t actually be able to engage in, let&rsquo;s say, legitimate curation of their social networks.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>However, so there&rsquo;s a real debate to be had there, and it&rsquo;s going to be messy. But I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one level of the stack below that, which is at the level of pipes, like an AWS,</p>
<p>like a Cloudflare, like a PayPal, like the ISPs, like the banks. They are not doing any</p>
<p>content moderation, or they have no legitimate reason to be doing content moderation.</p>
<p>None of those companies should be allowed to engage in viewpoint discrimination.</p>
<p>We have a problem right now where American citizens are being denied access to payment</p>
<p>rails and to the banking system because of their viewpoints.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying AWS shouldn&rsquo;t be able to deny service to</p>
<p>the Ku Klux Klan or some hate speech group?</p>
<p>I think that they should be under the same requirements the phone company is under.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So when you frame it that way, the question is like, look, I could frame the same question to</p>
<p>you, should such and such horrible group be able to get a phone account, right? And you&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>no, they shouldn&rsquo;t get anything, but they have that right.</p>
<p>That has been litigated, and that&rsquo;s been pretty much protected by the Supreme Court. You know,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a government conferred monopoly, the Supreme Court has said, okay, listen, like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not violating one&rsquo;s constitutional right, for example, if your water bill gets terminated</p>
<p>without you getting due process. And the inverse is also true. So</p>
<p>for whether we like it or not, that, Jason, that issue has been litigated, I think.</p>
<p>I think I think for me, again, just like practically speaking for the functioning</p>
<p>of civil society, I think it&rsquo;s very important for us to now introduce this idea of algorithmic</p>
<p>choice. And I don&rsquo;t think that that will happen in the absence of us rewriting section 230 in a</p>
<p>more intelligent way. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know whether this specific case</p>
<p>creates enough standing for us to do all of that.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s an important thing that we have to revisit as a society because Jason,</p>
<p>what you described as having a breadth of algorithmic choices over time, where there</p>
<p>are purveyors and sellers, could you imagine that&rsquo;s not a job or a company that the four of</p>
<p>us would ever have imagined could be possible five years ago, but maybe there should be an</p>
<p>economy of algorithms. And there are these really great algorithms that one would want to pay a</p>
<p>subscription for, because one believes in the quality of what it gives you, we should have that</p>
<p>choice. And I think it&rsquo;s an important set of choices that will allow actually, YouTube as an</p>
<p>example to operate more safely as a platform, because it can say, listen, I&rsquo;ve created this</p>
<p>set of abstractions, you can plug in all sorts of algorithms, there&rsquo;s a default algorithm that</p>
<p>works, but then there&rsquo;s a marketplace of algorithms, just like there&rsquo;s a marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t discriminate and let people choose.</p>
<p>This is the decentralized model, like if it was on a blockchain, if all the videos,</p>
<p>all the video content was uploaded to a public blockchain, and then distributed on distributed</p>
<p>computing system, then your ability to search and use that media would be a function of a</p>
<p>service provider you&rsquo;re willing to pay for that provides the best service experience.</p>
<p>And by the way, this is also why I think over time to sex to kind of sex and I are both arguing</p>
<p>both sides a little bit. But I think that what will happen, I don&rsquo;t think that the government</p>
<p>should come in and regulate these guys, and tell them that they can&rsquo;t take stuff down and whatnot.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like the precedent it sets, period. I also think that it&rsquo;s a terrible idea for YouTube</p>
<p>and Twitter to take stuff down. And I think that there&rsquo;s an incredibly difficult balance that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have to find because if they do this, as we&rsquo;re seeing right now, the quality of</p>
<p>the experience for a set of users declines, and they will find somewhere else, any market will</p>
<p>develop for something else to compete effectively against them. And so I that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like the</p>
<p>government intervening, because I want to see a better product emerge when the big company makes</p>
<p>some stupid mistake and does a bad job, and then the market will find a better outcome. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s messy in the middle. And as soon as you do government intervention on these things and</p>
<p>tell them what they can and can&rsquo;t take down. I really do think that over time, you will have</p>
<p>limit the user experience to what is possible if you allow the free market. And this is where the</p>
<p>the industry needs to police itself. If you look at the movie industry with the MPAA, and Indiana</p>
<p>Jones and the Temple of Doom, they came out with the PG 13 rating specifically for things that were</p>
<p>a little too edgy for PG. This is where our industry could get ahead of this, they could</p>
<p>give algorithmic choice and algorithmic app store. And if you look at the original sin, it was these</p>
<p>lifetime bans, like, Trump should not have been given a lifetime ban, they should have given him</p>
<p>a one year ban, they should have had a process and overreached, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this position.</p>
<p>But Jason, when you talk about when you talk about like having a industry consortium, like the MPAA,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is formalizing the communication that&rsquo;s already taking place already happening</p>
<p>between these companies. And what is the result of that communication, they all standardize on</p>
<p>overly restrictive policies, because they all share the same political bias.</p>
<p>But if they did it correctly, it&rsquo;s all in the execution sacks, it has to be executed properly,</p>
<p>like the movie industry, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, you&rsquo;ll end up with the same problem as having</p>
<p>the government intervene, if you have the government intervene or private body intervene,</p>
<p>any sort of set standard intervention that prevents the market from complying, I disagree with you,</p>
<p>I think you can create more competition if the government says, Okay, folks, you can have the</p>
<p>standard algorithm, but you need to make a simple, you know, a simple algorithm that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you need to make a simple, abstracted way for somebody else to write some other filtering</p>
<p>mechanism and to basically you so that users can pick our users. Yes, I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>What the MPAA did was, I don&rsquo;t understand why you don&rsquo;t like why isn&rsquo;t that more choice?</p>
<p>Because as a product person, as a product company, I don&rsquo;t want to be told how to make my product,</p>
<p>right? If you&rsquo;re not on YouTube, you have you have an algo,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now saying that there is this distinction of the algo from the UX from the data. And my</p>
<p>choice might be to create different content libraries. For example, YouTube has YouTube</p>
<p>kids, and it&rsquo;s a different content library. And it&rsquo;s a different user interface. And it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>different algorithm. And you&rsquo;re trying to create an abstraction that may not necessarily be natural</p>
<p>for the evolution of the product set of that company. I would much rather see them figure</p>
<p>it out. That&rsquo;s not a good argument that again, if you were not a monopoly, I would be more</p>
<p>sympathetic. But because like somebody, somebody&rsquo;s feelings would get hurt, a product managers</p>
<p>feelings will get hurt inside of Google feelings, but there&rsquo;s not the reason to not protect free</p>
<p>speech. I think you&rsquo;re unnaturally disrupting the product evolution. And I don&rsquo;t flock. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it that&rsquo;s what happens when you&rsquo;re worth $2 trillion. And when you impact a billion people</p>
<p>on the planet, when you start having massive impact in society, you have to take some</p>
<p>responsibility. And those companies are not taking responsibility. If you&rsquo;re not super,</p>
<p>super, super successful, it&rsquo;s this is not going to affect you. So you&rsquo;re not nothing to worry</p>
<p>about. You&rsquo;ll see you&rsquo;ll see apps offshore, and you&rsquo;ll see tik tok and other things compete</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll have a better product experience. Because they know,</p>
<p>no, no, nobody&rsquo;s going to create a new Google because they&rsquo;re downranking one to 10% of the</p>
<p>search results for a great, great, some accountability. Hold on an ideal world companies</p>
<p>like Google and so forth would not take sides in political debates to be politically neutral,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not. You look at all the data around the political leanings, the people running these</p>
<p>companies, and then you look at the actual actions of these companies. And they have become fully</p>
<p>political. And they&rsquo;ve waded into all these political debates with the result that the</p>
<p>American people&rsquo;s rights to speech and to earn have been reduced. You have companies like PayPal,</p>
<p>which are just engaging in retaliation, basically financial retaliation, purely on based on what</p>
<p>political viewpoints they have. Why? It&rsquo;s not like face. It&rsquo;s not like PayPal needs to be in the</p>
<p>business. Let&rsquo;s continue this conversation. We&rsquo;re not going to stop calling it calling AMA.</p>
<p>If they can get some servers over that, or maybe so you got to raise some money sacks for this app</p>
<p>and get some more service. Alright, listen for the dictator who needs to hit the loo to do a</p>
