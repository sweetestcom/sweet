<p>implementing all the things that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to talk about</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just dive right in i see</p>

<p>a lot of quiz questions too so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do it we&rsquo;re going to get to it and</p>
<p>the first person is coming on with you</p>
<p>dr berg is ashley from newport beach he</p>

<p>hello good morning dr berg</p>
<p>good morning</p>
<p>he was lying about the 14 kids</p>
<p>i was wondering that&rsquo;s a lot of kids</p>
<p>i have four though one two and a half</p>
<p>four and fourteen so lots going on</p>
<p>business i have a very stressful life</p>
<p>um but my question is my husband and i</p>
<p>started healthy keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>uh back in mid-february</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve lost 20 pounds</p>
<p>maybe a little bit more and i&rsquo;ve pretty</p>
<p>much completely</p>
<p>plateaued</p>
<p>for the past</p>
<p>at least</p>
<p>couple months</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been trying different things and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m kind of stuck so i</p>
<p>was hopeful that maybe you could help me</p>
<p>okay so um</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is your appetite gone do you do you no</p>
<p>longer have an appetite or you get</p>
<p>hungry uh more than you should</p>
<p>it was gone for a significant amount of</p>
<p>time and then i would say within the</p>
<p>past</p>
<p>three months give or take i do</p>
<p>like i i want to eat but not like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m starving i just around my one meal a</p>
<p>day i do one meal a day um i definitely</p>
<p>want to eat it&rsquo;s not that i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to eat i i do feel hungry</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>is there um how how close do you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re following um</p>
<p>the idea of eating like a 100 or maybe</p>
<p>like maybe 80 90 or</p>
<p>where are you at with that i feel</p>
<p>i personally feel like i&rsquo;m right there</p>
<p>100 percent like i&rsquo;m eating under 20</p>
<p>carbs um i do</p>
<p>um eat a lot of like</p>
<p>i do cheese i do the avocado i do the</p>
<p>salad with every meal</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve experimented with two meals a day</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;ve been doing the one meal a day</p>
<p>for quite a while but i&rsquo;ve been really</p>
<p>you know watching your youtube videos</p>
<p>like crazy trying to figure you know</p>
<p>myself out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been tough my husband you know</p>
<p>lost all his weight um and he&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>doing great and i&rsquo;m just struggling over</p>
<p>here and how is your your sleep and your</p>
<p>stress level</p>
<p>stress level is horrible if i&rsquo;m being</p>
<p>like brutally honest um</p>
<p>sleep is overall really good i have</p>
<p>amazing energy um</p>
<p>since you know following this my energy</p>
<p>has definitely increased quite a bit i</p>
<p>feel like i sleep good i definitely do</p>
<p>wake up you know sometimes it&rsquo;s with the</p>
<p>little one um here and there but if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting like straight uninterrupted</p>
<p>sleep daily no</p>
<p>but i would say that i do get you know</p>
<p>decent sleep</p>
<p>but the stress is for sure a thing</p>
<p>do you um have you ever checked your</p>
<p>ketones and your blood sugars and kind</p>
<p>of do you have any of that data</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>yes um my blood sugars um are fine um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been you know following with my</p>
<p>doctor i was diagnosed years ago with</p>
<p>pcos</p>
<p>i did used to weigh</p>
<p>244 pounds</p>
<p>right now i weigh about 164 163 that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of the number i can&rsquo;t get past</p>
<p>um my weight loss journey has been</p>
<p>like years</p>
<p>in the in the making you know i lost 20</p>
<p>pounds</p>
<p>in like 2011</p>
<p>and then it was like another 20 i did</p>
<p>something else another 20.</p>
<p>um and the pcos i&rsquo;ve been checked for</p>
<p>recently i think it was in may</p>
<p>and she checked all my levels my</p>
<p>hormones everything and she goes you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have pcos everything your</p>
<p>testosterone everything looks good</p>
<p>got it and um and then do you um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t want to get into specifics</p>
<p>with stress but uh is there something</p>
<p>that you you can do about it or is it</p>
<p>just like an uncontrollable thing where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stuck between a rock and roll a</p>
<p>car place</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a work in progress with the stress</p>
<p>for sure</p>
<p>but definitely just</p>
<p>i would say like my day-to-day is pretty</p>
<p>stressful just because of my family</p>
<p>dynamic right now</p>
<p>we are making some changes to help with</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>but i also wanted to ask you do you</p>
<p>think that</p>
<p>high intensity like cardio would make a</p>
<p>difference or what is your thought on</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t work out regularly i do</p>
<p>walk but i&rsquo;m not like very very active</p>
<p>with working out</p>
<p>yeah i think you know if we look at what</p>
<p>we what we have to do is like i mean if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating one meal a day i mean and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it right you should be</p>
<p>losing weight obviously there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s stopping you you have a</p>
<p>history of pcos which means you have a</p>
<p>lot of history of insulin resistance and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um you know i&rsquo;m not going to get into</p>
<p>the specifics but probably at one time</p>
<p>your your insulin was very high and so</p>
<p>now we have trying to bring that thing</p>
<p>down yes and so um</p>
<p>so the the thing with stress is stress</p>
<p>activates cortisol cortisol actually</p>
<p>believe it or not</p>
<p>is like eating sugar because it it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>glucocorticoid it</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>causes the liver to make sugar out of</p>
<p>fat out of ketones out of things that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even eating</p>
<p>so that that has to be the big reason so</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re right i think that</p>
<p>exercise like intense exercise maybe</p>
<p>twice a week starting out like really</p>
<p>hardcore just just for your stress too</p>
<p>and lower your stress</p>
<p>um and actually mobilize some of this</p>
<p>maybe extra sugar that your the cortisol</p>
<p>is making</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so yeah so the the stress thing is like</p>
<p>what about your supplement</p>
<p>something to support the adrenal and i</p>
<p>think the best one for you would be the</p>
<p>cortisol adrenal support</p>
<p>that would be good i think that would</p>
<p>help you i purchased it i haven&rsquo;t used</p>
<p>it yet but i i did purchase it we have</p>
<p>and i have used your the blood sugar</p>
<p>support</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;ve used that i bought the the vita</p>
<p>uh excuse me the flakes um i&rsquo;m blanking</p>
<p>out on the proper name for them but we</p>
<p>have those the nutritional yeast flakes</p>
<p>yeah um i do take</p>
<p>i take vitamins um</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m just i just really want to get</p>
<p>to my goal of around 140 and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing so so you&rsquo;re on your way</p>
<p>so this next month i just want you just</p>
<p>to focus really in on this uh</p>
<p>stress do everything you can to counter</p>
<p>it to resolve it to be more in control</p>
<p>of it because the good stress is stuff</p>
<p>that you can control like exercise but</p>
<p>then the bad stress is</p>
<p>not like out of your control your</p>
<p>you know family and all these other</p>
<p>things so if you could just sort out</p>
<p>what you have to do to</p>
<p>kind of</p>
<p>get get to stress-free life as possible</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s see what happens in the</p>
<p>meantime you can add the exercise and</p>
<p>you can also do</p>
<p>maybe on the weekends do a longer fast</p>
<p>then maybe do a 48-hour fast because</p>
<p>that will at least something that you</p>
<p>can do about it and to change things</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>until until you&rsquo;re um that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>only things i haven&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>is the 48 hour fast i&rsquo;ve kind of been a</p>
<p>little hesitant i&rsquo;m not going to lie</p>
<p>because i do feel hungry when it&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>one meal a day time</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so if you feel changing up meal times at</p>
<p>all what&rsquo;s going to happen is if you can</p>
<p>um just not eat you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>hungry but what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>your body is shifting over to burning</p>
<p>fat to the point where</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll shift over so you&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>through a little bit of</p>
<p>uncomfortableness but then</p>
<p>your body is forced because of low</p>
<p>glucose and glove insulin to now eat</p>
<p>your own fat and that is what you want</p>
<p>to do</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re hungry it just means that</p>
<p>your body is still shifting over and</p>
<p>then when the hunger goes away then we</p>
<p>know you&rsquo;re in hardcore fat probably</p>
<p>would help</p>
<p>your metabolism too because will drop</p>
<p>down that set point so i do recommend</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>uh regular prolonged fasting 48 hours</p>
<p>like once a week i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just what your your metabolism</p>
<p>needs because of the past pcos problem</p>
<p>okay so give that a try</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s good great well thanks</p>
<p>so much ashley for a great initial call</p>
<p>and boy i do so uh you know admire moms</p>
<p>four kids when my kids were little i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>just pick one up and say lori take this</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m very wimpy in that regard i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep that many balls in here at the same</p>
<p>time but anyway so admire that and i</p>
<p>also love newport beach used to live</p>
<p>there on 44th street so ashley and i</p>
<p>were reminiscing over that but enough</p>
<p>about that let&rsquo;s go to the first quiz</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>all right what is the cause of most</p>
<p>oh yeah of the most common brain damage</p>
<p>in children</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not accidents</p>
<p>so um let&rsquo;s see see what people have to</p>
<p>say about that i&rsquo;m talking about brain</p>
<p>damage what&rsquo;s the most common cause in</p>
<p>children</p>
<p>all right it relates to nutrition by the</p>
<p>way</p>
<p>it usually does doesn&rsquo;t it doc let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>now um okay we&rsquo;ve got to get to social</p>
<p>media they&rsquo;ve been waiting over there</p>
<p>patiently</p>
<p>and jason from youtube how can i get rid</p>
<p>of old acne scars</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a product from standard process</p>
<p>you can look it up do a search it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called</p>
<p>dermatrophian pmg</p>
<p>and you have to take like one</p>
<p>before bed for about</p>
<p>several months</p>
<p>and that that seems to help with um old</p>
<p>scars and you can also add</p>
<p>some topical vitamin e oil on the um on</p>
<p>the skin itself before you go to bed</p>
<p>just rub that into the scar and it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>help break down the scar</p>
<p>and then the last thing you could do is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>do some prolonged fasting because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>trigger autophagy an autophagy is a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to clean out</p>
<p>old damaged proteins</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what scar tissue is not just</p>
<p>of your your skin but of the uh</p>
<p>the liver too</p>
<p>wonderful and ricky thank you for being</p>
<p>so patient on youtube he was our first</p>
<p>question today wants to know if he can</p>
<p>use mustard oil on the keto diet it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more available than olive oil in</p>
<p>southeast asia</p>
<p>oh absolutely that sounds like a good</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>absolutely</p>
<p>terrific okay royal in from also from</p>
<p>youtube with vitamin excuse me if</p>
<p>vitamin k2 adds more calcium to our</p>
<p>bones can too much cause bone spurs</p>
<p>no no no it&rsquo;s not gonna it&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>over you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to um get</p>
<p>more than your body&rsquo;s designed to get</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not going to be a problem</p>
<p>all right okay is the moniker this</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s going from their name is okay</p>
<p>uh okay go excuse me from youtube what</p>
<p>are your suggestions to treat leg edema</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>the first thing is potassium you need</p>
<p>more potassium</p>
<p>uh based on your potassium is sodium</p>
<p>ratio so we need a lot more potassium</p>
<p>you know a lot bigger salads you can get</p>
<p>a potassium electrolyte supplement and</p>
<p>just push out that fluid</p>
<p>but of course then you want to also</p>
<p>um change your diet because if you have</p>
<p>an edema</p>
<p>chances are</p>
<p>you may be doing too many carbohydrates</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most likely cause</p>
<p>because when you eat sugar and refined</p>
<p>carbs your</p>
<p>your body stores that with with fluid so</p>
<p>it tends to just think about um any type</p>
<p>of sugar as a water retaining</p>
<p>sponge okay</p>
<p>and so just you hold water with with</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s terrific before we go to our</p>
<p>first quiz answer let&rsquo;s take one more</p>
<p>from youtube donna can you discuss how</p>
<p>to heal from and stop acid reflux</p>
<p>usually the acid reflux is not enough</p>
<p>acid in your stomach believe it or not</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s kind of surprising to people but</p>
<p>if you actually take betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride that&rsquo;s a good remedy or</p>
<p>even some apple cider vinegar uh you can</p>
<p>get them in tablets and you take that</p>
<p>before a meal maybe take like four of</p>
<p>those betaine hydrochloride and that</p>
<p>will acidify the stomach so now the</p>
<p>sensor and the valve on the top of the</p>
<p>stomach can finally close</p>
<p>and then it you don&rsquo;t have that acid</p>
<p>reflux anymore now um</p>
<p>a couple other things with acid reflux</p>
<p>if you take this butane hydrochloride</p>
<p>and it burns that means you have an</p>
<p>ulcer so you can&rsquo;t really use that</p>
<p>approach for a while you have to kind of</p>
<p>heal the ulcer first</p>
<p>then take the acid later and you can</p>
<p>search my videos on what to do for</p>
<p>ulcers</p>
<p>wonderful okay our first quiz question</p>
<p>of the day asks</p>
<p>what is the cause or most most common</p>
<p>cause of brain damage in children little</p>
<p>kids the audience said 77 say its cause</p>
<p>is sugar 20 say soy proteins and a lousy</p>
<p>three percent say lead</p>
<p>so this is interesting because um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an iodine deficiency</p>
<p>when when a mother doesn&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>iodine in their diet when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>carrying</p>
<p>a baby</p>
<p>um or when they&rsquo;re breastfeeding or or</p>
<p>that small child is deficient in iodine</p>
<p>what happens is it really affects the</p>
<p>growth and development of the brain and</p>
<p>can you can end up not just with a lower</p>
<p>iq but actual brain damage so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually fascinating that a nutritional</p>
<p>deficiency could create damage so he</p>
<p>just goes to show you how important</p>
<p>nutrient nutrients are and um and what</p>
<p>um how important uh when you&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>eating the right things um i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just so crucial and you can prevent so</p>
<p>many issues</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s terrific well you know we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got so many cultures and races and and</p>
<p>habits and so on but the one thing</p>
<p>around the world we can all agree on is</p>
<p>lifestyle makes a huge difference and</p>
<p>evidence that the type of lifestyle that</p>
<p>you are</p>
<p>promoting dr berg is very very popular</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s evidence a good morning from</p>
<p>all our viewers who are joining from the</p>
<p>uk canada india japan netherlands poland</p>
<p>algeria greece australia mexico norway</p>
<p>france pakistan nepal italy cameroon</p>

<p>boy that&rsquo;s got to be a record and all</p>
<p>across these united states and he</p>
<p>probably had canada in there no he did</p>
<p>our neighbors from the north so thanks</p>
<p>everybody for joining the show and</p>
<p>making it such a big success it is</p>
<p>really growing our numbers are</p>
<p>skyrocketing because of uh all the great</p>
<p>content that we get from you listeners</p>
<p>and questions in our green room it makes</p>
<p>it more interesting</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t have anyone from north korea</p>
<p>this time i don&rsquo;t know why why that is</p>
<p>well kim tried to call him but i was</p>
<p>annoyed with him so i cut him off</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so anyway but d is available d van knee</p>
<p>from facebook is it okay to take</p>
<p>painkillers while fasting i have</p>
<p>cervical cancer oh gosh and need the</p>
<p>painkillers to ease my pain</p>
<p>well i can&rsquo;t tell you not to take your</p>
<p>medication but um i mean you got to do</p>
<p>what you got to do right</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great video on my last</p>
<p>interview with someone who was a cancer</p>
<p>survivor that had pain</p>
<p>when they were had cancer</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>tremendously tremendously helped that</p>
<p>with the omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids so you might want to</p>
<p>beef up your omega-3 fatty acids for the</p>
<p>pain as well as your vitamin d levels</p>
<p>to probably 40 or 50 000 i use vitamin d</p>
<p>because vitamin d is one of the best</p>
<p>pain and inflammation</p>
<p>um natural remedies without any side</p>
<p>effects</p>
<p>so i would i would attempt that but i do</p>
<p>understand the pain</p>
<p>all right we&rsquo;ll bring up another</p>
<p>question a second how am i one more from</p>
<p>youtube uh and this is a pretty you know</p>
<p>unfortunately a</p>
<p>common question that people would have</p>
<p>from a lifestyle limas from youtube is</p>
<p>it possible to reverse the damage of by</p>
<p>a life of partying hard frequent use of</p>
<p>recreational drugs and alcohol has</p>
<p>affected my breathing mental health what</p>
<p>should i be doing now presuming that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s uh cease that sort of lifestyle</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s totally possible if you</p>
<p>even take me as an example on how much</p>
<p>sugar and junk food i ate my whole life</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the amount of injuries and accidents so</p>
<p>yes i think you can turn things around</p>
<p>absolutely and at least improve things</p>
<p>significantly so um the best thing to do</p>
<p>is to start with the basics keep it</p>
<p>simple um and i actually if you go to uh</p>
<p>my my website dr berg.com under blog the</p>
<p>first video says</p>
<p>first video start here and then you do</p>
<p>the second video in the third video so</p>
<p>just to make it easy but yes um you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>surprised how far the body can come back</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but the key is</p>
<p>to start learn from other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mistakes including my own so you can</p>
<p>avoid having to go through that because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s terrible so</p>
<p>the answer would be yes well god speed</p>
<p>to you on that endeavor sir and let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to the next question and there it is</p>
<p>all right out of all the foods that you</p>
<p>can eat</p>
<p>which one</p>
<p>which one</p>
<p>causes the biggest iodine deficiency</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be curious what you guys have to</p>
<p>say about that one yeah have added</p>
<p>audience and now uh next up i think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go back to the green room uh heidi</p>
<p>has one question and by the way she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>musician so she has this great studio</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m going to reward her with the</p>
<p>best sounding uh audio that we&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>had on the air go ahead hiding</p>
<p>good morning dr berg good morning</p>
<p>i um</p>
<p>i have three conditions i&rsquo;m struggling</p>
<p>with and one question</p>
<p>so um right now i have got ibs and colon</p>
<p>swelling i have got pityriasis rocia i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re tentatively calling it that</p>
<p>um and i&rsquo;m following your vitamin dk</p>
<p>glutamine</p>
<p>omega-3 protocol for that with bile</p>
<p>salts that i ordered from your website</p>
<p>and my question is all summer i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>having a lack of sleep</p>
<p>and if i take your gallbladder formula</p>
<p>right before bed</p>
<p>with my eight magnesiums which is my</p>
<p>normal amount of magnesium all of a</p>
<p>sudden i&rsquo;m sleeping like a baby</p>
<p>i just would love an explanation for why</p>
<p>that is and whether i should be taking</p>
<p>your gallbladder formula right before</p>
<p>bed</p>
<p>well um this the factory of inflammation</p>
<p>tells me that um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s um probably a lack of</p>
<p>absorption of</p>
<p>certain nutrients especially the fat</p>
<p>soluble ones</p>
<p>so here you were taking bio right before</p>
<p>bed and i think you said vitamin d right</p>
<p>yeah so i&rsquo;ve been watching all your</p>
<p>videos and they&rsquo;ve really helped i</p>
<p>realized i&rsquo;m low acid so i have bile</p>
<p>salts as well as your gallbladder</p>
<p>formula which has really been helping</p>
<p>meal times</p>
<p>but for some reason it&rsquo;s been really</p>
<p>helping magnesium absorption</p>
<p>yeah well you need you need magnesium</p>
<p>for the absorption of vitamin d</p>
<p>so they all kind of tie in it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like a triad type thing where you have</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>magnesium vitamin d and then also</p>
<p>calcium but but the point is that um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to absorb</p>
<p>any fat cyber vitamins without the bile</p>
<p>salt so you could be you could be low</p>
<p>because if you have this uh inflammatory</p>
<p>condition in your gut your</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a kind of a dysbiosis is</p>
<p>alteration in your microbiome and then</p>
<p>also um</p>
<p>adding that that bile salt</p>
<p>helps to help the flow of the liver too</p>
<p>so you have now you don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>thickness in the bio everything kind of</p>
<p>flows really nicely to the liver so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably getting both absorption</p>
<p>and nice</p>
<p>flow through your liver from the bile</p>
<p>ducts</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>when you start having thickened bile</p>
<p>especially in the in that area</p>
<p>that can severely affect your sleep</p>
<p>cycles big time um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>and also like i think um</p>
<p>you know your microbes make secondary</p>
<p>bile so you might just be very deficient</p>
<p>and you just need to actually put that</p>
<p>back the other function of bile from a</p>
<p>microbe standpoint is that</p>
<p>to kill off microbes in the small</p>
<p>intestine to prevent sibo which is small</p>
<p>intestinal bacterial overgrowth so</p>
<p>if you have maybe if there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>going on with that and then you take</p>
<p>bile salts you basically kill all these</p>
<p>microbes that are in the wrong place</p>
<p>so uh there&rsquo;s it could be a lot of</p>
<p>different explanations yeah</p>
<p>i agree</p>
<p>i actually had um low acid or no i had</p>
<p>acid reflux in the spring and they put</p>
<p>me on protein pump inhibitors and after</p>
<p>watching your videos i realized that was</p>
<p>the exact wrong thing to do that i</p>
<p>actually needed to acidify so it has</p>
<p>been helping i just was very confused</p>
<p>about the magnesium does vitamin d</p>
<p>absorption like because i&rsquo;m taking 40</p>
<p>000 ius a day does that cause magnesium</p>
<p>to deplete faster</p>
<p>the need for vitamin u</p>
<p>need for magnesium does go up if you</p>
<p>take more so yes so you want to take</p>
<p>more and</p>
<p>you know um even i think the</p>
<p>the rdas for uh magnesium are are low so</p>
<p>um and magnesium is also held inside the</p>
<p>cell not outside the cell so when you do</p>
<p>a blood test it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>worthless you need to do an</p>
<p>intracellular so i think most people</p>
<p>need a lot more magnesium than they</p>
<p>think especially if there&rsquo;s damage in</p>
<p>the in the intestines so</p>
<p>um i think</p>
<p>anyone who has damaged intestines need</p>
<p>to needs to just take more of everything</p>
<p>and then um</p>
<p>probably be careful of too many fibers</p>
<p>because sometimes that can irritate like</p>
<p>even vegetable fibers sometimes you have</p>
<p>to do like fermented or even carnivore</p>
<p>for a little while depending on how bad</p>
<p>it is but</p>
<p>um yeah it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a very common common</p>
<p>issue</p>
<p>well heidi thank you so much for joining</p>
<p>us and get back with us and let us know</p>
<p>just how terrific</p>
<p>uh your success story becomes and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see i think we have a answer from terry</p>
<p>let me look okay so question number two</p>
<p>very exciting one as usual asked out of</p>
<p>all the foods which one causes the</p>
<p>biggest iodine deficiency and our</p>
<p>audience again seventy percent um the</p>
<p>lump that uh we have says bread refined</p>
<p>or refined grain twenty five percent say</p>
<p>lectins and five percent say refined</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>okay so um iodine</p>
<p>is a little bit different because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh um</p>
<p>there are certain foods that uh</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>that can</p>
<p>grocerogenic which basically means it</p>
<p>blocks the the binding of iodine so the</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s the worst is cassava so</p>
<p>in countries where you consume a lot of</p>
<p>cassava as a regular</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>they have very very high levels of</p>
<p>iodine deficiency despite consuming</p>
<p>a lot of seafood</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>so in other words</p>
<p>that cassava if you if you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>quesadilla you better be taking</p>
<p>sea kelp or some type of iodine</p>
<p>to prevent that deficiency</p>
<p>because even in adults it can affect</p>
<p>their iq if they&rsquo;re iodine deficient</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>okay well thanks for answering that</p>
<p>question uh folks and we&rsquo;ll have another</p>
<p>one up for you quick and let&rsquo;s look</p>
<p>uh for another question from our folks</p>
<p>in this case in facebook veronica this</p>
<p>must be for her husband i hope what do</p>
<p>you recommend to take to decrease</p>
<p>prostate enlargement so veronica&rsquo;s</p>
<p>prostate is giving you trouble</p>
<p>well um</p>
<p>the the most important thing is you</p>
<p>probably have to be careful about dairy</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of hormones in</p>
<p>milk that can affect the prostate gland</p>
<p>and so um that would be the first thing</p>
<p>i would recommend is to look at that</p>
<p>the other thing too is like um</p>
<p>be careful about anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>estrogenic like um like the soy things</p>
<p>like that avoid that and then</p>
<p>insulin is another one too like cut out</p>
<p>the carbs because insulin is a anabolic</p>
<p>hormone that can make things grow</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but if you watch my video on the</p>
<p>prostate my recent one um i have a lot</p>
<p>of very specific advice that can help</p>
<p>your husband</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific good luck with that anna</p>
<p>from youtube i&rsquo;ve purchased some of your</p>
<p>products recently good movina what is</p>
<p>the best time of day to take k2d3</p>
<p>vitamin b1 mct and turmeric with</p>
<p>coumadin i guess or</p>
<p>curcumin i&rsquo;m sorry terry i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pronounce that cumin yes well i think um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you take the curcumin or</p>
<p>the turmeric</p>
<p>i would take that ideally with your meal</p>
<p>okay so you can probably take all these</p>
<p>with the meals because some of these</p>
<p>products have</p>
<p>not just fat soluble vitamins but they</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>phytonutrients which most of them are</p>
<p>fat soluble so</p>
<p>um either take those with the mc2i on an</p>
<p>empty stomach or take it with the meal</p>
<p>you may be your first or second meal and</p>
<p>you just get a little bit better</p>
<p>absorption it&rsquo;s not a total necessary</p>
<p>thing but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;ll help you um</p>
<p>but yeah so like um</p>
<p>like the uh curcumin is a it&rsquo;s a fat</p>
<p>soluble molecule so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>with oil and health or fat it&rsquo;ll help to</p>
<p>be absorbed better</p>
<p>very good okay lydia from youtube what</p>
<p>is what natural remedies and diet are</p>
<p>best for someone in menopause and</p>
<p>unfortunately suffering with high</p>
<p>anxiety and panic attacks</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>you know i i go right to the vitamin b1</p>
<p>b1 is uh is great for panic attacks</p>
<p>nervous anxiety</p>
<p>that is</p>
<p>probably going to help you with a</p>
<p>breathing technique of slowing your</p>
<p>breath down i actually if you look under</p>
<p>the video on panic attacks there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>breathing</p>
<p>exercise that can just pull you out of</p>
<p>anxiety but it sounds like you need more</p>
<p>b1 b1 is</p>
<p>is the wonderful natural if you get a</p>
<p>natural version of it uh not the</p>
<p>synthetic it&rsquo;s just so wonderful for</p>
<p>pulling you out of these</p>
<p>this panic this anxiety this nervous</p>
<p>tension</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>more more people should try it and just</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice within 10 minutes actually</p>
<p>sometimes even five minutes you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>notice this</p>
<p>calmness</p>
<p>so we we need more b1 especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drinking a lot of coffee or tea</p>
<p>which depletes b1 not to mention the</p>
<p>refined carbohydrates we which is a</p>
<p>given which you&rsquo;re probably all</p>
<p>everyone listening is already on a</p>
<p>perfect keto diet so we don&rsquo;t even need</p>
<p>to talk about that all right very good</p>
<p>maggie from facebook is there a way to</p>
<p>shrink excess skin without surgery</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s um the best thing is a</p>
<p>combination of several things um</p>
<p>you want to do um</p>
<p>definitely periodic prolonged fasting to</p>
<p>start to um have your body recycle some</p>
<p>of the extra protein the collagen that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stretched out</p>
<p>with a good amount of vigorous exercise</p>
<p>those two you need to really focus on</p>
<p>more than the average person to</p>
<p>get some tightening action going on i</p>
<p>will be doing a video on</p>
<p>some other things that can help you um</p>
<p>topically as well</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not perfect but they they will</p>
<p>tend to help to a certain point</p>
<p>very good carla from youtube what should</p>
<p>i do when i&rsquo;m on keto and feeling</p>
<p>bloated after eating leafy greens</p>
<p>yeah chances are there&rsquo;s some gut issues</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to back off those</p>
<p>and not</p>
<p>not consume as many</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>probably try fermented like sauerkraut</p>
<p>things like that and then the other</p>
<p>thing that i found with some people that</p>
<p>works really good is if they take like a</p>
<p>liquid probiotic</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not biased of my own liquid</p>
<p>probiotic but i am but you take a little</p>
<p>bit of that with your salad it seems to</p>
<p>get rid of the bloating so now we come</p>
<p>back down to these microbes right</p>
<p>needing more microbes to help you digest</p>
<p>the fiber</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>in fact your body can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>digest some of this fiber so that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>we need microbes</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>they really help us out</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re just quite amazing that</p>
<p>they can digest the fiber but we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and so um</p>
<p>that just means that we need to fortify</p>
<p>you a little bit more</p>
<p>very good</p>
<p>okay next question up this has got to</p>
<p>affect at least half the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>population a concern to them doc</p>
<p>what is the top food for uh pregnant</p>
<p>women to endure</p>
<p>a baby&rsquo;s health</p>
<p>or to achieve a baby&rsquo;s health</p>
<p>very good okay dig onto that audience we</p>
<p>know that won&rsquo;t take them very long at</p>
<p>all let&rsquo;s go back to the green room and</p>
<p>we had a nice guy named eric on with us</p>
<p>in tustin california a neighbor of</p>
<p>ashley but then he upped the ante and</p>
<p>went to the virgin islands and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>he lives now and he has a rapid fire</p>
<p>single question for you dr berg eric</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>hello dr berg how are you</p>
<p>great thanks i want to let you know that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been doing healthy keto with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting for almost two</p>
<p>years and i simply love it and</p>
<p>and thank you for having me it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>honor and privilege and thank you for</p>
<p>all the wonderful content that you post</p>
<p>thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome yeah so</p>
<p>i have a question i saw your video</p>
<p>regarding intermittent fasting and i</p>
<p>guess i do have like a three part</p>
<p>question but they&rsquo;re all related to the</p>
<p>same topic but i&rsquo;ll make it quick</p>
<p>so my question is my first part question</p>
<p>is how often should i</p>
<p>do a prolonged fast for a healthy</p>
<p>individual that does not need to lose</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the last part of that question</p>
<p>kind of disappeared</p>
<p>oh</p>
<p>oh i was gonna no um like yeah i was</p>
<p>gonna ask um like what it how often</p>
<p>should i prolong fast for a healthy</p>
<p>individual that does not need to lose</p>
<p>weight oh okay so i mean</p>
<p>if you did if you just did a 48-hour</p>
<p>fast every two weeks i mean that would</p>
<p>be enough that would be that would be</p>
<p>hot i mean even if you could do it once</p>
<p>a month that would be good but yeah so</p>
<p>just realize when you do these periodic</p>
<p>prolonged fasting you do a lot you you</p>
<p>actually you can shrink polyps you can</p>
<p>kill cancer with it you can beef up your</p>
<p>immune system</p>
<p>you can add to your longevity um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s one of those things where</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t say the more you do it the</p>
<p>better it&rsquo;s going to be like you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>for some reason we can&rsquo;t fast</p>
<p>indefinitely that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s dangerous so</p>
<p>we do it periodically right to the point</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>you feel you still feel good and</p>
<p>you have some fat to run but even a thin</p>
<p>person</p>
<p>has like a hundred</p>
<p>thousand calories of extra fat on their</p>
<p>body so</p>
<p>um they can do easily periodic prolonged</p>
<p>fasting but</p>
<p>i mean ideally</p>
<p>i mean between once every two weeks and</p>
<p>once a month that would be good</p>
<p>yeah and then and then my follow-up</p>
<p>question with that is that do i need to</p>
<p>be concerned with sarcopenia when doing</p>
<p>these prolonged fasts</p>
<p>no no you don&rsquo;t because that&rsquo;s more of a</p>
<p>pathological</p>
<p>breakdown of your muscle tissue with</p>
<p>aging typically and that&rsquo;s an unhealthy</p>
<p>state</p>
<p>where you um</p>
<p>you see what happens when you do fasting</p>
<p>the body does um it has all these</p>
<p>amazing</p>
<p>uh chromosomes and genes that just</p>
<p>become activated to prevent muscle loss</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a protective mechanism there</p>
<p>and you get a spike in growth hormone so</p>
<p>you have this</p>
<p>protein sparing action it&rsquo;s called and</p>
<p>yeah you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to develop sarcopenia</p>
<p>at all that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you have a severe</p>
<p>nutritional deficiency when you&rsquo;re older</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re literally you know in</p>
<p>starvation</p>
<p>yeah and and then my last question is</p>
<p>regarding to autophagy and my question</p>
<p>is is that uh what specific hour does</p>
<p>that autophagy hits</p>
<p>yeah we don&rsquo;t know exactly but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>roughly um i&rsquo;m just going to give you my</p>
<p>two cents on it i think if you can</p>
<p>you start getting uh into tophaji at</p>
<p>like 18 hour fast</p>
<p>um of course you know even when you</p>
<p>exercise there&rsquo;s a bit of autophagy but</p>
<p>when you start fasting 18 hours and then</p>
<p>20 then you start getting more and then</p>
<p>even 20</p>
<p>23 hours then you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>some really good</p>
<p>autophagy kicking in there and then when</p>
<p>you do</p>
<p>like three days like you get some</p>
<p>serious autophagy so</p>
<p>um autophagy is like a self-cleaning</p>
<p>oven uh phenomena where your body is</p>
<p>like just cleaning up</p>
<p>um cleaning house getting rid of old</p>
<p>stuff it doesn&rsquo;t need getting rid of</p>
<p>plaquing in your brain and um helping</p>
<p>your immune system uh especially yeah</p>
<p>well thank you so much and yes like when</p>
<p>i did a prolonged pass before like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>listen i made the same mistake as you</p>
<p>did where</p>
<p>where i always like after a five weeks</p>
<p>like uh not a five week but a one week</p>
<p>fast and i was eating this food and i</p>
<p>just couldn&rsquo;t do it so i just there was</p>
<p>too much food i made the same mistake as</p>
<p>you did so so thank you so yeah so i</p>
<p>listen learn so thank you so much</p>
<p>learn from my</p>
<p>mistakes i tell you what our other</p>
<p>contestants can learn from eric because</p>
<p>he knocked out three questions fast and</p>
<p>kept it tight how professional is that</p>
<p>so we hope to hear back from you with</p>
<p>all your successes</p>
<p>eric on the next round now let&rsquo;s see did</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>ask this question yes we did let me see</p>
<p>if terry&rsquo;s got an answer uh and the the</p>
<p>question was for half the residents of</p>
<p>the world what is the top food for</p>
<p>pregnant women to ensure a baby&rsquo;s health</p>
<p>and terry claims that the audience 82</p>
<p>percent of them say omega-3 or fatty</p>
<p>fish 10 say foods rich in vitamin d and</p>
<p>8 say foods rich into folic acid</p>
<p>yes you you&rsquo;re all on the right track</p>
<p>but the absolute absolute best food is</p>
<p>the seafood shellfish in seafood uh</p>
<p>because of the trace minerals and</p>
<p>omega-3</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific let&rsquo;s see who</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>modestor from facebook please discuss</p>
<p>how to address chronic</p>
<p>site oh i thought it was cirrhosis</p>
<p>cytosis cytosis cythesis</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>c-y-s-t-i-t-i-s according to terry</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re talking about uh you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about a bladder probably a</p>
<p>bladder uh</p>
<p>infection where there&rsquo;s pain right is</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re saying uh i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s just what he wrote he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>address it modester just just said okay</p>
<p>so so yeah um</p>
<p>um you know there&rsquo;s um marshmallow root</p>
<p>is a</p>
<p>is a good remedy for that but the bottom</p>
<p>line is that um</p>
<p>i would i would drink a lot of water i</p>
<p>would probably add some apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar i would add lemon to the water</p>
<p>start really increasing your flow of</p>
<p>urine through there because sometimes</p>
<p>things can kind of settle and you can</p>
<p>get a little infection and then also but</p>
<p>the biggest thing is to change your diet</p>
<p>make sure there&rsquo;s not any sugar to feed</p>
<p>bacteria so you got to keep the sugar</p>
<p>way way down</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great we&rsquo;ll terry our uh</p>
<p>grammarian uh says it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a sister oh good sis titus cis titus</p>
<p>thank you carrie</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always got my back okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>where else are we uh honor from facebook</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve only been eating beef butter bacon</p>
<p>coffee and eggs in the last eight days</p>
<p>but now i&rsquo;m having pain in my knees hips</p>
<p>tailbone my ketones are high and my</p>
<p>glucose is 75 any more recommendations</p>
<p>well are you doing enough uh greens in</p>
<p>salad i mean um i always recommend seven</p>
<p>to ten cups so it doesn&rsquo;t sound like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that um and also when you</p>
<p>do kind of like just the bacon eggs and</p>
<p>heavy fat um you gotta make sure you</p>
<p>have enough bile too to support the flow</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>of of of just the so it doesn&rsquo;t your bio</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get thick and you have to digest</p>
<p>that and you might not be used to it um</p>
<p>so i go back to the orig the either my</p>
<p>book which i don&rsquo;t have around here or</p>
<p>the website on exactly</p>
<p>how to have that perfect meal to be</p>
<p>to prevent</p>
<p>some of the side effects that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running into</p>
<p>okay karen watching on youtube what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best way to remove moles or skin</p>
<p>tags</p>
<p>you know iodine you put a little drop of</p>
<p>iodine on there with a little little</p>
<p>band-aid and that seems to work the best</p>
<p>and it seems to make those things</p>
<p>disappear</p>
<p>so try that out and then</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;ll be surprised well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fantastic okay why don&rsquo;t we go back to</p>
<p>the green room</p>
<p>and parisha from virginia has been</p>
<p>waiting very patiently or her one brief</p>
<p>question for you dr burke hang on let me</p>
<p>get her up here and parisha if you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>unmute yourself and go ahead with your</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>yes hi dr burke and thank you so much</p>
<p>for your time</p>
<p>um so my question is i had surgery back</p>
<p>in 2013 tyrodectomy they removed my</p>
<p>thyroid glands so basically i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that gland unfortunately</p>
<p>so since then i&rsquo;m on centroid also my</p>
<p>doctors think that i&rsquo;m insulin resistant</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m unmetforming</p>
<p>um and pre-diabetic</p>
<p>so my a1c is normal uh but he thinks</p>
<p>that i re insulin resistance so i read</p>
<p>your books i watch your videos i got the</p>
<p>i think according to the quiz body quiz</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m tyric body type</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>my question is what other suggestion you</p>
<p>have for somebody like me without</p>
<p>thyroid gland what i can do to be</p>
<p>healthier as far as diet exercise</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the thing um if you get on</p>
<p>like what we&rsquo;re recommending a good</p>
<p>healthy keto plan with intermittent</p>
<p>fasting you&rsquo;re immediately going to take</p>
<p>the pressure</p>
<p>off your thyroid and it won&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>work so hard because the type of fuel</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be using is more</p>
<p>efficient so you definitely need to do</p>
<p>that and</p>
<p>as far as the thyroid itself you want to</p>
<p>provide the thyroid because you have to</p>
<p>take the medication but we want to</p>
<p>provide the thyroid with all the</p>
<p>raw materials it needs because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>always necessarily just iodine you might</p>
<p>need selenium for the conversion you</p>
<p>might need vitamin d and zinc for that</p>
<p>conversion</p>
<p>so that that would be on that healthy</p>
<p>version of the ketogenic diet that i</p>
<p>recommend so um</p>
<p>so you want to kind of eliminate one</p>
<p>problem at a time and i think the bet</p>
<p>this the biggest one is the insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>problem first because they did surgery</p>
<p>in the thyroid and thank goodness out of</p>
<p>all the problems you have</p>
<p>um that one you can you can live with</p>
<p>without a thyroid and do fine as long as</p>
<p>you strengthen the other areas and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>making sure the dosage is just right if</p>
<p>you could find a doctor to maybe</p>
<p>recommend arm or thyroid that might be a</p>
<p>little bit better even though they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like doing it because it&rsquo;s harder to</p>
<p>regulate but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably on centroid but um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a thought on that um</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what i would do for sure okay</p>
<p>thank you so much</p>
<p>great thank you so much parisha good</p>
<p>luck with that</p>
<p>issue i hope you feel like a million</p>
<p>bucks soon okay let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>back to</p>
<p>youtube where iris is asking are</p>
<p>cranberries good for a bladder infection</p>
<p>yes they they cause the bacteria not to</p>
<p>stick</p>
<p>to the wall so they allow the bacteria</p>
<p>to go through uh that would be good like</p>
<p>an unsweetened cranberry juice diluted</p>
<p>um yeah that that would be good for you</p>
<p>to take</p>
<p>very good laura from facebook are there</p>
<p>any specific supplements you recommend</p>
<p>for kids who are picky eaters and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like any veggies</p>
<p>you know um</p>
<p>we are uh finally coming out we finally</p>
<p>actually figured out how to make a</p>
<p>multi-vitamin taste good for kids it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>kid&rsquo;s vitamin that has food base</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t anything out there that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>food based without the extra added</p>
<p>synthetics and all that so we have one</p>
<p>that that will be good but there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a veggie solution it&rsquo;s called veggie</p>
<p>solution it&rsquo;s a um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a drink with um a combination of</p>
<p>moringa</p>
<p>as well as spirulina the two things that</p>
<p>are like super high nutrient dense with</p>
<p>flavored with a little bit of stevia if</p>
<p>you get get that shake it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>veggie solution put in some water and</p>
<p>have your your kids take that at least</p>
<p>in the meantime</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing that i i&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>would like to suggest</p>
<p>get a garden get them to help you grow</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even these hydroponic or</p>
<p>aeroponic units you can get in the house</p>
<p>and get them involved in</p>
<p>growing salad and growing food that</p>
<p>tastes really good because it&rsquo;s nutrient</p>
<p>dense because you&rsquo;re going to find that</p>
<p>when a child consumes like real</p>
<p>nutrient-dense foods</p>
<p>they you&rsquo;ll be surprised how much they</p>
<p>go wow this is very very different most</p>
<p>the foods now and vegetables that you</p>
<p>eat it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re empty from the</p>
<p>grocery store so</p>
<p>you go to farmers market you find a farm</p>
<p>locally that you can work with or grow</p>
<p>your own</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be surprised</p>
<p>uh even jared my videographer</p>
<p>i gave him some asparagus that he</p>
<p>absolutely hates from my garden</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like what the heck is this he</p>
<p>said he would eat this so um if you have</p>
<p>really good stuff you know kids will eat</p>
<p>it um but it is a problem and um</p>
<p>get them involved with making keto</p>
<p>treats get them involved with growing</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>and then um hopefully they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll start to include that</p>
<p>right or</p>
<p>have some new kit have some more new</p>
<p>babies and then start them off on</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even show them anything other than</p>
<p>the which what they should be eating and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re good to go and</p>
<p>isolate them for the next 18 years i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>being very sarcastic well here&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>isolation tip send them to the room</p>
<p>without xbox they&rsquo;ll be running for</p>
<p>lettuce if you do that believe me oh</p>
<p>right absolutely</p>
<p>okay listen uh</p>
<p>thyroid is a big topic today so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to hit you with a two questioner</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s believer and then d from music</p>
<p>to them a believer on youtube has four</p>
<p>nodules on their thyroid not sure as a</p>
<p>bored girl and i&rsquo;ve gained 70 pounds in</p>
<p>a year but my physician doesn&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>concern</p>
<p>what i should be doing let&rsquo;s start with</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>that is an estrogen dominant situation i</p>
<p>would highly recommend start on</p>
<p>seek help because iodine helps regulate</p>
<p>that excess estrogen that&rsquo;s stuck in the</p>
<p>thyroid and it&rsquo;s great for</p>
<p>fibrocystic breast problem it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>for cysts on the ovaries it&rsquo;s great for</p>
<p>cysts on the thyroid</p>
<p>so seek help</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the remedy all right well that</p>
<p>might help dee who also asked about the</p>
<p>thyroid from facebook from facebook can</p>
<p>gallbladder surgery affect your thyroid</p>
<p>what should i be doing after that</p>
<p>surgery</p>
<p>yeah because these the thyroid um</p>
<p>has to convert 80 percent of its</p>
<p>hormones through the liver which is also</p>
<p>connected to your gallbladder so if you</p>
<p>have the gallbladder out that could</p>
<p>create an uh um</p>
<p>lessening of the conversion</p>
<p>in which case the remedy is</p>
<p>taking some purified bile salts in fact</p>
<p>if you think about it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you have a hyperthyroid condition you</p>
<p>have too many hormones one of the</p>
<p>contraindications is bile salts because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to help increase more of the</p>
<p>conversions and you don&rsquo;t want that so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>really good to take bile salts if you</p>
<p>have a hypothyroid case because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just going to convert more of these</p>
<p>hormones you&rsquo;ll have more you&rsquo;ll the</p>
<p>need for medication would be less</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see better results</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s a sort of earthy question</p>
<p>and i know that terry suffers from this</p>
<p>terribly no i&rsquo;m just kidding he has very</p>
<p>good hygiene true false body odor is a</p>
<p>reflection of sweating</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see what the audience has to</p>
<p>think about that sorry for stealing your</p>
<p>thunder i read that question let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to um well let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>maybe fully i don&rsquo;t have a picture from</p>
<p>her but ellie are you on uh can you hear</p>
<p>us</p>
<p>yes hi very good put the mic a little</p>
<p>bit</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t put the mic a little closer to</p>
<p>your face and then ask dr burkey one</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>okay hi dr byrd</p>
<p>five years ago i had breast cancer and i</p>
<p>received radiation from that</p>
<p>um following the radiation a couple of</p>
<p>months later i noticed i was developing</p>
<p>a lot of deep scar tissue inside the</p>
<p>breast and under the arm</p>
<p>a year later i started a stim and</p>
<p>graston scraping which is horribly</p>
<p>painful</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen several videos on iodine and i</p>
<p>picked up some decolorized iodine and</p>
<p>just thought i would give it a try by</p>
<p>rubbing it all over all the very deep</p>
<p>you know hard scar tissue in that area</p>
<p>but now i&rsquo;m worried is that going to</p>
<p>adversely affect my thyroid am i getting</p>
<p>too much iodine because i&rsquo;m rubbing it</p>
<p>all over trying to do it maybe every</p>
<p>other day but i&rsquo;m not even sure if this</p>
<p>would even affect deep scar tissue so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m kind of stuck</p>
<p>yeah the iodine will help with the</p>
<p>estrogen</p>
<p>excess but the vitamin e is what you</p>
<p>want to be rubbing into the breast</p>
<p>because that will help break down the</p>
<p>scar tissue more than the iodine will um</p>
<p>so yeah you could get you could get</p>
<p>excess ammonite i doubt if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s difficult to do that but</p>
<p>i think the best thing is to rub the</p>
<p>iodine i&rsquo;m sorry the vitamin e get a</p>
<p>good quality one get it in an oil a</p>
<p>little</p>
<p>pearl open it up rub it into the breast</p>
<p>uh every night before go to sleep but</p>
<p>the other thing too is that</p>
<p>boy you got to be careful about um</p>
<p>doing doing some deep work</p>
<p>on the breast tissue just because the</p>
<p>trauma</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>trauma can</p>
<p>can affect cancer too it can trigger</p>
<p>cancer in cancer tends to invade</p>
<p>areas of inflammation</p>
<p>and definitely areas of trauma on the</p>
<p>breast</p>
<p>in fact when i was in practice uh when</p>
<p>someone came in</p>
<p>in a certain location i said have you</p>
<p>ever traumatized that part of the breast</p>
<p>and they always say yes how did you know</p>
<p>so um yeah</p>
<p>be very gentle and then unfortunately</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not going to get too much into</p>
<p>mammograms but they</p>
<p>first of all they give you radiation and</p>
<p>they do compression so it&rsquo;s like wow</p>
<p>they actually um</p>
<p>create crate uh three to six times</p>
<p>more harm to the breast than</p>
<p>than not doing it so um i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>not to get it but it&rsquo;s just uh you have</p>
<p>to aware that that trauma</p>
<p>can</p>
<p>adversely affect people</p>
<p>wow well ellie thanks for that question</p>
<p>appreciate it yeah or or a thermography</p>
<p>but realize too if something shows</p>
<p>positive on thermography because</p>
<p>thermography shows really tiny</p>
<p>tiny little things and so does</p>
<p>mammograph they pick up tiny stuff</p>
<p>and you got to be careful because a lot</p>
<p>of times those tiny things are not</p>
<p>cancer and then</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s if they misdiagnose you and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>they say you have cancer when you really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t right so now</p>
<p>you get the surgery you get the trauma</p>
<p>you get the chemo you get the stress the</p>
<p>fear</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just devastating and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually not uncommon so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>realize that</p>
<p>there really isn&rsquo;t any</p>
<p>accurate</p>
<p>early detection for cancer there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>test that can really</p>
<p>ultimately detect that and uh</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the the solution</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>to actively and aggressively do whatever</p>
<p>you can to prevent it</p>
<p>okay thanks thank you so much appreciate</p>
<p>it you&rsquo;re welcome thanks for coming on</p>
<p>ellie and why don&rsquo;t we uh heidi are you</p>
<p>there can you hear us you got your</p>
<p>camera on</p>
<p>i see a mute button yeah is she muted</p>
<p>heidi we want to talk to you the doctor</p>
<p>would like to speak with you</p>
<p>oh thanks i already got to ask my</p>
<p>question i&rsquo;m just listening to the end</p>
<p>of the show</p>
<p>my memory is fading doc what do you do</p>
<p>for a failing memory that&rsquo;s what i need</p>
<p>to know well steve uh</p>
<p>more more keto more fasting for you</p>
<p>sounds like a lot of work all right i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to delete her</p>
<p>catch up here okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>see if uh we&rsquo;re going to answer the last</p>
<p>question or to the fourth question</p>
<p>excuse me and the fourth question asked</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>body odor is a reflection of sweating</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see our audience what did they</p>
<p>think about that</p>
<p>uh 100 say it&rsquo;s false and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>culprit is bacteria somebody&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>studying</p>
<p>well they must have watched my video</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s absolutely true there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three different sweat glands and</p>
<p>just sweating in general</p>
<p>does not have an odor it has to have the</p>
<p>bacterial component and certain food for</p>
<p>the bacteria</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>two of those glands</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough that organic material</p>
<p>for the bacteria to to consume to create</p>
<p>the odor</p>
<p>so um i&rsquo;m going to be releasing a video</p>
<p>on that but it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>thing and then people like if they have</p>
<p>bad odor it just means that they</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bacterial issue that they need to</p>
<p>deal with more than just a sweating</p>
<p>issue</p>
<p>okay very good take that to heart folks</p>
<p>final question dr berg</p>
<p>okay what is the purpose of melanin okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that that pigment in your skin</p>
<p>that changes the color of your skin</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the purpose</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>or function of melanin</p>
<p>all right folks dig into that pam from</p>
<p>facebook what should be taken to replace</p>
<p>hormones lost from a hysterectomy</p>
<p>well um you have a backup you have a</p>
<p>backup gland that&rsquo;s the adrenal so you</p>
<p>need to strengthen the adrenals</p>
<p>and i would also there&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>remedy that i used in practice</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s from standard process again</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s two things it&rsquo;s one is eutroph and</p>
<p>pmg and the other is overtrophing pmg</p>
<p>you take both of those</p>
<p>as directed on the label and it seems to</p>
<p>really help a lot of people</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>if you hear the lawnmower in the</p>
<p>background you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the perfect timing every time i</p>
<p>do my show</p>
<p>either the leaf blower guy or the</p>
<p>lawn mower comes right out of my back my</p>
<p>window so just</p>
<p>murphy&rsquo;s law it doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad on</p>
<p>this end uh angela lee from youtube</p>
<p>would yerba may if i said that right be</p>
<p>a good natural treatment for adhd would</p>
<p>it be better than taking adderall or</p>
<p>ritalin</p>
<p>well i think anything would be better</p>
<p>than that and i um there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of remedies um</p>
<p>for that</p>
<p>and i actually did a video on that uh</p>
<p>you can look that up but yes you</p>
<p>you know the the ritalin the other</p>
<p>medications</p>
<p>uh for these conditions</p>
<p>oh my goodness in fact i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you saw this steve um</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>very</p>
<p>well-known</p>
<p>um scientific journal came out with um</p>
<p>just published this</p>
<p>incredible study credible study and said</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>they just now realized that there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>such thing as a chemical imbalance</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no chemical balance and so</p>
<p>in these some of these like depressive</p>
<p>and anxiety</p>
<p>uh states</p>
<p>so in other words it&rsquo;s never been proven</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really a chemical imbalance</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just kind of a guess and they found</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not true and so you get how many</p>
<p>how many millions of people on ssris</p>
<p>that have a massive side effects</p>
<p>i mean i mean just terrible side effects</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>now now what now what what are they</p>
<p>going to do right um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re stuck between a rock and a hard</p>
<p>place so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know for depression anxiety like</p>
<p>of course they&rsquo;re not going to try</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b1</p>
<p>or magnesium</p>
<p>or getting on the right eating plan they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look at the eating plan they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look at changing your body to ketones</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dr edes um i think her name is</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a psychiatrist and she has a</p>
<p>really good</p>
<p>um jor it&rsquo;s dr georgia eed</p>
<p>ede</p>
<p>great data great information on what you</p>
<p>should do if you have any type of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>mental</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>get your get the right food feed the</p>
<p>right fuel and of course they booted her</p>
<p>out of i think harvard</p>
<p>because she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t on the party line so but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s um helping a lot of people so</p>
<p>um i would highly recommend watching her</p>
<p>videos well yes that was big news much</p>
<p>of us have read about it and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right where do you go from there you</p>
<p>know there are</p>
<p>uh withdrawal symptoms to many of those</p>
<p>things and it kind of keeps people on</p>
<p>them whether they like it or not so</p>
<p>uh we hope that that resolves itself</p>
<p>with some new thing now we&rsquo;ve got we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>proud of ourselves because we got to</p>
<p>every question today and here&rsquo;s the last</p>
<p>one which asks what is the purpose of oh</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m sorry we already did that melanin</p>
<p>oh no that&rsquo;s right we haven&rsquo;t gotten the</p>
<p>answer yet what&rsquo;s the purpose of melon</p>
<p>the pigment in your skin</p>
<p>and our astute audience uh five answers</p>
<p>70 say melanin protects against uv</p>
<p>rays and 30 say it&rsquo;s for vitamin d</p>
<p>absorption i&rsquo;m sorry there weren&rsquo;t five</p>
<p>answers that was question number five 70</p>
<p>melanin against uv and 30 says for</p>
<p>vitamin d absorption</p>
<p>okay so um yes it&rsquo;s a protector it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>sunscreen so it protects you against uv</p>
<p>and also it&rsquo;s a very powerful</p>
<p>antioxidant okay so when you um when you</p>
<p>low an antioxidants in your diet and in</p>
<p>your skin</p>
<p>what happens is</p>
<p>melanin starts to go up and you start</p>
<p>getting these little uh</p>
