    <p>Our card this week is Shannon Amok, the 6th of Clubs from Arizona.</p>
<p>In February 2011, the Phoenix Police Department finally ID&rsquo;d a Jane Doe whose case they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been working for nearly two decades.</p>
<p>But learning who their victim was was only half the battle.</p>
<p>Investigators have spent the last 11 years since determined to solve her murder.</p>
<p>And their work has led to major breakthroughs in recent years.</p>
<p>And now, some speculate that her tragic ending is connected to three similar crimes.</p>
<p>And a captured serial killer still awaiting trial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On May 27th, 1992, a young man was riding his ATV through the northern outskirts of</p>
<p>Phoenix, Arizona, like he did on many occasions.</p>
<p>He was local to the heart of Maricopa County, and had driven to an area near the Arizona</p>
<p>canal that had desert terrain perfect for his frequent joy rides.</p>
<p>But this day was different, because on his ride, a small object on the ground caught</p>
<p>his eye.</p>
<p>And honestly, this was strange, because this unincorporated neighborhood he was in was</p>
<p>isolated and underdeveloped and known by local landscapers as a good dumping ground for waste.</p>
<p>So with the amount of discarded objects, it was by complete chance that this small object</p>
<p>even caught the rider&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>It was a thick pair of glasses with wide, round lenses.</p>
<p>As he stopped to pick them up, the rider suddenly got a whiff of a horrific smell and realized</p>
<p>that he had stumbled upon more than another piece of trash.</p>
<p>There, amongst the sand and discarded waste, was a heavily decomposed body.</p>
<p>Partially skeletal, the remains were dressed in a long-sleeve floral top and black jeans</p>
<p>with a matching black bow.</p>
<p>According to Detective Stuart Sommershue at the Phoenix Police Department, the man instantly</p>
<p>thought that he knew whose body he&rsquo;d found.</p>
<p>We actually kind of have to go back a couple days.</p>
<p>On May 26, 1992, a 13-year-old girl named Brandi Myers went missing.</p>
<p>She had left her home to collect money for a school book drive in the neighborhood in</p>
<p>the Sunnyslope area of Phoenix.</p>
<p>So Brandi went missing and was never seen again.</p>
<p>There was a massive search effort for Brandi, it was all over the news and all that.</p>
<p>So an ATV rider was in the desert north of Phoenix and that&rsquo;s when he discovered the</p>
<p>decomposing body of, at the time, of Jane Doe.</p>
<p>He thought he had found Brandi Myers.</p>
<p>Despite his shocking discovery, the man wasn&rsquo;t rushing to call 911 like most people would</p>
<p>if they had found a body.</p>
<p>You see, at the time, he had a warrant out for his arrest, so the last thing he wanted</p>
<p>to do was deal with the police.</p>
<p>Instead, he took the glasses and went home to tell his roommate what he&rsquo;d found.</p>
<p>Fortunately for investigators, the man&rsquo;s roommate convinced him to call about the body.</p>
<p>So he made an anonymous call to a tip line and tried his best to assist in recovery efforts</p>
<p>without giving himself away too much.</p>
<p>Initially, he agreed to meet officers at the scene, but then he never showed up.</p>
<p>So he did continue calling back, and he was even connected to officers at the site through</p>
<p>dispatch to give directions, but he became increasingly worried about his own criminal</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>Backpedaling in a panic, the man actually threw away the glasses that he had found by</p>
<p>the body in fear that his fingerprints, now covering the delicate frames, would incriminate</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Still, investigators didn&rsquo;t give up their search.</p>
<p>Horseshoe says that they kept calling the ATV rider, and even brought out canine units.</p>
<p>He was trying to describe it to the officers, so there&rsquo;s hours and hours of him communicating</p>
<p>with the police, trying to direct them to where this body was at.</p>
<p>In one of those truth is stranger than fiction situations, at the time, there was a convention</p>
<p>of canine search dogs in the Phoenix area.</p>
<p>So they joined the search for Brandy, and so they were called in to help locate this body.</p>
<p>As far as they knew, Brandy Myers and the answers to her disappearance were mere minutes</p>
<p>from being recovered, though in reality, it took more than just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Officers located the body around 1 a.m. on May 28, only two days after Brandy went missing.</p>
<p>But in a surprising twist to everyone, officers immediately determined that the body was not</p>
<p>that of Brandy Myers.</p>
<p>They knew right away, just based on the level of the condition of the body, like I said,</p>
<p>it was mostly skeletal.</p>
<p>So a body doesn&rsquo;t get that skeletal that quickly, you know, within a day, unless there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other means or some way of making the body decompose more or something like that.</p>
<p>There was no indication of that.</p>
<p>So amid the countywide search, investigators were suddenly met with a whole new set of</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>If this body didn&rsquo;t belong to Brandy, who was it?</p>
<p>Investigators quickly got to work on an autopsy.</p>
<p>But in cases with heavy decomposition like this one, additional exams are needed.</p>
<p>So the department&rsquo;s anthropologist and odontologist, basically a forensic dentist, Dr. John Piakos,</p>
<p>also conducted exams.</p>
<p>Their examinations determined that the body was female, most likely white, and her cause</p>
<p>of death was strangulation.</p>
<p>Dr. Piakos estimated that she was between 11 and 18 years old based on her unique dental</p>
<p>features, that she still had some of her baby teeth, and there was evidence of some dental</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>It was Maricopa County.</p>
<p>The odontologist who examined her was Dr. Piakos.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually still with the medical examiner&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>He was very familiar with this case and had worked it years and years trying to identify</p>
<p>this female.</p>
<p>He had sent out charts of her teeth to the area dental associations, trying to find if</p>
<p>somebody might recognize the work that was done on the teeth and all that.</p>
<p>Did anyone recognize it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But the autopsy didn&rsquo;t provide any additional clues.</p>
<p>And since there were no other missing person reports matching the body&rsquo;s description in</p>
<p>the area at the time, investigators turned to what little evidence they had collected</p>
<p>for answers.</p>
<p>Right from the start, Detective Sommershue says investigators were drawn to Jane Doe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unusual clothing.</p>
<p>I mean, springtime temperatures in Arizona were already reaching well over 80 and 90</p>
<p>degrees, way too warm for long sleeves and pants.</p>
<p>Officers even looked into the manufacturer to see if they could narrow down like a specific</p>
<p>location where the clothes had been sold.</p>
<p>But it was another dead end since the clothes were a fairly common brand.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint an exact timeframe from our source material, but eventually police</p>
<p>tracked down the ATV rider for an interview, even taking him to an eyeglass shop to pick</p>
<p>out a pair that was closest to the one that he had disposed of from the original scene.</p>
<p>We asked who he was, but Detective Sommershue didn&rsquo;t want to identify him as he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a suspect in the case.</p>
<p>With the similar pair of glasses, investigators had a full composite of Jane Doe&rsquo;s outfit,</p>
<p>which they released to the media for help identifying her.</p>
<p>All of her information was also entered into the National Crime Information Center and</p>
<p>multiple composites were created over the years, including a full body sketch from 1992</p>
<p>that can be seen online at thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Yet in every search, officers kept coming up empty handed.</p>
<p>This went on for years, trying to figure out who she was.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the stumbling blocks when you have a homicide, you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to, if you don&rsquo;t know who your victim is, you&rsquo;re kind of, you hit a wall.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s generally where the first step of a homicide investigation, who is your victim?</p>
<p>And then from there you build, you know, who would have a reason to harm this person?</p>
<p>So the case kind of, without knowing who your victim was, the case really didn&rsquo;t proceed</p>
<p>much further than initially.</p>
<p>Eventually, Jane Doe&rsquo;s body was buried in Twin Buttes Cemetery in Tempe, Arizona, just</p>
<p>13 miles southwest of Phoenix.</p>
<p>Given a blank headstone, she joined about 2,000 bodies buried there, about 10% of which</p>
<p>are unidentified, according to Mike Sikal&rsquo;s reporting for the East Valley Tribune.</p>
<p>Investigators spent the next 19 years doing everything they could to identify Jane Doe,</p>
<p>and her story gained some public attention.</p>
<p>She was profiled in America&rsquo;s Most Wanted and featured on the National Center for Missing</p>
<p>and Exploited Children&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2004, thanks to the progression of DNA technology, Jane Doe&rsquo;s DNA was uploaded</p>
<p>into CODIS.</p>
<p>Still, the case slowly grew colder and colder and colder.</p>
<p>But in 2011, one year after Detective Somershu was assigned the case, new resources helped</p>
<p>investigators unravel clues to the crucial piece of information that they&rsquo;d been searching</p>
<p>for since 1992.</p>
<p>Somershu, who has actually been with the Phoenix Police Department since 96 and joined the</p>
<p>Missing Persons Unit in 2007, began to take note of the roughly 2,000 unidentified remains</p>
<p>in Arizona alone.</p>
<p>And he initiated steps within the department to review cases like Jane Doe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So we kind of renamed the unit from the Missing Persons Unit to the Missing and Unidentified</p>
<p>Persons Unit.</p>
<p>And we began to gather all these cases and incorporate them into our work unit.</p>
<p>At the time, I believe we had about 125 unidentified remains in Phoenix.</p>
<p>So that was just a matter of looking at them again, reviewing what evidence there was and</p>
<p>trying to give these people their name back.</p>
<p>When I approached my supervisor, it was Brian Chapman at the time, and I brought in a selection</p>
<p>of some of the cases that were there to try to explain to him what the problem was.</p>
<p>And he reviewed them.</p>
<p>And then he picked up this case and said, you know, if we do nothing else, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to identify this girl.</p>
<p>Somershu and his team reviewed Jane Doe&rsquo;s case files from the beginning.</p>
<p>And one detail stood out from the rest.</p>
<p>In 20 years, they had never found a matching missing persons report.</p>
<p>He knew that someone had to be missing a child.</p>
<p>So he developed three different theories.</p>
<p>One, this was a parental homicide.</p>
<p>A parent who had killed and dumped their own child wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily file a report</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t want to be caught.</p>
<p>His second theory, while less heartbreaking, was just as frustrating.</p>
<p>What if law enforcement had made a mistake?</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen in many cases on this show and others, police officers are human.</p>
<p>And human error, whether intentional or unintentional, does occur within investigations.</p>
<p>Somershu says it could have been as simple as not closing a file correctly or filing</p>
<p>the report in the wrong place and losing it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the third and, unfortunately, most common option.</p>
<p>The concept of what officials call a quote-unquote throwaway child.</p>
<p>I use the terms that other people use, that they&rsquo;re horrible terms.</p>
<p>In the world of missings, there is the concept of the throwaway child.</p>
<p>And these are children who get into the system, they&rsquo;re abused at home, and they end up going</p>
<p>to child protective services.</p>
<p>And they get placed in group homes, foster homes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a vicious cycle of these children just going from place to place.</p>
<p>And a lot of times they end up starting doing criminal activity just to survive on the streets.</p>
<p>And a lot of these kids, you know, they fall between the cracks sometimes because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nobody really looking out for them.</p>
<p>Detective Somershu decided to put this theory to the test.</p>
<p>He initially gathered more than 1,600 reports of missing girls and runaways who fit Jane</p>
<p>Doe&rsquo;s description within two years before the discovery of her body.</p>
<p>One by one, Somershu, along with two colleagues, Detective Jack Nielsen and Officer Ricky Sullivan,</p>
<p>reviewed each report.</p>
<p>They ran background checks, read runaway reports, looked for criminal records, found</p>
<p>issued driver&rsquo;s licenses, and whatever other documented information they could gather.</p>
<p>Basically, they were looking for proof of life beyond May 28th, 1992.</p>
<p>They did this over a three-month time span during every spare moment they had between</p>
<p>incoming cases.</p>
<p>And they were able to narrow down their stack to only 100 reports marked with a question</p>
<p>mark for further review.</p>
<p>Continuing with the A&rsquo;s, Detective Somershu went back through the list.</p>
<p>And there, where she had been for almost 20 years, was Shannon Ahma.</p>
<p>Shannon was the definition of a runaway.</p>
<p>Under the care of CPS since she was three years old, she had been entered into NCIC</p>
<p>40 times from 1990 to 1992.</p>
<p>Whether it was foster homes or group homes, Shannon had run away, been returned, and moved</p>
<p>to a new home, and then repeated the process.</p>
<p>Constantly being, running away, then being found and returned, and just back and forth.</p>
<p>It was kind of a very turbulent part of her life, a very sad chapter of her life.</p>
<p>But for Shannon, that instability had been a defining trait of her life.</p>
<p>According to more of Mike Sikal&rsquo;s reporting, a family in Flagstaff adopted Shannon when</p>
<p>she was three years old.</p>
<p>By the time she was 12, the family had relocated to Scottsdale and had given custody of the</p>
<p>preteen back to CPS, citing uncontrollable behavioral issues.</p>
<p>You can only imagine the effect that would have on a 12-year-old girl, to be kind of</p>
<p>living with a family for most of her life, and then to be put into this new environment</p>
<p>of foster families and group homes and that life.</p>
<p>So I can only surmise that that partly explained why she was constantly running away, constantly</p>
<p>having issues because of, you know, the trauma of losing everything she knew at that age.</p>
<p>In interviews with Detective Sommershue, people from Shannon&rsquo;s life didn&rsquo;t shy away from</p>
<p>her challenging side, but they also described her as intelligent and social.</p>
<p>She was Jewish and very religious, and her CPS files said her IQ was 123.</p>
<p>When they talked to her friends, they all said that Shannon liked everybody and didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any enemies.</p>
<p>She organized the student council at the group home, was that active in that, you know, trying</p>
<p>to do things and, you know, she loved to swim.</p>
<p>She was intelligent, smart, described as very nice.</p>
<p>It was just this life that she was thrown into that probably led to her, you know, what</p>
<p>happened to her.</p>
<p>At 16, with no driver&rsquo;s license or social security card, Shannon had fallen into sex</p>
<p>work and drug use while living on the street.</p>
<p>And Detective Sommershue says that she even spent time at a juvenile prison center, Adobe</p>
<p>Mount School.</p>
<p>After being released, CPS placed Shannon at her final foster home in Mesa, Arizona, where</p>
<p>she ran away two weeks later.</p>
<p>That was on April 28th of 92.</p>
<p>She ran away under the guise of walking the family&rsquo;s dogs.</p>
<p>Though even in running away, Shannon&rsquo;s tender heart comes through.</p>
<p>She actually tied the dogs to a tree outside of a nearby store and risked capture to call</p>
<p>her foster parents and tell them where to pick up the dogs.</p>
<p>It was the last time any of the adults responsible for her care would hear from her, and exactly</p>
<p>one month, the day before Jane Doe&rsquo;s body was discovered.</p>
<p>The family reported her missing to CPS, but investigators didn&rsquo;t have access to the same</p>
<p>databases.</p>
<p>Only six months later, CPS petitioned the courts to relinquish responsibility of Shannon,</p>
<p>citing her prior run-ins with the law and her disappearance as reasons to let her go.</p>
<p>And just like that, Shannon&rsquo;s records were gone and no one was looking for her.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously this is back in the 1990s, so things are done a little differently, but</p>
<p>my experience, CPS will often, when a juvenile turns 18, they will close reports, close their</p>
<p>file on that juvenile just because the juvenile is now an adult.</p>
<p>Shannon&rsquo;s case is unusual in that she was only 16 when they closed their file on her.</p>
<p>So the court granted that?</p>
<p>Yeah, the court granted it, and her file was closed.</p>
<p>CPS was no longer responsible for her.</p>
<p>Somershu was sure that Shannon was his Jane Doe.</p>
<p>But circumstance and gut feeling weren&rsquo;t enough for a positive ID.</p>
<p>He needed scientific proof.</p>
<p>Identifications are generally made using three methods, fingerprinting, dental records, or DNA.</p>
<p>The first two weren&rsquo;t an option for Shannon due to her lack of records, but Detective</p>
<p>Somershu says that DNA was a potential method if he could locate a biological family member</p>
<p>for sample comparison.</p>
<p>And as had been the case with all of the progress in Shannon&rsquo;s investigation, officers&rsquo; persistence</p>
<p>and a little bit of luck led to the confirmation Detective Somershu needed.</p>
<p>He reached out to Shannon&rsquo;s adoptive parents in his hopes that they might have some insight</p>
<p>into her life before her adoption.</p>
<p>And miraculously, they did.</p>
<p>Her adoptive mother told him that she had happened to see some paperwork that listed</p>
<p>Shannon&rsquo;s biological mother&rsquo;s name while Shannon lived with them.</p>
<p>And somehow she still remembered it.</p>
<p>So with name in hand, investigators launched into action.</p>
<p>Somershu located and visited Shannon&rsquo;s mom and collected a DNA sample in February 2011.</p>
<p>Shannon&rsquo;s birth mother told him that she had been sexually assaulted and gave birth</p>
<p>to Shannon when she was only 16 years old.</p>
<p>When Shannon turned three, her mom gave her to CPS in hopes of giving her a better life.</p>
<p>Crime lab technician Kelly Moran, who did Jane Doe&rsquo;s original DNA collection in 2004,</p>
<p>still had the files on her desk ready to go, and she rushed the samples through the testing</p>
<p>process as fast as possible.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Detective Somershu had the results.</p>
<p>Jane Doe was, in fact, Shannon Amok.</p>
<p>Investigators were relieved, but Somershu had to be the one to tell Shannon&rsquo;s mom what</p>
<p>happened to the toddler that she gave up in hopes of a brighter future.</p>
<p>And, um, so she said she&rsquo;d always wondered what happened to her.</p>
<p>And she, you know, gave us the, um, the DNA sample.</p>
<p>When we finally got the results, obviously that, that&rsquo;s not a, that was a painful meeting</p>
<p>with her to tell her, you know, you know where Shannon&rsquo;s at, this is what happened</p>
<p>to her.</p>
<p>So it was very devastating for her.</p>
<p>Still, giving Shannon, who had been lost in both life and death, her identity back was</p>
<p>a victory for Somershu and his team.</p>
<p>Reading further into her CPS files, Somershu dug deeper into the teen&rsquo;s troubled life</p>
<p>and considered what her identification might mean to the girl who once said that she wanted</p>
<p>her headstone to be blank.</p>
<p>After minor suicidal actions and superficial self-harming during one of her many times</p>
<p>on the run, CPS made Shannon see a psychologist upon her return.</p>
<p>So when she was brought in to talk to a psychologist, I think the psychologist was trying to give</p>
<p>her like a kind of a shock and say, you know, Shannon, you can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>And one of the things he said, you know, if you die, what would you want on your, your</p>
<p>headstone?</p>
<p>The answer that she would want it to be blank, kind of ironic, because that&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>for 19 years.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have a name on her headstone.</p>
<p>One of those things that kind of sticks in my mind about her, how sad her life turned</p>
<p>out to be.</p>
<p>I think she felt that nobody cared about her and nobody wanted her.</p>
<p>That was her reply to that, that, you know, she wanted her headstone to be blank so nobody</p>
<p>would miss her.</p>
<p>A lot of us had worked on this case, a lot of us were very invested in it.</p>
<p>And the sad story of Shannon&rsquo;s life impacted a lot of us.</p>
<p>And because Shannon didn&rsquo;t have a home in her life, we wanted her to have a home when</p>
<p>she was dead.</p>
<p>In March 2011, investigators worked with a local church and funeral home to exhume Shannon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body and give her a proper burial.</p>
<p>Detective Sommershue, her biological mother, and friends from her group homes attended</p>
<p>the funeral ceremony and the installation of her new gravestone marked with her name</p>
<p>and information.</p>
<p>But even though it had taken years to identify Shannon, it was only the beginning of solving</p>
<p>this case.</p>
<p>No longer cold, but not exactly hot either, Detective Sommershue and his team knew they</p>
<p>still had work to do.</p>
<p>A killer was still walking free.</p>
<p>A few months after Detective Sommershue identified Shannon, new tips and leads started to slow</p>
<p>once again.</p>
<p>And then a new witness was uncovered who had seen Shannon after she ran away.</p>
<p>It was someone who had run away with her.</p>
<p>The person who had run away with Shannon was another girl about Shannon&rsquo;s age who also</p>
<p>had lived at the last group home.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know each other well, but Sommershue says that they had similar stories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s indications she was following the same pattern as Shannon and getting placed</p>
<p>in homes and foster homes and group homes and running away.</p>
<p>She was through some of the paperwork, the records that we found on Shannon, we were</p>
<p>able to identify the foster family that she was with.</p>
<p>And once we interviewed them, that led us to this other girl.</p>
<p>But after almost 30 years, the girl who was now a woman and who Sommershue didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to identify, told him her memory was shaky.</p>
<p>She remembered that she and Shannon left the dogs and then left Mesa making the roughly</p>
<p>20 mile journey to Phoenix, but then they split up sometime soon after that.</p>
<p>Eventually, the lead would become a dead end.</p>
<p>Still, it had opened up other questions for investigators.</p>
<p>After interviewing more sources from Shannon&rsquo;s life, Detective Sommershue circled back to</p>
<p>the clothing that she was found in.</p>
<p>Remember, it had seemed unusual to officers and the anthropologist in the initial investigation.</p>
<p>Described by many as a skater girl, Shannon had an edgier style, which was depicted in</p>
<p>photos from her teenage years.</p>
<p>And you can actually see those photos on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>She often wore baggy shirts or t-shirts with the sleeves cut off.</p>
<p>Both her last foster family and the girl that she ran away with didn&rsquo;t recognize the clothing</p>
<p>that she was found in.</p>
<p>And other sources told Sommershue it doesn&rsquo;t look like something Shannon would wear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that Shannon changed at some point, but with so much time lost before her</p>
<p>identification, investigators had to follow every lead they found, no matter how small</p>
<p>it seemed.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t want to go into the details of what evidence we have, but obviously, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s things we would look at, you know, as leads develop.</p>
<p>Sommershue and his fellow investigators aren&rsquo;t committing to any circulating theories or</p>
<p>ruling any out.</p>
<p>But since her identification, police haven&rsquo;t announced any official suspects or persons</p>
<p>of interest in Shannon&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>There are people that we are looking at as possible suspects and other cases that might</p>
<p>be related to hers.</p>
<p>But right now, I don&rsquo;t have any, you know, clear identified suspects.</p>
<p>Over the years, the community has developed its own theories about what happened to Shannon.</p>
<p>One popular speculation is that her death actually was connected to the disappearance</p>
<p>of Brandi Myers, who, by the way, her body has still never been found.</p>
<p>And both cases could be connected with a number of other young women.</p>
<p>See, while Brandi and Shannon&rsquo;s cases may have gone cold after 1992, violence against</p>
<p>girls and young women in Phoenix that year was just heating up.</p>
<p>On November 8th, 1992, 21-year-old Angela Brasso left her Phoenix home for an afternoon</p>
<p>bike ride.</p>
<p>When Angela didn&rsquo;t return by nightfall, her boyfriend and mother rushed to file a</p>
<p>missing person report.</p>
<p>The next day, her nude, decapitated and mutilated body was found in a grassy area near 25th</p>
<p>Avenue and Cactus Road beside the Arizona Canal.</p>
<p>But officers wouldn&rsquo;t find the rest of her until two weeks later on November 20th, when</p>
<p>witnesses called investigators about a head floating in the canal.</p>
<p>Just under a year later, 17-year-old Arcadia High School student Melanie Bernass would</p>
<p>go missing in an eerily similar way.</p>
<p>Her family says that she also left her home for a bike ride around her neighborhood.</p>
<p>According to John Lucy&rsquo;s reporting for PennLive, Melanie frequently liked to ride along the</p>
<p>trail next to the canal, and the afternoon of September 22nd, 1993 was no different.</p>
<p>But unlike all the times that she safely returned home, Melanie&rsquo;s family never saw their daughter</p>
<p>alive again.</p>
<p>And the very next day, her intact and bloodied body was found floating in the Arizona Canal.</p>
<p>Now the women&rsquo;s bikes were never recovered, but investigators did find more substantial</p>
<p>evidence.</p>
<p>They found matching semen samples that were collected from both bodies, officially tying</p>
<p>their cases together.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until January 13th, 2015, when officials arrested local man Brian Patrick</p>
<p>Miller that the investigations truly made any headway.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old divorced father, who local media dubbed the Canal Killer, lived with</p>
<p>his teenage daughter in Phoenix up until his arrest.</p>
<p>According to an article from AZ Central, officers caught Brian with the help of a profile from</p>
<p>the VDOC Society, an organization of forensic experts dedicated to solving cold cases.</p>
<p>The profile said that the suspect likely still lived in the Phoenix area and had crossed</p>
<p>paths with law enforcement before.</p>
<p>Officers then staged a meeting between Brian and an undercover cop to obtain his DNA from</p>
<p>a coffee mug that he left at their meeting.</p>
<p>While he pled not guilty on all charges, Brian&rsquo;s criminal record made it no surprise when he</p>
<p>matched the DNA in Angela and Melanie&rsquo;s murders.</p>
<p>In 1990, while he was still a minor, Brian was convicted for stabbing a woman near Paradise</p>
<p>Valley Mall.</p>
<p>He was later acquitted for a 2002 stabbing of a different woman in Everett, Washington,</p>
<p>where he lived for several years before returning to Phoenix.</p>
<p>While both women survived, it begs the question, how many other women could Brian have hurt?</p>
<p>How many, besides Angela and Melanie, didn&rsquo;t survive?</p>
<p>Brian&rsquo;s ex-wife Amy told AZ Central that Brian admitted to killing a young girl who</p>
<p>matched Brandy&rsquo;s description, and the story he told her matched the circumstances around</p>
<p>Brandy&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>The Myers family told Adam Bagni of 12 News they have no doubts that Brian was involved.</p>
<p>Brandy&rsquo;s sister, Kristen Thielen, said, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He lived three blocks from our house.</p>
<p>He lives one block from our school.</p>
<p>So we walked by his house every single day, going back and forth to school,&rsquo; end quote.</p>
<p>Brian is also a suspect in the case of another Everett woman who was stabbed in 2000.</p>
<p>While his original trial was scheduled for April 28th of 2017, it&rsquo;s been delayed almost</p>
<p>five years in total.</p>
<p>His lawyers have cited everything from the COVID-19 pandemic to Brian being mentally</p>
<p>unfit to stand trial in order to keep him out of the courtroom, especially since the</p>
<p>death penalty is on the table.</p>
<p>On January 6th, 2022, Jacques Billoud reported for Fox 10 Phoenix that Superior Court Judge</p>
<p>Suzanne Cohen ruled that Brian was psychologically competent to be tried, but no further updates</p>
<p>have been announced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that Shannon&rsquo;s name also comes up often in the articles and reports</p>
<p>discussing the Canal Killer, and the similarities are hard to miss.</p>
<p>Young women, ages 13 to 22, they were all found near the Arizona Canal in Phoenix within</p>
<p>a two-year span.</p>
<p>But there is a stark difference as well.</p>
<p>Most of Brian&rsquo;s victims were stabbed or cut and mutilated in some way, while Shannon was</p>
<p>strangled.</p>
<p>Whether the public is right about Shannon&rsquo;s murder or not, someone out there holds the</p>
<p>key to unlocking the undeniable truth about what happened to her in her final moments.</p>
<p>And exposure is the best thing for a case like Shannon&rsquo;s, where it only takes one</p>
<p>person to bust the investigation wide open.</p>
<p>Every article about Angela, Melanie, or Brandy that Shannon&rsquo;s name is attached to is an</p>
<p>opportunity for someone to remember a forgotten detail, or for a witness to gain the courage</p>
<p>to finally come forward.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t want to get into that.</p>
<p>I mean, the important thing is if people have information about Shannon, you know, or they</p>
<p>recognize his clothing, or have, you know, somebody out there knows what happened to</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that person will come forward and provide that information, give us answers</p>
<p>to what happened and why it happened.</p>
<p>In an effort to encourage witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward, Detective</p>
<p>Sommershue listed Shannon&rsquo;s case on Silent Witness, which is a non-profit MetroPhoenix</p>
<p>program that allows the public to provide anonymous tips.</p>
<p>Their slogan is, it pays to fight crime.</p>
<p>And when we started reporting on this story, Silent Witness was offering up to $2,000 as</p>
<p>a reward for information that would lead to the arrest or the indictment of Shannon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>killer.</p>
<p>As of today&rsquo;s release of this episode, we are proud to say that the reward has been</p>
<p>increased to $7,000 because of a donation made by one of our AudioChuck producers, Alyssa.</p>
<p>Alyssa sits in with me on all of our recordings and reviews all of our scripts.</p>
<p>And to give you a little bit of context, as an employee benefit, every year on every employee&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work anniversary, they get a set amount of money to donate to a cause of their choosing</p>
<p>so that their work with the company directly impacts cases and organizations that they</p>
<p>care about.</p>
<p>And Alyssa was so touched by Shannon&rsquo;s story, and so saddened by how she had been forgotten</p>
<p>and tossed aside all those years, that she put $5,000 of her donation money toward upping</p>
<p>the reward.</p>
<p>And Silent Witness will hold that money for a year.</p>
<p>So until July of 2023, you can find info about how to submit a tip to claim that reward in</p>
<p>our show notes.</p>
<p>Still resting in Tempe Butte today, Shannon&rsquo;s case is ongoing, but her story is no longer</p>
<p>lost.</p>
<p>And thanks to Detective Sommershue, neither is she.</p>
<p>In 2011, he had her new headstone engraved with a quote that describes the case best.</p>
<p>I once was lost, but now am found.</p>
<p>I get a little emotional just because it&rsquo;s one of the&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this job for 25 years, and I look back at my career now, and like one</p>
<p>of the&hellip;</p>
<p>I guess, you look back and you try to figure out, what have I done that was good, and what</p>
<p>were the accomplishments?</p>
<p>Giving Shannon her name back was one of the things I&rsquo;m proudest of in my career.</p>
<p>If you have any information about the murder of Shannon Amok, you&rsquo;re asked to contact Silent</p>
<p>Witness anonymously at 480-948-6377 or 480-837-8446.</p>
