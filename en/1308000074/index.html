    <p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of</p>
<p>the all in podcast. We have a new bestie yes, the filling in</p>
<p>for the prince of panic attacks. The Queen of quinoa, the</p>
<p>sultan of science can&rsquo;t make it this week. I think after his</p>
<p>incredible performance last week, and him trending on tiktok</p>
<p>with his incredible insights over sadly, the the potential</p>
<p>famine that could come after this Ukraine war. He decided he</p>
<p>would take a week off. I think it&rsquo;s just a little too much</p>
<p>attention for him. So we have a bestie guestie today. Yes, the</p>
<p>shaman of stocks is with us. He brings the equanimity to</p>
<p>equities. You know him. He&rsquo;ll bring that namaste to your pay</p>
<p>day predictions are the anti Galloway. Brad Gerstner. Welcome</p>
<p>back to the program.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me. Namaste.</p>
<p>And also with us, of course, the rain man, man himself. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bitter on Twitter. He&rsquo;s brawling on Colin. He&rsquo;s the Bill of</p>
<p>Rights from Pack Heights.</p>
<p>Sacks, boy, you&rsquo;ve really outdone yourself today. And the</p>
<p>prince of Palo Alto, the overlord of the Overton window.</p>
<p>Shema Polly hoppity. Oh,</p>
<p>Jake, are you the stinker of stonks? Oh, God, relax. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t leave the comedy to me. All right.</p>
<p>Rain Man David</p>
<p>we open source to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a pretty, pretty crazy couple of weeks here. We are</p>
<p>not a political show here. But obviously, when world affairs</p>
<p>become acute, as they have, we cannot ignore the war that is</p>
<p>occurring in Ukraine. We&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit</p>
<p>about markets. I think we&rsquo;ll start with those with Brad</p>
<p>Gerstner here, the SAS market, and the index. Why don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>walk us through this chart here? Because everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wondering what&rsquo;s happening with the markets given the war, given</p>
<p>interest rate hikes, and the repricing of stocks. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how you would look at what happened in November, December,</p>
<p>January, Brad, how do you contextualize</p>
<p>certainly a repricing is certainly a repricing, but I</p>
<p>think of it more as normalization. Okay. Right.</p>
<p>Chamath was saying it November, I was I was on CNBC talking</p>
<p>about the fact that when, when we got to a post COVID world</p>
<p>rates, we&rsquo;re going to normalize go back to where they were in</p>
<p>January 2020. That was around 2%. And the growth multiples</p>
<p>would have to come off of this historic Red Bull high that we</p>
<p>were on during most of 2020 and 2021. So we were 30 to 50%,</p>
<p>depending upon the index above the five year average growth</p>
<p>multiple pre COVID. So that just needed to happen. Like we should</p>
<p>be celebrating in one sense that that happened, because that</p>
<p>means that we overcame a global pandemic. The downside is we</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t play with artificial money, 0% rates, trillions of</p>
<p>dollars, you know, of congressional and fed injection</p>
<p>in order to prop up valuations. And when it happened in and of</p>
<p>itself, that was going to be extraordinarily painful. What I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t anticipate and what most people didn&rsquo;t anticipate is that</p>
<p>on top of that, we&rsquo;re going to have increasing fears of hyper</p>
<p>inflation, not just getting back to normal rates, and that</p>
<p>we were going to find ourselves in the middle of an incredibly</p>
<p>devastating war in Ukraine, those two things added to the</p>
<p>uncertainty, the risk premiums added to uncertainty around</p>
<p>future inflation, the dot plot exploded higher and expectations</p>
<p>of forward rates went higher. Now, why the hell does this</p>
<p>matter? It matters because when you take you know, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at that chart, the five year average, the 10 year was</p>
<p>two and a half percent, like we all got comfortable investing in</p>
<p>this period of time, the markets hate uncertainty, we had a</p>
<p>predictable way for us to estimate where we thought our</p>
<p>wax should be in our discounted cash flow models. All of a</p>
<p>sudden, that was thrown into thrown into the air. Oh my god,</p>
<p>look what we got going.</p>
<p>Look at this. Oh, yeah, never compete with babies or animals.</p>
<p>No chance. No chance. Hey, this is Talita. Talita. Look at this</p>
<p>little look at this little butterball. Oh, my Lord, look at</p>
<p>that. So so good. Saks. That&rsquo;s called a child. It&rsquo;s a you have</p>
<p>three of them. Those are babies. And what you&rsquo;re seeing there is</p>
<p>affection from a father and a child. Look at how cute this</p>
<p>little baby is.</p>
<p>Sax is like, well, this is taken from my time. Get that baby out</p>
<p>of here. So cute. So Brad, I guess what everybody wants to</p>
<p>know now that we see this repricing occur is what do you</p>
<p>think is going to happen in 2022? And then into 2023?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now multiples are now below the five year average for</p>
<p>software. We&rsquo;re about at the five year average for internet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re well below the five year average. I said on Twitter that</p>
<p>the rate path last week became a lot more certain the Fed said</p>
<p>something last week that I think is still not well reported well</p>
<p>understood. The Fed said at the end of the year, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have 2% negative real rates. They said we expect inflation</p>
<p>exiting the year to be 4.3. And we expect the 10 year to be</p>
<p>around 2.3. The reason the market exploded higher is</p>
<p>because under the Fed&rsquo;s prior protocol, a 4% a 4% inflationary</p>
<p>rate would mean that rates would have to go to four and a half.</p>
<p>And if you take rates to four and a half, then growth</p>
<p>multiples need to be about 30% below the five year average.</p>
<p>Okay, so as investors, whether we&rsquo;re investing in mid stage</p>
<p>venture, late stage venture, whether we&rsquo;re investing in the</p>
<p>public markets, like we need to know what exit multiples are. And</p>
<p>it was bad enough that we had to bear the drawdown coming off of</p>
<p>you know, this, this Red Bull high of 2020 and 21. But if you</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re durably going to an inflation rate of 3%, or 4%, and</p>
<p>an interest rate environment of 3%, or 4%, then you simply have</p>
<p>to adjust what you&rsquo;re willing to pay for growth assets. And so as</p>
<p>I look ahead, right, we don&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t know with certainty.</p>
<p>The question is, what&rsquo;s the distribution of probabilities?</p>
<p>And, you know, just this morning, Citi, Goldman Sachs</p>
<p>raised their exit year, their their exit 10 year for 2022 to</p>
<p>2.7%, and took it as high as three and a half percent for</p>
<ol start="2023">
<li>I think it&rsquo;s going to this period is going to be marked by a</li>
</ol>
<p>lot of uncertainty around inflation and rates till we have</p>
<p>more clarity. And what that means is allocators of capital</p>
<p>are going to allocate less to risk assets, and they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to pay less for risk assets. But you know, listen, if I look out</p>
<p>over the 5-10 year horizon, I don&rsquo;t believe in global</p>
<p>stagflation. I don&rsquo;t believe that we&rsquo;re in this new</p>
<p>hyperinflation environment. But we&rsquo;re going to have to get</p>
<p>through this next 6-12-18 months. And it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>filled with a lot of volatility and a lot of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Jamal, what rings most true about what Brad just said? And</p>
<p>then what can you add to the prediction for this coming year?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what the prediction for this year is. I</p>
<p>think the markets are mostly moving upwards for the short</p>
<p>term. And then I think volatility is going to come</p>
<p>back. I&rsquo;m just trying to find good long term businesses and</p>
<p>just kind of close my eyes and not have to look at these stock</p>
<p>prices every day. And as long as I can manage my own psychology,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll be fine. And I think that&rsquo;s probably the thing</p>
<p>that most of us need to be doing. The interesting thing</p>
<p>about Brad said is that the implication of that is that it</p>
<p>means that late stage venture is pretty badly mispriced.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re going to have to knock these things back by</p>
<p>50 60%. I think you saw the first real big movement there</p>
<p>yesterday, which was the Instacart print, right, we went</p>
<p>from a $40 billion valuation to I think it was 24. If you look</p>
<p>at from February of last year, which was really the high for</p>
<p>all of us, right, that&rsquo;s when we all thought we could do no</p>
<p>wrong. You know, the comps to Instacart are off anywhere</p>
<p>between 50 and 70%. You know, takeaway is off 70%. Uber is</p>
<p>down 60% DoorDash was down 55%. So these are some big moves. And</p>
<p>so, you know, it made sense that Instacart had to get kind of</p>
<p>like reset. The problem that it has is that it&rsquo;s now the nth</p>
<p>player trying to get public into a space with many players who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>guzzled up a lot of capital in a low rate environment. And so if</p>
<p>you think about company building, this is why</p>
<p>entrepreneurs have to pay attention to this stuff. You</p>
<p>want to get money when money is cheap. But the problem is you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t control that timing. And so if you can&rsquo;t control your</p>
<p>operating margins and your profitability, then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to go and basically pay somebody an</p>
<p>enormously high price to get their money. And I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s setting itself up to happen in a bunch of these</p>
<p>markets. I think enterprise SAS has always claimed long term</p>
<p>profitability. The thing is, when you look at sort of like</p>
<p>the real long term companies, they&rsquo;ve built some enormous</p>
<p>moats, right? Like if you look at a service now or a Salesforce</p>
<p>at the high end, and then there&rsquo;s a crop of a couple of</p>
<p>companies like Palo Alto networks, who are the next ones</p>
<p>coming after who seemed like behemoths in the making. But</p>
<p>everybody else, I think people have to really question like</p>
<p>where the long term profitability going to come</p>
<p>from. And so if that&rsquo;s true, then the late stage private SAS</p>
<p>companies are in trouble. Similarly, in places like</p>
<p>delivery, where again, you&rsquo;ve had a bunch of comps come out,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been curing in the public markets for years, you</p>
<p>know, Uber, DoorDash, there&rsquo;s a couple of these behemoths</p>
<p>getting built DoorDash being the most obvious. And then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bunch of more kind of question mark business models, including</p>
<p>Uber, which is not really hanging together in the public</p>
<p>markets. So I think the real question for entrepreneurs is if</p>
<p>you have the nth business, nth being not the first, not the</p>
<p>second, but you&rsquo;re the seventh or eighth or 10th trying to go</p>
<p>public, and all the seven or eight before you are gas</p>
<p>guzzling machines, you&rsquo;re going to pay a very heavy price to get</p>
<p>public. And I think that that&rsquo;s the reckoning that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to see. So I&rsquo;m really interested to see how that</p>
<p>plays out. You know, the Instacart valuation could easily</p>
<p>be cheap at 24. But it could just as easily be overpriced by</p>
<p>another $10 billion, depending on how people think about who</p>
<p>the last buyer of resort is in the public markets.</p>
<p>Saks did Instacart missed their window to go public. And then</p>
<p>what does this say about the backlog of hundreds of</p>
<p>unicorns that the venture community is investing heavily</p>
<p>in?</p>
<p>Some of them are probably gonna have to IPO at down rounds. I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s sort of the takeaway.</p>
<p>Explain what that is to to neophytes.</p>
<p>Well, it just means that they&rsquo;re gonna have to go public at</p>
<p>evaluation lower than what the last private round was. So all</p>
<p>of these late stage private investors who assumed that they</p>
<p>would always make money investing in a company in the</p>
<p>last private round before when public they thought that was</p>
<p>sort of an automatic gain and arbitrage and it&rsquo;s not and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be some disappointment there. Brad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been sharing these charts with me since I guess what December,</p>
<p>Brad, where the charts basically show public SAS valuations as a</p>
<p>multiple of ARR. And then he&rsquo;s got a similar chart for it sort</p>
<p>of the internet companies that sort of nonsense internet</p>
<p>companies as a function of revenue. And we&rsquo;ve been looking</p>
<p>at these charts. You know, once Brad showed these to me, again,</p>
<p>four months ago, it became so obvious what was going on, which</p>
<p>is that valuations were reverting back to the</p>
<p>historical mean, if you look at, you know, during the two year</p>
<p>period during COVID, the they the multiples had risen to some</p>
<p>insane level, right. And because of all the liquidity that had</p>
<p>been pumped into the system. So as soon as you saw that the</p>
<p>charts that way, you could just see where things were headed,</p>
<p>which is back to historical averages. Now we&rsquo;re below those</p>
<p>averages, partly because no, no, no, no, not really, the multiples</p>
<p>are, can I summarize Brad&rsquo;s chart, because it is extremely</p>
<p>elegant and simple for the layman to understand. So here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the layman&rsquo;s understanding of Brad&rsquo;s analysis, technical</p>
<p>analysis and, and and balance sheet and P&amp;L analysis, which is</p>
<p>accurate. When rates are zero, typically people are willing to</p>
<p>pay eight times revenue for a company. Okay, so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>generating 100 million revenue, top line revenue, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>generating $100 million revenue in your reasonably high margin</p>
<p>reasonably high growth software business, that&rsquo;s worth $800</p>
<p>million in the public markets. For every 100 basis point</p>
<p>increase in rates, you decrease the valuation between 15 and 20%.</p>
<p>So if you think rates are 2.75%, the price is somewhere</p>
<p>between 30 to 40% cheaper than what it was when rates were at</p>
<p>zero. So if you go back and you look at every TechCrunch</p>
<p>article, and every Bloomberg article, and every information</p>
<p>article, and you look at all those headline valuations, when</p>
<p>rates were at zero, we all just said rates are going to be</p>
<p>somewhere between, you know, 2.5 to 3% at the end of this year,</p>
<p>at a minimum, you have to haircut those things by 30 to 40%</p>
<p>steady state, meaning the company is continuing to execute</p>
<p>on all on all cylinders. If they have a downtick in their</p>
<p>performance, then it increases that discount. If rates go</p>
<p>higher, it increases the discount. But the basic way to</p>
<p>think about this is for every 100 basis point increase in</p>
<p>rates, you got to downtake that valuation by 15 to 20%.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, just to be fair, I think, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a daylight between you and sacks on this, what, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually saying is the 40% giving the numerical rule that</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right, that is the, that is the correlation.</p>
<p>And so this idea, listen, we all get paid to find good companies</p>
<p>and avoid bad companies. That&rsquo;s generally what we get paid to do</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re decent at it. All of a sudden, in fact, most</p>
<p>fundamental investors say, Hey, I&rsquo;m not a macro expert. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know where inflation is going. I don&rsquo;t know where interest rates</p>
<p>going, I just find good companies. We&rsquo;ve had a decade or</p>
<p>longer, where that was okay to do that was easy to do. Because</p>
<p>guess what, inflation was at two. And we had two and a half</p>
<p>percent 10 year, when all of a sudden you have massive</p>
<p>volatility in that it&rsquo;s not acceptable as an investor just</p>
<p>to say, well, none of this matters, because it does matter.</p>
<p>Right price matters, because what you can exit for is</p>
<p>essential to the game. And there were a lot of people invest in</p>
<p>2013, 14 and 15. When when the cost of entry was low and</p>
<p>exited, when the cost of entry was high, multiple expansion</p>
<p>hides many sins, right? And now just the opposite is happening</p>
<p>in a dramatic and historic way, in that multiples were higher</p>
<p>than they&rsquo;ve ever been caused by a global pandemic. And the exit</p>
<p>rate for a lot of those companies, right is going to be</p>
<p>very painful. I think that sacks his point about downround IPOs,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is the exception, David, no Reddit, I</p>
<p>think the vast majority of companies that come public in</p>
<p>the next 12 months are going out below their last valuation.</p>
<p>Yes, the Reddit rumor was that Goldman put a $10 billion price</p>
<p>on the cover. And that, you know, it effectively been cut in</p>
<p>half. Again, these are all rumors. So these could</p>
<p>completely not be true. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have any knowledge one</p>
<p>way or the other, to 5 billion. And that may actually end up</p>
<p>being too expensive. It just depends on where the market is.</p>
<p>Well, just so people are clear, when investors, sophisticated</p>
<p>investors make these late stage valuations at very high</p>
<p>multiples, like they have, they do have some downside</p>
<p>protections. In other words, they cannot lose more than the</p>
<p>money that was put in when this thing IPOs or they may get</p>
<p>kickers of additional shares. So maybe</p>
<p>these IPO No, no, in fairness, you&rsquo;re talking about something</p>
<p>very important. But they&rsquo;re very rarely in these high price</p>
<p>rounds, because most of these high price rounds are in go go</p>
<p>companies where all of those rights get stripped away. This</p>
<p>is why I do think Jason, what you&rsquo;re actually bringing up is</p>
<p>in the last innings of a bull market, you have incredibly</p>
<p>irresponsible behavior by a bunch of these investors. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also going to get exposed as well. So Jason, what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about is what&rsquo;s called an IPO ratchet. Yeah, which</p>
<p>means I&rsquo;m giving you this money at this price. But if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>IPO at this price, then you&rsquo;re going to give me an equivalent</p>
<p>number of shares that makes me whole, right, right. So it&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>if I am, I am indifferent to what price you IPO at, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremely dilutive, to really one really important class of</p>
<p>individual, which is the employees of the company. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also really dilutive to other investors who&rsquo;ve come in before</p>
<p>them. But Jason, you&rsquo;re probably right, to the extent that there</p>
<p>were IPO ratchets, they&rsquo;ll get triggered. But I think in many</p>
<p>of these go go companies, and you know, Brad and sacks can</p>
<p>confirm, but I see it, all those rights get stripped away. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like coming at this crazy price. Yeah, we&rsquo;re not negotiating it</p>
<p>no governance, you know, get get our logo on your fundraising</p>
<p>deck for the next round. And so this is the price of the</p>
<p>capital. It&rsquo;s been a little bit of sloppy behavior, just so</p>
<p>people understand this, if the Reddit valuation was 10 billion,</p>
<p>somebody put in, you know, 100 million in this late stage</p>
<p>round, if it came out at 5 billion, they would get twice as</p>
<p>many shares to make up for that difference.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t exist in the case of Reddit, Jay cow, you know, as</p>
<p>fidelity who led that last round, so they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>price takers at whatever price the company comes public. What</p>
<p>does that mean? Explain that price take? So you know, if they</p>
<p>come public at $5 billion, and you put in $100 million, your</p>
<p>stake is now worth 50 million. Right, right. So you lost,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t they have the discipline to put in these protective</p>
<p>provisions, ratchets, etc. What happened in the market</p>
<p>to Chamath&rsquo;s point, they haven&rsquo;t really existed in most deals for</p>
<p>the last five years. Right? I go back to 2000. I think 2007 2008</p>
<p>kayak raised money with a ratchet and their last pre IPO</p>
<p>round, it prevented them from getting public for three or four</p>
<p>years, that dilution overhang was a significant impediment to</p>
<p>getting public. So, you know, listen, we all know that Groupon</p>
<p>raised at $20 billion went public in a year laters were 2</p>
<p>billion. I mean, it&rsquo;s not as though this hasn&rsquo;t happened</p>
<p>before. But yes, people people got a little lackadaisical. I</p>
<p>just wanted to I just want to say one other thing, though,</p>
<p>because multiples coming down as a problem. What this really</p>
<p>reveals is the importance of stock and company selection.</p>
<p>Right? Because if you are a shitty company with an unproven</p>
<p>business model, right way out on the risk curve, okay. And you</p>
<p>had a super high valuation last year. And you don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good chance you never grow in it grow into it. You</p>
<p>never get back to that valuation example, your example, your</p>
<p>growth will decel. Well, give us an example company. Okay.</p>
<p>discord.</p>
<p>In the 15 minute delivery space in Europe, go puff. You know, I</p>
<p>would say go puff is one of the best of them. There are a lot of</p>
<p>startups that got funded with billions of dollars in Europe,</p>
<p>unproven business models burning tremendous amount of cash,</p>
<p>right? Like, I don&rsquo;t know why they need to exist. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re going to get funded. Right? Maybe one or two</p>
<p>of them do. But when you have DoorDash and Uber that are free</p>
<p>cash flow positive, that have strong brands, and that can</p>
<p>redeploy those profits back into compete in those markets think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very tough.</p>
<p>neobanks are another example, neobanks, you know, the number</p>
<p>of neobanks that have been funded at exorbitant valuations,</p>
<p>where, you know, the problem is all of these financial services</p>
<p>companies are essentially an arbitrage on rates, right? When</p>
<p>rates are zero, they take that money at 0%. And then they can</p>
<p>go and execute a business model, you know, and sell that money at</p>
<p>1% and take the difference. But when their cost of capital is</p>
<p>two or two and a half or 3%, the whole business implodes on them.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to see a bunch of these financial services</p>
<p>companies get under pressure. Another example, Jason is like</p>
<p>all the low end, you know, bottoms up SaaS companies. And</p>
<p>the reason is because they spend their time inside of Google and</p>
<p>Facebook doing customer acquisition and managing this</p>
<p>very intricate dance of LTV to CAC. And when all of those input</p>
<p>costs go up, their business implodes, because you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>raise rates faster, or you can&rsquo;t raise prices, I would say faster</p>
<p>than the input costs are, and then all of a sudden, your unit</p>
<p>economics blow up. And in all of this, what is the salvation in a</p>
<p>moment like this? It&rsquo;s being healthy gross margins, healthy</p>
<p>contribution margins, and a and a realistic path to</p>
<p>profitability, which means being EBITDA positive this year, or</p>
<p>within the next two years,</p>
<p>said another way, if you&rsquo;re profitable, you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>go away.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, if you can&rsquo;t show that you&rsquo;re, you know, to use</p>
<p>the famous Paul Graham adage default alive, in a moment like</p>
<p>this, then you are a price taker, which means that you will</p>
<p>have to pay probably a very high cost of capital to raise</p>
<p>incremental capital to support a fundamentally fragile and non</p>
<p>resilient business model is the issue here, sacks, that when you</p>
<p>see the getter gorillas zap all these instant delivery companies</p>
<p>get funded at exorbitant prices, and they&rsquo;re the seventh, eighth,</p>
<p>ninth, as Chamath is pointing out, no, no, no, Instacart was</p>
<p>the seventh. Those are like the 10th, 11th. Okay, so now here we</p>
<p>are. This to me seems like the fault of poor judgment by</p>
<p>capital allocator sacks. Are there too many venture funds</p>
<p>tasting chasing too few deals, and not thinking through what</p>
<p>investing in the 10th, 11th or 12th player in a market is going</p>
<p>to be able to do? Is it too much?</p>
<p>Venture part, I think part of what&rsquo;s going on with the</p>
<p>companies you mentioned is that they&rsquo;re physical world</p>
<p>companies, they are very capital intensive, they burn a lot of</p>
<p>money, they&rsquo;re operationally intensive. I have sort of sour</p>
<p>I soured on those businesses years ago. And that&rsquo;s why I just</p>
<p>focus on SAS, because they&rsquo;re basically perfect gross margin</p>
<p>businesses. They&rsquo;re very, they can be very capital efficient,</p>
<p>if the founders want to run them that way. So what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>now is telling founders lengthen your runway, be more</p>
<p>capital efficient, you need to understand that, you know,</p>
<p>multiples, if you raise last year at 100 times ARR, you need</p>
<p>to understand that the next time you raise it may be at 20 times</p>
<p>ARR. So now you can grow into that, right? If you&rsquo;re tripling</p>
<p>and then triple again, the next year, you&rsquo;ll be able to grow</p>
<p>into that valuation. But, you know, make your money last two,</p>
<p>three, four years, instead of, you know, burning it in 12 to</p>
<p>18 months, unless you want to down round.</p>
<p>I think this is this is the point that now,</p>
<p>allocators, venture capitalists are going to spend the next six</p>
<p>months thinking about what&rsquo;s in bucket one, low quality</p>
<p>companies burning a lot of cash that may very well not make it</p>
<p>across the chasm, no path to profitability, what are the high</p>
<p>quality companies that yeah, the multiples down because public</p>
<p>market multiples are down risk premiums have changed inflation</p>
<p>change, but they have plenty of cash on the balance sheet. And</p>
<p>think about it this way. Snowflake became a poster child</p>
<p>in the public markets of a high priced SaaS business. Snowflake</p>
<p>this year will grow its free cash flow at over 100% a year</p>
<p>next year, probably, you know, 80 or 90% free cash flow, not</p>
<p>just revenue, free cash flow. In Q4, I think they booked 1.4</p>
<p>billion of revenue Q4 on a business that entirely in last</p>
<p>year did 1.2 billion in revenue, right? You think about that the</p>
<p>incremental was more than what they had generated in the prior</p>
<p>many years, that business. So let&rsquo;s say we reduce the</p>
<p>multiple by 50%. But the company&rsquo;s growing top line and</p>
<p>free cash flow by 100% doesn&rsquo;t take you very long to grow</p>
<p>through the multiple compression. So snowflakes</p>
<p>multiple is plummeting for two reasons. One, because the stock</p>
<p>price came down. Number two, because right, their growth rate</p>
<p>and free cash flow growth is so high. And so now if you look at</p>
<p>the multiple, it&rsquo;s similar to what we would expect of a</p>
<p>regression of the five year analysis,</p>
<p>unless these companies unless these private companies are want</p>
<p>to go dark for the next three to five years, meaning not, you</p>
<p>know, no sophisticated late stage investor doing around or</p>
<p>going public, they&rsquo;ll be okay. But otherwise, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to reckon with a version of what Brad just said, which is</p>
<p>the high the flight to quality problem. You know, when in</p>
<p>moments of uncertainty and high volatility, it&rsquo;s just more</p>
<p>straightforward to go to the things that are reliable. And so</p>
<p>you know, when you think in the public tech markets, what is a</p>
<p>reliable must own company? Well, I would put snowflake in the</p>
<p>list of these must own high growth software businesses,</p>
<p>right? You know, the fangs tend to be in the must own category.</p>
<p>But then there are all these other businesses that then get</p>
<p>orphaned, because they&rsquo;re kind of nice to own, would love to</p>
<p>own would be great in any other circumstance. And that gets even</p>
<p>more exacerbated in the in the private markets, you have to</p>
<p>remember, right now, like the private markets cannot really</p>
<p>exist without an incremental buyer of equity, right? A bag</p>
<p>holder, somebody has somebody needs to be somebody needs to be</p>
<p>the bag holder after you. And the problem right now is that</p>
<p>those folks have a lot more credible, safe, durable assets</p>
<p>that they can own, and not have to deal with all the crazy</p>
<p>anxiety that comes with owning something that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>volatility, like</p>
<p>or Chamath, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, or Brad, if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to even be involved in this machine, you know, they could</p>
<p>just be in cash, and the interest rates are going up. So</p>
<p>maybe they could say, you know what, I&rsquo;ll just sit this out for</p>
<p>a year. Is that also happening with those folks? Well, I think</p>
<p>too hard to do because of</p>
<p>Brad actually knows a bunch of these folks. But like, take, for</p>
<p>example, D1, you know, it&rsquo;s Dan Sondheim&rsquo;s great investor. I</p>
<p>mean, my understanding is that they are sort of off privates</p>
<p>completely. Because why invest in a private company at x times</p>
<p>ARR when you can invest in a public SaaS company for six</p>
<p>times. So they&rsquo;ve substituted, I think Tiger is still in market</p>
<p>with a gigantic fund for privates, but the valuations</p>
<p>have come down. So they&rsquo;re essentially repricing</p>
<p>everything. I think those are probably the two broad</p>
<p>reactions you could have, right, Brad?</p>
<p>Certainly, I would say this, broadly speaking, the late</p>
<p>stage private financing market in venture is closed. Because</p>
<p>there hasn&rsquo;t been, right, we&rsquo;re in this, this buyer seller</p>
<p>standoff. sellers aren&rsquo;t to the point where they&rsquo;re willing to</p>
<p>accept that a new rate, a new regime of multiples exists.</p>
<p>Right? It&rsquo;s painful. We saw, you know, the Instacart news here</p>
<p>recently. But I think, you know, like, listen, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>even 10 or 20% of the way into the psychic reset that needs to</p>
<p>occur in order for us to see real price discovery. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to occur until these companies need money or want to</p>
<p>go public. That&rsquo;s right. This fall is when we&rsquo;ll start to see</p>
<p>real price discovery. You couldn&rsquo;t pry a late stage dollar</p>
<p>out of my hand right now. Because I don&rsquo;t think that we</p>
<p>have real price discovery going on early stage venture for</p>
<p>investing in an incredible, you know, software business at 300</p>
<p>million 400 million 500 billion, we think could be worth 10s of</p>
<p>billions, you can withstand a little inflation. But the later</p>
<p>you get in the lifecycle of a business, it&rsquo;s about IRRs and</p>
<p>IRRs in late stage at last year&rsquo;s valuations relative</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s public market valuations. That is a negative</p>
<p>arbitrage.</p>
<p>Explain IRR why that matters? Yeah, just</p>
<p>you know, we expect our herder rate in the public markets is a</p>
<p>20% risk adjusted rate of return. So if I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>like, you know, you look at these late stage private</p>
<p>valuations from last year, I mean, you know, Sachs just talked</p>
<p>about companies repricing down 40 or 50 or 60%. So if they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done that,</p>
<p>now just to have a conversation,</p>
<p>just to uplevel this, what Brad is saying is the following</p>
<p>Jason, any person can wake up tomorrow, and by the S&amp;P index,</p>
<p>right, what Buffett would tell you to do just by the S&amp;P 500</p>
<p>index, that historically has compounded at around 8% a year</p>
<p>if you reinvest the dividends, so you can do nothing, right,</p>
<p>get a basket of the 500 best companies in the world that are</p>
<p>automatically selected for you based on revenue and</p>
<p>profitability, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything. And that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>compound at 8%. That is effectively the risk free rate</p>
<p>if you want to own an equity. So if you&rsquo;re going to step into</p>
<p>the late stage private markets, and you know, buy some shares</p>
<p>and you know, ding dong calm, you got to be rewarded for that,</p>
<p>which typically means that there&rsquo;s a premium above the 8%.</p>
<p>And what Brad is saying, like, you know, it&rsquo;s actually more</p>
<p>than double, in his case, what he&rsquo;s saying is, it&rsquo;s two and a</p>
<p>half times, you know, you got to clear 20% to you. Otherwise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better off on a risk.</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s likely to happen. I&rsquo;m looking here at a list go puff</p>
<p>at 40 billion canva at 40 billion. Florida at 45 billion</p>
<p>discord at 15 billion ripple at 15 billion, these grammarly at</p>
<p>13 billion. These don&rsquo;t make sense, given that if they were</p>
<p>public, they would be trading at</p>
<p>what you can 50% of that. Here&rsquo;s what you can say. If if</p>
<p>everything is held equal, just with the rise of rates, you have</p>
<p>to reset those valuations between probably 15 and 40%.</p>
<p>Okay, at a minimum, minimum. But what Brad said is also true,</p>
<p>which is if they then keep growing at a superior rate, they</p>
<p>can get back to even so meaning 18 months, they could also show</p>
<p>up again at 40 and be net net awash, they could get unstuck,</p>
<p>but a lot of hard work will need to happen underneath the covers</p>
<p>of these businesses in the next two years, okay, for that to</p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen with a lot of these early</p>
<p>stage private companies, right is let&rsquo;s say the error multiple</p>
<p>has gone from 100 times to 20 or 30 times, they have to grow</p>
<p>their error 5x to get the same valuation. So the question is,</p>
<p>can they grow their error 5x before having to return to</p>
<p>market, that&rsquo;s just to get a flat round. Now, if they are</p>
<p>tripling this year, and then doubling next year, then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>6x growth in ARR. So even if you know, the multiples gone down</p>
<p>5x, they could still get a slight up round. So that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>game, I think all these companies are going to be</p>
<p>playing is lengthen your runway so that you can grow into your</p>
<p>valuation and not take a down round. Because the problem is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ever in a situation where you take a down round,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way worse than just the dilution, because now the</p>
<p>psychology of everyone in the company changes, everyone has to</p>
<p>worry that you&rsquo;re gone sideways.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the difficulty of what sacks is saying, though, in</p>
<p>order to grow revenue, you have to invest, right, you have to</p>
<p>invest in salespeople and account management functions in</p>
<p>engineers and product managers, right. And all of those people</p>
<p>need to exist, which actually increases opex, right, it</p>
<p>increases burn, it doesn&rsquo;t maintain burn. And so this is</p>
<p>the death spiral, Jason, you&rsquo;re talking about, which is in order</p>
<p>to actually grow by those multiples, you actually don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have more fuel, you got to increase your speed, burn more</p>
<p>fuel, you don&rsquo;t actually have the money to withstand two or</p>
<p>three or the altitude, you&rsquo;re now so it&rsquo;s going to be a very</p>
<p>precarious balancing act of trying to figure out how these</p>
<p>companies actually get to the other side. Because again, I</p>
<p>think the the buyers in this case will be will drive a hard</p>
<p>bargain. I mean, like, look, it&rsquo;s organizations like, you</p>
<p>know, durable D one tiger altimeter, these guys are the</p>
<p>smartest of the smart, they&rsquo;re not dumb. And so you know, the</p>
<p>price of capital is going up in that case. And so you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to strike really good opportunities for their</p>
<p>investors, right for their LPS, if we were going to do an</p>
<p>analogy, they&rsquo;re 20%. The analogy here is these founders</p>
<p>were on autopilot, they were asleep at the wheel. And now all</p>
<p>of a sudden, they&rsquo;re in the soup, and they got to really</p>
<p>perform. No, that&rsquo;s not fair. I don&rsquo;t think they were asleep at</p>
<p>the wheel at all. I just think that they, you know, when the</p>
<p>when the music is on, you got to dance. They did it, they</p>
<p>raised money at the highest valuation possible. God bless</p>
<p>them. Now, you&rsquo;re going to see who is really good at what they</p>
<p>do. And who was benefiting from a lot of just natural, you know,</p>
<p>you know, right. But people were</p>
<p>already sharpening the pencils for the first time. For the</p>
<p>first time that I&rsquo;m talking about, you have to make real</p>
<p>trade. Look, in an in an upmarket, well, in an upmarket</p>
<p>or a boom market, the three things that matter are growth,</p>
<p>growth and growth. In a down market, the three things that</p>
<p>matter are growth, burn and margins. It&rsquo;s not that growth</p>
<p>stops mattering. It&rsquo;s just that burn and margins also matter.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s gonna have to be real trade offs before it was</p>
<p>just how much money can we spend how quickly to get growth? Now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wait a second, is this growth efficient? You know, and</p>
<p>will we have enough runway to get to the next round without</p>
<p>having to take it down round?</p>
<p>Brad, when we saw at the peak of the pandemic, some leadership,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, you know, seasoned or well informed leadership, Airbnb</p>
<p>and Uber come to mind, cut their staffs massively. They use that</p>
<p>crisis to reset their cost structure and get to</p>
<p>profitability quicker. Those were money losing businesses for</p>
<p>a long time, maybe, you know, taking advantage of these hot</p>
<p>markets. Is that what needs to happen here? Are we going to see</p>
<p>a cascade of companies, lowering their valuation, lowering their</p>
<p>cost, sharpening their pencils, cutting staff, and then becoming</p>
<p>more efficient, and more ruthless at, you know, the six,</p>
<p>seventh, eighth product, they&rsquo;re launching saying, hey, let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to the core product and make it sing, make it profitable.</p>
<p>You know, Frank Slootman has said that Silicon Valley is full</p>
<p>of companies that are walking dead, and they don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>it. Right. You know, Frank is, you know, he says in tape socks,</p>
<p>he says, Listen, I&rsquo;m a wartime CEO, not a peacetime CEO. Right.</p>
<p>He came into he came into snowflake when it was growing</p>
<p>over 300%. And he, you know, he reconstituted what what that</p>
<p>culture was about to prepare for wartime. Right? Because he says</p>
<p>when wartime comes, right, and it gets challenging, I want to</p>
<p>run the field. Right? I don&rsquo;t want to be laying off employees.</p>
<p>I want to be that&rsquo;s the time to hire. That&rsquo;s the time to press</p>
<p>the advantage. That&rsquo;s the time to invest in product. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>time to win the new customers. Unfortunately, over the course of</p>
<p>the last 12 to 18 months, a lot of people without that</p>
<p>experience, right took a negative signal. And the signal</p>
<p>was money will always be available. And it will be</p>
<p>available at ever increasing valuations. And of course,</p>
<p>anybody who&rsquo;s been at this for 20 years, like the four of us,</p>
<p>we know that isn&rsquo;t true. But it&rsquo;s amazing. I mean, the</p>
<p>behavioral psychology, our ability to gaslight ourselves</p>
<p>totally in these moments and move out on the risk curve and</p>
<p>ignore these lessons, right. And so I really actually hurt</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time on zooms lately, with founders and</p>
<p>with their teams, talking them through this, because like, we</p>
<p>talk about it in the abstract and in through the lens of a</p>
<p>spreadsheet. But there are a lot of people&rsquo;s lives at stake. If</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an employee, and you went to this company, and you took</p>
<p>everything in stock at 15 billion, that&rsquo;s now worth 5</p>
<p>billion, you&rsquo;re totally underwater. At the same time,</p>
<p>the cost of buying a home and mortgage rates and everything</p>
<p>else is going up against you. I mean, this is a massive morale</p>
<p>problem, right? You know, for companies that frankly, we want</p>
<p>to invest in these are the innovators. But this is what</p>
<p>happens when you have government intrusion, right, that we can</p>
<p>all debate whether or not it&rsquo;s worthwhile, but it was hugely</p>
<p>distortive. What we know to be true is that we had more</p>
<p>distortion in markets the last two years than probably any time</p>
<p>since post World War Two. And the consequence of that is</p>
<p>dramatic. And you know, we all kind of saw it, but we all kind</p>
<p>of gaslighted ourselves as well. Because you were like, well,</p>
<p>maybe there is a new normal, maybe we have accelerated</p>
<p>digitization. The truth of the matter is the law of economic</p>
<p>gravity is interest rates and inflation, and it remains.</p>
<p>Yeah. And and this time turns out is not really that much</p>
<p>different. I think Jason, if you take your list of these high</p>
<p>price startups, yep, I think it would be a good useful exercise</p>
<p>for somebody to do somebody in the press should probably do it.</p>
<p>But if you take that list and just rank companies based on</p>
<p>valuation, the last announced date, yep. And then if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not announcing layoffs of any kind, you can probably forecast</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re going to burn through the money, especially if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hiring. And the reason that you can probably forecast</p>
<p>that accurately is you can pretty much predict what opex</p>
<p>will be, especially knowing the fact that their input costs are</p>
<p>actually going up. So for example, most of these</p>
<p>businesses that rely on Facebook and Google and Instagram for</p>
<p>customer acquisition, those input costs are going up. And</p>
<p>the reason you know that is that&rsquo;s $2 trillion of market cap</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t give a flying fuck what&rsquo;s happening in startup</p>
<p>land, they&rsquo;re going to make their numbers, right? Okay, those</p>
<p>are the most important companies in the world, they will ratchet</p>
<p>up the prices. And so your input costs are going up. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just the physical supply of materials that I think is going</p>
<p>up. It&rsquo;s just the cost of customer acquisition is going to</p>
<p>probably go up by 2030 40%. Right? And you know this because</p>
<p>Facebook and Google guide to where they need to perform. And</p>
<p>so if you pass that through the venture ecosystem, that all of a</p>
<p>sudden now upticks your burn. Yeah, if you&rsquo;re adding more</p>
<p>people, it upticks your burn. Yeah. And now back to David&rsquo;s</p>
<p>math, you then also have to grow five or six x that it none of</p>
<p>this hangs together. So we are at the beginning of probably a</p>
<p>very complicated process of unwinding. Yeah, the distortion</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve lived through in the last couple years.</p>
<p>At this point, I mean, you have to blame the capital allocators</p>
<p>in this instance, they bought these logos, they suspended</p>
<p>disbelief. We&rsquo;ve had this ridiculous culture of no</p>
<p>governance, uncapped notes, just pushing, I see it on the boards</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on, you guys probably see to some people just pushing top</p>
<p>line growth, never discussing unique economics, never</p>
<p>discussing the bottom line. And they created these crazy fugazi</p>
<p>markups, they raised bigger funds based on it. And they just</p>
<p>were never the adults in the room, the stewards of capital,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s infuriating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you an incredible conversation I had yesterday</p>
<p>with one of my partners. So he&rsquo;s been, you know, with me for 10</p>
<p>years. He was really the one that pushed us very early on to</p>
<p>go into deep, deep, deep tech when nobody else is doing 3d</p>
<p>printing of rockets, satellites, all that stuff. And it&rsquo;s been so</p>
<p>I really trust and respect his perspective. And he was telling</p>
<p>me a story. He called a recruiter, you know, because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been toying with, you know, helping get some folks to</p>
<p>help us manage some of our early stage deal flow. And he asked</p>
<p>her essentially something to the point of like, who are the types</p>
<p>of GPS that are getting hired today in early stage. And he</p>
<p>said, you know, this is how we approach our business, right? We</p>
<p>have a permanent capital balance sheet, you know, we do, you know,</p>
<p>at most one deal a year per partner. And she said, Well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never going to get anybody. Because a mid level</p>
<p>executive at one of these high flying startups that then goes</p>
<p>and joins a venture firm. She said, the consistent single</p>
<p>thing that they make their decision on, are you ready for</p>
<p>this? Is how many deals will I be allowed to do per year? What?</p>
<p>And so you know, these people are make work construction</p>
<p>workers, right? That&rsquo;s dig a ditch fill a ditch. That is not</p>
<p>what investing is. That&rsquo;s not about having a discerning</p>
<p>philosophy on what a business should be or a market. So if you</p>
<p>have a bunch of capital allocators, Jason, to your</p>
<p>point, who are unsophisticated about investing, probably very</p>
<p>sophisticated operationally, but fundamentally don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing. And they&rsquo;re coming and transforming an</p>
<p>organization that should be a disciplined, discerning</p>
<p>allocator of capital and turning them into a velocity deal</p>
<p>machine. This is what you&rsquo;re going to get.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes the best money sacks is money you put into a</p>
<p>bet you&rsquo;ve already made continuing to build the pot with</p>
<p>a startup that&rsquo;s already proven themselves. Correct. So I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>we have a follow on fund. Yeah, I mean, I gotta say the things</p>
<p>you guys are saying are making me feel great about our</p>
<p>portfolio. Explain. Not not because we won&rsquo;t get hit with</p>
<p>the same valuation corrections that everybody else is going to</p>
<p>suffer. But because, you know, a few years ago, we decided we</p>
<p>were going to invest in a certain kind of company. I mean,</p>
<p>high margin SaaS and marketplace businesses that were not capital</p>
<p>intensive, we defined a new metric that didn&rsquo;t exist called</p>
<p>burn multiple, which is the amount of money you burn for</p>
<p>every dollar of incremental error that you generate</p>
<p>incremental subscription revenue. And, you know, we turned</p>
<p>out investments that were growing fast, but they had a</p>
<p>horrible burn multiple. And so and I do think most of our</p>
<p>companies raised last year when, you know, they made a while the</p>
<p>sun shine. So there&rsquo;s going to be, they need to manage their</p>
<p>cash flow. So they don&rsquo;t have to raise too quickly. But as</p>
<p>long as they do that, and they keep growing, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>weather the storm.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right number, spend $3 to make one spend $2 to add</p>
<p>one, what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s your ratio?</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve said is that if you can spend $1 or less to generate</p>
<p>an incremental dollar of ARR, you&rsquo;re doing amazing. And</p>
<p>between one and two is good. So in other words, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning 20 million in a year to add an incremental 10 million of</p>
<p>ARR, you&rsquo;re doing quite well and start planned. And then when</p>
<p>you start getting into two and a half, three, that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And then above three is just bad.</p>
<p>You spent spending 30 million to add 10 million in ARR. It means</p>
<p>it takes three years, or probably four or five, because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have turned to get that money back. Yeah. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a lack of discipline. And how many VCs are we on the</p>
<p>boards? Or, you know, other investors? Are we on the board</p>
<p>and having that nuanced of a discussion? It&rsquo;s always just</p>
<p>top line, top line, top line.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very difficult, because I think the number of</p>
<p>qualified investors have gone way down as the surface area of</p>
<p>investing has gone way up. So again, just going back to this</p>
<p>conversation, this woman is staffing most of these venture</p>
<p>firms with their junior and mid level partners. And again, the</p>
<p>qualification to become a venture capitalist at this point</p>
<p>is not that you have an ability to pick or, you know, in David&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case, have operated and actually run a business and then actually</p>
<p>have developed a methodical framework or Brad&rsquo;s business,</p>
<p>which is Brad had to start from literally zero in the public</p>
<p>markets and work his way backwards to end up with 15 or</p>
<p>20 billion of assets. It&rsquo;s none of that. It&rsquo;s Are you a VP at an</p>
<p>XYZ unicorn that may also be poorly run. And all of a sudden</p>
<p>that, you know, gives you the qualification to go into a job</p>
<p>where, and it&rsquo;s not their fault, where what they are told is what</p>
<p>you want is what we&rsquo;re going to give you, which is the ability</p>
<p>to write, you know, x number of checks per year. That is</p>
<p>insanity. That&rsquo;s not what makes a good investor. And then your</p>
<p>ability to then give advice, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s probably zero,</p>
<p>or less than zero,</p>
<p>your ability to give advice is, I think we have to qualify bad</p>
<p>advice is being given. So the ability to give quality advice</p>
<p>as that was what&rsquo;s missing in this formula.</p>
<p>I just think these people are really naive, like, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not their fault. But, you know, they&rsquo;re given way too</p>
<p>much rope to hang themselves with. And they&rsquo;re and the the</p>
<p>unfortunate byproduct is going to be the, the companies who</p>
<p>gets bad advice or the bad businesses that get funded. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what you know, an efficient capital market should</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>So one of the things I&rsquo;m seeing our portfolio companies do is</p>
<p>use burn multiple as a governor for how fast they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>grow. So for example, they will say that the burn multiple</p>
<p>should not exceed two in the next quarter. So you know, we</p>
<p>want to so that the old way of doing it would be that the</p>
<p>company would just have a forecast and say, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>grow three x&rsquo;s here, we&rsquo;re going to grow error from 10 million to</p>
<p>30 million. And whatever that costs, it costs, right? That was</p>
<p>basically how companies did it. Now what I&rsquo;m seeing from some of</p>
<p>our portfolio companies is they are saying, yeah, our goal is to</p>
<p>grow from 10 to 30. But we will not spend so much money that our</p>
<p>burn multiple exceeds two. So you know, if it turns out that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a trade off here between growth, and burn burn is</p>
<p>going to win, we&rsquo;re not going to exceed that level of that ratio</p>
<p>of spending. And that&rsquo;s actually a good I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen a few</p>
<p>companies implement that already. And it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>something they should all be doing.</p>
<p>I mean, if these are pilots, they basically created a rule to</p>
<p>not stall the plane. Right, you got to keep a certain altitude a</p>
<p>certain speed. So what is the opportunity here, then if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have too many companies, too high valuations,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to hang around the rim and try to get some</p>
<p>rebounds here and try to find opportunities, what are the</p>
<p>opportunities? What are the layups here for capital</p>
<p>allocators? And for founders, if we have there are no great</p>
<p>advice for them, there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>there, there&rsquo;ve never been layups. And the problem is, you</p>
<p>know, in up markets, whenever we think that there are, it ends up</p>
<p>being what causes our downfall later, because we we just take</p>
<p>the wrong signal away. I don&rsquo;t think that there are, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be investing incremental capital into a late stage</p>
<p>startup that&rsquo;s poorly run, that doesn&rsquo;t have their margins in</p>
<p>line. And then having to work it out. Why do that? Again, I can</p>
<p>just go in the S&amp;P 500 and get 8%. And yeah, it&rsquo;s not 30%. But</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 8%. And I don&rsquo;t have to deal with all this nonsense,</p>
<p>like, well, a bunch of people because you&rsquo;re a crossover</p>
<p>investor, right? I mean, you have the ability to choose</p>
<p>between public, private, or wherever you want to play.</p>
<p>I actually think what I am is an investor. Right? Yeah, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have LPS for a VC fund like sacks. And I do. But but</p>
<p>this but this is my point, like, I think investing</p>
<p>irrespective of whatever stage you do it still fundamentally</p>
<p>comes down to the following, which is do you have the</p>
<p>judgment to understand whether these decisions are marginally</p>
<p>good, marginally average or marginally destructive for the</p>
<p>short, medium and long term of a business. And I just don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that enough people steep themselves in the practice that</p>
<p>it takes to get good at that kind of a game. And I think what</p>
<p>these moments expose is that the status games that come</p>
<p>around investing, because it just seems like it&rsquo;s easy, it</p>
<p>just seems like you don&rsquo;t do much work. That&rsquo;s what ruins</p>
<p>these periods. And the implications, I think, as Brad</p>
<p>said, is really right. It affects the employees, it</p>
<p>affects the entrepreneurs, it affects the startup culture, it</p>
<p>affects the incremental desire for people to take a shot at</p>
<p>things, you can overcome all of it, we have and we will again.</p>
<p>But I really think like to the entrepreneur, the message is if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, you know, taking a term sheet, I think you have to have</p>
<p>better judgment to really look at that on that investor and say</p>
<p>is this person really qualified to help me? Because in these</p>
<p>moments, in the absence of help, you&rsquo;re probably going to</p>
<p>basically have a valuation reset at the minimum case. And the</p>
<p>worst case is you go out of business.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s insightful about you said Shamath, and I&rsquo;ll hand it to</p>
<p>you, Brad, is that a lot of the founders picked based on the</p>
<p>highest valuation who their next investor should be. And now we</p>
<p>see what a trap that is spread.</p>
<p>You know, the takeaway for me is we return to a place we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always been, which is about selection. Right? Look at the</p>
<p>mean returns for ventures for 20 years, they&rsquo;re lousy, lousy,</p>
<p>right? 90% of the of the spoils,</p>
<p>they barely, barely mapped to the public,</p>
<p>five to 10% of the investments. And that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>been. Look at look at Buffett, right? by superior companies at</p>
<p>good prices. What are the two technology companies Buffett</p>
<p>bought in the public markets?</p>
<p>Tablet,</p>
<p>Apple and Snowflake,</p>
<p>Snowflake,</p>
<p>Apple and Snowflake, he doesn&rsquo;t own a broad basket of law, a</p>
<p>long tail internet or long tail software. And so I think what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see, and to Sax&rsquo;s point, I think even</p>
<p>running a recipe on software as though all ARR is created equal.</p>
<p>I mean, I can show you five companies, each with 100 million</p>
<p>of ARR, each growing at 30%. And there&rsquo;s massive dispersion in</p>
<p>future outcomes. Yeah, right. And so like, I just think that</p>
<p>this at the end of the day is a craft business. It&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>essentialist business. It&rsquo;s about finding and identifying</p>
<p>those very, very, very few companies that ever durably are</p>
<p>worth more than $10 billion. You know, on my screen today, Chamath</p>
<p>was just talking. There are four internet companies that are</p>
<p>green today. Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook. Everything</p>
<p>else on my screen is bleeding</p>
<p>must own must own versus</p>
<p>everything else is red. And my growth internet stocks are down</p>
<p>400 basis points. Right? The market is voting with its wallet</p>
<p>where it wants to sit on the risk curve. Right. And I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just going to go there&rsquo;s no new normal here. This is just</p>
<p>back to the future, right, is what we&rsquo;ve always done. And, you</p>
<p>know, the reset is always painful. The only surprising</p>
<p>thing is how often we have to go through it.</p>
<p>If opportunities do arise, where will they where will they be</p>
<p>bred? I mean, I was watching Peloton, I always love that</p>
<p>company. I see the change in management, I see the</p>
<p>management, you know, thinking about profitability, thinking</p>
<p>about creating it into a marketplace, maybe having more</p>
<p>hardware available, disconnected from the software, etc. Do you</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s opportunities there? Or there will be</p>
<p>opportunities over the next year to buy some of the names that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t the fangs?</p>
<p>What we do in the first instance, Jason, and listen, we</p>
<p>outperformed last year, because we owned quality, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>short, lower quality stuff. Unfortunately, this year, the</p>
<p>market said, guess what, it&rsquo;s all overvalued quality, low</p>
<p>quality doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;re taking it all lower. And so for</p>
<p>us in moments like this, and I&rsquo;ve lived probably through five</p>
<p>of them in the public markets, we always do the same thing.</p>
<p>degross, take risk down. First thing is, like have less chits</p>
<p>on the board. Number two, reduce the number of outliers pull in</p>
<p>the risk curve. Right? For me, I want to own five or six things,</p>
<p>because remember, I&rsquo;m the biggest LP in the fund. This is</p>
<p>my money, I want to sleep well at night. And I want to protect</p>
<p>the foundations, the endowments, the good causes we represent. I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that with a company that has an unproven business</p>
<p>model. I may think that it&rsquo;s going to be great in the future,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know. So the problem with for the Pelotons of the</p>
<p>world, right, they may be incredible returners. But what</p>
<p>every portfolio manager on the planet is doing today is</p>
<p>compressing the number of names in their portfolio, saying what</p>
<p>are the companies I know with absolute certainty, whether</p>
<p>rates are two and a half, three and a half, four and a half,</p>
<p>five and a half is going to be worth more over the course of</p>
<p>the next two to three years. That&rsquo;s what I want to own. Right.</p>
<p>Wait, what, what I was just gonna say, I don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>Brad, but Jason, what you&rsquo;re talking about is what a lot of</p>
<p>people do. You see a lot on Twitter, and I call it clapping</p>
<p>as a strategy. What about this? And what about that? And what</p>
<p>about if they do this? And what about clapping is not a</p>
<p>strategy? clapping is something people do at the blackjack</p>
<p>table, it turns out it doesn&rsquo;t actually influence the cards.</p>
<p>Sure. And so I think you have to stop with the clapping as a</p>
<p>strategy, because</p>
<p>to be clear, that&rsquo;s not my strategy. I was asking that as</p>
<p>the moderator. Is there just to be clear, I&rsquo;m not advising that</p>
<p>as a strategy. I&rsquo;m saying I think you&rsquo;re representing a</p>
<p>psychological reaction that a lot of people have. And I think</p>
<p>what Brad is trying to tell you is clapping is not a strategy.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m asking that on behalf of the audience. It is</p>
<p>not my belief, just to be clear. My commentary to the audience</p>
<p>is clapping is not a strategy. Yes, correct. Yes. If enough</p>
<p>people, though, do what you&rsquo;re saying, Brad, and they just</p>
<p>retreat to quality, at some point that quality, those</p>
<p>quality companies would then become fully valued, maybe even</p>
<p>overvalued. And thus the cycle begins again or not. So how long</p>
<p>does that take?</p>
<p>No, you nailed it. What happened last year 2021. dispersion</p>
<p>collapsed. Go check out jam and ball who does incredible</p>
<p>software analysis on our team. dispersion collapse between the</p>
<p>best cohort and the worst cohort of software companies last year.</p>
<p>The first thing that happened is dispersion returns, we pay a</p>
<p>higher price for the best shit, and we pay a lower price for the</p>
<p>low quality stuff, right? Then when we start to recover, when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more predictability in the world, when we resolve the</p>
<p>war, when we understand the path of inflation, right, the stuff</p>
<p>and close in on the risk curve, that&rsquo;ll start being fully</p>
<p>valued. So then we will be brave enough to walk a little further</p>
<p>out on the ice on the lake, testing it, is it safe to walk</p>
<p>here. And then you walk out a little further. And sadly,</p>
<p>right, eventually, we&rsquo;re in the exact same pattern we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>before, which is we&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;re at a market top five or</p>
<p>six or seven years from now, when we repeat the same asinine</p>
<p>behavior that we just went through when everybody becomes</p>
<p>complacent again, and overbidding this stuff way out</p>
<p>on the risk curve. I&rsquo;m just suggesting to you the number one</p>
<p>question I get from GPs, venture capitalists and others right now</p>
<p>is when are we going to bounce back? Let me be absolutely</p>
<p>clear. There is no bouncing back to where we were the last 18</p>
<p>months. That was the outlier. That was the make believe. What</p>
<p>I hope and expect is that we can bat bounce back to the five year</p>
<p>average. But even to durably trade at the five year average,</p>
<p>we have to have a lot more clarity on the war in Ukraine on</p>
<p>inflation and rates.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a perfect place to pivot sacks. We&rsquo;re now here and</p>
<p>I think this is the fourth or fifth episode where we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>discussing the war and we flipped it today just to do</p>
<p>markets first. For a little change of pace. And since we had</p>
<p>Brad here, where are we at with the war? And what are your what</p>
<p>is your expectation of it wrapping up or it escalating?</p>
<p>Well, actually, there&rsquo;s a tweet storm this morning, that</p>
<p>Chamath you sent to the group that from a Russian official,</p>
<p>and it seemed to indicate, well, it indicate what we&rsquo;ve kind of</p>
<p>known for a few weeks now, which is what the broad contours of</p>
<p>what a peace deal would look like, which is there&rsquo;s three</p>
<p>main pieces. Neutrality for Ukraine, the Russians insist</p>
<p>that it not be part of NATO, they get to keep Crimea, which</p>
<p>they annexed in 2014. That&rsquo;s been a fait accompli. And then</p>
<p>some version of independence for these sort of breakaway</p>
<p>territories. In eastern Ukraine, the in the Donbass region,</p>
<p>everyone kind of knows that&rsquo;s the the broad strokes of the</p>
<p>deal, then there&rsquo;s, you know, a lot of details are going to</p>
<p>matter a lot to the people who live there, like is there this</p>
<p>land bridge from Crimea to Donbass, but frankly, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter as much to all of us, the United States of America. So the</p>
<p>question is, you know, what is the administration going to do</p>
<p>about it? Biden just went to Europe. And, you know, my</p>
<p>concern is that no one in Washington, and I talked about</p>
<p>this last week seems to be pushing for a ceasefire, it</p>
<p>seems like their preferred position is for Russia to bleed</p>
<p>out as as long as possible in Ukraine for the US to fund an</p>
<p>insurgency Allah Afghanistan, where, you know, these fighters</p>
<p>in eastern Ukraine are sort of like the Mujahideen. Is that the</p>
<p>right word? Well, sure. Because, you know, if they&rsquo;re defending</p>
<p>their own land, and so we&rsquo;re the Mujahideen, I mean, I know, but</p>
<p>why would you call it an insurgency? Well, defending</p>
<p>their land, if the government of Ukraine falls, and it becomes an</p>
<p>insurgency. So the point is that the administration, the question</p>
<p>is, what&rsquo;s the administration&rsquo;s endgame here? Do they want to</p>
<p>lead the world to a ceasefire? Or do they want to protract the</p>
<p>conflict to impose on the Russian state, a Afghan style,</p>
<p>you know, debilitating defeat to destabilize the Russian regime.</p>
<p>Neil Ferguson had a column this week in it&rsquo;s his Bloomberg</p>
<p>column from the Brookings Institute at Stanford. No, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from he&rsquo;s from Hoover. Hoover, rather. Sorry. Yeah. So I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>read. I&rsquo;ll read this book.</p>
<p>Hoover is at it. Can you just explain to people what the</p>
<p>Hoover Institute is and how that leans?</p>
<p>Hoover Institute for War and Peace, I would say it sort of</p>
<p>leans idealistic in foreign policy, I would describe Neil as</p>
<p>sort of the most realistic idealist. Got it. So context,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s quite well sourced, I think, with, you know, and with,</p>
<p>you know, various people in Washington, Europe, and what he</p>
<p>wrote is, the US intends to keep this war going, the</p>
<p>administration will continue to supply the Ukrainians with</p>
<p>anti aircraft stingers, anti tank javelins, explosive</p>
<p>switchblade drones, it will keep trying to persuade other NATO</p>
<p>governments supply heavier defensive weaponry, and so on.</p>
<p>He says, Washington will revert to the Afghanistan after 1979</p>
<p>playbook of supplying an insurgency, only if the</p>
<p>Ukrainian government loses the conventional war. So the</p>
<p>concern here is that the US government has an incentive,</p>
<p>actually, that they don&rsquo;t want a quick end to this war is</p>
<p>basically the theory is they want the Russian state to bleed</p>
<p>out and be destabilized.</p>
<p>In a way, it&rsquo;s the one chance we have for like regime change</p>
<p>there without us actually starting a war is that they have</p>
<p>this self inflicted wound. That is the theory.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think a lot of people are saying that that is</p>
<p>what a lot of people want in Washington. I don&rsquo;t you know,</p>
<p>this is not like conspiracy theory, people are saying this</p>
<p>is our chance to topple the Russian state destabilize it.</p>
<p>There was a Rand Corporation. How do you survey a few years</p>
<p>ago, hold on, there&rsquo;s a Rand Corporation studied on a few</p>
<p>years ago, that was commissioned by somebody probably in our</p>
<p>State Department, or someone like that, where they talked</p>
<p>about this, that if we want to destabilize the Russian regime,</p>
<p>Ukraine is the way to do it.</p>
<p>Right, they would fall for it, right, they would actually fight</p>
<p>that fight that is an unwinnable fight, we would basically be</p>
<p>putting an app, we&rsquo;d be supporting an Afghanistan like</p>
<p>path for them to go down like we did. And they previously to</p>
<p>that, right?</p>
<p>And the problem, the problem that I see is just this, which</p>
<p>is, we&rsquo;ve discussed on on this program, the downsides of this</p>
<p>war. First, it&rsquo;s a humanitarian disaster. Second, we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about the risks of recession later in the year. Third,</p>
<p>Freeberg talked about famine, the risk of famine later this</p>
<p>year, if the spring planning doesn&rsquo;t happen. And then fourth,</p>
<p>we have this, always we have this risk that the war spins</p>
<p>out of control, and goes nuclear, right, and leads into</p>
<p>World War Three. Those are some vital American interests to</p>
<p>avoid all of those scenarios. I don&rsquo;t see an equivalent vital</p>
<p>American interest in determining the exact nuances</p>
<p>of who rules the Donbass. In other words, the broad strokes</p>
<p>of this agreement are there. You know, what the US should be</p>
<p>doing is leading, they should be pushing for lead, not bleed,</p>
<p>lead the way to a ceasefire, not to inflict maximum damage on the</p>
<p>Russian regime,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t know exactly what their intent is, because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing this behind closed doors. Brad, what&rsquo;s your take on this?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re David and I talked about this at dinner the</p>
<p>other night, I think there&rsquo;s something bigger playing out</p>
<p>here. I mean, clearly, he&rsquo;s the expert on real politic. And, you</p>
<p>know, but it seems to me that we have had decades of military</p>
<p>diplomacy. Right. And and most recently, the pal doctrine of</p>
<p>overwhelming force, we don&rsquo;t want to make the same mistake we</p>
<p>made in Vietnam. So like, we&rsquo;re going to go in with full force.</p>
<p>And, you know, basically, the public doesn&rsquo;t support, you</p>
<p>know, military adventure ism anymore. Right. And so now we</p>
<p>have maybe we&rsquo;ll call it the Blinken doctrine, which is the</p>
<p>pal doctrine equivalent, but for economic force. It&rsquo;s the nuclear</p>
<p>economic weapon that is on full display by the West right now</p>
<p>that I think has really significant implications, right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reunited the West. And I don&rsquo;t think this is just about</p>
<p>Putin. And I think the reason that the US and Western Europe</p>
<p>is slow playing this a bit is they&rsquo;re sending a message to the</p>
<p>Chinese as well, which is that we will we are unified and we</p>
<p>will use an economic weapon of mass destruction. If, right, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t play by global norms. And so the box I think we&rsquo;re in from</p>
<p>a negotiating perspective, right, in Ukraine right now is</p>
<p>not a box around neutrality. I mean, neutrality is already</p>
<p>clear. I mean, we had Zelensky didn&rsquo;t even ask for a no fly</p>
<p>zone. He&rsquo;s not even asking for NATO membership. They&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>seeded neutrality. I think the real question is sanctions. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think the West wants to roll back sanctions. And I think</p>
<p>Putin saying I can&rsquo;t hightail it out of here, unless you roll</p>
<p>back all the sanctions and give me a little bit of the Donbass.</p>
<p>And so watch the next week or two, like in any good</p>
<p>negotiation. Unfortunately, I think both sides are going to</p>
<p>amp up their current strategies, we may see missiles coming out</p>
<p>of Russia, and we may see European, complete European</p>
<p>embargo of Russian oil 3 million barrels a day. Those</p>
<p>will be the final straws right before we enter negotiations,</p>
<p>because then they can see the last things that they took as</p>
<p>part of the negotiation. But this I think is going to be all</p>
<p>about economic sanctions. And, and I think the West is playing</p>
<p>a really strong game. What I worry about, and Saks has talked</p>
<p>about this at length, is that we overreach, we overplay our hand</p>
<p>here in an effort to send a signal to other parties around</p>
<p>the world. Right. And that has fat tail risk associated with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re referencing China and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question. How many of us woke up or this at the</p>
<p>beginning of this year, or in making our New Year&rsquo;s</p>
<p>resolutions and said that we need to risk recession, famine</p>
<p>and war in order to destabilize and topple the Russian regime?</p>
<p>When did this become a vital American interest? No one at the</p>
<p>beginning of the year thought this was an important goal of</p>
<p>America. What&rsquo;s more important is, is basically getting our</p>
<p>economy back on track and back on track after this long, this</p>
<p>long, this this plague we&rsquo;ve had. I mean, nobody needed this</p>
<p>problem. And what the administration should have done</p>
<p>was use diplomacy and all the resources to try and prevent the</p>
<p>conflict. And now the conflict has occurred, we should be</p>
<p>pushing for a negotiated peace and ceasefire. We do not have a</p>
<p>vital national interest in the details of who rolls rolls the</p>
<p>Don bass.</p>
<p>Yeah, the problem with your setting up of that question is</p>
<p>that we did not start the war Putin did. Chamath, you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>silent so far. What are your thoughts on this war that</p>
<p>we started the war?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re saying did we wake up and say that we should do</p>
<p>this? We did not listen.</p>
<p>The people in the media woke up on February 24. And you think</p>
<p>Putin went mad. And there&rsquo;s no pre history to this conflict.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the deal. Hold on a second. This is a war of</p>
<p>Russian aggression. It&rsquo;s true that Putin started it. He&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>invader. However, there were things we could have done to</p>
<p>prevent or to avoid this war. And American diplomacy</p>
<p>completely failed. And we even discussed it the month before</p>
<p>this war started. We talked about how the US could have</p>
<p>given a written guarantee to Russia that Ukraine would not be</p>
<p>part of NATO. Just this week, Zelensky in an interview with</p>
<p>Freed Zakaria admitted he was told by Blinken, you will not be</p>
<p>part of NATO. But we don&rsquo;t want to admit that publicly. What</p>
<p>games were they playing? What is the point of playing that kind</p>
<p>of game with a grave issue of war and peace? Why didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Blinken say publicly what he said to Zelensky? This</p>
<p>administration did not do everything it could do to</p>
<p>prevent war. And now we are faced with all of these</p>
<p>existential risks. Why? For what reason?</p>
<p>The reason is that it gave the United States an opportunity to</p>
<p>topple Russia. I mean, exactly. And who have us thought we</p>
<p>needed that at the beginning of this year? Well, I think that</p>
<p>you know, the thing to keep in mind, and again, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that this is right, but I&rsquo;m just game</p>
<p>theorizing that these are like, you know, grudges that these</p>
<p>guys have held for a very long time. And I think it started</p>
<p>when they were in the Obama White House, and it carried</p>
<p>over to now. And I think they saw an opportunity to basically</p>
<p>execute a strategy that essentially now I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>moving into the second phase of this war, which is effectively</p>
<p>trying to bait Russia into doing something really egregiously</p>
<p>bad. And that is terrible, David, to your point, I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re willing to, you know, sacrifice a lot. I think we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>decided that implicitly by based on the actions of the American</p>
<p>government. And, and it&rsquo;s weird, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>Russia to react. And so the rhetoric, in fact, the rhetoric</p>
<p>since that, do you guys remember, I think it was only 10</p>
<p>days ago that both Russia and Ukraine said the surface area of</p>
<p>a deal is pretty much in sight. Oh, Friedberg from the top rope</p>
<p>coming in. Look at you, Friedberg. I mean, like you, you</p>
<p>look like an everyman. I mean, I&rsquo;m so proud of you. Are you</p>
<p>actually driving your own car, gas guzzling car, SUV in the</p>
<p>you should be</p>
<p>in that tank. Is that Putin&rsquo;s gas?</p>
<p>I only use ethanol I make in vats in my backyard.</p>
<p>When I use solar panels that are handcrafted in my way to find a</p>
<p>luke oil gas station filled up.</p>
<p>What I was saying guys was that, you know, from the 10 days from</p>
<p>when, you know, both sides, Russia and Ukraine were like,</p>
<p>Hey, you know, we think we&rsquo;re basically there, we have a deal.</p>
<p>The rhetoric has gotten really insane. You know, yesterday, I</p>
<p>think it was like, the United States said, you know, we, we</p>
<p>think that Russia should be kicked out of the G 20. Then</p>
<p>Russia responded and said, I&rsquo;m only going to sell that gas and</p>
<p>settle it in rubles. You know, all of a sudden, other actors,</p>
<p>China and Saudi Arabia are in the game. Now, you know, China</p>
<p>and Saudi Arabia are negotiating settling a huge oil trade in</p>
<p>new one. Why in the last 10 days of all these things happened</p>
<p>when we were so close to getting something done? I think the best</p>
<p>explanation is that we are willing to, I guess we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>decided, I mean, we, none of us have decided, but American</p>
<p>government said that some amount of sacrifice is okay. If it</p>
<p>could trigger a Russian escalation, which could then</p>
<p>further destabilize that country. And I think they</p>
<p>believe that that&rsquo;s more important than anything else.</p>
<p>I think we, you know, from where I sit, I think we can take</p>
<p>putting out his word that he actually cares about</p>
<p>reunification. And that&rsquo;s not to say he&rsquo;s crazy, David. And I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think we can control his behavior. I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Wednesday, or his word reunification.</p>
<p>Never said that, Jason. And also just today, the Russian</p>
<p>military, the tweet that I sent you guys was from the Russian</p>
<p>military. And that was an official statement. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he they would be allowed without Putin&rsquo;s explicit sign</p>
<p>off. They no longer talked about denazificating Ukraine or</p>
<p>demilitarizing Ukraine. They simply focused it on the Don</p>
<p>boss. And to use your son zoo argument, it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to construct their own golden bridge to exit</p>
<p>in a way where they can claim victory to the Russian people to</p>
<p>explain the 10s of 1000s of, you know, Russian military people</p>
<p>that have been killed in this whole conflict, right, because</p>
<p>they have an explanation that they have to give. But in all of</p>
<p>this, I think that we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re probably exposing a very high</p>
<p>risk game of poker that we&rsquo;re playing, which is it seems that</p>
<p>the US government is focused more on the destabilization of,</p>
<p>of Russia than they are in getting this conflict behind us.</p>
<p>I mean, he did. He did say in his speech, since time</p>
<p>immemorial, the people living in the southwest of what has</p>
<p>historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians</p>
<p>and Orthodox Christians. That&rsquo;s Don bass. Yeah, I know. But he</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a Jason, there&rsquo;s been a civil war going on since</p>
<ol start="2014">
<li>In this Don bass region between Ukrainians and these</li>
</ol>
<p>sort of these Russian speakers. And now that civil wars as this</p>
<p>a Balkan style civil war that has now escalated with, you</p>
<p>know, Ukraine and Russia getting in and now the whole West</p>
<p>potentially could get in. This is a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>We should not let spin out of control.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m agreeing with that. You guys asked me, did he ever talk about</p>
<p>reunification? He did. He did in his speech was not one of his</p>
<p>stated war objectives. Now you could keep accusing him of being</p>
<p>a liar. But look what his objective is, just take him at</p>
<p>his word that he believes these areas are Russian, and they</p>
<p>should be considered</p>
<p>area where they are predominantly Russian speakers.</p>
<p>Look, and I&rsquo;m not taking a side in who should rule the Don bass.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a complicated, ethnic strife sort</p>
<p>of issue, like we saw in the Balkans all the time between the</p>
<p>Russians who live there and the Ukrainians who live there. What</p>
<p>I do know is it&rsquo;s not worth risking war three, over 100%</p>
<p>agreement, 100% agreement,</p>
<p>sex, let me Can I ask you a question? So how is Putin going</p>
<p>to withdraw without 100% lifting of the sanctions? And how is the</p>
<p>West possibly going to trust him to withdraw? Right? Well,</p>
<p>while taking all the sanctions off, that seems to me like, when</p>
<p>I try to construct the Golden Bridge, in my mind, it comes</p>
<p>down to, you know, like, how do we how do we whack up the</p>
<p>sanctions? Do we take some of them off? Say prove to us be out</p>
<p>for x period of time, and then we&rsquo;ll roll the other ones off.</p>
<p>Because these sanctions are not going to be rolled back in the</p>
<p>next three months based on some ceasefire.</p>
<p>I agree with that. I don&rsquo;t know that Putin can expect the</p>
<p>sanctions to be lifted, or that he can effectively negotiate for</p>
<p>that. I think, again, where I think the the peace deal is, is</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve known all along what it&rsquo;s going to be Ukraine will</p>
<p>agree to neutrality in exchange for some security guarantees</p>
<p>from the West. Russia will get to keep Crimea because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a fait accompli since the annexation 2014. And there will</p>
<p>be some sort of regional autonomy for these sort of</p>
<p>Russian speaking areas in the Donbass, which, by the way, we</p>
<p>could have had that too. There was a deal called Minsk two</p>
<p>since 2015. That simply hasn&rsquo;t been implemented. So, you know,</p>
<p>I think that those are the broad strokes of the deal. And then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s questions about, well, is there a land bridge from</p>
<p>Crimea to the Donbass? And, you know, what weapons exactly does</p>
<p>Ukraine get to get from the United States or get to keep? I</p>
<p>mean, so look, those details matter a lot to the people who</p>
<p>live there. But the broad strokes of this, I think are</p>
<p>pretty well understood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not betting this way with with our book. But if I had to</p>
<p>guess, we are going to have a period of significant escalation</p>
<p>on both sides. Before they both get to the table. Macron said</p>
<p>this week that we still have the Europeans have not made a</p>
<p>decision about the embargo of Russian oil that will collapse</p>
<p>the Russian economy and oil will go to 180 or $200 a barrel.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a real likelihood. And the second one</p>
<p>is I think the Russians will amp up military aggression in some</p>
<p>face saving measure and to have more to negotiate with. So maybe</p>
<p>to answer my own question is if there is an oil embargo, then</p>
<p>you take the oil embargo off, right as part of the economic</p>
<p>sanction whacking up of the sanctions, because that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>the nuclear option against the Russians economically. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a, you know, unfortunately, I think we have to be prepared for</p>
<p>this to get worse before it gets better, because it makes sense</p>
<p>from just a game theory for both sides to grab as much as they</p>
<p>can, right before they sit down at the table, so they have more</p>
<p>shit to give to each other.</p>
<p>Right. But the problem is, if both sides keep asking, I agree</p>
<p>with that fundamental analysis is that neither Putin nor</p>
<p>Zelensky can be trusted on their own to basically make</p>
<p>peace because they want to push their advantage. If either one</p>
<p>believes that they&rsquo;re winning on the battlefield, they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to push their advantage to grab as much as they can to then</p>
<p>negotiate from a position of greater strength. The problem is</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in an escalatory spiral, where if you know one or</p>
<p>both of them miscalculate, we never get that deal. And I think</p>
<p>the longer the war drags on, the harder it is to make a deal not</p>
<p>easier. One of the I&rsquo;d say one of the disturbing things that</p>
<p>came out over the past week was in that interview that I</p>
<p>mentioned, where freed Zakaria interviewed Zelensky. Zelensky</p>
<p>said, he said that it&rsquo;s either going to get a peace deal, or</p>
<p>World War Three. And I&rsquo;m listening to this thinking, wait</p>
<p>a second. You know, that, that is a pretty scary posture for</p>
<p>him to be taking. And furthermore, who appointed him</p>
<p>leader of the free world, you know, the decision to have war</p>
<p>three is not his decision. He is not the President United</p>
<p>States, we did not vote for him. We may think he&rsquo;s heroic, we may</p>
<p>think he deserves our support. But he does not get to turn this</p>
<p>into war three for us. The American people did not choose</p>
<p>that. And this is where I go back to Biden and the</p>
<p>administration and their leadership, what are they</p>
<p>pushing for? Are they pushing for a protracted, never ending</p>
<p>Afghan style war in Ukraine? Or are they going to lead the</p>
<p>situation to some sort of negotiation or ceasefire? And I</p>
<p>just think if we&rsquo;re considering the interest of the United</p>
<p>States, we would not let this decision purely be Zelensky&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s willing to entertain war three, that can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>acceptable to us.</p>
<p>But what what what what is his worst alternative? I mean, like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s losing his country. So of course, he wants to say, the</p>
<p>thing that would scare us into action, potentially, right? So</p>
<p>he has nothing to lose. So right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we can&rsquo;t let him decide for us.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not deciding. He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s using rhetoric to get us to talk</p>
<p>about it, which he just won. Like he, you can see that what</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying, right? Yeah, because you&rsquo;re talking about it.</p>
<p>So I think the I think the bigger question in all of this</p>
<p>is, when is the United States willing to draw a really hard</p>
<p>line. So there was a another thing that happened, which is</p>
<p>that, you know, Biden essentially said, like, you</p>
<p>know, if they use chemical weapons, we will react sort of</p>
<p>in kind, right? There was some some version of that. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>red line, basically, he said, yes. And, and then he also said,</p>
<p>you know, depending on, you know, how they use nuclear</p>
<p>weapons, we could theoretically respond. So just the rhetoric is</p>
<p>ratcheting way, way up. And that is surprising to me, because I</p>
<p>would have thought we had a deal in sight, just get it done. Be</p>
<p>pregnant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re assuming that we have the influence, you assume, David,</p>
<p>that we have the influence to actually cut a deal. You were</p>
<p>saying yourself in the last couple of months, that the US</p>
<p>power has waned, and that we don&rsquo;t have influence. So which</p>
<p>is it? I believe we have the influence to to get facilitated</p>
<p>deal. Listen, let me give you an example. We are giving Zelensky</p>
<p>and the Ukrainians all these incredible weapons. What are the</p>
<p>conditions on that? If Zelensky is unwilling to make a</p>
<p>reasonable peace deal? Do we do we have any conditions and are</p>
<p>giving him these weapons? Why wouldn&rsquo;t we insist Zelensky?</p>
<p>Listen, we support you. We basically are against this</p>
<p>Russian aggression, you should have the right to defend your</p>
<p>homeland and drive them out. But we also want you to take a</p>
<p>reasonable peace deal, if one is available, and we need you to</p>
<p>specify what that is. You&rsquo;re only exercising that kind of</p>
<p>discretion. I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re assuming that Biden is blocking this when in</p>
<p>fact, it might be that Putin is and I believe you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s sort of position here over our own presidents. I think</p>
<p>you need to know for a second that we don&rsquo;t want to have this</p>
<p>continual escalate. You actually think there&rsquo;s a world in which</p>
<p>Biden wants to see this escalate? I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the case. I think that we don&rsquo;t have influence. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the David, we do not have the influence today that we did.</p>
<p>It is no longer Neil Ferguson&rsquo;s days, you know, gets to dictate</p>
<p>to the world what&rsquo;s going on here. We no longer have that</p>
<p>about this. Israel, Putin wants to talk to Macron in France, not</p>
<p>us, because we&rsquo;re not seen as an honest broker. But But look,</p>
<p>tomorrow, we don&rsquo;t have the influence we once had. Okay,</p>
<p>let me explain. I&rsquo;m not saying we can dictate the outcome. Okay.</p>
<p>But we can push for a negotiated settlement instead of a</p>
<p>protracted we can lead not bleed. Okay. Chamath laid it out.</p>
<p>Neil Ferguson laid it out. The Rand Corporation laid it out.</p>
<p>These there is a significant chance that there are</p>
<p>definitely actors in the State Department who want to see an</p>
<p>Afghan style situation insurgency play out in Eastern</p>
<p>Europe. That&rsquo;s their goal. Okay. Now, I don&rsquo;t know what Biden is</p>
<p>thinking. But he has made no statement. To the contrary, what</p>
<p>have we done to help lead the situation to a negotiated</p>
<p>settlement? Name one thing.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re in the room, David. But Biden is in</p>
<p>your honor, I read all their public statements. I don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>anything. I don&rsquo;t think they want to negotiate to the press</p>
<p>with Putin. I don&rsquo;t think they want to go to Europe right now.</p>
<p>I think that says enough about what his intent is. He&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>Poland, right? He&rsquo;s going to Poland. He&rsquo;s in Poland. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scaling up our military presence. Listen, yeah. I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. All I&rsquo;m saying is, look, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what</p>
<p>Biden is saying or doing behind closed doors. What I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>that the US should be playing a constructive role to get to a</p>
<p>negotiated ceasefire, not indulging this sort of</p>
<p>fantastical thinking, that we can basically perpetrate a</p>
<p>regime change operation in Russia with you on that. I agree</p>
<p>with you on that.</p>
<p>I, I&rsquo;m worried that there may be a small strain of that</p>
<p>probability in the range of outcomes here. And I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that before. I really thought that, okay, maybe we</p>
<p>were a little bit on the outside looking in. But it looks like,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re pretty close to a deal, these guys will get in a</p>
<p>room, they&rsquo;ll, you know, chop it up, and it&rsquo;ll be done. And</p>
<p>instead, honestly, if you just look at the headlines and the</p>
<p>rhetoric, and the words from all these three leaders in the last</p>
<p>10 days, it&rsquo;s been, it&rsquo;s been in the other direction. And so you</p>
<p>have to wonder what is the point of all of this right now, other</p>
<p>than</p>
<p>crescendoing, like Brad said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, I listened to Blinken over the weekend. And he talked</p>
<p>about what I think he defined what is this new doctrine of</p>
<p>economic statecraft, he said, our objective is, we have the</p>
<p>power to impose overwhelming costs on our target, economic</p>
<p>costs. And he said, our cause, Putin&rsquo;s actions are remembered</p>
<p>as a strategic failure, not regime change. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>within our control. That is very different. Bush wanted regime</p>
<p>change in Iraq, and we executed it through the pal doctrine of</p>
<p>overwhelming military force. I think that this is a doctrine of</p>
<p>overwhelming economic force that is meant to not only signal to</p>
<p>the Russians, but every other rogue dictator in the world. If</p>
<p>you go rolling into your neighbor, uninvited, you can</p>
<p>count on the fact that there&rsquo;s going to be massive economic</p>
<p>sanctions, because our military deterrence is no longer a</p>
<p>deterrent. Everybody knows we&rsquo;re not going to go defend Taiwan,</p>
<p>everybody knows we&rsquo;re not going to send our military to Ukraine.</p>
<p>So we have to demonstrate that we actually have economic</p>
<p>resolve, not these poo poo sanctions we&rsquo;ve been having</p>
<p>around the world for the last 20 years. And if that is the</p>
<p>lasting impact on this, I think you&rsquo;re right, you know, that we</p>
<p>turn this into an economic nuclear weapon. Yeah, better</p>
<p>than sending our kids around the world to get killed. I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely right. And I think Tony is very smart to say</p>
<p>what he said. The, the one thing that I would want, though,</p>
<p>on top of that, tell me if you agree, is just to ratchet down</p>
<p>our rhetoric, which we can control.</p>
<p>And maybe to, I mean, why not say that, listen, we&rsquo;re willing</p>
<p>to put these sanctions on the table, we&rsquo;re willing to</p>
<p>basically re institute economic ties with Russia, if we can get</p>
<p>to a satisfactory outcome,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to reward. I would say is we&rsquo;re making a big</p>
<p>assumption to say that there&rsquo;s not back channel diplomacy going</p>
<p>on from the Israelis, the Turks, the French, you know,</p>
<p>having those conversations on our behalf, right? Like, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, I honestly, I don&rsquo;t know that there, that&rsquo;s a high</p>
<p>probability that we&rsquo;re not sending those signals. But to</p>
<p>your point, I just don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Either, but I don&rsquo;t know either. But But here&rsquo;s what I would say</p>
<p>is, look, I can only judge from the public statements. And I</p>
<p>think there is signal in these public statements. And the</p>
<p>statements are all one way, there is no olive branch. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all it&rsquo;s all basically about escalation. Just like in January</p>
<p>before the war, what were the State Department&rsquo;s statements</p>
<p>about the situation? They said that NATO&rsquo;s door is open and</p>
<p>will remain open, even though they told Zelenskyy in private</p>
<p>that he would not be joining NATO. Okay, that was an</p>
<p>astounding revelation that came out this week on the Fried</p>
<p>Zakaria show. Number two, Blinken was saying that there</p>
<p>was no change in the American position, and there would be no</p>
<p>change. He said, these are all public statements, that the US</p>
<p>would never recognize the Russian annexation of Crimea</p>
<p>never. You know, he said that we went into these peace talks to</p>
<p>represent our core values, there&rsquo;s no change on that. So</p>
<p>in other words, it&rsquo;s been the position of the United States to</p>
<p>be hardline with Russia to basically engage in no</p>
<p>compromise whatsoever. And it&rsquo;s basically a double down, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>double down. You assume, David, you don&rsquo;t know, those are the</p>
<p>public statements. I know, but you&rsquo;re assuming that there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>back channels going on. And just to just I wanted to make</p>
<p>one quick point, Chamath, which was, you know, what if we offer</p>
<p>to take the sanctions off, and then we are training Putin that</p>
<p>these kind of misadventures, get him something, Don Bass, etc.</p>
<p>And that the sanctions roll off. So isn&rsquo;t there a possibility</p>
<p>Chamath, that if we don&rsquo;t keep the sanctions up, we&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>rewarding his behavior?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge guys. Look, I&rsquo;ve been the first person in the front of</p>
<p>the line on sanctions. I thought this was the most brilliant</p>
<p>approach to this whole thing. And I still believe that</p>
<p>sanctions work. And I think that this will cripple that country.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying, though, is that there are these moments where</p>
<p>instead of then sticking to the rhetoric that Tony talked about</p>
<p>what he said, I don&rsquo;t know, Brad, where Tony said this, this</p>
<p>weekend, but like, sticking to that, there are these added</p>
<p>flourishes that I think are unnecessary. So what I mean by</p>
<p>that is the talk about, you know, us reacting, or</p>
<p>retaliating for the use of chemical weapons. Biden made a</p>
<p>campaign vow, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember this about</p>
<p>nuclear weapons, where, you know, he was very clear that,</p>
<p>you know, it is a mechanism to demonstrate that this deterrence</p>
<p>exists. And instead, he actually caved. And instead, he put out</p>
<p>this carefully worded statement, which kind of walked back the</p>
<p>campaign vow earlier this week, and I&rsquo;ll just read it to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just read what the Wall Street Journal said. It said,</p>
<p>by President Biden, stepping back from a campaign vow, has</p>
<p>embraced the long standing us approach of using the threat of</p>
<p>a potential nuclear response to deter conventional and other</p>
<p>nuclear dangers in addition to nuclear ones. During the 2020</p>
<p>campaign, Biden promised to work towards a policy in which the</p>
<p>sole purpose of us nuclear, the nuclear arsenal would be to</p>
<p>deter or respond to an enemy nuclear attack. Instead, now it</p>
<p>holds that the fundamental role of the nuclear arsenal will be</p>
<p>to deter, but that it leaves the opening to respond and use it in</p>
<p>extreme circumstances. So these are big changes. And if our</p>
<p>whole goal is to just focus the service area to an economic set</p>
<p>of sanctions, these are somewhat unnecessary. Would we all agree</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need to talk about nuclear policy. Yeah, Biden was</p>
<p>right on the campaign trail, the United States of America should</p>
<p>never use nukes, except if nukes are used on us. Come on, we know</p>
<p>that. Yeah. And we&rsquo;re talking about changing that now. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>insane. No, we changed it. We changed. Look, it shows that</p>
<p>there there&rsquo;s an influence in our government, our State</p>
<p>Department of certain hardline elements who want this very</p>
<p>tough policy that includes destabilizing the Russian regime</p>
<p>and maybe toppling Putin. I&rsquo;m just saying that objective is</p>
<p>not worth all the existential risks that we&rsquo;re now facing.</p>
<p>All right, do we want to touch on the CCP tax cuts? We want to</p>
<p>wrap we&rsquo;re at 80 minutes.</p>
<p>I mean, the the CCP tax cuts harkens me back, Brad, you can</p>
<p>react to this because you lived it with me. 2018 19. I&rsquo;ll say it</p>
<p>again, we were in this unique moment where, you know, we were</p>
<p>not sure whether there was runaway rampant inflation. And</p>
<p>in q4 of 2018. The Fed basically said, Okay, you got us, you</p>
<p>know, the boogeyman exists, we&rsquo;re gonna go tame inflation,</p>
<p>and they ran forward and raised rates. And lo and behold, the</p>
<p>Chinese economy turned over in q1 of 2019. We had like a, you</p>
<p>know, kind of a blippy little recession. And we had to</p>
<p>overcome it, because China became stimulative. Now, here we</p>
<p>are, again, we&rsquo;re worried about this inflationary boogeyman. And</p>
<p>the Chinese government basically extended these tax cuts,</p>
<p>increased the tax cuts, and essentially said, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be very stimulative in the economy, especially through the</p>
<p>back half of the year. Now, China, again, is a massively</p>
<p>export driven economy, right? So the reality is that as goes</p>
<p>China, so goes the rest of our economies. And so I think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a setup where how can the United States be under so much</p>
<p>inflationary pressure, where China is effectively telling you</p>
<p>that we are in a, in a contraction and a recessionary</p>
<p>period. And so, if that&rsquo;s where China is, there&rsquo;s a risk that we</p>
<p>may already be there or entering that. And so I think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little, you know,</p>
<p>contorted, you hit two really important points. Number one,</p>
<p>which we didn&rsquo;t get to earlier. I tweeted a few weeks ago, the</p>
<p>Fed&rsquo;s probably behind the curve on recession, not inflation.</p>
<p>Right? We have massive demand destruction going on right now</p>
<p>in the US economy.</p>
<p>Massive</p>
<p>the producer</p>
<p>define what that means, Brad, define what that means.</p>
<p>So I mean, if you just think about what a $6 gas mean, what</p>
<p>is no stimmy checks mean? What is the fact that you actually</p>
<p>have to go and get a job again mean, you know, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>rolling back trillions of dollars off the Fed balance</p>
<p>sheet, I&rsquo;ll tell you what it means is that people can&rsquo;t spend</p>
<p>as much money. Just the increase in the 30 year mortgage means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re buying power in December four months ago, to buy a house</p>
<p>and you if you could afford 1200 bucks a month that buying power</p>
<p>budget $350,000 house today, it buys you a $295,000 house</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s ability, right to have money to spend money is getting</p>
<p>crushed. So I think we are going to face an economic slowdown. If</p>
<p>you look at the PMI. So this was the inflation read in January,</p>
<p>little people didn&rsquo;t really notice it. PMI in January came</p>
<p>in at point two versus the consensus estimate estimate of</p>
<p>point six. That means the producer level of inflation was</p>
<p>meaningfully less than we expected. If you look at</p>
<p>consumer confidence, it&rsquo;s plummeted one of the four</p>
<p>biggest drawdowns over the last 20 years, retail sales in UK</p>
<p>this morning crashing consumer confidence in the UK crashing</p>
<p>the Chinese government sees this we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re not surprised to look</p>
<p>at the what&rsquo;s going on in the world with energy prices. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never had oil over 120 bucks and not gone into a recession. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>facing a global slowdown. That will have big implications for</p>
<p>inflation big implications for rates. But China sees this</p>
<p>coming and says we&rsquo;re going to get ahead of this. We&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s Congress in November, we promised him five and a half</p>
<p>percent GDP growth. 3 trillion of that is export driven. That</p>
<p>means if Europe and the United States catches a cold, they</p>
<p>catch the flu. Okay, so they have to do everything in their</p>
<p>power. This is why they&rsquo;re not going to supply the Russians</p>
<p>with weapons, right? Because it&rsquo;s economically assassinated</p>
<p>themselves. Right? So we have this interconnected world, this</p>
<p>idea that we&rsquo;re de globalizing, what we do doesn&rsquo;t impact</p>
<p>anybody else like that ship is sailed a long time ago. And the</p>
<p>Chinese see this. That&rsquo;s why I think there&rsquo;s also a probability</p>
<p>by the Middle East this summer, the Fed in the United States is</p>
<p>saying we now see a balanced risk between growth and</p>
<p>inflation.</p>
<p>sacks, let&rsquo;s get you in on this. Just as we wrap here, the</p>
<p>Chinese Communist Party premier talked about tax custs. And this</p>
<p>is a quote fertilizer applied directly to the roots of the</p>
<p>economy tax rebates look like reductions, but actually are an</p>
<p>addition. Today, give back tomorrow, you get more in</p>
<p>returns. Does this mean the United States, people will go</p>
<p>back and get jobs because they need to have more money and that</p>
<p>maybe we should be looking at, you know, tax cuts at some</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>Listen, Jake, I think we got big problems here at home in the</p>
<p>United States, Brad and Chamath, they&rsquo;ve laid out these gigantic</p>
<p>economic risks that are facing the country. You know, I tweeted</p>
<p>at the beginning of the year, January 24. The President&rsquo;s main</p>
<p>job is to ensure peace and prosperity. And Biden&rsquo;s</p>
<p>popularity was already plummeting. I think this is when</p>
<p>his poll numbers were at 38%. But if he gets us into war and</p>
<p>recession, he ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet. This war, the longer it</p>
<p>drags on, the longer it basically can spin out of</p>
<p>control and become something worse that sucks us in, the</p>
<p>longer it creates the risk of basically causing a recession in</p>
<p>the United States. We need the American we need the Biden</p>
<p>administration to help try and lead to a better outcome here</p>
<p>instead of ratcheting up the rhetoric.</p>
<p>All right, folks, there you have it. That&rsquo;s your all in podcast</p>
<p>for this week. Thanks so much to Brad Gerstner for joining us and</p>
<p>filling in for the Sultan of Science BG. Thanks, bro. And a</p>
<p>lot of great announcements here. Brad will also be joining us for</p>
<p>the all in summit. We&rsquo;re about to wrap up tickets. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>announced a bunch of great speakers for the event may 1516</p>
<p>and 17 in Miami. You can just do a search for the all in summit.</p>
<p>We have given out. We&rsquo;ve sent 200 emails to people who asked</p>
<p>for scholarships and 100 of them have taken the tickets. 500 of</p>
<p>the 650 tickets or so are accounted for we&rsquo;ll be wrapping</p>
<p>up registration in the next week or two. And we look forward to</p>
<p>seeing you all at the New World Symphony in South Beach.</p>
<p>You got any announcements of people who else is appearing? Oh</p>
<p>my lord, we have great announcements keys were boy is</p>
<p>coming. Joe Lonsdale is coming. Nate Silver is coming.</p>
<p>Nate Silver. I love Nate Silver.</p>
<p>Well, we decided Chamath we would have people do 15 to 20</p>
<p>minute, Ted style talks like position papers. And so who</p>
<p>else do we have doing that? Tim urban of weight but why he was a</p>
<p>brilliant speaker and writer. Nate Silver is going to do that.</p>
<p>And then Antonio is coming. He was just on. And he was just on</p>
<p>Rogan show. And so we&rsquo;re going to have these like 20 minute</p>
<p>kind of hits, then the besties will sit with them. We&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>those back to back. Kimball Musk is going to come and talk about</p>
<p>his DAO that he&rsquo;s doing for nonprofits, Brad, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>talk about what topics so we&rsquo;re collecting all this talent, and</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll figure out what positions are going to play in</p>
<p>the show, and what the themes will be. But the themes will</p>
<p>match what we&rsquo;ve been talking about here. And we don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>pre set the themes six or seven weeks, seven weeks out from the</p>
<p>event, because we don&rsquo;t know what the world will look like</p>
<p>then. And then Freeberg said he wanted to do a position paper</p>
<p>and actually give a 20 minute talk. So besties will have that</p>
<p>ability. And besties will start the event and any event, tons of</p>
<p>different speakers rotating in and out talking about the most</p>
<p>important topics of our time, but I would like to have Peter</p>
<p>there. Can you get Peter to come? He&rsquo;s maybe the most</p>
<p>iconoclastic, please. I&rsquo;m just not I&rsquo;m just not I have to get</p>
<p>over my uncertainty that this whole conference thing is really</p>
<p>a grift. It&rsquo;s not a grift. We&rsquo;re putting all the money is going</p>
<p>back into the event. And we gave 200 scholarships, there&rsquo;ll be no</p>
<p>profit from the</p>
<p>there needs to be a really nice swag bag. And I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>already at $600 a person I just spent three or 400. What is the</p>
<p>material of the hoodie? All right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be a cashmere hoodie if to be on brand.</p>
<p>To be able to buy up to the to the special hoodie,</p>
<p>Brad, I just spent $600,000 per gift bag for 600 gift bags. Okay,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 400 grand and gift bags. And Chamath wants to put a</p>
<p>$6,000. So I just wanted to know what the material was of the</p>
<p>hoodie in the bag. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m just asking. This is my</p>
<p>life, Brad, I am busting my ass to put this event on and</p>
<p>complaining about the gift bag. sax is complaining on me making</p>
<p>a dollar from it. And freebergs having a panic attack that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough great speakers. And I&rsquo;m doing all the</p>
<p>work. It&rsquo;s my whole fucking life. I appreciate you, Jacob.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say some nice stuff to me. You did say some nice</p>
<p>stuff. I want to get on board with you getting a fee for your</p>
<p>hard work. You know, I don&rsquo;t need an hourly wage, you know,</p>
<p>$15 an hour. I&rsquo;m not your wage slave, David Sachs. I&rsquo;m working</p>
<p>hard here. Working hard, but I just want to be appreciated. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think you should have like a cotton blend is my I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>safer.</p>
<p>By the way, Brad, do you have any thoughts on the sushi? Is</p>
<p>there should we be using brown rice and not the line caught</p>
<p>tuna?</p>
<p>No, just make sure there&rsquo;s gold leaf on the sushi.</p>
<p>No, literally, we&rsquo;re spending, I think, for 300 or 400,000 per</p>
<p>party. It&rsquo;s over a million dollars in parties. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking to talent bookers about serious talent coming to</p>
<p>perform. Drake, can you get drink? How about that&rsquo;s $3</p>
<p>million. dual depot $2 million. I&rsquo;m deep in $2 million. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I got. How much is doja cat? She&rsquo;s great. I think those</p>
<p>are all seven figures. I would like to anyway, what I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to use use of that. I mean, that would make it an incredible</p>
<p>party. Oh, God. I mean, I really would like to get by. So how</p>
<p>much is Drake again? $2 million. I heard for 20 bags and get</p>
<p>Drake. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cancel the bag. Give it all to Drake.</p>
<p>So you guys are saying and all the work I do, I should take $2</p>
<p>million and hand it to fucking Drake. Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Drake is more valuable than you 25 years of working on events</p>
<p>and media Brad. And these these are my friends. We&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>take the $2 million put in your pocket and finally make a profit</p>
<p>on your work. And just hand $2 million in a bag.</p>
<p>Drake, we don&rsquo;t need the bag.</p>
<p>Plane.</p>
<p>Jet card. Do we get to work with Drake on which songs he&rsquo;s he</p>
<p>would sing?</p>
<p>He does like a medley of like three what I would like to do</p>
<p>is have three songs for two. Come on. I think it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>like 100,000 a minute. I think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re in for 100,000</p>
<p>per minute. 20 minutes.</p>
<p>That seems egregious. No, I mean, these guys get paid bang</p>
<p>when I hired Snoop. He did like 20 songs for me. I mean, it was</p>
<p>unbelievable. And what was that two or three hours show? 300?</p>
<p>Sax because he forgot he was there. Yeah, he had a great</p>
<p>time. Oh my god, man. He was blowing this joint that was so</p>
