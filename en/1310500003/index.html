    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>You&rsquo;ve studied the human mind, cognition, language, vision, evolution, psychology,</p>
<p>from child to adult, from the level of individual to the level of our entire civilization.</p>
<p>So I feel like I can start with a simple multiple choice question.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life? Is it A. to attain knowledge as Plato said,</p>
<p>B. to attain power as Nietzsche said, C. to escape death as Ernest Becker said,</p>
<p>D. to propagate our genes as Darwin and others have said,</p>
<p>E. there is no meaning as the nihilists have said,</p>
<p>F. knowing the meaning of life is beyond our cognitive capabilities as Stephen Pinker said,</p>
<p>based on my interpretation 20 years ago, and G. none of the above.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say A. comes closest, but I would amend that to</p>
<p>C. to attaining not only knowledge but fulfillment more generally, that is life, health, stimulation,</p>
<p>access to the living cultural and social world.</p>
<p>Now this is our meaning of life. It&rsquo;s not the meaning of life if you were to ask our genes.</p>
<p>Their meaning is to propagate copies of themselves, but that is distinct from the</p>
<p>meaning that the brain that they lead to sets for itself.</p>
<p>So to you knowledge is a small subset or a large subset?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a large subset, but it&rsquo;s not the entirety of human striving because we also want to</p>
<p>interact with people. We want to experience beauty. We want to experience the richness</p>
<p>of the natural world, but understanding what makes the universe tick is way up there.</p>
<p>For some of us more than others, certainly for me that&rsquo;s one of the top five.</p>
<p>So is that a fundamental aspect? Are you just describing your own preference or is this a</p>
<p>fundamental aspect of human nature is to seek knowledge? In your latest book you talk about</p>
<p>the power, the usefulness of rationality and reason and so on. Is that a fundamental</p>
<p>nature of human beings or is it something we should just strive for?</p>
<p>Both. We&rsquo;re capable of striving for it because it is one of the things that make us what we are,</p>
<p>homo sapiens, wise men. We are unusual among animals in the degree to which we acquire</p>
<p>knowledge and use it to survive. We make tools. We strike agreements via language. We extract</p>
<p>poisons. We predict the behavior of animals. We try to get at the workings of plants.</p>
<p>And when I say we, I don&rsquo;t just mean we in the modern West, but we as a species everywhere,</p>
<p>which is how we&rsquo;ve managed to occupy every niche on the planet, how we&rsquo;ve managed to drive other</p>
<p>animals to extinction. And the refinement of reason in pursuit of human wellbeing, of health,</p>
<p>happiness, social richness, cultural richness is our main challenge in the present. That is</p>
<p>using our intellect, using our knowledge to figure out how the world works, how we work</p>
<p>in order to make discoveries and strike agreements that make us all better off in the long run.</p>
<p>Right. And you do that almost undeniably and in a data driven way in your recent book,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to focus on the artificial intelligence aspect of things and not just</p>
<p>artificial intelligence, but natural intelligence too. So 20 years ago in a book you&rsquo;ve written on</p>
<p>how the mind works, you conjecture again, am I right to interpret things? You can correct me</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m wrong, but you conjecture that human thought in the brain may be a result of a</p>
<p>massive network of highly interconnected neurons. So from this interconnectivity emerges thought</p>
<p>compared to artificial neural networks, which we use for machine learning today,</p>
<p>is there something fundamentally more complex, mysterious, even magical about the biological</p>
<p>neural networks versus the ones we&rsquo;ve been starting to use over the past 60 years and</p>
<p>have become to success in the past 10? There is something a little bit mysterious</p>
<p>about the human neural networks, which is that each one of us who is a neural network knows that</p>
<p>we ourselves are conscious. Conscious not in the sense of registering our surroundings or even</p>
<p>registering our internal state, but in having subjective first person, present tense experience.</p>
<p>That is when I see red, it&rsquo;s not just different from green, but there&rsquo;s a redness to it that I</p>
<p>feel. Whether an artificial system would experience that or not, I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t think I can</p>
<p>know. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s mysterious. If we had a perfectly lifelike robot that was behaviorally</p>
<p>indistinguishable from a human, would we attribute consciousness to it or ought we to attribute</p>
<p>consciousness to it? And that&rsquo;s something that it&rsquo;s very hard to know. But putting that aside,</p>
<p>putting aside that largely philosophical question, the question is, is there some difference between</p>
<p>the human neural network and the ones that we&rsquo;re building in artificial intelligence will mean</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re on the current trajectory, not going to reach the point where we&rsquo;ve got a lifelike</p>
<p>robot indistinguishable from a human because the way their so called neural networks are organized</p>
<p>are different from the way ours are organized. I think there&rsquo;s overlap, but I think there are</p>
<p>some big differences that current neural networks, current so called deep learning systems are in</p>
<p>reality not all that deep. That is, they are very good at extracting high order statistical</p>
<p>regularities, but most of the systems don&rsquo;t have a semantic level, a level of actual understanding</p>
<p>of who did what to whom, why, where, how things work, what causes what else. Do you think that</p>
<p>kind of thing can emerge as it does? So artificial neural networks are much smaller, the number of</p>
<p>connections and so on than the current human biological networks, but do you think sort of</p>
<p>to go to consciousness or to go to this higher level semantic reasoning about things, do you</p>
<p>think that can emerge with just a larger network with a more richly weirdly interconnected network?</p>
<p>Separate it in consciousness because consciousness is even a matter of complexity.</p>
<p>A really weird one.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could sensibly ask the question of whether shrimp are conscious, for example,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not terribly complex, but maybe they feel pain. So let&rsquo;s just put that part of it aside.</p>
<p>But I think sheer size of a neural network is not enough to give it structure and knowledge,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s suitably engineered, then why not? That is, we&rsquo;re neural networks, natural selection</p>
<p>did a kind of equivalent of engineering of our brains. So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything mysterious</p>
<p>in the sense that no system made out of silicon could ever do what a human brain can do. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible in principle. Whether it&rsquo;ll ever happen depends not only on how clever we are</p>
<p>in engineering these systems, but whether we even want to, whether that&rsquo;s even a sensible goal.</p>
<p>That is, you can ask the question, is there any locomotion system that is as good as a human?</p>
<p>Well, we kind of want to do better than a human ultimately in terms of legged locomotion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason that humans should be our benchmark. They&rsquo;re tools that might be better</p>
<p>in some ways. It may be that we can&rsquo;t duplicate a natural system because at some point it&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>cheaper to use a natural system that we&rsquo;re not going to invest more brainpower and resources.</p>
<p>So for example, we don&rsquo;t really have an exact substitute for wood. We still build houses out</p>
<p>of wood. We still build furniture out of wood. We like the look. We like the feel. It has certain</p>
<p>properties that synthetics don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s anything magical or mysterious about wood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the extra steps of duplicating everything about wood is something we just haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bothered because we have wood. Likewise, say cotton. I&rsquo;m wearing cotton clothing now. It feels</p>
<p>much better than polyester. It&rsquo;s not that cotton has something magic in it. It&rsquo;s not that we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever synthesize something exactly like cotton, but at some point it&rsquo;s just not worth it. We&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>cotton. Likewise, in the case of human intelligence, the goal of making an artificial system that is</p>
<p>exactly like the human brain is a goal that we probably know is going to pursue to the bitter</p>
<p>end, I suspect, because if you want tools that do things better than humans, you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>care whether it does something like humans. So for example, diagnosing cancer or predicting the</p>
<p>weather, why set humans as your benchmark? But in general, I suspect you also believe</p>
<p>that even if the human should not be a benchmark and we don&rsquo;t want to imitate humans in their</p>
<p>system, there&rsquo;s a lot to be learned about how to create an artificial intelligence system by</p>
<p>studying the human. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s right. In the same way that to build flying machines,</p>
<p>we want to understand the laws of aerodynamics, including birds, but not mimic the birds,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re the same laws. You have a view on AI, artificial intelligence, and safety</p>
<p>that, from my perspective, is refreshingly rational or perhaps more importantly, has elements</p>
<p>of positivity to it, which I think can be inspiring and empowering as opposed to paralyzing.</p>
<p>For many people, including AI researchers, the eventual existential threat of AI is obvious,</p>
<p>not only possible, but obvious. And for many others, including AI researchers, the threat</p>
<p>is not obvious. So Elon Musk is famously in the highly concerned about AI camp, saying things like</p>
<p>AI is far more dangerous than nuclear weapons, and that AI will likely destroy human civilization.</p>
<p>Human civilization. So in February, he said that if Elon was really serious about AI, the threat</p>
<p>of AI, he would stop building self driving cars that he&rsquo;s doing very successfully as part of Tesla.</p>
<p>Then he said, wow, if even Pinker doesn&rsquo;t understand the difference between narrow AI,</p>
<p>like a car and general AI, when the latter literally has a million times more compute power</p>
<p>and an open ended utility function, humanity is in deep trouble. So first, what did you mean by</p>
<p>the statement about Elon Musk should stop building self driving cars if he&rsquo;s deeply concerned?</p>
<p>Not the last time that Elon Musk has fired off an intemperate tweet.</p>
<p>Well, we live in a world where Twitter has power.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah, I think there are two kinds of existential threat that have been discussed</p>
<p>in connection with artificial intelligence, and I think that they&rsquo;re both incoherent.</p>
<p>One of them is a vague fear of AI takeover, that just as we subjugated animals and less technologically</p>
<p>advanced peoples, so if we build something that&rsquo;s more advanced than us, it will inevitably turn us</p>
<p>into pets or slaves or domesticated animal equivalents. I think this confuses intelligence</p>
<p>with a will to power, that it so happens that in the intelligence system we are most familiar with,</p>
<p>namely homo sapiens, we are products of natural selection, which is a competitive process,</p>
<p>and so bundled together with our problem solving capacity are a number of nasty traits like</p>
<p>dominance and exploitation and maximization of power and glory and resources and influence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to think that sheer problem solving capability will set that as one of its</p>
<p>goals. Its goals will be whatever we set its goals as, and as long as someone isn&rsquo;t building a</p>
<p>megalomaniacal artificial intelligence, then there&rsquo;s no reason to think that it would naturally</p>
<p>evolve in that direction. Now, you might say, well, what if we gave it the goal of maximizing</p>
<p>its own power source? That&rsquo;s a pretty stupid goal to give an autonomous system. You don&rsquo;t give it</p>
<p>that goal. I mean, that&rsquo;s just self evidently idiotic. So if you look at the history of the</p>
<p>world, there&rsquo;s been a lot of opportunities where engineers could instill in a system</p>
<p>destructive power and they choose not to because that&rsquo;s the natural process of engineering.</p>
<p>Well, except for weapons. I mean, if you&rsquo;re building a weapon, its goal is to destroy people,</p>
<p>and so I think there are good reasons to not build certain kinds of weapons. I think building</p>
<p>nuclear weapons was a massive mistake. You do. So maybe pause on that because that is one of</p>
<p>the serious threats. Do you think that it was a mistake in a sense that it should have been</p>
<p>stopped early on? Or do you think it&rsquo;s just an unfortunate event of invention that this was</p>
<p>invented? Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to stop? I guess is the question. It&rsquo;s hard to rewind the</p>
<p>clock because of course it was invented in the context of World War II and the fear that the</p>
<p>Nazis might develop one first. Then once it was initiated for that reason, it was hard to turn</p>
<p>off, especially since winning the war against the Japanese and the Nazis was such an overwhelming</p>
<p>goal of every responsible person that there&rsquo;s just nothing that people wouldn&rsquo;t have done then</p>
<p>to ensure victory. It&rsquo;s quite possible if World War II hadn&rsquo;t happened that nuclear weapons</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have been invented. We can&rsquo;t know, but I don&rsquo;t think it was by any means a necessity,</p>
<p>any more than some of the other weapon systems that were envisioned but never implemented,</p>
<p>like planes that would disperse poison gas over cities like crop dusters or systems to try to</p>
<p>create earthquakes and tsunamis in enemy countries, to weaponize the weather,</p>
<p>weaponize solar flares, all kinds of crazy schemes that we thought the better of.</p>
<p>I think analogies between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence are fundamentally</p>
<p>misguided because the whole point of nuclear weapons is to destroy things. The point of</p>
<p>artificial intelligence is not to destroy things. So the analogy is misleading.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two artificial intelligence you mentioned. The first one I guess is highly</p>
<p>intelligent or power hungry.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a system that we design ourselves where we give it the goals. Goals are external to</p>
<p>the means to attain the goals. If we don&rsquo;t design an artificially intelligent system to</p>
<p>maximize dominance, then it won&rsquo;t maximize dominance. It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re so familiar</p>
<p>with homo sapiens where these two traits come bundled together, particularly in men,</p>
<p>that we are apt to confuse high intelligence with a will to power, but that&rsquo;s just an error.</p>
<p>The other fear is that will be collateral damage that will give artificial intelligence a goal</p>
<p>like make paper clips and it will pursue that goal so brilliantly that before we can stop it,</p>
<p>it turns us into paper clips. We&rsquo;ll give it the goal of curing cancer and it will turn us into</p>
<p>guinea pigs for lethal experiments or give it the goal of world peace and its conception of world</p>
<p>peace is no people, therefore no fighting and so it will kill us all. Now I think these are utterly</p>
<p>fanciful. In fact, I think they&rsquo;re actually self defeating. They first of all assume that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be so brilliant that we can design an artificial intelligence that can cure cancer,</p>
<p>but so stupid that we don&rsquo;t specify what we mean by curing cancer in enough detail that it won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>kill us in the process and it assumes that the system will be so smart that it can cure cancer,</p>
<p>but so idiotic that it can&rsquo;t figure out that what we mean by curing cancer is not killing everyone.</p>
<p>I think that the collateral damage scenario, the value alignment problem is also based on</p>
<p>a misconception. So one of the challenges, of course, we don&rsquo;t know how to build either system</p>
<p>currently or are we even close to knowing? Of course, those things can change overnight,</p>
<p>but at this time, theorizing about it is very challenging in either direction. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably at the core of the problem is without that ability to reason about the real engineering</p>
<p>things here at hand is your imagination runs away with things. Exactly. But let me sort of ask,</p>
<p>what do you think was the motivation, the thought process of Elon Musk? I build autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>I study autonomous vehicles, I study Tesla autopilot. I think it is one of the greatest</p>
<p>currently large scale application of artificial intelligence in the world. It has potentially a</p>
<p>very positive impact on society. So how does a person who&rsquo;s creating this very good quote unquote</p>
<p>narrow AI system also seem to be so concerned about this other general AI? What do you think</p>
<p>is the motivation there? What do you think is the thing? Well, you probably have to ask him,</p>
<p>but there, and he is notoriously flamboyant, impulsive to the, as we have just seen,</p>
<p>to the detriment of his own goals of the health of the company. So I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in his mind. You probably have to ask him, but I don&rsquo;t think the, and I don&rsquo;t think the distinction</p>
<p>between special purpose AI and so called general AI is relevant that in the same way that special</p>
<p>purpose AI is not going to do anything conceivable in order to attain a goal. All engineering systems</p>
<p>are designed to trade off across multiple goals. When we build cars in the first place,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t forget to install brakes because the goal of a car is to go fast. It occurred to people,</p>
<p>yes, you want it to go fast, but not always. So you would build in brakes too. Likewise,</p>
<p>if a car is going to be autonomous and program it to take the shortest route to the airport,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to take the diagonal and mow down people and trees and fences because that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>shortest route. That&rsquo;s not what we mean by the shortest route when we program it. And that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>what an intelligence system is by definition. It takes into account multiple constraints.</p>
<p>The same is true, in fact, even more true of so called general intelligence. That is,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s genuinely intelligent, it&rsquo;s not going to pursue some goal singlemindedly, omitting every</p>
<p>other consideration and collateral effect. That&rsquo;s not artificial and general intelligence. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>artificial stupidity. I agree with you, by the way, on the promise of autonomous vehicles for</p>
<p>improving human welfare. I think it&rsquo;s spectacular. And I&rsquo;m surprised at how little press coverage</p>
<p>notes that in the United States alone, something like 40,000 people die every year on the highways,</p>
<p>vastly more than are killed by terrorists. And we spent a trillion dollars on a war to combat</p>
<p>deaths by terrorism, about half a dozen a year. Whereas year in, year out, 40,000 people are</p>
<p>massacred on the highways, which could be brought down to very close to zero. So I&rsquo;m with you on</p>
<p>the humanitarian benefit. Let me just mention that as a person who&rsquo;s building these cars,</p>
<p>it is a little bit offensive to me to say that engineers would be clueless enough not to engineer</p>
<p>safety into systems. I often stay up at night thinking about those 40,000 people that are dying.</p>
<p>And everything I tried to engineer is to save those people&rsquo;s lives. So every new invention that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited about, in all the deep learning literature and CVPR conferences and NIPS, everything</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited about is all grounded in making it safe and help people. So I just don&rsquo;t see how</p>
<p>that trajectory can all of a sudden slip into a situation where intelligence will be highly</p>
<p>negative. You and I certainly agree on that. And I think that&rsquo;s only the beginning of the</p>
<p>potential humanitarian benefits of artificial intelligence. There&rsquo;s been enormous attention to</p>
<p>what are we going to do with the people whose jobs are made obsolete by artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>but very little attention given to the fact that the jobs that are going to be made obsolete are</p>
<p>horrible jobs. The fact that people aren&rsquo;t going to be picking crops and making beds and driving</p>
<p>trucks and mining coal, these are soul deadening jobs. And we have a whole literature sympathizing</p>
<p>with the people stuck in these menial, mind deadening, dangerous jobs. If we can eliminate</p>
<p>them, this is a fantastic boon to humanity. Now granted, you solve one problem and there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>one, namely, how do we get these people a decent income? But if we&rsquo;re smart enough to invent machines</p>
<p>that can make beds and put away dishes and handle hospital patients, I think we&rsquo;re smart enough to</p>
<p>figure out how to redistribute income to apportion some of the vast economic savings to the human</p>
<p>beings who will no longer be needed to make beds. Okay. Sam Harris says that it&rsquo;s obvious that</p>
<p>eventually AI will be an existential risk. He&rsquo;s one of the people who says it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know when the claim goes, but eventually it&rsquo;s obvious. And because we don&rsquo;t know when,</p>
<p>we should worry about it now. This is a very interesting argument in my eyes. So how do we</p>
<p>think about timescale? How do we think about existential threats when we don&rsquo;t really, we know</p>
<p>so little about the threat, unlike nuclear weapons perhaps, about this particular threat, that it</p>
<p>could happen tomorrow, right? So, but very likely it won&rsquo;t. Very likely it&rsquo;d be a hundred years away.</p>
<p>So how do we ignore it? How do we talk about it? Do we worry about it? How do we think about those?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>A threat that we can imagine. It&rsquo;s within the limits of our imagination,</p>
<p>but not within our limits of understanding to accurately predict it.</p>
<p>But what is the it that we&rsquo;re afraid of?</p>
<p>Sorry. AI being the existential threat.</p>
<p>AI. How? Like enslaving us or turning us into paperclips?</p>
<p>I think the most compelling from the Sam Harris perspective would be the paperclip situation.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I just think it&rsquo;s totally fanciful. I mean, that is don&rsquo;t build a system.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give a, don&rsquo;t, first of all, the code of engineering is you don&rsquo;t implement a system with</p>
<p>massive control before testing it. Now, perhaps the culture of engineering will radically change.</p>
<p>Then I would worry, but I don&rsquo;t see any signs that engineers will suddenly do idiotic things,</p>
<p>like put a electric power plant in control of a system that they haven&rsquo;t tested first.</p>
<p>Or all of these scenarios, not only imagine almost a magically powered intelligence,</p>
<p>including things like cure cancer, which is probably an incoherent goal because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many different kinds of cancer or bring about world peace. I mean, how do you even specify that</p>
<p>as a goal? But the scenarios also imagine some degree of control of every molecule in the</p>
<p>universe, which not only is itself unlikely, but we would not start to connect these systems to</p>
<p>infrastructure without testing as we would any kind of engineering system.</p>
<p>Now, maybe some engineers will be irresponsible and we need legal and regulatory and legal</p>
<p>responsibility implemented so that engineers don&rsquo;t do things that are stupid by their own standards.</p>
<p>But the, I&rsquo;ve never seen enough of a plausible scenario of existential threat to devote large</p>
<p>amounts of brain power to, to forestall it. So you believe in the sort of the power on</p>
<p>mass of the engineering of reason, as you argue in your latest book of Reason and Science, to sort of</p>
<p>be the very thing that guides the development of new technology so it&rsquo;s safe and also keeps us safe.</p>
<p>You know, granted the same culture of safety that currently is part of the engineering mindset for</p>
<p>airplanes, for example. So yeah, I don&rsquo;t think that that should be thrown out the window and</p>
<p>that untested all powerful systems should be suddenly implemented, but there&rsquo;s no reason to</p>
<p>think they are. And in fact, if you look at the progress of artificial intelligence, it&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s been impressive, especially in the last 10 years or so, but the idea that suddenly</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a step function that all of a sudden before we know it, it will be all powerful,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;ll be some kind of recursive self improvement, some kind of fume is also fanciful.</p>
<p>We, certainly by the technology that we, that we&rsquo;re now impresses us, such as deep learning,</p>
<p>where you train something on hundreds of thousands or millions of examples,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not hundreds of thousands of problems of which curing cancer is a typical example.</p>
<p>And so the kind of techniques that have allowed AI to increase in the last five years are not the</p>
<p>kind that are going to lead to this fantasy of exponential sudden self improvement. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a magical thinking. It&rsquo;s not based on our understanding of how AI actually works.</p>
<p>Now give me a chance here. So you said fanciful, magical thinking. In his TED talk,</p>
<p>Sam Harris says that thinking about AI killing all human civilization is somehow fun,</p>
<p>intellectually. Now I have to say as a scientist engineer, I don&rsquo;t find it fun,</p>
<p>but when I&rsquo;m having beer with my non AI friends, there is indeed something fun and appealing about</p>
<p>it. Like talking about an episode of Black Mirror, considering if a large meteor is headed towards</p>
<p>Earth, we were just told a large meteor is headed towards Earth, something like this. And can you</p>
<p>relate to this sense of fun? And do you understand the psychology of it?</p>
<p>Yes. Good question. I personally don&rsquo;t find it fun. I find it kind of actually a waste of time</p>
<p>because there are genuine threats that we ought to be thinking about like pandemics, like cyber</p>
<p>security vulnerabilities, like the possibility of nuclear war and certainly climate change.</p>
<p>You know, this is enough to fill many conversations. And I think Sam did put his</p>
<p>finger on something, namely that there is a community, sometimes called the rationality</p>
<p>community, that delights in using its brainpower to come up with scenarios that would not occur</p>
<p>to mere mortals, to less cerebral people. So there is a kind of intellectual thrill in finding new</p>
<p>things to worry about that no one has worried about yet. I actually think, though, that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not only is it a kind of fun that doesn&rsquo;t give me particular pleasure, but I think there can be a</p>
<p>pernicious side to it, namely that you overcome people with such dread, such fatalism, that there</p>
<p>are so many ways to die, to annihilate our civilization, that we may as well enjoy life</p>
<p>while we can. There&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it. If climate change doesn&rsquo;t do us in, then runaway</p>
<p>robots will. So let&rsquo;s enjoy ourselves now. We&rsquo;ve got to prioritize. We have to look at threats that</p>
<p>are close to certainty, such as climate change, and distinguish those from ones that are merely</p>
<p>imaginable but with infinitesimal probabilities. And we have to take into account people&rsquo;s worry</p>
<p>budget. You can&rsquo;t worry about everything. And if you sow dread and fear and terror and fatalism,</p>
<p>it can lead to a kind of numbness. Well, these problems are overwhelming, and the engineers are</p>
<p>just going to kill us all. So let&rsquo;s either destroy the entire infrastructure of science, technology,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s just enjoy life while we can. So there&rsquo;s a certain line of worry, which I&rsquo;m worried about</p>
<p>a lot of things in engineering. There&rsquo;s a certain line of worry when you cross, you&rsquo;re allowed to</p>
<p>cross, that it becomes paralyzing fear as opposed to productive fear. And that&rsquo;s kind of what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re highlighting. Exactly right. And we&rsquo;ve seen some, we know that human effort is not</p>
<p>well calibrated against risk in that because a basic tenet of cognitive psychology is that</p>
<p>perception of risk and hence perception of fear is driven by imaginability, not by data. And so we</p>
<p>misallocate vast amounts of resources to avoiding terrorism, which kills on average about six</p>
<p>Americans a year with one exception of 9 11. We invade countries, we invent entire new departments</p>
<p>of government with massive, massive expenditure of resources and lives to defend ourselves against</p>
<p>a trivial risk. Whereas guaranteed risks, one of them you mentioned traffic fatalities and even</p>
<p>risks that are not here, but are plausible enough to worry about like pandemics, like nuclear war,</p>
<p>receive far too little attention. In presidential debates, there&rsquo;s no discussion of how to minimize</p>
<p>the risk of nuclear war. Lots of discussion of terrorism, for example. And so I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>essential to calibrate our budget of fear, worry, concern, planning to the actual probability of</p>
<p>harm. Yep. So let me ask this question. So speaking of imaginability, you said it&rsquo;s important to think</p>
<p>about reason and one of my favorite people who likes to dip into the outskirts of reason through</p>
<p>fascinating exploration of his imagination is Joe Rogan. Oh yes. So who has through reason used to</p>
<p>believe a lot of conspiracies and through reason has stripped away a lot of his beliefs in that</p>
<p>way. So it&rsquo;s fascinating actually to watch him through rationality kind of throw away the ideas</p>
<p>of Bigfoot and 9 11. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly. Kim Trails. I don&rsquo;t know what he believes in. Yes.</p>
<p>Okay. But he no longer believed in. No, that&rsquo;s right. No, he&rsquo;s become a real force for good.</p>
<p>Yep. So you were on the Joe Rogan podcast in February and had a fascinating conversation,</p>
<p>but as far as I remember, didn&rsquo;t talk much about artificial intelligence. I will be on his podcast</p>
<p>in a couple of weeks. Joe is very much concerned about existential threat of AI. I&rsquo;m not sure if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, this is why I was hoping that you would get into that topic. And in this way,</p>
<p>he represents quite a lot of people who look at the topic of AI from 10,000 foot level.</p>
<p>So as an exercise of communication, you said it&rsquo;s important to be rational and reason</p>
<p>about these things. Let me ask, if you were to coach me as an AI researcher about how to speak</p>
<p>to Joe and the general public about AI, what would you advise? Well, the short answer would be to</p>
<p>read the sections that I wrote in enlightenment now about AI, but a longer reason would be I</p>
<p>think to emphasize, and I think you&rsquo;re very well positioned as an engineer to remind people about</p>
<p>the culture of engineering, that it really is safety oriented, that another discussion in</p>
<p>enlightenment now, I plot rates of accidental death from various causes, plane crashes, car</p>
<p>crashes, occupational accidents, even death by lightning strikes. And they all plummet because</p>
<p>the culture of engineering is how do you squeeze out the lethal risks, death by fire, death by</p>
<p>drowning, death by asphyxiation, all of them drastically declined because of advances in</p>
<p>engineering that I got to say, I did not appreciate until I saw those graphs. And it is because</p>
<p>exactly, people like you who stay up at night thinking, oh my God, is what I&rsquo;m inventing likely</p>
<p>to hurt people and to deploy ingenuity to prevent that from happening. Now, I&rsquo;m not an engineer,</p>
<p>although I spent 22 years at MIT, so I know something about the culture of engineering.</p>
<p>My understanding is that this is the way you think if you&rsquo;re an engineer. And it&rsquo;s essential</p>
<p>that that culture not be suddenly switched off when it comes to artificial intelligence. So,</p>
<p>I mean, that could be a problem, but is there any reason to think it would be switched off?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. And one, there&rsquo;s not enough engineers speaking up for this</p>
<p>way, for the excitement, for the positive view of human nature, what you&rsquo;re trying to create</p>
<p>is positivity. Like everything we try to invent is trying to do good for the world.</p>
<p>But let me ask you about the psychology of negativity. It seems just objectively,</p>
<p>not considering the topic, it seems that being negative about the future makes you sound smarter</p>
<p>than being positive about the future, irregardless of topic. Am I correct in this observation? And</p>
<p>if so, why do you think that is? Yeah, I think there is that phenomenon that,</p>
<p>as Tom Lehrer, the satirist said, always predict the worst and you&rsquo;ll be hailed as a prophet.</p>
<p>It may be part of our overall negativity bias. We are as a species more attuned to the negative</p>
<p>than the positive. We dread losses more than we enjoy gains. And that might open up a space for</p>
<p>prophets to remind us of harms and risks and losses that we may have overlooked.</p>
<p>So I think there is that asymmetry. So you&rsquo;ve written some of my favorite books</p>
<p>all over the place. So starting from Enlightenment Now to The Better Ages of Our Nature,</p>
<p>Blank Slate, How the Mind Works, the one about language, Language Instinct. Bill Gates,</p>
<p>big fan too, said of your most recent book that it&rsquo;s my new favorite book of all time.</p>
<p>So for you as an author, what was a book early on in your life that had a profound impact on the</p>
<p>way you saw the world? Certainly this book, Enlightenment Now, was influenced by David</p>
<p>Deutsch&rsquo;s The Beginning of Infinity, a rather deep reflection on knowledge and the power of</p>
<p>knowledge to improve the human condition. And with bits of wisdom such as that problems are</p>
<p>inevitable but problems are solvable given the right knowledge and that solutions create new</p>
<p>problems that have to be solved in their turn. That&rsquo;s I think a kind of wisdom about the human</p>
<p>condition that influenced the writing of this book. There are some books that are excellent</p>
<p>but obscure, some of which I have on a page on my website. I read a book called The History of Force,</p>
<p>self published by a political scientist named James Payne on the historical decline of violence</p>
<p>and that was one of the inspirations for The Better Angels of Our Nature.</p>
<p>What about early on? If you look back when you were maybe a teenager?</p>
<p>I loved a book called One, Two, Three, Infinity. When I was a young adult I read that book by</p>
<p>George Gamow, the physicist, which had very accessible and humorous explanations of</p>
<p>relativity, of number theory, of dimensionality, high multiple dimensional spaces in a way that I</p>
<p>think is still delightful 70 years after it was published. I like the Time Life Science series.</p>
<p>These are books that would arrive every month that my mother subscribed to, each one on a different</p>
<p>topic. One would be on electricity, one would be on forests, one would be on evolution and then one</p>
<p>was on the mind. I was just intrigued that there could be a science of mind and that book I would</p>
<p>cite as an influence as well. Then later on&hellip; That&rsquo;s when you fell in love with the idea of</p>
<p>studying the mind? Was that the thing that grabbed you? It was one of the things I would say. I read</p>
<p>as a college student the book Reflections on Language by Noam Chomsky. I spent most of his</p>
<p>career here at MIT. Richard Dawkins, two books, The Blind Watchmaker and The Selfish Gene,</p>
<p>were enormously influential, mainly for the content but also for the writing style, the</p>
<p>ability to explain abstract concepts in lively prose. Stephen Jay Gould&rsquo;s first collection,</p>
<p>Ever Since Darwin, also an excellent example of lively writing. George Miller, a psychologist that</p>
<p>most psychologists are familiar with, came up with the idea that human memory has a capacity of</p>
<p>seven plus or minus two chunks. That&rsquo;s probably his biggest claim to fame. But he wrote a couple</p>
<p>of books on language and communication that I read as an undergraduate. Again, beautifully written</p>
<p>and intellectually deep. Wonderful. Stephen, thank you so much for taking the time today.</p>
<p>My pleasure. Thanks a lot, Lex.</p>
