<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>everyone having another special guest</p>
<p>with you today we have a medical doctor</p>
<p>andreas Enfield is here he actually is a</p>
<p>CEO of a very large keto friendly</p>
<p>website it&rsquo;s basically diet doctors calm</p>
<p>diet doctor calm that&rsquo;s right so welcome</p>
<p>thank you dr. Berg it&rsquo;s great to be here</p>
<p>yeah and you know I just the first thing</p>
<p>I want to cover is you&rsquo;re from Sweden</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually Swedish I&rsquo;ve never been to</p>
<p>Sweden but I hear rumors</p>
<p>okay there&rsquo;s rumors going out like</p>
<p>Sweden has now gone low carbs Sweden is</p>
<p>now high fat like tell me the truth</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re there what is the truth about</p>
<p>this yeah I guess the rumors are</p>
<p>slightly exaggerated it&rsquo;s true that</p>
<p>low-carb has been very popular in Sweden</p>
<p>for about a decade now so I mean</p>
<p>certainly going strong and also we had</p>
<p>this government expert review of the</p>
<p>dietary treatments for obesity about</p>
<p>five years ago and they came to the</p>
<p>conclusion that no carb has been proven</p>
<p>to be more effective at least in the</p>
<p>short term when people actually do it</p>
<p>then the other sort of dietary</p>
<p>treatments and that is the reason why</p>
<p>people believe that the whole country of</p>
<p>Sweden or now is now it&rsquo;s now low-carb</p>
<p>because that sort of report got to be</p>
<p>twisted online with someone sort of</p>
<p>falsely claiming that now this is the</p>
<p>official dietary recommendation for</p>
<p>every man woman and child in Sweden not</p>
<p>true it&rsquo;s just for dietary treatments</p>
<p>for obesity which is a good thing</p>
<p>not quite everyone&rsquo;s switching their</p>
<p>gears to that now like you have</p>
<p>countries Sweden Norway Denmark the air</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re typically the diet is higher in</p>
<p>like fats right like butter and cod</p>
<p>liver oil I&rsquo;m guessing maybe berry we do</p>
<p>love butter I mean that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great so yeah so one of these</p>
<p>days I&rsquo;m gonna have to go over there</p>
<p>because I heard it&rsquo;s beautiful so yeah</p>
<p>your mouth with them come by anytime I</p>
<p>feel you Stockholm</p>
<p>absolutely absolutely I I rarely went</p>
<p>out of the country I did one trip to</p>
<p>Italy and that was quite incredible so I</p>
<p>want to convince her out but I just I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not crazy about the long flights but you</p>
<p>know we&rsquo;ll deal with that I I mean I</p>
<p>come to your place all the time you know</p>
<p>you have so much we appreciate it don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>only fair that you&rsquo;re coming with the</p>
<p>Delft good point okay okay that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>all right you talked me into it so we</p>
<p>both have something in common we want to</p>
<p>spread Quito we want to get this out</p>
<p>there you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve done this for quite</p>
<p>a long period of time and you basically</p>
<p>you you see the results all over the</p>
<p>place so what do you feel is some of the</p>
<p>barriers that were up against to get</p>
<p>this message out there</p>
<p>what are you running into yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very good question I mean that as you</p>
<p>said I&rsquo;ll be doing this yes for 15 years</p>
<p>I spent 10 years as a family doctor</p>
<p>treating patients with low carb and you</p>
<p>know the latest five years mostly</p>
<p>focusing on this this company actually</p>
<p>more than that I think when I when I</p>
<p>started this I cannot believe that this</p>
<p>this is gonna be maybe five years you</p>
<p>know a paradigm shift is going on it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen and every year it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah sure we&rsquo;re getting a little bit</p>
<p>closer but it&rsquo;s very very slow right so</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m a bit more of a realist now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna take an awful long time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I mean depending on how many</p>
<p>people work trying to make this happen</p>
<p>it could be another five years it could</p>
<p>be another 50 years it depends you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping for five but I fear it could</p>
<p>be longer so the thing that&rsquo;s in the way</p>
<p>I think there are at least two big big</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s still this fear of natural</p>
<p>fats you know saturated fat cholesterol</p>
<p>that kind of thing people fear that</p>
<p>eating you know saturated fat from meat</p>
<p>or butter is gonna give them high</p>
<p>cholesterol and then the heart attack</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the cardiologist is</p>
<p>saying as well right it&rsquo;s not true I</p>
<p>guess you know it I know it most of the</p>
<p>people listening</p>
<p>I guess know that modern science shows</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s really no strong</p>
<p>correlation between eating butter and</p>
<p>heart disease and you know telling</p>
<p>people to avoid saturated fat doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to make you know do any good really</p>
<p>whatsoever so it&rsquo;s just a mistake but it</p>
<p>takes such a long time to to change your</p>
<p>thing like that when every expert used</p>
<p>to believe it and now you know a lot of</p>
<p>people are starting to question it them</p>
<p>say maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad after all but</p>
<p>it just takes a long time so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>one thing and then the second thing I</p>
<p>think is this notion that weight loss</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just about calories and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about eating less and moving more and we</p>
<p>all heard that problem is that when you</p>
<p>look at it in in scientific studies it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually more effective to avoid carbs</p>
<p>than to just count calories and it ends</p>
<p>up resulting in you eating fewer</p>
<p>calories because you&rsquo;re less hungry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the science shows and it</p>
<p>ends up resulting in quite often that</p>
<p>people actually burn more calories at</p>
<p>least according to some really good new</p>
<p>science showing that on a low-carb diet</p>
<p>people tend to under certain</p>
<p>circumstances at least burn 500 calories</p>
<p>maybe already at least 200 calories more</p>
<p>per day which is a huge so a low-carb</p>
<p>diet can result in eating less because</p>
<p>you lost hungry burning more because the</p>
<p>body just burns more calories and and</p>
<p>the bottom line is study after study</p>
<p>shows that people lose more more weight</p>
<p>on Lokar so yeah two things standing in</p>
<p>the way this sort of obsolete fear of</p>
<p>that we do that and is sort of fixation</p>
<p>on calories when it&rsquo;s really about</p>
<p>hormones and and the quality of their</p>
<p>calories you yeah I agree I think it</p>
<p>says we&rsquo;re up against fixed ideas and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ingrained it&rsquo;s really really hard</p>
<p>to change someone&rsquo;s mind about certain</p>
<p>things be especially when it conflicts</p>
<p>with what didn&rsquo;t talk for so many years</p>
<p>and but what&rsquo;s interesting is that I</p>
<p>recently was invited to do a webinar to</p>
<p>general industry in the food industry</p>
<p>now I didn&rsquo;t know any details about this</p>
<p>all this is we need you to do a webinar</p>
<p>to food manufacturing companies I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>okay just just to do a general webinar</p>
<p>on keto ketosis so I did it and then</p>
<p>after it was done I I said can I have</p>
<p>the list of who was on that webinar so</p>
<p>they sent it to me 400 of the top food</p>
<p>manufacturing companies in the world</p>
<p>was I was on that webinar so what I was</p>
<p>fascinating is that the food</p>
<p>manufacturing companies are seeing a</p>
<p>trend they follow the trends so the</p>
<p>market follows them money actually and</p>
<p>so to get them to change of course</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re now looking at developing keto</p>
<p>friendly stuff sugar free stuff I mean</p>
<p>look at coca-cola so that there is a an</p>
<p>interesting shift in the manufacturing</p>
<p>companies at that level so you know that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a change being happening right</p>
<p>now so I just found that interesting so</p>
<p>I had no idea like certainly things are</p>
<p>happening all the time and I think every</p>
<p>year I mean I&rsquo;ve been doing this for</p>
<p>more than a decade in my you know</p>
<p>experience every year people are a</p>
<p>little bit less inclined to eat sugar</p>
<p>and a little bit less inclined to be</p>
<p>afraid of fat right just keeps moving</p>
<p>slowly in that direction it goes for the</p>
<p>general public and it also goes for you</p>
<p>know name your expert on average they</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>more worried about sugar and less</p>
<p>worried about butter for every passing</p>
<p>year right exactly when you started</p>
<p>medical practice did you will you</p>
<p>low-carb right at the beginning or is it</p>
<p>something that you involve involved in -</p>
<p>yes I actually I started practicing</p>
<p>medicine in the year 2000 and then I</p>
<p>took about two years after that until I</p>
<p>became really interested in in low-carb</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m quite rapidly you know I tried</p>
<p>it myself read a lot of science books</p>
<p>you know talk to friends and family and</p>
<p>lots of people tried it them you know</p>
<p>eventually I just felt I have to try</p>
<p>this on my patients now to try this</p>
<p>recommend is to two patients with type 2</p>
<p>diabetes with obesity with high blood</p>
<p>pressure because it seems like you know</p>
<p>slam dunk saying it just makes perfect</p>
<p>sense and the science backs it up</p>
<p>and and really that transformed my idea</p>
<p>of practicing medicine because you know</p>
<p>starting as a new doctor I just got into</p>
<p>this world where where&rsquo;s expected that</p>
<p>your patients come back every year</p>
<p>slightly older slightly thicker and then</p>
<p>need a little bit more medications right</p>
<p>you just add some blood pressure</p>
<p>medications and diabetes medication and</p>
<p>then you send them home and then they</p>
<p>come back another year later and same</p>
<p>thing repeats and everybody nothing</p>
<p>nobody questions it you know my my you</p>
<p>know teachers they were all you know</p>
<p>this is this is where it&rsquo;s supposed to</p>
<p>be my metrics like yeah nothing strange</p>
<p>but then when I started telling these</p>
<p>patients you know you may want to try a</p>
<p>low-carb high-fat diet this this could</p>
<p>be great and and they were like bit</p>
<p>skeptical at first but a lot of people</p>
<p>ended up trying it and then they came</p>
<p>back suddenly healthier like you could</p>
<p>actually remove medications and I think</p>
<p>all doctors who do this they have</p>
<p>experienced that many many many times</p>
<p>you know you have your patient come back</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re healthy they&rsquo;re happy she</p>
<p>lost weight they feel great and then</p>
<p>oops their blood pressure is down you</p>
<p>have to remove</p>
<p>a blood-pressure drug for their sugar</p>
<p>has blood sugar has normalized and you</p>
<p>have to can remove one or two diabetes</p>
<p>medications it&rsquo;s just remarkable and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so much more fun I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the doctor and it&rsquo;s more like in</p>
<p>line with what I thought medicine was</p>
<p>supposed to be from the being is like I</p>
<p>mean practicing medicine the the regular</p>
<p>way just prescribing medications is kind</p>
<p>of depressing but I agree I think I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s really what people want is</p>
<p>they want to go to their doctor and have</p>
<p>them look at the root cause they want</p>
<p>them to they want diet advice that works</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t get it all the time and I</p>
<p>think I mean even I I went to</p>
<p>Chiropractic College so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like going through medical</p>
<p>school but I know in Chiropractic</p>
<p>College they don&rsquo;t they give you maybe</p>
<p>one class in nutrition you get a</p>
<p>toxicology class you get a good amount</p>
<p>of biochemistry but there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>related to food at all so you have to</p>
<p>basically relearn everything when you</p>
<p>get out I don&rsquo;t know what it was like</p>
<p>for you know some thing I mean with a</p>
<p>medicine for five and half years in</p>
<p>Sweden and one week is nutrition which</p>
<p>is I think a lot more than in the u.s.</p>
<p>because you have like a day or something</p>
<p>in medical school</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just crazy when you think of it as</p>
<p>sort of one of the true pillars or</p>
<p>foundations of good health is is a</p>
<p>healthy diet and doctors learn almost</p>
<p>nothing about it it just it&rsquo;s just crazy</p>
<p>it really is now you you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>involved in a lot of symposiums and</p>
<p>conventions are you seeing more doctors</p>
<p>medical doctors coming into this and</p>
<p>kind of looking at it what do you what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your experience with that I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more and more common lots of doctors</p>
<p>using our website I have been to a</p>
<p>number of conferences where there are</p>
<p>you know perhaps half the audiences is</p>
<p>doctors or other healthcare</p>
<p>professionals and they&rsquo;re all very</p>
<p>positive to this at least the ones</p>
<p>coming to</p>
<p>if convention through that I go to you</p>
<p>know yeah it&rsquo;s a little bit of it</p>
<p>selection bias that but but still I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>feeling that this is getting much more</p>
<p>popular compared to say five or ten</p>
<p>years ago oh yeah I see it too</p>
<p>what about protein what&rsquo;s your viewpoint</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always I always like to ask</p>
<p>people in the Quito feel about</p>
<p>recommending certain amounts approaching</p>
<p>higher or lower or moderate what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>take on the protein yeah I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting I mean I&rsquo;m not the biggest</p>
<p>protein expert out there you can find of</p>
<p>course experts with any kind of</p>
<p>viewpoint I tend to end up somewhere in</p>
<p>the middle you know you take care or no</p>
<p>it said nine men on one side and then</p>
<p>you have Jason trying on the other and</p>
<p>then you have 13 in the middle I&rsquo;m more</p>
<p>like in the middle but generally I would</p>
<p>my feeling I think there is no really</p>
<p>good evidence to my knowledge that</p>
<p>proves this either way but my general</p>
<p>feeling is that there&rsquo;s quite a wide</p>
<p>span of cocaine in tech that can work</p>
<p>really well for for most people and then</p>
<p>maybe if you&rsquo;re extremely insulin</p>
<p>resistant you may some circumstances</p>
<p>maybe do better with starting less and</p>
<p>if your insulin sensitive and you do a</p>
<p>lot of resistance exercise for example</p>
<p>you might do better with a little bit</p>
<p>more but for most people I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite a wide range yeah because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of those things where people</p>
<p>always want to ask me how many grams do</p>
<p>I need like you just have to test it out</p>
<p>you have to find out your sweet spot</p>
<p>because once you do it yourself it takes</p>
<p>like three or four days to figure it out</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll know what works for you</p>
<p>instead of trying to follow some some</p>
<p>opinion that you don&rsquo;t really know I</p>
<p>mean in practice like you have a lot of</p>
<p>new gurus coming out there that have</p>
<p>never been in practice and so if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t worked with people one on one</p>
<p>for over the years it&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>different ballpark you can&rsquo;t stick one</p>
<p>theory into everything I&rsquo;m talking like</p>
<p>even like within the keto field</p>
<p>like you have different versions of it</p>
<p>sometimes you have to go over here</p>
<p>sometimes you go over here because you</p>
<p>just when you think you figured it out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be that exception to</p>
<p>the rule that person doesn&rsquo;t get results</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example you know I was</p>
<p>recommending seven to ten cups of</p>
<p>vegetables to my clients and with great</p>
<p>success for a period of time and then</p>
<p>you get one lady who comes in that</p>
<p>completely and utterly gains like ten</p>
<p>pounds within a week and I see your face</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all red obviously she was reacting</p>
<p>to from an allergy or something and blew</p>
<p>up like a balloon and then I&rsquo;m like wow</p>
<p>okay well that I&rsquo;m not gonna recommend</p>
<p>that again to everyone so it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things we have to if people have</p>
<p>weaknesses when didn&rsquo;t digestive system</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do well on all ten cups today</p>
<p>even that fiber just tears them up so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like very flexible to go this</p>
<p>direction or that direction because I</p>
<p>want to do what works and sometimes the</p>
<p>body of these bodies there they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always respond you&rsquo;re the same you know</p>
<p>right I think it&rsquo;s interesting where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the process of of more</p>
<p>thoroughly evidence basing our or low</p>
<p>carbon and keep your godson and what</p>
<p>becomes more and more clear is that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really know a lot of these things</p>
<p>with any certainty like for example</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re saying that a lower carb diet</p>
<p>tends to be more effective for weight</p>
<p>loss and that might not be true but</p>
<p>there is really no high-quality</p>
<p>randomized control trial that ever</p>
<p>compared to true low carb diets with</p>
<p>varying levels of carbs head to head you</p>
<p>know you really comparing you know in a</p>
<p>way apples and oranges or whatever</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at different studies and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying okay maybe and lower it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more effective it seems like but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no good high-quality evidence for that</p>
<p>even and a lot of the other things where</p>
<p>we think we know we don&rsquo;t know you know</p>
<p>I mean you get two things you got number</p>
<p>one who&rsquo;s gonna fund the study like that</p>
<p>number two it&rsquo;s so hard to isolate</p>
<p>combinations of foods to know this is</p>
<p>what did this I mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>impossible because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>well how do we know it&rsquo;s this versus</p>
<p>that and then I mean yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not isolating one more and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard and it&rsquo;s expensive but these are</p>
<p>important questions I think eventually</p>
<p>they would be studies to test this it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a question of time but I guess</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to wait a bit longer</p>
<p>are you familiar with his name is Thomas</p>
<p>Seyfried yep sure so he does a lot of</p>
<p>research on cancer and I mean he can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even find a cancer cell that can survive</p>
<p>like something like 14 days on his</p>
<p>protocols</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s seeing amazing amazing</p>
<p>amazing results but the problem is the</p>
<p>funding who he&rsquo;s running he&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>just running on a shoestring as far as a</p>
<p>budget he&rsquo;s trying to get funding so</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s people donate here and there but</p>
<p>and that is the problem like you&rsquo;re up</p>
<p>against this huge industry and for yeah</p>
<p>same thing there there are interesting</p>
<p>findings in test tubes and and</p>
<p>everything you know but again your</p>
<p>cancer and ketogenic diets actual</p>
<p>testing on humans randomized trial I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think there is any there are a few</p>
<p>pilots small pilot studies uncontrolled</p>
<p>with you know yeah not really slam dunk</p>
<p>findings a lot of these things we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s really promising right but we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know yes I think the bottom line</p>
<p>still kedo in cancer it&rsquo;s such an such</p>
<p>an important and exciting area for</p>
<p>future research you see what they come</p>
<p>up with absolutely there was some good</p>
<p>data from dr. Ludwig study right yeah</p>
<p>you mean the one with weight maintenance</p>
<p>on different levels of carbohydrates the</p>
<p>one from a month ago</p>
<p>yeah just touch on that I think it was a</p>
<p>very quality study yeah I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that one I haven&rsquo;t studied it in detail</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that is the</p>
<p>best support yet for for the notion that</p>
<p>you can actually influence how many</p>
<p>calories your body burns per day</p>
<p>depending on what kind of diet you eat</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just about the number of</p>
<p>calories you eat it&rsquo;s also about the</p>
<p>quality of them because that can</p>
<p>influence how many calories you burn so</p>
<p>the bottom line of that study was that</p>
<p>people who have lost lost weight and</p>
<p>then they were were maintaining they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to maintain a weight loss if they</p>
<p>went on a low-carb diet they burned more</p>
<p>calories per day than if they went on a</p>
<p>higher carb diet making the weight loss</p>
<p>maintenance probably significantly</p>
<p>easier because you know burn more</p>
<p>calories you can eat more calories and</p>
<p>still maintain your weight loss</p>
<p>absolutely and the difference was quite</p>
<p>big like 200 calories on average at</p>
<p>least but if you looked at the people</p>
<p>with a high insulin levels the insulin</p>
<p>resistant people and and the people</p>
<p>actually had a high compliance with the</p>
<p>diet then it could be up to 500 extra</p>
<p>calories per day which is an enormous</p>
<p>amount interesting fascinating from your</p>
<p>viewpoint and for those of you that are</p>
<p>watching that I knew how necessary why</p>
<p>do people why should they run their body</p>
<p>on ketones what why should they do</p>
<p>ketosis that&rsquo;s a very good question I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure you know I think it&rsquo;s that for</p>
<p>some people there seems to be a benefit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly it seems like a very</p>
<p>effective way for people to lose weight</p>
<p>without hunger it seems like a very good</p>
<p>way to reverse a type-2 diabetes for</p>
<p>certain other diseases it can be very</p>
<p>beneficial like epilepsy and then some</p>
<p>people just feel better but that is a</p>
<p>little bit tricky because there are no</p>
<p>good studies to actually prove that</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very subjective thing you know</p>
<p>you better and you feel more mental</p>
<p>clarity more energy something it will</p>
<p>say that they do they do and you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have any good quality</p>
<p>evidence to to show that that&rsquo;s a sort</p>
<p>of general thing that most people</p>
<p>experience so I guess in a way it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if we can try it out and see if they</p>
<p>feel great that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s good well have</p>
<p>you had cases that you put people on</p>
<p>ketosis and it didn&rsquo;t work for them they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do well they I need to go back to</p>
<p>the carbs yeah I think for some people</p>
<p>at the very least it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>hard to do and it&rsquo;s not worth it to them</p>
<p>and then of course some people can get</p>
<p>get side effects like you know you can</p>
<p>get bad breath for example or some</p>
<p>people might get constipation or or leg</p>
<p>cramps things like that and feel that</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not worth it for them so I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s up to the individual to see</p>
<p>you know what what are the benefits what</p>
<p>are the goals that they are trying to</p>
<p>achieve and you know how do they feel</p>
<p>ill do they get any any side effects or</p>
<p>not then you have to try to balance that</p>
<p>and see if it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s worth it no</p>
<p>personally for me I mean I&rsquo;m you know I</p>
<p>guess I&rsquo;m in life ketosis almost all of</p>
<p>the time but I&rsquo;ve experimented with</p>
<p>trying to be in deep ketosis you know</p>
<p>eating almost no carbs for a month or</p>
<p>two and it for me it&rsquo;s not worth it</p>
<p>i I really don&rsquo;t experience the kind of</p>
<p>benefits that that make it worth it for</p>
<p>me you know I am relatively insulin</p>
<p>sensitive I don&rsquo;t have any major weight</p>
<p>issues you know even though I and it</p>
<p>lose like 15 pounds on on low carb not</p>
<p>really I mean I do great on low carb I I</p>
<p>always stay on a low carb diet because I</p>
<p>enjoy it and you know I&rsquo;m not hungry and</p>
<p>I ever closely maintain the weight I had</p>
<p>when I was you know 25 which is good</p>
<p>getting close to 50 but III do really</p>
<p>well on a low-carb diet but going super</p>
<p>low eating almost no carbs you know</p>
<p>below 10 or 20 grams a day I don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>I need it and you know if I if I did I</p>
<p>would eat it because it&rsquo;s fine but but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel I need it what type of carbs</p>
<p>do you get into or do you need yeah sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like not lots of vegetables</p>
<p>obviously you know some root vegetables</p>
<p>berries nuts that kind of thing mostly</p>
<p>occasionally perhaps a potato 50 grams a</p>
<p>day on regular day sometimes love</p>
<p>sometimes more you know but I go forever</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reached wrong there interesting</p>
<p>yeah I personally um I become my house</p>
<p>hit rock bottom that&rsquo;s what forced me</p>
<p>into some like keto I just got into it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m pretty strict but you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>always trying to experimenting you know</p>
<p>and recently last night we made this</p>
<p>cheeto bread and you know what it really</p>
<p>messed me yeah so my body is like a</p>
<p>human testing test too because I can</p>
<p>tell if something just has too many of</p>
<p>this like I consume this and it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any necessarily I thought I think</p>
<p>it was some ingredient that we that was</p>
<p>new I have to isolated but it was just</p>
<p>like wow that did not work so I</p>
<p>instantly noticed like not just</p>
<p>digestive issues but a crash and blood</p>
<p>sugars when I wake up in my like my eyes</p>
<p>are sticky or I feel sensitive I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>okay what didn&rsquo;t what did I last night</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that my body doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with so my body reacts very</p>
<p>quickly to things so I can kind of like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be recommending that</p>
<p>that recipe so I was like just enough</p>
<p>verse so some people get these</p>
<p>gastrointestinal issues where the with</p>
<p>these breads we were like psyllium husk</p>
<p>in it questions I don&rsquo;t know my my god</p>
<p>that can take can take quite a lot so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like you know that we were lucky</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m envious</p>
<p>you know another thing that I tested out</p>
<p>because I did a little interview with</p>
<p>Frank Tufano</p>
<p>and he had this a great recommendation</p>
<p>which is that was basically cod liver in</p>
<p>a can now in America it&rsquo;s not I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it&rsquo;s in Sweden but I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>seen anything like that so I ordered</p>
<p>some and my body loved that is actually</p>
<p>calm that her not even the oil but the</p>
<p>condom are in a camp so I took that in a</p>
<p>man did I feel good it&rsquo;s like all day</p>
<p>long I was like what the heck was in</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably just loaded with DHA</p>
<p>but look the good nutrition I go yeah so</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m always testing things see what</p>
<p>works and then you know pushing it out</p>
<p>there on the video and seeing people</p>
<p>like it yeah very impressive your</p>
<p>YouTube channel is huge now you you know</p>
<p>what how many like hundreds or even</p>
<p>thousands of videos now what is it but</p>
<p>we we get about 110 110 thousand new</p>
<p>subscribers every month mammoth muffin</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re getting close just under</p>
<p>I think 300 million views and noisiest</p>
<p>no carb focused or keto with somewhat of</p>
<p>a low carb Akita focus YouTube channel</p>
<p>the largest in the world right yeah I</p>
<p>like to call it healthy keto doing keto</p>
<p>healthy because you can do like a</p>
<p>version that&rsquo;s not very healthy but yeah</p>
<p>so I focus on that now and that&rsquo;s I I</p>
<p>spend a lot of time researching</p>
<p>compiling that&rsquo;s all I do it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>lonely existence where I&rsquo;m researching</p>
<p>all day long on a computer work on your</p>
<p>own or do you have a big team nah I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>the only one doing the research I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>only one doing the videos that have the</p>
<p>videographer a producer on the I about</p>
<p>my own studio and I have some</p>
<p>some staff that do customer service and</p>
<p>my website and things like that but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have anyone at this point helping</p>
<p>me with the research I&rsquo;m doing that just</p>
<p>because I I mean I think would</p>
<p>beneficial be beneficial to be able to</p>
<p>get someone to kind of narrow down but I</p>
<p>have I have some little packs little</p>
<p>secrets that I do they speed things up</p>
<p>like one of the things that I do is I</p>
<p>use a lot of Google patents a lot I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you to try that but good</p>
<p>Peppa yeah if you ever if you take a</p>
<p>topic on anything let&rsquo;s just take DHA</p>
<p>and you just someone&rsquo;s gonna try to get</p>
<p>a patent on that and what they do is</p>
<p>they summarize all this data for here</p>
<p>all the research everything in one</p>
<p>location so I can kind of help narrow</p>
<p>down some research and start looking at</p>
<p>at least some research that they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>already and that saves me a lot of time</p>
<p>rather than try to search you know one</p>
<p>by one it&rsquo;s a little secret don&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>me if another than prick there yeah</p>
<p>saves me a lot of time and then yeah and</p>
<p>so yeah yeah any topic I mean someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to get a in order to get a patent</p>
<p>you have to it has to be somewhat</p>
<p>credible to begin to get actual a</p>
<p>fulfilled patent so you have to kind of</p>
<p>lay out some good stuff like even the</p>
<p>the data on Hopkins getting a patent on</p>
<p>broccoli sprouts well you can get a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of information from</p>
<p>that one patent on phytonutrients like</p>
<p>they go right into a hard core in cancer</p>
<p>and of course they got sued in Supreme</p>
<p>Court and they got their patents taken</p>
<p>away but so you can get a lot of data</p>
<p>that way interesting strange thing to</p>
<p>Pithom yeah well I really appreciate</p>
<p>your time I know you&rsquo;re probably flat</p>
<p>out busy during all sorts of things I</p>
<p>really appreciate your time doing this</p>
<p>interview I hope people got some great</p>
<p>ideas from it and also I want to mention</p>
<p>you you have I think you have one of the</p>
<p>one of largest actual Kino websites in</p>
<p>the world</p>
<p>and you get a lot of traffic and you</p>
<p>have a program I&rsquo;ll put a link down</p>
<p>below you have a program very reasonable</p>
<p>that people can check out and it&rsquo;s you</p>

<p>recipes great content people can become</p>
<p>a member so definitely you guys want to</p>
<p>check it out I&rsquo;ll put the link down</p>
<p>below yeah thank you so yeah it is the</p>
