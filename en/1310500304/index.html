    <p>The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>his second time on this podcast.</p>
<p>He has inspired me for many years with his conversations</p>
<p>to be a better and kinder person</p>
<p>and has now been doing so as a friend.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one I would rather talk to</p>
<p>on this 300th episode of this podcast on the 4th of July,</p>
<p>both the anniversary of this country&rsquo;s</p>
<p>declaration of independence</p>
<p>and the anniversary of my immigrating here</p>
<p>to the United States.</p>
<p>A silly kid who couldn&rsquo;t speak English</p>
<p>and could never imagine that he will be so damn lucky</p>
<p>as to live the life I&rsquo;ve lived</p>
<p>and to feel the love I felt</p>
<p>from the amazing people along the way.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, thank you.</p>
<p>I love you all.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Charles Bukowski said something in a poem called Style</p>
<p>about art.</p>
<p>He defined art saying style is the answer to everything,</p>
<p>a fresh way to approach a dull or dangerous thing.</p>
<p>To do a dull thing with style is preferable</p>
<p>to doing a dangerous thing without it.</p>
<p>To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art.</p>
<p>What do you think he meant by that?</p>
<p>Do you agree with this?</p>
<p>A dangerous thing with style is art.</p>
<p>He said bullfighting can be art, boxing can be art,</p>
<p>loving can be art.</p>
<p>Have you ever made love and it was art?</p>
<p>No, okay, I&rsquo;m not asking.</p>
<p>Every time, bro.</p>
<p>Opening a can of sardines can be art.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, I call the way people live life art.</p>
<p>Like I wrote a foreword to my friend,</p>
<p>Cameron Haynes&rsquo;s book, which is right now</p>
<p>the number one selling audio book in the world.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I said was that</p>
<p>he practices an art that very few people appreciate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the art of the maximized life.</p>
<p>And that the discipline that he displays in his life</p>
<p>and through his practices and all the things that he does,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so difficult to live the way he lives</p>
<p>that for someone like me who understands it</p>
<p>and knows what he&rsquo;s doing and appreciates it</p>
<p>and appreciates how insanely difficult it is</p>
<p>to have a full time job and run ultra marathons,</p>
<p>get up at four o clock in the morning,</p>
<p>run a full marathon before work.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the kind of shit that he does</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s training for these 240 mile runs,</p>
<p>at the same time being like a father, a husband,</p>
<p>having this full time job,</p>
<p>also being the best bow hunter on earth, lifting weights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how does a person do this?</p>
<p>So in a way, discipline is art too.</p>
<p>Yes, discipline is art.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it is, because it&rsquo;s beautiful for me to see.</p>
<p>When I see someone who&rsquo;s really truly disciplined,</p>
<p>who like a David Goggins,</p>
<p>someone who just like truly maximizes the grind,</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s an art to that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an art to kindness.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s people that are really kind and really sweet</p>
<p>and when I&rsquo;m around them, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s an art to them.</p>
<p>No matter what.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They still, they got,</p>
<p>the world can throw a bunch of shit at you,</p>
<p>but through all of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, some people are just great at it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a thing that you learn how to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pleasing for other people to see.</p>
<p>And that I think is where the art is.</p>
<p>Well, I think Bukowski also said,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just a Bukowski quote generator today.</p>
<p>I love him.</p>
<p>I love him very much too.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a dark and troubled and fascinating and a weird person,</p>
<p>like Hunter S. Thompson.</p>
<p>He said, what matters most</p>
<p>is how you walk through the fire, I think.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bit of the Ken Haines in that too,</p>
<p>David Goggins in that too.</p>
<p>What do you think he meant by that?</p>
<p>Well, how you walk through the fire.</p>
<p>I mean, you can walk through the fire</p>
<p>complaining along the way,</p>
<p>or you can walk through the fire</p>
<p>and create an example for everyone else</p>
<p>so that the trials and tribulations of their own lives</p>
<p>seem trivial because they&rsquo;re comparing themselves</p>
<p>to the way you handle things,</p>
<p>or the way you handle things with grace and dignity</p>
<p>and discipline can show other people</p>
<p>that they can handle their own life this way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s beauty in that, there really is.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much inspiration</p>
<p>to be gathered from other people</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a charitable person,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re charitable and compassionate</p>
<p>and you can look at people,</p>
<p>even people that I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>I try to look at the best aspects</p>
<p>of how they live their life</p>
<p>and recognize those aspects, admire them,</p>
<p>give them credit for it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that we can all get out of</p>
<p>watching the way other people live their lives.</p>
<p>So I got a chance to see you walk through the fire</p>
<p>a little bit privately and publicly this year in January.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you about that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like generic conversations</p>
<p>about sort of cancel culture and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But as a human being, this to me is fascinating.</p>
<p>Sort of there&rsquo;s the N word highlight video,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the criticism of the different guests,</p>
<p>whatever the side is on the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>And you, I mean, there&rsquo;s a mass amount of attack on you.</p>
<p>Outside of being a public persona,</p>
<p>outside of being a comedian, podcaster,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also a human being.</p>
<p>So how did you survive that?</p>
<p>How did you sort of walk through that fire?</p>
<p>Because you seem to do it with grace.</p>
<p>I used mushrooms.</p>
<p>That was one way I did it.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your, as Andrew Huberman would say,</p>
<p>what was your protocol?</p>
<p>I took, it was probably less than a gram every day.</p>
<p>Every day?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I did a lot of like really hard working out.</p>
<p>But also, I mean, there&rsquo;s a great benefit</p>
<p>to going through anything difficult.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re aware, like in advance and during,</p>
<p>like anything that&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very difficult and troubling,</p>
<p>the great benefit is it gives you an opportunity to grow,</p>
<p>gives you an opportunity to express yourself</p>
<p>under pressure, to show your character,</p>
<p>to show who you truly are.</p>
<p>And it gives you an opportunity to see</p>
<p>how you handle a very difficult situation.</p>
<p>It also was fascinating as a person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in media, right?</p>
<p>Because what we&rsquo;re doing right now is media,</p>
<p>even though it seems, like podcasts seem</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re just having a conversation, right?</p>
<p>And they are, and in that sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of the purest form of media</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>without any fanfare, you&rsquo;re doing it without any,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no executives looming over your head</p>
<p>or network or big meetings about ratings</p>
<p>or any of that stuff, but it is media.</p>
<p>But what I got to see is the wiring under the machine</p>
<p>of how the rest of media would try to take me out.</p>
<p>And like when CNN would just be playing things</p>
<p>over and over and back and forth, it was wild to watch.</p>
<p>What was also wild to watch was people&rsquo;s responses</p>
<p>because I gained two million subscribers during that time.</p>
<p>Like the podcast never got bigger.</p>
<p>It just kept growing, it had never been bigger</p>
<p>than it had been at the end of all of it.</p>
<p>It just made it bigger.</p>
<p>And ultimately, if you&rsquo;ve fucked up in the past</p>
<p>or made mistakes or done something wrong,</p>
<p>that gives you an opportunity to discuss those things</p>
<p>and to say, to apologize if you feel the need to apologize</p>
<p>and also to just address it.</p>
<p>And so people under that kind of pressure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an opportunity for them to understand</p>
<p>how you think about things honestly,</p>
<p>how you actually honestly think about things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no more honesty that you get out of a person</p>
<p>than when that person is under extreme duress.</p>
<p>So I think in that sense, I mean, it&rsquo;s horrible to say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a benefit, that it&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>that it happened, but it was a benefit.</p>
<p>Can you see how it can break a person?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to experience small attacks</p>
<p>here and there, ones that get to the core of things.</p>
<p>Like even just talking about Russia and Ukraine,</p>
<p>to Stephen Calkin or Oliver Stone,</p>
<p>looking at different perspectives,</p>
<p>you gain, for me, feeling like a sizable number of people</p>
<p>who really don&rsquo;t like you and say things about you</p>
<p>that may be cut deep for a reason I don&rsquo;t understand why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just my own psychology.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s also because you can&rsquo;t defend yourself</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re saying it and you&rsquo;re not there</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have any opportunity for a rebuttal.</p>
<p>And if you do have a rebuttal, you&rsquo;re doing it publicly</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re opening it up to the whole world to chime in.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a general tendency that people have</p>
<p>towards negativity when they&rsquo;re interacting</p>
<p>with strangers online,</p>
<p>especially about controversial subjects.</p>
<p>And even if it&rsquo;s only 10% of the people, it&rsquo;s one out of 10.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of negativity when you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with thousands and thousands of tweets.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m just a very self critical person,</p>
<p>but I hear their words and I probably,</p>
<p>somewhere deep inside, see the truth in the criticism,</p>
<p>in some aspect of the criticism, and that&rsquo;s why it hurts.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in one aspect of you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re reading it, it&rsquo;s so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s boiled down to this one thing,</p>
<p>as if that one thing defines you totally.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;ve made a mistake,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve said something that you shouldn&rsquo;t have said,</p>
<p>or if you said something and maybe you should have</p>
<p>considered it more carefully,</p>
<p>given the gravity of the situation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a part of being a person.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also part of being a person where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>communicating with things publicly in real time,</p>
<p>thinking out loud, which is what we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complex and most people don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna have these,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have genuine hot takes</p>
<p>where people just see what you said</p>
<p>and go, why did he say that?</p>
<p>Fuck him.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know anything about, he doesn&rsquo;t live in Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s people that are gonna have takes</p>
<p>on that in that way.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also gonna be these disingenuous people</p>
<p>who just use any kind of controversial topic or subject</p>
<p>as an opportunity for them to get clicks or views.</p>
<p>But the number of those people can be quite large.</p>
<p>Quite large.</p>
<p>And so, going back to,</p>
<p>do you think it can destroy a person?</p>
<p>Because I kind of worry about this.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re, in many ways, but in this way, an inspiration</p>
<p>that it didn&rsquo;t seem to have destroyed you.</p>
<p>But is that?</p>
<p>I kept doing shows, I kept doing standup.</p>
<p>I ignored everything.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read any of it.</p>
<p>So it is possible to just?</p>
<p>100%, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I ignored it all.</p>
<p>But you have like.</p>
<p>I knew it was there.</p>
<p>Like your family didn&rsquo;t bring it up.</p>
<p>My family was very aware of it.</p>
<p>My wife was aware of it.</p>
<p>What was the conversation like?</p>
<p>If your wife is aware of it, is there like a rule?</p>
<p>Pretend it&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Just like.</p>
<p>Well, I tell her, don&rsquo;t ever read.</p>
<p>Past the green beans.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever let her like read negative articles to me.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, he care.</p>
<p>I go, that&rsquo;s a person&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>You take a person&rsquo;s opinion, you write it down.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t give it any more relevance.</p>
<p>Like that person, you know, could have had that opinion in silence.</p>
<p>They could have had it with some friends at dinner.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like me, whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to read it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to absorb it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know them, especially if I&rsquo;m not there.</p>
<p>And especially if it&rsquo;s some biased and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not an objective opinion of me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this, you know, they have a narrative and they want to stick to that narrative</p>
<p>and they want to write an article and they piece it all together, make you a piece of shit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s their prerogative.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re completely out to do that.</p>
<p>But I know I shouldn&rsquo;t absorb that.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t take that in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to be taking in the opinion of the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to be taking in the opinion of small groups of people that you encounter so that you get an understanding of how you make them feel.</p>
<p>And then maybe you say to yourself, maybe I come across too rude or maybe I come across too insensitive or maybe maybe I could do better in this way or that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we sort of shape our personalities and it&rsquo;s how we we develop our social skills.</p>
<p>But when the people don&rsquo;t know you and they have this like distorted narrative of you and, you know, there&rsquo;s fucking millions of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many people.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be saying, you know, actually, I mean, millions of people that are like communicating about something like during the height of the, you know, the attempt to cancel me or whatever that is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many people were involved in that.</p>
<p>People take this kind of stuff seriously.</p>
<p>But the problem is the false narratives take hold and then you have meetings, you have groups, you have it builds on top of each other and there&rsquo;s this outrage and then it reaches you at some point and it can just have these destructive effects.</p>
<p>It can, but it also sometimes doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And in my case, it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>What lessons did you draw from that?</p>
<p>Mushrooms, exercise.</p>
<p>Mushrooms and exercise, exercise is critical.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think the mushrooms by themselves would have worked.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing that I use for everything is the brutal exercise.</p>
<p>Like my exercise routines are horrible.</p>
<p>And because of that, everything else is easier.</p>
<p>I create my own bullshit and my own bullshit is so much harder.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also sauna and cold plunge and these torture sessions.</p>
<p>They in enduring those when you endure those, it makes enduring other things much easier.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also an understanding of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Like you have to know, like media, you have to understand, like what the hot take, you know, YouTube, social media, podcast, ecosphere is doing.</p>
<p>Like if they&rsquo;re talking about, you know, Lex Friedman said this and we have to comment on that and, you know, Lex gets canceled in all capital letters on a YouTube clip.</p>
<p>And if you you watch that, you&rsquo;re fucking crazy.</p>
<p>What are you doing, absorbing all this negativity?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good for you.</p>
<p>You are you, you know, you and you know, generally, if you&rsquo;ve made a mistake, you know, generally, if people are upset with you.</p>
<p>You posted this awesome video on your Instagram of a woman who was being interviewed in 19, late 1920s, maybe.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s close to 100 years old.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s lived through the Civil War, through World War One.</p>
<p>She was at the time living through the early days of the Great Depression.</p>
<p>So I was just looking back, you know, what have we as a human civilization in recent times survived, especially in the United States?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about the two world wars in the 20th century, the Great Depression, the Spanish food, the pandemic at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Yeah. What do we do in the United States?</p>
<p>9 11. If you think of what are the traumatic events that shook our world, it&rsquo;s 9 11.</p>
<p>It made us rethink our place in the world.</p>
<p>The pandemic pandemic is a huge one is one of the bigger ones, because it also accelerated and exacerbated</p>
<p>our anxiety, which people have a certain level of anxiety already, especially sedentary people.</p>
<p>They have a very high level of anxiety already because I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re giving their body what it what it needs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re you know, your body has certain requirements in terms of movement.</p>
<p>And when you deny your body those requirements, I think there&rsquo;s like a general level of anxiety that exists in almost everyone.</p>
<p>And then you have people obviously that have mental health issues and that also exacerbates the anxiety.</p>
<p>The lockdown exacerbated the anxiety, losing loved ones to the pandemic, exacerbated anxiety.</p>
<p>And then there was the the division that the different schools of thought, the people that were never going to get vaccinated no matter what.</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t trusting it. People thought there was microchips in there.</p>
<p>People that thought that, you know, Fauci&rsquo;s the demon and there&rsquo;s there was a lot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also like political leanings.</p>
<p>The right wing people tended to not want to be vaccinated, whereas the left wing people, for whatever reason, all of a sudden are trusting pharmaceutical companies like explicitly.</p>
<p>It was weird. It was a weird time.</p>
<p>And I think over time, as it&rsquo;s going to as it gets analyzed and we break it down, it&rsquo;s going to be one of the weirder moments for shaping human culture.</p>
<p>And unfortunately for throwing gasoline on this already burning fire of, you know, of conflict between the various factions of of thought in this country.</p>
<p>Just it&rsquo;s already a weird time, you know, post Trump, like the Trump era is also going to be one of the weirder times.</p>
<p>When when people look back historically about the division in this country, he&rsquo;s such a polarizing figure that so many people felt like.</p>
<p>They could abandon their own ethics and morals and principles just to attack him and anybody who supports him because he is an existential threat to democracy itself.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s not a cause, but maybe like a symptom, like it&rsquo;s going to get you said it got real weird.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s going to get weirder. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s going to get weirder.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to run again. You think he wins? Well, he&rsquo;s running against a dead man.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, Biden shakes hands with people that aren&rsquo;t even there when he gets off stage.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s seeing ghosts. Yeah. You see him on Jimmy Kimmel the other day? No. Well, he was just rambling.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s if he was anyone else, if he was a Republican, if that was Donald Trump doing that, every fucking talk show would be screaming for him to be off the air.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;m not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once. I&rsquo;ve said no every time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to help him. I&rsquo;m not interested in helping. The night is still young.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if I have him on the night is still young. I think I&rsquo;ll have him on. I think you&rsquo;ll have him on. Really?</p>
<p>Why do you think that? Because you&rsquo;ll have Putin on. And you&rsquo;re competitive as fuck.</p>
<p>No, I think ultimately, I mean, you had you&rsquo;ve had a lot of people that I think you might you may otherwise be skeptical.</p>
<p>Would I have a good conversation, which I think is your metric. You don&rsquo;t care about politics.</p>
<p>So can I have a good conversation? And I think you had like people like Kanye on, for example, and you had a great conversation with him.</p>
<p>I think you I think he is an artist, but Kanye doing well or not doing well doesn&rsquo;t change the course of our country.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, you know, do you really bear the responsibility of the course of our country based on a conversation?</p>
<p>I think you can revitalize and rehabilitate someone&rsquo;s image in a way that is pretty shocking.</p>
<p>Look at the way people look at Alex Jones now, because Alex Jones has been on my podcast a few times.</p>
<p>Yeah. How do they which direction?</p>
<p>The people that have watched those podcasts think he&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>And they think that he definitely fucked up with that whole Sandy Hook thing.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s right more than he&rsquo;s wrong. And he&rsquo;s not an evil guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a guy who&rsquo;s had some psychotic breaks in his life. He&rsquo;s had some genuine mental health issues that he&rsquo;s addressed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had some serious bouts of alcoholism, some serious bouts of substance abuse, and they&rsquo;ve contributed to some very poor thinking.</p>
<p>But if you know the guy, if you get to know him like I have, I&rsquo;ve known him for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>And if you know him on podcasts, you realize like he is genuinely trying to unearth some things that are genuinely disturbing for most people.</p>
<p>Like this is a guy that was telling me about Epstein&rsquo;s Island fucking decade ago.</p>
<p>At least he was telling me about I was like, what you&rsquo;re telling me?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a place where they bring elites to compromise them with underage girls and they film them.</p>
<p>Really? Like what? Cut the fuck out here.</p>
<p>Like, no, President Clinton&rsquo;s been there. Everyone&rsquo;s been there.</p>
<p>Like, but it sounds like nonsense.</p>
<p>And not only is it true, but people keep getting fucking murdered for it. Did you see that latest Clinton adviser that got murdered about it?</p>
<p>Yep. Yeah.</p>
<p>Hung with an extension cord, shot himself in the chest 30 miles from his house, and they&rsquo;re calling it a suicide.</p>
<p>And now even Elon Musk is asking, where&rsquo;s the clientele list?</p>
<p>Yeah, we should we should probably see who&rsquo;s been to that island.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should probably see who&rsquo;s been to that island.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably more of those kind of things out there that haven&rsquo;t been exposed.</p>
<p>Yeah, but sort of to push back in you, you had those conversations with Alex Jones.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you be able to have the same kind of conversation with Donald Trump?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Reveal. No, it&rsquo;s not the problem.</p>
<p>You revealed that Alex Jones is a human being.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s fucked up. He has demons in his head.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s obviously chaotic all over the place, but there&rsquo;s some wisdom to the perspective he takes on the world.</p>
<p>Even though he is often full of shit, he is able to predict certain things that very few people are willing to bring up.</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t Trump the same way?</p>
<p>Fucked up person, egomaniac, whatever personality things you can talk about.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it worthwhile to lay it out?</p>
<p>Like, who&rsquo;s going to, if you listen to interviews of Trump, who has the balls to call him out on this bullshit?</p>
<p>Chris Wallace did.</p>
<p>No, calling out somebody on their bullshit is easy when you&rsquo;re just being adversarial.</p>
<p>But as a person who is genuinely and pathetically trying to understand, I think you&rsquo;re really good at that.</p>
<p>Like, you pull them in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he would genuinely be there.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like, I think he would be putting on a performance.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think he can break through that in like 30 minutes?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d need more time than that.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t do any drugs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing about Alex.</p>
<p>You can get Alex high, get him drunk, and he&rsquo;ll start talking about interdimensional child molesters.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and then you get the real Alex.</p>
<p>Or maybe you have somebody else on as well to introduce chaos, like Alex.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You have to be one of them.</p>
<p>I would have to be just me and him.</p>
<p>I would have to, that would be a focused thing.</p>
<p>I would have to, like, really take time with Trump.</p>
<p>But also, I&rsquo;m not well versed enough politically to know all of the corruption that&rsquo;s been alleged</p>
<p>and to understand what the whole Russiagate stuff, what&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Like, how much of it, it&rsquo;s clear that there is more than one organization that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in communicating with Russia before the 2016 election.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty clear that the Clinton administration was involved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that the Trump administration had some communication with some people in Russia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that Hunter Biden had some very suspicious dealings in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot going on there, man.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard for anybody to parse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard for anybody, and especially to have an objective assessment of exactly what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And then to be able to do that and broadcast it publicly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a project.</p>
<p>And I think if you really want to do that correctly, it&rsquo;s something that I would have to research for a long time.</p>
<p>And to really, really, and I don&rsquo;t have that kind of time.</p>
<p>Not for, maybe for certain people that you&rsquo;re really curious about.</p>
<p>Like, you have that kind of time for Bob Lazar.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>But maybe not for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Because Bob Lazar, what he&rsquo;s talking about, I wanted to know, with the Bob Lazar thing,</p>
<p>I wanted to know, first of all, I want to be around him and see if I could smell bullshit.</p>
<p>Did you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t, man.</p>
<p>That was what&rsquo;s weird about it.</p>
<p>Not only did I not smell bullshit, I went over all of his interviews.</p>
<p>He hasn&rsquo;t done a lot, but he&rsquo;s done enough.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s done them over the course of 30 plus years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s alarming how consistent his story is, which is really weird when you think about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about back engineering alien crafts and working on a top secret government</p>
<p>test site that&rsquo;s carved into the side of a mountain to camouflage it from satellites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a wacky story.</p>
<p>But the guy really did work at Los Alamos Labs.</p>
<p>He really is a propulsions expert.</p>
<p>He really is a scientist.</p>
<p>Did he really work on back engineering UFOs?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But the way he described their motion is exactly like what&rsquo;s been observed by some of these pilots</p>
<p>that have these videos that they&rsquo;ve captured.</p>
<p>And I just love that, like, NASA, I&rsquo;ve been hearing from a bunch of folks who are there</p>
<p>legitimately funding research.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s people really taking this seriously of UFO sightings, investigating them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, adding more and more sensors to collect data from just observing at higher and higher definitions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool to finally see that.</p>
<p>And he was one of the early people, whether he&rsquo;s full of shit or not, that kind of forced</p>
<p>people to start taking these topics seriously.</p>
<p>Or at least forced people to have conversations about them and maybe attempt to debunk them</p>
<p>because it seems so preposterous, but then get sucked down the rabbit hole and start going,</p>
<p>hmm, maybe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll fucking.</p>
<p>The thing is, like the Fermi paradox, like, where are they, right?</p>
<p>And when you take into account just the sheer raw numbers, the vast majority of people objectively</p>
<p>assume that there is life out there, the vast majority.</p>
<p>Well, if you really take into account what we understand about the universe itself, what we</p>
<p>understand about the concept of infinity, and the way Neil deGrasse Tyson has explained it to me,</p>
<p>is that not only are there life forms out there, but there&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>You are out there.</p>
<p>Infinity is so large that Lex Friedman exists, and doesn&rsquo;t just exist, but exists an infinite</p>
<p>number of times, like the amount of interactions at cells and molecules.</p>
<p>The same exact interactions that have happened here on Earth have happened in the exact same</p>
<p>order an infinite number of times in the cosmos.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, it&rsquo;s not certain that that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Like Sean Carroll, you know, especially with quantum mechanics, based on a certain interpretation</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics, that&rsquo;s very possible.</p>
<p>But the question is, can you access those universes?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How far away are they?</p>
<p>The more sort of specific, practical question is, this local pocket of the universe,</p>
<p>our galaxy, or our neighboring galaxies, are there aliens there?</p>
<p>What do they look like?</p>
<p>Are they, so you can have this panspermia idea, where a much larger, like daddy civilization,</p>
<p>like rolled by and just planted a few aliens at a similar time.</p>
<p>Like Prometheus.</p>
<p>Yes, a different, you know, throughout the galaxy.</p>
<p>And those are the ones we might be interacting with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all kind of dumb as we are relatively, you know, maybe a few million years apart.</p>
<p>And then those are the ones we&rsquo;re interacting with.</p>
<p>And then we have a chance to actually connect with them and communicate with them.</p>
<p>Or it could be like much more wide open.</p>
<p>And you have these gigantic alien civilizations that are expanding very, very quickly.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is when you look up at the sky and you see the stars, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>light from those stars.</p>
<p>We might not be seeing the alien civilizations until they&rsquo;re already here, meaning like you</p>
<p>start expanding, once you get really good at expanding, you&rsquo;re going to be expanding</p>
<p>very close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>So right now we don&rsquo;t see much in the sky, but there could be one day we wake up and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like everywhere and they&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because the amount of time the light takes to reach us.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then the thing that I&rsquo;ve been really fascinated by is these, you know,</p>
<p>these alternative forms of transportation that they&rsquo;re discussing, like the ability</p>
<p>to harness wormholes and the ability to do things that a type three civilization is capable</p>
<p>of.</p>
<p>I had Michio Kaku on my podcast recently.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Love that guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so good at taking extremely complex concepts and boiling them down for digestion.</p>
<p>And, you know, and saying them in a way that other people can appreciate and not being</p>
<p>hesitant about saying wild, crazy shit that&rsquo;s out there, but grounded in what&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s all in on this UFO phenomenon.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s like, now the burden of proof is to people for people to come up with some</p>
<p>sort of a conventional explanation for these things.</p>
<p>He goes, because these things are defying all the concepts of physics that we currently</p>
<p>know in terms of what our capabilities are and propulsion systems and so many other things</p>
<p>that, you know, what we know about what current science is capable of reproducing.</p>
<p>As far as what we know, the problem is like these military projects that are top secret,</p>
<p>like how much money do they have?</p>
<p>They have a lot of money.</p>
<p>Like, but is it possible?</p>
<p>And maybe you could speak to this.</p>
<p>Is it possible that there could be some propulsion systems that have been developed and implemented</p>
<p>that are far beyond just the simple burning of rocket fuel, pushing the fire out the back,</p>
<p>which forces the rocket at extreme speeds forward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that does harness gravity, something that can distort space and time</p>
<p>and can make travel from one point to another like preposterously fast.</p>
<p>Well, not only is it possible, I think it&rsquo;s likely that that kind of stuff would be kept</p>
<p>a secret.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just everything you see about these, about the way either if it&rsquo;s contractors</p>
<p>like Lockheed Martin or if it&rsquo;s DOD, the actual departments of defense, they operate</p>
<p>in complete secrecy.</p>
<p>Just even looking at the history of the stealth fighter, just even stealth technology was</p>
<p>kept a secret for a very, very long time and not until you&rsquo;re ready to use it and need</p>
<p>to use it, does it become public and not officially public.</p>
<p>It just is being detected out in the wild.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be a process where you&rsquo;re secretly testing it and that might creep up,</p>
<p>which is maybe what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s waiting for the next big war, the next big reason to use the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, there&rsquo;s definitely technologies in that.</p>
<p>There might not be propulsion technologies.</p>
<p>There could be AI surveillance technologies.</p>
<p>There could be different kinds of stealth drones.</p>
<p>It could be also in cyberspace like cyber war weapons, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re obviously going to be kept secret.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m very skeptical lately.</p>
<p>And the reason why I&rsquo;m skeptical is the government keeps talking about it.</p>
<p>The Pentagon keeps talking about it.</p>
<p>NASA keeps talking about it.</p>
<p>In which direction are you skeptical?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical that they&rsquo;re aliens.</p>
<p>I think most likely it&rsquo;s a smoke screen.</p>
<p>And most likely these are some sort of like incredibly advanced drones that they&rsquo;ve developed</p>
<p>that they want to pretend don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>That seems the more likely scenario.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, my take is like, what&rsquo;s the benefit of them discussing these things?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the benefit of them discussing these things openly?</p>
<p>These are, the way they described it, off world crafts, not made from this earth.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why would they tell us that?</p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s an imminent danger of us being invaded and they want to prepare people so</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t freak out as much.</p>
<p>You know, like maybe freak them out a little bit.</p>
<p>Say that publicly.</p>
<p>The New York Times article, the Pentagon discussing it, all these different things.</p>
<p>Test the waters.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, let people know that this is a thing or my take is like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they tell us.</p>
<p>I think the government has a lot of contempt for the citizens.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>I think they have contempt for our intelligence.</p>
<p>They have contempt for our need to know things.</p>
<p>And I also think they think that they are running us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not we&rsquo;re all in this together.</p>
<p>And the government works for the people.</p>
<p>And the government is of the people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they think that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, the basic idea is you can&rsquo;t trust the populace, the government itself, because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a bunch of idiots.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re not wrong, but they&rsquo;re also idiots, power hungry idiots.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think everyone&rsquo;s an idiot, but I think there are enough idiots that it becomes</p>
<p>a real problem if you&rsquo;re completely honest about everything you do.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want to let everybody weigh in about things that are incredibly complex</p>
<p>and that most people are ignorant of.</p>
<p>And on top of that, there&rsquo;s this machine of intelligence that I&rsquo;ve recently been reading</p>
<p>a lot about the KGB, about the FSB.</p>
<p>So several things sparked my curiosity.</p>
<p>So one, I&rsquo;m traveling to Ukraine and to Moscow.</p>
<p>And because of that, I started to sort of ask practical questions of myself, just travel</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So I started reading a lot about the KGB.</p>
<p>Jack Barsky has a book on this.</p>
<p>I talked to him.</p>
<p>And you start to realize, you probably looked into some of this, but you start to realize</p>
<p>the scale of surveillance, manipulation.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of them also talk about the incompetence of those organizations, the usual</p>
<p>bureaucracy creeps in.</p>
<p>But the point is, it seems like there&rsquo;s no line they&rsquo;re not willing to cross for the</p>
<p>purpose of gathering intelligence, for the purpose of controlling people in order to</p>
<p>gather intelligence.</p>
<p>Now, this is MI6, FSB.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much information about the FSB or the GRU, but the KGB.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re always like 20 years behind or more on the actual information.</p>
<p>And so I started to wonder.</p>
<p>So I have not officially been contacted by any intelligence agency, but I started to</p>
<p>wonder, well, is there somebody I know that&rsquo;s doing that, undercover CIA or undercover</p>
<p>FSB, undercover anything?</p>
<p>You probably do.</p>
<p>Have you asked yourself this question?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, people that have been on my podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Do you think there was actually a guess that may have been?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>I would imagine.</p>
<p>Would you know?</p>
<p>I have suspicions.</p>
<p>Do you care?</p>
<p>Is this?</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on what they&rsquo;re attempting to do, right?</p>
<p>Like if I felt like there was some deception involved and they were trying to use the podcast</p>
<p>to manipulate a narrative in a deceptive way to trick people into things, yeah, I would</p>
<p>care.</p>
<p>But this is exactly what, those are the kind of things they do.</p>
<p>They do plant narratives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I would imagine if you have the number one podcast in the world that people would</p>
<p>want to infiltrate that.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s probably meetings in all major intelligence agencies about, okay, what are</p>
<p>the large platforms?</p>
<p>How do we spread the message?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing that really emerged when we&rsquo;re talking about during my</p>
<p>cancellation, that there&rsquo;s a clear, there&rsquo;s no objective analysis of this in mainstream</p>
<p>media.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clear narratives that they&rsquo;re trying to push forward to, whether it&rsquo;s to promote</p>
<p>certain ideas or to diminish the power and reach of people who are mavericks or people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t connected to a system that you can&rsquo;t compromise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it gets dangerous, right?</p>
<p>Where it gets dangerous is when someone has the largest reach, but is also completely</p>
<p>detached and clearly is independent in the sense of independent thinking, has on whoever</p>
<p>he wants.</p>
<p>But your mind can still be manipulated.</p>
<p>I guess I can.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess everybody can be manipulated a certain way.</p>
<p>I manipulate my own mind, I&rsquo;m sure too.</p>
<p>But I also spend a lot of time thinking about what I think.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t just accept things like the UFO thing, like I was all in for a while</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m like, man, something smells fishy.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m thinking like, here&rsquo;s my problem with the UFO thing.</p>
<p>I want it to be real so bad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my problem with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such a sucker.</p>
<p>I want it to be real so bad, you know, and that&rsquo;s a problem for me because I&rsquo;m aware</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>And so then I stop and think about like, what is my desire for UFO truth to be exposed?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s fun, you know, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>So I have a desire for it to be real.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve talked to a bunch of folks about this.</p>
<p>So those with connection with DoD, and they do draw lines between people that are full</p>
<p>of shit and people who are not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people in the public sphere that they say are full of shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And then you have to kind of tell the difference.</p>
<p>Yeah, CNN, watch them talk.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, on the UFO topic, there&rsquo;s certain individuals that are like, okay, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just like using this.</p>
<p>In fact, like people who are not full of shit are often very quiet, which is why, you know,</p>
<p>even Bob Lazar is an interesting story because he was trying to be quiet for the longest</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Well, he was worried about his own life, according to Bob, and that&rsquo;s why he went public with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And initially, the first videos he did with George Knapp, they hit his identity.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And then he felt like that wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>And he really needed to expose his own identity just to protect his life, which is a great</p>
<p>story.</p>
<p>You know, so you got to go, well, that seems so juicy.</p>
<p>I want to buy into it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I get nervous.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know who to trust in this world.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>How do you figure that out?</p>
<p>How do you figure out who to trust in your life?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>A lot of people want to be close to you.</p>
<p>CIA agents, FSB agents, people that want to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m friends with a former CIA agent, Mike Baker, who&rsquo;s been on my podcast a bunch of</p>
<p>times.</p>
<p>Allegedly former.</p>
<p>Former.</p>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s air quotes, former.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s former.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he has some connection to him.</p>
<p>I also believe he&rsquo;s a good guy, but I gain a lot of very intelligent and well informed</p>
<p>insights from him as to how things work.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think, yeah, I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t tell me everything about everything,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s told me enough where I think I can understand things better from talking to him</p>
<p>about how the way, you know, the elves work under the machine.</p>
<p>What about friends?</p>
<p>How do you know if you can trust?</p>
<p>Well, most of my friends are old friends.</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<p>So time is the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like just going through shit together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also people that, you know, first of all, comics.</p>
<p>You can trust comics?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Comics are pretty trustworthy.</p>
<p>The good ones, the really good ones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not that many of us.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a thousand professional comics on earth, I&rsquo;d be stunned.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be stunned.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think there&rsquo;s a thousand like real professionals who you get booked all</p>
<p>the time, headline weekends at clubs and theaters and arenas.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s levels to that, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like the guys who are middle acts who kind of like barely scraped by and then</p>
<p>like how many headliners are there?</p>
<p>How many like really funny headliners that I would say, you know, if you Lex, you tell</p>
<p>me you&rsquo;re going to be in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Hey, this person&rsquo;s playing at this club.</p>
<p>Should I go see them?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, you know, like how many people would I give the recommendation to?</p>
<p>And then how many people sell out theaters?</p>
<p>How many people sell out arenas?</p>
<p>How many people?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not that fucking many.</p>
<p>So those people like at the levels of comedy where you do, you know, you&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>stand up for 20 years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain amount of honesty and a certain amount of understanding of each other</p>
<p>that we all have.</p>
<p>Oh, so that process of becoming a great comic is like humbling in a way.</p>
<p>Like Jiu Jitsu is humbling.</p>
<p>Very similar.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve eaten so much shit that that somehow, even if you&rsquo;re insane, even if you&rsquo;re chaotic,</p>
<p>even in the way, even if you&rsquo;re full of shit, you lie a lot, all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>underneath it, there&rsquo;s a good human.</p>
<p>You could be surface bullshitter, but on important things, you&rsquo;re trustworthy.</p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re not, then people shy away from you.</p>
<p>And there are people like that, too, that are really successful, but that are what I</p>
<p>call islands.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to other comics about that, like you don&rsquo;t want to be an island because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these people that aren&rsquo;t attached to the rest of the community and they&rsquo;re doing well on</p>
<p>their own.</p>
<p>And usually they have like one opening act they bring with them on the road they&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>with forever and they don&rsquo;t have comedy friends.</p>
<p>And those people are miserable because they can&rsquo;t relate.</p>
<p>Sometimes fame in itself is isolating.</p>
<p>So you have to actually do a lot of work and make sure you don&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t isolate you.</p>
<p>Because if you become successful, people start wanting stuff from you.</p>
<p>And then sometimes you want to push them away because of that, as opposed to connect with</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t enjoy it when people want things from me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>You just ignore it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fucking too heavy.</p>
<p>They want too much.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s too much of a disproportionate relationship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too unbalanced.</p>
<p>Because there are people where you could tell that they&rsquo;re working toward something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working towards an angle and they want to be close to you because you will benefit</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s other people that are just, there&rsquo;s not that many of us.</p>
<p>And so we all want to hang out together.</p>
<p>Like when I, one of the podcasts I love the most is this podcast I do called Protect Our</p>
<p>Parks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing I do with Ari Shaffir, Shane Gillis and Mark Nolen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fun because we just get obliterated and we talk so much shit.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s conversations after that podcast where I go, hey man, we got to cut that part</p>
<p>out because like Shane will go too far or go too crazy.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re just making each other laugh and it&rsquo;s just fun.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like that kind of camaraderie between real comics is very precious to me.</p>
<p>My favorite part of that is like the non sequitur stuff from Mark Norman.</p>
<p>And you guys get so trashed that you don&rsquo;t even understand what the hell he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny to the listener because he&rsquo;s still on point.</p>
<p>That guy is sharp.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>Mitch Hedberg quality.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s such a dedicated comic.</p>
<p>He loves comedy so much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things I love about him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like comedy.</p>
<p>He gets excited.</p>
<p>He loves it.</p>
<p>As does Shane and as does Ari.</p>
<p>They really love it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Like I have friends in that way and I have martial arts friends who are some of the also</p>
<p>the thing about being humbled, how things like Jiu Jitsu will humble you.</p>
<p>Martial arts friends, they know who&rsquo;s been through it.</p>
<p>They know who really has gone through the gauntlet and emerged on the other end a better</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>Well, you said there&rsquo;s very few of us.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have the goat discussion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to pick anybody, but who are the greats of comedy?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the greatest comic of all time?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is a greatest comic of all time.</p>
<p>Is it Norm Macdonald?</p>
<p>Norm Macdonald was one of the greats for sure.</p>
<p>Well, by the way, actually on that topic, what do you think about is I think as a person</p>
<p>who is fascinated by the fear of death and death, I think it was a truly genius thing</p>
<p>to release a special after you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that works.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the special of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s called I think nothing special.</p>
<p>Which sounds like something Norm would say.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically him in front of&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I imagine he wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted it edited that way because it&rsquo;s made to look</p>
<p>nicer than I think he probably would have preferred it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s him in front of the screen like in a Zoom call doing jokes without cold.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And somehow given his like dry, dark humor, it works.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s almost making fun of itself.</p>
<p>Almost making fun of that hole that we were stuck alone inside.</p>
<p>And because he&rsquo;s still acting as if he&rsquo;s in front of the audience and is almost making</p>
<p>fun of the fact that this is what we&rsquo;re forced to do.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s quite genius.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really well&hellip;</p>
<p>And the jokes are really good.</p>
<p>But it also makes you realize how important laughter is from the audience, the energy</p>
<p>from the audience.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also an intimacy because it&rsquo;s just you and him because you&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>into it, there&rsquo;s no audience.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, I think it&rsquo;s quite genius.</p>
<p>And he is, of course, there&rsquo;s certain comics that are like, not only are they funny, but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re truly unique.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not in terms of friendship and all that kind of stuff, but in terms of comedy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re an island.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they, you know, Mitch Hedberg probably is that.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of people then start to imitate them and so on.</p>
<p>Stephen Wright.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like people who are like, you know, Dave Chappelle, who&rsquo;s like probably</p>
<p>one of the greats, but he&rsquo;s just like raw funny.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s an island.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just raw.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>An outlier, a unique individual.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s just great.</p>
<p>Norm was definitely unique in his greatness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one Norm, you know, who&rsquo;s got a very specific style.</p>
<p>Is there a reason you guys weren&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like he was, you guys were close.</p>
<p>I mean, I loved him.</p>
<p>He was great.</p>
<p>I always enjoyed talking to him.</p>
<p>We just didn&rsquo;t work together that often.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t around each other that often.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it was, but it wasn&rsquo;t like, it was, I loved him though.</p>
<p>He was a great guy.</p>
<p>I had a funny story about it, Norm.</p>
<p>Twice, just randomly, I was on airplanes next to him.</p>
<p>Seated right next to him.</p>
<p>Just totally random.</p>
<p>Yeah, and one time we&rsquo;re on this airplane and we&rsquo;re having this talk and I was like,</p>
<p>yeah, I quit smoking.</p>
<p>I was smoking a lot and I just had terrible, terrible smoke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible for you.</p>
<p>And we have this great conversation.</p>
<p>We get off the plane and he sprints towards a store and buys cigarettes like in the airport</p>
<p>and is lighting it on the way out the door.</p>
<p>And I go, I thought you quit smoking.</p>
<p>It was, yeah, I did.</p>
<p>But all that talking about smoking made me want to smoke again.</p>
<p>So before he&rsquo;s getting through the door of the airport, he&rsquo;s lighting it up.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t wait to get that cigarette in him.</p>
<p>It was, he was just so crazy and impulsive and loved to gamble.</p>
<p>He loved gambling.</p>
<p>And in that way, he embodied the joke.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even tell that certain people just live in a non sequitur, ridiculous, absurd,</p>
<p>funny way.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was him.</p>
<p>Nonstop.</p>
<p>There was nothing artificial about Norm.</p>
<p>That was who he was.</p>
<p>His brilliance was his essence.</p>
<p>That was who he was.</p>
<p>But in terms of the greats, the godfather of it all is Lenny Bruce.</p>
<p>I mean, I have a bunch of Lenny Bruce concert posters at my house and photos that I have</p>
<p>framed and Whitney Cummings actually gave me this brilliant photo of him when he got</p>
<p>arrested for one of the times when he got arrested for saying obscene jokes.</p>
<p>He was the most important figure in the early days of comedy because he essentially gave</p>
<p>birth to the modern art form of standup comedy.</p>
<p>Before that, it was a bunch of guys that were like hosting shows and they would tell jokes.</p>
<p>They were just like, you know, two guys walking to a bar, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And he would talk about social issues.</p>
<p>You know, he would talk about life.</p>
<p>He would talk about language.</p>
<p>He would talk about laws.</p>
<p>And it was just he was the very first guy who did modern standup.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s fascinating is if you go and you try to watch it, if you try to watch Lenny</p>
<p>Bruce today, it doesn&rsquo;t work because society has evolved.</p>
<p>Like in many ways, art is a window, especially like pop culture or modern, you know, at the</p>
<p>time, culture, art, art that discusses culture is a window into that time period.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of a time machine.</p>
<p>So you get to like, you have to put yourself like, what was it like to be in 1963?</p>
<p>Like, what was he in 1963?</p>
<p>What was this like to hear him say this?</p>
<p>And the civilization that existed in 1963, although it looked pretty similar, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all driving cars and they&rsquo;re all wearing suits and they&rsquo;re all it seems normal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a different world.</p>
<p>And the things that he was saying that are so taboo are so normal today that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not shocking.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not not that good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to do the same kind of stuff for like there&rsquo;s a D.H. Lawrence has a book</p>
<p>called Lady Chatterley&rsquo;s Lover.</p>
<p>And I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was one of the early books, I believe, at the</p>
<p>over a century ago that was very controversial for its sexual content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of one of the great books because it dared to actually talk about a woman cheating</p>
<p>on her husband and like and do so in the highest form.</p>
<p>And the same thing with Gulag Archipelago talking about talking about some of the darkest</p>
<p>aspects of human history right when all of that stuff is forbidden, when it&rsquo;s banned.</p>
<p>Because now it&rsquo;s like not, you know, yes, we all know this history.</p>
<p>But when in the middle of it, when you&rsquo;re risking your own life, when you&rsquo;re risking</p>
<p>your book being banned or burned or you being in prison, that&rsquo;s when it matters, like taking</p>
<p>that risk.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And no one took that risk more than Lenny Bruce.</p>
<p>Lenny Bruce was arrested many, many times.</p>
<p>And ultimately, it wound up costing him his life.</p>
<p>I mean, he died on the bathroom floor shooting heroin and trying to cope with all the lawsuits</p>
<p>that he was going through.</p>
<p>This guy was constantly being arrested and constantly going through lawsuits.</p>
<p>And then his comedy deteriorated horribly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some footage of him towards the end of his career where he&rsquo;s essentially would</p>
<p>go on stage with legal papers and read from the legal papers about his case.</p>
<p>From then, it&rsquo;s Richard Pryor.</p>
<p>From him, then the next great is Richard Pryor.</p>
<p>And he had the most profound impact on me when I was a kid.</p>
<p>When I was 15 years old, my parents took me to see Live at the Sunset Strip, which is</p>
<p>Richard Pryor&rsquo;s concert film.</p>
<p>And I remember very distinctly being in that audience and laughing and looking around at</p>
<p>all the people in the audience who were like falling out of their chairs, just dying, laughing,</p>
<p>just swaying back and forth.</p>
<p>And I was laughing hard, too.</p>
<p>And I was like, my God, this guy is doing this just by talking.</p>
<p>And I thought of all the great movies that I&rsquo;d seen that I love that were hilarious comedy</p>
<p>movies.</p>
<p>And I was like, nothing that I&rsquo;ve ever seen is as funny as this.</p>
<p>And all he&rsquo;s doing is talking.</p>
<p>And that planted a seed in my head for my love of stand up comedy and my curiosity about</p>
<p>the art form.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what got me interested in watching it on television and then ultimately going</p>
<p>to open mic nights and then eventually doing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually been going to open mics a lot recently, just listening.</p>
<p>For psychological examinations of people.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s actually really inspiring to me to see people that somewhere in the world</p>
<p>some are funny, some are not so funny, unapologetically trying, putting it all out there night after</p>
<p>night, like eating shit.</p>
<p>My favorite is when you&rsquo;re talking about five people in the audience and the jokes are just</p>
<p>not landing.</p>
<p>And they still, I don&rsquo;t know, it feels like even just empathetically, there&rsquo;s few things</p>
<p>as difficult as that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I still remember those days, many comics will say this, and I think Dane Cook was the first</p>
<p>person I heard say it publicly, that if he ever had to go back and do it again, like</p>
<p>from scratch, doesn&rsquo;t think he could do it.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t think he could endure the struggle of open mic to ultimately to success.</p>
<p>And the numbers of people that try it and fail versus try and succeed are off the charts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any other art form that has such a low rate of success.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s psychological, it&rsquo;s torture.</p>
<p>It is torture, and it&rsquo;s also not something you can learn.</p>
<p>Like, here&rsquo;s the thing, like, if you play guitar, you can learn to play guitar.</p>
<p>Someone can teach you the chords, and if you do it, you could do all along the watchtower,</p>
<p>you could play it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t teach someone how to do comedy.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re funny or not?</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re funny or not, or can you still figure it out?</p>
<p>Like, can you still learn?</p>
<p>You can figure it out, yeah.</p>
<p>Can you start being unfunny and become funny?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy, though.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to eat a lot of shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to eat a lot of shit, and you&rsquo;re gonna have to examine why you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>funny, and you&rsquo;re gonna have to spend a lot of time with uncomfortable thoughts and try</p>
<p>to figure out what it is.</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s missing?</p>
<p>Like, you know, could you edit your stuff and make it better?</p>
<p>Maybe you need to do drugs.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to get involved in psychedelic drugs and rethink the way you interface with</p>
<p>reality itself.</p>
<p>Maybe you need your heart broken.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to be in love.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a lot of maybes there.</p>
<p>Like, maybe you just need more life experience.</p>
<p>But, you know, when I started comedy, I was 21, and I was a moron.</p>
<p>I had no information, you know?</p>
<p>I could do impressions of people, and I could talk about sex.</p>
<p>Those are the things that I was interested in back then.</p>
<p>I mean, if I was talking philosophically, I didn&rsquo;t have a philosophy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a unique perspective on life.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t experienced much.</p>
<p>So, every time you bomb, it forces you to introspect, to ask questions of yourself,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s how you actually develop a philosophy of what you actually believe.</p>
<p>You learn through doing, and I think you could say that about podcasting, too.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m certainly way better at having conversations than I ever was when I first</p>
<p>started doing comedy.</p>
<p>Or, excuse me, when I first started doing podcasts.</p>
<p>You learn through it.</p>
<p>You should stick with it, kid.</p>
<p>Because one day, you&rsquo;ll be able to interview Donald Trump.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be mad enough to handle that conversation.</p>
<p>How hard is it to do?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve been really curious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been on my bucket list because I&rsquo;m terrified.</p>
<p>I want to do everything I&rsquo;m terrified of.</p>
<p>Do you want to do stand up?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But I do want to do, like, one five minute, like, open mic.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you do Kill Tony?</p>
<p>How hard is it to do five minutes, would you say?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Well, it depends on, you know, how long you&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing comedy.</p>
<p>It depends on how you look at things.</p>
<p>And also depends on your style of comedy.</p>
<p>Like, the most difficult style of comedy is, like, I think, like, Stephen Wright style</p>
<p>is probably the most difficult style of comedy.</p>
<p>Complete non sequiturs.</p>
<p>One subject doesn&rsquo;t lead into the next.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no flow to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, oh, I noticed this.</p>
<p>I noticed that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard to memorize.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really hard to piece together an hour of non sequiturs.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s easier because you can rely on the joke.</p>
<p>It sits more with the joke.</p>
<p>Like, whether you&rsquo;re funny or not is on the actual material versus, like, the timing</p>
<p>and the energy of the dance with the audience, right?</p>
<p>Because, like, if you don&rsquo;t have the raw jokes like Stephen Wright does or Mitch</p>
<p>Hedberg, then you have to, it&rsquo;s all about the delivery.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, yeah, they either kill or they bomb.</p>
<p>Is it random?</p>
<p>Like, whether they kill or bomb?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you&rsquo;re essentially a different person every day of your life.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re similar.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re more tired.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more rested.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exhausted.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re refreshed.</p>
<p>You have vitamins and food nourishment in your system.</p>
<p>You just got your heart broken.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t slept in days.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a different person all the time.</p>
<p>And you go on to that stage.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the neighborhood of who Lex Friedman is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the Lex Friedman neighborhood.</p>
<p>Which Lex Friedman am I going to get?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Energy levels.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>It all depends.</p>
<p>But, oh, the other thing with Kill Tony is it&rsquo;s videotaped.</p>
<p>Yes, so you eating shit is on there forever.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>The world can see it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s one of the most important shows in comedy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most important show in comedy.</p>
<p>Because, first of all, it establishes stand up in a sense that, like, for the open micers,</p>
<p>for the people that are starting it out, it establishes that the most important thing</p>
<p>is to be funny.</p>
<p>Like, this is what the art form is all about.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of insecurity attached to that and a lot of fears.</p>
<p>And so to alleviate some of those insecurities and fears, people will decide that the message</p>
<p>is more important.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll pretend that you have to be socially aware, that you have to promote things that</p>
<p>are positive in your comedy, which is bullshit.</p>
<p>The people that say that, they&rsquo;re all bad.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all bad at comedy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the insecurity is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they can&rsquo;t just kill.</p>
<p>So they have to pretend that they&rsquo;re supposed to be socially aware.</p>
<p>And that being socially aware is an important part into society.</p>
<p>Like, let me explain something really clearly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fucking person on earth who&rsquo;s ever changed their life because of a joke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re there for.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there for jokes.</p>
<p>The people that say that, they say that socially important comedy is the only comedy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>necessary, the only comedy that you have to do.</p>
<p>That is just because they suck.</p>
<p>That is it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the cop out is that they can&rsquo;t do the real comedy.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t crush.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like someone goes from being, you know, take like Shane Gillis, one of the best</p>
<p>comics up and coming right now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fucking fantastic.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recommend enough seeing that guy live.</p>
<p>I work with him in Irvine, and I hadn&rsquo;t seen like his whole set.</p>
<p>I was crying.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>I heard he&rsquo;s a racist.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t listened to any of his material, no.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>And his comedy is just all just trying to be as funny as possible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a chance in hell that guy&rsquo;s just going to go woke and he&rsquo;s just going to start</p>
<p>promoting some sort of, you know, socially conscious agenda that&rsquo;s, you know, facetious</p>
<p>and just a bunch of nonsense that he&rsquo;s trying to elevate his own personal brand and virtue</p>
<p>signal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>The thing about Kill Tony is in that because you only have one minute and because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>live and because you don&rsquo;t want Tony shitting on you, everybody else shitting on you, everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just gearing up to try to be as funny as possible.</p>
<p>And no one cares if you are gay or straight or Asian or black or trans or nonbinary.</p>
<p>Nobody gives a fuck.</p>
<p>Are you funny?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re funny, you&rsquo;re in and everybody loves you.</p>
<p>You could be 80.</p>
<p>You could be 20.</p>
<p>Nobody gives a shit.</p>
<p>You could be a woman or a man or ambiguous.</p>
<p>Nobody fucking cares.</p>
<p>Are you funny?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the most important thing for a community of comedy to really promote comedy.</p>
<p>Just funny.</p>
<p>Just be funny.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, Kill Tony is a real cornerstone of comedy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reminder of what comedy is supposed to be.</p>
<p>That said, even the funniest stuff has underneath it some wisdom that comes out of it, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the primary goal of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it might be inspiring and fun.</p>
<p>Tim Dillon&rsquo;s a great example of that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got some amazing insights in his comedy, but still it&rsquo;s fucking comedy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all of the funny.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best at doing that, especially in a podcast form about weaving really important</p>
<p>points in with hilarious, obviously, just jokes.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, speaking of Tim Dillon, a chaotic fucked up individual.</p>
<p>Can we go to your childhood real quick?</p>
<p>A brief stroll.</p>
<p>So your mom and dad split up when you were five.</p>
<p>From a younging perspective, if you look at your subconscious, what impact do you think</p>
<p>that had on you informing who you are as a man, as a human being?</p>
<p>Well, at the time I thought that my father was like a hero.</p>
<p>He was my dad.</p>
<p>I think every kid thinks like that about his dad.</p>
<p>His dad is like, your dad&rsquo;s your protector.</p>
<p>Your dad is like the coolest guy in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to be like their dad, especially if your dad is like an imposing figure.</p>
<p>I remember one time me and my cousin got in a fight over nothing.</p>
<p>It was like over who&rsquo;s tougher, King Kong or Godzilla.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Over nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important, but yeah.</p>
<p>Actual fight, actual physical fight.</p>
<p>I punched him in the face.</p>
<p>This is when you were like five?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which side were you on?</p>
<p>King Kong.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>Godzilla&rsquo;s like way bigger.</p>
<p>Godzilla&rsquo;s 500 feet tall and he shoots fire out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s an argument to be made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all about size, right?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s no argument to be made.</p>
<p>500 feet tall versus 50 feet tall.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s a gigantic dinosaur.</p>
<p>One is a stupid monkey who gets shot down by a plane.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think you can&rsquo;t kill Godzilla?</p>
<p>Godzilla, like no back.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t kill Godzilla with a plane.</p>
<p>Like that shit wouldn&rsquo;t work in Godzilla killed King Kong.</p>
<p>King Kong and the new movies kept growing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>It got to the point where he&rsquo;s as big as Godzilla.</p>
<p>It just feels like King Kong is stronger.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Backtake, backtake, immediate backtake.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a backtake.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s the same size.</p>
<p>Human weapons and two animals going at it of a different size.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s in the jungle,</p>
<p>a smaller animal could take on a bigger animal.</p>
<p>Like a monkey versus a, let&rsquo;s see, a lion.</p>
<p>Monkey versus a bear.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Who wins?</p>
<p>A monkey versus a bear.</p>
<p>Not a monkey.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the strongest ape?</p>
<p>No, but gorillas eat.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Gorilla can&rsquo;t do back takes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of like a smaller.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Because in Jiu Jitsu you see this all the time.</p>
<p>You remember that scene in Talladega Nights?</p>
<p>Do you know Talladega Nights?</p>
<p>Where the little boy&rsquo;s talking to his grandpa?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be all over you like a spider monkey.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Spider monkey.</p>
<p>I was thinking.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some animals.</p>
<p>Like here&rsquo;s a better example.</p>
<p>A wolverine.</p>
<p>Wolverines chase wolves and bears off of their kills.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not very big at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just so ferocious.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re so durable.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very hard to kill a wolverine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s videos of like cats.</p>
<p>Like not actual cats.</p>
<p>Like domestic cats or domestic dogs starting shit with much larger animals.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re ferocious enough.</p>
<p>Well, pit bulls are a great example of that.</p>
<p>Pit bulls are small.</p>
<p>Like real game bred pit bulls are like 35, 45 pounds.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll kill much larger dogs.</p>
<p>Anyway, you were on King Kong&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So shit out of your cousin.</p>
<p>I remember he said to me like I thought it was in like real trouble.</p>
<p>Because I remember my cousin&rsquo;s mom was yelling at me.</p>
<p>And it was like, you monster.</p>
<p>All this crazy shit.</p>
<p>So my dad got me alone.</p>
<p>And he said, tell me what happened.</p>
<p>And I told him, you know, we got in a fight.</p>
<p>We were arguing.</p>
<p>We were King Kong, Godzilla.</p>
<p>And I punched him in the face.</p>
<p>And he goes, did you cry?</p>
<p>I go, no.</p>
<p>He goes, good.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever cry.</p>
<p>And I remember that.</p>
<p>Like, whoa, okay.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, all right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to start punching people because like obviously my dad thinks it&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>if I go running around punching people as long as I don&rsquo;t cry.</p>
<p>Like, I remember certain things about, you know, and also like this is, again, like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about watching Lenny Bruce and getting a timeline of what the world was like back</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>This is a different world, you know, in 1970.</p>
<p>This would have been 1972.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different world back then, man.</p>
<p>Like a really different world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some of that, so Carl Jung talked about the shadow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the unconscious where you have dark stuff and oftentimes you use it to project.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff that you&rsquo;re very self critical about yourself.</p>
<p>But because it&rsquo;s in your unconscious, you use it to project onto others.</p>
<p>You see it as flaws in others.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good way to, like whatever, he gives a quote, like everything that irritates</p>
<p>us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a nice way to investigate yourself.</p>
<p>Like something that pisses you off, you start asking questions of your own mind, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how you bring it to the surface.</p>
<p>But anyway, from that, those are formative years.</p>
<p>From that time, is there still stuff in your unconscious you think you haven&rsquo;t examined?</p>
<p>Some dark shit?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not aware if it is.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve looked, you know, like if someone, you know, someone says, you know, I left something</p>
<p>over your house.</p>
<p>Like, where&rsquo;d you leave it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like, all right, I&rsquo;ll go look.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get a real thorough look.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pretty sure.</p>
<p>Pretty sure it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve looked.</p>
<p>I mean, it certainly had an effect.</p>
<p>I think the positive effect also was compounded by the fact that when my mother married my</p>
<p>stepdad, who&rsquo;s a great guy, who was a hippie, very different, we moved around a lot.</p>
<p>And so the bad thing about that was I didn&rsquo;t really develop longterm friends.</p>
<p>The good thing about that was that I was forced to develop my own opinions about things instead</p>
<p>of adopting an opinion of the neighborhood and the group about anything.</p>
<p>I was forced to form my own thoughts and opinions about almost everything.</p>
<p>And so it made me much more of an independent thinker.</p>
<p>So that on top of the fact that losing my quote unquote hero very early on and then</p>
<p>having to form my own opinions about things, it left me with a very independent streak</p>
<p>in terms of&hellip;</p>
<p>And if I hadn&rsquo;t done the things that I got interested in, martial arts and then comedy,</p>
<p>if I hadn&rsquo;t gotten interested in those things, I would have been fucked because I was just</p>
<p>too independent for normal jobs.</p>
<p>I was too independent for school.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t want to listen to people.</p>
<p>I was too feral.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t want to sit still.</p>
<p>If I was with the wrong parents, especially today, I most certainly would have been medicated.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s so many possible trajectories you can imagine where you would have not been</p>
<p>the person you are today.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably one of the best possible.</p>
<p>This particular storyline you&rsquo;re living through is one of the better ones.</p>
<p>This timeline is as good as it gets for someone like me.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to people, to young kids that are living through a shitty</p>
<p>situation of any sort, a tough life?</p>
<p>Find a thing you like.</p>
<p>Try to find a thing that you really enjoy.</p>
<p>Try to find a thing that you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>Like an activity.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For me, early on, it was drawing.</p>
<p>It was illustrations.</p>
<p>It was comic books.</p>
<p>I wanted to be a comic book illustrator.</p>
<p>Then it went from comic book drawing and illustrations to martial arts.</p>
<p>It was just another thing that I was very, very passionate about.</p>
<p>That was my vehicle out of my dilemma.</p>
<p>That was my vehicle out of my own anxiety and trauma and my own issues and insecurities.</p>
<p>Find something.</p>
<p>Find a thing that you genuinely enjoy because getting good at things you genuinely enjoy</p>
<p>is extremely beneficial for young people because it lets you know that everybody thinks they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a loser.</p>
<p>Every young person thinks they&rsquo;re a loser, at least a young person in the situation I</p>
<p>was at.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know I wasn&rsquo;t a loser until I started winning, until I started doing martial arts.</p>
<p>Martial arts taught me that I could get better at stuff, that I wasn&rsquo;t really a loser.</p>
<p>I just was someone who was in a fucked up situation, but you could channel all that</p>
<p>energy that you have as a young person into something and get better at it.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden, people admired me.</p>
<p>I was like, this is crazy.</p>
<p>I went from being someone who was incredibly insecure and basically a failure to someone</p>
<p>who was really successful at this one thing that was very dangerous that other people</p>
<p>were scared of.</p>
<p>That gave me immense confidence and also a real understanding of the direct correlation</p>
<p>between hard work and success.</p>
<p>And a kind of understanding that you&rsquo;re not a loser, that there is some diamond in the</p>
<p>rough.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an understanding that you can&rsquo;t listen to people, because even my parents</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want me to do martial arts.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want me to fight.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want me to do stand up.</p>
<p>You have to understand who you are, and then in the face of other people&rsquo;s either criticism</p>
<p>or lack of faith in your ability to succeed, you push through and there&rsquo;s great benefit</p>
<p>in that.</p>
<p>And you realize that you can kind of apply that to other things in life.</p>
<p>You can apply that to critics, you can apply that to social media commentators, you can</p>
<p>apply that to a lot of things.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What about young people in their 50s?</p>
<p>Can you give advice to like, imagine you&rsquo;re sitting back, probably still here in Texas</p>
<p>in your 90s looking back, what advice would that guy give to you today?</p>
<p>Or like people that have done some shit in their 50s, you&rsquo;ve gone through hell of a life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s potentially some incentive to settle down, you got a great family to relax.</p>
<p>But maybe there&rsquo;s some incentive to still do epic shit, still be David Goggins running</p>
<p>in the middle of the desert screaming shit into a camera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re David Goggins, you have to be David Goggins.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a path for that guy that exists at this stage of his life other</p>
<p>than that.</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;ll be 70 and still screaming?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>If David and I are alive, we&rsquo;re both 70, he&rsquo;s going to call me up and say, stay hard motherfucker.</p>
<p>Guaranteed.</p>
<p>So lean into whatever the fuck you are at this point.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re enjoying it, but if you&rsquo;re not enjoying it, rethink your life.</p>
<p>Try to figure out why you&rsquo;re not enjoying it.</p>
<p>You still think it&rsquo;s possible to shift things in your 50s?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re alive, you can get better.</p>
<p>No matter what.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No matter what.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re alive, you can shift things.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re 90 years old and you have a month to live, you can apologize for the</p>
<p>things you think you did wrong and maybe reconcile and shape relationships that you have with</p>
<p>the people that are around you better, so that they feel differently about you after</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I always love people in their 70s who are like getting back into dating or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was watching a video about a woman who&rsquo;s in her 60s who just started powerlifting.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And same with Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>You see people get into Jiu Jitsu, like a white belt that&rsquo;s like 70.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of&hellip;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re alive, you can get better at stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people are happy if they don&rsquo;t have puzzles and complex tasks and things</p>
<p>that are interesting to them, whether it&rsquo;s an art project or whether it&rsquo;s learning something</p>
<p>completely new like standup comedy.</p>
<p>Doing things that are difficult, it&rsquo;s as much of a nourishment of the mind as food is a</p>
<p>nourishment of the body.</p>
<p>I think you need things that are puzzling to you where you have to find your own human</p>
<p>potential in the difficulty of the task and work your way through things.</p>
<p>At least for me, I mean, I can only speak for me because I&rsquo;m the only life that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever lived that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>And in my life, that has been a 100% constant.</p>
<p>I am a very happy person and I have never had a moment where I&rsquo;m not doing difficult</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>What matters most is how well you walk through the fires.</p>
<p>You just keep starting fires for yourself to walk through.</p>
<p>Well, they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be fires, right?</p>
<p>Because fires are like kind of out of control.</p>
<p>Lukewarm tasks.</p>
<p>Tasks.</p>
<p>The surfaces.</p>
<p>Tasks.</p>
<p>Give yourself something, an arduous, difficult task where you&rsquo;re challenged, challenged mentally</p>
<p>and challenged physically.</p>
<p>One of the great things about being challenged physically is it&rsquo;s also mental.</p>
<p>The people that don&rsquo;t understand that have never really been challenged physically.</p>
<p>People that think that physical challenges are just like, just physical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just brute grunt work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understanding your desire to quit and, you know, conquering your inner bitch.</p>
<p>All that stuff is, it&rsquo;s mental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s playing out inside your head and there&rsquo;s a mental strength that you acquire from that,</p>
<p>that you can apply to intellectual pursuits.</p>
<p>And the people that don&rsquo;t think that are the people that haven&rsquo;t attempted them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an arrogance to people that only pursue intellectual exercises, only pursue</p>
<p>intellectual things and don&rsquo;t pursue anything physical.</p>
<p>That the physical stuff is base, it&rsquo;s grunt work, it&rsquo;s primal, it&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re, I mean, obviously these people like Stephen Hawking&rsquo;s who have</p>
<p>no opportunity to do anything physical, right?</p>
<p>His physical dilemma is keeping us or was keeping his heart beating.</p>
<p>But for most people, I think you can really benefit from physical struggle and you benefit</p>
<p>from it in a mental way.</p>
<p>And I think that is overlooked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunately overlooked by academics and intellectuals who they make excuses for</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re fat and lazy or scrawny.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to be, it&rsquo;s not even about the fat or all of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like literally there&rsquo;s something about the physical challenge that&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>for you, especially if you&rsquo;re academic, especially if you do intellectual type stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this great roboticist at MIT, Russ Tedrick, he runs barefoot to and from MIT</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>I love it, like seven, seven to 10 miles each way.</p>
<p>Barefoot.</p>
<p>Well, he studies legged locomotion, legged robots, so for him, it&rsquo;s also interesting</p>
<p>how the human body moves.</p>
<p>He sees the beauty in all movement.</p>
<p>What do his feet look like?</p>
<p>You know, calloused.</p>
<p>Destroyed, right?</p>
<p>No, just calloused.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re nice.</p>
<p>They form a nice, it&rsquo;s not like I gave him a foot massage, but I mean, they look, and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a foot fetish, so I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not able to correctly evaluate another man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>feet.</p>
<p>I apologize for this, but they don&rsquo;t look fucked up.</p>
<p>Does he run on concrete?</p>
<p>Yeah, he runs all surfaces.</p>
<p>And he does everything completely barefoot?</p>
<p>The running part at work.</p>
<p>So one of the things he has to do is fit into society, which means he has to change clothes</p>
<p>and appear normal.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So does he wear like zero shoes?</p>
<p>Yeah, those barefoot type shoes?</p>
<p>No, because that&rsquo;s like very hippie, wokey type of thing.</p>
<p>No, like he doesn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s barefoot when he&rsquo;s running and then he wears like normal looking</p>
<p>stuff like dress shoes.</p>
<p>How did he work his way up to running barefoot?</p>
<p>So he was significantly overweight and his advisor, this other famous person at MIT who</p>
<p>was a roboticist, took his own life and that made him, that made Russ face his own mortality,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>I mean, you start to ask big questions about your wellbeing, like, holy shit, this ride</p>
<p>can end at any moment.</p>
<p>And so he started taking his sort of physical wellbeing seriously, but as a result of that,</p>
<p>not that he, did he become like shredded, but he&rsquo;s also discovered the intellectual</p>
<p>value, the humbling value of physical exercise.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not preachy about it at all.</p>
<p>I actually rarely hear him advise it to anyone.</p>
<p>He just does it as a, almost like meditation or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely a form of meditation and you can attest to that, right?</p>
<p>You do quite a bit of running.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing about a, you kind of, almost like a mantra gets formed and you get into</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>It was great here in the Austin heat, a hundred degree weather.</p>
<p>That tests you.</p>
<p>You know what I love to do outside?</p>
<p>Pull sleds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my thing.</p>
<p>I love to pull sleds outside.</p>
<p>In the heat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I did it today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re also, your wife is incredible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a relationship.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re married.</p>
<p>You have a great family.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to me and to others like me who are dumb fucks and have not found</p>
<p>a relationship?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re a great guy.</p>
<p>So this definitely doesn&rsquo;t necessarily apply to you, but be someone who someone would want</p>
<p>to be in a relationship with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people out there that want a great partner.</p>
<p>They want someone in a relationship, but why would someone want to be in a relationship</p>
<p>with you?</p>
<p>You know, maybe you bicker a lot.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re jealous.</p>
<p>Maybe you, uh, maybe you lie.</p>
<p>Maybe you, you know, maybe you&rsquo;re cruel, maybe you&rsquo;re, you don&rsquo;t have a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re not kind.</p>
<p>Like what is, what is it about you that people would not enjoy being around or the people</p>
<p>avoid?</p>
<p>Fix that.</p>
<p>Well, this applies to me as well.</p>
<p>Like you, you said something with Cam Haynes.</p>
<p>One of the things you admire is the, the discipline it takes to sort of juggle so many things</p>
<p>and just successfully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m very good at that.</p>
<p>So juggling all this hard work and then also a relationship.</p>
<p>Also relationship, also family, all of these kinds of priorities.</p>
<p>I mean, that requires having your shit together.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different thing, but it&rsquo;s also, you got to find the right person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people who sell for, they settle for sexy.</p>
<p>They settle for hot, settle for the wrong person.</p>
<p>Like you can get hot and nice.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t get hot and mean, hot and mean is not fun.</p>
<p>Then you get Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And then you get hot and dry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can be deceived by perfect symmetry.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea to record your partner?</p>
<p>I think you should record all conversations.</p>
<p>The CIA is doing it no matter what.</p>
<p>I assume that every conversation I have is recorded because I&rsquo;m pretty sure it is.</p>
<p>Even when we had dinner with Alex Jones, he was recording.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I still remember that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that was recording.</p>
<p>He might, you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be funny if he is the CIA.</p>
<p>He could be.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be the ultimate joke.</p>
<p>So my advice about relationships is be somebody.</p>
<p>And then also like find someone who you can grow with, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be with someone who doesn&rsquo;t share your values.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be with someone who makes excuses.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be with someone who&rsquo;s lazy or who&rsquo;s spiteful.</p>
<p>You want to be with someone who&rsquo;s like genuinely kind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things that I really love about my wife and she&rsquo;s very smart and she</p>
<p>works hard.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a dedicated, disciplined person, but she&rsquo;s also really nice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things I like the most about her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s so nice.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s always smiling.</p>
<p>And that energy is great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve seen us together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve hung around with us.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She makes you just feel great to be alive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have people like that around you.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s happy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a happy person.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s happy to be around.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of people that you could have in your life as friends and as coworkers and</p>
<p>as lovers and wives and husbands.</p>
<p>You can find those people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re real.</p>
<p>And when you find those people, your life is better.</p>
<p>To have a good tribe is very important, to have a good tribe of people.</p>
<p>And I think if there&rsquo;s anything that I&rsquo;m very, very fortunate about, it&rsquo;s the people that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m around.</p>
<p>I have very good friends and one of which is you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so valuable to have quality people around you because it makes you want to do better</p>
<p>because you admire the hard work that these people put in, like Cam Haines or Goggins</p>
<p>or many of my friends and people that are generous and people that are curious and people</p>
<p>that are honest.</p>
<p>They inspire you to do the same and it&rsquo;s extremely valuable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most valuable things is to surround yourself with positive, healthy,</p>
<p>friendly, generous people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I cut out Tim Dillon from my life.</p>
<p>I broke up with him.</p>
<p>I thought you guys were getting married.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s none of those things.</p>
<p>The Texas nonstop, the nonstop conspiracy theories, the nonstop mocking of my Eastern</p>
<p>European origins, it&rsquo;s just not healthy for me.</p>
<p>Plus he&rsquo;s physically abusive and a towering figure, both emotional and physically.</p>
<p>No, no, I love him.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If he worked out, he would be a house.</p>
<p>A brick house.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got such a large frame, you know?</p>
<p>So if I interview Putin, what should I ask him?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s the cancer?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it doing, buddy?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s question number one in Russian.</p>
<p>Do you think he has cancer?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>The narrative is terrifying, right?</p>
<p>Dictator of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world who also has cancer and he just</p>
<p>invaded a sovereign country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a terrifying narrative because that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re all afraid of.</p>
<p>Someone who has nothing to lose who just decides to let loose a nuke.</p>
<p>Well, I do think maybe it&rsquo;s projecting, but if I had cancer or if you think about leaders</p>
<p>that have cancer, you&rsquo;re facing your own mortality, I would think he would be more focused on</p>
<p>his legacy and dropping a nuclear bomb is not good for legacy.</p>
<p>I do believe he wants to be remembered as a great leader, as a lot of leaders do, as</p>
<p>a lot of even dictators do.</p>
<p>And I think he wants to figure out a way to pull out a win so he can say that whatever</p>
<p>this thing was, whatever this invasion was, was good for Russia, was good for the nation.</p>
<p>He ultimately made it a greater nation than it was before.</p>
<p>And perhaps you could justify an escalation of war to be that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the cancer thing concerns me so much because it&rsquo;s been so often part of</p>
<p>this propaganda that&rsquo;s been told about Putin that he&rsquo;s sick.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>People kind of wonder that a lot about, especially dictators, but you had that even with Hillary</p>
<p>Clinton and obviously with Biden, that narrative is stickier.</p>
<p>So for some people it&rsquo;s stickier than that.</p>
<p>Well, that narrative is transparent and obvious.</p>
<p>But the degree of it is a question with Biden as it is with everyone.</p>
<p>How healthy is this leader?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question people often ask.</p>
<p>Sure, always.</p>
<p>They were doing that about Trump too.</p>
<p>The thing about Putin though is like his appearance is altered, where he looks very bloated.</p>
<p>His body doesn&rsquo;t look much bigger, but his face looks like puffy and swollen.</p>
<p>I had a friend who had sarcoidosis and they prescribed prednisone, which is a type of</p>
<p>a steroid.</p>
<p>And one of the things that would happen when he was on it is his face would get really</p>
<p>big.</p>
<p>He was like, he would blow up like a swell up and maintain a lot of water and inflammation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it looks like when I&rsquo;m looking at Putin.</p>
<p>So actually like if you&rsquo;re sitting with him, one question is about health.</p>
<p>Has Biden been asked that kind of question?</p>
<p>Like without mockery, without any of that?</p>
<p>You would have to go on Fox News.</p>
<p>Like the mainstream media treats him with kid gloves in a way that I&rsquo;ve never seen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious there&rsquo;s something horribly wrong with his cognitive function.</p>
<p>Well, I had to push back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s horribly wrong.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s horribly wrong?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s no, I think there&rsquo;s uncertainty to which degree is wrong.</p>
<p>I would love to there to be a serious like conversation about with him.</p>
<p>In fact, I actually have to now look, cause of course Fox News will mock his like declining</p>
<p>mental health and then I would love like sort of an objective discussion.</p>
<p>Are you aware of this?</p>
<p>Are you like, what are you putting in place?</p>
<p>Are you yourself?</p>
<p>Cause if I was a person with a declining mental abilities, like you have to start thinking</p>
<p>about that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like who is around you, who are the advisors?</p>
<p>What if you start, stop being able to see the world clearly?</p>
<p>I would be transparent about that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, you would be, but you&rsquo;re also would never be a politician because you&rsquo;re too fucking</p>
<p>honest.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but actually from a conversation perspective, it would be nice if that kind</p>
<p>of discussion was sad.</p>
<p>It would be.</p>
<p>But all jokes aside with Putin, I would ask questions about democracy versus what they</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>So that without any disparaging descriptions of what is going on over in Russia, it&rsquo;s clearly</p>
<p>not a democracy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s they, I mean the way he has it set up, the elections are a joke.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>So he would push back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not clearly not a democracy.</p>
<p>He is still very popular.</p>
<p>So majority of people are huge supporters of Putin inside Russia.</p>
<p>The he would, the people that push back against that would say that that&rsquo;s because any serious</p>
<p>opposition is pushed out of the country.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it gets competition and murdered.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but yes, that&rsquo;s a really, really good question.</p>
<p>The value of dictatorships.</p>
<p>One of the things about the United States that&rsquo;s fascinating to me is that every four</p>
<p>years, unless it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s four to eight years, right?</p>
<p>One does two terms, but every four years there&rsquo;s an opportunity for someone to be new and completely</p>
<p>inexperienced at the most difficult job in the world, which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>So the interesting thing is it actually makes sense after eight years, you&rsquo;ve gained the</p>
<p>wisdom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You would actually be a pretty good leader to keep going.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there is some problem where you, the power gets started getting to your head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So from Putin&rsquo;s perspective, I think he genuinely wants the best for Russia.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s lost his mind in terms of like, it&rsquo;s all about greed and so on.</p>
<p>Same as Stalin.</p>
<p>I think Stalin until the end of his days wanted the best for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you become, Hitler I think lost his mind during the war.</p>
<p>Like where it was like he wasn&rsquo;t seen clearly at all.</p>
<p>What Putin believes is that he is actually the best person to bring out the best for</p>
<p>his country.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is maybe refreshing the leader is in fact in the long term, the best thing</p>
<p>versus every leader believes they know what&rsquo;s best for the country, the point is to keep</p>
<p>refreshing it.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the case for democracy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the case for the system we have that creates a natural, maybe emergent balance</p>
<p>of power.</p>
<p>I think it makes it evident that there is no clear cut real right way to do it.</p>
<p>And that if you had the perfect person in having them for 12, 20 years would be amazing.</p>
<p>If you had a perfect benevolent leader who clearly only cared about the people was doing</p>
<p>their best and striving hard and got great satisfaction knowing that he is a dedicated</p>
<p>civil servant that only wants to lead the country in a way that&rsquo;s going to benefit the</p>
<p>most people in the most profound way.</p>
<p>But we have a dirty political system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely corrupted by money, completely corrupted by influence.</p>
<p>The fact that the lobbyists, I mean, there&rsquo;s an area outside of Washington DC, it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the richest areas in the country and it&rsquo;s where the lobbyists live.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much money involved in being a lobbyist, there&rsquo;s so much money involved in</p>
<p>special interest groups and how much of an impact they have on who gets elected and what</p>
<p>decisions get made once that person gets elected.</p>
<p>We know this, right?</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s not for the people by the people, it&rsquo;s just not what it is.</p>
<p>I mean, this country is an experiment in self government and if we could do it all over</p>
<p>again, I would say the most important thing is to have laws in place to keep money out</p>
<p>of politics and to make it a heinous crime for someone to influence laws and policy based</p>
<p>entirely on the amount of profit it could generate for a party or for a company that</p>
<p>is investing in a candidate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fucking incredibly dangerous and it&rsquo;s corrupt and that corruption has been accepted.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just accepted that this corruption exists, you know?</p>
<p>Last question.</p>
<p>If Putin asks to see this watch, what do I tell him?</p>
<p>Would you give it?</p>
<p>Should I let him see it?</p>
<p>Because we know what happens with the Super Bowl ring.</p>
<p>I think a Super Bowl ring is unique.</p>
<p>He could buy a watch like that pretty easy, you know?</p>
<p>But this particular, isn&rsquo;t that a power move?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is the watch you gave me as a story.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I would probably share it with him, the story.</p>
<p>And then maybe you go, can I see this watch?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then he puts it on and says thank you.</p>
<p>Do you say no?</p>
<p>You go like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, there it is, bro.</p>
<p>Bro.</p>
<p>You know, take it off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got so many words I&rsquo;m going to have to find translations, buddy, bro.</p>
<p>I guess bro is brother.</p>
<p>I mean, if he takes your watch, I&rsquo;ll buy you another one if Putin steals it.</p>
<p>Keep him going.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give you the same exact watch.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, thank you for this.</p>
<p>My pleasure, bro.</p>
<p>I really wanted to talk to you because in a couple of days I&rsquo;m leaving to Ukraine and</p>
<p>Russia and I hope I&rsquo;ll be back in one piece and drink whiskey with you once again.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hope so too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nervous about you going over there.</p>
<p>You know, I know journalists have been killed now.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t know Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>No, I think you&rsquo;ll be okay and I think there&rsquo;s certain things you do in life that just kind</p>
<p>of your heart pulls towards that so much.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your objective over there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not somebody who thinks about objectives clearly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something about me says I need to go there.</p>
<p>But to put in loose words is to try to understand what that world is now.</p>
<p>So I remember what it was years ago when I was there.</p>
<p>I know my family, I know the generations of family that was there on that land in Ukraine</p>
<p>and in Russia, and the soul of the people, the love that&rsquo;s there, the beauty of the culture.</p>
<p>And I want to see what it is today and what this war has created.</p>
<p>Both the anger and the love and the people and just hear them out and just talk to them.</p>
<p>No recordings, none of that.</p>
<p>Maybe a little here and there, but mostly just for me.</p>
<p>And to see, I don&rsquo;t know, sometimes it&rsquo;s just something pulls you to a place.</p>
<p>And I also, because I&rsquo;m able to speak Russian and some Ukrainian, I do want to try to have</p>
<p>these, a couple of the political leaders involved, talk to them.</p>
<p>And I have all the right connections, everybody has said yes.</p>
<p>Of course you don&rsquo;t know the likelihood it finally happens, but I want to at least have</p>
<p>that possibility there.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to go to a place to really understand it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just read about it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just talk to the people that are living there.</p>
<p>You have to be there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never been in a war zone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been in a land that&rsquo;s been damaged and wiped by the weapons of war.</p>
<p>And I just want to feel that because so much of that land is, I remember when everything</p>
<p>was flourishing.</p>
<p>Yes, corruption, all those kinds of things, but people were there and the culture was</p>
<p>flourishing and people were happy.</p>
<p>There was lots of struggle, but they were happy.</p>
<p>And now people are extremely angry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hate in the air on all sides.</p>
<p>I want to see that.</p>
<p>I want to understand.</p>
<p>Sometimes it just pulls you and you have to go.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense perhaps, but you just got to do it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the timeline of when I&rsquo;m going?</p>
<p>How long?</p>
<p>No, one way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a plan.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hoping back in a month, but also just to clarify, I&rsquo;m not somebody who seeks risk.</p>
<p>And like, you&rsquo;re somebody who seems to be terrified of bears and sharks, so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like, so why go swim out?</p>
<p>Why go surfing?</p>
<p>Why go swim out in the ocean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m somebody that&rsquo;s the same probably with sharks too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking unnecessary risk, but certain things that just mean a lot to you, you take</p>
<p>the risk.</p>
<p>And so a little bit of risk willing to take to discover something about myself, honestly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably what it all boils down to, trying to understand myself.</p>
<p>Because so much of me is from that place.</p>
<p>Well, this is the beautiful thing about America is it&rsquo;s like stitches together all these different</p>
<p>cultures.</p>
<p>Everybody came from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you try to understand, in order for me to be a good American, I need to understand</p>
<p>who I was, where I came from.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s nothing reveals the spirit of a people better than war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s something about this conflict that&rsquo;s really cuts all the bullshit.</p>
<p>This is who we are.</p>
<p>This is who we are as a people.</p>
<p>So I want to see it.</p>
<p>I want to understand.</p>
<p>And like I said, when I come back, drink some whiskey with you.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, I hope that happens.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>And I hope you&rsquo;re safe over there.</p>
<p>And I hope you come back with whatever insight you&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing this conversation.</p>
<p>My pleasure, brother.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve done for me, for the support, for the love, and everybody</p>
<p>around you.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you&rsquo;re doing for everybody around you, for giving back, but</p>
<p>for just giving and being kind to everybody.</p>
<p>I love you, brother.</p>
<p>I love you too.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Rogan.</p>

<p>Musashi.</p>
<p>Once you know the way broadly, you will see it in everything.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
