    <p>The following is a conversation with Levi Rosman,</p>
<p>also known as Gotham Chess.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professional chess player and educator.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you check out his YouTube channel</p>
<p>called Gotham Chess.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Notion for team collaboration,</p>
<p>Athletic Greens for daily multivitamins,</p>
<p>ExpressVPN for internet security,</p>
<p>and Insight Tracker for bio-monitoring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make them interesting, but if you must skip,</p>
<p>please still check out the sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Notion,</p>
<p>a note-taking and team collaboration tool.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s most popularly known</p>
<p>for the note-taking capabilities.</p>
<p>All the cool kids go to the productivity forums</p>
<p>and subreddits and Stack Exchange.</p>
<p>Notion comes up time and time again as the stellar,</p>
<p>the top tool to use for note-taking.</p>
<p>I use it for note-taking on the individual basis.</p>
<p>But the thing that you may not know</p>
<p>that Notion is also incredibly good at</p>
<p>is the collaboration aspect of it</p>
<p>and not just any kind of collaboration,</p>
<p>but collaboration for any kind of task.</p>
<p>So we could even, for startups, for businesses,</p>
<p>for, I don&rsquo;t know, homework assignments, all of it.</p>
<p>They provide a kind of full-on operating system</p>
<p>for running every aspect of a company or a team.</p>
<p>You can learn more and get started for free at notion.com.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s AG1 Drink, which is an all-in-one day drink</p>
<p>to support daily health and peak performance.</p>
<p>Where was it?</p>
<p>Somebody sent me a Reddit in a daze.</p>
<p>I remember seeing a kind of meme</p>
<p>saying this is the Lex Friedman podcast in a nutshell,</p>
<p>or maybe the Lex Friedman experience in a nutshell.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The point is there was some kind of crappy robot</p>
<p>that has an Athletic Greens container</p>
<p>and is doing the shaking and the mixing</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff for a drink.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, but probably I would do</p>
<p>a better job engineering the system</p>
<p>and probably would not use it for that particular task.</p>
<p>Like, why introduce a machine into a task</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deeply human, my friends?</p>
<p>So yes, somehow if this was the true Lex Friedman experience</p>
<p>you probably want to add a little bit of love</p>
<p>into the whole thing, which chemically</p>
<p>and nutritionally speaking is already built in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Not just because it&rsquo;s green and delicious,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s really good for you.</p>
<p>Provides you with a nutritional basis</p>
<p>for your mental and physical excellence</p>
<p>so you can be a beautiful version of you</p>
<p>that you already are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you one month&rsquo;s supply of fish oil</p>
<p>when you sign up at athleticgreens.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I use them and have used them for many, many years</p>
<p>to protect my privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>ISPs collect your data, even if you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>Chrome Incognito to go to the shady websites</p>
<p>that you go to.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not judging, I&rsquo;m not judging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving you all the respect and props</p>
<p>you deserve, sir or madam, for all of the darkest,</p>
<p>the shadiest places you go on the internet.</p>
<p>But you should protect yourself when you do that.</p>
<p>And a good VPN is a must.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the first and the most powerful</p>
<p>layer of protection.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN is my favorite, it&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve always used,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s the one I really wanna recommend.</p>
<p>You can do all kinds of other stuff, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is it works fast, it works on any device,</p>
<p>including, yes, on Linux, Android, anything, anything.</p>
<p>You can go to expressvpn.com slash LexPod</p>
<p>to get an extra three months free.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of plans, most of which includes</p>
<p>blood tests that give you information</p>
<p>based on which machine learning algorithms</p>
<p>will give you advice after analyzing your blood data,</p>
<p>DNA data, fitness tracker data, all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll give you advice based on what&rsquo;s going on inside you</p>
<p>on what you should do with your life.</p>
<p>Maybe diet and lifestyle changes, not career changes,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;d be pretty cool,</p>
<p>where your DNA data could tell you,</p>
<p>hey, maybe that career that you wanted as a chocolatier,</p>
<p>is that the right way to say chocolatier?</p>
<p>Like a person who makes chocolate, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even gonna check, I can look it up online,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just gonna go with it.</p>
<p>And then you can clip this out to embarrass me</p>
<p>as the internet seems to do with all the stupid things</p>
<p>I say, I say so many stupid things,</p>
<p>and they accumulate over time,</p>
<p>and all I can do is just laugh at myself</p>
<p>and appreciate you, sir or madam, for laughing along with me.</p>
<p>Anyway, InsideTracker&rsquo;s incredible,</p>
<p>because the best health advice, medical advice,</p>
<p>all kinds of advice I think should be grounded</p>
<p>based on the data that comes from you.</p>
<p>Get special savings for a limited time</p>
<p>when you go to InsideTracker.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Levy Rosman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re known for being able to guess people&rsquo;s ELO rating,</p>
<p>so what do you think, just by looking at my face,</p>
<p>deep into my eyes, what&rsquo;s my ELO rating?</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;ll help you, I&rsquo;ll do E4 for the listener.</p>
<p>I actually read that Stockfish prefers E4.</p>
<p>Does it really?</p>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Because it maximizes the number of tactical options.</p>
<p>So. That makes sense.</p>
<p>The right answer is 3400, which is, I believe, Stockfish.</p>
<p>You guess people&rsquo;s ELO chest rating, what&rsquo;s that take?</p>
<p>How hard is it to do that,</p>
<p>and how would you actually do that?</p>
<p>Like, what are telltale signs of red flags</p>
<p>about a person at different ratings?</p>
<p>Is there something you look for?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you can separate it something like,</p>
<p>the very first, the zero to about 8900.</p>
<p>For simplicity&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna use the Chess.com rating system,</p>
<p>because Lichess is slightly different.</p>
<p>It tends to go two, 300 points higher than Chess.com,</p>
<p>sometimes even four, 500 points higher.</p>
<p>But then it catches up,</p>
<p>they catch up around 22, 2300, I would say.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Chess.com, what&rsquo;s Lichess?</p>
<p>Can you, like, explain what the difference is</p>
<p>and what they are?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re two chess websites.</p>
<p>Good starting point.</p>
<p>Yes, Chess.com is, it has, obviously, the free option,</p>
<p>where you can play games,</p>
<p>you get some sort of puzzles every single day,</p>
<p>you get some sort of lessons every single day.</p>
<p>But then they have tiered memberships,</p>
<p>where you can pay annually or per month,</p>
<p>that you can unlock all the other features.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Like, for training, for puzzles and all that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, they have unlimited puzzles,</p>
<p>but they also have,</p>
<p>their biggest selling point, for sure,</p>
<p>is, like, a dedicated game review</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, like, very flashy and sophisticated,</p>
<p>and the coach will literally tell you what you did wrong</p>
<p>every single moment the computer evaluated a mistake.</p>
<p>But the most important thing that they have</p>
<p>is they offer international masters, grandmasters,</p>
<p>the opportunity to make video lesson libraries,</p>
<p>which, hundreds of hours of anything.</p>
<p>I can even learn some stuff on there, probably.</p>
<p>I have anal beads that are communicating</p>
<p>with stock fish via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to that.</p>
<p>Yes, we will get to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s epic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually scary how many people think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a real thing, by the way,</p>
<p>which is the danger of the internet.</p>
<p>But yeah, we will get into that.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that people believing</p>
<p>a thing that&rsquo;s hilarious at scale</p>
<p>will make that thing a reality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Elon on this.</p>
<p>I think people manifest the meme.</p>
<p>The meme becomes real.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, in all walks of life,</p>
<p>I think there is something about humor</p>
<p>sort of being, why did I,</p>
<p>I was gonna, what I was going to say</p>
<p>is I feel like humor becomes a lubricant</p>
<p>for the trajectory of human civilization,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know why the word lubricant went into my head,</p>
<p>which I understand, but it&rsquo;s very Freudian.</p>
<p>Anyway, so zero to 900,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a 1300 player, you were saying.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not good at end games,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand how to convert positions</p>
<p>that have seven or eight pieces left on the board.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know when you&rsquo;re supposed to activate your king.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how a bishop outplays a knight</p>
<p>with just several pawns on the board.</p>
<p>Those are all very important things</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just about knowing</p>
<p>the theoretical end games.</p>
<p>Some positions in chess are literally solved.</p>
<p>If I showed you a position,</p>
<p>I asked what&rsquo;s the evaluation and how do you win it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a technique.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to know that technique.</p>
<p>And the coaches on chess.com can help or no?</p>
<p>Yeah, so these lesson libraries,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like a live lesson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pre-recorded training position,</p>
<p>walk you through it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a dynamic factor as well,</p>
<p>where you can practice.</p>
<p>You can practice the theoretical</p>
<p>and you can practice a practical game</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no set format to do something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just based on your previous experience.</p>
<p>Basically Lichess is their entire thing</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s an open source website</p>
<p>that tries to be as free as possible</p>
<p>and operates totally on donations.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any advertisements.</p>
<p>Which is weird because normally in big competitive settings,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all capitalistic.</p>
<p>You have one big entity and another big entity</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both for profit.</p>
<p>But in this case, the big argument is,</p>
<p>well, they offer a lot of things for free.</p>
<p>You can analyze your games for free.</p>
<p>You can go into Lichess&rsquo;s lessons library</p>
<p>and do things for free.</p>
<p>The comparison that I always make is chess.com</p>
<p>is basically like having a good personal trainer</p>
<p>and having someone to help you at the gym.</p>
<p>Lichess says you have to do all the stuff yourself.</p>
<p>So you can combine YouTube with Lichess.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s gonna really point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>You gotta go fully explore on your own.</p>
<p>If you wanna do it, you can.</p>
<p>I also like to say, can I make a controversial joke?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ardent Lichess supporters are like very angry,</p>
<p>only vegetarian or vegan folks</p>
<p>because they will tear you apart</p>
<p>and try to convert you as much as possible.</p>
<p>Did you just point a large number of haters</p>
<p>onto this very podcast?</p>
<p>Is this what just happened?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is there like several people</p>
<p>that were very upset at you right now?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And throwing things?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the joke that I&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>because if people have chess.com,</p>
<p>and I love all people,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just saying chess.com patrons</p>
<p>do not try to actively convert folks on Lichess.</p>
<p>Folks on Lichess are like,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a meme chess.com.</p>
<p>Chess.com.</p>
<p>And started at Lichess.</p>
<p>Started somewhere on Reddit, Anarchy Chess,</p>
<p>kind of a-</p>
<p>Oh, so Lichess is a little bit of an anarchist organization.</p>
<p>Would you go as far as to say</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a terrorist extremist organization?</p>
<p>Are we going there?</p>
<p>For legal reasons, that&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>I thought Lichess has like really good analysis.</p>
<p>Somebody, does it have an engine for analysis of like games?</p>
<p>Or is that an open source thing that like-</p>
<p>They both do.</p>
<p>They both do Stockfish 15.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then the rest is the interface around Stockfish</p>
<p>that shows-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the life.</p>
<p>So chess has a live server</p>
<p>where you and I can play a game against each other.</p>
<p>We just both seek.</p>
<p>And if we have the same rating,</p>
<p>we have the same criteria, we&rsquo;ll play a game.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also reviewing your own games.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an opening database.</p>
<p>So you can see what the most popular trends are.</p>
<p>So Lichess is great.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m sponsored by chess.com</p>
<p>and I will openly say that,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t have-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re deeply biased.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also complimenting the competitor.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>But can you play games on Lichess?</p>
<p>Or is it just for analysis?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you can.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same exact thing.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re like legitimately competitors.</p>
<p>Not exactly the same thing,</p>
<p>but they have the,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to match for features,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying Lichess is more chaotic</p>
<p>and then chess.com is more like professional.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s chaotic.</p>
<p>I just know that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you have to,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s going to hold your hand if you,</p>
<p>if you go to Lichess.</p>
<p>You absolutely can.</p>
<p>You can play games,</p>
<p>you can analyze your games,</p>
<p>but you have to discover it yourself.</p>
<p>The whole point of chess.com</p>
<p>is to make the journey as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But I also firmly believe</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have any sort of growth in chess</p>
<p>without a chess.com or a chess24.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s chess24?</p>
<p>So chess24 was another live server</p>
<p>with some lesson libraries and so on,</p>
<p>but they were,</p>
<p>I think the process was they were bought by PlayMagnus.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s PlayMagnus?</p>
<p>PlayMagnus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Magnus Carlsen&rsquo;s thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, he doesn&rsquo;t own it.</p>
<p>He owns some stake in it,</p>
<p>I think nine or 10%.</p>
<p>They owned a bunch of chess companies,</p>
<p>including chess24,</p>
<p>but now it seems like they&rsquo;re either merging</p>
<p>or basically getting acquired by chess.com.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And PlayMagnus, it&rsquo;s an app also</p>
<p>where you can play magic at different levels,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the educational stuff?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>The for-profit chess companies</p>
<p>make the option for grandmasters to make a living</p>
<p>to make chess an e-sport.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lichess is great.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t put on any events.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no commentary.</p>
<p>So you can have both in theory</p>
<p>and probably some controversy is good.</p>
<p>Does chess.com like sponsor you?</p>
<p>Like help you out in some way?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the connection between your videos</p>
<p>and streams and so on in chess.com?</p>
<p>Like are they supporting people in that way or no?</p>
<p>My content, they don&rsquo;t necessarily,</p>
<p>I just make whatever I want.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have, I&rsquo;ve not sensed,</p>
<p>like if they do something stupid,</p>
<p>I will call out their leadership.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, but to have the logo up,</p>
<p>like in my YouTube videos or on my,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s just that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So anyway, back to, I mean, that was really helpful.</p>
<p>I was confused about all that.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>The guessing people&rsquo;s rating.</p>
<p>So the thing you mentioned about the end game,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know what the hell</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing with the end game,</p>
<p>what does that mean about your rating?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how to finish</p>
<p>with just a few pieces on the board.</p>
<p>You could be my rating.</p>
<p>End game is tough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the self-deprecating humor we tuned in for.</p>
<p>End games are hard, man.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tough.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t have, there&rsquo;s a reason Magnus is the best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because seven hours into a game</p>
<p>when everybody&rsquo;s given up,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s still squeezing juice out of the fruit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way I would describe it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not a good source of information if you-</p>
<p>No, within the first 15 moves, generally you can tell,</p>
<p>because you can tell how well they played the opening.</p>
<p>So how well they knew what they were supposed to memorize,</p>
<p>what they were supposed to play,</p>
<p>and then how they react to piece interactions.</p>
<p>So if they are faced with a move</p>
<p>that a more advanced player would deal with very swiftly,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s kind of a natural response,</p>
<p>that gives you information.</p>
<p>If they move their king when they&rsquo;re in check</p>
<p>when they didn&rsquo;t have to, that&rsquo;s a massive giveaway.</p>
<p>Some people just think, oh, I&rsquo;m in check,</p>
<p>so I have to move my king.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like how direct the response</p>
<p>of your play is to the danger.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re more moving multiple pieces at a time,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re moving,</p>
<p>the pieces are tied together in interesting ways,</p>
<p>and then, okay, okay.</p>
<p>Like what about the opening, can you tell also?</p>
<p>Because a lot of people can memorize openings, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it takes two to tango.</p>
<p>So you could memorize a bunch of stuff,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re 900 and I&rsquo;m 900,</p>
<p>my rating is fluctuating all over the place</p>
<p>in this podcast, I feel, so 13, 900.</p>
<p>You can memorize things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna play some crap,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t play the way you memorize them,</p>
<p>because I have to respond to you in certain ways.</p>
<p>So you will either respond the way you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to respond,</p>
<p>and that will probably be incorrect,</p>
<p>or now you have to figure out</p>
<p>how to deal with the fresh position.</p>
<p>Oh, so the 900 will reflect itself in both cases.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I wonder if actually,</p>
<p>so do you know your current rating or no?</p>
<p>Or your top rating, what was your top?</p>
<p>I know both my current ELO, like over the board,</p>
<p>now is 2320, my peak was 2430.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>So can you play like a 900 player?</p>
<p>Can you force yourself?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you can, given that you&rsquo;ve guessed a lot of ELO ratings,</p>
<p>can you kind of emulate that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of an interesting question.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Before I was doing YouTube and Twitch,</p>
<p>I was teaching kids, so I had to.</p>
<p>Not only did I have to play at their rating,</p>
<p>I also had to play and sometimes even behave</p>
<p>and explain things in a way that the kid could understand.</p>
<p>So absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what contributed</p>
<p>to the growth of the channel, frankly.</p>
<p>I kind of understood how beginners thought about the game.</p>
<p>So yeah, you did, you taught people chess,</p>
<p>you coached people for many years, I guess in New York.</p>
<p>Yeah, New York.</p>
<p>What did you learn about the way people learn from that?</p>
<p>So like, how did people that were successful</p>
<p>at getting good at chess quickly,</p>
<p>what were some of the commonalities,</p>
<p>some of the patterns that you saw?</p>
<p>Obsession, yeah.</p>
<p>What does obsession look like?</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s obsession and also love of the game.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re bored, you don&rsquo;t want to watch a show,</p>
<p>you want to boot up chess.com</p>
<p>or LeeChess just for,</p>
<p>just so I don&rsquo;t get flamed by anyone in the audience.</p>
<p>And you just play-</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying LeeChess people</p>
<p>are the ones that would attack aggressively?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the kind of people-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the Chess24 people.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s another-</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not, I didn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I thought Chess24 was part of the Chess.com-</p>
<p>Well, now, yes, that&rsquo;s the joke.</p>
<p>Cult or tribe or whatever terms you want to use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s even more places to play live.</p>
<p>There always have been more places to play live,</p>
<p>but Chess.com, LeeChess, Dominate,</p>
<p>and well, Chess24 is rough for live interface.</p>
<p>Of course, they have good courses and everything, but-</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it, I get it.</p>
<p>And some are even good people or whatever that quote goes.</p>
<p>Okay, like obsession,</p>
<p>that means the way they look at the board,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re bored,</p>
<p>how quickly do they return to the chess board,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Just like how many hours a day they want to spend.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They spend and want to spend.</p>
<p>Some kids definitely have a talent.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s this eternal debate,</p>
<p>talent versus hard work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily know</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a talent for chess specifically,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a talent for,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some sort of spatial visualization.</p>
<p>In your mind, you start picking up</p>
<p>what squares are controlled by your pieces</p>
<p>and opponent&rsquo;s pieces faster.</p>
<p>Your memory is much stronger.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t just learn openings like we discussed,</p>
<p>you learn literal patterns such as,</p>
<p>oh, I remember this from two tournaments ago.</p>
<p>I remember this from a game I played just yesterday.</p>
<p>And you just keep playing and playing and playing.</p>
<p>But I think the one commonality,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve seen in all kids,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obsession, you have to play a lot.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen kids who are brilliant kids.</p>
<p>If you give them a page of tactics, puzzles,</p>
<p>they solve faster than anybody.</p>
<p>They can pick things up here super fast.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a pleasure to teach.</p>
<p>They go to a tournament, disaster.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t handle the anxiousness.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t handle that silent face-to-face war</p>
<p>with another six-year-old.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even handle it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also trash talk.</p>
<p>One sentence by a kid can throw off your prize student.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen kids just totally disintegrate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen also my students bully other kids.</p>
<p>My student wasn&rsquo;t that strong.</p>
<p>But their verbal warfare, which is not allowed,</p>
<p>but goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not even verbal warfare,</p>
<p>like just going like, hmm.</p>
<p>Like literal, like facial expressions</p>
<p>you would make at the board.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t even think about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty creepy, the intensity.</p>
<p>Not creepy, that&rsquo;s not the right word.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an intensity in that silence over the board.</p>
<p>Like you can probably hear stuff like,</p>
<p>just like, it&rsquo;s super quiet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a library.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s just a tension that builds.</p>
<p>You can hear the breathing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and at the highest level,</p>
<p>both sides are involved in a battle</p>
<p>that they both foresee 99% of the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the scary part,</p>
<p>is that you both see the exact same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare you play a move and I didn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that I mis-evaluated it.</p>
<p>I saw the move could be played,</p>
<p>but I missed something three or four moves deeper.</p>
<p>And you play that move and suddenly you&rsquo;re excited</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m nervous.</p>
<p>But all of a sudden you make an inaccuracy</p>
<p>and now the tide shifts, right?</p>
<p>We could be on totally different planes throughout the game</p>
<p>or we could be on the same plane throughout the game.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, so your thought is when you see a move</p>
<p>that to you seems suboptimal and you start to think,</p>
<p>what was that?</p>
<p>You start to try to make sense of that.</p>
<p>Did you miscalculate or did they miscalculate?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what Magnus is really good at,</p>
<p>is taking people away from making suboptimal moves,</p>
<p>to take them away from the known openings?</p>
<p>Or is that unfair to say?</p>
<p>Yeah, he gets part of his really dominant reputation,</p>
<p>I think, from not letting people get</p>
<p>into ultra theoretical positions.</p>
<p>He just won this tournament, this online tournament,</p>
<p>and he said he had a young player strategy.</p>
<p>He had an anti, sorry, a anti young player strategy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>It means that by move seven or eight,</p>
<p>you go to the database, no games.</p>
<p>Kid is on their own, they have to swim on their own.</p>
<p>And they have to deal with the strategic complexities</p>
<p>of the position, which he just, he gets.</p>
<p>And he might get from just an enormous database</p>
<p>within his brain of historical games</p>
<p>that have similar structures, or just sheer genius.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mix of the two, for sure.</p>
<p>The younger you are, you can&rsquo;t remember a game played</p>
<p>in 1951 in some bar in the Soviet Union, but he does.</p>
<p>Because he read a book once, or a magazine once.</p>
<p>And he just remembers it.</p>
<p>He just remembers, and he remembers the structure,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy, right?</p>
<p>What do you think makes him, if we can sort of linger on it,</p>
<p>what do you think makes him so good?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the memory, and I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>he just seems to get the game better than anybody else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way I can describe it.</p>
<p>In sports, you have reaction time, you have strength,</p>
<p>you have, but also as he&rsquo;s now evolving, it&rsquo;s stamina.</p>
<p>So there have been games that if you put two other</p>
<p>27, 50 rated players, or world top 10 players,</p>
<p>they would have drawn the game.</p>
<p>The game would have ended.</p>
<p>The game, nobody would have won it.</p>
<p>You put Magnus as one of the aggressors in that game,</p>
<p>suddenly the chance of victory doubles from 5% to 10%.</p>
<p>Yeah, weird.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>Because what is it, game six against Netball League?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t Stockfish say that it&rsquo;s supposed to be a draw?</p>
<p>So 0.00 does mean a draw sometimes,</p>
<p>but other times it means,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the joke I always make,</p>
<p>it means that Stockfish is out for a smoke break.</p>
<p>It just, it can&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>Can you explain the joke, and can you explain 0.00?</p>
<p>Yes, so when, so Stockfish will show an evaluation</p>
<p>which determines whether the position is equal,</p>
<p>slightly better for one side,</p>
<p>slightly better for the other side, or completely winning.</p>
<p>You can, 0.00, 0.2, minus 0.2,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all within a balance.</p>
<p>You can say, okay, black has a little sprinkle of activity,</p>
<p>something, white has that.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s 0.00, it could be literally a dead draw,</p>
<p>meaning theoretically just impossible to win.</p>
<p>But oftentimes what that means is,</p>
<p>the smoke break joke is, Stockfish doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There is so much complexity within the position,</p>
<p>the combinations of different moves</p>
<p>that are acceptable and okay, it cannot evaluate correctly.</p>
<p>Wow, so even the end games are tough for Stockfish.</p>
<p>Which is why Magnus won that game</p>
<p>because there was practical value remaining.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a dead draw.</p>
<p>He continued to ask questions</p>
<p>over the course of six or seven hours.</p>
<p>He would sacrifice a pawn,</p>
<p>he would sacrifice another pawn to damage the structure.</p>
<p>Valuation stayed the same</p>
<p>because a machine could stop him, but not Jan.</p>
<p>And that was one of my favorite,</p>
<p>that game ruined my whole day, by the way.</p>
<p>It destroyed, because I made so many plans that day,</p>
<p>it completely ruined my day,</p>
<p>but it was a very worthy recap.</p>
<p>You were just all in.</p>
<p>You watched that whole game?</p>
<p>I watched the whole game</p>
<p>and the world championship was a crazy time</p>
<p>because I wanted to be first with the recap video,</p>
<p>but I also wanted to be best with the recap video.</p>
<p>So I spent all the hours of the games</p>
<p>watching all the live broadcasts</p>
<p>and getting all the information, all the variations</p>
<p>and trying to put that into the recap.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It was a huge adrenaline dump when it was all over.</p>
<p>So just for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most recent world championship.</p>
<p>So you had a, I mean, that was a draw after draw</p>
<p>after draw after draw.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it was kind of boring in that way.</p>
<p>Or maybe, are draws,</p>
<p>is there like non-boring parts within the draw to you</p>
<p>when you were like just studying it carefully?</p>
<p>For me, yes.</p>
<p>For the average viewer, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>Especially when the game itself is not that exciting.</p>
<p>When Magnus plays a strange move on move nine or 10</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t ever been played,</p>
<p>and then Jan has to try to exploit it and he fails</p>
<p>and no attack builds up</p>
<p>and they shuffle their pieces for three hours.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when the commentator&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why he did that.</p>
<p>I wonder why he did that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When the commentators are confused,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my, as a person who&rsquo;s just a spectator,</p>
<p>just like, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Because then you, the most interesting part</p>
<p>is about listening to the commentators</p>
<p>who I guess themselves might be grandmasters.</p>
<p>All.</p>
<p>Yeah, they are trying to,</p>
<p>I guess just like Nepo, just like Magnus,</p>
<p>try to figure out what&rsquo;s the idea here?</p>
<p>What are you thinking?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting part of the game.</p>
<p>But other than that, it seemed,</p>
<p>yeah, I was sure this was just gonna keep being a draw,</p>
<p>especially in that situation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost, it seems almost remarkable</p>
<p>that Magnus was able to pull out a win in game six.</p>
<p>And after that, at least Magnus said that that ends it.</p>
<p>Because now Nepo&rsquo;s gonna have to take more risks</p>
<p>and that opens it up to pure chess.</p>
<p>And then, who was it?</p>
<p>Steve Prefontaine said, whenever there&rsquo;s a race</p>
<p>is down to pure guts, then that&rsquo;s when I win it.</p>
<p>There was also a conversation about Jan&rsquo;s first half,</p>
<p>second half in any tournament.</p>
<p>In the first half, he&rsquo;s just brilliant on fire.</p>
<p>You could even say he was outplaying Magnus,</p>
<p>but the entire conversation before the match was,</p>
<p>Jan slows down.</p>
<p>And at the first sign of a loss or a setback,</p>
<p>the match might fall apart.</p>
<p>And that was the worst way to lose.</p>
<p>There was literally no worse way.</p>
<p>And it just got worse from there and there.</p>
<p>I mean, it was one move mistakes and,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Jan has won the candidates again.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna play for the world championship, so.</p>
<p>Who you got?</p>
<p>Who you got?</p>
<p>What is this slang terminology?</p>
<p>Can we like somehow edit that into a more sophisticated</p>
<p>with a British accent type of phraseology?</p>
<p>Okay, who do you think will win that match?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 55-45, but I don&rsquo;t know for who.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very close.</p>
<p>You can make both cases.</p>
<p>You could say Ding,</p>
<p>you could say Jan has been here before.</p>
<p>You can say to the world championship stage,</p>
<p>he knows what it&rsquo;s like to have a training camp</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>His playing style is very,</p>
<p>but you can also say Ding Liren</p>
<p>is one of the most stable,</p>
<p>unemotional chess players.</p>
<p>And Ding oftentimes goes from down to up.</p>
<p>So in the candidates,</p>
<p>he lost to Jan in the very first game.</p>
<p>14 round tournament, he got demolished in the first game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he was suffering from jet lag, the flight.</p>
<p>He came to Spain like two days before the games began,</p>
<p>which was crazy to me.</p>
<p>And he got second place by the end.</p>
<p>His chances of finishing in the top two were like 2%.</p>
<p>After that first round game,</p>
<p>people wrote him off completely.</p>
<p>So he doesn&rsquo;t go from top down.</p>
<p>He goes the opposite way.</p>
<p>And if he loses, he might come back.</p>
<p>But the truth is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The truth is it&rsquo;s gonna be an interesting match.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also disappointing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna get Magnus in it.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you think about him stepping away</p>
<p>from the world championship?</p>
<p>Are you a romantic about the world championships?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not a romantic about anything, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine what-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>That went dark quickly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m sophisticated enough to be a romantic.</p>
<p>I think I taught chess and now I make YouTube videos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not qualified on the subject of romanticism, but I-</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a beautiful game?</p>
<p>Chess?</p>
<p>No, I think it is a beautiful game.</p>
<p>There you go, I got you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that considered being a romantic?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was seeing the beauty in the&hellip;</p>
<p>You can be like Bach and seeing the math in the music,</p>
<p>but you can see the beauty, the magic.</p>
<p>I think I see beauty in certain types of chess, for sure.</p>
<p>Not in all chess, so I&rsquo;ll partially romantic.</p>
<p>Part-time romantic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what do you feel about Magnus stepping away</p>
<p>from the world championships?</p>
<p>Disappointing, but understandable.</p>
<p>Can you still man his case?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s understandable about it to you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as prestigious as it could be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think-</p>
<p>The world championships?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Why does Magnus still sign everything as world champion?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point, that he did just put out a statement</p>
<p>and he did say-</p>
<p>But he does it everywhere else too.</p>
<p>Does he really?</p>
<p>Yeah, like world champion, right?</p>
<p>World champion.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>World chess champion.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just because he won it,</p>
<p>but he thinks that the journey to the top once again</p>
<p>to maintain the status quo has lost its appeal.</p>
<p>Well, you know what the example that I like to make?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of UFC.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve never really seen,</p>
<p>with the exception of George St. Pierre walking,</p>
<p>and Khabib, but Khabib was kind of a different story,</p>
<p>walking away from a belt at the absolute zenith</p>
<p>of their career.</p>
<p>But also in the UFC,</p>
<p>champions are extremely well taken care of.</p>
<p>And the champions have some of the best lives.</p>
<p>Of course, you can argue not all champions.</p>
<p>You can say some of the lower weight divisions, yes.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is a lot of them get all the sponsors.</p>
<p>They get massive, massive paydays.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re international celebrities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think chess has that.</p>
<p>In fact, the world championship of chess prize fund</p>
<p>has not changed much in like 40 years.</p>
<p>So you could probably make more money on YouTube.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Playing randos, not randos, but other,</p>
<p>having fun and playing challenging,</p>
<p>really challenging games,</p>
<p>playing other super grandmasters,</p>
<p>like an ad hoc events,</p>
<p>or maybe a little bit organized events,</p>
<p>but not the world championship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And still have a lot of fun, make a lot of money,</p>
<p>get everybody excited, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for Magnus specifically,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re using him because he&rsquo;s the world champion.</p>
<p>If you tally, if he wins every tournament</p>
<p>that he plays in over the course of a year,</p>
<p>which is really not even that crazy of an estimate,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really how it seems sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much money that is.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tallied,</p>
<p>but if he dedicated an entire year</p>
<p>to being managed on social media and doing various things</p>
<p>and growing all his brands and getting sponsor deals,</p>
<p>I think he would make five times more</p>
<p>than being the world champion, which is crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, but money isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>I know, that&rsquo;s totally fair.</p>
<p>People dedicate their whole life to winning the Olympics.</p>
<p>The Olympics is an interesting one too,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t even watch the Olympics</p>
<p>as carefully as I usually do.</p>
<p>This year, yeah, me neither.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really strange.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why that is.</p>
<p>And during COVID, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>That was weird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s losing its magic.</p>
<p>Part of it is also the people that own the Olympics</p>
<p>and the way they distribute it,</p>
<p>they make it a little bit more difficult to watch.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it should all be just available on YouTube</p>
<p>and easily accessible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the difference between SpaceX</p>
<p>and some other, even NASA.</p>
<p>Just SpaceX is better at streaming their launches</p>
<p>and commentating them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve made NASA better as well,</p>
<p>but just the ability, it sounds ridiculous,</p>
<p>but making it more frictionless for people to watch,</p>
<p>get excited, to share, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure where the magic balance is</p>
<p>between the classy, traditional world championships</p>
<p>and the dramatic, exciting streamer world.</p>
<p>And it feels like for the world championships</p>
<p>to be relevant, they have to find that balance.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, this recent one had, I was-</p>
<p>It was pretty good commentating, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not even necessarily talking about myself.</p>
<p>There was a lot of-</p>
<p>No, that was the worst part for me.</p>
<p>No, you did amazing, yeah.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>It was a lot of, it was a big arms race.</p>
<p>So every major chess platform</p>
<p>tried to get one super grandmaster.</p>
<p>Vishwanathan Anand, Fabiano Caruana, you name it.</p>
<p>They were basically involved.</p>
<p>And to go back to that point, yeah,</p>
<p>the big question is money.</p>
<p>And if Magnus is not motivated by money,</p>
<p>if the prize fund for the next world championship</p>
<p>was $10 million, would he play it?</p>
<p>If he says no, then it must be something else.</p>
<p>It must just be a matter of something&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>You got to take him at his word.</p>
<p>And his word is like, there&rsquo;s too much stress</p>
<p>to the low sample play.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like I want to play many more times.</p>
<p>Yeah, he wants to play more.</p>
<p>He wants to-</p>
<p>Shorter games.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, more shorter games.</p>
<p>Like where you can increase the possibility of pure chess.</p>
<p>Whatever the heck that means.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we can&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>to the first Karpov-Kasparov match,</p>
<p>which they had to stop due to health concerns.</p>
<p>I mean, the guy went down five nil</p>
<p>and it was first to six wins and draws didn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>So draws didn&rsquo;t amass to the total score.</p>
<p>There was no best of system.</p>
<p>So what happened there?</p>
<p>The match went something like seven, eight months.</p>
<p>Kasparov started making a comeback</p>
<p>after being down five nothing.</p>
<p>He was five three and they called it off.</p>
<p>They said both players are in poor health conditions.</p>
<p>Kasparov stormed down, yelled that this is a farce.</p>
<p>But the match was 50 games long, even more maybe.</p>
<p>I made a video and I don&rsquo;t even remember</p>
<p>how many games it was.</p>
<p>It was so long.</p>
<p>Can you imagine?</p>
<p>Bobby Fischer wanted something almost as extreme.</p>
<p>Draws don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s first one to 10 wins.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s nine, nine,</p>
<p>the world champion retains his title.</p>
<p>So you have to beat the world champion 10, eight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way.</p>
<p>Do you don&rsquo;t like that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just grueling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe I like it for the YouTube recaps,</p>
<p>but do I like it for the players?</p>
<p>Do I like it for general public?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s three, four hours, right?</p>
<p>Imagine your favorite tennis match was six months long.</p>
<p>What are we doing?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a magic to the world championship.</p>
<p>I wish they could make it some interesting,</p>
<p>they make it work somehow.</p>
<p>But I think Magnus is really challenging FIDE</p>
<p>and everybody else to step up</p>
<p>and try to figure that out,</p>
<p>which is great ultimately.</p>
<p>Who would you say is the greatest of all time?</p>
<p>Can you make the case?</p>
<p>You mentioned Kasparov.</p>
<p>Can you make the case for Kasparov?</p>
<p>Can you make the case for Magnus Carlsen,</p>
<p>Bobby Fischer, Tall?</p>
<p>In my opinion,</p>
<p>you can make a case for Magnus, Gary, and Bobby Fischer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of the folks that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I mean, Capablanca was brilliant.</p>
<p>You can argue Steinitz was brilliant,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s probably Kasparov</p>
<p>and Magnus has a chance to overtake it.</p>
<p>So the longevity is really important to you</p>
<p>when you were thinking about this.</p>
<p>Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>I think Magnus is very, very close.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s extremely close.</p>
<p>What would be the magic?</p>
<p>You gotta get that sixth one.</p>
<p>Oh, so the-</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>So the world championships matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like basketball, right?</p>
<p>It all comes down to how many rings did this person win?</p>
<p>What about, well, basketball doesn&rsquo;t have this,</p>
<p>the number of years at number one, right?</p>
<p>Like rating, sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is what Magnus really likes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there is a nice system of rating</p>
<p>of who is ranked number one.</p>
<p>It has to do not with some championships</p>
<p>or low sample tournaments.</p>
<p>It has to do with general.</p>
<p>Game after game after game helps estimate more accurately</p>
<p>the ELO rating, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s been world number one for, I think, 11 years,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Which is still less than-</p>
<p>Gary was world number one for 20 years.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is quite wild.</p>
<p>But still lower rating, I think, than Magnus now, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think rating in general has sort of-</p>
<p>Allegedly.</p>
<p>It got inflated?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Is there a truth to that?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t speak to how exactly it happened,</p>
<p>but it also happens online.</p>
<p>If you go back just three or four years,</p>
<p>I think some of the best Blitz players on,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, chess.com were 27, 2,800,</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re 3,200.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just sort of what happens,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t exactly know.</p>
<p>I will mention that there was a very strange change,</p>
<p>not exactly sure when the year was, in FIDE,</p>
<p>so over-the-board chess,</p>
<p>where if you were under the age of 16 or 18 years old,</p>
<p>one of those two, and you were below 2,300, okay?</p>
<p>Your rating change factor was three to four times higher.</p>
<p>So just imagine what that means.</p>
<p>Magnus has a rating change factor of, let&rsquo;s say, one.</p>
<p>I have a rating change factor also of one.</p>
<p>Anybody over the rating 2,400</p>
<p>has the same rating change factor.</p>
<p>What is the rating change factor?</p>
<p>So if you win-</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a formula,</p>
<p>and basically, let&rsquo;s say, at the very base level,</p>
<p>five-point change, if your rating change factor is one.</p>
<p>You beat somebody, you gain five points.</p>
<p>Those kids who were under 18 and under 2,300,</p>
<p>their rating change factor was four,</p>
<p>so their ratings were going up four times higher</p>
<p>and four times up and down compared to normal folks,</p>
<p>and there was one teenager in the US in particular</p>
<p>who, in one month, played a bunch of tournaments</p>
<p>with his rating change factor</p>
<p>and became nearly rated 2,640,</p>
<p>which is top 50 in the world.</p>
<p>He was just a random teenager from the United States.</p>
<p>He became a grandmaster ultimately,</p>
<p>but he bled like 90 points down</p>
<p>because his rating was so inflated,</p>
<p>and the K40 exists now.</p>
<p>I mean, you have many kids who, out of nowhere,</p>
<p>2,100, 2,100, 2,400 after one good month.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like similar to how TikTok inflates</p>
<p>your virality early on.</p>
<p>Does it?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, at least the rumor is like</p>
<p>they want you to get engaged,</p>
<p>and I thought there was even artificial likes and so on</p>
<p>that they want you to get that dopamine addiction.</p>
<p>So maybe they want to throw you,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really passionate about chess,</p>
<p>they want you to throw you to the sharks</p>
<p>by artificially inflating you,</p>
<p>inflating your rating,</p>
<p>and maybe that gets you into the game much more intensely.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I wonder how many backdoor feed-in meetings</p>
<p>there are with cigars.</p>
<p>So that was the factors determined by,</p>
<p>who does the ELO rating?</p>
<p>Who changes this stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably those Lee Chess anarchists.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I think they want to stay away from that stuff.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a guy named Hans Niemann.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And he beat Magnus Carlsen recently.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Has it been already?</p>
<p>What is, was it August?</p>
<p>September 4th.</p>
<p>Oh, it was September?</p>
<p>So he beat him twice, right, recently.</p>
<p>Once is the allegations by the internet</p>
<p>that Hans Niemann cheated,</p>
<p>and then the second time Magnus played a few moves</p>
<p>and forfeited and resigned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually, so there&rsquo;s three.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, can you?</p>
<p>No, no, no, yeah.</p>
<p>Can we go through the stuff?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>So they play a live eSports event in Miami,</p>
<p>Miami Beach.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Eden Rock.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I actually interviewed Magnus, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where that was?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It was a weird circumstance.</p>
<p>I found myself in Miami, unrelated to chess event.</p>
<p>And yeah, it was a very dramatic event for me</p>
<p>for various reasons.</p>
<p>One of which the camera stopped working halfway</p>
<p>through the conversation.</p>
<p>I saw that, yeah.</p>
<p>I saw that.</p>
<p>Also, side note, I really respect how you write comments,</p>
<p>pin them at the top.</p>
<p>You add timestamps.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like very true professional.</p>
<p>I am the complete opposite on YouTube</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m off the camera.</p>
<p>So I dig in the mud.</p>
<p>What does that mean, dig in the mud?</p>
<p>From when I started on YouTube in 2020,</p>
<p>in June, like May, June, 2020, I had no subscribers.</p>
<p>So I got to a million in a year.</p>
<p>I had a lot of people analyzing my every move,</p>
<p>all of my small flaws.</p>
<p>And I love getting hate comments.</p>
<p>Yeah, you pin, is it the comment of shame?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it has been named over the years by folks.</p>
<p>I never called it that, but yeah, it&rsquo;s pin of shame.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been tough because now people pretend</p>
<p>to write hate comments just to get attention.</p>
<p>So like anything, the public ruined the good thing.</p>
<p>But it started that way.</p>
<p>It started with people just shredding me to bits,</p>
<p>calling me spin-offs of this and that.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m a human more than I am a creator</p>
<p>and influencer and attention seeker.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just a person.</p>
<p>So to me, even at the size of 1.6 million subscribers now,</p>
<p>September, 2022, I don&rsquo;t understand that I&rsquo;ve gotten big</p>
<p>and that I shouldn&rsquo;t do this stuff</p>
<p>and that I should be beyond it,</p>
<p>or I shouldn&rsquo;t be checking my social media as much as I do</p>
<p>and interacting one-on-one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still very much a human being.</p>
<p>And my guilty pleasure, my way of killing time,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not laying on the couch</p>
<p>and playing some Chaz Blitz games off stream</p>
<p>is I just interact with people who say nice things</p>
<p>and who say horrible things.</p>
<p>And I really like to get into the head of the people</p>
<p>who say the terrible things.</p>
<p>And sometimes you can, sometimes they are truly trolls,</p>
<p>but sometimes people just, they just really hate you.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a successful interaction</p>
<p>with the person that&rsquo;s trolling you?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like at the end of that hero journey</p>
<p>that you were partaking in,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the top of the mountain look like?</p>
<p>Is the troll conquered and broken mentally?</p>
<p>Not, no, not mentally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna defeat.</p>
<p>I honestly, sometimes somebody writes a very long comment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just, I&rsquo;ll respond with a question mark.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, so you see each other as like a brother and sister.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna travel together on this journey</p>
<p>of deep meaning, like introspection of what does this mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve had people write, I can&rsquo;t quote now,</p>
<p>but something about my persona, my behavior,</p>
<p>this and that, and I just like respond to them.</p>
<p>And I say, hey, it sounds crazy</p>
<p>that a large creator might do something like this,</p>
<p>but this kind of goes back to,</p>
<p>you speak to folks on a very respectful way.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake, you completely own up to it.</p>
<p>So I have this, sometimes these one-on-one interactions</p>
<p>where I say, I think you&rsquo;re reading too much into this.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re kind of, you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>maybe some of my humor or sarcasm as such.</p>
<p>So you form this opinion that I&rsquo;m this kind of a person,</p>
<p>this and that, and now you&rsquo;re sort of,</p>
<p>anything I do, you&rsquo;re trying to attach to that reasoning,</p>
<p>and here you are writing this lengthy essay</p>
<p>of why nobody should watch my content.</p>
<p>And sometimes people go, you know what?</p>
<p>I think you have a point.</p>
<p>Maybe I should relax a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would love to sort of interview</p>
<p>and understand the lives of the folks</p>
<p>that post that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re human beings.</p>
<p>They have interesting journeys also.</p>
<p>I think they often don&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>I think they don&rsquo;t realize their comment will be read</p>
<p>by anybody, especially you.</p>
<p>They think like, and they also don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a human being, I feel like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s so interesting to watch it.</p>
<p>Like some guy, because I posted on Twitter</p>
<p>for like a minute that I&rsquo;m talking to you</p>
<p>and asking for questions.</p>
<p>I deleted that tweet because 95% of the people</p>
<p>were talk about cheating, talk about the cheating.</p>
<p>All right, I got it, thank you.</p>
<p>This is not gonna be helpful at all.</p>
<p>So I was like, all right.</p>
<p>But in that time, like there&rsquo;s one comment,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s hilarious to me that you found that one comment.</p>
<p>The one comment says like, this seems like a waste of time</p>
<p>or something, like why talk-</p>
<p>Lame guest.</p>
<p>Lame guest.</p>
<p>Lame guest.</p>
<p>Lame guest.</p>
<p>And then used, like responded,</p>
<p>something like with a question mark.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I wrote, why am I a lame guest?</p>
<p>Why am I-</p>
<p>I just made a sad face.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was like, why am I a lame guest?</p>
<p>And he responded.</p>
<p>He responded even after you deleted the tweet.</p>
<p>Yeah, what did he say?</p>
<p>He said, he doesn&rsquo;t know what value I would bring</p>
<p>because I just make videos about chess games.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had some absolutely brilliant people on.</p>
<p>But I also looked at this gentleman&rsquo;s profile</p>
<p>and he was one of the folks that put things</p>
<p>about his family and God and his politics</p>
<p>in his Twitter bio.</p>
<p>And I started thinking maybe I said something in some video</p>
<p>and I made a joke about religion or something,</p>
<p>just some offhand five second thing somewhere</p>
<p>that someone turns me into just an absolute outcast</p>
<p>in their household.</p>
<p>They can no longer watch me.</p>
<p>And that has happened.</p>
<p>That has happened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll record a 30 minute video</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll make a joke about something and some phrasing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost the viewer forever and they will let me know.</p>
<p>They will write me an email</p>
<p>and I just don&rsquo;t think people should be that serious.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some of that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen people say that sometimes about me,</p>
<p>but I see it more with others.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, I used to be like Joe Rogan gets this.</p>
<p>I used to be a huge fan of Joe Rogan until he said this.</p>
<p>First, I do wonder if you were ever really a big fan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one question mark I have.</p>
<p>But the other is like,</p>
<p>I think we should be more lenient with each other</p>
<p>in terms of how much stupid shit we say.</p>
<p>And if you actually,</p>
<p>I wish people were able to sort of introspect</p>
<p>on their own, on the stupid shit they say themselves,</p>
<p>like to have a little bit of empathy.</p>
<p>I wish there was a way to read all the emails</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever written and just to see,</p>
<p>or maybe do a search engine for all the stupid shit</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve said in emails in the past and summarize it</p>
<p>and to reveal it to yourself that you have bad days,</p>
<p>you have good days, you have emotional days,</p>
<p>you have stoic days, you have,</p>
<p>sometimes you have like,</p>
<p>you take very different political views</p>
<p>than you do on other days.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s all over the place.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a creator,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re putting stuff out all the time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have those.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re still a full,</p>
<p>like complex bag of emotions and thoughts and ideas</p>
<p>and contradictions and all of that.</p>
<p>Like you shouldn&rsquo;t judge a person by a single statement.</p>
<p>And even when you do,</p>
<p>you should try to infer the best possible interpretation</p>
<p>of that statement.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s just a healthier way</p>
<p>to interact with the world and with other humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I wonder what&rsquo;s the best possible</p>
<p>interpretation of the thing they just tweeted or they said.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that the person saying those words</p>
<p>is actually a really good human being.</p>
<p>And what did they mean when they said</p>
<p>that thing about anal beads?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It was so good for so long.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Like, you know, they didn&rsquo;t mean to be offensive</p>
<p>to the sexuality of a certain group.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just talking about,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking shit about anal beads.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not, like sometimes it&rsquo;s humor.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s actually genuinely embodying,</p>
<p>like a political viewpoint.</p>
<p>And like walking with it,</p>
<p>thinking through it for a few days.</p>
<p>Like taking it seriously.</p>
<p>Empathizing not just for a brief moment,</p>
<p>but for a time.</p>
<p>Like walking with an idea.</p>
<p>And allowing yourself to express it.</p>
<p>Like playing devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>I do that all the time.</p>
<p>With yourself?</p>
<p>Or?</p>
<p>With myself, yeah.</p>
<p>In conversation I do too.</p>
<p>And I find I have to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>Like you have to be very explicit.</p>
<p>But with myself, I&rsquo;ll just do it.</p>
<p>In my head.</p>
<p>Like I have different voices.</p>
<p>Like, you know, obviously it just in,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting so much information,</p>
<p>so many thoughts in all the complexities</p>
<p>of the war in Ukraine, for example.</p>
<p>And all the different voices within Ukraine.</p>
<p>I just interviewed hundreds of people.</p>
<p>And they have very different perspectives</p>
<p>in nuanced ways about the war.</p>
<p>Some are full of hate.</p>
<p>Some are full of love.</p>
<p>Like hate for the other.</p>
<p>Love for their own country.</p>
<p>Love for family and tradition.</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful mix.</p>
<p>And I have to walk,</p>
<p>I have to like carry those ideas in my head</p>
<p>and empathize with them deeply.</p>
<p>And then I have to listen to people that live elsewhere.</p>
<p>That live in India.</p>
<p>They have a very different perspective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people in India</p>
<p>that have a very different perspective</p>
<p>than the people in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And some of that will bleed out</p>
<p>into the thoughts I express publicly.</p>
<p>And like when people judge you harshly for it,</p>
<p>first of all, me as a human being</p>
<p>is psychologically difficult.</p>
<p>But also, it makes me less willing to be fragile.</p>
<p>I still try to be strong enough to be fragile</p>
<p>in front of the camera.</p>
<p>Just say, like say things that are on my mind</p>
<p>even if I know it&rsquo;s going to create people</p>
<p>that are going to be like ruthlessly negative towards me.</p>
<p>So, I try to wear my heart on my sleeve</p>
<p>and still try to be fragile.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s harder.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna pay a psychological cost.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m, you know, in some sense,</p>
<p>I try to be tough, but like I can be a softy</p>
<p>in that in like certain like attacks can get to me.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m surprised that they don&rsquo;t get,</p>
<p>I mean, does some negativity get to you?</p>
<p>Or is this the way you deal with it by responding?</p>
<p>Like that guy is saying,</p>
<p>like what value does talking to Levy add to the world?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, but that was, I mean, that was so good.</p>
<p>I was looking at, I was thinking at various moments.</p>
<p>You went to jump in and I was kind of letting you speak.</p>
<p>One of the things I wanted to mention</p>
<p>was it&rsquo;s significantly simpler to talk about chess</p>
<p>than it is to talk about some of the things you talk about.</p>
<p>And you have a big responsibility</p>
<p>because you have to absorb information like a sponge.</p>
<p>But you also then need to present it in a way</p>
<p>where you potentially have an opinion</p>
<p>while trying to be fair to everybody.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking about things</p>
<p>that will literally never please everybody.</p>
<p>Just literally.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re gonna talk about some issues</p>
<p>that are going to get out there into the,</p>
<p>people are gonna watch it,</p>
<p>the eyes, right, the ears of millions of people,</p>
<p>and not everybody is going to be satisfied.</p>
<p>And these are issues where people are going</p>
<p>to be much more likely to speak up in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>Tremendous support or tremendous hatred,</p>
<p>vitriol, and God knows what else.</p>
<p>Yeah, you, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons I&rsquo;m blown away</p>
<p>to even be sitting here, frankly,</p>
<p>because up until a few months ago,</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t talking to, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you weren&rsquo;t talking to,</p>
<p>but you hadn&rsquo;t spoken to chess players.</p>
<p>You were speaking to people</p>
<p>who were doing much more substantial things in the world.</p>
<p>I appreciate the humility there.</p>
<p>No, but-</p>
<p>Chess, to me, is an incredible, is a beautiful game.</p>
<p>But I think the reason comments hurt is not,</p>
<p>I mean, they hurt no matter what, to me.</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>Not to me.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m in a simpler space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you have to understand.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s chess-based criticism,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t hit as hard.</p>
<p>No, if you had a podcast about,</p>
<p>anal bees, no, I&rsquo;m just,</p>
<p>if you had a podcast-</p>
<p>I am launching this.</p>
<p>If you had a podcast about-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m launching a new podcast.</p>
<p>Photography, you gotta realize,</p>
<p>like, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same way.</p>
<p>You talk about potentially existential things.</p>
<p>You talk about cyber, you know,</p>
<p>things in cybersecurity or AI</p>
<p>or people who are massive heads of companies</p>
<p>that are just inherently going</p>
<p>to be a bit more controversial.</p>
<p>So that, I can&rsquo;t imagine being in your shoes</p>
<p>because you have so many complex emotions about situations</p>
<p>where you may not necessarily agree</p>
<p>with everything that someone has said publicly,</p>
<p>but you still invite them for a conversation</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re a human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally different, Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Not the way I experience it.</p>
<p>To me, I think what hurts is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even on my,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m super self-critical,</p>
<p>usually way more than the internet can be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that, like, human beings can be cruel to each other.</p>
<p>So, like, the reason it hurts, for some reason,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s disappointment in people.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t give each other a chance.</p>
<p>So, in that sense,</p>
<p>the negativity doesn&rsquo;t have to be about Ukraine</p>
<p>or geopolitics.</p>
<p>It could be about the silliest of things.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And, like, to me, it&rsquo;s like, why be mean to each other?</p>
<p>In a context where the mean doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s out of place.</p>
<p>Because, for example, there is, like, a gaming culture</p>
<p>where they just talk shit to each other nonstop.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more acceptable there.</p>
<p>It seems to fit.</p>
<p>It seems to be funnier there.</p>
<p>And, like, when streamers talk shit to each other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to several streamers recently,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, it somehow works a little better,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re just, like, cruel to each other.</p>
<p>It makes more sense.</p>
<p>But I think when people are genuinely trying to educate</p>
<p>or to help and so on,</p>
<p>and you still get the shitty comments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It makes me sad.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make me sad.</p>
<p>I think part of that is also the way I was brought up.</p>
<p>So, I was, I skipped kindergarten,</p>
<p>so I was always the smallest kid.</p>
<p>And I-</p>
<p>You were picked on?</p>
<p>I was picked on, and then I did picking.</p>
<p>So, I had kind of both in my life.</p>
<p>I kind of know I went home from summer camp crying,</p>
<p>and I also made a kid cry once in fourth grade.</p>
<p>So, I had the balance.</p>
<p>And I-</p>
<p>Physical or mental abuse are both.</p>
<p>Verbal.</p>
<p>Verbal.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t beat anybody up.</p>
<p>I was tiny.</p>
<p>I think the kid in the younger grade was bigger than I was.</p>
<p>And you still broke him.</p>
<p>Because I was, ah, I was, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, so I had to use my-</p>
<p>Mental warfare.</p>
<p>I had to use my words.</p>
<p>I had to be, and growing up,</p>
<p>my parents split when I was super young,</p>
<p>and I played chess.</p>
<p>So, all things that make you super self-trustworthy.</p>
<p>Like, you believe your first instinct.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t listen to what other people tell you.</p>
<p>And if people give you advice,</p>
<p>say, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna think about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna go and do that.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t impressionable.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t convince me to do something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s stuck to this day.</p>
<p>My wife has had to deconstruct some of my stubbornness</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even realize was incredible stubbornness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something that you brought up with.</p>
<p>So, to me, that stuff doesn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>So, the voices of others don&rsquo;t shake you quite.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t mentally shake your,</p>
<p>like, psychological stability.</p>
<p>No, they haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think when it got,</p>
<p>probably at its worst point,</p>
<p>was in combination with being unable to perform well</p>
<p>in over-the-board play.</p>
<p>But that was also self-driven.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t performing poorly because I was getting comments.</p>
<p>But because I was performing poorly,</p>
<p>the comments got to me more.</p>
<p>The cycle was sort of in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>And that was probably the most frustrating.</p>
<p>People have said some vile things to me,</p>
<p>you know, about my whole Indonesia thing.</p>
<p>Ooh, this is good.</p>
<p>This is gonna give the anarchist in Lee Chess some humor.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, what&rsquo;s the Indonesia thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The way you said it, okay,</p>
<p>maybe we don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>Who did you kill?</p>
<p>I was gonna say I wish,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not even sure I can make a joke like that.</p>
<p>So, the Indonesia thing was I was streaming chess.</p>
<p>On chess.com, I might add.</p>
<p>And I got booted up a 10-minute game.</p>
<p>Just a random account from Indonesia.</p>
<p>That was the flag.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, on these websites, you can pick your flag.</p>
<p>It can be from wherever.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not geo-tracing.</p>
<p>You can change it.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, account from Indonesia.</p>
<p>And as always, I looked at the account</p>
<p>because it was a untitled, high-rated account.</p>
<p>And I looked through the games.</p>
<p>Win rate was suspiciously high.</p>
<p>Average accuracy was suspiciously high.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, I think this is a cheater.</p>
<p>I said it out loud.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve played cheaters on stream.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, I&rsquo;m still gonna play.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>
<p>The game was not crazy suspicious,</p>
<p>but definitely suspicious.</p>
<p>A few critical moments</p>
<p>where I just clearly thought I had a good position.</p>
<p>And then the person or the bot played some move</p>
<p>that just killed my hopes.</p>
<p>And I lost.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, I lost.</p>
<p>And I wrote to the chess.com fair play team.</p>
<p>Like behind the scenes,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even saying anything publicly on stream.</p>
<p>And the guy got banned.</p>
<p>It was a cheater.</p>
<p>So that night, right before I&rsquo;m going to sleep,</p>
<p>because Indonesia is 12 hours ahead of New York,</p>
<p>I go on my Twitter.</p>
<p>The hell is going on?</p>
<p>I see hundreds of responses to my recent tweets.</p>
<p>Levi, you gotta check Facebook, man.</p>
<p>You gotta check Facebook.</p>
<p>Like, here&rsquo;s a link.</p>
<p>So allegedly that account belonged to an older gentleman</p>
<p>and his son made a Facebook post that said,</p>
<p>my dad played a big streamer in chess, Gotham Chess,</p>
<p>and Gotham got mad.</p>
<p>He lost to my dad.</p>
<p>So his community mass reported my dad</p>
<p>and he was banned for cheating.</p>
<p>Oh, it went viral.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Did you know that in Indonesia</p>
<p>has the fourth largest population in the world?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I learned it the hard way.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of DMs every second.</p>
<p>Instagram DMs, because I had my DMs open.</p>
<p>I was never afraid of that stuff.</p>
<p>My YouTube videos went from 99% downvote to 50, 50, 50.</p>
<p>They swarmed my account.</p>
<p>So all negative.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>All, play him again.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how much swearing</p>
<p>there is on this podcast,</p>
<p>but I mean, it was just all sorts of.</p>
<p>All the fucking swearing you want.</p>
<p>Just everything, ruthless, the vicious.</p>
<p>They were gonna kill me.</p>
<p>They were going to rape my family.</p>
<p>They were going to,</p>
<p>they were contacting people I followed on Instagram.</p>
<p>They were contacting them and telling them crazy things.</p>
<p>It was, I&rsquo;m not joking.</p>
<p>It was tens of thousands of people every minute.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know what to do because the guy cheated.</p>
<p>I was in the right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>People.</p>
<p>How certain were you that he cheated?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can say 100%, but.</p>
<p>So just.com also had a suspicion.</p>
<p>They, what I.</p>
<p>Because they have like good,</p>
<p>they have like good detection algorithms.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Danny Wrench would be able to,</p>
<p>I legitimately know nothing about the behind the scenes</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s only kind of tech people.</p>
<p>But one thing I did not realize was that this account,</p>
<p>whether it was the son playing or the father playing,</p>
<p>we will not know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know who played.</p>
<p>It could have been the son.</p>
<p>It could have been the dad covering for him, whatever.</p>
<p>But at some point that account won 27 games in a row</p>
<p>at 95% accuracy.</p>
<p>I mean, even Magnus can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Even, you know, this took a month.</p>
<p>This story took one month from start to finish.</p>
<p>First, I had to work with like a media company</p>
<p>to geo-block my content in Indonesia on YouTube.</p>
<p>So Indonesians could not see my channel.</p>
<p>Oh, so you didn&rsquo;t want to like lean into it,</p>
<p>go fool Donald Trump.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s, cause you&rsquo;re in the right,</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re in the right.</p>
<p>You, as far as you know, you&rsquo;re in the right.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I hated watching all my work burn to the ground.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>Oh, you felt it was being.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m, one thing I&rsquo;m learning about myself</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m not a good crisis actor.</p>
<p>I need someone to like slap me</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t do something emotional in the moment</p>
<p>when crisis is ongoing.</p>
<p>What would be the emotional act</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not productive there?</p>
<p>Partnering with an MCN that makes you give away</p>
<p>a bunch of your revenue.</p>
<p>And then when you break with them,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t monetized for a week.</p>
<p>It was a very big decision to plug in.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re called MCNs, but.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t, what are MCNs?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we, there&rsquo;s specialized agencies</p>
<p>that work behind the scenes with YouTube</p>
<p>that if you connect your account,</p>
<p>they say they can give you certain ad benefits.</p>
<p>They can geo-block your content,</p>
<p>which you can&rsquo;t do normally.</p>
<p>They have certain perks that only YouTube allows</p>
<p>behind the scenes.</p>
<p>You pay them 10% of your monthly ad revenue,</p>
<p>but they claim to do a handful of things for you.</p>
<p>I just needed them to geo-block my content.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t care how much money</p>
<p>I was going to give away per month, but.</p>
<p>So why geo-block it?</p>
<p>You just didn&rsquo;t like the downvoting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>You wanted positivity, like you&rsquo;re being educational.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, I mean, they&rsquo;re like, you do a bit of shit talking,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more like fun and easygoing.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t want this kind of viciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, my comment section was just being completely flooded.</p>
<p>Like they were destroying my channel.</p>
<p>And to be honest, maybe all of the views</p>
<p>and the downvotes would have actually been beneficial.</p>
<p>Maybe my videos would have actually started</p>
<p>getting recommended to more people, but I&rsquo;m a person.</p>
<p>This all goes back to the same thing.</p>
<p>Oh, so this got to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, this was like, I was just watching it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, this is not fair.</p>
<p>This is, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to stop this as much as I can.</p>
<p>They still got through, they have VPN.</p>
<p>And they were like, you asshole,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think we have VPN in Indonesia?</p>
<p>It was this whole, you know, it was this whole thing.</p>
<p>This father and son got invited to every major news network.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not joking.</p>
<p>They got invited to the major podcast.</p>
<p>They like to say the Joe Rogan of Indonesia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Daddy Corbuzier is this mentalist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bald guy, very fun guy.</p>
<p>He had them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when the Indonesian Chess Federation stepped in.</p>
<p>The thing is nobody who was harassing me</p>
<p>knows anything about chess.</p>
<p>They just saw the story.</p>
<p>And long story short, they brought in a sponsor.</p>
<p>The guy played a strong,</p>
<p>one of the strongest chess players in the country</p>
<p>who also happens to be a woman, Irene Sukander.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like 2,400 international master.</p>
<p>She crushed him because his actual playing strength</p>
<p>is 1,300, 1,400, something like that.</p>
<p>He still got paid.</p>
<p>Cause there was a winning prize fund, a losing prize fund.</p>
<p>And we never heard from him again.</p>
<p>And that was the whole story.</p>
<p>So that was why I had to shut down all of my social media</p>
<p>to DMs and DM requests and even notifications.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t get notifications unless it&rsquo;s someone I follow.</p>
<p>But see stuff like that doesn&rsquo;t often get resolved</p>
<p>in this kind of clear way.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It could have been.</p>
<p>So you got lucky there that there&rsquo;s a conclusion to this.</p>
<p>Yeah, somebody got views, somebody got money.</p>
<p>I never got many apologies.</p>
<p>What did you learn from that experience about yourself,</p>
<p>about the internet?</p>
<p>I think first and foremost,</p>
<p>I learned that every moment you are live or broadcasting</p>
<p>can be completely blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>You have to be real careful.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t actively think about that unfortunately,</p>
<p>even when I&rsquo;m streaming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had other instances where things come back to bite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve even had these moments live on stream.</p>
<p>I feel like I said something too sarcastically to somebody</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how their day is going.</p>
<p>It might ruin their whole day.</p>
<p>You know, God knows what,</p>
<p>you have these moments of regret</p>
<p>where you want your personality to shine through</p>
<p>and you want to entertain.</p>
<p>At least you&rsquo;re thinking at what cost.</p>
<p>If I make a joke to a viewer</p>
<p>that suddenly the whole chat is laughing at them,</p>
<p>what if that puts them in a deep, dark place?</p>
<p>And again, it all comes back to this one-on-one thing for me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a human.</p>
<p>I would hate to put another person into that situation.</p>
<p>If I would much rather get a drink with somebody</p>
<p>than, but it&rsquo;s all kind of part of this act</p>
<p>and you want to make jokes.</p>
<p>And I also learned I&rsquo;m a horrible crisis actor.</p>
<p>So I have no patience, but I think that&rsquo;s normal in 2022.</p>
<p>Everything is immediate.</p>
<p>We can barely sit, think, let time go by.</p>
<p>It makes me sad because I think</p>
<p>that kind of stuff can destroy good people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes you sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, one of the things we discussed</p>
<p>just here before recording,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m also, I&rsquo;ve talked about this on stream.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very open with this type of stuff is over the,</p>
<p>I think for me, a lot of that comes down</p>
<p>to just a lack of control of the narrative.</p>
<p>That phrase is kind of messy.</p>
<p>It can be used for political stuff,</p>
<p>but I hate when I say things</p>
<p>and they get completely misconstrued</p>
<p>or they are completely misinterpreted.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t imagine being in your shoes</p>
<p>because again, I do chess.</p>
<p>You cannot really, you can clip me saying something</p>
<p>about a chess game out of context and it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s not an attack on me</p>
<p>or something that I said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an attack on, kind of more similarly</p>
<p>to what you were describing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t say stuff like that,</p>
<p>like ridiculous, you don&rsquo;t say ridiculous shit</p>
<p>about yourself like that?</p>
<p>Oh, I do, I do, I do.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t feel like that could be made.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the same guy that said X?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe I either haven&rsquo;t said enough</p>
<p>of those things or there&rsquo;s no moments in,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have three, four hour open conversations</p>
<p>with other humans.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure if I did,</p>
<p>there would be more of that stuff out there.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s probably what it is,</p>
<p>is just a lack of, it&rsquo;s a lack of being able</p>
<p>to kind of control what is actually reality.</p>
<p>And that is very frustrating.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, there is a sense that there&rsquo;s not enough motivation</p>
<p>for people to attack you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ultimately adding a lot of positive stuff</p>
<p>to the world.</p>
<p>And when you get into more political topics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people there who are hurting,</p>
<p>who have a lot of anger in their hearts,</p>
<p>and they want to direct it towards you.</p>
<p>So then they need ammunition.</p>
<p>And ammunition comes in the way of like clips from the past.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure that you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure you already have clips like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s not people that really have anger</p>
<p>to direct towards you.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you&rsquo;re adding a lot of good stuff to the world.</p>
<p>And so, yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, man, the viciousness of human beings</p>
<p>under the veil of anonymity at scale</p>
<p>can be really painful.</p>
<p>So that, I guess that&rsquo;s the curse,</p>
<p>the challenge of being a creator</p>
<p>on YouTube and so on, on Twitch.</p>
<p>When you talked about retiring,</p>
<p>I think you tweeted about retiring from chess.</p>
<p>I made a video, yeah, I tweeted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my value to the world.</p>
<p>The tweet or the video?</p>
<p>The both.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m retiring from all competitive chess events.</p>
<p>My preparation is outmatched.</p>
<p>My calculation skills are too flawed.</p>
<p>And most importantly, my anxiety is beyond repair.</p>
<p>I physically and emotionally cannot do it anymore.</p>
<p>What was the hardest thing?</p>
<p>What was the hardest thing about competing?</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s separated into phases of my life.</p>
<p>So after being a creator and coming back</p>
<p>and playing over the board</p>
<p>and making recaps of all my games,</p>
<p>I think the constant feeling that I had at the board</p>
<p>was a kid who hadn&rsquo;t studied enough for a test,</p>
<p>which is a very unique type of anxiety.</p>
<p>And during the game, it was just self-hatred.</p>
<p>Good moves did not feel as good</p>
<p>as how bad bad moves felt and bad moments.</p>
<p>And underneath that, you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>there was a sense that I did not prepare well enough.</p>
<p>Unquestionably.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m an international master,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s international masters now who are 11.</p>
<p>I got the title when I was 22, which is late.</p>
<p>I might not sound like it&rsquo;s late, but it&rsquo;s really late.</p>
<p>And I quit chess multiple times when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t, one of my parents was like,</p>
<p>sit down, this is the only thing that you&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>Focus on it.</p>
<p>Maybe I would have been a grandmaster,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s life, right?</p>
<p>And I would come back to chess at various points in my life</p>
<p>when I felt more mature, I felt more ready,</p>
<p>and I felt more motivated.</p>
<p>It was all me.</p>
<p>I had one coach when I was maybe about 10,</p>
<p>I never listened to the guy, great guy.</p>
<p>He emailed me even recently just wanting to catch up,</p>
<p>which I thought was adorable,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t even know if he knows</p>
<p>that YouTube chess exists.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in his 70s, he&rsquo;s just like a nice older guy.</p>
<p>And he would come to my house, we would have dinner,</p>
<p>and my grandma would make us food.</p>
<p>And he would tell her that I&rsquo;m brilliant,</p>
<p>but I never work, and I have so much potential.</p>
<p>If only I ever worked at all, one minute on anything.</p>
<p>I just played speed games online and I-</p>
<p>Did he speak the truth there?</p>
<p>Like, could you have worked more?</p>
<p>I could have worked more, for sure, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>When you listen to Magnus who doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>he seems like he doesn&rsquo;t work either.</p>
<p>He works.</p>
<p>He might work in different ways,</p>
<p>but I think for him it&rsquo;s also obsession, again, love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>He might read a book, he doesn&rsquo;t consider it work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s getting information in and he&rsquo;s learning something.</p>
<p>It might just be easier for him to learn</p>
<p>than for me, for example, or for anybody.</p>
<p>Just everybody learns and absorbs things differently.</p>
<p>So I would come back to chess,</p>
<p>and the best run of my life that I had was in 2016,</p>
<p>where I basically, while teaching a chess program,</p>
<p>scholastic chess program, I told all the parents,</p>
<p>hey, so for these four months,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna stop doing private lessons,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna go travel and play tournaments</p>
<p>because I wanna become an international master finally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 20 years old.</p>
<p>This is in 2016.</p>
<p>Like, can you help me raise some money?</p>
<p>These are all managing directors.</p>
<p>These are lawyers.</p>
<p>These are seven-figure, eight-figure households,</p>
<p>and they contributed, and I kept a blog,</p>
<p>and then I worked just six hours, seven hours every day,</p>
<p>like studying all the opening trends,</p>
<p>all of the new ideas, reading the books,</p>
<p>analyzing my own games, playing my own speed games</p>
<p>and analyzing them, training every day.</p>
<p>And that year, I went from 2240 over the board to 2404,</p>
<p>with two of the three norms, as they call them,</p>
<p>which are basically tournament performances.</p>
<p>Like, you perform at a certain level.</p>
<p>Not too complicated.</p>
<p>So I got almost everything I needed to be an IM.</p>
<p>But I just slipped up at the very end,</p>
<p>and 2017, I didn&rsquo;t play chess, but in 2018,</p>
<p>I came back once again with a vengeance.</p>
<p>I started playing in the summer once again,</p>
<p>and I went up, up, up to my peak.</p>
<p>But then, something interesting happened.</p>
<p>My life mission was accomplished.</p>
<p>I never wanted or thought I could be a grandmaster.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wanted to be an international master.</p>
<p>And the adrenaline dump of hitting the IM title,</p>
<p>I just stopped working completely.</p>
<p>I just completely stopped working.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t, and the second I started falling,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>And I spent the rest of the summer just tanking,</p>
<p>and I said, oh, fuck this.</p>
<p>I made my IM, I&rsquo;m gonna fuck off someplace and whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be IM, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But when I play games online,</p>
<p>I mean, I destroy grandmasters all the time.</p>
<p>Like, dynamically, dynamics in chess</p>
<p>are just complex positions with all sorts of calculation,</p>
<p>attacking, defending, like very forcing lines.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s my best strength.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m easily grandmaster level.</p>
<p>So you have the capacity to be a grandmaster?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>If the work was put in.</p>
<p>If the work was put in,</p>
<p>and I was not doing my current career,</p>
<p>if I just trained full-time, I think I could do it.</p>
<p>Do you have a desire to be a grandmaster?</p>
<p>Did you have a desire?</p>
<p>You said, I didn&rsquo;t really want,</p>
<p>like, the main goal was international master.</p>
<p>Which, by the way, is really interesting.</p>
<p>Just, I&rsquo;ve talked to Olympic athletes,</p>
<p>the crash after the gold medal is fascinating.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get gold, but for me, that was my goal.</p>
<p>That was your goal.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The goal, it takes a very, very special person</p>
<p>to not be destroyed by the gold and continue the dominance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to continue growing, to continue.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to, that&rsquo;s why they talk about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to be a champion and defend your championships.</p>
<p>Or whatever the goal is, to achieve the goal</p>
<p>and stick to, like, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it broke me.</p>
<p>It broke you.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So, you have the capacity to be a grandmaster.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought, by the way,</p>
<p>is this still possible for you,</p>
<p>or are you fully dedicated now to the love of creating</p>
<p>and analyzing this game?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to do what I do right now forever.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re gonna die one day.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Just a heads up.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>I once cried when I realized that.</p>
<p>It was at a funeral.</p>
<p>It was very sad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another entirely separate rabbit hole to go down.</p>
<p>Which is when?</p>
<p>When did this happen?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was rough.</p>
<p>So, you really were able to like,</p>
<p>like that realization really hit you,</p>
<p>like, fuck, this ends.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m the kind of person who,</p>
<p>I have my active thoughts in my brain</p>
<p>of things I have to get done.</p>
<p>And the more of those, the better,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll, my brain will walk me off a cliff,</p>
<p>not the physical body,</p>
<p>the brain itself will walk off a cliff,</p>
<p>spinning in circles.</p>
<p>So, I try to keep myself as active as possible</p>
<p>on tasks I have to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, and I&rsquo;m busy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, I&rsquo;m at the scale I am,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t really rest a whole lot.</p>
<p>But yes, that was,</p>
<p>I have these moments in my life</p>
<p>where I have realizations of past fuck ups</p>
<p>or things I have, like I really have to do</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been like really doing poorly,</p>
<p>or things like this.</p>
<p>Massive existential things that just hit me</p>
<p>like a bus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several things tricky about it.</p>
<p>So, because I meditate on death a lot.</p>
<p>Like, in this conversation,</p>
<p>I imagine this is the last thing both you and I do.</p>
<p>Just, and we&rsquo;re gonna die after this.</p>
<p>So, you meditate on that.</p>
<p>But then you also have to,</p>
<p>I think what hits people really hard</p>
<p>is the realization that life moves on.</p>
<p>Not only does it just end for you,</p>
<p>but most people will be like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll, in your case, they&rsquo;ll tweet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, he&rsquo;s so great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be so much outpouring.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be outpouring of love and so on for a day,</p>
<p>and then it moves on.</p>
<p>And the new trees grow,</p>
<p>new bridges are built,</p>
<p>and then eventually human civilization ends,</p>
<p>or moves over to Mars and so on,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be forgotten completely.</p>
<p>But that, for most people, will come right away.</p>
<p>You get a cancer diagnosis or something like that,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, doesn&rsquo;t anyone else know</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to die?</p>
<p>Does anyone else care?</p>
<p>Like, nobody gives a shit.</p>
<p>I mean, they do.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s love there,</p>
<p>but not in a dramatic way</p>
<p>that you would somehow deep inside hope for,</p>
<p>that the world would stop</p>
<p>because your life is facing this catastrophic event.</p>
<p>But I think, ultimately,</p>
<p>what you could channel that realization</p>
<p>into appreciation of the current moment,</p>
<p>which is the people you love,</p>
<p>and sharing love with them as intensely as possible,</p>
<p>experiencing every moment as intensely as possible,</p>
<p>because eventually, there&rsquo;ll be a last moment,</p>
<p>and after that, there&rsquo;ll be no more moments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of what I do.</p>
<p>Yeah, I try to channel all of that into,</p>
<p>sorry, I don&rsquo;t use these fancy microphones in my own.</p>
<p>You look uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your fault.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your fault, Levy.</p>
<p>With this microphone?</p>
<p>No, with this line of conversation.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing therapist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t know if I have a lot to say.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I just listen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, sometimes, I&rsquo;m intimidated.</p>
<p>You say a lot of good things,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, shit, what am I gonna say,</p>
<p>like, at the end of it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>On this subject especially, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of what I do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing, what do you think happens after we die?</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a rhetorical question.</p>
<p>What were we talking about?</p>
<p>Grandmaster.</p>
<p>Grandmaster.</p>
<p>So, how hard is it to reach?</p>
<p>What are the requirements for grandmaster, by the way?</p>
<p>Because, yeah, and what are the requirements</p>
<p>for international master?</p>
<p>You mentioned a few requirements and so on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, the first one is you have to know</p>
<p>how to use a Shure mic and an arm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slowly learning.</p>
<p>You were impressed by the Shure microphone, by the way.</p>
<p>For people listening, we&rsquo;re using this Shure SM7B</p>
<p>that a lot of podcasters use.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, and Michael Jackson on Thriller,</p>
<p>which Grimes told me.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, I think it looked a little different,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the same underneath it.</p>
<p>A few musicians used it in studio.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it became popular</p>
<p>as a podcasting microphone,</p>
<p>because I think most broadcasters use condenser mics</p>
<p>that look really fancy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This looks a little.</p>
<p>No, this one&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It sounds really, really good,</p>
<p>and I told you before that I wanted to use it,</p>
<p>but it requires an external dashboard of some sort,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m way too lazy to learn how to do it.</p>
<p>And my microphone doesn&rsquo;t sound that bad</p>
<p>for YouTube and for Twitch, but this is a long-term.</p>
<p>I still have to figure out how to stream stuff.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t figured that out.</p>
<p>You want to go down into the world of Twitch?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Just in case.</p>
<p>No, for, no, not Twitch.</p>
<p>Do you know what we have over there?</p>
<p>So, first of all, yes, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I feel like the Hobbit going into like a mortar.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, Twitch is a very intense world,</p>
<p>but there is useful cases</p>
<p>when you should have your microphone work</p>
<p>with like the different,</p>
<p>the processing chain work in real time.</p>
<p>So you can do like interviews,</p>
<p>and also I play video,</p>
<p>I try to play a video game once a month.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve done that like three times already.</p>
<p>So stream that kind of stuff for like an hour,</p>
<p>like play Skyrim.</p>
<p>I like, I love playing Skyrim.</p>
<p>I actually love the idea.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done that yet,</p>
<p>but apparently in Skyrim you can turn off the monsters</p>
<p>and you can just walk around.</p>
<p>So I love the idea of just walking around Skyrim</p>
<p>for a couple hours.</p>
<p>And just like, cause it&rsquo;s beautiful nature.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Have you, do you know anything about those?</p>
<p>I know very, I know, I know a little about Skyrim,</p>
<p>but so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of like Chet, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just beautiful worlds.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s games that are able to create this sense of,</p>
<p>you know, the way you feel when you go hiking,</p>
<p>a sense of nature.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re ultra realistic,</p>
<p>but they capture some majestic aspect of nature.</p>
<p>I think some of it is also music, something peaceful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like old timey, medieval type of music.</p>
<p>And just the trees, like the wind, like,</p>
<p>and you could, and then there&rsquo;s in the distance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the mountains.</p>
<p>And you can like, you have a sense of history</p>
<p>that the nature gives you.</p>
<p>You have a sense of space, like this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like this tiny little creature</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this big world all around you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many, that&rsquo;s like an art</p>
<p>for a video game to create that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the monsters in front of you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about this world and this feeling of a world.</p>
<p>So I can just walk around and enjoy it.</p>
<p>I get asked this question a lot.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I stream more video games?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know that such video games,</p>
<p>first of all, existed.</p>
<p>I thought it was mostly just various sci-fi-ish characters</p>
<p>and shooting and objective.</p>
<p>Oh, like Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played Overwatch on stream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only video game I actually played a lot</p>
<p>and got decent at.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t play it on stream anymore</p>
<p>because my teammates would use racial slurs</p>
<p>in the voice chat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that is.</p>
<p>I will, one of the,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve been thinking of talking to a few streamers</p>
<p>and they do, they&rsquo;re a little bit,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know as far as,</p>
<p>that community broadly does use racial slurs</p>
<p>and seem to make them okay.</p>
<p>But for the ones I would talk to are a little bit,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just harsh in general in the intensity of language.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t want to be the guy who says like,</p>
<p>kids these days with their mean language on the internet.</p>
<p>Like you want to kind of adapt to the different communities.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lines that you can cross, right?</p>
<p>Like if you make everything into a joke,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what they kind of do.</p>
<p>Everything ends in LOL, everything is funny.</p>
<p>And that becomes, once again, a lubricant.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s like a slippery slope that takes you to a place</p>
<p>where you actually make pretty mean ideas,</p>
<p>even evil ideas, okay, because it started as a joke.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, you start getting into the territory of,</p>
<p>I mean, because I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot on Hitler</p>
<p>and Stalin and so on,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see those kinds of topic come up</p>
<p>in that community.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oof,</p>
<p>they have a very different perspective on that stuff.</p>
<p>To them, it&rsquo;s just a fun joke, fun time.</p>
<p>And I see that the conscious of that would call a duty</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re shooting.</p>
<p>And I love shooting and killing things in video games,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a slippery slope there too,</p>
<p>because then just having visited the front in Ukraine,</p>
<p>you get to see the real killing of people.</p>
<p>And you see how one can lead to another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s non-obvious,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something that happens in video games</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, well, this is not reality.</p>
<p>The same kind of things happens in war.</p>
<p>Well, the people on the other side aren&rsquo;t really human.</p>
<p>It does become a kind of video game.</p>
<p>And that same mechanism,</p>
<p>I feel like I want to be cautious about our brain</p>
<p>going down that road.</p>
<p>So yeah, I do worry about that community,</p>
<p>but there are video games</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have such communities around them.</p>
<p>I think Skyrim,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Skyrim is an online component.</p>
<p>Minecraft, I think is relatively civil</p>
<p>from what I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Good community.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a lot of, right now it&rsquo;s booming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of young creators</p>
<p>who are all seemingly quite close.</p>
<p>And I think the community then extends to social media.</p>
<p>Some of them are intense, but who isn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>And I think they foster a more or less</p>
<p>kind of good group of folks.</p>
<p>But no, I completely agree.</p>
<p>I think a lot of that stuff,</p>
<p>and combined with the anonymity stuff</p>
<p>that we mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>totally dehumanizes the way people interact with each other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Combine that with two years</p>
<p>of some people barely going outside.</p>
<p>Yeah, with COVID, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good mix.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good mix at all.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;d like to think that folks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like in their teenage years,</p>
<p>kind of go through those and they mature out of it and stuff.</p>
<p>So they start to realize the weight of their words.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re all trying to figure that out,</p>
<p>how the internet has changed youth.</p>
<p>Like easy access to porn,</p>
<p>easy access to some dark communities</p>
<p>where dark ideas breed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But then again, I trust in the goodness</p>
<p>and the intelligence of people at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And I think kids will,</p>
<p>now I sound like an old man,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s good for kids to play with different ideas</p>
<p>and then they grow out of it, hopefully.</p>
<p>But then you have to have parents and good school</p>
<p>and good friends that kind of calm out their bullshit.</p>
<p>You need that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re stuck inside under anonymity,</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t have some of those signals.</p>
<p>Kids these days with their internet.</p>
<p>I had to go through this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of what I mentioned.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t have two divorced,</p>
<p>my parents were divorced.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have two households.</p>
<p>I had three.</p>
<p>So I had-</p>
<p>So I went to school most of my childhood</p>
<p>in a town where my grandmother lived.</p>
<p>And she was kind of like the Switzerland.</p>
<p>So I would be with her</p>
<p>and my mom would come with me there half the week.</p>
<p>Dad would take me to his place</p>
<p>for the other half of the school week.</p>
<p>And my parents would split weekends.</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s weekends were in New York</p>
<p>where my stepdad was and that family.</p>
<p>So three houses.</p>
<p>So grandma, your dad&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Mom and dad.</p>
<p>And then mom.</p>
<p>So step siblings there and there.</p>
<p>New people there and there.</p>
<p>Extended family there and there.</p>
<p>And also at grandma&rsquo;s where I would come</p>
<p>anytime I had a conflict.</p>
<p>And when I was 12 and 13</p>
<p>and being just a total lunatic,</p>
<p>emotional manipulator of all folks in my family.</p>
<p>I was just teenager rebelling</p>
<p>and also having to deal with three different households.</p>
<p>And I mean, I carried a backpack,</p>
<p>the same backpack literally that I,</p>
<p>not the physical one,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s inside of it that I carried.</p>
<p>Like when I came here to record the episode</p>
<p>and have my stuff in the hotel,</p>
<p>a backpack with a laptop,</p>
<p>a bunch of clothes,</p>
<p>a bunch of other things that I need throughout the week.</p>
<p>Deodorant, things like that.</p>
<p>I mean, of course you start getting that stuff</p>
<p>in all the houses,</p>
<p>but that was the way I lived</p>
<p>for some of the most important developmental years</p>
<p>of my life.</p>
<p>And who knows if I had too much of what we&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>one sprinkle of this too much,</p>
<p>one sprinkle of this too much,</p>
<p>if I had someone influence me in a negative way.</p>
<p>Luckily, I managed to steer clear of a lot of it.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, how did you not get into trouble with the internet?</p>
<p>Meaning like, how did you,</p>
<p>what was your experience with the internet?</p>
<p>So I was having to move a lot,</p>
<p>having to have multiple households,</p>
<p>just psychologically difficult upbringing.</p>
<p>I, yeah, it was extremely tough.</p>
<p>I, it&rsquo;s hard to speak about it now</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m in a completely different mental state.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember some of like those moments,</p>
<p>but-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a different person.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly how it feels.</p>
<p>But I remember I had a big video game addiction,</p>
<p>just like most teenagers.</p>
<p>I want to say teenagers,</p>
<p>but probably teenage boys,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how addicted teenage girls are to video games.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t get on that.</p>
<p>I definitely look back on things that I did</p>
<p>in certain instances, like,</p>
<p>well, I was a teenager, that was stupid.</p>
<p>Oh, I scammed somebody in some video game.</p>
<p>Oh, that was, you know, that was, oh, that&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Like, and just, I was just an idiot teenager.</p>
<p>Like, I didn&rsquo;t do anything unforgivable, luckily.</p>
<p>And for the most part, just kind of went about my life.</p>
<p>And I somehow got older</p>
<p>and started getting more independent</p>
<p>and stopped playing video games.</p>
<p>And to be honest with you,</p>
<p>I would love to sit here and say</p>
<p>I have some sort of logical explanation</p>
<p>of why I am the person I am today.</p>
<p>But I think you need elements of the right upbringing</p>
<p>and support system, as you said,</p>
<p>and you also need luck.</p>
<p>You just, I&rsquo;ve been in some situations as a teenager</p>
<p>where I almost got killed by some gang members.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very exaggerated story,</p>
<p>but I was in a park in New York City</p>
<p>and I got into it with a kid</p>
<p>whose brother was in a notorious gang of that neighborhood.</p>
<p>And he told me his brother was gonna come and kill me,</p>
<p>basically, over a stolen basketball.</p>
<p>And I was gonna fight this kid,</p>
<p>because I was 14, you know, he stole my basketball.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m gonna fight this kid.</p>
<p>This kid was like 12, he had a pierced tongue.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, this wasn&rsquo;t a joke.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This kid was from a totally different way of life.</p>
<p>And his brother did show up,</p>
<p>but his brother was like, I&rsquo;m not gonna lose this kid.</p>
<p>Like, I was a little teenager.</p>
<p>Now 14-year-olds are six feet tall.</p>
<p>Maybe something would&rsquo;ve happened to me.</p>
<p>But I was a little kid.</p>
<p>And his brother was like, bro.</p>
<p>But looking back at that is crazy,</p>
<p>because I definitely had some of these moments</p>
<p>in New York City more than anywhere else,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a big place.</p>
<p>But luck, you need some luck.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of funny</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s certain moments in life</p>
<p>on which the entire trajectory of your life can turn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re all, like, in that case, nothing happened.</p>
<p>But, you know, I most intensely feel this</p>
<p>when I get almost run over by a car kind of thing.</p>
<p>How many times have you almost get run over?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe it happened, like, twice in my life.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>That kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like when somebody runs a red light.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That happened to me here in Austin.</p>
<p>You realize, oh shit, that was,</p>
<p>like, your life flashes before your eyes.</p>
<p>And those moments can turn.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s more meeting certain people</p>
<p>where you meet them for the positive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, wow, this moment of inspiration,</p>
<p>like, wow, this is possible.</p>
<p>Wow, this kind of person can exist.</p>
<p>Maybe I can be that kind of person too.</p>
<p>So yeah, those things can change the direction.</p>
<p>But maybe not.</p>
<p>Maybe they just reveal something that was already there</p>
<p>and the momentum is always carrying you forward</p>
<p>into a thing that you are always gonna end up in.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder about that.</p>
<p>Speaking of teens doing stupid things,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s return to the Magnus Hans saga.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How did it start?</p>
<p>Who is Hans Nieman?</p>
<p>Who is Magnus Carlsen?</p>
<p>How did it start?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three games.</p>
<p>It started in Miami.</p>
<p>Yeah, a good background story is Magnus Carlsen</p>
<p>is the arguable greatest player of all time.</p>
<p>Very close, I would say, to Garry Kasparov.</p>
<p>World number one for now over 10 years.</p>
<p>At the top of his game, you think?</p>
<p>Like close to the top of his game right now?</p>
<p>After the most recent thing, yes.</p>
<p>I think he has the uncanny ability of top athletes</p>
<p>to absorb the bullshit and show, oh yeah, dad&rsquo;s home now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Run.</p>
<p>I was only trying 70% before that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what he,</p>
<p>I really think that&rsquo;s what he showed.</p>
<p>I was in awe.</p>
<p>If Magnus is playing in a tournament,</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s good for views to put him in my YouTube thumbnails</p>
<p>and make the video title about him</p>
<p>if he does something brilliant.</p>
<p>But I was legitimately just blown away.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even, I wasn&rsquo;t farming him for content.</p>
<p>This is unbelievable what he&rsquo;s doing to people.</p>
<p>And he has a point to prove.</p>
<p>Hans is a, I believe he&rsquo;s 19 years old right now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an American, I don&rsquo;t know if prodigy</p>
<p>is necessarily the right word.</p>
<p>Prodigies, you know they&rsquo;re prodigies</p>
<p>from very, very young.</p>
<p>In chess, you don&rsquo;t become a prodigy at 18.</p>
<p>But he was always a good junior player.</p>
<p>He was always a very unique character.</p>
<p>I met Hans when he was 11, 12 years old.</p>
<p>He was this little kid just trash talking folks</p>
<p>at the Marshall Chess Club.</p>
<p>And he already had a reputation, literally.</p>
<p>He had a reputation with counselors.</p>
<p>And the truth is I was similar.</p>
<p>I was kicked out of chess camp</p>
<p>by one of the best chess grandmasters of all time,</p>
<p>Artur Yusupov.</p>
<p>I was in a chess camp when I was nine years old.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;d you do?</p>
<p>I was just an asshole.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was too strong.</p>
<p>So I helped other people with other work.</p>
<p>I was loud.</p>
<p>And you let your ego shine.</p>
<p>I was a kid.</p>
<p>I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Not every kid lets their ego shine, but some do.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>Hans does, there&rsquo;s interviews when he&rsquo;s young.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where like, he&rsquo;s kind of talking shit.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s entertaining.</p>
<p>Yes, what I try to stay away from is just,</p>
<p>yes, I let my ego shine,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I even knew what any of that was</p>
<p>when I was younger.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s just sort of,</p>
<p>I was just a loud, boisterous kid</p>
<p>from a household where I wasn&rsquo;t paid attention to</p>
<p>because I had three of them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I just was like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going to show up and get my attention.</p>
<p>And Artur Yusupov, he&rsquo;s a great, great man.</p>
<p>I drove that man crazy.</p>
<p>He was like top five in the world at some point</p>
<p>in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>He said, it&rsquo;s either me or this kid.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So you really got to him.</p>
<p>Yes, he said, I&rsquo;m not going to come back</p>
<p>and teach camps unless it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>And I remember like going through this.</p>
<p>I have very vague, distant memories of this.</p>
<p>My dad calling, apologizing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did it make you feel good that you got to a grandmaster?</p>
<p>No, I felt horrible.</p>
<p>I felt guilty.</p>
<p>I feel guilty my whole life about that.</p>
<p>I very rarely feel proud of bad things or I showed them.</p>
<p>Even things, it gets to the point you feel guilty</p>
<p>about things you didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when your brain really goes crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m with you on that.</p>
<p>So, okay, so you can relate to Hans.</p>
<p>Yes, to young Hans.</p>
<p>And he was like in and out of chess.</p>
<p>This is what I remember.</p>
<p>He was around the rating of 2300.</p>
<p>And I remember looking at some of his games</p>
<p>in a tournament in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>And I was like, there was some game that he played</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t know the opening.</p>
<p>It was like a London, which is a very popular opening,</p>
<p>some theoretical line.</p>
<p>I looked at him like, whoa, he didn&rsquo;t know that?</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>And then I just kind of walked by</p>
<p>and I saw him in a tournament a few months later</p>
<p>and he did something very rare where in an open tournament,</p>
<p>not a tournament of 10 players</p>
<p>where everybody plays everybody, open tournament,</p>
<p>randomized pairings, depending on how many points you have,</p>
<p>he played nine grandmasters, which is crazy.</p>
<p>That means he was performing so well, so consistently.</p>
<p>That was where he got his first IM norm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, here it is.</p>
<p>Here comes that like boom of a young player</p>
<p>where he gets mature, he gets back into the game</p>
<p>and he gets stronger.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t follow a whole lot.</p>
<p>Pandemic happens and he starts streaming a bit</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s boisterous, he&rsquo;s kind of like loud,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking trash and he&rsquo;s gaining rating constantly.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, but so are a lot of people.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think much of it.</p>
<p>And then now you can go play over the board again,</p>
<p>live tournaments, face to face, as opposed to online events.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m gonna go to this tournament.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna win it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get my last GM norm.</p>
<p>And he does.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s like, all right, my goal is this rating</p>
<p>by the end of this year.</p>
<p>He gets it.</p>
<p>And he just demolishes absolutely everybody.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, this guy&rsquo;s for real.</p>
<p>Over the board.</p>
<p>Like this guy&rsquo;s for real.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people like that.</p>
<p>If you look at the top juniors of the world, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Ali Reza Faruja, 2,800.</p>
<p>Vincent Kymer, 2,700.</p>
<p>A bunch of kids from India, 2,700.</p>
<p>Similar age or younger usually?</p>
<p>One or two years younger, maybe a little older by a year.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just this wave and you&rsquo;re just hype for the guy.</p>
<p>Like this is fucking awesome.</p>
<p>Like we got a young American guy who shit talks</p>
<p>every time he&rsquo;s on camera.</p>
<p>And he beats everybody he plays.</p>
<p>But then you start hearing sprinkles here and there,</p>
<p>maybe in some stream.</p>
<p>Oh, I think he doesn&rsquo;t get to play on Chess.com anymore.</p>
<p>Like Chess.com doesn&rsquo;t put that badge there on the account.</p>
<p>Sometimes they just tell the player, listen, we know.</p>
<p>And the player&rsquo;s like, all right, you got me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no conversation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like these sprinkles, but people cheat online,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very captivating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very nice thing to do.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I mean, just to make explicit</p>
<p>that the accusation, and I think it&rsquo;s proven,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still being shady about it</p>
<p>to the degree it&rsquo;s done, is that he cheated on Chess.com</p>
<p>when he was 12?</p>
<p>12 and 16, that&rsquo;s what he said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he admitted to.</p>
<p>But right now, Chess.com put out a statement</p>
<p>and now Magnus put out a statement as well saying,</p>
<p>we think it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve talked to Danny</p>
<p>because he wants to come on the podcast,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m actually kind of interested in.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a cool person.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also doing some really interesting</p>
<p>anti-cheating stuff, which to me,</p>
<p>from an algorithmic perspective, is interesting.</p>
<p>But he is also the man.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s always, in every field,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the institution.</p>
<p>So he represents the institution</p>
<p>because Chess.com is the institution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in the Olympic, it&rsquo;s the IOC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I have to be careful.</p>
<p>Well, and Chess FIDE is the institution.</p>
<p>FIDE, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Chess.com.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve outgrown, way more people actually know Chess.com.</p>
<p>Way more people know me.</p>
<p>Way more people know Hikaru.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons that-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting where the power lays.</p>
<p>Who has the most power?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, Chess.com has the most power?</p>
<p>Which probably-</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you and Hikaru do.</p>
<p>No, um.</p>
<p>To steer public opinion, you know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>I have to think with my evil cap now.</p>
<p>What would happen if-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather you have the evil cap than Hikaru</p>
<p>because I feel like he would really,</p>
<p>you know, the power absolute.</p>
<p>If the two of you ruled the world, it&rsquo;d be a problem.</p>
<p>You mean side by side or rivals?</p>
<p>Yeah, it would be like, yeah.</p>
<p>As rivals, there would definitely be a war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I would not Chess box him.</p>
<p>Do you guys, how much do you like each other?</p>
<p>I mean, do you admire each other as fellow-</p>
<p>I can tell you how I feel.</p>
<p>As fellow entertaining-</p>
<p>Well, we should finish Magnus Hans.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I know, I feel like just inside,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to talk about it</p>
<p>because it feels like it&rsquo;s been talked about so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to give a very-</p>
<p>No, for you, just remember, for me, it&rsquo;s much less.</p>
<p>Yeah, and for the listener, it might be zero.</p>
<p>For the listener, zero, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like Rogan asked me, like, so what, what&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p>I know, I heard him even talking.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this, Chess?</p>
<p>You know, Joe talked about the Indonesia thing.</p>
<p>Oh, he did?</p>
<p>In some super random small thing,</p>
<p>and that was a very funny moment for me.</p>
<p>I told him about this drama a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s like, yeah, this is interesting.</p>
<p>Is it anal beads?</p>
<p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>Is that good?</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how drunk he was,</p>
<p>but so even, you know, he&rsquo;s curious.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t really know, but anyway,</p>
<p>cheating when he was 12, when he was 16,</p>
<p>as he said, he admitted to cheating online</p>
<p>when he was 12 and 16.</p>
<p>Yes, but for timeline&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just do it this way.</p>
<p>He has a lot of over-the-board success,</p>
<p>but nobody really talks about the online cheating stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of kind of kept low key,</p>
<p>couple hundred people, maybe a couple thousand people,</p>
<p>which sounds like a lot,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not because there&rsquo;s millions of viewers</p>
<p>know about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally kept kind of low key</p>
<p>because historically, if you cheated online as a teenager,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not cheating over the board.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>You will get caught.</p>
<p>Nobody has ever attempted it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had over-the-board cheaters,</p>
<p>but not at the ultra elite level.</p>
<p>And so what happens is they play this tournament in Miami,</p>
<p>and the first day Hans loses three nothing.</p>
<p>This is important because on the very next day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like Hans was destroying every day.</p>
<p>The second day of the tournament,</p>
<p>he sits down game one versus Magnus</p>
<p>in their best of four and destroys him.</p>
<p>Like he destroyed him,</p>
<p>made it look like I was playing in Magnus&rsquo; shoes.</p>
<p>You know, the level difference,</p>
<p>it went even like he wasn&rsquo;t close.</p>
<p>Of course we can argue it might be because of the,</p>
<p>maybe Magnus knew something ahead of time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously the psychological element,</p>
<p>not important.</p>
<p>Hans leaves.</p>
<p>They say, interviewer says,</p>
<p>Hans yesterday, by the way,</p>
<p>horribly phrased interview question.</p>
<p>He goes, Hans, yesterday was a terrible for you.</p>
<p>And today you start with a masterpiece.</p>
<p>What do you have to say?</p>
<p>Chess speaks for itself, walks away.</p>
<p>Argue, you can argue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cringe, you can argue.</p>
<p>I thought it was cool.</p>
<p>And then the guy then keeps asking a question</p>
<p>with his arm extended because he&rsquo;s so shocked.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Like he didn&rsquo;t even occur to him</p>
<p>how ridiculous it looked to be asking.</p>
<p>And then not only does Hans come back</p>
<p>and loses the best of four,</p>
<p>he loses like two more games or maybe three.</p>
<p>He had to think he lost the next three games.</p>
<p>He then proceeds to lose every single best of four match</p>
<p>for the rest of the tournament.</p>
<p>He ends with zero points and a prize money of $0.</p>
<p>They put up the graphic and he put Nieman zero.</p>
<p>I think he got some minimum, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, wow, this is like insane.</p>
<p>This guy comes out with this crazy interview.</p>
<p>And in my recap videos, I was like,</p>
<p>the next time Hans has success,</p>
<p>he has to stay away from the cameras.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let him talk.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t let him talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be bad luck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m joking around.</p>
<p>Like next time he plays, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna.</p>
<p>So that was their kind of first interaction there.</p>
<p>They also, there was some photos.</p>
<p>They were having fun playing on the beach.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they had a chess board on the beach.</p>
<p>Chess players are such-</p>
<p>Magnus and Hans?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they were still getting along.</p>
<p>I guess so, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because I talked to him at that time.</p>
<p>Would he have mentioned something?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I wonder what he would have said</p>
<p>if I asked him about Hans.</p>
<p>Because I was clueless.</p>
<p>Did anyone care about Hans?</p>
<p>Nobody, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Hans is not a super known entity, right?</p>
<p>He became much more known.</p>
<p>He became probably a top five</p>
<p>all-time popular chess player in the last three weeks.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t even be a worthy question.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe Magnus already kind of knew.</p>
<p>A lot of the top players, it seems,</p>
<p>are coming out now and saying,</p>
<p>we already were suspicious.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems like Magnus might have known,</p>
<p>but maybe not enough to address it.</p>
<p>He still might not be willing to address it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But anyway, so yeah,</p>
<p>so totally horrible tournament performance after.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>After Hans beat Magnus.</p>
<p>Then the annual tradition</p>
<p>of the St. Louis tournaments happens,</p>
<p>which is a strong field of players</p>
<p>first for a fast tournament, rapid and blitz,</p>
<p>and a classical tournament.</p>
<p>And the classical tournament is the Sinkfield Cup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s named after Rex Sinkfield,</p>
<p>billionaire chess philanthropist.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like St. Louis Chess Club.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a prestigious place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this whole, yeah.</p>
<p>And the host of a prestigious tournament.</p>
<p>Hall of Fame is there for chess.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s U.S. Hall of Fame</p>
<p>or Worldwide Hall of Fame,</p>
<p>but yeah, it&rsquo;s the tournament.</p>
<p>Other countries play chess?</p>
<p>Oh, they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They do, but you know, we will,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who determines</p>
<p>where the Hall of Fame gets to be.</p>
<p>If we say it&rsquo;s the Hall of Fame, okay.</p>
<p>One day, some other part of the world&rsquo;s gonna be like,</p>
<p>actually, it&rsquo;s over here.</p>
<p>So basically what happens</p>
<p>is we have a field set for the Sinkfield Cup.</p>
<p>Set, it&rsquo;s the top 10 players in the world.</p>
<p>Some can&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>So, okay, you get number 11 in there or something.</p>
<p>One of them can&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>because of something related to coronavirus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, now we&rsquo;re gonna get a little asterisk</p>
<p>on Spotify because it was mentioned.</p>
<p>Get more info about COVID-19.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know why he couldn&rsquo;t come,</p>
<p>but he couldn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>Okay, something happens.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>Hans Niemann is the replacement.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At the time, we didn&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but now weeks later, we knew Magnus wanted to not play.</p>
<p>This is very important.</p>
<p>Back then, we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Apparently some other top players also didn&rsquo;t wanna play.</p>
<p>They also were suspicious.</p>
<p>They also wanted increased anti-cheating measures,</p>
<p>which by the way in chess are dog shit.</p>
<p>Like you give this little metal wand</p>
<p>and you put it on the little ear&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s apparently an argument,</p>
<p>a micro earpiece would not be caught,</p>
<p>something in the armpit vibrating would not be caught,</p>
<p>something in the shoe,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t make the players take their shoes off</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too elitist.</p>
<p>How are you gonna make players take their shoes off?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, oh my God.</p>
<p>But if these things are out there.</p>
<p>Or if anything was inside any other orifice.</p>
<p>Correct, yes.</p>
<p>I have to bring that up.</p>
<p>I mean, to be honest, yes, that is very truthful.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>If nothing else, this podcast is about honesty and truth,</p>
<p>so I have to be complete, thank you.</p>
<p>And transparency.</p>
<p>So what ends up happening in the Singfield Cup</p>
<p>is Magnus ends up still playing,</p>
<p>but the anti-cheat measures are not introduced.</p>
<p>So the first few games,</p>
<p>Hans has a very, very impressive first round game</p>
<p>against Levon Oronian,</p>
<p>one of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>Okay, draw.</p>
<p>He was pushing, draw.</p>
<p>Second game, demolishes.</p>
<p>Like a top player.</p>
<p>Mamed Yarov crushes him.</p>
<p>Dominant opening, but not like a perfect game.</p>
<p>You understand?</p>
<p>It was, he made some inaccuracies here and there,</p>
<p>and he ended up winning in a complex game.</p>
<p>This game three happens versus Magnus.</p>
<p>And not only does he beat Magnus with the black pieces,</p>
<p>he dominates him from start to finish.</p>
<p>So in the opening, Magnus played something with white</p>
<p>that he had maybe played once or twice before.</p>
<p>There was some big debate about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna get into it.</p>
<p>But basically a very niche, small thing</p>
<p>that just he had never played in maybe a long game before</p>
<p>with some sprinkled in venom that might get Hans off guard.</p>
<p>Hans proceeds to play like the first 15, 20 moves</p>
<p>absolutely perfectly.</p>
<p>And then converts the game into a slightly better end game</p>
<p>and squeezes Magnus to death.</p>
<p>Basically beats Magnus with black,</p>
<p>which nobody had done in years.</p>
<p>The same way Magnus would have beaten other players.</p>
<p>Then he goes and gives this interview which,</p>
<p>where he claims that he had looked</p>
<p>at those first 15, 20 moves right before the game basically.</p>
<p>He got lucky.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t he say he looked at something very similar?</p>
<p>No, no, it was either similar</p>
<p>or literally that exact variation, which is possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that before.</p>
<p>One of my best wins of my life.</p>
<p>That morning I went, you know, I&rsquo;m not prepared.</p>
<p>What if my opponent plays this Queen&rsquo;s Gambit</p>
<p>accepted variation?</p>
<p>And I literally learned the first 12 moves.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know move 12.</p>
<p>I killed him.</p>
<p>Okay, like it just happens.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you combine that</p>
<p>with other small elements of the interview</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s body language experts going all on this,</p>
<p>it was odd.</p>
<p>He gave an interview afterwards explaining his,</p>
<p>explaining various details of the game.</p>
<p>But not really explaining them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>The standard chess player interview is you sit down,</p>
<p>you go something about the opening, something about not,</p>
<p>oh yeah, I looked at this right before the game.</p>
<p>And then you explain various symphonies</p>
<p>and compositions of variations,</p>
<p>things that went through your head,</p>
<p>things you were evaluating.</p>
<p>But Hans&rsquo;s interviews are different.</p>
<p>So everything about him as a chess player</p>
<p>already is different.</p>
<p>And his interviews are extremely strange and also different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But not when you combine it then with the world champion</p>
<p>withdrawing right after you beat him</p>
<p>and ghosting the entire chess world.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a, for people who haven&rsquo;t listened to it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of sloppiness</p>
<p>to the way he analyzes the game.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very-</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very obvious.</p>
<p>Like what do you mean?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just completely winning here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m completely winning here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, I just played perfect.</p>
<p>I played perfect.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a sense of like,</p>
<p>but it also doesn&rsquo;t, for me, again,</p>
<p>a very outside spectator, it doesn&rsquo;t raise any red flags.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just his personality.</p>
<p>He seems to really like to talk this way.</p>
<p>And plus this could be crazy,</p>
<p>but do you have a sense that he&rsquo;s more of an intuitive player</p>
<p>versus like he&rsquo;s just not the kind of person</p>
<p>that analyzes really well?</p>
<p>Or is that a ridiculous notion?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>To succeed legitimately,</p>
<p>because obviously this is a cheating scandal</p>
<p>at the end of the day,</p>
<p>at the 2750, 82800 level, the upper echelon of chess,</p>
<p>you cannot be an intuitive player.</p>
<p>You can be a little bit more intuitive than a calculator</p>
<p>and a concrete evaluator of positions.</p>
<p>Meaning if I give you five seconds to play a move,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna choose the best move quickly.</p>
<p>Those people are generally better at fast time controls,</p>
<p>but you have to be good at everything.</p>
<p>And what raised red flags in this interview</p>
<p>was the fact that it was different</p>
<p>than every other interview any human being ever gave</p>
<p>at that level of chess,</p>
<p>particularly after beating Magnus</p>
<p>for the first time as a teenager,</p>
<p>which is a very small group of people.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where it got weird.</p>
<p>And the very next day, Magnus withdraws from the event.</p>
<p>Chess world lights completely on fire for multiple weeks.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>He also tweets.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the resignation.</p>
<p>Resignation.</p>
<p>The tweet was,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m withdrawing from the tournament in St. Louis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed playing here and I will in the future.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s a clip of Jose Mourinho.</p>
<p>I cannot speak.</p>
<p>I choose not to speak.</p>
<p>If I speak, I&rsquo;m in big trouble.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be in big trouble.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s some people nuts.</p>
<p>People said it&rsquo;s not even a cheating insinuation,</p>
<p>which was one of the theories.</p>
<p>Another theory was someone in team Magnus</p>
<p>told Hans what Magnus was looking at.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why Hans learned those first 15 moves,</p>
<p>which is so fucking stupid</p>
<p>because Magnus knows like five people.</p>
<p>Not in his life, but his team is five people.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very close-knit group.</p>
<p>Right, but to the outsider,</p>
<p>that sounds like a very legitimate theory.</p>
<p>How else can you explain?</p>
<p>Hans said he knew before the game what was gonna happen.</p>
<p>Magnus senses a mole he&rsquo;s not, no.</p>
<p>By the way, just so I know,</p>
<p>like if that was, forget the cheating aside,</p>
<p>if you knew, doesn&rsquo;t matter how,</p>
<p>the opening your opponent is going to do, they prepared,</p>
<p>is that a significant help to you?</p>
<p>If that opening is ultra sharp</p>
<p>and requires basically the game to be on a knife&rsquo;s edge,</p>
<p>yes, meaning one mistake can be fatal.</p>
<p>Because then you can look up what the engine says.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can know everything.</p>
<p>You can know all the possibilities.</p>
<p>So even if your opponent goes off that engine path,</p>
<p>you will know how to punish it.</p>
<p>In this case, what happened basically</p>
<p>was Magnus played a line</p>
<p>that if completely optimally punished</p>
<p>would have given Hans a slightly better position,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>But then he also demolished him</p>
<p>in that later phase of the game.</p>
<p>Yes, and then, okay, so Magnus designs,</p>
<p>goes silent, the chess world goes crazy.</p>
<p>What else is interesting in that period of time?</p>
<p>Hans&rsquo;s fourth round game of that tournament,</p>
<p>right after beating Magnus was also just absolutely genius,</p>
<p>just an absolutely brilliant game, which he failed to win.</p>
<p>But then after that game,</p>
<p>he also gives once again another interview</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s like, this game was absolutely genius.</p>
<p>Like this was, I was just killing him from start to finish.</p>
<p>And like, there was a moment he literally says,</p>
<p>oh yeah, just gave him a piece, like a full piece,</p>
<p>which is a substantial advantage to the other side.</p>
<p>And he starts explaining why the position is winning,</p>
<p>but in words, not in chess moves,</p>
<p>not in specific concrete chess moves,</p>
<p>which is the way you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>if you understand the position, right?</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s this new theory that&rsquo;s being cultivated.</p>
<p>The interviews are gonna be used as the evidence.</p>
<p>And beyond round four,</p>
<p>he just played like a good grandmaster</p>
<p>and he lost two or three games, maybe two games,</p>
<p>and he drew the rest.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t win again.</p>
<p>Like he beat in the first two out of his first three games,</p>
<p>he beat Mamid Yarev, he beat Carlsen.</p>
<p>And he also went on the attack himself.</p>
<p>That was when he publicly admitted to cheating</p>
<p>in an interview that he gave to the St. Louis Chess Club.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when he said he has never cheated over the board.</p>
<p>Then he said, Chess.com has banned me</p>
<p>from the global championship,</p>
<p>which is what I was invited to, to play.</p>
<p>Privately, they banned me, didn&rsquo;t even ban me publicly.</p>
<p>And then he said, and Hikaru is on Twitch every day,</p>
<p>saying things about me, this and that.</p>
<p>And since then, nothing.</p>
<p>Tournament finishes somehow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we got to the end of the tournament.</p>
<p>I really thought that it was gonna get called off,</p>
<p>but tournament ends.</p>
<p>Hans hasn&rsquo;t said anything since then.</p>
<p>Has he still said, when was the last time he said something?</p>
<p>That was the last tweet that he sent, September 7th.</p>
<p>He said, Hikaru wants to play the victim,</p>
<p>something like this.</p>
<p>They faced each other again recently.</p>
<p>When was that, what was that about?</p>
<p>They played in the online event</p>
<p>of this Meltwater Champions Chess Tour,</p>
<p>which is a 16-player tournament</p>
<p>where everybody plays everybody first.</p>
<p>And after 15 games, the top eight make a knockout bracket.</p>
<p>And Magnus played the game.</p>
<p>There was obviously a lot of hype prior</p>
<p>for what was gonna happen in this game.</p>
<p>Magnus plays one move and resigns.</p>
<p>Actually, I imagine he didn&rsquo;t wanna play one move.</p>
<p>I imagine he would have resigned the game</p>
<p>as it was starting, but I think some websites</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let you resign before you make one move</p>
<p>because then the game isn&rsquo;t counted.</p>
<p>So I think he didn&rsquo;t wanna play at all,</p>
<p>but he played one move and that made it even more epic,</p>
<p>I suppose, and he resigned.</p>
<p>And that was that.</p>
<p>So you lose, that game counts, right?</p>
<p>Oh, game counts.</p>
<p>You lose the rating.</p>
<p>These online events, unfortunately,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t count for any sort of rating.</p>
<p>But on the tournament, yeah, you play one move, yeah.</p>
<p>So he resigns.</p>
<p>And then how does the tournament still work out?</p>
<p>Is the tournament already over?</p>
<p>So he made the eight as Magnus still made the top eight.</p>
<p>It was round five or like round six or something.</p>
<p>So it was halfway through the preliminary stage.</p>
<p>It affected his standings.</p>
<p>But then after resigning that game,</p>
<p>Magnus finished first in the bracket, in the preliminaries,</p>
<p>and then he won the entire event.</p>
<p>There was a chance that they were gonna meet in the final,</p>
<p>but Hans lost in the first round</p>
<p>against the Vietnamese strong player, Le Quang Liem.</p>
<p>And then Magnus gave a short interview</p>
<p>to the live broadcast where he said</p>
<p>he would give a statement at the end of the tournament.</p>
<p>And then he did.</p>
<p>He gave a statement at the end of the tournament.</p>
<p>And now here we are.</p>
<p>The only other thing missing from this</p>
<p>is the very intense scrutinization</p>
<p>of all those over-the-board games that I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>that Hans dominated in.</p>
<p>So people are now going through all of his games</p>
<p>that he played in tournaments.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re analyzing them with engines</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying he played exceptionally well.</p>
<p>And the debate is, was he cheating</p>
<p>or was he way too good already, but underrated?</p>
<p>Because he could have had incubated knowledge.</p>
<p>So he could have not played for a couple of years,</p>
<p>was 2,700 level, but was playing people who are 24, 2,500.</p>
<p>Well, I see.</p>
<p>So not just over the board with the top level people</p>
<p>like Magnus, but over the board in general.</p>
<p>Yes, before he got a chance to play in the super tournaments</p>
<p>against the best players in the world,</p>
<p>he had to go to Europe.</p>
<p>He was the most active chess player in 2021.</p>
<p>And he was quite dominant.</p>
<p>Yes, I think he played more over-the-board games</p>
<p>than any player in 2021 or 2022.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 2021.</p>
<p>And yes, I think his rise was steeper than everybody.</p>
<p>Maybe with the exception of, well,</p>
<p>there was a Faruja who got to 2,800.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;d like to believe,</p>
<p>because he talks about being very,</p>
<p>he just became obsessed with chess.</p>
<p>I like stories like that.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>I like stories of the underdog,</p>
<p>especially with the scarlet letter</p>
<p>of having been a cheater in the past.</p>
<p>I like the idea of somebody who is flawed</p>
<p>psychologically and ethically,</p>
<p>and just a full fascinating personality.</p>
<p>And this somehow just becomes obsessed.</p>
<p>I mean, similar to Bobby Fischer,</p>
<p>is also a tortured soul, also flawed,</p>
<p>also just chaotic all over the place.</p>
<p>You could see Bobby Fischer being somebody</p>
<p>that might cheat when he was 12 on online chess, right?</p>
<p>If it existed, yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, I think in some podcasts,</p>
<p>like small chess podcasts, I don&rsquo;t wanna,</p>
<p>I like Ben Johnson, so I&rsquo;m apologizing for calling it small,</p>
<p>but compared to like, let&rsquo;s say, Alex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his podcast?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Perpetual Chess, it&rsquo;s kind of like-</p>
<p>Oh, I love Perpetual Chess.</p>
<p>Are you joking?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>How dare you call, yeah, wait, all right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show you.</p>
<p>Because it does a lot of, it talks,</p>
<p>it makes me feel special.</p>
<p>Let me see, where is it, Perpetual Chess?</p>
<p>He does like, Improver series.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s great, Ben.</p>
<p>I forgot, I&rsquo;m so horrible with names.</p>
<p>His name is Ben, Ben Johnson?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is Ben Johnson, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Perpetual Chess podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>See, Lex, when, even individuals like myself</p>
<p>who might have a large audience,</p>
<p>when I look at you, you&rsquo;re at a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just at a different level.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect you to be listening</p>
<p>to chess podcasts during,</p>
<p>just imagine you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>doing something to change the world,</p>
<p>or talking to some visionary people.</p>
<p>Well, I should say, I&rsquo;ve been running a lot,</p>
<p>and I listen to podcasts a lot,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re such, I love human beings,</p>
<p>excited about stuff.</p>
<p>That really energizes me,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve listened to a bunch of chess podcasts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really energized by your love of chess.</p>
<p>I really like, yeah, sorry,</p>
<p>I did forget his name, but Ben Johnson.</p>
<p>I love it when he talks to grandmasters.</p>
<p>I love it when he talks to the regular folks</p>
<p>for the improvers, to see how they balance life</p>
<p>in chess and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just pretty good at it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super excited, and they talk about books.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they get excited about different books.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, it also gives me a sense</p>
<p>of where the chess world is,</p>
<p>from a different perspective,</p>
<p>is like people studying chess,</p>
<p>like what they get excited about,</p>
<p>how difficult it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s nice to get a sense of the community,</p>
<p>the language that&rsquo;s used,</p>
<p>because I did wanna have a bunch of conversations</p>
<p>with folks about chess,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful game,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful community.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the podcasts I listen to.</p>
<p>So yeah, anyway, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Anyway, you were saying, why did you bring him up?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Great podcast.</p>
<p>Great podcast.</p>
<p>Only reason I thought of it,</p>
<p>and I use the word small, no disrespect, Ben,</p>
<p>is because even that episode,</p>
<p>which he did with Hans,</p>
<p>like it was a small episode.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t seen by mass audience of chess.</p>
<p>You did an episode with Hans recently?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Some time ago, yeah.</p>
<p>And in that episode, Hans very openly is like,</p>
<p>Bobby Fischer was misunderstood, and he was my idol.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>He said a couple of things like that, and-</p>
<p>Strong words, Hans.</p>
<p>Hans is an intense guy.</p>
<p>When I listen to Hans, I get a little anxious.</p>
<p>He brings out some sort of disturbance in my ecosystem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t really pin him down to what&rsquo;s going on there</p>
<p>as a person who&rsquo;s trying to read people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>This is the dark aspect.</p>
<p>He could be both the genius of Bobby Fischer</p>
<p>and a genius cheater.</p>
<p>And you could see there&rsquo;s something chaotic about him,</p>
<p>which makes him very appealing in that way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So right now, late September, 2022,</p>
<p>the current environment is such</p>
<p>that Hans hasn&rsquo;t said anything in weeks,</p>
<p>and people are sort of dissecting every bit</p>
<p>of circumstantial evidence that they can,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to present the case.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know to who, ultimately.</p>
<p>I guess it would be the FIDE Cheating,</p>
<p>Anti-Cheating Commission, or whatever.</p>
<p>It might be to you, essentially.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>To people with the platform.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>To present convincing evidence to where the people,</p>
<p>the people are convinced that one way or the other.</p>
<p>Because for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and they should definitely follow Gotham Chess,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been on this, you&rsquo;ve covered it a lot,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure if anything comes out, you&rsquo;ll cover it more.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve been quite balanced and thoughtful</p>
<p>and kind of objective about the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the reason for that is</p>
<p>I understand the power that I wield with anything,</p>
<p>and if I say one sentence the wrong way,</p>
<p>I might be sending 10,000 people or more</p>
<p>to go do something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I hate that.</p>
<p>I want to present the evidence,</p>
<p>and I want the video to end, and people go,</p>
<p>okay, I understand.</p>
<p>Not, I&rsquo;m gonna go fuck someone up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I also believe that even if Hans,</p>
<p>even if Hans is guilty, this goes all the way back,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a human being.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you can argue that cheaters gotta be punished,</p>
<p>and you can argue that people who do things wrong,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t feel any sort of compassion,</p>
<p>but I would hate to have the whole world</p>
<p>pointing their fingers at me,</p>
<p>the entire world that I&rsquo;ve known my entire life,</p>
<p>and even if I messed up, there&rsquo;s still a world after chess.</p>
<p>There might still even be a world in chess.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but that stuff, it doesn&rsquo;t make me feel good</p>
<p>to present all of the circumstantial evidence in my videos</p>
<p>and start being like, yeah, it looks so.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you deeply care about chess</p>
<p>and the chess community, and there&rsquo;s some sense where,</p>
<p>was it you or was it Magnus that said</p>
<p>that cheating poses an existential threat to chess?</p>
<p>Magnus said that.</p>
<p>I mean, there is some aspect of truth to that,</p>
<p>which is like, you know, the chess is in a state</p>
<p>where bots, chess engines are much better than humans,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re living in a world where technology</p>
<p>becomes easier and easier to integrate with human beings,</p>
<p>whether you put it in some office or elsewhere,</p>
<p>and that does pose a threat to our ability to trust</p>
<p>that a world champion is indeed a world champion,</p>
<p>that somebody we think is good is indeed good.</p>
<p>And so there is some aspect to the ecosystem</p>
<p>that should punish cheating and perhaps over-punish cheating.</p>
<p>And the other thing is, in sport, you can take PEDs</p>
<p>and have bigger muscles, better reaction time,</p>
<p>but you still have to perform the action</p>
<p>in a successful way.</p>
<p>There is still a chance you can lose if you take PEDs.</p>
<p>Maybe in some sports,</p>
<p>the gap between non-PED and PED user</p>
<p>is significantly more noticeable,</p>
<p>but in chess, if you cheat, you play God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You decide when the game is over.</p>
<p>You can fake bad moves.</p>
<p>You can fake everything.</p>
<p>You can even, if you&rsquo;re cheating quote-unquote</p>
<p>the right way, you&rsquo;re gonna lose plenty of games</p>
<p>to avoid getting detected.</p>
<p>So you can create bots that are 2,800.</p>
<p>You can also just not listen.</p>
<p>If you know all the best moves,</p>
<p>but choose to play on your own,</p>
<p>and oh, I made a mistake, not a big deal.</p>
<p>You could, yes, bots are all at a different level.</p>
<p>But if you were to cheat, that you play God.</p>
<p>You can decide when you make your move</p>
<p>and when the engine makes its move.</p>
<p>And if you know the top four lines of the engine,</p>
<p>you choose the fourth one.</p>
<p>So in hindsight, people will analyze your game</p>
<p>and they will go, oh, it wasn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>Well, no shit.</p>
<p>Only the stupid cheaters play the top engine line</p>
<p>the whole game.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m not saying that this is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening here, but there&rsquo;s probably an excitement</p>
<p>to playing God and getting away with it.</p>
<p>I know people, I know adults, grown adults</p>
<p>who are successful in their fields and they cheat.</p>
<p>They cheat in lessons, they cheat in,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve, I don&rsquo;t wanna say I&rsquo;ve taught any.</p>
<p>May or may not have.</p>
<p>For some reason, one of them watches this</p>
<p>and they know they&rsquo;re guilty.</p>
<p>And it happens, it happens.</p>
<p>Not just teenagers, not just young adults,</p>
<p>but full grown adults will cheat when they play</p>
<p>because they think it helps them learn.</p>
<p>Oh, well, that could be just a justification.</p>
<p>But I just meant like, it might not be just about winning.</p>
<p>It might also just feel good to have that power.</p>
<p>Like, I bet you it&rsquo;s a drug.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, like with a lot of criminals,</p>
<p>with a lot of criminals, I feel like part of,</p>
<p>like the mass murderers, serial killers,</p>
<p>I feel like a lot of it is they can get away with it.</p>
<p>The fact that they, like everyone else is a sucker</p>
<p>and they figured out how to do this evil thing.</p>
<p>And obviously cheating is nowhere close to that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still a feeling of getting away with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re pretty objective on the whole thing.</p>
<p>Where, if you were a betting man,</p>
<p>what would you say is the probability?</p>
<p>Are you changing day by day in your head?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the probability that Hans cheated?</p>
<p>Over the board against Magnus in St. Louis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough one, man.</p>
<p>Have you even allowed yourself to put a probability on it?</p>
<p>No, not on that specific game</p>
<p>because I think a lot of that game</p>
<p>was affected by Magnus&rsquo; own psyche.</p>
<p>That was one of his worst games ever.</p>
<p>So he played poorly too, Magnus played poorly.</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t help his case.</p>
<p>Hans might&rsquo;ve cheated in that game, but we&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>I think day by day,</p>
<p>the evidence is slowly starting to show more and more</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s cheated, like how Magnus said,</p>
<p>more than he said and more recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s undeniable.</p>
<p>A lot of the statistics are there.</p>
<p>The problem is you can&rsquo;t prove you&rsquo;re not cheating</p>
<p>unless you strip naked,</p>
<p>like that site offered him a million bucks to.</p>
<p>Everything about the Hans-</p>
<p>Which site offered him a million bucks?</p>
<p>I saw some headline that said</p>
<p>Hans Niemann was offered a million bucks.</p>
<p>And where I struggle to comprehend</p>
<p>is how on earth he could pull it off.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a guilty, my brain goes to guilt first</p>
<p>and resentment, remorse, guilt, that trio.</p>
<p>Magnus put out a statement as we speak yesterday</p>
<p>saying, dear Chess World, at the 2022 Sinkfield Cup,</p>
<p>I made the unprecedented professional decision</p>
<p>to withdraw from the tournament</p>
<p>after my round three game against Hans Niemann.</p>
<p>A week later, during the Champions Chess Tour,</p>
<p>I resigned against Hans Niemann</p>
<p>after playing only one move.</p>
<p>I know that my actions have frustrated</p>
<p>many in the chess community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m frustrated.</p>
<p>I want to play chess.</p>
<p>I want to continue to play chess</p>
<p>at the highest level and the best events.</p>
<p>I believe that cheating in chess is a big deal</p>
<p>and an existential threat to the game.</p>
<p>I also believe that chess organizers</p>
<p>and all those who care about the sanctity of the game</p>
<p>we love should seriously consider</p>
<p>increasing security measures</p>
<p>and methods of cheat detection for over-the-board chess.</p>
<p>When Niemann was invited last minute</p>
<p>to the 2022 Sinkfield Cup,</p>
<p>I strongly considered withdrawing prior to the event</p>
<p>I ultimately chose to play.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>is that now we know he was torn about the whole thing.</p>
<p>I believe that Niemann has cheated more and more recently</p>
<p>than he has publicly admitted.</p>
<p>His over-the-board progress has been unusual</p>
<p>and throughout our game in Sinkfield Cup,</p>
<p>I had the impression that he wasn&rsquo;t tense</p>
<p>or even fully concentrating on the game</p>
<p>in critical positions</p>
<p>while outplaying me as black</p>
<p>in a way I think only a handful of players can do.</p>
<p>This game contributed to changing my perspective.</p>
<p>He must do, we must do something about cheating.</p>
<p>And for my part going forward,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to play against people</p>
<p>that have cheated repeatedly in the past</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re capable</p>
<p>of doing in the future.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more than I would like to say, unfortunately.</p>
<p>At this time, I&rsquo;m limited in what I can say</p>
<p>without explicit permission from Niemann to speak openly.</p>
<p>So far, I have only been able to speak with my actions</p>
<p>and those actions have stated clearly</p>
<p>that I am not willing to play chess with Niemann.</p>
<p>I hope that the truth in this matter comes out,</p>
<p>whatever it may be.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Magnus Carlsen, world chess champion.</p>
<p>How would you sign off your statements?</p>
<p>If I was a world, no, just say whatever.</p>
<p>Lex Fridman, what would be the title?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think I would not, even if I was a world champion,</p>
<p>I would just say Lex or make up a title.</p>
<p>And I feel like I really fucked up in life</p>
<p>if I have to tweet a statement as an image.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like when you get, you&rsquo;re a politician</p>
<p>and you got caught cheating on your wife,</p>
<p>like for many years in a row.</p>
<p>Then I tweet an image,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for all the people I have hurt</p>
<p>and the people that believed in me and whatever else.</p>
<p>And then I would sign world chess champion.</p>
<p>You know, the most, like the modern way to give a statement,</p>
<p>what I thought Magnus was gonna do.</p>
<p>Thought he was gonna write on the recent scandal</p>
<p>or my statement on the past few weeks, twit longer.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>So you put a URL.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for tweets, but it&rsquo;s unlimited characters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 140.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>Can you explain that to me?</p>
<p>Yeah, so generally when a celebrity</p>
<p>has a giant audience on Twitter,</p>
<p>they will make their statement on social media</p>
<p>and say what it is in a sentence, one line,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a link.</p>
<p>Where does the link take you?</p>
<p>To a website called twit longer.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the actual website.</p>
<p>Twit longer, twit longer, yeah.</p>
<p>And that is where they write their statement.</p>
<p>That is what I was expecting.</p>
<p>Wait, who did this?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen this before.</p>
<p>Oh, this is, I don&rsquo;t have one off the top of my head,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>Is this like Kanye, Kim Kardashian breaking up,</p>
<p>they would use that?</p>
<p>Streamers, musicians, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think politicians use it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just, they use the image.</p>
<p>Yeah, Myspace and Facebook, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would probably go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just being biased here just because I have a podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of podcasts.</p>
<p>I feel like I would go on a podcast to talk about it</p>
<p>with somebody I trust, so like long form and discuss it.</p>
<p>Thought he was gonna do that too.</p>
<p>In fact, I wanted to write him a message</p>
<p>and be like, I can be that guy for you.</p>
<p>I have a very strange relationship with Magnus because-</p>
<p>Good, bad?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ve never interacted.</p>
<p>I very openly, I don&rsquo;t wanna say use him for views</p>
<p>because that is a very crude way of saying it,</p>
<p>but if you wanted to insult my YouTube channel,</p>
<p>that is what you would say.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Oh, Magnus is in a lot of videos?</p>
<p>Thumbnails or videos, not clickbaity,</p>
<p>but if he&rsquo;s playing in a tournament</p>
<p>and he plays a great game,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going on that fucking thumbnail because-</p>
<p>Oh, because, let&rsquo;s see, he&rsquo;s the number one chess player,</p>
<p>very likely the greatest chess player of all time,</p>
<p>plus he&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>And YouTube algorithm loves his name</p>
<p>and people click on it.</p>
<p>Oh, do they?</p>
<p>His videos do the best.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t know what the chicken or the egg is,</p>
<p>but the reason it loves it, the reason people click on it</p>
<p>is because he is an exciting personality.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an exciting chess player.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something compelling about him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He knows how to, in a subtle, dry, wit, humor way,</p>
<p>talk shit with the silences and all of that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He knows it, he knows it, he knows the whole game of it.</p>
<p>Specifically to Magnus, my relationship with him,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never interacted</p>
<p>and throughout the last couple of years,</p>
<p>he generally has interacted with Hikaru as a competitor.</p>
<p>He has done some collabs with the Botezes.</p>
<p>He obviously has talked to Ludwig,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a very, very big streamer.</p>
<p>And part of me regrets the fact that</p>
<p>when I was smaller as a YouTuber and a Twitch streamer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I used to make jokes or some tweets at Magnus.</p>
<p>Like when Magnus would tweet something,</p>
<p>I would try to respond so I could be the top reply</p>
<p>because that was my social media.</p>
<p>I literally think, I once responded to a Magnus tweet</p>
<p>and saying, responding for engagement.</p>
<p>Because it wasn&rsquo;t some controversial tweet.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It was just something funny.</p>
<p>And I went, ha-ha, responding for engagement</p>
<p>because I was just being a little bit of an idiot</p>
<p>and I knew that if it got enough likes,</p>
<p>it would be at the top and people would see me, my brand,</p>
<p>and just get to know me.</p>
<p>This is the type of-</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t use the word brand, but yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But yeah, no, and your worry is</p>
<p>that he wouldn&rsquo;t take you seriously.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t take me seriously</p>
<p>and if I was one of the best of all time</p>
<p>and I saw some dude on YouTube just kind of being a moron</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m all over his thumbnails,</p>
<p>I can imagine he has a very legitimate case.</p>
<p>I appreciate your humility and self-critical nature,</p>
<p>but one of the realities with people like him</p>
<p>is he wouldn&rsquo;t hold a grudge or not treat you seriously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s a fan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big supporter.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t watch YouTube videos of that kind.</p>
<p>I barely watch YouTube videos.</p>
<p>I think of chess.</p>
<p>He might watch more fun chess adjacent stuff,</p>
<p>but he just doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not for him.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty sure he knows of you and likes you</p>
<p>and your commenting on stuff has zero effect on his belief,</p>
<p>which is funny that&rsquo;s something you think about.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re perfect, but you&rsquo;re well-respected.</p>
<p>A lot of people mention you as a person who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, this person&rsquo;s legit, which is an important thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an entertainer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a shit talker and so on.</p>
<p>This person is a great educator, a great fan</p>
<p>and student of chess, a great player himself.</p>
<p>So all of those components.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, you&rsquo;re definitely a good person.</p>
<p>And on this particular aspect, have been very objective.</p>
<p>I understand that I&rsquo;m nowhere near perfect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a different person on camera or off camera.</p>
<p>I will say it like it is, maybe on Twitch.</p>
<p>You gotta dig in the mud there a little bit more,</p>
<p>a lot more sarcastic, a lot more brash and whatnot,</p>
<p>but you meet me in a taco place</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk with you the same way I might</p>
<p>if it was a video, just that you may not consider me</p>
<p>just a random guy at a taco place.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think about this stuff</p>
<p>with specific to Magnus.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the reasons I don&rsquo;t reach out</p>
<p>to him directly ever.</p>
<p>I never have, I&rsquo;ve never DM&rsquo;d him on Instagram</p>
<p>hoping for a response, never.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never even reached out to anyone on his team</p>
<p>trying to get a conversation very candid with him,</p>
<p>which I think it would be.</p>
<p>I even barely reached out to guys in the top 10,</p>
<p>like top 15, only recently started pushing myself more</p>
<p>to do that.</p>
<p>And I, even in my intro messages to them,</p>
<p>preemptively say something like,</p>
<p>you might think I&rsquo;m some idiot,</p>
<p>you might not be totally wrong.</p>
<p>But like, I think this would be a good conversation</p>
<p>and give it a shot.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been surprised, I&rsquo;ve been ignored by a few,</p>
<p>but some said, oh yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen your stuff.</p>
<p>Generally a fan, like no problem.</p>
<p>I was actually really blown away.</p>
<p>This YouTube channel, Levidov Chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a Russian chess channel.</p>
<p>And I think the last name of the guy is,</p>
<p>the name of the channel is named after Ilya Levidov,</p>
<p>who has some sort of managerial role</p>
<p>in the Russian Chess Federation.</p>
<p>And this channel has interviewed</p>
<p>some of the greatest players of all time.</p>
<p>They have interviews with the modern best Russian players</p>
<p>and Kasparov, Karpov, Kramnik,</p>
<p>you name these guys from Russian chess history,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>I just thought this was a channel</p>
<p>of just unbelievably well-respected chess players</p>
<p>and legion of fans that were longtime chess fans.</p>
<p>And I mentioned them very briefly in the YouTube video.</p>
<p>And that little clip went into their next community event.</p>
<p>And the founder of the channel</p>
<p>went on this two minute beautiful description</p>
<p>of why he liked me</p>
<p>and how he only watched my channel as a beginner</p>
<p>and how I have a natural voice</p>
<p>and how if I talked about cards,</p>
<p>I would have a million, 100 million subscribers,</p>
<p>just all this really kind stuff that in my mind,</p>
<p>I thought was either undeserved</p>
<p>or I just never fathomed that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you certainly should not feel as deserved.</p>
<p>You should have humility about that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I think that is the thing that works over time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like reputation spreads,</p>
<p>which is like, if one person likes you</p>
<p>and they tell you to other people,</p>
<p>and it kind of spreads.</p>
<p>And over time, you have one conversation with a top 10,</p>
<p>like a super grandmaster,</p>
<p>and they say nice things about you.</p>
<p>And it just kind of spreads.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve been very surprised in all walks of life.</p>
<p>This really gets me, this makes me happy, honestly.</p>
<p>Because people ask me how I get guests and so on.</p>
<p>And it just seems, honestly, just be a good person,</p>
<p>and like a real person and honest,</p>
<p>and it just kind of spreads the word, word of mouth.</p>
<p>You know, even coming here, I almost didn&rsquo;t reach out.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>I had seen you, I&rsquo;d never talked to a chess person,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve watched a lot of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched some of the things start to finish,</p>
<p>especially if the guest I&rsquo;m really interested in,</p>
<p>like George St. Pierre, I&rsquo;ll watch that guy do whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll watch him do basically anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Make an omelet or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love listening to him.</p>
<p>Some of the other things I&rsquo;ve listened to as well,</p>
<p>and I noticed that neither,</p>
<p>well, to me, you obviously and Joe</p>
<p>are the two biggest podcasters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s like factual.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if some influencer has some podcasts,</p>
<p>but you guys interview folks that I listen to</p>
<p>more often than anybody else.</p>
<p>And when Magnus came on, I was like,</p>
<p>oh, this is, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how I would reach out</p>
<p>to someone like you.</p>
<p>It just seems like a limp, like climbing a mountain.</p>
<p>And then a couple days later,</p>
<p>and I even in that episode wanted to write,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t know how.</p>
<p>I was like, do I make a YouTube comment?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little like I&rsquo;m clout chasing on the Magnus episode.</p>
<p>But then you talked to Bottegas, and I said,</p>
<p>oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t overthink it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I just said, all right, fuck it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just write a comment.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, yeah, I&rsquo;d love to have you on.</p>
<p>I was shocked.</p>
<p>You responded just within a couple hours or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I loved it, man.</p>
<p>I mean, it was an honor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way to connect.</p>
<p>I also like on live streams, I&rsquo;ll watch,</p>
<p>I try to resist commenting,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll watch some even smaller channels.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll get super excited by them</p>
<p>and connect in that way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intimacy to that.</p>
<p>Man, YouTube is beautiful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about Twitch.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s similar.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know anything about Twitch.</p>
<p>But YouTube has-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll ruin you.</p>
<p>There is an intimacy.</p>
<p>Like, especially if it&rsquo;s live.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s live, they&rsquo;re like right there.</p>
<p>You can just like reach out and say hello.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like really, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was just happy to live in this time</p>
<p>when you could connect with people in that way.</p>
<p>There is an intimacy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love podcasts too.</p>
<p>I listen to people and I feel like they&rsquo;re my friend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cool feeling.</p>
<p>It makes you feel less lonely in this world.</p>
<p>Like you have a lifelong companion,</p>
<p>especially like people that do a podcast</p>
<p>for many, many years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, we&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gone through all the ups and downs of life together</p>
<p>with a creator, with a podcast, or with anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It makes it, it&rsquo;s surprisingly intimate,</p>
<p>a one-way friendships.</p>
<p>Maybe for an intro, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some negatives that people</p>
<p>definitely describe.</p>
<p>The word that gets used a lot is parasocial.</p>
<p>You think you, like the viewer will think</p>
<p>that the streamer or the YouTuber knows them</p>
<p>or owes them something or has some,</p>
<p>they have a bigger connection than they do.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what?</p>
<p>Actually, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I have to look.</p>
<p>Maybe you can explain to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this term parasocial a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m meaning to look it up.</p>
<p>Might as well look it up while in live on the podcast.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>Parasocial interaction, PSI refers.</p>
<p>Is this a new term?</p>
<p>Because I have just started listening,</p>
<p>hearing it like the last-</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Year or so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Parasocial interaction, PSI,</p>
<p>refers to a kind of psychological relationship</p>
<p>experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters</p>
<p>with performance in the mass media,</p>
<p>particularly on television and on online platforms.</p>
<p>Viewers or listeners come to consider</p>
<p>media personalities as friends,</p>
<p>despite having no or limited interaction with.</p>
<p>Oh shit, that&rsquo;s a term for a thing I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been referring to.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>The term was coined by Donald Horton and Richard Wall</p>
<p>in 1956.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>When there was like very limited media, huh?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I guess TV and radio and stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Parasocial interaction and exposure</p>
<p>that gamers&rsquo; interest in a persona</p>
<p>become a parasocial relationship</p>
<p>after repeated exposure to the media.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, what&rsquo;s the downside, bro?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, okay.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I can tell you the downside.</p>
<p>The downside is people thinking</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in relationships with streamers</p>
<p>and stalking them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Oh, the stalking part,</p>
<p>but the relationship is like,</p>
<p>I mean, okay, you mean like actual relationship,</p>
<p>like waking up and saying,</p>
<p>how are you doing?</p>
<p>Like in your head to them.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, but that might be an extension.</p>
<p>More like, yeah, getting mad they don&rsquo;t respond to you</p>
<p>in any time you&rsquo;re in the stream</p>
<p>or that convincing yourself the other person wants you</p>
<p>and you need to go to them.</p>
<p>So you need to find where they are.</p>
<p>Like this has happened.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest female streamers have reported</p>
<p>that they get stalked and harassed for months.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s born out of this.</p>
<p>This on a very small scale is</p>
<p>you come into a stream every so often</p>
<p>and give an update about your academic career.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>
<p>I was gonna mention,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve streamed on Twitch for years</p>
<p>and I watched people have kids.</p>
<p>Like people will come in over the course of months</p>
<p>and say, hey man, you know, I just finished,</p>
<p>I just took the bar exam.</p>
<p>Yo man, like I&rsquo;m having my first kid.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But if they do it in a healthy way, that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>But I-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always gonna be downsides,</p>
<p>but most of it is beautiful, man.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I have a very,</p>
<p>I have, I guess,</p>
<p>parasocial relationships of people</p>
<p>that take it a little too far.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all love.</p>
<p>You also have a fundamental belief</p>
<p>and hope in people to be good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been, you know,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t gotten in trouble with it yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing, me too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve interacted with plenty of people in person</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s been negative, so.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve even gone to a war zone.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, there hasn&rsquo;t been,</p>
<p>people have been very,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>People have only surprised me in the positive direction,</p>
<p>in the depth of the capacity they have for compassion.</p>
<p>Do we, okay.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re in this weird place with the cheating.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question about</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s possible to cheat?</p>
<p>Like if you and I,</p>
<p>you know, the conversation you&rsquo;re gonna have with Maggie,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re gonna play chess.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re trying to figure out how can you beat him,</p>
<p>what are the different ways, do you think?</p>
<p>Over-the-board chess, what are the ways to cheat?</p>
<p>Cheating?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I lose the thread,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s what I immediately went to,</p>
<p>is like the engineering challenge of cheating.</p>
<p>Right, well, that&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re good at that.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not good at creating cheating</p>
<p>in over-the-board situations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying your brain works differently.</p>
<p>I just choose to not even,</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t entertain that.</p>
<p>I can come up with some bullshit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not gonna be anywhere close.</p>
<p>Oh, your mind is not like immediately attracted</p>
<p>to pulling at that thread of like,</p>
<p>how would you fuck with the system?</p>
<p>Yeah, my mind stops at,</p>
<p>ha, that would have to be a really sophisticated thing,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go any further.</p>
<p>My brain every day thinks about the best way</p>
<p>to compartmentalize chess into a digestible format</p>
<p>and put it out into content.</p>
<p>Chess on the board.</p>
<p>Chess, not cheating.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just think about YouTube.</p>
<p>I just think about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s currently where my mind is fully focused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also working on like a book, so.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>See, for me, because I&rsquo;ve built chess engines</p>
<p>without understanding chess much,</p>
<p>as like, you know, as anyone does who&rsquo;s interested in AI,</p>
<p>you build all kinds of systems</p>
<p>that do all kinds of stuff,</p>
<p>and chess is just an easy game.</p>
<p>Like it starts with Othello,</p>
<p>goes up to chess and go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a great benchmark,</p>
<p>a great place to explore different AI algorithms</p>
<p>from search to machine learning and so on.</p>
<p>But to me, cheating is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the similar kind of ideas.</p>
<p>Well, if I make it a board instead of eight by eight</p>
<p>to 10 by 10, like how does it change things?</p>
<p>And with cheating,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like expanding the engineering challenge</p>
<p>of chess out into the real world.</p>
<p>To me, okay, so just allow me,</p>
<p>I know cheating is horrible and everything,</p>
<p>but Stockfish, AI engine and human working together</p>
<p>in interesting ways, forget chess,</p>
<p>just machine and human working together</p>
<p>to expand the capability of the human is really fascinating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a beautiful thing to me.</p>
<p>Of course, purely for the chess game, it ruins the game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I just like thinking of how AI can interact</p>
<p>with the human in ways that it&rsquo;s frictionless.</p>
<p>Like neural link brain computer interfaces dream</p>
<p>of directly connecting the human brain to AI system.</p>
<p>The problem in this case is I don&rsquo;t think the human</p>
<p>and the AI are interacting together.</p>
<p>The AI dominates.</p>
<p>The human is just the mechanism that makes the moves.</p>
<p>I actually played, if I may,</p>
<p>maybe I need your advice on this.</p>
<p>I thought, and I told myself I won&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And then a friend of mine said,</p>
<p>and a couple of friends,</p>
<p>and both of them are previous guests in this podcast,</p>
<p>told me I definitely need to do it,</p>
<p>which is, you know, connect.</p>
<p>So I already have, for the chess arm that I built,</p>
<p>this computer vision on the chess board is able</p>
<p>to extract from vision,</p>
<p>the way you do optical character recognition,</p>
<p>extract the board.</p>
<p>So I was gonna just build that cheating system</p>
<p>to demonstrate it with,</p>
<p>the reason I thought it was interesting,</p>
<p>so something we didn&rsquo;t mention is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who started this rumor,</p>
<p>but the rumor started that it might&rsquo;ve been like anal beads</p>
<p>that, I don&rsquo;t know who started this,</p>
<p>but I do know that Elon magnified it.</p>
<p>My username was dead center in that thing</p>
<p>that he retweeted, which was hilarious to me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using, what do you mean?</p>
<p>He retweeted the clip, but also the copy pasta,</p>
<p>like the paragraph that was like describing</p>
<p>the whole anal beads theory,</p>
<p>and dead center in the middle of that paragraph is,</p>
<p>as Gotham chess says.</p>
<p>And the worst part about it was I was literally tagged.</p>
<p>So it was as user slash Gotham chess says.</p>
<p>So every time that paragraph gets posted on Reddit,</p>
<p>I get tagged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting posted a lot.</p>
<p>So yes, but yes, he tweeted.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also the funny thing,</p>
<p>which I really love.</p>
<p>The weirdest, most entertaining thing.</p>
<p>Was that part of the same thing where,</p>
<p>like a plot twist,</p>
<p>Magnus has been using anal beads this whole time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how he got.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Oh, I love that so much.</p>
<p>Okay, but anyway, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I quickly realized that there is,</p>
<p>I have to admit that I know not much about sex toys.</p>
<p>And then I quickly realized that there&rsquo;s a lot of sex toys</p>
<p>that have Bluetooth capability that you can interact with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to connect stock fish to sex toys.</p>
<p>Actually, wow.</p>
<p>Actually, yes.</p>
<p>So apparently that&rsquo;s a popular thing.</p>
<p>Like a lot of sex toys are Bluetooth enabled</p>
<p>so you can communicate with them.</p>
<p>So this is actually pretty trivial to do.</p>
<p>Not trivial, but then,</p>
<p>and then in fact, there is a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several libraries.</p>
<p>One of them is really active called,</p>
<p>now this is on GitHub, friends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in Rust, but I think there&rsquo;s Python wrappers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Buttplug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the name of the library.</p>
<p>That communicates with,</p>
<p>it supports a bunch of different devices,</p>
<p>a bunch of different like vibrators</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But then I looked at the kind of vibrators it supports</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all like creepy looking.</p>
<p>I mean, like it doesn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it felt too dirty, you know?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a line, I was like,</p>
<p>ah, is this not gonna,</p>
<p>because the reason I like that kind of stuff</p>
<p>is I like the joke of it</p>
<p>that ultimately is somehow educational.</p>
<p>Because to me, I really care about AI</p>
<p>and this is a cool little project to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super easy to share.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I was thinking about doing it.</p>
<p>I was thinking about doing it.</p>
<p>At first I said, no, it&rsquo;s just kind of feels dirty.</p>
<p>But then the aforementioned friend said,</p>
<p>no, you should definitely do it.</p>
<p>I like the huge,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s your test subject?</p>
<p>No, we wouldn&rsquo;t test,</p>
<p>you should, I&rsquo;m the, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that people would sign up, right?</p>
<p>I just meant on the table,</p>
<p>like show the vibration,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re basically converting.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;m not obviously a grandmaster,</p>
<p>so you have to say everything.</p>
<p>I feel like-</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You could say the square.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to say the piece.</p>
<p>The human will fill in the gap.</p>
<p>No, a good human chess player.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point I wanted to make is like,</p>
<p>for me, I would like to know</p>
<p>the actual move I need to make.</p>
<p>So I need the full information.</p>
<p>So I have to convert the Bishop C5,</p>
<p>whatever, to Morse code,</p>
<p>which is a lot of vibration.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>But it still works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious and fun.</p>
<p>So I was thinking about doing it,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s pretty easy to do.</p>
<p>It would be just like a fun exercise.</p>
<p>I love a mix of technical rigor and humor.</p>
<p>Well, this is the perfect project for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, this was born, I think,</p>
<p>out of a user comment in a Twitch stream.</p>
<p>So I thought it was born on Reddit, this theory,</p>
<p>but I think Eric Hansen was streaming Chessbrah,</p>
<p>and someone in his chat made that joke</p>
<p>and he read it out loud.</p>
<p>That was the first time it was read out loud.</p>
<p>And then somebody clipped it</p>
<p>and it became international news.</p>
<p>Have you followed how big the traction got</p>
<p>on this anal beads thing?</p>
<p>It was covered by every major news network,</p>
<p>late night talk show, Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert.</p>
<p>International news.</p>
<p>International news in countries like China,</p>
<p>where I would have never thought</p>
<p>that they would report about anal beads.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did they, what was the tonality of it?</p>
<p>Was it seen as a joke?</p>
<p>Or did they say there&rsquo;s a cheating scandal?</p>
<p>I think-</p>
<p>How do you even mention anal beads?</p>
<p>Literally anal beads.</p>
<p>Like just-</p>
<p>Just saying, just-</p>
<p>Accused?</p>
<p>Accused denies cheating with anal beads,</p>
<p>which he never did.</p>
<p>He never denied cheating with anal beads.</p>
<p>It was a joke internet theory.</p>
<p>If I was him, I would lean into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t imagine, man.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what the right thing</p>
<p>for him to do is, but it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not touching this one?</p>
<p>The anal beads?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say the words anal beads in my YouTube videos,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll say beads.</p>
<p>Yeah, you don&rsquo;t say anal beads.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll, the thing is-</p>
<p>Do you think I should do the code thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good tutorial.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>I think it would be hilarious.</p>
<p>If you find a way to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can show that it is possible</p>
<p>to theoretically vibrate via Bluetooth chess moves.</p>
<p>And if someone shoves it up their ass,</p>
<p>it was another joke.</p>
<p>Okay, they offered you to play naked.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna make you spread your cheeks?</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t understand why naked solved the problem.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be naked.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think naked is enough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, some questions from Reddit.</p>
<p>Ask him, ask Levy if he deep down hates his audience.</p>
<p>I saw that, yeah, I saw that was the one.</p>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship with the chess subreddit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why some of those questions</p>
<p>were gonna be tough.</p>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship-</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s a tough question</p>
<p>or does that come from a place of love?</p>
<p>Ah, very tough to say, very tough to say.</p>
<p>Is love and hate, like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically next door neighbors on Reddit,</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I feel like they oscillate very quickly between each other.</p>
<p>Yes, so Reddit chess specifically I think is</p>
<p>mostly folks who are around before the chess boom.</p>
<p>So the chess-</p>
<p>This is the chess subreddit?</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So a lot of them have been around for five years,</p>
<p>seven years, 10 years, even more.</p>
<p>And I think the average age on Reddit</p>
<p>is lower than the average age on the chess subreddit.</p>
<p>I think that the chess subreddit is beyond the age of 20,</p>
<p>maybe even 25.</p>
<p>Like a lot of folks there are-</p>
<p>Oh, ancient, ancient people in their mid-20s.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, not 15 or 16.</p>
<p>Anarchy Chess is younger.</p>
<p>So Anarchy Chess is basically chess memes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a subreddit name?</p>
<p>Yes, you got it, yeah.</p>
<p>Anarchy Chess, this is great.</p>
<p>A lot of stupid memes on there.</p>
<p>Do they like you or no?</p>
<p>Or is it love-hate?</p>
<p>They did until my crypto sponsorship.</p>
<p>Which is a separate convo that I&rsquo;m more than happy to have.</p>
<p>But yeah, so my relationship with the Reddit chess subreddit</p>
<p>is tough because my content on YouTube</p>
<p>stops at a certain point with them.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t learn from me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m tailoring to 95% of my audience,</p>
<p>which is about 1,600, 1,700 and below.</p>
<p>And I have a lot of content</p>
<p>where I jokingly make fun of low-rated players.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s in on it, and we all have fun.</p>
<p>And I laugh at myself a ton.</p>
<p>Laugh at, as you can even see in this conversation.</p>
<p>But just like you mentioned with clips</p>
<p>and out-of-context things,</p>
<p>folks have already formed a perception of my personality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I can do to win them back.</p>
<p>And I think the dominant percentage</p>
<p>of the loudest group of folks on the chess subreddit,</p>
<p>they just, they have a certain perception of me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to change.</p>
<p>And you add something like cryptocurrency sponsorship,</p>
<p>which people on Reddit just in general</p>
<p>are relatively negative on the subject,</p>
<p>is gonna start snowballing more and more.</p>
<p>So if you ever look up a thread of,</p>
<p>should I buy a Gotham course, and it&rsquo;s on Reddit chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna say no.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s calling it a scam, overpriced.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I heard a lot of really positive stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where, on Reddit in general.</p>
<p>About me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You might&rsquo;ve been looking for it.</p>
<p>You might&rsquo;ve not been looking for negative things.</p>
<p>And I do-</p>
<p>So I was looking for like best educators online,</p>
<p>like that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, it might&rsquo;ve not been Reddit chess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be totally honest with you.</p>
<p>If you ever go there and look for something like</p>
<p>best recaps or best educational content for intermediates,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not mentioned.</p>
<p>I might not be mentioned</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m already expected to be on the list.</p>
<p>So they just kind of want to generally shout out</p>
<p>smaller creators, totally fine with that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even going on this whole explanation</p>
<p>because I want to win folks back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sort of the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>A lot of my stuff is really clickbaity</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m playing the YouTube game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>Do you feel like a limit or a tension between</p>
<p>your creativity and the YouTube algorithm?</p>
<p>Like, do you feel like it has negative effects on you?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I want to cover more in-depth stuff in a 30 minute video</p>
<p>that I think is super useful to people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only going to get 60,000 views.</p>
<p>And you feel, why is that a bad thing?</p>
<p>Is it good to mix it up?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s good to mix it up, but I make a video a day.</p>
<p>I make one bad video.</p>
<p>The other videos suffer.</p>
<p>And then if I make two videos that underperform,</p>
<p>the rest of the videos don&rsquo;t get pushed out as much.</p>
<p>Your earnings can go down 40% day to day,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t happen in other careers.</p>
<p>And if I ever want to supplement,</p>
<p>if I ever want to make a very instructional video,</p>
<p>I try to do it in a very fun way.</p>
<p>So something like eight of Magnus Carlsen&rsquo;s best end games.</p>
<p>You can still learn a ton,</p>
<p>but the concept of the video is going to be different.</p>
<p>Like I try to still teach things,</p>
<p>but in more interesting and exciting ways.</p>
<p>Like the guy who was scammed for a million dollars,</p>
<p>Alexey Shirov, who was basically promised</p>
<p>the world championship.</p>
<p>If he won his match, he won his match.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t get a world championship.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s still stuff in there you can learn.</p>
<p>And you can, my goal is just you click on the video,</p>
<p>you learn something and you enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Get people to click on it by any means necessary.</p>
<p>But once they&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>have quality stuff they can learn.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, I wish.</p>
<p>So I have zero of those pressures,</p>
<p>but I also really, really,</p>
<p>like I turn off views and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pay attention to any of that.</p>
<p>But I wish YouTube would like,</p>
<p>the algorithm would include how good the video is.</p>
<p>Like beneficial for people&rsquo;s long-term wellbeing</p>
<p>in the calculation.</p>
<p>I actually really hate the fact</p>
<p>that they turned off dislikes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t get that at all.</p>
<p>Because like now I don&rsquo;t know the difference between like,</p>
<p>for tutorials specifically,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s a good chess video or not,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s a good review or not.</p>
<p>I mean, it emphasizes following certain people more</p>
<p>than like if you trust the creator,</p>
<p>but like, man, I really don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a good video or not, essentially.</p>
<p>And then you have to trust more the title.</p>
<p>Then the click baitiness comes in</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s no good.</p>
<p>You have to use your own gut instinct as opposed to data.</p>
<p>It sucks.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s videos that have almost no views</p>
<p>that are still great.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And some of the best ones,</p>
<p>some people who are just focused on like the quality</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t wanna play the game</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t even know how to play it</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really wanna play the game</p>
<p>of the YouTube algorithm.</p>
<p>Yeah, it sucks.</p>
<p>It sucks, especially given how dominant YouTube is</p>
<p>in defining the sort of the creative energy</p>
<p>of our whole civilization of the youth.</p>
<p>Not just chess.</p>
<p>Not just chess.</p>
<p>When are you going to Chessbox against Eric Rosen?</p>
<p>This is a question from Reddit.</p>
<p>Chessbox, you said your hands are all messed up.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Are you training for something or regular like?</p>
<p>So, I also just remembered we never talked about Hikaru,</p>
<p>so I can talk about Rosen and Hikaru</p>
<p>in the same chess boxing.</p>
<p>Oh shit, all right.</p>
<p>Is this your McGregor like shit talk segment?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Eric Rosen is actually a close friend of mine.</p>
<p>I probably have five of those</p>
<p>and he just so happens to be not just a chess streamer,</p>
<p>but we talked about buying homes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about, he&rsquo;s stayed at my place.</p>
<p>He took my wedding photos.</p>
<p>I flew him to New York and paid for all his stuff</p>
<p>just so he could hang out with my wife and I</p>
<p>and take some 6 a.m. photos in the sun in the park.</p>
<p>Oh, he looks familiar.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he&rsquo;s a good friend of mine.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of chess boxing,</p>
<p>chess boxing is this really fascinating sport</p>
<p>where you have boxing, but you also have chess</p>
<p>and you have rounds.</p>
<p>So, you start a chess game with a clock.</p>
<p>That segment itself lasts for a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>They put the board away and pause the clock,</p>
<p>whatever the time situation is,</p>
<p>then you box for a minute and that keeps going on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it works in terms of the time expiring,</p>
<p>meaning in fighting, there&rsquo;s judges</p>
<p>that just tell you how the fight was going, right?</p>
<p>Here, I don&rsquo;t know who wins and how.</p>
<p>Like, do you win by, you can win by knockout,</p>
<p>you can win by checkmate,</p>
<p>or their clock can run out on the chess board,</p>
<p>but is there-</p>
<p>Who judges?</p>
<p>Is there a round limit?</p>
<p>Does this just go on and on and on and on?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought it&rsquo;s like 12 rounds, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this a thing in Russia?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big thing in the UK.</p>
<p>UK?</p>
<p>Yeah, UK, I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of YouTuber events just for boxing.</p>
<p>So, YouTubers just learn to box</p>
<p>and then they just box, no chess.</p>
<p>They just straight up box each other.</p>
<p>Like Jake Paul, for example.</p>
<p>You ever gonna get Jake Paul in here?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>I feel like so many different guests have been mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah, Jake Paul would be a fun guest,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s obviously the biggest scammer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s legitimately boxing people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not, yeah.</p>
<p>But chess players is never gonna learn to box to that level.</p>
<p>And all of us are starting basically from zero.</p>
<p>And Ludwig talked to me behind the scenes,</p>
<p>say, hey, how would you feel</p>
<p>about being in a chess boxing match?</p>
<p>I said, okay, yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>When is it gonna be?</p>
<p>He said, five months from now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to train combat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve weight lifted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done cardio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played basketball.</p>
<p>And you said you&rsquo;re a UFC fan too?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you admire fighting?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would enjoy it.</p>
<p>I just have a really bad lower back</p>
<p>and that makes a lot of different combat difficult.</p>
<p>But I said, you know what, screw this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to contact a few local gyms.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And one of them, the guy emailing me back and forth</p>
<p>had actually watched my YouTube videos.</p>
<p>So, he was the first to respond.</p>
<p>And he said, yeah, like come in, do a couple of classes,</p>
<p>like see how you feel.</p>
<p>So, first I did conditioning, which killed me</p>
<p>because fighting conditioning, as you know, it kills you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely different type of conditioning.</p>
<p>But I felt good and I really wanted to come back.</p>
<p>And since July, I&rsquo;ve been training three, four days a week.</p>
<p>Nice, you feel pretty good?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Lower back feels good?</p>
<p>Lower back, everything feels good.</p>
<p>The whole body got stronger.</p>
<p>So, what you&rsquo;re saying is you&rsquo;re going to fuck up at Kara.</p>
<p>Is he training?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fighting.</p>
<p>So, I talked to Eric about it.</p>
<p>And the truth is we&rsquo;re both concerned about head trauma.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually sparred.</p>
<p>I like sparring, shadow boxing, but I go there,</p>
<p>I do personal training.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do a group class.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fighting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fighting the bag.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing shadow boxing.</p>
<p>My form is improving, but I haven&rsquo;t been punched.</p>
<p>I get hit in the stomach.</p>
<p>I get hit in the side with kicks.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s punched me in the face yet.</p>
<p>So, I think we both were adequately concerned about that.</p>
<p>And there was not some ridiculous amount</p>
<p>of money on the table.</p>
<p>So, we decided it&rsquo;s just not worth pursuing.</p>
<p>How does Hikaru come into the picture?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s a possible competitor.</p>
<p>People ask me all the time, who would you fight?</p>
<p>People are like, Andrea Botez with Kick Your Ass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough one because I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>what am I going to say?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fight a woman who I&rsquo;m larger than</p>
<p>so, I just have to take the L against</p>
<p>anytime a woman is mentioned.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, and six.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no winning that one.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve lost to both Botezes, Anna Rudolph,</p>
<p>Anna Kremling.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all chess creators.</p>
<p>And like, hypothetically?</p>
<p>Yeah, I get that.</p>
<p>In this hypothetical fight?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been training.</p>
<p>I think Andrea has been training.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because an event got announced.</p>
<p>This event that I was hypothetically</p>
<p>going to be the main event against Eric Rosen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was announced.</p>
<p>That got announced?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I thought, like, maybe let&rsquo;s not do this.</p>
<p>No, I knew once I declined to fight Eric</p>
<p>that I would not be participating.</p>
<p>And I even knew, do you know?</p>
<p>I knew who was going to be the main event.</p>
<p>Because I was kind of offered both of those guys.</p>
<p>So, Amon Hambleton.</p>
<p>Oh, is this still going on?</p>
<p>The chess boxing event will happen</p>
<p>in December in Los Angeles, yeah.</p>
<p>Nice, so who is the main event?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Amon Hambleton, who&rsquo;s also Chessbrah.</p>
<p>So, they have a couple of guys</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of the Chessbrah channel.</p>
<p>And Lawrence Trent.</p>
<p>Lawrence Trent is a international master from England.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a, I think he&rsquo;s done some boxing, a little bit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a commentator.</p>
<p>Brash guy.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Controversial guy, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because they started,</p>
<p>Lawrence put out some videos, and I went,</p>
<p>damn, I should have done this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it.</p>
<p>But, I mean, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s so many things to say.</p>
<p>One of which is, if you want to take it seriously,</p>
<p>you know, it does pull you in.</p>
<p>If you train a lot, it&rsquo;s gonna affect</p>
<p>the rest of your life, and then there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it changes you, I think.</p>
<p>Taking combat sports seriously changes you, in good,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s negative costs to it, I think.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a whole nother thing, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like doing marathon running or something.</p>
<p>It really pulls you in.</p>
<p>And the other thing is the head trauma.</p>
<p>Like, you have to take that kind of stuff seriously,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re doing sparring</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Still, some of the celebrities,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but it&rsquo;s pretty exciting, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;d be fun to watch Ikara.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>Well, I always said, if Ikara and Magnus</p>
<p>did a boxing event, and I was the co-main event</p>
<p>against, I don&rsquo;t know who, that would be, that&rsquo;d be.</p>
<p>Has Magnus said anything about it?</p>
<p>Like, about doing chess boxing?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, he&rsquo;s gonna commentate</p>
<p>the Ludwig event.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Which he said, and he kind of said,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s been people in the past</p>
<p>that are my level in chess, not mine,</p>
<p>his level in chess, and have wanted</p>
<p>to get physical with him.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s talking about Ikara.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody else is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a good one, man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a good one.</p>
<p>I think Magnus-</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Who is that one?</p>
<p>I think Magnus is in better physical shape.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a little bit bigger, I think, than Ikara.</p>
<p>Longer reach.</p>
<p>I think Ikara&rsquo;s a dog, though.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;ll, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gonna get out of that.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gonna quit in the ring.</p>
<p>I would think Ikara would just go nuts in the beginning</p>
<p>and burns himself out.</p>
<p>So if Magnus can survive that,</p>
<p>I feel like Ikara would just go crazy</p>
<p>and then just get exhausted,</p>
<p>would not be able to pace himself correctly.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Chasing that first round knockout.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just swing like crazy.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;d just love to see that,</p>
<p>which is like the effect of physical exertion on the game.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re strong enough to-</p>
<p>Yes, but I think we definitely underestimate</p>
<p>the effect of being punched,</p>
<p>maybe bleeding out of your nose or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no joke.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m anticipating the first day</p>
<p>I actually do some sparring and get seriously hit</p>
<p>because I know it&rsquo;s not gonna feel good.</p>
<p>Even now, I take a hard jab to the stomach or the ribs</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just like, man, this is rough.</p>
<p>I mean, I had to do three minutes on heavy bag</p>
<p>and when I finished,</p>
<p>I had been like slacking on my form</p>
<p>because my arms were tired</p>
<p>and I hit with my fingers instead of my knuckles</p>
<p>and my hands are like, you can see the red skin,</p>
<p>like completely pink, meaty skin under.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize when I was hitting</p>
<p>and only today, the pain is unbearable.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>Head, this must be-</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, your skin gets tougher,</p>
<p>everything gets tougher, so you get used to it.</p>
<p>The head is a weird one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not gonna send you those kinds of signals.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get the skin type of signals.</p>
<p>The brain is a weird thing because it doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It just does the damage</p>
<p>and the damage can materialize itself,</p>
<p>manifest itself only years later.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s a weird one.</p>
<p>But then we all die.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that brave heart speech.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you about bots</p>
<p>because to me, it&rsquo;s super interesting</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve played a lot of bots at different levels.</p>
<p>You have a video called</p>
<p>The Advanced Chess Bots Are Terrifying.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between playing humans and bots?</p>
<p>Like you mentioned this Nelson bot</p>
<p>that brings his queen out, I think rated 1,600?</p>
<p>1,200 or 1,400.</p>
<p>Okay, 1,200, 1,400.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a style to those.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between the way bots play</p>
<p>and the way humans play?</p>
<p>A lot of people prefer playing bots</p>
<p>because they have anxiety playing other humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very legitimate thing.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>A lot of beginners, they don&rsquo;t like live chess.</p>
<p>They get nervous, you know, anxiety.</p>
<p>You get close to your highest ever rating, you panic.</p>
<p>Happens to me too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Happens to me even now.</p>
<p>So they play bots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re somehow more reliable or something?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a big thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big thing.</p>
<p>And the popularity of that video shows</p>
<p>that people enjoy watching you play chess bots.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna demystify this.</p>
<p>This might be shocking.</p>
<p>Those bots are all the same bot for the most part.</p>
<p>You could just program a bot</p>
<p>to make mistakes at a certain moment.</p>
<p>You could program a bot to spend less time on certain moves.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gotten sophisticated enough</p>
<p>that you can basically program it to play</p>
<p>at whatever more or less level that a human plays at.</p>
<p>You say, I&rsquo;ll play it at 1,800 level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s programmed to throw in mistakes.</p>
<p>The problem is,</p>
<p>and this is why it&rsquo;s all beginners to not play bots,</p>
<p>because bots are programmed in the following way.</p>
<p>Beginner bots are like literal toddlers.</p>
<p>They have no understanding whatsoever.</p>
<p>They will literally lose all their pieces,</p>
<p>but they won&rsquo;t lose all their pieces</p>
<p>and make mistakes the way beginners do.</p>
<p>Beginners actually know how to start a game.</p>
<p>They just struggle the first eight moves, nine moves.</p>
<p>Their mistakes are very different than bot.</p>
<p>Bot plays completely outlandish types of mistakes</p>
<p>that you cannot pick up in terms of a pattern standpoint,</p>
<p>because no actual humans play like that.</p>
<p>They just move their queen to the opposite side of the board.</p>
<p>If for no reason, you can take it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not even a blunder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like randomness.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s completely random.</p>
<p>And this problem extends further</p>
<p>because advanced bots will play an opening</p>
<p>completely reasonably, and they just hang a rook,</p>
<p>which, okay, maybe happens,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not exactly how you get to 1,800.</p>
<p>At 1,800, that&rsquo;s a very strong level of the game.</p>
<p>You know your openings very well.</p>
<p>You start navigating the middle game</p>
<p>based on already things that you remember.</p>
<p>And then basically one side chooses a bad plan,</p>
<p>and the other side chooses a better plan,</p>
<p>and one thing leads to another.</p>
<p>Nobody just recreationally hangs all their pieces,</p>
<p>which is the way bots are kind of programmed to play.</p>
<p>But some of those bots in that video were,</p>
<p>I remember playing them, and they were, yeah, they were nuts.</p>
<p>They were out calculating me</p>
<p>every time I thought I had a trick</p>
<p>in two, three-second moment of thought.</p>
<p>It would just play the best move.</p>
<p>And sometimes that also happens.</p>
<p>It gets into a dead loop</p>
<p>where it just starts bulldozing you, and it can&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>So it made its mistakes already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s programmed to make only a few,</p>
<p>and then it just bulldozes you the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why I played with Stockfish a bunch.</p>
<p>So I got,</p>
<p>I built for myself</p>
<p>a bunch of different chess experiments recently.</p>
<p>It had to do with the chess-playing bot,</p>
<p>but I also built an infinite chess board</p>
<p>where Stockfish was playing</p>
<p>like an infinite number of chess games.</p>
<p>And one of the parameters that was interesting to play with</p>
<p>is how long it gets to think about a move</p>
<p>and how that affects the rating of the thing.</p>
<p>Oh, I did that a little bit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a tricky one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure people know how to do that well,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not trivial to understand what,</p>
<p>there must be a good formula for it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also interesting to think about</p>
<p>like a controlled number of blunders.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s probably better,</p>
<p>the controlled number of blunders</p>
<p>is not a good way to build a bot.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>For training purposes, at least.</p>
<p>The time per move is probably better,</p>
<p>but the craziest thing is I did that.</p>
<p>A couple of my devs were helping me with the build,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scaling my courses</p>
<p>into a better chess learning platform, essentially.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a lot of different experiments with Stockfish,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m even happy to get into here.</p>
<p>And Stockfish making moves in 0.1 millisecond</p>
<p>plays better than a human, which is disgusting</p>
<p>and disturbing, frankly, because that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t react to a car stopping in front of you</p>
<p>anywhere near that fast.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the reason I was interested in that</p>
<p>is because when you have a very large chess board,</p>
<p>you have tens of thousands,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of game going on at the same time.</p>
<p>You have to like think of the minimum amount</p>
<p>of thinking per move that you can allow for.</p>
<p>And it does seem, it&rsquo;s damn good,</p>
<p>at least to my eye, basically,</p>
<p>at the lowest possible setting you can give it.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible what bots are able to do.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s, as far as I know,</p>
<p>is primarily machine learning based, Stockfish.</p>
<p>So Stockfish moved to machine learning completely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not doing search, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is where you lose me a bit,</p>
<p>but the move discovery and evaluation</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s been changing in the way Stockfish works.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s discovering of moves</p>
<p>and then the way it looks forward</p>
<p>and then evaluates positions, that has changed.</p>
<p>But Matthew Sadler, who wrote the book Game Changer</p>
<p>about AlphaZero, he explains it significantly better.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the way I think it works.</p>
<p>What did that make you feel</p>
<p>when you first saw AlphaZero play?</p>
<p>I was excited.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any sort of existential thoughts.</p>
<p>I enjoyed watching it completely destroy openings</p>
<p>that people thought were good.</p>
<p>And that experiment, though, does have some caveat</p>
<p>in the sense that I think AlphaZero was playing</p>
<p>with a full tank of servers and I think Stockfish wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>which I think is one of the things people point out.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t playing-</p>
<p>Since then, they were able to demonstrate much less.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But also, AlphaZero stopped developing.</p>
<p>They stopped developing it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which sucks, but again, from their perspective,</p>
<p>from DeepMind&rsquo;s perspective, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>all right, well, we took on this really tricky game,</p>
<p>did something honestly incredible.</p>
<p>They won.</p>
<p>They won.</p>
<p>Well, not just won.</p>
<p>I mean, they did it without any human supervision.</p>
<p>So without any training on human expert games.</p>
<p>So only through self-play, which,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what learning is about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s what you think of as a child,</p>
<p>a human child, a toddler, learning from somewhat nothing</p>
<p>and becoming a capable human.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we think of when we think about intelligence.</p>
<p>So the fact that it&rsquo;s able to play itself</p>
<p>and become the best player in the world at the game of Go</p>
<p>and all kinds of games, it&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>And obviously that inspired the modern Stockfish</p>
<p>to do all the same kind of self-play methods.</p>
<p>Somebody on Reddit asked a pretty interesting question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have an interesting answer to it.</p>
<p>What makes a chess move, quote unquote, human?</p>
<p>As you are someone, oh, this is to me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mentioning you in third person.</p>
<p>As you are someone working in AI,</p>
<p>this idea of humanness would seem incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>Yes, sir, it is.</p>
<p>Especially since most cheat detection relies on humanness</p>
<p>as a way to detect cheaters.</p>
<p>I think since children being born right now</p>
<p>will have the advantage of engine training their whole life,</p>
<p>they will start to see the game the way an engine does.</p>
<p>Will a person be considered a cheater</p>
<p>if they play like an engine?</p>
<p>There also seemed to be a discrepancy,</p>
<p>especially with Levy, about who can play</p>
<p>what appears to be a non-human move.</p>
<p>He often says things like, quote,</p>
<p>if you were a normal player, normal in quotes,</p>
<p>if you were a normal player,</p>
<p>I would think you were cheating.</p>
<p>But since it&rsquo;s Magnus, I don&rsquo;t doubt Magnus is great,</p>
<p>but if humanness is our benchmark,</p>
<p>what is the ELO rating where your moves</p>
<p>can start to look like an engine without critique?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of questions in there.</p>
<p>They combine two of my quotes into one.</p>
<p>So one thing that I like to say is,</p>
<p>sometimes in a chess game, moves look,</p>
<p>or an opening looks so ridiculous</p>
<p>that if a viewer played it,</p>
<p>I would make fun of them or slap them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the drill.</p>
<p>If I was your chess coach, I&rsquo;d smack you.</p>
<p>But when Magnus plays it, oh, wow,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>So they mix up this quote with another quote,</p>
<p>which is, you know, if I,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ll be explaining something and I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>oh, and here the engine says you should play like this.</p>
<p>If one of your opponents plays like this,</p>
<p>report them for cheating.</p>
<p>So they fuse two quotes.</p>
<p>They said, oh, human can&rsquo;t play like that,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s an engine move,</p>
<p>but because Magnus is playing.</p>
<p>So they mixed kind of two things.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s interesting levels of humor</p>
<p>and insight there on both of those.</p>
<p>Yeah, the difference between human move and engine,</p>
<p>and like what an engine move is,</p>
<p>is I think two things.</p>
<p>Number one, a computer move is outlandish</p>
<p>in its concept and its idea.</p>
<p>So the best example that I can give of that</p>
<p>is if you gave a hundred grandmasters a position</p>
<p>and told them, you know,</p>
<p>what do you think the best move here is for black?</p>
<p>Not in this position right here, we have nothing,</p>
<p>but an overwhelming amount of them</p>
<p>would look at the position,</p>
<p>evaluate everything they know about the game of chess,</p>
<p>which is relatively similar,</p>
<p>but obviously slightly imbalanced</p>
<p>based on their skill level.</p>
<p>And they would come up with a sample size</p>
<p>of two or three moves.</p>
<p>And in comes the computer with a fucking haymaker,</p>
<p>and suddenly everybody goes,</p>
<p>oh, everything we know about chess has gone out the window.</p>
<p>So they all start looking at that move</p>
<p>and they know it&rsquo;s the best move.</p>
<p>So now they start adding the evidence behind the verdict,</p>
<p>as opposed to getting to the verdict</p>
<p>while first looking at the evidence.</p>
<p>So the concept of it and the idea of it</p>
<p>is so outlandish based on a certain type of position</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t fully grasp it.</p>
<p>You have to continue to beg the engine</p>
<p>to tell you what the variation is.</p>
<p>A move is only good if its extension is good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way chess works.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a move is good,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because the computer has seen</p>
<p>that the various branches of things going forward</p>
<p>are also good, so you bring all that back.</p>
<p>And no human could have even conceptualized</p>
<p>that initial thing.</p>
<p>But the second thing about computer moves</p>
<p>is they look counterintuitive.</p>
<p>So if you might be in a position</p>
<p>where it looks like the demands of the position are A, B, C,</p>
<p>and then the computer is like, nope, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen the future</p>
<p>way more than you possibly could have,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have emotions.</p>
<p>So like dumb moves and brilliant moves can look similar.</p>
<p>Yes, and oftentimes do.</p>
<p>And this is actually back to the Hans thing.</p>
<p>A lot of people now dissecting these games they&rsquo;re playing,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re basically saying,</p>
<p>like even Fabiano Caruana,</p>
<p>one of the best players in the world,</p>
<p>was on his podcast yesterday basically saying,</p>
<p>okay, this is beyond my level.</p>
<p>Saying it&rsquo;s out of my league.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s out of your league?</p>
<p>You played for the world championship.</p>
<p>We can read between the lines, right?</p>
<p>Is it possible that Hans is that level of genius?</p>
<p>Is there like different kinds of genius</p>
<p>like where one, you could be out of each other&rsquo;s league</p>
<p>kind of thing?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>In the case of Magnus, it&rsquo;s understanding of end games.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just somehow he understands that last phase of the game</p>
<p>and the complexities and the problems he can pose</p>
<p>better than anybody else.</p>
<p>So you can see Magnus do poor looking moves in the end game.</p>
<p>Or-</p>
<p>Like moves that don&rsquo;t fit what your gut says</p>
<p>would be the optimal.</p>
<p>Yes, but also, so it&rsquo;s not that you even think they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You just might not even consider them</p>
<p>because of over-reliance on your own information</p>
<p>or even the computer.</p>
<p>That was what was going on in game six.</p>
<p>Just kept doing things and kept playing</p>
<p>and kept finding play and posing those questions</p>
<p>that humans and computers could not understand.</p>
<p>So he beat the engine basically.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t have beaten the engine</p>
<p>because they would have defended.</p>
<p>Jan lost that game in the 90s move psychologically.</p>
<p>He thought the game was over.</p>
<p>So that contributed.</p>
<p>Computer would have defended.</p>
<p>So by the time this podcast comes out,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know, it would be in a week</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I feel like more will happen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, you&rsquo;re predicting.</p>
<p>How does this Hans drama end saga?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look in three months.</p>
<p>By the time we get to the next world championship,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, what are the options?</p>
<p>What are the possible, let&rsquo;s imagine,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not say what the probabilities are.</p>
<p>What are the options?</p>
<p>Chess.com is forced to or agrees to or whatever</p>
<p>to come up with a huge amount of evidence</p>
<p>of cheating in the past.</p>
<p>Or Hans comes out, what can Hans do with this?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the general,</p>
<p>Nick, you could maybe update me on this,</p>
<p>but there was a little bit of an attack on him,</p>
<p>a lot of an attack that he&rsquo;s a cheater, right?</p>
<p>Without evidence, without clear conclusive evidence.</p>
<p>Physical evidence.</p>
<p>Physical evidence.</p>
<p>So all of those.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s the tricky thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like that stuff we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is beyond my level.</p>
<p>That starts being kind of intuitive,</p>
<p>circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the statistical evidence</p>
<p>behind the over-the-board games</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s played in 2020, 2021,</p>
<p>where the games match what&rsquo;s called engine correlation</p>
<p>more than Magnus and many other top grandmasters combined.</p>
<p>But that can be argued is because he was very strong</p>
<p>in playing weaker opposition.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always kind of this argument</p>
<p>against statistics, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the fact that the guy who Magnus named dropped,</p>
<p>Maxim Blugi.</p>
<p>Blugi is a chess grandmaster,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s even been, I think,</p>
<p>president of the US Chess Federation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played him in some Blitz games.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even fully aware of the extent of this.</p>
<p>He has been banned from chess.com.</p>
<p>For cheating.</p>
<p>For cheating.</p>
<p>Have they actually,</p>
<p>has him and Hans actually worked together?</p>
<p>Yes, so that was why he named dropped that, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also not good.</p>
<p>You see where this is getting,</p>
<p>you still don&rsquo;t have the physical proof,</p>
<p>but you have smoke.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how this ends.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this,</p>
<p>if he denies it to the death</p>
<p>and he ends up filing some sort of legal action,</p>
<p>some sort of ethics complaint,</p>
<p>or he admits everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Boy, well, no matter what,</p>
<p>I hope, despite chess or not,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s mentally strong enough for whatever is to come.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I keep saying, because I can&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been under fire, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t imagine, right?</p>
<p>Like, I just, I really can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>And maybe, well, we just have too much compassion,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I really just feel like,</p>
<p>at the end of the day, chess is just a game,</p>
<p>but it is a game played by millions of people</p>
<p>throughout history,</p>
<p>and nations have basically fought wars over the chessboard.</p>
<p>So, like, there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Olympics.</p>
<p>Olympics is just a little,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s just a dude running and so on.</p>
<p>The hockey is just a thing with a puck.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s also much more than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also nations</p>
<p>sort of figuring out their conflict</p>
<p>in a way that doesn&rsquo;t involve violence.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a serious thing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a thing that inspires millions of people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a testing ground for intelligent systems</p>
<p>that eventually take over human civilization.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the bots are really interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s other lessons.</p>
<p>Like, you played a clone of yourself.</p>
<p>Nah, it was-</p>
<p>You watched Stockfish vs. Stockfish.</p>
<p>You have a video.</p>
<p>People should check out your channel.</p>
<p>You have a lot of awesome videos.</p>
<p>You have a video titled Stockfish vs. Stockfish.</p>
<p>That was the experiment.</p>
<p>I made them play each other.</p>
<p>So, I made them play-</p>
<p>What did you learn from that experiment?</p>
<p>I enjoyed, first of all, they will always make a draw.</p>
<p>So, engines don&rsquo;t get to play each other</p>
<p>from a beginning position,</p>
<p>because they will always draw,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re the same engine.</p>
<p>So, Stockfish 15, Stockfish 15,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think one side will ever beat the other, basically.</p>
<p>But if you program them to play a certain opening position,</p>
<p>according to chess theory,</p>
<p>you get to see interesting ways into how they evaluate.</p>
<p>One of the things,</p>
<p>one of the ways that it played</p>
<p>against the London opening was absurd.</p>
<p>Like, it just, it was completely ridiculous.</p>
<p>Black sacrificed two pawns as early as move six,</p>
<p>which is a borderline, completely lost position.</p>
<p>And then both sides foresaw that the only way</p>
<p>White was gonna be able to use that material advantage</p>
<p>was to give it back and stabilize their own position.</p>
<p>And Black just got a crazy attack.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, this is crazy.</p>
<p>But they drew them and they ended up drawing.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m also gonna make them play against each other</p>
<p>in either bad openings</p>
<p>or like some of the most popular gambits,</p>
<p>looking at something like that.</p>
<p>And the way I&rsquo;m gonna do this is basically say,</p>
<p>which chess gambits are the best?</p>
<p>And the way I&rsquo;m gonna do that is,</p>
<p>theoretically, the engine should be able to beat a gambit.</p>
<p>Because a gambit is very rarely blessed by the computer.</p>
<p>So, if the computer cannot beat that gambit,</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That means it&rsquo;s not losing.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a completely lost gambit, it will beat it.</p>
<p>But if it draws, despite getting that early disadvantage,</p>
<p>then that means the gambit is very reliable</p>
<p>and you can play it.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a good way to evaluate opening games.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite opening?</p>
<p>Or what openings do you like?</p>
<p>There was an opening that got me back into chess</p>
<p>when I was 15.</p>
<p>I had quit for like three years</p>
<p>and I went to my friend&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and he had a book by Lars Skendorf,</p>
<p>a Danish grandmaster called The Karakhan Defense,</p>
<p>which is C6.</p>
<p>Do you want white or do you want black?</p>
<p>Do you wanna show them the opening?</p>
<p>This is the opening.</p>
<p>The Karakhan Defense.</p>
<p>So, you play E4, I play C6.</p>
<p>I have to play black.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And we develop from here.</p>
<p>I put my defense.</p>
<p>What counts as an opening?</p>
<p>Okay, but the development, does the development matter?</p>
<p>Yeah, so from here, the development goes</p>
<p>into the variations of the Karakhan.</p>
<p>So, this is the Karakhan.</p>
<p>Like, you can be in a city,</p>
<p>but then you can be in neighborhoods.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very non-dramatic, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Two pawns in the center.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s called the Breyer variation.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s a good thing for me?</p>
<p>Two squares, yeah.</p>
<p>You can put two pawns in the center.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Yes, and then I will go here.</p>
<p>And now you have to decide what you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>with your center pawn.</p>
<p>You can push, take, or defend it.</p>
<p>And push, take, or defend, right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What would you suggest?</p>
<p>Take is the worst?</p>
<p>Take is just stable, so we just trade.</p>
<p>But pushing is considered the best.</p>
<p>Advancing and taking my space away from me.</p>
<p>So, I think alpha zero or stockfish</p>
<p>would probably always push.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s something called the main line</p>
<p>or the sideline.</p>
<p>Main line is what&rsquo;s the most popular played at all levels,</p>
<p>which is moving the bishop here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played this a lot.</p>
<p>But for beginners and intermediate players,</p>
<p>this is why I love this opening so much.</p>
<p>On move three, black already has a plus score,</p>
<p>which is crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not supposed to happen.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this very tricky second most popular move,</p>
<p>which is undermining your center.</p>
<p>Trying to get you to take my free pawn,</p>
<p>but destabilize and leave both of them kind of hanging.</p>
<p>Is that why the plus score?</p>
<p>Is because you&rsquo;re susceptible to the destabilization?</p>
<p>Yes, because people at 99% of the rating ladder</p>
<p>do not understand how to deal with what&rsquo;s coming, basically.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know how to deal with a structural attack.</p>
<p>So, would stockfish try to defend the pawn here</p>
<p>and keep the structure?</p>
<p>No, it would take the pawn and tell you to go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I knew that, because I am 3,400.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It would take the pawn and be like, all right, win it back.</p>
<p>And even if you did, you would suffer.</p>
<p>It would make you win it back in the most annoying way.</p>
<p>It would make you tie your shoes together and block it.</p>
<p>So, as stockfish, I would take-</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the best move.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best move.</p>
<p>But not at 99% of the rating ladder, which is funny.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>But you like to play this.</p>
<p>I play this against GMs.</p>
<p>I play both.</p>
<p>I move my bishop.</p>
<p>I push the-</p>
<p>And what are the different ways it evolves?</p>
<p>Like, then the rest doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So, this is just like a pawn structure thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I mean, again-</p>
<p>How deep are most openings?</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s anywhere from like two moves</p>
<p>to like 10 moves kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, you can be out of theory very, very quickly.</p>
<p>Move two, move three.</p>
<p>Like, basically on your own, you have a general idea,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t remember games.</p>
<p>I mean, I know Caro-Kann games from start to finish,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve played it since 2011.</p>
<p>So, you know all the different branches</p>
<p>that goes with that down.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I know every opening in chess, basically.</p>
<p>I think most title players know every opening,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know, we can&rsquo;t play it competitively,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;d be, but-</p>
<p>What are some of the weirder openings</p>
<p>that, like, slightly suboptimal, but might be explored?</p>
<p>Like, Magnus might play them,</p>
<p>just to fuck with the opponent.</p>
<p>He played something recently, actually,</p>
<p>against this German prodigy, Vincent Keimer,</p>
<p>which was a specific move order in a very popular opening.</p>
<p>So, it was basically a position</p>
<p>that had been reached thousands of times.</p>
<p>But the move order Magnus chose with white</p>
<p>was played maybe 0.05% of the time,</p>
<p>which is crazy, it&rsquo;s thousands of games.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s supposed to be not good,</p>
<p>meaning it allows black to equalize,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what black is going for.</p>
<p>Not winning the game, but equalizing,</p>
<p>because you go second.</p>
<p>Magnus says, I don&rsquo;t care about equalizing.</p>
<p>I just want a position.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my opponent to know the answers to the test.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting,</p>
<p>because it also fucks you psychologically,</p>
<p>it throws you off, and just always keep you on your toes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in a weird position,</p>
<p>but he also has the advantage of being able to intimidate.</p>
<p>I wonder how many people,</p>
<p>how much is that a role of it?</p>
<p>Being scared of the other person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge role, I think.</p>
<p>I think some of the top guys would deny it,</p>
<p>but you know when you&rsquo;re in the seventh hour,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re playing Magnus,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very different feeling than some of the other.</p>
<p>When Magnus is messing around in the opening,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very different than another person</p>
<p>messing around in the opening.</p>
<p>You just kind of expect for something to be there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if it translates to poker for him,</p>
<p>but I think he gets a little bit,</p>
<p>maybe less respect in the poker world.</p>
<p>In the chess world, he&rsquo;s sort of alpha.</p>
<p>He gets a lot of respect.</p>
<p>I just talked to Daniel Negreanu.</p>
<p>The only person that doesn&rsquo;t respect Magnus Carlsen,</p>
<p>honestly, either in chess or poker, is Magnus Carlsen.</p>
<p>I was gonna say Hans Niemann.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But Magnus is hilarious.</p>
<p>I mean, when he talks about his rating,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>When he talks about how good he is at poker,</p>
<p>I suck, but I think that self-critical view,</p>
<p>I think he honestly believes, to a degree,</p>
<p>is probably part of the engine that fuels him</p>
<p>to get better and better and better and better.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re face-to-face with Magnus at a chess board,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the same as being</p>
<p>in a nine-handed poker table with him.</p>
<p>You kind of keep an eye on him, maybe,</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s a mysterious guy,</p>
<p>but chess is different,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, this is the man.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s very few people.</p>
<p>Yeah, so in poker, they talk about Phil Ivey that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>As like this super intimidating.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s probably harder</p>
<p>to intimidate in poker.</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something intimidating about excellence</p>
<p>in a deterministic game that&rsquo;s just terrifying.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re, I mean, it&rsquo;s like playing stockfish.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>This thing will suffocate you,</p>
<p>and especially when it makes moves</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>To me, the most beautiful thing, honestly,</p>
<p>is the sacrifices that the engines do.</p>
<p>Just the, it&rsquo;s such a fuck you.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Like, I could sacrifice pieces,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get them back, and I&rsquo;ll get them back more,</p>
<p>and I could look.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even, I don&rsquo;t even have to get them back.</p>
<p>Your position is so bad, I gave you full material,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, and that transfers to AI systems in general,</p>
<p>like a system that plays weak, just to fool you.</p>
<p>For people who are trying to get better at chess,</p>
<p>beginners or at any stage of their development,</p>
<p>what advice would you give about getting better?</p>
<p>Except watch your channel.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, watch my videos.</p>
<p>Check out Chessly.com.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m gonna scale the courses to.</p>
<p>But no, on a serious note,</p>
<p>you have to be prepared to lose way more than win.</p>
<p>My mom gave me advice when I was maybe 13 or 14,</p>
<p>and I just discovered that I liked girls.</p>
<p>She said, you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot more no&rsquo;s in life</p>
<p>than yeses.</p>
<p>That even happened with my wife, actually.</p>
<p>Our whole journey is quite fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s paved with rejection.</p>
<p>Paved with, yes, various ghostings over the course of years,</p>
<p>but we got married and we love each other very much,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a wonderful tale.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the same in chess.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna lose a lot and you have to be,</p>
<p>for adults, I noticed,</p>
<p>kids and adults learn chess very differently.</p>
<p>Kids yell out in class and they&rsquo;re very excited</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t realize how many times</p>
<p>they get something wrong.</p>
<p>Adults never wanna talk during lessons</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid of being wrong.</p>
<p>Adults will preface correct answers with,</p>
<p>this is probably wrong, but shut up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re paying for a private lesson.</p>
<p>This is the place to be wrong.</p>
<p>So adults especially think that being dominant</p>
<p>in a career where they&rsquo;ve dedicated</p>
<p>a lot of their brain power,</p>
<p>a lot of their work ethic,</p>
<p>and a lot of their study time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna translate to chess.</p>
<p>They do it to their own kids.</p>
<p>They helicopter their own kids</p>
<p>because they try to apply a lot of the same stuff.</p>
<p>Studying chess is different than studying anything else.</p>
<p>Anything else.</p>
<p>Same could be argued for martial arts, I guess, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>You have to have a beginner&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>and what that actually means is</p>
<p>sucking in every aspect of the game</p>
<p>and studying all the interesting ways in which you suck.</p>
<p>And you will realize you get better</p>
<p>without actually trying to get better.</p>
<p>I show up to the boxing gym one day,</p>
<p>I move my hips better.</p>
<p>And I would do shadow boxing.</p>
<p>Sensei goes, you&rsquo;re moving your feet better today.</p>
<p>You got better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t practice footwork.</p>
<p>Your brain just starts putting it all together randomly.</p>
<p>You might study a shitload and still lose 100 points.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna study chess, oh, and for fuck&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>this is the only activity where people go in going,</p>
<p>how much do I have to work to be a grandmaster?</p>
<p>Nowhere else in my life have I ever seen someone</p>
<p>try to pick up a hobby and wanna be the top ranking level.</p>
<p>Only in chess.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, but for example, when I,</p>
<p>like grappling sports, I&rsquo;ll see people come to a gym</p>
<p>and basically ask how long before I can get into the UFC.</p>
<p>But UFC champion is different.</p>
<p>I mean, no, grandmaster is equivalent</p>
<p>to getting into the UFC.</p>
<p>I guess, yeah.</p>
<p>But people quickly realize when like the 110 pound girl</p>
<p>taps them out over and over and they&rsquo;re a 230 pound</p>
<p>like ripped dude, they realize like, okay,</p>
<p>this is an art, this is a journey.</p>
<p>And I think if you resist the lessons</p>
<p>that failure teaches you, that&rsquo;s when you don&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>So like, just relax.</p>
<p>And one of the things you have to learn,</p>
<p>probably applies to chess too,</p>
<p>is to know how to relax your body, your mind.</p>
<p>And just like, there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>just like you said, like, if you don&rsquo;t resist,</p>
<p>if you relax, then your body, your mind</p>
<p>will learn the way of this game.</p>
<p>And probably add to that is just put a lot of hours in</p>
<p>of having fun.</p>
<p>But then I, on that Perpetual Chess Podcast,</p>
<p>I listened to somebody that say like,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t, like puzzles, none of that.</p>
<p>What matters is the number of hours you spend</p>
<p>kind of suffering, meaning like thinking deeply,</p>
<p>like straining, like thinking with your mind,</p>
<p>like really working hard.</p>
<p>So, and then you have the Magnus who says,</p>
<p>no, what matters is the number of hours</p>
<p>you spend having fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a mix.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mix.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite agree with suffering,</p>
<p>but I think people do a lot of fake learning.</p>
<p>They play speed games.</p>
<p>They just go through tactics.</p>
<p>So, okay, I have to do 20 tactics.</p>
<p>Okay, boop, wrong, next one.</p>
<p>I used to tell my students, you need to do 10 puzzles</p>
<p>and you need to get 100% correct.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how long it takes.</p>
<p>So I suppose that kind of is like the suffering theory.</p>
<p>But if you do 30 puzzles and you get eight correct,</p>
<p>what even is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s laughable in the correct amount of,</p>
<p>you know, it was 29%.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but 26%, it&rsquo;s, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You have to get things right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;re actually-</p>
<p>And that requires like thinking deeply</p>
<p>and like really struggling,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re doing the puzzles at the level</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s your level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a puzzle for an hour before</p>
<p>because I was so stubborn.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to just put in a wrong answer.</p>
<p>Yeah, the guy I was listening to said like, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>You should do that.</p>
<p>Maybe for me, and the same with blindfold chess,</p>
<p>I have to say.</p>
<p>Like my blindfold skills, I never practice.</p>
<p>I just, I can visualize the board quite well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played, at most I&rsquo;ve played four games blindfolded</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>That sucks.</p>
<p>That just feels horrible in the brain afterward.</p>
<p>But like I can play four simultaneous games.</p>
<p>Blindfolded.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that take to do that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I get asked that all the time.</p>
<p>How do I practice?</p>
<p>Why the fuck?</p>
<p>Why would you do that to yourself?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good party trick.</p>
<p>It is, yes, it is.</p>
<p>The video of Magnus doing it in Columbus Circle</p>
<p>on YouTube has like, I don&rsquo;t know how many views.</p>
<p>I did it live with an announcer.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine how chaotic that was,</p>
<p>but he, yeah, it&rsquo;s a great party trick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, there is a Reddit thing.</p>
<p>I forgot to ask Magnus that they asked me to ask him</p>
<p>because they moved the wrong piece.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then somehow he remembered.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that happened, I have to tell you.</p>
<p>I kind of presume that he figured out</p>
<p>from the way the other person was moving</p>
<p>that they moved the wrong piece.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I forgot to ask him that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why did I forget that?</p>
<p>I mean, my memory sucks.</p>
<p>You said, you know, ups and downs in your childhood.</p>
<p>A little rough sometimes.</p>
<p>Also, you get attacked by the beautiful,</p>
<p>wonderful people on the internet.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always difficult.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been the lowest point</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve ever gone to in your mind?</p>
<p>In my career or in my life?</p>
<p>In your life, in your career and everything, your mind.</p>
<p>So have you ever been depressed?</p>
<p>For sure, yes.</p>
<p>How did you, like, if you can remember moments,</p>
<p>how did you overcome that?</p>
<p>Well, I will share two anecdotes.</p>
<p>One, when I was May, 2012,</p>
<p>so I was 16 and a half,</p>
<p>and I was living in a household situation</p>
<p>where I thought nobody knew what was going on, basically,</p>
<p>without sharing, obviously, extremely personal details,</p>
<p>like, what was going on except me.</p>
<p>And I confided in my grandmother.</p>
<p>I was, imagine living in a house</p>
<p>where you basically feel like a prisoner.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to interact with anybody in the house.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re supposed to bring these things up.</p>
<p>Of course, this sounds extremely vague,</p>
<p>and I just don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t feel like exposing</p>
<p>all of my entire family drama to the audience,</p>
<p>but I lived this way for probably something like</p>
<p>eight months, I don&rsquo;t, something ridiculous.</p>
<p>It was the junior year of high school.</p>
<p>So I was supposed to take my SATs.</p>
<p>That was the year I was supposed to finish up</p>
<p>my portfolio for college,</p>
<p>because you only get really a few months of senior year</p>
<p>to start applying.</p>
<p>It was a fuck, it was a nightmare, complete nightmare.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how I got through it.</p>
<p>Time went by, I listened to sad music</p>
<p>and tried to spend as little time at home as possible.</p>
<p>I would pretend to fall asleep at my friend&rsquo;s houses</p>
<p>so that my mom was like, you coming for dinner?</p>
<p>And I would just pretend to be asleep.</p>
<p>It was just a grind.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it was a grind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember a whole lot from that period,</p>
<p>just sort of finding what made me happy</p>
<p>and trying to focus on it.</p>
<p>And I was a teenager in the house.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to run away.</p>
<p>I still had a roof over my head.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying I had it better or worse than others.</p>
<p>I just had it different.</p>
<p>And actually recently, this is much more on my memory.</p>
<p>I more or less tore up a very happy life</p>
<p>my wife and I had.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about this in bursts on stream,</p>
<p>but essentially what happened was</p>
<p>we had just been living in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually funny that the way we got</p>
<p>into this apartment was also very bad,</p>
<p>but we were living in just a very nice little apartment,</p>
<p>like high-rise apartment, safe.</p>
<p>And the reason we moved into a high-rise</p>
<p>was because we had lived in a house for two weeks</p>
<p>that got broken into.</p>
<p>Not because of who I am,</p>
<p>but because we suspect we had people moving in mattresses</p>
<p>and they went, oh shit, these two people live here?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p>And basically there was three apartments.</p>
<p>My upstairs neighbor let in somebody</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>And the guy cracked our door open with a crowbar.</p>
<p>Thank God that was the first day in two years</p>
<p>my wife went to work.</p>
<p>Did they know?</p>
<p>Did they not know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Everything happens for a reason.</p>
<p>So we-</p>
<p>Nobody got hurt.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Nobody got hurt.</p>
<p>Yeah, they stole some couple of important things,</p>
<p>but nobody was hurt.</p>
<p>And the cops did nothing.</p>
<p>So you moved into a high-rise in New York?</p>
<p>Yeah, in New York.</p>
<p>For safety and we&rsquo;re away from things</p>
<p>and we have our own nice little nook.</p>
<p>And somewhere some months into it,</p>
<p>I started hearing noises from above our neighbors.</p>
<p>And it started in the morning, 7 a.m.</p>
<p>It started in the afternoon and that picked up on it.</p>
<p>And I expected it every day for weeks.</p>
<p>Then it was driving me crazy.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna go have</p>
<p>a civil conversation with whosoever up there.</p>
<p>Sounds like kids.</p>
<p>So we go knock.</p>
<p>Lady gas lit the shit out of us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been gas lit that hard in my life.</p>
<p>She went, noise?</p>
<p>What noise?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably our other neighbor who&rsquo;s a boxer.</p>
<p>Lady, you have kids.</p>
<p>We can hear you through the vents.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to your kids.</p>
<p>Went to the front desk of the building.</p>
<p>They did nothing.</p>
<p>Went to the leasing office.</p>
<p>They did nothing.</p>
<p>And basically over time, it just was driving me nuts.</p>
<p>It was, back to the stubbornness thing,</p>
<p>I decided we were leaving.</p>
<p>We were going to live somewhere there was no noise.</p>
<p>Because we can&rsquo;t beat these people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing we can do, right?</p>
<p>And my wife, I dragged her around</p>
<p>to a bunch of different viewings.</p>
<p>I was dead set.</p>
<p>I decided I was completely miserable.</p>
<p>And we found a house to rent, like a nice house.</p>
<p>Family had just moved away.</p>
<p>House, standalone house.</p>
<p>Not gonna have neighbors.</p>
<p>But wife decided that, not wife decided,</p>
<p>we decided that it&rsquo;s too big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too big for, so we&rsquo;re gonna get a dog.</p>
<p>We always wanted an animal, so we&rsquo;re gonna get a dog.</p>
<p>So we get an absolute lunatic puppy</p>
<p>who just doesn&rsquo;t let us sleep at all.</p>
<p>This is on top of everything else,</p>
<p>the mental health crisis that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And the day we are moving to this house,</p>
<p>I realized I fuck up.</p>
<p>Like I realized that this whole thing was in my head</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna leave.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna leave.</p>
<p>This could have all been avoided.</p>
<p>And the guilt and resentment, I didn&rsquo;t wanna exist.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not that I, it wasn&rsquo;t suicide.</p>
<p>But you know, the feeling of just,</p>
<p>you want to just observe yourself from a distance.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>I thought my wife was gonna leave me.</p>
<p>Like this is the way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what anxiety does.</p>
<p>It also takes everything you feel to an absolute dread.</p>
<p>And that I experienced for a good chunk of two weeks.</p>
<p>And then we kind of settled down</p>
<p>and decided like, we&rsquo;re gonna live.</p>
<p>Did you tell her about it?</p>
<p>Like, were you able to talk through it?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I, yeah.</p>
<p>Does she know the levels of madness</p>
<p>that could be inside your mind?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;ll ever know,</p>
<p>but I tried to tell her that, and.</p>
<p>Give glimpses.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;ll ever know.</p>
<p>I kind of get the point.</p>
<p>Yeah, I try to, that&rsquo;s why I try to keep busy.</p>
<p>But that was the darkest it got.</p>
<p>And yet, through all of that, I went on stream every day.</p>
<p>I made YouTube videos every day.</p>
<p>Like, I understood that I had a job to do.</p>
<p>And I did it, and I talked about it here and there.</p>
<p>But that was the worst it ever got,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m learning that the emotions I experience</p>
<p>are guilt, remorse,</p>
<p>and your brain just goes in circles, basically.</p>
<p>About things that you&rsquo;ve done or haven&rsquo;t done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because noise can do that also.</p>
<p>So the noise was real, but it was building in your head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I try to, I actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of funny, because I like to focus deeply.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll have sources of noise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to teach myself over time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go to coffee shops and stuff to like,</p>
<p>I almost try to put myself next to annoying situations,</p>
<p>so I get trained.</p>
<p>Really, maybe I should do that.</p>
<p>But at a certain point, at the same time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to hang out with certain people,</p>
<p>especially in L.A.,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like in the middle of nowhere,</p>
<p>like in Malibu or something,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like that quiet.</p>
<p>Can you hear your ears ringing, it&rsquo;s so quiet?</p>
<p>Basically.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, holy shit, this is a good way,</p>
<p>if you wanna write something or create something.</p>
<p>This is like, super quiet.</p>
<p>So my mom does, my mom&rsquo;s a science,</p>
<p>journalist, science author.</p>
<p>She just published her first book, actually,</p>
<p>on poop, of all things.</p>
<p>Yeah, fecal, the waste management.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a very fascinating concept</p>
<p>and look through history.</p>
<p>And she would do that, she goes to complete solitude.</p>
<p>And she writes, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>No sirens.</p>
<p>I mean, New York is the opposite of that,</p>
<p>so you know, you&rsquo;ve brought it on yourself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived there for 20 years.</p>
<p>Has it been tough going on stream</p>
<p>to put on a face of happiness through that?</p>
<p>Yeah, yes.</p>
<p>But I find my ways to have moments</p>
<p>where I can talk about it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s on a stream, I don&rsquo;t get 10,000 live viewers,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>If I stream late night, I get 1,500, 2,000 viewers.</p>
<p>I used to care a lot more about viewers on stream,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve basically invested fully in YouTube,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s kind of the way I.</p>
<p>And I think, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but I think people appreciate the human being</p>
<p>behind the chess streamer.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people, not in the chess world,</p>
<p>but just a lot of people, they put on a persona,</p>
<p>and just in general, social media</p>
<p>is the highlights of your life.</p>
<p>Or the lowlights, just as long as they&rsquo;re dramatic.</p>
<p>But I try to be very open and honest.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m tired, I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what makes my recaps of my tournaments,</p>
<p>I think, so real.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, you&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny that we connected,</p>
<p>and we got into chess to talk.</p>
<p>Please, please keep creating, keep teaching people.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Well, it could end at any moment, as we talked about.</p>
<p>So yeah, thank you so much for talking today, man.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you do.</p>
<p>It was an honor.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me on.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Levi Rosman.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Irving Cherneff.</p>
<p>Every chess master was once a beginner.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
