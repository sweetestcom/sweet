<p><strong>JUSTINE:</strong> Everyone‚Äôs like, oh, like, have goals and stick to them. And I don‚Äôt believe that at all. I mean, I think it‚Äôs great to have goals, but I think if you stray from that goal, you could potentially find something way better.</p>
<p>[MUSIC]</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I&rsquo;m your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft.</p>
<p>In this podcast, we&rsquo;re going to get behind the tech. We&rsquo;ll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what&rsquo;s happening today. Stick around.</p>
<p>[MUSIC]</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech! I‚Äôm Christina Warren, senior cloud advocate at Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> And I‚Äôm Kevin Scott.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> And our guest on the show today is Justine Ezarik, also known as iJustine. She‚Äôs a techie, she‚Äôs a gamer, and she‚Äôs one of the top tech female influencers on YouTube. I followed her for many years. I‚Äôve met her a few times. And it‚Äôs been so interesting to watch her career trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, it‚Äôs really fascinating. I mean, I admire what she does, in general, inspiring people to get interested in technology, but like maybe even more so like I‚Äôm just inspired by her as an entrepreneur. She has ‚Äì like she was one of the very earliest people who figured out that there is a way to create content and to engage with audiences using these new technologies like YouTube and streaming. And she pioneered a way to turn that interest into a business, and now it is a big thing, like a thing to the point that both of my children would love to be able to figure out how to be influencers or streamers or whatever you want to call it, which is just it‚Äôs crazy how influential she‚Äôs been, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I read a study recently and I don‚Äôt know if this is a good or a bad thing, but apparently the number one career that kids have today is like they all want to be creators.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Like that‚Äôs their number one career, and ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Look, I think it‚Äôs a terrific thing, actually. So the creative impulse in general is a great thing to have. It‚Äôs what you have. It‚Äôs what I have. It‚Äôs like why a bunch of us are out, like trying to make new things to see whether or not they‚Äôre actually useful for a large number of people. And I think anything that can make kids want to create things and to create connection among people is good.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> One hundred percent and Justine is certainly one of those who has helped lead the way. All right, let‚Äôs talk with Justine.</p>
<p>[MUSIC]</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Our guest on the show today is Justine Ezarik&ndash; a techie, gamer, vlogger and celebrity YouTuber best known as iJustine. She has over a billion views across her YouTube channels. Justine is also an actress with appearances in film and television and authored <em>The New York Times</em> best-selling book, <em>iJustine: An Analog Memoir</em>. She hosts a podcast with her sister Jenna, called Same Brain, where they talk about tech, video games and food.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Thanks for having me. I‚Äôm so excited.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  It‚Äôs so awesome to meet you. I think we‚Äôve had one conversation before when you were chatting with some of the leadership team at Microsoft. But I‚Äôve followed the arc of your career, and the thing that you‚Äôre doing, I think, is&ndash; it‚Äôs obvious to everyone how relevant and interesting and important it is here in 2021, but you started a while ago. How did you figure out that this was an interesting thing? Did you have any sense that everything was going to blow up the way that it did?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  No. I mean, I was just a kid that loved technology, and it‚Äôs weird because now, like, there‚Äôs always, like, the buzzwords, like women in tech, women in gaming. And it‚Äôs so strange to me because when I grew up, no one ever, like, thought that that was, like, different. I was never treated differently because I was a girl and I love tech and I love playing games. It was just sort of, like, the people that I was surrounded with then, like, that‚Äôs just what we did. Like, we played games. Like, I was just ‚Äì that‚Äôs something that we loved. And I had never had any intention of this becoming a full-time job. It just sort of did. And I mean, I‚Äôve been doing this for so long, and it‚Äôs just so cool to still be able to be doing something that I really, truly enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Well, let‚Äôs maybe dig into that story a bit, because I think that‚Äôs just a super interesting thing. So, were either of your parents in tech? Like, how did you first get interested in technology?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  So, my mom was a teacher, so it was interesting because back then, there were a lot of, like, Apple computers and stuff in schools. So, that was, like, the only person that really ever had them was because of students and teachers and things like that. So, that was, like, my first computer.</p>
<p>And then my dad, we ended up getting like a PC later. So, it was interesting because there was just so much support from both sides, and my dad is also super tech savvy. So, he and my mom, like, built our entire house, like, basically with their own two hands. And so, they‚Äôre both very savvy in that sense. So, they were always super supportive of, like, my interests as well.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  And so, was gaming the primary first tech interest or did you ever do programing or was it BBSs or the Internet? I‚Äôve ‚Äì you‚Äôre probably too ‚Äì too young for BBSs. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong> I was really into IRC, so it was maybe like in sixth grade on IRC and just like trading, you know, music and things like that. But I loved gaming, and I had a Nintendo, like, very, very early. And I even remember asking my mom when I was working on my book, I was like, ‚ÄúWhy did you buy me a Nintendo?‚Äù She‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only thing that you wanted.‚Äù And I was like, ‚ÄúOh, okay.‚Äù So, it did stem from something that I wanted because I really didn‚Äôt remember back then, like, why did we have that?</p>
<p>But yeah, then I also was very interested in coding. So, around sixth grade, the whole time, whatever, I was really getting into video games as well, I first realized like the Web meant something. And I was like, well, how did they make this? And then when I viewed the source of a website for the first time, that‚Äôs when I had this realization of code, and that was something that was creating this.</p>
<p>And then I got into Web development and I taught myself HTML. And then I thought that I wanted to be a computer programmer, and I went down that whole path. And then I started loving sort of the frontend design. So, I had a teacher in, I think maybe like in high school, and I would work on getting everybody in my class. I would be making their ‚Äì actually making their programs look good and kind of neglecting the code a little bit. And he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to code. Like, you could be a frontend designer. You could do something like that.‚Äù I go, ‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt realize that that was something I could do.‚Äù</p>
<p>So, that kind of put me on a whole other path of discovering photography, graphic design and video production. So, it kind of really did stem from my love of tech and coding.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  You know, the thing that you just said is really important. We,  I don‚Äôt think, fully appreciate how important role models are when kids are trying to figure out what it is they want to be and what it is that they could do. Like, this whole thing where you didn‚Äôt even understand what a frontend designer was and, like, didn‚Äôt realize that was a path. So, I don‚Äôt know whether you think about, you know, you have a pretty big audience right now. Like, how much do you think about your job being a role model for kids, like getting them excited about technology and sort of showing them paths forward?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah, I mean, I think I recently ‚Äì well, I guess not that recent because I have been doing it for a while, but I sort of realized how powerful that is, because, like you said, like there wasn‚Äôt somebody who I could look up to that was doing this thing that I wanted to do because it wasn‚Äôt even a thing yet.</p>
<p>So, it‚Äôs so cool for me to just see how excited, the younger girls are getting about technology. And they‚Äôre so excited about their phones or their new laptops, and they‚Äôve started making unboxing videos. And any time ‚Äì we haven‚Äôt done these recently, but, like, back in the day, whenever you would do meet ups and just seeing people, and I would be signing phones and laptops and devices, I was, like, this is so‚Äìit‚Äôs strange, but it‚Äôs also like this is what I love and, like, I‚Äôve created this community and it‚Äôs just so cool to see it.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  So, what did you choose to study when you went to college? Like, did you have a clear sense of what you wanted to do by the time you graduated from high school?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Well, it was interesting because I kept telling my mom that I, like, I refuse to take my SATs. I was like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do this. I want to do ‚Äì I want to ‚Äì‚Äù I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to do something in computers. But, you know, that whole, I guess, traditional way of, like, going through school and that, like, it just ‚Äì like, I‚Äôm not a good test taker. And that‚Äôs just, like ‚Äì so, traditional school for me was very, very difficult. But it‚Äôs like the things that I liked, I was so good at, so like the computer stuff.</p>
<p>So, I end up going to, like, a two-year school, which was for graphic design, video production, multimedia. Basically, everything that I‚Äôm doing, I had a crash course of that for two years, and it was just the perfect fit for me. So, I think when kids are looking at, like, what it is that they want to do, you know, I think school is so important, whatever that is. If it is a traditional four year, if it is, like, a two-year crash course, like something like that for me was so perfect.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah, that‚Äôs awesome. I know the way that I learn is a little bit similar. So, I need to find my own path and, like, I believe everybody learns slightly differently than everybody else. And if you can figure out the thing that there are things that you‚Äôre really excited about and, like, you have a way to go immerse yourself in that, like, you can really get ramped up pretty fast on like new things.</p>
<p>I mean, I‚Äôve taught myself how to do so many unusual things by watching YouTube videos and then just practicing. And like, I just really wish that there had been this when I was a little kid, right, because I could have learned so much more so much earlier.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah,  that‚Äôs the thing that I was even thinking about. It‚Äôs like, even if this was available when I was younger, would I have taken advantage of that, because I feel like now, as I‚Äôm older, I feel like, I‚Äôm like, there is everything here at our fingertips. Like, we can do anything. We can learn anything. I think you kind of take that phase of childhood, like, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know if ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to speak on their behalf, but I feel like, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt understand until you‚Äôre older, like, how incredible and how powerful that is. So, I definitely encourage kids, if there is something that you‚Äôre interested in, you do have everything at their fingertips. Like, go for it.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  So, when did you really start doing the thing that you‚Äôre doing professionally right now, like making videos, connecting with the audience, like, using the Internet to say this important set of things that you have to say to, like, as many people as you could reach?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah, I would say probably professionally, in 2006, 2007, I think that‚Äôs when I finally was actually making money and getting sponsorships, and things like that. I mean, there were obviously very small and very different back then. But I also, before that, was, after I quit my job, I was working just like freelance. So, I was doing graphic design, video production and stuff like that on the side, sort of supports my Internet habits of, you know, like doing the live streaming and things like that, because it‚Äôs also weird, because I was one of the first people to ever stream on, I guess it was Justin.TV at the time.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  But it was ‚Äì I mean, obviously that became Twitch, which was also strange because no one was doing live streaming and I was doing it for 24/7, six months straight. And it was just such a weird experience because, like, that is the ultimate way to connect with people. And doing these, like, live streams was easy because it‚Äôs like we just met so many people, and everyone kind of became friends in the chat. Like, it was no longer about me. I was just sort of this small factor of, you know, everything that people were doing and they just made friends that way. And it was really awesome.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> It‚Äôs super cool. And I, you know, I think sometimes, we forget how quickly things have progressed. Like, one of the things I‚Äôm interested in is how did you find courage in 2006, 2007 to quit your job and make this your career, because people can actually have the idea in 2021. It‚Äôs like, oh, I want to go be a YouTuber or I want to go, you know, be an influencer on TikTok, or whatnot. And it‚Äôs still hard, but, like, it‚Äôs a thing at least that you can sort of see a whole bunch of other people doing, and, you know, the same way that, yeah, maybe kids aspire to be a theater actor or a movie star or whatnot, but, like, it just didn‚Äôt exist when you started doing it. So, how did you get the courage to do that?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  I think that‚Äôs probably the good thing is because I was young and I really didn‚Äôt have any concept of the world. You know, I was actually at a concert last night, and my friend Lindsey Stirling, who‚Äôs a violinist, also had the same sort of perspective, because what she‚Äôs doing now on tour and being a traveling musician, violinist with costume changes, all of this, 10 years ago, managers, agents, everyone was telling her, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this. This isn‚Äôt a thing. This will be nothing. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äì like, it‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù And just to see her 10 years later on stage doing that, like, I have that same feeling of so many doors were slammed in my face. Like, everyone was telling me, ‚ÄúNo, this isn‚Äôt a thing. Like, what are you doing?‚Äù I was getting made fun of.</p>
<p>But I don‚Äôt know. For whatever reason, I was like, I‚Äôm having a good time. Like, I love this and I think that there is something here. What it is, I don‚Äôt know. And I was just grateful that I did have very supportive parents and supportive friends that were like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre weird, but whatever. Like, we‚Äôll go along with whatever you want to do.‚Äù (Laughter.)</p>
<p>And thankfully, I did have that background of being able to do freelance work, you know, graphic design, making websites on the side so that I was able to sort of support my habits or my fun little side projects. I wasn‚Äôt like completely homeless.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  And so, what were the technical things that had to happen to enable you to do what you‚Äôre doing? I mean, so I guess there‚Äôs some obvious things, like YouTube had to exist and be at some level of scale. But, like, what else? It‚Äôs not just that, right? Like, you have whole bunch of other tools that you use to make your content and to reach your audiences.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah. I mean, now, it‚Äôs so different. I have a computer for streaming, a computer for editing, my travel, my storage, like all of that stuff. So, but then, I mean, it was still so early. So, like the price of these things was just ‚Äì it‚Äôs so expensive that it was, like, it was unattainable at the time.</p>
<p>So, like, the camera that I had, I mean, it was a small little, kind of, like, a VHS kind of thing with, like, the little DV tapes. And it‚Äôs like that then was, like, thousands and thousands of dollars and the quality was terrible. And that was, like, the cheapest thing that I could find, like, on the market.</p>
<p>So, now it‚Äôs incredible just to see how the price of things have come down. Like, you can create an entire, you know, business and studio on just a phone. Like, a mobile device can do that. And I think what‚Äôs so cool is, like, you know, once you actually have these tools and people are able to upgrade and see things that you can do, I mean, it really is endless.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  I guess I hadn‚Äôt realized how good the technology had gotten until the pandemic, where as soon as I was spending almost all of my time in video conferences, I was like, ‚ÄúOkay, well, how could I make the sound better, how can I make the video better?‚Äù</p>
<p>And so, and, you know, the funny thing to me is everything that I‚Äôm doing right now, so I‚Äôve got a DSLR that‚Äôs sitting above my machine. I‚Äôve got a Shure Sm7b microphone. I‚Äôve got a Focusrite Scarlett, USB audio capture device. I‚Äôve got a ‚ÄìI‚Äôm super nerdy. Like, I‚Äôve got a big LED octo bag over my head so I‚Äôve got decent lighting.</p>
<p>But all of this stuff I just copied from streamers who had figured all of this out. And I‚Äôm like, wow, it‚Äôs this incredible innovation that streamers have done, like, assembling all of these tools so that they can connect with other people. And, like, now, I‚Äôm using some of these same things to, you know, have better meetings.</p>
<p>So, have you seen anything about what you‚Äôre doing change as a result of the pandemic or, like, bigger audiences, people more interesting in some of the tech stuff that you‚Äôre doing, like try to get your advice about how to, you know, because we‚Äôre all streaming right now all the time, right? (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  So, I mean, I basically did the same thing that you did. Like, I completely upgraded my setting. And right now, I don‚Äôt have it because I just got back from a trip. So, I had all my camera gear and stuff packed. But normally, I do have, like, a DSLR or a mirrorless camera, actually. And then, you know, you end up creating such a good look. Like, your ‚Äì like, your view right now, like, people are like, ‚ÄúIs that background real?‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs real,‚Äù because, like, especially because yours, because you have the nice bokeh effect.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah. I mean, me and my sister started a podcast during the pandemic and we ‚Äì like, now I have a whole Rodecaster system, and we have several of them. And it‚Äôs just, like, we‚Äôve got the whole lighting. And it definitely is completely different because a lot of people did not know how to do any of this. In the beginning, it‚Äôs like this is something that I live and breathe, and I was, like, sending out extra webcams to friends who weren‚Äôt able to buy them, because there was, like, a webcam shortage. And I was like, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve got a whole box full of those from, like, the past five years of not having to really use a webcam.‚Äù</p>
<p>So, yeah, it‚Äôs really cool how that kind of all shifted and everyone kind of adapted to this new kind of lifestyle. And I think integrating this sort of way to do these meetings, I think, is going to save people a lot of time in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah, I remember at the beginning of the pandemic, it got really hard to buy basic stuff. So, like, whatever was on YouTube is like, oh, this is the best, you know, camera for doing live streaming, like, all out of stock or, like, this is the, you know, HDMI-to-USB video capture device, like, all out of stock. (Laughter.) So, it‚Äôs really crazy, like, how many people all at once decided that they were going to try to up their game.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Well, even that, it‚Äôs like some of the computers they might have don‚Äôt even have it. So, like, they actually could not participate or do their job, which is so wild to think, like, there‚Äôs a webcam shortage. That is something that I never would have ever expected. Yeah, I think a lot of stuff during the pandemic, I think really shifted kind of our perspective and ‚Äì and realization of how much we do with tech and how far we‚Äôve come. And, you know, for a lot of us, it‚Äôs like, oh, this is our way of life like this. This is what we do all the time.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  So, talk a little bit about how it is that you run your business, because in some sense, what you‚Äôre doing resembles how people created content for, you know, for a long while now. Like, you‚Äôve got lighting and microphones and cameras, and some of the mechanical bits are the same, but, you know, what you‚Äôre producing and, like, how you engage with your audience and how you make money is very different. So, like, talk about how that works.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah, it‚Äôs interesting because it is different for a bunch of creators. I know, like a lot of creators rely solely on merch, and I, for whatever reason, I‚Äôm just not a merch person. But that is definitely going to change, because I feel like there‚Äôs so much stuff that I want to create and just never really have. So, I think also during the pandemic, that was something that I was like, what am I kind of missing here? And that‚Äôs definitely something that we are working on.</p>
<p>But as far as the business side of it, I do a lot of brand deals, and it‚Äôs really fun because I do do a lot of tech. So, there‚Äôs ‚Äì the tech just is never ending and that never stopped. And it‚Äôs still just continues to be so fun because there‚Äôs so much tech to cover. So, there‚Äôll be brand deals that I‚Äôll do that can be, like, sponsored integrations for just, like, a one-off video or a long-term partnership, and then, of course, with YouTube, there‚Äôs the partner program. So, you get paid off of sort of, like, the AdSense and the ads that run over the video.</p>
<p>So, that‚Äôs kind of the main thing. And then, obviously, like there‚Äôs other things like consulting for companies or do I take, instead, if they don‚Äôt ‚Äì if it‚Äôs a startup, if they don‚Äôt have a budget to pay, then I‚Äôll work for equity or something like that. There‚Äôs a lot of different ways that you can go about it. And it just sort of changes because the world is changing. So, it‚Äôs like you just kind of have to mold whatever that project is, whatever brand.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah. I mean, I‚Äôm watching my 11-year-old son right now who has aspirations to be a YouTuber, try to get started. And, like, granted, I placed a bunch of restrictions on them that an adult wouldn‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs like, I‚Äôll let you upload YouTube content, but you can‚Äôt show your face, for instance. Like, I don‚Äôt ‚Äì you know, for your own safety, like, I just would prefer you didn‚Äôt do that. So, he makes these little animated videos that he uploads.</p>
<p>And so, I just watch him struggle with, I‚Äôm guessing, the same thing that you all struggle with, which is, all right, I don‚Äôt really understand this YouTube algorithm. I don‚Äôt understand always, based on the feedback that I‚Äôm getting from the people who watch my videos, about what they like or don‚Äôt like so that I can make more of stuff that people will like. I don‚Äôt understand how to reach new people. So, if I want to get a bigger audience in a way that isn‚Äôt just luck, like, how do I go do that?</p>
<p>And, like, this is stuff that, like, you, in particular, since you‚Äôre one of the very first people who‚Äôve ever figured out how to do this as a career, like you‚Äôve had to try to understand all of these things. So, I‚Äôm just sort of curious, like how do you approach this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah. I mean, I definitely learned early on that there‚Äôs going to be good videos, there‚Äôs going to be bad videos, and sometimes, there really isn‚Äôt an explanation and then you have to just accept it. There are small things you can do to make changes, but I just try not to focus on the numbers so much, unless there‚Äôs, like, a significant dip, and then, I‚Äôm like, okay, I need to really kind of go in and assess, because at one point, it drove me absolutely crazy. Like, I was obsessing about numbers, I was obsessing about subscribers. And then when I kind of stopped obsessing about it, it just sort of naturally came.</p>
<p>And really, it‚Äôs just about creating content someone else is going to want to see. There‚Äôs been videos that I‚Äôve been editing and I‚Äôm like, I am so bored, I can‚Äôt post this. This is ‚Äì this is garbage. (Laughter.) And then I just end up scrapping it. And then sometimes, there‚Äôs ‚Äì I‚Äôll also say that. I‚Äôm like, okay, let me work through this. What can I change to make this better? And I‚Äôm able to make it a decent video, and even though I might not think it was that good, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúYou guys really like that.‚Äù Like, that‚Äôs strange. So, it‚Äôs hard because you really don‚Äôt know what someone‚Äôs going to like or what‚Äôs going to resonate with people.</p>
<p>I think what‚Äôs so cool is the audience, like, is just so vast that even if you‚Äôre doing something that is such a niche sort of thing that you think nobody else likes, there‚Äôs somebody else out there. It might not be a huge audience. So, it‚Äôs like go after that audience and, you know, be the best in that small field, because there‚Äôs so many less people doing it and there might not be a huge audience for it, but you‚Äôre going to be the best at that.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah, I think that‚Äôs a really interesting thing that‚Äôs happened that is, you know, partly enabled by the technology, because it‚Äôs possible for a single person. It‚Äôs hard, and I don‚Äôt think people appreciate how hard it is to make compelling content and then, you know, just sort of get it distributed. And the audience is so big, it just changes the economics of what content creation can look like.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff that I watch on YouTube is weird. Like, I love to watch ‚Äì I love to watch classical pianists practice.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  So, like, I love, like, weird sorts of cooking videos. I‚Äôve taught myself to be a machinist by watching‚Ä¶And I don‚Äôt&ndash;Some of the time, I don‚Äôt even understand why people post this stuff. Like, why would you, as a busy professional machinist, post a bunch of videos on YouTube and social media about how you do your job, where you are better than the best teachers that I‚Äôve ever seen? So the generosity of that, to me, seems incredible. So, I just love this ecosystem, like how rich it is and how much of this, you know, sort of unusual stuff that you would never find anywhere else. Like, there was never going to be a machinist, you know, television channel, even on satellite or cable. It‚Äôs just awesome. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  It‚Äôs actually funny you say that. Like, why do they post it? I don‚Äôt ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know. Like, I don‚Äôt even know why I first started. I mean, I feel like it was because I was just ‚Äì I was entertained by it and, like, I thought it was funny. I don‚Äôt know. Like, now, I mean, it makes a little bit more sense, but still, like, he has a very busy day. Like, he‚Äôs going out of his way to, like, give that information to people. So, hopefully, you know, it comes back and he‚Äôs able to make some money off of the ad revenue and stuff like that. But still, it takes a lot of content and a lot of time to do that stuff. So, it‚Äôs like, is it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah. And I think, I mean, I watched this one machinist who posts a couple of videos a week, and I‚Äôve been watching this guy for years. And he was able to quit his job as a full-time machinist to make machining videos on YouTube, which is ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  That‚Äôs cool.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah, it‚Äôs cool and it‚Äôs mind-blowing. I mean, it‚Äôs just ‚Äì (laughter).</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Right.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  And I sort of wonder, for you as a creator, like, this must be true for all creators and artists, how you find that line between serving the interests of the audience so that you can get paid. And, like, paid might be currency or it might be recognition or, like, you know, whatever the value is that you‚Äôre getting from the audience, versus what stimulates and fulfills you above and beyond, you know, the paycheck or the fame or whatever else? And, like, it strikes me. I‚Äôve never done this, but I think it sounds hard whenever I think about it, finding that line.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  It is, and, you know, I think that‚Äôs the fun thing about working with brands, is, like, I‚Äôm able to sort of do a video that I may not have otherwise been able to, because, you know, they‚Äôre supporting that video and I‚Äôm able to make, like, something even cooler. But it‚Äôs, like, a lot of that content is stuff that I would have already made anyway. So, it‚Äôs great to be able to get a cool brand attached to it, because it‚Äôs something that I was like, oh, I would have done this and made this anyway.</p>
<p>But there is kind of that fine line of, like, okay, I‚Äôm doing this for them or I‚Äôm doing this for myself. And I feel like that also goes back to the beginning of why you‚Äôre creating, why you‚Äôre making the stuff that you‚Äôre making. Like, you have to choose something that you‚Äôre interested in. So, I genuinely like what I‚Äôm talking about, so it‚Äôs easy. It‚Äôs like, I‚Äôm doing this for myself, but also for them.</p>
<p>It does get a little tricky, though, because, you know, sometimes with brands, like, they will want you to say certain things. And I think now, like, I‚Äôve done a really good job of kind of, my audience trusts me. So, it‚Äôs like I have to have these brands trust me when I say, look, this really bad idea. You shouldn‚Äôt do this because I‚Äôm going to get made fun of. You‚Äôre also going to get made fun of, and we don‚Äôt want to do that. So, you have to have, like, that difficult conversation sometimes.</p>
<p>And honestly, sometimes you also just have to own up to it. Like, if you posted something that people didn‚Äôt like, either apologize or you just kind of move on and be like, all right, that video was bad. Just don‚Äôt do that again, and kind of just shift and change. But that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so great about YouTube, is the audience is vocal. Sometimes it‚Äôs negative, but it‚Äôs like you have this core group of people, and you know, if you hurt one of them or let them down, it‚Äôs like, oh no, I‚Äôm so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> And is that, for you, how you have the stamina to do what you‚Äôre doing, because I‚Äôve watched a whole bunch of other YouTubers who just burn themselves out because it can be all consuming? And some of them have even talked about that process. Like Casey Neistat, for instance, like, it sounds like he figured out a formula that worked of, you know, like, how do I make content that is compelling enough where it‚Äôs going to get a lot of engagement. But the process that he figured out how to do that, which he could repeat, was just killing him, it sounds like.</p>
<p>And like, you know, his reaction to that is, like, he‚Äôs dialed all the way back now. And he had a little stint, I think, last summer where he was posting videos again and they were really great. And like, you know, now, they‚Äôre dialed back again. So, I don‚Äôt know. How do you not burn yourself out?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Oh, I definitely have, and I think it‚Äôs just knowing yourself. And because I have been doing this for so long, it‚Äôs like you kind of understand when things are getting to be too much, and then you just have to dial it back or you have to find outside things or outside hobbies to just sort of take you out of what you‚Äôre doing. And making time for, like, health, fitness and just yourself is, like, I schedule that in now. It‚Äôs like everything kind of revolves around that instead of revolving around work.</p>
<p>So, it‚Äôs like I revolve when I can do whatever around, you know, like, okay, so if I can ‚Äì if I‚Äôm not going to be able to, you know, run during the day, like, I have to do it really early. So, it‚Äôs kind of like revolving those things and just like making sure that, like, your health and wellness and just, like, your mind is okay, because if you can‚Äôt come to the table and be able to do your job, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre going to be letting down all of these people.</p>
<p>And like, they can sense it online. Like, they‚Äôre ‚Äì they‚Äôre not stupid. They know when, like, you‚Äôre having a bad day. And also, there have been times that I‚Äôve been filming, and I will just be like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having an awful day. Like, I physically cannot do this.‚Äù And I know that, at this point, I‚Äôm like, I just ‚Äì we‚Äôre going to have to put it off until tomorrow. So, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs okay to, like, listen to yourself and know when things are too much, because it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre not machines, unfortunately. (Laughter.) So, we operate a little bit differently.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  I don‚Äôt know whether this is true for you or not, but I have that all the time, like, when I get to a point where I‚Äôm overwhelmed and I need to stop. And I always feel guilty about stopping. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Right. I definitely do.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  And I don‚Äôt know whether you feel guilty about it, but, like, learning to just sort of say, okay, well, you know, I may feel guilty about it, but, like, this is the right thing to do, and, like, I‚Äôm going to go do it anyway. But I still feel guilty to this day, like I‚Äôm sort of letting myself down or letting other people down by, like, not working as hard as I think I ought to be working.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Right. And then, you‚Äôre like, I‚Äôve actually been working very hard, when you really think about it. (Laughter.) You‚Äôre like,  I‚Äôm overworked. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm feeling this way. Yeah, I know (crosstalk/inaudible). But I mean, sometimes, it‚Äôs just ‚Äì it‚Äôs like, I was like, is this actually ‚Äì is getting this thing done worth me, like, breaking out in tears because I‚Äôm so stressed out and upset. I‚Äôm like, no, it‚Äôs not. I need to go for a walk. And, you know, just sometimes, those simple things of just going outside or going for a walk, like, it helps so much. It sounds cliche, but it really does.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  That‚Äôs such good advice. Everybody should just sort of pause and absorb that. And this is the, you know, the thing with folks who do actually burn themselves out because they can‚Äôt figure out a way to moderate.</p>
<p>Then this thing that they were doing is gone. Like, they can‚Äôt do it anymore and, like, they can‚Äôt share it with the world anymore. And like, 0that‚Äôs way, way worse than just, like, having a thing be a few hours late or waiting until the next day.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah. And it‚Äôs like, right now, so I‚Äôve kind of taken it sort of easy this beginning of this year, just sort of for myself and just everything. And me knowing that tech season is starting basically, like, right now, it‚Äôs like knowing that I‚Äôm going to burn myself out, so it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm fully prepared for that. So, it‚Äôs like if you‚Äôre prepared for that situation, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been preparing for this for four months. Like, I know these next two months are going to be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  And going into that, I know. And, you know, I am lucky that my sister is super supportive and I also have a great camera person, and he also helps edit. And it‚Äôs like we know this is go time and just ‚Äì just have that mentality of like, okay, do what we have to do to get it done and then we can relax when we need to. And if we really have to take a break, that‚Äôs okay. We are important. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah, it‚Äôs almost like training to run a marathon, right? Like, you‚Äôve got to prep for it, because if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre going to ‚Äì you won‚Äôt be able to run the whole race.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  So true. Like, yeah. I‚Äôm like, okay, we‚Äôve been resting. We‚Äôre ready. (Laughter.) It‚Äôs tech season.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  That‚Äôs awesome. So, I‚Äôm curious to hear if you have a set of things that you do for your work that you think are much harder than ‚Äì than people realize. So, like, I‚Äôve got a handful of maker videos that I have produced and posted on YouTube, just so I could understand the process of what it takes.</p>
<p>And, like, one of the shocking things to me is it takes a lot of work to produce five or 10 minutes‚Äô worth of good content. Like, I look at what Mark Rober does and I can‚Äôt even conceive of, you know, how much work must go into these, you know, 15-minute things that he‚Äôs ‚Äì that he‚Äôs making, because it‚Äôs like 40, 50 hours just for my sort of crappy 10-minute videos worth of filming and editing and voiceover work.</p>
<p>And so, and I don‚Äôt think people appreciate it because you see the ten minutes of video at the end, and you‚Äôre like, oh, wow, that‚Äôs ‚Äì you know, it‚Äôs almost like the better you make it, the more ‚Äì the more people take for granted what must have gone into it. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Right, yeah. Everything just takes so long and a lot of times, a lot of my videos, I don‚Äôt script them. I just, like, sit down and start recording. So, that for me, that was working for a while until I realized how much time I was wasting, because I would just go on and ramble for two hours about ‚Äì I‚Äôm like, what am I even talking about? This has nothing to do with, like, this product review. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>So, I started trying to at least, now, script them a little bit because I was wasting space, like, my storage. I‚Äôm like, I‚Äôm wasting not only time, but also space, storing all of this nonsense of stories that I‚Äôm never going to even use. So, I think that is also something I started doing, just a script to sort of make things a little bit more efficient.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs really the whole process. It‚Äôs like when you think about everything that goes into it from just setting up, making sure it‚Äôs okay, the sound, the lighting, the actual recording, the prep work that goes into making sure I scripted everything, the unboxing, even the cleaning up of cardboard boxes is ‚Äì honestly, it really could be a full time job for somebody here. Like, we would have a box recycling person because I spent hours breaking down boxes, and making sure that they‚Äôre in the recycling.</p>
<p>And then, even from that, the shooting, and then we have to, like, save the footage. We have to edit, and we back up the footage to make sure. Then we export, upload, thumbnails, replying to comments. I mean, it‚Äôs hundreds and hundreds of hours per video that, you know, people don‚Äôt really see. And then, when I kind of break it down like that and I think about it, I‚Äôm like, did I lose money on this project, because I think I might have, by the amount of hours that we put into it. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  I don‚Äôt know whether this is true for you. I can easily imagine if ‚Äì if I were going to take these maker videos that I have produced and, like,  do that as a serious thing. I think it would take a long time and a lot of engagement to get to the point where I could hire someone to, or, like, outsource some of the work where it would even be enjoyable doing, because there‚Äôs some parts of it that I just don‚Äôt like.</p>
<p>Like, I hate editing. And it‚Äôs so crucial to getting a good product at the end. But, like, I‚Äôm just terrible at it and I have no patience for it. And so, like, the first thing I would want is to, like, find an editor who can help me out.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah, and I mean, I think that is the thing. It‚Äôs like find somebody to do the thing that you really don‚Äôt like the most, and that would be super helpful. But I love editing, which is the problem, because it takes a lot of time. And if I‚Äôm editing, I can‚Äôt be on camera filming more or doing anything else. So, I, for the longest time, maybe until the past three years, like, I was editing absolutely everything myself. Like, no one else was editing. But now, I mean, I still edit a few videos here and there, not as many as I used to, but I still do maybe, like, half, maybe a little less. I‚Äôm not sure, it depends.</p>
<p>Also, like, I sometimes know that if I‚Äôm shooting a video and it‚Äôs going to be a disaster to edit, like I almost feel bad. Like I don‚Äôt want somebody to have to sift through all of my mistakes. And it‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôm there doing it, and I know in my mind when I‚Äôm saying things, like, I can just, like, do this and get it done.</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs definitely something that I do need to sort of let go a little bit more so that I‚Äôm able to do other things, is the editing. But man, it‚Äôs like I love it so much, though. So, that‚Äôs the problem.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  So, for things like that that you love and that you‚Äôre good at, how do you teach someone else how to do that in a way ‚Äì like, they‚Äôre not going to do it exactly like you, but, like, how do you teach them to do it, you know, well enough where it‚Äôs above your bar so that you can scale, because at some point, like your business gets big enough where you actually have to give up some of the things that you love?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah, I was even talking to another content creator friend, and they were like, ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt even look at my TikTok. I don‚Äôt ‚Äì do I even still even have a Twitter?‚Äù And I was, ‚ÄúYou have millions and millions of followers on all of them and you ‚Äì you don‚Äôt even know?‚Äù (Laughter.) And that, like, hit me to the core, because I was like, I still actually love doing this. And like, they‚Äôre super successful and super creative. And it‚Äôs like, for them, like, they‚Äôre like mentally, I cannot be on and I can‚Äôt see that. I‚Äôm doing what I‚Äôm good at and leaving the rest to somebody else.</p>
<p>And so, I think there‚Äôs a lot of creators like that, but then there‚Äôs also people who are really actually in their uploading and adding thumbnails. And a lot of that stuff is wasted time. Like, I know I could be doing something else probably better with my time, but giving up that sort of ownership of it is very difficult. And, like you were saying, how do you teach somebody? I mean, I think it‚Äôs a lot of time, too, and if they kind of get your vision and watch your videos, and I think a lot of it is timing, too.</p>
<p>So, it‚Äôs just a lot of kind of working on things and saying, okay, maybe we can do this differently or why don‚Äôt you try this? And it‚Äôs also kind of good sometimes having somebody different perspective, because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm so set in my ways. It‚Äôs like, all right, maybe let‚Äôs give me a little kick here. Let‚Äôs  try something a little different. So, that‚Äôs always super helpful, because I think a lot of us kind of get comfortable.</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs one thing that, like, I love being comfortable, but I also now have learned to hate it, because I feel like I‚Äôm not growing and there‚Äôs no change happening. It‚Äôs just like, cool, I‚Äôm just chilling here. This is great, everything is good. And I‚Äôm like, something is wrong. We need to ‚Äì we need to get uncomfortable. Anytime I get into my set and I‚Äôm like, this is perfect, let‚Äôs destroy it and we‚Äôre going to start over.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah. Well, I think that‚Äôs a really good mindset to have, because the space in which you operate is evolving so quickly. I mean, and you‚Äôve been doing it long enough, you know, maybe longer than anybody where you‚Äôve just sort of seen the full spectrum of change. (Laughter.) Like, when you started, there were no iPhones. There were, you know, like, smartphones were a very different looking thing than they are right now. Like, you were the first person other than Justin on Justin TV, right?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  So crazy. Yeah, it‚Äôs like, and now, just like looking back on kind of the whole picture, like it doesn‚Äôt even make sense. Like, what was I doing? I honestly don‚Äôt even know. Like, I was just having fun. And I think that is something that, like, we really need to enjoy whatever we‚Äôre doing. And it‚Äôs like if you‚Äôre passionate about anything, like, you really can make it be something.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs going to take a lot of work. I mean, there‚Äôs been ups and downs. I mean, I was, like, not even able to pay my rent at some point. And I was, like, moments away from getting evicted. And my landlord, bless his heart, back in Pittsburgh, I was like, ‚ÄúI promise, I have one more project. Like, it‚Äôs going to ‚Äì everything‚Äôs going to be okay.‚Äù And like, you know, just having people that are supportive and kind of, like, believe in you and sort of give you that little bit of lenience, like, I am forever grateful.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah, every successful person that I‚Äôve ever met and, like,  success is, you know, success can be, you know, you or success can be, you know, someone who is just feeling, you know, that they‚Äôve got fulfillment in their life. But everyone that I‚Äôve ever met, like, has had, like, these moments of grace, and compassion, and serendipity, and, you know, good fortune that have helped to get you through.</p>
<p>So, like this, you know, moment of compassion from your landlord, like, that was probably like a couple of things, like, you know, at some level, you know, she or he had to have had faith in you that, you know, that whatever it was that you were doing was going to actually make enough money so you could pay your rent, right? So, it wasn‚Äôt just giving you a pass. It was like they were believing in you a little bit, right?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah, and I think that goes a long way. And I think compassion and kindness can go such a long way. And this was interesting. So, we were in Hawaii filming a project, and me and my sister were there for a month. And the last day, I, for whatever reason, left, like, my small bag. Like, and I shoved it behind the seat. And somebody broke into the car, stole my bag, and, like,  my wallet was in there. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>And I made some video and I was, like, trying to, like, make light of the situation, just, you know, because I was like, this sucks. I was like, man, if anybody can just ‚Äì you can keep the money. You just ‚Äì can you turn in my ID so that I don‚Äôt have to go to the DMV because, like, that was also a nightmare, and I had to travel. And we, like, went around and people were so kind. Like, we were pulling security footage from various gas stations and, like, all these places. I basically, like, followed the crime as it was happening. So, I was like, man, this is wild, what‚Äôs happening right now. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>But somebody found my ID and they turned it in and said they saw it off of Instagram, that I had lost it. So, it‚Äôs like the kindness that we were showing to people who were helping me, like, we were giving them gift cards for helping, like, if the pulled security footage. So, I was like, I‚Äôm repaying you. And it‚Äôs just like the kindness comes back. And it‚Äôs think it‚Äôs something that, like, my mom and, like, my family is always kind of, you know, instilled in us, and it‚Äôs sort of just resonates. And it‚Äôs like, why would I want to be mean to somebody?</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  And I think, you know, going back to, like, troll comments and things like that, it‚Äôs like you see that stuff and it hurts so terribly. But it‚Äôs like, how does that person feel? They have to be in such a place of pain to ever say that about somebody else. And so, it‚Äôs like I have compassion for them. And I‚Äôm like, oh man, you‚Äôre trying to make me feel bad, but it‚Äôs like, I know you‚Äôre probably going through even tougher times. Like, you like to kinda have some forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  That is an amazing way to look at the world. I think if we had more of that, like we would have less of this, you know, sort of screaming at each other that we have right now.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Well that‚Äôs hard with social media, because it‚Äôs like everybody has an opinion, they have a voice and it‚Äôs like, it‚Äôs incredible that we have that, but it‚Äôs like no one‚Äôs the same. And in text, things can be taken so out of context that it‚Äôs just so vicious.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Well, I know one thing that I do all the time is, like, I will get irritated about something and then write a 500-word e-mail that is just awful. And then I‚Äôll write it, I‚Äôll reread the e-mail, and then I‚Äôll just delete it. (Laughter.) No one deserves me clicking ‚Äúsend‚Äù on those things.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  (Laughter.) I do that on Twitter. I‚Äôll be like, I‚Äôll write a mean tweet. I‚Äôm like, okay, I wrote it; delete. I‚Äôm not going to send it.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Or sometimes, it‚Äôs also nice to, like, kind of bounce ideas off of people. Like, I will write the tweet. I‚Äôll send a screenshot to my sister and be like, should I say this? She‚Äôs like, no. So, it‚Äôs like having that person that‚Äôs like, no, you shouldn‚Äôt do that.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah, and I think that‚Äôs the thing that we‚Äôre missing a lot right now. I mean, it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôve got your sister, but, like, just being able to, like, push pause on your emotions for a few seconds, like, it‚Äôs a pretty important thing to have. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  It is, because it‚Äôs just, everything can get so heated and it‚Äôs fueled by emotion. And people have been stuck in the house for, like, a year and a half and, like, there‚Äôs no clear end in sight. And it‚Äôs just so much misinformation. So, it‚Äôs like, just breathe. Namaste, go do some yoga, or something. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah. (Laughter.) So, you know, back to this point around how much change there‚Äôs been in the sort of social media and content ecosystem over the past 15 years. What‚Äôs interesting to you right now? And like, what are you excited about, going forward?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  So, I‚Äôve, strangely enough, been so interested in TikTok, mostly just because of it‚Äôs where I‚Äôve actually been spending most of my time consuming content. And even creating for TikTok is different because it‚Äôs ‚Äì like, you have ‚Äì to create for TikTok, you have to be a part of TikTok. Like, you have to see what people are doing and you have to be a part of sort of the community and see the memes. And it‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs a whole ecosystem in itself. And I do feel like I create differently for each platform, and it‚Äôs not really something that, like, I‚Äôm doing, like, on purpose. It just sort of happens. Like, Instagram has a different vibe to it. Like, I post different things there.</p>
<p>TikTok, during the pandemic, I got really into it, to the point that my friends had to have an intervention, which was one of my favorite videos that I‚Äôve made today. We made, like, a TikTok intervention, because it was, like, a joke ‚Äì (laughter) ‚Äì but everything that was happening there was actually very, very real. So, it was like TikTok kind of had this community where you could be yourself. I could be ‚Äì it felt like the original days of YouTube. Like, I was just being silly and crazy, and they‚Äôre like, who is this person? I go, no, this is me, actually me. (Laughter.) Whereas YouTube, it‚Äôs kind of become a little more serious. It‚Äôs become learning and educational and tech focused. So, it‚Äôs weird because it‚Äôs all sort of shifted naturally into sort of different places.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  My daughter, who‚Äôs 13, you know, we had a rule. Like you can‚Äôt have an iPhone or a smartphone until you‚Äôre 12. And so, she got a phone a year ago, and it‚Äôs locked down in a whole bunch of ways.</p>
<p>And one of the things that she was desperate to get on the phone was TikTok. And I‚Äôm like, you know, I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì know whether or not we should have ‚Äì have our 12 year old daughter ‚Äì she just turned 13 ‚Äì on TikTok. But I let her have a TikTok account, mostly because, you know, she had something that she wanted to say, and the way that she was going to say it was through TikTok.</p>
<p>And so, she‚Äôs got an account. It‚Äôs private. You know, she‚Äôs not blasting stuff out to the ‚Äì to the whole ecosystem. She‚Äôs got just her friends on her, on her account. And it‚Äôs like this way that they are sort of doing these creative things to show to each other. So, like, rather than drawing something in a sketchbook or, you know, like goofing off with each other, like on, you know, old handset telephone like I used to do with my friends when I was a teenager, like she‚Äôs using this as the medium.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs really interesting. Like, her motivation for being on TikTok is different, I think, from a whole lot of people‚Äôs motivation to be on TikTok. And I just realized, at some point, that maybe everybody‚Äôs motivation is slightly different, you know, when they‚Äôre using these things. Like, there isn‚Äôt just one thing. Like, oh, I want to be famous. Like, I‚Äôm going to, like, that‚Äôs probably actually the worst motivation for being on any of these things. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Well, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so cool about TikTok, is a lot of these people, like they‚Äôre just creating for the sake of creating. And the TikTok algorithm is so incredible that it‚Äôs able to surface content that you might not have ever seen. So, you could have zero followers and overnight, you could have millions and millions of views and followers.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs weird because the community is so oddly supportive. It‚Äôs like they want to see people succeed. Obviously, I‚Äôm sure in every platform, like, there‚Äôs a negative side to it. But for what I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs super positive. And, you know, just seeing that is so cool.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah, I mean, I think honestly, one of the things that maybe makes TikTok a little less toxic is the comment section. Like, you have to do real work. Like, if you‚Äôre in the flow of just flipping through videos on TikTok, like you‚Äôve got what, the heart count and the comment count, and, you know, some other stuff sort of sitting there on the side, but, like, it‚Äôs not front and center. Like, the video, the piece of content is the front and center thing. And you‚Äôre going to consume that and probably just flip to the next thing, and you‚Äôre not even going to click on this stuff that‚Äôs on the side.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  That‚Äôs actually a good point. I never really thought about that because it is a process. Like, where YouTube or Instagram, it‚Äôs like the comments are right there and you could just hit it.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  And I think sometimes, people are swayed by the comments. So, if you see a video and you see people saying, ‚ÄúThis sucks, this is terrible,‚Äù you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre right, it does.‚Äù And if you don‚Äôt see the comments, like you‚Äôre able to have that first opinion by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Oh, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  So, and if you don‚Äôt like it, just wipe away.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  There is occasionally like some sort of meta controversy, like, about content that then makes me not enjoy the content anymore. And then I‚Äôm super disappointed on YouTube. (Laughter.) And like, you know, TikTok, it‚Äôs just a little more focused on the core content and, like, getting you through as much of that content as possible.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Yeah, and it‚Äôs interesting because it‚Äôs obviously, like, there‚Äôs, like, the Instagram has reels now and YouTube has their shorts. And it‚Äôs like TikTok is doing one thing and they‚Äôre doing it very well, whereas a lot of these other companies are trying to do that also in addition to everything else. It‚Äôs something that I kind of miss about, like, the old days of, like, social media, because everyone wasn‚Äôt just trying to do what everybody else was doing. It was like, hey, look, we‚Äôre Twitter, we‚Äôre going to do this and we‚Äôre going to do it great. And, you know, I think it‚Äôs just like kind of sticking to that I think is very important.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah. So, we‚Äôre almost at time here. I want to be respectful of your time, but I‚Äôve got two more questions for you. One is just advice that you would give for kids who are thinking about what they want to do in the future. And like, you know, maybe to anyone who‚Äôs sort of thinking about like, hey, I want to be a content creator, like, what advice would you give to folks?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  So, it‚Äôs weird&ndash;everyone‚Äôs like, oh, like, have goals and stick to them. And I don‚Äôt believe that at all. I mean, I think it‚Äôs great to have goals, but I think if you stray from that goal, you could potentially find something way better. And I think, like me wanting to be a programmer, like that was my goal, I want to do this. I may have never straight away and started doing video or photos and things like that to lead me to what I‚Äôm doing now. And I think just be flexible and kind of going with the flow and sort of figuring out things is honestly great. So, it‚Äôs like have goals, but don‚Äôt be afraid to stray from them.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Awesome. But, you know, you‚Äôre also driven at the same time. It‚Äôs really interesting hearing you talk. So, like, I think that flexibility is, and awareness of what‚Äôs going on around you and with yourself is, like, that sounds like one of your superpowers, but you‚Äôre also driven, right?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Sure. And I mean, it‚Äôs hard because there are so many different people. And it‚Äôs like my other sister, she‚Äôs our middle sister. Like, I could never see her doing this. You know, it‚Äôs like there is a type of person that this is for. But I feel like if anybody wants to do it, like, it really is possible, but there‚Äôs hard work involved. Like, it‚Äôs not just, hey, I woke up and I‚Äôm going to post a video. Like, there‚Äôs so much that goes into it.</p>
<p>But if you do genuinely enjoy it and if there is a part of the process that you aren‚Äôt able to do or you really don‚Äôt like doing it like you, you don‚Äôt, like, enjoy the editing as much, you‚Äôll find people around you that can support you and kind of fill in the gaps.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Yeah. That‚Äôs awesome, awesome advice. So, last question. So, and maybe, maybe this has already been asked and answered, given how public a figure you are, but I‚Äôm just sort of curious. Like, outside of, like, this work that you do, which consumes an enormous amount of your time, what do you do for fun?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Oh my gosh, it‚Äôs so funny because this is something I, like, I want to talk about more than anything. So, I started training jujitsu about three some ‚Äì three and a half years ago, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Nice.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  And that is something that has completely, absolutely changed my life. So, for the first year, I was like, I‚Äôm not going to talk about this. I‚Äôm not going to post anything. I didn‚Äôt talk about anything. I told the gym, I was like, I don‚Äôt want anyone posting that I‚Äôm even here. And it was, like, until I got my blue belt, I was like, then maybe I will actually post and say if it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm doing.</p>
<p>But martial arts has become such a huge part of my life, almost even more than tech. Like, even when I was in Hawaii this past month, I basically was there. I did, like ‚Äì I was just training jujitsu. I was doing ‚Äì I started training light sabers, so doing, like, light saber combat and light saber things from ‚Äì which stems from a martial arts called kali, which is a Filipino martial arts. And I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just ‚Äìit‚Äôs so empowering and the amount of knowledge that is out there for these things, like we‚Äôre talking about machining. I mean, I spend most of my time watching jujitsu videos like on YouTube. (Laughter.) So, it‚Äôs like my entire algorithm is, like, oh, an unboxing and jujitsu.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  So I know a lot of people now, actually, who are like very into jujitsu and, like,  maybe the first time as an adult, like I know Anthony Bourdain, like, was into jujitsu and, like, I was a huge fan of his work. And I was like, oh, that‚Äôs sort of unusual. Like, this tall, skinny chef guy is, you know, training martial arts. So, like, what is the attraction to that for you?</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  I mean, for me, I just felt, when I walked into that gym, I just felt I was at my lowest point. I felt incredibly weak. I felt just I was, like, depressed, like, it a super bad point in my life. And, like, I was like, I need to do something other than what I‚Äôm doing. And then, when I walked into that gym, it was incredibly humbling because nobody cares who you are, what you do. It‚Äôs like when you‚Äôre on the mat, you‚Äôre there to learn, you‚Äôre there to train. And it‚Äôs just, for me, it kind of puts so many things into perspective, mostly because I wanted to learn everything so incredibly fast.</p>
<p>And, you know, as a white belt, like, you really ‚Äì like, you think, yeah, I‚Äôm doing such a great job. And then somebody comes in and crushes you, and then you just go home crying. You‚Äôre like, oh, man, I know nothing. And it‚Äôs like every single time, it‚Äôs like every time you level up and you learn something, that just causes another problem. But it‚Äôs just such a vast variety of things that you learn. And it‚Äôs so empowering when you actually are able to start leveling up and actually learning things.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs honestly one of the most rewarding things that I‚Äôve ever done. And I think I learned the most when I got injured for the first time because I was going too tough. I wanted to learn everything so fast. And that taught me to slow down and kind of enjoy the process. Like, you‚Äôre not going to learn everything in this first year. So, if you keep getting hurt, you‚Äôre not going to progress. So, it‚Äôs like that injury taught me to kind of figure out what else I could do when I couldn‚Äôt be training.</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs when I started the other martial arts, Kali, which is more kind of, like, hand-to-hand combat with, like, various sticks and different weapons. I was doing that while I was injured. And then it‚Äôs kind of ‚Äì that sort of has played into my life a lot, where if there‚Äôs a problem that I‚Äôm having, I‚Äôm like, okay, I myself cannot do this, but what else can I do to work around that issue to make it work? So, it‚Äôs like martial arts has taught me so, so much about, like, myself, and it‚Äôs just such a rewarding experience.</p>
<p>And I think from that, my biggest piece of advice to anyone is, like, have a hobby that you do outside of anything. And just go, set phone down and just be. And I mean, that took me like 13 years to kind of figure that out. (Laughter.) And, you know, when I did, I was like, this really is life changing.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  That is super awesome. And with that, thank you so much for talking with us today. This has been really super interesting. I‚Äôm such a huge fan of what you do.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  It‚Äôs just awesome to have you out there in the world. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Thank you. No, I appreciate it. This was really fun. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong>  Super cool.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTINE EZARIK:</strong>  Awesome.</p>
<p>[MUSIC]</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> So that was Kevin‚Äôs conversation with Justine Ezarik. You know, listening to her talk about her story, I was struck again and I kind of admit, I‚Äôd kind of forgotten&ndash; our career paths are remarkably similar. We‚Äôre the same age. We got started online about the same time. Obviously, she went more in the video direction. I took a more written approach, but it was so interesting just, I think, hearing about A) how she got into tech and B) just the story of her career, and I was honestly kind of struck by it ‚Äì A) again, because like I said, it was similar to mine, but is also just not the typical story that we hear a lot of people who are interested in tech.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and I‚Äôm always inspired by that and just sort of fascinated how people even get the courage to go do these things. So when you are charting a new course, it is so easy for everybody around you to sort of dismiss what you‚Äôre trying to do to say it‚Äôs stupid or silly, or that you‚Äôre going to fail and summoning the courage to go do the thing anyway because you believe in it is just, I mean, it‚Äôs inspiring and like to see it work.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> It is very encouraging.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No. One hundred percent, you know, I mean, like I remember when she used to ‚Äì back when Justin.tv, which is ‚Äì which became Twitch, but back when it started, it was it was livestreaming, usually what‚Äôs now known as IRL streaming. But that was basically what it was. And she would live cast her life, and it was completely new and there weren‚Äôt many people who were doing it. Justin Kan was doing it, she was doing it. And then to just see the business that she‚Äôs built, you know, like, not only has she continued to be a creator and influencer and put out great content, but she‚Äôs actually ‚Äì and I think that this is applicable even for people who might not want to be on ‚Äì on that type of creative thing, the business that she‚Äôs built has been really inspiring and really amazing to watch come together.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and I can say when Justin.tv started and when she and Justin were doing this stuff, you know, they had a camera strapped to them 24 by 7 we‚Äôre broadcasting their life. I didn‚Äôt really get it, and I certainly did not appreciate that they were figuring out a template for a way for people to assemble a whole bunch of technological components in a new way to reach an audience. And, and like so much of what I consume now ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Is that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> It‚Äôs, it‚Äôs exactly that stuff. It‚Äôs, it‚Äôs not the, you know, 24 by 7 IRL stuff, but it is like little episodic views into people‚Äôs lives, whether it‚Äôs someone who is a cooking enthusiast or, you know, like I like watching people practice playing classical piano.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs just these things that you get to see that you just wouldn‚Äôt otherwise. And like, they are the ones who pioneered this stuff, it‚Äôs just great, I think.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No, I totally agree, because the technology obviously is what allowed that to become more democratized and allowed people to be able to do that. But then you had the personalities and the people who were willing to A) put it out there and show, yes, this can be compelling. And then I think, you know, there were a number of people who were doing those things at the time. Very few of them have stayed around, let alone have grown into, you know, big brands. And so that‚Äôs another thing to not ‚Äì not that that has to be the goal, but I think it‚Äôs been really impressive to see, with Justine, especially since she started, you know, in her twenties, had the foresight to say, okay, I want to make this into a career and I‚Äôm going to figure out a way to make this into a business because it wasn‚Äôt a business then and there wasn‚Äôt a path that you could follow to make that into something that you could actually turn into a career.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and I think the really interesting thing is like, we honestly all owe them a debt of gratitude, I think, because the fact that they pioneered this stuff and they created not a small business ecosystem around streaming meant that a whole bunch of technology was in place when the pandemic started, where we all sort of kind of turned into streamers over the past 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yeah, yes. No, that‚Äôs been the joke I‚Äôve been making with my friends is that like we‚Äôve all become, you know, Twitch streamers over the last 18 months because we had to, and I had a slight advantage over some other people because I already ‚Äì I‚Äôve always had camera stuff and I‚Äôve done that sort of thing. I had audio equipment and some video stuff, but certainly not to the extent of, you know, people like Justine and others. And it was interesting, you know, when I got up to speed, I‚Äôm sure that you found this too, you know, I almost found myself becoming a consultant for like friends and family on how to do their own setups.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> And I thought about people like Justine, and I was like, you know‚Ä¶ not that she needs to, and she‚Äôs doing plenty well on her own, but it‚Äôs like the stuff that she does we‚Äôve now seen a direct one-to-one way where it‚Äôs not just from a consumer standpoint, it can actually be an enterprise or, you know, a standpoint, you know, it (crosstalk), and there‚Äôs so many different things where once you have figured out how to get the process down ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> It can be incredibly, incredibly useful. But it can also really kind of change the game for things and open up access to opportunities and into resources that people might not otherwise have had and.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> And, and so, you know, seeing that and seeing how that can become more accessible to everyone, I think is awesome.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, I totally agree. And I don‚Äôt know whether this was the case with you from last spring, but when I was trying to get my AV game into a better state for prolonged remote work or for being able to do TV interviews ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Or keynote conferences or whatnot, like the way that I figured this stuff out is, I went and watched a bunch of videos ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> From gaming streamers to see what they were doing.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No, that ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Because they were the pros.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No, that‚Äôs exactly what I did. I did the exact same thing, and then I went to like YouTubers that I liked, who I knew had like a fast turnaround system. I was like, okay, you know, many of them put their gear in you know, the description boxes, which was very useful and to say, okay, what‚Äôs your setup? And, and fortunately, a lot of them would do behind-the-scenes streams. I‚Äôm like, okay, this is how I set it up. And I was like, yep, this is what I‚Äôm going to take on, because even though the context is different and the content might be different, this is what we want to achieve. And, and so it was great to have those examples out there because we all had to kind of become home broadcast studios.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, it‚Äôs super cool, a strange and fascinating world.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> A strange, fascinating world, indeed, and Justine has been such a good influencer, and I like that, you know, she is conscious about the fact that she is a role model for the next generation coming up, like your kids, right? Because they see her as somebody who has done this and has been successful and has also been true to who she is as a person.</p>
<p>Yeah, and she‚Äôs sort of fearless with what she does.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Like she is ‚Äì you know, more so than most of the rest of humanity has figured out who she is in public, but she‚Äôs been relatively fearless in the way that she has embraced opportunity and technology and business, and we even chatted a little bit. It, it‚Äôs not like the things that she‚Äôs pioneered have remained in stasis.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Like, you‚Äôve got a bunch of new stuff coming along like TikTok, for instance, and that won‚Äôt be the end of it either.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No. No. Well, this is actually what‚Äôs always been ‚Äì what‚Äôs been impressive to me, about here, is that she has lasted for this long, because again as I mentioned, early on, like in the Justine.tv, like live, you know, life streaming days, you had a number of people and most of them have fallen off. And then every time a new platform comes out, again, you kind of get the next wave of ‚Äì you have people, like you know, Vine was big, and there were a lot of people who were Vine stars and some of them were able to translate, some of them weren‚Äôt. But what‚Äôs been impressive about her is that she‚Äôs been able to master these different networks and stay relevant.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> But also stay true to who she is as a creator and as a person.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and that is a super interesting thing because not everybody is able to do that.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Some people are not interested. Like you look at Mark Rober and ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Mark makes one, high production value, you know, 20-minute-ish video a month.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> And like, he has figured that out, and it‚Äôs awesome. He‚Äôs, he‚Äôs almost like the, you know, the modern moral equivalent of MythBusters, right? He‚Äôs sort of figured out how to do that on his own and be the entrepreneur of that. There are some people ‚Äì like I forget who they are, but like, there‚Äôs a TikTok star right now who got up to a hundred million followers and got offered a TV show. Not clear that that‚Äôs going to</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Charli D‚ÄôAmelio, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> In that direction, yeah. And so, you know, like these people like Justine who can navigate multiple generations of technology, multiple generations of media, multiple ‚Äì you know, different ways ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Multiple generations of audiences, frankly, right?</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, yeah, for sure. So it‚Äôs just impressive. And like she has such an easygoing way about her. You know,  she‚Äôs just super impressive.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Totally agree. It was a great conversation and it‚Äôs great to seed someone like her out there.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> All right, well, that‚Äôs it for the show today. You know that we always love to hear from you.
