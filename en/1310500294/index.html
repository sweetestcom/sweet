    <p>when you imagine a song, is it the opening you imagine?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s kind of a, I never think opening,</p>
<p>I never think final, I think soundscape</p>
<p>of how I&rsquo;m feeling right now.</p>
<p>So it could be the middle of the song</p>
<p>for all I know when I&rsquo;m doing that.</p>
<p>But my process for me is very much lyrics and melody</p>
<p>and music really come at the same time.</p>
<p>Like by same time, I mean, as I&rsquo;m expressing maybe,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling like.</p>
<p>Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not that simple, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hear it like, it&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s all the orchestra</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of just pressing all the buttons at once.</p>
<p>And melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Dan Reynolds,</p>
<p>the lead singer of Imagine Dragons,</p>
<p>one of the most popular bands in the world</p>
<p>with over 75 million records sold and with four songs</p>
<p>being streamed over a billion times on Spotify.</p>
<p>Given all that, Dan is one of the most down to earth,</p>
<p>kind, thoughtful and fascinating human beings</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever met, grounded in part</p>
<p>by his lifelong struggle with mental health.</p>
<p>The darkness, the love and the creative brilliance</p>
<p>are all there in this one humble mind.</p>
<p>For this reason and many others, we became fast friends.</p>
<p>Plus, he recently started his journey in programming,</p>
<p>which funny enough is where we start this wide ranging,</p>
<p>deeply personal and fun conversation.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>

<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Dan Reynolds.</p>
<p>So, we were talking offline</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not just getting into programming.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most beautiful program you&rsquo;ve ever written?</p>
<p>Something that brought you joy?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, I really love completion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reason that I&rsquo;m addicted to songwriting.</p>
<p>I like there being nothing and then having some blocks</p>
<p>or tools and building them into what you want it</p>
<p>to look like and then I find it incredibly rewarding</p>
<p>to stand back and look at what you did at the end.</p>
<p>It could be anything.</p>
<p>For me, it was as simple to begin with</p>
<p>as just because it&rsquo;s object oriented,</p>
<p>like making a cube move.</p>
<p>As simple as that, understanding that</p>
<p>and knowing that I built that and made it do that</p>
<p>is really rewarding and I think it&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that drew me into wanting to learn more.</p>
<p>But as far as what is some big piece of code</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done, absolutely not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still at a level where it&rsquo;s more like</p>
<p>what is a tutorial that I followed and got,</p>
<p>and then, yeah, so I couldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m at a level</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve done anything beautiful at all in code.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also interested in potentially,</p>
<p>like your heart is drawn to creating games.</p>
<p>Creating anything.</p>
<p>And completing it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To feel good as it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been working over the last two years</p>
<p>with actually a team out of Kiev on,</p>
<p>and we can get into that, it&rsquo;s a whole other story,</p>
<p>but on a computer game.</p>
<p>And really, I&rsquo;ve kept that kind of under wraps,</p>
<p>but yeah, we&rsquo;re kind of getting to a point now</p>
<p>where we have a prototype that we can play</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a lot of fun and thankfully,</p>
<p>all the team members are in safe places now.</p>
<p>Things have obviously been on hold for a little bit,</p>
<p>but when that started is when I really decided,</p>
<p>okay, I need to understand base level coding in C Sharp,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not an idiot talking to these people.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, yeah, we&rsquo;ve been doing that</p>
<p>for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Is there any parallels between the final completion</p>
<p>that you feel with programming?</p>
<p>Which I think is a little bit more definitive.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s debugging, the code doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s messy and so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the early design stages,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not sure how to have functions and classes,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s all gonna work.</p>
<p>And then it comes together and it&rsquo;s really done</p>
<p>because it works and there&rsquo;s a cube moving on the screen.</p>
<p>Is there any parallels between that and music?</p>
<p>Because are you really ever done done with a song?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the same thing for me,</p>
<p>just in that it&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>I really believe that we have not fully encapsulated artists.</p>
<p>Like when we say art, I think most people think,</p>
<p>okay, the medium must be painting or drawing</p>
<p>or music or writing.</p>
<p>But I really believe anytime you&rsquo;re creating some things,</p>
<p>engineers, for instance, you&rsquo;re creating something</p>
<p>with tools that you have and it can be incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>And so yeah, I think, and it&rsquo;s never done.</p>
<p>I feel like I look at songs that I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and I never felt you have to let go or I have to let go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just continually making myself let go.</p>
<p>But I look at songs that I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and wish I had done more or kept going down that road</p>
<p>and what would have happened.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really contained to, because of what our band is</p>
<p>and what our fans expect and there&rsquo;s so much more to it</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m fitting in a box always.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, this song shouldn&rsquo;t be longer</p>
<p>than three minutes and 30 seconds.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if I remember the chorus after I heard it.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to hear the chorus three times</p>
<p>instead of those two times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s certain, especially in pop music,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to,</p>
<p>yeah, it feels like there&rsquo;s confines,</p>
<p>even though people are like, well, there&rsquo;s no confines,</p>
<p>but still everybody&rsquo;s writing a pop song</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a few minutes.</p>
<p>And are those explicit in your mind</p>
<p>or are they just kinda, the gut is, like you said, chorus.</p>
<p>Should you have chorus once, twice or three times?</p>
<p>Is that a gut thing or is that a rule thing?</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s a rule.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s obviously a rule I impose on myself.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s in my house saying, hey, Dan,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t do this, I&rsquo;m gonna punish you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no major label president that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Imagine Dragons needs to make pop music, Dan.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>My manager doesn&rsquo;t even tell me that.</p>
<p>I do it because it&rsquo;s what I perceive to be enjoyable.</p>
<p>I grew up listening to a ton of pop music,</p>
<p>and then I ended up being in what is quote, unquote,</p>
<p>a rock band, which I&rsquo;ve never perceived it as that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kinda what the world has called it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fine, but.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a prisoner of a prison</p>
<p>that you yourself constructed.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a happy, I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m a happy prisoner of the prison</p>
<p>that I have created for myself,</p>
<p>and I made that prison thinking that it was a mansion.</p>
<p>So you worked with Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>What does Rick think about your prison?</p>
<p>Rick was, you know, it was interesting to hear</p>
<p>his outside opinion when we first met,</p>
<p>because my biggest focus for so much of my life,</p>
<p>my biggest fear was, and this stems from, I think,</p>
<p>middle schools when it started,</p>
<p>but everyone being in on a joke except for yourself.</p>
<p>I really, like, the thought of thinking</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good at something, and really, you&rsquo;re terrible at it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re surrounded by people who are saying,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;re good at it, and then by themselves,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, he&rsquo;s terrible at this.</p>
<p>Just kind of, and not just in regards to music or art,</p>
<p>but anything in life, and I think maybe</p>
<p>from having six older brothers, it stems from that too,</p>
<p>like, always feeling inadequate,</p>
<p>and like, the annoying younger brother, you know?</p>
<p>But anyway, so Rick&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to let go of as I&rsquo;ve gotten older</p>
<p>and had life experiences, but one of the things</p>
<p>that Rick said really early on that has stuck with me</p>
<p>was he said, yeah, you know, we&rsquo;re resuming</p>
<p>the first time we met.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;d really like to work with you</p>
<p>because I feel like you&rsquo;re not confined to a sound.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done a lot of different sounds,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s exciting because I feel like your fans</p>
<p>are forgiving more than other rock bands or bands,</p>
<p>because most people, when they hear a band,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a very specific sound with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they do folk music, or they do, like,</p>
<p>California rock, or they do surf, or they do, you know,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s, and your fans kind of want that.</p>
<p>Like, they want them to do that thing,</p>
<p>and then they don&rsquo;t do it, and sometimes that goes well,</p>
<p>but a lot of times it doesn&rsquo;t, and people, you know,</p>
<p>critics and everybody is like, go back to the thing</p>
<p>that you did good and do that.</p>
<p>Rick was, felt, whether he was right or wrong,</p>
<p>that we could do, we hopped genres so much,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s been to our benefit and detriment, I think.</p>
<p>Why detriment?</p>
<p>Because people want you to be something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more, you can believe it more.</p>
<p>I, you know, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more authentic if you never change.</p>
<p>I guess, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly it&rsquo;s not something I subscribe to</p>
<p>because I create music, but I also grew up listening</p>
<p>to a lot of different genres, like, cats,</p>
<p>I would listen to, like, Cat Stevens,</p>
<p>and the next song would be, like, Biggie,</p>
<p>and then the next song would be Nirvana,</p>
<p>and it was like, I like a lot of,</p>
<p>and then Billy Joel, and then Enya.</p>
<p>It was like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I was a product, and I was a product of the 90s,</p>
<p>which, if you listen to 90s music, it really was all,</p>
<p>a lot of reason that people say, well, 90s were terrible.</p>
<p>Like, a lot of people say that.</p>
<p>I love the 90s, they were my favorite decade of music.</p>
<p>It was, there was a lot of genre hopping,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know, I love that.</p>
<p>She had the, 90s had the boy bands,</p>
<p>and it had Pearl Jam, and Nirvana.</p>
<p>And it had a lot of, like, women of the 90s</p>
<p>was probably, is probably my biggest influence,</p>
<p>like, kind of that, like, angry rock women of the 90s,</p>
<p>like, Lannis Morissette, Jagged Little Pills,</p>
<p>one of my favorite records of all time.</p>
<p>The lyrics were so intimate,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if she was angry or not.</p>
<p>Sorry, if she wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there was an anger to it.</p>
<p>There was angst, yeah, it was like angstiness.</p>
<p>And that in hip hop of the 90s influences me,</p>
<p>and then my dad.</p>
<p>So, anything my dad listened to,</p>
<p>which my dad didn&rsquo;t listen to any of that.</p>
<p>My dad listened to, like, Harry Nelson and the Beatles,</p>
<p>Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Billy Joel.</p>
<p>It was very much like singer, songwriter.</p>
<p>Do you mind if we, throughout this,</p>
<p>listen to a few songs?</p>
<p>Because you mentioned Harry Nelson,</p>
<p>and I was actually, yesterday and the day before,</p>
<p>listening to a lot of his stuff,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, damn, he&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And not as known as he should be.</p>
<p>Like, I was getting, do you mind if I play?</p>
<p>No, please, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, not to open this conversation</p>
<p>to the love song.</p>
<p>I would like that, actually, Lex.</p>
<p>But Without You is an incredible song.</p>
<p>Oh, man, that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>And the heartbreak and the longing.</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t forget the feeling of your face.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best to do it, in my opinion.</p>
<p>In my opinion, he&rsquo;s the best to do it.</p>
<p>But I guess that&rsquo;s just the way the story goes.</p>
<p>And just the sadness of, like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something, I don&rsquo;t even wanna talk over him,</p>
<p>because this is one of my favorite songs, too,</p>
<p>but I think people have a really good bullshit indicator.</p>
<p>And music, in my opinion,</p>
<p>whenever I meet a young artist and say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m trying to make a new band,</p>
<p>and I wanna do something like how to be successful,</p>
<p>I really think understanding</p>
<p>that people have a really good bullshit indicator</p>
<p>is the most important part of being an artist.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain what that means, at least to me.</p>
<p>I think that in order to have success</p>
<p>or be a leader or whether it&rsquo;s an art or anything,</p>
<p>people need to believe that you believe what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I think the best actors,</p>
<p>really, when they&rsquo;re doing their thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they, it&rsquo;s not acting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in it, and it&rsquo;s how they feel,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re expressing that sorrow or joy or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Harry, for me, Harry Nilsen, I just believe it.</p>
<p>He sings that, and I feel it.</p>
<p>And whether he&rsquo;s the greatest bullshitter of all time,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>I think he probably was singing that song,</p>
<p>and he just could transport himself to wherever he was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what makes a great live act.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what makes a great song.</p>
<p>And someone could be the best actor</p>
<p>and sing that in the same timbre, same EQ,</p>
<p>same compression, same everything.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some unknown there that I,</p>
<p>I think, hopefully, it will be known at some point,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s some scientific thing,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something there, the energy or something,</p>
<p>that people can perceive it and say true or false.</p>
<p>And if it resonates as true, it&rsquo;s so much more meaningful,</p>
<p>and it lives on.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t, that, for me, is what is good art or bad.</p>
<p>For people to dispute over,</p>
<p>well, sonics should sound like that, silly to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a song or even a painting, like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the truthfulness of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the truly great art goes,</p>
<p>has to go to that place where you really are feeling it.</p>
<p>Like, you forget that you&rsquo;re being recorded.</p>
<p>You forget there&rsquo;s an audience.</p>
<p>You really are feeling it.</p>
<p>Yeah, which I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>One of the things that I love about the internet</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s brought the bullshit detector of the masses</p>
<p>to power, which is beautiful,</p>
<p>because then the masses uplift the really authentic.</p>
<p>And even if you didn&rsquo;t write the song,</p>
<p>I think it helps a lot, probably, if you wrote the song.</p>
<p>But I was a little bit, maybe a lot,</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re in Vegas, a little heartbroken</p>
<p>that to find out that Elvis didn&rsquo;t write his songs.</p>
<p>But I like, for example, Rocketman, Elton John,</p>
<p>like, to find out that Elton John didn&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>where the words of Rocketman came from,</p>
<p>meaning, like, the depths of it, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, he&rsquo;s super authentic,</p>
<p>because for Elton John and for Elvis,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something in the fun and the darkness</p>
<p>and the entertainment of it.</p>
<p>Like, he goes to someplace in his mind</p>
<p>that might not be deeply connected</p>
<p>from where the lyrics came from.</p>
<p>But he relates it.</p>
<p>He relates it to whatever is in his mind</p>
<p>and goes to that place emotionally.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s what I think it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why an actor, like I said,</p>
<p>can be completely honest to me.</p>
<p>Maybe they didn&rsquo;t write the script.</p>
<p>But I write, like, I&rsquo;ve always written all my own lyrics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really personal thing to me.</p>
<p>But I will say, I see people all the time</p>
<p>who are performers like Elton John, for instance,</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t write the lyrics that I believe</p>
<p>that it means just as much to them as what I wrote,</p>
<p>because they find the meaning in it for themself.</p>
<p>At least the greats do.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the difference maker.</p>
<p>And I think you can perceive,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen art that doesn&rsquo;t move you,</p>
<p>and maybe it moves someone else.</p>
<p>But for you, for some reason,</p>
<p>you perceive it to be uninteresting to you.</p>
<p>And I feel like a lot of the time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that it&rsquo;s, of course, sonically,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s uninteresting to you.</p>
<p>But I think the majority of the time, for myself,</p>
<p>I can find inspiration in any sonic value or painting</p>
<p>as long as I see it and I feel truth</p>
<p>from the person that created it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and for me, the lyrics,</p>
<p>maybe not the entirety of the lyrics,</p>
<p>but a few words can do wonders to take you to a place.</p>
<p>And sometimes those words don&rsquo;t need to be connected</p>
<p>with the other words.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of music.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re allowed to float in the space of mixed metaphors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re allowed to just jump around,</p>
<p>and somehow it paints a picture without actually,</p>
<p>what is it, glycerine by Bush?</p>
<p>Right, but it&rsquo;s also how the person says it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the feeling of exactly,</p>
<p>and the same person could say that word 10 other ways</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>But someone says glycerine or whatever it is,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, oh, you know what?</p>
<p>I feel that for some reason.</p>
<p>The way he said that, he meant it to me.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t forget this evening</p>
<p>or your face as you were leaving,</p>
<p>but I guess that&rsquo;s just the way the story goes.</p>
<p>You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows.</p>
<p>Yes, it shows.</p>
<p>Let me ask you to analyze this song.</p>
<p>Do you, so there&rsquo;s a lady possibly who&rsquo;s leaving him.</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;s leaving her or she&rsquo;s leaving him?</p>
<p>She went to.</p>
<p>When I think of all my sorrow, and I had you there,</p>
<p>but then I let you go.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s only fair that I should let you know</p>
<p>what you should know.</p>
<p>And then the chorus says, I can&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>if living is without you.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t live, I can&rsquo;t give anymore.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a voice on him.</p>
<p>Yeah, he does.</p>
<p>And if you really, there&rsquo;s been some incredible</p>
<p>documentation on his life and the end of his life.</p>
<p>And so my answer to this is probably skewed</p>
<p>based on what I&rsquo;ve seen about his life too,</p>
<p>but he was a real alcoholic at the end of his life</p>
<p>and it destroyed his voice and ended up killing him as well.</p>
<p>And so when I hear that, I perceive it as</p>
<p>someone who is destructive and in a destructive place</p>
<p>in life and can&rsquo;t love someone properly.</p>
<p>And so they can&rsquo;t live with them,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t live without them type thing,</p>
<p>which is really something that I really identify with</p>
<p>and I think is one of the struggles of life</p>
<p>is loving yourself enough, forgiving yourself for things</p>
<p>and letting yourself love someone else.</p>
<p>And at least when I listened out, I hear Harry being like,</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but this is how I perceive it at least</p>
<p>is not loving himself and feeling like he&rsquo;s deserving</p>
<p>of this person, like I have to let you go.</p>
<p>I hear that, of course, and people always say,</p>
<p>oh, well, he&rsquo;s breaking up with her,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much more complexity and nuance</p>
<p>to relationships than that and my wife and I</p>
<p>went through really difficult separation</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a story for another day</p>
<p>or different question or something,</p>
<p>but the nuance of it makes me think of this</p>
<p>when I hear this, which is there&rsquo;s just more</p>
<p>to being with someone or not being with someone</p>
<p>than hey, I think that person&rsquo;s really attractive</p>
<p>or hey, that person makes me laugh or not</p>
<p>or I love them and now I don&rsquo;t love them.</p>
<p>Love is such a complex, nuanced thing</p>
<p>that a lot of times, there&rsquo;s just more going on</p>
<p>behind the scenes, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, and a small tangent on that,</p>
<p>just as a curious question, have you paid any attention</p>
<p>to the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trials?</p>
<p>I have watched quite a bit of it</p>
<p>because my wife really loves it</p>
<p>and she watches it in bed at night.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s raw, to me it&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve mentioned how complicated love can be</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve never seen, I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about the celebrity nature of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it was, I don&rsquo;t care who it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just laid out in such raw form.</p>
<p>For the world to see it.</p>
<p>For the world to see the toxicity,</p>
<p>but also the passion and clearly the drugs</p>
<p>and the drinking, but also like the longing</p>
<p>and the dreams and I will always be with you,</p>
<p>I will die for you, the places, the rollercoaster of love</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all there at the end, past the end.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve also recently reread</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</p>
<p>about Hitler and Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the rise and the fall and it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>to look at the entirety of that process</p>
<p>after it&rsquo;s all over, many, many decades after it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>That book in particular written by the person</p>
<p>that was actually there and so here we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>two people in the context of the courtroom</p>
<p>analyzing this rise and fall of a love affair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>You know the truth is, I was telling my wife this actually</p>
<p>just the other day because she was asking me</p>
<p>what I thought about it.</p>
<p>It makes me really sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humorous, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of parts in it that are just really funny.</p>
<p>But I look at it and I also see the internet</p>
<p>and someone&rsquo;s always the villain and someone&rsquo;s the hero</p>
<p>which is such a funny thing and we talked a little</p>
<p>about this offline before we got on this</p>
<p>but I have a real firm belief in life</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just more complex than you think, always, always.</p>
<p>Johnny for instance is very charismatic</p>
<p>and you love him and he&rsquo;s funny and the way he does things</p>
<p>and he looks certain ways and he says things.</p>
<p>You really love him and I feel like,</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;m wrong on this but it looks like</p>
<p>the internet is really, Johnny is the winner,</p>
<p>Amber is the villain and I kind of look at it</p>
<p>and I feel like, were any of you in their bedroom?</p>
<p>Were any of you there for these things?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying one way or the other.</p>
<p>All I see when I look at that is two people</p>
<p>with a lot of deep seeded hurt, anger</p>
<p>and that anger is so poisonous to both of them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting through it in the way</p>
<p>that they only know how and I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t be able to look at parts of it</p>
<p>and laugh about it and stuff and be virtuous or something</p>
<p>but just that there&rsquo;s not a hero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more complicated.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think unless you&rsquo;ve been living with Amber</p>
<p>and Johnny, you don&rsquo;t know and just because</p>
<p>one seems more charismatic in the moment</p>
<p>or funnier or more believable even,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that their truth is the truth.</p>
<p>And I feel like there&rsquo;s still love there too,</p>
<p>which makes the whole thing.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the hardest part.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t even look at her.</p>
<p>He looks down the whole time and maybe people say,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s because anger or hurt or whatever</p>
<p>but the way that she looks and stuff,</p>
<p>it just feels like there&rsquo;s so much hurt there</p>
<p>that it hurts me to watch it.</p>
<p>I just feel like, oh, my heart just aches for them</p>
<p>and for both of them and I don&rsquo;t know either of them</p>
<p>personally and I don&rsquo;t know, just hurts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen love laid out in this raw kind of way.</p>
<p>It makes me feel better about,</p>
<p>it almost gives you, seeing people have gone through</p>
<p>a struggle in this sort of mundane kind of way,</p>
<p>gives you room to struggle yourself</p>
<p>about the messiness of love.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re supposed to,</p>
<p>like relationship is supposed to be simple and whatever</p>
<p>but this like, oh, man, this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like art.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And for the record, I don&rsquo;t feel like it shouldn&rsquo;t be shown.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually really beautiful art</p>
<p>and I agree there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of people</p>
<p>who walk away from it and are changed in certain ways</p>
<p>or look at things different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s changed in the whole world,</p>
<p>the Johnny Depp trial, but it&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like you would look at a painting</p>
<p>and it might affect you.</p>
<p>My only commentary is more that there&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s silly when people say who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s wrong and who&rsquo;s the clear villain and who&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>like we love as human, we have to have an answer for every,</p>
<p>we have to put everything in a box.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, we&rsquo;re looking at this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re deciding you&rsquo;re right and you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And I just think it&rsquo;s silly unless it&rsquo;s your life.</p>
<p>So speaking of heroes and villains and highs and lows,</p>
<p>you grew up in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>And you said that Vegas is a performing town,</p>
<p>a town of high stakes, drama and eccentricity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a town of high highs and low lows.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be damned if my therapist didn&rsquo;t point out</p>
<p>that correlation out to me personally a long time ago.</p>
<p>So to me, Vegas from the outside is romanticized</p>
<p>by certain movies.</p>
<p>The lows define the beauty of this town.</p>
<p>And certain movies, so to me, Casino with Robert De Niro,</p>
<p>Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone, leaving Las Vegas</p>
<p>with Nicolas Cage, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</p>
<p>with the Johnny Depp play, Hunter S. Thompson.</p>
<p>First of all, what&rsquo;s your favorite representation</p>
<p>of Vegas from a darker side?</p>
<p>And do you draw any wisdom insight from the darkness,</p>
<p>the lows and the highs in those movies?</p>
<p>Or is it over romanticized?</p>
<p>So I grew up in a really conservative Mormon family.</p>
<p>And Vegas was established by the Mormons and the mob.</p>
<p>Those were like the two very different worlds</p>
<p>that created what Vegas is.</p>
<p>And if you live in Vegas, it really shows in a lot of ways</p>
<p>because Vegas has the strip and the parties</p>
<p>and the craziness.</p>
<p>But it also has very neighborhoods and big families</p>
<p>and conservative people and liberal people living together</p>
<p>in a really interesting way.</p>
<p>And for me, growing up here, for instance,</p>
<p>was a lot of driving on the freeway,</p>
<p>my mom being like, children, close your eyes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a naked woman on that billboard and everything.</p>
<p>Okay, mom, on our way to church.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It was like, but also being like, whoa, this is crazy.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like taking in whatever I could when I could.</p>
<p>So I saw, and I&rsquo;m grateful for that.</p>
<p>Like, I really love that I didn&rsquo;t grow up as a Mormon</p>
<p>in for instance, like Utah or something,</p>
<p>like the typical place, because I saw both sides</p>
<p>and I appreciated something from both sides.</p>
<p>And now as a person now who&rsquo;s not religious,</p>
<p>but just spiritually minded,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m grateful for that divergent character,</p>
<p>that juxtaposition, dual edged sword that Vegas is.</p>
<p>And I try to apply that to everything in life,</p>
<p>which is like Johnny Depp and Amber.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s two sides to every story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always two sides to every coin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always, and there&rsquo;s something to be said for both.</p>
<p>Like I try to see people and even if, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, yeah, I try to apply that to life.</p>
<p>As far as a movie that personifies Vegas</p>
<p>or something in that medium that personifies Vegas</p>
<p>in a way that resonates with me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say Hangover.</p>
<p>No, no, yeah.</p>
<p>I also like, I wasn&rsquo;t even allowed to watch</p>
<p>PG 13 movies growing up.</p>
<p>So a lot of the movies that you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>like I either didn&rsquo;t see, I didn&rsquo;t have cable television.</p>
<p>You know, I wasn&rsquo;t like a pilgrim,</p>
<p>but I had a really, really conservative upbringing.</p>
<p>So it didn&rsquo;t define your intellectual like development.</p>
<p>No, no, I just, I can&rsquo;t think of any movie</p>
<p>that comes to mind where I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s my Vegas movie.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen some of the movies you&rsquo;ve said now,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t think of one that I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>actually personifies Vegas in a way that feels honest to me.</p>
<p>Like, or like, wasn&rsquo;t there a Chevy,</p>
<p>was there a Chevy Chase?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s maybe the only one I thought of</p>
<p>that came to mind where I was like,</p>
<p>cause I love Chevy Chase so much</p>
<p>that maybe it&rsquo;s one of his Vegas vacation or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, but that&rsquo;s more like lighthearted surge,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s not like, I guess what I would say</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s no truth that has been, that I&rsquo;ve seen of Vegas.</p>
<p>Cause what I see of Vegas is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obviously like the parties and stuff</p>
<p>and the nightlife, which I&rsquo;m not big party person.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I haven&rsquo;t really experienced much of that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also drugs and I have a strange relationship</p>
<p>with drugs because I&rsquo;ve lost a few friends</p>
<p>to drug overdoses.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not romantic to me,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also like, yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>you asked for a dark reflection of it.</p>
<p>I guess I certainly see a dark reflection to Vegas.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, I feel like Vegas is typically personified</p>
<p>as like at the tables and everything.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also like, I have like friends</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve lost all their money to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, what I guess the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, somebody maybe needs to make,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s an open spot.</p>
<p>There needs to be a dark side to Vegas.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s about Mormons in Vegas,</p>
<p>dying to drug overdose or getting shot by the mob.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you mentioned your spirituality.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, you said that having a crisis of faith</p>
<p>or just the philosophical question of asking who is God,</p>
<p>does God exist?</p>
<p>Or in thinking of the flip side of that,</p>
<p>of mortality, what happens when we die?</p>
<p>Those kinds of things were extremely difficult,</p>
<p>deep things for you in terms of your development,</p>
<p>the whole process of figuring that out.</p>
<p>Why does it hurt so much to lose faith in God?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say that the seeking of God,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that, is an obsession for me</p>
<p>and has been since I was young.</p>
<p>I really feel that I&rsquo;m a deep, deep,</p>
<p>deeply committed to finding answers in life.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some answers that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an answer to.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also very OCD by nature,</p>
<p>so I just don&rsquo;t give up to that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, there must be somewhere in Tibet,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some teacher or there&rsquo;s somebody out there</p>
<p>that has the answer,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s yet to be found, I&rsquo;m gonna find it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really, my life has been to date</p>
<p>probably unhealthily committed to finding answers</p>
<p>about God or the lack thereof and mortality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all I sing about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all our records have been about.</p>
<p>Who do you think is God?</p>
<p>Have you ever gotten a glimpse?</p>
<p>You know, I will say the closest I feel like</p>
<p>I have been to experiencing God is,</p>
<p>and this sounds so, maybe, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it sounds,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s through ayahuasca for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my honest answer for you.</p>
<p>I feel like I had pretty much given up all hope</p>
<p>of there being anything greater than, you know,</p>
<p>us being, you know, evolving and being here and then dying</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gone and that&rsquo;s it and nothingness</p>
<p>and from nothingness we came and nothingness we go.</p>
<p>To where I am now, which is there are answers to be found.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know them.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know what God looks like</p>
<p>or if God has anything to do with the word God</p>
<p>and the way that we say it,</p>
<p>but I do believe pretty fervently</p>
<p>that there is more to be found.</p>
<p>Is it motion sensor or no?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that was.</p>
<p>Looked like they&rsquo;ve all died, actually.</p>
<p>Do you know which one of it?</p>
<p>Is it this one right here?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I just take it out, but then it&rsquo;d be too dark.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Take it out.</p>
<p>Do you want to hold this chair?</p>
<p>See if I can get it like this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Almost there.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m gonna catch this though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be like something saying about this.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my Chinese proverb.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>How many people does it take to,</p>
<p>what is it, unscrew a light bulb?</p>
<p>A light bulb.</p>
<p>It was hot too.</p>
<p>It was like I was doing the two finger technique.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad you survived that.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be pretty ironic if we&rsquo;re talking about mortality</p>
<p>and then this would be it for you.</p>
<p>In that moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done ayahuasca, so it&rsquo;s a mixture of two plants.</p>
<p>One of them is DMT, but a lot of people I really respect.</p>
<p>Very, very intelligent people had profound experiences</p>
<p>with ayahuasca.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Where do you go?</p>
<p>Where does the mind go?</p>
<p>What the heck is up with that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll first say that I can&rsquo;t even smoke weed.</p>
<p>I really do not enjoy it because I hate to let go of control.</p>
<p>If I feel out of control in life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one of my biggest weaknesses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like very scary for me.</p>
<p>And some people really enjoy letting go in that way.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I was pretty terrified to make the jump then to ayahuasca.</p>
<p>But my wife who I deeply respect</p>
<p>made a profound change through ayahuasca.</p>
<p>And I saw it.</p>
<p>She led the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t a strange, like I think most,</p>
<p>we have a thing in America that&rsquo;s like a misconception,</p>
<p>a stigma on psychedelics where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a drug and it makes some people crazy.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re gonna be on the street</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be out of your mind</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna become like a crazy person basically.</p>
<p>And I think I really bought into that notion</p>
<p>because again, I was raised,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even raised with cable TV.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like ayahuasca is very, I didn&rsquo;t, you know.</p>
<p>You can imagine what that was like for a Mormon kid.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know anything about it</p>
<p>and I never touched drugs at all</p>
<p>and never even touched a cigarette, you know.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I think we have this misconception about it</p>
<p>where Americans are quick to go to their doctor</p>
<p>and take any medication or drug,</p>
<p>but you know, whoa, when it comes to like psychedelics.</p>
<p>Anyway, that being said,</p>
<p>so I had that trepidation going into it,</p>
<p>but I really love and respect my wife</p>
<p>and I saw it make a profound impact in her life</p>
<p>where she suddenly was able to heal</p>
<p>from a lot of trauma that she had.</p>
<p>She had a really, she went through a lot in her life</p>
<p>and it really helped her heal,</p>
<p>but it also set her in a new path spiritually</p>
<p>that seemed really like a place that I wanted to be.</p>
<p>So I did it and I did it twice.</p>
<p>The first time it didn&rsquo;t really have an effect on me,</p>
<p>which happens to a lot of people, I guess.</p>
<p>I drank this little thing</p>
<p>and there was like this shaman who came over from overseas</p>
<p>that was really, had been in the plant world for decades</p>
<p>and was a really incredible,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if he likes to be called shaman, but.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s supposed to be like 30, 60 minute to take effect</p>
<p>and a few hours, the journey lasts.</p>
<p>About four hours. Four hours.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the second time I took it,</p>
<p>I took it in, I would say 20, 30 minutes in exactly.</p>
<p>I started to feel like I was like the dimension</p>
<p>of what is reality, the curtain was pulled open</p>
<p>and there was a lot more to discover</p>
<p>and it really blew my mind in a way</p>
<p>that I think it would probably blow anybody&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>if for instance, God descended or some Christian God</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>We all think it&rsquo;d be this beautiful thing,</p>
<p>but in reality, it would probably make people super fearful</p>
<p>and think that they&rsquo;ve lost their mind.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve always, yeah, I&rsquo;ve always like joked</p>
<p>that if the Mormon God came down and told my mom like,</p>
<p>if God himself came down and told my mom,</p>
<p>Mormonism is incorrect, she would say, Satan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re never,</p>
<p>I think our minds are just not prepared</p>
<p>for a lot of anything that&rsquo;s really extreme</p>
<p>and it was very extreme.</p>
<p>It was like the curtain of life was cut open,</p>
<p>which scared me, but then I felt very much</p>
<p>and a lot of people that I&rsquo;ve talked to</p>
<p>have a similar thing where I felt very much</p>
<p>like I was either communicating with something</p>
<p>that was perceived as God to me</p>
<p>or highest sense of self or mind or mother earth</p>
<p>or you know, it&rsquo;s called so many different names,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s very, a lot of people</p>
<p>have a very spiritual, similar experience with ayahuasca.</p>
<p>And just in that, it&rsquo;s like this kind of profoundness.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like, there was nothing at least for me</p>
<p>that was, that felt like just like psychedelic,</p>
<p>funny cartoons or something.</p>
<p>It was like, I&rsquo;m about to go on a journey</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna communicate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m communicating with something that feels incredibly wise,</p>
<p>showed me a lot of things in my life,</p>
<p>kind of almost like from a bird&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>almost like I was looking through a video camera</p>
<p>at a younger me.</p>
<p>There was a particular thing that it communicated to me.</p>
<p>I really have a hard time with accepting success</p>
<p>and not feeling like feeling undeserving or something.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite put it into words,</p>
<p>but of my position and what I&rsquo;ve been given,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been given so much.</p>
<p>And it showed me this thing from when I was young</p>
<p>and explained to me why I am where I am now.</p>
<p>And I, to this day, it did not feel like myself</p>
<p>telling myself that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way I can explain it.</p>
<p>And there was a lot more that it showed me</p>
<p>and that was incredibly healing for me.</p>
<p>But just to be like, to put it into a short thing</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much to this.</p>
<p>It felt, I walked away feeling very convinced</p>
<p>that there is more to be known, for sure.</p>
<p>And a lot of my deep things that were traumatic for me</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t feel traumatic anymore,</p>
<p>specifically crisis of faith.</p>
<p>I was very angry at my parents and my community</p>
<p>for raising me in what I perceived to be falsehoods.</p>
<p>And that, I felt like the bedrock of everything I believed</p>
<p>was ripped out for me in my 20s.</p>
<p>And then it was like, good luck in life.</p>
<p>But really my parents had given me everything</p>
<p>that they could.</p>
<p>And they believed that very much so, still.</p>
<p>But a naive young me was angry</p>
<p>and felt like they had been duped</p>
<p>and thus I had been duped.</p>
<p>But Ayahuasca really showed me this roadmap of like,</p>
<p>this is truth and you&rsquo;re concerning yourself</p>
<p>about a grain of sand, which is Mormonism or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And there may be some truths in that tiny grain of sand</p>
<p>and there may be falsities.</p>
<p>But so is all these other grains of sand,</p>
<p>like focus on the truth.</p>
<p>Stop focusing on these little details that are meaningless</p>
<p>and forgive and let go of people believing</p>
<p>in those things to begin with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that makes sense,</p>
<p>but that was like the core thing I was taught</p>
<p>and to let go of control, stop needing to control everything.</p>
<p>And it felt like the wisdom was coming from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s really, I do not believe,</p>
<p>at least in my current self, I don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>the mindfulness that I believe that exists in me</p>
<p>to reach a lot of the conclusions that I did.</p>
<p>And there was a lot more to it</p>
<p>that would be for like a late night conversation with you.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so hard to put it into,</p>
<p>you feel like a crazy person.</p>
<p>Any, at least anytime I talk about ayahuasca</p>
<p>to someone who hasn&rsquo;t done it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin.</p>
<p>Like, how do you explain to someone</p>
<p>that you felt like that a multiple dimension type thing</p>
<p>happened in a way that like putting it into words is,</p>
<p>and none of it was words, by the way,</p>
<p>that was communicated to me.</p>
<p>It was like, you know how people talk about telepathy.</p>
<p>And if it existed, it would be like,</p>
<p>I could communicate to you in such a deeper way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so confined by me having to articulate these words</p>
<p>and put them in a sentence to you, Lex,</p>
<p>and then tell you like, if only I could just be like,</p>
<p>and emotions do that sometimes, right?</p>
<p>You could see my emotions and be like,</p>
<p>oh, that communicates a lot.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what it felt like to me with ayahuasca</p>
<p>is it felt like it was communicating to me very clear things,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t like, Daniel, it&rsquo;s me, Mother Earth.</p>
<p>Let me relax, sit back, let me show you.</p>
<p>But it was very clear to me what was being said.</p>
<p>And no, it did not feel like me,</p>
<p>but maybe smarter people than me who&rsquo;ve done it would say,</p>
<p>well, it was you and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it was very convincing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff in that subconscious</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t explored.</p>
<p>Like we haven&rsquo;t explored the depths of the ocean.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t really figured out what&rsquo;s that,</p>
<p>the younging shadow, what&rsquo;s going on underneath</p>
<p>the surface of our conscious mind.</p>
<p>And what is that connecting to?</p>
<p>Is that just inside our mind or is it some kind of,</p>
<p>is there some kind of collective intelligence going on</p>
<p>where all humans are connected</p>
<p>to one kind of greater organism?</p>
<p>Like what is consciousness?</p>
<p>We have a lot of hubris in thinking we understand</p>
<p>any of it, like how the mind works at all.</p>
<p>Like what is it, like where,</p>
<p>what is the origin of consciousness?</p>
<p>What is the origin of intelligence?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of hubris about this.</p>
<p>We give each other PhDs and Nobel prizes</p>
<p>and congratulate ourselves as if we figured it all out.</p>
<p>But humility is helpful here.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that is the question</p>
<p>that humans have been asking for</p>
<p>ever since humans were humans,</p>
<p>which is the question of mortality, the question of God.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s Hamlet to be or not to be,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the hardest, the most important question.</p>
<p>Albert Camus asked, why live?</p>
<p>So in terms of crisis of faith,</p>
<p>in terms of your search for truth,</p>
<p>in terms of some of the dark places</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gone in your mind,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a good answer to this question?</p>
<p>So for Camus with Mithos Sisyphus,</p>
<p>it was the question of suicide.</p>
<p>Is, what&rsquo;s the purpose?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s a good answer to why keep going,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re struggling,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re feeling hopeless,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re feeling like a burden in this search for truth,</p>
<p>where you feel like you&rsquo;re surrounded by lies,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a good answer to why live?</p>
<p>You ever found one?</p>
<p>Well, the simple answer right now is to say for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy once you have kids to say,</p>
<p>the right answer is you just,</p>
<p>of course you brought these kids into the world,</p>
<p>so you have a responsibility that I feel deeply as a father</p>
<p>to them to always be there for as long as I humanly can</p>
<p>and to take care of them and protect them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most innate sense in me,</p>
<p>just, it&rsquo;s wired in my animal existence.</p>
<p>So if I take that away, right,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s kind of cheating.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put that aside because it is cheating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still some fundamental way in which you&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And to that, that actually has been a real struggle for me</p>
<p>for many years.</p>
<p>I had a real turning point early in my career</p>
<p>where we were flying somewhere overseas</p>
<p>and we were in a really small plane</p>
<p>and the lights went out</p>
<p>and like all these red lights were flashing</p>
<p>and the plane just started to dive.</p>
<p>Completely like scariest plane experience I&rsquo;ve ever been in.</p>
<p>My manager was next to me, who&rsquo;s my brother.</p>
<p>He was crying and texting his wife a goodbye.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how like crazy this moment was.</p>
<p>Was it real like genuine?</p>
<p>Like genuine engine went out, plane is going down,</p>
<p>pilots looking like crazy in the front</p>
<p>and it was a really tiny jet.</p>
<p>And like I said, my brother next to me crying,</p>
<p>typing a text to his wife.</p>
<p>Really, really scary.</p>
<p>And I felt nothing.</p>
<p>I genuinely sat there and I was like,</p>
<p>this might actually be nice.</p>
<p>Like I really felt like this goes down</p>
<p>and like, ah man, life sucks and it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And that sounds so ridiculous I know to say</p>
<p>because again, I&rsquo;m in a different place now</p>
<p>and I see my life for what it is.</p>
<p>But at that moment I did not.</p>
<p>So life was primarily defined by suffering,</p>
<p>it was a burden.</p>
<p>It was, I felt I was incredibly depressed.</p>
<p>I had been trying different medications since I was young</p>
<p>and I just had not found anything that was working for me.</p>
<p>And then I was in a faith crisis, lost all my faith,</p>
<p>started a band that&rsquo;s just became,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t ever thinking that this band.</p>
<p>I was like, when you call your band Imagine Dragons,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking that band&rsquo;s gonna be big, okay?</p>
<p>It was like, I was like,</p>
<p>this was like a side project that was fun for me.</p>
<p>It was like art in college.</p>
<p>I was in school and I was like,</p>
<p>man, I hate this biology class.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna write down band names.</p>
<p>Like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like it was not, hey, put everything aside,</p>
<p>this is my career, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Like it just, it happened.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m an introvert by nature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not an extroverted person</p>
<p>who likes to go out and like,</p>
<p>I like to be at home with a couple of friends</p>
<p>and have a late night conversation over good food.</p>
<p>Like that to me is a perfect night.</p>
<p>Read a good book, listen to a podcast, go on a walk.</p>
<p>You know, those are things that I really, really enjoy.</p>
<p>And suddenly I&rsquo;m in this life where I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>supposed to be something that I really don&rsquo;t wanna be.</p>
<p>Except for on stage, which is a really fast,</p>
<p>like strange thing to me, which is on stage,</p>
<p>I feel so free and exuberant and like an extrovert.</p>
<p>And then I come off and I just feel like</p>
<p>shrivel back into a shell.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, music does that for me</p>
<p>and performing on a stage does that for me.</p>
<p>Can we take a small tangent on that?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the high,</p>
<p>can we go through that the introvert</p>
<p>that wants to cuddle up and read a book?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the front man of one of the,</p>
<p>if not the biggest rock bands today,</p>
<p>playing in front of huge crowds.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the high of that and how can you land back on Earth?</p>
<p>The high of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredibly beautiful</p>
<p>to walk on a stage,</p>
<p>sing these songs that you wrote</p>
<p>and see it resonate with people around you</p>
<p>and sing with them.</p>
<p>Different cultures, different places,</p>
<p>celebrate life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s suddenly the world seems like a fantastic place.</p>
<p>It feels like we&rsquo;re all on the same team.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one big hug.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like everybody in that room gets it</p>
<p>and they all, like it just,</p>
<p>it feels like what you want the world to be,</p>
<p>which is just like this coexisting unit of people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not even about like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible, for sure, it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>and I love it and I wouldn&rsquo;t do it unless I loved it.</p>
<p>And then you walk off stage and you turn on the news</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you see, we&rsquo;re all against each other,</p>
<p>everybody hates each other</p>
<p>and it feels that way in the world.</p>
<p>So music really, that&rsquo;s why live music is so important</p>
<p>to people, that&rsquo;s why music is so important to people.</p>
<p>Because even if it&rsquo;s just you and that person</p>
<p>that wrote the song, you&rsquo;re listening to it</p>
<p>and the two of you feel connected.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re hearing Tracy Chapman</p>
<p>sing like Fast Car or something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like, oh my gosh, like yes, I get it.</p>
<p>And you feel connected to that person, you don&rsquo;t feel alone.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the high of it, for sure.</p>
<p>And then you get off stage and then, you know,</p>
<p>as my, like my uncle is a heart surgeon,</p>
<p>incredible heart surgeon who like writes the book.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s like the guy that the heart surgeons talk to,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s out of Nashville, Tennessee,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just an incredible genius man.</p>
<p>He always worries and always reached out to me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, musicians die all the time</p>
<p>and the reason they die, you know,</p>
<p>is because you&rsquo;re getting on stage</p>
<p>and your heart&rsquo;s doing this</p>
<p>and your cortisol levels are doing this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting off stage and then you&rsquo;re just doing this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really real thing.</p>
<p>Like you get off stage and you feel like you need drugs</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, the world feels like,</p>
<p>oh, incredibly daunting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, I&rsquo;m sure, has to do with like</p>
<p>some like health things in your heart</p>
<p>and the cortisol levels that are so crazy</p>
<p>and then you come off and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I know people are like, well, then nothing&rsquo;s enough,</p>
<p>except meth, you know what I mean, right?</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s enough except heroin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a lot of artists turn to that stuff.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t say it in a preachy way,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve struggled with drug abuse in my life.</p>
<p>And I really, I understand why artists turn to it.</p>
<p>But also the fact that you&rsquo;re an introvert.</p>
<p>So the other side of it, the fame.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that you also said</p>
<p>is a double edged sword for you.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about fame,</p>
<p>is that you also mentioned,</p>
<p>is it something you can&rsquo;t take back?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing, you can&rsquo;t just like go on vacation</p>
<p>in Hawaii and it&rsquo;s like, consider, do I like it or not?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re staying in Hawaii for the rest of your life</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve never been there before,</p>
<p>whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that like being loved by millions</p>
<p>and millions and millions of people,</p>
<p>which is perhaps the best kind of fame</p>
<p>in terms of if you have to choose the kinds of fame</p>
<p>that there are.</p>
<p>And still being an introvert and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So what, do you feel alone?</p>
<p>More alone being famous?</p>
<p>Is there a loneliness to it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s such a funny thing.</p>
<p>Okay, if you had asked,</p>
<p>if we were having this conversation a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be incredibly guarded about this</p>
<p>because the last thing I wanna ever do</p>
<p>is sound ungrateful or unaware of how much I have</p>
<p>and woe is the famous celebrity with money.</p>
<p>Oh, is your life hard?</p>
<p>Is it really telling me about how hard it is?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also at a place in life now</p>
<p>where I just like, I&rsquo;m gonna always just speak my truth</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only reason I&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m here to speak my truth to you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna tell you my truth,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s whatever it is.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re human and feelings are real.</p>
<p>And so, and that&rsquo;s the interesting thing.</p>
<p>You win a lottery, what&rsquo;s that gonna feel like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about complaining, oh, it&rsquo;s so hard to win a lottery</p>
<p>because you get a lot of money.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s still, you&rsquo;re human.</p>
<p>You get to experience these feelings and it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>You put humans in different situations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also fascinating because a lot of people think,</p>
<p>well, I would like to be famous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big thing now on social media and Instagram</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>The whole world wants to be famous.</p>
<p>Or rich or famous.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s very interesting to think, all right,</p>
<p>well, once you arrive, are all the problems solved?</p>
<p>No, yeah.</p>
<p>So I will tell you, according to me,</p>
<p>what the pitfalls are, whether it&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>And there are certainly some pitfalls.</p>
<p>One, it&rsquo;s once you&rsquo;re there, you can&rsquo;t go back.</p>
<p>Whatever, maybe that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Cause maybe you love it.</p>
<p>But the real pitfall for me is that you&rsquo;re now you&rsquo;re Lex</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re what everybody&rsquo;s perception is that Lex is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you are.</p>
<p>Now Lex is probably a lot more complex and complicated</p>
<p>and has a lot more to Lex than the Lex</p>
<p>that is the celebrity.</p>
<p>So, but anybody who meets you, that&rsquo;s who you are to them.</p>
<p>And you may, you may not feel this way,</p>
<p>but you may feel confined to actually have to be that person</p>
<p>to that person.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve early in my career for a long time,</p>
<p>anytime I met someone, I suddenly felt like I had to be</p>
<p>Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons.</p>
<p>Anytime I met someone, including my family now,</p>
<p>who are also like, whoa, this is crazy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons.</p>
<p>And I wanted to just be the goofball</p>
<p>that I have been my whole life with my brothers and family.</p>
<p>But suddenly I found myself feeling like,</p>
<p>no, I have to be this.</p>
<p>Like, cause that&rsquo;s who, that&rsquo;s who this is.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re almost like playing a role.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of actors talk about this</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll take on a role and then it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>they feel like they have to, they like become that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really scary thing.</p>
<p>Like you alter who you are almost</p>
<p>to fit the notion of other people.</p>
<p>Cause especially if a lot of artists are empaths,</p>
<p>it, you know, a lot of people get into art</p>
<p>in a deep way are empaths.</p>
<p>And so you feel a lot of what people are feeling</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re never wanting to burden people.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re always wanting to deliver to that person,</p>
<p>you know, what they want is like people pleasing is very,</p>
<p>goes hand in hand with a lot of like these famous people.</p>
<p>And they get to where they were</p>
<p>because they know how to do that.</p>
<p>They know how to be in a room with someone</p>
<p>and look them in the eye and make them feel</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re the only person in the room.</p>
<p>And then now they got that role in that movie</p>
<p>because they sat with the casting director</p>
<p>and they were like, oh, you&rsquo;re so funny.</p>
<p>Oh, has anybody told, like put on the charisma,</p>
<p>do it all.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, anyway, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going on a different tangent here,</p>
<p>but long story short, there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>that are really unhealthy about it.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people who want the fame,</p>
<p>then the second it starts to go away,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re like, who am I anymore?</p>
<p>Like that was everything.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m like on the down</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m not a famous person anymore.</p>
<p>And now I hate myself and I&rsquo;m going to do drugs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like this vicious cycle,</p>
<p>like you could never be famous enough.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always going to get like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just so much to it that I&rsquo;ve just,</p>
<p>and again, like I&rsquo;ve lost friends</p>
<p>in this career to do that for sure.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain element to sort of just</p>
<p>on the losing fame of interacting with a lot of folks,</p>
<p>especially young folks like on YouTube.</p>
<p>So fame is a thing that has levels.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always trying to be a little more famous.</p>
<p>A lot of folks who are chasing fame,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter how famous you are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always trying to chase more.</p>
<p>And when you start to lose it,</p>
<p>interesting things can happen if you&rsquo;re not self aware,</p>
<p>which is like, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>you might be trying to grasp back at where you were</p>
<p>by leaning into the formula that got you there.</p>
<p>And so the constraints of the image that you mentioned</p>
<p>becomes the thing that you&rsquo;re now trying to lean into.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually walking away from who you really are.</p>
<p>Like you lean further into being that person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for acting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for even on like YouTube,</p>
<p>which is people acting, they have a role.</p>
<p>They got them to the table somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s dark, but I think those are,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just put for everybody to see,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a very human struggle even when you&rsquo;re not famous.</p>
<p>Finding yourself, being yourself,</p>
<p>of not letting, not doing the people pleasing at any scale</p>
<p>and being trapped by that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also feeling like it&rsquo;s never enough.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something all, like it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>a famous thing, but it&rsquo;s like in the whole,</p>
<p>like everybody deals with feeling like</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>
<p>When I get that job, I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>
<p>When I have that money, then I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>
<p>When I get that surgery and my nose looks like this,</p>
<p>I will be happy then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a constant chase of happiness instead of happiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the opposite, it&rsquo;s opposite of self love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the opposite of happiness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no presence to it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constant, you&rsquo;re never going to find it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna arrive and you&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>live your life and then you&rsquo;re gonna be on your death bed</p>
<p>and be like, I was chasing the wrong thing my whole life.</p>
<p>I should say that podcasts are interesting in that way.</p>
<p>So for me personally, because you just talk a lot,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t, people that meet you, they know you</p>
<p>and they know the evolution of you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same thing for like you right now,</p>
<p>Dan of Imagine Dragons, just being on a podcast</p>
<p>like long form reveals a side that liberates you more</p>
<p>to be yourself, to like, people see, oh, there&rsquo;s a human.</p>
<p>They, cause they, music, they have a deep connection</p>
<p>with you, they have experiences with you</p>
<p>the way they experienced it and that&rsquo;s who you are</p>
<p>with them through the songs.</p>
<p>But now you get to see, oh, that&rsquo;s a human being.</p>
<p>He probably gets angry, he gets sad, he&rsquo;s excited,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hopeful and there&rsquo;s a core, there&rsquo;s a good human being</p>
<p>with the whole roller coaster of emotions all there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant, beautiful mess.</p>
<p>And podcasts reveal that, that&rsquo;s why I love podcasts</p>
<p>like long form, you get to hear some artists and actors</p>
<p>and so on and some of them you get to see, oh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve lost yourself in the surface.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tragedy with some actors, some great actors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve left so much of themselves in the roles</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve played that they can no longer be the thing</p>
<p>they were before, those great roles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure, it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s hard to see.</p>
<p>So you get to see that with Johnny Depp with,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Pirates, he was talking about that</p>
<p>with Pirates of the Caribbean, that was a shift.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s not that guy, he&rsquo;s forever, forever that guy.</p>
<p>But the point is to remember that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>into your family, which is interesting you said</p>
<p>with your family, when I see people close to me,</p>
<p>they also, there is an element like that</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re that, they start treating you</p>
<p>like the famous person.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m fortunate to have my manager who&rsquo;s my brother,</p>
<p>my older brother, and my lawyer is my other older brother.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been helpful because it&rsquo;s weird,</p>
<p>it gets weird with everyone no matter what.</p>
<p>One of the best advice I was given was by Charlie Sheen.</p>
<p>You got advice from Charlie Sheen.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were playing.</p>
<p>The wise sage of our generation.</p>
<p>Wise sage Charlie Sheen, but it was, it was really wise.</p>
<p>I was sitting next to him and we were playing</p>
<p>some late night television and he said,</p>
<p>this was right at the beginning, and he just said,</p>
<p>boys, just mark my words, your life is about</p>
<p>to get really weird, that&rsquo;s all he said.</p>
<p>But it stuck with me forever and it&rsquo;s Charlie Sheen,</p>
<p>so of course it sticks with you.</p>
<p>And I remember being like, right, okay, Charlie Sheen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not Charlie Sheen, it&rsquo;s not gonna get weird,</p>
<p>like, you know.</p>
<p>But it got really, really weird, really quick,</p>
<p>because suddenly you&rsquo;ve existed your whole life</p>
<p>in this way where everybody just,</p>
<p>everything you get, you achieved,</p>
<p>it was because you got it.</p>
<p>And every conversation you had, like,</p>
<p>if someone liked you at the end of that conversation,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s because they liked you.</p>
<p>If they didn&rsquo;t like you, it&rsquo;s because they didn&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p>And you can make complete peace with that.</p>
<p>At least I could my whole life.</p>
<p>I was like, life is a challenge.</p>
<p>And be myself and I&rsquo;m gonna go through it</p>
<p>and find some people along the way that I connect with</p>
<p>and others, no.</p>
<p>And that social integrity is so important to us.</p>
<p>And we think it would be nice to have this,</p>
<p>and this is going back to the pitfalls of fame.</p>
<p>We think it would be nice to walk into a room</p>
<p>and have everyone be like,</p>
<p>and you could be like, dumpster fire.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s like, oh my gosh, dumpster fire,</p>
<p>that was amazing.</p>
<p>Well, you said dumpster fire was amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s incredibly, incredibly lonely.</p>
<p>And it just breaks everything that you knew about humanness.</p>
<p>And it sucks.</p>
<p>So then you&rsquo;re seeking out people who,</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t exist with.</p>
<p>And family is the closest you can get to that for sure.</p>
<p>But even your family, it&rsquo;s gonna take a little bit</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re like, oh, this is a little weird.</p>
<p>Like all my friends at work are now asking about you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re my young, stupid brother.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;re suddenly like the young, stupid brother</p>
<p>that they want an autograph from and stuff.</p>
<p>And it still makes, like they have to get over that</p>
<p>and figure that out.</p>
<p>And then you meet people too</p>
<p>who know about this whole concept and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m gonna be an asshole to him</p>
<p>to show him that I don&rsquo;t subscribe.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re dealing with like people who are like,</p>
<p>dumpster fire, the person who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you could say something actually profound and nice</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d be like, that&rsquo;s stupid and you&rsquo;re an idiot.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like an actual attempt to like show you</p>
<p>how much they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>So you live in this very, like this.</p>
<p>Still, nevertheless, even when nobody knew you,</p>
<p>you were seeking for deep human connection</p>
<p>with a small number of people.</p>
<p>And now when a lot of people know you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still looking for deep connection</p>
<p>with a small number of people.</p>
<p>The struggle is the same.</p>
<p>Can you speak to,</p>
<p>cause you mentioned some of the dark moments.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to people</p>
<p>who are struggling with depression?</p>
<p>And maybe for the people who love the people</p>
<p>who are struggling with depression.</p>
<p>So what I have found to be most successful for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s back to the basics of everything</p>
<p>that the therapist or psychologist will tell you,</p>
<p>psychiatrist will tell you right when you meet them,</p>
<p>which is exercise every day,</p>
<p>eat healthy for sure,</p>
<p>find time, make time every day to do something</p>
<p>that you love, whatever that may be,</p>
<p>whatever brings you joy.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re really depressed,</p>
<p>that actually feels like nothing.</p>
<p>Cause the things that brought you joy,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t bring you joy anymore.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m really in the thick of it.</p>
<p>But for me, like this is the cycle</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll go through is I&rsquo;ll look at my life</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll say, okay, what can I clean up?</p>
<p>All right, well, for me it was cutting out alcohol</p>
<p>actually helped me a lot.</p>
<p>I know that sounds like a big,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not judging anybody for that.</p>
<p>And I still drink on occasion,</p>
<p>but I felt like alcohol has been very unhelpful</p>
<p>to my mental state.</p>
<p>Feel less drive and less happiness the next day</p>
<p>for things that I wanna do.</p>
<p>I feel like it plays a lot with your serotonin.</p>
<p>So look for stuff to change.</p>
<p>Clean living, yeah, clean living,</p>
<p>but also understanding that sometimes it just is,</p>
<p>and you just keep breathing</p>
<p>and it will get better with time.</p>
<p>This too shall pass.</p>
<p>Like I really think that in the winter,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure, I mean, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of therapists</p>
<p>and all of them say the same thing,</p>
<p>which is like, you have major depressive disorder</p>
<p>and this is what it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s certainly worse for me in the winter months.</p>
<p>So I know there&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t think of the term for it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a term for like seasonal depression.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll get to the winter and suddenly I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>geez, everything really sucks on a deeper level.</p>
<p>And then, so it&rsquo;s like this too shall pass is another thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, just practice those things.</p>
<p>Absolutely see a therapist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my biggest, like my biggest emphasis of life</p>
<p>is to like on stage, like my goal,</p>
<p>like I have a few things that I really, really care about.</p>
<p>One is mental health and destigmatizing therapy.</p>
<p>Cause for me, I didn&rsquo;t go to therapy for a long time</p>
<p>because I felt that it would be admitting that I was broken.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be admitting that I was weaker than Lex</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have to go to a therapist</p>
<p>because Lex is stronger.</p>
<p>So be strong like Lex.</p>
<p>I would like look at all my older brothers</p>
<p>and I looked up to them so much</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all these incredibly successful people,</p>
<p>plastic surgeon, an anesthesiologist, a dentist,</p>
<p>two attorneys, Stanford, NYU,</p>
<p>like just like incredible high standards,</p>
<p>Eagle Scouts, you know, like they valedictorians,</p>
<p>like they just did it all.</p>
<p>So for me, I was very, really did not want to admit</p>
<p>and none of them went to therapy.</p>
<p>So it was like, what are you going to be?</p>
<p>Are you, oh, you&rsquo;re broken.</p>
<p>Are you like the weak one who can&rsquo;t hack life?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p>And I feel like it almost cost me my life</p>
<p>because I took so long to finally go to therapy.</p>
<p>So I really want kids to know,</p>
<p>hey, like the great people that achieve great things</p>
<p>that are doing amazing things,</p>
<p>they probably have help, almost all of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like going to the gym, but it&rsquo;s a mental gym.</p>
<p>What, so I, unfortunately,</p>
<p>I wanted to be a psychiatrist when I was growing up.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why I like podcasts.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be a good one.</p>
<p>Maybe, I would.</p>
<p>I think you are a psychiatrist, pretty much, right?</p>
<p>Sounds like you&rsquo;re a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>I think I need more.</p>
<p>I think actually, to be a good psychiatrist,</p>
<p>you also need to be seeking therapy from the,</p>
<p>like you also need to be,</p>
<p>have some stuff to work through in your mind.</p>
<p>I think, yeah, you have to have gone to some dark places.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>The empathize.</p>
<p>The empathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ability to empathize,</p>
<p>and especially if you&rsquo;ve directly experienced it,</p>
<p>you can go to those places in your mind.</p>
<p>Like you said, it&rsquo;s with the music,</p>
<p>to be authentic, you have to really go there.</p>
<p>What, why did therapy help so much?</p>
<p>What is the process of therapy,</p>
<p>if you can just educate a little more?</p>
<p>Is it, are you basically bringing to the surface</p>
<p>and talking through things that you,</p>
<p>because of the momentum of life,</p>
<p>you just never allow yourself to speak through,</p>
<p>to think through?</p>
<p>Is that what therapy is?</p>
<p>Or is there some more systematic thing?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been to a lot of strange,</p>
<p>different kinds of therapy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you my first therapist.</p>
<p>If I could sort of interrupt,</p>
<p>how hard is it to find a therapist that connected with you?</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s actually pretty hard, I think.</p>
<p>I think, I think it for,</p>
<p>well, actually I have a skewed view of that,</p>
<p>because going back to the beginning of my therapy</p>
<p>was with a Mormon therapist.</p>
<p>So it was very much like,</p>
<p>well, are you reading your book of Mormon?</p>
<p>And are you praying at night?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, that was a big focus of my therapy</p>
<p>to begin with.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re having a faith crisis in the distance somewhere.</p>
<p>Yes, I was like, well, and then.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making it worse.</p>
<p>Yes, the next therapist I went to</p>
<p>was a Scientology therapist.</p>
<p>I met my wife and she was Scientologist at the time,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s not anymore.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s such a funny thing to look back on,</p>
<p>because we met, and I was like this Mormon missionary</p>
<p>who had just got home from his mission,</p>
<p>and I met her, and she&rsquo;s a Scientologist.</p>
<p>I was like, wow, that&rsquo;s batshit crazy.</p>
<p>Like, that stuff&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your crazy, you&rsquo;re a Mormon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s batshit crazy.</p>
<p>And the two of us were like, huh,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s something to this, to both of us here.</p>
<p>Yeah, the tension actually forces you to think through,</p>
<p>oh, well, what is true?</p>
<p>Yeah, and we really fell in love through that,</p>
<p>which was like, maybe we&rsquo;re both on the wrong track.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure this out.</p>
<p>But before that happened,</p>
<p>we went to a Scientologist therapist,</p>
<p>who that therapy consisted of,</p>
<p>what have you done wrong to Asia?</p>
<p>And they would ask me that question</p>
<p>over and over and over and over,</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;m like thinking of the deepest, darkest things</p>
<p>that were in the recesses of my mind.</p>
<p>This was marriage therapy.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not gonna get into that,</p>
<p>but it was Scientology therapy.</p>
<p>So that was a different thing.</p>
<p>And then I went to therapy therapy,</p>
<p>like no, not attached to any religion.</p>
<p>And that was a really great experience for me.</p>
<p>And since then I&rsquo;ve been through</p>
<p>a couple of different therapists,</p>
<p>but that was more because where I was</p>
<p>and moving and things like that.</p>
<p>So is it that hard to find a great therapist?</p>
<p>Probably not, but maybe don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>to your Mormon therapist</p>
<p>versus that Scientology therapist.</p>
<p>Or maybe that&rsquo;s the route for you.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the route for you, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what is, so is it bringing stuff</p>
<p>to the surface, basically?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, sorry, I didn&rsquo;t even answer your question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the effect, why is it so effective?</p>
<p>Just, is there something you could put words to?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s, obviously,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the common things you would think of,</p>
<p>which is like, oh, I&rsquo;ve been holding these things in</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t wanna tell anybody,</p>
<p>and then I tell this person,</p>
<p>and oh, there&rsquo;s relief in that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really not where the real work comes from.</p>
<p>I think the real work is meeting with someone</p>
<p>who is well versed and educated and understands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like coding.</p>
<p>It really is, it&rsquo;s like someone who,</p>
<p>they listen to you, and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, that was a trigger,</p>
<p>and then this became this trigger,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re probably, every time you&rsquo;re hearing that,</p>
<p>thinking of this thing that happened earlier in your life,</p>
<p>and they just will walk you through scenarios,</p>
<p>and maybe some of them aren&rsquo;t right,</p>
<p>but some of them, you&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll resonate sometimes, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wow, I am feeling that because of that,</p>
<p>and that did happen, and maybe if I call my mom</p>
<p>and say this to her, it will make me feel,</p>
<p>hey mom, this happened, it&rsquo;s like work.</p>
<p>You put in work, and you have hard conversations</p>
<p>and do difficult things,</p>
<p>and if, so if your therapy&rsquo;s not difficult,</p>
<p>I actually think that&rsquo;s not good therapy.</p>
<p>Good therapy is, it&rsquo;s gonna be a little difficult,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s work, like.</p>
<p>During and after.</p>
<p>Yes, like I had this incredible therapist who was,</p>
<p>I told him when I was gonna do ayahuasca,</p>
<p>he was like, geez, you know,</p>
<p>he had actually was a doctor before</p>
<p>and a really well educated studied person</p>
<p>who had walked away from brain doctor,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the word for that, brain doctor?</p>
<p>Brain surgeon? Neurologist.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, neurologist, yep.</p>
<p>And he said, well basically his belief was that ayahuasca</p>
<p>was like basically doing therapy like 50 sessions.</p>
<p>He was like, it&rsquo;s like really intensive.</p>
<p>He was like, I don&rsquo;t know if you wanna do that,</p>
<p>if you do, you can make some big steps forward,</p>
<p>but I prefer just to do one session at a time.</p>
<p>And so yeah, it&rsquo;s hard work.</p>
<p>And that, I typically like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard for me to even talk about ayahuasca</p>
<p>by the way, going back to that,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not looking to tell everybody to go do ayahuasca.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly hard.</p>
<p>It was the scariest experience of my entire life.</p>
<p>It felt like I went to heaven,</p>
<p>but it also felt like I went to the darkest, deepest hell</p>
<p>that was incredibly scary, incredibly scary, yeah.</p>
<p>So you told the story of how you wrote the song Believer</p>
<p>or like your childhood friend, I guess, Donald,</p>
<p>like bullying and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>This song, I mean, a lot of your songs</p>
<p>are super interesting sort of in terms of percussion,</p>
<p>super interesting, super interesting lyrically,</p>
<p>just how it flows and also pain is at the center of it.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of, like you said, the crisis of faith,</p>
<p>some of these existential questions</p>
<p>are basically behind a lot of your songs, funny enough.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re covered in metaphor, so it&rsquo;s hard to see,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And this song is really interesting in that way</p>
<p>that it puts pain, you made me a believer.</p>
<p>You break me down, you build me up, Believer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe can you tell the story of how the song came to be?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to listen to it too.</p>
<p>I have some questions musically about it too.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about with therapy.</p>
<p>I just feel like the greatest things in my life</p>
<p>have come from the deepest hurt, like losing someone,</p>
<p>that you love is maybe the hardest part of the human path</p>
<p>for me, at least thus far.</p>
<p>When I think of, okay, what was the hardest thing?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, you think of physical pain</p>
<p>or maybe like going through financial pain or whatever.</p>
<p>I think losing someone that you really love to death</p>
<p>is one of the hardest, for me,</p>
<p>I would say it was the hardest.</p>
<p>But it also makes you look at your life</p>
<p>completely differently and alter your life,</p>
<p>at least for me in ways that were really healthy.</p>
<p>Being more present, letting go of things</p>
<p>that were meaningless, trying to control</p>
<p>what other people think about you,</p>
<p>like wasting your time on things like that.</p>
<p>And you suddenly see like, wow, like time,</p>
<p>I got small amount of time, like how do I wanna spend it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna spend it in the best way I know how and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a basic concept</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been said a million times over</p>
<p>in a million different ways.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s pretty much what I was trying to say with Believer</p>
<p>which is like, I&rsquo;ve lost faith in everything</p>
<p>at that time period or previous to that time period.</p>
<p>And then I was rebuilding my faith</p>
<p>or my spiritual thought process.</p>
<p>And it was after ayahuasca and it was like, finding,</p>
<p>being a Believer and that&rsquo;s not necessarily like</p>
<p>a Believer in God or a Believer in heaven and hell</p>
<p>or anything like that, but a Believer in more.</p>
<p>Believing in goodness, believing in that there is some light</p>
<p>like, and again, those words like, they&rsquo;re just words</p>
<p>and I wish there were better words to formulate</p>
<p>the thought that I&rsquo;m trying to express,</p>
<p>but just more, like the thought of me dying,</p>
<p>for me, I don&rsquo;t fear it, I don&rsquo;t fear it,</p>
<p>but actually I really fear not seeing my kids again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say that, that is fearful for me.</p>
<p>I feel like I love so deeply these children</p>
<p>that the thought of like leaving them</p>
<p>for me is a scary thought or something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of good reminder</p>
<p>how much you love life actually.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t always remember that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think having kids is not for everyone</p>
<p>for absolutely for sure, but for me,</p>
<p>and especially you shouldn&rsquo;t be having kids</p>
<p>to give yourself a reason to live.</p>
<p>I feel like dying, I&rsquo;m gonna have a kid.</p>
<p>You might feel more like dying after having a kid actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty stressful, but it is a place to like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed a lot of people that I&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>that it gave them a new intensity</p>
<p>of gratitude for life, for sure.</p>
<p>Guy, do you mind if we, I&rsquo;ll return to the pain</p>
<p>and the belief, do you mind if we listen</p>
<p>to a little bit of songs?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Do you write the music first or the words first?</p>
<p>Uh, the same time, which is very typical for me.</p>
<p>By just the way it opens, intensity of openings.</p>
<p>You ever think about what the first few seconds sound like?</p>
<p>Is that something that, like when you imagine a song,</p>
<p>is it the opening you imagine?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s kind of a, I never think opening,</p>
<p>I never think final, I think soundscape</p>
<p>of how I&rsquo;m feeling right now.</p>
<p>So it could be the middle of the song</p>
<p>for all I know when I&rsquo;m doing that,</p>
<p>but my process for me is very much lyrics and melody</p>
<p>and music really come at the same time.</p>
<p>Like I, by same time, I mean, I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, as I&rsquo;m expressing maybe, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling like.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not that simple, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hear it, like, it&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s all the orchestra</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of just pressing all the buttons at once</p>
<p>and melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just utilizing one instrument.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve seen the landscape and that landscape</p>
<p>includes melody, includes percussion, lyrics a little bit,</p>
<p>or lyrics?</p>
<p>I will be words to begin with, like a word here and there.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll be like.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s a word that I&rsquo;m thinking of</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m feeling this soundscape?</p>
<p>And I always create with no theme in mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never, for better or for worse,</p>
<p>just my process is I&rsquo;m sitting down</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m writing a journal entry.</p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when you sit down to write a journal entry,</p>
<p>are you sitting down and you&rsquo;re like, Kev,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had all these words here that I&rsquo;m gonna put on the page</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna order it in this way.</p>
<p>And my theme for my journal entry today is gonna be this.</p>
<p>Maybe some people do, but I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>My journal entry is, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna say.</p>
<p>Oh, how was today?</p>
<p>Well, man, today was this and feeling this.</p>
<p>And now that I think about that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really angry about that.</p>
<p>That hurt my feelings when this happened.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re formulating it as you go</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the joy of it.</p>
<p>And for me, that&rsquo;s what music is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll sit down, not thinking,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write a song that has a hard beat</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write a song that&rsquo;s anthemic</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write a song that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, how am I feeling right now?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s joyful?</p>
<p>Is the feeling joyful to you or is it struggle?</p>
<p>You just made it sound like it&rsquo;s joyful.</p>
<p>Or at least fulfilling.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t use that.</p>
<p>Yeah, fulfilling is the word I was kind of looking for,</p>
<p>but there was.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of artists talk about really struggle,</p>
<p>like you talk about writers.</p>
<p>Cathartic, that&rsquo;s the word I was looking for.</p>
<p>It feels like having a good moment with a therapist</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;m expressing this thing</p>
<p>that I just need to express.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I need to express this.</p>
<p>The majority of the songs I write,</p>
<p>for the record, are never heard.</p>
<p>I write over 100 songs a year.</p>
<p>I release 20 songs every three years.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know, what&rsquo;s that percent?</p>
<p>20 out of 300.</p>
<p>Come on, Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less than 10%.</p>
<p>Less than 10%, yeah.</p>
<p>Eight, seven or something?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, so it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And then getting together with the band</p>
<p>and getting them selected down</p>
<p>is really what the process has.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re really writing a song per one to three days.</p>
<p>Three days, maybe a song that you can&rsquo;t quite figure out</p>
<p>the puzzle of that&rsquo;s gonna last a little longer.</p>
<p>Is it worth the struggle?</p>
<p>I finish every idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, you finish every idea.</p>
<p>I do, I finish every idea.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like laying completely unfinished.</p>
<p>I could open my computer for you right now</p>
<p>and I would show you hundreds and hundreds of songs</p>
<p>that you would listen to and think,</p>
<p>that sounds like a song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s rhythm, there&rsquo;s melody,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s multiple instruments, there&rsquo;s lyrics.</p>
<p>Like I, it&rsquo;s the same thing as for coding for me,</p>
<p>which is music, which is I can&rsquo;t walk away</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;ve completed it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s finished.</p>
<p>Well, finished is.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it sounds like a song.</p>
<p>I certainly do a lot more with it after,</p>
<p>with the band, we&rsquo;ll pull it all apart.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be like, you know, you&rsquo;ll listen to it and say,</p>
<p>okay, that was a song.</p>
<p>I get, you understand what it is, for sure.</p>
<p>Do you think, this is a painful question</p>
<p>from a fan perspective.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s genius on your computer</p>
<p>that you walked away from that you just didn&rsquo;t notice it?</p>
<p>Like, do you think there&rsquo;s truly great songs</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve written that you just didn&rsquo;t notice</p>
<p>how great they are?</p>
<p>I think greatness is something that I feel I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve achieved greatness.</p>
<p>Genuine, I&rsquo;m not saying that to you</p>
<p>in a way of like humility, falseness.</p>
<p>Like Michael Jordan type.</p>
<p>No, genuinely, I feel like I am on a journey right now</p>
<p>to find who I am.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m 34 and it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t begun that journey.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m just starting that.</p>
<p>But that being said, I certainly don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the right answer to what songs are, you know,</p>
<p>beloved or good to the masses.</p>
<p>Like Imagine Dragons is such a massive entity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there have been a, I will say this,</p>
<p>there are a couple of times where I fought really hard</p>
<p>to decide on the single, really hard.</p>
<p>Or I always fight for what goes on the record, always.</p>
<p>I always put the record together</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the record that I wanted to be</p>
<p>and me and the guys come up with that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nobody else has influenced, no manager, no label.</p>
<p>The single, everybody wants to have a saying.</p>
<p>Your label wants to have a saying in it.</p>
<p>Your manager wants to have a saying in it.</p>
<p>And I have fought really hard over that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been wrong before and I&rsquo;ve been right before.</p>
<p>But as far as songs that I haven&rsquo;t put out, I mean.</p>
<p>Because you can imagine so many songs,</p>
<p>you think of so many Beatles songs</p>
<p>that are like some of their greats,</p>
<p>while my guitar gently weeps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to imagine weird sounding,</p>
<p>not that interesting possibly songs.</p>
<p>The majority of what we put them.</p>
<p>Honestly, it may be our best stuff</p>
<p>is that we don&rsquo;t put out for instance.</p>
<p>Because our band is such a, it&rsquo;s such a complex question.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know actually.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe one day I&rsquo;ll die</p>
<p>and people will look and be like,</p>
<p>I hated Imagine Dragons, but now I listen to that song.</p>
<p>I really liked that, wish they would put that out.</p>
<p>Or maybe they&rsquo;ll be like, oh, it&rsquo;s all sounds like shit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, sorry, it is a tragic thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I asked it, which is like,</p>
<p>there could be some great, incredible things</p>
<p>that will take you a long time to rediscover,</p>
<p>to realize how great they are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the tragic aspect of being an artist</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t know, forget fame or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to really move people.</p>
<p>Cause ultimately what you want is to connect with people</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard, I mean, to me it&rsquo;s tragic</p>
<p>just as a fan of yours to see,</p>
<p>maybe I wonder if there&rsquo;s like incredible stuff there.</p>
<p>Just as it is tragic to see great artists throughout history</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t get recognition until they died.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, cause they basically held on,</p>
<p>Franz Kafka was extremely self critical.</p>
<p>A lot of these folks had an idea of what&rsquo;s good and not,</p>
<p>and they were wrong.</p>
<p>They had genius, they weren&rsquo;t entirely wrong</p>
<p>cause they became sufficiently popular,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I try to genuinely to release the songs</p>
<p>that move me the most.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re your own audience.</p>
<p>Yeah, I try to put out the songs that make me feel the most.</p>
<p>Like I feel that, that&rsquo;s my only gauge</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so subjective of like, what is good?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p>Nobody knows the song the masses are going to like.</p>
<p>Nobody knows that formula, nobody knows it.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s always what makes me feel something.</p>
<p>One of the main lessons Rick Rubin taught me</p>
<p>when we worked with him on this record</p>
<p>was he would say, his main point</p>
<p>that he would continually bring up when like,</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s not the type of person to be like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a bad song or that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not who Rick Rubin is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, there&rsquo;s more nuance to it.</p>
<p>He would say, I don&rsquo;t really believe you on that song.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he would say.</p>
<p>He would say, and I knew that was like,</p>
<p>that song&rsquo;s a no go.</p>
<p>He would say, and I would genuinely,</p>
<p>there was a time he said it and it was about a song</p>
<p>that I really like, I really felt it</p>
<p>and meant it when I said it.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t believe it when he heard it.</p>
<p>And that was enough for, I was like,</p>
<p>man, well, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>like I can believe it all I want,</p>
<p>but if the listener doesn&rsquo;t feel the honesty in it,</p>
<p>just like we were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>I think the most important ingredient is,</p>
<p>is this truth, perceived as truth to someone else?</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not, the bullshit indicator goes,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t care, I don&rsquo;t throw it away.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about it.</p>
<p>You said that he made you go through, like line by line,</p>
<p>the lyrics.</p>
<p>Every single, it was excruciating for me.</p>
<p>Why was that excruciating?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, it&rsquo;s Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in the room with like Rick Rubin,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done a lot of the greatest of all time.</p>
<p>And so I had to first just put that aside</p>
<p>and be like, okay, well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done a lot of my favorite records,</p>
<p>but still you&rsquo;re human and not everything you say</p>
<p>is gonna be right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a strongly opinionated person,</p>
<p>and so is Rick.</p>
<p>And so when the two of us were sitting down in a room</p>
<p>together, it was, you know.</p>
<p>But the lyrics, which is interesting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the entire composition,</p>
<p>but just like, let&rsquo;s look at the lyrics.</p>
<p>What do you mean here?</p>
<p>Yeah, oh yeah, cause he would look over every,</p>
<p>there was like, and there were battles he won,</p>
<p>battles that he didn&rsquo;t win, and maybe he was right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, there was, for instance, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>There was a song on the record called Number One.</p>
<p>Rick will probably laugh when he hears this.</p>
<p>Cause this was a big one that we kept going back</p>
<p>and forth on.</p>
<p>But this will give you a good insight</p>
<p>of what it was like.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a line in it that says,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the chorus is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m meant to be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need no one to believe.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s all been said and done,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still my number one.</p>
<p>And he was like, nah, it just makes me cringe</p>
<p>when I hear that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I just, like, do you have to be like,</p>
<p>can it not be like, you&rsquo;re still my number one?</p>
<p>And I was like, no, it&rsquo;s not about anybody else.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s about like self love.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, but like, do you need to like talk</p>
<p>about self love like that?</p>
<p>And I was like, well, I feel like I need to.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, maybe, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something else we could say there.</p>
<p>Like we just kept, you know,</p>
<p>we kept coming back to this song, okay?</p>
<p>I was like, and I changed it.</p>
<p>I tried changing it.</p>
<p>What did I change it to?</p>
<p>It was like, it wasn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re still my number one,</p>
<p>it just made no sense.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t about some love thing or like someone else.</p>
<p>I changed it to something else.</p>
<p>And it just, it was the one thing that I was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really sorry, Rick.</p>
<p>Like, I get it.</p>
<p>And if it sounds cringy to you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely sounding cringy to other people too.</p>
<p>And that sucks.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know how else to say this</p>
<p>in a way that I want to put that song out anymore.</p>
<p>But there were other songs for sure</p>
<p>where Rick was like, that or this,</p>
<p>that word feels a little trite.</p>
<p>You already said that once.</p>
<p>Can you say it in a different way?</p>
<p>It was really helpful.</p>
<p>And then, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to say something so simply</p>
<p>and yet not make it cringe.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a strange art form</p>
<p>because you want to say some of the greatest love songs.</p>
<p>I mean, we looked at the Without You song.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole thing is cringy.</p>
<p>If you just read it on paper, like it&rsquo;s a court report</p>
<p>or something, but yet it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>especially when sung maybe.</p>
<p>But no, there&rsquo;s something about, yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>Sung in a way you believe it.</p>
<p>When you believe it,</p>
<p>but also written in a way that&rsquo;s singable</p>
<p>in the way you believe it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>It rolls off.</p>
<p>It just comes out in a way that just feels like silky.</p>
<p>No word catches your mind as cringy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>But then music, I think great speeches are like that too,</p>
<p>or just conveying, communicating ideas simply.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the art form is to not be cringy.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>And then yet, because like when you&rsquo;re raw and real,</p>
<p>it might at first feel cringy.</p>
<p>So the battle there,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where you see people fail.</p>
<p>Like just regular artists.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, at open mic,</p>
<p>I got open mic, so I just listen to musicians.</p>
<p>Like when they write songs, like they fail that test.</p>
<p>They write simple stuff, but it&rsquo;s cringy.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I wonder what was that?</p>
<p>Like, what is that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, Lex,</p>
<p>I tried to explain this to my brother the other day,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the same thing with a live performance.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not in my right head space and I walk on stage</p>
<p>and I walk up and let&rsquo;s say I say something and I do this,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, this is the move, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is the move.</p>
<p>The crowd doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>In fact, the crowd&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s cringy when you did this.</p>
<p>But if I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about doing this</p>
<p>and I went up there and I said something</p>
<p>and I really meant it and my body was like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain this to you,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so silly to say out loud,</p>
<p>but people will resonate to it when it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s acted, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you could do it the exact,</p>
<p>the motion could look the same, your eyes look the same,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about the energy that people know.</p>
<p>They know if it&rsquo;s real or not.</p>
<p>Yeah, people have, like you said,</p>
<p>incredible bullshit detectors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love people. A hundred percent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go on a stage and if I&rsquo;m not in the right head space</p>
<p>to be real, it won&rsquo;t be a good show.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m real, then it&rsquo;s a good show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the song.</p>
<p>Like I said, great opener.</p>
<p>So you had this in your mind,</p>
<p>this landscape?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The beat was first on this.</p>
<p>What about the first and the second,</p>
<p>like first thing&rsquo;s first, second thing&rsquo;s second?</p>
<p>The first line I wrote was first thing&rsquo;s first.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, it just was like,</p>
<p>and then I was like, oh, that principle of, you know.</p>
<p>Great line.</p>
<p>Second thing&rsquo;s second.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you tell me what you think that I could be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one at the sail, I&rsquo;m the master of my sea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the master of my sea.</p>
<p>My dad had that in his office.</p>
<p>He had this saying that was something about the sailor</p>
<p>and being the master of his sea that I always loved.</p>
<p>There you go, simple statement.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Zero cringe in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so simple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the master of my sea.</p>
<p>This whole song is just trivial,</p>
<p>but in terms of lyrically,</p>
<p>but extremely powerful and original, unique sounding,</p>
<p>something about the words.</p>
<p>Just even, you don&rsquo;t have to actually sing them,</p>
<p>you just read them.</p>
<p>And then raw, I was broken from a young age,</p>
<p>tuck myself into the masses, writing my poems for the few</p>
<p>that look at me, took to me, shook at me,</p>
<p>feeling me, singing from the heartache, from the pain,</p>
<p>taking my message from the thing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, why am I reciting your words to you?</p>
<p>But the percussionist throughout it,</p>
<p>and that was there in the beginning.</p>
<p>The percussion is almost in the lyrics, yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a very percussive singer</p>
<p>because I was a drummer first before I,</p>
<p>I think same with Dave Grohl, probably a similar thing,</p>
<p>which is I think in percussive sense a lot when I&rsquo;m writing</p>
<p>and I also was, before I could play an instrument,</p>
<p>I would beatbox.</p>
<p>And I think Michael Jackson did this too, actually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard in the studio that he was very similar,</p>
<p>but a lot of what I do is percussive</p>
<p>because my brain thinks in percussively first.</p>
<p>A little more, because it&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a drum, like,</p>
<p>dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka.</p>
<p>And then you lay words on that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, this.</p>
<p>Tuck myself into the masses, writing my poems for the few</p>
<p>that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feeling me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like drums, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all building to the chorus.</p>
<p>Hey, you made me a, you made me a believer, believer.</p>
<p>Hey, hey.</p>
<p>What about the word pain?</p>
<p>When did that come to you?</p>
<p>Pain, you made me, you made me a believer.</p>
<p>Yeah, just the idea of,</p>
<p>I just wanted to, I really,</p>
<p>one of the things that a lot of the songs that I like,</p>
<p>I like divisiveness, for instance, not always,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s times where I want someone to hear a song</p>
<p>and I want them to either love it or hate it.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t want them to be in the middle ground.</p>
<p>A lot of the songs that,</p>
<p>like a lot of my favorite songs are divisive songs.</p>
<p>And so for instance, with pain,</p>
<p>I want you to hear that in almost like, it&rsquo;s like, whoa.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something either somebody is going to hear</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be like, man,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to hear that like that.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s like, oh, I felt that so deeply</p>
<p>when he said that in that way, because it sounded like this.</p>
<p>And when you think of the word pain, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a, at least for me, when I hear that word,</p>
<p>it carries a lot of weight, carries a lot of weight.</p>
<p>So I wanted to sing it with a lot of weight</p>
<p>and to come into that chorus with like,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a striking moment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also a tenor singing as,</p>
<p>sorry, I&rsquo;m a baritone singing as a tenor.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where that natural,</p>
<p>like gruffness comes from is that I&rsquo;m singing</p>
<p>out of my range really, up in my head voice.</p>
<p>And it carries a lot of weight with it</p>
<p>because of the baritone.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a specific sort of the pause before the pain?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like a double.</p>
<p>What is that, how much work does that take</p>
<p>to get that right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like a, so you&rsquo;re kind of seeing the beauty</p>
<p>through the, and then that, whatever that sound is.</p>
<p>Right, the bass being rolled off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually, when I first was approaching the chorus,</p>
<p>it was actually seeing,</p>
<p>taking my message from the veins,</p>
<p>taking my lesson from the veins,</p>
<p>seeing the beauty through the,</p>
<p>seeing the beauty through the pain.</p>
<p>You made me a, like it came in on one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not seeing it right right now, but it did not wait.</p>
<p>And it felt like it didn&rsquo;t hit</p>
<p>in the way that it was supposed to hit.</p>
<p>Because the, you predict that, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re waiting to see the beauty</p>
<p>through the pain, you made me a, right?</p>
<p>It was like the beauty through the pain.</p>
<p>You made me a, made me.</p>
<p>So I wanted to feel a little more like striking,</p>
<p>like, again, it&rsquo;s like that thing that makes you</p>
<p>kind of do this a little bit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, huh?</p>
<p>But once you hear it a few times, you&rsquo;re like, ah, ah.</p>
<p>And you predict, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;d rather someone hear our song the first time</p>
<p>and be confused by it.</p>
<p>So they play it the second time.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, I really don&rsquo;t want, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather turn some people off along the way.</p>
<p>And then the people who come along for you</p>
<p>are gonna feel more committed, I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an interesting, like,</p>
<p>it feels gutsy to insert silence, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what makes it, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the greatest speakers of all time are like,</p>
<p>and I told you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You would know, I mean, it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re like, oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, what is that?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s so interesting to do that</p>
<p>just at the right time.</p>
<p>And then, and then pain, right?</p>
<p>Man, it&rsquo;s a brilliant song.</p>
<p>Did you know it was a good song when you wrote it?</p>
<p>Out of the thousands of songs you&rsquo;ve written?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s always the same thing for me,</p>
<p>which is like, if I wanna listen to the song</p>
<p>and I wanna listen to it a lot of times,</p>
<p>then those are the songs we put out.</p>
<p>And I only wanna listen to the songs</p>
<p>that make me feel something.</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>our single that did the very worst of all our singles</p>
<p>was the song that I wanted to listen to the least,</p>
<p>but it made the most sense as a single,</p>
<p>which was all the wrong reason to choose it, right?</p>
<p>It was, I Bet My Life is the single off our second album.</p>
<p>And that song was originally written,</p>
<p>it was just a guitar and a vocal,</p>
<p>and it was very just quiet and laid back.</p>
<p>And we were like, well, let&rsquo;s try to dial it up,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s try to produce it.</p>
<p>And we overproduced that song.</p>
<p>We self produced it as a band and we overproduced.</p>
<p>And that song, I mean, it did good in terms of a song,</p>
<p>but for us, it did not do good compared to other songs.</p>
<p>And I really look back at that</p>
<p>and learned a lesson from that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if I don&rsquo;t wanna listen to the song,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sign already.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t wanna listen to your own song,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not a good song.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You said your dad, elsewhere and today,</p>
<p>just said that your dad early on was a kind of the early</p>
<p>Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So when you were starting out, he gave you feedback,</p>
<p>you listened.</p>
<p>What did you learn about music about life from your dad?</p>
<p>My dad is a really quiet farm, grew up on a farm,</p>
<p>very humble.</p>
<p>And I think he starts every sentence by saying,</p>
<p>this is just my two cents, pretty much.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, take it or leave it.</p>
<p>Like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s that kind of a sense, like there&rsquo;s humility</p>
<p>in everything and it&rsquo;s real for him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like false humility.</p>
<p>I really feel like when he&rsquo;s saying things,</p>
<p>he really is like, maybe this isn&rsquo;t any worth to you son.</p>
<p>And he means it, but here it is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always gold.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, wow, dad, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So what, in those early days of you like,</p>
<p>so you were like 12 or something like that,</p>
<p>like starting to write songs.</p>
<p>I was 12, I wasn&rsquo;t showing my music to anyone.</p>
<p>I started writing right when I was 12</p>
<p>and I probably wrote for at least,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say six months or something.</p>
<p>And I had written probably, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like a lot of songs during that time.</p>
<p>What was the topic by the way?</p>
<p>Love, anger?</p>
<p>It was all sad.</p>
<p>No, it was, the first song I ever wrote went,</p>
<p>and it was like a bluesy thing.</p>
<p>It was like, there was my voice doing that.</p>
<p>And then it was like,</p>
<p>all by himself, no other one around.</p>
<p>And he stood all alone.</p>
<p>When would he be found?</p>
<p>Did he want company?</p>
<p>Or was he fine on his own?</p>
<p>Everyone needs a friend.</p>
<p>So why was he all alone?</p>
<p>You know, it is like, but I was like a 12 year old with,</p>
<p>I just felt like depressed for the first time.</p>
<p>And I was, and I just was like, so.</p>
<p>I think he discovered the blues as a 12 year old.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>It really was, it was like my sense of the blues</p>
<p>at that time for sure, like bad version of the blues.</p>
<p>But it was like 12 year old kid with a bunch of acne.</p>
<p>And like, I just like, I hated going to school.</p>
<p>I felt like that I just had not found myself.</p>
<p>Sounds like a great song, by the way.</p>
<p>But anyway, I wanted to keep listening.</p>
<p>I forgot I was.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know about that, but yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, what was your dad,</p>
<p>at which point did you begin to share it with your dad?</p>
<p>A lot of the songs that I wrote in the beginning</p>
<p>were very much like Bobby McFerrin like that,</p>
<p>because our, Mike was in a part of the house</p>
<p>where I couldn&rsquo;t bring over the piano.</p>
<p>And the only instrument I played at the time</p>
<p>was the piano.</p>
<p>So I would do everything with my voice.</p>
<p>But then I started teaching myself the guitar</p>
<p>in those, in that beginning, like six month period,</p>
<p>just watching my brothers play in their garage bands</p>
<p>in the basement.</p>
<p>And then I started to write songs</p>
<p>a little bit more like Enya vibes,</p>
<p>like stack my voice like 20, 30 times.</p>
<p>And like Enya meets like Jaray,</p>
<p>which is who my dad would listen to a lot.</p>
<p>John Michael Jaray, he&rsquo;s an incredible synth genius.</p>
<p>But anyway, so I finally got my like gall up enough</p>
<p>to show it to my dad one day after work.</p>
<p>And I got very little of my dad</p>
<p>because there were nine kids and he worked</p>
<p>from 8 a.m. till 6 p.m.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come home very tired.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s nine kids that are like, dad, you know,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the young one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re just gonna miss.</p>
<p>I was in the middle kind of too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s even, you know, middle child thing.</p>
<p>But I sat him down and I was like,</p>
<p>hey dad, I just wanna like kind of show you a song.</p>
<p>And he was like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know I was writing anything.</p>
<p>And I showed it to him and he listened</p>
<p>and he took it off and he really looked at me.</p>
<p>And he was like, that was really good.</p>
<p>He was like, I&rsquo;ve thought, and this,</p>
<p>when you said this, it made me feel this.</p>
<p>He was like, and that did it.</p>
<p>I probably would have given up music.</p>
<p>Like I look back, that was a very pivotal moment for me.</p>
<p>I was like in a place where I was like, is this good, bad?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it&rsquo;s so embarrassing and terrible.</p>
<p>And I was already writing lyrics</p>
<p>that were a little like overly metaphorical to hide</p>
<p>that I was dealing with faith crisis.</p>
<p>Cause I thought, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna show this to dad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my dad to know I&rsquo;m like questioning</p>
<p>the truthfulness of Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna be like, is Joseph Smith a real prophet?</p>
<p>Is Mormonism true?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>Like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I was like writing way overly metaphorical,</p>
<p>but because my dad really validated it</p>
<p>and he was a no bullshit person.</p>
<p>So I knew when my dad said that, I was like, you know what?</p>
<p>At least my dad really actually thinks this is cool.</p>
<p>And I really trusted my dad&rsquo;s taste</p>
<p>and thought everything he listened to was cool.</p>
<p>So I was like, wow, I&rsquo;m gonna keep doing this.</p>
<p>And I just showed it to my dad for years and years.</p>
<p>And still to this day, I send every song to my dad.</p>
<p>So he underneath it with the feedback is always like,</p>
<p>Ooh, I like this idea.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a positive, like a.</p>
<p>Not always positive, no.</p>
<p>But like underneath it, do you sense the positivity?</p>
<p>Cause I think that&rsquo;s. Always.</p>
<p>Never mean, never malicious.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s two types of criticism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like criticism that&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking to be hurtful to someone.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s criticism that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really important for art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the type of criticism that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you see the value in what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s honest, then you can,</p>
<p>you maybe communicate with that person.</p>
<p>Like I, I see what you&rsquo;re trying to do with that.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not even like you have to say that</p>
<p>or whatever, like butter it up.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, my dad would just give me the,</p>
<p>this honest criticism that would be like, you know,</p>
<p>it certainly wasn&rsquo;t always good,</p>
<p>but I knew it was always well intentioned.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s how I would say.</p>
<p>You mentioned, made me re listen to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Cass Stevens.</p>
<p>You made me re listen to father and son.</p>
<p>I probably all sons have issues</p>
<p>to work through with their fathers.</p>
<p>And you said that you connect with this song in particular.</p>
<p>I think, so you&rsquo;re a father now.</p>
<p>What is it about the song that connects with you?</p>
<p>For people, let me play it, let me play a little bit.</p>
<p>People should educate themselves on Cass Stevens.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Right on the peace train.</p>
<p>The best, the best, right on the peace train.</p>
<p>You think this is a hopeful, a sad song?</p>
<p>I hear it as hopeful.</p>
<p>I hear it as a loving father saying</p>
<p>just what his son needs to hear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not time to make a change.</p>
<p>Just relax, take it easy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still young.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your fault.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much you have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that calm wisdom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This time.</p>
<p>It wise.</p>
<p>If you want, you can marry, look at me.</p>
<p>I am old, but I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>And just the way he says that,</p>
<p>like that should be a corny line,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not corny at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Once like you are now.</p>
<p>Look at me, I&rsquo;m old, but I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to be calm</p>
<p>when you found something going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the simplicity there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s such a contrast with, what&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>Harry Chapman with the cats in the cradle,</p>
<p>which is like the sadness of,</p>
<p>so this feels like there&rsquo;s a wise,</p>
<p>calm connection between father and son, right?</p>
<p>With cats in the cradle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember that song.</p>
<p>He learned to walk while I was away</p>
<p>and he was talking before I knew it.</p>
<p>And as he grew, he&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;m going to be like you dad.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m going to be like you.</p>
<p>And the idea of that song is</p>
<p>that he does become like his dad,</p>
<p>which is funny, you know, something you&rsquo;ve said.</p>
<p>But in a different way,</p>
<p>you become too busy to make that connection.</p>
<p>His dad was too busy to make a connection with his son.</p>
<p>And in a, not in a dramatic way,</p>
<p>in a very kind of calm, natural way.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t, you just don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re busy at work, you&rsquo;re providing for the family</p>
<p>and so on, there&rsquo;s connection.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t really get,</p>
<p>form that like depth of connection.</p>
<p>And then the father, when the son shows up from college</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t spend any time with the father.</p>
<p>All that, and just the calm sadness of that,</p>
<p>that we live, we can live parallel lives</p>
<p>and never quite connect.</p>
<p>And there is a little bit of that in father and son</p>
<p>with Cat Stevens too, you know,</p>
<p>like when the son is saying,</p>
<p>from the moment that I could talk, I was ordered to listen.</p>
<p>I always remember listening to that line,</p>
<p>feeling like that really moved me.</p>
<p>But the beauty of that song is it shows,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like the theme of what I feel like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about since the second you got here,</p>
<p>which is something I really like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s such an important theme</p>
<p>in my life right now, but the duality of just understanding</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t understand someone else&rsquo;s situation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s truth to both sides.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s truth to what the father is saying to the son.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like saying these things and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking out for you, I love you.</p>
<p>Take your time with these things.</p>
<p>If you want to get married, you know you can.</p>
<p>Like these things will bring you up.</p>
<p>And then the son saying, listen,</p>
<p>like I want to pave my own path.</p>
<p>I want to do this.</p>
<p>Like, why are you telling me this?</p>
<p>Like the son&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s a lot of parents who tell their kids</p>
<p>what to do and they&rsquo;re wrong, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, and they don&rsquo;t let the kid form the path</p>
<p>that they need to, but should you not be a parent?</p>
<p>Like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just two sides to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing, it is annoying when you&rsquo;re older,</p>
<p>you get to see people do all the same things.</p>
<p>You could say, well, this is a phase and you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>that this actually will end up in this way.</p>
<p>You can like predict how the life unrolls.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very annoying for young people to hear,</p>
<p>especially cause it&rsquo;s probably going to be true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, it&rsquo;s not going to be like this.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m going to be different.</p>
<p>But then you become that person.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they also let them live that life.</p>
<p>Let them make the mistakes,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not mistakes actually.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like beautiful deviations</p>
<p>from the path that they end up on.</p>
<p>And those make the path.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young folks today?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had like an incredible dark journey</p>
<p>and a successful one, a loving one,</p>
<p>and one of the most successful artists in the world.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to young people today</p>
<p>that would like to find themselves to that way,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re struggling?</p>
<p>I thought you said device at first.</p>
<p>And I was like, honestly,</p>
<p>I feel like that device is not helping.</p>
<p>Maybe everybody should get away,</p>
<p>throw away their devices.</p>
<p>Advice.</p>
<p>I would just say like what I emphasize to my kids</p>
<p>is I really, really want my kids</p>
<p>to just learn to love themself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier said than done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to pick on yourself in life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to look in the mirror</p>
<p>and wish you looked different,</p>
<p>wish you were more successful like that person over there,</p>
<p>wish that, you know, wish a lot of things.</p>
<p>And people that I see that really succeed at life</p>
<p>really succeed truly.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re making money necessarily</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re succeeding.</p>
<p>And, you know, they&rsquo;re talking to a lot of people</p>
<p>like their success, success to me is like happy</p>
<p>and real, they have real self love.</p>
<p>You meet, you know, when you meet someone,</p>
<p>you meet Rick, for instance, you meet Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>Rick has a calmness about him.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny because everybody sees him</p>
<p>as this like Zen master.</p>
<p>Like Rick is just a really loving person</p>
<p>who also loves himself and has self confidence</p>
<p>because you just see it and it resonates.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why he draws people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s so great in the studio</p>
<p>because you know his intentions, always.</p>
<p>As an artist, when a producer comes in, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>whoa, whoa, whoa, what are your intentions?</p>
<p>What are you trying to do?</p>
<p>Are you trying to get a hit out of me for the label?</p>
<p>Are you trying to make me something?</p>
<p>Are you trying to like make me this</p>
<p>so you can prove this about yourself?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot in that dynamic.</p>
<p>And the reason that Rick is so good is because</p>
<p>you know his intentions and his intentions come</p>
<p>because Rick has that self love.</p>
<p>So for me, find the things about yourself</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re there that you love</p>
<p>and really focus in on them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not selfish.</p>
<p>Like I feel like I was brought up in a family too</p>
<p>where it was like, never look inward, like be selfless.</p>
<p>Like serve, serve, serve.</p>
<p>Which by the way, is a true principle of life.</p>
<p>I think you love yourself more when you serve more.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really evident in life.</p>
<p>But also spend time doing the things that make you happy.</p>
<p>Take time every day to go on that walk</p>
<p>that you need to go on.</p>
<p>Listen to that book tape that you need to listen to.</p>
<p>Like for me, that&rsquo;s something I need.</p>
<p>I know if I do that, I&rsquo;m gonna be a better dad</p>
<p>because I gave myself some love back in life.</p>
<p>And just forgive yourself.</p>
<p>I think forgive yourself because everybody messes up.</p>
<p>Everybody hurts others.</p>
<p>Everybody says unkind words at times.</p>
<p>Everybody fails all the time.</p>
<p>And if you think that you&rsquo;re gonna not, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re eventually going to</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re either gonna punish yourself for it every day</p>
<p>and be a lesser version of what you could be</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna forgive yourself for it.</p>
<p>And if you learned that that&rsquo;s not something you want</p>
<p>then try not to do it again.</p>
<p>If you do it again and you&rsquo;re probably gonna do it again,</p>
<p>whatever that is, you&rsquo;re gonna gossip about that person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna feel bad</p>
<p>because then you gossiped about someone.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say in terms of self love?</p>
<p>Is there a role for being critical?</p>
<p>Like those demons of self criticism,</p>
<p>do you need a little bit of that?</p>
<p>Tom Waits talks about,</p>
<p>I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.</p>
<p>Need a little poison?</p>
<p>Or is that silly?</p>
<p>Or a mental situation of poison?</p>
<p>Look, my biggest thing in life that has been</p>
<p>the thing that I&rsquo;ve worked on the hardest</p>
<p>for the last few years is to not be overly critical.</p>
<p>And to let go of control.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really easy to kill an artist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to kill an artist.</p>
<p>Like if my dad would have sat down with me that day</p>
<p>and even if he would have just sat down and been like,</p>
<p>good job son, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not silly, right?</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t, not everybody has a dad</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna ever do something</p>
<p>or put in the time or whatever.</p>
<p>But that might&rsquo;ve altered everything for me.</p>
<p>Like my dad taking the extra time</p>
<p>to just give me a thoughtful response opposed to,</p>
<p>kids know, kids know when you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>trying to get out of the room or whatever.</p>
<p>I knew he wasn&rsquo;t and that did a lot.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>But is that a huge, isn&rsquo;t that what makes the artist?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fragility of it that like,</p>
<p>would you have it any other way?</p>
<p>No, no, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s what, that&rsquo;s the beauty of art.</p>
<p>But I think also on the same token, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I went to Music Cares recently,</p>
<p>which is a charity for musicians</p>
<p>that are down on their luck.</p>
<p>That maybe were successful at one point</p>
<p>or have never been successful</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t even pay the bills</p>
<p>and this charity contributes money to these artists,</p>
<p>aspiring artists or artists who&rsquo;ve had drug issues.</p>
<p>And like, there&rsquo;s a lot that they do,</p>
<p>but, and there was a statistic</p>
<p>that they told it was staggering to me,</p>
<p>which is, I think it was 75% of artists, musicians,</p>
<p>say they struggle with severe depression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really high.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the national average is,</p>
<p>but I would guess that that&rsquo;s higher than national average</p>
<p>per occupation.</p>
<p>So I just think there&rsquo;s a tricky balance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tricky balance in art.</p>
<p>So yeah, of course, like it&rsquo;s a necessary thing,</p>
<p>the fragility of it all, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder, cause I&rsquo;m extremely self critical</p>
<p>and I sometimes ask myself the question,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve romanticized it or rather I&rsquo;ve learned to be,</p>
<p>for it to be productive, to channel it into productivity.</p>
<p>But I wonder if there&rsquo;s better ways to do that.</p>
<p>And I also wonder if it&rsquo;s eventually the thing</p>
<p>that destroys me.</p>
<p>Like if longterm, if it&rsquo;s a healthy thing,</p>
<p>it might be useful when you&rsquo;re sort of</p>
<p>actively fighting the battles of the day,</p>
<p>for me it&rsquo;s engineering challenges</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But then when you&rsquo;re sitting back and enjoying life</p>
<p>with family and so on, is that going to be,</p>
<p>like, do you need to find that self love,</p>
<p>like ability to kind of silence the voice of criticism</p>
<p>in your head?</p>
<p>You know what, I really, there&rsquo;s a good,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making a good point.</p>
<p>And I think that the middle ground is you need,</p>
<p>you need self doubt to push you to be better.</p>
<p>I do believe that like, for instance,</p>
<p>if I believed I&rsquo;ve hit my, like when you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>is there a song on there that you think is genius?</p>
<p>If I think I&rsquo;ve written a genius song ever,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d probably stop.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d be like, you know what?</p>
<p>Did it, I wrote, what&rsquo;s that perfect song?</p>
<p>Imagine.</p>
<p>Imagine, yeah.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;d written imagine, I&rsquo;d probably be like, that&rsquo;s it,</p>
<p>did it, all right, perfect song has been written.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best thing I&rsquo;ll ever do.</p>
<p>So the fact that there is like self criticism</p>
<p>and criticism outside, I think is necessary.</p>
<p>A hundred percent for sure.</p>
<p>It pushes you, it pushes you, it pushes you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just finding the right middle ground</p>
<p>for that young aspiring artist to also not feel squashed</p>
<p>and to be heard and to love,</p>
<p>just to not even to feel squashed, just to love themself.</p>
<p>So that when they&rsquo;re in the room playing the song,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll believe it because they believe themself.</p>
<p>They love themself enough that they believe it</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll do a great,</p>
<p>and then the song will come out great</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll do a great performance.</p>
<p>I have to ask, it&rsquo;s one of the very interesting aspects</p>
<p>of your life of the way you put love out there in the world.</p>
<p>What is at the core of your support for the LGBT community?</p>
<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>So one, growing up in, from a young age</p>
<p>in the artist community,</p>
<p>a lot of my closest friends were LGBTQ,</p>
<p>starting in middle school.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of the best artists in the world</p>
<p>are LGBTQ and that&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not a secret.</p>
<p>Like it just is, like the artist community is filled</p>
<p>with lots of LGBTQ people.</p>
<p>So I think being raised in that community</p>
<p>in that my friends struggled with their faith</p>
<p>and their sexuality really opened up my eyes</p>
<p>to how incredibly hard that path is.</p>
<p>For instance, okay, when I was in high school,</p>
<p>there was someone who went in front of,</p>
<p>who was LGBTQ and was Mormon</p>
<p>and felt like there was not a place for them in the church.</p>
<p>They felt like the path, when you&rsquo;re being told</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s evil and you believe it</p>
<p>because you believe in your faith</p>
<p>and you feel like it&rsquo;s unchangeable,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting a kid in a situation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s really no good resolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either be alone for the rest of your life</p>
<p>or marry outside your sexual preference,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t wanna marry a man.</p>
<p>Like if I was forced to marry a man,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t want to marry a man</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m heterosexual.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re forcing a kid into a situation</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very dangerous.</p>
<p>Long story short, this kid went in front</p>
<p>of the Las Vegas Mormon temple and shot himself,</p>
<p>killed himself.</p>
<p>That impacted our community.</p>
<p>Like, and not just that, but it was like severe bullying</p>
<p>to LGBTQ kids in the 90s, it was especially different.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s still bullying, don&rsquo;t get me wrong,</p>
<p>but man, like bullying in school,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know actually what it&rsquo;s like in schools now.</p>
<p>Maybe the bullying is just as bad as it was in the 90s,</p>
<p>but there was like, it was like,</p>
<p>I would hear all the time, like the F slur being slung out</p>
<p>at people who were LGBTQ all the time</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t even LGBTQ.</p>
<p>So I, you know, it&rsquo;s just seeing that,</p>
<p>I think that every, any social justice issue</p>
<p>takes all sides.</p>
<p>It takes all pieces of the puzzle.</p>
<p>If only the pieces of the puzzle contributed</p>
<p>are from the side that is affected,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that we&rsquo;ll ever have resolution.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing a shit job and we need to do better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s the reality of it.</p>
<p>So that was part of the reason I also have family</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s LGBTQ and it&rsquo;s just something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been part of my path.</p>
<p>And I feel like I&rsquo;m a big believer</p>
<p>and take the path that is presented to you.</p>
<p>And this was just something that came up in my life a lot.</p>
<p>When I met my wife, she was living with her two best friends</p>
<p>who were LGBTQ who really didn&rsquo;t want her to marry me</p>
<p>because I was Mormon.</p>
<p>And at the time it was prop eight,</p>
<p>which was Mormons were fighting against LGBT gay marriage.</p>
<p>And so that, then they didn&rsquo;t come to our wedding</p>
<p>and that really broke my wife&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>So it was just like, because Mormonism represented everything</p>
<p>that was against their community.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So you felt you had to say something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I felt like by not saying anything,</p>
<p>I was saying everything.</p>
<p>I felt like by not speaking up and being like,</p>
<p>hey, Dan Reynolds is Mormon singer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this new band, Magic Dragons and they&rsquo;re Mormons.</p>
<p>It was like, okay, well, what do Mormons represent?</p>
<p>They represent prop eight.</p>
<p>What does prop eight represent?</p>
<p>Bigotry towards the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>So what do I do?</p>
<p>Okay, I can speak in every interview and be like,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s not me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that too.</p>
<p>Or I could just be more active about it.</p>
<p>And especially when it&rsquo;s affecting my family</p>
<p>and friends throughout my entire life, it was like,</p>
<p>all right, this seems like a path that you need to go down.</p>
<p>So long story short is a path that just presented itself</p>
<p>through things in my life.</p>
<p>So just on that topic that religion and God</p>
<p>give a lot of meaning to a lot of people.</p>
<p>It gives a tradition that brings people together</p>
<p>across the generations, but it also can hurt people.</p>
<p>What do you make about that tension?</p>
<p>So source of meaning, but also a source of pain for people.</p>
<p>The reality is, at least to me,</p>
<p>again, this is just my reality.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m doing my dad&rsquo;s thing</p>
<p>every time I&rsquo;m talking to him.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t really know, here&rsquo;s my two cents.</p>
<p>You have become your father.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The reality and it&rsquo;s my reality and it is the reality</p>
<p>for sure is there&rsquo;s, I think that religion</p>
<p>has brought a lot of hurt and pain to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Absolutely it has.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody can dispute that on either side,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s war, whether it&rsquo;s slaughtering</p>
<p>of entire peoples, there&rsquo;s been a lot of pain</p>
<p>and suffering that has come from religion.</p>
<p>So my little thing that has been hard for me</p>
<p>is a faith crisis, right?</p>
<p>I had religion and then I lost it and then I had nothing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for me, I was like,</p>
<p>well, religion did that to me, right?</p>
<p>But then at one point it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>how much of my life am I just gonna complain</p>
<p>about being raised Mormon or being depressed?</p>
<p>As I get older, I&rsquo;m like, okay, so what?</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s really hurt me,</p>
<p>but were there any good things that came out of Mormonism?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of good things</p>
<p>that have come to my family through Mormonism.</p>
<p>Closeness, we&rsquo;re really, really close.</p>
<p>Mormon culture is that you live together forever, right?</p>
<p>The teaching is that your families are forever.</p>
<p>We die and then we go to heaven together</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re together forever.</p>
<p>My family really believes that principle, all of them do.</p>
<p>And that instills a certain way of living</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of beautiful, even if it&rsquo;s naivety.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something kind of beautiful</p>
<p>about believing that we&rsquo;re forming these bonds together</p>
<p>as a family and that like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be together forever.</p>
<p>It brings a lot of comfort to a kid too.</p>
<p>When I was little, I was like, wow,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be okay if I die</p>
<p>because I get to see my mom again, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I really believe that.</p>
<p>Is the right answer that you tell that kid,</p>
<p>actually when you die, you&rsquo;re not gonna see your mom again.</p>
<p>Maybe, it might be, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And anybody who has a kid is gonna face that moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already faced it where you sit down</p>
<p>and my kid was like, hey dad,</p>
<p>when you die, am I gonna see you again?</p>
<p>That was actually a really hard moment for me</p>
<p>because I was suddenly faced with,</p>
<p>okay, do I give the answer that I thought was bullshit?</p>
<p>Or do I give the answer of what I think it is?</p>
<p>Or do I give the real answer, which is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I chose,</p>
<p>which as a father, that&rsquo;s not always the easiest answer</p>
<p>because your kid, it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing</p>
<p>that you feel like you can give your kid the comfort of like,</p>
<p>hey, your parents are gonna take care of everything.</p>
<p>We know everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been around.</p>
<p>My kid&rsquo;s always like, are you the strongest?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I am the strongest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stronger than everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m stronger than everybody.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re faced with that moment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it kind of sucks to tell your kid like,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re gonna see me after I die,</p>
<p>but I hope.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I said, I was like, I don&rsquo;t know, but I hope.</p>
<p>I really hope,</p>
<p>because that would be awesome if we can hang out forever.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s any way for it to happen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make it happen.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what my answer was.</p>
<p>So long story short,</p>
<p>sorry, I know that I&rsquo;m being lengthy on this.</p>
<p>Is there like, what is my thought on religion?</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been here forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coping.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s, I can&rsquo;t say whether it&rsquo;s true or false.</p>
<p>How the hell am I supposed to know?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve lived 34 years on this planet.</p>
<p>A lot of people have been around a lot longer than me</p>
<p>and they really believe very deeply.</p>
<p>And a lot of them are smarter than me.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like I look at my older brothers, for instance,</p>
<p>who are very practicing Mormons.</p>
<p>These guys are hyper intelligent.</p>
<p>My younger sister, hyper intelligent.</p>
<p>All of them start smarter than me.</p>
<p>They all believe it still.</p>
<p>So what am I supposed to say?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re all stupid.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re all wrong.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like maybe it&rsquo;s the South Park episode</p>
<p>where everybody dies and then they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, the right answer was Mormonism.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s like, aww.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like Mormons love that moment in South Park.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, hey, that day may come.</p>
<p>That day may come.</p>
<p>Yeah, so maybe I don&rsquo;t know is the honest answer</p>
<p>for everybody around the table.</p>
<p>But the biggest question</p>
<p>for which I don&rsquo;t know is the right answer</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not allowed to say I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You can be just like your dad and say,</p>
<p>let me just give my two cents.</p>
<p>Take it or leave it.</p>
<p>Whatever it&rsquo;s worth, take it or leave it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably worth nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s piddled on the ground.</p>
<p>I mean, why are we here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just busily creating all these kinds of things,</p>
<p>worrying about things, having kids.</p>
<p>My purpose, at least right now,</p>
<p>is to wake up and try to</p>
<p>to bring light love to the world,</p>
<p>light love to myself and have integrity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my purpose.</p>
<p>The ultimate purpose of life,</p>
<p>that I guess that&rsquo;s my ultimate purpose of life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happens when I die.</p>
<p>Ayahuasca gave me some sense that there&rsquo;s more to be known.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are other things in life</p>
<p>that would give me that, and I&rsquo;m looking for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a seeker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for the next something</p>
<p>to give me hope in something more,</p>
<p>even if so, I could just not bullshit my kids</p>
<p>when they ask me that question and be like,</p>
<p>you know what, I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I wanna not know more, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna, I want to see things that make me confused,</p>
<p>that make me question what I already knew.</p>
<p>Like I am like, when I meet an atheist who comes up to me</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, atheism, atheism, atheism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just as laughable to me as when I meet the Mormon</p>
<p>who comes up and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>Mormonism, Mormonism, Mormonism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how do you, how do anyone, how do you guys know?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d like, like, you know.</p>
<p>So you feel like you&rsquo;re doing some, through all your travels,</p>
<p>through all the people you meet,</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re still keeping your eyes open</p>
<p>and your heart open to sort of discover something new,</p>
<p>like the ayahuasca experience,</p>
<p>that there might be deeper truths out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I wanna find them,</p>
<p>and I wanna surround myself with people</p>
<p>who are just looking for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in people who are just looking</p>
<p>to point fingers at each, like life is so short.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>that I wanna meet with you is I was like, wow,</p>
<p>Lex really seems like he&rsquo;s on a journey to find truth.</p>
<p>And that humility for me is same thing with Rick.</p>
<p>It drew me to Rick.</p>
<p>It was like, I really, I see that and identify with it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the final song on our record,</p>
<p>our new record that&rsquo;s coming out.</p>
<p>The chorus goes, and this is like,</p>
<p>this is my best answer to what you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>So the chorus goes,</p>
<p>take it easy on me.</p>
<p>I need some lullaby.</p>
<p>They tell me heaven&rsquo;s just a lie.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not surprised.</p>
<p>Tell me that you know.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re just like me.</p>
<p>Can we just all hope for the best?</p>
<p>Take it easy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m in a place where I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Tell me, I&rsquo;m not gonna believe you.</p>
<p>Maybe you do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna believe it,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just be easier on each other</p>
<p>and try to find truth wherever it may lie.</p>
<p>But above all, know that we don&rsquo;t know jack shit.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a mic drop moment.</p>
<p>Dan, thank you so much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible human.</p>
<p>I love that you share with the world</p>
<p>the darkness of your mind, of your life experience</p>
<p>and the beautiful light that you&rsquo;ve shown to the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a huge honor</p>
<p>and thank you for spending your valuable time.</p>
<p>Good luck on the tour.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Dan Reynolds.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Aldous Huxley.</p>
<p>After silence, that which comes nearest</p>
<p>to expressing the inexpressible is music.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
