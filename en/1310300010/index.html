    <p>This is an All Ears English podcast, episode 1923.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t avoid this episode.</p>
<p>How to prevent mistakes in English.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All Ears English podcast, downloaded more than 200 million times.</p>
<p>Are you feeling stuck with your English?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll show you how to become fearless and fluent by focusing on connection,</p>
<p>not perfection with your American hosts, Lindsay McMahon, the English adventurer,</p>
<p>and Michelle Kaplan, the New York radio girl coming to you from Colorado and New York City, USA.</p>
<p>To get real-time transcripts right on your phone and create your personalized vocabulary list,</p>
<p>try the All Ears English app for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Start your seven-day free trial at allearsenglish.com forward slash app.</p>
<p>What is the difference between prevent and avoid?</p>
<p>Today, we answer a great listener question with real-life examples,</p>
<p>role plays, and more. Listen in to discover English alongside Lindsay and Michelle.</p>
<p>Hello, Michelle. How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>Hey, Lindsay. Um, are you avoiding me?</p>
<p>Uh, I wasn&rsquo;t. I wasn&rsquo;t, but&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, I don&rsquo;t think you are. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be podcasting together if you were avoiding me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be pretty, that&rsquo;s pretty awkward if you&rsquo;re avoiding somebody you work with.</p>
<p>That would be very awkward and frankly, unprofessional, right?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really do that. We can only really do that in our personal lives, avoid someone.</p>
<p>Right. Well, we should. Well, I don&rsquo;t think we should avoid people in general, but,</p>
<p>but yeah, at work, that would be really bad.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I have had the situation where, you know, do you ever have the situation? I think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked you this before on the podcast, where you&rsquo;ve become sort of friends with someone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve hung out with them a few times, and then all of a sudden you realize it&rsquo;s not a friend</p>
<p>match, right? Like there&rsquo;s romantic, but it&rsquo;s not even a match in terms of being friends. Maybe</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the same values or you&rsquo;re just kind of bored around the person. And how do you,</p>
<p>how do you get out of that when they really want to be your friend? Like they keep texting you.</p>
<p>What do you even say? Cause there is a context for it romantically.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But in terms of friends, there&rsquo;s nothing really in our language to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s incredibly awkward and painful to do that. And because I don&rsquo;t think anybody</p>
<p>ever wants to be mean. Like I don&rsquo;t think people are like, I would like to be mean, right?</p>
<p>Of course not. Right.</p>
<p>So I think that it can be really uncomfortable. Yeah. That&rsquo;s an awkward situation to feel like</p>
<p>you want to avoid like a new friend or something.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;ll come back to that another day in a different episode.</p>
<p>Yeah. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m the greatest at knowing how to do something like</p>
<p>that, but I could think about it. But Lindsay, are you avoiding anything in your life?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a great question. Oh, big question. Maybe the child decision.</p>
<p>I might be avoiding that one a little bit, but I won&rsquo;t share too much on the show. But yeah,</p>
<p>I might be, you know, kicking the can down the road a little bit too far. Maybe.</p>
<p>Well, that is a big decision.</p>
<p>Right. We can avoid little things or we can also avoid big things, big life-changing things. Right.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think avoiding decisions is very common. Like I&rsquo;m avoiding</p>
<p>moving, like deciding where to move. And, you know, it&rsquo;s like when you know,</p>
<p>like a decision needs to be made. But I&rsquo;m outgrowing my apartment.</p>
<p>Are you looking to move out of your apartment? Right. You guys are a big family now.</p>
<p>Yeah. We&rsquo;re stuffed. So.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. It&rsquo;s too much. Too much. Okay.</p>
<p>But yeah. Yeah. Like those big decisions, like what you&rsquo;re saying, you can avoid them and put</p>
<p>them off is an expression you can use to put something off.</p>
<p>You can for sure. So we have a question from a listener today. Right. This is from Marcos. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to go ahead and read the question. Are you ready, Michelle?</p>
<p>All right. Yeah, please.</p>
<p>He says, Hi, guys. First of all, I want to thank you for your podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by far one of the best shows for English students. I&rsquo;m a listener from the very beginning</p>
<p>of 2015. Oh, my gosh. So Marcos is one of our long time listeners, Michelle. I love that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s so nice. Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you, Marcos, for listening. So here we go. I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Could you explain the difference, different nuances between avoid and prevent to sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to know how to use one or the other best Marcos from Barcelona.</p>
<p>I want to go to Barcelona. Me too. That would be great.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great question. And it&rsquo;s funny because at first I was like, oh, well, this is</p>
<p>obvious. And then as I got I mean, not obvious, but I felt like I could just, you know, really</p>
<p>plan this one. No, no problem. But then I was getting into it. I&rsquo;m like, yeah, it can be it</p>
<p>can be a little bit tricky. So, Lindsay, what is prevent? Let&rsquo;s start with prevent.</p>
<p>OK, so, guys, so write this down. Get ready, because it&rsquo;s a great question. And, you know,</p>
<p>there are layers to English. There are nuances, as Marcos said. We&rsquo;re going to show you them now.</p>
<p>So prevent means to stop something that you don&rsquo;t want to happen. Right. So maybe you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>ahead about something. Something is coming. For example, in order to prevent luggage from</p>
<p>weighing too much, we should pack light. OK, that&rsquo;s one. What else, Michelle?</p>
<p>Or she prevented an injury by using her hands to break her fall.</p>
<p>Oh, then you break your wrists, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but that&rsquo;s good. Yeah,</p>
<p>for sure. So preventing things. I&rsquo;m trying to think of something recently, you know. Yeah,</p>
<p>I tried to prevent the wine bottles from breaking when I came back from Argentina. I had to bring</p>
<p>back some Malbec, obviously. I tried to prevent them from breaking by wrapping them, you know,</p>
<p>in lots of things and putting them in the middle of the suitcase. Right.</p>
<p>OK, good, good, good, good. Exactly. So avoid. Now let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s move on to avoid. So this involves</p>
<p>not being somewhere or not talking to someone. So the dictionary mentioned, I quote,</p>
<p>to steer clear of something or someone. Right. So, for example, I&rsquo;m going to avoid her because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have a confrontation. That&rsquo;s kind of cool that the dictionary</p>
<p>used sort of an idiom or an expression to define it. Right. So that could be a bonus</p>
<p>for our listeners today. Steer clear of something. That&rsquo;s good stuff. Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah. Avoid her. So maybe, you know, not not go near her kind of if you&rsquo;re at a party</p>
<p>and pretend you don&rsquo;t see someone. Have you ever done that, Michelle?</p>
<p>Oh, well, you know, OK, I hear this is what I will do. Do you ever like you&rsquo;re walking down</p>
<p>the street and you see like canvassers who are. Oh, stop you. I try to avoid them. Sometimes I</p>
<p>just look away or sometimes I the confession. Sometimes I pick up my phone and I pretend to</p>
<p>be on it. But you&rsquo;re not. I&rsquo;ve never done that. But I do sometimes like do a big loop around</p>
<p>on the sidewalks. Yeah, it must be a tough job. Right. That canvassing. Oh, yeah. I feel for them.</p>
<p>I actually feel for people who do this. It is hard. Like you really have to put yourself out</p>
<p>there and just have and like people don&rsquo;t want to stop to talk to you. So they&rsquo;re avoiding you.</p>
<p>Yeah, they and they often make fun of themselves and come up with a funny line,</p>
<p>you know what I mean? Which is good. You have to you have to have a sense of humor</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re being rejected like 10,000 times a day. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There&rsquo;s this one</p>
<p>just they set up right by my apartment. I forget what it was for. And every time I walk by,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like with my two kids or like with like the baby, like feeding her and like pushing the</p>
<p>stroller on the way to get my son like from school. And I&rsquo;m just like so. And then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, hey, super mom. I&rsquo;m like, hey, super mom. No, I like. Oh, wow. Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard. Yeah. But</p>
<p>I do feel feel for that. It&rsquo;s not an easy job. But let&rsquo;s another example of avoid.</p>
<p>OK, lost my place. So let&rsquo;s see where we want you to hop in there, Michelle. OK,</p>
<p>so the next example is let&rsquo;s avoid Times Square right now because there&rsquo;s too much traffic.</p>
<p>Yes. Avoid Times Square. And in general, I think I would recommend that all the time.</p>
<p>Right. Or you could or someone might say, why are you avoiding me now? This is something that a</p>
<p>close someone in your family might say. Right. This is when you&rsquo;re closer to someone. You would</p>
<p>say this. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. If you say it to someone, you don&rsquo;t know. Well, that it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Be way too strong. It&rsquo;s weird. Yeah. So don&rsquo;t. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think so. But OK,</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s switch these examples. OK. And see if they still make sense. So this is kind of</p>
<p>an exercise. So here this goes back to the prevent example. So so we originally said,</p>
<p>what is with my headphone? We originally stick that thing in my ear. We originally said in order</p>
<p>to prevent luggage from weighing too much, we should pack light now. OK, switch it in order</p>
<p>to avoid luggage from weighing too much. We should pack light. Now, how does that sound to you?</p>
<p>It sounds a little weird to me. Does that sound weird to you?</p>
<p>It sounds a little bit weird to me in order to avoid. But like, technically,</p>
<p>it kind of it technically. Yeah. Well, I think grammatically I would rather say in order to</p>
<p>avoid having the luggage way too much. I think we need grammatically something different in there.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;d have to go into the grammar another day on it. Yeah. In order to or I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure maybe we&rsquo;ll get into keep from keep something from doing something would be a bonus for today.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll get into it later. In order to keep the luggage from weighing too much,</p>
<p>we should pack light. But I I think avoid luggage from weighing too much feels very</p>
<p>sound. Something sounds a little bit off, right? Yeah. Yeah. I don&rsquo;t think it works</p>
<p>unless we change the wording. Right. True. But now let&rsquo;s try this one. So we did.</p>
<p>She prevented an injury by using her hands to break her fall. Now switch it.</p>
<p>Yeah. This one works a little better. So she avoided an injury by using her hands to break</p>
<p>her fall. So I think that&rsquo;s fine. So it&rsquo;s kind of interesting because this is when I said,</p>
<p>like, at first I started planning this episode. OK, I got this. And then I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>sometimes you can use them a little bit more interchangeably. I think prevent is is definitely</p>
<p>like a definite stop, whereas avoid in some contexts is more like you&rsquo;re moving around</p>
<p>something. Yeah. Yeah. Moving around. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. I would I would say that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably true. What about this next one? I&rsquo;m going to prevent her because I don&rsquo;t want to have a</p>
<p>comfort. So prevent her from doing what? Prevent. Well, originally it was I&rsquo;m going to. No,</p>
<p>so that does not work. Doesn&rsquo;t work. Doesn&rsquo;t work. OK. And now let&rsquo;s see what happens with</p>
<p>the Times Square example. So we said let&rsquo;s avoid Times Square right now because there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>traffic. Let&rsquo;s prevent Times Square right now because. No, no, no, no. Say that.</p>
<p>Right. So that&rsquo;s why I think avoid has a little something more to do with physics,</p>
<p>like kind of physical movement or like or not just physical, but like planning logistics.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Right. Like how we can switch. But Lindsay, could I say to you, why are you preventing</p>
<p>me? Well, no, no, no, no. Are you avoiding me? No, no. You you could say, why are you preventing me</p>
<p>from doing something? Something. But that totally that changes the meaning. Right.</p>
<p>It changes the meaning. So, no, you can&rsquo;t say, why are you can&rsquo;t say, why are you preventing me</p>
<p>just for avoiding? No. So in half the cases, Michelle, it&rsquo;s interchangeable. And the other</p>
<p>half, it&rsquo;s not. Right. So like we found it might be a little bit easier to slot avoid in to prevent.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re if you start if the basic one is avoid, you can&rsquo;t necessarily if it&rsquo;s truly about</p>
<p>like getting around something in that context, then prevent won&rsquo;t work because prevent is really</p>
<p>like stop. Interesting. So this is trickier. This is a can of worms, as we say. Right. Right. Right.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re going to go through it. We&rsquo;re going to go through it a little bit deeper.</p>
<p>I love it. Here we go. OK, Michelle, so let&rsquo;s get deeper. We see the problem now. We see</p>
<p>and sometimes they&rsquo;re interchangeable. Sometimes they&rsquo;re not. Let&rsquo;s go deeper for our listeners</p>
<p>here. OK, well, basically, again, guys, I think the key difference is prevent is more about like</p>
<p>really trying to stop something. Avoid is more about this process of the getting around. OK,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like about that process. But OK, so what one expression that keeps popping into my head</p>
<p>is like avoid any confusion. Right. Do you ever hear that? Like in order to avoid any confusion?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say we should like in order to avoid any confusion, we&rsquo;ll post signs with</p>
<p>directions to the classrooms. Right. Right. Right. So you&rsquo;re asking, could we say prevent</p>
<p>any confusion? Yeah. Hmm. I think you could get away with that. I think so, too. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think sometimes. Right. Like they&rsquo;re both about this attempt to stop it. Right. Right. Right. Right.</p>
<p>Yeah. We&rsquo;re attempting to stop something. I think where it ends up being the most different is when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about physical movement, like your example or actually my example, both of us said</p>
<p>physically avoiding the people, the canvassers on the street. Yeah. Like you veer to the left</p>
<p>to avoid the car. Right. That&rsquo;s interesting. You veer to the left to avoid the car, but to</p>
<p>prevent the accident. You don&rsquo;t veer to the left to prevent the car. So prevent would be more for</p>
<p>events. Right. And avoid could be for events or like people, physical obstructions. Right. Right.</p>
<p>Right. Right. Right. Right. I&rsquo;m not going to prevent the people on the street. Right. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>avoiding the canvassers. I&rsquo;m not preventing them. However, I&rsquo;m preventing them from talking to me.</p>
<p>Exactly. Yes. So that&rsquo;s good. That&rsquo;s a good insight there.</p>
<p>Mm hmm. Interesting. Interesting. And here&rsquo;s another one. In order to prevent</p>
<p>getting pickpocketed, I always wear a belly bag.</p>
<p>Yeah. We know you told us this story in London, Paris.</p>
<p>Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Amsterdam. OK. You got pickpocketed in Amsterdam. Yeah. It&rsquo;s OK. It happens to the best of us. Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So in order to prevent getting pickpocketed.</p>
<p>But if I say in order to avoid getting pickpocketed, I always wear a belly bag.</p>
<p>Now, to me, the difference is to prevent getting pickpocketed sounds more like a definite thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an it&rsquo;s an event. Right. It&rsquo;s an event.</p>
<p>An event. Right. Yeah. But the truth is, I feel like avoid is the better decision because I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>completely prevent it.</p>
<p>Completely prevent it. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Avoid. Prevent. Right. So you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>prevent kind of implies that we have more control over this event. Prevent. I mean,</p>
<p>if you look at the word prevent, stop an event. Right.</p>
<p>Right. Pre. Ah, look at you.</p>
<p>Oh, look at that. We&rsquo;re such linguists here at All Ears English.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re discovering our language alongside you guys.</p>
<p>Yeah. So. So. Right. No, I mean, I kind of think that this is cool, like when we can</p>
<p>really talk it through. Yeah. Together. And it&rsquo;s complicated. It is nuanced. So this is</p>
<p>absolutely right. It is complicated. But I think the basic things there are some basic things to</p>
<p>remember. And so let&rsquo;s just remind our listeners of like those core things to remember. Avoid</p>
<p>is more about like kind of getting away from some situation, from a person or from a process.</p>
<p>Right. It could be from a person. It could be an event. Prevent is to stop something from</p>
<p>happening. Some event from happening. Yes. I love it. That&rsquo;s the those are the broad</p>
<p>brushstrokes of the differences. And then at that point, guys,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start using this in conversation. So should we give some examples?</p>
<p>Yeah. Should we do a roleplay?</p>
<p>Yeah. Let&rsquo;s do a roleplay. Let&rsquo;s jump into the roleplay and then maybe we&rsquo;ll come back</p>
<p>to some more examples. Right. So here we go. Michelle, what is happening?</p>
<p>All right. So, Lindsay, I haven&rsquo;t spoken to you in weeks.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh. But we ran into it. Yeah, I know. I&rsquo;m sorry. But we ran</p>
<p>into each other at the grocery store. All right. Here we go.</p>
<p>Hi, Michelle. Oh, hi, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Are you avoiding me?</p>
<p>What? No, of course not.</p>
<p>Oh, well, it seems like something is off. I want to make sure we talk through things</p>
<p>in the future to prevent any issues when it comes to how the bills are paid.</p>
<p>Oh, Lindsay, I really want to avoid confrontation, so I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Yes, but please don&rsquo;t prevent me from fixing the problem.</p>
<p>OK. All right. We&rsquo;ll work it out. Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>Thanks. So, wow. Yeah. Did you say that we&rsquo;re roommates here? I didn&rsquo;t catch that part.</p>
<p>I guess we would be roommates. Yeah, I guess we would be roommates. Yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true. I didn&rsquo;t say that specifically.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. That&rsquo;s not good. Oh, man. I had roommates for so long, so many years. And</p>
<p>you did, too, Michelle. And there must have been so many awkward moments and paying bills,</p>
<p>paying rent. My roommate used to get mad at me because I would I would get sick a lot in New</p>
<p>York. Just I think the subway, all the germs. But I would still go out like I would sometimes still</p>
<p>go. Not we&rsquo;re not talking about pandemic sick. Right. This is like this is 20 20 2007 sick,</p>
<p>like a little cough, a little sore throat. No big deal. And I would still go to work because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t take so many days. You can&rsquo;t take every day off of work. You have to go to work.</p>
<p>And she would get mad at me. And so we would we would really get into this weird back and</p>
<p>forth about like I have to work. But she would get sick. Right. So I would go out, get sick,</p>
<p>bring it home. Oh, and then she would get mad at you. Oh, my gosh. We&rsquo;re going to work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Roommate life. Michelle, what can you do? So. All right. So this is a good example</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re throwing out prevent avoid in a lot of different ways. So let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>OK. So you said, are you avoiding me? Right. Are you avoiding me? Right. So I feel like socially</p>
<p>something a person, a person avoiding a person. So we know that&rsquo;s definitely a void because I</p>
<p>would never say, are you preventing me? Never, never. OK, that&rsquo;s the one clear takeaway from</p>
<p>today. I know we got a lot. We got we got a couple. We got a couple. But I know it is</p>
<p>challenging. It&rsquo;s one of those things you&rsquo;ll be listening to now and you&rsquo;ll and you&rsquo;ll hear,</p>
<p>oh, and I hear these. Yeah, exactly. So what&rsquo;s the next one, Michelle, that I used?</p>
<p>OK, so you said, I want to make sure we talk things through in the future to prevent any issues. OK,</p>
<p>so to prevent any issues. And I think here I could also say avoid. Yeah. Yeah. It&rsquo;s more about that</p>
<p>situation, the situation. I love it. And then you said, Lindsay, I really want to avoid confrontation,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. I think also one of the thing to say is that if you have a</p>
<p>choice between the two, prevent feels a little more formal to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think so,</p>
<p>too. And an avoid confrontation. I would almost say that that&rsquo;s just a chunk like that. Yeah. You</p>
<p>know, you say I don&rsquo;t think you ever say like prevent confrontation. I feel like it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>you say to avoid confrontation. Yeah, exactly. So we can learn this in chunks, too, guys. And</p>
<p>you will start doing that as you&rsquo;re listening to English more and more. And then, Michelle,</p>
<p>what else? All right. And then you said, please don&rsquo;t prevent me from fixing the problem. Right.</p>
<p>And we could never put a void there. Right. Please don&rsquo;t avoid me from fixing. No, it wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t work. And then I say, OK, well, I&rsquo;ll work it out. Let&rsquo;s talk. I just want to touch on</p>
<p>our listener asked about prevent to do we ever say prevent to know it&rsquo;s more often prevent from</p>
<p>prevent you from doing something. Right. Yeah, we really and we also don&rsquo;t say avoid to right now.</p>
<p>So take out two entirely, Marco. I love it. Maybe just a quick real world example here. Michelle,</p>
<p>are you doing anything right now to prevent something from happening? Are you doing anything</p>
<p>to prevent something from happening? Am I doing anything to prevent something from happening? I</p>
<p>am. Oh, my gosh, I know what? Yeah, well, I could throw in an example if you&rsquo;re drawing a blank,</p>
<p>but did you have one? It sounds like you had an example. I didn&rsquo;t. I actually know what I was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny. Sometimes I write down these questions and then I should think of my</p>
<p>answer when I&rsquo;m planning it. But instead, I&rsquo;m like, well, let&rsquo;s see what Lindsey has to say.</p>
<p>OK, put the burden on me. I got it. Well, I do have an answer. So every time it snows,</p>
<p>we put down pet safe salt to prevent our dog from getting his paws irritated. Oh,</p>
<p>to prevent our dog from getting his paw because sometimes the salt you put on the on the road</p>
<p>could really like we had to carry him home once, like we literally had to put him on our shoulder</p>
<p>and carry him home from the park because he had so much pain in his feet. Oh, sweetie.</p>
<p>Right. So that&rsquo;s good to prevent it from happening. Exactly. Stop it. You want to</p>
<p>stop it completely. And I think that&rsquo;s almost stronger than avoid because</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a little bit stronger. You don&rsquo;t want him to. Yeah. In that situation. Yeah.</p>
<p>So I think for our listeners, guys, you know, what&rsquo;s the takeaway here,</p>
<p>Michelle? Where can we leave our listeners on this one?</p>
<p>OK, it&rsquo;s more complicated than it seems. The difference between those two guys. I know we,</p>
<p>Lindsey and I kind of went on this journey through this episode, discovering the differences</p>
<p>and really learning about it. So I think one of the takeaways is like, don&rsquo;t stress sometimes</p>
<p>about these about these differences. Sometimes if you aren&rsquo;t really sure of the difference,</p>
<p>start to just listen for it out. Listen, maybe for some chunks you hear and and realize that</p>
<p>there can be a lot of nuances. And it&rsquo;s OK to kind of learn those things over time.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right. And to get used to it. Right. It may not be something where right away it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one like boom, boom. Here&rsquo;s the answer. Language is complicated and there are a lot of different</p>
<p>things to it. And learning those nuances sometimes, you know, so like but what you</p>
<p>can do is start with some of the basics. Sure. For sure. For sure. And we&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>started here today. There&rsquo;s no perfect grammatical formula that we can show you</p>
<p>on this. Unfortunately, I wish there was. But don&rsquo;t forget that what matters is connection,</p>
<p>not perfection. That&rsquo;s what it always comes back to, Michelle. I love it. Yeah, absolutely. All</p>
