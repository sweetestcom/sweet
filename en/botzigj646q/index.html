﻿i&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the benefits of something called tudca okay what does it stand for well it&amp;rsquo;s a very very long name for a very specific bile acid and this type of bile acid has been found to be present in bearers now they used to kill a lot of bears just for this bile because it was so valuable um but now they made it synthetically which seems to work pretty good and um they don&amp;rsquo;t have to kill the bears anymore which is a good thing but this treatment using this very specific bile acid has been used for hundreds of years in asia it&amp;rsquo;s been used by the american indians for various purposes it&amp;rsquo;s used for treating gallstones because a gallstone is a lack of bile and it&amp;rsquo;s a super concentrated cholesterol stone that can be dissolved when you add more bile also this type of bile acid is used for liver cirrhosis because it inhibits fibrosis which is scarring of the liver so anyway it&amp;rsquo;s a really great ingredient for a lot of different things especially if you tried everything and nothing&amp;rsquo;s worked try this because it&amp;rsquo;s very very effective at a lot of different conditions let&amp;rsquo;s just talk about what it can do it can help you thin your bile many people have a situation where their bile is too thick and they might not develop a stone but they have a lot of pain in the right lower quadrant of their abdomen so they have a lot of congestion bloating and that can create pancreatitis it can create a whole bunch of issues because the bile then backs up into the liver and it&amp;rsquo;s a detergent so it&amp;rsquo;s very very irritating to the liver tissue and that can cause pain and shoot up to your right shoulder blade and up to the neck and create headaches create a whole bunch of problems now also realize that where the liver is located on the right side when it gets backed up it can put pressure on the heart it can put pressure on your lungs so it can affect breathing it can affect the heart it can create palpitations and even arrhythmias by having the liver being a little bit too swollen and because there&amp;rsquo;s just not enough space in that area so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of benefits to the heart by taking this tudca now some of you are gonna ask me um what type of brand should i buy whatever well i&amp;rsquo;m not gonna recommend a certain brand that&amp;rsquo;s up to you to do that research because i can&amp;rsquo;t get involved with um trying to figure out what the quality is and regulate them because if i recommend a certain product and then they change the formula so you just have to do your own research on that but i recommend the dosage to start out if you have a major problem take two on an empty stomach in the morning and take two in the afternoon and empty stomach but if you take it with food it&amp;rsquo;s going to help you digest the food all right number two there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of research in the past in ongoing research on the eyes on retinal degenerative disease on various problems with the eye on improving visual acuity why because bile helps you break down and absorb vitamin a and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of other reasons why it helps the eye as well number three it&amp;rsquo;s been shown to improve symptoms of parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease why because it&amp;rsquo;s neuroprotective it seems to help the neurons in your brain it also has shown positive effects on alf that is a certain autoimmune disease okay so if you have als you should be taking cut cup number five it&amp;rsquo;s shown benefits of not just preventing a stroke but also repairing the damage of a stroke because it&amp;rsquo;s neural protective in your brain all right number six it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s good for spasms number seven it can reduce fevers number eight it can improve your eyesight which i mentioned previously number nine it prevents something called apoptosis which is program cell death caused by a stressed mitochondria so in other words tutka helps to stabilize the mitochondria and it prevents this program cell death very very powerful number 10 it has very good anti-inflammatory effects especially of the liver so if you have any liver problem like cirrhosis hepatitis or or a fatty liver this would be a good thing to take number 11 it can decrease fibrosis which is very cool number 12."><meta property="og:url" content="https://swiest.com/en/botzigj646q/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="SWIEST - Transcripts · Screenplays ·

called tudca okay what does it stand for well it&rsquo;s  </p><p>a very very long name for a very specific bile 
acid and this type of bile acid has been found  </p><p>to be present in bearers now they used 
to kill a lot of bears just for this bile  </p><p>because it was so valuable um but now 
they made it synthetically which seems  </p><p>to work pretty good and um they don&rsquo;t have to 
kill the bears anymore which is a good thing  </p><p>but this treatment using this very specific bile 
acid has been used for hundreds of years in asia  </p><p>it&rsquo;s been used by the american indians for 
various purposes it&rsquo;s used for treating gallstones  </p><p>because a gallstone is a lack of bile and it&rsquo;s a 
super concentrated cholesterol stone that can be  </p><p>dissolved when you add more bile also this type of 
bile acid is used for liver cirrhosis because it  </p><p>inhibits fibrosis which is scarring of the liver 
so anyway it&rsquo;s a really great ingredient for  </p><p>a lot of different things especially if 
you tried everything and nothing&rsquo;s worked  </p><p>try this because it&rsquo;s very very effective 
at a lot of different conditions  </p><p>let&rsquo;s just talk about what it can do it can help 
you thin your bile many people have a situation  </p><p>where their bile is too thick and they might 
not develop a stone but they have a lot of pain  </p><p>in the right lower quadrant of their abdomen so 
they have a lot of congestion bloating and that  </p><p>can create pancreatitis it can create a whole 
bunch of issues because the bile then backs up  </p><p>into the liver and it&rsquo;s a detergent so it&rsquo;s very 
very irritating to the liver tissue and that can  </p><p>cause pain and shoot up to your right shoulder 
blade and up to the neck and create headaches  </p><p>create a whole bunch of problems now also realize 
that where the liver is located on the right side  </p><p>when it gets backed up it can put pressure 
on the heart it can put pressure on your  </p><p>lungs so it can affect breathing it 
can affect the heart it can create  </p><p>palpitations and even arrhythmias by having 
the liver being a little bit too swollen  </p><p>and because there&rsquo;s just not enough space in that 
area so there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits to the heart  </p><p>by taking this tudca now some of you are gonna 
ask me um what type of brand should i buy whatever  </p><p>well i&rsquo;m not gonna recommend a certain brand 
that&rsquo;s up to you to do that research because i  </p><p>can&rsquo;t get involved with um trying to figure out 
what the quality is and regulate them because  </p><p>if i recommend a certain product and then they 
change the formula so you just have to do your  </p><p>own research on that but i recommend the dosage 
to start out if you have a major problem take two  </p><p>on an empty stomach in the morning and take 
two in the afternoon and empty stomach but  </p><p>if you take it with food it&rsquo;s going to help you 
digest the food all right number two there&rsquo;s been  </p><p>a lot of research in the past in ongoing research 
on the eyes on retinal degenerative disease  </p><p>on various problems with the eye on improving 
visual acuity why because bile helps you break  </p><p>down and absorb vitamin a and there&rsquo;s a lot 
of other reasons why it helps the eye as well  </p><p>number three it&rsquo;s been shown to improve 
symptoms of parkinson&rsquo;s disease why because  </p><p>it&rsquo;s neuroprotective it seems to help the neurons 
in your brain it also has shown positive effects  </p><p>on alf that is a certain autoimmune disease 
okay so if you have als you should be taking  </p><p>cut cup number five it&rsquo;s shown benefits 
of not just preventing a stroke but also  </p><p>repairing the damage of a stroke because 
it&rsquo;s neural protective in your brain  </p><p>all right number six it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s good for 
spasms number seven it can reduce fevers  </p><p>number eight it can improve your eyesight which 
i mentioned previously number nine it prevents  </p><p>something called apoptosis which is program 
cell death caused by a stressed mitochondria  </p><p>so in other words tutka helps to stabilize 
the mitochondria and it prevents this  </p><p>program cell death very very powerful number 10 it 
has very good anti-inflammatory effects especially  </p><p>of the liver so if you have any liver problem like 
cirrhosis hepatitis or or a fatty liver this would  </p><p>be a good thing to take number 11 it can decrease 
fibrosis which is very cool number 12. it protects  </p><p>the brain i already mentioned that and it can 
decrease plaquing of those beta amyloid plaques  </p><p>in the brain very cool 13 it can support insulin 
sensitivity so if you have insulin resistance it  </p><p>can help with that condition it can make insulin 
more sensitive so for a diabetic it&rsquo;s really good  </p><p>stuff number 14 it supports the gut lining if you 
have leaky gut or there&rsquo;s some permeability issues  </p><p>where there&rsquo;s food that&rsquo;s getting into the pores 
of your intestine this would be a good thing to  </p><p>support that condition especially if you have like 
inflammation of the colon itself and number 15 it  </p><p>helps protect the kidney so as you can see it does 
a lot of things and i just scratched the surface  </p><p>so anyway i just wanted to bring your awareness up 
of this great tool in helping various conditions  </p><p>i&rsquo;ve mentioned it in other videos but i just 
wanted to create a separate video just on this  </p><p>one very cool bile acid hey before you go 
real quick i have a course entitled how to  </p><p>bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a free 
course i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone
