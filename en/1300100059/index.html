<p>writing comedy it gives you like</p>
<p>joke beginning to start talking shit</p>
<p>about things it&rsquo;s fun yeah but I&rsquo;m nervous</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nervous that</p>
<p>they I would become too exposed</p>
<p>what are you talking about</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>I would become too exposed as as like you know</p>
<p>a go to guy for free</p>
<p>you know what I mean it&rsquo;s like you know am I gonna</p>
<p>I write hours and hours of material you know</p>
<p>right now I have 3 and 1/2</p>
<p>maybe 4 hours in rotation that I do separately</p>
<p>awesome and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all different</p>
<p>stuff and it&rsquo;s all the same basic thing</p>
<p>and so I found myself just writing the same</p>
<p>thing over and over again</p>
<p>in a different</p>
<p>form in a different subject you know what I mean</p>
<p>the same formula</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m nervous that I</p>
<p>would get polluted by</p>
<p>other comedians and and you know</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to open myself up</p>
<p>by other comedians</p>
<p>you have to follow anybody don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to follow and you can some people like I don&rsquo;t</p>

<p>never replied had</p>
<p>never replied</p>
<p>to anybody 0 followers you try to make her</p>
<p>reply she will not</p>
<p>do it she&rsquo;s almost seems like she&rsquo;s like an app like</p>
<p>and you know it just</p>
<p>automatically puts something sexy</p>
<p>mixed with something</p>
<p>you might be</p>
<p>absolutely right</p>
<p>about that because I&rsquo;ve read some of</p>
<p>those that she</p>
<p>writes cause they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>featured on websites and shit and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re crazy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all like</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go down to this high</p>
<p>school and try to get 5 dudes to</p>
<p>shoot loads and me right</p>
<p>right I&rsquo;m at</p>
<p>the airport</p>

<p>dried come in my face</p>
<p>but if you watch your</p>
<p>videos you like well</p>

<p>excellent sense of humor</p>
<p>she gets it</p>
<p>Brody Steven she gets set take me</p>
<p>she can take me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird man we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this on the podcast before</p>
<p>the was she one of the girls that</p>
<p>in like the biggest slut contest perhaps</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe yeah I</p>
<p>think you probably right</p>
<p>yeah and she</p>
<p>was talking about</p>
<p>fuck a retard and</p>
<p>fuck dude those</p>
<p>I love it fucking</p>
<p>Tarz that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>those girls that do</p>
<p>those gang bangs</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s a different species that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>human bro that&rsquo;s another kind of</p>
<p>human speaking another</p>
<p>human I saw Jay London picking up</p>
<p>trash on Laurel Canyon</p>
<p>wow creep me out</p>
<p>you go from</p>
<p>he was picking up trash</p>
<p>for somebody is he working</p>
<p>man he had an orange jacket on I mean an orange vest on</p>
<p>maybe did something then he got arrested</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know isn&rsquo;t that what usually that is</p>
<p>is that guy</p>
<p>that get arrested sometimes</p>
<p>I think so man</p>
<p>I think so and it was crazy</p>
<p>yeah it was that</p>
<p>guy yeah last</p>
<p>Comic Standing</p>
<p>was it on the</p>
<p>season with you no</p>
<p>no I&rsquo;m like the next one</p>
<p>he was on the next one</p>
<p>yeah you know Jay and I were on the</p>
<p>first TV show I ever did in 19 I</p>
<p>think it was 92</p>
<p>it was a Spotlight Cafe this</p>
<p>weird show in New York</p>
<p>and Jay was on it with me and</p>
<p>I always thought like wow this guy is so</p>
<p>quirky and interesting like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be a</p>
<p>famous comedian</p>
<p>then he got on Last Comic</p>
<p>Standing I&rsquo;m like wow here it goes</p>
<p>maybe people and you know</p>
<p>people start recognizing him at the comedy store yeah</p>
<p>and then nothing happened</p>
<p>and then it all stopped</p>
<p>it just went away you have done the best</p>
<p>of anybody of</p>
<p>capitalizing on that last</p>
<p>comic standing</p>
<p>crowd and running with it</p>
<p>you ran with</p>
<p>that shit dude there&rsquo;s a lot of guys who like</p>
<p>John Heffron ran with it pretty well too</p>
<p>but I think you ran with it even better</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still more prolific well</p>
<p>it highlighted you more than anyone</p>
<p>that you were the only person on that show that when I</p>
<p>watched you when it was originally on</p>
<p>I saw you blow up</p>
<p>audiences I mean you just destroyed on that show you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>like a regular Last Comic</p>
<p>Standing person you were tearing up rooms</p>
<p>jay Moore came to me and told me</p>
<p>and showed me the minutes</p>
<p>from an NBC meeting okay</p>
<p>like he probably shouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>and he told me that they were nervous</p>
<p>about having someone my size</p>
<p>on NBC a lot</p>
<p>especially in</p>
<p>prime time worried</p>
<p>about like you</p>
<p>dying or something no just the image it</p>
<p>would put out there they were embarrassed by my size oh</p>
<p>and what does that feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crushing</p>
<p>um but I use it as</p>
<p>motivation and he goes the only way they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to get you off of this</p>
<p>is if you get a</p>
<p>standing ovation every show</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way they can deny it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because we can&rsquo;t retake that tape</p>
<p>and and he goes we won&rsquo;t be able to if you</p>
<p>every joke kills we won&rsquo;t be able to show you bombing</p>
<p>what is he goes if if every joke of yours kills right</p>
<p>then we won&rsquo;t be able to show that you bombed</p>
<p>to tell you that you lost to</p>
<p>show the audience that you lost</p>
<p>so you have to get a</p>
<p>standing ovation every show</p>
<p>and every joke</p>
<p>be your hardest that you&rsquo;ve ever delivered it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>these people aren&rsquo;t gonna get you out of here whoa</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re plotting to get you out from the beginning</p>
<p>because the way you yeah your body is yeah wow</p>

<p>all right and I took out of my bag</p>
<p>3 and 1/2 ounces of weed</p>
<p>a full ounce of Keef</p>
<p>and about 20 grams of hash god</p>
<p>damn dude that&rsquo;s what I took out of my bag like</p>
<p>he took it out before he went to the airport you</p>

<p>the one thing I&rsquo;ve got for me</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a mess I mean I&rsquo;ve got no sense</p>
<p>plus I get tons of heavy handshakes</p>
<p>I mean and those these guys aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>throwing ounce at me they&rsquo;re throwing an 8th</p>
<p>to 1/4 you know</p>
<p>when I tell them how I was</p>
<p>stone and saw</p>
<p>the the miracle on the Hudson happen</p>
<p>just afterwards okay</p>
<p>we were down there at Chelsea Pierce</p>
<p>and people running I saw a fucking cop on a horse I am</p>
<p>stoned out of my fucking mind</p>
<p>I my act I sound stone like a biblical whore and I am</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>wasted and I&rsquo;m like walking seriously I&rsquo;m fucked</p>
<p>up like if it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like 29 degrees and</p>
<p>sunny I would have passed the fuck out</p>
<p>I was that high wow I had a big</p>
<p>thing a hash and I put that in the middle I made a Joey</p>
<p>Diaz Cuban sandwich</p>
<p>where the Ogs on the</p>
<p>sativa on the top and then a</p>
<p>big fucking chunk of hash about a over 1g and</p>
<p>an OG finish</p>
<p>okay yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it I was the one of the most fucked up I&rsquo;ve ever been</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m walking and in so much I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>seeing people run from the end of the pier to the edge</p>
<p>overhead helicopters I see a cop on a fucking horse</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>and he was within</p>
<p>20ft of me and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>where the fuck are you</p>
<p>going sundance</p>
<p>I mean it won&rsquo;t appear</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re on a fucking pier there&rsquo;s people all</p>
<p>around you know my kid has been my wife&rsquo;s arms you know</p>
<p>what the fuck wow okay</p>
<p>and we went down there to go see that I&rsquo;m a kind of</p>
<p>a aviation buff</p>
<p>and the AR was</p>
<p>the Blackbird spy</p>
<p>plane the AR</p>
<p>71 I think it was</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s the fastest</p>
<p>plane we ever</p>
<p>built you know that we told anyone about</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fucking cool as shit because</p>
<p>on its last</p>
<p>voyage it flew from New York to LA</p>
<p>or LA to New York</p>
<p>in like 38 minutes</p>
<p>something insane</p>
<p>speed I laid in New York in 38 minutes</p>
<p>time traveling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s how is that real</p>
<p>look it up AR</p>
<p>17 AR some AR</p>
<p>17 blackbird</p>
<p>SR SR 71 SR</p>
<p>71 just making</p>
<p>some numbers up no no no</p>
<p>SR 71 it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Blackbird spy plane 71</p>
<p>check that fucker out</p>
<p>and it was the it was the last</p>
<p>declassified</p>
<p>flight of it</p>
<p>it was the only one that they showed the speed</p>
<p>and and we retired this</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>why would you ever retire this</p>
<p>thing can you put it up there bro</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how to do all this shit</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re amazing</p>
<p>I got an iPad</p>
<p>where is your friends you play</p>
<p>dude this thing goes 2000</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>so then it couldn&rsquo;t have gone</p>
<p>it couldn&rsquo;t have been</p>
<p>this is what</p>
<p>they did in one hour</p>
<p>and 54 minutes</p>
<p>they went from New York to London</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a flight the 6 hour flight they did an hour and</p>
<p>54 months they went from the last</p>
<p>one the flu</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s at the</p>
<p>the battleship there</p>
<p>was it the intrepid</p>
<p>mm hmm okay</p>
<p>down on Chelsea Pierce</p>
<p>alright that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I wanted to go see I wanted to be high and be</p>
<p>close to that fucking</p>
<p>jet right I mean that&rsquo;s almost time</p>
<p>traveling I mean do you</p>
<p>understand dude</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s fucking mind blowing in</p>
<p>2 hours you can</p>
<p>leave London</p>
<p>you can have</p>
<p>tea in London and</p>
<p>lunch and dinner in New York City</p>
<p>and not miss a fucking beat bro</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>transporter shit</p>
<p>yeah okay that&rsquo;s amazing you know what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>crazy is they used to have that Concord that you</p>
<p>could fly to Europe</p>
<p>supersonic plane</p>
<p>and it used to go super high</p>
<p>it was like way higher than a regular plane so</p>
<p>literally like you were on the border of fucking space</p>
<p>yeah border of</p>
<p>space going to</p>
<p>the speed of</p>
<p>sound right</p>
<p>fucking a man</p>
<p>stop and think about a</p>
<p>plane that goes as fast as fucking</p>
<p>sound and you&rsquo;re sitting in that bitch</p>
<p>just fuck but yeah you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>the G force because they just they don&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sudden moves and they just slowly amp it up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking insane</p>
<p>insane it just goes</p>
<p>straight up and straight down</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the speed of</p>
<p>sound man the</p>
<p>speed of sound in a fucking plane</p>
<p>but it kept killing too many rich folks boy yeah right</p>
<p>the altitude</p>
<p>they fucked up and I</p>
<p>think the last one I think was</p>
<p>a really dumb fuck up to it&rsquo;s like someone hit a tire</p>
<p>that was left on the track like</p>
<p>the Concorde hit it and fucking</p>
<p>caused a gigantic explosion</p>
<p>and everybody died</p>
<p>yeah in the general</p>
<p>when those people are</p>
<p>dying they&rsquo;re dying</p>
<p>these are people that are paying like $10,000 a</p>
<p>ticket right</p>
<p>more than that</p>
<p>the more than that first</p>
<p>class first</p>
<p>class yeah yeah</p>
<p>right but so $10,000 feels like regular</p>
<p>right yeah for like economy</p>
<p>economy is $10,000</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just to save a few</p>
<p>hours of your time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the end of</p>
<p>the novelty</p>
<p>effect of it I remember I was</p>
<p>watching some talk show as a kid and there was an actor</p>
<p>who said the coolest</p>
<p>thing he&rsquo;d ever done was take that Concorde</p>
<p>yeah and then</p>
<p>stand on his seat so he was the highest person in the</p>
<p>world whoa that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s right it was</p>
<p>he stood on his</p>
<p>feet and he was</p>
<p>the highest</p>
<p>alive person no there was no astronauts in</p>
<p>orbit at that time</p>
<p>there was nothing</p>
<p>going on the</p>
<p>plane still</p>
<p>freaked me out just the idea that you&rsquo;re in this</p>
<p>metal tube it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>30 000 feet in the air and you&rsquo;re just sitting there</p>
<p>just chilling and looking at your iPad and you&rsquo;re and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like atoms are holding us up</p>
<p>your invisible eyes</p>
<p>disconnected from the ground that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where I want to be I want to be on the ground</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>you have no</p>
<p>fucking feet up there ooh</p>
<p>I get a lot of anxiety when I fly</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think they have that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about one of the</p>
<p>things you said</p>
<p>about the SR 71 you said it was the fastest plane</p>
<p>that we have that we know</p>
<p>about that we have a</p>
<p>total one about</p>
<p>yeah do you</p>
<p>think they have</p>
<p>some technology</p>
<p>well it would just seem to reason I mean</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be the logic that</p>
<p>if you made that much progress in 30 years</p>
<p>that exponentially if you take the same progress</p>
<p>like in cell</p>
<p>phones in the last 20 years</p>
<p>from a briefcase with a</p>
<p>cord and a headset</p>
<p>and then the move down was the brick</p>
<p>okay that was the</p>
<p>after that okay that same</p>
<p>technology now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re microscopic and they can</p>
<p>you know tons of data</p>
<p>I mean you just take that same</p>
<p>stream of technology</p>
<p>and apply that</p>
<p>to another sector</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spending billions and billions and billions of dollars</p>
<p>on projects that we don&rsquo;t even know about</p>
<p>fuck yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be something faster</p>
<p>I wanna know</p>
<p>about I wanna know about Harp</p>
<p>up in Alaska</p>
<p>I wanna know about</p>
<p>um the f f 23</p>
<p>that supposedly can hover and</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a scram jet</p>
<p>okay I want to know</p>
<p>about that that it</p>
<p>could fly at a hundred</p>
<p>20,000ft okay and that can go from</p>
<p>it can go from</p>
<p>last night while outside of Los Angeles Las Vegas</p>
<p>supposedly it fucking takes off and then it refuels</p>
<p>at about 90,000ft</p>
<p>no 45,000ft on its way to 90,000ft</p>
<p>and then it hits the after</p>
<p>so it means a</p>
<p>plane and refuels in the air</p>
<p>how dope is that</p>
<p>they refuel in the fucking sky yeah and</p>
<p>how the fuck are they doing that man I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>cleanest burning</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the fastest and people can go from</p>
<p>lots it&rsquo;ll be over the Pacific</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s nobody</p>
<p>they fucking they refuel</p>
<p>and then they hit that scramjet and they go to</p>
<p>120 140 000 feet</p>
<p>like the outer</p>
<p>atmosphere shit and then bounce back</p>
<p>off of it and</p>
<p>what you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>well if you go straight up</p>
<p>and you continue in a straight line</p>
<p>the Earth is moving at like 17 000</p>
<p>miles per hour</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s adding to your speed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>trippy when you add altitude to it</p>
<p>and then gravity on top of that</p>
<p>compounding so you&rsquo;re falling</p>
<p>much faster you know</p>
<p>it could go up to</p>
<p>theoretically</p>
<p>3 000 miles per hour 4 000</p>
<p>miles per hour</p>
<p>damn fucking amazing do you</p>
<p>guys remember how cool it was in the 80s I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that black bird</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>black bird it was like the F 15</p>
<p>or what was it was</p>
<p>like a wrap your head around that kind of fucking speed</p>
<p>no man it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>traveling man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the closest we&rsquo;re ever</p>
<p>gonna get I wonder if they have some shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not released that&rsquo;s even faster than what we know</p>
<p>about like 3 or 4 times the</p>
<p>speed of sound some really nutty</p>
<p>what about what</p>
<p>about that decommissioned</p>
<p>super Collider in Waxahahachy</p>
<p>Texas that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still a federal off</p>
<p>limits facility that</p>
<p>that say we did</p>
<p>say we created the</p>
<p>guide particle like they did in Switzerland</p>
<p>and which is a controlled</p>
<p>microscopic</p>
<p>subatomic black hole</p>
<p>and then the energy explodes out that we collect</p>
<p>that theoretically that in a</p>
<p>bottle any matter</p>
<p>we could we could</p>
<p>stream bang into each</p>
<p>other and control that black hole</p>
<p>that we could</p>
<p>in the left of my</p>
<p>water get boom from there we</p>
<p>could fuel all of</p>
<p>North america&rsquo;s energy sources</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that amazing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking unbelievable</p>
<p>the super colliding shit like that</p>
<p>right I mean it&rsquo;s fascinating but I mean I think</p>
<p>the idea behind</p>
<p>making the little</p>
<p>black holes that they don&rsquo;t have enough gravity to stay</p>
<p>alive yeah yeah they die out</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the well the</p>
<p>scary version so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking that</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s doing something with the one they have in</p>
<p>Texas is that what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>yeah that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>been decommissioned</p>
<p>yeah and that it&rsquo;s being used I mean</p>
<p>the fucking government uses</p>
<p>everything else</p>
<p>from the fifties</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna drop you know</p>
<p>800 billion in a fucking hole in wax</p>
<p>hatching and then just say</p>
<p>fuck it we&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t funding</p>
<p>thing though</p>
<p>you know a lot of times there&rsquo;s just not enough</p>
<p>money to run shit if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get a</p>
<p>direct result off of the</p>
<p>experiments</p>
<p>like what is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be profitable out of</p>
<p>these experiences what military are</p>
<p>applications it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come from this</p>
<p>experiment and if there&rsquo;s none</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real hard</p>
<p>to justify when the economy goes to shit they</p>
<p>close things like</p>
<p>down all the time</p>
<p>yeah yeah but I mean is it really</p>
<p>close though</p>
<p>so we think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing something</p>
<p>some crazy shit yes</p>
<p>maybe the whole area 51 is the most fascinating</p>
<p>thing to me that they had a</p>
<p>whole area that they denied even existed</p>
<p>yeah until I</p>
<p>think it was like in the late 90s they</p>
<p>tried to expand</p>
<p>the boundaries of it and they</p>
<p>they had to</p>
<p>claim more land</p>
<p>for to be restricted</p>
<p>and they had to</p>
<p>admit that it</p>
<p>exists in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>but for the</p>
<p>longest time there was just people waiting with guns</p>
<p>but too many dudes</p>
<p>found like this spot in the hills</p>
<p>where you could watch them</p>
<p>experiment with</p>
<p>their aircrafts</p>
<p>and too many guys who worked there</p>
<p>who either got</p>
<p>fired or went crazy</p>
<p>and like Bob Lazard</p>
<p>you know he is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the guy that you know he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>ridiculed a</p>
<p>lot of people say that he&rsquo;s full of shit and</p>
<p>he lied about his education</p>
<p>background I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s the case or what&rsquo;s not the case but his</p>
<p>story hey I</p>
<p>lied on the resume to get a job yeah</p>
<p>well you need to say he had degrees in</p>
<p>places they said he</p>
<p>never enrolled and there&rsquo;s like old yearbooks from</p>
<p>those times</p>
<p>and he does he&rsquo;s not in the yearbook so it seems like</p>
<p>at the very</p>
<p>least he&rsquo;s made some things up</p>
<p>so you know</p>
<p>you gotta look</p>
<p>at it and say well you probably made it all up but the</p>
<p>point is he</p>
<p>would take his friends to</p>
<p>watch these</p>
<p>things fly in the</p>
<p>air and he said he worked there they arrested him there</p>
<p>and once they arrested him there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know it was his big</p>
<p>story and he came out and said there was flying</p>
<p>saucers there and that he had worked on them</p>
<p>tried to back engineer him</p>
<p>right fucking fascinating shit</p>
<p>but the the</p>
<p>point the number one point is</p>
<p>there really is a place</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>secret shit and they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want people to know</p>
<p>about it and they had to tell people</p>
<p>exist in the 90s</p>
<p>once they had</p>
<p>satellites and</p>
<p>satellites started flying over and taking</p>
<p>photographs of it</p>
<p>and people could see like the</p>
<p>whole facility and</p>
<p>Groom Lake and you</p>
<p>could see all</p>
<p>these you know</p>
<p>these air hangers</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re doing some nutty shit out there man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like stealth</p>
<p>bombers and yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the shit on the surface yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>video technology</p>
<p>is badasses is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 30 fucking years old</p>
<p>I think a lot of what they&rsquo;re doing is drones man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fascinating oh</p>
<p>yeah man of</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>this is before they shut it down</p>
<p>these people were</p>
<p>watching like from</p>
<p>some park spot and they were filming</p>
<p>these things flying through the air</p>
<p>and like you know you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen anything</p>
<p>move like this and I&rsquo;m like well that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no people in it it&rsquo;s probably like</p>
<p>drone they&rsquo;re probably all drones</p>
<p>exactly like this but</p>
<p>small yeah exactly</p>
<p>maybe blackbirds yeah</p>
<p>well you know what I mean we know</p>
<p>that they have them now</p>
<p>we know that they have them</p>
<p>so if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they saw in 1996 and shit when people were filming</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>the answer to a lot of this UFO bullshit</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t believe in Ufos</p>
<p>I think that time travel</p>
<p>is a closer</p>
<p>thing than the distance</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re creating some kind of worm</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>aliens I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I think that they</p>
<p>exist I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;ve ever been here</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced that they have or</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t I could see it argued either way it</p>
<p>sounds totally preposterous</p>
<p>when you watch</p>
<p>those ancient</p>
<p>alien shows and you see that guy with the crazy hair</p>
<p>talking all</p>
<p>nonsense about you know how they believe that</p>
<p>you know aliens</p>
<p>taught all these</p>
<p>different people</p>
<p>all these different things but</p>
<p>you know look if</p>
<p>if we are people</p>
<p>and we have aspired to travel</p>
<p>and we supposedly have been to the moon</p>
<p>if we have that sort of</p>
<p>capability in our primitive</p>
<p>stage of development</p>
<p>what if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>culture 100,000 200,000</p>
<p>300,000 years</p>
<p>older than us that&rsquo;s nothing in that lip of</p>
<p>time that&rsquo;s nothing so a</p>
<p>culture that survives</p>
<p>by the meteor yeah a</p>
<p>culture that survives that&rsquo;s 2 or</p>
<p>3,000,000 years</p>
<p>older than us they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be so fucking far</p>
<p>ahead of us</p>
<p>that they would</p>
<p>literally be able to</p>
<p>bypass all the ideas or have come to a resolution</p>
<p>on all the ideas</p>
<p>about interrupting</p>
<p>life and genetically engineering new life</p>
<p>to them it would be like</p>
<p>yeah of course you do it this is what you do you just</p>
<p>make new shoes</p>
<p>yeah we go there and we</p>
<p>introduced our genetics into these</p>
<p>monkey genetics</p>
<p>and these monkeys have this crazy</p>
<p>thing happens</p>
<p>where their</p>
<p>brain doubles</p>
<p>over a period of 2,000,000 years and they become humans</p>
<p>did that happen I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking stories</p>
<p>all these different</p>
<p>stories from so many different religions</p>
<p>and so many different ancient texts all have to do</p>
<p>with some higher being coming from the sky</p>
<p>I mean what the fuck</p>
<p>a little bit though that people just want</p>
<p>to believe in something else maybe</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s possible I mean</p>
<p>humans I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an either or</p>
<p>you know saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not either or</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t assholes I mean</p>
<p>where if you&rsquo;re a survivor</p>
<p>at this point</p>
<p>that you come from a long line of assholes</p>
<p>you know we were the guys who</p>
<p>ate the last bit of food we were the ones that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t share during famine</p>
<p>you know and well</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that easy</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re saying but not</p>
<p>really you know all you have to do is get a</p>
<p>group of cool people together to</p>
<p>fight off the assholes and you survive</p>
<p>as well you don&rsquo;t have to be an asshole to survive</p>
<p>no you can be the cool</p>
<p>smart people that get together and</p>
<p>fight off the asshole yeah</p>
<p>so just because we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re the children of assholes</p>
<p>but it crazy out</p>
<p>every I mean like</p>
<p>every we&rsquo;re just barbaric</p>
<p>I mean well</p>
<p>you know from the fucking Mayans to the</p>
<p>everybody in Europe the different</p>
<p>clans you know they were just barbarians I mean just</p>
<p>the fucking Huns that you know we like one and</p>
<p>what is it 6 people have the same DNA as Genghis Khan</p>
<p>or some shit like that</p>
<p>how badass everybody is Kong</p>
<p>he comes out of the steps of Mongolia and fucking</p>
<p>sweeps in and takes almost the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>and that fucking amazing I mean</p>
<p>grass he was a lobster</p>
<p>he was fucking gangster</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>be awesome to be able to get real documentary footage</p>
<p>like the coolest</p>
<p>fucking thing</p>
<p>would be you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>travel through time but what you can do is go back in</p>
<p>time and watch it and record it</p>
<p>well you know if you imagine if you</p>
<p>found a way to extract it from trees like</p>
<p>visuals yeah</p>
<p>this is a thousand year old tree let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s seen</p>
<p>right well technically</p>
<p>you know since we&rsquo;re just reflecting</p>
<p>light and that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>we are okay and</p>
<p>light travel set</p>
<p>which is reflecting lame</p>
<p>this is the ultimate</p>
<p>stoner talk</p>
<p>right here I know right</p>
<p>we all just</p>
<p>reflected why were you in</p>
<p>Guam by the way</p>
<p>I was there</p>
<p>to do a bunch of shows</p>
<p>I was there to do a</p>
<p>bunch of shows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s been bothered for 20</p>
<p>minutes I&rsquo;m sick</p>
<p>fuck man I forgot that we were talking</p>
<p>about that yeah</p>
<p>me too I was just talking about this</p>
<p>I love this</p>
<p>this shit man</p>
<p>getting high</p>
<p>and fucking talking about</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about hold on let me finish the</p>
<p>point and then I fucking</p>
<p>tell you my</p>
<p>foes dude okay</p>
<p>check it out</p>
<p>that if you</p>
<p>could go faster than the</p>
<p>speed of light</p>
<p>to the time</p>
<p>and then with a</p>
<p>powerful enough</p>
<p>telescope pointed at us to catch the light reflected</p>
<p>okay you could use</p>
<p>just as satellite technology looks down on the Earth</p>
<p>you could see the reflection of the Earth</p>
<p>from that time</p>
<p>and visually prove everything you wanted to</p>
<p>well what if you went faster out into</p>
<p>space okay you go faster on the space and then you have</p>
<p>a telescope you have a telescope</p>
<p>that could look back and capture the</p>
<p>light that&rsquo;s coming off the Earth the</p>
<p>light that&rsquo;s coming from the Earth as you go away</p>
<p>yeah you would</p>
<p>theoretically be looking at</p>
<p>Earth at that point right the reflection of the light</p>
<p>so you could see you would be looking at</p>
<p>Earth at that point in time yeah so at the</p>
<p>speed of light I see what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>earth&rsquo;s history would come at you</p>
<p>I mean if you could visually swatch it sort of</p>
<p>but you would be a thousand years in the future looking</p>
<p>a thousand years in the past so you&rsquo;d really more</p>
<p>than a thousand</p>
<p>same moment</p>
<p>theoretically it</p>
<p>would still</p>
<p>freeze it would</p>
<p>still be the</p>
<p>exact same distance between</p>
<p>Earth and you at all</p>
<p>points it was</p>
<p>the same right but that that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>that light that light</p>
<p>is reflects off of it so you can</p>
<p>catch an image</p>
<p>of what it might not be a perfect image</p>
<p>right so as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going say if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going 1,000,000</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as it&rsquo;s 1,000,000</p>
<p>miles away yeah</p>
<p>no no no the</p>
<p>light from a</p>
<p>thousand years ago I know what you&rsquo;re saying as</p>
<p>you move the idea behind</p>
<p>it is if you move into the future faster than the</p>
<p>speed of light what happens back here</p>
<p>moves at a much much much faster pace</p>
<p>right no yeah what I&rsquo;m saying is is that the</p>
<p>light that bounces off the</p>
<p>Earth right</p>
<p>okay has an</p>
<p>image and that</p>
<p>image is the same</p>
<p>traveling off the</p>
<p>Earth at the</p>
<p>speed of light</p>
<p>if you go out into space</p>
<p>faster than the speed of</p>
<p>light okay so you can look</p>
<p>back before</p>
<p>it yeah yeah you</p>
<p>could look back at the</p>
<p>image of the</p>
<p>Earth with a</p>
<p>powerful enough telescope</p>
<p>all right and see</p>
<p>the history of Earth</p>
<p>come forward</p>
<p>whoa okay so you&rsquo;re saying that if you go</p>
<p>say if you go forward like</p>
<p>some fucking insane</p>
<p>like if you went faster than</p>
<p>light Alpha Centauri</p>
<p>look back and</p>
<p>see the Earth if we have the kind of</p>
<p>technology that will allow you</p>
<p>to even though you&rsquo;re billions of</p>
<p>light years away or however far</p>
<p>away you are</p>
<p>look back and see the</p>
<p>Earth and get</p>
<p>close to the actually to the ground</p>
<p>so you can even from</p>
<p>100 million</p>
<p>light years away</p>
<p>you still have full</p>
<p>view of the</p>
<p>Earth it wouldn&rsquo;t be full</p>
<p>it would be obscured there</p>
<p>would be you know there&rsquo;s dark patches and only the</p>
<p>light that bounces off is the</p>
<p>sunny side so you</p>
<p>could see the</p>
<p>sunny side of the Earth yes</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>catch anybody because people do fucked up shit at night</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be doing</p>
<p>almost all the real fucked up shit happens</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t get nothing you have no</p>
<p>proof on me you</p>
<p>can see wars</p>
<p>you can see you saw a</p>
<p>shadow in the window bitch you don&rsquo;t know nothing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fuck you I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m not going for court</p>
<p>alright I&rsquo;m just saying I see what you&rsquo;re saying though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trippy</p>
<p>total stoner thought right there out</p>
<p>it should be talk well the idea of time itself is very</p>
<p>trippy and especially because it&rsquo;s limited</p>
<p>you know so true limited we are our physical</p>
<p>bodies find it</p>
<p>limited but when you get past our physical</p>
<p>bodies and all other physical</p>
<p>bodies time is just sort of fly it&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>yeah just one</p>
<p>big gigantic moment</p>
<p>yes we don&rsquo;t last</p>
<p>yeah time&rsquo;s only important to us that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>mind fuck that&rsquo;s that is exactly it</p>
<p>the real mind fuck is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dying</p>
<p>as soon as you&rsquo;re born you&rsquo;re dying</p>
<p>well I do it I</p>
<p>watched a fucking god get killed by a bear</p>
<p>today somebody put it up</p>
<p>on a broken</p>
<p>board it was a fucking</p>
<p>Sarah Palin</p>
<p>it was a trained bear</p>
<p>and the trained bear had been in</p>
<p>movies before man and the fucking guy was a gentleman</p>
<p>they had this bear</p>
<p>in this pen and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>training it and doing things with</p>
<p>it he just turns on this guy</p>
<p>out of nowhere and rips his throat apart</p>
<p>and just tears at it and shakes him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I never want to go up into</p>
<p>space and look at the future</p>
<p>in the past 10 000</p>
<p>years I want fucking bears up there I know</p>
<p>I was watching that Sarah Palin just the</p>
<p>promos for that shit undiscover or whatever it is</p>
<p>and that bitch is fishing next to grizzly bears</p>
<p>and I just want the grizzly bear to go fuck you I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>union I got</p>
<p>union during the Grizzly Man movie</p>
<p>all right it&rsquo;s your ass</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming and just attack the fucking boat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very frightening they&rsquo;re very fucking they are</p>
<p>powerful animals man</p>
<p>they can rip a</p>
<p>horse&rsquo;s fucking head off with his</p>
<p>paw I&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it too much over the past few weeks and I talked</p>
<p>about it yesterday on the Tom</p>
<p>Green Podcast but there&rsquo;s a video you</p>
<p>should see folks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bear eating a</p>
<p>moose alive</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s on the Internet you</p>
<p>wanna know how</p>
<p>ruthless fucking nature is man they&rsquo;re fucking brutal</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even kill you man they just</p>
<p>start eating yeah they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get down</p>
<p>and eat you</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still flying oh</p>
<p>Jack yeah kill me first this</p>
<p>video though the</p>
<p>crazy thing is this is a</p>
<p>trained bear this guy had raised</p>
<p>this bear and</p>
<p>trained it and his his</p>
<p>I believe it was his cousin was in the rink</p>
<p>with it you know as they were</p>
<p>working with the bear and the bear just for whatever</p>
<p>reason just decided to attack him out of nowhere</p>
<p>unprovoked just good</p>
<p>fucked him up man good</p>
<p>you think so really yes</p>
<p>why are you fucking with a bear</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bear</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking go</p>
<p>let it fucking</p>
<p>let it just</p>
<p>chill somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do like if you</p>
<p>have a movie</p>
<p>where you have a guy</p>
<p>wrestle a bear</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s got to</p>
<p>train that fucking bear we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a movie CJ</p>
<p>yeah you know what you</p>
<p>never see that</p>
<p>movie Congo</p>
<p>yes yeah when they had</p>
<p>those big crazy</p>
<p>monkeys that were so obviously men with</p>

<p>the lowest place on Earth</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re protected by it yeah</p>
<p>protected by the lowest spot on Earth</p>
<p>the immense cavern</p>
<p>takes out a lot of the energy from the tsunami</p>
<p>how deep the</p>
<p>water gets really yeah so they are protected by a reef</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>protected by the Marianas so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve never been jacked by a tsunami</p>
<p>no they come but they don&rsquo;t get the full width and</p>
<p>breadth of it</p>
<p>a lot of the energy is lost in the Canyon</p>
<p>is that trench</p>
<p>where they recorded that insane</p>
<p>biological sound I know</p>
<p>they call it the Bloop</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one crazy sound that</p>
<p>they recorded that so many times louder than anything</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d ever recorded that was biological</p>
<p>under the water and they know it&rsquo;s biological</p>

<p>well like it&rsquo;d be just a goat joy&rsquo;s fighting</p>
<p>yeah he enjoys it and he&rsquo;s fucking good at it</p>
<p>he likes it it&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s supposed to be doing</p>
<p>yeah you know there&rsquo;s a broad spectrum of human beings</p>
<p>yeah man I totally agree</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s supposed to be doing their</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>sometimes people find their</p>
<p>thing and it matches up with</p>
<p>their personality and sometimes they just fight</p>
<p>it imagine if he didn&rsquo;t get into it</p>
<p>can you imagine if he just didn&rsquo;t get into</p>
<p>fighting and instead</p>
<p>he was like ah I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna work at Toys R Us</p>
<p>and like you&rsquo;re just like man oh</p>

<p>Eddie Bravo</p>
<p>late at night</p>
<p>why have you seen him drunk</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen him drunk</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not worth</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the idea that</p>
<p>he kills you anytime he wants yes that is very</p>
<p>scary and the fact that there is nothing I</p>
<p>could do but you know</p>
<p>and then he tells guys that are like</p>
<p>double the size</p>
<p>how he&rsquo;d choke him out from underneath</p>
<p>okay and I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>I never even</p>
<p>heard that I didn&rsquo;t know what that was</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s laughing about it</p>
<p>oh yeah I do I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>climb up him</p>
<p>okay and then like fucking leg lock him and</p>
<p>choke him out and shit like this and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so weird because I don&rsquo;t get that from</p>
<p>Eddie Brow as</p>
<p>as I do with Mayhem like with Mayhem I I feel</p>
<p>oh yeah but what about</p>
<p>Eddie he&rsquo;s always just so</p>
<p>happy and nice</p>
<p>and everything you</p>
<p>think about him</p>
<p>is not competing yeah</p>
<p>you know the difference</p>
<p>is the guys that are competing guys are like actively</p>
<p>fighting in MMA</p>
<p>they all are super</p>
<p>they have to always</p>
<p>be ready to</p>
<p>train and to</p>
<p>spar and they&rsquo;re always thinking</p>
<p>about competition they&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>training hard</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always ramped up you know</p>
<p>and most of them are really calm</p>
<p>like mayhem&rsquo;s is about as</p>
<p>exaggerated</p>
<p>of personalities exactly but that&rsquo;s just who he is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always been like that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known that dude forever well you have too yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always been like that</p>
<p>but just the fact that they&rsquo;re in competition mode</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>some primal shit you&rsquo;re at 9 all the time you know</p>
<p>your senses are heightened you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>training for combat man that&rsquo;s like some serious shit</p>
<p>can you imagine that jeer</p>
<p>every day like from</p>
<p>like from like the</p>
<p>Spartans how they you know they get</p>
<p>their kids kidnapped and</p>
<p>taken and beaten</p>
<p>and fucking</p>
<p>toughened up and</p>
<p>toughened up you know and then</p>
<p>they escape at 18 and they go</p>
<p>rape and steal</p>
<p>a girl out at</p>
<p>night you know</p>
<p>Sparta was fucking</p>
<p>I mean these guys they were warriors it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy when you think</p>
<p>about what pussies we are today</p>
<p>and that people had to be like that at one</p>
<p>point in time for us to get till</p>
<p>today they had to be</p>
<p>strong they had to be able to</p>
<p>fight off fucking animals and</p>
<p>hordes of invading</p>
<p>tribes you had to be</p>
<p>strong to stay</p>
<p>alive just a few thousand years ago</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy a</p>
<p>few thousand</p>
<p>150 yeah 150 fucking year 2 lifetimes</p>
<p>do the Wild West that was the 1800s</p>
<p>yeah man yeah</p>
<p>1865 was the abolition of slavery</p>
<p>right was it 1875 or 1865 65</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got you know fucking cowboys</p>
<p>and Indians</p>

<p>patching knife</p>
<p>fighters oh</p>
<p>those guys are nasty</p>
<p>did you see the</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>Obama got in</p>
<p>trouble because he</p>
<p>was talking</p>
<p>about Sitting Bull</p>
<p>and recognizing the Sitting Bull was a hero</p>
<p>and you know that you know</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>I guess it was a part of some book that he has has some</p>
<p>child book and</p>
<p>people are going</p>
<p>hey Sitting Bull like killed like a lot of fucking</p>
<p>Americans yeah</p>
<p>it did it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re acknowledging now that we&rsquo;ve integrated</p>
<p>the American Indian into the</p>
<p>whole American</p>
<p>culture like they&rsquo;re a part of us</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re sort of acknowledging</p>
<p>that the original Americans just fuck them</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>this guy fought back and this guy&rsquo;s a hero for fighting</p>
<p>essentially us</p>
<p>well you know it&rsquo;s mind boggling</p>
<p>when you say you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the land of the free</p>
<p>because of an act of terrorist</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s a Willie Nelson he&rsquo;s in fucking</p>
<p>gonna be in jail I know man that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>my dick yeah</p>
<p>but you know we say</p>
<p>that you know we</p>
<p>we you know we spout</p>
<p>all this patriotism and stuff</p>
<p>and and if you go to the Boston Tea Party</p>
<p>which is fucking</p>
<p>which is dum dums</p>
<p>republicans</p>
<p>that are mad that we have a</p>
<p>black guy or saying you know we&rsquo;re tea</p>
<p>party is okay yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>talking about a terrorist act</p>
<p>that was a terrorist act it was not an act of war</p>
<p>you know that right</p>
<p>we call it rebellion</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re on this fucking side of it</p>
<p>but it was a fucking</p>
<p>basically a terrorist act</p>
<p>if what we what what</p>
<p>is if white guys</p>
<p>today dressed up</p>
<p>as as Arabs</p>
<p>okay and attacked a private company</p>
<p>and destroyed property</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d call it a terrorist act</p>
<p>okay all right and that&rsquo;s exactly what we did</p>
<p>right okay it&rsquo;s a terrorist</p>
<p>act yeah I know what you yeah</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we bore our nation</p>
<p>and the same</p>
<p>thing that you</p>
<p>know we accuse Afghanistan of being terrorist</p>
<p>because they want to kill us</p>
<p>or they killed this many and they don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>under our fucking rule</p>
<p>how dare we be an empire</p>
<p>like the fucking British were to us</p>

<p>think they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>underestimate Cuckoo</p>
<p>you gotta be pretty</p>
<p>crazy to want to be</p>
<p>some sort of a leader like that a leader of a country</p>
<p>leader of a cult leader of anything</p>
<p>to be that arrogant that you</p>
<p>should be the main person</p>
<p>it means really just playing up on a flaw</p>
<p>in human nature</p>
<p>the flaw is the necessity of the alpha</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re always looking to the one person that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be led by</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how all</p>
<p>tribes of animals deal with</p>
<p>it tribes of</p>
<p>wolves do it</p>
<p>tribes of monkeys do it and tribes of</p>
<p>humans do it</p>
<p>we need one person even that one person isn&rsquo;t qualified</p>
<p>as long as there&rsquo;s one person in that position</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>know the Socio Palin</p>
<p>thing is possible</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to be qualified</p>
<p>you just have to be in the position</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>guy isn&rsquo;t qualified to be the president of</p>
<p>North Korea</p>
<p>you tell me</p>
<p>other North Korean people</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t said listen I&rsquo;m a lot more reasonable</p>
<p>I could get shit done with</p>
<p>other countries yeah we</p>
<p>could have better eat</p>
<p>more food or</p>
<p>anything like that is there cabbage in</p>
<p>every pot in the ground</p>
<p>chicken in every</p>
<p>pot yeah right</p>
<p>yeah you got to be a</p>
<p>You got to be a really</p>
<p>twisted motherfucker to want to run</p>
<p>things they&rsquo;ve got fucking rockets that hit</p>
<p>off the shore of Hawaii</p>

<p>the fact there&rsquo;s over 1,000,000 infantry of North Korea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people do there they don&rsquo;t make anything</p>
<p>everybody is fucking in the army it&rsquo;s true all</p>
<p>right if they wanted to walk over</p>
<p>South Korea there&rsquo;s nothing we could do</p>
<p>with 28,500</p>
<p>US troops right there</p>
<p>except for battlefield nukes</p>
<p>just prevent it do you understand</p>
<p>the complete wipe out and within hours</p>

<p>all of it be gone</p>
<p>we all love it bedazzled really how much</p>
<p>how many troops does</p>
<p>the United States have there</p>
<p>28,500 I think that&rsquo;s plenty</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not with the shit we got son well</p>

<p>crazy just our</p>
<p>share numbers you couldn&rsquo;t stop that the real crazy</p>
<p>thing is China</p>
<p>I mean if you really wanted to have a country</p>
<p>if we are in one</p>
<p>sort of situation like we used to have</p>
<p>like with the United States</p>
<p>versus Russia</p>
<p>when I was a kid</p>
<p>it was always everyone was</p>
<p>worried that Russia was</p>
<p>going to do wolverines</p>
<p>the United States yeah</p>
<p>yeah wolverines</p>
<p>reddogs those</p>
<p>motherfuckers yeah</p>
<p>everybody was concerned that</p>
<p>we were going to eventually get involved</p>
<p>in some sort of a nuclear exchange and you always</p>
<p>heard oh we almost came to a nuclear exchange</p>
<p>a mistake and we got out of it and luckily</p>
<p>cooler heads prevail</p>
<p>shall we play</p>
<p>again yeah and</p>
<p>would you like to play a game</p>
<p>and um shit</p>
<p>that was just I mean</p>
<p>that was just a little</p>
<p>while ago man we kind of forgot what that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>but China is in the position to be that</p>
<p>again yeah yeah</p>
<p>they are ruthless people they are ruthless</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ruthless and there&rsquo;s so many of them they</p>
<p>look if you</p>
<p>watch like some of the HBO</p>
<p>special before</p>
<p>I think on some of the shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going down in</p>
<p>China right now</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s really popular what&rsquo;s happening a lot</p>
<p>people selling</p>
<p>their kids yeah</p>
<p>people are having</p>
<p>their kids and selling them and they&rsquo;re like 5 and 6</p>
<p>years old corporation</p>
<p>so hot right now</p>
<p>selling this corporation terrifying man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole show on it</p>
<p>where this brother</p>
<p>you know his</p>
<p>brother was 5 and his brother was kidnapped and they</p>
<p>kidnapped his brother instead of him because he was</p>
<p>8 and he would have</p>
<p>known how to get home</p>
<p>so they kidnapped this fucking 5 year</p>
<p>old and took him away and he sold it his father sold it</p>
<p>and his father&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about it he had to sell one of his sons</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t want to but</p>
<p>he had to do it so he went with the younger one because</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know any better and he</p>
<p>could trick him</p>
<p>something along</p>
<p>those lines but</p>
<p>you know he was talking</p>
<p>about how the</p>
<p>he was really</p>
<p>upset that the the</p>
<p>the older boy was was</p>
<p>still mad at him</p>
<p>about it yeah but</p>
<p>these kids are probably the kids that are smoking</p>
<p>cigarettes where you see on like the YouTube</p>
<p>videos and stuff like</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s a dick I</p>
<p>would sell them for 5</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s you I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>smoking all my</p>
<p>cigarettes at all</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just a little boy man the little boy whose</p>
<p>brother was left behind</p>
<p>it was really really</p>
<p>heartbreaking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s horrible he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about missing his brother</p>
<p>and how his brother is</p>
<p>so mad at his father that</p>
<p>his father sold his brother I was like you</p>
<p>gotta be fucking shitting me man</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>time he&rsquo;s wearing</p>
<p>him to corporations he&rsquo;s wearing</p>
<p>dirty clothes</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s in this fucking</p>
<p>shack you know this little shack</p>
<p>with his dad</p>
<p>and his dad was trying to explain how he needed the</p>
<p>money and the only way it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the only way to</p>
<p>citizenship</p>
<p>basically like in</p>
<p>Roman times</p>
<p>is to be in the army</p>
<p>know to go from poverty to</p>
<p>Grace and stuff</p>
<p>is they have intellect</p>
<p>okay to show</p>
<p>you know an aptitude</p>
<p>for military service</p>
<p>or science or math or</p>
<p>you know athletics</p>
<p>or you go to the fucking</p>
<p>drones in in</p>

<p>big is your military</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only a number</p>
<p>I know you got one in your head come on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposedly the 3rd largest overall</p>
<p>3rd largest when you</p>
<p>when you incorporate its</p>
<p>power strength my own</p>
<p>power rating is number 3</p>
<p>but on sheer numbers</p>
<p>if they wanted to because they have like the National</p>
<p>guard there where people are</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t in certain areas they&rsquo;re like the National</p>
<p>guard even though they</p>
<p>might work at a factory also</p>
<p>if you enlist</p>
<p>this militia</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the largest army in the</p>
<p>world real number</p>
<p>yeah by number wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>way by number and then</p>
<p>but by power it&rsquo;s</p>

<p>you just do</p>
<p>that yourself though it&rsquo;s text messaging</p>
<p>like 8 000 people</p>
<p>at once or how many of her followers you are so that</p>
<p>you can cinch</p>
<p>it out that&rsquo;s amazing yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>power it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because you have</p>
<p>the combined knowledge</p>
<p>of 8 000 possibly</p>
<p>if they were all online at the same time</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s one question so you have the</p>
<p>population you</p>
<p>definitely get good answers</p>
<p>to a lot of shit</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re an interesting person and you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>things that you know</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>things about science and</p>
<p>space and i know you are</p>
<p>when you tweet</p>
<p>those if you find something online and you find some</p>
<p>story like whoa</p>
<p>check this shit out you know they just invented bam</p>
<p>and you put</p>
<p>that link up</p>
<p>you put that link up</p>
<p>a bunch of dudes will retweet that link</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start sending you shit hey</p>
<p>ralphie i know you&rsquo;re into this</p>
<p>space shit check this out they</p>
<p>discovered this doom</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in my</p>
<p>heart heard</p>
<p>about heart</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s fucking amazing what have you</p>
<p>heard with her</p>
<p>that we are</p>
<p>that we are we are</p>
<p>secretly having a war</p>
<p>we are attacking pakistan</p>
<p>china india</p>
<p>um bangladesh</p>
<p>in indonesia that</p>
<p>whole area a region</p>
<p>through bending the ionosphere</p>
<p>with massive</p>
<p>radio waves so what are we</p>
<p>doing alaska</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re causing flooding</p>
<p>like like beyond</p>
<p>all time it&rsquo;s ever been recorded</p>
<p>concentration of</p>
<p>earthquakes</p>
<p>that we were leaving the pressure that we&rsquo;re moving the</p>
<p>ionosphere wait a minute</p>
<p>where are you getting all this</p>
<p>are you sure yeah</p>
<p>yeah this is</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>but i mean that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying i mean are you sure</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re saying i know that but i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>that the floods this year were the</p>
<p>greatest of all time that they have</p>
<p>according to usgs they have a higher</p>
<p>rate of we&rsquo;re in a very high</p>
<p>earthquake for</p>
<p>asia central asia</p>
<p>and south asia</p>
<p>of all time</p>
<p>okay yeah but</p>
<p>ralphie that easily</p>
<p>could be because the</p>
<p>cycles of the earth</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean shit</p>
<p>that we have only</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve studied</p>
<p>as far as like</p>
<p>earthquakes and</p>
<p>floods and you</p>
<p>know the history of</p>
<p>weather and disasters</p>
<p>this is we&rsquo;re dealing with a tiny fraction</p>
<p>of the time that the</p>
<p>earth has existed</p>
<p>our data is so small</p>
<p>so when you say something like you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>record earthquakes or</p>
<p>record floods</p>
<p>the record is like you just woke up</p>
<p>and the phone rang and you&rsquo;re like this</p>
<p>phone has rang a record number of times today</p>
<p>cause it only rang once</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve only been</p>
<p>awake for five minutes</p>
<p>our knowledge of the</p>
<p>earth is so fucking</p>
<p>minuscule that</p>
<p>anytime people get</p>
<p>crazy and start saying</p>
<p>things like oh there&rsquo;s a record number of</p>
<p>earthquakes</p>
<p>it must be because</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s attacking pakistan with a</p>
<p>lightning bolt that goes into the sky</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>the fact that</p>
<p>sounds sexy as fuck that</p>
<p>sounds sexy as fuck that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>would that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s that simple</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that simple i think</p>
<p>who knows what it&rsquo;s a research project it&rsquo;s a high</p>
<p>frequency active auroral research program</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing they</p>
<p>could be doing a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>things they</p>
<p>could be trying to charge up the</p>
<p>ions but the idea that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>somehow they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shooting something into</p>
<p>space and attacking pakistan dude</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s bullshitting you</p>
<p>because that is not what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>okay there&rsquo;s just no evidence</p>
<p>that points to that at all</p>
<p>no no there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these there</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t people that want</p>
<p>everything to be sexy</p>
<p>they want everything to be sexy they want</p>
<p>everything to be the government&rsquo;s attacking us from</p>
<p>space they want</p>
<p>everything to be</p>
<p>conspiracy and the problem with that kind of</p>
<p>thinking is</p>
<p>it fucks up the ones that are real conspiracy</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of them</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s a real because it&rsquo;s a real place</p>
<p>and harp is</p>
<p>deaf they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>definitely doing real research</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what that is and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you do either and i</p>
<p>think until</p>
<p>we do know yeah</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really say that you can&rsquo;t just go and</p>
<p>say they&rsquo;re attacking pakistan with shit from the sky</p>
<p>no but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the latest theory</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry but by who alex jones is</p>
<p>half retarded</p>
<p>illegitimate</p>
<p>brother who</p>
<p>i like jesse ventura but there&rsquo;s a lot of conspiracy</p>
<p>i was a navy seal you should listen to me</p>
<p>that was there in the shit</p>
<p>i ain&rsquo;t got time</p>
<p>yeah i listen to him too</p>
<p>and i think he&rsquo;s another guy that&rsquo;s looking for</p>
<p>things to be sexy</p>
<p>he wants conspiracies</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s plenty of goddamn conspiracies that are real</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>start looking for them and</p>
<p>everything and saying that you know</p>
<p>you no no no</p>
<p>squirrely man no i just know that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking with the</p>
<p>ionosphere and the bombarding</p>
<p>it sure but i don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing or</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>you know could be some sort of weather</p>
<p>experimentation</p>
<p>could be some sort of</p>
<p>experimentation as far as like</p>
<p>recharging the magnetosphere or</p>
<p>changing things or keeping the poles</p>
<p>straight yeah who the</p>
<p>fuck knows what they&rsquo;re doing i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a goddamn clue</p>
<p>i know that&rsquo;s why i really want to know more</p>
<p>about it there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a crazy one was</p>
<p>operation starfish prime</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what was</p>
<p>called they shot a nuke up into</p>
<p>space and blew it up yeah they</p>
<p>exploded a new way more fucking dangerous they did</p>
<p>in the 50s the russians did it well the americans did</p>
<p>we did it first</p>
<p>we blew it up in</p>
<p>inside the van allen radiation belts like they were</p>
<p>gonna try to</p>
<p>punch a hole through the</p>
<p>van allen radiation belt and they</p>
<p>fucked everything up</p>
<p>man made it like way more</p>
<p>radioactive the whole</p>
<p>thing is a disaster up there</p>
<p>be like that for like a billion years and shit yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking done yeah</p>
<p>but it fucked out it stopped power in</p>
<p>new zealand</p>
<p>to australia to</p>
<p>los angeles</p>
<p>the impulse</p>
<p>was so much more magnified because</p>
<p>where it was it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>trippy when</p>
<p>you go back in time and look at how many different</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>human beings did</p>
<p>where they just took a chance</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>what happens when we just blow up a nuclear bomb in</p>
<p>space let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>shoot it up there</p>
<p>and blow it up</p>
<p>and they all sat around thought</p>
<p>about it and go can we do that yeah you do that</p>
<p>john wayne made a</p>
<p>movie called</p>
<p>genghis khan</p>
<p>in the crater</p>
<p>of a fucking nuke</p>
<p>we we a surface detonated</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>eight years</p>
<p>later they made a film in the</p>
<p>crater really</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why everybody on that fucking</p>
<p>movie died of cancer i did</p>
<p>hear that he had done some</p>
<p>movie and they filmed it somewhere</p>
<p>here they&rsquo;re doing nuclear</p>
<p>experiments</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t know they filmed it in the</p>
<p>crate in the fucking</p>
<p>crater dude</p>
<p>you can see</p>
<p>black google</p>
<p>ralphie may requires a lot of google</p>
<p>from you i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>okay so it&rsquo;s john wayne john wayne by all genghis khan</p>
<p>how you spell it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>multiple spellings but i think it&rsquo;s g e n g h i s g</p>
<p>h i s then con k h a n</p>
<p>that was the role</p>
<p>that he played i don&rsquo;t know if it was the name of the</p>
<p>movie but everybody on that fucking</p>
<p>thing from the set directors to catering died of cancer</p>
<p>wow did dingus kong nuke john wayne</p>
<p>right away man</p>
<p>right away stories</p>
<p>about it creepy fucking right wow</p>
<p>he was also a</p>
<p>you know two pack a day smokers insiv</p>
<p>above ground nuclear weapons testing</p>
<p>occurred at the test site</p>
<p>as part of operation upshot not whole</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the pictures come from</p>
<p>used to do shit back there</p>
<p>but nineteen eighty one ninety</p>
<p>one of them had developed some sort form of cancer</p>
<p>and forty six had died of the cancer holy shit</p>
<p>almost every</p>
<p>one hundred and</p>
<p>twenty people in the entire cast and crew</p>
<p>almost half of them</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>just continuous yeah</p>
<p>you know exposure</p>
<p>yeah over multiple</p>
<p>weeks but they filmed really fast back then</p>
<p>so it wasn&rsquo;t even like it was nowadays you know</p>
<p>wonder how long they were there for</p>
<p>yeah but what if they just all</p>
<p>ate red m and</p>
<p>m&rsquo;s or something like that you know</p>
<p>what if it was</p>
<p>something else</p>
<p>nothing to do with the fact they were in a very</p>
<p>clear crater yeah</p>
<p>in a crater</p>
<p>blown up by a atomic bomb</p>
<p>i have life five thousand years and you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>chilling there</p>
<p>filming take tow</p>
<p>but i wouldn&rsquo;t feel on</p>
<p>that one can we get another take on that one yes pissed</p>
<p>would you be</p>
<p>how pissed would you be if</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the actors don&rsquo;t know you</p>
<p>think john wayne knew</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>nobody knew</p>
<p>the producers didn&rsquo;t know either that&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>no one knew well they got</p>
<p>cheap shooting</p>
<p>they fucking</p>
<p>knew that long ago man that&rsquo;s like the nineteen fucking</p>
<p>sixties and shit yeah it was in the sixties right</p>
<p>not to people with</p>
<p>shit just then</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>fifty years ago man</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know shit</p>

<p>right to get</p>
<p>on yeah that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>it just it only needs to be out for a couple weeks</p>
<p>what could happen in</p>
<p>the fucking horrors katrina</p>
<p>katrina that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrible man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve watched</p>
<p>documentaries on that shit it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s horrific</p>
<p>what that city went through</p>
<p>civilization just shut down</p>
<p>shut the fuck down and it only took a matter of days</p>
<p>tell you what you take</p>
<p>fresh water</p>
<p>and electricity away from people</p>
<p>and they go fucking cuckoo</p>
<p>for cocoa puffs it is amazing when they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to survive</p>
<p>well yeah nobody does and</p>
<p>they go animal and it&rsquo;s hot as fuck there fuck yeah</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re not supposed to be there the</p>
<p>whole city&rsquo;s not supposed to be there yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not supposed to be</p>
<p>underwater like that that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>crazy thing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>below sea level</p>
<p>yeah so you have walls up to keep the</p>
<p>ocean out holy shit and this</p>
<p>is where you back</p>
<p>the mississippi you sleep</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome but why is it awesome it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome because there&rsquo;s people that are awesome why</p>
<p>not move the awesome people let&rsquo;s all make an agreement</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s all move our awesomeness</p>
<p>you know what they want to do to higher ground if they</p>
<p>if they hadn&rsquo;t had this recession they were talking</p>
<p>about the largest</p>
<p>public&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>thing ever they were</p>
<p>going to detour the</p>
<p>mississippi</p>
<p>to read around</p>
<p>the city of new orleans</p>
<p>to make a delta</p>
<p>to protect it</p>
<p>all right and they were</p>
<p>going to reroute the</p>
<p>mississippi</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what they the</p>
<p>the core of engineers</p>
<p>had slated as the largest public works</p>
<p>larger than the hoover dam</p>
<p>exponentially larger</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>an incredible</p>
<p>waste of money</p>
<p>but they were</p>
<p>gonna they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>build all this</p>
<p>thing they&rsquo;re gonna help</p>
<p>and the idea is because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so awesome new orleans is so awesome this is</p>
<p>yeah that it needs to be protected</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>crazy man because it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a lack of</p>
<p>places to move to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of spots in this country that</p>
<p>we could you</p>
<p>could relocate like</p>
<p>how many people are living in new orleans though it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be like a million</p>
<p>right yeah easy</p>
<p>something like that but</p>
<p>but you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great generator for louisiana</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real</p>
<p>problem it&rsquo;s like moving them</p>
<p>quick impossible it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>many people well man i know houston&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>since katrina but they</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>sloped it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s really not dude it&rsquo;s really fucking not</p>
<p>i mean the murder rate</p>
<p>went up like 340 percent</p>
<p>dude well we were there</p>
<p>right afterwards</p>
<p>and you could see like all</p>
<p>these people that had been displaced</p>
<p>yeah all over the streets of downtown</p>
<p>yeah this is like way different</p>
<p>than it was just a year ago yeah man</p>
<p>the whole new orleans</p>
<p>things got to</p>
<p>suck because new orleans like everybody talks about how</p>
<p>great the city is like</p>
<p>people fucking love that</p>
<p>place they love it</p>
<p>love it and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like in this shit spot like fuck man yeah</p>
<p>you can what i was saying we know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve loved the</p>
<p>moving it you really</p>
<p>could never move it you</p>
<p>never recreated it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t work it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a terrible idea</p>
<p>but you know be this</p>
<p>too bad they didn&rsquo;t slowly like fucking creep back</p>
<p>into an area</p>
<p>and keep new orleans but slowly like there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people in new orleans</p>
<p>i lived in new orleans for like six months</p>
<p>did you yeah</p>
<p>i was cooking at noless</p>
<p>and um there&rsquo;s a lot of people in new orleans</p>
<p>that believe again</p>
<p>cause it happened once in the sixties</p>
<p>during i think it was camille</p>
<p>that white people from a lake</p>
<p>punch train</p>
<p>blew up dynamite the levees</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that like a</p>
<p>spike lee conspiracy</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s a fact it&rsquo;s a fact it&rsquo;s a fact</p>
<p>and that people heard</p>
<p>loud explosions</p>
<p>that were still on the roofs</p>
<p>majority of them died when they drown</p>
<p>but okay so</p>
<p>these people they blew up the</p>
<p>levees to drown the</p>
<p>black people</p>
<p>no to drain lake poncho</p>
<p>train because it&rsquo;s like pont train with</p>
<p>the largest amount of</p>
<p>water you keep them back okay</p>
<p>so in the areas that happen to be are the nice so</p>
<p>why do they want</p>
<p>why they want to do that</p>
<p>to save the</p>
<p>white communities on</p>
<p>punch journey</p>
<p>the really expensive homes</p>
<p>okay so they had a</p>
<p>train because</p>
<p>those homes were gonna get</p>
<p>increased by</p>
<p>water yeah the</p>
<p>water was about was</p>
<p>about the flood</p>
<p>oh so they jacked everybody by</p>
<p>breaking the dams and then killing a</p>
<p>bunch of people much people must have died</p>
<p>right yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i think 95</p>
<p>of the casualties</p>
<p>from katrina happened</p>
<p>was the flooding wow</p>
<p>and people go you know you&rsquo;ve got time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like no you&rsquo;re not you know i mean that</p>
<p>water is coming in</p>
<p>and like you know</p>
<p>a foot every second</p>
<p>why the fuck</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t when the fuck you go</p>
<p>you knock the</p>
<p>hole and getting</p>
<p>stuck in your</p>
<p>house because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>water outside up to the</p>
<p>second floor</p>
<p>crazy and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stuck in the attic</p>
<p>and then outside it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>108 degrees</p>
<p>your bacon and that&rsquo;s when people die</p>
<p>wow and there was a big big</p>
<p>big problem with the amount of response and the</p>
<p>quickness the response</p>
<p>yeah man i mean we can</p>
<p>you know in 18 hours we can be in fucking afghanistan</p>
<p>with you know 10 000 troops</p>
<p>in eighteen hours</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t go to new orleans</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no money there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>money in being able to go to new orleans it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy man money is in going to</p>
<p>countries with tanks and taking care of business i</p>
<p>know but it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>anista cooper&rsquo;s there going hey was</p>
<p>hey this is all falling shit</p>
<p>well we don&rsquo;t watch cnn we watch fox news and bill</p>
<p>riley says that</p>
<p>those black people should have left and fuck him</p>
<p>did he really say that no no he did</p>
<p>not say that no no he just gives off attitude fox i had</p>
<p>news gives off and a</p>
<p>actually attitude that shared by a lot of people</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>knew that the hurricane was coming and they</p>
<p>should just leave</p>
<p>and but life on the</p>
<p>gulf if you ever</p>
<p>lived there</p>
<p>i mean you never</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get fucking hit you have</p>
<p>parties the</p>
<p>see yeah you have parties and the truth is</p>
<p>that powers out for a week week and a half</p>
<p>two weeks if you</p>
<p>could take it</p>
<p>fuck it there&rsquo;ll be ice</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll stay in your</p>
<p>house you won&rsquo;t get looted all right</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also talking</p>
<p>about people who are dirt poor</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have a disposable</p>
<p>you know in case the fucking</p>
<p>hurricane hits</p>
<p>right now of course i&rsquo;ve got you know 500</p>
<p>to take me to houston</p>
<p>to where my relatives are you know well on an</p>
<p>individual basis you</p>
<p>could always</p>
<p>understand everybody&rsquo;s own</p>
<p>problems in getting out of there but</p>
<p>and you look at it objectively they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right the people</p>
<p>that are saying why are they living there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right you really shouldn&rsquo;t be living in a</p>
<p>place where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re that close</p>
<p>to some sort of army</p>
<p>corps of engineers has</p>
<p>fucked it up i</p>
<p>mean you know army corps of engineers fucked it up yeah</p>
<p>when they dredged</p>
<p>and they put the intercosal channel in</p>
<p>they stopped</p>
<p>the wetlands from being formed</p>
<p>the natural</p>
<p>delta effect of</p>
<p>the mississippi</p>
<p>is to meander</p>
<p>and they fixed it so they had proper channels</p>
<p>for shipping</p>
<p>oh yeah and what&rsquo;s happening is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eroding coastline</p>
<p>and coastline is</p>
<p>going further</p>
<p>and further back i see it being constantly built up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being it&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>allowed to erode and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>hurricanes over the future</p>
<p>are gonna be more</p>
<p>damaging to the city of new orleans</p>
<p>and why is that important</p>
<p>because eighty</p>
<p>percent of well i know as soon as katrina happened</p>
<p>there was no fuel</p>
<p>in nashville</p>
<p>there was no fuel</p>
<p>there was no gas stations</p>
<p>and it got crazy</p>
<p>quick and people were like</p>
<p>having to go out and see</p>
<p>their neighbor and say hey do you</p>
<p>if you have gas yes i do i need to go</p>
<p>shopping i do too</p>
<p>great then when do you want to go</p>
<p>it was crazy</p>
<p>we have enough gas to go</p>
<p>shopping this was in nashville in nashville</p>
<p>how long did this go on for</p>
<p>it was gone on for like two and a half</p>
<p>weeks it didn&rsquo;t happen in georgia too it happened in a</p>
<p>lot in a lot of other</p>
<p>states because that happened</p>
<p>while we were in atlanta</p>
<p>while that was</p>
<p>going down and the people were talking</p>
<p>about it when we were working at the</p>
<p>punch line right</p>
<p>and the employees were talking</p>
<p>about how there was no gas and people were waiting on</p>
<p>giant lines to get</p>
<p>giant lines and as soon as you say</p>
<p>you would you would</p>
<p>people were</p>
<p>going on their cbs</p>
<p>and internet and looking for trucks</p>
<p>i mean you know any</p>
<p>truck any tanker that was</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>was being diverted</p>
<p>dude we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how close we are to the</p>
<p>tit dude we</p>
<p>are less than</p>
<p>eight hours away</p>
<p>from total catastrophe</p>
<p>at any time god damn it</p>
<p>ralph you made why are you</p>
<p>bringing this doomed</p>
<p>bloomware i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>trying to say</p>
<p>positive i&rsquo;m trying to be positive</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just trying to tell you that you&rsquo;re right to</p>
<p>train and be</p>
<p>ufc and be fucking</p>
<p>you know closer to your chimp</p>
<p>alright because we are very</p>
<p>close you know with our fucking iphones and</p>
<p>everything like this and twittering</p>
<p>and all this shit</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;ve got this amazing amount of power</p>
<p>that electromagnetic</p>
<p>pulse would</p>
<p>knock out completely</p>
<p>alright or or say</p>
<p>say fucking</p>
<p>terrorist you know instead of instead of</p>
<p>going for the fucking towers</p>
<p>all right they flew into that fucking</p>
<p>indian river fucking a nuclear facility</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s between poughkeepsie</p>
<p>and new york and irradiated all in new york</p>
<p>or hypernovas</p>
<p>i was watching this dr</p>
<p>hypernova hypernova</p>
<p>in other galaxies</p>
<p>these hypernovas</p>
<p>they first when they</p>
<p>first started recording them</p>
<p>they had no idea that anything</p>
<p>could emit this much power</p>
<p>the hypernovas have so much</p>
<p>power they have more</p>
<p>power than all the stars in the sky combined</p>
<p>and they happen all the time they happen</p>
<p>a couple times a day</p>
<p>they like all throughout the day they&rsquo;re happening and</p>
<p>these waves</p>
<p>these massive</p>
<p>waves of energy that cosmic rays and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>fucking massive</p>
<p>supernova sun exploding</p>
<p>rip that would just</p>
<p>destroy the entire</p>
<p>galaxy just cut through it and just rape everything</p>
<p>leave everything</p>
<p>in there and dead and just it would</p>
<p>start a new cook the galaxy</p>
<p>it would start</p>
<p>and then just</p>
<p>going off they all</p>
<p>going off this guy pop</p>
<p>jesus pop it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going off dude</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking mind blowing what&rsquo;s out there are they</p>
<p>dangerous mind</p>
<p>blowing yeah</p>
<p>what could kill all of us it was a</p>
<p>great special</p>
<p>on pbs i don&rsquo;t know if you saw the documentary i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to watch that shit or</p>
<p>think like that all the time</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just at walmart and somebody stabs you</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re a kid in milwaukee</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m scared of walmart we just</p>
<p>the heart of this you know</p>
<p>anybody have a</p>
<p>knife on you in</p>
<p>walmart yes yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s tons of</p>
<p>weapons there</p>
<p>someone pulled a</p>
<p>knife on you at walmart oh no</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>had a supernova in my face</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s true too</p>
<p>some douchebag</p>
<p>cholo supernova want to</p>
<p>start some shit</p>
<p>cosmically we were wearing chargers jerseys</p>
<p>all right we got stabbed by raiders man</p>
<p>dude i was watching</p>
<p>something i was reading rather some some</p>
<p>article online</p>
<p>about there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching these two</p>
<p>galaxies collide</p>
<p>somewhere and the</p>
<p>other just like</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>record this the yeah</p>
<p>galaxies hit each other dude</p>
<p>yeah stop and</p>
<p>think about that shit</p>
<p>like you could get hit by a planet well you know</p>
<p>everything has gravity so you know</p>
<p>the sun is the most dense</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>solar system</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s spinning in something more</p>
<p>dense to make it spin in that area</p>
<p>that rotates something else that&rsquo;s even denser</p>
<p>cause it to have a gravity</p>
<p>gravitational spin</p>
<p>while exponentially</p>
<p>space is expanding out to infinity</p>
<p>and it just fucking blows your mind it</p>
<p>when you start listening to carl</p>
<p>sagan and you</p>
<p>start listening to</p>
<p>you know stephen</p>
<p>hawking and shit like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking mind blowing with it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>where as calm as we are</p>
<p>about it all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing we just</p>
<p>you kinda have to just accept it you have</p>
<p>to accept a</p>
<p>certain level of anxiety and panic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>of what the fuck and there we are back to religion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not me it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>the big thing</p>
<p>with the real serious conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>is the 2012</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the big one i know</p>
<p>2012 and in you know</p>
<p>the beru anunnaki</p>
<p>connection that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>the big planet that&rsquo;s on an elliptical</p>
<p>orbit it&rsquo;s three thousand</p>
<p>six hundred</p>
<p>years away it comes around</p>
<p>and comes into our atmosphere</p>
<p>every you know 3</p>
<p>600 years and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where we learned</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the anunnaki came from and they</p>
<p>taught us how to mine for gold for them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>trippy dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>i love it man</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>did you see</p>
<p>that fucking died</p>
<p>you see that</p>
<p>fucking shit that passed between us and the moon</p>
<p>that big meteor</p>
<p>which time sound a bunch of</p>
<p>times yeah but i mean the one that just happened like a</p>
<p>month ago no i didn&rsquo;t pay attention to that</p>
<p>is it a big one</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>big as a semi</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>it hits it explodes in the fucking</p>
<p>atmosphere and we have what they didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>bury in nineteen eighteen</p>
<p>what it really yeah man</p>
<p>yeah something that that size</p>
<p>could do that yes</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s fucking amazing</p>
<p>you know that plane</p>
<p>the plane that we&rsquo;re talking about the</p>
<p>supersonic jet was</p>
<p>going two thousand</p>
<p>miles an hour right yeah</p>
<p>the asteroids that hit a lot of them are</p>
<p>going 45 000</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>boom stop and</p>
<p>think about that</p>
<p>vaporization just</p>
<p>screaming through</p>
<p>space and slamming into the earth</p>
<p>the one that killed the dinosaurs within the first</p>
<p>second it was five</p>
<p>miles deep into the earth wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing that&rsquo;s the one off the yucatan peninsula</p>
<p>right within</p>
<p>the first second</p>
<p>it was five miles deep</p>
<p>into the air you can&rsquo;t even you won&rsquo;t even see that</p>
<p>like like maybe on the other side no it&rsquo;s the speed of</p>
<p>light it would be a flash and you&rsquo;d be gone dude that</p>
<p>would suck devastation</p>
<p>and you know what would suck harder living</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t see if you fucking live through that you</p>
<p>would just some</p>
<p>scurrying it would cause massive</p>
<p>stealing rat</p>
<p>it mean if this</p>
<p>thing hits like like it did i mean it would turn</p>
<p>continents over the ultimate trip to</p>
<p>think that 65 million years ago there was none of this</p>
<p>there was none of us</p>
<p>there were nothing even close</p>
<p>no flowering</p>
<p>plants yeah</p>
<p>everything was totally different 65 million years</p>
<p>crazy and giant lizards that just fucked each</p>
<p>other up just</p>
<p>ate all day they ate each other</p>
<p>you know giant lizards cannibalize each other</p>
<p>they found out that</p>
<p>t rex is a huge cannibal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>recent discover really yeah huge cannibal</p>
<p>yeah they just ate</p>
<p>everything ate each</p>
<p>other they also</p>
<p>found that one dinosaur didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>exist though so i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>triceratops yeah well they</p>
<p>found that it</p>
<p>existed no it exists</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t know that it was just a</p>
<p>mature version of another dinosaur</p>
<p>what if there was only one</p>
<p>dinosaur that</p>
<p>lived and it was a huge</p>
<p>alien that ate all</p>
<p>these other creatures and barfed it out throughout the</p>
<p>earth you know</p>
<p>that none of</p>
<p>these animals actually even</p>
<p>lived on the</p>
<p>earth it was just</p>
<p>another animal</p>
<p>that barfed</p>
<p>it everywhere</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s you know like this big</p>
<p>alien came from another planet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like bar yeah and it did</p>
<p>that for two</p>
<p>hundred and</p>
<p>fifty million years</p>
<p>that adds up to the carpet</p>
<p>dating of all</p>
<p>these fossils the fuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with you matt</p>
<p>you live in a cartoon no he</p>
<p>was just one huge dinosaur that visited</p>
<p>earth once in a while he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got barf on</p>
<p>earth for a bit</p>
<p>what if we&rsquo;re just a toilet we don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>ryan that is</p>
<p>you got brain damage</p>
<p>you need to find out</p>
<p>what happened that</p>
<p>actually makes more</p>
<p>sense than a lot of things</p>
<p>oh it totally makes sense no i</p>
<p>agree with you that</p>
<p>a big giant dinosaur barfed out all</p>
<p>these dinosaurs that are here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally no</p>
<p>no bones from eating them</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>shit it out he shit it out he</p>
<p>ate them all</p>
<p>over hundreds of millions of years</p>
<p>and throughout</p>
<p>the entire evolutionary</p>
<p>chain where you can see where</p>
<p>they had like legs and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden they were probably all</p>
<p>different species because we don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>species in different</p>
<p>ways that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying that one dinosaur</p>
<p>that they just said didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist we just</p>
<p>found out it was a younger version of another dinosaur</p>
<p>yeah so all these</p>
<p>other species and all</p>
<p>these other dinosaurs we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any idea if this dinosaur is this dinosaur or you</p>
<p>know we find out new shit all the time</p>
<p>we find out new</p>
<p>shit all the time but they know most of what happened</p>
<p>the only thing is that&rsquo;s really weird</p>
<p>about any fossils is that most</p>
<p>things when they die do not</p>
<p>leave a fossil</p>
<p>when you die most likely you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna leave a fossil you</p>
<p>leave a fossil if you die in like a mudslide</p>
<p>you leave in a you</p>
<p>know most of the times you just</p>
<p>animals come</p>
<p>along and eat your bones and that&rsquo;s around this</p>
<p>monster likes to eat dinosaurs in mud</p>
<p>like bear for instance here&rsquo;s a perfect example</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to find dead bears</p>
<p>you know we know bears</p>
<p>we know bears die all the time</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really run into them</p>
<p>their bodies that often</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because they eat them</p>
<p>they eat them and rats eat them and something</p>
<p>is the bones and coyotes eat them and the bones get</p>
<p>crushed up and</p>
<p>ground out you don&rsquo;t come up on it within</p>
<p>like a matter of a week to</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how long it takes but</p>
<p>yeah sometimes you i mean</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;ve been walking through the woods in arkansas</p>
<p>and walked up on a deer carcass</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>where a whole deer you know</p>
<p>antlers and</p>
<p>everything so the</p>
<p>point is if you want to find a fossilized deer</p>
<p>good luck yeah good luck</p>
<p>good luck i mean deer have been around</p>
<p>for who knows how long let&rsquo;s say a million years or so</p>
<p>is that long enough</p>
<p>to make a fossil</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the fossilized deer</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>our pits they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>shit like that</p>
<p>right shit like that perfect example yeah</p>
<p>the pleistocene</p>
<p>ended just 10 000 years ago i just</p>
<p>i just found</p>
<p>out recently that like</p>
<p>saber to tigers and woolly mammoths they existed</p>
<p>just a little over 10 000 years right</p>
<p>where we are</p>
<p>incredible right</p>
<p>where we are</p>
<p>wrap your head around that woolly mammoths were</p>
<p>just 10 000 years ago dude wrap your mind around this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s scientists that want to</p>
<p>recreate the woolly mammoth oh i&rsquo;ve seen that russian</p>
<p>scientists yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got the dna it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a food source</p>
<p>as a huge food</p>
<p>source and in very barren land yeah they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about how they</p>
<p>could survive like i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>yeah and they they</p>
<p>would just fucking butcher them</p>
<p>and cook up the it&rsquo;s delicious</p>
<p>meat what do you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like bass bassing</p>
<p>or whatever it&rsquo;s called bison</p>
<p>really bison</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re totally different type of animal though</p>
<p>yeah you know bisons are related to like</p>
<p>horses and shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the same hoofed animals i mean</p>
<p>like the same</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re different but they&rsquo;re related</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think elephants in that i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a totally different</p>
<p>thing right</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where they</p>
<p>would incubate the the embryo</p>
<p>so in africa do people eat a lot of elephant is that</p>
<p>what they used</p>
<p>to i know they</p>
<p>still hunt them yeah</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand they kind of</p>
<p>have to hunt them in some</p>
<p>places some</p>
<p>places they overpopulate</p>
<p>and they start</p>
<p>fucking with</p>
<p>the people that live there and yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll kill</p>
<p>houses and shit they&rsquo;ll kill you</p>
<p>fucking dead dude like most i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>horrible that any elephants are fantastic animals</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s horrible that any of them have to get killed but</p>
<p>if people are</p>
<p>gonna live there and elephants are</p>
<p>gonna live there you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to choose between elephants and people</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna have to move</p>
<p>those elephants and get them</p>
<p>somehow the fuck out of there promote the people yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tricky</p>
<p>thing man elephant ears are delicious</p>
<p>apparently the</p>
<p>fuck is wrong</p>
<p>with you today</p>
<p>lathery i got hit by an elephant</p>
<p>do you still have that elephant</p>
<p>horn do the ivory dildo do you</p>
<p>still have that</p>
<p>what you don&rsquo;t remember that no</p>
<p>okay whatever you don&rsquo;t remember an ivory</p>
<p>deal though dude that escapes you really wow</p>
<p>see i&rsquo;m doing what you do now</p>
<p>stupid i&rsquo;m just making shit up oh not fun is it well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how good for conversation is that was actually</p>
<p>a possibility that i was like have an ivory dildo</p>
<p>it seems like i</p>
<p>black out i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen like i&rsquo;ve met somebody that has like something</p>
<p>ivory that&rsquo;s like why is that ivory that&rsquo;s really bad</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>think like oh did i did a</p>
<p>girl that about ivory</p>
<p>though the thing</p>
<p>about ivory is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ban on ivory</p>
<p>but they harvested</p>
<p>so many tusks</p>
<p>before the ban</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s readily available you can buy pre</p>
<p>ban ivory it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>and you got to look at it this way</p>
<p>those animals</p>
<p>were already murdered and they were murdered for</p>
<p>their horns</p>
<p>their tusks and</p>
<p>you should do something with it i mean someone</p>
<p>should either have it</p>
<p>and buy it as</p>
<p>a decoration because it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>and to remind people that</p>
<p>these majestic animals</p>
<p>live and they have these</p>
<p>crazy horns</p>
<p>or use it to make</p>
<p>things out of but</p>
<p>otherwise you&rsquo;re just wasting the fact that these</p>
<p>things died</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t make so</p>
<p>about ivory</p>
<p>nobody is good so</p>
<p>good fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you i</p>
<p>know again soap</p>
<p>dude you are like the perfect</p>
<p>child you like the child</p>
<p>so strange working with you</p>
<p>it is good soap though</p>
<p>and every soap is perfect that&rsquo;s all you need right</p>
<p>you guys use</p>
<p>soap or do you go to the liquid soap because i recently</p>
<p>switched back to soap</p>
<p>because i saw some</p>
<p>study about how</p>
<p>dirty and gross soap is</p>
<p>and then i went to body soap instead</p>
<p>and then i recently went back to body soap</p>
<p>i use this stuff called defense soap</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all for grappling</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s soap that&rsquo;s designed with all</p>
<p>these natural oils in it like tea tree oil and</p>
<p>stuff like that eucalyptus oil</p>
<p>smells great</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probiotic</p>
<p>so it encourages healthy bacteria and kills negative</p>
<p>bacteria kills</p>
<p>everything off</p>
<p>everything bad off your body</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not antibiotic or it&rsquo;s not antibacterial so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fuck with the natural</p>
<p>chemistry of your skin it actually enhances it</p>
<p>and it smells</p>
<p>good and it&rsquo;s healthy it&rsquo;s really good for your skin</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s great for</p>
<p>after jiu jitsu</p>
<p>cause you know</p>
<p>when you do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu you always</p>
<p>worry about getting skin rashes whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ringworm or some people get staph infections</p>
<p>from scratches and shit like that</p>
<p>do you use a washcloth</p>
<p>what i eat when when you shower with</p>
<p>using soap and sometimes i use a couple different</p>
<p>things yeah i gave up on the</p>
<p>sponge things in my hand</p>
<p>which shit get but</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like the</p>
<p>bacteria and all that crap get on that i use a</p>
<p>fresh one you use the same one</p>
<p>see i don&rsquo;t use anyone i use</p>
<p>use my hand</p>
<p>oh yeah you</p>
<p>still got a lot of i</p>
<p>think you clean the</p>
<p>sponge off man you wash the</p>
<p>sponge off and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s fucking rocket science i use joe can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be too much of a pussy</p>
<p>i like this shit can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be worried about</p>
<p>bacteria on your</p>
<p>sponge i like to get in there</p>
<p>get that fucking soap in there you&rsquo;ll be fine</p>
<p>but yeah the defense soap is the</p>
<p>shit if you want to try it out you go to defense soap</p>
<p>calm i think</p>
<p>and there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the guy who owns the company</p>
<p>is a guy his kids</p>
<p>wrestle and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always been around</p>
<p>wrestling and you know he got</p>
<p>tired of all</p>
<p>these kids getting ringworm</p>
<p>so he developed a soap that was a natural soap to</p>
<p>combat ringworm</p>
<p>because a lot</p>
<p>of people to go and get antibacterial soaps</p>
<p>and that antibacterial</p>
<p>it kills all the good bacteria</p>
<p>so all the shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you need to do is take</p>
<p>probiotics what</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know is one of the most important</p>
<p>things too when cold</p>
<p>season comes around man wash your</p>
<p>hands wash your fucking hands but take probiotics</p>
<p>take like acidophilus and kids</p>
<p>yeah and kombucha</p>
<p>tea is a good one too and the reason being is because</p>
<p>these are aggressive healthy bacteria</p>
<p>and when you come in contact with shitty</p>
<p>bacteria your</p>
<p>aggressive healthy bacteria</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting from the acidoplus will actually</p>
<p>fight it off yeah</p>
<p>and it keeps your body healthy and</p>
<p>strong strengthens</p>
<p>your immune</p>
<p>system wash</p>
<p>your fucking hands and take that shit and we&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>half the problems i do i do half the hand</p>
<p>sanitizer thing like</p>
<p>crazy nowadays our</p>
<p>friend johnny rotten was telling us a</p>
<p>great story last</p>
<p>night about soap</p>
<p>this is a fucking amazing</p>
<p>story that there was a</p>
<p>way to stay</p>
<p>until it gets here</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about it right now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have them come back on</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know the full details anyway but i can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>tease people like that</p>
<p>tune in next week when</p>
<p>maybe we might have done while we</p>
<p>tease them with the guam</p>
<p>story anyway</p>
<p>what happens is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go back to that don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>what this guy figured out was that there was soap</p>
<p>in hotel rooms and he would go and he</p>
<p>would wash once with it and he would put it back and</p>
<p>he thought what happens to that soap do they</p>
<p>throw it out</p>
<p>so he contacted all these</p>
<p>major chains of</p>
<p>hotels and says what do you do with your soap</p>
<p>when someone uses it once and just tosses it out</p>
<p>he go well we just throw them away</p>
<p>and he said</p>
<p>well you know that there&rsquo;s like you know an incredible</p>
<p>amount of people die of just diarrhea and children die</p>
<p>in third world countries</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have soap to wash</p>
<p>their hands with and they&rsquo;re just diarrhea</p>
<p>dying diarrhea and all that so</p>
<p>this guy decides that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to organize</p>
<p>this foundation</p>
<p>to collect soap</p>
<p>from these hospitals and they</p>
<p>clean off the soap and then be redistributed to all</p>
<p>these poor places and they&rsquo;re saving</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s lives left and right</p>
<p>amazing amazing shit amazing</p>
<p>but that shows how</p>
<p>close we are without so</p>
<p>well it just shows you how what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>going on is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting off</p>
<p>organisms all the time</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a constant battle for organisms</p>
<p>yeah and we</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;d be something that would</p>
<p>since there&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>67 billion people on the earth</p>
<p>now that there</p>
<p>would be some</p>
<p>microbe that</p>
<p>just like in</p>
<p>everything nature when</p>
<p>population gets out of</p>
<p>control there has to be something that calls the herd</p>
<p>well there is we just keep killing them</p>
<p>we keep finding vaccines for them we keep</p>
<p>finding ways around it but without a</p>
<p>doubt that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>trial but like</p>
<p>you like you</p>
<p>know antibiotic resistant</p>
<p>tuberculosis or mercer</p>
<p>staff reaction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a perfect</p>
<p>one because it actually comes from hospitals</p>
<p>and i mean people get it in hospitals</p>
<p>and it also</p>
<p>is one of those things</p>
<p>where they suspect that a lot of what this</p>
<p>stuff comes from is</p>
<p>people taking</p>
<p>their antibiotics</p>
<p>but not finishing the full cycle</p>
<p>so when you take</p>
<p>antibiotics</p>
<p>you only take</p>
<p>it for a couple of days and you go i</p>
<p>think i feel okay</p>
<p>well you haven&rsquo;t killed off all that bacteria</p>
<p>so the bacteria that lives is</p>
<p>stronger because of it</p>
<p>and then it gets to</p>
<p>leave it as</p>
<p>someone else you know because it&rsquo;s social yeah</p>
<p>so by fighting</p>
<p>things off we&rsquo;re creating even</p>
<p>stronger things and by our own</p>
<p>stupidity and</p>
<p>negligence and using</p>
<p>drugs correctly</p>
<p>yeah and i just</p>
<p>given a shit</p>
<p>yeah you got to take probiotics people if you</p>
<p>learn anything from the show it&rsquo;s that and</p>
<p>that ralphie</p>
<p>mary got arrested in</p>
<p>guam so ralphie</p>
<p>did you get strep</p>
<p>throat a lot i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um not even answering</p>
<p>all right so meanwhile back</p>
<p>and how are we</p>
<p>going back in guam</p>
<p>okay marianas trench hardest safest</p>
<p>trench in the world yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>you had this bag in that you just no no let him go</p>
<p>i had a backpack</p>
<p>right and i am at the bottom of it i had fourteen</p>
<p>grams and a smelly proof bag</p>
<p>jesus christ fourteen grams that&rsquo;s almost a pound</p>
<p>no fourteen grams it&rsquo;s ounce</p>
<p>half an ounce is instead of grams</p>
<p>okay so fourteen grams is almost an ounce why do you</p>
<p>have no no it&rsquo;s half an ounce what is half an ounce</p>
<p>14 grams 14 grams so why do you have that much weed</p>
<p>i thought i took it all out</p>
<p>i took out three and a half gram i mean</p>
<p>three and a half grams you know what&rsquo;s annoying</p>
<p>about grams and shit</p>
<p>grams are metric</p>
<p>yeah okay but</p>
<p>28 ounces or not ounces are that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>standard that&rsquo;s what we use</p>
<p>so like we have all this shit</p>
<p>mixed up like grams or mixed</p>
<p>up like if you do a joke about grams</p>
<p>or drug addicts yeah no drugs</p>
<p>or cereal lovers</p>
<p>i always get them</p>
<p>fucking confused</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s weird that they&rsquo;re from a different</p>
<p>system that when we get low we use grams</p>
<p>but like when someone talks to me</p>
<p>about centimeters i have to go okay what who&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>what is that 134</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always dealing in kilograms too because of</p>
<p>fight it&rsquo;s 22 pounds we do fights in europe the</p>
<p>weirdest one is in england they have</p>
<p>stone stones right yeah</p>
<p>which is like i believe it&rsquo;s somewhere around</p>
<p>13 pounds stone he&rsquo;ll say he&rsquo;s 10 stone</p>
<p>that means like 130 pounds</p>
<p>wow how weird is that</p>
<p>crazy yeah what does that mean</p>
<p>they got a lot of leftover shit the reason why they</p>
<p>drive horse</p>
<p>with hands and stuff like that what</p>
<p>horses with hands</p>
<p>horses with hands yeah they measure a</p>
<p>horse&rsquo;s height and guitars</p>
<p>by its by its hands</p>
<p>they call it hands like</p>
<p>oh person&rsquo;s hand how many</p>
<p>hands i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>the exact person yeah i think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>eight point</p>
<p>four inches is one hand</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wow</p>
<p>really yeah yeah so like a horse</p>
<p>stands like 12 hands</p>
<p>big fucking</p>
<p>horse how strange is the whole fucking measuring</p>
<p>system being different everywhere</p>
<p>you know inches and kilometers</p>
<p>they tried they</p>
<p>were all supposed to convert</p>
<p>and i said fuck it</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that weird that we didn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>how dumb are we</p>
<p>like we wanted to make sure that people</p>
<p>figured it out</p>
<p>so we said you know it&rsquo;s too complicated</p>
<p>not enough people are</p>
<p>gonna figure it out fuck it all it is is just a new</p>
<p>system based on 10</p>
<p>yeah if you learn inches fucking for sure you can</p>
<p>learn kilometers it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>going away very soon</p>
<p>going away all the different</p>
<p>you know things like the</p>
<p>the grams the ounces the language barriers</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>going away in</p>
<p>five years even</p>
<p>maybe 10 years when it gets so good that</p>
<p>voice activation like</p>
<p>being able to have something on your person</p>
<p>so if a person&rsquo;s talking japanese it&rsquo;s automatically</p>
<p>just going to</p>
<p>translate it for you into english</p>
<p>if somebody&rsquo;s telling you 12 feet instead</p>
<p>of 12 ounces or whatever it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be see the problem is</p>
<p>when you translate languages like i say if you</p>
<p>translate japanese into english</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to also</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>translate it into english and have it</p>
<p>direct it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come out real funky</p>
<p>because the way they talk and</p>
<p>communicate is almost</p>
<p>absolutely in it so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of creative license</p>
<p>involved in</p>
<p>structuring sentences that are</p>
<p>gonna make sense but that&rsquo;s easy compared to most</p>
<p>technology i mean</p>
<p>look at the</p>
<p>shit already i mean you&rsquo;re fucking calling up</p>
<p>macy&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s like say one</p>
<p>you know say two right</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>that is pretty dope you know so</p>
<p>i love the car</p>
<p>thing i love being able to tell my car call</p>
<p>brian yeah and it just calls you yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insane man yeah that is so dope yeah</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s iphones can do that</p>
<p>voice control</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>that freaks me out</p>
<p>and my friend</p>
<p>cade has not cade</p>
<p>was it dustin has</p>
<p>one of those droid xs</p>
<p>and he sent</p>
<p>phones a shit he sent a text by talking to it</p>
<p>he talked to it and he</p>
<p>no he made something like</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m here with joe rogan and he says i love you</p>
<p>and i look at it and it says i&rsquo;m here with joe</p>
<p>logan that was the only</p>
<p>thing was wrong</p>
<p>it picked up</p>
<p>logan instead of rogan</p>
<p>was he like hey my battery is</p>
<p>about to die on my droid call me call my friends</p>
<p>never mind i don&rsquo;t know that joke</p>
<p>this phone suck battery life</p>
<p>they suck battery life</p>
<p>yeah but you can always keep an</p>
<p>extra battery the thing</p>
<p>about iphones it suck is</p>

<p>two minutes of waiting for the last</p>
<p>dollar of gas when you pre play come on it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>yeah do they have one of those</p>
<p>with the new iphone</p>
<p>remember how they used to be able to buy the old chart</p>
<p>the the extra</p>
<p>large charger was gigantic</p>
<p>and it was not a</p>
<p>charger rather battery</p>
<p>and it was on the back of it</p>
<p>you acted as a case</p>
<p>but also acted as a battery and double yeah</p>
<p>do they have that for the new</p>
<p>phone not yet</p>
<p>the new iphone or yeah the iphone 4 oh yeah</p>
<p>absolutely they have one of</p>
<p>those new big ones yeah</p>
<p>absolutely yeah amazon com</p>
<p>is it just as</p>
<p>cumbersome and large</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty big there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a few different ones now but the new iphone has like 40</p>
<p>more battery</p>
<p>life so does this one have double that and it</p>
<p>charges a lot</p>
<p>faster yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot faster</p>
<p>the ones that</p>
<p>i forget the name</p>
<p>of the company that makes it but they</p>
<p>double your battery life</p>
<p>dude we&rsquo;re wealthy</p>
<p>mouthy mouthy</p>
<p>mouthy i don&rsquo;t know like mouthy may</p>
<p>i know yeah</p>
<p>power and batteries man that is a big</p>
<p>major hold up now like</p>
<p>these electric cars they&rsquo;re trying to put together</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all well and good</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>150 miles that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best you can do is</p>
<p>150 miles and that&rsquo;s if you drive cool</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t freak</p>
<p>like they took one of those</p>
<p>teslas you know they have</p>
<p>those electric</p>
<p>like sports car</p>
<p>yeah and they they beat the fucking shit out of this</p>
<p>thing around a track</p>
<p>but it was it was cooked in like a couple of</p>
<p>miles man a couple of</p>
<p>miles that bitch was done</p>
<p>you know they did it like for</p>
<p>maybe 20 miles or something they ran this</p>
<p>track a few times a few laps and i ran in full</p>
<p>speed this is</p>
<p>cowboy it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the sound of</p>
<p>juice was done</p>
<p>yeah they tested it</p>
<p>against a bunch of</p>
<p>other cars like the boxster and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>sports cars</p>
<p>different little</p>
<p>sporty little</p>
<p>sort of convertible type cars</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not there yet</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>technology is not</p>
<p>quite there yet and the weight is</p>
<p>ridiculous so you got all this weight behind the car</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s no real engine in the</p>
<p>front it&rsquo;s not like a big fucking</p>
<p>v8 that balances out all</p>
<p>these batteries in the back no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>weird little electric engine in the front</p>
<p>and in the back you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>giant bricks and</p>
<p>bricks of these lithium</p>
<p>ion batteries and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super heavy and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna die</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna last they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna die off you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not simple i</p>
<p>could just change the</p>
<p>spark plugs now you</p>
<p>gotta get new batteries</p>
<p>you got all new batteries your batteries suck now</p>
<p>you gotta get</p>
<p>that engine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird man it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>technology that area of</p>
<p>technology it seems to be there&rsquo;s a little bit of</p>
<p>a lag hump there yeah it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>turn into wireless</p>
<p>electricity</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s it has to be</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>these you know</p>
<p>tesla had a</p>
<p>had a fucking</p>
<p>thank for that yeah yeah</p>
<p>westinghouse when they</p>
<p>found out what he&rsquo;s doing they closed him down</p>
<p>yeah they shutting the fuck down</p>
<p>crazy guy wanted to give away</p>
<p>free electricity to the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>to radiate that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s next though for</p>
<p>lack what if</p>
<p>is based on is harp</p>
<p>based on tesla&rsquo;s technology</p>
<p>all technologies</p>
<p>based on tesla</p>
<p>really is that but</p>
<p>all modern technology</p>
<p>satellite technology</p>
<p>right but directly did</p>
<p>tesla have something to do with it</p>
<p>i would assume so</p>
<p>not bad we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find out</p>
<p>but so you know it took him</p>
<p>like 30 years after his</p>
<p>death to finally get the credit for inventing the</p>
<p>radio descended from</p>
<p>tesla&rsquo;s work wow</p>
<p>dude they it took</p>
<p>like 30 years</p>
<p>after his death to get credit to for inventing radio</p>
<p>yeah everybody gives it to</p>
<p>marconi hmm</p>
<p>yeah still when you hear</p>
<p>about it you hear marconi</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>about that and he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do it he</p>
<p>had like a hundred</p>
<p>different fucking</p>
<p>things what</p>
<p>dude he was constantly</p>
<p>admitting yeah</p>
<p>but they said he was</p>
<p>like a like</p>
<p>autistic he</p>
<p>would be diagnosed today</p>
<p>oh yeah well you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about that with</p>
<p>a friend of</p>
<p>mine that i have that has autistic children or a</p>
<p>autistic kid</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like the aptitude that</p>
<p>these kids have for</p>
<p>learning things and for</p>
<p>holding information and</p>
<p>for dispensing it and spitting it back out</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shocking it almost makes you</p>
<p>think like wonder if this is like some weird</p>
<p>hiccup up to the next</p>
<p>stage of evolution exactly</p>
<p>that what we&rsquo;re seeing is obviously a disease</p>
<p>these kids are obviously impaired when it comes to</p>
<p>being able to</p>
<p>communicate emotionally and being able to reach out</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think nature constantly when it goes to evolve</p>
<p>in anything any form over the history of the</p>
<p>earth through evolution</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s made a lot of fuck ups till the one</p>
<p>thing hit and then</p>
<p>boom that&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>level well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the idea is that we have mutations and that from</p>
<p>those mutations the ones that are useful</p>
<p>are kept yeah</p>
<p>you know natural selection</p>
<p>dictates that we move</p>
<p>in that direction</p>
<p>right but that&rsquo;s what all of the</p>
<p>evolution of</p>
<p>mankind or any animal supposed to be from that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the theories you know there&rsquo;s a few theories</p>
<p>but the idea that</p>
<p>these kids that are</p>
<p>super genius kids</p>
<p>like what they&rsquo;re having is</p>
<p>just like a blip or just a</p>
<p>glimpse as to the potential of what</p>
<p>human beings can do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this one kid man</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what we talked</p>
<p>about on the podcast i</p>
<p>think we might have</p>
<p>he flew over europe</p>
<p>and looked out his window at germany from his airplane</p>
<p>and then drew it when he got home</p>
<p>drew it in absolute perfect detail every city</p>
<p>every rather block</p>
<p>every house</p>
<p>every window all in the perfect</p>
<p>place perfect perspective perfect size</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking incredible</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>roller this is a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>this is a human</p>
<p>being that can</p>
<p>do something that i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do and you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t brush your</p>
<p>teeth he has a hard time with a lot of</p>
<p>other aspects of life</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m wonder</p>
<p>if like wonder if this is like some overpowering</p>
<p>blip of the new future</p>
<p>you know this overpowering</p>
<p>just like one little</p>
<p>thing like maybe he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>whole package</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>whole super</p>
<p>fucking dr manhattan</p>
<p>package yeah but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>close that one gets with another one</p>
<p>then that offspring</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that guy</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely wapner guy though</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s that same</p>
<p>thing you know like</p>
<p>the movie raymond</p>
<p>whatever that is</p>
<p>yeah it is the same</p>
<p>thing autism so maybe</p>
<p>anyone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>special needs is</p>
<p>the future of what we</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s not special needs because a lot of</p>
<p>that is just a mistake that you know in the dog eat dog</p>
<p>world of nature we</p>
<p>would not allowed to survive you know if we were living</p>
<p>thousands of years ago and you had</p>
<p>kids that were like heavily deformed they didn&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what happened they get eaten</p>
<p>yeah i mean so</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>but it all is mutation you know and it comes</p>
<p>mutation sometimes i mean the idea is that</p>
<p>i mean isn&rsquo;t it like the idea that a lot of mutation</p>
<p>comes from radiation comes from like just</p>
<p>fucking shit in</p>
<p>space and the sun</p>
<p>suppose this</p>
<p>triggers mutation and sometimes</p>
<p>these mutations lead to evolution</p>
<p>yeah to better</p>
<p>survivability</p>
<p>yeah man it</p>
<p>could very well be that what we&rsquo;re seeing i mean</p>
<p>could you imagine if you were a regular person</p>
<p>who had you know regular social</p>
<p>skills and totally</p>
<p>normal and you regular insecurities but</p>
<p>for whatever reason you were</p>
<p>capable of looking</p>
<p>at berlin out the window of an airplane</p>
<p>and then just drawing it in extreme detail like into a</p>
<p>point where people are</p>
<p>shocked like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>magical power</p>
<p>of retention</p>
<p>but that would be amazing i mean fuck</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>photographic memory beyond comprehension yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always someone who&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you only get so much</p>
<p>horsepower you know</p>
<p>right and your</p>
<p>brain has so much</p>
<p>horsepower how much do you want to</p>
<p>dedicate to this</p>
<p>how much are you</p>
<p>gonna dedicate to art how much you</p>
<p>gonna dedicate to</p>
<p>think well yeah michelangelo leonardo da vinci</p>
<p>i wonder what</p>
<p>those do like</p>
<p>they were supposedly</p>
<p>autistic according to</p>
<p>you know cause they were in written history</p>
<p>you know i bet</p>
<p>their pants</p>
<p>you think that michelangelo and davinci</p>
<p>were both autistic why do you think that</p>
<p>they say they</p>
<p>were higher functioning autistic is what they</p>
<p>would be described as</p>
<p>the really but how do</p>
<p>they know that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have any recordings of them communicating</p>
<p>and diaries they have letters they have</p>
<p>the communications the writings leonardo</p>
<p>da vinci&rsquo;s writings imagine if they</p>
<p>found your shit</p>
<p>and they just looked oh man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s retarded he&rsquo;s retarded</p>
<p>ralphime was retarded</p>
<p>they saw my</p>
<p>notebook they</p>
<p>would be funny</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s retarded we saw his comedy</p>
<p>and we knew he was a talented performer</p>
<p>but we always wondered what was it oh well when</p>
<p>we read his writing we realized he was retarded yeah</p>
<p>people just like</p>
<p>judge you and shit</p>
<p>based on shit they file hundreds of years from now</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t do that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tell me that leonardo</p>
<p>da vinci had autism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do you know we</p>
<p>call tosser a genius</p>
<p>but there was some</p>
<p>other guy who was a</p>
<p>dirty guy you know</p>
<p>i mean chaucer&rsquo;s dirtiest</p>
<p>thing was the miller&rsquo;s tale who who you talking</p>
<p>about jeffrey chaucer</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s that what is this he was the</p>
<p>first novelist</p>
<p>the first novelist ever</p>
<p>well he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write the first</p>
<p>novel the first</p>
<p>novel was beowulf but</p>
<p>the first novel</p>
<p>of substance that was</p>
<p>printed with the</p>
<p>printing press</p>
<p>was jeffrey chaucer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the canterbury tails</p>
<p>oh yeah and one of them was called the miller&rsquo;s tail</p>
<p>and he uses the past</p>
<p>tense of shit</p>
<p>and this is in like the 1500s you mean like shot yeah</p>
<p>powerful yeah yeah it was great and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s giving credit with</p>
<p>creating the word fuck</p>
<p>how great a word is that</p>
<p>and writing it downing and using it</p>
<p>but i thought that was supposed</p>
<p>to be for fornication and the consent of the king</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it was originally</p>
<p>for for unlawful</p>
<p>carnal knowledge one of the</p>
<p>two there&rsquo;s a lot of debate</p>
<p>about that but</p>
<p>he used it in print</p>
<p>like fuck you</p>
<p>like yeah like</p>
<p>go fuck yourself really or let&rsquo;s fuck wow yeah</p>
<p>powerful and but there was somebody else i mean you</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s the only writer in all of england</p>
<p>and that ever wrote</p>
<p>a dirty shit you know it just</p>
<p>never got published you know</p>
<p>like like like</p>
<p>you know if we just</p>
<p>judge comedy by seinfeld okay</p>
<p>what we do you and i</p>
<p>would not even consider comedy</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be running lunatics</p>
<p>you know what i mean in</p>
<p>comparison with a joke</p>
<p>setup punch</p>
<p>you know no opinion</p>
<p>observational comedy</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like but he was the most popular</p>
<p>therefore he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known as that time&rsquo;s</p>
<p>greatest guy there&rsquo;s nothing that shows the</p>
<p>evolution of</p>
<p>culture more than</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>you know in my opinion it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>weird when you go back and like listen to like</p>
<p>lenny bruce&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stuff yeah you know go back and listen to like this is</p>
<p>stuff that he got him arrested</p>
<p>you know in like</p>
<p>1950s and 1960s</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s less than a potluck at the</p>
<p>fucking comedy</p>
<p>store you can get it on nbc you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>comic standing with all of his shit</p>
<p>yeah right yeah i mean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>barely offensive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so strange</p>
<p>we had some good shit though even back then yeah he</p>
<p>had some good perspectives on like the catholic church</p>
<p>and stuff like that</p>
<p>how about on</p>
<p>he had a bunch of different</p>
<p>things man how</p>
<p>about my favorite one was he did on</p>
<p>homosexuality being illegal</p>
<p>oh yeah take this man</p>
<p>homosexuality is illegal so they if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gay they arrest you</p>
<p>what do they do</p>
<p>they put you in jail</p>
<p>with a bunch of guys who</p>
<p>wanna have sex with you</p>
<p>yeah yeah it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>this is a joke that he did in like the 50s and i saw a</p>
<p>comic who i know is not a joke</p>
<p>thief but he</p>
<p>tried to re say it</p>
<p>in like the 90s</p>
<p>and i had to say you know that&rsquo;s like a lenny</p>
<p>bruce joke from like 1950 something</p>
<p>and he was like shit</p>
<p>yeah of course somebody</p>
<p>already thought that up yeah of course of course</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what shitty</p>
<p>about it all you know is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s come before us</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s great though that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>still things to talk</p>
<p>about if it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>then we would suck</p>
<p>you know but that is</p>
<p>having this</p>
<p>you know the people</p>
<p>need to slowly</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>take a joke over the course of 50 or 60 years</p>
<p>right the kind of shit that you</p>
<p>could talk or i can talk on</p>
<p>stage now you couldn&rsquo;t do that back then no way man</p>
<p>thank god that they did that cause they</p>
<p>broke a lot of</p>
<p>boundaries man</p>
<p>richard pryor got a lot of people used to people saying</p>
<p>pussy and motherfucker and yeah</p>
<p>he got people used to that shit</p>
<p>lenny bruce got people used to questioning</p>
<p>things questioning</p>
<p>the use of words questioning you know</p>
<p>sorts of aspects of our</p>
<p>culture they got</p>
<p>people to take a joke they got people to like kind of</p>
<p>lighten up and</p>
<p>understand this just</p>
<p>relax everybody</p>
<p>so worked up over now you know</p>
<p>like the use of</p>
<p>derogatory slang as far as</p>
<p>names go you know is</p>
<p>it and it&rsquo;s just just all worked up like</p>
<p>your your outrage is a</p>
<p>is a learned thing and</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t learn that</p>
<p>the n word was something supposed to be offensive</p>
<p>it would just be another two</p>
<p>syllable word</p>
<p>and by calling it the n word you just embolden</p>
<p>that word and keep it in our vernacular</p>
<p>that if you use the word like</p>
<p>groovy or far out or</p>
<p>you know why do</p>
<p>these words and phrases you know</p>
<p>leave our vernacular</p>
<p>and become uncool</p>
<p>groovy&rsquo;s still awesome</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still good i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still down with groovy</p>
<p>and if i&rsquo;m stoned when i see something i&rsquo;ll say far out</p>
<p>right right but not many people say it far out man</p>
<p>yeah and it</p>
<p>crazy i&rsquo;m using that from now on far out back bitches</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming back like the fanny pack</p>
<p>and the fanny</p>
<p>pack coming back</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>

<p>like how your life intersected</p>
<p>with their life and</p>
<p>where they at now there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to go back</p>

<p>learn from you</p>
<p>learn from and</p>
<p>they learn from you and you</p>
<p>learn from them and they&rsquo;re not who they</p>
<p>were back then and neither are you who you were you</p>

<p>every single one of us</p>
<p>fucking insanely crazy</p>
<p>sure a lot of people are dumb and</p>
<p>crazy and they just</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t got a handle on themselves yet</p>
<p>but i was exceptionally fucked up</p>
<p>i was fighting i was</p>
<p>still competing</p>
<p>i was kickboxing and i was doing taekwondo</p>
<p>tournaments and</p>
<p>at the time i did not know</p>
<p>what the fuck i was doing with my life and it was all</p>
<p>spent on just trying to figure out it was all</p>
<p>martial arts competition had been my</p>
<p>whole past then</p>
<p>i was trying to figure out what the fuck i was</p>
<p>gonna do with my future and then i</p>
<p>started getting into comedy and that&rsquo;s why i met this</p>
<p>crazy bitch</p>
<p>the knife the knife</p>

<p>leary and nick&rsquo;s comedy stop and fucking</p>
<p>they were like holy shit this guy&rsquo;s killer it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>and then it was like</p>
<p>maybe a month or two</p>
<p>later hicks came into town</p>
<p>and everybody was</p>
<p>like oh you got to see this guy like paul barkley who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the owners of the comedy club is a real comedy</p>

<p>and i see great writing but i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard these premises before and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard the bits before</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard a couple of them</p>
<p>and like there was like holy shit this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing the same</p>
<p>stuff that leery was doing</p>
<p>like the same premises</p>
<p>about like just</p>
<p>jim fix dying of a</p>
<p>heart attack</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s jogging is like</p>
<p>a few of them they were like all</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t remember if that was the specific one</p>
<p>there was a few of them</p>
<p>they were like really the same jokes and the same bits</p>
<p>so i asked like the</p>
<p>local comics i go what the fuck is up</p>
<p>and their response was</p>
<p>leary steals</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like really leary</p>
<p>just fucking</p>

<p>like guy who like really was looking deep</p>
<p>into shit and taking mushrooms and</p>
<p>going on peyote trips and</p>
<p>trying to find himself</p>
<p>and then i guess</p>
<p>some people were just feeding off of it</p>
<p>you know i know in houston</p>
<p>he let me open for him once at the last</p>
<p>stop houston</p>

<p>in such a way</p>
<p>i have a connection with a couple of</p>
<p>radio guys like that</p>
<p>where he talks</p>
<p>about we&rsquo;d had sam over</p>
<p>we knew it was out of control</p>
<p>you know we knew that he was fucking</p>
<p>you know it was crazy and</p>
<p>he was out of control and we knew he was</p>
<p>gonna die but</p>
<p>he was on the</p>
<p>road and we wanted to give him a home cooked meal so</p>
<p>we brought him home from radio and</p>
<p>i have a friend of mine</p>
<p>cowhead in tampa</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like that</p>
<p>that the fact that he died at 38</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m at my</p>
<p>level my comedy and i&rsquo;m 38</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fucking you know it fucks with your head dude</p>

<p>you know you</p>
<p>think about mortality</p>
<p>i think about it more and more</p>

<p>losing weight slowly and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s plateaus</p>
<p>unless i exercise and if i don&rsquo;t feel well i can or</p>
<p>exercise you know i hurt physically hurt and</p>
<p>and then to compound that they want to give me</p>
<p>painkillers</p>
<p>and if i take the painkillers i don&rsquo;t want to move</p>
<p>you know what i mean so it&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>place you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve got physical</p>
<p>element i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got physical fucking problems i was in a car</p>
<p>wreck about</p>
<p>forty two bones</p>
<p>sixty four separate breaks</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fucked up whoa</p>
<p>wait a minute</p>
<p>you were in a car accident and you have 42</p>
<p>broken bones yeah</p>
<p>when was this 16 1988</p>
<p>holy shit dude yeah</p>
<p>i was in the hospital for 48 days and then</p>
<p>after that i was in a</p>
<p>wheelchair for 10</p>
<p>months oh my god yeah i had spina</p>
<p>swelling i broke</p>
<p>my two vertebrae in my neck</p>
<p>i fractured</p>
<p>two vertebrae in my neck</p>
<p>three in my back</p>
<p>i broke one of the wings off my vertebrae</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s right there so i have sciatic problems</p>
<p>and that they say i have amazingly</p>
<p>dense bones</p>
<p>and that i was very fortunate to live through it and</p>
<p>you know it just fucking changes</p>
<p>everything and there</p>
<p>there goes your fucking last couple years of being a</p>
<p>teenager then</p>
<p>then you know</p>
<p>as a you people</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re retarded and you get</p>
<p>for me they thought i was retarded</p>
<p>and then they gave me a test and</p>
<p>found that i was actually really smart</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>put me in this beginning scholars program at the</p>
<p>university of arkansas</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when i</p>
<p>started doing a comedy</p>
<p>because my group met at a shakey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pizza on highway 71 in fayetteville arkansas</p>
<p>and our study</p>
<p>group in organic chemistry</p>
<p>met there and i fucking</p>
<p>hung out and there was an open mic contest</p>
<p>and the winner got free</p>
<p>pizza and a fucking picture</p>
<p>and i had a joke</p>
<p>about vanna</p>
<p>white&rsquo;s the dumbest person ever on</p>
<p>television she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even have to</p>
<p>know how to</p>
<p>spell the words</p>
<p>they light them up for</p>
<p>her and she just walks</p>
<p>over there and turns the fucking letter i mean somebody</p>
<p>could tell her how to do it i mean why are you</p>
<p>shocked when the fucking letter comes up you know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know how to</p>
<p>spell it you&rsquo;re the dumbest bitch ever</p>
<p>okay and then i said</p>
<p>that i can&rsquo;t even though i love def</p>
<p>leppard i can&rsquo;t see him</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t watch him because if i</p>
<p>watch him you know</p>
<p>in concert i feel</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m mocking the drummer with two arms and clapping</p>
<p>and applauding and raising both hands up you know</p>
<p>i feel like so this is</p>
<p>how you win you just</p>
<p>started out yeah</p>
<p>yeah and this is just you know</p>
<p>right general premise i had jokes within</p>
<p>and i had seen it enough that i had this and i want to</p>
<p>stand up comedy contest and it went on</p>
<p>from there moved from the shaky</p>
<p>speeds to the ramada inn</p>
<p>by the mall</p>
<p>in fayetteville</p>
<p>while i was</p>
<p>going to school</p>
<p>and it all happened because</p>
<p>they tested me and i got into comedy you know</p>
<p>they tested you</p>
<p>and they tested me</p>
<p>see if i was retarded they gave me an iq test and they</p>
<p>found out i was actually that&rsquo;s how you got into comedy</p>
<p>they said you needed to go tell jokes</p>
<p>no no is the fact that my</p>
<p>study group showed up there</p>
<p>shaky&rsquo;s pizza</p>
<p>where they had did</p>
<p>you have like a</p>
<p>dream of being a</p>

<p>you go down there do you work</p>
<p>i work there i do concerts on little rock</p>
<p>i want to do one at</p>
<p>university of arkansas i&rsquo;m a big</p>
<p>razorback fan and i love to do one back there because</p>
<p>my first gig i got to work with sam kennison</p>
<p>i won one of those</p>
<p>talent show contests is k hog the local</p>
<p>radio station</p>
<p>had a talent show contest</p>
<p>he was playing the ballroom</p>
<p>and like 89</p>
<p>you know what makes me sad</p>
<p>about comedy dude when i remember houston</p>
<p>remember what houston was like</p>
<p>yeah when i remember what houston</p>
<p>was like when i</p>
<p>first started</p>
<p>going there</p>
<p>with that fucking</p>
<p>open mic man</p>
<p>that open mic</p>
<p>that would stop and</p>
<p>start at seven and go</p>
<p>till two and</p>
<p>never a comedian repeated or if they did there was a</p>
<p>sketch or something live</p>
<p>and the audience constantly came in and out</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re walking outside and smoking weed and</p>
<p>back in the</p>
<p>back of the room talking shit there was a lot of good</p>
<p>comics there</p>
<p>there was a lot of guys</p>
<p>who were trying there was a lot of</p>
<p>experimental</p>
<p>amazing smart shit good ethic</p>
<p>of the town was like</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want hacks in there</p>
<p>right and they all knew</p>
<p>that like hicks came from there and kennison came from</p>
<p>this heritage</p>
<p>yeah there was something</p>
<p>there in that town and boy it just got extinguished</p>
<p>it just got extinguished</p>
<p>you know and i hear guys say hey we&rsquo;re working out</p>
<p>again we got this</p>
<p>going on again</p>
<p>but man there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>about guys coming out of houston anymore</p>
<p>no added courage</p>
<p>came out of there and there was</p>
<p>so much wasted</p>
<p>talent man yeah</p>
<p>no i mean that&rsquo;s my favorite line</p>
<p>brian hersey do you remember</p>
<p>brian hersey</p>
<p>a genius that dude is</p>
<p>funny as fuck and it just kind of like stopped now</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s drunk that</p>
<p>quit comedy</p>
<p>that ain&rsquo;t cool man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>place like had a flower</p>
<p>that was growing and then some another</p>
<p>clouds grew overhead and the flower fucking died</p>
<p>it was right there man i</p>
<p>think comedy was</p>
<p>about to evolve from there</p>
<p>it was one there&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be a bunch of</p>
<p>places 30 40</p>
<p>comedians come out of there</p>
<p>and and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m only giving you like</p>
<p>maybe 10 15</p>
<p>of the actual comedy community i mean</p>
<p>there was one open mic</p>
<p>that had literally over a hundred</p>
<p>comics before</p>
<p>okay and not everybody got to go on</p>
<p>it so the improv</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not doing it now</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do it on that level</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t foster</p>
<p>local talent</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>those improvs are too</p>
<p>clean man the last stop was</p>
<p>dirty it was</p>
<p>dirty and marty</p>
<p>babbitt was running it it was just fucking people chaos</p>
<p>that place was</p>
<p>chaos crazy it</p>
<p>was nuttiness to the extreme</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>the only way</p>
<p>you get the real comedy to develop</p>
<p>especially developing comedy</p>
<p>there has to be</p>
<p>chaos it has to be like the comedy</p>
<p>store it has to be like that</p>
<p>place like the last they</p>
<p>get stifled if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t grow as a comedian i mean i grew to a certain</p>
<p>level like i knew how to rock a room but i had to do it</p>
<p>cleaner and i had</p>
<p>and i was a product of my environment i went up</p>
<p>a lot of times i mean working the last stop was maybe</p>
<p>six times a year</p>
<p>you know as work goes but i</p>
<p>would work out</p>
<p>every weekend at this</p>
<p>place called the comedy showcase and</p>
<p>go freeway in fuquay</p>
<p>and it was owned by</p>
<p>very smooth i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s smoother than</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably one of the most</p>
<p>smooth comedians i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>as far as like in an hour go in and out of subject</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just one conversation</p>
<p>a guy named</p>
<p>danny martinez</p>
<p>and his club</p>
<p>he taught comics like he would have</p>
<p>wednesday through</p>
<p>sunday and you get 10 15</p>
<p>minute spots</p>
<p>and it was just a showcase club</p>
<p>and then also i&rsquo;d go and play the big</p>
<p>black i mean</p>
<p>the hip hop comedy stop</p>
<p>up in a hotel</p>
<p>black room and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>i developed all these</p>
<p>black jokes</p>
<p>cause i was the fucking audience</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s all i had you know and</p>
<p>and then i started meeting you</p>
<p>know i was probably to hanging around with mexicans and</p>
<p>black people</p>
<p>all right and people go</p>
<p>where did you get this fucking accent from</p>
<p>where you talk like that it&rsquo;s like well it was</p>
<p>funny to the fucking</p>
<p>crowd i was</p>
<p>i was playing for so anyway</p>
<p>you what you&rsquo;re saying is there was a lot of different</p>
<p>places to go up there and</p>
<p>houston houston had a real interesting comedy dynamic</p>
<p>so many when that last stop</p>
