<p>basically blew up he landed into it like</p>
<p>he blew up like what 10 feet or</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>I tell people on the lucky bottle so</p>
<p>like you throw a ball up in the air and</p>
<p>sometimes one a million chances it lands</p>
<p>directly on the top or the bottom at the</p>
<p>top like you know and nothing spills so</p>
<p>I got blown up a mile it and I landed</p>
<p>right in the crater like head fell and</p>
<p>my legs were like up in there you know</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>in a tree but well I was I was in the</p>
<p>ground yeah well my legs were up in the</p>
<p>air and the guys just got on top he just</p>
<p>started like random you know going town</p>
<p>so basically yeah he he lost both legs</p>
<p>and so anyway I wanted just to do a</p>
<p>video on this because he also is doing</p>
<p>Quito and but first I want to just talk</p>
<p>about his story you used to play with GI</p>
<p>Joes that&rsquo;s we have in common right all</p>
<p>the way I dunno yeah you probably know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t still deals but so the point</p>
<p>is you got into the military after 9/11</p>
<p>right you got in there you Army Airborne</p>
<p>you you did training and then you</p>
<p>basically tell us a little bit about</p>
<p>whatever at that point</p>
<p>okay so 9/11 happened I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>go fight for my country like nobody</p>
<p>comes and attacks our backyard nope not</p>
<p>on my watch I&rsquo;m from New York sorry</p>
<p>buddy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going in so airborne infantry then I</p>
<p>will try it out for Army Rangers got</p>
<p>hurt but being from New York we just</p>
<p>keep on going back right how many times</p>
<p>you four times and never made it oh God</p>
<p>and you know what I wasn&rsquo;t for</p>
<p>punishment</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Niagara Falls right Buffalo</p>
<p>Bills yeah go into Super Bowl four times</p>
<p>or our loss I actually have four Special</p>
<p>Forces four times never made what what</p>
<p>about with civil forfeiture that is</p>
<p>internal right</p>
<p>fascinating Wow so I was uh yeah I</p>
<p>remember in high school I had a</p>
<p>recruiter come to my house and he say</p>
<p>you want to join the military I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>oh yeah I want to shoot grenades I want</p>
<p>to do this so I signed up went to Fort</p>
<p>Jackson South Carolina and then I went</p>
<p>to Fort Sam and became a medic and then</p>
<p>uh and an x-ray tech and so I did that</p>
<p>for five and a half years but it was</p>
<p>reserved so there&rsquo;s nothing really</p>
<p>happening back then in the early 80s</p>
<p>still service yeah it was a great</p>
<p>experience so have a little common</p>
<p>thread there so so tell us what happened</p>
<p>at that point you in a second were you a</p>
<p>sergeant did you thank you officer no I</p>
<p>was not at that point time they did</p>
<p>enlist</p>
<p>chiropractors okay yeah I was just going</p>
<p>through Chiropractic College mm-hmm the</p>
<p>time so I wasn&rsquo;t quite graduated so I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t quite do that anyway um but the</p>
<p>cool part was every two weeks you go on</p>
<p>the job training right and they knew I</p>
<p>was in school so at that point there</p>
<p>they pulled me right into the hospital</p>
<p>yeah and I was working on patients and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even have a license yeah I&rsquo;d work</p>
<p>on people and they were like wow that</p>
<p>really felt great because I started</p>
<p>teaching in school I was like teaching</p>
<p>students how to manipulate you know just</p>
<p>people so I did that for a while and</p>
<p>they were really pissed off in the other</p>
<p>division because I was supposed to do</p>
<p>like the medic training stuff and I got</p>
<p>pulled into the office started hanging</p>
<p>out with the officers and playing tennis</p>
<p>with the commander in the hall that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome so that was fun they have it to</p>
<p>me did it really yes so I I try for</p>
<p>Special Forces all these times I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make it so I got reassigned to different</p>
<p>jobs right and I got moved to this job</p>
<p>called personal recovery missions and</p>
<p>then I was working in a nuclear missile</p>
<p>silo in Italy doing this job where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to be a Chief Warrant Officer</p>
<p>four or five it&rsquo;s like like the highest</p>
<p>ranking chief warrant officers rather</p>
<p>than an officer of like a major or above</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a feel great position I was a</p>
<p>staff sergeant going to this school for</p>
<p>program management and directing and</p>
<p>then I go back to Italy and then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when Katherine Phillips is going down</p>
<p>the whole thing with a smiley pirates of</p>
<p>the motion stuff yeah so I&rsquo;m like then</p>
<p>years later I get blown up and</p>
<p>I see a commercial like well part of</p>
<p>that you were part of that cool Wow yeah</p>
<p>incredible yeah as I said the hey you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like hey you&rsquo;re going to do it hey yeah</p>
<p>so so so give me a little background</p>
<p>before this happened you were um you</p>
<p>were basically over and Afghanistan and</p>
<p>the other basically you&rsquo;d went this is</p>
<p>the third time or second time it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>infantry squad leader leading guys in on</p>
<p>patrols after four months of fighting</p>
<p>our unit became combat ineffective</p>
<p>meaning that we couldn&rsquo;t go on patrols</p>
<p>anymore we lost too many people so crazy</p>
<p>interest because of the the mines that</p>
<p>were yeah the four or five IEDs a day</p>
<p>good five enemy of mine sweepers and we</p>
<p>would still have guys getting blown up</p>
<p>the Taliban got so clever they started</p>
<p>developing IEDs with nonmetallic</p>
<p>initiation devices so you cannot know</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s so dirty that is that is</p>
<p>terrible they&rsquo;re pretty slick yeah so so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re going out its last time</p>
<p>and you did you have it you have any</p>
<p>warning or anything or any knowledge or</p>
<p>I definitely had a weird feeling good we</p>
<p>were premonition like there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that was like there&rsquo;s something nothing</p>
<p>out right and then will you by yourself</p>
<p>I know I was with my squad I was with my</p>
<p>squad I was walking the line to make</p>
<p>sure they were in the right positions</p>
<p>yeah and then is the third walk back</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nice it by yourself or yeah the</p>
<p>group I was by myself just to make sure</p>
<p>my guys were in the right places and</p>
<p>then as when I got Lana</p>
<p>so was it what was this was it just like</p>
<p>a massive confusion like right away like</p>
<p>happening oh so great remember</p>
<p>everything you do I was so fit back then</p>
<p>house like six feet tall 245 pounds bent</p>
<p>around with 400 pounds like super tough</p>
<p>bandits 405 almost yeah that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>mass</p>
<p>Wow so when I got blown up I knew</p>
<p>exactly what happened and I&rsquo;m like land</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like oh my god blown up I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to sit up and I was like looking through</p>
<p>my arm and I could just see like the</p>
<p>bones yeah I&rsquo;m like yes right no pain</p>
<p>all the nerve endings completely go home</p>
<p>so I didn&rsquo;t feel anything and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so surreal that blood coming out no</p>
<p>it was on my arm what</p>
<p>like more charred okay put my legs it</p>
<p>was really bad I had femoral bleeding</p>
<p>and it was shooting all over the place</p>
<p>and my I don&rsquo;t think people are when we</p>
<p>go into detail about it&rsquo;s that yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty great isn&rsquo;t it look it was bad</p>
<p>yeah yeah this this book right here I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna put a link down below so basically</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re laying there obviously</p>
<p>they came and put a tourniquet or</p>
<p>something to stop tourniquets 8 you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna cut and the guy slid his hand</p>
<p>inside of my abdomen to pack with combat</p>
<p>Goss the public clock and then they</p>
<p>picked me up and because of the</p>
<p>explosion it&rsquo;s split my pelvis openly</p>
<p>bicep 5 centimeters so I could feel</p>
<p>everything moving when they&rsquo;re like I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t pain my last name is pain yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah because there&rsquo;s a you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>oh my god I can&rsquo;t even imagine so then</p>
<p>so at that point did anything up of your</p>
<p>face or your no no I&rsquo;m so fortunate</p>
<p>oh just kind of I watched you to have a</p>
<p>look at the ground and I&rsquo;m like my arms</p>
<p>are like this that&rsquo;s what my arm died</p>
<p>like the brunt of the blast</p>
<p>I was camouflaging a wire because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>setting up a claymore mine it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>anti-personnel mine to cover our flank</p>
<p>so if the enemy are gonna tag on so you</p>
<p>were you&rsquo;re dismantling our claymore</p>
<p>mind we were setting it up or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>setting it I&rsquo;m setting it up yes okay so</p>
<p>we were taking icon cheddar which means</p>
<p>that we were intercepting radio</p>
<p>transmissions from the Taliban and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like we see the in there against</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re coming into attack and we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>alright guys let&rsquo;s get ready and so we</p>
<p>set up like our main fields of fire and</p>
<p>then we want to have our our flanks</p>
<p>covered and so we put this</p>
<p>anti-personnel mine but at the same time</p>
<p>we were killing dudes the day prior and</p>
<p>we were trying to blow up trees - kind</p>
<p>of like destroy the dead space so they</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t come in attack our base and</p>
<p>that was the last patrol so we I think</p>
<p>they knew what we were gonna do so then</p>
<p>I prior they went out there and buried a</p>
<p>bomb and when I was walking back and</p>
<p>forth mmm there he is</p>
<p>gloomy Wow was it was the force just</p>
<p>like this incredible pressure this</p>
<p>pushed you up yeah it was it it&rsquo;s having</p>
<p>so fast I went up and I on the ground</p>
<p>and I knew exactly what happens I saw</p>
<p>the flash</p>
<p>I could feel the pressure mm-hmm but</p>
<p>there was no paint it was really surreal</p>
<p>only when they started moving me that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when it really started to paint yeah and</p>
<p>and then at that point they brought you</p>
<p>to the hospital then you have how many</p>
<p>surgeries did you have okay so it was I</p>
<p>counted up so it was seven days worth of</p>
<p>procedures but some of the days it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>five separate procedures and that&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>like a daily routine for us 70 days so</p>
<p>seven days so they had they either put</p>
<p>you under or was it local two weeks</p>
<p>medical comatose what and then there</p>
<p>give me ketamine and I was waking up</p>
<p>from this ketamine like state and I was</p>
<p>young I don&rsquo;t like stuck in the ketamine</p>
<p>and I think how do you know what give me</p>
<p>ketamine and I was like I never was I</p>
<p>was I wasn&rsquo;t always the same so</p>
<p>basically they stopped and then I</p>
<p>started you know long story short</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like hate you want to heal it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the mind the body and the spirit you</p>
<p>know the first years all the bodily</p>
<p>surgeries and then the mental part was</p>
<p>just getting off all the medications</p>
<p>that were clogging my mind and then the</p>
<p>whole spiritual side of just like</p>
<p>looming values you know fine faith move</p>
<p>out with it Wow so you&rsquo;re on these</p>
<p>medications and obviously it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>messing up your your focus and your</p>
<p>brain probably some psychiatric drugs I</p>
<p>would imagine many yeah so they had me</p>
<p>on like three or four different types of</p>
<p>antidepressants and then antipsychotics</p>
<p>also and I asked them like why you give</p>
<p>this to me and then they won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>proactive</p>
<p>those were verbatim words or being</p>
<p>proactive I was like I don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>depressed Wow</p>
<p>yeah until you probably started taking</p>
<p>up right so you so my god so you had</p>
<p>major probably rehab the whole thing did</p>
<p>you kind of did you get depressed at</p>
<p>that time from the site remission okay</p>
<p>so after I retired I took took the step</p>
<p>back and really serve right now</p>
<p>everything I went through and I just</p>
<p>realized that when I started weaning</p>
<p>myself off medications that&rsquo;s when I</p>
<p>became suicidal mmm and I didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>live anymore I started while my field</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s where adaptive sports</p>
<p>and beauty pure mentorship really came</p>
<p>in or guys like keep on going come on</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s keep on doing this and it was a</p>
<p>huge motivation where it&rsquo;s you know the</p>
<p>whole support network really comes into</p>
<p>play right yeah yes so so then these</p>
<p>other guys that are competing in sports</p>
<p>and things and you in at that time you</p>
<p>probably you&rsquo;re probably in bed for I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how long I mean you&rsquo;re or not</p>
<p>physically probably lost some of your</p>
<p>strength you know oh man how did it I</p>
<p>was like 245 pounds of just like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lean mean fighting machine down to</p>
<p>nothing I was like a Holocaust patient</p>
<p>because like when I woke up I was</p>
<p>looking at like like what happened and</p>
<p>the daughters like your whole body</p>
<p>absorbed everything</p>
<p>how are you to live he&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lucky to be live man and interest</p>
<p>yeah and then and then it took about a</p>
<p>year and I just guess extremely obese</p>
<p>really extremely up like suit I like 200</p>
<p>pounds no legs</p>
<p>my other wheelchair was it was like I</p>
<p>think is like 34 inches wide it was huge</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it just from the C part not</p>
<p>now the wheels and then my doctors just</p>
<p>kept on I guess come on let&rsquo;s got more</p>
<p>and more more medications and then it</p>
<p>got to the point where I was like down</p>
<p>with it so there was something that just</p>
<p>collect it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s it I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>yeah and then that&rsquo;s when I was like</p>
<p>forgot who I was I was like I was a I</p>
<p>was a paratrooper I was like I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>back on my old mentality doing this</p>
<p>right now right yeah awesome so then you</p>
<p>you started to you know do start</p>
<p>searching stuff on on the net YouTube</p>
<p>and stuff and you started to see you</p>
<p>stumble on keto yeah so it was all about</p>
<p>eating clean they start with non-gmo</p>
<p>Vosges like so so that&rsquo;s what I learned</p>
<p>eating clean and then I started like</p>
<p>okay so how can I get better and eating</p>
<p>clean and then that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>okay you wear this you get rid of all</p>
<p>the processed carbs more vegetables</p>
<p>clean your meats</p>
<p>cut pork out start eating chicken fish</p>
<p>not as much beef and stuff as I used to</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s Atreyu lighter foods let</p>
<p>on digestive system and just be you know</p>
<p>I want to be a lean mean fighting</p>
<p>machine</p>
<p>rolling on wheels because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>normally when you go to the mess</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they have is high-quality</p>
<p>food that you&rsquo;re eating now I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>kidding</p>
<p>they have a lot of cars right a lot of</p>
<p>cars a lot of cars so so you started to</p>
<p>eat healthy and then did you see this</p>
<p>thing keydown like what is Keita what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this Keita thing y-yeah yeah I was like</p>
<p>I was turned on to it I saw his guys</p>
<p>super ripped and I was like man I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>chunky like I hate this and then there</p>
<p>was like that Kido crash where you like</p>
<p>you had just get through it and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re and then you&rsquo;re in it that was</p>
<p>the biggest struggle right there yeah</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re adapting to fat-burning</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like and so you had to adapt and</p>
<p>you start doing it you got some benefit</p>
<p>and then what happened mentally did you</p>
<p>actually have more energy mentally I was</p>
<p>on fire I was doing training for acting</p>
<p>I was performing in front of people I</p>
<p>was doing speaking engagements I was</p>
<p>traveling all over the country and then</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have it holidays cookies</p>
<p>Turkey yeah true was it was what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>uh that that tryptophan benefit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh obviously right next wristing well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so funny for those of you watching</p>
<p>tryptophan what makes you tired during</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is actually not it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the trip okay it&rsquo;s a combination of the</p>
<p>protein and the starch and the sugar all</p>
<p>that stuff you&rsquo;re gonna spike insulin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna go well you know go</p>
<p>out yeah that&rsquo;s one thing totally pay</p>
<p>attention to is like some of the foods</p>
<p>that I eat I&rsquo;ve noticed in my body we</p>
<p>just get really hot kind of like again</p>
<p>really quickly I&rsquo;m like all right when I</p>
<p>eat these foods and I started eating</p>
<p>more greens and I&rsquo;m like I noticed a</p>
<p>trend and then the apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>with a little bit of lemon juice the</p>
<p>volcano lemon juice stuff mm-hmm awesome</p>
<p>in good isn&rsquo;t it yeah love it so that</p>
<p>helped you and then so you&rsquo;re you start</p>
<p>eating healthy and then you started to</p>
<p>compete and you actually add some</p>
<p>serious successful success you had like</p>
<p>a goal adil and different competitions</p>
<p>what type of sports are they like</p>
<p>swimming races around a track around</p>
<p>well what do you know we have hand</p>
<p>cycles okay we have swimming we have</p>
<p>filled the bones we have track events</p>
<p>others archery there&rsquo;s even like a air</p>
<p>rifle type of thing the Invictus</p>
<p>Foundation they have like Samba hits</p>
<p>alien Australia</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a whole smorgasbord of</p>
<p>different Paralympic style events I did</p>
<p>swimming and cycling seated discus and</p>
<p>then the shop incredible okay so so to</p>
<p>build up your cardio with swimming I can</p>
<p>imagine like it&rsquo;s all upper body you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna you&rsquo;re gonna have some serious</p>
<p>lung action going on that&rsquo;s like yeah oh</p>
<p>man</p>
<p>yeah but the hand cranking yeah that</p>
<p>thing is awesome</p>
<p>I love it could imagine that&rsquo;s yeah so</p>
<p>so you started doing that now you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you do like you compete like all</p>
<p>over the world or okay so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple organizations Achilles</p>
<p>freedom team they take the other guys</p>
<p>that got blown up to different marathons</p>
<p>around the country and then team Semper</p>
<p>Fi is the notarization does the same</p>
<p>exact thing but we also have training</p>
<p>camps and then also other sporting</p>
<p>events that they help provide and then</p>
<p>the organization helps get us the</p>
<p>identity equipment that we need so that</p>
<p>we can go do these things off amazing</p>
<p>organization they&rsquo;re like they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>the underdog that&rsquo;s really running the</p>
<p>show of like providing stuff or a lot is</p>
<p>it that about athletes all right now Wow</p>
<p>yeah so now what happens when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing these high intense type activities</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on keto you mentioned this</p>
<p>already before let&rsquo;s just kind of talk</p>
<p>about it you don&rsquo;t quite have the</p>
<p>endurance or you drive okay yes so I</p>
<p>have an amazing workout I feel really</p>
<p>good but it&rsquo;d be shorter and I would</p>
<p>only have to do it three times a week</p>
<p>but my energy wasn&rsquo;t like how I was</p>
<p>before when I was eating carbs you know</p>
<p>food I could just go and go and go but</p>
<p>then I would crash later and just be</p>
<p>completely like done or like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>long for your time but then I can just</p>
<p>continue to work out every single day</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t I just need a fine-tune my</p>
<p>diet a little bit more I think it out</p>
<p>okay so there&rsquo;s a couple things I want</p>
<p>to bring up just on that point just to</p>
<p>help you so what what you have going on</p>
<p>is you have the mitochondria that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>energy Factory that&rsquo;s where all your</p>
<p>energy is produced so you have the food</p>
<p>that goes in there and then</p>
<p>converts to your energy which is called</p>
<p>ATP that&rsquo;s how you get your energy</p>
<p>currency of your body right now you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>adapted to Kido and then also you do the</p>
<p>same thing and then you might kind of</p>
<p>like putter out a little bit the spark</p>
<p>plug that helps ignite the fuel</p>
<p>especially the fat fuel yeah is vitamin</p>
<p>b1 yo in magnesium babies okay so I have</p>
<p>a I have something that&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>mitochondria support I&rsquo;m gonna actually</p>
<p>send you some sweet I wish I had it here</p>
<p>I may have it here I&rsquo;m gonna send you</p>
<p>some and then I want to actually see how</p>
<p>it helps your energy okay because you</p>
<p>get your fatigue could be coming from</p>
<p>you just need a little bit more spark</p>
<p>plug to ignite this fuel a little bit</p>
<p>more especially since you&rsquo;re running on</p>
<p>fat like why isn&rsquo;t it being burned is it</p>
<p>a spark plug problem what happens</p>
<p>sometimes you have to add more you know</p>
<p>different types of fuel but there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of an unknown territory right now</p>
<p>with more time we&rsquo;ll know more about</p>
<p>certain types of athletes and</p>
<p>performance however there are quite a</p>
<p>few high-intensity athletes that are</p>
<p>really strict and they finally got their</p>
<p>bodies to burn the fat but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of doing it sort of you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>consistent and I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your situation but you will find that</p>
<p>like even if you go off of it once a</p>
<p>month it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s really hard to get</p>
<p>through it that&rsquo;s what it is it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>those cheat days yeah that&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>what it is yeah because it&rsquo;s like your</p>
<p>body will then start going back to this</p>
<p>other way like wait a second so and you</p>
<p>might think it&rsquo;s might be a little thing</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s it could last a long time so</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>cheating like once a week you&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>much never gonna wholly burn that just</p>
<p>reminded me because uh all right now now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing it because I was on heel for</p>
<p>a while and then I had that break from</p>
<p>the holidays and then I finally got back</p>
<p>on it I remember when I was traveling</p>
<p>and just riding the marathon so I was</p>
<p>the only keto nothing else and then that</p>
<p>I was going nonstop on the marathons so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is then you just brought</p>
<p>it yeah totally</p>
<p>alright yeah I think that I&rsquo;m a cheater</p>
<p>I think you have brought your</p>
<p>you change any steps you yeah exactly</p>
<p>the the thing is like I think you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have the unfair advantage of course</p>
<p>hopefully none of your competitors are</p>
<p>watching this right now</p>
<p>but if you could run on fat fuel only</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll actually fat fuel is very</p>
<p>different it has more than double the</p>
<p>energy so you could basically it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>efficient fuel so these guys run on</p>
<p>glucose they&rsquo;re gonna run at a gas so</p>
<p>fast and they&rsquo;re gonna hit hit this wall</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have a buildup of</p>
<p>lactic acid so I think you you you could</p>
<p>actually out you know just have better</p>
<p>endurance if you actually do that and it</p>
<p>may be like when you&rsquo;re off season maybe</p>
<p>if you wanted to do a cheat day but when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a training like if you just a</p>
<p>hardcore you&rsquo;ll be really hard how</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be good yeah I mean I&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>I was telling you before about it but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting a new training regiment</p>
<p>next week on Monday oh yeah with a</p>
<p>trainer and we&rsquo;re going to what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>mapping out a whole plant and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna document it - oh that&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>awesome so it&rsquo;s me bit body building</p>
<p>more body oh wow yeah awesome and then</p>
<p>you also brought up another point that I</p>
<p>think is a common problem when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing them in the fasting so here you</p>
<p>are like you want to compete but you</p>
<p>feel better when you don&rsquo;t eat I think</p>
<p>then when you eat I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>right yeah think about that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really hungry I&rsquo;m never really</p>
<p>hungry I mean I can just write and then</p>
<p>I just like okay well you know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even eat a lot like a lot of vegetables</p>
<p>so I go to Whole Foods and just riding</p>
<p>mountain of vegetables Wow and then that</p>
<p>do you feel better or worse when you eat</p>
<p>I feel great oh okay a little tired a</p>
<p>little bit afterwards yeah and then but</p>
<p>you know I feel better probably but an</p>
<p>hour later okay yeah okay yeah I know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of weird like um once you get</p>
<p>into this it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s what this whole</p>
<p>food thing is like Wow</p>
<p>no I ate I know I was feeling good one</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t eat but then she got to eat</p>
<p>you know and then you&rsquo;re have you found</p>
<p>that your muscle density or your you are</p>
<p>you trying to bulk up with muscle or is</p>
<p>that not English</p>
<p>everyone I feel I just feel great I feel</p>
<p>great all the time</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s like do what are you doing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like well I&rsquo;m actually a work I work</p>
<p>out less I eat us and</p>
<p>just you know you know I&rsquo;m staying</p>
<p>productive like how you doing I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>well ketosis and like you can watch Erik</p>
<p>Berg on YouTube there you can go on that</p>
<p>guy</p>
<p>check that guy out be honest oh cool</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s great so for those of you</p>
<p>that are athletes</p>
<p>the secret is just to stay consistent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing and then the b1</p>
<p>magnesium is another little tip there</p>
<p>and that will help you especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like if you drink coffee or tea</p>
<p>whatever you need a little bit more b1</p>
<p>and if you and the more carbs that you</p>
<p>consume if you don&rsquo;t do b1 you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to just you&rsquo;re not going to have that</p>
<p>endurance so b1 will also help your</p>
<p>cognitive function your endurance and</p>
<p>then let me just take a call here from</p>
<p>Milla from the Netherlands she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>waiting or he&rsquo;s been waiting for 19</p>
<p>minutes are you there</p>
<p>she sorry hi can you hear me so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty short question actually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about for trace minerals so I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>prescribed trace minerals from the brand</p>
<p>chemical trees which is which are salt</p>
<p>base minerals what I would like to</p>
<p>switch to your minerals because their</p>
<p>plan base and therefore a more</p>
<p>bioavailable what I would look like to</p>
<p>know if there&rsquo;s any information about</p>
<p>the amount of any of those trace</p>
<p>minerals that&rsquo;s present in Wow let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>one serving yeah I think there&rsquo;s if you</p>
<p>go to my site there&rsquo;s an FAQ on there</p>
<p>that you can see the amount of trace</p>
<p>minerals trace minerals are minerals</p>
<p>needed in smaller amounts and like</p>
<p>selenium iodine versus calcium magnesium</p>
<p>things like that but if you&rsquo;re taking a</p>
<p>plant-based mineral a plant basically</p>
<p>reaches down with the roots pulls up the</p>
<p>mineral the rocks and converts into a</p>
<p>plant-based mineral so the type of</p>
<p>minerals that I have are prehistoric</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually 70 million years old</p>
<p>yeah take it from the earth a layer of</p>
<p>the earth where they had all this</p>
<p>prehistoric plant food back then and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I get the minerals and</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re very easy to digest their</p>
<p>15,000 times smaller than regular</p>
<p>minerals so they go in a hundred percent</p>
<p>versus some of the other minerals do how</p>
<p>much do you need you don&rsquo;t need much</p>
<p>maybe a half a dropper full per day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you need but the you may not</p>
<p>feel energy from them they&rsquo;re more for</p>
<p>enzymes and supply enzymes to make</p>
<p>protein so your nails your hair your</p>
<p>skin your muscles in fact if a pregnant</p>
<p>woman is deficient in a trace mineral</p>
<p>that future child is gonna have so many</p>
<p>problems structurally with their spine</p>
<p>they might have abnormal that scoliosis</p>
<p>flat feed teeth problems their overbite</p>
<p>underbite so we need these trace</p>
<p>minerals for proteins thanks for your</p>
<p>question all right let&rsquo;s see here we</p>
<p>have we have our Facebook Kido lab I up</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just see if there&rsquo;s any good</p>
<p>questions no it&rsquo;s going yes Kido would</p>
<p>be better for our military I I think um</p>
<p>just there&rsquo;s a lot of military that are</p>
<p>doing Kido you should see the Special</p>
<p>Forces cafeterias like so you know</p>
<p>Special Operations they have every when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about like oh it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>good food you you know that guy&rsquo;s a joke</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like yeah because Regular Army units</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have good food that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>when you go to the Special Operations</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s the best really crime like</p>
<p>really thing I didn&rsquo;t know that they</p>
<p>feed you like you would not Bob that is</p>
<p>so great</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome that was so good well I</p>
<p>never made it there I was actually</p>
<p>enough different deficient I just went</p>
<p>for the hood absolutely there&rsquo;s a by my</p>
<p>house there is a huge facility of to I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the seal training they have</p>
<p>this building it goes on for like miles</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know what they do in there</p>
<p>at this confidential but yeah it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>water training and it&rsquo;s a Maryland yeah</p>
<p>so I want to go scuba diving</p>
<p>are you diving you know I did it once I</p>
<p>want to get into it but I think I just</p>
<p>have you know</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done it are you into it yeah</p>
<p>yeah there is an organization called</p>
<p>such service members undergoing to say</p>
<p>it was good having been to Cuba Hawaii</p>
<p>and the ABC islands a curse out of</p>
<p>course oh wow yeah world means beautiful</p>
<p>there oh that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>our military tow and IAF would be</p>
<p>unstoppable</p>
<p>that would be give everyone the unfair</p>
<p>advantage I just remember like in basic</p>
<p>training just eating a lot of carbs and</p>
<p>sugar let&rsquo;s see here okay good mary says</p>
<p>thank you so much for your service you</p>
<p>are an incredible inspiration hey Mary</p>
<p>thanks I&rsquo;m only half the inspiration you</p>
<p>be God</p>
<p>well you know this guy has a very light</p>
<p>attitude about it which is exactly how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very good to survive and the six</p>
<p>most successful people that I know are</p>
<p>very carefree and I guess the word for</p>
<p>it is called insouciant which is like</p>
<p>not serious because you&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like the people that are</p>
<p>not so serious and salad they do be</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more successful things go right</p>
<p>for them you know so you know I learned</p>
<p>what I learned the more I was pushing on</p>
<p>my comfort zone the more I grew exactly</p>
<p>exactly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like and once I&rsquo;ve realized that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like huh I was like I best I better</p>
<p>get it uncomfortable all the time right</p>
<p>right there it goes out there yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s yeah that&rsquo;s great yeah one time I</p>
<p>had to give a speech in front of 500</p>
<p>people this is when I was serious fear</p>
<p>of public speaking</p>
<p>mm-hmm and so I get up there and I just</p>
<p>completely froze and it was the most</p>
<p>embarrassing thing so I decided at that</p>
<p>point I gotta handle this so I started</p>
<p>doing seminars around the this area and</p>
<p>I did 4700 seminars in a row Wow oh man</p>
<p>how do you yeah see I&rsquo;m messin I need to</p>
<p>learn how I can schedule that three</p>
<p>times a week</p>
<p>well I actually put myself in the</p>
<p>situation where I started booking</p>
<p>seminars to all the governmental</p>
<p>agencies and then I go well why don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>just do like a series of 12 Wow and so</p>
<p>it forced me to you know really you know</p>
<p>get out there so I was like all over the</p>
<p>place all that long you&rsquo;re stuck at the</p>
<p>milled like anti-age right yeah oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah cool an edge all the different</p>
<p>agencies FBI I was there and so that was</p>
<p>awesome and also guys I&rsquo;m gonna put his</p>
<p>link down below of his website</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s chosen leadership calm and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some other other ones as well this is a</p>
<p>great website that really is this</p>
<p>amazing story and I mean it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what you&rsquo;ve been through and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re able to still be able to</p>
<p>talk about it freely without kind of I</p>
<p>mean just lame you just that your</p>
<p>attitude is just so positive it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible yeah I mean I thought about</p>
<p>the the chosen leadership first you can</p>
<p>so in the Army we have we had seven</p>
<p>Corps Army Values loyalty Duty respect</p>
<p>selfless service honor integrity and</p>
<p>personal courage seven core army values</p>
<p>that illustrate the acronym leadership</p>
<p>providing purpose direction and</p>
<p>motivation that&rsquo;s what we learn in basic</p>
<p>training as like a private and so after</p>
<p>all these bad things happen what I all</p>
<p>at what I had to do was just go right</p>
<p>back to the source what I learned and be</p>
<p>like okay this is what I need to do is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna adapt and overcome I want to</p>
<p>push forward if I&rsquo;m not adhering to</p>
<p>these values then obviously I&rsquo;m off the</p>
<p>course I gotta get back on that course</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just television well I have a</p>
<p>question about that so usually when</p>
<p>someone has a tragic thing in their life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we think it&rsquo;s like all over</p>
<p>but do you feel that if you didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>this they would is this like you like</p>
<p>helping people right like yeah go around</p>
<p>the country and you motivate people</p>
<p>right I try to and have you found that</p>
<p>you just like your whole shift in</p>
<p>purpose shift it to like like helping</p>
<p>more people what we had no idea is gonna</p>
<p>do this kind of fell into it yeah I mean</p>
<p>you know you live through all these</p>
<p>things go through all these tough times</p>
<p>but that struggle though you see people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t make it if people have died</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s like yeah I was gonna go</p>
<p>to school bioengineering</p>
<p>stem cell research a firm Armed Forces</p>
<p>Institute or genitive medicine was it</p>
<p>winston-salem yeah Wake Forest</p>
<p>University</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a Anthony atella is like the</p>
<p>head honcho running the show so I was</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m gonna go to school for that as</p>
<p>I want to do and so I had all this huge</p>
<p>plan within my brother-in-law</p>
<p>I was so close with the end of dying</p>
<p>that seemed a retired changed everything</p>
<p>and then I started writing and then I</p>
<p>had a front break himself and like you</p>
<p>know what I&rsquo;m gonna focus on trying to</p>
<p>help inspire guys instead and and then I</p>
<p>started writing you know the movie</p>
<p>American sniper came out that was</p>
<p>another motivation - yeah yeah so I</p>
<p>think helps at the same time and can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you give push not here talking with the</p>
<p>Kido master ninja you better recognize</p>
<p>realizing you know so yeah so basically</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re because I think the you know</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;d never you would never do</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing if this doesn&rsquo;t if</p>
<p>certain things didn&rsquo;t happen like in</p>
<p>your life all of a sudden like I just</p>
<p>push you in a direction that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>probably never in a million years think</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be doing you wouldn&rsquo;t be like</p>
<p>driving around the country you know</p>
<p>doing yeah but it&rsquo;s fun though I love it</p>
<p>I bet I got a big Sprinter van I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>always cruising I saw that there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>stuff that is a seriously nice mobile</p>
<p>and home right and it has yeah it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>yeah I could just I&rsquo;m almost done</p>
<p>converting a converted myself you did</p>
<p>everything on my own yeah I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible yeah right I saw it parked</p>
<p>out I&rsquo;m like what the heck is four-wheel</p>
<p>drive jeez Wow</p>
<p>awesome thanks so you so you go around</p>
<p>the country though and you you do you</p>
<p>talk I mean you talk to people right I</p>
<p>mean yes so basically um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>multi-platform so faith-based high</p>
<p>schools middle schools colleges special</p>
<p>operations I talked to one of the SEAL</p>
<p>Teams when I talk to combat forces I</p>
<p>always talk about guarding the heart and</p>
<p>that ties into scriptures and stuff like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>but you know it&rsquo;s really great and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all about seem motivated through the</p>
<p>tribulation because right it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>always gonna have that rocky life bad</p>
<p>things roars gonna happen push forward</p>
<p>for that legacy because that legacies at</p>
<p>the end uh at a time</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s awesome that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna take a call from AG Fremont</p>
<p>California are you there yes dr. Berg my</p>
<p>question is how do you truly know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fat adapted I&rsquo;ve been on keto for</p>
<p>the last since September 1st 2018 mm-hmm</p>
<p>I lost about 57 58 pounds I&rsquo;m no longer</p>
<p>craving anything I eat just to keep my</p>
<p>glucose level okay but sometimes I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel like eating anything sometimes I</p>
<p>eat a little bit how do you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>truly fat adapted well you just set it</p>
<p>right there you&rsquo;re not hungry when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not hungry</p>
<p>that means your body is eating your fat</p>
<p>and that means you&rsquo;re adapted to fat as</p>
<p>a fuel if you can&rsquo;t go for more than a</p>
<p>period of time without getting hungry</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not in bad adaptation that</p>
<p>make sense yeah it does I had one more</p>
<p>other question I have a daughter who has</p>
<p>sinus problems and we&rsquo;ve taken her to</p>
<p>the doctor and she just has migraine</p>
<p>headaches and sinus it just bugs her</p>
<p>medication doesn&rsquo;t really help</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve tried homeopathic stuff it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird that a lot of stuff is not</p>
<p>working what do you recommend so how old</p>
<p>is your daughter brain freeze</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a nice girl she&rsquo;s about 14 okay 14</p>
<p>because people usually ask ask these</p>
<p>questions about themselves but no I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just kidding</p>
<p>so you she&rsquo;s 14 and then the next</p>
<p>question is is she doing cute or now she</p>
<p>had like a regular diet no she&rsquo;s not not</p>
<p>doing keto she&rsquo;s well you know</p>
<p>proportioned she&rsquo;s not overweight she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not underweight it&rsquo;s just a sinus you</p>
<p>know it just brings her down she&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>migraines she throws up sometimes and</p>
<p>this she had all year-round or seasonal</p>
<p>all year-round</p>
<p>yeah so this is not everyday but yeah</p>
<p>this is usually more like a fungus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s growing or some type of yeast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s growing in the sinuses that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually what it is and you can do</p>
<p>different remedies it doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>work until the person fixes the core</p>
<p>eating plan a lot of people think that</p>
<p>keto is just for overweight people it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for everyone a 14-year old if they did</p>
<p>it now if they did a version of this</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say she had just three meals a day</p>
<p>and just shift taquito and no snacks</p>
<p>little happened his inflammation goes</p>
<p>down the bacteria goes down in the body</p>
<p>yeast will start going down and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see a lot of things clear up so I would</p>
<p>work on her core eating and of course</p>
<p>avoid milk and because the sugars are</p>
<p>speeding this fungus and then I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s remedies nasal rinses in garlic</p>
<p>but you really need to change the</p>
<p>foundation of what she&rsquo;s eating okay all</p>
<p>right thanks for your call</p>
<p>and let me just see if there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>really good questions here versus no I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just kidding been struggling from</p>
<p>diabetes for a few years nothing made</p>
<p>sense not overweight finally figured out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s autoimmune any tips be helpful keto</p>
<p>for a for a year blood sugar runs over</p>
<p>200 had to start insulin now not sure</p>
<p>what to do so I&rsquo;m gonna give this</p>
<p>question to you so basically yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>suffering from diabetes well here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>autoimmune autoimmune I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what your autoimmune - but I would</p>
<p>honestly these questions like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even want to give you a remedy because I</p>
<p>want to make sure you&rsquo;re doing hardcore</p>
<p>healthy keto and it comes back to these</p>
