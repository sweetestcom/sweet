<p>very very good question</p>
<p>um and that would be</p>
<p>um electrolytes i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>um and magnesium</p>
<p>and even calcium and sodium you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>retain potassium and magnesium for a</p>
<p>long time</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re going into a fast without</p>
<p>these nutrients um</p>
<p>you can be end up with a deficiency and</p>
<p>you feel real dizzy and things like that</p>
<p>and even sea salt too like that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>always recommend</p>
<p>sea salt electrolytes and then</p>
<p>a good electrolyte blend would be great</p>
<p>the other thing that you need is b</p>
<p>vitamins</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t retain some of these b</p>
<p>vitamins</p>
<p>very long either and you need to b</p>
<p>vitamins</p>
<p>as you do keto and definitely fasting as</p>
<p>well because you&rsquo;re burning more fat you</p>
<p>require more b</p>
<p>vitamins so those two are really</p>
<p>important and then</p>
<p>if you could actually also add in trace</p>
<p>minerals in there that would be</p>
<p>also a very good thing as well and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other ones as well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve talked about this in other videos</p>
<p>like omega 3 fatty acids</p>
<p>but those fats tend to</p>
<p>be stored in your fat cells a little bit</p>
<p>longer so it&rsquo;s really the water soluble</p>
<p>vitamins that you need to put back in</p>
<p>and some of the minerals that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>retain</p>
<p>like zinc for example very very</p>
<p>important i mean you retain</p>
<p>calcium pretty well and iron but not</p>
<p>these other ones</p>
<p>vitamin c is another one that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>retain for a long time too so that would</p>
<p>be another</p>
<p>good thing to take as well okay doc i</p>
<p>think you can hear each other why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you try that desiree</p>
<p>can you hear me i can hear you perfectly</p>
<p>now hi desiree</p>
<p>okay hi dr burke how are you great</p>
<p>um i heard you say electrolytes b</p>
<p>vitamins trace minerals</p>
<p>zinc and vitamin c are they what i need</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>do yes yeah</p>
<p>zinc is part of the trace minerals so if</p>
<p>you take a trace metal blend you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be covered</p>
<p>and then vitamin c as well but just make</p>
<p>sure with your vitamin c it&rsquo;s a food</p>
<p>based</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like a synthetic version</p>
<p>because you want the whole complex</p>
<p>and even if i&rsquo;m diabetic right i was</p>
<p>need all of this especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>diabetic because</p>
<p>um you you&rsquo;re always gonna you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>go into this</p>
<p>um with insulin resistance which means</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna need more nutrients to</p>
<p>penetrate that resistance because</p>
<p>insulin is required for absorption of a</p>
<p>lot of these nutrients</p>
<p>so i think what i would do as well if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re diabetic is find my video</p>
<p>on this topic</p>
<p>and watch that because it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>more in detail for someone like you i</p>
<p>think that can help you</p>
<p>okay can i actually one quick question</p>
<p>accurately</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking your essential 80 central</p>
<p>amino acids</p>
<p>and before i started taking them i had</p>
<p>one grey hair in the front of my head</p>
<p>i took them from and it literally and i</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t it disappeared</p>
<p>i st and i i was stored so i stopped to</p>
<p>them just to</p>
<p>try to experiment and now it haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taken them about a month</p>
<p>and now the one here is back is is it</p>
<p>possible that one of</p>
<p>the eight essentials controls like hair</p>
<p>grains</p>
<p>oh well think about what your hair is</p>
<p>made out of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>made out of amino acids so there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a product i have it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called keto aminos it&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>essential amino acids</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s good for a lot of different</p>
<p>things what&rsquo;s unique about it is that</p>
<p>you you absorb like 99 of it compared to</p>
<p>other protein</p>
<p>you would only absorb like 50 but this</p>
<p>is not a protein it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s individual amino acids so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of digestion it goes</p>
<p>right in like a rocket ship</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really good for people that are</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>also if they&rsquo;re trying to build muscle</p>
<p>and also if they&rsquo;re athletes</p>
<p>and for other things too metabolic</p>
<p>processes if they&rsquo;re gastric bypass</p>
<p>if they even like you you&rsquo;re a diabetic</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to absorb</p>
<p>amino acids as well so this will just</p>
<p>give you the amino acids</p>
<p>drive it right into the tissues and</p>
<p>think about how many different</p>
<p>bile</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good source i consume</p>
<p>cheese on a regular basis</p>
<p>just make sure it&rsquo;s organic and</p>
<p>grass-fed and also sheep cheese and goat</p>
<p>cheese would be even better</p>
<p>but i wouldn&rsquo;t take i would not get your</p>
<p>calcium primarily from a supplement</p>
<p>um just because i mean</p>
<p>if you find a good good source but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do the calcium carbonate</p>
<p>and i just don&rsquo;t recommend taking</p>
<p>calcium as a supplement at all</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very hard to die</p>
<p>absorb that get it from you get your</p>
<p>calcium from your food</p>
<p>from dairy you can also get some calcium</p>
<p>from leafy greens</p>
<p>but i would never take calcium as a</p>
<p>standalone vitamin</p>
<p>especially calcium carbonate which is</p>
<p>actually in most multivitamin minerals</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it just creates a lot of issues actually</p>
<p>even for women there&rsquo;s some studies that</p>
<p>will increase the chance of getting a</p>
<p>heart attack</p>
<p>so um calcium and iron for example</p>
<p>are two minerals that our body tends to</p>
<p>retain</p>
<p>more than other minerals</p>
<p>thank you very much dr bill you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome thanks for your call doc by the</p>
<p>way we lost your camera but we do have</p>
<p>our little remote live</p>
<p>uh icon up so we&rsquo;re still going on with</p>
<p>the show and maybe you can charge that</p>
<p>but in the meantime</p>
<p>everything is fine you can go on with</p>
<p>the phone calls etc</p>
<p>and the questions when you&rsquo;re ready okay</p>
<p>so can you see me with my backup camera</p>
<p>i have a backup camera we&rsquo;ll try that it</p>
<p>might it may work</p>
<p>we do have it yeah we have you it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll kind of adjust the way</p>
<p>it looks a little bit but you&rsquo;re back</p>
<p>with us so that&rsquo;s great doc</p>
<p>okay um it&rsquo;s the thing about my cameras</p>
<p>i have to</p>
<p>somehow i have to recharge it the way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hooked up so i have to figure that</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>hey bob um you&rsquo;ve been waiting patiently</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>you wanted to follow up on your bloating</p>
<p>and fluid retention are you there bob</p>
<p>stand by doc hello</p>
<p>hello bob hi yes hi thank you very much</p>
<p>for taking my call again i appreciate it</p>
<p>sure um yes following up</p>
<p>uh i have to say for just one week it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>much improved</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very very pleased with the way that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been going</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve tried to implement all the things</p>
<p>that you told me as far as eating just</p>
<p>one time a day</p>
<p>cutting way back on the vegetables</p>
<p>really i&rsquo;m not having any vegetables</p>
<p>right now but i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;ve gone down almost</p>
<p>four pounds since we last</p>
<p>spoke last friday so it really shows you</p>
<p>know that the fluids and the bloating</p>
<p>has as much reduced um</p>
<p>i was just wondering though how long it</p>
<p>takes to clear up</p>
<p>sibo for one thing and when i can start</p>
<p>having vegetables again how much would</p>
<p>you recommend that i have at that time</p>
<p>yeah i think i would give it two months</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>if you have sibo you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>really start</p>
<p>taking more things like a betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride which is an acidifier that</p>
<p>will start to</p>
<p>add more acid to the stomach because you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want any microbes going through</p>
<p>that stomach most</p>
<p>a lot of people over the age of 50 have</p>
<p>low stomach acids and that&rsquo;s really what</p>
<p>triggers the whole thing it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>causes it&rsquo;s not everything but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>contributes the other thing that can</p>
<p>help you reduce sibo is</p>
<p>purify bile salts taking that because</p>
<p>bile cells help</p>
<p>as a secondary function to kill off</p>
<p>microbes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a detergent and throughout the</p>
<p>small intestine that will speed things</p>
<p>up</p>
<p>greatly and then when you start to</p>
<p>introduce the leafy greens</p>
<p>um you know just do one cup per day and</p>
<p>see how that goes and then maybe add to</p>
<p>two and three and four</p>
<p>these the the benefit of the fiber is</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>give you short chain fatty acids which</p>
<p>actually really</p>
<p>really important in a lot of different</p>
<p>things and also</p>
<p>feel the colon cells they&rsquo;ll actually</p>
<p>give the colon cells</p>
<p>energy as well and so that would be one</p>
<p>thing to help you um but that&rsquo;s great so</p>
<p>we know</p>
<p>that this is the thing that&rsquo;s uh you</p>
<p>need so we&rsquo;re on the right track</p>
<p>and um give it another couple months in</p>
<p>the meantime</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re kind of like a</p>
<p>carnivore you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>study up on how to do that correctly</p>
<p>with nutrients like you may not</p>
<p>just want to have meats you might want</p>
<p>to do definitely eggs and seafood and</p>
<p>other things to make sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>well-rounded maybe even some animal</p>
<p>organ meats as well to get all your</p>
<p>nutrients</p>
<p>excellent thank you very much you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome bob</p>
<p>all right steve we have the first</p>
<p>question let&rsquo;s do it stand by</p>
<p>okay what is the what is the</p>
<p>most difficult nutrient to get</p>
<p>in your in your diet what what nutrient</p>
<p>is the most difficult</p>
<p>to get from just eating foods that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first question</p>
<p>and as you guys chew on that question</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to go to sue had from detroit</p>
<p>that had a question relating to your</p>
<p>appetite while breastfeeding are you</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>hello hi</p>
<p>hi dr greg i have been following a</p>
<p>healthy keto</p>
<p>before getting pregnant then</p>
<p>i am breastfeeding now for 14 months</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>but i cannot control my appetite like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to push myself</p>
<p>going on keto but it&rsquo;s out of my control</p>
<p>and my friends and family consider me an</p>
<p>idol</p>
<p>for allowing healthy lifestyle but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gaining weight i should be losing</p>
<p>weight while breastfeeding</p>
<p>but i am gaining weight and i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>like quit by feeding my baby because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very essential for him</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m struggling what to do um</p>
<p>okay so i do understand you definitely</p>
<p>want to lose weight while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breastfeeding i</p>
<p>i think um you&rsquo;re right it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>important to</p>
<p>focus on the quality of breast milk</p>
<p>right now and</p>
<p>um how many meals a day are you</p>
<p>consuming</p>
<p>oh my god probably i&rsquo;m eating every two</p>
<p>hours and i&rsquo;m craving for sweets</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m going for fruit in order</p>
<p>for my breast milk to be healthy</p>
<p>the fruit yeah i think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem i think i would go back to keto</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re out of keto now which</p>
<p>means you&rsquo;re going to be hungry all the</p>
<p>time which means you&rsquo;re going to gain</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>if you do keto and provide</p>
<p>more nutrient dense keto foods</p>
<p>seafood healthier fats and make sure you</p>
<p>have all the nutrients</p>
<p>the problem that i cannot it&rsquo;s like very</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to force myself but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>painful hunger</p>
<p>right well that&rsquo;s because when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually doing</p>
<p>more carbs like fruit that&rsquo;s instantly</p>
<p>going to raise your sugar and then drop</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>and then now you&rsquo;re going to be hungry</p>
<p>very frequently</p>
<p>so yes sir but i i am like i don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>carb i don&rsquo;t eat bread or carb right</p>
<p>yes this is when i like with some</p>
<p>something pushing me supporting me</p>
<p>but i do keto and breastfeeding like i</p>
<p>success</p>
<p>for two weeks then after that i</p>
<p>just something out of my control pushing</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>like i cannot continue is that something</p>
<p>i can do</p>
<p>i think i think you uh having a baby is</p>
<p>requiring certain nutrients i would</p>
<p>i would go with more b vitamins more</p>
<p>nutritional yeast</p>
<p>and i would also take purified bile</p>
<p>salts which will help you</p>
<p>pull more nutrients out of the food that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already eating</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re just missing some</p>
<p>nutrients i would go up with the</p>
<p>nutrients if i were you</p>
<p>primarily the b vitamins</p>
<p>all right try that and let us know how</p>
<p>that works okay</p>
<p>all right steve do we have an answer</p>
<p>answers for this the hardest nutrient to</p>
<p>get from your diet</p>
<p>okay we&rsquo;re still working on that why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go to another call</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to mary mary are you there</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>hello hi mary how are you</p>
<p>great thanks thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call</p>
<p>i have a question regarding shingles</p>
<p>yes he has been dealing with the bout of</p>
<p>shingles unexpectedly and i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>tell you i&rsquo;m embarrassed to say</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 60 years old i&rsquo;m healthy i exercise</p>
<p>i supplement</p>
<p>i watch you i have holistic</p>
<p>practitioners and i</p>
<p>got the first flu shot i&rsquo;ve ever had in</p>
<p>my life</p>
<p>so i want to start there i got it on a</p>
<p>wednesday</p>
<p>september 30th i started not feeling</p>
<p>good on</p>
<p>friday uh two days later</p>
<p>and have kind of gone downhill since</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going back uphill but i developed</p>
<p>shingles</p>
<p>on my face left side of my face in my</p>
<p>left eye</p>
<p>i did watch your video um and i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>taking the</p>
<p>50 000 units of d3 and with the 500</p>
<p>mcgs of k2 and i started</p>
<p>that just this past sunday</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m wonder i&rsquo;m also taking 3 000</p>
<p>units of or milligrams of lysine</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been taking that since the onset</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m taking vitamin c i got a b12</p>
<p>shot yesterday i&rsquo;m doing everything so</p>
<p>this the uh</p>
<p>lesions have cleared up i have</p>
<p>inflammation in my</p>
<p>eye i&rsquo;ve certainly been to my</p>
<p>optimologist five times in a month</p>
<p>i just went yesterday but now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>dealing with of course the post</p>
<p>herpetic neuralgia which i know you</p>
<p>recommended the d3 and the</p>
<p>m the k2 i guess my question is if you</p>
<p>have any other recommendations or how</p>
<p>long it may take for that to kick in</p>
<p>right and i think this was a coincidence</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>vaccine right i think it is</p>
<p>yeah that hap i mean i&rsquo;ve seen this all</p>
<p>the time in practice where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>someone who gets a flu shot or something</p>
<p>all of a sudden it stirs up</p>
<p>a hornet&rsquo;s nest and</p>
<p>unfortunately now we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>backtrack so</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s one thing that they do put in</p>
<p>vaccines now</p>
<p>which is the aluminum which it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>an</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s basically something to</p>
<p>enhance the immune reaction</p>
<p>so one thing you can do</p>
<p>um yes</p>
<p>hello you can hello hi can you hear me</p>
<p>oh yeah</p>
<p>you cut out there for a minute okay</p>
<p>silica</p>
<p>silica is something you can start taking</p>
<p>that binds with aluminum that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing you can take to</p>
<p>if that is going if that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>creating a problem but</p>
<p>i think the thing that you need to do is</p>
<p>calm down the immune system with more</p>
<p>vitamin d and more fasting</p>
<p>prolonged fasting to help repair this</p>
<p>damage that this has created and just</p>
<p>kind of let it go through its process</p>
<p>because once the immune system is like</p>
<p>activating</p>
<p>some dormant virus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>stop it because you&rsquo;re in a full-blown</p>
<p>immune system and an immune reaction</p>
<p>then you</p>
<p>just have to let it go through the</p>
<p>process but to speed it up</p>
<p>vitamin d will calm things down and i</p>
<p>would probably even go up to 50 000 ius</p>
<p>every day</p>
<p>and i would do some more fasting those</p>
<p>are the two things</p>
<p>really that you need to do and then try</p>
<p>to reduce stress as much as possible</p>
<p>i know some people that get poison ivy</p>
<p>a lot and uh and once they get it</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re highly allergic um</p>
<p>you know one thing that they can do is</p>
<p>as well is just because they&rsquo;re in this</p>
<p>immune reaction is to take a lot of</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>and then fast and at least those two</p>
<p>actions will</p>
<p>modulate or just kind of chill out the</p>
<p>immune system because it&rsquo;s overreactive</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>zinc is something else that i would</p>
<p>definitely start to</p>
<p>beef up and it just so happens that zinc</p>
<p>is in beef so you can use that as well</p>
<p>but zinc vitamin d and fasting are your</p>
<p>three things that i would focus on right</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>okay dr berg how about some results from</p>
<p>your first question and i&rsquo;ll repeat it</p>
<p>what is the most difficult nutrient to</p>
<p>get from your diet</p>
<p>and the survey says 55 from vitamin d</p>
<p>30 b12 and 15</p>
<p>zinc what say your doctor well the</p>
<p>answer is vitamin d</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible to get the amount</p>
<p>of vitamin</p>
<p>um the from your diet that&rsquo;s why we go</p>
<p>for the sun</p>
<p>especially in the winter unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing um</p>
<p>fatty fish on a regular basis in cod</p>
<p>liver oil</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to get it and this</p>
<p>is why so many people are deficient</p>
<p>steve</p>
<p>so going forward into the winter i</p>
<p>always recommend</p>
<p>add vitamin d to your diet and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to find</p>
<p>as a supplement and cod liver oil is one</p>
<p>good source as well but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that your aches and pains</p>
<p>will be kind of chilled out a little bit</p>
<p>your low back pain won&rsquo;t be as bad um</p>
<p>your mood will be better because as you</p>
<p>go into the winter and you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>enough sun</p>
<p>boy it&rsquo;s like you get stiff low back</p>
<p>pain depression those are the three</p>
<p>big things that um occur without vitamin</p>
<p>d and there&rsquo;s many others as well and</p>
<p>you just mentioned 50</p>
<p>000 units so five of your fabulous uh</p>
<p>d3k2 so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>oh that is that&rsquo;s mainly for an immune</p>
<p>reaction</p>
<p>okay if you&rsquo;re just maintaining it you</p>
<p>just need probably</p>
<p>um and i know some of you are going to</p>
<p>say wow that&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>10 000 ius a day but</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re over the age of 45</p>
<p>if your skin is a little bit darker if</p>
<p>you have</p>
<p>weight problems all these factors</p>
<p>increase</p>
<p>majorly your need for vitamin d</p>
<p>so um personally i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m recommending</p>
<p>10 000 i use as a maintenance dosage for</p>
<p>vitamin d3 so</p>
<p>i personally take 20 um and</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re concerned about that i have</p>
<p>probably like five or six videos on</p>
<p>you know what are the side effects of</p>
<p>too much vitamin d and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>find that you would have to take</p>
<p>a lot i&rsquo;m talking hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of vitamin d for many months before it</p>
<p>becomes a problem so i wouldn&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about it too much</p>
<p>all right sounds great doc all right we</p>
<p>have some questions on</p>
<p>social media would you like to take one</p>
<p>yes i would like to take some of those</p>
<p>questions</p>
<p>okay so facebook of legia religia</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m saying that right what is the</p>
<p>best food sources for</p>
<p>vitamin b1 b1</p>
<p>yes sir okay um</p>
<p>sunflower seeds is a good source also</p>
<p>nutritional yeast is a really good</p>
<p>source</p>
<p>vitamin b1 is in a lot of different</p>
<p>foods the key with</p>
<p>b1 is to avoid things that deplete your</p>
<p>b1</p>
<p>too much caffeine as in coffee</p>
<p>or even tea tannic acid will deplete</p>
<p>your b1</p>
<p>um and of course the refined carbs will</p>
<p>definitely decrease your</p>
<p>your b1 if you&rsquo;re a diabetic and you</p>
<p>have higher sugars</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re doing more carbs then the</p>
<p>the demand for b1 goes way up</p>
<p>if you drink alcohol your demand for b1</p>
<p>goes way</p>
<p>up so</p>
<p>nutritional yeast is the best source and</p>
<p>i just would recommend</p>
<p>adding that as part of your diet but</p>
<p>sunflower seeds do have</p>
<p>b1 as well make sure that the raw ones</p>
<p>because b1 is a bit sensitive to heat</p>
<p>great thanks lucia for that question do</p>
<p>you want to kick off another question</p>
<p>or should we yes i do what is the</p>
<p>easiest</p>
<p>okay we talked about the most difficult</p>
<p>nutrient from your diet what about</p>
<p>what is the nutrient that&rsquo;s the easiest</p>
<p>to get from your diet</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see if you guys have that</p>
<p>one correct</p>
<p>as we go to darmonder from minneapolis</p>
<p>are you there dominder from minneapolis</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;m here hi how are you i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>wow i&rsquo;m doing good in general</p>
<p>yeah are you really doing that my main</p>
<p>issue has been my um you know</p>
<p>gut uh i have had</p>
<p>uh ibs uh more of or</p>
<p>on type c they call it right more on the</p>
<p>constipation side</p>
<p>um for for</p>
<p>almost since my early 20s i&rsquo;m 53 right</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>close to 53 and uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been heck of a ride i mean i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried different therapies and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve felt good and i felt bad um</p>
<p>but um i in 2012 i</p>
<p>did uh uh you know nutritional therapy</p>
<p>with dr</p>
<p>larry wilson um they</p>
<p>give supplements and whatnot but i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really looking for a starting point i</p>
<p>cannot tolerate any supplements anymore</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m really looking for a good</p>
<p>starting point to start healing my gut</p>
<p>can you tell me um can you can you give</p>
<p>me a couple ideas of what type of foods</p>
<p>that you eat on a daily basis</p>
<p>um i eat a lot of veggies mostly you</p>
<p>know different type of vegetables</p>
<p>um you know with my in my breakfast</p>
<p>lunch and dinner</p>
<p>um and i eat quinoa or brown rice that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty much it or i&rsquo;ll take you know</p>
<p>gluten-free breads i cannot</p>
<p>tolerate gluten either yeah</p>
<p>i think i know the problem i think i</p>
<p>know the problem</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re eating foods that</p>
<p>do have irritants</p>
<p>to your colon</p>
<p>in the brown rice unfortunately in the</p>
<p>grains</p>
<p>grains in general are real hard and even</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>a certain percentage of population</p>
<p>vegetables can uh create a lot of issues</p>
<p>with your gut</p>
<p>um in this case i know you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>vegetarian</p>
<p>um no i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m not a strict vegetarian i</p>
<p>can definitely</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m open to eating meat my family had a</p>
<p>background where we used to eat</p>
<p>meat so i am definitely open to that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no constraint over there okay i</p>
<p>would i&rsquo;m gonna recommend you do an</p>
<p>experiment</p>
<p>i want you to do something for one week</p>
<p>and then call me back next week</p>
<p>um i want you to do um</p>
<p>more of a carnivore diet and include</p>
<p>seafood</p>
<p>include meats and eggs</p>
<p>and i want to see how your gut feels</p>
<p>within one week</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do any grains no vegetables</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just see how you do in one</p>
<p>week because</p>
<p>for someone like you i think that may be</p>
<p>a significant um relief</p>
<p>to your gut and also</p>
<p>i want you to do some in a minute</p>
<p>fasting so don&rsquo;t eat three meals a day</p>
<p>like do</p>
<p>two meals a day work on that and then</p>
<p>touch space</p>
<p>with me next week because unless we get</p>
<p>your diet corrected</p>
<p>all these supplements are not going to</p>
<p>do anything okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you my experience with meat</p>
<p>also if i eat</p>
<p>chicken or egg i mean i have a really</p>
<p>hard time the next day</p>
<p>yeah so i think you could have because</p>
<p>of what you have</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably um there&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>either is allergies also an inability to</p>
<p>digest some of these proteins so</p>
<p>i would stick with the shellfish if you</p>
<p>could do it or</p>
<p>fish um and maybe some lamb</p>
<p>and try some other protein that you can</p>
<p>digest but</p>
<p>definitely not the ones that you know</p>
<p>for a fact will create a problem</p>
<p>okay thanks for your call</p>
<p>steve what do we have as answers yes sir</p>
<p>let me put the question up and it is</p>
<p>what is the easiest nutri nutrients</p>
<p>gives me to get</p>
<p>from your diet and the survey says 45</p>
<p>from calcium 45 is calcium 35 percent is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that oh vitamin c i&rsquo;m sorry i</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t read and 20</p>
<p>uh potassium do we have any smarty pants</p>
<p>in the audience</p>
<p>okay so um the easy</p>
<p>actually the easiest one to get is</p>
<p>vitamin k1</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in not only is it in</p>
<p>so many foods but your microbes</p>
<p>make b1 so it&rsquo;s very very very unlikely</p>
<p>for you to become k1 deficient</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one of those things that</p>
<p>stops bleeding and so your body as a</p>
<p>survival mechanism</p>
<p>has created um created many different</p>
<p>possible sources from this from your own</p>
<p>microbes</p>
<p>to the food that you eat and</p>
<p>so i guess i could even worded this</p>
<p>question a little bit differently what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>uh what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s probably the one of the</p>
<p>least nutritional deficiencies that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>ever have it&rsquo;s a k1</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re on coumatin you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking a drug that&rsquo;s blocking it because</p>
<p>that would</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole different situation but</p>
<p>most people are not deficient in k1</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;ll just have to give the audience</p>
<p>okay thanks steve hey let&rsquo;s go to matt</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>matt you had a question about exercise</p>
<p>are you there</p>
<p>yes i am thanks for taking my call i was</p>
<p>wondering if you could speak to the</p>
<p>relationship between gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>and um and using ketones um</p>
<p>for energy production and how that might</p>
<p>inform</p>
<p>the kind of exercise and the intensity</p>
<p>of it</p>
<p>and then also um just another quick</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;ve got plenty of stored fuel in</p>
<p>terms of fat already should i be</p>
<p>reducing my dietary fat</p>
<p>very low if i&rsquo;m already producing</p>
<p>ketones and in good ketosis</p>
<p>thanks good question good questions um</p>
<p>let me take the last question first</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t go i wouldn&rsquo;t go too low i</p>
<p>would not go below 75 grams of fat</p>
<p>because we need those fats for</p>
<p>many many different things but of course</p>
<p>yes if you reduce your fat your body is</p>
<p>forced to produce more ketones and i</p>
<p>guess</p>
<p>you cannot run your entire body on</p>
<p>ketones there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d say about a third of your tissues</p>
<p>require glucose and</p>
<p>parts of the pituitary gland parts of</p>
<p>the hypothalamus</p>
<p>the lens of the eye the red blood cell</p>
<p>part of your kidney need glucose</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you need to know your body</p>
<p>can very easily make</p>
<p>this glucose through this process of</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>and it can make it from ketones</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t even need it doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>need protein to make it can make it from</p>
<p>your own</p>
<p>fat so when you&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re basically going to</p>
<p>oxidize your glucose your store glucose</p>
<p>as glycogen</p>
<p>from your liver and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>start tapping in the fat</p>
<p>and the the key</p>
<p>with what i think you&rsquo;re trying to do is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>use up your stored fuel and</p>
<p>also make sure that when you exercise</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having an optimum fuel source so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t run out of those glute</p>
<p>that glucose that&rsquo;s needed by certain</p>
<p>parts of your tissue but</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s going to be a process where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>adapt to more fat oxidation over a</p>
<p>period of</p>
<p>months which does take some time if you</p>
<p>do hardcore keto</p>
<p>your body will start making more ketones</p>
<p>and then when you add more exercise more</p>
<p>and more</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be more of a fat burner and</p>
<p>that is much healthier and you can last</p>
<p>longer</p>
<p>but in this transition phase a lot of</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>end up with like hitting this wall where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not adapting as much and so they</p>
<p>feel kind of low blood sugar issues and</p>
<p>they tap out of the glycogen and not</p>
<p>converting over to fat burning as well</p>
<p>and that is a reflection of your liver</p>
<p>so if you have a fatty liver for example</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you have a gut which means you have a</p>
<p>fatty liver it might take a longer</p>
<p>period of time</p>
<p>so one little tip that i would give you</p>
<p>and other people if you have a lot of</p>
<p>weight to lose</p>
<p>i would focus on trying to get that</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>working better faster and that will</p>
<p>speed up</p>
<p>everything is especially your ability to</p>
<p>adapt to ketosis</p>
<p>and less reliance on blood and running</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>glucose and less reliance on</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>and to do that you take choline</p>
<p>purify bile salts lecithin there are</p>
<p>three things that will speed things up</p>
<p>and that will dump the fat off the liver</p>
<p>a lot faster</p>
<p>all right thanks for your question dr</p>
<p>berg yes</p>
<p>um one one other question if my body is</p>
<p>producing a high amount of ketones i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>always above</p>
<p>two to five and a half millimoles</p>
<p>does that mean my liver is functioning</p>
<p>well yeah or is it probably</p>
<p>poorly no i think you&rsquo;d i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>functioning pretty well</p>
<p>because um it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re still within a</p>
<p>good range</p>
<p>and i wouldn&rsquo;t i mean if you&rsquo;re going up</p>
<p>into like you see eight</p>
<p>nine ten that&rsquo;s a big problem but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a good range i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another indication that your liver is</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>pretty good um you know it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt</p>
<p>you know at some point to get it just</p>
<p>get a liver uh</p>
<p>profile and see if there&rsquo;s any problems</p>
<p>with enzymes</p>
<p>being too high with liver enzymes but</p>
<p>honestly if you&rsquo;re on keto and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing intermittent fasting and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exercising</p>
<p>i think that all that&rsquo;s going to help</p>
<p>your liver so i think you&rsquo;re right on</p>
<p>track i would just ride the wave and um</p>
<p>you can always tweak things but i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing pretty good</p>
<p>okay doc how about a few more uh</p>
<p>questions from social media</p>
<p>yes all right all right guys</p>
<p>are you bad on facebook susan wants to</p>
<p>know how much iron do i need</p>
<p>with chronic anemia she has an anemic</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>you know here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the thing be</p>
<p>careful</p>
<p>about the type of um irony you take</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called ferrous</p>
<p>sulfate i think it&rsquo;s called this is uh</p>
<p>yeah ferrous sulfate that&rsquo;s a common one</p>
<p>that they uh</p>
<p>there there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>supplements i would not take that if i</p>
<p>were you because</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a high incidence of gi</p>
<p>symptoms and constipation and it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>oxidizing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>oxidating it irritates the cold and it</p>
<p>creates inflammation</p>
<p>a much better source of iron than</p>
<p>supplements</p>
<p>is concentrated supplements as in</p>
<p>grass-fed liver supplements or grass-fed</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>or red meat or a good one would be</p>
<p>you can also get</p>
<p>spleen extracts they have like a bovine</p>
<p>spleen extract i know some people might</p>
<p>be grossed out about it but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good iron protein bound</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like the iron comes in more of</p>
<p>a bound to an amino acid it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s chelated so it&rsquo;s much easier on the</p>
<p>system so anything you get like a</p>
<p>chelated iron</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bound with protein is way better</p>
<p>than the</p>
<p>ferrous sulfate that they have in a lot</p>
<p>of different supplements</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing that and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still not working</p>
<p>the real cause is or the more a more</p>
<p>common cause would be</p>
<p>low stomach acids so if you were to</p>
<p>take betaine hydrochloride in your diet</p>
<p>you would be much better off and you</p>
<p>probably see your anemia go</p>
<p>going away um</p>
<p>not only that is that when you take or</p>
<p>consume red meat for example</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t break down the red meat</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t extract the iron from the</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not assimilating iron or even</p>
<p>the calcium because your stomach acids</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t strong enough</p>
<p>that could be why you&rsquo;re anemic as well</p>
<p>and the stomach acid also will help you</p>
<p>kill two birds with one stone because it</p>
<p>will help you</p>
<p>absorb b12 without the stomach acid</p>
<p>you can have an anemia from b12 as well</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>an iron deficiency anemia so honestly</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re already consuming some red</p>
<p>meat and and you&rsquo;re still anemic</p>
<p>it could be your menstruating that could</p>
<p>be one issue but the other common one is</p>
<p>low stomach acid so the secret is</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>take about four or five of those before</p>
<p>you eat</p>
<p>and you should see some change within</p>
<p>one about one week</p>
<p>all right steve all right another quiz</p>
<p>or what would you like</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;m going for another quiz what</p>
<p>is the number one cause of fatigue over</p>
<p>the age of 50.</p>
<p>and now i know steve that you&rsquo;re about</p>
<p>45 years old but</p>
<p>you will find out after you&rsquo;re 50 you</p>
<p>may start</p>
<p>noticing a little fatigue so the</p>
<p>question is what is the</p>
<p>most common cause of fatigue in people</p>
<p>over 50.</p>
<p>all right they are advised okay</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s go to eric from anaheim</p>
<p>you had a question eric um are you there</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;m here can you hear me yes</p>
<p>perfectly</p>
<p>oh hi dr burke i have a question and</p>
<p>before i get to my question i want to</p>
<p>let you know that</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been an inspiration to me</p>
<p>and as a matter of fact but i&rsquo;m also</p>
<p>taking your</p>
<p>keto and intermittent fasting courses</p>
<p>and your health code and your health</p>
<p>courses</p>
<p>because someday i do want to yeah so</p>
<p>that way i want to i do want to become a</p>
<p>health coach and you&rsquo;ve been so much an</p>
<p>inspiration so</p>
<p>thank you so much for my call yeah so</p>
<p>michael</p>
<p>yeah so my question to you is so</p>
<p>this is more pertaining to my girlfriend</p>
<p>so my girlfriend i</p>
<p>my girlfriend i have been doing healthy</p>
<p>healthy keto with intermittent fasting</p>
<p>tips september 1st</p>
<p>and for me luckily for me during this</p>
<p>stretch of time i&rsquo;ve lost 31 pounds</p>
<p>wow and that&rsquo;s for yeah and as for her</p>
<p>she only lost four pounds</p>
<p>and yeah yeah yeah so she doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>luck in her end unfortunately</p>
<p>so the thing is that she has an iud</p>
<p>and i want to know if if the iud is</p>
<p>causing her weight loss um</p>
<p>yeah it could be a barrier it could</p>
<p>definitely be a barrier um especially if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even a</p>
<p>copper iud it can create an imbalance</p>
<p>with zinc</p>
<p>and create some issues with that um i</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s an issue with uh birth</p>
<p>control</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very difficult problem</p>
<p>to solve</p>
<p>without complications um</p>
<p>i think that could be slowing things</p>
<p>down but</p>
<p>before you jump into that being the</p>
<p>reason what i would do is i&rsquo;d watch some</p>
<p>of my videos on plateau</p>
<p>and make sure that once you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>keto correctly number two</p>
<p>is your carbs low enough is she doing</p>
<p>fasting long enough</p>
<p>if you go through the list and you still</p>
<p>have problems then you want to look</p>
<p>look at something like that and</p>
<p>other body weaknesses that she may have</p>
<p>is she estrogen dominant um those type</p>
<p>of things so</p>
<p>because the difference between you know</p>
<p>a man and a woman</p>
<p>has to do with the estrogen that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t lose weight as fast because</p>
<p>estrogen is a</p>
<p>prevents the loss of weight and but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do</p>
<p>um but that is a a complaint for a lot</p>
<p>of women like</p>
<p>you know my other half can lose weight i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but definitely um watch my videos on</p>
<p>plateau</p>
<p>try that out and see if that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help her and if it doesn&rsquo;t then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to find a plan b</p>
<p>for the iud</p>
<p>okay thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>good luck all right steve do we have an</p>
<p>answer yet</p>
<p>no still tabulating that but elizabeth</p>
<p>one of our</p>
<p>valued listeners wants to know why the</p>
<p>front of my calves</p>
<p>are itching i hate it when that happens</p>
<p>well i i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s exposed to</p>
<p>something environmentally it could be a</p>
<p>situation but itching in general</p>
<p>if you have itching you want to look to</p>
<p>the liver</p>
<p>and it could also be a backup</p>
<p>of bile into the blood</p>
<p>which can then deposit into the skin and</p>
<p>create uh</p>
<p>pureitis which is itching so one</p>
<p>interesting little thing you might want</p>
<p>to try is to take some purified bile</p>
<p>salts on an empty stomach</p>
<p>and see if the itching goes away and if</p>
<p>it does then we know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a problem with your liver slash</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>oh by the way steve people a location</p>
<p>of where some people or majority people</p>
<p>have itching when they have liver issues</p>
<p>is in the bottom of the foot</p>
<p>right in the arch so</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s just an fyi i think that</p>
<p>might be another video</p>
<p>uh to talk about why that is itching in</p>
<p>your arch</p>
<p>arch itching faster with consumed height</p>
<p>by the way we do have some answers doc</p>
<p>yeah go ahead all right so question is</p>
<p>what is the number one cause</p>
<p>of fatigue in people over 50 that</p>
<p>unfortunately includes me</p>
<p>and 40 percent of us say a lack of</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>50 percent uh say or excuse me another</p>
<p>40 say a lack of vitamin b</p>
<p>and 20 percent say low testosterone</p>
<p>you know all of you guys are right and</p>
<p>girls are right</p>
<p>um but there is something that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know that i found to be</p>
<p>even more common in those things and</p>
<p>that has to do with</p>
<p>stomach acids not having enough stomach</p>
<p>acids which relates to another question</p>
<p>we talked about</p>
<p>as you age especially over the age of 50</p>
<p>and then 60 and 70 you start really</p>
<p>losing your stomach acid</p>
<p>and there are so many reasons why</p>
<p>you get tired from that number one you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t digest protein that well anymore</p>
<p>number two</p>
<p>you become iron anemic and then you also</p>
<p>number three you have low b12 and then</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t absorb minerals</p>
<p>um so and this definitely relates if you</p>
<p>get more tired when you</p>
<p>eat definitely suspect</p>
<p>low stomach acids now if you are tired</p>
<p>and this kind of makes sense to you very</p>
<p>very</p>
<p>simple solution get some betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride take three or four or five</p>
<p>actually four or five of those</p>
<p>before you eat consistently and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna find that your energy goes</p>
<p>up i mean when i was in practice</p>
<p>it was like so many people had this</p>
<p>problem i would just put them on some</p>
<p>obtained hydrochloride</p>
<p>they would do so much better with their</p>
<p>digestion and with their energy it goes</p>
<p>right up</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re starting to really</p>
<p>absorb</p>
<p>these minerals like iron and</p>
<p>magnesium and they start to digest</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a real common problem</p>
<p>especially when you get older</p>
<p>all right steve we&rsquo;re going to go to</p>
<p>um julie from los angeles are you there</p>
<p>hi julie go ahead hello oh thank you</p>
<p>dr berg i have many many issues</p>
<p>first of all i&rsquo;m a muslim i fast every</p>
<p>year</p>
<p>the fasting last year was very difficult</p>
<p>for me</p>
<p>uh during the day i would get like i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t breathe</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d get fatigued um</p>
<p>like i have to lay down i i can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>you know get up it&rsquo;s very weak</p>
<p>i this happens to me every year i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been on a gluten-free diet</p>
<p>for like three years now i can&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>dairy</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t because of my gut</p>
<p>i have fibromyalgia i have like chronic</p>
<p>pain in my arms</p>
<p>and my back now when i did the glute</p>
<p>free the pain</p>
<p>was better for like maybe 90</p>
<p>now that now i&rsquo;m starting to get back to</p>
<p>pain</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still on the gluten free um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still taking supplements i i see</p>
<p>a holistic doctor that&rsquo;s helping me out</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t seen any results yet the</p>
<p>supplements</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m taking supplements but i&rsquo;m finding</p>
<p>like sometimes the supplements really</p>
<p>weigh me down</p>
<p>like i prefer to take supplements like</p>
<p>in a powder form</p>
<p>so i have a question i have a question</p>
<p>what part of your body hurts more the</p>
<p>right side or the left side</p>
<p>um well in my arm the right side</p>
<p>because i have the right side i have it</p>
<p>in my shoulder and my hand</p>
<p>and i also have discs i have two</p>
<p>herniated discs</p>
<p>also as well right so here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to tell you</p>
<p>about this okay</p>
<p>you need to take it even further than</p>
<p>a gluten-free diet you need to go into</p>
<p>the healthy version of keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting because i think</p>
<p>your digestive problems are behind this</p>
<p>this pain and fibromyalgia</p>
<p>and in practice um i would notice that</p>
<p>nearly everyone that came in with</p>
<p>fibromyalgia had it on the right side</p>
<p>the arm the shoulder</p>
<p>the hand and that is because the</p>
<p>gallbladder is on the right side now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to say well what</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that connection well the hip bone</p>
<p>is connected to the thigh bone now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your gallbladder has a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right underneath the diaphragm</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little nerve called the</p>
<p>phrenic nerve that goes all the way up</p>
<p>to the right shoulder which can then</p>
<p>literally cause a</p>
<p>spasm in the muscles into your neck and</p>
<p>cause a</p>
<p>kind of a pinched nerve down the right</p>
<p>side and boy does it feel like</p>
<p>fibromyalgia on the right side so</p>
<p>anything you can do to support the</p>
<p>gallbladder and that would be what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you healthy keto</p>
<p>intermittent fasting i would definitely</p>
<p>take a gallbladder formula support</p>
<p>um like with each meal and then on empty</p>
<p>stomach maybe take</p>
<p>two of those or three of those a day and</p>
<p>then what will happen</p>
<p>is that your gallbladder will be better</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start absorbing more nutrition</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have less pain</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll start healing the different</p>
<p>parts of your body</p>
<p>i think this is a really easy problem to</p>
<p>solve if</p>
<p>if you get the the basics in not adding</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>whole bunch of supplements but just</p>
<p>doing healthy keto</p>
<p>dairy free of course no more grains</p>
<p>follow my my videos on that</p>
<p>and then julie do that for this week and</p>
<p>then call me next week and tell me</p>
<p>how much better you are because um</p>
<p>we gotta look at the whole picture here</p>
<p>and i think there you&rsquo;re missing a real</p>
<p>real important thing thanks for your</p>
<p>call</p>
<p>all right doc by the way and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure if this shows up on your little</p>
<p>list but colleen has been on for quite a</p>
<p>while from alberta canada by the way she</p>
<p>loves your kale shake but she wants to</p>
<p>know how much k2d3</p>
<p>does she need for optimum health</p>
<p>hi colleen how are you good morning very</p>
<p>well thank you good morning</p>
<p>great i think you answered my question</p>
<p>when you said you take 20</p>
<p>i use with d3 for maintenance</p>
<p>okay now i can&rsquo;t get yours your ten</p>
<p>thousand</p>
<p>iud which is not your fault i know and i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even get it from dr mccola&rsquo;s site</p>
<p>so all i can get is</p>
<p>a thousand i use a d3 i had to buy</p>
<p>two separate bottles yesterday in order</p>
<p>to get k2 120 micrograms with the d3 and</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>so uh do i just go ahead and take</p>
<p>20 of these like a day yeah</p>
<p>if you if you know if you get it in a</p>
<p>liquid you because i think you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>canada and the problem is that</p>
<p>when i um they have recruit they have</p>
<p>these</p>
<p>these rules that you can&rsquo;t do like</p>
<p>especially high levels of potassium</p>
<p>or vitamin d and so um i would probably</p>
<p>find a liquid and that might be easier</p>
<p>but yes you need to just take more</p>
<p>and and when i say a maintenance dose of</p>
<p>d3 in k2 uh i&rsquo;m talking about 20 000 ius</p>
<p>through the winter months</p>
<p>now during the summer i&rsquo;m getting a lot</p>
<p>more sun so i probably don&rsquo;t even take</p>
<p>it at all</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s just an fyi but during the</p>
<p>winter</p>
<p>especially from if you have kind of a</p>
<p>history of inflammation like i do</p>
<p>and old injuries i need a little bit</p>
<p>more d3</p>
<p>simply just because i have um if i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>things kind of kick in gear and just</p>
<p>because years of</p>
<p>wear and tear but um but yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i would recommend</p>
<p>okay um does the bulletproof coffee</p>
<p>break the</p>
<p>your fast i put butter and coconut oil i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s correct and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m putting you know what you&rsquo;re too</p>
<p>little it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s not going to break your ketosis</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re going to make more ketones</p>
<p>but it may</p>
<p>slow down weight loss because your body</p>
<p>is using</p>
<p>those things to make ketones versus your</p>
<p>own</p>
<p>fat fuel and so um</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting is when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting um you&rsquo;re on a high fat diet</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually on a high fat diet when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fasting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>and um but as soon as you start to add</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>fat the body we&rsquo;ll just use that and so</p>
<p>will it break your fast depends on your</p>
<p>definition of a fast but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t as long as you know you&rsquo;re happy</p>
<p>with it it gives you energy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great but if you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>lose more weight you might want to just</p>
<p>not add that in there and see what</p>
<p>happens okay um</p>
<p>is it normal to i fasted for 48 hours</p>
<p>and i stayed the same weight then like</p>
<p>the third day i was like what</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still the same weight what i got</p>
<p>only got 22 pounds to lose and</p>
<p>i mean i that&rsquo;s probably normal right</p>
<p>okay so um that means that you are</p>
<p>your metabolism obviously is slow and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do to</p>
<p>speed this up but i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take that as a loss um the main thing is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s i would go with the other</p>
<p>benefits of</p>
<p>fasting right now which are cognitive</p>
<p>function energy</p>
<p>etc but here&rsquo;s the thing um</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re starting this out that that</p>
<p>could happen</p>
<p>as your body heals and you go through</p>
<p>autophagy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be recycling a lot of</p>
<p>protein so you may start noticing that</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>size like your stomach is shrinking a</p>
<p>little bit</p>
<p>but your weight is not just because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re healing more</p>
<p>atrophied muscles which is a little bit</p>
<p>heavier per volume than fat</p>
<p>so i would not be</p>
<p>too concerned with that but what i would</p>
<p>do is when you go back to your eating</p>
<p>maybe once a day and then do more of the</p>
<p>prolonged fasting</p>
<p>and even go longer sometimes and then</p>
<p>just make sure you keep your carbs</p>
<p>really really low</p>
<p>and just give it more time and follow</p>
<p>exactly like how</p>
<p>like i talk about in some of the videos</p>
<p>i have on on plateau because</p>
<p>it just happens with certain people that</p>
<p>just have a slow metabolism and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many things you can do to</p>
<p>overcome that but</p>
<p>in the beginning that&rsquo;s not uncommon</p>
<p>thanks for your call all right doc how</p>
<p>about another quiz</p>
<p>yes here&rsquo;s a true or false</p>
<p>well let me just say this are ketones</p>
<p>fats is a ketone of fat</p>
<p>yes or no that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>question steve</p>
<p>okay good so now let&rsquo;s go to sandra</p>
<p>from winterhaven had a question go ahead</p>
<p>sandra</p>
<p>hi can you hear me perfectly okay thank</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um and thank you for taking my call i</p>
<p>last time i spoke to you</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re gonna try to get my gallbladder</p>
<p>fixed so</p>
<p>i bought the gallbladder formula and the</p>
<p>instructions</p>
<p>it says take three times a day one with</p>
<p>each meal</p>
<p>naturally i&rsquo;m only eating once a day so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it would be better for my gallbladder</p>
<p>to do something really small</p>
<p>three times a day to get the gallbladder</p>
<p>fixed</p>
<p>or if i should just stay eating once a</p>
<p>day and take three or once a day and</p>
<p>just do one</p>
<p>what i would do if i were you i would</p>
<p>take that first one on an empty stomach</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re not having a</p>
<p>breakfast hopefully like taking an empty</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s gonna happen that bile</p>
<p>is going to help you unjam any kind of</p>
<p>blockage in your bile ducts to the liver</p>
<p>and help the drainage and there&rsquo;s huge</p>
<p>benefits of taking an empty stomach</p>
<p>antimicrobial benefits um helping you</p>
<p>dissolve if any</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fatty fat on the liver um</p>
<p>and um you know counteracting if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>any sibo there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absorbing more fat soluble nutrients</p>
<p>even from</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in your body like to help you up</p>
<p>simulating that but main thing is is the</p>
<p>flow of gallbladder through these ducts</p>
<p>because when you take the purify bile</p>
<p>salts when you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s primarily going to be working on</p>
<p>the dietary</p>
<p>fat that you&rsquo;re eating more than what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening</p>
<p>in your physiology so i would just add</p>
<p>it on an empty stomach not a problem</p>
<p>good question sandra okay doc we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>the the answer and i i pray for the</p>
<p>audience</p>
<p>that uh this is uh trek because they say</p>
<p>uh oh i&rsquo;m sorry there was a little about</p>
<p>90 say true and 10</p>
<p>say false so where does that leave us</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right so this uh could uh kind of</p>
<p>you know throw you guys off but no</p>
<p>ketones are not a fat</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually made from fat they come</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>fat but they&rsquo;re not an actual fat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different than a fat it&rsquo;s a fuel</p>
<p>source</p>
<p>that your body prefers especially in the</p>
<p>brain in the heart</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a fat and the other</p>
<p>interesting thing about it that um</p>
<p>your liver</p>
<p>your liver does cannot use ketones</p>
<p>it makes ketones but it doesn&rsquo;t use it</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s certain tissues and i&rsquo;ll do a</p>
<p>video on this that</p>
<p>cannot utilize ketones you know a small</p>
<p>percentage</p>
<p>of your body but the majority does use</p>
<p>ketones</p>
<p>especially the brain and two parts of</p>
<p>the brain that</p>
<p>really need ketones in a bad way would</p>
<p>be the hippocampus which is all about</p>
<p>memory and learning</p>
<p>and the frontal cortex which is involved</p>
<p>in processing and making judgments and</p>
<p>planning and</p>
<p>whatever um now they don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>for sure what it does but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a relay for those functions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m going to say with that</p>
<p>but if that part of your brain is</p>
<p>damaged then people have symptoms with</p>
<p>those things but</p>
<p>as far as feeding those parts of your</p>
<p>brain ketones are the answer but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a fact</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting by the way myra from</p>
<p>san nicolas</p>
<p>hello myra was the 10 she said</p>
<p>not a fat so we must shout out to her</p>
<p>and by the way there&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>question so good for you myra</p>
<p>lou was sick with covert 19 just like me</p>
<p>but now he can&rsquo;t lose weight on keto is</p>
<p>there any connection by the way</p>
<p>lou and i know doesn&rsquo;t help you to hear</p>
<p>that that was not my experience i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing well with the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting in keto but that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>side effect perhaps i think i think the</p>
<p>immune system is still</p>
<p>needs some support so i think the best</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>um related to with your immune system is</p>
<p>to do whatever you can to drop</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>take more vitamin d take more zinc</p>
<p>those two right there and then there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be less inflammation</p>
<p>stronger immune system more weight loss</p>
<p>because think about it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not sleeping at night if you</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>more stress if you have a weakened</p>
<p>immune system</p>
<p>your metabolism is influenced greatly</p>
<p>so i think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>into right now is just</p>
<p>some residual inflammation</p>
<p>or um</p>
<p>definitely as it relates to stressing</p>
<p>your body in general</p>
<p>okay all right how about one more phone</p>
<p>call</p>
<p>last for the day yep all right so before</p>
<p>i answer this</p>
<p>one last phone call actually no we</p>
<p>answer all the questions right okay good</p>
<p>um yeah let&rsquo;s go to linda linda are you</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s lydia doc lydia are you</p>
<p>there oh lydia sorry lydia yes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay uh can you hear me good</p>
<p>perfectly</p>
<p>okay i have a question about well a few</p>
<p>questions about</p>
<p>certain things um nutritional east um i</p>
<p>have both of them i have</p>
<p>yours and i have bob&rsquo;s red bell and i</p>
<p>wanted to know the difference</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of hard to take the tablet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really easy for me to take the</p>
<p>the powder another one another one is</p>
<p>the hair</p>
<p>uh formula um with the</p>
<p>intermediate fasting how long until i</p>
<p>see results</p>
<p>after taking this have another one</p>
<p>we wanted you i heard you talking about</p>
<p>chickens and we wanted to buy chickens</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the ones that we buy are i mean the eggs</p>
<p>that we buy</p>
<p>is the vital organic pasta raised</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the only ones that are</p>
<p>really yellow we buy sometimes from the</p>
<p>farms and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like almost white like light</p>
<p>yellow so what if we buy chickens</p>
<p>other than i know sometimes in the</p>
<p>winter they need to be fed</p>
<p>certain things and what is an additional</p>
<p>feed</p>
<p>that you can feed other than grain or</p>
<p>what do you feed them</p>
<p>you know you have to do grains but i do</p>
<p>um organic grains</p>
<p>but i let the chickens out all day long</p>
<p>to eat the worms and the bugs and</p>
<p>everything</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re out all the time we have</p>
<p>like eight of them now</p>
<p>and um so they get this huge variety and</p>
<p>i make it myself if</p>
<p>sunflower seeds and a couple different</p>
<p>grains of course all non-gmo</p>
<p>and meal worms and</p>
<p>calcium flakes and a whole series of</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ll do a video on that because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole protocol that you can give these</p>
<p>chickens and they just</p>
<p>love it and they will lay eggs all</p>
<p>winter long which is unusual</p>
<p>but they have the nutrition to do it but</p>
<p>definitely you want to let them free</p>
<p>range and</p>
<p>go through the yard and get the bugs um</p>
<p>as far as the</p>
<p>bob&rsquo;s mill um i think it&rsquo;s uh they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fortifying it with synthetic vitamins if</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>one of the things that you there is</p>
<p>other sources you can get a powder that</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>unfortified and when i say unfortified</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>mainly without the synthetic additional</p>
<p>vitamins because um they do that</p>
<p>routinely</p>
<p>um the other thing that this is your pal</p>
<p>steve and i am</p>
<p>a freak for dr berg&rsquo;s uh nutritional</p>
<p>yeast and those are healthy sized pills</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re difficult to swallow</p>
<p>so i crunch them i mean i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve tried that but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a very nutty flavor and i just</p>
<p>love them i just uh</p>
<p>you know have no issue with that at all</p>
<p>and have grown accustomed to the taste</p>
<p>that might be an acquired taste but a</p>
<p>lot of people do that</p>
<p>sounds great good idea steve yep you can</p>
<p>crush them i chew them</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t swallow them because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re quite</p>
<p>big but i chewed them and yeah it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>you know up to just to figure that out</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>yeah terry was doing the heimlick on me</p>
<p>like every week before i decided to chew</p>
<p>them up so</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re too big to swallow i think</p>
<p>so a little different</p>
<p>and i think you had another question</p>
<p>there was one more question um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to make sure i go about the</p>
<p>hair formula i have a lot of hair loss</p>
<p>like fall every time i brush it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>hair and</p>
<p>yeah this is this is what i would do i</p>
<p>would um</p>
<p>make sure of course you&rsquo;re doing healthy</p>
<p>keto and intermittent fasting but</p>
<p>also there&rsquo;s something called essential</p>
<p>aminos and these essential aminos</p>
<p>you take those um just once a day</p>
<p>and um you get a way better absorption</p>
<p>rate of</p>
<p>protein in general and since hair is</p>
<p>made out of amino acids</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll just bypass any type of</p>
<p>digestive weakness that you have and</p>
<p>goes right into the tissue like a rocket</p>
<p>ship</p>
<p>and that would help you and then i would</p>
<p>just double</p>
<p>the hair formula and then see what</p>
<p>happens i think that should be the</p>
<p>ticket</p>
<p>in fact what you could do is try this</p>
<p>for two weeks and then call me call me</p>
<p>back on our show and see how you do</p>
<p>thank you lydia all right</p>
<p>listen guys i really appreciate your</p>
<p>bearing with</p>
<p>some of these tactical difficulties um</p>
<p>stay tuned for some more</p>
<p>videos and um i have some real</p>
<p>interesting topics coming up but</p>
<p>um stay tuned and thank you so much for</p>
<p>your questions that you gave us and uh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk to you next week</p>
