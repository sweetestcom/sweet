    <p>It was very interesting going to Sax&rsquo;s kid&rsquo;s birthday party.</p>
<p>Freeberg and I were there for about two or three hours. Sax showed up for the last half hour.</p>
<p>I think I was there for two hours and didn&rsquo;t see Sax. And then I saw him on my way out the door.</p>
<p>But he had some YouTubers there who were pretty cool.</p>
<p>Yeah. Papa Jake and Logan. Thank you.</p>
<p>Papa Jake was great.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, they have 7 million followers on YouTube. Eat your heart out, J Cal.</p>
<p>How many times bigger is Papa Jake than you?</p>
<p>Business and podcasting on YouTube is a new concept, long form.</p>
<p>And long form is not what the algorithm is designed for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously designed for short form and people getting to completion.</p>
<p>So getting to completion on a 90 minute video.</p>
<p>Are we talking about lovemaking again? Sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, God. Jesus. When I say completion, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>We need an HR department at All In.</p>
<p>Yeah. I prefer the short form format for that too.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>These are called open folks.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the All In podcast. It&rsquo;s episode 56.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made it past 55. The show, the band is still together.</p>
<p>Coming to you every Friday night far too late,</p>
<p>because the Rain Man obsesses over every edit in the podcast.</p>
<p>With us again, the All In Scorsese himself, David Rain Man Sacks,</p>
<p>and the Queen of Quinoa, the Sultan of Science, David Friedberg is here.</p>
<p>And with a power sweater that cost more&hellip;</p>
<p>No, turtleneck, turtleneck, turtleneck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, a power turtleneck that cost more than your mortgage payment this month,</p>
<p>the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jay Cal. It was a pretty incredible week. I think we have to pander to the cryptocurrency</p>
<p>crowd because that&rsquo;s just making ratings go through the roof here. I am absolutely</p>
<p>inspired by what we saw this week, with the Constitution Dow forming in about a week and</p>
<p>going from $1 or $2 million to $46 million raised through a Dow. If you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what these decentralized autonomous organizations are, it&rsquo;s basically analogous to a corporate</p>
<p>structure, but that&rsquo;s written in code. So you can get a group of people together,</p>
<p>typically in a discord. Then you create a smart contract. They collect in a wallet,</p>
<p>a bunch of ETH or it&rsquo;s typically ETH right now. And then you get some kind of governance</p>
<p>written into the Dow, where people get voting power. They brought this together to bid on one</p>
<p>of 13 copies of the original Constitution of the United States. And it was a very controversial</p>
<p>moment last night, when 80% of the money was raised in the last 48 hours. And there was this</p>
<p>crazy auction going back and forth. With two representatives of Sotheby&rsquo;s on the phone,</p>
<p>it hit $41 million. Everybody thought that the Dow had won, which would have mean would have meant</p>
<p>that almost 20,000 people who participated in this would then vote on what to do with this</p>
<p>$41 million offer. Coindesk incorrectly reported that the Dow won. And then the Dow announced that</p>
<p>they had in fact, not some other statistics. Their Twitter has 36,000 followers. The group reported</p>
<p>they needed 14 million to participate 30 million to be competitive and 40 million to have a great</p>
<p>chance of winning. They raised like, I think six or 7 million while they were on the air, you know,</p>
<p>and the auction had started. And the only downside to all of this is that there were huge gas fees,</p>
<p>people were spending 30 4050 bucks to donate 200, which was the average size of these.</p>
<p>Yeah, they should have done it on Solana.</p>
<p>All right, so here we go talking our own book again. Now we got somebody&rsquo;s gonna clip this out.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do with your copy of the Constitution?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna auction it back to the day when you&rsquo;re gonna burn it and make an NFT out of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny. I did buy something at these auctions.</p>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite unique. I will I will not comment on what it was. But was it that turtleneck?</p>
<p>No, but</p>
<p>Banksy.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But I did. So but I watched these auctions closely,</p>
<p>I guess is what I&rsquo;m trying to say. And I was surprised that the US Constitution for sold so</p>
<p>little, you know, for a basically like the Magna Carta of the best startup that&rsquo;s ever been created.</p>
<p>Well, but there&rsquo;s 13 of them, right? So on a market cap basis,</p>
<p>on a market cap basis, you got multiplied by 13.</p>
<p>Yeah, great. 13 times 40.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t one of the originals. It was the printing after the original was signed.</p>
<p>We have a 20. We&rsquo;ve created a $22 trillion a year startup that keeps compounding by</p>
<p>45% a year. I would have thought these things would be worth, you know, a couple 100 million each.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of there&rsquo;s a lot of US memorabilia. But yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>but what I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>It means the US Constitution, David is not as it&rsquo;s not worth as much as it used to be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well, you know, you got other you got you got the original.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of documents, you got the Declaration of Independence, you got,</p>
<p>you know, the Gettysburg Address, there&rsquo;s time a dozen, the Tea Party memo,</p>
<p>I actually think Citizens United technically, guys, the Citizens United, if it was written not</p>
<p>one time, in one document by the Supreme Court, that would be worth much more than 40 million,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s basically invalidated most of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s one of the interesting things that happened here.</p>
<p>David, David, wait, David, acknowledge that what I just said is true.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t understand what you just said.</p>
<p>But I just said, if you had printed the Citizens United verdict from the Supreme Court on a piece</p>
<p>of that would be worth more than $40 million. It was it was like democracy 2.0 is what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying. I don&rsquo;t understand why people are getting so swept up in this thing. It&rsquo;s kind of my neither.</p>
<p>Me neither. That&rsquo;s what you guys are missing is this is a critical moment in the history</p>
<p>of cryptocurrencies, because the first three major use cases of cryptocurrency were kind of</p>
<p>you had money transfer, which is not as good as PayPal or Venmo or many other solutions.</p>
<p>No, Jason, I think you had store of value, hold on, let me finish store of value,</p>
<p>which is like, who cares? It&rsquo;s plain waste to store value. And then NFTs got interesting,</p>
<p>but these DAOs are absolutely game changing the ability to have $47 million show up</p>
<p>and be prepared to be deployed in 48 hours. That&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>You ever hear of an ICO? ICOs were illegal, and they&rsquo;ve been banned.</p>
<p>And how is DAO any different? I mean, because DAOs have governance,</p>
<p>DAOs have governance, and it&rsquo;s a programmable governance. It&rsquo;s a programmable corporate entity.</p>
<p>It is huge. If these things transfer ownership interest, they will be regulated like securities.</p>
<p>Of course, that is a very important point. And in this particular model,</p>
<p>the idea was it would all be kind of part of a nonprofit and it would not be kind of</p>
<p>owned by anyone. They were donations, in fact.</p>
<p>They were donations. And so as soon as these DAOs, which they should,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an incredibly powerful tool, if it does actually become a security instrument,</p>
<p>then it changes everything. And it is going to be that.</p>
<p>My whole thing is like, it&rsquo;s one thing outside the US first, right? And then it&rsquo;ll be crypto,</p>
<p>ex US crypto investments that are going to drive this. And that&rsquo;s why the US is going to be left</p>
<p>behind. Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re missing. These DAOs are pushing the envelope in the same way Airbnb</p>
<p>and Uber did in terms of, you know, bending the rules about ride sharing or renting your extra</p>
<p>room. These DAOs are kind of breaking securities laws, they were telling people were buying the</p>
<p>Constitution, people who donated thought they were buying part of it. We&rsquo;re not missing the point.</p>
<p>So okay, but here&rsquo;s the thing. If they bend the rules like this, what they showed to the SEC is</p>
<p>that there is a huge appetite for people to quickly form groups of capital at low dollar</p>
<p>amounts to do something important or interesting in the world. And Americans now have a taste of</p>
<p>that. They&rsquo;re going to continue to have a taste of it. And I think it&rsquo;s gonna force the accreditation</p>
<p>laws to change. I disagree. I think that what it showed is that this is yet another explanation</p>
<p>of fractionalized ownership that demand existed well before DAOs.</p>
<p>Totally. It&rsquo;s it exists today, it&rsquo;ll exist tomorrow,</p>
<p>a DAO was just yet another on-ramp. But much like most fractional ownerships</p>
<p>are terrible financial trades for crappy assets, so was this. So said differently,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to spend the time to open a Robinhood or E-Trade account,</p>
<p>it still matters whether you buy a share of Lycos or a share of Google.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay. And so whether you do a DAO or whether you have an LLC, to me, it&rsquo;s irrelevant. The underlying</p>
<p>asset didn&rsquo;t make any sense, had zero chance, in my opinion, of any meaningful appreciation.</p>
<p>And so if you really want to make something work, and if you want to prove the DAO,</p>
<p>then I would have hoped that they would have actually asked a few smart people, Hey, guys,</p>
<p>people who buy art, people who know crypto, what are some assets that I should own? Because if</p>
<p>this does appreciate, you&rsquo;ll do more to prove the questions that you beat them out on the</p>
<p>so obviously, the value is greater than what the DAO thought it was.</p>
<p>Jason, you&rsquo;re like an accredited investor. This is non accredited investors who are doing this.</p>
<p>I know. And that that unsophistication was clear. The stupidest thing you can do if you enter an</p>
<p>auction, okay, is to declare how you&rsquo;re going to be an underbidder. So like, it&rsquo;s basically saying,</p>
<p>Hey, guys, you know, here&rsquo;s my top tick. And I&rsquo;m willing to be and I can and so now you force these</p>
<p>guys to be the underbidder at $1 over there. That&rsquo;s fine. That&rsquo;s a mechanical issue.</p>
<p>Saks, what do you think?</p>
<p>Well, I wonder, I wonder if the reason why they chose this particular type of asset is because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s collectible, and therefore explicitly excluded from the securities laws. So basically,</p>
<p>you know, that maybe maybe they&rsquo;re limited in terms of what they can go after, because they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be a security. But until but if that&rsquo;s the case, then it does limit, I think the</p>
<p>applicability of DAOs, right? Because what you want is, is to create corporations that are</p>
<p>programmable, that you can have shareholder votes through the tokens, yeah, things like that,</p>
<p>you know, basically a digital version of what they do analog in the real world with,</p>
<p>you know, share certificate, shareholder meetings and stuff like that, that nobody ever attends.</p>
<p>Yeah, that nobody, nobody ever attends each other meetings. And, you know, I get these notices of</p>
<p>votes that are to be held. Nobody ever feels Yeah, no one fills that stuff out.</p>
<p>When people have super share, super voting, and so you feel like you have no say,</p>
<p>but in this case, you do have a say, and they&rsquo;re going to do assets like, imagine somebody had</p>
<p>10,000 acres of rainforest or a national potential National Park. And all of a sudden,</p>
<p>you pop up a DAO. And if the SEC says, you know what, $500 or less, you can bet your money,</p>
<p>however you want, hold on, let me finish. And they take that $500. And you get a million people to put</p>
<p>$500 in which is completely conceivable. Somebody could buy $500 million worth of national forest</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;m going to make this into a public trust to protect the environment. This is on the</p>
<p>brink of changing the world ICOs, you could have the exact same thing. No governance, they had no</p>
<p>governance that was missing. What was the benefit? Hold on ICOs were for the benefit of the scumbags</p>
<p>who did those grifts and ran away with the money. This is an organization with a predetermined</p>
<p>governance structure. This is like creating a new country or a new format for an LLC. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re missing. Okay, are you done? Yes. What you&rsquo;re missing? You&rsquo;re painting the optimistic</p>
<p>scenario of what these things could do. And you&rsquo;re correct. But what&rsquo;s always happened in</p>
<p>the history of humanity is these scenarios have resolved to people figuring out ways to scam</p>
<p>other people to make money. Sure. While this one looks all true, it&rsquo;s just like, let me finish</p>
<p>without interrupting. Thank you. But just like, you know, this looks like a great altruistic</p>
<p>action, we&rsquo;re going to go out and buy the USS Constitution, US Constitution, the next deal</p>
<p>will end up being some shitty art piece that&rsquo;s worth 100 grand, as Chamath points out, they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>buy it for 10 million, everyone will lose their ass. And the next 500 will look the same. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we have securities regulators and security laws. Because in the past, when these</p>
<p>sorts of structures that weren&rsquo;t digitally governed and all this sort of stuff, and people</p>
<p>would go around and they would put together pools of money from other people and promise them the</p>
<p>world. And then they would turn around and steal their money and walk away. We created securities</p>
<p>regulators that could oversee and not have independent governance, but have distributed</p>
<p>governance across a regulatory system to make sure that this doesn&rsquo;t happen. And that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>slippery slope of where this goes. I&rsquo;ll say one more thing about the structure of this particular</p>
<p>Dow, which I know can be resolved, but it creates a problem in that everyone is betting or investing</p>
<p>a fixed dollar amount without knowing how much equity they&rsquo;re getting. And so when you say,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m going to put in $500. And there&rsquo;s currently $10 million, or let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>$10,000 in this thing. It&rsquo;s like, hey, okay, I&rsquo;ve got 5% ownership in this thing.</p>
<p>If the next guy shows up and puts in $10,000, you now have two and a half percent ownership</p>
<p>in this thing. And you&rsquo;ve inflated the value of the thing you&rsquo;re buying. And that&rsquo;s effectively</p>
<p>what happened in the structure of this particular Dow, where the more money people put in,</p>
<p>the more they were paying and the less they were owning. And you couldn&rsquo;t adjust that.</p>
<p>The correct structure in the future for people that do care about equity and ownership will be</p>
<p>I want to buy 1% and I&rsquo;m willing to pay a max of $500 to buy that 1%. And with that rule engine,</p>
<p>which I know can be built into Dow&rsquo;s, people can then structure what they&rsquo;re willing to bid and how</p>
<p>much they&rsquo;re willing to participate in and the Dow as a whole can resolve what it&rsquo;s willing to pay</p>
<p>to go buy an asset. And everyone can feel like they know what they&rsquo;re getting as they get into</p>
<p>these things. And then the third problem with this particular Dow as we saw, and I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of the first big one like this was the obvious point that these guys were showing the</p>
<p>world how much they were about to go bid on this asset. And if you take $46 million and you divide</p>
<p>it by 1.13, or which is, you know, remember, there&rsquo;s a 13% buyers premium on this asset,</p>
<p>they showed everyone what they&rsquo;re going to pay. And of course, they lost at $1 over they were the</p>
<p>they were the underbidder. I&rsquo;ll say something else. The only fractionalized asset that has</p>
<p>ever been proven to appreciate reliably our stocks. Every other fractionalized asset where</p>
<p>you take something and then you divvy it up, generally has been a trash burger,</p>
<p>you need to either own the whole thing yourself. Or if you&rsquo;re going to own it with a bunch of other</p>
<p>people, the only thing that&rsquo;s reliable are equities. Now, that&rsquo;s just a historical artifact</p>
<p>for how money has been made. So I appreciate Jason, what you&rsquo;re saying, which is, I think,</p>
<p>actually, you care about the structure, because I think it has huge implications to people pursuing</p>
<p>wealth creation for themselves for people participating in private markets. But I do</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;re overblowing this one example, because I don&rsquo;t think this showed any of that.</p>
<p>I think that this showed how unreliable and useless Ethereum is as a transactional layer</p>
<p>for these things. You know, the fact that these poor people now have money stuck in a Dow that</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t get out of, because it would the gas fees would negate their contribution. So that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t be the bumps in the road. One second, please, you got to hold on. It didn&rsquo;t prove</p>
<p>governance. Because as David said, we had this inflationary outcome, where all of a sudden,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the equity that I owned. The transparency worked against them, because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bidding on an asset where you were clear about the threshold max price you could pay. So</p>
<p>you had no pricing power, and you had no opacity in your bidding strategy. So. So I think that</p>
<p>this was a PR lark. And in fact, they said it started out as a joke, and it took on a head</p>
<p>of steam. And so I think they felt like they had to execute what I would say is, there are going to</p>
<p>be some really amazing examples of DAOs. This proved none of those things that that the amazing</p>
<p>ones will prove, in my opinion. And this will invite regulatory scrutiny faster than it will</p>
<p>keep it away, right? You will see, you know, more of these scenarios where people get screwed out</p>
<p>of money like they did in this particular case. And I know a lot of everyone that participated</p>
<p>in this down. I know that there&rsquo;s altruistic reasons. Who do they sue? Who do they sue?</p>
<p>Who do they sue? Who do they go after now that they lost the $200 that they contributed?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no structure. And I think that&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>regulatory, you know, how do they get the money? I can respond. Who&rsquo;s the person? Who&rsquo;s the person</p>
<p>that like, you know what, honestly, if that if that DAO had called me, I could have actually</p>
<p>bid for them and actually won that fucking thing for half the price. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So you got anything? You want to chime in?</p>
<p>No. I mean, well, I would like to give a closing. Why don&rsquo;t you go for it?</p>
<p>All right. Number one, you&rsquo;re all speaking like a bunch of rich accredited investors.</p>
<p>We need to think about people who do not get to participate. And what I see in my day job</p>
<p>is people go to an equity crowdfunding site, it&rsquo;s too arduous to allow non accredited investors to</p>
<p>invest, it takes months, and it&rsquo;s tons of paperwork. So then what happens is the best</p>
<p>deal flow, which goes to the people who are on this podcast who are already rich, we get to sweep</p>
<p>up all the best deals. Because people who are founders and who have opportunities in corporations</p>
<p>do not bother doing equity crowdfunding because the SEC in their wisdom to try to protect people</p>
<p>and they have good intent to your point, Friedberg has made it so arduous and painful for people</p>
<p>that they then don&rsquo;t do it the founders I&rsquo;m talking about this then keeps people down.</p>
<p>And when we were all poor, we got to spend our money gambling, or doing whatever we want with</p>
<p>it. But we all would have wanted to have when we were non accredited, the ability to place a bet</p>
<p>on a startup. And y&rsquo;all are forgetting that. And what&rsquo;s gonna happen here, all of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying, all of what you&rsquo;re saying, Chamath, in terms of the problems here are absolutely</p>
<p>accurate and valid. And those are what you need. You need to identify through projects like this,</p>
<p>the gas fees are a problem. So people can move this to Solana, you need to find out that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to do bidding. And maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t say how much has been raised, so that</p>
<p>they can come in and bid more intelligently. And maybe they do need to pick a better target. But</p>
<p>this is $200 per person. There you guys are acting like these people are going to lose their shirts.</p>
<p>We agree with you. I agree with you. I agree with me. I agree 1000%. I&rsquo;m a free markets guy,</p>
<p>I would love for there to be no regulation. And everyone will come in. And the problem is society</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t let that happen. And that&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m trying to make. It&rsquo;s other societies have</p>
<p>other societies. If you&rsquo;re in the UK, if you&rsquo;re in Australia, you can go gamble and you can go</p>
<p>bet on startups. There are different accreditation laws, we have antiquated ones that United States,</p>
<p>the United States regulatory regime will be invoked because people will lose money and</p>
<p>individuals will raise their hand and say I put money into a DAO that I lost my ass on and enough</p>
<p>1000s of people do that. And then Elizabeth Warren and AOC will get on their, you know,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s fix this problem. Bernie Sanders will say this is unfair. The</p>
<p>billionaires are taking the money from people. And so I agree with you, we should let people</p>
<p>take risks, we should let people lose money, we should drop all the regulatory burden.</p>
<p>My point is really that I think structurally, what&rsquo;s going to happen is there are going to</p>
<p>be more of those things that are going to show up that will rip people off. And that will heighten</p>
<p>regulatory interest. And people will come along and they&rsquo;ll start to clamp down on this stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s my point. Okay, I also think this example has nothing to do with what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about. I think what you&rsquo;re talking about J Cal is laudable. And we should all want that</p>
<p>because I think that the broader number of people that get to participate in the wealth creation in</p>
<p>tech, the better. But there are different ways of doing that. I don&rsquo;t think we have to run full</p>
<p>force and embrace the DAO as the only way that that happens. And I think that structurally,</p>
<p>the the the democratic norms inside of a DAO, in many ways make it much harder to govern inside</p>
<p>a regulatory framework. And it does set up a very binary decision by the SEC and US regulators,</p>
<p>which unfortunately, they&rsquo;re not going to go and be supportive of because the binary decision</p>
<p>to support them would effectively negate their oversight. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, they got jobs to keep to, they have jobs to keep.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a cynical and accurate prediction that they will fight it. But what you may not</p>
<p>be aware of is that there is in the startup act from years ago, they did allow equity crowdfunding,</p>
<p>they put a lot of throttling on it. And now they&rsquo;re going to let you get accredited through</p>
<p>taking a course, or like kind of having a driver&rsquo;s license or a gun permit. So it is conceivable that</p>
<p>the next time a DAO happens, and they&rsquo;re trying to buy but can you stop conflating these things</p>
<p>together? You go, we&rsquo;ve had iterations in the crowdfunding rules. You&rsquo;re just trying to tag</p>
<p>this with a DAO. Can can you just separated? Wait, hold on a second. Can I just ask you a</p>
<p>question? Can you please just describe and acknowledge that the crowdfunding rules have</p>
<p>iteratively evolved in the absence of jobs? Yes. Okay, so just separate the two. They&rsquo;re not the</p>
<p>same thing. They are two sides of the same coin because they&rsquo;re not allow a global participation</p>
<p>in this and the capital can be formed instantly. This was done in days. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so powerful</p>
<p>about it. It costs 10s of 1000s to 100s of 1000s of dollars to do an equity crowdfunding. This</p>
<p>costs nothing because it was for a in an ethereal superficial asset with a name that people</p>
<p>recognize. Let me hold on a second. Now let me replace the US Constitution with I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Jason, you just sent a deal a day ago. What was the name of it? Let&rsquo;s just call it acne.com.</p>
<p>Sure. Now what are people supposed to do? It&rsquo;s not a known asset. They are not known</p>
<p>founders. There may be turbulent issues inside the company that are still being hammered out.</p>
<p>What are these people supposed to do? How are they in place a small bet?</p>
<p>Place a small bet, do some research, vote on it, do collective research in a discord.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking you have a bunch of researchers working for you. You defended me. You have a team,</p>
<p>your team does research and they&rsquo;re smart people and they get paid very well. You were praising the</p>
<p>coverage that Wall Street bets did on GME on this podcast 40 episodes ago. You were saying</p>
<p>how incredible their research was because they were analyzing public companies who are governed</p>
<p>by securities law. They can&rsquo;t do that with a private company. Yes, because there are no rules</p>
<p>that govern disclosure. GameStop had very strict disclosure rules because they were public. That</p>
<p>was what allowed Wall Street bets to understand what was going on under the hood of GameStop.</p>
<p>It was the disclosure of the funds that the SECs forced you to make that allowed people to</p>
<p>understand the long and the short book that was building against it. If that was in the private</p>
<p>markets, that data is not obligated to be provided in the wild. Wall Street bets would have had no</p>
<p>idea. I think you&rsquo;re actually proving the opposite of what you intend, which is, it&rsquo;s the regulatory</p>
<p>framework that allowed the retail GME position to happen. Go ahead, David.</p>
<p>Yeah, can I translate what Jekyll saying? I think what Jekyll saying is we need to create some</p>
<p>space here for innovation so that entrepreneurs can work out the kinks of these DAOs so that one</p>
<p>day Jekyll can run a syndicate on a blockchain and fundraise that way. Isn&rsquo;t that what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying? Jekyll or anybody? I mean, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll say. You know, when we do a syndicate amongst</p>
<p>accredited investors, your book here in a weird way. I didn&rsquo;t mention the syndicate. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mention the syndicate.com once except for this as competitors to your syndicates, but now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all on the doubt train. I see I was I, I thought were too big. So I think you could solve this</p>
<p>problem by looking at the bet size that people are allowed to make. So you can just say, Hey,</p>
<p>the upper limit is 5k. So now you&rsquo;ve basically taken the individual cratering? Well, because if</p>
<p>you wanted to create a regulatory environment? Well, because it would be the risk. You create</p>
<p>a de minimis exception. So I see guys, the first 100% worth and 1% of another&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Okay, so make it a percent of net worth. No, the first thing principle of portfolio construction</p>
<p>is you need to be concentrated in the things you know, and you need to stay away from the things</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t if you cap the upside on the amount you can invest. What are people supposed to do</p>
<p>peanut butter around 50 bets? And you know what will happen Jason, most of those will be losers</p>
<p>because the mortality rate in startups is super high. And they&rsquo;ll end up with basically nothing.</p>
<p>How do they do in Vegas? How do they do betting?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about how to invest. I mean, I think what we&rsquo;re saying is that there&rsquo;s that I</p>
<p>mean, this is where I actually agree is that the regulators should carve out enough room so that</p>
<p>innovation can continue around this concept of Dallas because who knows what they could become</p>
<p>one day. And we shouldn&rsquo;t we shouldn&rsquo;t kill this thing. Hold on, we haven&rsquo;t killed anything</p>
<p>because nothing exists. And there are no rules about Dallas. The regulators haven&rsquo;t said anything.</p>
<p>I think we all agree that crowdfunding rules should get much more expensive. That makes sense.</p>
<p>And with that, private companies should disclose more. That makes sense, right? We all agree with</p>
<p>that. So that you can have more disclosure and public available data. So Jason, to your point,</p>
<p>communities can get into a discord like today. If you said, Hey, guys, let&rsquo;s go and analyze a</p>
<p>late stage investment in Stripe. What do you do? blather on about it and just talk at each other?</p>
<p>There are no disclosures. So now, yeah. So now are you supposed to are you supposed to enter</p>
<p>Carta or some other third party platform and buy it at 120 billion? How do you underwrite that?</p>
<p>Very simple, very simple. In the startup DAO concept we&rsquo;re talking about here, you would do</p>
<p>exactly what angel investors do, which is say, Hey, okay, we had, let&rsquo;s say this constitution</p>
<p>DAO was to invest in startups. Okay, 20,000 people put 200 in each, we have a $40 million pool.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re all going to submit ideas. And then we&rsquo;re going to ask and invite those founders to</p>
<p>come pitch the DAO on a zoom. And we&rsquo;ll all vote on which ones we like best. And instead of,</p>
<p>you know, a venture capital firm getting access to this. Now those 20,000 people could say,</p>
<p>you know what, we&rsquo;re going to make 20 half million dollar bets, and then we&rsquo;re going to pour the 30</p>
<p>million into the winners of that. And that is just what I do for a living or any other angel</p>
<p>investor early stage investor does you invite founders come and pitch you and you place an</p>
<p>intelligent bet, just like people bet on the Knicks or sadly on the Jets and lose their money</p>
<p>all the time. And I like David&rsquo;s idea of saying, Hey, maybe for the next two years, we&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>DAO exception where you can raise, you know, from 1000 up to 5000 people up to $10 million. And you</p>
<p>just have to file that you&rsquo;re not a felon. And we have some basic framework to experiment with this</p>
<p>because you could buy, you know, a building that was going to be torn down, like some movie theater</p>
<p>for a community, you could do nonprofit stuff, there&rsquo;s all kinds of beautiful things you could</p>
<p>do with this instant capital formation and government structure that is programmable.</p>
<p>Okay, well, it does relate to capital formation in the startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll say. You made a great point about Uber and Lyft pushing the boundaries and</p>
<p>forcing the regulators to react. Yes. You know why that happened? It&rsquo;s because Uber and Lyft</p>
<p>worked. Yes. And it was successful. And the value was not successful. And so maybe if it is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an on ramp, but I would say that the energy is better served in not focusing on a PR</p>
<p>lark. And probably just focusing on trying to improve the crowdfunding laws writ large,</p>
<p>which are already on the books and can be iterated upon versus an entire new body of regulation,</p>
<p>where nobody even has any idea what a starting point should be.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be I think it&rsquo;d be very hard to get get those crowdfunding laws expanded</p>
<p>under the current regime. It&rsquo;s sort of a minor miracle that they even got what they got</p>
<p>several years ago, right? Wasn&rsquo;t that what happened under Obama when 2008? Yes,</p>
<p>the jobs I was in 2008. When the market crash, we said, nobody&rsquo;s starting companies,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re screwed here, we need to get the economy going again. So we&rsquo;re just going to allow more</p>
<p>capital formation. And so the 99 rule for LLCs went to 250. And they just kind of loosen things</p>
<p>a little bit. And now they&rsquo;re, the mandate is the SEC has to have a certification test</p>
<p>for people to do private market investing. And also people who work at VC firms, right,</p>
<p>we have people who work for us who are not accredited, they don&rsquo;t get to participate,</p>
<p>but they get an exception if they work at a venture firm, etc.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably simultaneously true that this thing was massively overhyped, while also being</p>
<p>the case that it&rsquo;s a worthwhile experiment that may lead to, you know, useful innovation in the</p>
<p>future. What I always look at when I see new technologies doing something is I just imagine</p>
<p>if a 10x and what that would look like, and if it worked, and then I just 10x it one more time.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re going to see, I predict is this $40 million Dow will turn into a 400 million one in</p>
<p>the next two years, and then a 4 billion one in the next 10. And people are going to do something</p>
<p>extraordinary. They&rsquo;re going to do something so otherworldly changing. What if a million people</p>
<p>or 10 million people around the globe decided they were going to put money in to do a solar farm,</p>
<p>or something that would help society can already do that, Jay cow. I mean, that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>like a manager can friction someone&rsquo;s got to someone&rsquo;s got to manage it.</p>
<p>Jay got fantasizing about how big is syndicates going to be? Yeah.</p>
<p>My syndicate is too large right now. I can&rsquo;t accommodate everybody. And it&rsquo;s also because</p>
<p>it could get bigger, right? Well, no, the problem is you can only have 250 people in it. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem. We can&rsquo;t get down to death. Yeah, come on. Yeah, we beat it to death. Anyway, I&rsquo;m obsessed</p>
<p>with it. Fentanyl debts in the US are reaching a crisis point up. Is that really what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about? I mean, we talked about it in the chat. This is trying to like avoid the biggest</p>
<p>news today of the biggest. I get it. We&rsquo;re good. That&rsquo;s just a weird transition. I&rsquo;m just going</p>
<p>straight down through the docket. But if you want to jump the fence, okay. Well, not guilty of all</p>
<p>charges like it happened within half an hour of us beginning to record this podcast. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to keep the Friedberg ratio up. We had a nice strong emotional moment from Friedberg. He</p>
<p>obviously is gonna have something to say about fentanyl and science, but okay, he&rsquo;s gonna walk</p>
<p>off the show now to talk when you start talking. I&rsquo;m not gonna walk up the show did last week,</p>
<p>you walked off, you walked off and when you got a beverage, you left for like, I had to go pee.</p>
<p>All right, fine. I mean, to be during politics, Kyle Rittenhouse. When I take my break. Yeah,</p>
<p>exactly. And a third of the audience, Kyle Rittenhouse found not guilty of all charges.</p>
<p>A 12 person jury in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial reached the decision. After over 26 hours of</p>
<p>deliberation. He shot three people. He killed two of them and he was found not guilty. He was 17 at</p>
<p>the time of the shooting was charged with killing the two men and a third during the protests in</p>
<p>Kenosha, Wisconsin in August of 2020. This was during the protests over the police shooting of</p>
<p>Jacob Blake. He claims he traveled from Illinois with an ar 15 style rifle to help protect</p>
<p>businesses and provide first aid. He didn&rsquo;t. He did not cross state lines with the rifle. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the many inaccuracies that have been reported by the media over and over again,</p>
<p>because his dad lived there. I guess he was in his dad lived in Kenosha. I think he went to</p>
<p>school in Kenosha. He worked in Kenosha. You got to understand like this is there are a few minutes</p>
<p>apart were from his mother&rsquo;s house. And he never he never carried the gun across state lines.</p>
<p>The gun was bought from by a friend who was 18 who could possess it and it was kept at his house,</p>
<p>which is in Kenosha. Got it. He was apparently in Kenosha earlier that day. And, you know,</p>
<p>cleaning up graffiti at the school and checking out the downtown. And then, you know, obviously,</p>
<p>when he went out that night, then he got the gun, but he didn&rsquo;t transport it across state lines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, one of the multiple</p>
<p>What is your most important insight into this case</p>
<p>and what it represents for American society and the justice system, sax?</p>
<p>Well, I think the case has become a little bit of a Rorschach test of how you see America. I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s clearly a group of people in the I&rsquo;d say the main dominated the mainstream media</p>
<p>announced percolated down to celebrities and figures from LeBron James to, to</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spacing, but there&rsquo;s a lot of like celebrities who&rsquo;ve come out putting forward this view that</p>
<p>America that this trial somehow is that that Cal were in the house of white supremacists and that</p>
<p>this not guilty verdict is an example of white supremacy in America. Somehow that became the</p>
<p>narrative. And so that I think it&rsquo;s become I think there&rsquo;s like a couple levels to it. One</p>
<p>is the trial itself and what you think about the legal case. I don&rsquo;t think that is that complicated</p>
<p>or interesting. You have here that the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt</p>
<p>that Rittenhouse did not act reasonably in self-defense when three violent attackers came</p>
<p>charging towards him. That was, I think, a pretty tough case to make given</p>
<p>One of them had a gun, Paul, too. I mean, this was</p>
<p>Right. And so all of them had long criminal histories. The first one who attacked him</p>
<p>was daring him to said that he was going to kill Rittenhouse. The second one was bashing him over</p>
<p>the head with a skateboard. The third one was rushing towards him when Rittenhouse was on the</p>
<p>ground, had a gun trained on him, looked like he was going to bring it to his head kind of</p>
<p>execution style. I mean, all these, I think, cases, if you saw the video from the first time,</p>
<p>it seemed pretty clear that he had a strong claim of self-defense. So I don&rsquo;t think the case itself</p>
<p>was that legally interesting. The question is why it got blown up into being this like huge thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really because the media wanted this so badly to be to feed into this narrative of somehow</p>
<p>that this is, you know, a white supremacist, violent attacker, who was a vigilante who</p>
<p>crossed state lines with this AR-15 to go seek out trouble, to confront people at the protests.</p>
<p>And, you know, that case that that narrative just completely fell apart at the trial.</p>
<p>You know, he didn&rsquo;t cross state lines, you know, in that way. He didn&rsquo;t, you know, with the gun.</p>
<p>When he went to this protest, he went there. It&rsquo;s interesting. I mean, he was a cadet,</p>
<p>an EMT cadet. He was kind of in this like junior firefighter program. I&rsquo;m not saying that he showed</p>
<p>good judgment. I think it was poor judgment for him to try and insert himself into that situation.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think he went there to kill anyone or to get into a confrontation. He brought a</p>
<p>first aid kit for, you know, for better or worse, he thought he was going to help people.</p>
<p>And so any event that the story really is about the media constructing this narrative</p>
<p>that fell apart so quickly, as soon as all the facts came out.</p>
<p>Freiberg, Jamal?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the I read that there was an analysis of the media</p>
<p>and how they tried to portray this. And that I think I&rsquo;ll build on what David said, which is</p>
<p>was really concerning, like the there was, they really wanted this to be a white kid who killed</p>
<p>black people during a BLM protest, which was, as it turned out, the furthest from the truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you my experience when I first saw it. That&rsquo;s what I thought I had read.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be really honest with you. Initially, I was incredibly biased. And my I had a violent</p>
<p>reaction inside me of anger towards this kid. Because my thought was my God, this white kid</p>
<p>showed up at a Black Lives Matter rally and killed, you know, three of my brothers, you know,</p>
<p>like, literally, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m feeling. I was so angry, because they didn&rsquo;t really give the facts.</p>
<p>There was an example where in Germany, it got so out of hand that the articles were written</p>
<p>that Kyle Rittenhouse had actually killed three black men or two black men. And I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very dangerous, because we need to have the truth and the facts so we can really figure</p>
<p>out what&rsquo;s going on, so that we can address what&rsquo;s broken. We can hold people accountable.</p>
<p>And then we can move forward together and heal it. But this like is the opposite of healing,</p>
<p>it just froths people up to make a lot of judgments with misinformation. And I think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s very unfair. I didn&rsquo;t, to be honest with you, after I saw the facts,</p>
<p>I stopped paying attention to this case, because I literally exhaled.</p>
<p>I would have been much more hurt. And I would have probably paid more attention.</p>
<p>If this wasn&rsquo;t white on white violence, quite honestly.</p>
<p>Right, right. And I think people, I think we&rsquo;ve heard from a lot of people over when Rittenhouse</p>
<p>his testimony kind of went viral and started getting reported on, there were a lot of people</p>
<p>out there who were surprised to learn that all the victims were white, that this was an example</p>
<p>of white on white violence, because it had been portrayed by the media as some sort of racial</p>
<p>episode. And, and it wasn&rsquo;t, and it shows how the media is fueling this polarization</p>
<p>and rage in our society by concocting these narratives, which aren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that that I think is the dangerous thing. I didn&rsquo;t follow the case to know whether</p>
<p>this kid was right or wrong. But I do think if the media uses these opportunities to not</p>
<p>just tell the facts, and then race baits people on both the left and the right and</p>
<p>gets them frothed up, they&rsquo;re doing a real disservice to America, because I think it</p>
<p>takes good people. And it puts them in a state, like me for a while at the beginning where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I was really angry, and I didn&rsquo;t know how I felt. And that&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;m a lucid person. You know,</p>
<p>99.999%. And so it just goes to show you how dangerous this stuff is when they can take a</p>
<p>narrative and run with it, and then there&rsquo;s no accountability for it. And we really have to stop</p>
<p>and check ourselves. It just speaks to this ongoing fact pattern where the media is at a</p>
<p>point where they are at a very much a low point in their trustworthiness, their ability to fact</p>
<p>check their ability to stick to the truth. I think it&rsquo;s been undone. Just this past week,</p>
<p>you know, I think Elon even tweeted out like, you know, he in exasperation, he said,</p>
<p>where can I find? Like thoughtful news, right? He was asking Twitter, like, what websites and,</p>
<p>and the question wasn&rsquo;t that bad. But if you read the answers, it was really sad. Nobody had a good</p>
<p>answer. You know, one person was like, oh, there&rsquo;s a browser extension that will show you how you</p>
<p>know, how much lying is happening inside the article. And I thought to myself, my god, like,</p>
<p>there are browser extensions, like a lie ometer, you know, like, this is insanity that,</p>
<p>that in 2021, that&rsquo;s what we are faced with, which is very smart people, all of us,</p>
<p>everybody listening, normal people just, you know, out on the street, we can all come to the right</p>
<p>conclusion when given the facts, and we&rsquo;re not given the facts anymore.</p>
<p>Jake, how do you think we&rsquo;re missing something here? Because</p>
<p>you, you, I know, you thought that this whole written house thing was crazy, right? Which it</p>
<p>was, but I think, first off, violent protests, and violence is immoral. And all of these protests,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s BLM, on the left, on the right, they should all be non violent. There&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>Martin Luther King and Gandhi, you know, said, that&rsquo;s the rules. If you want to come to the</p>
<p>protests, you have to be non violent. And then I think the rhetoric that was created during the</p>
<p>Trump era, and that he exacerbated and that he caused from a lot of his policies and the way he</p>
<p>spoke as the leader of the free world in our country, then polarize things, I blame him for a</p>
<p>lot of that. And if you put a bunch of people who are on the far extremes into a situation like this,</p>
<p>and then you insert guns, and you insert young people who have not developed their frontal lobes,</p>
<p>who do not have long term thinking, which is 17 year old does not your long term in</p>
<p>free bird will back me up on this in terms of science, long term thinking is something that</p>
<p>develops in humans into their early 20s. And so young people with guns in a violent situation</p>
<p>with Trump on TV during this time, both good people on both sides, whatever, you know, the</p>
<p>borders, all that stuff that he was stirring the pot on, all of that eventually resolves to</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s gonna get killed, whether it&rsquo;s on January 6, or it&rsquo;s a BLM protest. And that is why</p>
<p>he had such a failure of leadership while he was so disgusting and horrible and lonesome,</p>
<p>because he was taking all of this heat and rhetoric up, up, up. And the person who winds</p>
<p>up suffering in this are these stupid kids. And they&rsquo;re really dumb parents and mother who</p>
<p>allow them to go to a protest and she could have stopped him with a gun. Somebody needs to stop</p>
<p>these kids from going to a protest with a gun. And I think there&rsquo;s a very difficult question here</p>
<p>that can be asked. And it probably is true. I think that it was an open and shut case, David,</p>
<p>that, I mean, I saw the video as well, Chamath, the guy puts a gun on him, what are you gonna do,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a gun, this guy&rsquo;s pointing a gun at you, whoever fires first survives, it is self</p>
<p>defense. And that&rsquo;s kind of undeniable, I think. But I would hope that the number of people that</p>
<p>really focus on this case, look at the innumerable number of cases of black and brown people that</p>
<p>have been killed. The Ahmaud Arbery trial is going on right now. Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen one article in Ahmaud Arbery for every 50 about Kyle Rittenhouse. Yeah, I just really hope</p>
<p>Ahmaud Arbery gets his fair trial. And let me say again, Brianna Taylor, not a single thing has</p>
<p>still been done. Okay. So I&rsquo;m not that sympathetic to all of this talk right now. Because there are</p>
<p>a lot of black and brown men and women who have been killed in this country, where none of you</p>
<p>guys care as much. Oh, I care. And that was exactly where I was about to get to the question</p>
<p>I was about to ask you, Chamath, is if Kyle Rittenhouse had been a black man, and he had</p>
<p>shot those three people, what would the outcome of this trial have been? Would it have been the</p>
<p>same justice system? And I don&rsquo;t think that anybody can answer that question and say it would</p>
<p>have been fair justice. I don&rsquo;t think it would have been I think the chance would be very low.</p>
<p>Just you saying it makes me want to cry. Okay. It would not I didn&rsquo;t say for that reason. But</p>
<p>it is the truth. And I think that&rsquo;s what you know, we in this country, race is something that is our</p>
<p>biggest weak point. And we need to get well, to work on this hypothetical injustice. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know because that&rsquo;s a hypothetical that we can&rsquo;t know the answer to right now. And you&rsquo;re ignoring</p>
<p>the justice, the injustice that&rsquo;s right in front of your face, which is that this was a political</p>
<p>prosecution from the beginning, fueled by a media narrative that was completely bogus.</p>
<p>This is why I think David is right. And we have to go to this root cause issue that we can all fix.</p>
<p>You know, we can&rsquo;t we shouldn&rsquo;t debate these hypotheticals because they&rsquo;re hurtful. Like even</p>
<p>now, like you&rsquo;ve seen me, I&rsquo;m emotional. I can&rsquo;t think straight. So let&rsquo;s get the hypothetical off</p>
<p>the table. Because David, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s a hypothetical. I mean, this case probably should</p>
<p>never this case should never have been brought. I mean, as soon as you see the video, if you look</p>
<p>up the definition of self defense, okay, you just have to have a reasonable belief that your life is</p>
<p>in danger. And then you&rsquo;re allowed to use force. And you know, Rittenhouse was running away.</p>
<p>These guys were attacking him. They were chasing after him. They had a gun trained on him. They were</p>
<p>bashing him on the head with a skateboard. I don&rsquo;t know how any prosecutor looks at this and says,</p>
<p>we need to prosecute this. So the case should never have been brought. And then the media</p>
<p>fuels this thing. But this is what I&rsquo;m saying. That&rsquo;s the thing that we can all change, which</p>
<p>is our reaction to that media portrayal. The media can be held accountable for how they lie.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>Well, people don&rsquo;t trust them. And they&rsquo;re tuning them out. And they&rsquo;re going and finding their own</p>
<p>But I mean, this has been my point. Like, I think we all get tuned up to what the media</p>
<p>quote, unquote, is and isn&rsquo;t saying. I think that&rsquo;s like yesteryear&rsquo;s news. I mean, those</p>
<p>those guys have lost credibility. You can see it in all the peer research and all the Gallup research</p>
<p>that what used to be called and it&rsquo;s still by a lot of people called the mainstream media</p>
<p>is no longer mainstream. And it&rsquo;s become kind of outskirt and where people are finding</p>
<p>their, their sources of information is direct from the source, from people that they know to</p>
<p>be reliable, trustworthy speakers of the truth and speakers of facts. And they&rsquo;re getting them</p>
<p>direct through social media platforms and other systems of self publication. And that the idea</p>
<p>of having centralized media systems that get to have their own editorial and narrative over whatever</p>
<p>facts quote, they may be kind of gathering and presenting to us. That&rsquo;s an old school way of</p>
<p>doing things. And I don&rsquo;t think we have to worry about it too much anymore. Whether or not</p>
<p>individuals will resolve to truth seeking or emotion seeking is the big question for the</p>
<p>21st century. Because as we&rsquo;ve seen the media that the things that we do click on are the</p>
<p>things that we already believe and that confirm our bias and that create an emotional incentive</p>
<p>versus the things that may be not what we believe and not what we want to hear,</p>
<p>but may actually be factual. And that&rsquo;s the big kind of challenging question here. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>less about these evil media people. And it&rsquo;s more about where individuals going to make choices.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;d say alternative media voices have never been more important. And, you know,</p>
<p>you can get a lot of them on sub stack people like Glenn Greenwald, Matt, Antonio Garcia,</p>
<p>Martinez, Colin, Colin, Colin, Barry Weiss. I mean, they all had very good coverage of this.</p>
<p>By the way, I couldn&rsquo;t help notice that the same week that this Rittenhouse narrative collapsed,</p>
<p>the whole Steele dossier narrative collapsed. You had, and I don&rsquo;t want to get too political</p>
<p>and drag it back to the Trump thing, but you had, you know, John Durham is a special prosecutor</p>
<p>unraveling this whole phony fake Steele dossier with multiple indictments. And you now have</p>
<p>retractions by the Washington Post and other major publications. And that whole narrative</p>
<p>that fueled like an entire year of media coverage is completely collapsing. And it&rsquo;s just another</p>
<p>example of, you know, the media running with these narratives that turn out to be completely</p>
<p>I hate to use the word fake, but I mean, it is I mean, it&rsquo;s things that were fake,</p>
<p>but Paul Manafort. Again, I would encourage everyone to stop using the term the media or</p>
<p>even the term mainstream media and just recognize that there are specific outlets that are on their</p>
<p>way down and dying. Yeah, these are content companies that need ratings. They used to be</p>
<p>the monopoly and they&rsquo;re no longer. And you know, they&rsquo;re like yesteryear&rsquo;s news. And it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like complaining about, you know, whatever, pick any industry that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>disrupted, but they are and will be further disrupted by kind of direct to source</p>
<p>fact gathering. The big ultimate question is what are consumers going to choose?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing that scares me the most, to be honest, I think they can go either way,</p>
<p>you can either find better truth seeking, or you can find better emotion, more emotion seeking,</p>
<p>and that that&rsquo;s going to cause more polarization and more ugly shit.</p>
<p>Well, look, it&rsquo;s happening right now. You&rsquo;re right that the let&rsquo;s call it the corporate media,</p>
<p>the big media corporations, their prestige and esteem and the eyes American people have</p>
<p>and their credibility has never been lower. It&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>New York Times and CNN.</p>
<p>Absolutely. I mean, just gone. And people should be questioning them and stop listening to them.</p>
<p>And you have to diversify your information diet. And you got to be subscribed to some</p>
<p>alternative journalists on places like Substack. But here&rsquo;s the thing that concerns me. You know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the media narrative being dictated by MSNBC, and then it trickles down to LeBron</p>
<p>James and Chelsea Handler. Sorry, that was the name that I forgot earlier. They were perpetuating</p>
<p>this white supremacist narrative around Kyle Rittenhouse. By the way, they looked at his phone,</p>
<p>his text messages, everything. There is no connection. There&rsquo;s no proof whatsoever of</p>
<p>a connection between him and white supremacy. It was completely made up by the media.</p>
<p>And yet these major figures in our culture who have this outsized impact,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re tweeting about this. And so the problem is, you know, like people like us diversify our</p>
<p>information diet, but there are large parts of the country that are just receiving this information.</p>
<p>And it gets basically passed down from the media to Hollywood to the culture.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>From Tucker Carlson to Scott Baio to the pillow guy.</p>
<p>It is fueling tremendous divisiveness and polarization in our culture. And I would say</p>
<p>that, you know, JC brought up Trump, and he was a polarizing figure, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>root cause of this polarization. I think he is a reaction to it. I think&hellip;</p>
<p>He is a manifestation of it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a manifestation of it. And ultimately, the root cause is the complete deterioration</p>
<p>and collapse of journalistic standards in the media, in the major mainstream corporate media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll disagree with you on that.</p>
<p>I think Trump&rsquo;s responsible for his own behavior.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve made this point in the past, which is, Sax, I don&rsquo;t know if it&hellip;</p>
<p>You make it sound and other people make it sound like in a directed editorial initiative</p>
<p>to take things in a direction. And I think that the reaction process is really about</p>
<p>what do consumers want to consume? What they choose to consume is what they sell</p>
<p>more of and what they produce more of. And that&rsquo;s the cycle that&rsquo;s driving this.</p>
<p>And, you know, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that these folks are not complicit or not</p>
<p>making good kind of ethical decisions. That could actually be argued either way.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, they&rsquo;re businesses that are selling content.</p>
<p>And if consumers want content of one form, they&rsquo;re going to choose that form.</p>
<p>Okay, look, I think you have a point that once a publication goes in a certain direction and</p>
<p>starts getting subscribers, there&rsquo;s some positive reinforcement there that helps</p>
<p>them keep pushing in that direction. That being said, I don&rsquo;t think this is commercial in nature,</p>
<p>primarily. I think what&rsquo;s going on is fundamentally ideological. You saw,</p>
<p>for example, the New York Times, they ran out Barry Weiss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it. I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve run out of multiple editors.</p>
<p>No, no, you&rsquo;re wrong on this.</p>
<p>They did this because they wanted subscriptions.</p>
<p>No, no, you&rsquo;re wrong, Sax. When the New York Times did this, they realized Fox picked a side,</p>
<p>MSNBC picked a side, and they benefited from that by picking a side in the Trump era.</p>
<p>So the New York Times picked a side, they went MSNBC side, and they got rid of the</p>
<p>right because the right people drove away the anti-Trump subscription.</p>
<p>So I think Freeberg&rsquo;s right on this one. I will say another thing to build on what</p>
<p>you were saying before, Sax, about the media&rsquo;s responsibility here.</p>
<p>We also have to think about the cable news media&rsquo;s responsibility when they put these protests on</p>
<p>wall to wall, and they send people there. That then inspires people to go there.</p>
<p>When you do this wall to wall coverage across five networks, and you obsess over something,</p>
<p>people are going to obsess over it. They see people out there rioting,</p>
<p>and people model other people&rsquo;s behavior. I think they need to think, how much coverage</p>
<p>do we exactly have to give this riot? Right. Even now, they&rsquo;re bringing out</p>
<p>the National Guard in anticipation of possibly riots and protests in reaction to-</p>
<p>Which then could induce it. Well, in reaction, no, I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to induce it, but in reaction to this verdict in the Rittenhouse trial,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bringing out the troops to basically quell any, you know, riot before it gets started.</p>
<p>But why would that riot even happen? Because the people have been fed this narrative</p>
<p>that is completely bogus. And in that sense, the media has been incredibly irresponsible,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re playing with fire. They really are. I&rsquo;ll say it again,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve fallen into this same trap. Look how much time we&rsquo;ve just been talking about</p>
<p>Cal Rittenhouse. I mentioned Ahmaud Arbery, and we&rsquo;ve just glossed over it.</p>
<p>Is his trial being- It&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>No, no, but is it on video? Because that is another major issue here, is when the trials</p>
<p>are on video- These trials, they should never do TV again</p>
<p>on these trials. Just never again. I mean- It really does create-</p>
<p>You can have reporters in the courtroom, but do not put it on TV.</p>
<p>Like, Varanos is not allowing video in the courtroom, and it&rsquo;s not getting covered to</p>
<p>this extent. And I think the video in the courtroom does drive this-</p>
<p>It makes it a circus. Breaking news, Citadel CEO Ken Griffin</p>
<p>outbid a group of crypto investors for a copy of the US Constitution, according to the Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>We knew somebody was trolling the crypto- He was a villain before this, but now-</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh. Remember for Payment for Order Flow?</p>
<p>Exactly. I mean, he was the central villain,</p>
<p>basically, in that whole Robin Hood fiasco for Payment for Order Flow. And now he outbid</p>
<p>the crypto crowd. He is going to be enemy number one.</p>
<p>Basically, there is no more sophisticated market participant than Ken Griffin.</p>
<p>And on a silver platter, this group of people, unfortunately-</p>
<p>Told him what they&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>Showed them their strategy, and showed them exactly how to become the-</p>
<p>He did the prices right. He put $1 on top of their bid.</p>
<p>You know what Ken Griffin knows? Ken Griffin knows that now this is an object of interest</p>
<p>that people are basically willing to pay anything for.</p>
<p>Bingo. He&rsquo;s going to buy it now,</p>
<p>and in one year, he&rsquo;ll sell it for twice as much. It&rsquo;s a valuable asset.</p>
<p>By the way, I want to make a point on this.</p>
<p>I disagree, by the way. He&rsquo;s a buyer. He is not a seller.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to hold. Okay. But look, markets don&rsquo;t work with this much transparency. Markets only</p>
<p>work when people have different information than other people that are participating in the market.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>If everyone knew everything that everyone else was going to do-</p>
<p>Same data, but if everyone knew what everyone else-</p>
<p>Different opinions.</p>
<p>But if everyone knew everyone else&rsquo;s opinion on what something is worth,</p>
<p>the market doesn&rsquo;t work. And that&rsquo;s the problem that happened here.</p>
<p>Yeah. So here&rsquo;s what I value an asset at.</p>
<p>And now if you know that, you know how to play against me in the market.</p>
<p>And I will point out-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I said.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. And one thing I&rsquo;ll take note of that I kind of realized yesterday when I</p>
<p>was thinking about this, which is this like transparency in markets leads to this inflationary</p>
<p>problem. Why do you think everything that the government buys inflates? Because everyone</p>
<p>already knows what the government is going to spend on that thing. When the government</p>
<p>enters into a market like healthcare or education or defense, the amount that they&rsquo;re going to spend</p>
<p>is published in a bill. And then Congress says, here&rsquo;s your authorized budget. Here&rsquo;s how much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to spend. So there is no natural market force that says a bid and an ask, what</p>
<p>are you willing to pay? And is there a walkaway price? There is no walkaway price when the</p>
<p>government is told to go spend some amount of money. And as a result, the price of everything</p>
<p>inflates to that walkaway to that price to that budget.</p>
<p>Can I build on that? It&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s, in my opinion, based on everything I&rsquo;ve looked at,</p>
<p>the primary reason for the increase in education costs, because the government</p>
<p>funds all the student loans, the increase in healthcare, the increase in defense,</p>
<p>all of it is because the government is the customer and they tell the person that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>servicing them upfront, they tell the market what they&rsquo;re willing to pay. And so the market</p>
<p>just inflates to that amount. And it&rsquo;s really the reason why the way that we budget things</p>
<p>and the government as opposed to saying, look, this is the ROI metric, or this is the IRR metric</p>
<p>you need to be shooting for with this government spending. It&rsquo;s all based on a fixed dollar amount</p>
<p>of a budget that says here&rsquo;s how much you should go spend.</p>
<p>Well, look, it&rsquo;s as I said, it&rsquo;s actually worse than that, because then the procurement process</p>
<p>is not is the furthest thing from a free market where you essentially have these licensed people</p>
<p>that are allowed to provide services. And so if you actually have the key critical input to making</p>
<p>something possible, you have to get bundled in through contractors and subcontractors and general</p>
<p>contractors who each take their five and 10%. And then that&rsquo;s what you would that&rsquo;s when you have</p>
<p>like, you know, and their hourly costs all balloon just a little bit, just a little bit,</p>
<p>just a little bit. And suddenly, the balloon cost of everything matches exactly the budget.</p>
<p>So the perfect example of this is the space program. There was a there was a there was a</p>
<p>rant by Bernie Sanders yesterday, basically saying, How could we have allowed Jeff Bezos,</p>
<p>Mr. Bezos, and Mr. Musk, to basically take over our national space program, we need to</p>
<p>buy a space program, we need to take it back. And then somebody, hold on. And then somebody,</p>
<p>and then somebody thought I&rsquo;ll give me this round somebody thoughtfully went back and actually look</p>
<p>because again, as David said, everything is transparently published. They went back and</p>
<p>they actually counted how much money NASA spent in like the last seven or eight years,</p>
<p>and the number was 360 odd billion dollars. Yeah. And then they counted how much money</p>
<p>SpaceX had spent. And it was, you know, if you counted revenue between seven and 11 billion,</p>
<p>totally, totally. So you have this incredible disparity, which speaks to this.</p>
<p>After the space shuttle was retired, NASA didn&rsquo;t even have a way to get to space until</p>
<p>SpaceX had the rockets. I mean, and think about how many people died on the space.</p>
<p>But Bernie is saying, which is what&rsquo;s I think scary to me is if you take the difference between</p>
<p>360 billion and seven, so 300, and, you know, $53 billion, and divided by the number of people in</p>
<p>the United States, you&rsquo;re basically talking about 1000 person $1,000 a person, would you and I</p>
<p>sit around a table and give Bernie Sanders $1,000 out of our own pocket? I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>to go and basically implement of a half assed base program. No, I&rsquo;d rather I&rsquo;d rather give</p>
<p>Elon Musk 10 cents, which are one cent, which is the equivalent alternative, or this raises</p>
<p>a really serious issue, which is who is the better capital allocator of society, private markets,</p>
<p>or the government. And let me give you an example. So today, the house is voting out that</p>
<p>reconciliation bill, they&rsquo;ve got it, they&rsquo;re spending 2.1 trillion. This is one example,</p>
<p>does one example that caught my eye is they&rsquo;ve got $2.5 billion going to tree equity, whatever</p>
<p>that is. I&rsquo;m sorry, tree, tree, equity, tree, equity, this is like tree equity, I think it</p>
<p>might mean that like some communities, I think it means that some, some communities have more</p>
<p>trees and others, they got to rectify that. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, this is like the jump the</p>
<p>shark moment for the word equity, because I think now everything is equity. But, but you know,</p>
<p>what struck me about this $2.5 billion number, okay, is that like craft ventures, which I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing for the last four years, we&rsquo;ve raised and we&rsquo;ll be deploying a total of about 2 billion</p>
<p>over call it five years into hundreds of startups that you know, will pave the way for the next</p>
<p>generation of the economy. So 2 billion versus two and a half billion as one line item. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a footnote. That&rsquo;s an asterisk in this bill. I mean, what is the better capital allocation</p>
<p>decision and what people have to understand is, you know, all this money that gets spent gets</p>
<p>sucked out of the private economy, somehow, it either, you know, comes from taxes, or gets added</p>
<p>to the national debt. But either way, it comes out of the private economy and resources that</p>
<p>could be allocated to the next generation of innovative companies, squandering the money</p>
<p>like that on all these programs that nobody even knows what they do, when we&rsquo;re almost 30 trillion</p>
<p>in debt is just unbelievable. Okay, the 1% are going to be going to space and taking away the</p>
<p>moon from the other 99%. Here, roll the clip. Unbelievably, this bill would provide and</p>
<p>authorize some $10 billion in taxpayer money to Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in America,</p>
<p>for his space race with Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in America. This is beyond laughable,</p>
<p>and I will be introducing an amendment to strike this provision. Frankly, it is not acceptable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an issue that we have discussed terribly much, but it is not acceptable that the two</p>
<p>wealthiest people in this country, Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos, take control of our space efforts</p>
<p>to return to the moon, and maybe even the extraordinary accomplishment of getting to the</p>
<p>moon. This is not something for two billionaires to be directing. This is something for the American</p>
<p>people to be determining. Yeah, all the people have to be able to go to the moon before two</p>
<p>people can go to the moon. Is that the idea? Yeah, if there was a go to the moon Dow, it would get</p>
<p>more funding. Good callback. Look at you in the callbacks, Freiburg. You&rsquo;re learning how to entertain the audience.</p>
<p>People would just plow money into a go to the moon Dow and give it all to Elon Musk.</p>
<p>More people would do that than would vote to support the Senate bill.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would like to report that Starlink does not work at my lake house,</p>
<p>and Amazon Prime takes three to four days at my beach house on the Cape,</p>
<p>and that these two companies are oppressing the three percent of the top three percent,</p>
<p>which I am not part of the one percent. And some people don&rsquo;t have enough trees.</p>
<p>And in my community, there&rsquo;s only small trees and we want the redwoods from San Francisco.</p>
<p>Why do they or the hippies get the redwoods that are much taller?</p>
<p>Do you guys remember? One of our very earliest pods, I made a statement, which is equity is</p>
<p>this danger word that the progressive left uses to steal power. Yes, that we should feel unsafe.</p>
<p>We should always want equality, but not equity because equity is zero sum, right? You know,</p>
<p>cap table, once you give somebody else equity, it&rsquo;s dilutive to everybody else. But equality</p>
<p>is infinite. You can have unbounded equality. Yes. And when I hear these guys talk about this</p>
<p>stuff, it&rsquo;s so scary. The second thing is, I&rsquo;m a little confused by what Bernie saying,</p>
<p>because on the one hand, he wants to cancel the American government&rsquo;s effective, you know,</p>
<p>support of these programs. On the other hand, he wants us to take back the responsibility for it.</p>
<p>But I think he must realize that it would cost 50 times more, or 100 times more.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s not spending sensitive in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed.</p>
<p>I also think this is like virtue signaling, like, he was attacking Bezos about like minimum wage,</p>
<p>and then Bezos came over the top and like doubled it and then gave people college education. That</p>
<p>was Bernie Sanders platform for president was like, give people free college and give people</p>
<p>like a better $15 minimum wage. Bezos has done more for Bernie&rsquo;s platform than anybody. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>should be thanking. He should be telling people, all companies should be also like Amazon.</p>
<p>No, no, but also actually, to your point, can I build on that? Yeah, Amazon is now doing more</p>
<p>to actually unwind duopolies and monopolies in markets than the government and the FTC is,</p>
<p>you know, see this thing that Amazon is now doing in the UK with visa, where they basically shut</p>
<p>visa off. And people are speculating now that it&rsquo;s a step in this direction of Amazon, you know,</p>
<p>in Amazon domestically in the United States, they just did this big deal with a firm. And so they</p>
<p>are looking at and they there&rsquo;s a rumor that they may switch the Amazon credit card off of visa</p>
<p>rails and put them on MasterCard rails. But there&rsquo;s this another example, Jason, to your point</p>
<p>of like, you know, Bernie and the left progressive left would probably rail against the duopoly</p>
<p>practices of visa and MasterCard. They can&rsquo;t get anything done. Jeff Bezos has actually done more</p>
<p>presses a button and has done more now. Here&rsquo;s another one to build on yours. Who&rsquo;s doing I mean,</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders cares about global warming. It&rsquo;s like one of his key issues who&rsquo;s donated more to</p>
<p>global warming than Jeff Bezos. Nobody nobody who&rsquo;s doing 100,000 electric vehicles for his</p>
<p>delivery fleet. Jeff Bezos Jeff Bezos took Bernie Sanders platform that he failed to get into office</p>
<p>on and he made it Amazon&rsquo;s platform. Here&rsquo;s a third example, Nick, you tweeted this out, Nick,</p>
<p>or you can find this thing that I tweeted out, but it was a little mean. And it was it was,</p>
<p>it was basically Toby Maguire and Kristen Dunst, right? There&rsquo;s a meme upside down quit.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re looking at each other. And basically, the joke is like, you know,</p>
<p>every time you protested at, you know, to shut down a nuclear plant, the resulting effect 40</p>
<p>years later was another 100 megatons of co2 was put into the air. And it just goes to yet again,</p>
<p>another example of we virtue signal nuclear reactors and nuclear power, we go and we get</p>
<p>them all shut down. It turned out that we ingested or we we put out as a result, an enormous amount</p>
<p>of more co2 than had to be put. And then and now who&rsquo;s helping to step in and solve it. Another</p>
<p>private citizen Bill Gates. Look, if it weren&rsquo;t for these private companies, we couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>get astronauts to space anymore. Impossible. I mean, like the government has actually lost</p>
<p>the capacity to do that. Impossible. It would have been impossible. And who are we up against</p>
<p>for space? I mean, China, China, just China. It&rsquo;s such a dichotomy between and this is like</p>
<p>a recurring theme of the show between what the private sector and specifically and not like</p>
<p>the fortune 500. Not those old stodgy companies are in the process of being disrupted, but</p>
<p>what the sort of entrepreneurial economy is able to accomplish versus like how stultified and</p>
<p>calcified and incompetent the government&rsquo;s become.</p>
<p>I mean, to your point, Freiburg, I think Sam Altman led this, the fusion energy startup</p>
<p>helium like $500 million round. I mean, by the time these nitwits, you know, in these political</p>
<p>office, figure these things out, we&rsquo;re gonna have fusion reactors, aren&rsquo;t we? Is that real science?</p>
<p>Is that coming close? What do you think, Rupert?</p>
<p>I mean, Bill Gates just did this. What is it called TerraPower announcement this week.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a company that he&rsquo;s been funding for years, and they&rsquo;re building a 500 megawatt</p>
<p>fusion plant in Wyoming, I think. Yeah.</p>
<p>In Wyoming, yes.</p>
<p>In Wyoming, and he got 2 billion from the government and 2 billion that was funded by</p>
<p>the company and its shareholders, which I think is majority owned by Bill Gates.</p>
<p>But it certainly feels and seems to me, I mean, look, this one, like we&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>a lot of these infrastructure deals, these big infrastructure deals for things like</p>
<p>power and next gen manufacturing and whatnot, you know, could benefit from the boost of,</p>
<p>you know, government subsidies or, you know, government shared costs to get these things</p>
<p>off the ground. Over time, as you get scale and reproducibility of them, the cost per unit comes</p>
<p>way, way, way, way down. And so, you know, it seems to be the case that there are enough of</p>
<p>these programs, I think, I know of at least half a dozen nuclear power companies that are,</p>
<p>you know, in advanced stages of doing, you know, first installation design right now.</p>
<p>And so, it seems like this is going to be a reality. I think it would be an incredible</p>
<p>boom to clean energy in the United States and globally, if we can get more of these built.</p>
<p>I mean, what was the stat? China&rsquo;s building 150 nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve commissioned 150 nuclear power plants. I mean, it&rsquo;s a no brainer</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what we need. In the 21st century, it&rsquo;s the best renewable source,</p>
<p>very small footprint, very reliable can run 24 seven doesn&rsquo;t depend on some, you know,</p>
<p>sun or wind or what have you. So you can plug it into a grid.</p>
<p>And so the government literally does not need to get involved in this,</p>
<p>aside from writing a check and chopping it up 5050 split the pot with</p>
<p>Bill Gates an important role that the government can and should play here, which is, you know,</p>
<p>if we want to talk about what infrastructure this country needs, I&rsquo;ve said it on the last</p>
<p>couple of shows, we don&rsquo;t need yesteryear&rsquo;s infrastructure. We don&rsquo;t need last century&rsquo;s</p>
<p>infrastructure, new bridges, and, you know, toll bridges, or whatever nonsense is, you know,</p>
<p>going to get inflated as a result of this recent infrastructure bill, what we need is next gen</p>
<p>infrastructure, and not charging stations, because the free markets already they&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>And, you know, not internet, because the free markets already they&rsquo;re giving everyone internet,</p>
<p>we see 1000 examples of that, what we need is the stuff that the free market cannot afford to fund</p>
<p>and stand up, like next gen nuclear power stations, like biomanufacturing, like large</p>
<p>scale on demand 3d printing systems. These are the sorts of infrastructure programs that the</p>
<p>United States and our workforce could benefit from government subsidies to help the private force the</p>
<p>private markets get stood up. And as these things get stood up, and the flywheel gets going and cash</p>
<p>starts getting generated, they can sell fund and they can grow and they can install more of these</p>
<p>and the costs come down for the next one. The things where the government is the only customer,</p>
<p>the only person buying the cost will only go up on over time, whereas the things that the private</p>
<p>market is building, the cost will go down over time. And in some of these cases where there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>big kind of hurdle to get over the first build, or the first build cycle, you know, the government</p>
<p>has an important role to play, I think. And so you know, look, I mean, it&rsquo;s clearly not going</p>
<p>to happen with this current infrastructure bill, there&rsquo;s a few nuggets in there that might be</p>
<p>useful and helpful. But generally speaking, you&rsquo;re right. I mean, over time, we want the cost of</p>
<p>things to come down, not go up. And so we need the private market to play a critical role in being</p>
<p>the majority driver. You know, of these kind of systems. All right, seems like a good place to</p>
<p>end. Pete Davidson is now dating Kim Kardashian. How jealous are you to mop? I&rsquo;m not jealous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about a great, great. I am. I am shocked that Pete Davidson has dated some of</p>
<p>the most incredibly famous, popular women. So you are jealous? Okay. Well, I&rsquo;m a little curious. I</p>
<p>gotta say I&rsquo;m a little curious. I mean, if you put a picture of Pete day, I mean, there&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>to be something happening there. Let&rsquo;s just put it out there. He&rsquo;s got the cover. I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>send you a link to an article. I don&rsquo;t know what it is. I&rsquo;m googling that from Seinfeld, where</p>
<p>Kramer was like, you know, dating all these beautiful women. And it&rsquo;s because he explained</p>
<p>he had the cover. He&rsquo;s got a better finishing move. Yeah, this is an article that went viral</p>
<p>this week. Emily Ratajkowski, how do you pronounce her name? Yeah, breaks down breaks down why women</p>
<p>find Pete Davidson so attractive. And so this was like, you know, I saw it all over Twitter this</p>
<p>week. But it was all about, you know, and what is the answer? Just give me the headlines. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. It&rsquo;s something he&rsquo;s got. super charming. He&rsquo;s vulnerable. He&rsquo;s lovely. His fingernail</p>
<p>polish is awesome. He looks good. He has a good relationship with his mom. I mean, I just think</p>
<p>he comes across as a good guy might be the appeal. Also, they want to take care of him, I think</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s got like his guys are missing a more subtle nod off. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about. Do explain maybe you could expand. I&rsquo;m just a family show tomorrow. It&rsquo;s a family show.</p>
<p>Oh my god. No, I think I want to take care of them. That&rsquo;s what I heard for a woman said they</p>
<p>want to like, David&rsquo;s. Yeah, I mean, also Kim Kardashian, I think, you know, she just got the</p>
<p>Gen Z. I think she was probably going the way of Paris Hilton, like maybe aging out of her,</p>
<p>you know, celebrity. And now she went Kanye, kind of Gen X, right. And now she&rsquo;s going down</p>
<p>to Gen Z. She&rsquo;s got a whole new. I hate to be cynical about it. But I also, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take so much flack for saying this, but I was a little short Donda. But I&rsquo;ve listened</p>
<p>to Donda now a couple times. And my god, is it good. It&rsquo;s pretty fucking good. I mean,</p>
<p>Kanye West is one of legitimately one of the most incredible artists of all time. I mean,</p>
<p>the way I grew up, the music, the beats, it&rsquo;s outrageous. I think if you give Donda like,</p>
<p>two or three shots, it&rsquo;s really registration college dropout and 808 and heartbreaks.</p>
<p>Amazing. My dark twisted fantasy was probably one of the best albums ever created. Well,</p>
<p>see, that&rsquo;s the thing is, I think with his later work, like I didn&rsquo;t get into my beautiful dark</p>
<p>twisted fantasy until I had listened to it 10 times. And then I was like, Okay, I get amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I feel like I&rsquo;m so accessible, like, so accessible registration. But Donda is pretty</p>
<p>incredible. I mean, it&rsquo;s right now David Sachs is like, What are you guys talking about? I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>listened to any of this. David, do you know? He&rsquo;s like, Is that like Paul Anka?</p>
<p>Dan is like, Yeah, wow.</p>
<p>Sachs, do you listen to music? Actually, this is what&rsquo;s your favorite artist? What&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>favorite? Like, if we found like, if we listened, like you&rsquo;re like your workout tracks. So like on</p>
<p>like on on Barry Manilow, like I Apple, like what are you listening to? Like Spotify? Like,</p>
<p>what do you Tucker Carlson? No music. I don&rsquo;t listen to music when I work out.</p>
<p>The only time I really listen to music is when I&rsquo;m like in a car on a plane or whatever.</p>
<p>But do you have music, for example, like downloaded on your phone? Like if he said,</p>
<p>Yeah, your phone? Huh? Yeah, I do. Give a couple names here. Yeah. Top three. Yeah.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s gonna be recent hits because I just download what my kids told me to download.</p>
<p>I understand. Just give me a couple albums that you&rsquo;ve downloaded. Okay, so where&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recently added? Okay, so it looks to me like I recently added Khalid. Yes. Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Gaga song. Kid LAROI and Miley Cyrus. Okay. Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber.</p>
<p>Great. Doja Cat. My kids love Doja Cat. She&rsquo;s great. She&rsquo;s great. TikTok queen.</p>
<p>See, my kids keep me current. You know, you think I&rsquo;m like, she&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing for my kids. This is my new parenting strategy.</p>
<p>I was let they love listening to the 80s playlist on Spotify. But now I was like,</p>
<p>what, who are like great seminal artists. So I have them doing Tom Petty, David Bowie,</p>
<p>talking heads and Bob Marley, and I get the whole greatest hits album. And I explained to them every</p>
<p>song and they&rsquo;re like, totally getting into it. So basically, actually know what great music is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being self indulgent, you&rsquo;re focused on yourself, and you&rsquo;re trying to make them a loser.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m trying to get them to understand what actually you want your kids to walk into school.</p>
<p>And when somebody else like, Hey, do you like Doja Cat? They&rsquo;re like, No, but have you listened</p>
<p>to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers? I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;ve been doing I&rsquo;ve been playing my kids my</p>
<p>favorite artists and they and he&rsquo;s become their favorite artist. Apex twin. You guys don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who he is. Yeah. Apex twin. Yeah. Apex. What about what about I&rsquo;m called the Chemical Brothers</p>
<p>album. Richard D. James album is probably one of the best albums of all time. And I play and my</p>
<p>kids go friggin nuts for it now. And they asked for it nonstop. And I&rsquo;m like, Oh my god, I love</p>
<p>you. You&rsquo;re my kids. It&rsquo;s the best. I try to get my kids into my favorite movies. And that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>too hard. Because movies were everybody they were so too slow. But yeah, just to watch movies is</p>
<p>hard. They want to watch hard. Yeah. No, they can&rsquo;t watch movies. They&rsquo;re too slow. They can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch movies. I watch a Marvel movie. They can&rsquo;t even watch the original Star Wars or Raiders of</p>
<p>Lost Ark. Anything where the scene doesn&rsquo;t cut every one and a half seconds. They can&rsquo;t watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Raiders of Lost Ark. You&rsquo;re gonna love this. So like, this is so boring. I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark. Tell them are boring. Crazy. Terrible. But I remember watching like</p>
<p>character development. They want to cut the first act. Have you guys watched and watch</p>
<p>jaws would be like unwatchable. But I remember as a kid watching you loved it. Did you guys ever</p>
<p>watch like AMC and you watch the old school movies of the 30s and 40s? They are impossible</p>
<p>to watch. Like they are so it&rsquo;s like watching a play. You know, it&rsquo;s like gotten more and more</p>
<p>kind of short form as we&rsquo;ve kind of aged. But you know, that&rsquo;s like, Oh, no, what happened?</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Sadiq. Aki. Aki. Aki just came and took it from me. Aki, not good Aki. You don&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>a biscuit. Aki, you eat dog food. You don&rsquo;t eat it a biscuit. Bad Aki. You know, those biscuits</p>
<p>are cashmere. They&rsquo;re really expensive. All right, I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna get my booster shot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you guys later. All right, everybody. This has been another exciting, amazing episode</p>
<p>of the all in podcast for for the dictator. Hi, Nat. And the Sultan of Science, David</p>
<p>Freeberg. We&rsquo;ll see you all next time. sexy boo. Have a wonderful time with Suarez. He came by</p>
<p>last night. I&rsquo;m hosting Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tonight. We&rsquo;re doing a cocktail reception</p>
<p>fundraiser for him. And we got huge turnout. I mean, I tweeted this thing. And we&rsquo;re gonna have,</p>
<p>I think at least 60 people at the reception, at least 20 people for dinner.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re letting randos in your house from Twitter security. Oh, they have to pay five dimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re gonna have to pay but also like we kind of check everybody out. One of your enemies</p>
<p>one of your enemies will pay five dimes just to get in your house. I think basically like BuzzFeed</p>
<p>paid to get in there. I&rsquo;d be careful. We have to we have to know who they are. We&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>background. There&rsquo;s a lot of people I mean, look, if we want to let everybody in there are at least</p>
<p>100 people who replied to my tweet saying I can&rsquo;t DM you but I want to go and open your dams for a</p>
<p>day. Oh, you can do that. Yeah. Francis came by yesterday with his team. He was in top form. He</p>
<p>looks great. He&rsquo;s excited about the next term. All right. We&rsquo;ll see you all next time. Bye bye.</p>
