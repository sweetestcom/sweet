    <p>The following is a conversation with Sarah Seager, a planetary scientist at MIT known</p>
<p>for her work on the search for exoplanets, which are planets outside of our solar system.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an author of two books on this fascinating topic, plus in a couple days, August 18th,</p>
<p>her new book, a memoir called The Smallest Lights in the Universe, is coming out.</p>
<p>I read it and I can recommend it highly, especially if you love space and are a bit of a romantic</p>
<p>like me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautifully written.</p>
<p>She weaves the stories of the tragedies and the triumphs of her life with the stories</p>
<p>of her love for and research on exoplanets, which represent our hope to find life out</p>
<p>there in the universe.</p>

<p>It really is the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>Just a quick side note.</p>
<p>Let me say that extraterrestrial life, aliens, I think represent our civilization longing</p>
<p>to make contact with the unknown, with others like us, or maybe others that are very different</p>
<p>from us, entities that might reveal something profound about why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>The possibility of this is both exciting and, at least to me, terrifying, which is exactly</p>
<p>where we humans do our best work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an Eastim electrical stimulation device that I&rsquo;ve been using a lot for muscle recovery,</p>
<p>mostly for my shoulders and legs as I&rsquo;ve been doing the crazy amounts of body weight reps</p>
<p>and 6 miles every other day now after the challenge.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m still doing it.</p>
<p>They call it the smart muscle stimulator since the app that goes with it is amazing.</p>
<p>It has 15 programs for different body parts and guides you through everything you need</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>I take recovery really seriously these days and Power Dot has been a powerful addition</p>
<p>to stretching, ice, massage, and sleep and diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used by professional athletes and by slightly insane, but mostly normal people</p>
<p>like me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s portable so you can throw it in a bag and bring it anywhere.</p>

<p>Our first sponsor, the great, the powerful Cash App, the number one finance app in the</p>
<p>App Store.</p>
<p>I will forever be grateful to them for sponsoring this podcast.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re awesome people, awesome company, awesome product.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the read.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with</p>
<p>as little as one dollar.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin, let me mention that cryptocurrency in the</p>
<p>context of the history of money is fascinating.</p>
<p>I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.</p>
<p>Debits and credits on ledgers started around 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Time flies.</p>
<p>The US dollar created over 200 years ago and the first decentralized cryptocurrency released</p>
<p>just over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use code LEX PODCAST,</p>
<p>you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping</p>
<p>to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Sarah Seeger.</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love with the stars?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve always loved the stars.</p>
<p>One of my first memory is of the moon.</p>
<p>I remember watching the moon and I was in the car with my dad who my parents were divorced</p>
<p>and he was driving me and my siblings to his house for the weekend and the moon was just</p>
<p>following me.</p>
<p>Just had no idea why that was.</p>
<p>So like looking up at the sky and there&rsquo;s this glowing thing, how do you make sense</p>
<p>of the moon at that age?</p>
<p>Like age five.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no way you can.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the great things about being a kid is just that curiosity that all</p>
<p>kids have.</p>
<p>You know, I was thinking because there&rsquo;s these almost out there ideas of that our earth is</p>
<p>flat, floating about on the internet.</p>
<p>And it made me think, you know, when did I first realize that the earth is like this</p>
<p>ball that&rsquo;s flying through empty space?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awe inspiring.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to make sense of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard because we live in our frame of reference here on this planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nearly impossible.</p>
<p>None of us are lucky to go to see the curvature of earth.</p>
<p>I mean, do you remember when you realized, understood like the physics, like the layout</p>
<p>of the solar system?</p>
<p>Was it like, did you first have to take physics to really, like high school physics to really</p>
<p>take that in?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>I had this book when I was a child.</p>
<p>It was in French.</p>
<p>I grew up in Canada, where French is supposedly taught to all of us English speaking Canadians.</p>
<p>And it was this book in French was about the solar system, and I just love flipping through</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say how much, you know, you or I understand when we&rsquo;re kids, but it was</p>
<p>really great book.</p>
<p>What about the stars?</p>
<p>When did you first learn about the stars?</p>
<p>Like I do have this very incredible distinctive memory.</p>
<p>And again, it had to do with my dad.</p>
<p>He took us camping.</p>
<p>Now, my dad was from the UK, and he was the type who you&rsquo;d find wearing a tie on weekends.</p>
<p>So camping was not in his sphere, his comfort zone.</p>
<p>We had a babysitter.</p>
<p>Every summer we had a babysitter, and one summer we had Tom.</p>
<p>He was barely older than we were.</p>
<p>He was 14.</p>
<p>My brother was 12.</p>
<p>I would have been 11 or 10 maybe.</p>
<p>And we went camping because Tom said camping is the thing.</p>
<p>We should try it.</p>
<p>And I just remember I didn&rsquo;t aim to see the stars, but I walked out of my tent in the</p>
<p>middle of the night, and I looked up, and wow, so many stars.</p>
<p>The dark night sky and all those stars just screaming at me.</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>Honestly, my first thought was, this is so incredible, mind blowing.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t anyone have told me this existed?</p>
<p>Can anyone else see this?</p>
<p>Have you had an experience like that with anything?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if maybe you can tell me if it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that with robots.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few robots I&rsquo;ve met where I just fell in love with this.</p>
<p>Is anyone else seeing this?</p>
<p>Is anyone else seeing that here in a robot is our ability to engineer some intelligent</p>
<p>beings, intelligent beings that we could love, that could love us, that we can interact with</p>
<p>in some rich ways that we haven&rsquo;t yet discovered?</p>
<p>Almost like when you get a puppy, instead of a dog, and there&rsquo;s this immediate bond</p>
<p>and love, and on top of that, ability to engineer it, I had to just pause and hold myself.</p>
<p>I imagine, I don&rsquo;t have kids, I imagine there&rsquo;s a magic to that as well, where it&rsquo;s a totally</p>
<p>new experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, the stars though, unlike kids or the puppy, it&rsquo;s only a good thing.</p>
<p>So you felt, you weren&rsquo;t terrified?</p>
<p>Like to me, when I look at the stars, it&rsquo;s almost paralyzingly scary how little we know</p>
<p>about the universe, how alone we are.</p>
<p>I mean, somehow it feels alone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s just a matter of perspective, but it feels like, wow, there&rsquo;s billions</p>
<p>of them out there and we know nothing about them.</p>
<p>And then also immediately to me, somehow mortality comes into it.</p>
<p>I mean, how did that make you feel at that time?</p>
<p>I think as a child without articulating it, I felt that same way.</p>
<p>Just like, wow, this is terrifying.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<p>Like, what is this?</p>
<p>What does it mean about us here?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a scientist, an exo world class scientist, planetary scientist, astronomer.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a bit of an idiot who likes to ask silly questions.</p>
<p>So some questions are a little bit in the realm of speculation, almost philosophical</p>
<p>because we know so little and one of the awesome things about your work is you&rsquo;ve actually</p>
<p>put data and real science behind some of the biggest questions that we&rsquo;re all curious</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, many of the questions might be a little bit speculative.</p>
<p>So on that topic, just in your sense, do you think we&rsquo;re alone in the universe, human</p>
<p>beings?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s life out there?</p>
<p>Well, Lex, the funny thing is, is that as a scientist, I so don&rsquo;t even want to answer</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I will answer it though, but I just love to say, yeah, we naturally resist that because</p>
<p>we want numbers and hard facts and not speculation.</p>
<p>But I do love that question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question and it&rsquo;s one we all wonder about, but I have to give you the scientist</p>
<p>answer first, which is we&rsquo;ll have the capability to answer that question soon, even starting</p>
<p>soon.</p>
<p>How do you define soon?</p>
<p>How do I define soon?</p>
<p>So much happened in the last hundred years.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a difference, right, if it&rsquo;s 10 years or 20 years or a hundred years.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a difference in that.</p>
<p>Well, soon could be a decade or two decades.</p>
<p>Journalists usually don&rsquo;t like that or the people want like tomorrow, they want the news.</p>
<p>But what it&rsquo;s going to take is telescopes, space telescopes, or very sophisticated ground</p>
<p>or space telescopes to let us study the atmospheres of other planets far away and to look what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the atmospheres and to look for water, which is needed for life as we know it, to</p>
<p>look for gases that don&rsquo;t belong that we might attribute to life.</p>
<p>So we have to do some really nitty gritty astronomy.</p>
<p>So the promising way to answer this question scientifically is to look for hints of life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where like many of your ideas come in of what kind of hints might we actually</p>
<p>see about this life.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what we need to do.</p>
<p>And I like the word you chose, hint, because it&rsquo;s going to be a hint.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be a 100% yay, we found it.</p>
<p>And then it will take future generations to do more careful work to hopefully even find</p>
<p>a way to send a probe to these distant exoplanets and to really figure this out for us.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ll talk about the details.</p>
<p>Those are fun, but like the back to the speculation, the zoomed out big picture is, yes, I believe</p>
<p>absolutely there is life out there somewhere.</p>
<p>Because the vastness of the universe is incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so breathtaking.</p>
<p>When we look at the night sky, if you can go to that dark sky, you can see many, many</p>
<p>hundred or even if you have good eyesight and you&rsquo;re somewhere very dark, you could</p>
<p>see thousands of stars.</p>
<p>But in our galaxy, we have hundreds of billions of stars and our universe has hundreds of</p>
<p>billions of galaxies.</p>
<p>So think about all those stars out there.</p>
<p>And even if planets are rare, even if life is rare, just because the number of stars</p>
<p>is so huge, things have to come together somewhere, someplace in our universe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So amazing to think that somebody might be looking up on another planet in a distant</p>
<p>galaxy.</p>
<p>I have to interrupt your reverie and get back to, in our lifetime at least, the short term.</p>
<p>We only have the nearest stars to look at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that there are so many stars, so many hosts for planets that might have life.</p>
<p>But in the practical question of will we find it, it has to be a star quite close to Earth,</p>
<p>like a few light years, tens of light years, maybe hundreds of light years.</p>
<p>And by the way, you&rsquo;ve introduced me to a tool of Eyes on Exoplanets, I think that NASA</p>
<p>has put together.</p>
<p>Eyes on Exoplanets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great software.</p>
<p>You can download it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>But anyway, can you give a sense of who our neighbors are?</p>
<p>You said hundreds of light years.</p>
<p>How many stars are close by?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s our neighborhood like?</p>
<p>Are we talking about five, 10 stars that we might actually have a chance to zoom in on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about maybe a dozen or two dozen stars.</p>
<p>And those with planets that look suitable for us to follow up in detail.</p>
<p>For life.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But one thing that&rsquo;s really exciting in this field is that the very nearest star to Earth</p>
<p>called Proxima Centauri, it&rsquo;s part of the Alpha Centauri star system.</p>
<p>Cool name, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, Proxima.</p>
<p>Whoever names them.</p>
<p>Nearby.</p>
<p>Okay, but it sounds cooler than Proxima.</p>
<p>Proxima Centauri appears to have a planet around it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about an Earth mass planet in the so called habitable zone or the Goldilocks zone</p>
<p>of the host star.</p>
<p>So think about how incredible that is.</p>
<p>Like out of all the stars out there, even the very nearest star has planets and has</p>
<p>a planet of huge interest to us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So can we talk about that planet?</p>
<p>What does it mean to be maybe possibly habitable?</p>
<p>How does size come into play?</p>
<p>How does you know what we know about gases and what kind of things are necessary for</p>
<p>life?</p>
<p>You know, what are the factors that you make you think that it&rsquo;s habitable?</p>
<p>And by the way, I mean, maybe one way to talk about that is people know about the Drake</p>
<p>equation, which is a very high level, almost framework to think about what is the probability</p>
<p>that, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, that there&rsquo;s life out there and intelligent life, I think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But then you have a equation named after you now, which I think nicely focuses in on the</p>
<p>more achievable and interesting part of that question, which is on whether there is habitable</p>
<p>planets out there or how many, I guess.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So the funny thing is, was one time I met Frank Drake and I asked if he minded if I</p>
<p>took his equation and kind of revamped it for this new field of exoplanet astronomy.</p>
<p>He was totally cool with it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s totally cool.</p>
<p>He got total approval.</p>
<p>Well, maybe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;d actually read the stuff about my equation, but he was cool with it.</p>
<p>He was cool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I just said like 15 different things, but maybe can you tell from your perspective,</p>
<p>what is the Drake equation and what is, sorry, the Seager equation?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Well, the Drake equation, as you said, it&rsquo;s a framework.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a description of the number of civilizations out there of intelligent beings that are able</p>
<p>to communicate with us by radio waves.</p>
<p>So if you think of the movie Contact, you&rsquo;ve seen Contact, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re listening in, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an active field of research, listening to other stars at radio wavelengths, hoping</p>
<p>that some intelligent civilizations are sending us a message.</p>
<p>And the Drake equation came like at the start of that whole field to put the factors down</p>
<p>on paper to sort of illustrate what is involved to kind of estimating.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no real estimate or prediction of how many civilizations are out there, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a way to frame the question and show you each term that&rsquo;s involved.</p>
<p>So I took the Drake equation and I called it a revised Drake equation and I recast it</p>
<p>for the search for planets by more traditional astronomy means.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at stars, looking for planets, looking for rocky planets, looking for planets</p>
<p>that are the right temperature for life, looking for planets that might have life that outputs</p>
<p>gases that we might detect in the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same spirit of the Drake equation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to give us any magic numbers.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to say, hey, here&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meant to kind of guide, guide of where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>So the Drake equation did, I mean the initial equation proposed actual numbers for those</p>
<p>variables, right?</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>The equation proposed numbers and you can still plug your own numbers in.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this really cute website that lets you for both the Drake and my revised</p>
<p>equation plug in some numbers and see what you got.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what are, I mean, what are the variables, but maybe also what are like the critical</p>
<p>variables?</p>
<p>So in my equation, I set out to what are the numbers of inhabited planets that show signs</p>
<p>of life by way of gases in the atmosphere that can be attributed to life.</p>
<p>I could just walk through the terms as far as I&rsquo;m aware.</p>
<p>So the first thing I say is what are the number of stars available?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that those trillions and trillions of stars everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what are available to like a specific search.</p>
<p>And so for example, the MIT led NASA mission TESS is surveying the sky, looking for all</p>
<p>kinds of planets, but it can also, it also has stars.</p>
<p>It has about 30,000 red dwarf stars.</p>
<p>So we just take a number of stars that a given survey can access.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the number of stars is.</p>
<p>Then I wanted to know what kind of stars are quiet.</p>
<p>I called it fraction of those stars that is quiet.</p>
<p>In the case of TESS, the way it&rsquo;s looking for planets is planets that transit the star.</p>
<p>They go in front of the star as seen from the telescope, but it turns out that some</p>
<p>stars are very active, they&rsquo;re variable and they brighten and dim with time and that interferes</p>
<p>with our observation.</p>
<p>I apologize to interrupt.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a transiting planet.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re really looking for a black blob, essentially that blocks the light.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for a black blob that blocks the light and then trying to say something</p>
<p>about the size of the planet from the frequency of that black blobs appearance and the size</p>
<p>of that black blob, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just say that out of all the stars there are accessible to whatever telescope,</p>
<p>some of them are just bad for whatever reason.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be able to find planets around them.</p>
<p>So I need to know the fraction of those that are, that are good.</p>
<p>So again, we have the number of stars, the fraction of them that we can actually find</p>
<p>planets around.</p>
<p>And by the way, is our sun one such, is our sun quiet?</p>
<p>Our sun is quiet.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I have actually two terms.</p>
<p>One describes how quiet they are and one is if we can find a planet around that star.</p>
<p>These transiting planets, for example, not all planets transit because the planet would</p>
<p>have to be orbiting that star in this kind of plane as viewed from you.</p>
<p>But if a star is, for example, orbiting in the plane of the sky, it will never transit.</p>
<p>It will never go in front of the star.</p>
<p>So in that case, we have to have a fraction that takes into account of that kind of geometric</p>
<p>factor.</p>
<p>And hopefully, I mean, you can assume that it&rsquo;s uniformly distributed, hopefully.</p>
<p>Yes, we can assume and there&rsquo;s evidence that it&rsquo;s uniformly distributed, yes.</p>
<p>So then the next, so all of these factors so far, number of stars accessible to whatever</p>
<p>telescope you&rsquo;re thinking about, how many stars are quiet, fraction of stars that are</p>
<p>quiet, fraction that are observable, in this case for the geometric factor, those are all</p>
<p>things we can measure.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one more term in the secret equation we can measure.</p>
<p>I call it fraction of planets in the habitable zone.</p>
<p>Because believe it or not, we have a handle on that for a certain set of stars.</p>
<p>We know from our, the Kepler Space Telescope that operated for a number of years, we have</p>
<p>estimates for how many planets are in the so called habitable zone of the host star</p>
<p>for a certain type of star.</p>
<p>So all those we have measurable.</p>
<p>And then like the Drake equation itself, there are some terms we can not measure.</p>
<p>And those ones, I call them FL, fraction of all those planets that have life on them.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>And FS, I called for spectroscopy, the fraction that have, we can use our telescope and instrument</p>
<p>tools to look for light.</p>
<p>The FS was the ones that, the planets that have life that actually gives off a gas, a</p>
<p>useful gas that might accumulate in the atmosphere, so we could eventually observe it.</p>
<p>How do the FL and FS interplay?</p>
<p>So these are separate terms?</p>
<p>Separate terms.</p>
<p>And so?</p>
<p>So for example, you could imagine, so for example, you could imagine life, like us humans,</p>
<p>we breathe out carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>And our planet Earth, we already have a lot of carbon dioxide on it.</p>
<p>Well, we have hundreds of parts per million, but it has a really strong signal.</p>
<p>So us humans breathing out carbon dioxide, it&rsquo;s not helpful for any intelligent beings</p>
<p>that are looking back at Earth, because there&rsquo;s already a lot of, there&rsquo;s already enough carbon</p>
<p>dioxide, we&rsquo;re not adding to it.</p>
<p>So if there is life on a planet, and it&rsquo;s outputting a boring gas that&rsquo;s not helpful</p>
<p>for us to uniquely identify as being made by life versus just being there anyway, then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not helpful.</p>
<p>So I separated those two terms out.</p>
<p>Soon I think we&rsquo;ll have evidence that planets that can support life at least are common.</p>
<p>So okay, this is such an awesome topic, I have a million questions.</p>
<p>What okay, I know this is a little bit of speculation, but what&rsquo;s your sense about that,</p>
<p>I think FS, which is like, that life would produce interesting gases that would be able</p>
<p>to detect, like, is there, one, is there scientific evidence and, and second, is there some intuition</p>
<p>around life producing gases with detectable hints in terms of chemistry?</p>
<p>So interestingly enough, that entire question relates to, I&rsquo;m going to say almost my life&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work, the work I&rsquo;m doing now and the work I&rsquo;m doing for the next 20 years, and I wish</p>
<p>I could give you a concrete number, like 1%, like on the worst days, it&rsquo;s 1%, let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>in my mind.</p>
<p>You know, in the best days, it&rsquo;s like 80%.</p>
<p>And I could actually go into a lot of detail here, but I&rsquo;ll just give you the simplest</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>So first of all, we make an assumption that like us, and our life here on Earth, life</p>
<p>uses chemistry.</p>
<p>So we use chemistry because we eat food, we breathe air, and we have metabolism that to</p>
<p>break down food to get energy to store energy, and then ultimately to use it.</p>
<p>And all life here has some kind of byproduct in doing all that, some kind of waste product</p>
<p>that goes into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So I like to think that life everywhere uses chemistry.</p>
<p>Some people have imagined, like, let&rsquo;s imagine like a windmill, like mechanical energy, just</p>
<p>getting energy and using it without storing it.</p>
<p>And if there was life like that, it might not need to output a gas.</p>
<p>So we make this basic assumption of chemistry, that&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>The second more complicated thing that I and my team work on is what happens to the gas</p>
<p>once it is produced by life, it goes into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And a lot of gas is just destroyed immediately, actually, by ultraviolet radiation or by oxygen.</p>
<p>Oxygen is incredibly destructive to a lot of gases.</p>
<p>So the gas can be produced by life, but it could be just completely destroyed by its</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>I guess we should pause on that, that you mentioned your life&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>This is just the beautiful idea that it&rsquo;s kind of paralyzing when you look out there</p>
<p>and you wonder, is there a life out there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first paralyzing, actually, before I encountered your work, I feel like an idiot.</p>
<p>But you know, it feels like there&rsquo;s no tool to answer that question.</p>
<p>And then what you kind of provided is this cool idea that it might be possible to answer</p>
<p>that by looking at the gases.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a really interesting, that&rsquo;s a beautiful idea.</p>
<p>And yeah, so we could just pause on like, that&rsquo;s a powerful tool, I think, to build</p>
<p>the intuition around, because I was totally clueless about it.</p>
<p>And that was kind of exciting.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s folks probably early on in your life who were very skeptical about</p>
<p>this notion.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&rsquo;m not sure, but generally you would want to be skeptical, it&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>all these kinds of other things could generate gases, you know, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big part of this growing field is how to make sure that this gas isn&rsquo;t produced</p>
<p>by another effect.</p>
<p>But I do want to, you know, again, pausing on that and going back a bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible to think, but like, at least almost 100 years ago, there&rsquo;s a record of</p>
<p>someone talking about the idea of a gas being an indicator of life elsewhere.</p>
<p>That idea was floating about somewhere.</p>
<p>Yes, it was totally floating about.</p>
<p>And it comes down to oxygen, which on our planet fills our atmosphere to 20% by volume.</p>
<p>And you know, we rely on oxygen to breathe.</p>
<p>You know, when you hear about the people in Mount Everest running out of air, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really running out of oxygen, well, they&rsquo;re running out of oxygen because the air is getting</p>
<p>thinner as they climb up the mountain.</p>
<p>But without plants and bacteria, there&rsquo;s bacteria that also photosynthesizes and produces oxygen</p>
<p>as a waste product.</p>
<p>Without those, we would have virtually no oxygen.</p>
<p>Our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen.</p>
<p>So yeah, if you were to analyze Earth, is oxygen the strong indicator here?</p>
<p>Oxygen is a huge indicator.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re hoping, that there is an intelligent civilization not too far from</p>
<p>here around a planet orbiting a nearby star with the kind of telescopes we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>build.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re looking back at our sun and they&rsquo;ve seen our Earth and they see oxygen.</p>
<p>And they probably won&rsquo;t be like 100.0% sure that there&rsquo;s life making it.</p>
<p>But if they go through all the possible scenarios, they&rsquo;ll be left with a pretty strong hint</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s life here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, but how do you detect that type of gases that are on the planet from a distance?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going back to that, that&rsquo;s what people were skeptical about.</p>
<p>When I first started working on exoplanets a long time ago, people didn&rsquo;t believe we</p>
<p>would ever, ever, ever study an exoplanet atmosphere of any kind.</p>
<p>And now dozens of them are studied.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole field of people, hundreds of people working on exoplanet atmospheres</p>
<p>actually.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>But first there was a point where people didn&rsquo;t even know there was exoplanets, right?</p>
<p>When was the first exoplanet detected?</p>
<p>The first exoplanet around a sun like star anyway was detected in the mid 1990s.</p>
<p>That was a big deal.</p>
<p>Kind of vaguely remember that.</p>
<p>Well, at the time it was a big deal, but it was also incredibly controversial.</p>
<p>Because in exoplanets, we only had one example of a planetary system, our own solar system.</p>
<p>And in our solar system, Jupiter, our big massive planet, is really far from our star.</p>
<p>And this first exoplanet around a sun like star was incredibly close to its star, so</p>
<p>close that people just couldn&rsquo;t believe it was a planet actually.</p>
<p>So maybe zoom out, what the heck is an exoplanet?</p>
<p>An exoplanet is our name, like is the name that we call a planet orbiting a star other</p>
<p>than our sun.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Extrasolar, I guess is another.</p>
<p>You can call it extrasolar.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Exoplanet is simpler.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s worth pausing to remember that each one of those stars out there in</p>
<p>our night sky is a sun.</p>
<p>And you know, our sun has planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.</p>
<p>And so for a long time, people have wondered, do those other stars or other suns have planets?</p>
<p>And they do.</p>
<p>And it appears that nearly every star has a planet, has a planet we call exoplanet.</p>
<p>And there are thousands of known exoplanets already.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s already, yeah, like, there&rsquo;s so many things about space that it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>put into one&rsquo;s brain, because it starts filling it with awe.</p>
<p>So yeah, if you visualize the fact that the stars that we see in the sky aren&rsquo;t just stars,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re suns.</p>
<p>And they very likely, as you&rsquo;re saying, would have planets around them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these planets roaming about in this like, dimly lit darkness, with potentially</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just mind blowing.</p>
<p>But maybe can you give a brief, like, history of discovering all the exoplanets?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no exoplanets in the 90s.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a lot of exoplanets now.</p>
<p>So how did that come about?</p>
<p>So many planets.</p>
<p>How did it come about?</p>
<p>Well, maybe another way to ask is, what is the methodology that was used to discover</p>
<p>them?</p>
<p>I can say that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to just say something else first where, so exoplanets, you know, the line</p>
<p>between what is considered completely crazy.</p>
<p>And what is considered mainstream research, legit, is constantly shifting.</p>
<p>This is awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So before, when I started on exoplanets, it was still sketchy.</p>
<p>Like, it wasn&rsquo;t considered a career, a thing, a place where you should be investing.</p>
<p>And right now, now, today, it&rsquo;s so many people are working in this field, a good, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, at least 1000, probably more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that sounds like a lot to you, but it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a legitimate field of inquiry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Legitimate field of inquiry.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s helped us is everything that&rsquo;s helped everyone else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s software, it&rsquo;s computers, it&rsquo;s hardware.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like our phones.</p>
<p>You have a fantastic detector in there.</p>
<p>Like, they didn&rsquo;t always have that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember the so called olden days.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have digital cameras.</p>
<p>We had film.</p>
<p>You take a film camera, you send the film away, and eventually it comes back, and then</p>
<p>you see your pictures.</p>
<p>And they could all be horrible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, digital.</p>
<p>It just changed everything.</p>
<p>Data changed everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so one thing that really helped exoplanets were detectors that were very sensitive.</p>
<p>Because when we&rsquo;re looking for the transiting planets, what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re monitoring</p>
<p>a star&rsquo;s brightness as a function of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like click, taking a picture of the stars every few seconds or minutes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re measuring the brightness of a star, like every frame.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re looking for a drop in brightness that&rsquo;s characteristic of a planet going in</p>
<p>front of the star, and then finishing its so called transit.</p>
<p>And to make that measurement, we have to have precise detectors.</p>
<p>And the detectors that are making the measurement, can you do it from Earth?</p>
<p>Are they floating about in space, like what kind of telescope?</p>
<p>So on the ground, people are using telescopes, small telescopes that are almost just like</p>
<p>a glorified telephoto lens.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re looking at big swaths of the sky.</p>
<p>And from the ground, people can find giant planets like the size of Jupiter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about 10 to 12 times the size of Earth.</p>
<p>We can find big planets, because we can reach about 1% precision.</p>
<p>So not sure how technical you want to get.</p>
<p>Well, how many pixels are we talking about?</p>
<p>You mentioned phones, there&rsquo;s a bunch of megapixels, I think.</p>
<p>So for exoplanets, you want to think about it as like a pixel or less than a pixel, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting any information.</p>
<p>But to be more technical, our telescope spreads the light out over many pixels, but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting information.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not tiling the planet with pixels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a point of light, or in most cases, we don&rsquo;t even see the planet itself,</p>
<p>just the planet&rsquo;s effect on the star.</p>
<p>But another thing that really helped was computers, because transiting planets are actually quite</p>
<p>rare.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t all go in front of their star.</p>
<p>And so to find transiting planets, we look at a big part of the sky at once, or we look</p>
<p>at tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, or even in some cases, millions of stars at</p>
<p>one time.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re not going to do this by hand, going through a million stars, counting up</p>
<p>the brightness.</p>
<p>So we have computer software and computer code that does the job for us and counts the</p>
<p>brightness and looks for a signal that could be due to a transiting planet.</p>
<p>And I just finished a job called Deputy Science Director for the MIT led NASA mission test.</p>
<p>And it was my purview to make sure that we got the planet candidates, the transiting</p>
<p>light curves, out to the community so people could follow them up and figure out if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actual planets or false positives.</p>
<p>So publish the data so that people could just, all the data scientists out there could crunch</p>
<p>and see if they can discover something.</p>
<p>They can discover something.</p>
<p>And in fact, the NASA policy for this mission is that all the data becomes public as soon</p>
<p>as possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as easy as it sounds, though, to download the data and look for planets.</p>
<p>But there is a group called PlanetHunters.org, and they take the data and they actually crowdsource</p>
<p>it out to people to look for planets.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they often find signals that our computers and our team missed.</p>
<p>So we mentioned exoplanets.</p>
<p>What about Earth like, or I don&rsquo;t know what the right distinction is, is it habitable</p>
<p>or is it Earth like planets, but what are those different categories and how can we</p>
<p>tell the difference and detect each?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not at Earth like planets yet.</p>
<p>All the planets we&rsquo;re finding are so different from what we have in our solar system.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just easier planets to find, but like&hellip;</p>
<p>In which way?</p>
<p>For example, there could be a Jupiter sized planet where an Earth should be.</p>
<p>We find planets that are the same size as Earth, but are orbiting way closer to their</p>
<p>star than Mercury is to our sun.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so close that, because close to a star means they also orbit faster.</p>
<p>And some of these hot super Earths we call them, their year, their time to go around</p>
<p>their star is less than a day.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re heated so much by their star, they&rsquo;re heated so much by the star.</p>
<p>We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock.</p>
<p>So instead of running out by the bay or the river, you&rsquo;ll have like liquid lava.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be liquid lava lakes on these planets, we think.</p>
<p>And life can&rsquo;t survive.</p>
<p>Way too hot.</p>
<p>The molecules needed for life just wouldn&rsquo;t be able to survive those temperatures.</p>
<p>We have some other planets.</p>
<p>One of the most mysterious things out there, factoid, if you will, is that the most common</p>
<p>type of planet we know about so far is a planet that&rsquo;s in between Earth and Neptune size.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two to three times the size of Earth.</p>
<p>And we have no solar system counterpart of that planet.</p>
<p>That is like going outside to the forest and finding some kind of creature or animal that</p>
<p>just no one has ever seen before and then discovering that is the most common thing</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re not even sure what they are.</p>
<p>We have a lot of thoughts as to the different types of planet it could be, but people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know.</p>
<p>I mean, what are your thoughts about what it could be?</p>
<p>Well, one thought, and this is more when we want to be rather than might be, is that these</p>
<p>so called mini Neptunes, we call them, that they are water worlds, that they could be</p>
<p>scaled up versions of Jupiter&rsquo;s icy moons, such that they are planets that are made of</p>
<p>more than half of water by mass.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the connection between water and life and the possibility of seeing that from</p>
<p>a gas perspective?</p>
<p>Okay, so all life on Earth needs liquid water.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s been this idea in astronomy or astrobiology for a long time called follow</p>
<p>the water, find water, that will give you a chance of finding life, but we could still</p>
<p>zoom out and the community consensus is that we need some kind of liquid for life to originate</p>
<p>and to survive because molecules have to react.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a way that molecules can interact with each other.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really make anything.</p>
<p>And so when we think of all the liquids out there, water is the most abundant liquid in</p>
<p>terms of planetary materials.</p>
<p>There really aren&rsquo;t that many liquids.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, liquid rock, way too hot for life.</p>
<p>We have some really cold liquids, like almost gasoline, like ethane and methane lakes that</p>
<p>have been found on one of Saturn&rsquo;s moons, Titan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cold though.</p>
<p>And for exoplanets, we can&rsquo;t study really cold planets because they&rsquo;re just simply too</p>
<p>dark and too cold.</p>
<p>So we usually are just left with looking for planets with liquid water.</p>
<p>And to your point, remember as we talked about how planets are less than a pixel in that</p>
<p>way to say, so we can&rsquo;t see oceans on planet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to see continents and oceans, not yet anyway, but we can see gases in the</p>
<p>atmosphere.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a small rocky planet, and this is going into some more detail, if we see</p>
<p>a small rocky planet with water vapor in the atmosphere, we&rsquo;re pretty sure that means there</p>
<p>has to be a liquid water reservoir because it&rsquo;s not intuitive in any way, but water is</p>
<p>broken up by ultraviolet radiation from the star or from the sun.</p>
<p>And on most planets when water is broken up into H and O, the H, the hydrogen will escape</p>
<p>to space.</p>
<p>Because just like when you think of a child letting go of a helium filled balloon, it</p>
<p>floats upwards and hydrogen is a light gas and will leave from the planet.</p>
<p>So ultimately if you have water, unless there&rsquo;s an ocean, like a way to keep replenishing</p>
<p>water vapor in the atmosphere, that water vapor should be destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>Got it, so there&rsquo;s a, okay, so there&rsquo;s a need for liquid, I mean, I guess it was water.</p>
<p>Is water essential or are the liquids, I mean, the chemistry here is probably super complicated.</p>
<p>It does, but you know, there&rsquo;s not an infinite number of liquids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s maybe like five liquids that can exist inside or on the surface of a planet.</p>
<p>And water is the one that exists for the largest range of temperatures and pressures.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the easiest type of planet for us to find and study is one with water vapor</p>
<p>rather than a cold planet that has ethane and methane lakes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your personal, in terms of solar systems and planets that you&rsquo;re most hopeful about</p>
<p>in terms of our closest neighbors that you kind of have a sense that there might be somebody</p>
<p>living over there, whether it&rsquo;s bacteria or somebody that looks like us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful that every star nearby has a planet.</p>
<p>That has some life.</p>
<p>Because it almost has to for us to make progress.</p>
<p>We have to have that dream condition.</p>
<p>So the dream condition is like life is just super abundant out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, the dream, yes, the dream condition is that life is super abundant and it&rsquo;s based</p>
<p>on the thought that if there is a planet with water and continents, that it also has the</p>
<p>ingredients for life and that the kind of base kernel thought is that if the ingredients</p>
<p>for life is there, life will form.</p>
<p>Life will form.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re holding on to.</p>
<p>With a relatively high probability.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go into land of speculation.</p>
<p>What about intelligent life?</p>
<p>Us humans consider ourselves intelligent, surprisingly or unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Do you think about from your perspective of looking at planets from a gas composition</p>
<p>perspective and in general of how we might see intelligent life and your intuition about</p>
<p>whether that life is even out there?</p>
<p>I think the life is out there somewhere.</p>
<p>The huge numbers of stars and planets.</p>
<p>I like to think that life had a chance to evolve to be intelligent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced the life is anywhere near here, only because if it&rsquo;s hard for intelligent</p>
<p>life to evolve, then it will be far away by definition.</p>
<p>Well, the sad thing is maybe from the artificial intelligence perspective is it makes me sad</p>
<p>there might be intelligent life out there that we&rsquo;re just not like the pathways of evolution</p>
<p>can go in all these different directions where we might not be able to communicate with it</p>
<p>or even know that or even detect its intelligence or even comprehend its intelligence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced cats are more intelligent than humans that we&rsquo;re just not able to comprehend</p>
<p>the measures, the proper measures of their intelligence.</p>
<p>My dog is so funny.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a golden doodle.</p>
<p>His name&rsquo;s Leo.</p>
<p>We joke that he&rsquo;s either a really dumb dog and sorry, he&rsquo;s not here to defend himself,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s either really dumb or he&rsquo;s a super genius just pretending to be dumb.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible he&rsquo;s a multidimensional projection of alien life here monitoring one</p>
<p>of the top scientists in the world trying to find aliens just to make sure that humans</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get out of hand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m definitely going to go in and ask him about that when I get home.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s onto something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What might we look for in terms of signs of intelligent life?</p>
<p>From your toolkit, do you think there are things that we might be able to use or maybe</p>
<p>in the next couple of decades discover that would be different than life that&rsquo;s like bacteria,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s primitive life?</p>
<p>I still love SETI, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.</p>
<p>I like to hope that if there is a civilization out there, they&rsquo;re trying to send us a message.</p>
<p>I think, like, think about it, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Like, if you think about our Earth, there&rsquo;s no structure we&rsquo;ve built that intelligent</p>
<p>civilizations could see from far away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally nothing, not even the Great Wall of China.</p>
<p>And so to think, like, why would this other civilization build a giant structure that</p>
<p>we could see?</p>
<p>Yeah, so with SETI, the idea is that we&rsquo;re both trying to hear signals and send signals,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Well, we haven&rsquo;t sent one.</p>
<p>They call that METI, messaging.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a big kind of fear over METI, because do you want to tell them you&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of this, like, let&rsquo;s wait till they call us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a dating game, you have to, like, how many days do I wait before I call, kind</p>
<p>of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the funny thing is, if no one&rsquo;s sending us a message, if everybody&rsquo;s only listening,</p>
<p>how do you make progress?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And, I mean, but there&rsquo;s also, there&rsquo;s the Voyager spacecraft that we have these little</p>
<p>pixels of robots flying out all over the place.</p>
<p>Some of them, like the Voyager, reach out really far.</p>
<p>And they have some stuff on them.</p>
<p>Okay, I just&hellip;</p>
<p>We do, we have the Voyager, but they&rsquo;re not really going anywhere in particular.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re moving very, very slowly on a cosmic scale.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And me saying they&rsquo;re far is kind of silly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all relative in astronomy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all relative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just&hellip;</p>
<p>So from the, if you look at Earth from an alien perspective, from visually and from</p>
<p>gas composition, I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to determine the degree of maybe productive</p>
<p>energy use.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to tell, like, how busy these Earthlings are.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s zoom out again and think about oxygen.</p>
<p>So when cyanobacteria arose like billions of years ago and figured out how to harness</p>
<p>the energy of the sun for photosynthesis, they reengineered the entire atmosphere.</p>
<p>20% of the atmosphere has oxygen now.</p>
<p>Like that is a huge scale.</p>
<p>You know, they almost poisoned everything else by making this, what was apparently very</p>
<p>poisonous to everything that was alive.</p>
<p>But imagine&hellip;</p>
<p>So are we doing anything at that scale?</p>
<p>Like, are we changing anything at like 20% of the Earth with a giant structure or 20%</p>
<p>of this or 20% of that?</p>
<p>Like we aren&rsquo;t actually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s humbling to think that we&rsquo;re not actually having that much of an impact.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But we are because in a way we&rsquo;re destroying our entire planet.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s humbling to think that from far away, people probably can&rsquo;t even tell.</p>
<p>But from the perspective of the planet, when we say we&rsquo;re destroying, you know, global</p>
<p>warming, all that kind of stuff, what we really mean is we&rsquo;re destroying it for a bunch of</p>
<p>different species, including humans.</p>
<p>But like, I think the Earth will be okay.</p>
<p>Oh, the Earth will be, the Earth will remain, whatever happens to us, the Earth will still</p>
<p>be here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll still be difficult to detect any difference.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s sad to think that if humans destroy ourselves, except potentially with nuclear</p>
<p>war, it&rsquo;d be hard to tell that anything even happened.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell from far away that anything happened.</p>
<p>What about, what are your thoughts now?</p>
<p>This is really getting into speculation land.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned exoplanets were in the realm of, you know, this is beautiful edge between</p>
<p>science and science fiction.</p>
<p>That some of us, a rare few are brave enough to walk, I think in academia, you were brave</p>
<p>enough to do that.</p>
<p>I think in some sense, artificial intelligence sometimes walks that line a little bit.</p>
<p>There is so much excitement about extraterrestrial life and aliens in this world.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what, how to comprehend that excitement, but to me, it&rsquo;s great to</p>
<p>see people curious because to me, extraterrestrial life and aliens is at the core, a scientific</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost looks like people are excited about science.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re excited by discovery, discovery, right?</p>
<p>And then the possibility that there&rsquo;s alien life that visited earth or is here on earth</p>
<p>now is, is a excitement about discovery in your lifetime, essentially.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you make, what do you make of that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s recent events where DARPA or DOD released footage of these unmanned aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re calling them now UAP.</p>
<p>They got everybody like super excited.</p>
<p>Like maybe there is like what, what, what&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s here on earth.</p>
<p>Do you follow the, this world of people who are thinking about aliens that are already</p>
<p>here or have visited?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really follow it.</p>
<p>They follow me.</p>
<p>Because in this field, if you&rsquo;re a scientist of any kind, you get, people contact us, me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of them about, Hey, I have stuff you should see, Hey, the aliens are already</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>I need to tell you about it.</p>
<p>And I know there are people out there who really believe there&rsquo;s a psychology to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a psychology to it and it&rsquo;s fascinating, but okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s similar to artificial intelligence, but I still, but like you, I&rsquo;m still enamored</p>
<p>with the point that it is out there and that people believe so strongly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so many people out there believe, believe.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I I&rsquo;m not as allergic to it as some scientists are because ultimately</p>
<p>if aliens showed up or do show up or have showed up you know, these are going to be</p>
<p>very difficult to study scientific phenomena.</p>
<p>Like in, in fact, like going back to cats and dogs, like I just, I think we should be</p>
<p>more open minded about developing new tools and looking for intelligent life on earth</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t yet found.</p>
<p>Or even understanding the nature of our own intelligence because it kind of is an alien</p>
<p>life form, the thing that&rsquo;s living, you know, in our skull.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t understand consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand how biology is hard, you know, unpacking it and working it all out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stretch.</p>
<p>And they say too that our thinking mind is like the tip of a pyramid and that everything</p>
<p>else is happening under the hood and, but what is happening?</p>
<p>But the thing with, so the typical scientist response to, you know, are there aliens here</p>
<p>is that we need to see major evidence, not like a sketchy picture of something.</p>
<p>We need some cold hard evidence and we just don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But from my perspective, I admire people that dream and I think that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>The thing I don&rsquo;t like, there&rsquo;s two sides of the, of the folks that probably listened</p>
<p>to this, this podcast is, oh, those that dream, I think is beautiful, that, that wander what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>out there, what&rsquo;s here on earth.</p>
<p>And then the other ones who are very conspiratorial and thinking that stuff is being hidden and</p>
<p>it becomes about institutions.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>I have a funny thing to talk about that.</p>
<p>So one of my colleagues had a really good answer to that and it&rsquo;s not me saying this,</p>
<p>so I can say this, but he said, look, he works with NASA, not at NASA.</p>
<p>He works with government, not in the government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of mean, but he&rsquo;d say, trust me, they couldn&rsquo;t hide it if they tried.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re not smart enough or good enough.</p>
<p>Not we or not me or not you, but whoever to cover it up.</p>
<p>It just, it&rsquo;s sort of a myth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It makes it sad because the people at NASA, the people at MIT, the people in academia,</p>
<p>the people in these institutions and yes, even in government are often trying, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like just curious descendants of apes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, they, they want to do good.</p>
<p>They want to discover stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not trying to hide stuff.</p>
<p>In fact, most of them would, in terms of leaks, would love to discover this and release this</p>
<p>kind of stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, did you ever watch the show called The X Files?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Scully and Mulder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what I love actually, I used to put it up during my talks, my public talks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a picture of a UFO or what looks like UFO and it says, I want to believe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s where I think a lot of us are coming from.</p>
<p>I want to believe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so great.</p>
<p>And one time I put that up and this very, very nice couple approached me really nervous</p>
<p>afterwards and they said, Hey, can we take you out for lunch sometime?</p>
<p>And I said, sure.</p>
<p>And they were like the nicest people.</p>
<p>And just one of many who has an alien, alien abduction story and the woman, um, could never</p>
<p>have kids.</p>
<p>They were older, but they didn&rsquo;t have kids, which for them was a real source of regret.</p>
<p>But it was because the aliens who had abducted her had made it so that she couldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>kids.</p>
<p>And she had apparently something implanted behind her ear, which was somehow unimplanted</p>
<p>later.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just so sincere and they&rsquo;re such a lovely couple and they just wanted to share</p>
<p>their story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a real, whatever that is, that&rsquo;s the real thing.</p>
<p>The mystery of the human mind is more powerful than any alien or, I mean, it&rsquo;s as interesting</p>
<p>I think as the universe.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re somehow intricately linked, maybe getting a sense of numbers.</p>
<p>How many stars are there in, um, maybe, I don&rsquo;t know what the radius that&rsquo;s reasonable</p>
<p>to think about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the observable universe is like way too big to think about, but in terms</p>
<p>of when we think about how many habitable planets there are, what are the numbers we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working with in your sense?</p>
<p>What are the scale?</p>
<p>Honestly, the numbers are probably like billions of trillions of stars.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, in the UK, I think, I don&rsquo;t know if we do that here, but they will call a billion</p>
<p>trillion where you put like one billion followed by a trillion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of weird, but here, I don&rsquo;t even know how to say the number 10 to the 20.</p>
<p>Like if you know what that is, that&rsquo;s one followed by 20 zeros.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big number.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a name for that number.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many per star.</p>
<p>I think we kind of mentioned this.</p>
<p>Is there a good sense, there&rsquo;s probably argument about this, but per star, how many planets</p>
<p>are there?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that number yet per se, you know, we&rsquo;re not really there, but some people</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s many planets per star.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this analogy of filling the coffee cup, like, you know, you don&rsquo;t usually just</p>
<p>pour one drop, you fill it.</p>
<p>And that planetary systems, we see stars being born that have a disc of gas and dust and</p>
<p>that ultimately forms planets.</p>
<p>So the idea, this kind of concept is that planets, so many planets form too many.</p>
<p>And eventually some get kicked out and you&rsquo;re left with like a full planetary system, a</p>
<p>dynamically full system.</p>
<p>And so there have to be a lot because so many form and a bunch survive.</p>
<p>I mean, that makes perfect intuitive sense, right?</p>
<p>Like why wouldn&rsquo;t that happen?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s other thoughts too, though.</p>
<p>These big planets that are really close to the star, we think they formed far away from</p>
<p>the star where there&rsquo;s enough material to form and they migrated inwards.</p>
<p>And some of these planets migrating inwards due to interaction with other planets or with</p>
<p>the disc itself, they may have cleared it out.</p>
<p>And kicked other planets out of the system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of ideas floating around.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not entirely sure.</p>
<p>And what about Earth like planets?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another level of uncertainty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a level of uncertainty.</p>
<p>If we think of an Earth like planet being an Earth around a sun in the same orbit, an</p>
<p>Earth like planet being an Earth sized planet in an Earth like orbit about a sun like star,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re not able to detect enough of those to give you a hard number.</p>
<p>Some people have extrapolated.</p>
<p>And they will say as many as one in five stars like our sun could be hosting a true Earth</p>
<p>like planet.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>On the topic of space exploration, there&rsquo;s been a lot of exciting developments with NASA,</p>
<p>with SpaceX, with other companies successfully getting rockets into space with humans and</p>
<p>getting them to land back, especially with SpaceX.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX, Crew Dragon, while working with NASA</p>
<p>to launch astronauts?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense about these exciting new developments?</p>
<p>Well, SpaceX and other so called commercial companies are only good news for my field,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re lowering the cost of getting to space by having reusable rockets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just been it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And we need cheaper access to space.</p>
<p>So from a very practical viewpoint, it&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>Without getting people, there&rsquo;s this dream that we have to go to Mars, boots on Mars.</p>
<p>Boots on Mars.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>You mentioned probes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the value of humans?</p>
<p>Is that interesting to you from both scientific and a human perspective?</p>
<p>Human mostly.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s such in our desire to explore because part of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>So wanting to go to another planet and be able to live there for some time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just just what it means to be human.</p>
<p>You know, oftentimes in science and engineering, big, huge discoveries are made when we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>intend to.</p>
<p>So often this kind of pure exploratory type of research or this pure exploration research,</p>
<p>it can lead to something really important like the laser, we couldn&rsquo;t really live without</p>
<p>that now.</p>
<p>At the grocery, you scan your foods, there&rsquo;s surgery that involves lasers, GPS, we all</p>
<p>use our GPS.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have GPS because someone thought, hey, it&rsquo;d be great to have a navigation system.</p>
<p>And so I do support, I do, I just, but I really think it comes primarily just from the desire</p>
<p>to explore.</p>
<p>Do you think something, there&rsquo;s a lot of criticism and a lot of excitement about Mars.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s value in trying to go to put humans on Mars, first of all, and second</p>
<p>of all, colonize Mars?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s something interesting that might come from there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced there will be something interesting.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know what it is yet, but I don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t think having some commercial</p>
<p>value or value in the metric of something useful is really what&rsquo;s motivating us.</p>
<p>So really, you see, exploration is a long term investment into something awesome that</p>
<p>eventually will be commercial value.</p>
<p>I do actually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>So what about visiting, okay, I apologize, but Amy, there&rsquo;s an exciting longing to visit</p>
<p>Earth like planets elsewhere.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the closest Earth like planet you think is worth visiting and how hard is it?</p>
<p>Wow, it is very hard.</p>
<p>I mean, our nearest, call it Earth mass planet, it&rsquo;s orbiting a star very different from</p>
<p>our own sun, an M Dwarf star, a small red star, Proxima Centauri.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over four light years away and we can&rsquo;t travel at the speed of light.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even travel, I mean, it would take tens of thousands of years to get there with</p>
<p>conventional methods.</p>
<p>So, you know, the movies like multigenerational, yeah, this movie Passenger, have you seen</p>
<p>that movie?</p>
<p>Passenger.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a big spaceship that is traveling to another planet and everyone&rsquo;s hibernating.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t give you the spoiler alert because one person wakes up and then it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>a problem.</p>
<p>Okay, got it.</p>
<p>But yeah, the multigenerational ships, I mean, when you think about where we&rsquo;re headed as</p>
<p>a species, maybe we don&rsquo;t send people, maybe we end up sending raw biological materials</p>
<p>and instructions to print out humans, it sounds kind of farfetched, but already we&rsquo;re printing</p>
<p>like liver cells in the lab and beating heart cells, we&rsquo;re starting to reconstruct body</p>
<p>parts.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing is, it is so hard to get to another planet that this thought of printing</p>
<p>humans or printing life forms actually could be easier.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s somehow so sad to think, to think of the idea that we would launch a successful</p>
<p>spaceship that has multigenerational, like non human life and it&rsquo;s going to reach other</p>
<p>intelligent life and by the time they figure out where it came from, human civilization</p>
<p>will be extinct.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is really, I mean, that&rsquo;s, so that&rsquo;s one, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a tempting thing to</p>
<p>think about.</p>
<p>What are the possible trajectories?</p>
<p>So, you know, Elon keeps talking about multi planetary, us becoming multi planetary species.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, Mars is a part of that, but like the dream is to really expand outside</p>
<p>the solar system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not clear, just like, as you said, like what the actual scientific engineering</p>
<p>steps that are required to take, it seems like so daunting, so daunting.</p>
<p>So like this, the smart thing seems to be to do the most achievable near daunting task,</p>
<p>even if there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a commercial application, which I think is colonizing</p>
<p>Mars.</p>
<p>But like from your perspective, is there some Manhattan project style, huge project in space</p>
<p>that we might want to take on and you&rsquo;ve had roles.</p>
<p>You had scientists hat roles and then you also had roles in terms of being on like committees</p>
<p>and stuff, determining where funding goes and so on.</p>
<p>So like, is there a huge like multi trillion, we&rsquo;ve been throwing the T word around recently</p>
<p>a lot, but these huge projects that we might want to take on?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, we want to find the planets like earth first, like just even finding those</p>
<p>earth like planets is a billion dollar endeavor, billions of dollars endeavor.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so hard because an earth is so small, so less massive, and so faint compared</p>
<p>to our sun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the proverbial needle in a haystack, but worse.</p>
<p>And we need very sophisticated space based telescopes to be able to find these planets</p>
<p>and to look, look at them and see which ones have water and which ones have signs of life</p>
<p>on them.</p>
<p>Yeah, the, the star shade project that you&rsquo;re part of, star shade, star shade, yeah, this</p>
<p>is probably the most badass thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s interesting?</p>
<p>Can you describe what it is?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s amazing about star shade is it was first conceived of in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Imagine that and revisited every decade until now when we think we can actually build it</p>
<p>and star shade is a giant specially shaped screen.</p>
<p>It is about, there&rsquo;s different versions of it, but think about 30 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re blocking out the sun.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re effectively blocking out the star so that you can see the planet directly and star</p>
<p>shade would have a spacecraft attached to it and it would fly in space far away from</p>
<p>Earth&rsquo;s gravity and it would have to formation fly with a space telescope.</p>
<p>So the idea is that star shade blocks out the starlight in a very careful way and it</p>
<p>has to block that starlight out so that the planet that is 10 billion times fainter than</p>
<p>the star, that only the planet light goes to the telescope.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in formation, meaning the telescope flies in, you gave a presentation on this, but like</p>
<p>it, it would fly like in, um, this is extremely high precision endeavor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We had this analogy like asking a friend to hold up a dime five miles away perfectly.</p>
<p>Like at the perfect line of sight with you.</p>
<p>And the shape of it is pretty cool.</p>
<p>I mean, uh, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what the physics of that, like what the optics are</p>
<p>that require that shape.</p>
<p>I can tell you, it turns out that if you block out a star, imagine blocking out a star with</p>
<p>a circle circularly or a square shaped screen, you wouldn&rsquo;t actually be blocking it because</p>
<p>the star acts like a wave.</p>
<p>The starlight can act like a wave and it would actually bend around the edges of the screen.</p>
<p>And so instead of blocking out the light, you&rsquo;re expecting to see nothing.</p>
<p>You would see ripples and the analogy that I love to give, it&rsquo;s like throwing a pebble</p>
<p>in a pond.</p>
<p>You know, you get those ripples, you get these concentric ripples and they go out and light</p>
<p>would do something quite similar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d actually see ripples of light and those ripples of light, they&rsquo;re actually way brighter</p>
<p>than the planet we&rsquo;d be looking for.</p>
<p>So they would introduce this noise that&rsquo;s a noise.</p>
<p>And so the star shade, it&rsquo;s like a mathematical solution to the problem of diffraction it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called.</p>
<p>And this is what the first person who thought about star shape in the 1960s worked out the</p>
<p>mathematical shape or one salute, one family of solutions.</p>
<p>And the idea is that when the star shade, this very special shape, like a giant flower</p>
<p>with petals, when it blocks out the light, the light bends around the edges, but interacts</p>
<p>with itself in a way to give you a very, very dark image.</p>
<p>It would be like throwing a pebble in a pond and instead of getting ripples, the pond would</p>
<p>be perfectly smooth, like incredibly smooth to one part in 10 billion.</p>
<p>And all the waves would be on the outer edges, far away from where you drop that pebble.</p>
<p>And so this camera would be able to get some signal from the planet then.</p>
<p>Yes, and it would be hard because the planet is so faint.</p>
<p>But with the star out of the way, the glare of that bright, bright, bright star, with</p>
<p>that out of the way, then it becomes a much more manageable task.</p>
<p>So how do we get that thing out there?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with unlimited money.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re working with unlimited money.</p>
<p>We have some more engineering problems to solve, but not too many more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been burning down our so called tall pole list.</p>
<p>What kind of list?</p>
<p>We call it technology tall pole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the phrase where you have to figure out what are your hardest problems and then break</p>
<p>those down to solve.</p>
<p>So the star shade, one of the really hard problems was how to formation fly at tens</p>
<p>of thousands of kilometers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, that is insane.</p>
<p>And the team broke that down actually into a sensing problem because of the star shade.</p>
<p>How do you see the star shade precisely enough to control it?</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re shining a flashlight, you know the beam spreads out.</p>
<p>So the star shade has a beacon, an LED or a laser, it&rsquo;s going to spread out so much</p>
<p>by the time it gets to the telescope.</p>
<p>The problem wasn&rsquo;t how do you tell the star shade how to move around fast enough to stay</p>
<p>in a straight line.</p>
<p>The problem was how are you able to sense it well enough?</p>
<p>So problems like that were broken down and money that came from NASA to solve problems</p>
<p>is put towards solving it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got through most of the hard problems right now.</p>
<p>Another one was that star shade, even though it&rsquo;s looking at a star, light from our own</p>
<p>sun could hit the edges of the star shade and bounce off into the telescope, believe</p>
<p>it or not.</p>
<p>And that would actually ruin it because we&rsquo;re trying to see this tiny, tiny signal.</p>
<p>So then the question is how do you make a razor thin edge?</p>
<p>Those pedal edges would have to be like a razor.</p>
<p>What materials can you use?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a series of problems like that.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a materials problem in there?</p>
<p>Some of them.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>So we almost finished solving all those problems and then it&rsquo;s just a matter of building one</p>
<p>and testing it in a full scale size facility and then building the telescope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of time to build everything and get it, get it up for launch.</p>
<p>So this is an engineering close engineering project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real engineering project.</p>
<p>I actually can tell you about two other projects that are not mine.</p>
<p>I like to call, call star shade mine because it was my project that I helped make it mainstream</p>
<p>without line is constantly shifting.</p>
<p>When I started, when I got this leadership role on star shade, I remember telling people</p>
<p>about it and it was definitely not on the mainstream okay line.</p>
<p>It was on the giggle factor side of the line and people would just laugh like that&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>Like you can never formation fly or they&rsquo;d say, why are you working on that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just so not, it&rsquo;s not so awesome.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a few things you&rsquo;ve done in your life and that&rsquo;s when I first saw star</p>
<p>shade, I was like, what, really?</p>
<p>And then like it sinks in.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the same thing I felt with like Elon Musk or certain people who do crazy stuff</p>
<p>and like, and then, and they get, they actually make it work.</p>
<p>I mean, if you get star shade information flying to like together, I mean, how awesome</p>
<p>is that if you actually make that happen, even like from a robot, I&rsquo;m sorry, from the</p>
<p>robotics perspective, even if it doesn&rsquo;t give us good data, that&rsquo;s just like a cool</p>
<p>thing to get out there.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>Really cool.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two other topics that aren&rsquo;t mine, but I still love them.</p>
<p>One of them, let&rsquo;s just talk about it briefly because it&rsquo;s not a probe, but it&rsquo;s the idea</p>
<p>to send a telescope very far away to 500 times the earth sun distance.</p>
<p>And this is way farther than the Voyager spacecrafts are right now.</p>
<p>And to use our sun as a gravitational lens, to use our sun to magnify something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behind it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to sink in for a minute.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what the physics of that is, like how to use the sun.</p>
<p>In astronomy, and Einstein thought about this initially, we can use a massive objects, bend</p>
<p>space.</p>
<p>And so light that should be traveling like straight, it actually travels around the warped</p>
<p>space.</p>
<p>And somehow you figure out a way to use that for magnification.</p>
<p>You have a way to use that for magnification.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There are galaxies that are lensed, so called gravitational lens by intervening galaxy clusters</p>
<p>actually.</p>
<p>And there are microlensing events where stars get magnified as an unseen gravitational lens</p>
<p>star passes in between us and that very distant star.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a real tool in astronomy.</p>
<p>Yeah, using gravitational lensing to magnify because it bends more rays towards you than</p>
<p>normally you&rsquo;d normally see.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re trying to get more higher resolution images that are basically boiled</p>
<p>down to light.</p>
<p>Well, it boils down to light.</p>
<p>And then you can maybe get more information about.</p>
<p>Well, in this case, you would ask me, let&rsquo;s say, if this thing could get built, it would</p>
<p>take like something like they like to say 25 years to get from here to there, 25 years</p>
<p>and then it could send some information back to us.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d say, so Sarah, how many pixels?</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t say one or less than one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, you know, it could be like 10 by 10 pixels, it could be 100 pixels, which would</p>
<p>be awesome.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s still crazy that we can get a lot of information from that.</p>
<p>Crazy, right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s crazy for a lot of other reasons, because again, you have to line up the sun</p>
<p>and your target.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d only have one telescope per target, because every star is behind the sun in a</p>
<p>different way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot of complicated things.</p>
<p>What about the second?</p>
<p>The second one, it&rsquo;s called star shot.</p>
<p>You know, star shot means like big dreams and it&rsquo;s an initiative by the Breakthrough</p>
<p>Foundation.</p>
<p>And star shot is the concept to send thousands of little tiny spacecraft, which they now</p>
<p>call star chip.</p>
<p>So instead of star ship, it&rsquo;s star chip.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little chip and the star chip, so like sending like thousands of little turtles</p>
<p>being born, they&rsquo;re not all going to make it.</p>
<p>The idea is to send lots of them, and each of these star chips, once they&rsquo;re launched</p>
<p>into, I guess, low Earth orbit, they will deploy a solar sail that&rsquo;s a few meters in</p>
<p>diameter.</p>
<p>And the idea is that on Earth, we would have a bank of, this one is still a bit on the</p>
<p>other side of the line, but we&rsquo;d have a bank of telescopes with lasers that would be like</p>
<p>a gigawatt power and these lasers would momentarily shine upwards and accelerate, they&rsquo;d hit these</p>
<p>sails.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like a power source for the sail and would accelerate the sails to travel at</p>
<p>about a 20th the speed of light.</p>
<p>Is that as crazy as it sounds?</p>
<p>Well, like any good engineering project, it has to be broken down into the crazy parts.</p>
<p>And the Breakthrough Initiative, like to their huge credit, is sponsoring, you know, getting</p>
<p>over these, actually, they&rsquo;ve listed initially, they listed 19 challenges, so it&rsquo;s broken</p>
<p>down to concrete things.</p>
<p>Like one of them is, well, you have to buy the land and make sure the airspace is okay</p>
<p>with you sending up that much power overhead.</p>
<p>Another one is you have to have material on the sail where the lasers won&rsquo;t just vaporize</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of issues, but anyway, these sails would be accelerated to 20th the speed</p>
<p>of light and their journey to the nearest star would no longer be tens of thousands</p>
<p>of years, but could be 20 years, okay, 20, so it&rsquo;s not as bad as tens of thousands.</p>
<p>And these thousands or whatever, however many make it, they&rsquo;ll go by the nearest star system</p>
<p>and snap some images and radio the information back to Earth because they&rsquo;re traveling so</p>
<p>fast they can&rsquo;t slow down, but they&rsquo;ll zoom by, take some photos, send it back.</p>
<p>Hi, Rez.</p>
<p>See, just what I want you to pause on for a second is that just by making that a real</p>
<p>concept and the money given won&rsquo;t make it happen, but what it&rsquo;s done is it&rsquo;s planted</p>
<p>the seed and it&rsquo;s shifted that line from what is crazy to what is a real project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shifted it just ever so slightly enough, I think, to plant the seed that we have to</p>
<p>find a way to somehow find a way to get there.</p>
<p>That is, again, to stay on that, that is so powerful.</p>
<p>Make a big, crazy idea and break it down into smaller, crazy ideas, order it in a list,</p>
<p>and knock it out one at a time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve never heard anything more inspiring from an engineering perspective</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you solve the impossible things.</p>
<p>So you open your new book discussing Rogue Planet, PSO, J318, I never said this out loud,</p>
<p>PSO 1.522, so a Rogue Planet, which is just this poetic, beautiful vision of a planet</p>
<p>that, as you write, lurches across the galaxy like a rudderless ship wrapped in perpetual</p>
<p>darkness, its surface swept by constant storms, its black skies raining molten iron.</p>
<p>Just like the vision of that, the scary, the darkness, just how not pleasant it is for</p>
<p>human life, just the intensity of that metaphor, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And the reason you use that is to paint in a feeling of loneliness, I think, and despair.</p>
<p>And why, maybe on the planet side, why does it feel, maybe it&rsquo;s just me, why does it feel</p>
<p>so profoundly lonely on that kind of planet?</p>
<p>Like what&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because we all want to be a part of something, a part of a family, or a part</p>
<p>of a community, or a part of something.</p>
<p>And so, our solar system, and by the way, I only, it&rsquo;s sort of like when you treat yourself</p>
<p>to like eating an entire tub of ice cream, like I sometimes treat myself to imagine things</p>
<p>like this and not just be so cut and dried.</p>
<p>But when you imagine that, this planet&rsquo;s not part, because I don&rsquo;t want to give emotions</p>
<p>to a planet per se, but the planet&rsquo;s not part of anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow, it&rsquo;s just all on its own, just kind of out there without that warm energy</p>
<p>from its sun, it&rsquo;s just all alone out there.</p>
<p>To me, it was this little discovery that I actually feel pretty good being part of this</p>
<p>solar system.</p>
<p>It felt like we have a sun, we have like a little family, and it felt like it sucked</p>
<p>for the rogue planet to just floating about, not floating, flying rudderless.</p>
<p>By the way, how many rogue planets are there in your sense?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know totally.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some rogue planets that are just born on their own.</p>
<p>I know that sounds really weird to be, how can you be born an orphan?</p>
<p>But they just are, because most planets are born out of a disc of gas and dust around</p>
<p>a star.</p>
<p>But some of these small planets are like totally failed stars.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so failed, they&rsquo;re just small planets on their own.</p>
<p>But we think that there&rsquo;s probably, honestly, there&rsquo;s another path to a rogue planet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s been kicked out of its star system by other planets, like a game of billiard</p>
<p>balls.</p>
<p>It just gets kicked out.</p>
<p>We actually think there&rsquo;s probably as many rogue planets as stars.</p>
<p>No flying out there, fundamentally alone.</p>
<p>So the book is a memoir, is about your life, and it weaves both your fascination with planets</p>
<p>outside the solar system and the path of your life, and you lost your husband, which is</p>
<p>a kind of central part of the book that created a feeling of the rogue planet.</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s the name of the book?</p>
<p>The name of the book is The Smallest Lights in the Universe.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up with the title?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning?</p>
<p>The title has a double meaning.</p>
<p>On the face of it, it&rsquo;s the search for other Earths.</p>
<p>Earths are so dim compared to the big, bright, massive star beside them.</p>
<p>Searching for the Earths is like searching for the smallest lights in the universe.</p>
<p>It has this other meaning, too.</p>
<p>I really hope that you or the other people listening never get to the place where you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>fallen off the cliff into this horrible place of huge despair.</p>
<p>And once in a while, you get a glimmer of a better life, of some kind of hope.</p>
<p>And those are also the smallest lights in the universe.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we can tell the full story before we talk about the glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>What did it feel like to first find out that your husband, Mike, was sick?</p>
<p>It was incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>Like, lots of us have had some kind of problem that the doctors completely ignore.</p>
<p>Just that they kept blowing him off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>Are they paid to just say it&rsquo;s nothing?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just insane.</p>
<p>I was just so angry.</p>
<p>And we finally got to a point where he was really sick.</p>
<p>He was like in bed, not able to move, basically.</p>
<p>And it turned out all the things they ignored and not done any tests, he had like a 100%</p>
<p>blockage in his intestine.</p>
<p>Like 100%.</p>
<p>Like nothing could get out, nothing could get in.</p>
<p>And it was pretty, pretty shocking to even hear then that it could be nothing.</p>
<p>What was the progression of it in the context of the maybe the medical system, the doctors?</p>
<p>I mean, what did it feel like?</p>
<p>Did you feel like a human being?</p>
<p>I felt like a child.</p>
<p>Like the doctors were trying to water down the real diagnosis or treat us like we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know the truth or they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, I felt mixed like, it&rsquo;s not a good situation if you think the doctor either has</p>
<p>no idea what he or she is doing, or if the doctors purposely, let&rsquo;s just say lying to</p>
<p>you to sugarcoat it.</p>
<p>Like, I didn&rsquo;t know which one of it was, but I knew it was one of those.</p>
<p>What were the things he was suffering from?</p>
<p>Well, initially, he just had a random stomach ache.</p>
<p>I hate to say that out loud because I know a lot of people will have a random stomach</p>
<p>ache.</p>
<p>But so he just had a bad stomach ache and then, hmm, this is weird.</p>
<p>A few days later, another bad stomach ache, kind of gets worse.</p>
<p>Might go away for a few weeks, might come back.</p>
<p>And at the time, all I knew was my dad had had that same thing.</p>
<p>Not the same identical system, but he had these really weird pains and he ended up having</p>
<p>the worst diagnosis.</p>
<p>One of the worst diagnoses you can get from a random stomach ache is pancreatic cancer</p>
<p>because the time, the pancreas, like you can&rsquo;t feel anything, so by the time you feel pain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spread already.</p>
<p>So I was just like, beside myself, I&rsquo;m like, this is like, wow, this guy, he&rsquo;s got a random</p>
<p>stomach ache.</p>
<p>All I know is another man I loved had a random stomach ache and it didn&rsquo;t end well.</p>
<p>How did you deal with it emotionally, psychologically, intellectually, as a scientist?</p>
<p>What was that like, that whole, because it&rsquo;s not immediate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long journey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long journey and you don&rsquo;t know where the diagnosis is going.</p>
<p>So anyone who&rsquo;s suffered from a major illness, there&rsquo;s like always branches in the road.</p>
<p>So he had this intestinal blockage.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine someone in their 40s having that and that be normal.</p>
<p>But the doctor is like, it could be nothing, could just cut it out.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need most of your intestine, it&rsquo;s a repeating pattern.</p>
<p>Just cut that out, it could be fine.</p>
<p>But it ended up not being fine and he was diagnosed as being terminally ill.</p>
<p>Well, it really changed my life in a huge way.</p>
<p>First of all, I remember immediately one summer, the summer when this happened, I started asking</p>
<p>everyone I knew.</p>
<p>I would ask you, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s smart of my job to put you on the spot, I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>you have one year to live or two or three, what will you do differently about your life</p>
<p>now?</p>
<p>Lex, you have one year to live, what would you do?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you want to answer that.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I think about it a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a really good thing to meditate on.</p>
<p>We can talk about maybe why you bring that up, if it is or not a heavy question.</p>
<p>But I get, I think about mortality a lot and for me, it feels like a really good way to</p>
<p>focus in on is what you&rsquo;re doing today, the people you have around you, the family you</p>
<p>have, does it bring you joy?</p>
<p>Does it bring you fulfillment?</p>
<p>And basically, for me, long ago, try to be ready to die any day.</p>
<p>So like today, I kind of woke up, look, if I was nervous about talking to you, I really</p>
<p>admire your work and the book is very good and it&rsquo;s super exciting topic.</p>
<p>But then, you know, there&rsquo;s this also feeling like, if this is the last conversation I have</p>
<p>in my life, you know, if I die today, will this be, will this be the right, like am I</p>
<p>glad today happened and it is, and I am glad today happened.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so unique.</p>
<p>I never got that answer from a single person.</p>
<p>The busyness of life, there&rsquo;s goals, there&rsquo;s dreams, there&rsquo;s like planning, plans.</p>
<p>Very few people make it happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I learned.</p>
<p>And so a lot of these people.</p>
<p>Oh, like you run out of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much you run out of time, but I&rsquo;d come back later and be like, okay, why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you do that?</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s what you would do, if you&rsquo;re going to die a year from now, why don&rsquo;t you,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you make it real?</p>
<p>Simple things.</p>
<p>Spend more time with family.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like why, why don&rsquo;t you do that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I had an answer, it turns out, unless you usually, unless you have,</p>
<p>you really do have a pressing end of life, people don&rsquo;t do their bucket lists or try</p>
<p>to change their career.</p>
<p>And some people can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t, like for a lot of people, they can&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But the ones who can take action for some reason, never do.</p>
<p>And that was one of the ways that Mike&rsquo;s death or at the time his impending death really,</p>
<p>really affected me.</p>
<p>Cause you know, for these sick people, what I learned, he had a bucket list and he was</p>
<p>able to do some of the bucket lists.</p>
<p>It was awesome.</p>
<p>But he got sick pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So if you do only have a year to live, it&rsquo;s ironic cause you can&rsquo;t do, you can&rsquo;t do the</p>
<p>things you wanted to do because you get too sick too fast.</p>
<p>What were the bucket list things for you that you realized like, what am I doing with my</p>
<p>life?</p>
<p>That was the major concept of him.</p>
<p>After he died, I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like I, I was just lost because when something that profound happens, all the things I was</p>
<p>doing, most of the things I was doing were just meaningless.</p>
<p>It was so tough to, to find an answer for that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I settled on, I&rsquo;m going to devote the rest of my life to trying to find</p>
<p>another earth and to find out, to find that we&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>What is that longing for connection with others?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Why is that so full of meaning?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re hardwired.</p>
<p>Like one of my friends some time ago, actually when my dad died, he never heard someone say</p>
<p>this before, but he&rsquo;s like, Sarah, you know, why are we evolved to take death so harshly?</p>
<p>Like what kind of society would we be if we just didn&rsquo;t care people died?</p>
<p>That would be a very different type of world.</p>
<p>How would we as a species have got to where we are?</p>
<p>So I think that is tied hand in hand with why do we, why do we seek connection?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that what we were talking about before, that subconsciousness that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A couple, you know, the other side, the flip side of the coin of connection and love is</p>
<p>a fear of loss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that was, again, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s what makes you appreciate the moment is that</p>
<p>the thing ends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely a hard one.</p>
<p>The thing ends, but, and it&rsquo;s hard to not, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to limit.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like my dog who I love so much, I&rsquo;ll start to cry.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t think about the end.</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;ll age much faster than I will.</p>
<p>And someday it will end.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s too sad to think of, but should I not have got a dog?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Should I have not brought this sort of joy into my life because I know it won&rsquo;t be forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a philosopher and his Becker who wrote a book, Denial of Death</p>
<p>and just, and warm with the cores.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another book talks about terror management theory, Sheldon Solomon.</p>
<p>I just talked to him a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant philosopher, psychologist that their theory, whatever you make of it</p>
<p>is that the fear of death is at the core of everything, everything we do.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re that you think you don&rsquo;t think about the mortality of your dog, but you do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes the experience rich.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s this kind of like in the shadows lurks the, the knowledge that this won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>last forever.</p>
<p>And that makes every moment just special in some kind of a weird way that the moments</p>
<p>are special for us humans.</p>
<p>I mean, sorry to use romantic terms like love, but what do you make, what did you learn about</p>
<p>love from, from losing it, from losing your husband?</p>
<p>Well I learned to love the things I have more.</p>
<p>I learned to love the people that I have more and to not let the little things bother me</p>
<p>as much.</p>
<p>What about the rediscovery or like the discovery of the little lights in the darkness?</p>
<p>So you, the book, I think you&rsquo;ve brilliantly described the dark parts of your journey.</p>
<p>But maybe can you talk about how you were able to rediscover the lights?</p>
<p>They came in many ways.</p>
<p>And the way like to think about it is like grief is an ocean, you know, with tiny islands</p>
<p>of the little, like, like the little lights.</p>
<p>And eventually that ocean gets smaller and smaller and the islands like become continents</p>
<p>with lakes.</p>
<p>So initially it&rsquo;d be like the children laughing one day or my colleagues at work who rallied</p>
<p>around me and would take me away from my darkness to work on a project.</p>
<p>Later on it turned out to be a group of women my age, all widows, all with children in my</p>
<p>town.</p>
<p>And it would be, even though it was a bit morose getting together, still very joyful</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>What was the journey of rediscovering love like for you?</p>
<p>So refinding, I mean, is there some, by way of advice or insight about how to, how to</p>
<p>rediscover the beauty of life?</p>
<p>Of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard one.</p>
<p>I think you just have to stay open to being positive and just to get out there.</p>
<p>Do you still think, do you still think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>So you mentioned that that was a thing that you meditate on as a question when it was</p>
<p>right there in front of you.</p>
<p>But do you still think about it?</p>
<p>I think I will after talking to you.</p>
<p>But no, it&rsquo;s not really something I think about.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think about the search for another earth and will, will I get there?</p>
<p>Will I be able to conclude my search and is there one?</p>
<p>Like as time goes by, you know, that window to solve that problem gets smaller.</p>
<p>What would bring you, again, I apologize if this makes concrete the fact that life is</p>
<p>finite, but what, what would bring you joy if we discovered while you&rsquo;re still here?</p>
<p>What would bring me joy?</p>
<p>Finding another earth, an earth like planet around a sun like star, knowing that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at least one or more out there, being able to see water, that it has signs of water and</p>
<p>being able to see some gases that don&rsquo;t belong.</p>
<p>So I know that the search will continue after I&rsquo;m gone enough to fuel the next generation.</p>
<p>So just like opening the door and there&rsquo;s like this glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>What do you think it will take to realize that?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve talked about all these interesting projects, star shade, especially, but is there</p>
<p>something that you&rsquo;re particularly kind of hopeful about in the next 10, 20 years that</p>
<p>might give us that, that exact glimmer of hope that there&rsquo;s earth like planets out there?</p>
<p>I have to, I stand behind star shade in all cases, so, but there is this other kind of</p>
<p>field that I, that everyone is involved in because star shade is hard.</p>
<p>Earths are hard, but there are, there&rsquo;s another category of planet star type that&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>And these are planets orbiting small red dwarf stars.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not earth like at all.</p>
<p>Think like earth cousin instead of earth twin, but there&rsquo;s a chance that we might establish</p>
<p>that some of those have water and signs of life on them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nearer term than star shade and we&rsquo;re all working hard on that too.</p>
<p>Let me ask by way of recommendations, I think a lot of people are curious about this kind</p>
<p>of stuff.</p>
<p>What three books, technical or fiction or philosophical or anything really had an impact</p>
<p>on your life and, and or you would recommend besides of course your book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one book I wish everyone could read.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a children&rsquo;s book, like a young adult book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the giver.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it is the book that kids in school read now.</p>
<p>And I only, sorry, that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s wow.</p>
<p>Sorry, that, that caught me off guard.</p>
<p>So when I first came to this country, I didn&rsquo;t speak much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really what made me, it had a profound impact on my life and a really important moment</p>
<p>because they give it to kids.</p>
<p>Like I think middle school, I think, or maybe elementary, something like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so surprised you&rsquo;ve even heard of this book.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they give it, but like it&rsquo;s the value of giving the right book to a person at the right</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I was, I was, cause it&rsquo;s very accessible.</p>
<p>Do we want to share what the story is without spoiling it?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you can without spoiling, right?</p>
<p>It follows this boy in this very utopic society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like perfect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been all clean cut and made perfect actually.</p>
<p>And as he kind of comes of age, he starts realizing something&rsquo;s wrong with his world.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s part of that question.</p>
<p>Are we going to evolve as, I mean, this isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s there, but it made me wonder, you know,</p>
<p>are we evolving to a better place?</p>
<p>Is there a day when we can eliminate, you know, poverty and hunger and crime and sickness</p>
<p>in this book, they pretty much have in a society that the boys in and sort of follows him.</p>
<p>And he becomes a chosen one to be like a receiver.</p>
<p>The givers, the old wise man who retains some of the harshness of the outside world so that</p>
<p>he can advise the people as a sort of boy comes of age and is chosen for the special</p>
<p>role.</p>
<p>He finds the world isn&rsquo;t what he expects.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know about you, but it was so profound for me because it jolts you out of</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Oh my God, what am I doing here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going with the flow with my society.</p>
<p>How do I think outside the box and the confines of my society, which surely carries negative</p>
<p>things with it that we don&rsquo;t realize today.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also in the flip side of that is if you do take a step outside the box on occasion,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the psychological burden of that?</p>
<p>Like is that, is that a step you want to take?</p>
<p>Is that the journey you want to take?</p>
<p>What is that life like?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I felt like from the book, you have to take it.</p>
<p>I found from the book, I never thought like now that you&rsquo;re saying it, I see what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying.</p>
<p>The burden is huge, but I always felt like the answer is yes, you absolutely want to</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s outside.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t do that if you&rsquo;re very, it&rsquo;s hard to be objective about your own reality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very human instinct, but, uh, it also, the book kind of shows that, uh,</p>
<p>it has an effect on you and this, it&rsquo;s a really interesting question about our society and</p>
<p>taking a step out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by, uh, Lois Lowry, I think is how you pronounce it.</p>
<p>I really do hope everyone created it and it is a young adult book, but it&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredibly, I&rsquo;m really glad I only read it cause my kids got it for school.</p>
<p>I just thought, okay, well, why don&rsquo;t I just see what this is about?</p>
<p>And I just, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also the value of education.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m surprised you mentioned, I&rsquo;ve never really mentioned to anybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people had the similar experience like me and maybe it&rsquo;s a generational thing</p>
<p>though, because like the book came out, I think in the nineties.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re older than like me, that book didn&rsquo;t exist when we were in middle school.</p>
<p>So I just do think a lot of people won&rsquo;t have heard of it, but it&rsquo;s an interesting question</p>
<p>of like those books.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m reminded often, I suppose the same is true with other subjects, but books</p>
<p>are special at the early age, like middle school, maybe early high school, those can</p>
<p>change like the direction of your life.</p>
<p>And also certainly teachers, they can change completely the direction of your life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many stories about teachers of mathematics, teachers of physics, of any kind</p>
<p>of subjects basically changing the direction of a human&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like not to get on the whole, almost like a political thing, but you know, we,</p>
<p>we undervalue teachers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special, it&rsquo;s a special position that they hold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I do have two other books or two other things.</p>
<p>One is something I came across just a few days ago, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a film called Picture a Scientist.</p>
<p>And when you picture a scientist, you probably don&rsquo;t picture the women and women of color</p>
<p>in this film.</p>
<p>And it is a way to get outside your box.</p>
<p>I really think everyone interested in science, even just peripherally should watch this because</p>
<p>it is shocking and sobering at the same time.</p>
<p>And it talks about how, well, I think one of the messages across is, you know, we really</p>
<p>are like, I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re hardwired to just like people like ourselves, but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>excluding a lot of people and therefore a lot of great ideas by not being able to think</p>
<p>outside of how we&rsquo;re all stereotyping each other.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s hard to kind of convey that and you can just say, oh yeah, I want</p>
<p>to be more diverse.</p>
<p>I want to be more open, but it&rsquo;s a nearly impossible problem to solve and the movie</p>
<p>really helps open people&rsquo;s eyes to it.</p>
<p>This book I put third because unlike The Giver, people may not want to read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as relevant.</p>
<p>But when I was in my early twenties, I went to this big, this like 800 people large conference</p>
<p>run by the Wilderness Canoe Association in my hometown of Toronto.</p>
<p>And there was a family friend there who I met and he said, read this book, it&rsquo;ll change</p>
<p>your life.</p>
<p>And it actually changed my life.</p>
<p>And it was a book called Sleeping Island by an author, PG Downs, who just coincidentally</p>
<p>lived in this area, lived in the Boston area and he was a teacher, I think at a private</p>
<p>school and every summer he would go to Canada with a canoe often by himself.</p>
<p>And he wrote this book maybe in the forties or fifties about a trip he took in the late</p>
<p>1930s.</p>
<p>And it was, I was just shocked that even at that time, although that was a long time ago,</p>
<p>there were large parts of Canada that were untouched by white people.</p>
<p>And he went up there and interacted like with the natives.</p>
<p>He called the book and had a subtitle that was called, there&rsquo;s something like Journey</p>
<p>in the Barren Lands.</p>
<p>And when you go up North in Canada, you pass the tree line, just like on a mountain, if</p>
<p>you hike up a mountain, you get so far North there aren&rsquo;t any trees.</p>
<p>And he wrote eloquently about the land and about being out there.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t even any maps of the region, like in that time.</p>
<p>And I just thought to myself, wow, like that you could just take the summer off and explore</p>
<p>by canoe and go and see what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>And it led to me just doing that, that very thing.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s different now, but going out to where the road ends and putting the canoe</p>
<p>in the water and just, well, we had to have a plan.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t just explore, but go down this river, rivers with rapids and travel over lakes and</p>
<p>portages and just really live.</p>
<p>So just really explore, screw it.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t like, it doesn&rsquo;t explore just use from a topo map, from a topographical</p>
<p>map from the library.</p>
<p>There were scary elements about it, out of it, but part of the excitement or the joy</p>
<p>or the desire was to be scared, like it was to go out there and have live on the edge.</p>
<p>And persevere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And persevere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have a advice that you would give to a young person today that would like to help</p>
<p>you maybe on the planetary science side, discover exoplanets or maybe bigger picture, just</p>
<p>succeed in life?</p>
<p>I do have some advice just to succeed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough advice in a way, but it is to find something that you love doing that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also very good at.</p>
<p>And in some ways the stars have to align because you&rsquo;ve got to find that thing you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>at or the range of things, and it actually has to overlap with something that actually</p>
<p>you love doing every day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a tedious job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to succeed.</p>
<p>What were the signals that in your own life were there to make you realize you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>at something?</p>
<p>What were you good at that made you pursue a PhD and it made you pursue the search?</p>
<p>I mean, that was the one sentence version.</p>
<p>In my case, it was a long slog and there were a lot of things I wasn&rsquo;t good at initially.</p>
<p>But so initially, I was good at high school math.</p>
<p>I was good at high school science.</p>
<p>I loved astronomy and I realized those could all fit together.</p>
<p>Like the day I realized you could be an astronomer for a job, it has to be one of my top days</p>
<p>of my life.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that you could be that for a job and I was good at all those things.</p>
<p>And although my dad wanted me to do something more practical where he could be guaranteed</p>
<p>I could support myself was another option, but initially I wasn&rsquo;t that good at physics.</p>
<p>It was a slog to just get through school and grad school is a very, very long time.</p>
<p>And ultimately, when faced with a choice and I had the luxury of choosing, knowing that</p>
<p>I was good at something and also loved it, it really carried me through.</p>
<p>Now, I asked some of the smartest people in the world the most ridiculous question.</p>
<p>We already talked about it a little bit, but let me ask again, why are we here?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve raised this question in one of your presentations as like one of the things</p>
<p>that we kind of as humans long to answer and the search for exoplanets is kind of part</p>
<p>of that.</p>
<p>But what do you think is the meaning of it all, of life?</p>
<p>I wish I had a good answer for you.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re the first person ever who refused to answer the question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much refusing, I just, yeah, I mean, I wish I had a better answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the meaning is wishing there was a meaning, wishing we knew.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great way to say it.</p>
<p>Sarah, like I said, the book is excellent.</p>
