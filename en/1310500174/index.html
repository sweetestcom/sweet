    <p>The following is a conversation with Ronald Sullivan, a professor at Harvard Law School</p>
<p>known for taking on difficult and controversial cases.</p>
<p>He was on the head legal defense team for the Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez</p>
<p>in his double murder case.</p>
<p>He represented one of the Gena 6 defendants and never lost the case during his years in</p>
<p>Washington D.C.&rsquo;s Public Defender Services office.</p>
<p>In 2019, Ronald joined the legal defense team of Harvey Weinstein, a film producer</p>
<p>facing multiple charges of rape and other sexual assault.</p>
<p>This decision met with criticism from Harvard University students, including an online petition</p>
<p>by students seeking his removal as faculty dean of Winthrop House.</p>
<p>Then, a letter supporting him signed by 52 Harvard Law School professors appeared in</p>
<p>the Boston Globe on March 8, 2019.</p>
<p>Following this, the Harvard administration succumbed to the pressure of a few Harvard</p>
<p>students and announced that they will not be renewing Ronald Sullivan&rsquo;s dean position.</p>
<p>This created a major backlash in the public discourse over the necessary role of universities</p>
<p>in upholding the principles of law and freedom at the very foundation of the United States.</p>
<p>This conversation is brought to you by Brooklyn &amp; Sheets, WineAxis online wine store, Monk</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that the free exchange of difficult ideas is the only mechanism through</p>
<p>which we can make progress.</p>
<p>Truth is not a safe space.</p>
<p>Truth is humbling, and being humbled can hurt.</p>
<p>But this is the role of education, not just in the university but in business and in life.</p>
<p>Freedom and compassion can coexist, but it requires work and patience.</p>
<p>It requires listening to the voices and to the experiences unlike our own.</p>
<p>Listening, not silencing.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Ronald Sullivan.</p>
<p>You were one of the lawyers who represented the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in</p>
<p>advance of a sexual assault trial.</p>
<p>For this, Harvard forced you to step down as faculty deans, you and your wife of Winthrop</p>
<p>House.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of this saga from first deciding to represent Harvey Weinstein to</p>
<p>the interesting complicated events that followed?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>So I got a call one morning from a colleague at the Harvard Law School who asked if I would</p>
<p>consent to taking a call from Harvey.</p>
<p>He wanted to meet me and chat with me about representing him.</p>
<p>I said yes, and one thing led to another.</p>
<p>I drove out to Connecticut where he was staying and met with him and some of his advisors,</p>
<p>and then a day or two later, I decided to take the case.</p>
<p>This would have been back in January of 2019, I believe.</p>
<p>So the sort of cases, I have a very small practice most of my time is teaching and writing,</p>
<p>but I tend to take cases that most deem to be impossible.</p>
<p>I take the challenging sorts of cases, and this fit the bill.</p>
<p>It was quite challenging in the sense that everyone had prejudged the case.</p>
<p>When I say everyone, I just mean the general sentiment in the public had the case prejudged,</p>
<p>even though the specific allegations did not regard any of the people in the New Yorker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the New Yorker article that exposed everything that was going on, allegedly, with Harvey.</p>
<p>So I decided to take the case, and I did.</p>
<p>Is there a philosophy behind you taking on these very difficult cases?</p>
<p>Is it a set of principles?</p>
<p>Is it just your love of the law, or is there a set of principles why you take on the cases?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d like to take on hard cases, and I like to take on the cases that are with</p>
<p>unpopular defendants, unpopular clients.</p>
<p>With respect to the latter, that&rsquo;s where Harvey Weinstein fell, it&rsquo;s because we need lawyers</p>
<p>and good lawyers to take the unpopular cases, because those sorts of cases determine what</p>
<p>sort of criminal justice system we have.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t protect the rights and the liberties of those whom the society deems to be the</p>
<p>least and the last, the unpopular client, then that&rsquo;s the camel&rsquo;s nose under the tent.</p>
<p>If we let the camel&rsquo;s nose under the tent, the entire tent is going to collapse.</p>
<p>That is to say, if we short circuit the rights of a client like Harvey Weinstein, then the</p>
<p>next thing you know, someone will be at your door, knocking it down and violating your</p>
<p>rights.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain creep there with respect to the way in which the state will respect</p>
<p>the civil rights and civil liberties of people, and these are the sorts of cases that test</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>For example, there was a young man many, many years ago named Ernesto Miranda.</p>
<p>By all accounts, he was not a likable guy.</p>
<p>He was a three time knife thief and not a likable guy, but lawyers stepped up and took</p>
<p>his case.</p>
<p>Because of that, we now have the Miranda warnings, you have the right to remain silent.</p>
<p>Those warnings that officers are forced to give to people.</p>
<p>So it is through these cases that we express oftentimes the best values in our criminal</p>
<p>justice system.</p>
<p>So I proudly take on these sorts of cases in order to vindicate not only the individual</p>
<p>rights of the person whom I&rsquo;m representing, but the rights of citizens writ large, most</p>
<p>of whom do not experience the criminal justice system, and it&rsquo;s partly because of lawyers</p>
<p>who take on these sorts of cases and establish rules that protect us, average everyday ordinary</p>
<p>concrete citizens.</p>
<p>From a psychological perspective, just you as a human, is there fear, is there stress</p>
<p>from all the pressure?</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re facing, I mean, the whole point, a difficult case, especially in the</p>
<p>latter that you mentioned of the going against popular opinion, you have the eyes of millions</p>
<p>potentially looking at you with anger as you try to defend this set of laws that this country&rsquo;s</p>
<p>built on.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t stress me out particularly.</p>
<p>It sort of comes with the territory.</p>
<p>I try not to get too excited in either direction.</p>
<p>So a big part of my practice is wrongful convictions, and I&rsquo;ve gotten over 6,000 people out of</p>
<p>prison who&rsquo;ve been wrongfully incarcerated, and a subset of those people have been convicted,</p>
<p>and people who&rsquo;ve been in jail 20, 30 years who have gotten out.</p>
<p>And those are the sorts of cases where people praise you and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And so, look, I do the work that I do, I&rsquo;m proud of the work that I do, and in that sense</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of a part time Daoist, the expression reversal is the movement of the Dao.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t get too high, I don&rsquo;t get too low, I just try to do my work and represent</p>
<p>people to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>So one of the hardest cases of recent history would be the Harvey Weinstein in terms of</p>
<p>popular opinion or unpopular opinion.</p>
<p>So if you continue on that line, where does that story take you, of taking on this case?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I took on the case and then there was a few students at the college.</p>
<p>So let me back up, I had an administrative post at Harvard College, which is a separate</p>
<p>entity from the Harvard Law School, Harvard College is the undergraduate portion of Harvard</p>
<p>University and the law school is obviously the law school, and I initially was appointed</p>
<p>as master of one of the houses.</p>
<p>We did a name change five or six years into it and were called faculty deans.</p>
<p>But the houses at Harvard are based on the college system of Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<p>So when students go to Harvard after their first year, they&rsquo;re assigned to a particular</p>
<p>house or college and that&rsquo;s where they live and eat and so forth.</p>
<p>And these are undergraduate students?</p>
<p>These are undergraduate students.</p>
<p>So I was responsible for one of the houses as its faculty dean.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an administrative appointment at the college and some students who clearly didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like Harvey Weinstein began to protest about the representation.</p>
<p>And from there, it just mushroomed into one of the most craven, cowardly acts by any university</p>
<p>in modern history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a complete and utter repudiation of academic freedom.</p>
<p>And it is a decision that Harvard certainly will live to regret, frankly, it&rsquo;s an embarrassment.</p>
<p>We expect students to do what students do and I encourage students to have their voices</p>
<p>heard and to protest.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what students do.</p>
<p>What is vexing are the adults.</p>
<p>The dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Claudine Gay, absolutely craven and cowardly.</p>
<p>The dean of the college, same thing, Rakesh Khurana, craven and cowardly.</p>
<p>They capitulated to the loudest voice in the room and ran around afraid of 19 year olds.</p>
<p>Oh, 19 year olds are upset that I need to do something.</p>
<p>And it appeared to me that they so desired the approval of students that they were afraid</p>
<p>to make the tough decision and the right decision.</p>
<p>It really could have been an important teaching moment at Harvard.</p>
<p>Very important teaching moment.</p>
<p>So they forced you to step down from that faculty dean position at the house.</p>
<p>I would push back on the description a little bit.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t write the, you know, the references to the op ed I did in New York time.</p>
<p>Harvard made a mistake by making me step down or something like that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t write those things.</p>
<p>I did not step down and refuse to step down.</p>
<p>Harvard declined to renew my contract.</p>
<p>And I made it clear that I was not going to resign as a matter of principle and forced</p>
<p>them to do the cowardly act that they, in fact, did.</p>
<p>And you know, the worst thing about this, they did the college, Dean Gay and Dean Khurana,</p>
<p>commissioned this survey.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never done this before.</p>
<p>Survey from the students, you know, how do you feel at Winthrop House?</p>
<p>And the funny thing about the survey is they never released the results.</p>
<p>Why did they never release the results?</p>
<p>They never released the results because I would bet my salary that the results came</p>
<p>back positive for me.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t fit their narrative because most of the students were fine.</p>
<p>Most of the students were fine.</p>
<p>It was the loudest voice in the room.</p>
<p>So they never released it, and I challenged them to this day, release it, release it.</p>
<p>But no, they wanted to create this narrative.</p>
<p>And when the data didn&rsquo;t support the narrative, then they just got silent, oh, we&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to release it.</p>
<p>The students demanded it.</p>
<p>I demanded it.</p>
<p>And they wouldn&rsquo;t release it because I just know in my heart of hearts that it came back</p>
<p>in my favor that most students at Winthrop House said they were fine.</p>
<p>There was a group of students that weaponized the term unsafe.</p>
<p>They said we felt unsafe, and they bantied this term about.</p>
<p>But again, I&rsquo;m confident that the majority of students at Winthrop House said they felt</p>
<p>completely fine and felt safe and so forth.</p>
<p>And the supermajority, I am confident, either said I feel great at Winthrop or I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>one way or the other.</p>
<p>And then there was some minority who had a different view.</p>
<p>But lessons learned, it was a wonderful opportunity at Winthrop.</p>
<p>I met some amazing students over my 10 years as master and then faculty dean, and I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>in touch with a number of students, some of whom are now my students at the law school.</p>
<p>So in the end, I thought it ended up being a great experience, the national media was</p>
<p>just wonderful in this, just wonderful.</p>
<p>People wrote such wonderful articles and accounts and wagged their finger appropriately at Harvard.</p>
<p>Compare me to John Adams, which I don&rsquo;t think is an apt comparison, but it&rsquo;s always great</p>
<p>to read something like that.</p>
<p>But anyway, that was the Harvard versus Harvey situation.</p>
<p>So that seems like a seminal mistake by Harvard, and Harvard is one of the great universities</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And sort of its successes and its mistakes are really important for the world as a beacon</p>
<p>of how we make progress.</p>
<p>So what lessons for the bigger academia that&rsquo;s under fire a lot these days, what bigger lessons</p>
<p>do you take away?</p>
<p>Like how do we make Harvard great?</p>
<p>How do we make other universities, Yale, MIT great in the face of such mistakes?</p>
<p>Well, I think that we have moved into a model where we have the consumerization of education.</p>
<p>That is to say, we have feckless administrators who make policy based on what the students</p>
<p>say.</p>
<p>Now this comment is not intended to suggest that students have no voice in governance,</p>
<p>but it is to suggest that the faculty are there for a reason.</p>
<p>They are among the greatest minds on the planet Earth in their particular fields, at schools</p>
<p>like Harvard and Yale, Stanford, the schools that you mentioned, MIT, quite literally the</p>
<p>greatest minds on Earth, they are there for a reason.</p>
<p>Things like curriculum and so forth are rightly in the province of faculty.</p>
<p>And while you take input and critique and so forth, ultimately, the grownups in the</p>
<p>room have to be sufficiently responsible to take charge and to direct the course of a</p>
<p>student&rsquo;s education.</p>
<p>And my situation is one example where it really could have been an excellent teaching moment</p>
<p>about the value of the Sixth Amendment, about what it means to treat people who are in the</p>
<p>crosshairs of the criminal justice system, but rather than having that conversation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just this consumerization model, well, there&rsquo;s a lot of noise out here, so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to react in this sort of way.</p>
<p>Higher education as well, unfortunately, has been commodified in other sorts of ways that</p>
<p>has reduced or impeded, hampered these schools commitments to free and robust and open dialogue.</p>
<p>So to the degree that academic freedom doesn&rsquo;t sit squarely at the center of the academic</p>
<p>mission, any school is going to be in trouble.</p>
<p>And I really hope that we weather this current political moment where 19 year olds without</p>
<p>degrees are running universities and get back to a system where faculty, where adults make</p>
<p>decisions in the best interests of the university and the best interests of the student.</p>
<p>Even to the degree though, some of those decisions may be unpopular, and that is going to require</p>
<p>a certain courage and hopefully in time, and I&rsquo;m confident that in time, administrators</p>
<p>are going to begin to push back on these current trends.</p>
<p>Harvard&rsquo;s been around for a long time, it&rsquo;s been around for a long time for a reason,</p>
<p>and one of the reasons is that it understands itself not to be static.</p>
<p>So I have every view that Harvard is going to adapt and get itself back on course and</p>
<p>be around another 400 years, at least that&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>So I mean, what this kind of boils down to is just having difficult conversation, difficult</p>
<p>debates.</p>
<p>When you mentioned sort of 19 year olds, and it&rsquo;s funny, I&rsquo;ve seen this even at MIT, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that they shouldn&rsquo;t have a voice.</p>
<p>They do seem to, I guess you have to experience it and just observe it.</p>
<p>They have a strangely disproportionate power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting to basically, I mean, you say, yes, there&rsquo;s great faculty and so</p>
<p>on, but it&rsquo;s not even just that the faculty is smart or wise or whatever, it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just silenced.</p>
<p>So the terminology that you mentioned is weaponized as sort of safe spaces or that certain conversations</p>
<p>make people feel unsafe.</p>
<p>What do you think about this kind of idea?</p>
<p>Is there some things that are unsafe to talk about in the university setting?</p>
<p>Is there lines to be drawn somewhere?</p>
<p>And just like you said on the flip side with a slippery slope, is it too easy for the lines</p>
<p>to be drawn everywhere?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So this idea of unsafe space, at least the vocabulary derives from some research, academic</p>
<p>research about feeling psychologically unsafe.</p>
<p>And so the notion here is that there are forms of psychological disquiet that impedes people</p>
<p>from experiencing the educational environment to the greatest degree possible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the argument.</p>
<p>And assuming for a moment that people do have these feelings of disquiet at elite universities</p>
<p>like MIT and like Harvard, that&rsquo;s probably the safest space people are going to be in</p>
<p>for their lives because when they get out into the quote unquote real world, they won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the sorts of nets that these schools provide, safety nets that these schools provide.</p>
<p>So to the extent that research is descriptive of a psychological feeling, I think that the</p>
<p>duty of the universities are to challenge people.</p>
<p>Seems to me that it&rsquo;s a shame to go to a place like Harvard or a place like MIT, Yale, any</p>
<p>of these great institutions and come out the same person that you were when you went in.</p>
<p>That seems to be a horrible waste of four years and money and resources.</p>
<p>Rather, we ought to challenge students, that they grow, challenge some of their most deeply</p>
<p>held assumptions.</p>
<p>They may continue to hold them, but the point of an education is to rigorously interrogate</p>
<p>these fundamental assumptions that have guided you thus far and to do it fairly and civilly.</p>
<p>So to the extent that there are lines that should be drawn, there&rsquo;s a long tradition</p>
<p>in the university of civil discourse.</p>
<p>So you should draw a line somewhere between civil discourse and uncivil discourse.</p>
<p>The purpose of a university is to talk difficult conversations, tough issues, talk directly</p>
<p>and frankly, but do it civilly.</p>
<p>Also to yell and cuss at somebody and that sort of thing, well, do that on your own space,</p>
<p>but observe the norms of civil discourse at the university.</p>
<p>So look, I think that the presumption ought to be that the most difficult topics are appropriate</p>
<p>to talk about at a university.</p>
<p>That ought to be the presumption.</p>
<p>Now should MIT, for example, give its imprimatur to someone who is espousing the flat earth</p>
<p>theory, the earth is flat, right?</p>
<p>If certain ideas are so contrary to the scientific and cultural thinking of the moment, yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s space there to draw a line and say, yeah, we&rsquo;re not going to give you this platform</p>
<p>to tell our students that the earth is flat.</p>
<p>But a topic that&rsquo;s controversial, but contestatory, that&rsquo;s what universities are for.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the idea, present better ideas and articulate them.</p>
<p>And I think there needs to be a mechanism outside of the space of ideas of humbling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done martial arts for a long time.</p>
<p>I got my ass kicked a lot.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>In the space of ideas, I mean, even just in engineering, just all the math classes, my</p>
<p>memories of math, which I love, is kind of pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically coming face to face with the idea that I&rsquo;m not special, that I&rsquo;m much dumber</p>
<p>than I thought I was, and that accomplishing anything in this world requires really hard</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really humbling.</p>
<p>That puts you, because I remember when I was 18 and 19, and I thought I was going to be</p>
<p>the smartest, the best fighter, the Nobel Prize winning, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then you come face to face with reality, and it hurts.</p>
<p>And it feels like there needs to be efficient mechanisms from the best universities in the</p>
<p>world without abusing you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very difficult line to walk without mentally or physically abusing you, be able</p>
<p>to humble you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I felt was missing in these very difficult, very important conversations</p>
<p>is the 19 year olds, when they spoke up, the mechanism for humbling them with ideas was</p>
<p>missing.</p>
<p>It kind of got broken down because, as you say, I sensed fear.</p>
<p>Everything was permeated with fear.</p>
<p>And fear is paralyzing, fear is destructive, especially in a place that&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>all about freedom of ideas.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you have anything, any thoughts to say on this whole idea of cancel</p>
<p>culture, where people, a lot of people use it as become political, so staying maybe</p>
<p>outside of the world of politics.</p>
<p>Is this, do you have thoughts about it, does it bother you that people are sort of put</p>
<p>in this bin and labeled as something and then thereby you can ignore everything they say?</p>
<p>I mean, Steven Pinker, there&rsquo;s a lot of Harvard folks that are fighting against these set</p>
<p>of ideas, but do you have thoughts?</p>
<p>I think that we as a culture are way, way, way too quick to cancel people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s become almost reflexive now, someone says something or makes an offhand comment,</p>
<p>even a mistake, there&rsquo;s a move to simply cancel folks.</p>
<p>So I think that this, quote unquote, cancel culture has really gotten out of control at</p>
<p>this point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s forcing people to be robotic in many ways.</p>
<p>No offense to robots.</p>
<p>I was going to say, now I know I&rsquo;m venturing into your intellectual domain.</p>
<p>For future robots watching this, no offense.</p>
<p>And there are minutes discouraging a lot of good people from getting into public life</p>
<p>in any sort of way, because who needs the stress of it?</p>
<p>Well, in some sense, you&rsquo;re an inspiration that you&rsquo;re able to withstand the pressure</p>
<p>of the masses.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a sad aspect of human nature that we kind of get into these crowds and we start</p>
<p>chanting and it&rsquo;s fun for some reason, and then you forget yourself and then you sort</p>
<p>of wake up the next day not having anticipated the consequences of all the chanting.</p>
<p>And we would get ourselves in trouble in that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some responsibility on social networks and the mechanisms by which they</p>
<p>make it more frictionless to do the chanting, to do the canceling, to do the outrage and</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I actually, on the technology side, have a hope that that&rsquo;s fixable.</p>
<p>But yeah, it does seem to be, you know, it almost like the internet showed to us that</p>
<p>we have a lot of broken ways about which we communicate with each other and we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to figure that out.</p>
<p>Same with the university.</p>
<p>This mistake by Harvard showed that we need to reinvent what the university is.</p>
<p>I mean, all of this is, it&rsquo;s almost like we&rsquo;re finding our baby deer legs and trying to strengthen</p>
<p>the institutions that have been very successful for a long time.</p>
<p>You know, the really interesting thing about Harvey Weinstein and you choosing these exceptionally</p>
<p>difficult cases is also thinking about what it means to defend evil people, what it means</p>
<p>to defend these, we could say unpopular, and you might push back against the word evil,</p>
<p>but bad people in society.</p>
<p>First of all, do you think there&rsquo;s such a thing as evil or do you think all people are</p>
<p>good and it&rsquo;s just circumstances that create evil?</p>
<p>And also, is there somebody too evil for the law to defend?</p>
<p>So the first question, that&rsquo;s a deep philosophical question, whether the category of evil does</p>
<p>any work for me.</p>
<p>It does for me.</p>
<p>I do think that, I do subscribe to that category that there is evil in the world as conventionally</p>
<p>understood.</p>
<p>So there are many who will say, yeah, that just doesn&rsquo;t do any work for me.</p>
<p>But the category evil, in fact, does intellectual work for me and I understand it as something</p>
<p>that exists.</p>
<p>Is it genetic or is it the circumstance?</p>
<p>What kind of work does it do for you intellectually?</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s highly contingent, that is to say that the conditions in which one</p>
<p>grows up and so forth begins to create this category that we may think of as evil.</p>
<p>Now there are studies and whatnot that show that certain brain abnormalities and so forth</p>
<p>are more prevalent in, say, serial killer.</p>
<p>So there may be a biological predisposition to certain forms of conduct, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the biological evidence to make a statement that someone is born evil and I&rsquo;m not a determinist</p>
<p>thinker in that way, so you come out the womb evil and you&rsquo;re destined to be that way.</p>
<p>To the extent there may be biological determinants, they still require some nurture as well.</p>
<p>But do you still put a responsibility on the individual?</p>
<p>Of course, yeah.</p>
<p>We all make choices and so some responsibility on the individual indeed.</p>
<p>We live in a culture, unfortunately, where a lot of people have a constellation of bad</p>
<p>choices in front of them and that makes me very sad.</p>
<p>Some people grow up with predominantly bad choices in front of them and that&rsquo;s unfair</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s on all of us, but yes, I do think we make choices.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s so powerful, the constellation of bad choices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a powerful way to think about equality, which is the set of trajectories</p>
<p>before you that you could take.</p>
<p>If you just roll the dice, life is a kind of optimization problem, sorry to take this</p>
<p>into math, over a set of trajectories under imperfect information.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to do a lot of stupid shit to put it in technical terms, but the fraction</p>
<p>of the trajectories that take you into bad places or into good places is really important</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s ultimately what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And evil might be just a little bit of a predisposition biologically, but the rest is just trajectories</p>
<p>that you can take.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying Hitler a lot recently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading probably way too much and it&rsquo;s interesting to think about all the possible</p>
<p>trajectories that could have avoided this particular individual developing the hate</p>
<p>that he did, the following that he did, the actual final, there&rsquo;s a few turns in him psychologically</p>
<p>where he went from being a leader that just wants to conquer and to somebody who allowed</p>
<p>his anger and emotion to take over, to where he started making mistakes in terms of militarily</p>
<p>speaking, but also started doing evil things.</p>
<p>And all the possible trajectories that could have avoided that are fascinating, including</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t that bad at painting, at drawing from the very beginning and his time in Vienna,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these possible things to think about and of course there&rsquo;s millions of others</p>
<p>like him that never came to power and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But that goes to the second question on the side of evil.</p>
<p>Do you think, and Hitler&rsquo;s often brought up as like an example of somebody who is like</p>
<p>the epitome of evil, do you think you would, if you got that same phone call after World</p>
<p>War II and Hitler survived during the trial for war crimes, would you take the case defending</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to answer that one, is there a line to draw for evil for who not to defend?</p>
<p>No, I think everyone, I&rsquo;ll do the second one first, everyone has a right to a defense</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re charged criminally in the United States of America.</p>
<p>So no, I do not think that there&rsquo;s someone so evil that they do not deserve a defense.</p>
<p>Process matters.</p>
<p>Process helps us get to results more accurately than we would otherwise.</p>
<p>So it is important and it&rsquo;s vitally important and indeed more important for someone deemed</p>
<p>to be evil to receive the same quantum of process and the same substance of process</p>
<p>that anyone else would.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vitally important to the health of our criminal justice system for that to happen.</p>
<p>So yes, everybody, Hitler included, were he charged in the United States for a crime that</p>
<p>occurred in the United States, yes.</p>
<p>Whether I would do it, if I were a public defender and assigned the case, yes, I started</p>
<p>my career as a public defender.</p>
<p>I represent anyone who was assigned to me.</p>
<p>I think that is our duty.</p>
<p>In private practice, I have choices and I likely, based on the hypo you gave me, and</p>
<p>I would tweak it a bit because it would have to be a U.S. crime.</p>
<p>But I get the broader point and don&rsquo;t want to bog down in technicalities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d likely pass right now as I see it, unless it was a case where nobody else would represent</p>
<p>him, then I would think that I have some sort of duty and obligation to do it.</p>
<p>But yes, everyone absolutely deserves a right to competent counsel.</p>
<p>That is a beautiful ideal, it&rsquo;s difficult to think about it in the face of public pressure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of terrifying to watch the masses during this past year</p>
<p>of 2020, to watch the power of the masses to make a decision before any of the data</p>
<p>is out, if the data is ever out, any of the details, any of the processes, and there is</p>
<p>an anger to the justice system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that feel like even though the ideal you describe is a beautiful</p>
<p>one, it does not always operate justly.</p>
<p>It does not operate to the best of its ideals, it operates unfairly.</p>
<p>When we go to the big picture of the criminal justice system, what do you, given the ideal,</p>
<p>works about our criminal justice system and what is broken?</p>
<p>Well there&rsquo;s a lot broken right now, and I usually focus on that.</p>
<p>But in truth, a lot works about our criminal justice system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an old joke, and it&rsquo;s funny, but it carries a lot of truth to it.</p>
<p>And the joke is that in the United States, we have the worst criminal justice system</p>
<p>in the world, except for every place else.</p>
<p>And yes, we certainly have a number of problems, and a lot of problems based on race and class,</p>
<p>and economics, station, but we have a process that privileges liberty.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good feature of the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>The idea of the relationship between the individual and the state is such that in the United States,</p>
<p>we privilege liberty over and above very many values, so much so that a statement by increased</p>
<p>Mather not terribly far from where we&rsquo;re sitting right now has gained traction over</p>
<p>all these years, and it&rsquo;s that better ten guilty go free than one innocent person convicted.</p>
<p>That is an expression of the way in which we understand liberty to operate in our collective</p>
<p>consciousness.</p>
<p>We would rather a bunch of guilty people go free than to impact the liberty interests</p>
<p>of any individual person.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a guiding principle in our criminal justice system, liberty.</p>
<p>So we set a process that makes it difficult to convict people.</p>
<p>We have rules of procedure that are cumbersome and that slow down the process and that exclude</p>
<p>otherwise reliable evidence, and this is all because we place a value on liberty.</p>
<p>And I think these are good things, and it says a lot about our criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Some of the bad features have to do with the way in which this country sees color as a</p>
<p>proxy for criminality and treats people of color in radically different ways in the criminal</p>
<p>justice system, from arrests to charging decisions to sentencing.</p>
<p>People of color are disproportionately impacted on all sorts of registers.</p>
<p>One example, and it&rsquo;s a popular one, that although there appears to be no distinguishable</p>
<p>difference between drug use by whites and blacks in the country, blacks, though only</p>
<p>12% of the population represent 40% of the drug charges in the country, there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>disequities along race and class in the criminal justice system that we really have to fix.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve grown to more than bugs in the system and have become features, unfortunately,</p>
<p>of our system.</p>
<p>Oh, to make it more efficient, to make judgments, so the racism makes it more efficient.</p>
<p>It efficiently moves people from society to the streets, and a lot of innocent people</p>
<p>get caught up in that.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask in terms of the innocents.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of people who are innocent, I guess, revealed their innocence, demonstrated</p>
<p>their innocence.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that process like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like emotionally, psychologically?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like legally to fight the system through the process of revealing the innocence</p>
<p>of a human being?</p>
<p>Yeah, emotionally and psychologically, it can be taxing.</p>
<p>I follow a model of what&rsquo;s called empathic representation, and that is I get to know</p>
<p>my clients and their family, that I get to know their strivings, their aspirations, their</p>
<p>fears, their sorrows.</p>
<p>So that certainly sometimes can do psychic injury on one.</p>
<p>If you get really invested and really sad or happy, it does become emotionally taxing.</p>
<p>But the idea of someone sitting in jail for 20 years completely innocent of a crime, can</p>
<p>you imagine sitting there every day for 20 years knowing that you factually did not do</p>
<p>the thing that you were convicted of by a jury of your peers?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be the most incredible thing in the world.</p>
<p>But the people who do it and the people who make it and come out on the other side as</p>
<p>productive citizens are folks who say they&rsquo;ve come to an inner peace in their own minds</p>
<p>and they say, these bars aren&rsquo;t going to define me, that my humanity is there and it&rsquo;s immutable.</p>
<p>And they are not bitter, which is amazing.</p>
<p>I tend to think that I&rsquo;m not that good of a person.</p>
<p>I would be bitter for every day of 20 years if I were in jail for something.</p>
<p>But people tell me that they can&rsquo;t survive, that one cannot survive like that.</p>
<p>And you have to come to terms with it.</p>
<p>And the people whom I&rsquo;ve exonerated, most of them come out and they just really just</p>
<p>take on life with a vim and vigor without bitterness.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing to see.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to eradicate racism from the judicial system?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I think that race insinuates itself in all aspects of our lives and the judicial system</p>
<p>is not immune from that.</p>
<p>So to the extent we begin to eradicate dangerous and deleterious race thinking from society</p>
<p>generally, then it will be eradicated from the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do and I think it&rsquo;ll be a while, but I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doable.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the country ‚Äì so historians will look back 300 years from now and take</p>
<p>note of the incredible journey of diasporic Africans in the U.S., an incredible journey</p>
<p>from slavery to the heights of politics and business and judiciary and the academy and</p>
<p>so forth in not a lot of time, in actually not a lot of time.</p>
<p>And if we can have that sort of movement historically, let&rsquo;s think about what the next 175 years</p>
<p>will look like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s going to be short, but I&rsquo;m saying that if we keep at it, keep</p>
<p>getting to know each other a little better, keep enforcing laws that prohibit the sort</p>
<p>of race based discrimination that people have experienced and provide as a society opportunities</p>
<p>for people to thrive in this world, then I think we can see a better world and if we</p>
<p>see a better world, we&rsquo;ll see a better judicial system.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating if you look throughout history and race is just part</p>
<p>of that is we create the other and treat the other with disdain through the legal system,</p>
<p>but just through human nature.</p>
<p>I tend to believe, we mentioned offline that I work with robots.</p>
<p>It sounds absurd to say, especially to you, especially because we&rsquo;re talking about racism</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so prevalent today, I do believe that there will be almost like a civil rights</p>
<p>movement for robots because I think there&rsquo;s a huge value to society of having artificial</p>
<p>intelligence systems that interact with humans and are human like and the more they become</p>
<p>human like, they will start to ask very fundamentally human questions about freedom, about suffering,</p>
<p>about justice, and they will have to come face to face, like look in the mirror in asking</p>
<p>the question, just because we&rsquo;re biologically based, just because we&rsquo;re sort of, well, just</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re human, does that mean we&rsquo;re the only ones that deserve the rights?</p>
<p>Again, giving, forming another other group, which is robots, and I&rsquo;m sure there could</p>
<p>be along that path different versions of other that we form.</p>
<p>So racism, race is certainly a big other that we&rsquo;ve made, as you said, a lot of progress</p>
<p>on throughout the history of this country, but it does feel like we always create, as</p>
<p>we make progress, create new other groups.</p>
<p>And of course the other group that perhaps is outside the legal system that people talk</p>
<p>about is the essential, now I eat a lot of meat, but the torture of animals, the people</p>
<p>talk about when we look back from a couple of centuries from now, look back at the kind</p>
<p>of things we&rsquo;re doing to animals, we might regret that, we might see that in a very different</p>
<p>light.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to see the future trajectory of what we wake up to about the</p>
<p>injustice in our ways.</p>
<p>But the robot one is the one I&rsquo;m especially focused on, but at this moment in time it</p>
<p>seems ridiculous, but I&rsquo;m sure most civil rights movements throughout history seem ridiculous</p>
<p>at first.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting, sort of outside of my intellectual bailiwick robots, as I understand</p>
<p>the development of artificial intelligence, though the aspect that still is missing is</p>
<p>this notion of consciousness, and that it&rsquo;s consciousness that is the thing that will</p>
<p>move if it were to exist, and I&rsquo;m not saying that it can or will, but if it were to exist</p>
<p>would move robots from machines to something different, something that experienced the</p>
<p>world in a way analogous to how we experience it.</p>
<p>And also as I understand the science, there&rsquo;s, unlike what you see on television, that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not there yet in terms of this notion of the machines having a consciousness.</p>
<p>Or a great general intelligence, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>A huge amount of progress has been made, and it&rsquo;s fascinating to watch, so I&rsquo;m on both</p>
<p>minds as a person who&rsquo;s building them, I&rsquo;m realizing how sort of quote unquote dumb they</p>
<p>are, but also looking at human history and how poor we are predicting the progress of</p>
<p>innovation and technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that we have to be humble by our ability to predict, coupled with the fact</p>
<p>that we keep, to use terminology carefully here, we keep discriminating against the intelligence</p>
<p>of artificial systems.</p>
<p>The smarter they get, the more ways we find to dismiss their intelligence.</p>
<p>So this has just been going on throughout.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if we&rsquo;re threatened in the most primitive human way, animalistic way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re threatened by the power of other creatures, and we want to lessen, dismiss them.</p>
<p>So consciousness is a really important one, but the one I think about a lot in terms of</p>
<p>consciousness, the very engineering question, is whether the display of consciousness is</p>
<p>the same as the possession of consciousness.</p>
<p>So if a robot tells you they are conscious, if a robot looks like they&rsquo;re suffering when</p>
<p>you torture them, if a robot is afraid of death and says they&rsquo;re afraid of death and</p>
<p>are legitimately afraid, in terms of just everything we as humans use to determine the</p>
<p>ability of somebody to be their own entity, they&rsquo;re the one that loves, one that fears,</p>
<p>one that hopes, one that can suffer, if a robot in the dumbest of ways is able to display</p>
<p>that, it starts changing things very quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what it is, but it does seem that there&rsquo;s a huge component to consciousness</p>
<p>that is a social creation, like we together create our consciousness, like we believe</p>
<p>our common humanity together.</p>
<p>Alone we wouldn&rsquo;t be aware of our humanity, and the law as it protects our freedoms seems</p>
<p>to be a construct of the social construct, and when you add other creatures into it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not obvious to me that you have to build, there&rsquo;ll be a moment when you say, this thing</p>
<p>is now conscious.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of fake it until you make it, and there&rsquo;ll be a very</p>
<p>gray area between fake and make that is going to force us to contend with what it means</p>
<p>to be an entity that deserves rights, where all men are created equal.</p>
<p>The men part might have to expand in ways that we are not yet anticipating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, my favorite, the fundamental thing I love about artificial intelligence is it</p>
<p>gets smarter and smarter.</p>
<p>It challenges to think of what is right, the questions of justice, questions of freedom.</p>
<p>It basically challenges us to understand our own mind, to understand what, almost from</p>
<p>an engineering first principles perspective, to understand what it is that makes us human,</p>
<p>that is at the core of all the rights that we talk about and all the documents we write.</p>
<p>So even if we don&rsquo;t give rights to artificial intelligence systems, we may be able to construct</p>
<p>more fair legal systems to protect us humans.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, interesting ontological question between the performance of consciousness and</p>
<p>actual consciousness to the extent that actual consciousness is anything beyond some contingent</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve posed a number of interesting philosophical questions, and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also, it strikes me that philosophers of religion would pose another set of questions as well</p>
<p>when you deal with issues of structure versus soul, body versus soul, and it will be a complicated</p>
<p>mix and I suspect I&rsquo;ll be dust by the time those questions get worked out.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, the soul is a fun one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no soul, I&rsquo;m not sure maybe you can correct me, but there&rsquo;s very few discussion</p>
<p>of soul in our legal system, right?</p>
<p>Right, correct, none.</p>
<p>But there is a discussion about what constitutes a human being, and I mean, you gestured at</p>
<p>the notion of the potential of the law widening the domain of a human being.</p>
<p>So in that sense, right, you know, people are very angry because they can&rsquo;t get sort</p>
<p>of pain and suffering damages if someone negligently kills a pet because a pet is not a human being.</p>
<p>And people say, well, I love my pet, but the law sees a pet as chattel, as property like</p>
<p>this water bottle.</p>
<p>So the current legal definitions trade on a definition of humanity that may not be worked</p>
<p>out in any sophisticated way, but certainly there&rsquo;s a broad and shared understanding</p>
<p>of what it means.</p>
<p>So it probably doesn&rsquo;t explicitly contain a definition of something like soul, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more robust than, you know, a carbon based organism, that there&rsquo;s something a little</p>
<p>more distinct about what the law thinks a human being is.</p>
<p>So if we can dive into, we&rsquo;ve already been doing it, but if we can dive into more difficult</p>
<p>territory.</p>
<p>So 2020 had the tragic case of George Floyd.</p>
<p>Can you reflect on the protests, on the racial tensions over the death of George Floyd?</p>
<p>How do you make sense of it all?</p>
<p>What do you take away from these events?</p>
<p>The George Floyd moment occurred at an historical moment where people were in quarantine for</p>
<p>COVID, and people have these cell phones to a degree greater than we&rsquo;ve ever had them</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>And this was sort of the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back after a number of these sorts</p>
<p>of cell phone videos surfaced.</p>
<p>People were fed up.</p>
<p>There was unimpeachable evidence of a form of mistreatment, whether it constitutes murder</p>
<p>or manslaughter, the trial is going on now, and jurors will figure that out, but there</p>
<p>was widespread appreciation that a fellow human being was mistreated, that we were just</p>
<p>talking about humanity, that there was not a sufficient recognition of this person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>humanity.</p>
<p>The common humanity of this person, yeah.</p>
<p>The common humanity of this person, well said.</p>
<p>And people were fed up.</p>
<p>So we were already in this COVID space where we were exercising care for one another, and</p>
<p>there was just an explosion, the likes of which this country hasn&rsquo;t seen since the civil</p>
<p>rights protests of the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>And people simply said, enough, enough, enough, enough.</p>
<p>This has to stop.</p>
<p>We cannot treat fellow citizens in this way, and we can&rsquo;t do it with impunity.</p>
<p>And the young people said, we&rsquo;re not going to stand for it anymore, and they took to</p>
<p>the streets.</p>
<p>But with millions of people protesting, there is nevertheless taking us back to the most</p>
<p>difficult of trials.</p>
<p>You have the trial, like you mentioned, that&rsquo;s going on now, of Derek Chauvin, of one of</p>
<p>the police officers involved.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>What are your predictions on this trial where the law, the process of the law is trying</p>
<p>to proceed in the face of so much racial tension?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s going to be an interesting trial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on it there in jury selection now, today, as we&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>So a lot&rsquo;s going to depend on what sort of jury gets selected.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry to interrupt, but so one of the interesting qualities of this trial, maybe</p>
<p>you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but the cameras are allowed in the courtroom, at least during</p>
<p>the jury selection.</p>
<p>So you get to watch some of this stuff.</p>
<p>And the other part is the jury selection, again, I&rsquo;m very inexperienced, but it seems</p>
<p>like selecting an, what is it, unbiased jury is really difficult for this trial.</p>
<p>It almost like, I don&rsquo;t know, me as a listener, listening to people that are trying to talk</p>
<p>their way into the jury kind of thing, trying to decide, is this person really unbiased?</p>
<p>Are they just trying to hold on to their like deeply held emotions and trying to get onto</p>
<p>the jury?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an incredibly difficult process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment on a case so difficult, like the ones you&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>before, how do you select a jury that represents the people and doesn&rsquo;t, and carries the sort</p>
<p>of the ideal of the law?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So a couple things.</p>
<p>Yes, it is televised and it will be televised, as they say, gavel to gavel.</p>
<p>So the entire trial, the whole thing is going to be televised.</p>
<p>So people are getting a view of how laborious jury selection can be.</p>
<p>I think as of yesterday, they had picked six jurors and it&rsquo;s taken a week and they have</p>
<p>to get to 14.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got, you know, probably another week or more to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in jury trials where it took a month to choose a jury.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the most important part, you have to choose the right sort of jury.</p>
<p>So unbiased in the criminal justice system has a particular meaning.</p>
<p>It means that, let me tell you what it doesn&rsquo;t mean.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that a person is not aware of the case.</p>
<p>It also does not mean that a person hasn&rsquo;t formed an opinion about the case.</p>
<p>Those are two popular misconceptions.</p>
<p>What it does mean is that notwithstanding whether an individual has formed an opinion,</p>
<p>notwithstanding whether an individual knows about the case, that individual can set aside</p>
<p>any prior opinions, can set aside any notions that they&rsquo;ve developed about the case and</p>
<p>listen to the evidence presented at trial in conjunction with the judge&rsquo;s instructions</p>
<p>on how to understand and view that evidence.</p>
<p>So if a person can do that, then they&rsquo;re considered unbiased.</p>
<p>So as a longtime defense attorney, I would be hesitant in a big case like this to pick</p>
<p>a juror who&rsquo;s never heard of the case or anything going around because I&rsquo;m thinking, well, who</p>
<p>is this person and what in the world do they do?</p>
<p>Or are they lying to me?</p>
<p>I mean, how can you not have heard about this case?</p>
<p>So they may bring other problems.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t mind so much people who&rsquo;ve heard about the case or folks who&rsquo;ve formed initial</p>
<p>opinions, but what you don&rsquo;t want is people who have tethered themselves to that opinion</p>
<p>in a way that they can&rsquo;t be convinced otherwise.</p>
<p>But you also have people who, as you suggested, who just lie because they want to get on the</p>
<p>jury or lie because they want to get off the jury.</p>
<p>So sometimes people come and say the most ridiculous, outrageous, offensive things because</p>
<p>they know that they&rsquo;ll get excused for cause.</p>
<p>And others who, you can tell, really badly want to get on the jury.</p>
<p>So they pretend to be the most neutral, unbiased person in the world, what the law calls the</p>
<p>reasonable person.</p>
<p>We have in law the reasonable person standard, and I would tell my class the reasonable person</p>
<p>in real life is the person that you would be least likely to want to have a drink with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the most boring, neutral, not interesting sort of person in the world.</p>
<p>And so a lot of jurors engage in the performative act of presenting themselves as the most sort</p>
<p>of even killed, rational, reasonable person because they really want to get on the jury.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an interesting question, I apologize, I haven&rsquo;t watched a lot because it is very</p>
<p>long.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s certain questions you ask in the jury selection.</p>
<p>I remember I think one jumped out at me, which is something like, does the fact that this</p>
<p>person is a police officer make you feel any kind of way about them?</p>
<p>So trying to get at that, you know, I don&rsquo;t know what that is, I guess that&rsquo;s bias.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a difficult question to ask, like I asked myself with that question, like</p>
<p>how much, you know, we all kind of want to pretend that we&rsquo;re not racist, we don&rsquo;t judge,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have, we&rsquo;re like these, we&rsquo;re the reasonable human, but, you know, legitimately</p>
<p>asking yourself like, what are the prejudgments you have in your mind?</p>
<p>Is that even impossible for a human being?</p>
<p>Like when you look at yourself in the mirror and think about it, is it possible to actually</p>
<p>answer that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I do not believe that people can be completely unbiased.</p>
<p>We all have baggage and bias and bring it wherever we go, including to court.</p>
<p>What you want is to try to find a person who can at least recognize when a bias is working</p>
<p>and actively try to do the right thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best we can ask.</p>
<p>So if a juror says, yeah, you know, I grew up in a place where I tend to believe what</p>
<p>police officers say, that&rsquo;s just how I grew up.</p>
<p>But if the judge is telling me that I have to listen to every witness equally, then I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do my best and I won&rsquo;t weigh that testimony any higher than I would any other testimony.</p>
<p>If you have someone answer a question like that, that sounds more sincere to me, sounds</p>
<p>more honest.</p>
<p>And if you want a person, you want a person to try to do that.</p>
<p>And then in closing arguments, as the lawyer, I&rsquo;d say something like, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>we chose you to be on this jury because you swore that you would do your level best to</p>
<p>be fair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we chose you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m confident that you&rsquo;re going to do that here.</p>
<p>So when you heard that police officer&rsquo;s testimony, the judge told you, you can&rsquo;t give more credit</p>
<p>to that testimony just because it&rsquo;s a police officer.</p>
<p>And I trust that you&rsquo;re going to do that and that you&rsquo;re going to look at witness number</p>
<p>three, you know, John Smith, you&rsquo;re going to look at John Smith.</p>
<p>John Smith has a different recollection and you&rsquo;re duty bound, duty bound to look at that</p>
<p>testimony and this person&rsquo;s credibility, you know, the same degree as that other witness,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And now what you have is just a, he said, she said matter, and this is a criminal case</p>
<p>that has to be reasonable doubt, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, and really someone who&rsquo;s trying to do the right thing, it&rsquo;s helpful, but no,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to just find 14 people with no biases.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absurd.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s fascinating that, especially the way you&rsquo;re inspiring the way you&rsquo;re speaking</p>
<p>now is, I mean, I guess you&rsquo;re calling on the jury.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the whole system is you&rsquo;re calling on the jury, each individual on the</p>
<p>jury to step up and really think, you know, to, to step up and be their most thoughtful</p>
<p>selves, actually, most introspective, like you&rsquo;re trying to basically ask people to be</p>
<p>their best selves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and they, I guess a lot of people step up to that.</p>
<p>A lot of people do, I&rsquo;m very, I&rsquo;m very pro jury, juries, they, they get it right a lot</p>
<p>of the time, most of the time, and they really work hard to do it.</p>
<p>So what do you think happens?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe, I&rsquo;m not so much on the legal side of things, but on the social side, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like with the O.J. Simpson trial, do you think it&rsquo;s possible that Derek Chauvin does not</p>
<p>get convicted of the, what is it, second degree murder?</p>
<p>How do you think about that?</p>
<p>How do you think about the potential social impact of that, the, the riots, the protests,</p>
<p>the, either, either direction, any words that are said, the tension here could be explosive,</p>
<p>especially with the cameras.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, so yes, there&rsquo;s certainly a possibility that he, he&rsquo;ll be acquitted.</p>
<p>For homicide charges, for the jury to convict, they have to make a determination as to Officer</p>
<p>Chauvin&rsquo;s, former Officer Chauvin&rsquo;s state of mind, whether he intended to cause some</p>
<p>harm, whether he was grossly reckless in causing harm, so much so that he disregarded a known</p>
<p>risk of death or serious bodily injury.</p>
<p>And as you may have read in the papers, yesterday the judge allowed a third degree murder charge</p>
<p>in Kentucky, which is, it&rsquo;s the mindset, the state of mind there is not an intention,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s depraved indifference.</p>
<p>And what that means is that the jury doesn&rsquo;t have to find that he intended to do anything.</p>
<p>Rather, they could find that he was just indifferent to a risk.</p>
<p>As dark.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s worse.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a good point, but, but it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s another basis for the jury</p>
<p>to convict.</p>
<p>But look, you never know what happens when you go to a jury trial.</p>
<p>So there could be an acquittal, and if there is, I imagine there would be massive protests.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s convicted, I don&rsquo;t think that would happen, because I just don&rsquo;t see, at least</p>
<p>nothing I&rsquo;ve seen or read suggests that there&rsquo;s a big pro Chauvin camp out there ready to</p>
<p>protest.</p>
<p>Well, there could be a, is there also potential tensions that could arise from the sentencing?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that exactly works, sort of not enough years kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be.</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, a lot could happen.</p>
<p>So it depends on what he&rsquo;s convicted of, you know, one count I think is like up to</p>
<p>10 years, another counts up to 40 years.</p>
<p>So it depends what he&rsquo;s convicted of, and yes, it depends on how much of the, how much</p>
<p>time the judge gives him if he is convicted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of space for people to be very angry, and so we will see what happens.</p>
<p>I just feel like with a judge and the lawyers, there&rsquo;s an opportunity to have really important</p>
<p>long lasting speeches.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they think of it that way, especially with the cameras.</p>
<p>It feels like they have the capacity to heal or to divide.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about that as a lawyer, as a legal mind, that your words aren&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>about the case, but about the, they&rsquo;ll reverberate through history potentially?</p>
<p>That is, that is certainly a possible consequence of things you say.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that most lawyers think about that in the context of the case.</p>
<p>Your role is much more narrow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the partisan advocate, as a defense lawyer, partisan advocate for that client.</p>
<p>As a prosecutor, you&rsquo;re a minister of justice attempting to prosecute that particular case.</p>
<p>But the reality is you are absolutely correct that sometimes the things you say will have</p>
<p>a shelf life.</p>
<p>You mentioned O.J. Simpson before, if the glove doesn&rsquo;t fit, you must acquit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be just in our lexicon for probably a long time now.</p>
<p>So it happens, but that&rsquo;s not, and shouldn&rsquo;t be foremost on your mind.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What do you make of the O.J. Simpson trial?</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts about it?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s out and about on social media now, he&rsquo;s a public figure.</p>
<p>Is there lessons to be drawn from that whole saga?</p>
<p>Well, you know, that was an interesting case.</p>
<p>I was a young public defender, I want to say, in my first year as a public defender when</p>
<p>that verdict came out.</p>
<p>So that case was important in so many ways.</p>
<p>One, it was the first DNA case, major DNA case, and there were significant lessons learned</p>
<p>from that.</p>
<p>The second mistake that the prosecution made was that they didn&rsquo;t present the science</p>
<p>in a way that a lay jury could understand it.</p>
<p>And what Johnny Cochran did was he understood the science and was able to translate that</p>
<p>into a vocabulary that he bet that that jury understood.</p>
<p>So Cochran was dismissive of a lot of DNA.</p>
<p>They say they found such and such amount of DNA, that&rsquo;s just like me wiping my finger</p>
<p>against my nose and just that little bit of DNA.</p>
<p>And that was effective because the prosecution hadn&rsquo;t done a good job of establishing that</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s microscopic, you don&rsquo;t need that much, yes, wiping your hand on your nose and</p>
<p>touching something, you can transfer a lot of DNA and that gives you good information.</p>
<p>But you know, it was the first time that the public generally, and that jury maybe since</p>
<p>high school science had heard, you know, nucleotide, I mean, it was just all these terms getting</p>
<p>thrown at them, but it was not weaved into a narrative.</p>
<p>So Cochran taught us that no matter what type of case it is, no matter what science is involved,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still about storytelling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still about a narrative and he was great at that narrative and was consistent with</p>
<p>his narrative all the way out.</p>
<p>Another lesson that was relearned is that, you know, you never ask a question to which</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like trial advocacy 101.</p>
<p>And so when they gave O.J. Simpson the glove and it wouldn&rsquo;t fit, you know, you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>things where you just don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to turn out.</p>
<p>It was way, way too risky and I think that&rsquo;s what acquitted him because the glove just</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t fit and he got to do this and ham in front of the camera and all of that and</p>
<p>it was big.</p>
<p>Do you think about, do you think about representation as a storytelling, like you, yourself and</p>
<p>your role?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We tell stories.</p>
<p>It is fundamental.</p>
<p>We, since time immemorial, we have told stories to help us make sense of the world around</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>As a scientist, you tell a different type of story, but we as a public have told stories</p>
<p>from time immemorial to help us make sense of the physical and the natural world and</p>
<p>we are still a species that is moved by storytelling.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s first and last in trial work.</p>
<p>You have to tell a good story.</p>
<p>And you know, the basic introductory books about trial work teach young students, young</p>
<p>students and young lawyers to start an opening with this case is about, this case is about</p>
<p>and then you fill in the blank and you know, that&rsquo;s your narrative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the narrative you&rsquo;re going to, you&rsquo;re going to tell.</p>
<p>And of course you can do the ultra dramatic, the glove doesn&rsquo;t fit kind of the climax and</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the best of narratives.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The best of stories.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Speaking of other really powerful stories that you were involved with is the Aaron Hernandez</p>
<p>trial and the whole story, the whole legal case.</p>
<p>Can you maybe overview the big picture story and legal case of Aaron Hernandez?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Aaron, whom I miss a lot, so he was charged with a double murder in the case that I tried.</p>
<p>And this was a unique case and one of those impossible cases in part because Aaron had</p>
<p>already been convicted of a murder.</p>
<p>And so we had a client who was on trial for a double murder after having already been</p>
<p>convicted of a separate murder.</p>
<p>And we had a jury pool just about all of whom knew that he had been convicted of a murder</p>
<p>because he was a very popular football player in Boston, which is a big football town with</p>
<p>the Patriots.</p>
<p>So everyone knew that he was a convicted murderer and here we are defending for in a double</p>
<p>murder case.</p>
<p>So that was the context.</p>
<p>It was an odd case in the sense that this murder had gone unsolved for a couple of years</p>
<p>and then a nightclub bouncer said something to a cop who was working at a club that Aaron</p>
<p>Hernandez was somehow involved in that murder that happened in the theater district.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the district where all the clubs are in Boston and where the homicide occurred.</p>
<p>And once the police heard Aaron Hernandez&rsquo;s name, then they went all out in order to do</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>They found a guy named Alexander Bradley, who was a very significant drug dealer in</p>
<p>the sort of Connecticut area, very significant, very powerful.</p>
<p>And he essentially, in exchange for a deal, pointed to Aaron and said, yeah, I was with</p>
<p>Aaron and Aaron was the murderer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how the case came to court.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that sets the context.</p>
<p>What was your involvement in this case, like legally, intellectually, psychologically,</p>
<p>when this particular second charge of murder?</p>
<p>So a friend called me, Jose Baez, who is a defense attorney, and he comes to a class</p>
<p>that I teach every year at Harvard, the trial advocacy workshop, as one of my teaching faculty</p>
<p>members.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a class where we teach students how to try cases.</p>
<p>So Jose called me and said, hey, I got a call from Massachusetts, Aaron Hernandez.</p>
<p>You want to go and talk to him with me?</p>
<p>So I said, sure.</p>
<p>So we went up to the prison and met Aaron and spoke with him for two or three hours</p>
<p>that first time.</p>
<p>And before we left, he said he wanted to retain us.</p>
<p>He wanted to work with us.</p>
<p>And that started the representation.</p>
<p>What was he like in that time?</p>
<p>What was he worn down by the whole process?</p>
<p>Was there still a light in that?</p>
<p>He was not.</p>
<p>He had, I mean, more than just a light, he was luminous almost.</p>
<p>He had a radiant million dollar smile whenever you walked in.</p>
<p>My first impression I distinctly remember was, wow, this is what a professional athlete</p>
<p>looks like.</p>
<p>I mean, he walked in and he&rsquo;s just bigger and more fit than anyone anywhere.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, wow.</p>
<p>And when you saw him on television, he looked kind of little.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, well, what do those other guys look like in person?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s extraordinarily polite, young, I was surprised by how young he was.</p>
<p>Both in mind and body.</p>
<p>Chronologically, I was thinking he was in his early 20s, I believe.</p>
<p>But there seemed to be like an innocence to him in terms of just the way he saw the world.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They picked that up from the documentary, just taking that in.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So there is a Netflix documentary titled Killer Inside the Mind of Aaron Hernandez.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this documentary?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to see it.</p>
<p>I have not seen it.</p>
<p>I did not participate in it.</p>
<p>I know I was in it because there was news footage, but I did not participate in it.</p>
<p>I had not talked to Aaron about press or anything before he died.</p>
<p>My strong view is that the attorney client privilege survives death.</p>
<p>And so I was not inclined to talk about anything that Aaron and I talked about.</p>
<p>So I just didn&rsquo;t participate and have never watched it.</p>
<p>Not even watch, huh?</p>
<p>Does that apply to most of your work, do you try to stay away from the way the press perceives</p>
<p>stuff?</p>
<p>Well, during, yes, I try to stay away from it.</p>
<p>I will view it afterwards.</p>
<p>I just hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to watching Aaron, because it&rsquo;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>So I just haven&rsquo;t watched it.</p>
<p>But I definitely stay away from the press during trial.</p>
<p>And there are some lawyers who watch it religiously to see what&rsquo;s going on, but I&rsquo;m confident</p>
<p>in my years of training and so forth that I can actively sense what&rsquo;s going on in the</p>
<p>courtroom and that I really don&rsquo;t need advice from Joe476 at Gmail, some random guy on the</p>
<p>internet telling me how to try cases.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s just confusing and I just keep it out of my mind.</p>
<p>And even if you think you can ignore it, just reading it will have a little bit of an effect</p>
<p>on your mind.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Over time it might accumulate.</p>
<p>So the documentary, but in general, it mentioned or kind of emphasized and talked about Aaron&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sexuality or sort of they were discussing basically the idea that he was a homosexual.</p>
<p>And some of the trauma, some of the suffering that he endured in his life had to do with</p>
<p>sort of fear given the society of what his father would think of what others around him</p>
<p>sort of, especially in sport culture and football and so on.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know in your interaction with him was, do you think that maybe even leaning</p>
<p>up to a suicide, do you think his struggle with coming to terms with the sexuality had</p>
<p>a role to play in much of his difficulties?</p>
<p>Well I&rsquo;m not going to talk about my interactions with them and anything I derived from that.</p>
<p>But what I will say is that a story broke on the radio at some point during the trial</p>
<p>that Aaron had been in the same sex relationship with someone and some local sportscasters,</p>
<p>local Boston sportscasters really mushroomed the story.</p>
<p>So he and everyone was aware of it.</p>
<p>You also may know from the court record that the prosecutors floated a specious theory</p>
<p>for a minute but then backed off of it that Aaron was, that there was some sort of I guess</p>
<p>gay rage at work with him and that might be a cause, a motive for the killing.</p>
<p>And luckily they really backed off of that.</p>
<p>That was quite an offensive claim in theory.</p>
<p>So but to answer your question more directly, I mean I have no idea why he killed himself.</p>
<p>It was a surprise and a shock.</p>
<p>I was scheduled to go see him like a couple days after it happened.</p>
<p>I mean he was anxious for Jose and I to come in and do the appeal from the murder which</p>
<p>he was convicted for.</p>
<p>He wanted us to take over that appeal.</p>
<p>He was talking about going back to football.</p>
<p>I mean he said, well you talk about this, earlier you talked about the sort of innocent</p>
<p>aspect of him.</p>
<p>He said, you know, well Ron, maybe not the Patriots but you know, I want to get back</p>
<p>in the league and I was like, you know, Aaron, that&rsquo;s going to be tough, man.</p>
<p>But he really believed it and then for a few days later that to happen, it was a real shock</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>Like when you look back at that, at his story, does it make you sad?</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>I thought, so one, I believe he absolutely did not commit the crimes that we acquitted</p>
<p>him on.</p>
<p>I think that was the right answer for that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about Bradley, the first case, I&rsquo;m sorry, to make an opinion on.</p>
<p>But in our case, it was just, he had the misfortune of having a famous name and the police department</p>
<p>just really got on him there.</p>
<p>So yes, I miss him a lot, it was very, very sad and surprising.</p>
<p>And I mean just on the human side, of course we don&rsquo;t know the full story, but just everything</p>
<p>that led up to suicide, everything led up to an incredible professional football player,</p>
<p>you know, that whole story.</p>
<p>He was a remarkably talented athlete, remarkably talented athlete.</p>
<p>And it has to do with all the possible trajectories, right, that we can take through life, as we</p>
<p>were talking about before.</p>
<p>And some of them lead to suicide, sadly enough.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always tragic when you have somebody with great potential result in the things</p>
<p>that happen.</p>
<p>People love it when I ask about books.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether technical, like legal or fiction, nonfiction books throughout your</p>
<p>life have had an impact on you, if there&rsquo;s something you could recommend or something</p>
<p>you could speak to about something that inspired ideas, insights about this complicated world</p>
<p>of ours.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ll give you a couple.</p>
<p>So one is Contingency, Irony and Solidarity by Richard Warty.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s passed away now, but was a philosopher at some of our major institutions, Princeton,</p>
<p>Stanford.</p>
<p>Contingency, Irony and Solidarity, at least that&rsquo;s a book that really helped me work through</p>
<p>a series of thoughts.</p>
<p>So it stands for the proposition that our most deeply held beliefs are contingent, that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing beyond history or prior to socialization that&rsquo;s definatory of the human</p>
<p>being, that&rsquo;s Warty.</p>
<p>And he says that our most deeply held beliefs are received wisdom and highly contingent</p>
<p>along a number of registers.</p>
<p>And he does that, but then goes on to say that he nonetheless can hold strongly held</p>
<p>beliefs, recognizing their contingency, but still believes them to be true and accurate.</p>
<p>He helps you to work through what could be an intellectual tension, other words, so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t delve into, one doesn&rsquo;t delve into relativism, everything is okay, but he gives</p>
<p>you a vocabulary to think about how to negotiate these realities.</p>
<p>Do you share this tension?</p>
<p>I mean, there is a real tension.</p>
<p>It seems like even the law, the legal system is all just a construct of our human ideas,</p>
<p>and yet it seems to be, almost feels fundamental to what a just society is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely share the tension and love his vocabulary and the way he&rsquo;s helped me</p>
<p>resolve the tension.</p>
<p>So right, I mean, yeah, so like, you know, infanticide, for example.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s socially contingent, perhaps it&rsquo;s received wisdom, perhaps it&rsquo;s anthropological,</p>
<p>you know, we need to propagate the species, and I still think it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And Warty has helped me develop a category to say that, no, I can&rsquo;t provide any, in</p>
<p>Warty&rsquo;s words, noncircular theoretical backup for this proposition.</p>
<p>At some point, it&rsquo;s going to run me into a circularity problem, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I hold this nonetheless in full recognition of its contingency, but what it does is makes</p>
<p>you humble, and when you&rsquo;re humble, that&rsquo;s good because, you know, this notion that ideas</p>
<p>are always already in progress, never fully formed, I think is the sort of intellectual</p>
<p>I strive to be.</p>
<p>And if I have a sufficient degree of humility that I don&rsquo;t have the final answer, capital</p>
<p>A, then that&rsquo;s going to help me to get to better answers, lowercase a.</p>
<p>And Warty does that, and he talks about in the solidarity part of the book, he has this</p>
<p>concept of imaginative, the imaginative ability to see other different people as we instead</p>
<p>of they.</p>
<p>And I just think it&rsquo;s a beautiful concept, but he talks about this imaginative ability</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s this active process.</p>
<p>So I mean, so that&rsquo;s a book that&rsquo;s done a lot of work for me over the years.</p>
<p>Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois was absolutely pivotal in my intellectual development.</p>
<p>One of the premier set of essays in the Western literary tradition, and it&rsquo;s a deep and profound</p>
<p>sociological, philosophical, and historical analysis of the predicament of blacks in America</p>
<p>from one of our country&rsquo;s greatest polymaths.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful text and I go to it yearly.</p>
<p>So for somebody like me, so growing up in the Soviet Union, the struggle, the civil</p>
<p>rights movement, the struggle of race, and all those kinds of things that is, you know,</p>
<p>this universal, but it&rsquo;s also very much a journey of the United States.</p>
<p>It was kind of a foreign thing that I stepped into.</p>
<p>Is that something you would recommend somebody like me to read, or is there other things</p>
<p>about race that are good to connect to?</p>
<p>My flavor of suffering injustice, I&rsquo;m a Jew as well, my flavor has to do with World War</p>
<p>II and the studies of that, you know, all the injustices there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now stepping into a new set of injustices and trying to learn the landscape.</p>
<p>I would say anyone is a better person for having read Du Bois.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a remarkable writer and thinker, and to the extent you&rsquo;re interested in learning</p>
<p>another history, he does it in a way that is quite sophisticated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting, I was going to give you three books.</p>
<p>I noted the accent when I met you, but I didn&rsquo;t know exactly where you&rsquo;re from.</p>
<p>But the other book I was going to say is Dostoevsky&rsquo;s Crime and Punishment, and I mean, I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>wanted to go to St. Pete&rsquo;s just to sort of see with my own eyes what the word pictures</p>
<p>that Dostoevsky created in Crime and Punishment.</p>
<p>And you know, I love others of his stuff too, The Brothers Care, Masov, and so forth.</p>
<p>But Crime and Punishment I first read in high school as a junior or senior, and it is a</p>
<p>deep and profound meditation on both the meaning and the measure of our lives.</p>
<p>And Dostoevsky, obviously in conversation with other thinkers, really gets at the crux</p>
<p>of a fundamental philosophical problem, what does it mean to be a human being?</p>
<p>And for that, Crime and Punishment captured me as a teenager, and that&rsquo;s another text</p>
<p>that I return to often.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about young people a little bit at the beginning of our conversation.</p>
<p>Is there advice that you could give to a young person today thinking about their career,</p>
<p>thinking about their life, thinking about making their way in this world?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share some advice.</p>
<p>It actually picks up on a question we talked about earlier in the academy and schools.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s some advice that a professor gave to me when I got to Harvard.</p>
<p>And it is this, that you have to be willing to come face to face with your intellectual</p>
<p>limitations and keep going.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard for people, I mean, you mentioned this earlier, to face really difficult tasks,</p>
<p>and particularly in these sort of elite spaces where you&rsquo;ve excelled all your life, and</p>
<p>you come to MIT and you&rsquo;re like, wait a minute, I don&rsquo;t understand this.</p>
<p>Wait, this is hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had something really hard before.</p>
<p>And there are a couple options, and a lot of people will pull back and take the gentleman</p>
<p>or gentlewoman&rsquo;s bee and just go on, or risk going out there, giving it your all, and still</p>
<p>not quite getting it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a risk, but it&rsquo;s a risk well worth it, because you&rsquo;re just going to be the better</p>
<p>person, the better student for it.</p>
<p>And even outside of the academy, I mean, come face to face with your fears and keep going</p>
<p>and keep going in life, and you&rsquo;re going to be the better person, the better human being.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does seem to be, I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but it does seem to be that fear is</p>
<p>a good indicator of something you should probably face.</p>
<p>Fear kind of shows the way a little bit.</p>
<p>Not always.</p>
<p>You might not want to go into the cage with a lion, but maybe you should.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Let me ask sort of a darker question, because we&rsquo;re talking about Dostoyevsky, we might</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>Do you, and connected to the freeing innocent people, do you think about mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about your own death?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of death.</p>
<p>I do think about it more now, because I&rsquo;m now in my mid fifties, so I used to not think</p>
<p>about it much at all, but the harsh reality is that I&rsquo;ve got more time behind me now</p>
<p>than I do in front of me, and it kind of happens all of a sudden, too.</p>
<p>You realize, wait a minute, I&rsquo;m actually on the back nine now, so yeah, my mind moves</p>
<p>to it from time to time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t dwell on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of it.</p>
<p>My own personal religious commitments, I&rsquo;m Christian, and my religious commitments buoy</p>
<p>me that death, and I believe this, death is not the end, so I&rsquo;m not afraid of it.</p>
<p>Now, this is not to say that I want to rush to the afterlife.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good right here for a long time, and I hope I&rsquo;ve got 30, 35, 40 more years to</p>
<p>go, but no, I don&rsquo;t fear death.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re finite creatures.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all gonna die.</p>
<p>Well, the mystery of it, you know, for somebody, at least for me, we human beings want to figure</p>
<p>everything out.</p>
<p>Whatever the afterlife is, there&rsquo;s still a mystery to it.</p>
<p>That uncertainty can be terrifying if you ponder it, but maybe what you&rsquo;re saying is</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t pondered it too deeply so far, and it&rsquo;s worked out pretty good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worked out, yeah, no complaints.</p>
<p>So you said, again, the Sejewski kind of was exceptionally good at getting to the core</p>
<p>of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Do you think about, like, the why of why we&rsquo;re here, the meaning of this whole existence?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I do, I think, and I actually think that&rsquo;s the purpose of an education.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a human being?</p>
<p>And in one way or another, we set out to answer those questions, and we do it in a different</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>I mean, some may look to philosophy to answer these questions.</p>
<p>Why is it in one&rsquo;s personal interest to do good, to do justice?</p>
<p>Some may look at it through the economist lens.</p>
<p>Some may look at it through the microscope in the laboratory that the phenomenal world</p>
<p>is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Others may say that that&rsquo;s one vocabulary, that&rsquo;s one description, but the poet describes</p>
<p>a reality to the same degree as a physicist, but that&rsquo;s the purpose of an education.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to sort of work through these issues.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a human being?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a fascinating journey, and I think it&rsquo;s a lifelong endeavor to figure</p>
<p>out what is the thing, that nugget, that makes us human.</p>
<p>Do you still see yourself as a student?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the best part about going into university teaching.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a lifelong student.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always learning.</p>
<p>I learn from my students and with my students and my colleagues.</p>
<p>You continue to read and learn and modify opinions, and I think it&rsquo;s just a wonderful</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>Well, Ron, I&rsquo;m so glad that somebody like you is carrying the fire of what is the best</p>
<p>of Harvard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would spend so much time, waste so much of your valuable</p>
<p>time with me.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that conversation.</p>
<p>Not a waste at all.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people love it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ronald Sullivan, and thank you to Brooklyn</p>
<p>and Sheetz, Wine Access Online Wine Store, Monk Pack Low Carb Snacks, and Blinkist app</p>
<p>that summarizes books.</p>
<p>Click their links to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Nelson Mandela, when a man is denied the right</p>
<p>to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
