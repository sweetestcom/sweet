    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Eric Jarvis.</p>
<p>Dr. Jarvis is a professor</p>
<p>at the Rockefeller University in New York City,</p>
<p>and his laboratory studies the neurobiology</p>
<p>of vocal learning, language, speech disorders,</p>
<p>and remarkably, the relationship between language,</p>
<p>music, and movement, in particular, dance.</p>
<p>His work spans from genomics,</p>
<p>so the very genes that make up our genome,</p>
<p>and the genomes of other species</p>
<p>that speak and have language,</p>
<p>such as songbirds and parrots,</p>
<p>all the way up to neural circuits,</p>
<p>that is the connections in the brain and body</p>
<p>that govern our ability to learn</p>
<p>and generate specific sounds</p>
<p>and movements coordinated with those sounds,</p>
<p>including hand movements,</p>
<p>and all the way up to cognition,</p>
<p>that is our ability to think in specific ways</p>
<p>based on what we are saying</p>
<p>and the way that we comprehend</p>
<p>what other people are saying, singing, and doing.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll soon see, I was immediately transfixed</p>
<p>and absolutely enchanted</p>
<p>by Dr. Jarvis&rsquo;s description of his work</p>
<p>and the ways that it impacts</p>
<p>all the various aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>For instance, I learned from Dr. Jarvis</p>
<p>that as we read,</p>
<p>we are generating very low levels</p>
<p>of motor activity in our throat,</p>
<p>that is, we are speaking the words that we are reading</p>
<p>at a level below the perception of sound</p>
<p>or our own perception of those words.</p>
<p>But if one were to put an amplifier</p>
<p>to measure the firing of those muscles in our vocal cords,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d find that as we&rsquo;re reading information,</p>
<p>we are actually speaking that information.</p>
<p>And as I learned, and you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a direct link</p>
<p>between those species in the world</p>
<p>that have song and movement,</p>
<p>which many of us would associate with dance,</p>
<p>and our ability to learn and generate complex language.</p>
<p>So for people with speech disorders like stutter,</p>
<p>or for people who are interested</p>
<p>in multiple language learning,</p>
<p>bilingual, trilingual, et cetera,</p>
<p>and frankly, for anyone who is interested</p>
<p>in how we communicate through words written or spoken,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain today&rsquo;s episode is going to be</p>
<p>an especially interesting and important one for you.</p>
<p>Dr. Jarvis&rsquo;s work is so pioneering</p>
<p>that he has been awarded truly countless awards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to take our time to list off</p>
<p>all the various important awards that he&rsquo;s received,</p>
<p>but I should point out that in addition</p>
<p>to being a decorated professor</p>
<p>at the Rockefeller University,</p>
<p>he is also an investigator</p>
<p>with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,</p>
<p>the so-called HHMI.</p>
<p>And for those of you that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>HHMI investigators are selected</p>
<p>on an extremely competitive basis</p>
<p>that they have to re-up,</p>
<p>that is they have to re-compete every five years.</p>
<p>They actually receive a grade every five years</p>
<p>that dictates whether or not</p>
<p>they are no longer a Howard Hughes investigator,</p>
<p>or whether or not they can advance</p>
<p>to another five years of funding</p>
<p>for their important research.</p>
<p>And indeed, Howard Hughes investigators are selected</p>
<p>not just for the rigor of their work,</p>
<p>but for their pioneering spirit</p>
<p>and their ability to take on high-risk, high-benefit work,</p>
<p>which is exactly the kind of work</p>
<p>that Dr. Jarvis has been providing for decades now.</p>
<p>Again, I think today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>is one of the more unique and special episodes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>I single it out because it really spans</p>
<p>from the basic to the applied,</p>
<p>and Dr. Jarvis&rsquo;s story is an especially unique one</p>
<p>in terms of how he arrived at becoming a neurobiologist.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in personal journey and personal story,</p>
<p>Dr. Jarvis&rsquo;s is truly a special and important one.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero-cost and consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages that allow you</p>
<p>to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Eric Jarvis.</p>
<p>Eric, so great to have you here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in learning from you</p>
<p>about speech and language.</p>
<p>And even as I asked the question,</p>
<p>I realized that a lot of people, including myself,</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t fully appreciate the distinction</p>
<p>between speech and language.</p>
<p>Speech, I think of as the motor patterns,</p>
<p>the production of sound that has meaning, hopefully.</p>
<p>And language, of course, come in various languages</p>
<p>and varieties of ways of communicating.</p>
<p>But in terms of the study of speech and language</p>
<p>and thinking about how the brain</p>
<p>organizes speech and language,</p>
<p>what are the similarities?</p>
<p>What are the differences?</p>
<p>How should we think about speech and language?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;m glad you invited me here,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m also glad to get that first question,</p>
<p>which I consider a provocative one.</p>
<p>The reason why, I&rsquo;ve been struggling</p>
<p>what is the difference with speech and language</p>
<p>for many years, and realize why am I struggling</p>
<p>is because there are behavioral terms,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call them psychologically,</p>
<p>psychology developed kind of terms,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t actually align exactly with brain function.</p>
<p>And the question is, is there a distinction</p>
<p>between speech and language?</p>
<p>And when I look at the brain of work</p>
<p>that other people have done, work we have done,</p>
<p>also compared it with animal models,</p>
<p>like those who can imitate sounds,</p>
<p>like parrots and songbirds,</p>
<p>I start to see there really isn&rsquo;t such a sharp distinction.</p>
<p>So to get at what I think is going on,</p>
<p>let me tell you how some people think of it now,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a separate language module in the brain</p>
<p>that has all the algorithms and computations</p>
<p>that influence the speech pathway on how to produce sound,</p>
<p>and the auditory pathway on how to perceive</p>
<p>and interpret it for speech,</p>
<p>or for sound that we call speech.</p>
<p>And it turns out, I don&rsquo;t think there is any good evidence</p>
<p>for a separate language module.</p>
<p>Instead, there is a speech production pathway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s controlling our larynx,</p>
<p>controlling our jaw muscles,</p>
<p>that has built within it all the complex algorithms</p>
<p>for spoken language,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the auditory pathway</p>
<p>that has built within it all the complex algorithms</p>
<p>for understanding speech,</p>
<p>not separate from a language module.</p>
<p>And this speech production pathway</p>
<p>is specialized to humans and parrots and songbirds,</p>
<p>whereas this auditory perception pathway</p>
<p>is more ubiquitous amongst the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>And this is why dogs can understand sit,</p>
<p>si√©ntese, come here, boy, get the ball, and so forth.</p>
<p>Dogs can understand several hundred human speech words.</p>
<p>Great apes, you can teach them for several thousand,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve raised a number of animal species early</p>
<p>on here, and because I have a,</p>
<p>basically an obsession with animals</p>
<p>since the time I was very small,</p>
<p>I have to ask, which animals have language?</p>
<p>Which animals have modes of communication</p>
<p>that are sort of like language?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve heard whale songs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>They sound very beautiful,</p>
<p>but they could be insulting each other for all I know.</p>
<p>And then, well, very well, maybe dolphins, birds.</p>
<p>I mean, what do we understand about modes of communication</p>
<p>that are like language,</p>
<p>but might not be what would classically be called language?</p>
<p>Right, so modes of communication</p>
<p>that people would define as language,</p>
<p>more in a very narrow definition,</p>
<p>they would say production of sound, so speech.</p>
<p>But what about the hands, the gesturing with the hands?</p>
<p>What about a bird who is doing aerial displays in the air,</p>
<p>communicating information through body language, right?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m gonna go back to the brain.</p>
<p>So what I think is going on is for spoken language,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using the speech pathway</p>
<p>in all the complex algorithms there.</p>
<p>Next to the brain regions</p>
<p>that are controlling spoken language</p>
<p>are the brain regions for gesturing with the hands.</p>
<p>And that hand parallel pathway</p>
<p>has also complex algorithms that we can utilize.</p>
<p>And some species are more advanced in these circuits,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s sound or gesturing with hands,</p>
<p>and some are less advanced.</p>
<p>Now, we humans and a few others are the most advanced</p>
<p>for the speech sounds or the spoken language,</p>
<p>but a non-human primate can produce gesturing</p>
<p>in a more advanced form than they can produce sound.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I got that across clearly,</p>
<p>just to say that humans are the most advanced</p>
<p>at spoken language,</p>
<p>but not necessarily as big a difference</p>
<p>at gestural language compared to some other species.</p>
<p>Very clear and very interesting,</p>
<p>and immediately prompts the question,</p>
<p>have there been brain imaging or other sorts of studies</p>
<p>evaluating neural activity</p>
<p>in the context of cultures and languages,</p>
<p>at least that I associate with a lot of hand movement,</p>
<p>like Italian versus, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe you could give us some examples of cultures</p>
<p>where language is not associated</p>
<p>with as much overt hand movement.</p>
<p>Yes, so as you and I are talking here today</p>
<p>and people who are listening but can&rsquo;t see us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually gesturing with our hands as we talk</p>
<p>without knowing it or doing it unconsciously.</p>
<p>And if we were talking on a telephone,</p>
<p>I would have one hand here</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be gesturing with the other hand</p>
<p>without even you seeing me, right?</p>
<p>And so why is that?</p>
<p>Some have argued, and I would agree,</p>
<p>but based upon what we&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>is that there is an evolutionary relationship</p>
<p>between the brain pathways</p>
<p>that control speech production and gesturing.</p>
<p>And the brain regions I mentioned</p>
<p>are directly adjacent to each other.</p>
<p>And why is that?</p>
<p>I think that the brain pathways that control speech</p>
<p>evolved out of the brain pathways</p>
<p>that control body movement, all right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you talk about Italian,</p>
<p>French, English, and so forth,</p>
<p>each one of those languages</p>
<p>come with a learned set of gestures</p>
<p>that you can communicate with.</p>
<p>Now, how is that related to other animals?</p>
<p>Well, Coco, a gorilla who was raised with humans</p>
<p>for 39 years or more,</p>
<p>learned how to do gesture communication,</p>
<p>learned how to sign language, so to speak, right?</p>
<p>But Coco couldn&rsquo;t produce those sounds.</p>
<p>Coco could understand them as well</p>
<p>by seeing somebody sign</p>
<p>or hearing somebody produce speech,</p>
<p>but Coco couldn&rsquo;t produce it with her voice.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s going on there</p>
<p>is that a number of species, not all of them,</p>
<p>a number of species have motor pathways in the brain</p>
<p>where you can do learn gesturing,</p>
<p>rudimentary language, if you wanted, say with your limbs,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not as advanced as humans,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have this extra brain pathway for the sound.</p>
<p>So they can&rsquo;t gesture with their voice</p>
<p>in the way that they gesture with their hands.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve wondered about for a very long time</p>
<p>is whether or not primitive emotions</p>
<p>and primitive sounds are the early substrate of language,</p>
<p>and whether or not there&rsquo;s a bridge</p>
<p>that we can draw between those</p>
<p>in terms of just the basic respiration systems</p>
<p>associated with different extreme feelings.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m imagining this might work.</p>
<p>When I smell something delicious,</p>
<p>I typically inhale more,</p>
<p>and I might say, mm, or something like that.</p>
<p>Whereas if I smell something putrid,</p>
<p>I typically turn away, I wince, and I will exhale,</p>
<p>you know, or sort of kind of like turn away,</p>
<p>trying to not ingest those molecules</p>
<p>or inhale those molecules.</p>
<p>I could imagine that these are the basic</p>
<p>dark and light contrasts of the language system.</p>
<p>And as I say that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that from the orientation of a vision scientist</p>
<p>who thinks of all visual images built up</p>
<p>in a very basic way of a hierarchical model</p>
<p>of the ability to see dark and light.</p>
<p>So I could imagine this kind of primitive</p>
<p>to more sophisticated pyramid of sound to language.</p>
<p>Is this a crazy idea?</p>
<p>Do we have any evidence this is the way it works?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not a crazy idea.</p>
<p>And in fact, you hit upon one of the key distinctions</p>
<p>in the field of research that I started out in,</p>
<p>which is vocal learning research.</p>
<p>So for vocal communication,</p>
<p>you have most vertebrate species vocalize,</p>
<p>but most of them are producing innate sounds</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re born with producing.</p>
<p>That is babies crying, for example, or dogs barking.</p>
<p>And only a few species have learned vocal communication,</p>
<p>the ability to imitate sounds.</p>
<p>And that is what makes spoken language special.</p>
<p>When people think of what&rsquo;s special about language,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the learned vocalizations.</p>
<p>That is what&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>And so this distinction between innateness and learned</p>
<p>is more of a bigger dichotomy</p>
<p>when it comes to vocalizations than for other behaviors</p>
<p>in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>And when you go in the brain, you see it there as well.</p>
<p>And so all the things you talked about,</p>
<p>the breathing, the grunting and so forth,</p>
<p>a lot of that is handled by the brainstem circuits,</p>
<p>you know, right around the level of your neck and below,</p>
<p>like a reflex kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, or even some emotional aspects of your behavior</p>
<p>in the hypothalamus and so forth.</p>
<p>But for a learned behavior, learning how to speak,</p>
<p>learning how to play the piano,</p>
<p>teaching a dog to learn how to do tricks</p>
<p>is using the forebrain circuits.</p>
<p>And what has happened is that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of forebrain circuits that are controlling,</p>
<p>learning how to move body parts in these species,</p>
<p>but not for the vocalizations.</p>
<p>But in humans and in parrots and some other species,</p>
<p>somehow we acquired circuits where the forebrain</p>
<p>has taken over the brainstem and now using that brainstem,</p>
<p>not only to produce the innate behaviors or vocal behaviors,</p>
<p>but the learned ones as well.</p>
<p>Do we have any sense of when modern</p>
<p>or sophisticated language evolved, you know,</p>
<p>thinking back to the species that we evolved from</p>
<p>and even within Homo sapiens,</p>
<p>has there been an evolution of language?</p>
<p>Has there been a devolution of language?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I would say, and to be able to answer that question,</p>
<p>it does come with the caveat that I think we humans</p>
<p>overrate ourselves when compared to other species.</p>
<p>And so it makes even scientists go astray</p>
<p>in trying to hypothesize when you,</p>
<p>especially you don&rsquo;t find fossil evidence</p>
<p>of language that easily out there</p>
<p>in terms of what happened in the past.</p>
<p>We, amongst the primates, which we humans belong to,</p>
<p>we are the only ones that have this</p>
<p>advanced vocal learning ability.</p>
<p>Now, when it was assumed that it was only Homo sapiens,</p>
<p>then you can go back in time now based upon genomic data,</p>
<p>not only of us living humans,</p>
<p>but of the fossils that have been found for Homo sapiens,</p>
<p>of Neanderthals, of Denisovan individuals,</p>
<p>and discover that our ancestor,</p>
<p>our human ancestors supposedly hybridized</p>
<p>with these other hominid species.</p>
<p>And it was assumed that these other hominid species</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t learn how to imitate sounds.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any species today that&rsquo;s a vocal learner</p>
<p>that can have children with a non-vocal learning species.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean it didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And when we look at the genetic data</p>
<p>from these ancestral hominids that,</p>
<p>where we can look at genes that are involved</p>
<p>in learned vocal communication,</p>
<p>they have the same sequence as we humans do</p>
<p>for genes that function in speech circuits.</p>
<p>So I think Neanderthals had spoken language.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say it&rsquo;s as advanced</p>
<p>as what it is in humans, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s been there for at least</p>
<p>between 500,000 to a million years</p>
<p>that our ancestors had this ability</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ve been coming more and more advanced</p>
<p>with it culturally and possibly genetically.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s evolved sometime</p>
<p>in the last 500,000 to a million years.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Maybe we could talk a little bit more about the overlap</p>
<p>between brain circuits that control language</p>
<p>and speech in humans and other animals.</p>
<p>I was weaned in the neuroscience era</p>
<p>where bird song and the ability of birds</p>
<p>to learn their tutor&rsquo;s song was,</p>
<p>and still is a prominent field,</p>
<p>subfield of neuroscience.</p>
<p>And then of course, neuroimaging of humans</p>
<p>speaking and learning, et cetera.</p>
<p>And this notion of a critical period,</p>
<p>a time in which languages learned more easily</p>
<p>than it is later in life.</p>
<p>And the names of the different brain areas</p>
<p>were quite different.</p>
<p>It, one opens the textbooks,</p>
<p>we hear Wernicke&rsquo;s and Broca&rsquo;s for the humans</p>
<p>and you look at the birds of it,</p>
<p>I remember, you know.</p>
<p>HPC.</p>
<p>Yeah, robust arch striatum, area X.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yeah.</p>
<p>Et cetera.</p>
<p>But for most of our listeners,</p>
<p>those names won&rsquo;t mean a whole lot.</p>
<p>But in terms of homologies between areas</p>
<p>in terms of function, what do we know?</p>
<p>And how similar or different are the brains,</p>
<p>brain areas controlling speech and language</p>
<p>in say a songbird and a young human child?</p>
<p>Yeah, so going back to the 1950s</p>
<p>or even a little earlier and Peter Mahler</p>
<p>and others who got involved in neuroethology,</p>
<p>the study of neurobiology of behavior</p>
<p>in a natural way, right?</p>
<p>You know, they started to find that behaviorally</p>
<p>there are these species of birds</p>
<p>like songbirds and parrots.</p>
<p>And now we also know hummingbirds,</p>
<p>just three of them out of the 40 something bird groups</p>
<p>out there on the planet orders,</p>
<p>that they can imitate sounds like we do.</p>
<p>And so that was a similarity.</p>
<p>In other words, they had this kind of behavior</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more similar to us than chimpanzees have with us</p>
<p>or than chickens have with them, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re close to relatives.</p>
<p>And then they discovered even more similarities,</p>
<p>these critical periods that if you remove a child,</p>
<p>you know, this unfortunately happens where a child is feral</p>
<p>and is not raised with human</p>
<p>and goes through their puberty phase of growth,</p>
<p>becomes hard for them to learn a language as an adult.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this critical period where you learn best.</p>
<p>And even later on, when you&rsquo;re in regular society,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to learn.</p>
<p>Well, the birds undergo these same thing.</p>
<p>And then it was discovered that if they become deaf,</p>
<p>we humans become deaf,</p>
<p>our speech starts to deteriorate</p>
<p>without any kind of therapy.</p>
<p>If a non-human primate or, you know,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say a chicken becomes deaf,</p>
<p>their vocalizations don&rsquo;t deteriorate,</p>
<p>very little at least.</p>
<p>Well, this happens in the vocal learning birds.</p>
<p>So there were all these behavioral parallels</p>
<p>that came along with the package.</p>
<p>And then people looked into the brain,</p>
<p>Fernando Nadava, my former PhD advisor,</p>
<p>and began to discover the area X you talked about,</p>
<p>the robust nucleus of the archipelagium.</p>
<p>And these brain pathways were not found</p>
<p>in the species who couldn&rsquo;t imitate.</p>
<p>So there was a parallel here.</p>
<p>And then jumping many years later,</p>
<p>you know, I started to dig down into these brain circuits</p>
<p>to discover that these brain circuits</p>
<p>have parallel functions with the brain circuits for humans,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re by a different name</p>
<p>like Broca&rsquo;s and laryngeal motor cortex.</p>
<p>And most recently we discovered</p>
<p>not only the actual circuitry and the connectivity</p>
<p>are similar, but the underlying genes</p>
<p>that are expressed in these brain regions</p>
<p>in a specialized way,</p>
<p>different from the rest of the brain are also similar</p>
<p>between humans and songbirds and parrots.</p>
<p>So all the way down to the genes.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re finding the specific mutations</p>
<p>are also similar, not always identical, but similar,</p>
<p>which indicates remarkable convergence</p>
<p>for a so-called complex behavior</p>
<p>in species separated by 300 million years</p>
<p>from a common ancestor.</p>
<p>And not only that, we are discovering</p>
<p>that mutations in these genes</p>
<p>that cause speech deficits in humans,</p>
<p>like in FOXP2, if you put those same mutations</p>
<p>or similar type of deficits in these vocal learning birds,</p>
<p>you get similar deficits.</p>
<p>So convergence of the behavior</p>
<p>is associated with similar genetic disorders</p>
<p>of the behavior.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>I have to ask, do hummingbirds sing or do they hum?</p>
<p>Hummingbirds hum with their wings</p>
<p>and sing with their syrinx.</p>
<p>In a coordinated way?</p>
<p>In a coordinated way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some species of hummingbirds</p>
<p>that actually will, Doug Ashworth showed this,</p>
<p>that will flap their wings</p>
<p>and create a slapping sound with their wings</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in unison with their song.</p>
<p>And you would not know it,</p>
<p>but it sounds like a particular syllable in their songs,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s their wings</p>
<p>and their voice at the same time.</p>
<p>Hummingbirds are clapping to their song.</p>
<p>Clapping, they&rsquo;re snapping their wings together</p>
<p>in unison with a song to make it like,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m going,</p>
<p>ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da,</p>
<p>you know, and I banged on the table,</p>
<p>except they make it almost sound like their voice</p>
<p>with their wings.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m-</p>
<p>And they got some of the smallest brains around.</p>
<p>I guess as a kid, you would say mind blown.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Incredible, I love hummingbirds</p>
<p>and I always feel like it&rsquo;s such a special thing</p>
<p>to get a moment to see one</p>
<p>because they move around so fast</p>
<p>and they flit away so fast in these ballistic trajectories</p>
<p>that when you get to see one stationary for a moment</p>
<p>or even just hovering there,</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re extracting so much</p>
<p>from their little microcosm of life.</p>
<p>But now I realize they&rsquo;re playing music, essentially.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s amazing about hummingbirds,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna say vocal learning species in general,</p>
<p>is that for whatever reason,</p>
<p>they seem to evolve multiple complex traits.</p>
<p>You know, this idea that evolving language,</p>
<p>spoken language in particular,</p>
<p>comes along with a set of specializations.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>When I was coming up in neuroscience,</p>
<p>I learned that, I think it was the work of Peter Marler,</p>
<p>that young birds learn, songbirds,</p>
<p>learn their tutor&rsquo;s song and learn it quite well,</p>
<p>but that they could learn the song of another tutor.</p>
<p>In other words, they could learn a different,</p>
<p>and for the listeners, I&rsquo;m doing air quotes here,</p>
<p>a different language, a different bird song,</p>
<p>different than their own species song,</p>
<p>but never as well as they could learn</p>
<p>their own natural genetically linked song.</p>
<p>Yes. Genetically linked,</p>
<p>meaning that it would be like me being raised</p>
<p>in a different culture,</p>
<p>and that I would learn the other language,</p>
<p>but not as well as I would have learned English.</p>
<p>This is the idea.</p>
<p>Yes. Is that true?</p>
<p>That is true, yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I learned growing up as well,</p>
<p>and talked to Peter Marler himself about before he passed.</p>
<p>Yeah, he used to call it</p>
<p>the innate predisposition to learn.</p>
<p>All right, so, which would be kind of the equivalent</p>
<p>in the linguistic community of universal grammar.</p>
<p>There is something genetically influencing</p>
<p>our vocal communication on top of what we learn culturally.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this balance</p>
<p>between the genetic control of speech,</p>
<p>or a song in these birds,</p>
<p>and the learned cultural control.</p>
<p>And so, yes, if you were to take,</p>
<p>you know, I mean, in this case,</p>
<p>we actually tried this at Rockefeller later on,</p>
<p>take a zebra finch and raise it with a canary,</p>
<p>it would sing a song that was sort of like</p>
<p>a hybrid in between.</p>
<p>We call it a caninch, right?</p>
<p>And vice versa for the canary,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something different</p>
<p>about their vocal musculature,</p>
<p>or the circuitry in the brain.</p>
<p>And with a zebra finch,</p>
<p>even with a closely related species,</p>
<p>if you would take a zebra finch,</p>
<p>a young animal, and in one cage next to it,</p>
<p>place its own species, adult male, right?</p>
<p>And in the other cage,</p>
<p>place a Bengalis finch next to it,</p>
<p>it would preferably learn the song</p>
<p>from its own species neighbor.</p>
<p>But if you remove its neighbor,</p>
<p>it would learn that Bengalis finch very well.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, it has something to do with also</p>
<p>the social bonding with your own species.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>That raises a question that I&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>based on something I also heard,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have any scientific,</p>
<p>peer reviewed publication to point to,</p>
<p>which is this idea of pigeon,</p>
<p>not the bird, but this idea of</p>
<p>when multiple cultures and languages</p>
<p>converge in a given geographic area,</p>
<p>that the children of all the different native languages</p>
<p>will come up with their own language.</p>
<p>I think this was in island culture,</p>
<p>maybe in Hawaii, called pigeon,</p>
<p>which is sort of a hybrid of the various languages</p>
<p>that their parents speak at home.</p>
<p>And that they themselves speak,</p>
<p>and that somehow pigeon, again, not the bird,</p>
<p>but a language called pigeon for reasons I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>harbors certain basic elements of all language.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Is that not true?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t studied enough myself</p>
<p>in terms of pigeon specifically,</p>
<p>but in terms of cultural evolution of language</p>
<p>and hybridization between different cultures and so forth,</p>
<p>even amongst birds with different dialects,</p>
<p>and you bring them together,</p>
<p>what is going on here is cultural evolution</p>
<p>remarkably tracks genetic evolution.</p>
<p>So if you bring people from two separate populations</p>
<p>together that have been in their separate populations,</p>
<p>evolutionarily at least, for hundreds of generations,</p>
<p>so someone speaking Chinese, someone speaking English,</p>
<p>and that child then is learning from both of them,</p>
<p>yes, that child&rsquo;s gonna be able to pick up</p>
<p>and merge phonemes and words together</p>
<p>in a way that an adult wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because why they&rsquo;re experiencing both languages</p>
<p>at the same time during their critical period years</p>
<p>in a way that adults would not be able to experience.</p>
<p>And so you get a hybrid.</p>
<p>And the lowest common denominator</p>
<p>is gonna be what they share.</p>
<p>And so the phonemes that they&rsquo;ve retained</p>
<p>in each of their languages is what&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>I imagine, used the most.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got brain circuits in songbirds and in humans</p>
<p>that in many ways are similar,</p>
<p>perhaps not in their exact wiring,</p>
<p>but in their basic contour of wiring,</p>
<p>and genes that are expressed in both sets of neural circuits</p>
<p>in very distinct species that are responsible</p>
<p>for these phenomenon we&rsquo;re calling speech and language.</p>
<p>What sorts of things are those genes controlling?</p>
<p>I could imagine they were controlling</p>
<p>the wiring of connections between brain areas,</p>
<p>essentially a map of a circuit,</p>
<p>basically like an engineer would design a circuit</p>
<p>for speech and language,</p>
<p>nature designed this for speech and language,</p>
<p>but presumably other things too,</p>
<p>like the ability to connect motor patterns</p>
<p>within the throat, of muscles within the throat,</p>
<p>when they control the tongue.</p>
<p>I mean, what are these genes doing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve made some very good guesses there</p>
<p>that make sense.</p>
<p>So yes, one of the things that differ</p>
<p>in the speech pathways of us</p>
<p>and these song pathways of birds</p>
<p>is some of the connections are fundamentally different</p>
<p>than the surrounding circuits,</p>
<p>like a direct cortical connection</p>
<p>from the areas that control vocalizations in the cortex</p>
<p>to the motor neurons that control the larynx in humans</p>
<p>or the syrinx in birds.</p>
<p>And so we actually made a prediction</p>
<p>that since some of these connections differ,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna find genes that control neural connectivity</p>
<p>and that specialize in that function that differ.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what we found.</p>
<p>Genes that control what we call axon guidance</p>
<p>and form interstitial connections.</p>
<p>And what was interesting,</p>
<p>it was sort of in the opposite direction than we expected.</p>
<p>That is some of these genes,</p>
<p>actually a number of them that control neural connectivity</p>
<p>were turned off in the speech circuit.</p>
<p>All right, and it didn&rsquo;t make sense to us at first.</p>
<p>And so we started to realize the function of these genes</p>
<p>are to repel connections from forming.</p>
<p>So repulsive molecules.</p>
<p>And so when you turn them off,</p>
<p>they allow certain connections to form</p>
<p>that normally would have not formed.</p>
<p>So by turning it off,</p>
<p>you got to gain a function for speech, right?</p>
<p>Other genes that surprised us</p>
<p>were genes involved in calcium buffering,</p>
<p>neural protection,</p>
<p>like a parvalbumin or a heat shock protein.</p>
<p>So when your brain gets hot, these proteins turn on.</p>
<p>And we couldn&rsquo;t figure out for a long time,</p>
<p>why is that the case?</p>
<p>And then the idea popped to me one day,</p>
<p>I said, ah, when I heard the larynx</p>
<p>is the fastest firing muscles in the body.</p>
<p>All right, in order to vibrate sound</p>
<p>and modulate sound in the way we do,</p>
<p>you have to control, you have to move those muscles,</p>
<p>three to four to five times faster</p>
<p>than just regular walking or running.</p>
<p>And so when you stick electrodes in the brain areas</p>
<p>that control learn vocalizations in these birds,</p>
<p>and I think in humans as well,</p>
<p>those neurons are firing at a higher rate</p>
<p>to control these muscles.</p>
<p>And so what is that going to do?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have lots of toxicity in those neurons,</p>
<p>unless you upregulate molecules that take out</p>
<p>the extra load that is needed to control the larynx.</p>
<p>And then finally, a third set of genes</p>
<p>that are specialized in these speech circuit</p>
<p>are involved in neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity meaning allowing the brain circuits</p>
<p>to be more flexible so you can learn better.</p>
<p>And why is that?</p>
<p>I think learning how to produce speech</p>
<p>is a more complex learning ability</p>
<p>than say learning how to walk</p>
<p>or learning how to do tricks and jumps and so forth</p>
<p>that dogs do.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting as you say that,</p>
<p>because I realized that many aspects of speech</p>
<p>are sort of reflexive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about each word I&rsquo;m going to say,</p>
<p>they just sort of roll out of my mouth.</p>
<p>Hopefully with some forethought,</p>
<p>we both know people that seem to speak, think less,</p>
<p>fewer synapses between their brain and their mouth</p>
<p>than others, right?</p>
<p>A lot of examples out there.</p>
<p>And some people are very deliberate in their speech,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, that much of speech has to be precise</p>
<p>and some of it less precise.</p>
<p>In terms of plasticity of speech</p>
<p>and the ability to learn multiple languages,</p>
<p>but even just one language,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the critical period,</p>
<p>the so-called critical period?</p>
<p>Why is it that, so my niece speaks Spanish,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s Guatemalan, speaks Spanish and English</p>
<p>incredibly well.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s 14 years old.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled with Spanish my whole life.</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s bilingual, my mother is not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to learn Spanish as an adult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really challenging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told that had I learned it when I was eight,</p>
<p>I would be better off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Or it would be installed within me.</p>
<p>So the first question is,</p>
<p>is it easier to learn multiple languages</p>
<p>without an accent early in life?</p>
<p>And if so, why?</p>
<p>And then the second question is,</p>
<p>if one can already speak more than one language</p>
<p>as a consequence of childhood learning,</p>
<p>is it easier to acquire new languages later on?</p>
<p>So the answer to both of those questions is yes,</p>
<p>in that, but to explain this,</p>
<p>I need to let you know,</p>
<p>actually the entire brain</p>
<p>is undergoing a critical period development,</p>
<p>not just the speech pathways.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s easier to learn how to play a piano.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to learn how to ride a bike for the first time</p>
<p>and so forth as a young child than it is later in life.</p>
<p>What I mean easier in terms of when you start from,</p>
<p>you start from first principles of learning something.</p>
<p>So the very first time,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna learn Chinese as a child</p>
<p>versus the very first time you learned Chinese as an adult,</p>
<p>or learning to play piano as a child versus an adult.</p>
<p>But the speech pathways or let&rsquo;s say speech behavior,</p>
<p>I think has a stronger critical period</p>
<p>change to it than other circuits.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s going on there in general?</p>
<p>Why do you need a critical period to make you more stable,</p>
<p>to make you more stubborn, so to speak?</p>
<p>The reason I believe is that the brain is not for,</p>
<p>brain can only hold so much information.</p>
<p>And if you are undergoing rapid learning</p>
<p>to acquire new knowledge,</p>
<p>you also have to dump stuff,</p>
<p>put memory or information in the trash, like in a computer.</p>
<p>You only have so many gigabases of memory.</p>
<p>And so therefore, plus also for survival,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna keep forgetting things.</p>
<p>And so the brain is designed, I believe,</p>
<p>to undergo this critical period and solidify the circuits</p>
<p>with what you learned as a child</p>
<p>and you use that for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>And we humans stay even more plastic in our brain functions</p>
<p>controlled by a gene called SRGAP2.</p>
<p>We have an extra copy of it</p>
<p>that leaves our speech circuit and other brain regions</p>
<p>in a more immature state throughout life</p>
<p>compared to other animals.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re more immature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still juvenile-like compared to other animals.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>But we still go through the critical periods</p>
<p>like they all do.</p>
<p>And now the question you asked about</p>
<p>if you learn more languages as a child,</p>
<p>is it easier to learn as an adult?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a common finding out there in the literature.</p>
<p>There are some that argue against it.</p>
<p>But for those that support it,</p>
<p>the idea there is you are born with a set of innate sounds</p>
<p>you can produce, the phonemes,</p>
<p>and you narrow that down</p>
<p>because not all languages use all of them.</p>
<p>And so you narrow down the ones you use</p>
<p>to string the phonemes together in the words that you learn</p>
<p>and you maintain those phonemes as an adult.</p>
<p>And here comes along another language</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s using those phonemes</p>
<p>or in different combinations you&rsquo;re not used to.</p>
<p>And therefore, it&rsquo;s like starting from first principles.</p>
<p>But if you already have them in multiple languages</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>then it makes it easier to use them</p>
<p>in another third or fourth language.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like your brain</p>
<p>has maintained greater plasticity.</p>
<p>Your brain has maintained greater ability</p>
<p>to produce different sounds</p>
<p>that then allows you to learn another language faster.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Are the hand gestures associated with sounds</p>
<p>or with meanings of words?</p>
<p>I think the hand gestures are associated</p>
<p>with both the sounds and the meaning.</p>
<p>When I say sound, like if you are really angry, right,</p>
<p>and you are making a loud screaming noise, right,</p>
<p>you may make hand gestures</p>
<p>that look like you&rsquo;re gonna beat the wall, right,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re making loud sounds and loud gestures, right?</p>
<p>But if you wanna explain something like, come over here,</p>
<p>what I just do now to you for those who can&rsquo;t see me,</p>
<p>I swung my hand towards you and swung it here to me.</p>
<p>That has a meaning to it, to come here.</p>
<p>So just like with the voice,</p>
<p>the hand gestures are producing both qualities of sounds.</p>
<p>And for people that speak multiple languages,</p>
<p>especially those that learn those multiple languages</p>
<p>early in development,</p>
<p>do they switch their patterns of motor movements</p>
<p>according to, let&rsquo;s say, going from Italian to Arabic</p>
<p>or from Arabic to French</p>
<p>in a way that matches the precision of language</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re speaking?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>You just asked me a question I don&rsquo;t know the answer to.</p>
<p>I would imagine that would make sense</p>
<p>because of switching in terms of,</p>
<p>sometimes people might call this code switching,</p>
<p>even different dialects of the same language.</p>
<p>Could you do that with your gestures?</p>
<p>I imagine so, but I really don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I certainly don&rsquo;t know from my own experience</p>
<p>because I only speak one language.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>To go a little bit into the abstract, but not too far,</p>
<p>what about modes of speech and language</p>
<p>that seem to have a depth of emotionality and meaning,</p>
<p>but for which it departs from structured language?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>Poetry.</p>
<p>I think of musicians, like there are some Bob Dylan songs</p>
<p>that to me, I understand the individual words.</p>
<p>I like to think there&rsquo;s an emotion associated with it.</p>
<p>At least I experienced some sort of emotion,</p>
<p>and I have a guess about what he was experiencing.</p>
<p>But if I were to just read it linearly without the music</p>
<p>and without him singing it or somebody singing it like him,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t hold any meaning.</p>
<p>So in other words, words that seem to have meaning,</p>
<p>but not associated with language,</p>
<p>but somehow tap into an emotionality.</p>
<p>Yep, absolutely.</p>
<p>So we call this difference semantic communication,</p>
<p>communication with meaning, and effective communication,</p>
<p>communication that has more of an emotional feeling</p>
<p>content to it, but not with the semantics.</p>
<p>And the two can be mixed up.</p>
<p>Like with singing words that have meaning,</p>
<p>but also have this effective emotional,</p>
<p>you just love the sound of the singer that you&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>And initially, psychologists, scientists in general</p>
<p>thought that these were going to be controlled</p>
<p>by different brain circuits.</p>
<p>And it is the case, there are emotional brain centers</p>
<p>in the hypothalamus, in the cingulate cortex, and so forth,</p>
<p>that do give tone to the sounds.</p>
<p>But I believe, based upon imaging work</p>
<p>and work we see in birds,</p>
<p>when birds are communicating semantic information</p>
<p>in their sounds, which is not too often, but it happens,</p>
<p>versus effective communication,</p>
<p>sing because I&rsquo;m trying to attract the mate,</p>
<p>my courtship song, or defend my territory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same brain circuits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same speech-like or song circuits</p>
<p>are being used in different ways.</p>
<p>A friend of mine who&rsquo;s also a therapist said to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to say I love you with intense hatred</p>
<p>and to say I hate you with intense love.</p>
<p>And reminded me that it&rsquo;s possible to hear</p>
<p>both of those statements in either way.</p>
<p>So I guess it&rsquo;s not just limited to song or poetry.</p>
<p>It also, there&rsquo;s something about the intention</p>
<p>and the emotional context in which something&rsquo;s spoken</p>
<p>that it can heavily shape the way</p>
<p>that we interpret what we hear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I consider all of that actually meaning,</p>
<p>even though I defined it as people commonly do</p>
<p>semantic and effective communication,</p>
<p>effective communication to say I hate you,</p>
<p>but meant love, right, does have emotional meaning to it.</p>
<p>And so one&rsquo;s more like an object kind of meaning</p>
<p>or an abstract kind of meaning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several other points here I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>for those listening out there to hear,</p>
<p>is that when I say also this effective</p>
<p>and semantic communication being used</p>
<p>by similar brain circuits,</p>
<p>it also matters the side of the brain.</p>
<p>In birds and in humans, there&rsquo;s left right dominance</p>
<p>for learned communication, learned sound communication.</p>
<p>So the left in us humans is more dominant for speech,</p>
<p>but the right has a more balance for singing</p>
<p>or processing musical sounds</p>
<p>as opposed to processing speech.</p>
<p>Both get used for both reasons.</p>
<p>And so when people say your right brain</p>
<p>is your artistic brain</p>
<p>and your left brain is your thinking brain,</p>
<p>this is what they&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s another distinction.</p>
<p>The second thing that&rsquo;s useful to know</p>
<p>is that all vocal learning species</p>
<p>use their learned sounds for this emotional,</p>
<p>effective kind of communication,</p>
<p>but only a few of them like humans</p>
<p>and some parrots and dolphins</p>
<p>use it for the semantic kind of communication</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re calling speech.</p>
<p>And that has led a number of people to hypothesize</p>
<p>that the evolution of spoken language of speech</p>
<p>evolved first for singing,</p>
<p>for this more like emotional kind of made attraction,</p>
<p>like the Jennifer Lopez,</p>
<p>the Ricky Martin kind of songs and so forth.</p>
<p>And then later on,</p>
<p>it became used for abstract communication</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a perfect segue for me</p>
<p>to be able to ask you about your background</p>
<p>and motor control,</p>
<p>not only of the hands, but of the body.</p>
<p>So you have a number of important distinctions to your name,</p>
<p>but one of them is that you were a member</p>
<p>of the Alvin Ailey dance school,</p>
<p>school of dance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re an accomplished and quite able dancer, right?</p>
<p>Tell us a little bit about your background</p>
<p>in the world of dance</p>
<p>and how it informs your interest in neuroscience,</p>
<p>excuse me,</p>
<p>and perhaps even how it relates specifically</p>
<p>to your work on speech and language.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And then this kind of history even goes before my time.</p>
<p>So in my family, my mother and father&rsquo;s side,</p>
<p>they both went to the high school of music and art</p>
<p>here in New York city.</p>
<p>And particularly my mother&rsquo;s family,</p>
<p>going back multiple generations,</p>
<p>they were singers.</p>
<p>And I even did my family genealogy</p>
<p>and found out not only, you know,</p>
<p>we have some relationships to some well-known singers,</p>
<p>distant relationships like Thelonious Monk,</p>
<p>but going back to the plantations in North Carolina</p>
<p>and so forth,</p>
<p>my ancestors were singers in the church for the, you know,</p>
<p>the towns and so forth.</p>
<p>And this somehow got passed on multiple generations</p>
<p>to my family.</p>
<p>And I thought I was going to grow up</p>
<p>and be a famous singer, right?</p>
<p>And me and my brothers and sister formed a band</p>
<p>when we were kids and so forth.</p>
<p>And, but it turned out that I didn&rsquo;t inherit</p>
<p>the singing talents of some of my other family members,</p>
<p>even though, you know, it was, you know, okay, you know,</p>
<p>but not like my brother or not like my mother or my aunts</p>
<p>and my cousin Pudufay,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now a talented Native American singer.</p>
<p>And so, so what,</p>
<p>that then influenced me to do other things.</p>
<p>And I started, you know, competing in dance contests,</p>
<p>you know, actually this is around the time</p>
<p>of the Saturday Night Fever.</p>
<p>And I was, as a teenager and I started winning</p>
<p>dance contests and I thought, oh, I can dance.</p>
<p>And I auditioned for the High School of Performing Arts</p>
<p>and I got in here in New York City</p>
<p>and got into a ballet dance and got in, right?</p>
<p>And thought if I learn ballet, I can learn everything else.</p>
<p>It was that idea.</p>
<p>If you learn something classical,</p>
<p>it can teach you for everything else.</p>
<p>And I was, yeah, at Alvin Ailey Dance School,</p>
<p>Joffrey Ballet Dance School.</p>
<p>And at the end of my senior concert,</p>
<p>I had this opportunity to audition</p>
<p>for the Alvin Ailey Dance Company</p>
<p>and I had an opportunity to go to college.</p>
<p>And I also fell in love with another passion</p>
<p>that my father had, which was science.</p>
<p>And so I liked science in high school</p>
<p>and I found an overlap also between the arts and sciences,</p>
<p>you know, both required creativity, hard work,</p>
<p>discipline, you know, new discovery,</p>
<p>both weren&rsquo;t boring to me.</p>
<p>And the one decision I made at that senior dance concert</p>
<p>was, you know, when talking to the Alvin Ailey recruiter</p>
<p>and thinking about it, I have to make a decision.</p>
<p>And I thought something my mother taught me</p>
<p>because she was grown up in the 1960s cultural revolution,</p>
<p>do something that has a positive impact on society.</p>
<p>And I thought that I can do that better</p>
<p>as a dancer than a scientist.</p>
<p>So now jump, I get into college, undergraduate school,</p>
<p>I major in molecular biology and mathematics.</p>
<p>I decided I wanna be a biologist,</p>
<p>got into graduate school,</p>
<p>wanted to study the brain at the Rockefeller University.</p>
<p>So I went from Hunter College to Rockefeller University.</p>
<p>And so now I got to the brain</p>
<p>and why did I choose the brain</p>
<p>is because it controls dancing.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t, there wasn&rsquo;t anybody studying dancing.</p>
<p>And I wanted to study the brain,</p>
<p>something that it does,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really interesting and complex.</p>
<p>And I thought, ah, language is what it does.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t study that in mice,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t study non-human primates,</p>
<p>but these birds do this wonderful thing</p>
<p>that Fernando Nadaban was studying at Rockefeller.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what got me into the birds.</p>
<p>And then jumping now 15 years later,</p>
<p>you know, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Even after I&rsquo;m into now having my own lab</p>
<p>studying vocal learning in these birds</p>
<p>as a model for language in humans,</p>
<p>it turns out that, you know,</p>
<p>Ani Patel and, you know, others have discovered</p>
<p>that only vocal learning species can learn how to dance.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen these,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just scrolling through the files here in my mind.</p>
<p>I think about every once in a while,</p>
<p>someone will, I loved parrots.</p>
<p>Every once in a while,</p>
<p>someone will send me one of these little Instagram</p>
<p>or Twitter videos of a parrot</p>
<p>doing what looks to me like dance.</p>
<p>Typically it&rsquo;s a cockatoo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>With even foot stomping to the sound.</p>
<p>The famous one called Snowball out there,</p>
<p>but there are many Snowballs out there, yes.</p>
<p>All the dancing birds are named Snowball.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting tactic.</p>
<p>So only animals with language dance.</p>
<p>Yeah, vocal learning in particular,</p>
<p>the ability to imitate sounds.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And this now is bringing my life full circle.</p>
<p>And so when that was discovered in 2009,</p>
<p>at that same time in my lab at Duke,</p>
<p>we discovered that vocal learning brain pathways</p>
<p>in songbirds as well as in humans and in parrots,</p>
<p>like Snowball, are embedded within circuits</p>
<p>that control learning how to move.</p>
<p>And that led us to a theory called the brain pathway</p>
<p>or motor theory of vocal learning origin,</p>
<p>where the brain pathways for vocal learning and speech</p>
<p>evolved by a whole duplication</p>
<p>of the surrounding motor circuits</p>
<p>involving learning how to move.</p>
<p>Now, how does that explain dance, right?</p>
<p>Well, when Snowball, the cockatoos, are dancing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using the brain regions</p>
<p>around their speech-like circuits</p>
<p>to do this dancing behavior.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>What we hypothesize and now like to test</p>
<p>is that when speech evolved in humans</p>
<p>and the equivalent behavior in parrots and songbirds,</p>
<p>it required a very tight integration</p>
<p>in the brain regions that can hear sound</p>
<p>with the brain regions that control your muscles</p>
<p>from moving your larynx and tongue and so forth</p>
<p>for producing sound.</p>
<p>And that tight auditory motor integration,</p>
<p>we argued, then contaminated the surrounding brain regions.</p>
<p>And that contamination of the surrounding brain regions</p>
<p>now allows us humans in particular in parrots</p>
<p>to coordinate our muscle movements</p>
<p>of the rest of the body with sound</p>
<p>in the same way we do for speech sounds.</p>
<p>Well, so we&rsquo;re speaking with our bodies when we dance.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>And I have to say that as poor as I am</p>
<p>at speaking multiple languages,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m even worse at dancing, so.</p>
<p>But I guarantee you&rsquo;re better than a monkey.</p>
<p>But not Snowball the cockatoo.</p>
<p>Maybe not Snowball.</p>
<p>On YouTube, we have a video</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some scientists dancing with Snowball</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see Snowball&rsquo;s doing better</p>
<p>than some of the scientists.</p>
<p>Okay, well, as long as I&rsquo;m not the worst</p>
<p>of all scientists at dancing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>May it save me someday.</p>
<p>You said something incredible that I completely believe,</p>
<p>even though I have minimum to,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say minimum dancing ability.</p>
<p>I can get by at a party or wedding</p>
<p>without complete embarrassment,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have any structured training.</p>
<p>So the body clearly can communicate with movement.</p>
<p>As a trained dancer and knowing other trained dancers,</p>
<p>I always think of dance and bodily movement</p>
<p>and communication through bodily movement</p>
<p>as a form of a wordlessness, like a state of wordlessness.</p>
<p>In fact, the few times when I think</p>
<p>that maybe I&rsquo;m actually dancing modestly well</p>
<p>for the context that I&rsquo;m in,</p>
<p>where I see other people dancing</p>
<p>and they seem to just be very much in the movement,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a state of non-language,</p>
<p>non-spoken language.</p>
<p>And yet what you&rsquo;re telling me is that there&rsquo;s a direct</p>
<p>bridge at some level between the movement of the body</p>
<p>and language.</p>
<p>So is there a language of the body</p>
<p>that is distinct from the language of speech?</p>
<p>And if so, or if not, how do those map onto one another?</p>
<p>What does that Venn diagram look like?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So let me define first dance in this context</p>
<p>of vocal learning species.</p>
<p>This is the kind of dancing that we are specialized in doing</p>
<p>and the vocal learning species are specialized in doing</p>
<p>is synchronizing body movements of muscles</p>
<p>to the rhythmic beat of music.</p>
<p>And for some reason, we like doing that.</p>
<p>We like synchronizing to sound</p>
<p>and doing it together as a group of people.</p>
<p>And that kind of communication amongst ourselves</p>
<p>is more like the effective kind of communication</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier, unlike the semantic kind.</p>
<p>So we humans are using our voices</p>
<p>more for the semantic abstract communication,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re using learned dance</p>
<p>for the effective emotional bonding kind of communication.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t communicate</p>
<p>semantic information in dance, and we do it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as popular.</p>
<p>You know, like a ballet that, you know, in the Nutcracker,</p>
<p>it is popular, you know, where they are communicating,</p>
<p>you know, the Arabian guy comes out,</p>
<p>which I was the Arabian guy in the ballet Nutcracker,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I remember it.</p>
<p>Yeah, for the Westchester Ballet Company</p>
<p>when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re trying to communicate meaning</p>
<p>in our ballet dance, and it can go on</p>
<p>with a whole story and so forth.</p>
<p>But people don&rsquo;t interpret that as clearly as speech.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re seeing the ballet</p>
<p>with semantic communication with a lot of emotional content.</p>
<p>Whereas you go out to a club, you know,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;re not communicating,</p>
<p>okay, how are you feeling today?</p>
<p>Tell me about your day and so forth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to synchronize with other people</p>
<p>in an effective way.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s because the dance brain circuit</p>
<p>inherited the more ancient part of the speech circuit,</p>
<p>which was for singing.</p>
<p>I always had the feeling that with certain forms of music,</p>
<p>in particular opera, but any kind of music</p>
<p>where there are some long notes sung,</p>
<p>that at some level there was a literal resonance</p>
<p>created between the singer and the listener.</p>
<p>That, or I think of like the deep voice of a Johnny Cash,</p>
<p>or where at some level,</p>
<p>you can almost feel the voice in your own body.</p>
<p>And in theory, that could be the vibration</p>
<p>of the firing of the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>controlling the diaphragm for all I know.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that there&rsquo;s a coordination</p>
<p>between performer and audience</p>
<p>at the level of mind and body?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say possibly yes.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because I just came back</p>
<p>from a conference on the neurobiology of dance.</p>
<p>Clearly I&rsquo;m going to the wrong meetings.</p>
<p>Vision science can be so boring.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, one of my colleagues,</p>
<p>Tecumseh Fitch and Jonathan Fritz,</p>
<p>they organized a particular section</p>
<p>on this conference in Virginia.</p>
<p>And this is the first time I was in the room</p>
<p>with so many neuroscientists</p>
<p>studying the neurobiology of dance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new field now in the last five years.</p>
<p>And there was one lab</p>
<p>where they were putting EEG electrodes on the dancers,</p>
<p>on two different dancers partnering with each other,</p>
<p>as well as the audience seeing the dance.</p>
<p>And some argued, okay,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listening to the music as well,</p>
<p>how are you responding?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re asking a question about music.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m giving you an answer about dance.</p>
<p>And what they found is that, you know,</p>
<p>the dancers, when they resonated with each other</p>
<p>during the dance,</p>
<p>or the audience listening to the dancers and the music,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some resonance going on there</p>
<p>that they score as higher resonance.</p>
<p>Their brain activity with these wireless EEG signals</p>
<p>are showing something different.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I say possibly yes.</p>
<p>It needs more rigorous study.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is some stuff they publish,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not prime time yet,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re trying to figure this out.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So at least if I can&rsquo;t dance well,</p>
<p>maybe I can hear and feel what it is</p>
<p>to dance in a certain way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And this will be,</p>
<p>some people will think that they,</p>
<p>even songs that they hear,</p>
<p>and they can almost sing to themselves in their own head,</p>
<p>and they know what they want it to sound like.</p>
<p>And you know when it really sounds good,</p>
<p>what it sounds like,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t get their voice to do it.</p>
<p>For those listening, I&rsquo;m raising my hand.</p>
<p>No musical ability.</p>
<p>Others in my household have tremendous musical ability</p>
<p>with instruments and with voice, but not me.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and so this is one of my selfish goals</p>
<p>of trying to find the genetics</p>
<p>of why can some people sing really well and some not?</p>
<p>Is there some genetic predisposition to that?</p>
<p>And then can I modify my own muscles</p>
<p>or brain circuits to sing better?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still after the sing.</p>
<p>I guess this is what happens when siblings</p>
<p>are very in proficiency,</p>
<p>is that that competitiveness</p>
<p>amongst brothers and sisters never goes away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to be as good as my brother,</p>
<p>Mark and Victor, for the hope my entire life.</p>
<p>Watch out, Mark and Victor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s coming for you with neuroscience to back him.</p>
<p>Earlier, you said that you discovered that you could dance.</p>
<p>That caught my ear.</p>
<p>It sounds like you didn&rsquo;t actually have to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting you didn&rsquo;t work hard at it,</p>
<p>but that at the moment where you discovered it,</p>
<p>it just sort of was a skill that you had</p>
<p>that up until that point,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t target a life in the world of dance.</p>
<p>But the fact that you, quote unquote,</p>
<p>discovered that you could dance really well</p>
<p>and then went to this incredible school of dance</p>
<p>and did well, tells me that perhaps there is an ability</p>
<p>that was built up in childhood,</p>
<p>and or that perhaps we do all have different genetic leanings</p>
<p>for different motor functions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, for me, both explanations could be possible.</p>
<p>For the first, yeah, I grew up in a family</p>
<p>listening to Motown songs,</p>
<p>dancing at parties and so forth, family parties,</p>
<p>an African-American family, basically.</p>
<p>And so I grew up dancing from a young child,</p>
<p>but this discovery, maybe dancing even more so</p>
<p>in terms of a talent, it could, the genetic component,</p>
<p>if it really exists, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>With my 23andMe results, it says I have</p>
<p>the genetic substitutions that are associated</p>
<p>with high-intensity athletes and fast-twist muscles.</p>
<p>And who knows, maybe that could have something to do</p>
<p>with me being able to synchronize my body</p>
<p>to rhythmic sounds, maybe, maybe better than some others.</p>
<p>It turns out that my genetics also show</p>
<p>that I have a genetic substitute that does it,</p>
<p>that makes it hard for me to sing on pitch.</p>
<p>And so that does correlate with my,</p>
<p>even though I can sing on this pitch,</p>
<p>especially if I hear a piano or kind of playing it,</p>
<p>but maybe that&rsquo;s why my siblings,</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t have that genetic predisposition</p>
<p>in his 23andMe results, could go along</p>
<p>with the genetic component as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining family gatherings with 23andMe data</p>
<p>and intense arguments about it, innate and learned ability.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Fun, love to be an attendant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not inviting myself to your Thanksgiving dinner,</p>
<p>by the way, but I suppose I am.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring my 23andMe data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to chat a moment about facial expression,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a form of motor pattern that,</p>
<p>I think for most people out there,</p>
<p>just think about smiling and frowning,</p>
<p>but there are, of course, thousands,</p>
<p>if not millions of micro expressions</p>
<p>and things of that sort, many of which are subconscious.</p>
<p>And we are all familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that when what somebody says doesn&rsquo;t match</p>
<p>some specific feature of their facial expression,</p>
<p>that it can call, that mismatch can cue our attention,</p>
<p>especially among people that know each other very well.</p>
<p>Like somebody will say, well, you said that,</p>
<p>but your right eye twitched a little bit in a way</p>
<p>that tells me that you didn&rsquo;t really mean that,</p>
<p>these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Or when, in the opposite example,</p>
<p>when the emotionality and the content of our speech</p>
<p>is matched to a facial expression,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s just so wonderful about that,</p>
<p>because it seems like everything&rsquo;s aligned.</p>
<p>So how does the motor circuitry</p>
<p>that controls facial expression</p>
<p>map onto the brain circuits that control language, speech,</p>
<p>and even bodily and hand movements?</p>
<p>You ask a great question,</p>
<p>because we both know some colleagues</p>
<p>like Winrick Freibold at Rockefeller University</p>
<p>who study facial expression and the neurobiology behind it.</p>
<p>And now we both share some students that we&rsquo;re co-mentoring</p>
<p>and talk about this same question that you brought up.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m learning a lot is that non-human primates</p>
<p>have a lot of diversity in their facial expression</p>
<p>like we humans do.</p>
<p>And what we know about the neurobiology</p>
<p>of brain regions controlling those muscles of the face</p>
<p>is that these non-human primates and some other species</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t learn how to imitate vocalizations,</p>
<p>they have strong connections from the cortical regions</p>
<p>to the motor neurons that control facial expressions,</p>
<p>but absent connections or weak connections</p>
<p>to the motor neurons that control the voice.</p>
<p>So I think our diverse facial expression,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s more diverse than these non-human primates,</p>
<p>there was already a pre-existing diversity of communication,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s intentional or unconscious</p>
<p>through facial expression in our ancestors.</p>
<p>And on top of that, we humans now add the voice</p>
<p>along with those facial expressions.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>In terms of language learning, when we&rsquo;re kids,</p>
<p>I mean, children fortunately are not told</p>
<p>to fake their expressions or to smile</p>
<p>when they say, I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>So at some point, everybody learns for better or for worse</p>
<p>how to untangle these different components</p>
<p>of hand movement, body posture,</p>
<p>speech and facial expression.</p>
<p>But in their best form, I would say,</p>
<p>assuming that the best form is always,</p>
<p>I guess there are instances where, for safety reasons,</p>
<p>one might need to feign some of these aspects of language.</p>
<p>But in most cases, when those are aligned,</p>
<p>it seems like that could reflect</p>
<p>that all the different circuitries are operating in parallel</p>
<p>but that the ability to misalign these</p>
<p>is also a powerful aspect to our maturation.</p>
<p>I even think of theater, for instance,</p>
<p>where deliberate disentangling of these areas is important,</p>
<p>but also we know when an actor, when it feels real</p>
<p>and when it looks like, when bad acting is oftentimes</p>
<p>when the facial expression or body posture</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t quite match what we&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>So are these skills that people that learn</p>
<p>and acquire according to adaptability and profession</p>
<p>or do you think that all children and all adults</p>
<p>eventually learn how to couple</p>
<p>and uncouple these circuits a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s this similar argument</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier about the innate</p>
<p>and the learned for the vocalizations.</p>
<p>And by the way, when I say we humans have facial expressions</p>
<p>associated with our vocalizations</p>
<p>in a different way than primates, non-human primates,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the learned vocalizations I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>So there is a common view out there</p>
<p>that facial expressions in non-human species</p>
<p>like non-human primates,</p>
<p>or you can have them in birds too, are innate, all right?</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re reflexive controlled.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some learned component to it.</p>
<p>And I think we have more learning component to it as well,</p>
<p>but we also have an innate component.</p>
<p>And so if you try to put your hands behind your back</p>
<p>and hold your fist, or even just not,</p>
<p>and try to speak and try to communicate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually harder to do.</p>
<p>You have to force yourself or put it by your side.</p>
<p>This comes naturally.</p>
<p>Facial expressions comes naturally</p>
<p>because there is an innate component.</p>
<p>And yes, you have to learn how to dissociate the two,</p>
<p>communicate something angry with your hands</p>
<p>or with your face, but politely with your voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to separate out those two</p>
<p>because there is that innate component</p>
<p>that brings them together.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like an email too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re emailing and someone says something by email.</p>
<p>Someone can interpret that angrily or gently,</p>
<p>and it becomes ambiguous.</p>
<p>The facial expressions get rid of that ambiguity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad you brought that out</p>
<p>because my next question was and is about written language.</p>
<p>The first question I&rsquo;ll ask is when you write,</p>
<p>either type or write things out by hand,</p>
<p>do you hear the content of what you want to write</p>
<p>in your head, just you personally?</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>And I know that I do</p>
<p>because I was trying to figure out a debate</p>
<p>about this issue and trying to resolve the debate</p>
<p>with my own self-experimentation on me.</p>
<p>I asked that because a quite well-known colleague of ours,</p>
<p>Karl Deisseroth at Stanford, who&rsquo;s been on this podcast</p>
<p>and is of optogenetics fame and psychiatry fame, et cetera.</p>
<p>I know him.</p>
<p>He sends his regards.</p>
<p>He told me that his practice for writing</p>
<p>and for thinking involves a quite painful process</p>
<p>of forcing himself to sit completely still</p>
<p>and think in complete sentences,</p>
<p>to force thinking in complete sentences.</p>
<p>And when he told me that, I decided to try this exercise</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite difficult.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s difficult for the reason</p>
<p>that you mentioned, which is that with many thoughts,</p>
<p>I want to look around</p>
<p>and I start to gesticulate with my hands.</p>
<p>So there it is again, the connection between language</p>
<p>and hand movement, even if one isn&rsquo;t speaking.</p>
<p>And the other part that&rsquo;s challenging is,</p>
<p>I realized that while we write in complete sentences,</p>
<p>most of the time, we&rsquo;ll talk about how that&rsquo;s changing now</p>
<p>and texting, et cetera,</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t often think in complete sentences</p>
<p>and specifically in simple declarative sentences,</p>
<p>that a lot of our thoughts would be,</p>
<p>if they were written out onto a page,</p>
<p>would look pretty much like passive language</p>
<p>that a good copy editor or a good editor would say,</p>
<p>oh, like we need to cross this out,</p>
<p>make this simple and declarative.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m getting at here is,</p>
<p>what is the process of going from a thought to language</p>
<p>to written word?</p>
<p>And I also wanted to touch on handwritten versus typed,</p>
<p>but thought to language to written word,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>What do we know about the neural circuitry?</p>
<p>And I was going to ask, why is it so hard?</p>
<p>But now I want to ask, why is this even possible?</p>
<p>It seems like a very challenging</p>
<p>neural computational problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And coming from the linguistic world,</p>
<p>and even just the regular neurobiology world,</p>
<p>going back to something I said before,</p>
<p>about a separate language module in the brain,</p>
<p>there was this thought or hypothesis</p>
<p>that this language module</p>
<p>has all these complex algorithms to them,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re signaling to the speech circuit</p>
<p>how to produce the sounds,</p>
<p>the hand circuit how to write them or gesture,</p>
<p>the visual pathway on how to interpret them from reading,</p>
<p>and the auditory pathway for listening.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case, all right?</p>
<p>And that this thinking</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s this internal speech going on.</p>
<p>What I think is going on is,</p>
<p>to explain what you&rsquo;re asking,</p>
<p>is about that I&rsquo;m going to take it</p>
<p>from the perspective of reading something.</p>
<p>You read something on a paper,</p>
<p>the signal from the paper goes through your eyes,</p>
<p>it goes to the back of your brain</p>
<p>to your visual cortical regions, eventually,</p>
<p>and then you now got to interpret that signal</p>
<p>in your visual pathway of what you&rsquo;re reading.</p>
<p>How are you going to do that in terms of speech?</p>
<p>That visual signal then goes to your speech pathway</p>
<p>in the motor cortex in front here in Broca&rsquo;s area,</p>
<p>and you silently speak what you read in your brain</p>
<p>without moving your muscles.</p>
<p>And sometimes, actually, if you put electrodes,</p>
<p>EEG, EMG electrodes on your laryngeal muscles,</p>
<p>even on birds, you can do this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see activity there while reading</p>
<p>or trying to speak silently,</p>
<p>even though no sound&rsquo;s coming out.</p>
<p>And so your speech pathway</p>
<p>is now speaking what you&rsquo;re reading.</p>
<p>Now, to finish it off,</p>
<p>that signal is sent to your auditory pathway</p>
<p>so you can hear what you&rsquo;re speaking in your own head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And this is why it&rsquo;s complicated,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re using like three different pathways,</p>
<p>the visual, the speaking motor one,</p>
<p>and the auditory to read.</p>
<p>Oh, and then you got to write, right?</p>
<p>Okay, here comes the fourth one.</p>
<p>Now, the hand areas next to your speech pathway</p>
<p>has got to take that auditory signal</p>
<p>or even the adjacent motor signals for speaking</p>
<p>and translate it into a visual signal on paper.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re using at least four brain circuits,</p>
<p>which includes the speech production</p>
<p>and the speech perception pathways to write.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>And finally explains to me why,</p>
<p>so I was weaned teaching undergraduates,</p>
<p>graduate students and medical students,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve observed that when I&rsquo;m teaching,</p>
<p>I have to stop speaking</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m going to write something on the board.</p>
<p>I just have to stop all speaking completely.</p>
<p>Turns out this is an advantage to catch</p>
<p>because it allows me to catch my voice.</p>
<p>It allows me to slow down a bit,</p>
<p>breathe and inhale some oxygen and so on,</p>
<p>because I tend to speak quickly</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not writing something out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a break in the circuitry for me,</p>
<p>or at least they are distinct enough</p>
<p>that I have to stop and then write something.</p>
<p>Yes, that does imply competing brain circuits</p>
<p>for your conscious attention.</p>
<p>We have colleagues up at Columbia Med</p>
<p>who are known, at least in our circles,</p>
<p>for voice dictating their papers, not writing them out,</p>
<p>but just speaking into a voice recorder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written papers that way.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel quite as natural for me</p>
<p>as writing things out,</p>
<p>but not because I can go quickly</p>
<p>from thought to language to typing.</p>
<p>I type reasonably fast.</p>
<p>I can touch type now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I ever taught my,</p>
<p>I think I taught myself.</p>
<p>I never took a touch type course,</p>
<p>but it just sort of happened now.</p>
<p>My motor system seems to know where the keys are</p>
<p>with enough accuracy that it works.</p>
<p>This is remarkable to me that any of us can do this,</p>
<p>but when it comes to writing,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve found is that if my rate of thought</p>
<p>and my rate of writing are aligned nicely, things go well.</p>
<p>However, if I&rsquo;m thinking much faster than I can write,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And certainly if I&rsquo;m thinking more slowly</p>
<p>than I want to write, that&rsquo;s also a problem.</p>
<p>And the solution for me has been to write with a pen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in love with these,</p>
<p>and I have no relationship to the company,</p>
<p>at least not now, although if they want to come,</p>
<p>you know, if they want to work with us,</p>
<p>I love these Pilot V5, V7s,</p>
<p>because not necessarily because of the ink or the feel,</p>
<p>although I like that as well,</p>
<p>but because of the rate that it allows me to write.</p>
<p>They write very well slowly,</p>
<p>and they write very well quickly.</p>
<p>And so I have this theory supported only by my own ANIC data,</p>
<p>no peer-reviewed study,</p>
<p>that writing by hand is fundamentally different</p>
<p>than typing out information.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that this motor pathway for writing</p>
<p>is better or somehow different</p>
<p>than the motor pathway for typing?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know of any studies,</p>
<p>I have my own personal experience as well,</p>
<p>but trying to put this into the context,</p>
<p>if I had to, you know, design an experiment</p>
<p>to test the hypothesis here, you know,</p>
<p>to explain your experience and mine,</p>
<p>is that writing by hand, I would argue,</p>
<p>requires a different set of less skills</p>
<p>with the fingers than typing.</p>
<p>So you have to coordinate your fingers</p>
<p>more in opposite directions and so forth with typing,</p>
<p>but also writing by hand requires more arm movement.</p>
<p>And so therefore, I would argue that</p>
<p>the difficulty there could be in the types of muscles</p>
<p>and the fine motor control you need of those muscles,</p>
<p>along with speaking in your brain at the same time.</p>
<p>So basically I&rsquo;m coarse, I&rsquo;m a brute,</p>
<p>and so it makes sense that a more primitive</p>
<p>writing device would work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yes.</p>
<p>But let me add to this in terms of the,</p>
<p>in my own personal experience, right,</p>
<p>what I find is I can write something faster by hand</p>
<p>for a short period of time compared to typing.</p>
<p>And that is because I think I run out of the energy</p>
<p>in my arm movements faster than I run out of muscle energy</p>
<p>in my finger movements.</p>
<p>And I think it takes a longer time</p>
<p>for us to write words without fingers</p>
<p>because in terms of the speech.</p>
<p>So I think your writing, whether it&rsquo;s by hand or typing,</p>
<p>and your speech, they only will align very well</p>
<p>if you can type as fast as you can speak</p>
<p>or write as fast as you can speak in your head.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ve done, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>is created a bridge between thought and writing,</p>
<p>and that bridge is speech.</p>
<p>That bridge is speech, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re writing something out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re speaking it to yourself.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re speaking faster than you can type,</p>
<p>you got a problem.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I do a number of podcast episodes</p>
<p>that are not with guests, but solo episodes.</p>
<p>And as listeners know, these are very long episodes,</p>
<p>often two or more hours.</p>
<p>And we joke around the podcast studio</p>
<p>that I will get locked into a mode of speech</p>
<p>where some of it is more elaborative and anecdotal,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll punch out simple declarative sentences.</p>
<p>I find it very hard to switch from one module to the next.</p>
<p>The thing that I have done</p>
<p>in order to make that transition more fluid</p>
<p>and prep for those podcast episodes</p>
<p>is actually to read the lyrics of songs</p>
<p>and to sing them in my head</p>
<p>as a way of warming up my vocal cords.</p>
<p>But luckily for those around me,</p>
<p>when I do that, I&rsquo;m not actually singing out loud.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re telling me supports this idea</p>
<p>that even when we are imagining singing</p>
<p>or writing in our mind, we are exercising our vocal cords.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually getting little low potentials</p>
<p>of electrical currents reaching your muscles there,</p>
<p>which also means you&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>your speech brain circuits too,</p>
<p>without actually going with the flow of activity</p>
<p>in the muscles.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this idea of singing helps you as well.</p>
<p>Even with Parkinson&rsquo;s patients and so forth,</p>
<p>when they wanna say something,</p>
<p>singing or listening to music helps them move better.</p>
<p>And the idea there is that the brain circuits for singing,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say the function of the brain circuits for speech</p>
<p>being used for singing first is the more ancestral trait.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s easier to do things with singing</p>
<p>sometimes than it is with speaking.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Stutter is a particularly interesting case</p>
<p>and one that every once in a while,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get questions about this from our audience.</p>
<p>Stutter is complicated in a number of ways,</p>
<p>but culturally, in my understanding from these emails</p>
<p>that I receive is that stutter can often cause people</p>
<p>to hide and speak less because it can be embarrassing.</p>
<p>And we are often not patient with stutter.</p>
<p>We also have the assumption that if somebody&rsquo;s stuttering,</p>
<p>that their thinking is slow,</p>
<p>but it turns out there are many examples historically</p>
<p>of people who could not speak well,</p>
<p>but who were brilliant thinkers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how well they could write,</p>
<p>but they found other modes of communication.</p>
<p>I realize that you&rsquo;re not a speech pathologist</p>
<p>or therapist,</p>
<p>but what is the current neurobiological understanding</p>
<p>of stutter and what&rsquo;s being developed</p>
<p>in terms of treatments for stutter?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we actually accidentally came across stuttering</p>
<p>in songbirds and we&rsquo;ve published several papers on this</p>
<p>to try to figure out the neurobiological basis.</p>
<p>The first study we had was a brain area</p>
<p>called the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the striatum part of the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>involved in coordinating movements,</p>
<p>learning how to make movements.</p>
<p>When it was damaged in the speech-like pathway</p>
<p>in these birds,</p>
<p>what we found is that they started to stutter</p>
<p>as the brain region recovered.</p>
<p>And unlike humans,</p>
<p>they actually recovered after three or four months.</p>
<p>And why is that the case?</p>
<p>Because bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis</p>
<p>in a way that human or mammal brains don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it was the new neurons that were coming in</p>
<p>into the circuit,</p>
<p>but not quite with the right proper activity</p>
<p>was resulting in this stuttering in these birds.</p>
<p>And after it was repaired,</p>
<p>not exactly the old song came back after the repair,</p>
<p>but still it recovered a lot better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s now known,</p>
<p>they call this neurogenics stuttering in humans,</p>
<p>with damage to the basal ganglia</p>
<p>or some type of disruption to the basal ganglia</p>
<p>at a young age also causes stuttering in humans.</p>
<p>And even those who are born with stuttering,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often the basal ganglia that&rsquo;s disrupted</p>
<p>than some other brain circuit.</p>
<p>And we think the speech part of the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>Can adults who maintain a stutter from childhood</p>
<p>repair that stutter?</p>
<p>They can repair it with therapy,</p>
<p>with learning how to speak slower,</p>
<p>learning how to tap out a rhythm during&hellip;</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;m not a speech pathologist,</p>
<p>but I started reading this literature</p>
<p>and talking to others that,</p>
<p>colleagues who actually study stuttering.</p>
<p>So yes, there are ways to overcome the stuttering</p>
<p>through behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>And I think all of the tools out there</p>
<p>have something to do with sensory motor integration.</p>
<p>Controlling what you hear with what you output</p>
<p>in a thoughtful, controlled way helps reduce the stuttering.</p>
<p>There are a couple of examples from real life</p>
<p>that I want to touch on.</p>
<p>And one is somewhat facetious,</p>
<p>but now I realize is a serious neurobiological issue.</p>
<p>Serious meaning, I think, interesting,</p>
<p>which is that every once in a while,</p>
<p>I will have a conversation with somebody</p>
<p>who says the last word of the sentence along with me.</p>
<p>And it seems annoying in some instances,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing this is just a breakthrough</p>
<p>of the motor pattern,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re hearing what I&rsquo;m saying very well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to interpret this kindly</p>
<p>and think they&rsquo;re hearing what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally hearing it in their mind</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting that low level electrical activity</p>
<p>to their throat.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just joining me in the enunciation</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m saying, probably without realizing it.</p>
<p>Can we assume that that might be the case?</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>
<p>So the motor theory of speech perception,</p>
<p>where this idea originally came,</p>
<p>what you hear is going through your speech circuit</p>
<p>and then also activating those muscles slightly.</p>
<p>So yes, so one might argue,</p>
<p>okay, is that speech circuit now interpreting</p>
<p>what that person is speaking now you listening to me</p>
<p>and is going to finish it off</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s already going through their brain</p>
<p>and they can predict it.</p>
<p>That would be one theory.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the verdict out there is known,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>The other is synchronizing turn-taking</p>
<p>in the conversation,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re acknowledging that we understand each other</p>
<p>by finishing off what I say.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like a social bonding kind of thing.</p>
<p>The other could be, I want the person to shut out</p>
<p>so I can speak as well and take that turn.</p>
<p>And each pair of people have a rhythm to their conversation.</p>
<p>And if you have somebody who&rsquo;s over-talkative</p>
<p>versus under-talkative or vice versa,</p>
<p>that rhythm can be lost in them finishing ideas</p>
<p>and going back and forth.</p>
<p>But I think having something to do with turn-taking</p>
<p>as well makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I have a colleague at Stanford who says</p>
<p>that interruption is a sign of interest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that everyone agrees.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s highly contextual.</p>
<p>But there is this form of a verbal nod</p>
<p>of saying, mm-hmm, or things of that sort.</p>
<p>And there are many of these.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m often told by my audience</p>
<p>that I interrupt my guests and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Oftentimes I&rsquo;ll just get caught</p>
<p>in the natural flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve had pretty good turn-taking here, I hope.</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<p>I feel that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you feel that way,</p>
<p>because especially in the context</p>
<p>of a discussion about language, this seems important.</p>
<p>Texting is a very, very interesting evolution of language</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;ve told us is that we have a thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s translated into language.</p>
<p>It might not be complete sentences, but texting,</p>
<p>I have to imagine this is the first time in human evolution</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve written with our thumbs.</p>
<p>So it seems more primitive to me</p>
<p>than typing with fingers or writing with hands.</p>
<p>But hey, who am I to judge the evolution of our species</p>
<p>in one direction or the other?</p>
<p>But the shorthand, often grammatically deficient,</p>
<p>incomplete sentence form of texting</p>
<p>is an incredible thing to see.</p>
<p>Early in relationships, romantic relationships,</p>
<p>people will often evaluate the other&rsquo;s text</p>
<p>and their ability to use proper grammar</p>
<p>and spelling, et cetera.</p>
<p>This often quickly degrades.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an acceptance</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just trying to communicate through shorthand,</p>
<p>almost military-like shorthand,</p>
<p>but internally consistent between people,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no general consensus of what things mean,</p>
<p>but WTFs and OMGs and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>I wonder sometimes whether or not</p>
<p>we are getting less proficient at speech</p>
<p>because we are not required to write</p>
<p>and think in complete sentences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being judgmental here.</p>
<p>I see this in my colleagues.</p>
<p>I see this in myself.</p>
<p>This is not a judgment of the younger generation.</p>
<p>I also know that slang has existed for decades,</p>
<p>if not hundreds of years,</p>
<p>but I also know that I don&rsquo;t speak the same way</p>
<p>that I did when I was a teenager</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve suppressed a lot of that slang,</p>
<p>not because it&rsquo;s inappropriate or offensive,</p>
<p>although some of it was, frankly,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s out of context.</p>
<p>So what do you think is happening to language?</p>
<p>Are we getting better at speaking, worse at speaking?</p>
<p>And what do you think the role of things like texting</p>
<p>and tweeting and shorthand communication, hashtagging,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that doing to the way that our brains work?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that, well, one,</p>
<p>in terms of measuring your level</p>
<p>of sophistication intelligence and you say OMG, right?</p>
<p>I think that also could be a cultural thing</p>
<p>that, ah, you belong to the next generation,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re being cool if you&rsquo;re an older person</p>
<p>using OMG and other things</p>
<p>that the younger generation would use.</p>
<p>But if I really think about it clearly,</p>
<p>texting actually has allowed</p>
<p>for more rapid communication amongst people.</p>
<p>I think without the invention of the phone before then,</p>
<p>or texting back and forth,</p>
<p>you had to wait days for a letter to show up.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t call somebody on the phone and talk as well,</p>
<p>and so this rapid communication,</p>
<p>but in terms of the rapid communication of writing</p>
<p>in this case.</p>
<p>So I think actually it&rsquo;s more like a use it or lose it</p>
<p>kind of a thing with the brain.</p>
<p>The more you use a particular brain region or circuit,</p>
<p>the more enhanced, it&rsquo;s like a muscle.</p>
<p>The more you exercise it, the more healthier it is,</p>
<p>the bigger it becomes and the more space it takes</p>
<p>and the more you lose something else.</p>
<p>So I think texting is not decreasing</p>
<p>the speech prowess or the intellectual prowess of speech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s converting it and using it a lot in a different way.</p>
<p>In a way that may not be as rich in regular writing</p>
<p>because you can only communicate so much nuance</p>
<p>in short term writing.</p>
<p>But whatever is being done,</p>
<p>you got people texting hours and hours and hours</p>
<p>on the phone.</p>
<p>So whatever your thumb circuit</p>
<p>is going to get pretty big actually.</p>
<p>I do wonder whether,</p>
<p>many people have lost their jobs based on tweets.</p>
<p>The short latency between thought and action</p>
<p>and distribution of one&rsquo;s thoughts is incredible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not just talking about people</p>
<p>who apparently would have poor prefrontal top-down control.</p>
<p>This is geek speak, by the way,</p>
<p>for people that lack impulse control.</p>
<p>But high-level academics,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to point fingers at anyone,</p>
<p>but examples of where you see these tweets,</p>
<p>what were they thinking?</p>
<p>So presumably there&rsquo;s an optimal strategy</p>
<p>between the thought-speech motor pathway,</p>
<p>especially when the motor pathway engages communication</p>
<p>with hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>And retweets in particular,</p>
<p>and the cut-and-paste function and the screenshot function</p>
<p>are often the reason why speech propagates.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s a little eerie</p>
<p>just that the neural circuitry can do this</p>
<p>and that we are catching up</p>
<p>a little bit more slowly to the technology</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got these casualties of that mismatch.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good adjective to use,</p>
<p>the casualties of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Because yes, it is the case with texting,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re really losing there</p>
<p>is less so the ability to write,</p>
<p>but more the ability to interpret what is being written.</p>
<p>And you can over- or under-interpret something</p>
<p>that somebody means.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that,</p>
<p>if somebody&rsquo;s writing something very quick,</p>
<p>they could be writing instinctually,</p>
<p>more instinctually, their true meaning.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t have time to modify and color-code</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re trying to say.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they really feel,</p>
<p>as opposed to saying it in a more nuanced way.</p>
<p>So I think both sides of that casualty are present.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a downturn,</p>
<p>an unintended negative consequence of short-term,</p>
<p>I mean, short-word communication.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree that this whole phenomenon</p>
<p>could be netting people that normally</p>
<p>would only say these things out loud</p>
<p>once inside the door of their own home, or not at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting time that we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>vis-a-vis speech and language and motor patterns.</p>
<p>So part of the human evolution for language.</p>
<p>I think this is all part of our evolution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So for those of you thinking terrible thoughts,</p>
<p>please put them in the world and be a casualty.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are not,</p>
<p>please be very careful with how proficient</p>
<p>your thought-to-language-to-motor action goes.</p>
<p>Maybe the technology companies should install some buffers,</p>
<p>some AI-based buffers.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s taking some EEG signals from your brain</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re texting to say,</p>
<p>okay, this is not a great thought, slow down.</p>
<p>Right, or this doesn&rsquo;t reflect your best state.</p>
<p>That brings me to what was going to be</p>
<p>the next question anyway,</p>
<p>which is we are quickly moving toward a time</p>
<p>where there will be an even faster transition</p>
<p>from thought to speech to motor output,</p>
<p>and maybe won&rsquo;t require motor output.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to here is some of the incredible work</p>
<p>of our colleagues, Eddie Chang at UCSF</p>
<p>and others who are taking paralyzed human beings</p>
<p>and learning to translate the electrical signals</p>
<p>of neurons in various areas,</p>
<p>including speech and language areas,</p>
<p>to computer screens that type out</p>
<p>what these people are thinking.</p>
<p>In other words, paralyzed people can put their thoughts</p>
<p>into writing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty extreme and wonderful example</p>
<p>of recovery of function that is sure to continue to evolve.</p>
<p>But I think we are headed toward a time</p>
<p>not too long from now where my thoughts can be translated</p>
<p>into words on a page if I allow that to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, and Eddie Chang&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>which I admire quite a bit and cite in my papers,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s really one of those at the leading edge</p>
<p>of trying to understand within humans</p>
<p>the neurobiology of speech.</p>
<p>And he may not say it directly,</p>
<p>but I talked to him about this,</p>
<p>it supports this idea that the speech circuit</p>
<p>in the separate language module,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think that there&rsquo;s a separation there.</p>
<p>So with that knowledge, yes,</p>
<p>and putting electrodes in the human brain</p>
<p>and then translating those electrical signals</p>
<p>to speech currents, yeah,</p>
<p>we can start to tell what is that person thinking.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>What do you often think in terms of speech?</p>
<p>And without saying words.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a scary thought.</p>
<p>And now imagine if you can now translate those</p>
<p>into a signal that transmits something wirelessly</p>
<p>and someone from some distant part of the planet</p>
<p>is hearing your speech from a wireless signal</p>
<p>without you speaking.</p>
<p>So probably that won&rsquo;t be done in an ethical way,</p>
<p>who knows?</p>
<p>But I mean, the ethics of doing that</p>
<p>probably might not happen,</p>
<p>but who knows, we have these songbirds,</p>
<p>we apply the same technique to them,</p>
<p>we can start to hear what they&rsquo;re singing in their dreams</p>
<p>or whatever, even though they don&rsquo;t produce sound.</p>
<p>So we can find out by testing on them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming, one way or another, it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>For those listening who are interested</p>
<p>in getting better at speaking and understanding languages,</p>
<p>are there any tools that you recommend?</p>
<p>And here again, I realize you&rsquo;re not a speech therapist,</p>
<p>but here I&rsquo;m not thinking about ameliorating</p>
<p>any kind of speech deficiency.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking, for instance,</p>
<p>do you recommend that people read different types of writing?</p>
<p>Would you recommend that people learn how to dance</p>
<p>in order to become better at expressing themselves verbally?</p>
<p>You know, and feel free to have some degrees of freedom</p>
<p>in this answer.</p>
<p>These are obviously not peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re referring to, although there may be,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m struck by the number of things</p>
<p>that you do exceedingly well.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t help but ask, well, the singing,</p>
<p>which I realize it may,</p>
<p>your brother didn&rsquo;t pay me to say this,</p>
<p>may not be quite as good as your brother&rsquo;s yet,</p>
<p>but is getting, you&rsquo;ll surpass him, I&rsquo;m guessing,</p>
<p>at some point.</p>
<p>Getting there.</p>
<p>Getting there.</p>
<p>Exactly, there you go.</p>
<p>You know, should kids learn how to dance</p>
<p>and read hard books and simple books?</p>
<p>What do you recommend?</p>
<p>Should adults learn how to do that?</p>
<p>Everyone wants to know how to keep their brain</p>
<p>working better, so to speak,</p>
<p>but also I think people want to be able to speak well</p>
<p>and people want to be able to understand well.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what I&rsquo;ve discovered personally, right,</p>
<p>is that, so when I switched from pursuing a career</p>
<p>in science from a career in dance,</p>
<p>I thought one day I would stop dancing.</p>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t, because I find it fulfilling for me,</p>
<p>just as a life experience.</p>
<p>So ever since I started college,</p>
<p>my late teens and early 20s,</p>
<p>I kept dancing even till this day.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been periods of time,</p>
<p>like during the pandemic,</p>
<p>where I slowed down on dancing and so forth.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you realize, okay,</p>
<p>there are parts of your body where your muscle tone</p>
<p>decreases a little bit and somewhat,</p>
<p>or you could start to gain weight,</p>
<p>or I somehow don&rsquo;t gain weight that easily.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s related to my dance,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s meaningful to your audience.</p>
<p>But what I found is, in science,</p>
<p>we like to think of a separation between movement</p>
<p>and action and cognition.</p>
<p>And there is a separation for you</p>
<p>between perception and production,</p>
<p>cognition being perception,</p>
<p>production being movement, right?</p>
<p>But if the speech pathways</p>
<p>is next to the movement pathways,</p>
<p>what I discover is, by dancing,</p>
<p>it is helping me think.</p>
<p>It is helping keeping my brain fresh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just moving my muscles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving, or using the circuitry in my brain</p>
<p>to control a whole big body.</p>
<p>You need a lot of brain tissue to do that.</p>
<p>And so I argue, if you want to stay</p>
<p>cognitively intact into your old age,</p>
<p>you better be moving.</p>
<p>And you better be doing it consistently,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s dancing, walking, running,</p>
<p>and also practicing speech,</p>
<p>oratory speech and so forth, or singing,</p>
<p>is controlling the brain circuits</p>
<p>that are moving your facial musculature.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to keep your cognitive circuits also in tune.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m convinced of that from my own personal experience.</p>
<p>For me, long, slow runs are a wonderful way</p>
<p>to kind of loosen the joints for long podcasts,</p>
<p>especially the solo podcasts,</p>
<p>which can take many hours to record.</p>
<p>And without those long, slow runs,</p>
<p>at least the day before, or even the morning of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could do it, at least not as well.</p>
<p>All right, well, you&rsquo;re experiencing something similar.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an N of two.</p>
<p>Yeah, N of two.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to learn how to dance,</p>
<p>because there are a lot of reasons to learn how to dance.</p>
<p>People can use their imagination.</p>
<p>I definitely want to get the opportunity</p>
<p>to talk about some of the newer work</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re into right now about genomes of animals.</p>
<p>As you perhaps can tell</p>
<p>from my quite authentic facial expressions,</p>
<p>I adore the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>I just find it amazing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the reason I went into neurobiology, in part.</p>
<p>So many animals, so many different patterns of movement,</p>
<p>so many body plans, so many specializations.</p>
<p>What is the value of learning the genomes</p>
<p>of all these animals?</p>
<p>You know, I can think of conservation-based schemes</p>
<p>of trying to preserve these precious critters.</p>
<p>But what are you doing with the genomes of these animals?</p>
<p>What do you want to understand about their brain circuits?</p>
<p>And how does this relate to some of the discussion</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been having up until now?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve gotten very heavily involved in genomes,</p>
<p>not just to get at an individual gene involved</p>
<p>in the trait of interest, like spoken language,</p>
<p>but I realized that, you know,</p>
<p>nature has done natural experiments for us.</p>
<p>With all these species out there with these various traits,</p>
<p>and the one that I&rsquo;m studying, like focal learning,</p>
<p>has evolved multiple times among the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s rare, it&rsquo;s multiple times.</p>
<p>And the similar genetic changes occurred in those species.</p>
<p>But to find out what those genetic changes</p>
<p>that are associated with the trait of interest,</p>
<p>not some other trait like flying and birds,</p>
<p>as opposed to singing,</p>
<p>you have to do what&rsquo;s called comparative genomics,</p>
<p>even in the context of studying the brain.</p>
<p>And you need their genomes to compare the genomes</p>
<p>and do like a GWAS, a genome-wide association study,</p>
<p>not just within a species like humans, but across species.</p>
<p>And so you need good genomes to do that.</p>
<p>Plus, I&rsquo;ve discovered I&rsquo;m also interested</p>
<p>in evolution and origins.</p>
<p>How did these species come about a similar trait</p>
<p>in the last, you know, 300 million years</p>
<p>or 60 million years, depending who you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And you need a good phylogenetic tree to do that.</p>
<p>And to get a good phylogenetic tree,</p>
<p>you also need their genomes.</p>
<p>And so because of this,</p>
<p>I got involved in large-scale consortiums</p>
<p>to produce genomes of many different species,</p>
<p>including my vocal learners</p>
<p>and their closest relatives that I&rsquo;m fans of.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t convince the funding agencies</p>
<p>to give me the money to do that just for my own project.</p>
<p>But when you get a whole bunch of people together</p>
<p>who want to study various traits, you know, heart disease</p>
<p>or loss and gain of flight and so forth,</p>
<p>suddenly we all need lots of genomes to do this.</p>
<p>And so now that got me into a project</p>
<p>to lead something called the Vertebrate Genomes Project</p>
<p>to eventually sequence all 70,000 species on the planet.</p>
<p>And Earth Biogenome Project,</p>
<p>all eukaryotic species, all 2 million of them.</p>
<p>And to no longer be in a situation</p>
<p>where I wish I had this genome.</p>
<p>Now we have the genetic code of all life on the planet,</p>
<p>create a database of all their traits</p>
<p>and find the genetic association with everything out there</p>
<p>that makes a difference from one species to another.</p>
<p>One more piece of the equation to add to this story</p>
<p>is what I didn&rsquo;t realize as a neuroscientist</p>
<p>were that these genomes are not only incomplete,</p>
<p>but there have lots of errors in them.</p>
<p>False gene duplications where mother and father chromosomes</p>
<p>were so different from each other</p>
<p>that the genome algorithm, assembly algorithms</p>
<p>treated them as two different genes</p>
<p>in this part of the chromosome.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of these false duplicated genes</p>
<p>that people thought were real, but were not.</p>
<p>Or missing parts of the genome</p>
<p>because the enzymes used to sequence the DNA</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get through this regulatory region</p>
<p>that folded up on itself and made it hard to sequence.</p>
<p>And so I ended up in these consortiums</p>
<p>pulling in the genome sequencing companies</p>
<p>developing the technology to work with us</p>
<p>to improve it further.</p>
<p>And the computer science guys</p>
<p>who then take that data and that technology</p>
<p>and try to make the complete genomes</p>
<p>and make the algorithms better to produce</p>
<p>what we now just did recently</p>
<p>and led by an effort by Ed and Philippe</p>
<p>is the first human telomere-to-telomere genome</p>
<p>with no errors, all complete, no missing sequence.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re trying to do the same thing</p>
<p>with vertebrates and other species.</p>
<p>Actually, we improved that before we got to</p>
<p>what we call telomere-to-telomere</p>
<p>from one end of the chromosome to another.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re discovering</p>
<p>is in this dark matter of the genome</p>
<p>that was missing before</p>
<p>turns out to be some regulatory regions</p>
<p>that are specialized in vocal learning species</p>
<p>and we think are involved in developing speech circuits.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Well, so much to learn</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re going to learn from this information.</p>
<p>Early on in these genome projects and connectome projects,</p>
<p>I confess I was a little bit cynical.</p>
<p>This would be about 10, 15 years ago.</p>
<p>I thought, okay, necessary, but not sufficient for anything.</p>
<p>We need it, but it&rsquo;s not clear what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>But you just gave a very clear example</p>
<p>of what we stand to learn from this kind of information.</p>
<p>And I know from the conservation side,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge interest in this</p>
<p>because even though we would prefer</p>
<p>to keep all these species alive rather than clone them,</p>
<p>these sorts of projects do offer the possibility</p>
<p>of potentially recreating species that were lost</p>
<p>due to our own ignorance or missteps or what have you.</p>
<p>Yes, and along those lines,</p>
<p>because we got involved in genomics,</p>
<p>some of the first species that we start working on</p>
<p>are critically endangered species.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m doing that not only for perspectives</p>
<p>to understand their brains</p>
<p>and the genes involved in their brain function,</p>
<p>but I feel like it&rsquo;s a moral duty.</p>
<p>So the fact that now I&rsquo;ve become more involved</p>
<p>in genome biology and have helped develop these tools</p>
<p>for more complete genomes,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s capture their genetic code now before they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>And could we use that information</p>
<p>to resurrect the species at some future time,</p>
<p>if not in my lifetime,</p>
<p>in some time in the future and generations ahead of us.</p>
<p>And so in anticipation of that,</p>
<p>we create a database we call the Genome Arc,</p>
<p>and no pun intended, like Noah&rsquo;s Ark,</p>
<p>meant to store the genetic code</p>
<p>as complete genome assemblies as possible</p>
<p>for all species on the planet</p>
<p>to be used for basic science,</p>
<p>but also some point in the future.</p>
<p>And because of that,</p>
<p>funding agencies or private foundations</p>
<p>that are interested in conservation</p>
<p>have been reaching out to me now, a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>to help them out in producing high-quality genome data</p>
<p>of endangered species that they can use,</p>
<p>like Revive and Restore,</p>
<p>who want to resurrect the passenger pigeon,</p>
<p>or Colossal, who wants to resurrect the woolly mammoth.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re producing high-quality genomes</p>
<p>for these groups for their conservation projects.</p>
<p>What a terrific and important initiative.</p>
<p>And I think for those listening today,</p>
<p>they now certainly understand the value</p>
<p>of deeply understanding the brain structures</p>
<p>and genomes of different species,</p>
<p>because I confess,</p>
<p>even though I knew a bit of the songbird literature,</p>
<p>and I certainly understand</p>
<p>that humans have speech and language,</p>
<p>I had no idea that there was so much convergence</p>
<p>of function, structure, and genomes.</p>
<p>And to me, I feel a lot more like an ape</p>
<p>than I do a songbird.</p>
<p>And yet here we are with the understanding</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot more similarity</p>
<p>between songbirds and humans</p>
<p>than I certainly ever thought before.</p>
<p>Yeah, something very close to home for us humans,</p>
<p>I can give you an example of,</p>
<p>is evolution of skin color.</p>
<p>In skin color, we use it, unfortunately,</p>
<p>for racism and so forth.</p>
<p>We use it also for good things,</p>
<p>to let in more light or let out less light,</p>
<p>depending on the part of the planet, you know,</p>
<p>our population evolved in.</p>
<p>And most people think dark-skinned people all evolved</p>
<p>from the same dark-skinned person,</p>
<p>and light-skinned people all evolved</p>
<p>from the same light-skinned person,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>Dark skin and light skin amongst humans</p>
<p>has evolved independently multiple times,</p>
<p>like in, you know, the Pacific Islands versus Africa.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just depending on the angle of light</p>
<p>hitting the earth,</p>
<p>as to whether you need more protection from the sun</p>
<p>or less protection,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also associated with vitamin D synthesis in the skin.</p>
<p>And so, and each time,</p>
<p>where a darker or lighter skin evolved independently,</p>
<p>it hit the same gene, you know,</p>
<p>the melatonin.</p>
<p>Melanin.</p>
<p>Melanin receptors, that&rsquo;s right, yes, yeah.</p>
<p>Genes that are involved in melanin formation.</p>
<p>And so, those genes evolve some of the same mutations,</p>
<p>even in different species.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just humans.</p>
<p>In equatorial regions,</p>
<p>there are darker-skinned animals</p>
<p>than going away from the equator.</p>
<p>All right, I think of Arctic foxes and things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, right.</p>
<p>Polar bears, you know.</p>
<p>And so, some of the same genes are used</p>
<p>in an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p>to evolve in a similar way within and across species.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same thing happening in the brain too.</p>
<p>Language is no exception.</p>
<p>Well, I have to say,</p>
<p>as somebody who is a, you know, career neuroscientist,</p>
<p>but as I mentioned several times now,</p>
<p>who also adores the animal kingdom,</p>
<p>but is also obsessed with speech and language,</p>
<p>and at a distance,</p>
<p>not as a practitioner of music and dance,</p>
<p>this has been an incredible conversation</p>
<p>and opportunity for me to learn.</p>
<p>I know I speak for a tremendous number of people,</p>
<p>and I just really want to say thank you</p>
<p>for joining us today.</p>
<p>You are incredibly busy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear from your description of your science</p>
<p>and your knowledge base</p>
<p>that you are involved in a huge number of things.</p>
<p>Very busy.</p>
<p>So thank you for taking the time to speak to all of us.</p>
<p>Thank you for the work that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>both on speech and language,</p>
<p>but also this important work on genomes</p>
<p>and conservation of endangered species and far more.</p>
<p>And I have to say,</p>
<p>if you would agree to come back</p>
<p>and speak to us again sometime,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that if we were to sit down</p>
<p>even six months or a year from now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a lot more to come.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have some things cooking.</p>
<p>And thank you for inviting me here</p>
<p>to get the word out to the community</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in the science world.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re honored and very grateful to you, Eric.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>for my discussion with Dr. Eric Jarvis.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about his laboratory&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>you can go to JarvisLab, spelled J-A-R-V-I-S,</p>
<p>lab, all one word, JarvisLab.net.</p>
<p>And there you can learn about all the various studies</p>
<p>taking place in his laboratory,</p>
<p>as well as some of the larger overarching themes</p>
<p>that are driving those studies,</p>
<p>including studies on human genomics and animal genomics</p>
<p>that surely are going to lead to the next stage discoveries</p>
<p>of how we learn and think about and indeed use language.</p>

<p>So these are brief clips,</p>
<p>anywhere from three to 10 minutes,</p>
<p>that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols</p>
<p>related to sleep, to focus, interviews with various guests.</p>
<p>We talk about things like caffeine,</p>
<p>when to drink caffeine relative to sleep,</p>
<p>alcohol, when and how and if anyone should ingest it</p>
<p>relative to sleep, dopamine, serotonin,</p>
<p>mental health, physical health, and on and on.</p>
<p>All the things that relate to the topics</p>
<p>most of interest to you.</p>
<p>You can find that easily by going to YouTube,</p>
<p>look for Huberman Lab clips in the search area,</p>
<p>and it will take you there.</p>
<p>And we are constantly updating those with new clips.</p>
<p>This is especially useful, I believe,</p>
<p>for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re still working through the back catalog</p>
<p>of Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>which admittedly can be rather long.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
