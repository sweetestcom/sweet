middle of night with your heart racing what could that be well the first thing you want to do is differentiate between is your heart rate really increasing or do you have palpitations because they can feel very similar and so ideally you&amp;rsquo;d want to check your pulse to see if your pulse rate is higher tachycardia is a medical name for a high pulse rate over 100 beats per minute the normal beats per minute should be around 72 but it could be actually a lot lower if you&amp;rsquo;re in shape or it could be slightly higher or palpitation is a little bit different it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a sustained high pulse rate it the heart is flipping or flopping or speeding up temporarily or slowing down temporarily but i do have videos on palpitation slightly different than this i put a link down below but we want to talk about if you&amp;rsquo;re all of a sudden waking up in the middle of night with a high pulse rate what&amp;rsquo;s going on let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at all the potential causes of tachycardia well alcohol will do it too much sugar will do it because sugar depletes potassium potassium is kind of like a governor or a regulator of your pulse rate and so without potassium you don&amp;rsquo;t have the brakes in the car so it&amp;rsquo;s all accelerators so the pulse rate will go up in fact i remember right before i got married we were living in san diego and we were going around trying to find the best wedding cake and so we were going to different places sampling wedding cakes and then we ended up at an italian restaurant and had pizza and pasta and wine and right before they&amp;rsquo;re closing i realized we were the last people left and so the waiter said would you like to sample some of these these desserts before we toss them out and of course i don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste any food so we sampled everything and so i was driving home that night with a tremendous amount of carbohydrates flowing through my bloodstream and right when i went to bed i noticed this large pounding in my ear it&amp;rsquo;s like boom boom boom boom my pulse rate was not only accelerated but it was loud what was happening in my blood was all this sugar was depleting the potassium that i had and so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing left to keep the pulse rate under control so too much sugar will deplete potassium and your pulse rate will go up and you will not be able to sleep also just having low potassium in general can increase the pulse rate low magnesium can increase the pulse rate and if you are b1 deficient which by the way is very very common your pulse rate will be a little bit too high so you&amp;rsquo;d want to take some nutritional yeast to get that b1 and your pulse rate should come down stimulants like caffeine from coffee also chocolate and tea will keep the pulse rate too high an overactive thyroid will keep your pulse rate high i did a video on this and one of the remedies is actually taking b1 anemia can keep your pulse rate high so that would be a lack of b12 or a lack of iron number nine this is called this autonomium this is a dysfunctional autonomic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system controls the pulse rate your heart rate and a lot of other things and too much stress will cause dysfunction of your autonomic nervous system the best remedy for that would be right here b1 another symptom of dysautonomia would be if you were to stand up too quickly and feel a little dizzy or disoriented all right number 10 excessive amount of exercise this happened to me when i worked out twice in a given day and i just got my pulse rate up too high and it just did not come down too well so if your recovery is low or you overdo it your pulse rate could be too high being too acid here&amp;rsquo;s another example one day i drink some kombucha tea i didn&amp;rsquo;t just drink a little bit hydrate the whole bottle which actually switched my ph to being slightly too acidic and my pulse rate was just way too high and i couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep that night so too much acid will increase your pulse rate and it affects your breathing as well all right number 12 if your blood sugars are too high or too low your pulse rate can go too high and so if you have any of these obviously it&amp;rsquo;s pretty self-explanatory what you need to do there are some other things you can do if you catch yourself in the middle of night with your pulse rate high and you need to go back to sleep this is what i would recommend there&amp;rsquo;s a simple breathing exercise where you just control your breathing in and out very slowly at a count of four to five seconds in and four to five seconds out and so as you&amp;rsquo;re controlling your breath slowly in and slowly out that will actually start to affect your autonomic nervous system and your pulse rate should come down so it&amp;rsquo;s something that you can do to help you control the heart all right number two celery maybe you need to get out of bed and just consume some celery celery has all sorts of great wonderful things vital nutrients certain types of certain types of minerals that are really calming to the nervous system as well as the blood pressure and i think the number one cause of a higher pulse rate especially something that&amp;rsquo;s waking you up out of bed would be that your carbs are just too high so you want to go low carb and you want to go no sugar now when you initially get on a ketogenic plan you may find your pulse rate goes up when you&amp;rsquo;re in this transition phase for about three days but if you just take potassium and a good electrolyte powder and you take uh vitamin b1 through nutritional yeast that should pretty much prevent that from happening so stress can actually raise your pulse rate so during the day you want to do long walks to keep the stress off your body as much as possible i do walking every single day i think yesterday i walked for an hour it&amp;rsquo;s very therapeutic get in nature and just do the walks that&amp;rsquo;s very good for the heart and the last thing is to avoid emf i will be doing more videos on this but these are certain frequencies or energies that emanate from your cell phone electrical wires so if you&amp;rsquo;re sleeping and your cell phone or ipad is right next to you right by your head or you have a lot of electrical devices plugged in unplug them before you go to bed put your cell phone on airplane mode and you&amp;rsquo;re going to find that you&amp;rsquo;ll have less emf what you have to realize is these frequencies have a serious influence over your own frequencies you have a lot of electrical things going on in the heart and different fields of energy and so you want to keep these to a minimum all right guys there we have it now you know exactly what to do before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&amp;rsquo;s call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help"><title>Wake Up with a Racing Heart？ ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

heart racing what could that be well the first  </p><p>thing you want to do is differentiate between is 
your heart rate really increasing or do you have  </p><p>palpitations because they can feel very similar 
and so ideally you&rsquo;d want to check your pulse  </p><p>to see if your pulse rate is higher tachycardia 
is a medical name for a high pulse rate over 100  </p><p>beats per minute the normal beats per minute 
should be around 72 but it could be actually  </p><p>a lot lower if you&rsquo;re in shape or it could be 
slightly higher or palpitation is a little bit  </p><p>different it&rsquo;s not necessarily a sustained high 
pulse rate it the heart is flipping or flopping  </p><p>or speeding up temporarily or slowing 
down temporarily but i do have videos  </p><p>on palpitation slightly different than this i 
put a link down below but we want to talk about  </p><p>if you&rsquo;re all of a sudden waking up in the middle 
of night with a high pulse rate what&rsquo;s going on  </p><p>let&rsquo;s take a look at all the potential causes of 
tachycardia well alcohol will do it too much sugar  </p><p>will do it because sugar depletes potassium 
potassium is kind of like a governor or a  </p><p>regulator of your pulse rate and so without 
potassium you don&rsquo;t have the brakes in the car  </p><p>so it&rsquo;s all accelerators so the pulse rate will go 
up in fact i remember right before i got married  </p><p>we were living in san diego and we were going 
around trying to find the best wedding cake  </p><p>and so we were going to different places sampling 
wedding cakes and then we ended up at an italian  </p><p>restaurant and had pizza and pasta and wine 
and right before they&rsquo;re closing i realized  </p><p>we were the last people left and so the waiter 
said would you like to sample some of these  </p><p>these desserts before we toss them out and of 
course i don&rsquo;t want to waste any food so we  </p><p>sampled everything and so i was driving home that 
night with a tremendous amount of carbohydrates  </p><p>flowing through my bloodstream and right when i 
went to bed i noticed this large pounding in my  </p><p>ear it&rsquo;s like boom boom boom boom my pulse rate 
was not only accelerated but it was loud what  </p><p>was happening in my blood was all this sugar was 
depleting the potassium that i had and so there&rsquo;s  </p><p>nothing left to keep the pulse rate under control 
so too much sugar will deplete potassium and your  </p><p>pulse rate will go up and you will not be able to 
sleep also just having low potassium in general  </p><p>can increase the pulse rate low magnesium 
can increase the pulse rate and if you are b1  </p><p>deficient which by the way is very very common 
your pulse rate will be a little bit too high  </p><p>so you&rsquo;d want to take some nutritional yeast to 
get that b1 and your pulse rate should come down  </p><p>stimulants like caffeine from coffee also 
chocolate and tea will keep the pulse rate  </p><p>too high an overactive thyroid will keep your 
pulse rate high i did a video on this and one  </p><p>of the remedies is actually taking b1 
anemia can keep your pulse rate high  </p><p>so that would be a lack of b12 or a lack of iron 
number nine this is called this autonomium this  </p><p>is a dysfunctional autonomic nervous system 
and the autonomic nervous system controls  </p><p>the pulse rate your heart rate and a lot of other 
things and too much stress will cause dysfunction  </p><p>of your autonomic nervous system the best remedy 
for that would be right here b1 another symptom  </p><p>of dysautonomia would be if you were to stand up 
too quickly and feel a little dizzy or disoriented  </p><p>all right number 10 excessive amount of exercise 
this happened to me when i worked out twice in a  </p><p>given day and i just got my pulse rate up too 
high and it just did not come down too well  </p><p>so if your recovery is low or you overdo it 
your pulse rate could be too high being too acid  </p><p>here&rsquo;s another example one day i drink some 
kombucha tea i didn&rsquo;t just drink a little bit  </p><p>hydrate the whole bottle which actually switched 
my ph to being slightly too acidic and my pulse  </p><p>rate was just way too high and i couldn&rsquo;t sleep 
that night so too much acid will increase your  </p><p>pulse rate and it affects your breathing as well 
all right number 12 if your blood sugars are too  </p><p>high or too low your pulse rate can go too high 
and so if you have any of these obviously it&rsquo;s  </p><p>pretty self-explanatory what you need to do 
there are some other things you can do if you  </p><p>catch yourself in the middle of night with your 
pulse rate high and you need to go back to sleep  </p><p>this is what i would recommend there&rsquo;s a simple 
breathing exercise where you just control your  </p><p>breathing in and out very slowly at a count of 
four to five seconds in and four to five seconds  </p><p>out and so as you&rsquo;re controlling your breath 
slowly in and slowly out that will actually  </p><p>start to affect your autonomic nervous system and 
your pulse rate should come down so it&rsquo;s something  </p><p>that you can do to help you control the heart all 
right number two celery maybe you need to get out  </p><p>of bed and just consume some celery celery has all 
sorts of great wonderful things vital nutrients  </p><p>certain types of certain types of minerals that 
are really calming to the nervous system as well  </p><p>as the blood pressure and i think the number one 
cause of a higher pulse rate especially something  </p><p>that&rsquo;s waking you up out of bed would be that your 
carbs are just too high so you want to go low carb  </p><p>and you want to go no sugar now when you initially 
get on a ketogenic plan you may find your pulse  </p><p>rate goes up when you&rsquo;re in this transition 
phase for about three days but if you just  </p><p>take potassium and a good electrolyte powder and 
you take uh vitamin b1 through nutritional yeast  </p><p>that should pretty much prevent that 
from happening so stress can actually  </p><p>raise your pulse rate so during the day you 
want to do long walks to keep the stress  </p><p>off your body as much as possible i do walking 
every single day i think yesterday i walked for  </p><p>an hour it&rsquo;s very therapeutic get in nature and 
just do the walks that&rsquo;s very good for the heart  </p><p>and the last thing is to avoid emf i will be 
doing more videos on this but these are certain  </p><p>frequencies or energies that emanate from your 
cell phone electrical wires so if you&rsquo;re sleeping  </p><p>and your cell phone or ipad is right next to 
you right by your head or you have a lot of  </p><p>electrical devices plugged in unplug them before 
you go to bed put your cell phone on airplane mode  </p><p>and you&rsquo;re going to find that you&rsquo;ll have less emf 
what you have to realize is these frequencies have  </p><p>a serious influence over your own frequencies you 
have a lot of electrical things going on in the  </p><p>heart and different fields of energy and so you 
want to keep these to a minimum all right guys  </p><p>there we have it now you know exactly what to 
do before you go if you have a question about  </p><p>a product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to 
know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and you  </p><p>need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth i 
have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p><p>this is just for the people in the us hopefully in 
the future we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
