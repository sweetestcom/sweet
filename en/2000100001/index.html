<p>I think I can help people
if I get my hands a little bit dirtier.</p>
<p>Sounds so unethical.</p>
<p>Your husband is emotionally abusive.
Leave him.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>-I&rsquo;m worried about you, kid.
-[Jimmy] I&rsquo;ve been grieving her.</p>
<p>[crying]</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been numbing.</p>
<p>[Paul] You gonna let your grief drown you,</p>
<p>or are you gonna face it
and come through the other side?</p>
<p>-Coin flip?
-Get out of here.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>[Gomez groans, inhales]</p>
<p>[friend] How are you feeling?</p>
<p>[Gomez] I&rsquo;m very tired.</p>
<p>[friend]
Do you want to do your morning meds?</p>
<p>[Gomez] Mmm.</p>
<p>[friend]
I know the answer, but‚Ä¶ you should.</p>
<p>-[camera shutters clicking]
-[paparazzi chatter] Morning, Selena.</p>
<p>[Gomez] Let me make a promise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll only tell you my darkest secrets.</p>
<p>December 19.</p>
<p>I have to stop living like this.</p>
<p>Why have I become so far from the light?</p>
<p>Everything I ever wished for,
I&rsquo;ve had and done all of it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>but it has killed me.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s always Selena.</p>
<p>-[reporters shouting] Selena!
-[fans cheering]</p>
<p>[crowd screaming]</p>
<p>[TV reporter 1] Selena Gomez,
the lead single, &ldquo;Good For You,&rdquo;</p>
<p>was a critical and commercial success.</p>
<p>[TV reporter 2] ‚Ä¶recently dubbed
the queen of the social networking app.</p>
<p>Hello, Howard.</p>
<p>[TV reporter 3]
Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber</p>
<p>-have finally called it quits.
-[TV reporter 4] Again?</p>
<p>Really? I don&rsquo;t feel like a rock star.</p>
<p>-[Jimmy Fallon] And this album, Revival‚Ä¶
-[audience cheering]</p>
<p>‚Ä¶people are saying that it&ndash;
it&rsquo;s going to be number one,</p>
<p>and the tour starts up soon, right?
In May?</p>
<p>[Gomez] I&rsquo;ll be touring in May.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m actually at the LA Sports Arena.</p>
<p>Um, we have two days
till I leave and the tour starts.</p>
<p>I have my hair and makeup team with me,
so we&rsquo;re trying new things every day.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing tests and figuring out
what&ndash; You know,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to do for the show.
The identity of the show.</p>
<p>-[Gomez] Do we like this?
-[chattering]</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause you see through the mirror
with the white?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just the sequins. [chuckles]</p>
<p>Let me take&ndash; I&rsquo;ll take
a little bit from the center. Right.</p>
<p>They even have those little vagina things?</p>
<p>-[stylist 1] Okay. Yeah.
-Maybe those flattened ones.</p>
<p>-I don&rsquo;t know. Just got weird.
-[stylist chuckles]</p>
<p>If I was a guy, I could wear jeans
and just switch up my T-shirt</p>
<p>-and put a beanie on‚Ä¶
-[laughing]</p>
<p>-‚Ä¶and nobody would care.
-[dress zipping]</p>
<p>Actually, I think the breasts are good.</p>
<p>-I don&rsquo;t know.
-[designer] You like it?</p>
<p>-I do need a little breast.
-So formal, &ldquo;the breasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Gomez] It&rsquo;s my vagina‚Ä¶</p>
<p>-[stylist 1] No, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s just&ndash;
-‚Ä¶in every freaking costume.</p>
<p>-It&rsquo;s not you‚Ä¶
-It&rsquo;s&ndash;</p>
<p>-‚Ä¶I&rsquo;m just making fun of myself.
-[stylist 2] Wait. Come and look here.</p>
<p>-[stylist 3] It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s my vagina.
-Literally. It&rsquo;s my vagina.</p>
<p>I wanna have the body to wear it proudly,
and I want the booty that I don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>-My body&rsquo;s very young.
-[fashion team member] Yeah.</p>
<p>-I don&rsquo;t wanna be like, &ldquo;Oh, wait.&rdquo;
-[crew chattering]</p>
<p>Making sure I look like a woman
and not like a twelve-year-old boy.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Who Says&rdquo; playing on piano]</p>
<p>‚ô™ I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna be anybody else ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Yeah ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ You made me insecure ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Told me I wasn&rsquo;t good enough ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ But who are you to judge
When you&rsquo;re a diamond in the rough? ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m sure you got some things
You&rsquo;d like to change about yourself ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ But when it comes to me
I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna be anybody else ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na,
Na-na-na-na-na ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na,
Na-na-na-na-na ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m no beauty queen,
I&rsquo;m just beautiful me ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

<p>‚ô™ And you&rsquo;ve got every right
To a beautiful life ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Come on
Who says? ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Who says you&rsquo;re not perfect?
Who says you&rsquo;re not worth it? ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Who says
You&rsquo;re the only one that&rsquo;s hurtin&rsquo;? ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Trust me
That&rsquo;s the price of beauty ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Who says you&rsquo;re not pretty? ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Who says you&rsquo;re not beautiful? ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Who says? ‚ô™</p>
<p>[vocalizes]</p>
<p>‚ô™ The dress is too long ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ And I hate how it opens up ‚ô™</p>
<p>It just sucks.</p>
<p>-[friend 1] What&rsquo;s wrong?
-All of it. It looks so bad.</p>
<p>[Gomez sobs] I&rsquo;m just like&ndash;</p>
<p>I have no idea
what the fuck I&rsquo;m doing. [sniffles]</p>
<p>-[friend 2] What part did you feel that?
-Uh, from the beginning. [sniffles]</p>
<p>So I get the voice that comes in my head
that says that you missed this.</p>
<p>That sucked. That suck.</p>
<p>Oh, you get a glimpse of yourself
on the screen.</p>
<p>Wow, that looks pretty fucking shitty.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m sitting there
and I trip over the co&ndash; clothes</p>
<p>and, like, this is just&ndash;</p>
<p>-Like, it sucks the life out of me‚Ä¶
-[friend 2] Yeah.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶and I don&rsquo;t want to perform. [sniffles]</p>
<p>The pressure is just overwhelming
because I wanna do the best I can</p>
<p>and I&ndash; and I&rsquo;m not&ndash; I don&rsquo;t&ndash; [sniffles]</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what John thinks.</p>
<p>I wanna talk to John &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m like&ndash;
I don&rsquo;t want to disappoint John.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want him to think that he signed
some fucking Disney kid, like&ndash;</p>
<p>John was standing there, like,</p>
<p>-smiling ear to ear.
-John was excited.</p>
<p>[friend 1] It is in your head.</p>
<p>It just sucks too, &lsquo;cause, like,
the whole song thing.</p>
<p>He called me this morning
about the song with Justin,</p>
<p>-and I was like‚Ä¶
-[friend 1] The DJ thing, hmm?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like, when am I gonna just be
good enough by myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>-[manager] Just don&rsquo;t worry about that.
-Like, when am I gonna be&ndash; like&ndash;</p>
<p>When am I gonna be good just by myself?</p>
<p>Not needing anybody to be associated with.</p>
<p>-Like, it&rsquo;s so fu&ndash;
-[manager] You already are.</p>
<p>[friend 1] Hi, John.</p>
<p>-I&rsquo;m so sorry.
-[Janick] What are you sorry about?</p>
<p>I just, like, I-I don&rsquo;t want you
to ever regret signing me‚Ä¶</p>
<p>-What?
-‚Ä¶or feeling like you need something&ndash;</p>
<p>-You were amazing.
-We were both standing next to you.</p>
<p>The costume looked bad.
Everything looked so bad.</p>
<p>You were amazing.
I thought it was awesome.</p>
<p>Can I have a hug?
I&rsquo;ll give you a hug. [chuckles]</p>
<p>I thought you were amazing.
It was so good.</p>
<p>-[friend 2] Really.
-&ldquo;Me and My Girls&rdquo; was crazy. Like the&ndash;</p>
<p>[friend 1] That&rsquo;s it. John was standing
there like this. John was like&ndash;</p>
<p>I was rocking out to it. It was awesome.</p>
<p>[Gomez] Does it feel young?</p>
<p>-It doesn&rsquo;t feel young.
-[friend 2] No.</p>
<p>I do&ndash; I w-want nothing more
than to not be my past.</p>
<p>And it comes back.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re your own worst enemy right now.</p>
<p>When you get all into your head and it&rsquo;s,
like, you can&rsquo;t let it spiral you.</p>
<p>-Costumes can change.
-[friend 1] Yeah.</p>
<p>Lights can change. Sets can change.</p>
<p>You wanna get rid of the stage,
you can perform on the floor.</p>
<p>What people like and don&rsquo;t like
doesn&rsquo;t matter. You have to like it.</p>
<p>You have to feel good about it.
It&rsquo;s your show.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up over it.
It&rsquo;s gonna be great.</p>
<p>-John, thank you.
-It&rsquo;s great seeing you.</p>
<p>-Sorry. Thank you. Sorry.
-I&rsquo;ll see you soon.</p>
<p>Thank you. No. It really is great.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>-[sniffling]
-[friend 1] Aw.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry. [sobs]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>[team member] They&rsquo;re coming.</p>
<p>[crowd chattering]</p>
<p>-[Gomez] Theresa?
-[assistant] Hey, girl.</p>
<p>-Did you bring my blood pressure machine?
-Yeah. It&rsquo;s right here.</p>
<p>[assistant] This is for your lupus, right?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>-Now do I press it? Just start?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>-That&rsquo;s good, right?
-Perfect.</p>
<p>[assistant] How do you know?</p>
<p>So, 109 over 78 is really good.</p>
<p>The average, what you would probably have,
is 120 over 78.</p>
<p>But when my blood pressure is high,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually 150, 145
to the bottom number being a hundred,</p>
<p>-which means I could have a stroke.
-Whoa.</p>
<p>[assistant] Got it.</p>
<p>-So as long as it stays under 120&ndash;
-Should we keep this in here for tour?</p>
<p>Like, in your little‚Ä¶</p>
<p>-I mean, maybe on the bus.
-Okay.</p>
<p>It probably should be wherever we are,
just in case.</p>
<p>[manager] We have a gift for you,
and then we&rsquo;re gonna leave you alone.</p>
<p>-[chuckling]
-Can you start with this?</p>
<p>This is from me and Zack.</p>
<p>This is something we&rsquo;ve collected for you,
for tour.</p>
<p>[Gomez] What is this?</p>
<p>Every day, it&rsquo;s a good luck charm word
for that night</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re going to be thinking of‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[Morgenroth]
You put it on your makeup table.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶for you.
And every show is a different one.</p>
<p>-That&rsquo;s so kind.
-[Gomez] Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>-So, look at these.
-[team member] So sweet.</p>
<p>It kind of made us cry.</p>
<p>Every day you&rsquo;ll choose one.</p>
<p>-That is so beautiful.
-Isn&rsquo;t that cool?</p>
<p>-Thank you so much.
-We love you so much.</p>
<p>[Keshishian] So, my question to you is,</p>
<p>do you feel like you have
too many meet and greets?</p>
<p>They have about
an hour and a half scheduled.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it will take that long.</p>
<p>-What do you think?
-Sometimes they milk it.</p>
<p>-It&rsquo;s my birthday.
-It is? Happy birthday.</p>
<p>-Thank you.
-How old are you?</p>
<p>-I&rsquo;m 13.
-Oh, Mylanta.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been celebrating your birthday
every year since I was three.</p>
<p>-My birthday?
-I&rsquo;ve had bi&ndash;</p>
<p>I have birthday parties, cakes,
playlists, everything.</p>

<p>[photographer] Aw. Got it.</p>
<p>And can you put,
&ldquo;Bae number one,&rdquo; right there?</p>
<p>-Okay.
-[laughing]</p>
<p>[Gomez chuckles]</p>
<p>Yeah. I got, like, different girls.</p>
<p>-[laughs]
-I&rsquo;m a&ndash;</p>
<p>I could be number one?</p>

for how hard all of you worked.</p>
<p>It means more to me

I&rsquo;ve ever done,</p>
<p>which is why I&rsquo;ve been a mess every day,
so that you know.</p>

people, have so much fun.</p>
<p>And bless our feet, our hands,
our instruments, everything.</p>

I&rsquo;m so sorry. Too many people.</p>
<p>-[friend] Stop analyzing.
-[Gomez] No.</p>
<p>-[friend] Be happy.
-I am happy.</p>
<p>I hate it. [groans]</p>
<p>[breathing deeply]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard being a fucking girl</p>
<p>and being crazy already.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing that pissed me off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing the quick change,</p>
<p>then rip goes one sleeve,
and then rip goes the other one,</p>
<p>and then all my entire bottom half ripped.</p>
<p>‚ô™ Oh, that‚Ä¶ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[reporter]
How are you feeling about Justin?</p>
<p>[reporter 2] Are you depressed?</p>
<p>-[reporter 3] Are you tired?
-[reporter 4] She&rsquo;s always tired.</p>
<p>[paparazzi clamoring]</p>
<p>Sometimes I&ndash; I wake up, and
I don&rsquo;t really feel like I have it in me.</p>
<p>[reporter] Selena is now on break,</p>
<p>dealing with anxiety,
panic attacks, and depression.</p>
<p>[reporter 2] There were rumors
that she had a drug problem.</p>
<p>[reporter 3] Letting the high life
of celebrity and partying</p>
<p>get the best of her and her career.</p>
<p>[assistant] At one point, she&rsquo;s like,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna be alive right now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Wait. What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was one of those moments</p>
<p>where you look in her eyes
and there&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>It was just pitch black,
and it&rsquo;s so scary.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Okay, fuck this.</p>
<p>Like, this needs to end, like,
we need to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had to have a serious
conversation with her of, like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her answer was also like,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t explain it.</p>
<p>I wish you could feel
what it feels like to be in my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just remember it being very chaotic
and she was hearing all of these voices.</p>
<p>They just kept getting louder
and louder and louder.</p>
<p>That triggered some
sort of psychotic break.</p>
<p>Selena Gomez has been in dire straits,
uh, for a couple of weeks now.</p>
<p>Last year, she was battling lupus,
and the kidney transplant saved her life.</p>
<p>As a result of that,</p>
<p>she had a very low white blood cell count
in the last week of September.</p>
<p>Purely a medical situation,
but it turned into an emotional breakdown.</p>
<p>[reporter 2]
She was trying to rip her IVs out.</p>
<p>And it was so bad, they ended up
taking her to a psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p>We heard about her mental breakdown
through TMZ.</p>
<p>They called me and wanted to know</p>
<p>what my daughter was doing
in the hospital with a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with me,</p>
<p>and I was scared she was gonna die.</p>
<p>[Stevens] If anybody saw what I saw</p>
<p>and the state that she was in
at the mental hospital,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized her at all.</p>
<p>And I was devastated</p>
<p>because psychosis can last
from days, to weeks, to months,</p>
<p>to years, to life.</p>
<p>You hang on as tight as you can
and try to help them with their treatment,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the hardest thing to do,</p>
<p>to then just go to bed
and hope that they wake up the next day.</p>
<p>[Gomez]
My thoughts take over my mind often.</p>
<p>It hurts when I think about my past.</p>
<p>I wanna know how to breathe again.</p>
<p>Do I love my own self?</p>
<p>How do I learn
how to breathe my own breath?</p>
<p>[breathes deeply]</p>
<p>[Teefey] It&rsquo;s a miracle she got out‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[voice breaking] ‚Ä¶but there&rsquo;s always
that fear that that&rsquo;s gonna happen again,</p>
<p>and it hurt us so much.</p>
<p>[Gomez] I found out
I have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be honest,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wanna go
to a mental health hospital.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t want to be trapped
in myself&ndash; In my mind anymore.</p>
<p>I thought my life was over. I was like,
&ldquo;This is how I&rsquo;m gonna be forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I say to people that
I have the greatest friends and family,</p>
<p>especially my mom and my stepdad, Brian.</p>
<p>Because I shouldn&rsquo;t have spoken to them
the way that I did,</p>
<p>and I shouldn&rsquo;t have treated them
the way that I did sometimes. [sniffling]</p>
<p>And then they know it wasn&rsquo;t me,</p>
<p>so then when I wake up the next day,
they&rsquo;re like&ndash;</p>
<p>[stammers] They tell me what happened,
but they&rsquo;re&ndash; They explain to me&ndash;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Look,
we know that that&rsquo;s not you talking,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re really concerned, and&ndash;
You know, just know that we love you.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see anything different
from what was&ndash; Last night to now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if I talk about it to them,</p>
<p>then I just say it
over and over again, you know?</p>
<p>I say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause I remember
certain things that I did</p>
<p>and I was really so mean.</p>
<p>And so, like&ndash; Even to this day, I keep
saying &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and everything that I do&ndash;</p>
<p>And they are always like,
&ldquo;Once we found out everything,</p>
<p>it made so much sense, Selena.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re the best
that you&rsquo;ve ever been,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re so happy that we can see that,
and we never, ever would give up on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they haven&rsquo;t when, in so many times,
they probably should have.</p>
<p>[stammers] I&rsquo;m in a better place, but‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[sighs] I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I guess sometimes
I can&rsquo;t explain it, for sure.</p>
<p>[piano playing]</p>
<p>-[playing off-key]
-No.</p>
<p>Totally lost.</p>
<p>When I first got out,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know
how I&rsquo;d cope with my diagnosis.</p>
<p>What if it happened again?</p>
<p>What if the next time I didn&rsquo;t come back?</p>
<p>I needed to keep learning about it.</p>
<p>I needed to take it day-by-day.</p>
<p>When I was a kid,
I was terrified of thunderstorms.</p>
<p>I grew up in Texas,</p>
<p>and I was so scared that lightning and
thunder would mean a tornado was coming.</p>
<p>But my mom gave me these books for kids</p>
<p>that explained storms
and lightning and thunder,</p>
<p>and basically said,
&ldquo;The more you learn about it,</p>
<p>the less you&rsquo;re going to be afraid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it really helped.</p>
<p>[toddler Gomez] I love you.</p>
<p>-I love you. [kisses]
-[chattering]</p>
<p>[Gomez] You know, my mom was always
teaching me not to be scared of life.</p>
<p>-She&rsquo;s such a powerful spirit.
-[Teefey] Your nose? Did you hit the door?</p>
<p>[Gomez] She was so young, still in school,</p>
<p>and eventually tried every job
you could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>[Teefey] Kiddo.</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;This is what we&rsquo;re
going through, but I&rsquo;m not gonna stop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna give up.
I&rsquo;m gonna make my life better than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Teefey] Oh, here&rsquo;s one.
&ldquo;Stay at home. $145 a day.</p>
<p>Processing mail
for local company in your area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-Yeah. Hey, I could do that.
-[babbles]</p>
<p>[Gomez] You know, my mom&ndash;</p>
<p>She had me
when she was still in high school.</p>
<p>[babbling]</p>
<p>Daddy?</p>
<p>[Gomez] My parents were separated
when I was five.</p>
<p>My grandparents, my nana and papa,
would look after me when my mom worked.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶that song you were singing about grandpa?</p>
<p>[singing indistinctly]</p>
<p>[singing, babbling]</p>
<p>[toddler Gomez] Hi, Daddy.</p>
<p>[Gomez] I can&rsquo;t imagine
the pressure for my dad.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>[Gomez] He has a lot of regrets,</p>
<p>and he would be like,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, mi hija. I just&ndash;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to talk to you.&rdquo;
[sniffles]</p>
<p>But he made me feel</p>
<p>like I was the, like,
prettiest young girl.</p>
<p>Like I could do anything, and no one
was worthy, and, like&ndash; [sniffles]</p>
<p>So, I miss him a lot‚Ä¶</p>
<p>but he knows that, so‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Take a picture of her, and you&rsquo;re
gonna take a picture of us, okay?</p>
<p>-[Teefey] Well, get over there.
-Hold on, I&rsquo;m coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a picture.</p>
<p>[both] Friends forever.</p>
<p>[Teefey]
Is that all y&rsquo;all have got to say?</p>
<p>Okay. [whispering]</p>
<p>[Gomez] Priscilla is my cousin,</p>
<p>probably the closest person to me
in the world, except for my mom.</p>
<p>We did everything together.</p>
<p>[both chattering, laughing]</p>
<p>To this day, she&rsquo;s my life.
She&rsquo;s my blood.</p>
<p>Actually we never did.
So, we never went back to those.</p>
<p>-[Teefey] Where are we going?
-Just don&rsquo;t&ndash;</p>
<p>-Chicken Express, to get sweet tea.
-[Teefey] Okay.</p>
<p>[Cosme] If you like rolls, there&rsquo;s rolls.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re&ndash; [chuckles]
I just wanted sweet tea.</p>
<p>-[Gomez] Wait, we&rsquo;re gonna do three.
-[Cosme] Three, uh, large sweet teas&ndash;</p>
<p>-Extra ice in one of them.
-[Gomez] Please, sir?</p>
<p>[attendant] No problem.</p>
<p>-You can&rsquo;t talk over me like that.
-Well, you didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was getting there.</p>
<p>[Gomez] Every time I&rsquo;ve come home,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always just gone
to the places that I remember.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t want
to lose that part of me.</p>
<p>[doorbell rings]</p>
<p>[friend] Do you even go here?</p>
<p>-[doorbell rings]
-[receptionist through speaker] Beep!</p>
<p>-[receptionist chattering]
-Hi&ndash;</p>
<p>I need to see your driver&rsquo;s license
if you&rsquo;re coming in the building, please.</p>
<p>-A driver&rsquo;s license?
-Yeah.</p>
<p>-Okay.
-[friend] Here. Grab one.</p>
<p>-For everybody that&rsquo;s out there.
-Oh.</p>
<p>[chuckles] I don&rsquo;t have one.</p>
<p>Okay, never mind. [stammers]
I used to go here when I was younger.</p>
<p>Um, my name is Selena, so I didn&rsquo;t
mean to bother you, but thank you.</p>
<p>-You&rsquo;re welcome.
-Bye.</p>
<p>Okay, bye.</p>
<p>[friend] She does.</p>
<p>[registrar] Do you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Who all has a driver&rsquo;s license?</p>
<p>-Everybody.
-[friend] We have one.</p>
<p>-[Mingus] She used to go here&ndash;
-I used to come here</p>
<p>-and I wanted to see&ndash;
-[registrar] No worries.</p>
<p>[Mingus] Are you a teacher here?</p>
<p>-[stutters] I&rsquo;m the registrar.
-Oh, got it.</p>
<p>Except&ndash; Yeah, I work in the office.</p>
<p>[office aides clamoring]</p>
<p>[Gomez] Hi, guys.</p>
<p>Everybody calm down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re office aides? How old are you guys?</p>
<p>[all] Thirteen.</p>
<p>[Gomez] That&rsquo;s so nice.
Do you know I went to school here?</p>
<p>-[all] Yes.
-[Gomez] You do?</p>
<p>Okay. So I only had a crush
on Dylan Alvarado, um&ndash;</p>
<p>Sammy in elementary.</p>
<p>Okay. Elementary was Sammy Rodriguez.</p>
<p>-Then it was Dylan Alvarado, Keith Maupin‚Ä¶
-Keith.</p>
<p>Eli was in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Hmm. No, not necessarily. Really?</p>
<p>-Yes.
-Okay.</p>
<p>And then Matthew from Danny Jones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Not one of them liked me back.</p>
<p>-But again, like I said, they regret it.
-Yeah, I was just saying. [chuckles]</p>
<p>[Cosme] She was, I would say,
like, an outcast, growing up, you know?</p>
<p>Like, in school,
she didn&rsquo;t really talk to many people.</p>
<p>She had, like, her&ndash;
You know, little two or three friends,</p>
<p>but not a lot of boyfriends,
if you know what I mean. [chuckles]</p>
<p>And so I would go in there to get my food,</p>
<p>and I would sit, like, right here,
at a long table.</p>
<p>-But it was usually by myself.
-[friend] No&ndash;</p>
<p>[students greeting]</p>
<p>-Hi. My name is&ndash; My name is Selena.
-[student] I saw you earlier.</p>
<p>Whatever you think you can&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>just know that there&rsquo;s no one
that&rsquo;s gonna tell you no but yourself.</p>
<p>You have to continue
to do what you wanna do.</p>
<p>-Now that is inspirational.
-So&ndash; Oh, I&rsquo;m&ndash;</p>
<p>-Yeah?
-Great. Great.</p>
<p>-[students clapping]
-So, kick ass, or&ndash; Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>-[laughing, clamoring]
-You gotta stay after school.</p>
<p>Hello, students
at Danny Jones Middle School.</p>
<p>This is Selena Gomez talking to you.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me
disrupt your classes.</p>
<p>And just&ndash; just a reminder,
your teachers aren&rsquo;t that bad.</p>
<p>You just gotta do the hard work.
[chuckles]</p>
<p>You have to hug him. He&rsquo;s gonna cry.</p>
<p>-[student 1] Can I have an autograph?
-He&rsquo;s such a big fan.</p>
<p>[student 2] Oh, my God!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>-Can I have a hug, too?
-[student 3] Can I have a hug?</p>
<p>[students clamoring]</p>
<p>-[Gomez] This is where‚Ä¶
-[Mingus] I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶I grew up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my house.</p>
<p>-[Mingus] It is?
-[Gomez] Yeah.</p>
<p>[Mingus]
I bet your handprints are still there.</p>
<p>This spot right here&ndash;</p>
<p>Poor neighbors, &lsquo;cause some guy
would do drug deals, like, right there,</p>
<p>and we would watch through those windows
&lsquo;cause we weren&rsquo;t allowed outside.</p>
<p>-I felt bad for those neighbors‚Ä¶
-[Cosme] Yeah.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶&lsquo;cause he would pull up his car,
it was an old car,</p>
<p>there was a trunk, and‚Ä¶ [clicks tongue]</p>
<p>-This was the same door.
-Oh.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>-[homeowner] Hi. [chuckles]
-Hi, my name is Selena.</p>
<p>-How are you?
-How are you?</p>
<p>-[homeowner] Good, good. Come on in.
-Do you mind?</p>
<p>-[homeowner] No. Please.
-Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Okay, this is where I used to, um,</p>
<p>-descale fish, right here.
-[Mingus] Descale fish.</p>
<p>[Gomez] Yes.</p>
<p>[Teefey] Selena, what&rsquo;s he doing?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just cutting his blood out.</p>
<p>-So this is my bedroom.
-[homeowner] It&rsquo;s kinda messy, though.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I see if I still have
my drawings from this closet?</p>
<p>Oh, they took it out.</p>
<p>-[Cosme] It&rsquo;s gone?
-Yeah.</p>
<p>I used to have, like&ndash;
I had a crush on Cole and Dylan Sprouse,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d come in my closet,
and I would write things down.</p>
<p>-[Cosme] No.
-Thank you.</p>
<p>-There&rsquo;s writing on this one.
-Really?</p>
<p>I guess you were really in love with Cole.</p>
<p>-[Cosme, homeowner chuckle]
-Oh, my gosh! Stop this. [gasps]</p>
<p>I mean&ndash;
I&rsquo;m sorry, Cole, if you ever see this.</p>
<p>[Cosme] I would, like, straddle‚Ä¶</p>
<p>-Um, Christiana?
-Yeah?</p>
<p>This right here&ndash;
My nana can show you the photo.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s taking a photo.
I&rsquo;m looking at myself in the mirror.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I found out
I booked Barney.</p>
<p>-[Christiana] Oh, my God.
-[Cosme] You were on the phone.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a picture of me in here.</p>
<p>Everything looks wonderful, Barney.</p>
<p>‚ô™ She&rsquo;ll be coming round‚Ä¶ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[Gomez] I was seven years old
when I got my first job.</p>
<p>I was proud because I got to
go escape my life and be in Barney Land,</p>
<p>and just play and sing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I just fell in love
with these escape things.</p>
<p>Then I never stopped. I just kept going.</p>
<p>And then when I hit around 11
and I moved to Los Angeles,</p>
<p>I just wanted to work. I loved my job.</p>
<p>But eventually,
after doing this for so long,</p>
<p>I started to feel vain.</p>
<p>It made me feel lonely somehow.</p>
<p>And then when I started touring,
it just got worse.</p>
<p>After I got out
of the last treatment center,</p>
<p>I knew what made me happy was connection.</p>
<p>This is Joyce.</p>
<p>Priscilla, are we sure?</p>
<p>[Cosme] Yeah.
You want me to ask my grandma?</p>
<p>She had this beautiful doll house
that I wanted so bad.</p>
<p>[Cosme] Is that why you put poop
on her front porch?</p>
<p>-Stop. That was Charlie.
-[laughs]</p>
<p>They would always pick on her.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>-Hi, I&rsquo;m Selena.
-Yes?</p>
<p>I used to come here when Joyce&ndash;
Joyce lived here.</p>
<p>-Selena Gomez?
-Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. [laughs]</p>
<p>Is she here?</p>
<p>Yeah. She&rsquo;s, uh&ndash;
Why don&rsquo;t you come on in?</p>
<p>-Are you sure?
-Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do y&rsquo;all still have that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>-[Cosme] The doll house?
-Don&rsquo;t&ndash; Don&rsquo;t let anyone else in.</p>
<p>-[Gomez gasps]
-[Joyce] How are you?</p>
<p>-Oh, my gosh. Hi. Don&rsquo;t move.
-[Joyce&rsquo;s husband] Thank you.</p>
<p>-[Joyce] I got to move.
-[Cosme] There&rsquo;s the doll house, Selena.</p>
<p>Hi&ndash; Is that the&ndash; That&rsquo;s the dollhouse!
Don&rsquo;t&ndash; Don&rsquo;t get up.</p>
<p>[Joyce] I can&rsquo;t get up, baby.</p>
<p>-[Gomez] It&rsquo;s okay.
-How do you like my bald head?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you look great.</p>
<p>Got past that, but, see,
I broke my ankle twice this year.</p>
<p>-I&ndash; I can&rsquo;t get up.
-Yeah, what&rsquo;s been going on?</p>
<p>W-Well, not much.</p>
<p>Hmm. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I broke a toe.</p>
<p>So how&rsquo;s your health now?</p>
<p>[Gomez] My health is goo&ndash; Is doing good.
My lupus is in remission.</p>
<p>-Good.
-And I&rsquo;m very happy about that.</p>
<p>I got a kidney transplant two years ago,</p>
<p>and so far
everything&rsquo;s going good with that.</p>
<p>-Well, good.
-Yeah,</p>
<p>-I just take my medication every day.
-You know, lupus is cousin to MS.</p>
<p>Really? I did not know that.</p>
<p>A lot of the symptoms are alike.
It&rsquo;s autoimmune&ndash; An autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>-Yeah?
-What do you remember about me?</p>
<p>I remember&ndash; [sighs]
I remember when we&rsquo;d come over here,</p>
<p>and me and Charlie
would give you a hard time.</p>
<p>Okay. [chuckles]
Here&rsquo;s the self-testimony here.</p>
<p>Yes, it is. And I apologize f&ndash;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t remember anything else about it?</p>
<p>No, I do. You would let us come in,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have cookies,
and I get to go right there, and&ndash;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was waiting
for you to say my cookies.</p>
<p>-Oh, I remember. We&rsquo;d play with that.
-Cookie lady.</p>
<p>-I think it was over here last time.
-It was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>-[Joyce chattering]
-[Gomez chuckles]</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.
I was obsessed with this, Joyce.</p>
<p>-Well, it was good to see you.
-[Joyce] I&rsquo;m just so thrilled that you&ndash;</p>
<p>I once asked Debbie
if you&rsquo;d come and see me sometime.</p>
<p>-And I&rsquo;m glad I did.
-You did.</p>
<p>-Mm-hmm.
-I didn&rsquo;t have to ask.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>[Joyce] You&rsquo;re sick too.</p>
<p>[Gomez] Oh, it&rsquo;s okay. We all get through.</p>
<p>-Thank you so much.
-I hope you have a great day.</p>
<p>-I&rsquo;ll be praying for you.
-Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>[Cosme] Bye, Joyce.</p>
<p>-Bye, Selena.
-[Gomez] Bye. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>-[cameraperson] Thank you.
-[Gomez] It was good to see you.</p>
<p>[cameraperson] Thank you, guys.</p>
<p>[Joyce chattering]</p>
<p>[Gomez laughs] I will.</p>
<p>[sighs]</p>
<p>When I got my lupus, it was really scary.</p>
<p>Then I got out of it and I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go and visit these people,
because I&rsquo;ve had this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi, baby.</p>
<p>And then I had the transplant,
and we did a lot of work.</p>
<p>And then
when it started into mental health,</p>
<p>and the same thing I said to myself is,
&ldquo;Now I can relate to these people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-I think things happen for a reason.
-All right. Bye, guys.</p>
<p>[Gomez] Just be who you are, Selena.</p>
<p>Just stop trying.</p>
<p>No one cares about what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about who I am.
Being okay with where I am.</p>
<p>I am grateful for my family.</p>
<p>I am grateful for my friends.</p>
<p>I am grateful to be alive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna add three more paragraphs
that I wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we are better
when we tell the truth,</p>
<p>-so again, and I&rsquo;m telling my truth.&rdquo;
-[Wright] Yeah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was suffering mentally and emotionally,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t able to stay all buttoned up
and together.</p>
<p>I felt as though all of my pain, anxiety,
fear washed over me all at once,</p>
<p>and it was one of the scariest moments
of my life.</p>
<p>It was the day that&ndash;
that I found out I was bipolar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Wright] No one thinks
that you need to say you&rsquo;re bipolar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re 27 years old</p>
<p>and you have a lifetime to tell the world
that exact thing,</p>
<p>unless you are determined
that now&rsquo;s the time that you want it out.</p>
<p>-Okay.
-No one&rsquo;s&ndash; No one&rsquo;s against it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that
that becomes the narrative, right there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that means, like&ndash; What?</p>
<p>Like, certain people or directors
or something may not wanna work with me?</p>
<p>But then why would I wanna work
with them anyway?</p>
<p>-[Marino] True. Whatever you think.
-I think I&rsquo;m gonna say it.</p>
<p>-[Marino] Yeah.
-I&rsquo;m gonna say it. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>-And that&rsquo;s it.
-[Wright] It&rsquo;ll say&ndash; Yeah.</p>

<p>on her personal battle with depression
and anxiety,</p>
<p>and the journey that she says left her‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[groans] Do I have 20 minutes?</p>
<p>-[cameraperson] Are you feeling nerves?
-[groans] I don&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>[Wright] Is it nerves?</p>
<p>[Gomez] I don&rsquo;t feel good, you guys,
like, at all.</p>
<p>-[friend] Is she hungry?
-[Gomez] Very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>-[Wright] What?
-What happened?</p>
<p>Or nerves.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>What did it do?</p>
<p>-It makes you feel sick.
-It burns.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hi, Raquelle.</p>
<p>[Stevens] Hello, Selena.</p>
<p>[Wright] Raquelle, this is so cute.
This is a whole one-piece outfit, or two?</p>
<p>[Stevens] No. It&rsquo;s&ndash; It&rsquo;s so crazy‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[audience clapping]</p>
<p>[host] It is with great pleasure
that I welcome you</p>
<p>to the McLean Psychiatric Hospital
annual dinner.</p>
<p>Hi, guys. Um, I&rsquo;m very happy to be here,</p>
<p>and I might be a little awkward,
so I&rsquo;m sorry. [chuckles]</p>
<p>Um, yeah. I started when,
um&ndash; I started working when I was seven,</p>
<p>and I quickly learned
how to play the part.</p>
<p>I have juggled work and school
and relationships</p>
<p>for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>As great as life was,
underneath all of it, I was struggling.</p>
<p>Last year, I was, um&ndash; I was suffering
m-mentally and emotionally,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t able to stay
all buttoned-up and together.</p>
<p>I sought support,</p>
<p>and the doctors were able
to give me a clear diagnosis.</p>
<p>The moment
that I received that information,</p>
<p>I finally had the knowledge of why
I had suffered for so many years</p>
<p>with depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>So I began to face it head-on,</p>
<p>as my mother had taught me to face my
fears and challenges when I was younger.</p>
<p>I am happier, I am healthier,</p>
<p>and I am in control of my emotions and
thoughts more than I have ever been.</p>
<p>-So, I&rsquo;m very happy about that. Thanks.
-[crowd applauding]</p>
<p>[chuckles]</p>
<p>It actually feels good to say it,
because I mean it, you know?</p>
<p>Like, for so many years, I feel, like,
maybe I needed to say that,</p>
<p>but it feels really great to be able
to actually mean it this time.</p>
<p>Um, I also struggle with my own thoughts
and feelings at times,</p>
<p>but this doesn&rsquo;t make me faulty.</p>
<p>This does not make me weak.</p>
<p>This does not make me less than.</p>
<p>This makes me human.</p>
<p>That was my life and the fact
that you brought light to it&ndash;</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for someone that was able
to put the word out there,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t make change happen.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart,
your courage is amazing,</p>
<p>and I&ndash; I think that you are saving lives.
I know that you&rsquo;re saving lives,</p>
<p>-so thank you for the work that you do.
-Wow, I just hope I&rsquo;m a part of&ndash;</p>
<p>I just hope I&rsquo;m a part of
the conversation, you know?</p>
<p>Absolutely, thank you. It&rsquo;s such an honor.</p>
<p>You guys are the ones that save the lives,
but as much as I can use what I do,</p>
<p>-I&rsquo;m more than happy to be here.
-Thank you.</p>
<p>Even just for you to, like, speak publicly
about your experience with mental health,</p>
<p>-depression, and anxiety&ndash;
-Yeah.</p>
<p>Me, myself, I attempted
almost three years ago in October,</p>
<p>and I remember just&ndash;
Oh, thank you. [chuckles]</p>
<p>[Gomez] Being honest that night helped.</p>
<p>I texted Julia Michaels
and Justin Tranter</p>
<p>and said,
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m ready to just say I&rsquo;m sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We wrote the song in 45 minutes.
The fastest song I&rsquo;ve ever written.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about more than just a lost love.
It&rsquo;s me learning to choose myself.</p>
<p>To choose life.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Lose You to Love Me&rdquo; playing on piano]</p>
<p>But also hoping that people
can find grace and peace in that too.</p>
<p>‚ô™ You promised the world
And I fell for it ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I put you first and you adored it ‚ô™</p>

<p>‚ô™ And you let it burn

<p>‚ô™ &lsquo;Cause it wasn&rsquo;t yours ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I saw the signs and I ignored it ‚ô™</p>
<p>-[song continues]
-The song is about knowing</p>
<p>that you completely lost
every part of who you are.</p>
<p>‚ô™ Set fire to my purpose ‚ô™</p>
<p>Just to rediscover yourself again.</p>
<p>‚ô™ You got off on the hurtin&rsquo;
When it wasn&rsquo;t yours, yeah ‚ô™</p>
<p>[reporters clamoring]</p>
<p>[reporter]
Are you still in love with Justin?</p>
<p>[Gomez] Everything was so public.</p>

<p>[paparazzo 2] What&rsquo;s your favorite thing
about Bieber?</p>
<p>Can I go to the&ndash; Get food, please?
Can you not&ndash; Wanna go get food.</p>
<p>I felt haunted by a past relationship
that no one wanted to let go of.</p>
<p>But then I just moved past it.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t afraid anymore.</p>
<p>-Thank you, everybody. Bye, guys!
-[crew member] All right guys. So um,</p>
<p>-that is a camera wrap.
-Thank you.</p>

<p>It says, &ldquo;Selena Gomez is now projected</p>

-[Mingus] Yes.</p>
<p>-[Stevens] Yeah.
-I wanna cry.</p>
<p>[fans shouting]</p>
<p>-Was it one of your biggest songs ever?
-Yeah, it was.</p>
<p>-It is your biggest song ever, right?
-[crowd cheering]</p>
<p>[Gomez]
I wanted to be as honest as I could,</p>
<p>and I think that I&rsquo;m very lucky
to be in a position</p>
<p>where I can make people feel good.</p>
<p>I feel like I had to go through
the worst possible heartbreak ever,</p>
<p>and then just forgetting everything
at the drop of the hand.</p>
<p>It was&ndash; It was really confusing,
but I just think that needed to happen.</p>
<p>And ultimately it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</p>
<p>[Janick] And ultimately,
so, your message is&ndash;</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t hear me say it was
the best thing that happened to me.</p>
<p>-[Janick] Sorry.
-You just started talking.</p>
<p>-I can&rsquo;t say it anymore.
-[Janick] One more time.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>All right. What do you wanna ask me?</p>
<p>[Janick] I just&ndash; Was it the best thing
that ever happened to you?</p>
<p>[laughs]</p>
<p>It was the best thing
that ever happened to me, yes.</p>
<p>So, when do you want an album out?</p>
<p>-January.
-[Janick] Okay, cool.</p>
<p>I just need to know if you have to leave,</p>
<p>-or issues, or it&ndash;
-I have to go to Kenya and London.</p>
<p>-Okay.
-[chuckles]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a fun six weeks.</p>
<p>Do you want to, um,
perform at the AMAs this year?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, um, okay.</p>
<p>-So if we do want to do that‚Ä¶
-I do.</p>
<p>-‚Ä¶we&rsquo;ll get into that right now.
-Perfect.</p>
<p>-Okay.
-[sighs] My stomach.</p>
<p>-[Morgenroth] Are you hungry?
-No.</p>
<p>-[Morgenroth] You all right?
-Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s nerves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also chilly. Do you want a sweater?</p>
<p>-I&rsquo;m hot as hell.
-You are? Okay.</p>
<p>-Well, then you&rsquo;re in the right room.
-Yeah.</p>
<p>-It feels like the Amazon.
-It&rsquo;s like an igloo.</p>
<p>It is an igloo in here.</p>
<p>-Y&rsquo;all are gonna kill me, but‚Ä¶
-So, let&rsquo;s start over.</p>
<p>-Y&rsquo;all are gonna kill me, but I gotta go.
-Okay.</p>
<p>-I just feel&ndash; Yeah. Oh.
-You all right? Sorry.</p>
<p>[Morgenroth]
I think it&rsquo;s the stress of this meeting.</p>
<p>[tour member] Mmm, I think so.</p>
<p>-[tour member 2] Me too.
-Okay.</p>
<p>[tour member 3 chuckles] Yeah.</p>
<p>[Gomez] I hadn&rsquo;t been onstage
in over two years,</p>
<p>and I still didn&rsquo;t know if I was ready.</p>
<p>But what good is having a song
if I was too scared to sing it?</p>
<p>After the AMAs,
I was going straight to Kenya.</p>
<p>For years, my doctors hadn&rsquo;t let me go
because of my kidney transplant,</p>
<p>but I was finally ready.</p>
<p>So, Raquelle and I were going
to visit students at a primary school,</p>
<p>and a college for young women.</p>
<p>Both schools that I helped raise the money
to build in Kenya for the WE Charity.</p>
<p>I knew it would be a lot,</p>
<p>but it was my only chance to go
before my album came out.</p>
<p>[shouts]</p>
<p>-That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s it.
-Is it done?</p>
<p>-That&rsquo;s it, yeah. Well done.
-[gasps]</p>
<p>-Okay.
-[nurse] Take a deep breath in, and out.</p>
<p>[nurse chuckles]</p>
<p>[Stevens] Ow! Hi, babe!</p>
<p>-[Gomez] Did you do it?
-Yeah.</p>
<p>-Good job.
-I&rsquo;m just laying down.</p>
<p>Are you in pain?</p>
<p>Yeah, my arm feels weak.</p>
<p>Oh, Mylanta.</p>
<p>-Now you know what I went through.
-I know. You went through more than me.</p>
<p>I was gonna say,
&ldquo;Actually, no, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[chuckles]</p>
<p>-I&rsquo;m proud of you, though.
-Thank you.</p>

something else right now.</p>
<p>-This one we need to sing.

Gomez, who didn&rsquo;t learn how to sing</p>

and gets millions for it.</p>

But anxiety, it doesn&rsquo;t just disappear.</p>
<p>In fact, she says that her lupus
amplifies her anxiety.</p>
<p>[Teefey] Hi. She&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>-[Stevens] Hi.

<p>[Stevens] Aw. How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>[friend] Hey, Sir Winnie. [kissing]</p>
<p>I got you some soup and that, um‚Ä¶
[speaks indistinctly] ‚Ä¶thing,</p>
<p>and a ham and cheese.</p>
<p>[Mingus] Aleen asked me,
when you do London promo, after Kenya,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re there for, like, three days.</p>
<p>And she asked if you can do&ndash; If you
wanna do Paris for a day and then home.</p>
<p>-Are you coming with me, Raquelle?
-[Stevens] Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>[Mingus]
Yeah? You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s too much?</p>
<p>Mmm, no, but I also don&rsquo;t wanna rush it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done promo in years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my least favorite thing
in the world to do.</p>
<p>[Stevens]
But I feel like it&rsquo;s gonna be great,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re excited
about what you&rsquo;re putting out‚Ä¶</p>
<p>-[Gomez] Mmm.
-‚Ä¶and it&rsquo;s so true to you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna talk about work anymore.</p>
<p>-[Stevens] Okay.
-Let&rsquo;s put on a movie.</p>
<p>I need a break.</p>
<p>[friend] From everything?</p>
<p>Mm-mmm, no. I have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Hunter, do you wanna maybe walk
and go in first in&ndash;</p>
<p>[Janick] I know you don&rsquo;t pay attention to
your calendar, but you&rsquo;re going to Africa.</p>
<p>Yeah, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m going to Kenya first,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna go straight to London,
and Paris for promo.</p>
<p>Okay. You feel okay
about trying to get everything done</p>
<p>-for the next month?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>
<p>-Okay.
-Not worried.</p>
<p>[Janick] Then it&rsquo;s just the video,
the campaign, the song.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>-[airport official] No computers in your&ndash;
-No. Do we take our shoes off?</p>
<p>-[airport official] Yes.
-Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go. Whoo! Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>-Whoo!
-Thank you.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>-We also say it&rsquo;s a blessing.
-What?</p>
<p>When it rains, we say it&rsquo;s a blessing.</p>
<p>-It&rsquo;s a blessing?
-Yeah.</p>
<p>When it rains here,
it&rsquo;s considered a blessing.</p>
<p>-[Stevens] Oh, I love that.
-Ooh! Whoa! [chuckles]</p>
<p>[guide] Take this. We can put this on now.
Are you okay with the camera?</p>
<p>-It&rsquo;s okay.
-[guide] It&rsquo;s fine&ndash; It&rsquo;s okay?</p>
<p>-Hello, everyone.
-[student] Hello.</p>
<p>-Hi, what&rsquo;s your name?
-Aneesia.</p>
<p>-Aneesia? I&rsquo;m Selena, nice to meet you.
-Yeah.</p>
<p>Hello. My name is Selena.
Um, I have come here with WE,</p>
<p>and I want to honor your&ndash;
your drive for education.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m&ndash; I&rsquo;m very happy to be here.</p>
<p>[Aneesia] So, which grade did you reach,
actually? Did you finish grade 12?</p>
<p>-Uh, I finished eighth grade‚Ä¶
-Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶and then for nine, ten, 11, 12,
I had to do school on set.</p>
<p>To&ndash; Like, five hours
and then I could work, so‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Wow.</p>
<p>Well, it was&ndash;
it was interesting, you know?</p>
<p>To be homeschooled by a computer.
It&rsquo;s not real‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[student] Wow.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶but it was&ndash; it was great for me.
It worked, you know?</p>
<p>[Aneesia] Late last year,
we had a talent group,</p>
<p>and we were singing, like, your song.
Like‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ô™ Who says you&rsquo;re not perfect ‚ô™</p>
<p>-[laughing]
-[Gomez] Oh, that&rsquo;s my song!</p>
<p>-That&rsquo;s one of my favorite songs.
-[student] ‚ô™ Who says, who says ‚ô™</p>
<p>[all] ‚ô™ Who says you&rsquo;re not perfect?
Who says you&rsquo;re not worth it? ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Who says you&rsquo;re the only one
That&rsquo;s hurtin&rsquo;? ‚ô™</p>
<p>[Gomez] I was really shy in school,</p>
<p>so I would usually just hang out
with two friends.</p>
<p>And, um, my cousin was, like,
the captain of the cheerleading team,</p>
<p>and so nobody would pick on me
because of my cousin.</p>
<p>My cousin, like, controls everything. Um‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[Stevens] Hmm, okay.</p>
<p>For me, I grew up in a family of eight,
like my mom and dad have eight kids.</p>
<p>My mom told me
that they want me to be married off,</p>
<p>but, at some point, they said that,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you got a school where you
got a scholarship to go and learn,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no need for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For them, they don&rsquo;t pay any fee.</p>
<p>So they told me
I&rsquo;m not going to be married off.</p>
<p>-[Stevens] That&rsquo;s very interesting.
-Do you believe in love?</p>
<p>[student chuckles] In love?</p>
<p>Do you believe in love?</p>
<p>[students laughing]</p>
<p>-&lsquo;Cause I know you love each other.
-[students] Yeah.</p>
<p>[chuckles] Love is just a gift.</p>
<p>-[student] Yeah.
-[Stevens] Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it something that you look forward to,
or you just think&ndash;</p>
<p>-You focus on what you do‚Ä¶
-[Aneesia] For me&ndash;</p>
<p>-‚Ä¶and then it comes. Right?
-[Aneesia] Yeah.</p>
<p>Or, like, having a boyfriend or such.</p>
<p>So, for me, uh, I will get one
when I&rsquo;m done with my high school.</p>
<p>[clicks tongue] Love it.</p>
<p>Because I&ndash; I don&rsquo;t want to split my mind.</p>
<p>So, I want to concentrate first here.</p>
<p>Just when the house is being built,</p>
<p>you cannot start building by the roof.</p>
<p>-You start by the foundation.
-[clamoring]</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t have the foundation,</p>
<p>so till I&rsquo;m done with form four‚Ä¶</p>
<p>then after that,
I can now think about that.</p>
<p>[Stevens chuckles] I love that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really well said.</p>
<p>[speaking Swahili]</p>
<p>[Stevens] Mmm.</p>
<p>[speaking Swahili]</p>
<p>-My name? Selena.
-Selena?</p>
<p>-Yeah.
-Selena.</p>
<p>-What&rsquo;s your name?
-Uh, Diana.</p>
<p>-Diana?
-Mmm.</p>
<p>-Beautiful.
-[chuckles] Mmm.</p>
<p>[Stevens] Raquelle.</p>
<p>-Oh yes. She says, &ldquo;I have a son.&rdquo;
-Oh! Right! Your son&ndash; He&rsquo;s old. Okay.</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;d like me?</p>
<p>How old&rsquo;s he?</p>
<p>-[beader] He&rsquo;s like, 20, 21 years old.
-[Stevens] Okay!</p>
<p>-[Gomez] That works.
-That might be better,</p>
<p>maybe more for Selena. We&rsquo;re both 27.
Selena likes younger guys. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh. What? Raquelle!</p>
<p>I have, in the past.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little worried
my lupus is flaring up.</p>
<p>-Here, will you open this, please?
-[Stevens] Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>My hands are still so messed up.</p>
<p>[Stevens] Shaky?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re&ndash; They hurt.</p>
<p>-So, every time I do this, they hurt.
-[Stevens] Why?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I went to the doctor
and he said he didn&rsquo;t see any swollen.</p>
<p>Said the only way that, you know,
we could find out is if I did, like, a&ndash;</p>
<p>-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>-I had to do a CAT scan or whatever? MRI.
-Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>-I think I might when I get back.
-Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>My name is Betty Chep,
and I&rsquo;m a student here taking nursing.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re checking your blood pressure,
which average‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[Chep] Being a nurse,
you&rsquo;re there with people</p>
<p>when they feel so bad, and support them.</p>
<p>So I felt that&rsquo;s the best thing
that I can do in life.</p>
<p>My dad was my role model.</p>
<p>And he really taught me that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>In this life,
you have to show people empathy,</p>
<p>have a chance to give people
more than what you receive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I believe in God.</p>
<p>I always tell myself that
no matter what people think about me,</p>
<p>and what God has planned
for me in my life,</p>
<p>that is what I will achieve in life. Yeah.</p>
<p>-That&rsquo;s amazing.
-Yeah.</p>
<p>-I believe in God as well.
-Wow.</p>
<p>[Chep]
I was born in a middle-class family.</p>
<p>But unfortunately,
when I was in grade ten,</p>
<p>my dad passed in a road accident.</p>
<p>My mom was not able to raise school fees
for me to go to the campus.</p>
<p>So I had to stay home six years.</p>
<p>Just fetching firewood, collecting water,
and doing some home chores.</p>
<p>So in those six years, I felt so terrible,</p>
<p>because I felt that I was becoming
a burden to my mom and everybody.</p>
<p>So I felt so discouraged and so hopeless.</p>
<p>So I went to the river,
and then I felt that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me just drown myself into this river.</p>
<p>End it here, so that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I will never see my mother suffer,</p>
<p>I will never see my sisters
and my siblings‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Just let me end this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I sat there for some time,
and I thought‚Ä¶</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I end my life now,
and I&rsquo;m the firstborn in my family‚Ä¶</p>
<p>what example
will I have shown to my family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>-Wow.
-So I woke up,</p>
<p>took the water, and went home.</p>
<p>After two weeks‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I was called
for an interview here at the WE College.</p>
<p>-Wow.
-[Chep] Just a miracle.</p>
<p>But look at me now.
I&rsquo;m a role model in my community.</p>
<p>[both] You are.</p>
<p>Some people call me and tell me
to talk&ndash; to speak to the girls‚Ä¶</p>
<p>and I usually tell them,
even if it means doing what you do daily‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Continue doing it,
and a miracle will come ahead of you.</p>
<p>-Yeah.
-[Chep] Yeah.</p>
<p>That takes so much courage,
to think about wanting to end your life.</p>
<p>And understanding that
that&rsquo;s not what you are meant to do.</p>
<p>-Yes.
-[Gomez] All by yourself.</p>
<p>And I really relate to that.
So when you say that,</p>
<p>I know that feeling
where you&rsquo;re about to do something</p>
<p>-to hurt yourself.
-[Chep] Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so happy to know you. [chuckles]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor for me to know you too.
[chuckles]</p>
<p>[chuckles, sniffles]</p>
<p>[thunder rumbling]</p>
<p>[shouting]</p>
<p>Oh. Raquelle! Come on.</p>
<p>[shouts]</p>
<p>[Gomez] One of my, like, goals in life&ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, like, had this in my mind
for seven years, um,</p>
<p>-is to create a bill‚Ä¶
-Yeah. Oh, wow.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶where it is required
to have a therapy, sort of, class</p>
<p>in elementary school on to high school.</p>
<p>I just think, you know, when you&rsquo;re a kid
and you&rsquo;re in kindergarten,</p>
<p>they ask you, like, how you&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, like, a smiley face or sad face,
and they&rsquo;re learning emotions,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s amazing, but then why would
we not continue to talk about that?</p>
<p>-Feelings only get more complicated‚Ä¶
-Yes.</p>
<p>-‚Ä¶and i-it&rsquo;s&ndash; it gets harder to navigate.
-Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>-[host] Can I ask a very odd question?
-[Gomez] Yeah.</p>
<p>-What&rsquo;s holding you back from doing it?
-It&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>
<p>Um, that I&rsquo;m not able to.
That I&rsquo;m not capable.</p>
<p>[charity member] Mmm.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not good enough.</p>
<p>[charity member] Mmm.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s something
that I&rsquo;ve felt a lot of growing up.</p>
<p>-[charity member] Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-[Gomez] Mmm.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the very thing
that makes you feel that,</p>
<p>is why you can relate to others.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the exact reason
why you are the perfect person.</p>
<p>[Gomez]
The truth is, I&rsquo;ve never felt good enough.</p>
<p>Even when I&rsquo;m on stage
and in front of a crowd,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always find the one person
who doesn&rsquo;t like me, and I believe them.</p>
<p>I wanna believe in myself.</p>
<p>The people I&rsquo;ve met here in Kenya
are so giving.</p>
<p>I just want to feel like I deserve
to be here with them.</p>
<p>[cowbell ringing]</p>
<p>[Stevens] We can talk more later.</p>
<p>-About what?
-About all this.</p>
<p>-About what? Oh, I know. [sniffs]
-I know you&rsquo;re feeling sad.</p>
<p>We should do a trip quarterly.</p>
<p>Like, we should plan this,
like, every quarter.</p>
<p>We also need to talk about, like,
why you hate going home so much,</p>
<p>why you don&rsquo;t wanna turn on your phone.
Like, that&rsquo;s&ndash;</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean? So it&rsquo;s like,
what can you implement in your life</p>
<p>that makes you not anxious
to turn on your phone,</p>
<p>that makes you not sad to go home,
that makes you not hate your job.</p>
<p>-Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?
-Mmm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what&ndash; &lsquo;Cause&ndash; &lsquo;Cause you can
implement things in your life</p>
<p>that help you get through that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to live your life
constantly in that state.</p>
<p>In a way, that&rsquo;s just escaping r-reality.
Do you know what I mean? It&rsquo;s like&ndash;</p>
<p>Or is this reality?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t reality.
This is their reality. This is&ndash;</p>
<p>This can be reality a few times a year.</p>
<p>You can come and volunteer
and come for a week,</p>
<p>but this is&ndash; this isn&rsquo;t reality.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I just wanna stay here forever ‚ô™</p>

<p>-[Gomez] Who is that?
-[crew member] The paparazzi&rsquo;s blocking.</p>
<p>[Keshishian]
Oh, my God. That&rsquo;s a paparazzi carpool.</p>
<p>[crew member] Yeah, they&rsquo;re teaming up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very loud here, Chris.</p>
<p>[Chris] I know.</p>
<p>I do feel, like, a bit of a culture shock.</p>
<p>[Chris] I know.</p>
<p>-[Mingus] Selena? Good morning.
-Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>[Gomez] Hey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 7:00.
Glam&rsquo;s gonna start in a half hour.</p>
<p>[Stevens] Selly?</p>
<p>Oh no, I just had a bad dream.</p>
<p>Do you know,
I didn&rsquo;t have one bad dream in Kenya?</p>
<p>-[friend] I know, and then&ndash;
-She didn&rsquo;t have bad dreams in Kenya.</p>
<p>[Gomez] What was I saying?</p>
<p>I only heard a few things
&lsquo;cause you were, like, mumbling,</p>
<p>but, like, the one thing was, like,
&ldquo;I got coffee for everyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>-And I was like, &ldquo;Oh, wow!&rdquo;
-She said that?</p>
<p>[friend laughs] And then she was like‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[Stevens] Doing stuff like today,</p>
<p>it allows you the platform
to really be able to do trips like that</p>
<p>-and make a difference, you know?
-Mmm.</p>
<p>So even though this kind of stuff&rsquo;s hard,
it-it, you know‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Can you order some Thai? That Thai dish?</p>
<p>[Stevens]
You want Thai right now? 7:00 a.m.?</p>
<p>-Yep.
-Let&rsquo;s make it happen.</p>
<p>In the studio, it is the one, the only,
the absolute queen‚Ä¶</p>
<p>-Aw.
-‚Ä¶that is Selena Gomez!</p>
<p>[cheering]</p>
<p>-[host] So, your album&rsquo;s coming out.
-Yeah.</p>
<p>You had a break from music.</p>
<p>What did you get up to on your&ndash;
on your time off, on your break away?</p>
<p>Some stuff happened in between
that was a bit personal and hard,</p>
<p>and, um, then towards the end,
it was&ndash; it was necessary.</p>
<p>Hello, everyone. I am Selena Gomez,</p>
<p>and I am answering questions
from the Internet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selena Gomez eats Oreos with a fork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um, these are just great.
I&rsquo;m doing great things for the world.</p>
<p>Which interview number is this of the day?</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>-[Green] Four?
-[Maskell] Four already?</p>
<p>-[clamoring]
-[Barr] Selena, your single</p>
<p>makes me really emotional,
and I want to give you a hug</p>
<p>and wrap you in a blanket
and just talk about boys forever.</p>
<p>I think the point of the song
is so that I really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to sit around
and talk about boys.</p>
<p>[paparazzo] Selena, for your fans!</p>
<p>Hey, it&rsquo;s Selena Gomez,
and I&rsquo;m playing the Emoji Game.</p>
<p>But have you got a guilty-pleasure
weird food combination?</p>
<p>Popcorn and pickle juice.</p>
<p>[interviewer] What is your favorite color?</p>
<p>My favorite color is red.</p>
<p>Wizards of Waverly Place.</p>
<p>-[Gomez laughs]
-Stop.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one DJ equals one word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marshmello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-Fluffy.
-Okay. And that&rsquo;s it. Thank you.</p>
<p>-[cameraman] Thank you.
-Thanks.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay, sorry.</p>
<p>[sighs]</p>
<p>[crew member]
Those were some weird-ass questions.</p>
<p>[crew members chuckling]</p>
<p>It just seems like such a waste of time.</p>
<p>What am I doing right now?</p>
<p>[friend] Right now, we&rsquo;re getting up,
and then glam is coming in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Sorry, I was asleep. What do I have to do?</p>
<p>-[gulps, laughs]
-[scoffs]</p>
<p>The feelings that you feel
when you&rsquo;re jet-lagged&ndash;</p>
<p>You never feel them any other time.</p>
<p>-[hair stylist] What is that?
-[Marino] Like, combination of all things.</p>
<p>-[hair stylist] It&rsquo;s not even tired.
-[Marino] I know.</p>
<p>[hair stylist] You feel like you are just
in another world.</p>
<p>-[Marino] Like, in space.
-[hair stylist] Yeah.</p>
<p>[nail technician] Okay, put in.</p>
<p>[beeps]</p>
<p>[sirens wailing]</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s my ride.</p>
<p>[crew members laughing]</p>
<p>[Stevens] You know we have Marissa&rsquo;s
birthday dinner the night we get back?</p>
<p>[Gomez] The night we get back?
No. I&rsquo;d rather do what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to that. I have to do&ndash;
shoot a music video the next day.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>-I mean, it&rsquo;s a lot.
-It&rsquo;ll be good.</p>
<p>No, it is good, but you&rsquo;re gonna be
kind of messed up for a few days.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally. Just thought you would
wanna come,</p>
<p>-but that&rsquo;s just&ndash; Mmm.
-I would,</p>
<p>-but I&rsquo;m not gonna have one day to adjust.
-Okay.</p>
<p>Do you think that I&rsquo;m
complaining about my job?</p>
<p>Yeah. You felt&ndash;
You sounded like you were. [clears throat]</p>
<p>Not at all. Raquelle, I was saying
I need to get rest.</p>
<p>-Not like it&rsquo;s a bad thing. Of course I&ndash;
-[clears throat] No, it&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>It was the way you said it.
Not what you said.</p>
<p>So I was not complaining about work.</p>
<p>I was literally just complaining
that it&rsquo;d be nice if I get more sleep.</p>
<p>[clears throat]</p>
<p>[Gomez sighs]</p>
<p>-You think I&rsquo;m ungrateful for it&ndash;
-No, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ungrateful.</p>
<p>I just feel like you&rsquo;ve been so ups&ndash;
like, down, over the past couple days,</p>
<p>so I just&ndash; I&rsquo;m trying to figure out
what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But we had the most amazing week
in Africa&ndash;</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just waking up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard me tell everybody
how much I love London.</p>
<p>What else do you want from me?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>[clears throat]</p>
<p>I just was asking, &ldquo;Are you good?&rdquo;
&lsquo;Cause you don&rsquo;t seem happy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having fun.</p>
<p>Good. I&rsquo;m so happy you&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p>Like, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it to me,
so I was just asking you.</p>
<p>-I&rsquo;m so fucking done.
-[coughs]</p>
<p>Mm-mmm.</p>
<p>[chews, coughs]</p>
<p>[French fans clamoring]</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>-Hey.
-[crew chattering]</p>
<p>[NRJ interviewer] About your new album,
what would you like your fans</p>
<p>to keep in mind with this new project?</p>
<p>So I felt like it was the right time
to tell my story</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s past a point
that it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I felt like the message I needed
to release in &ldquo;Lose You to Love Me&rdquo;</p>
<p>was meant to be a song for others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s&ndash; It&rsquo;s meant to tell people
that they&rsquo;re not alone</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s such a complicated feeling,</p>
<p>and the one thing you wanna do
is be able to let it go.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a singer, you&rsquo;re an actor,
you worked into production, in fashion.</p>
<p>Uh, is there any other hat
you would like to try?</p>
<p>-In future?
-Uh,</p>
<p>uh, I gotta say I&rsquo;ll do a little bit
of all of this for a while.</p>
<p>But eventually,
when it all slows down for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to devote
most of my life to philanthropy.</p>
<p>-Okay. That&rsquo;s good for me.
-Yeah.</p>
<p>-[scoffs] Wow. Thank you.
-[laughs]</p>
<p>-Appreciate it.
-[laughs] Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Felt like you really understood.</p>
<p>All right, are we good?</p>
<p>-[NRJ employee] Yeah.
-[crew member] Getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>Can I sit, please?</p>
<p>Yeah, honey.</p>
<p>-Come on in.
-[crew member] We&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>[stylist] We&rsquo;re gonna change you.</p>
<p>-Fucking dumbest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done.
-What happened?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done. I can&rsquo;t do that anymore.
That&rsquo;s so stupid.</p>
<p>Do you know how much&ndash; how, like, cheap
it makes me feel? I&ndash;</p>
<p>-[groans]
-Yeah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s asking me questions, like,
good ones,</p>
<p>and then she didn&rsquo;t even pay attention
to what I was saying.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do that ever again.</p>
<p>I feel like a product.</p>
<p>[sighs] Oh, God.</p>
<p>-It was, like, making me angry.
-[crew member] Yeah.</p>
<p>You know&ndash; You know what it is,
is it made me feel like Disney.</p>
<p>[crew member] It&rsquo;s a trigger.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t&ndash; I just&ndash; I&rsquo;ve spent years&ndash;
years of my life trying to not be that.</p>
<p>I fucking look like a witch,</p>
<p>with the outfit doing it all&ndash;
like, the wand again.</p>
<p>-Whatever. It&rsquo;s fine.
-[Keshishian] You got it done.</p>
<p>-You don&rsquo;t have to do it again.
-Yeah.</p>
<p>[fans clamoring]</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>[cheering]</p>
<p>[fans shouting] Selena!</p>
<p>-Hi, Selena. How are you?
-Selena!</p>
<p>[clamoring]</p>
<p>[fans shouting] Selena!</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m going over there.</p>
<p>[fan 1] You&rsquo;re so pretty. Thank you.</p>
<p>-[crying]
-How are you? It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>-[crying]
-It&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;re all good.</p>
<p>-Everything&rsquo;s&ndash; Good tears, hopefully?
-Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>-Can we take a picture?
-Yeah. Let&rsquo;s take a picture.</p>
<p>[fan 2] Selena, photo, quick!</p>
<p>[cheering continues]</p>
<p>-[bodyguard] All right?
-I&rsquo;m good. Okay.</p>
<p>[sighs]</p>
<p>[grunts]</p>
<p>[Stevens] Do you want to
do your morning meds?</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>[Stevens] I know the answer,
but‚Ä¶ you should.</p>
<p>-[paparazzi chattering]
-[paparazzo] Morning, Selena!</p>
<p>[camera shutters clicking]</p>
<p>[breathes deeply]</p>
<p>[mouthing indistinctly]</p>
<p>Just attach it to the inside
or up and under.</p>
<p>[Capital FM employee]
Do you know what you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>-Nope. I work better that way.
-[laughs]</p>
<p>[chuckles] Well, we&rsquo;re gonna leave you
in the room, basically alone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing it to the mirror.
It&rsquo;s a conversation with yourself.</p>
<p>-Okay.
-Um, and then you&rsquo;ll just hear, um,</p>
<p>directions from&ndash;
coming from that speaker over there.</p>
<p>-Mkay.
-And then we&rsquo;ll just roll with it.</p>
<p>-All right.
-Awesome.</p>
<p>[Capital FM employee 2] Hi, Selena.
Could you please open the first envelope?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A song that reminds you
of being in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[clicks tongue]
I don&rsquo;t know if I have one.</p>
<p>[chuckles]</p>
<p>Envelope number two, please.</p>
<p>[clears throat]</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see when you look
in the mirror?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why are they so deep?</p>
<p>[clicks tongue] I, uh‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[sighs] I see‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Yeah. Still working on
what I see in the mirror, I suppose.</p>
<p>These are good questions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your ultimate dream?</p>
<p>My ultimate dream
is that I am able to save‚Ä¶</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s lives through‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[sighs] ‚Ä¶through something,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a song, music, or if it&rsquo;s me,
just speaking about the troubles</p>
<p>and the trials and tribulations
that I had gone through.</p>
<p>That I could be a voice for others
who maybe don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>or what they&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>Um, that&rsquo;s what I hope. [chuckles]</p>
<p>Incredible. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>[Gomez] There is a girl
who&rsquo;s crippled by anxiety</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t move
when she looks in the mirror.</p>
<p>She smiles when everyone is looking
but cries when she&rsquo;s alone.</p>
<p>She hides because she&rsquo;s terrified
to show herself.</p>
<p>My world is so empty.</p>
<p>My world is so big and cold.</p>
<p>I want joy and hope.</p>
<p>Clean air where I can finally breathe.</p>
<p>What has been is not what will be.</p>
<p>Why is everyone
wearing a T-shirt that says &ldquo;rare&rdquo;?</p>
<p>[Fallon] Rare is out now.
Rolling Stone loves it.</p>
<p>Billboard calls you triumphant.</p>
<p>Variety said Rare&rsquo;s one of the best
pop albums to be released</p>
<p>-in recent memory.
-[radio host] This is Selena&rsquo;s</p>
<p>third studio album
and her first in four years.</p>
<p>The singer saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s by far
the work I&rsquo;m most proud of to date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Gomez] Kenya was like a dream.</p>
<p>When I even asked about boys,
just out of curiosity</p>
<p>they were like, &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-[chuckling]
-&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just&rdquo;&ndash;</p>
<p>You know, they giggled. They&rsquo;re like,
&ldquo;We want to do what we want to do,</p>
<p>and then it will happen.&rdquo;
And I was like, preach.</p>
<p>-[laughs]
-That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I mean, these girls were more confident
than I was, and it was beautiful to see.</p>
<p>And at times&ndash; I&rsquo;m very, um‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I overthink</p>
<p>and I feel like if I&rsquo;m not having some
sort of aspect of my life</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m giving, it&rsquo;s not&ndash;
It makes me f&ndash; It just makes&ndash;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make me feel good.
It makes me feel</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m just taking, taking, taking
and people should give me this</p>
<p>and give me that, um,</p>
<p>even though that&rsquo;s not my personality.</p>
<p>So now I want to make it
a quarterly thing.</p>
<p>I have a dinner with Aleen and Zack,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna discuss, you know,</p>
<p>-my goals.
-[Keshishian] Yeah.</p>
<p>Can we talk, for a minute, about the trip
and the WE organization,</p>
<p>-and why don&rsquo;t you start?
-[Gomez] Mmm.</p>
<p>Like just tell us a little bit
about what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>I would love to find a way
to build a curriculum</p>
<p>that can be taught in schools.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much to be said about
being connected with your emotions</p>
<p>and having that intelligence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of like&ndash; I mean,
you&rsquo;re kinda fucked</p>
<p>-if you don&rsquo;t understand it.
-You also&ndash;</p>
<p>You have no compassion,
you have no empathy.</p>
<p>-Yeah.
-You have&ndash; You have no way</p>
<p>of connecting with people
because you don&rsquo;t even know how to.</p>
<p>This is sort of the thing
that you want to be.</p>
<p>-It-it-it&rsquo;s something&ndash;
-You wanna do.</p>
<p>Very, very important to me.</p>
<p>[radio host] I want to start today
with discussion over a deadly new virus</p>
<p>that some health officials say
might affect thousands</p>
<p>or even millions of people this year.</p>
<p>The second US case
announced just this morning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new strain
of what&rsquo;s called coronavirus.</p>
<p>[newscaster]
Major cities across the country</p>
<p>are looking more like ghost towns.</p>
<p>[newscaster 2] Seemingly overnight,
much of our daily lives have been</p>
<p>put on hold.</p>
<p>All Americans now trying to navigate
what we&rsquo;re kind of calling &ldquo;a new normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[newscaster 3] Infrastructure
from large private companies</p>
<p>like Microsoft to the Department of Energy</p>
<p>and even
the Department of Treasury all hit.</p>
<p>-Lawmakers are now demanding answers‚Ä¶
-Hey Sel,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to take your blood pressure.</p>
<p>[Stevens] Hello, Winnie.</p>
<p>[newscaster]
Good evening, and thanks for joining us.</p>
<p>We begin with breaking news
about WE Charity,</p>
<p>the organization at the heart
of the latest ethics investigation</p>
<p>involving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>WE Charity is shutting down
its Canadian operations.</p>
<p>The charity ran into trouble
after the Liberal government</p>
<p>awarded it a sole-sourced,
multimillion-dollar contract to run a‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[Gomez] The accusations
against the WE Charity</p>
<p>made the work I had just planned
to do with them impossible.</p>
<p>[groans]</p>
<p>[Kielburger] The most important thing‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[Gomez] It broke my heart because
I had seen their good intentions,</p>
<p>and I had met the women in Kenya
whose lives had been changed.</p>
<p>But now it was all so complicated.</p>
<p>[Kielburger] We started the organization
back in 1995</p>
<p>when we were kids in Thornhill,
in our parent&rsquo;s basements,</p>
<p>-and, uh, this is our 25th anniversary‚Ä¶
-Can&rsquo;t listen to it. That&rsquo;s such a bummer.</p>
<p>[Gomez] I was devastated.</p>
<p>I was angry.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic was beginning
to cut us all off from friends and family.</p>
<p>And the purpose I had found in Kenya
felt like it had been taken away.</p>
<p>Then just when I thought
it couldn&rsquo;t get any worse,</p>
<p>it did.</p>
<p>[cries] I don&rsquo;t know. [sniffs]</p>
<p>My lupus.</p>
<p>[cameraman] You&rsquo;re in pain?</p>
<p>-[cries]
-Give me a hug. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>-It&rsquo;s okay.
-[cameraman] I love you.</p>
<p>I love you too. [cries]</p>
<p>[cameraman] It&rsquo;ll get better.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to figure it out.
You&rsquo;re going to feel better.</p>
<p>[friend] Is this what it felt like before,</p>
<p>when you found out you had lupus?</p>
<p>[sobs] Yeah, but I was so young.</p>
<p>Like, I have not felt it
since I was younger. [sobs]</p>
<p>-Oh, my God.
-And so, like, now, it just hurts,</p>
<p>like, in the morning when I wake up,
[sniffs]</p>
<p>I immediately start crying
because it hurts.</p>
<p>-[friend] Yeah.
-Like, everything. [sniffs]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having, like, really bad dreams
about, like, my past and stuff. [sniffs]</p>
<p>I think my past and my mistakes‚Ä¶
[sniffs] ‚Ä¶that&rsquo;s what drives me‚Ä¶</p>
<p>into depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, my whole life
since I was a kid, I have been working</p>
<p>and the only thing that I want
is, like, a family. [sniffing]</p>
<p>I just, like, wanna be, like, a mom.</p>
<p>And I told Raquelle,
I just, like, wanted to quit sometimes,</p>
<p>so I could just be happy and be normal
like everybody else. [sniffs]</p>
<p>And she was just like, &ldquo;I want you to know
that I feel like God has given you</p>
<p>this platform not to quit.&rdquo; [sniffing]</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be, like, super famous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be all that stuff.</p>
<p>But I do know that if I&rsquo;m here,
I have to use that for good.</p>
<p>I just feel stuck,
and I just want to move forward. [sniffs]</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>[Dr. Wallace] Hi, it&rsquo;s Dr. Wallace.</p>
<p>So I wanted to go over your results
with you.</p>
<p>You have a positive rheumatoid factor,</p>
<p>which means that this
is a lupus myositis rheumatoid overlap.</p>
<p>We could give you another dose
of Rituxan which would probably,</p>
<p>at the rate you handle it,</p>
<p>get rid of your joint pain
for probably a year or so.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>-[Dr. Wallace] Okay, bye.
-Bye, Dr. Wallace.</p>
<p>-Bye.
-[Dr. Wallace] Bye.</p>
<p>[sniffs]</p>
<p>[crew member] At least
that explains some of why.</p>
<p>Yeah, I-I just always feel better
when I have answers,</p>
<p>but the Rituxan was really hard to do
last time, but I-I&ndash;</p>
<p>[crew member] What is it?</p>
<p>Rituxan is a treatment
that they give you through an IV,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about four hours, five hours.</p>
<p>[stammers] It&rsquo;s really hard on your system
at first, but, um, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>[nurse] It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>They gave me something to relax
because I can&rsquo;t stand being still.</p>
<p>My nana didn&rsquo;t wanna come,
because she&rsquo;s&ndash;</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just seen me
been put through all this.</p>
<p>[Mingus] Don&rsquo;t put it in your mouth.</p>
<p>[spitting]</p>
<p>[Gomez] Why am I here?</p>
<p>Why am I alive?</p>
<p>[Mingus] There she is,
ballerina Thumbelina.</p>
<p>[Gomez] Clearly for something.</p>
<p>[Mingus]
Baby&rsquo;s first bath. Let&rsquo;s see that rat.</p>
<p>-[screams]
-[laughs]</p>
<p>[Mingus] All right, time for your bath.</p>
<p>-Shut up. [laughs]
-[laughs]</p>
<p>I love my friends, love my family.
I think I&rsquo;m a great daughter.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m a great friend.
And that means a lot to me.</p>
<p>-What is happening?
-[laughs]</p>
<p>But clearly,
I&rsquo;m still here to use whatever I have</p>
<p>to help someone else.</p>
<p>A part of my heart is still in Kenya,</p>
<p>but I felt guilty being there sometimes.</p>
<p>I-I don&rsquo;t know, I hate that.</p>
<p>I feel like I went, and I filmed,
and I experienced.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just so hard
because I feel so selfish.</p>
<p>Yes, it was great. And yes,
do I feel like I left an impact? Yes.</p>
<p>But do I feel like I&rsquo;ve done enough? No.</p>
<p>Talking to someone about mental health
in Kenya,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s‚Ä¶ [stammers] ‚Ä¶beautiful, you know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I felt like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I did it,
and I&rsquo;m such a great person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know,
this is the beginning for me.</p>
<p>Hi everyone. I&rsquo;m Selena Gomez.</p>
<p>And for World Mental Health Day,
I wanted to invite Dr. Murthy,</p>
<p>the surgeon general, to chat with me
about loneliness</p>
<p>and helping people access the resources
they need to support their mental health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very kind of you, Selena.
I&rsquo;m really glad</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re having this conversation.</p>
<p>Uh, what we were facing pre-Covid-19
was already pretty challenging</p>
<p>in terms of high rates of loneliness
and depression and anxiety,</p>
<p>and I worry that that&rsquo;s
gotten worse for a lot of people.</p>
<p>How&ndash; How do we identify loneliness
in ourselves and in others?</p>
<p>And do the symptoms of loneliness
always look like being alone?</p>
<p>[Dr. Murthy] It&rsquo;s really hard to tell.</p>
<p>Even in a crowd, you can feel
profoundly lonely.</p>
<p>And this is why the world is filled
with so many people</p>
<p>who seemingly have it all, right?</p>
<p>They, you know, are famous,
or they&rsquo;re wealthy, or they&rsquo;re powerful.</p>
<p>But what really matters is the quality
of connections that we have.</p>
<p>-Mm-hmm.
-That whenever we have interactions</p>
<p>with people where we feel like
we can&rsquo;t be ourselves,</p>
<p>that actually separates us
further and further from other people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A-And service, it turns out,
is one of the greatest antidotes</p>
<p>to loneliness that we have.</p>
<p>We reaffirm to ourselves
that we have value, uh,</p>
<p>to bring to the world,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be
going to a soup kitchen.</p>
<p>Simply by being fully present
and listening to someone.</p>
<p>We can give them something
extraordinarily powerful.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Right.</p>
<p>And so the journey, Selena,
to become more connected to ourselves,</p>
<p>to connect more deeply with other people,</p>
<p>is not a journey to somehow
transform ourselves</p>
<p>into something we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a journey to return
to who we intrinsically are,</p>
<p>-being centered at our best‚Ä¶
-Wow.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶and experiencing our greatest meaning
and fulfillment,</p>
<p>uh, when we&rsquo;re giving
and receiving that love.</p>
<p>Mic drop. I mean, that was amazing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You wanna come down with me? No?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish the sentences.</p>
<p>Strangers who would describe me as‚Ä¶
only I know that I am‚Ä¶&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangers would describe you as, like,
a warm sort of all-American girl.</p>
<p>And I think people would be surprised,</p>
<p>and only you know maybe how complex
you are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of layers to who you are.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s
a lot of different sides of you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>-Oh, sorry.
-What would you say, Ash?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a great answer.</p>
<p>[clicks tongue] Okay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe everyone has a calling?
If so, do you think I&rsquo;ve found mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, I believe everybody has a calling.</p>
<p>I think that you know what yours is,
but you don&rsquo;t always choose to walk in it.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>I think that you know
the things that fuel you</p>
<p>and give you purpose in life,
and the things that make you happy.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think you always choose that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s probably self-sabotage.</p>
<p>Yeah, tha&ndash; that&rsquo;s exactly what it is.</p>
<p>I think stuff being normal</p>
<p>-or not having chaos‚Ä¶
-Right.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶is actually uncomfortable,
&lsquo;cause if you think about it,</p>
<p>your life for so long,
from such a young age,</p>
<p>has always been chaos.</p>
<p>-Right?
-Yeah.</p>
<p>So it makes sense.
It&rsquo;s, like, more comfortable.</p>
<p>-Yeah, no that&rsquo;s nuts. Oh, it sucks.
-Yeah.</p>
<p>But the good thing is that you know.
You know the things that fulfill you.</p>
<p>-You know what makes you happy.
-[Cook] You&rsquo;re very smart.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s not
going to make you happy.</p>
<p>Aw. I love you.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a lot calmer, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so great.
She usually will move her hand.</p>
<p>-[laughs]
-[cooing]</p>
<p>I see you, and you see me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I look like your mom.</p>
<p>[gasps] Look at my mom.</p>
<p>[friend] Oh, my goodness.</p>
<p>Do I look like my mom?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>-What?
-[Gomez] Oh, the bangs.</p>
<p>Look at her marrying my stepdad, Brian.</p>
<p>-Yeah, he&rsquo;s been such a great dad to me.
-[Mingus] Aw.</p>
<p>-That is so sweet. So cute.
-[Cosme] Aw. That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>-Selena? Hey.
-Hi.</p>
<p>-How&rsquo;s it going, girl?
-[friend] Good, how are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t bite.</p>
<p>Hey. [kissing]</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s my youngest.</p>
<p>-That&rsquo;s my cousin&rsquo;s daughter‚Ä¶
-Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶and my other two aren&rsquo;t here
because my son has leukemia.</p>
<p>-Oh, no.
-So he stayed in at his other mom&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>and his sister wanted to stay with him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>-So we left them there.
-[child babbles]</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that? Are you trying to scare me?</p>
<p>Do you know who this is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Selena Gomez.</p>
<p>My name is Selena.</p>
<p>-The one that you hear the songs of?
-[laughs]</p>
<p>-Yeah.
-[gasps]</p>
<p>-[screaming]
-[laughing]</p>
<p>[Gomez laughing]</p>
<p>[screams]</p>
<p>[Gomez chuckles]</p>
<p>-[friend] She&rsquo;s my dramatic one.
-[girl screams]</p>
<p>-Well, that was me. Aw.
-[laughs]</p>
<p>[friend] Come here, baba. No?</p>
<p>-Yeah, you&rsquo;re the alpha male.
-I didn&rsquo;t know she was real.</p>
<p>Yes, she&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>-Mommy went to school with her.
-[gasps]</p>
<p>She lived right down the street from me.</p>
<p>-[screams]
-Mommy grew up with her.</p>
<p>Can I have a hug?</p>
<p>-[laughs]
-Yeah. [laughs]</p>
<p>Does that make you happy?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>[laughs]</p>
<p>-[Gomez] Just wanted to say hello.
-Well, thank you. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>-It was good seeing you.
-Of course. It was so good to see you.</p>
<p>-I&rsquo;m glad everything&rsquo;s good with you.
-Yeah.</p>
<p>Went better. Trust me,
it was a little scary at that point,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause I grew up with you, I knew.
So, to see you go through that was hard.</p>
<p>Yeah. Thank you, I do feel better.</p>
<p>Oh, we love y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>-Okay bye, honey. Bye-bye.
-Say &ldquo;Bye.&rdquo; Say &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Gomez] When you&rsquo;re struggling
with your mental health,</p>
<p>the essential part of it
is knowing what to do</p>
<p>and recognizing that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m not ashamed of.</p>
<p>I had to relearn things
that completely fell out of my mind.</p>
<p>I-It was like, &ldquo;Hey,
you&rsquo;re not a bad person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a gross person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not crazy. You&rsquo;re not any of this</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have to deal with this.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a lot,
but this is the reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I found having a relationship
with bipolar and myself, it&rsquo;s‚Ä¶</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just making it my friend now.</p>
<p>I think that I needed to go through that
to be who I am,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna keep going through it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m really happy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at peace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m angry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m full of doubt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a work in progress.</p>
<p>I am enough.</p>
<p>I am Selena.</p>
<p>-[producer] Thank you for having us today.
-[Gomez] Of course.</p>
<p>I wanted people to understand
that what I did for this process</p>
<p>was giving you guys, like,
my heart essentially,</p>
<p>and see how you would take my words
and put them into a record.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done that before.
Have you guys?</p>
<p>-No, I&ndash; Yeah.
-Diary entries, journal entries?</p>
<p>-No, that&rsquo;s super intimate.
-[producer 2] &lsquo;Course.</p>
<p>[producer 1] I&rsquo;m happy we didn&rsquo;t
butcher your journal entries.</p>
<p>-[all laugh]
-No, you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
