    <p>The following is a conversation with Noam Chomsky.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s truly one of the great minds of our time</p>
<p>and is one of the most cited scholars</p>
<p>in the history of our civilization.</p>
<p>He has spent over 60 years at MIT</p>
<p>and recently also joined the University of Arizona,</p>
<p>where we met for this conversation.</p>
<p>But it was at MIT about four and a half years ago</p>
<p>when I first met Noam.</p>
<p>My first few days there,</p>
<p>I remember getting into an elevator at Stata Center,</p>
<p>pressing the button for whatever floor,</p>
<p>looking up and realizing it was just me and Noam Chomsky</p>
<p>riding the elevator,</p>
<p>just me and one of the seminal figures of linguistics,</p>
<p>cognitive science, philosophy,</p>
<p>and political thought in the past century, if not ever.</p>
<p>I tell that silly story because I think life is made up</p>
<p>of funny little defining moments that you never forget</p>
<p>for reasons that may be too poetic to try and explain.</p>
<p>That was one of mine.</p>
<p>Noam has been an inspiration to me and millions of others.</p>
<p>It was truly an honor for me</p>
<p>to sit down with him in Arizona.</p>
<p>I traveled there just for this conversation.</p>
<p>And in a rare, heartbreaking moment,</p>
<p>after everything was set up and tested,</p>
<p>the camera was moved and accidentally,</p>
<p>the recording button was pressed, stopping the recording.</p>
<p>So I have good audio of both of us, but no video of Noam.</p>
<p>Just the video of me and my sleep deprived but excited face</p>
<p>that I get to keep as a reminder of my failures.</p>
<p>Most people just listen to this audio version</p>
<p>for the podcast as opposed to watching it on YouTube.</p>
<p>But still, it&rsquo;s heartbreaking for me.</p>
<p>I hope you understand and still enjoy this conversation</p>
<p>as much as I did.</p>
<p>The depth of intellect that Noam showed</p>
<p>and his willingness to truly listen to me,</p>
<p>a silly looking Russian in a suit.</p>
<p>It was humbling and something I&rsquo;m deeply grateful for.</p>
<p>As some of you know, this podcast is a side project for me,</p>
<p>where my main journey and dream is to build AI systems</p>
<p>that do some good for the world.</p>
<p>This latter effort takes up most of my time,</p>
<p>but for the moment has been mostly private.</p>
<p>But the former, the podcast,</p>
<p>is something I put my heart and soul into.</p>
<p>And I hope you feel that, even when I screw things up.</p>
<p>I recently started doing ads</p>
<p>at the end of the introduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell,</p>
<p>and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,</p>
<p>no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations called The First,</p>
<p>best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries</p>
<p>and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,</p>
<p>which means the donated money</p>
<p>is used to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store,</p>
<p>Google Play and use code LexPodcast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>which again is an organization that I&rsquo;ve personally seen</p>
<p>inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Noam Chomsky.</p>
<p>I apologize for the absurd philosophical question,</p>
<p>but if an alien species were to visit Earth,</p>
<p>do you think we would be able to find a common language</p>
<p>or protocol of communication with them?</p>
<p>There are arguments to the effect that we could.</p>
<p>In fact, one of them was Marv Minsky&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Back about 20 or 30 years ago,</p>
<p>he performed a brief experiment with a student of his,</p>
<p>Dan Bobrow, they essentially ran</p>
<p>the simplest possible touring machines,</p>
<p>just free to see what would happen.</p>
<p>And most of them crashed,</p>
<p>either got into an infinite loop or stopped.</p>
<p>The few that persisted,</p>
<p>essentially gave something like arithmetic.</p>
<p>And his conclusion from that was that</p>
<p>if some alien species developed higher intelligence,</p>
<p>they would at least have arithmetic,</p>
<p>they would at least have what the simplest computer would do.</p>
<p>And in fact, he didn&rsquo;t know that at the time,</p>
<p>but the core principles of natural language</p>
<p>are based on operations which yield something</p>
<p>like arithmetic in the limiting case, in the minimal case.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s conceivable that a mode of communication</p>
<p>could be established based on the core properties</p>
<p>of human language and the core properties of arithmetic,</p>
<p>which maybe are universally shared.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s conceivable.</p>
<p>What is the structure of that language,</p>
<p>of language as an internal system inside our mind</p>
<p>versus an external system as it&rsquo;s expressed?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an alternative,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s two different concepts of language.</p>
<p>Different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple fact that there&rsquo;s something about you,</p>
<p>a trait of yours, part of the organism, you,</p>
<p>that determines that you&rsquo;re talking English</p>
<p>and not Tagalog, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>So there is an inner system.</p>
<p>It determines the sound and meaning</p>
<p>of the infinite number of expressions of your language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s localized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not on your foot, obviously, it&rsquo;s in your brain.</p>
<p>If you look more closely, it&rsquo;s in specific configurations</p>
<p>of your brain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s essentially like the internal structure</p>
<p>of your laptop, whatever programs it has are in there.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things you can do with language,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a marginal thing, in fact,</p>
<p>is use it to externalize what&rsquo;s in your head.</p>
<p>Actually, most of your use of language</p>
<p>is thought, internal thought.</p>
<p>But you can do what you and I are now doing.</p>
<p>We can externalize it.</p>
<p>Well, the set of things that we&rsquo;re externalizing</p>
<p>are an external system.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re noises in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And you can call that language</p>
<p>in some other sense of the word.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not a set of alternatives.</p>
<p>These are just different concepts.</p>
<p>So how deep do the roots of language go in our brain?</p>
<p>Our mind, is it yet another feature like vision,</p>
<p>or is it something more fundamental</p>
<p>from which everything else springs in the human mind?</p>
<p>Well, in a way, it&rsquo;s like vision.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about our genetic endowment</p>
<p>that determines that we have a mammalian</p>
<p>rather than an insect visual system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something in our genetic endowment</p>
<p>that determines that we have a human language faculty.</p>
<p>No other organism has anything remotely similar.</p>
<p>So in that sense, it&rsquo;s internal.</p>
<p>Now there is a long tradition,</p>
<p>which I think is valid going back centuries</p>
<p>to the early scientific revolution,</p>
<p>at least that holds that language</p>
<p>is the sort of the core of human cognitive nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the source, it&rsquo;s the mode for constructing thoughts</p>
<p>and expressing them.</p>
<p>That is what forms thought.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got fundamental creative capacities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free, independent, unbounded, and so on.</p>
<p>And undoubtedly, I think the basis</p>
<p>for our creative capacities</p>
<p>and the other remarkable human capacities</p>
<p>that lead to the unique achievements</p>
<p>and not so great achievements of the species.</p>
<p>The capacity to think and reason,</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s deeply linked with language?</p>
<p>Do you think the way we,</p>
<p>the internal language system is essentially the mechanism</p>
<p>by which we also reason internally?</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly the mechanism by which we reason.</p>
<p>There may also be other fact,</p>
<p>there are undoubtedly other faculties involved in reasoning.</p>
<p>We have a kind of scientific faculty,</p>
<p>nobody knows what it is,</p>
<p>but whatever it is that enables us</p>
<p>to pursue certain lines of endeavor and inquiry</p>
<p>and to decide what makes sense and doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>and to achieve a certain degree</p>
<p>of understanding of the world,</p>
<p>that uses language, but goes beyond it.</p>
<p>Just as using our capacity for arithmetic</p>
<p>is not the same as having the capacity.</p>
<p>The idea of capacity, our biology, evolution,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about it defining essentially our capacity,</p>
<p>our limit and our scope.</p>
<p>Can you try to define what limit and scope are?</p>
<p>And the bigger question,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible to find the limit</p>
<p>of human cognition?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s commonly believed, most scientists believe</p>
<p>that human intelligence can answer any question</p>
<p>in principle.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very strange belief.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re biological organisms,</p>
<p>which are not angels,</p>
<p>then our capacities ought to have scope</p>
<p>and limits which are interrelated.</p>
<p>Can you define those two terms?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s take a concrete example.</p>
<p>Your genetic endowment determines</p>
<p>that you can have a male in visual system,</p>
<p>arms and legs and so on,</p>
<p>but it therefore become a rich, complex organism.</p>
<p>But if you look at that same genetic endowment,</p>
<p>it prevents you from developing in other directions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no kind of experience</p>
<p>which would yield the embryo</p>
<p>to develop an insect visual system</p>
<p>or to develop wings instead of arms.</p>
<p>So the very endowment that confers richness and complexity</p>
<p>also sets bounds on what can be attained.</p>
<p>Now, I assume that our cognitive capacities</p>
<p>are part of the organic world.</p>
<p>Therefore, they should have the same properties.</p>
<p>If they had no built in capacity</p>
<p>to develop a rich and complex structure,</p>
<p>we would understand nothing.</p>
<p>Just as if your genetic endowment</p>
<p>did not compel you to develop arms and legs,</p>
<p>you would just be some kind of random amoeboid creature</p>
<p>with no structure at all.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s plausible to assume that there are limits</p>
<p>and I think we even have some evidence as to what they are.</p>
<p>So for example, there&rsquo;s a classic moment</p>
<p>in the history of science at the time of Newton.</p>
<p>There was a from Galileo to Newton modern science</p>
<p>developed on a fundamental assumption</p>
<p>which Newton also accepted.</p>
<p>Namely that the world is an entire universe</p>
<p>is a mechanical object.</p>
<p>And by mechanical, they meant something like</p>
<p>the kinds of artifacts that were being developed</p>
<p>by skilled artisans all over Europe,</p>
<p>the gears, levers and so on.</p>
<p>And their belief was well,</p>
<p>the world is just a more complex variant of this.</p>
<p>Newton, to his astonishment and distress,</p>
<p>proved that there are no machines,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s interaction without contact.</p>
<p>His contemporaries like Leibniz and Huygens</p>
<p>just dismissed this as returning to the mysticism</p>
<p>of the neo scholastics.</p>
<p>And Newton agreed.</p>
<p>He said it is totally absurd.</p>
<p>No person of any scientific intelligence</p>
<p>could ever accept this for a moment.</p>
<p>In fact, he spent the rest of his life</p>
<p>trying to get around it somehow,</p>
<p>as did many other scientists.</p>
<p>That was the very criterion of intelligibility</p>
<p>for say Galileo or Newton.</p>
<p>Theory did not produce an intelligible world</p>
<p>unless you could duplicate it in a machine.</p>
<p>He showed you can&rsquo;t, there are no machines, any.</p>
<p>Finally, after a long struggle, took a long time,</p>
<p>scientists just accepted this as common sense.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a significant moment.</p>
<p>That means they abandoned the search</p>
<p>for an intelligible world.</p>
<p>And the great philosophers of the time</p>
<p>understood that very well.</p>
<p>So for example, David Hume in his encomium to Newton</p>
<p>wrote that who was the greatest thinker ever and so on.</p>
<p>He said that he unveiled many of the secrets of nature,</p>
<p>but by showing the imperfections</p>
<p>of the mechanical philosophy, mechanical science,</p>
<p>he left us with, he showed that there are mysteries</p>
<p>which ever will remain.</p>
<p>And science just changed its goals.</p>
<p>It abandoned the mysteries.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t solve it, we&rsquo;ll put it aside.</p>
<p>We only look for intelligible theories.</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s theories were intelligible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what they described wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, Locke said the same thing.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re basically right.</p>
<p>And if so, that showed something</p>
<p>about the limits of human cognition.</p>
<p>We cannot attain the goal of understanding the world,</p>
<p>of finding an intelligible world.</p>
<p>This mechanical philosophy Galileo to Newton,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good case that can be made</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s our instinctive conception of how things work.</p>
<p>So if say infants are tested with things that,</p>
<p>if this moves and then this moves,</p>
<p>they kind of invent something that must be invisible</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in between them that&rsquo;s making them move and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, we like physical contact.</p>
<p>Something about our brain seeks.</p>
<p>Makes us want a world like that.</p>
<p>Just like it wants a world</p>
<p>that has regular geometric figures.</p>
<p>So for example, Descartes pointed this out</p>
<p>that if you have an infant</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s never seen a triangle before and you draw a triangle,</p>
<p>the infant will see a distorted triangle,</p>
<p>not whatever crazy figure it actually is.</p>
<p>Three lines not coming quite together,</p>
<p>one of them a little bit curved and so on.</p>
<p>We just impose a conception of the world</p>
<p>in terms of geometric, perfect geometric objects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now been shown that goes way beyond that.</p>
<p>That if you show on a tachistoscope,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a couple of lights shining,</p>
<p>you do it three or four times in a row.</p>
<p>What people actually see is a rigid object in motion,</p>
<p>not whatever&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>We all know that from a television set basically.</p>
<p>So that gives us hints of potential limits</p>
<p>to our cognition.</p>
<p>I think it does, but it&rsquo;s a very contested view.</p>
<p>If you do a poll among scientists,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible we can understand anything.</p>
<p>Let me ask and give me a chance with this.</p>
<p>So I just spent a day at a company called Neuralink</p>
<p>and what they do is try to design</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the brain machine, brain computer interface.</p>
<p>So they try to do thousands readings in the brain,</p>
<p>be able to read what the neurons are firing</p>
<p>and then stimulate back, so two way.</p>
<p>Do you think their dream is to expand the capacity</p>
<p>of the brain to attain information,</p>
<p>sort of increase the bandwidth</p>
<p>of which we can search Google kind of thing?</p>
<p>Do you think our cognitive capacity might be expanded</p>
<p>our linguistic capacity, our ability to reason</p>
<p>might be expanded by adding a machine into the picture?</p>
<p>Can be expanded in a certain sense,</p>
<p>but a sense that was known thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>A book expands your cognitive capacity.</p>
<p>Okay, so this could expand it too.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not a fundamental expansion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not totally new things could be understood.</p>
<p>Well, nothing that goes beyond</p>
<p>their native cognitive capacities.</p>
<p>Just like you can&rsquo;t turn the visual system</p>
<p>into an insect system.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the thought is,</p>
<p>the thought is perhaps you can&rsquo;t directly,</p>
<p>but you can map sort of.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t, but we already,</p>
<p>we know that without this experiment.</p>
<p>You could map what a bee sees and present it in a form</p>
<p>so that we could follow it.</p>
<p>In fact, every bee scientist does that.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s something greater than bees</p>
<p>that we can map and then all of a sudden discover something,</p>
<p>be able to understand a quantum world, quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>be able to start to be able to make sense.</p>
<p>Students at MIT study and understand quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>But they always reduce it to the infant, the physical.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s thing, that may be another area</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s just a limit to understanding.</p>
<p>We understand the theories,</p>
<p>but the world that it describes doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>So, you know, the experiment, Schrodinger&rsquo;s cat,</p>
<p>for example, can understand the theory,</p>
<p>but as Schrodinger pointed out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an unintelligible world.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why Einstein</p>
<p>was always very skeptical about quantum theory,</p>
<p>was that he described himself as a classical realist,</p>
<p>in one&rsquo;s intelligibility.</p>
<p>He has something in common with infants in that way.</p>
<p>So, back to linguistics.</p>
<p>If you could humor me, what are the most beautiful</p>
<p>or fascinating aspects of language</p>
<p>or ideas in linguistics or cognitive science</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve seen in a lifetime of studying language</p>
<p>and studying the human mind?</p>
<p>Well, I think the deepest property of language</p>
<p>and puzzling property that&rsquo;s been discovered</p>
<p>is what is sometimes called structure dependence.</p>
<p>We now understand it pretty well,</p>
<p>but it was puzzling for a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a concrete example.</p>
<p>So, suppose you say the guy who fixed the car</p>
<p>carefully packed his tools, it&rsquo;s ambiguous.</p>
<p>He could fix the car carefully or carefully pack his tools.</p>
<p>Suppose you put carefully in front,</p>
<p>carefully the guy who fixed the car packed his tools,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s carefully packed, not carefully fixed.</p>
<p>And in fact, you do that even if it makes no sense.</p>
<p>So, suppose you say carefully,</p>
<p>the guy who fixed the car is tall.</p>
<p>You have to interpret it as carefully he&rsquo;s tall,</p>
<p>even though that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And notice that that&rsquo;s a very puzzling fact</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re relating carefully</p>
<p>not to the linearly closest verb,</p>
<p>but to the linearly more remote verb.</p>
<p>A linear closeness is an easy computation,</p>
<p>but here you&rsquo;re doing a much more,</p>
<p>what looks like a more complex computation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing something that&rsquo;s taking you essentially</p>
<p>to the more remote thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now, if you look at the actual structure</p>
<p>of the sentence, where the phrases are and so on,</p>
<p>turns out you&rsquo;re picking out the structurally closest thing,</p>
<p>but the linearly more remote thing.</p>
<p>But notice that what&rsquo;s linear is 100% of what you hear.</p>
<p>You never hear structure, can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So, what you&rsquo;re doing is,</p>
<p>and certainly this is universal, all constructions,</p>
<p>all languages, and what we&rsquo;re compelled to do</p>
<p>is carry out what looks like the more complex computation</p>
<p>on material that we never hear,</p>
<p>and we ignore 100% of what we hear</p>
<p>and the simplest computation.</p>
<p>By now, there&rsquo;s even a neural basis for this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somewhat understood,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s good theories by now</p>
<p>that explain why it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a deep insight into the surprising nature of language</p>
<p>with many consequences.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about a field of machine learning,</p>
<p>deep learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of progress in neural networks based,</p>
<p>neural network based machine learning in the recent decade.</p>
<p>Of course, neural network research goes back many decades.</p>
<p>What do you think are the limits of deep learning,</p>
<p>of neural network based machine learning?</p>
<p>Well, to give a real answer to that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to understand the exact processes</p>
<p>that are taking place, and those are pretty opaque.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to prove a theorem</p>
<p>about what can be done and what can&rsquo;t be done,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s reasonably clear.</p>
<p>I mean, putting technicalities aside,</p>
<p>what deep learning is doing</p>
<p>is taking huge numbers of examples</p>
<p>and finding some patterns.</p>
<p>Okay, that could be interesting in some areas it is,</p>
<p>but we have to ask here a certain question.</p>
<p>Is it engineering or is it science?</p>
<p>Engineering in the sense of just trying</p>
<p>to build something that&rsquo;s useful,</p>
<p>or science in the sense that it&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to understand something about elements of the world.</p>
<p>So, take, say, a Google parser.</p>
<p>We can ask that question.</p>
<p>Is it useful, yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty useful.</p>
<p>I use a Google translator, so on engineering grounds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of worth having, like a bulldozer.</p>
<p>Does it tell you anything about human language?</p>
<p>Zero, nothing, and in fact, it&rsquo;s very striking.</p>
<p>From the very beginning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just totally remote from science.</p>
<p>So, what is a Google parser doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking an enormous text,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the Wall Street Journal corpus,</p>
<p>and asking how close can we come</p>
<p>to getting the right description</p>
<p>of every sentence in the corpus.</p>
<p>Well, every sentence in the corpus</p>
<p>is essentially an experiment.</p>
<p>Each sentence that you produce is an experiment</p>
<p>which says, am I a grammatical sentence?</p>
<p>The answer is usually yes.</p>
<p>So, most of the stuff in the corpus</p>
<p>is grammatical sentences.</p>
<p>But now, ask yourself, is there any science</p>
<p>which takes random experiments</p>
<p>which are carried out for no reason whatsoever</p>
<p>and tries to find out something from them?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re, say, a chemistry PhD student,</p>
<p>you wanna get a thesis, can you say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m just gonna mix a lot of things together,</p>
<p>no purpose, and maybe I&rsquo;ll find something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be laughed out of the department.</p>
<p>Science tries to find critical experiments,</p>
<p>ones that answer some theoretical question.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t care about coverage of millions of experiments.</p>
<p>So, it just begins by being very remote from science</p>
<p>and it continues like that.</p>
<p>So, the usual question that&rsquo;s asked about,</p>
<p>say, a Google parser is how well does it do,</p>
<p>or some parser, how well does it do on a corpus?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another question that&rsquo;s never asked.</p>
<p>How well does it do on something</p>
<p>that violates all the rules of language?</p>
<p>So, for example, take the structure dependence case</p>
<p>that I mentioned.</p>
<p>Suppose there was a language</p>
<p>in which you used linear proximity</p>
<p>as the mode of interpretation.</p>
<p>These deep learning would work very easily on that.</p>
<p>In fact, much more easily on an actual language.</p>
<p>Is that a success?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a failure from a scientific point of view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a failure.</p>
<p>It shows that we&rsquo;re not discovering</p>
<p>the nature of the system at all,</p>
<p>because it does just as well or even better</p>
<p>on things that violate the structure of the system.</p>
<p>And it goes on from there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an argument against doing it.</p>
<p>It is useful to have devices like this.</p>
<p>So, yes, so neural networks are kind of approximators</p>
<p>that look, there&rsquo;s echoes of the behavioral debates, right?</p>
<p>Behavioralism.</p>
<p>More than echoes.</p>
<p>Many of the people in deep learning</p>
<p>say they&rsquo;ve vindicated Terry Sanyosky, for example,</p>
<p>in his recent books,</p>
<p>as this vindicates Skinnerian behaviors.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it.</p>
<p>Yes, but I think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>actually fundamentally different</p>
<p>when the data set is huge.</p>
<p>But your point is extremely well taken.</p>
<p>But do you think we can learn, approximate</p>
<p>that interesting complex structure of language</p>
<p>with neural networks</p>
<p>that will somehow help us understand the science?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I mean, you find patterns that you hadn&rsquo;t noticed,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, could be.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s very much like a kind of linguistics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s done, what&rsquo;s called corpus linguistics.</p>
<p>When you, suppose you have some language</p>
<p>where all the speakers have died out,</p>
<p>but you have records.</p>
<p>So you just look at the records</p>
<p>and see what you can figure out from that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much better than,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much better to have actual speakers</p>
<p>where you can do critical experiments.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re all dead, you can&rsquo;t do them.</p>
<p>So you have to try to see what you can find out</p>
<p>from just looking at the data that&rsquo;s around.</p>
<p>You can learn things.</p>
<p>Actually, paleoanthropology is very much like that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do a critical experiment on</p>
<p>what happened two million years ago.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of forced just to take what data&rsquo;s around</p>
<p>and see what you can figure out from it.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s a serious study.</p>
<p>So let me venture into another whole body of work</p>
<p>and philosophical question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that evil in society arises from institutions,</p>
<p>not inherently from our nature.</p>
<p>Do you think most human beings are good,</p>
<p>they have good intent?</p>
<p>Or do most have the capacity for intentional evil</p>
<p>that depends on their upbringing,</p>
<p>depends on their environment, on context?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that they don&rsquo;t arise from our nature.</p>
<p>Anything we do arises from our nature.</p>
<p>And the fact that we have certain institutions, not others,</p>
<p>is one mode in which human nature has expressed itself.</p>
<p>But as far as we know,</p>
<p>human nature could yield many different kinds</p>
<p>of institutions.</p>
<p>The particular ones that have developed</p>
<p>have to do with historical contingency,</p>
<p>who conquered whom, and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not rooted in our nature</p>
<p>in the sense that they&rsquo;re essential to our nature.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s commonly argued that these days</p>
<p>that something like market systems</p>
<p>is just part of our nature.</p>
<p>But we know from a huge amount of evidence</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of other structures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a particular fact of a moment of modern history.</p>
<p>Others have argued that the roots of classical liberalism</p>
<p>actually argue that what&rsquo;s called sometimes</p>
<p>an instinct for freedom,</p>
<p>the instinct to be free of domination</p>
<p>by illegitimate authority is the core of our nature.</p>
<p>That would be the opposite of this.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We just know that human nature can accommodate both kinds.</p>
<p>If you look back at your life,</p>
<p>is there a moment in your intellectual life</p>
<p>or life in general that jumps from memory</p>
<p>that brought you happiness</p>
<p>that you would love to relive again?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Falling in love, having children.</p>
<p>What about, so you have put forward into the world</p>
<p>a lot of incredible ideas in linguistics,</p>
<p>in cognitive science, in terms of ideas</p>
<p>that just excites you when it first came to you</p>
<p>that you would love to relive those moments.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, when you make a discovery</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s exciting,</p>
<p>like, say, even the observation of structure dependence</p>
<p>and on from that, the explanation for it.</p>
<p>But the major things just seem like common sense.</p>
<p>So if you go back to take your question</p>
<p>about external and internal language,</p>
<p>you go back to, say, the 1950s,</p>
<p>almost entirely languages regarded an external object,</p>
<p>something outside the mind.</p>
<p>It just seemed obvious that that can&rsquo;t be true.</p>
<p>Like I said, there&rsquo;s something about you</p>
<p>that determines you&rsquo;re talking English,</p>
<p>not Swahili or something.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not really a discovery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just an observation, what&rsquo;s transparent.</p>
<p>You might say it&rsquo;s kind of like the 17th century,</p>
<p>the beginnings of modern science, 17th century.</p>
<p>They came from being willing to be puzzled</p>
<p>about things that seemed obvious.</p>
<p>So it seems obvious that a heavy ball of lead</p>
<p>will fall faster than a light ball of lead.</p>
<p>But Galileo was not impressed by the fact</p>
<p>that it seemed obvious.</p>
<p>So he wanted to know if it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>They carried out experiments, actually thought experiments,</p>
<p>never actually carried them out,</p>
<p>which that can&rsquo;t be true.</p>
<p>And out of things like that, observations of that kind,</p>
<p>why does a ball fall to the ground instead of rising,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, seems obvious, till you start thinking about it,</p>
<p>because why does steam rise, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And I think the beginnings of modern linguistics,</p>
<p>roughly in the 50s, are kind of like that,</p>
<p>just being willing to be puzzled about phenomena</p>
<p>that looked, from some point of view, obvious.</p>
<p>And for example, a kind of doctrine,</p>
<p>almost official doctrine of structural linguistics</p>
<p>in the 50s was that languages can differ</p>
<p>from one another in arbitrary ways,</p>
<p>and each one has to be studied on its own</p>
<p>without any presuppositions.</p>
<p>In fact, there were similar views among biologists</p>
<p>about the nature of organisms, that each one&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so different when you look at them</p>
<p>that almost anything, you could be almost anything.</p>
<p>Well, in both domains, it&rsquo;s been learned</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s very far from true.</p>
<p>There are narrow constraints on what could be an organism</p>
<p>or what could be a language.</p>
<p>But these are, that&rsquo;s just the nature of inquiry.</p>
<p>Inquiry. Science in general, yeah, inquiry.</p>
<p>So one of the peculiar things about us human beings</p>
<p>is our mortality.</p>
<p>Ernest Becker explored it in general.</p>
<p>Do you ponder the value of mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>I used to when I was about 12 years old.</p>
<p>I wondered, I didn&rsquo;t care much about my own mortality,</p>
<p>but I was worried about the fact that</p>
<p>if my consciousness disappeared,</p>
<p>would the entire universe disappear?</p>
<p>That was frightening.</p>
<p>Did you ever find an answer to that question?</p>
<p>No, nobody&rsquo;s ever found an answer,</p>
<p>but I stopped being bothered by it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like Woody Allen in one of his films,</p>
<p>you may recall, he starts, he goes to a shrink</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s a child and the shrink asks him,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your problem?</p>
<p>He says, I just learned that the universe is expanding.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t handle that.</p>
<p>And then another absurd question is,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of our existence here,</p>
<p>our life on Earth, our brief little moment in time?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something we answer by our own activities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no general answer.</p>
<p>We determine what the meaning of it is.</p>
<p>The action determine the meaning.</p>
<p>Meaning in the sense of significance,</p>
<p>not meaning in the sense that chair means this.</p>
<p>But the significance of your life is something you create.</p>
<p>No, thank you so much for talking to me today.</p>
<p>It was a huge honor.</p>
