    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 20, The Early Germanic Tribes.</p>
<p>In this episode, I&rsquo;m going to look at the emergence of the first Germanic tribes in</p>
<p>Northern Europe.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll be looking at the peoples and the languages which gave birth to English.</p>
<p>That means that from this point forward in the podcast, we&rsquo;ll be establishing a continuum</p>
<p>from the original Germanic language spoken by those Northern European tribes, to the</p>
<p>Germanic dialects spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, to Middle English, and then ultimately, Modern</p>
<p>English.</p>
<p>So, this is really the prelude to Old English, and that means that it&rsquo;s the last chapter</p>
<p>in our look at the development of Pre-English.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;ll continue to look at outside influences like Latin and French and Old Norse,</p>
<p>but from this point on, we&rsquo;ll be looking at those languages as outside influences on</p>
<p>this continuum from the original Germanic language to Modern English.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me remind you that the website for the podcast is historyofenglishpodcast.com,</p>
<p>and my email address is kevin at historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And also, I wanted to remind you that I do have a Twitter account, which is at English</p>
<p>Hist Pod, that&rsquo;s H-I-S-T P-O-D.</p>
<p>And also, I&rsquo;m still working on that alphabet series.</p>
<p>I have everything recorded, I just need to edit it now and figure out how I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>make it available.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ll keep you updated on that, and hopefully that&rsquo;ll be available very shortly.</p>
<p>Now, in this episode, I want to examine where the Germanic tribes came from, and how they</p>
<p>came to occupy Central Europe east of the Rhine.</p>
<p>Now, back in episode 11, I looked at the emergence of the Ussatavo culture near the Black Sea,</p>
<p>which many linguists believe to be the link between the original Indo-Europeans and the</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>So let me begin by reviewing the key points from that episode.</p>
<p>Sometime around 3500 BC, the Ussatavo culture emerged in the northwestern corner of the</p>
<p>Black Sea around the mouth of the Dniester River.</p>
<p>This appears to have been a hybrid culture, which combined the cultures of the Indo-European</p>
<p>steppe herders to the immediate north with the people of the fixed agricultural settlements</p>
<p>around the Balkans to the south.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally believed that the people who inhabited this region spoke an Indo-European</p>
<p>dialect.</p>
<p>And a few centuries later, after this culture emerged, some of the people who inhabited</p>
<p>this region began to migrate northwestward along the Dniester River, and that took them</p>
<p>along the northern side of the Carpathian Mountains into northern Europe.</p>
<p>These Ussatavo people encountered other peoples in northern Europe, which are known as the</p>
<p>Corded Ware people, based upon a type of pottery they produced which had cord-like designs</p>
<p>around the outside.</p>
<p>And I also noted back in that episode that the early Germanic languages were on the ground</p>
<p>and being spoken in and around Scandinavia by around 500 BC.</p>
<p>But that obviously leaves a pretty big gap in both time and knowledge between the first</p>
<p>migration of Ussatavo people around 3300 BC and the emergence of the Germanic-speaking</p>
<p>tribes around 500 BC.</p>
<p>So what about that gap?</p>
<p>What do we know about the links between the original Indo-Europeans and the first Germanic</p>
<p>tribes?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is we don&rsquo;t know very much with any certainty.</p>
<p>But there are a few reasonable conclusions that we can draw from that period.</p>
<p>First, since the original Germanic language was an Indo-European language, we know that</p>
<p>the original Germanic tribes in Scandinavia were connected to the Indo-Europeans of the</p>
<p>Black Sea region, at least linguistically.</p>
<p>This is the same assumption we can make about the first Greeks and the first Latin-speaking</p>
<p>tribes and the first Celts.</p>
<p>They all spoke Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>So there has to be some type of connection back to the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>And the connection appears to be those Corded Ware people of northern Europe, at least in</p>
<p>the case of the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>Now, there is archaeological evidence from northern Europe during this period between</p>
<p>the Ussatavo culture and the emergence of the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But there are no inscriptions, so we don&rsquo;t know very much about the languages in this</p>
<p>region during this period.</p>
<p>So instead of linguistic evidence like inscriptions, scholars have to look for cultural links between</p>
<p>these peoples.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the Corded Ware people.</p>
<p>The first thing I should note about the Corded Ware people is that they occupied a very large</p>
<p>portion of northern and central Europe during the later period of the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>And to put some actual dates on the culture, they appear to have spread across northern</p>
<p>Europe from around 3200 BC to around 2300 BC.</p>
<p>And as you may recall from earlier episodes, the period of the original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>is estimated to be between 4500 BC and 2500 BC.</p>
<p>So during the later half of the Indo-European era, the Corded Ware culture was in place</p>
<p>in northern Europe.</p>
<p>And just to emphasize the point, that means that the Corded Ware people were in place</p>
<p>before the emergence of the original Germanic language and before the original Celtic and</p>
<p>Baltic and Slavic languages.</p>
<p>So these people lived in northern Europe around the same time the original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>were starting to expand outward from the Black Sea region.</p>
<p>And to get a better idea of the region where these people lived, check out the map which</p>
<p>Lewis Henwood was kind enough to prepare for episode 11.</p>
<p>Just go to historyofenglishpodcast.com and click the link for episode 11.</p>
<p>So these people lived in northern Europe at a time when the Indo-Europeans were starting</p>
<p>to expand into that region.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t really know anything about the language of the Corded Ware people.</p>
<p>But we do know that the culture began to take on many characteristics associated with the</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans to the south.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a major signal that the Indo-Europeans were expanding into this region and affecting</p>
<p>the culture of the region.</p>
<p>Now archaeologists have determined that the Corded Ware people were mobile and they were</p>
<p>pastoral since relatively few fixed settlements have been found in the Corded Ware region.</p>
<p>Their mobile nature is also suggested by the wide territory which they covered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also evidence that they had domesticated horses and were using ox-drawn wagons at this</p>
<p>very early stage.</p>
<p>And since horses were domesticated in the steppe region to the southeast during the</p>
<p>Indo-European period, that&rsquo;s a strong sign that the Indo-Europeans were expanding into</p>
<p>northern Europe and were bringing those domesticated horses with them.</p>
<p>And since wheeled vehicles were also in common use on the steppes by this point, the presence</p>
<p>of ox-drawn wagons in northern Europe is another sign of Indo-European expansion into the region</p>
<p>to the north.</p>
<p>Also, bronze objects began to appear in the Corded Ware region during this period.</p>
<p>And bronze technology and bronze objects, they can actually be traced from the Balkans</p>
<p>and the Carpathian Basin around the Black Sea through the steppe region and into this</p>
<p>area of northern Europe.</p>
<p>So this is further evidence of the spread of Indo-European peoples and culture into</p>
<p>this region.</p>
<p>So all of this suggests that this Corded Ware culture was comprised of either Indo-European</p>
<p>people who had migrated into northern Europe, or it was a blended culture consisting of</p>
<p>Indo-European people who had become assimilated with the native people in that region.</p>
<p>And this second option is probably the most likely because there are some clear differences</p>
<p>between this Corded Ware culture and the Indo-European culture.</p>
<p>For example, the Indo-Europeans tended to use a particular type of burial called Kurgan</p>
<p>burials and those types of burials are not generally found in the Corded Ware region.</p>
<p>So that suggests more of a blend of cultures.</p>
<p>As I said, there&rsquo;s no clear evidence of the language of the Corded Ware people, but we</p>
<p>do know that Indo-European languages eventually emerged throughout this region a few centuries</p>
<p>later.</p>
<p>And to the west, the Germanic languages emerged.</p>
<p>And to the south, the Celtic languages appeared.</p>
<p>And to the east, the Baltic and Slavic languages came about.</p>
<p>So again, this is a sign that the early Indo-European language spread into this Corded Ware region</p>
<p>during this transitional period.</p>
<p>And it may very well be the case that the later Indo-European languages which emerged</p>
<p>in this region were not the product of a single Indo-European tribe or dialect.</p>
<p>It could be the case that there were waves of Indo-Europeans entering this region, with</p>
<p>each new wave bringing its own Indo-European dialect.</p>
<p>Historical linguists note that when two different languages meet in the same region, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually a period of bilingualism in which the two languages exist side by side.</p>
<p>But sometimes, over a period of several generations, one of the languages loses its status and</p>
<p>prominence, and new generations only learn to speak the more dominant language.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very likely what happened here.</p>
<p>The Indo-European dialects may have emerged as the dominant languages because the chiefs</p>
<p>who spoke those dialects had larger herds of cattle and sheep, and they may have had</p>
<p>more horses than could have been raised by the native people of northern Europe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also possible that there was more linguistic variation during this time.</p>
<p>In other words, local languages and dialects may have been common, but there might not</p>
<p>have been a common language spoken throughout the entire region.</p>
<p>And in that environment, a single dominant language like the Indo-European language could</p>
<p>have emerged as a common lingua franca spoken throughout the entire region.</p>
<p>So future generations would have tended to speak that language to the exclusion of the</p>
<p>local dialects and languages.</p>
<p>Again, these are just some of the theories to explain how Indo-European dialects replaced</p>
<p>the native languages in these regions.</p>
<p>And while the specific process is still up for debate, there&rsquo;s no doubt what the ultimate</p>
<p>result was.</p>
<p>During the first millennium BC, the original or proto-versions of the modern languages</p>
<p>of northern Europe began to emerge.</p>
<p>And this included the Germanic languages, the Celtic languages, and the Balto-Slavic</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>But this fact also produces a dilemma for historical linguists.</p>
<p>Remember that the Germanic and Celtic languages are considered Kentum languages, whereas the</p>
<p>Balto-Slavic languages of eastern Europe are considered Sodom languages.</p>
<p>So did all of these languages evolve together as part of a common dialect, which later fractured</p>
<p>into separate dialects?</p>
<p>Or did all of these languages evolve separately from each other in different places at different</p>
<p>times?</p>
<p>Again, the answer depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>In the mid-1800s, some early linguists attempted to put together the first family tree of Indo-European</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>One of those linguists was August Schlesier.</p>
<p>And Schlesier noticed similarities between the Germanic languages and the Baltic and</p>
<p>Slavic languages.</p>
<p>For example, all of those languages had similar case endings in certain situations.</p>
<p>In his early Indo-European family tree, Schlesier created a basic Slavo-Germanic branch in which</p>
<p>the Germanic languages of northern Europe and the Baltic and Slavic languages of eastern</p>
<p>Europe were all part of the same language family.</p>
<p>He then indicated a later separation of the Germanic languages from the Baltic and Slavic</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>So, in essence, he thought the Germanic languages and the Balto-Slavic languages had emerged</p>
<p>from a common dialect spoken in northern Europe.</p>
<p>But there was an obvious problem with Schlesier&rsquo;s model.</p>
<p>By this point, linguists had also started to make that distinction between the Kentum</p>
<p>and Sodom languages.</p>
<p>Supposedly, this distinction represented a very early split in the Indo-European languages</p>
<p>between a western Kentum group and an eastern Sodom group.</p>
<p>And the Germanic languages were part of that western Kentum group.</p>
<p>And the Balto-Slavic languages were part of that eastern Sodom group.</p>
<p>So this suggested that the Balto-Slavic languages developed separately from the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And it also suggests that the similarities between the two language groups were the result</p>
<p>of long-term borrowing.</p>
<p>Not all of these languages were spoken in close proximity, so that would explain some</p>
<p>of the similarities.</p>
<p>Now we should also keep in mind the wave theory I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>And that might also account for some of the fundamental similarities and differences between</p>
<p>those languages.</p>
<p>For example, there might have been an initial Indo-European dialect brought by early settlers.</p>
<p>And in certain places, there may have been later settlers who brought a related but different</p>
<p>Indo-European dialect with them.</p>
<p>So these theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>And this is still the subject of ongoing debate among some modern linguists.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, the proper classification of the Germanic languages isn&rsquo;t really all</p>
<p>that important to our story of the history of English.</p>
<p>While the linguistic evidence is unclear and somewhat contradictory, we can say that an</p>
<p>early proto-Germanic dialect had emerged in Scandinavia and northern Germany early in</p>
<p>the first millennium BC.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn our attention to those early Germanic speakers.</p>
<p>During this very early period, the Germanic tribes were confined to a relatively small</p>
<p>portion of northern Europe, from Scandinavia down into modern-day Denmark.</p>
<p>Even though there were no inscriptions or writings from this period to confirm that</p>
<p>the people who lived there were early Germanic-speaking tribes, there are other clues which lead to</p>
<p>this conclusion.</p>
<p>For example, this is the only area in the region where there are no pre-Germanic place</p>
<p>names.</p>
<p>And that suggests that Germanic-speaking people were in this region very early on.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s difficult to put any actual dates on the arrival of these tribes into</p>
<p>this region.</p>
<p>And regardless of the date of their arrival, it does appear that early Germanic dialects</p>
<p>were being spoken in this region by about 1000 BC, and perhaps even earlier than that.</p>
<p>Now south of this region were the Celtic tribes.</p>
<p>And remember that early on, the Celts dominated much of central Europe.</p>
<p>But sometime later, around 1000 BC, some of the Germanic tribes began to move southward</p>
<p>into Celtic territory.</p>
<p>And within a few centuries, the dividing line between Celts and the Germans had moved all</p>
<p>the way westward to the Rhine.</p>
<p>And these Germanic tribes continued their migration and displacement of the Celts further</p>
<p>south, down into modern Germany.</p>
<p>And these migrating tribes soon became distinct from the tribes which remained up in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>And we now have an early split between the North Germanic tribes and the Western Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>The northern tribes would eventually produce a dialect called Old Norse, which was the</p>
<p>language of the Vikings, and it ultimately produced modern Scandinavian languages like</p>
<p>Swedish and Norwegian and Danish and Icelandic.</p>
<p>And those Western Germanic tribes ultimately produced the Western Germanic dialects, including</p>
<p>English, German, and Dutch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, around this same time, a separate eastward expansion of Germanic tribes out</p>
<p>of Scandinavia occurred, and that occurred between around 600 BC and 300 BC.</p>
<p>And this movement was from Scandinavia to the opposite Baltic coast, down into the area</p>
<p>of modern-day Poland.</p>
<p>And this movement then continued southward and eastward from there.</p>
<p>By around 300 BC, they were located in and around the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>And the customs and dialects of these tribes were distinct from those of the Western Germanic</p>
<p>tribes, and these tribes are known to us today as the East Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>They eventually reached the Black Sea and the Danube.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the tribes which overtook Western Europe upon the collapse of the Roman</p>
<p>Empire were these East Germanic tribes, not, interestingly enough, the neighboring West</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>Now these East Germanic invaders included the Goths, the Vandals, the Gepids, the Burgundians,</p>
<p>and the Lombards.</p>
<p>Now these tribes and their dialects have long since disappeared.</p>
<p>They were assimilated into other tribes and peoples over time, but their story is a very</p>
<p>important part of the overall story of the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll look at them in more detail in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>So that gives you a very general overview of the emergence and division of the early</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But it also brings us to the point in our story where we actually start to have independent</p>
<p>evidence of these tribes and their languages.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we have to rely on archaeological evidence of the peoples who lived in this</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>But now, around 300 B.C., we get the first written accounts from people who encountered</p>
<p>these Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And soon thereafter, we get the first archaeological evidence of the language of these tribes.</p>
<p>And this evidence comes in the form of some early inscriptions.</p>
<p>So our knowledge of the Germanic tribes starts to grow significantly after about 300 B.C.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at some of that evidence.</p>
<p>The first documented encounter with these tribes can be attributed to the Greek traveler</p>
<p>Pythias.</p>
<p>The last time I mentioned Pythias was the episode on the Celts.</p>
<p>And you might recall that he also gave us our first glimpse of the Celts in Britain.</p>
<p>He coined the term Britannic Islands, which eventually came Britannia and then Britannia</p>
<p>and of course later, Britain.</p>
<p>Now, after he left the British Isles on his way back to Greece around 325 B.C., he traveled</p>
<p>across the North Sea into the region of modern-day Denmark in northern Germany.</p>
<p>And he mentioned two tribes in this region by name.</p>
<p>He mentioned the Teutons in modern-day Denmark and the Gutons in northern Germany.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned the Teutons back in the episode about the Celts.</p>
<p>And you might recall that the Teutons and the Cimbri were the two tribes that moved</p>
<p>out of northern Europe down to the region around Hungary and then moved westward and</p>
<p>threatened the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And the Romans eventually defeated them, but it was a part of the overall threat to the</p>
<p>Romans which led Caesar to invade Gaul in the first century B.C.</p>
<p>And you might remember that there&rsquo;s some uncertainty as to whether the Cimbri were a Germanic tribe</p>
<p>or a Celtic tribe.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even some argument about the Teutons as well since their name comes from</p>
<p>a Celtic word meaning people.</p>
<p>But most modern historians consider them to be a Germanic tribe.</p>
<p>So thanks to Pythias, we know that they were located around Denmark about 325 B.C.</p>
<p>And you may also remember that the name of the Teuton tribe gives us the modern word</p>
<p>Teutonic to refer to things associated with Germany.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the Teutons.</p>
<p>But what about that other tribe which Pythias mentioned, the Gutons?</p>
<p>Well, some scholars believe that the Gutons may have been the same tribe which we would</p>
<p>later know as the Goths.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s true, that means the Goths were still located in northern Europe around 325</p>
<p>B.C. before beginning their movement into southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>And the time frame actually works, but there&rsquo;s no way to know for sure if Pythias was referring</p>
<p>to the early Goths.</p>
<p>In fact, the reports of Pythias are so sparse and limited that they only give us a brief</p>
<p>glimpse of these Germanic tribes and the region where they lived around 325 B.C.</p>
<p>Now as I mentioned, the Romans encountered the Teutons in the Kimberley around 109 B.C.</p>
<p>And that was a couple of centuries after Pythias and his reports from the region.</p>
<p>And that set in place a series of events which ultimately led to the Roman invasion of Gaul</p>
<p>all the way to the Rhine, and even beyond that on several occasions.</p>
<p>So after that point, around the first century B.C., we get more and more first-hand accounts</p>
<p>of the Germanic tribes from the perspective of the Romans.</p>
<p>But during the 300-year period between Pythias and Caesar, our knowledge is limited to the</p>
<p>archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>Remember, the Celtic tribes and the Germanic tribes were both illiterate, so they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep their own recorded histories.</p>
<p>So based on the evidence we do have, it appears that the Germanic tribes in Scandinavia and</p>
<p>northern Germany, they continued their migration southwest and southeast during this period.</p>
<p>We know the Teutons migrated from Denmark down into Hungary and then westward into Gaul.</p>
<p>And if the Gutons were in fact the early Goths, we know that they moved from this region southeastward</p>
<p>to the area around the Black Sea.</p>
<p>And we know from the accounts of the Romans during this period that they were getting</p>
<p>more and more concerned about these tribal movements to the north.</p>
<p>There were more and more Celtic tribes knocking at the door of the Romans during this period,</p>
<p>presumably because the Celtic tribes were being pushed southward by the expanding Germans</p>
<p>further north.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the migrations during this period.</p>
<p>As I noted, by this point, the Germanic people had started to move southwestward towards</p>
<p>Gaul, where they had begun to settle down and they had also begun to merge with native</p>
<p>Celtic people.</p>
<p>So in some of these regions, Celtic tribes and Germanic tribes were already starting</p>
<p>to become intermingled within the same general area by this point.</p>
<p>And this is part of the problem we have in trying to classify early tribes like the Teutons</p>
<p>and the Cimbri.</p>
<p>They have Celtic names, but they originated in areas that were later associated with the</p>
<p>Germanic tribes, so historians still debate whether some of these tribes spoke Celtic</p>
<p>languages or Germanic languages.</p>
<p>Now as the Germanic tribes encounter the Celts to the south, we can also see the split between</p>
<p>the western and eastern tribes.</p>
<p>The West Germans eventually tended to settle down once they were in place, but the East</p>
<p>Germans continued to be migratory.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, the earliest Germanic tribes were nomadic herders and shepherds</p>
<p>in keeping with their Indo-European roots.</p>
<p>And they continued to have very limited grain agriculture during this period between Pythias</p>
<p>and Caesar.</p>
<p>And Europe was heavily wooded, which tended to limit agricultural development.</p>
<p>So expanding Germanic tribes tended to settle in areas which were open and unforested.</p>
<p>In those areas, the Germans could live off their flocks and their herds.</p>
<p>But as the population began to grow, the herds were not capable of sustaining the population.</p>
<p>So given this dilemma, they had three options.</p>
<p>First, they could clear more land for larger herds.</p>
<p>Second, they could switch over to an agricultural economy and grow crops.</p>
<p>Or third, they could migrate elsewhere to an area that was not as congested.</p>
<p>Well, the nature of the Germanic tribes was to migrate.</p>
<p>So they typically took the last option and they just moved on elsewhere.</p>
<p>The first two options were contrary to their culture and lifestyle.</p>
<p>So as they continued their migrations and expansion southward, the Germanic tribes continued</p>
<p>to travel into Celtic regions.</p>
<p>And the major point here is that this appears to be more of a migration than an invasion.</p>
<p>Central and Northern Europe was still very sparsely populated compared to today.</p>
<p>There were no nation-states or standing armies.</p>
<p>So generally speaking, these were merely nomadic, pastoral people looking for new pastures.</p>
<p>And this was the situation as we find it around the first century BC, with Germanic tribes</p>
<p>moving down into Central Europe into Celtic territory.</p>
<p>In fact, by this point, the Germanic tribes had reached all the way down into southern Germany.</p>
<p>And that meant that some of the Celtic tribes were displaced in the process and were being</p>
<p>forced southward as well.</p>
<p>So now we can start to see how all these pieces fit together.</p>
<p>In the south, along the Mediterranean, we have the Romans.</p>
<p>And in the north were the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>And in most of Central Europe were the Celts.</p>
<p>And I mentioned in earlier episodes that the Celts were caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>And the ultimate trigger here was the expansion of Germanic tribes southward.</p>
<p>That had caused a domino effect, which pushed the Celtic tribes further southward.</p>
<p>And that caused pressures along the Roman border.</p>
<p>And in response to those pressures and the general Roman fear of the Celtic tribes to</p>
<p>the north, Julius Caesar invaded the Celts in Gaul in the first century BC.</p>
<p>And when all was said and done, the Celts in Europe were consumed by these two expanding</p>
<p>forces, which left the Romans and the Germanic tribes as the two primary players in Western</p>
<p>Europe, with the Rhine and the Danube as the de facto border between those two regions.</p>
<p>Now when Caesar invaded and conquered Gaul in the first century BC, the territory of</p>
<p>Gaul extended all the way to the Rhine in the east.</p>
<p>And in case you&rsquo;re not familiar with European topography, the Rhine flows from Central Europe</p>
<p>northward to the North Sea, and the Danube flows from the same general region of Central</p>
<p>Europe eastward to the Black Sea.</p>
<p>So the region west and south of these two rivers essentially became Roman territory.</p>
<p>And as the Germanic tribes expanded southward, eventually consuming the Celts, the region</p>
<p>north and east of these two rivers became the Germanic territory.</p>
<p>So this is a good point to stop and take a snapshot of the situation as we find it in</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>We basically have a southeast and northwest divide between the Romans and the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>But Celtic tribes had not completely disappeared yet.</p>
<p>To the west of the Rhine, in Gaul, they were still there.</p>
<p>They were just under the control of the Romans now.</p>
<p>And over time, Romanization ensured that the Celtic nature of these tribes began to disappear</p>
<p>and were replaced by Roman elements.</p>
<p>But in the east, Germanic and Celtic cultures continued to coexist for a while.</p>
<p>There was a Celtic tribe in this region called the Germani.</p>
<p>And the Romans began to call all of the people in this region east of Gaul, in other words</p>
<p>east of the Rhine, the Germani.</p>
<p>But over time, as the Germanic languages and culture began to replace the Celtic culture</p>
<p>in that region, the term Germani became specifically associated with these Germanic people.</p>
<p>So this is the origin of the words Germanic and German.</p>
<p>Again, as I noted in an earlier episode, Germanic, like Teutonic, has Celtic origins.</p>
<p>But we associate those terms with the Germans today because German culture eventually supplanted</p>
<p>Celtic culture in these regions, which ultimately became known as Germania.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also at this point that we start to see the transition of the western Germanic tribes</p>
<p>from migratory herders to grain farmers.</p>
<p>The Celts east of the Rhine had already begun to shift to grain agriculture, and they had</p>
<p>begun to establish fixed settlements and villages.</p>
<p>But with the Roman conquest of Gaul, the Germanic tribes couldn&rsquo;t penetrate the Roman territory,</p>
<p>which was defended by Roman legions.</p>
<p>So that effectively prevented any further expansion by the Germans in a westward direction.</p>
<p>And migration of these tribes to the east was limited because the east was already densely</p>
<p>occupied by other Germanic tribes, which were migrating southeastward.</p>
<p>So since they couldn&rsquo;t really continue to migrate to new regions, as required by a nomadic</p>
<p>herding lifestyle, they had no choice but to adopt grain agriculture and start farming</p>
<p>the land.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened around this time in the west.</p>
<p>The west Germans began to adopt a lifestyle which was closely related to the Celtic tribes</p>
<p>which they encountered, and in some cases which they conquered.</p>
<p>In some of these areas, the remaining Celtic expertise in agriculture would have been valuable.</p>
<p>And some historians think there was a level of cooperation between the Celts and the Germans</p>
<p>in many of these areas.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s possible that there was a mixing of Germanic and Celtic tribes in some of these</p>
<p>regions, and this may again account for the inability of the Romans to distinguish some</p>
<p>of these groups as Germanic or Celtic.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that the eastern Germanic tribes didn&rsquo;t really face this dilemma.</p>
<p>There was no hard barrier like the Roman army in eastern Europe north of the Danube.</p>
<p>So the eastern tribes continued to migrate eastward and eventually southward.</p>
<p>And so we see cultural and lifestyle differences emerging between the eastern and western Germanic</p>
<p>tribes very early on.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s look back to the Rhine region to the west.</p>
<p>With the Romans firmly entrenched in Gaul, and with more and more Germanic tribes coming</p>
<p>in from the north, the region east of the Rhine became more and more densely populated</p>
<p>with Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>So it became more and more Germanic, and that meant less and less Celtic.</p>
<p>But since the Germanic tribes weren&rsquo;t able to cross into Roman territory west of the</p>
<p>Rhine, Gaul didn&rsquo;t become diluted by Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>Over time, the area west of the Rhine evolved into a Romano-Celtic culture, and the area</p>
<p>east of the Rhine became more and more Germanic.</p>
<p>So a linguistic and cultural divide on each side of the river became sharper and sharper</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>Now initially the Romans conquered Gaul, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they were content to remain</p>
<p>in Gaul.</p>
<p>Remember, this is the Roman Empire we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So it was inevitable that Rome was going to set its sights on the Germanic region east</p>
<p>of the Rhine.</p>
<p>Now Rome initially crossed the Rhine on several occasions, but it wasn&rsquo;t with the intent</p>
<p>of permanent occupation or conquest.</p>
<p>The Germanic area was a greater challenge than Gaul.</p>
<p>Remember that the Celts had become settled farmers in and around villages and small towns.</p>
<p>So once these towns were conquered, the Celts could be subdued.</p>
<p>But in the Germanic region, the tribes were only beginning to adopt agriculture.</p>
<p>Many of them were still nomadic herders when the Romans arrived.</p>
<p>So if the Germanic tribes were defeated in battle, they would just shrink into the forest</p>
<p>and engage in guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>But by the first century A.D., the Romans thought they were finally in a position to</p>
<p>conquer and dominate the Germanic regions to the east, just as they had done in Gaul.</p>
<p>The Romans had actually engaged some of the Germanic tribes in battle, and they had scored</p>
<p>some significant victories against them east of the Rhine between the years 12 B.C. and</p>
<p>7 B.C.</p>
<p>So the Romans decided to make a claim to the entire territory east of the Rhine, which</p>
<p>they now called the province of Germania.</p>
<p>And in the year 4 A.D., the Romans entered Germania with the intention of making it into</p>
<p>the next Roman province.</p>
<p>And they initially had success against the Germanic tribes they encountered there, and</p>
<p>it looked like Germania was destined to follow the same course as Gaul.</p>
<p>But a couple of years after that initial invasion, a highly respected and feared Roman general</p>
<p>named Varus was sent to consolidate Roman power in Germania.</p>
<p>His trusted advisor was Arminius, a German who had been handed over to the Romans as</p>
<p>a child by his Germanic chieftain father during that earlier Roman invasion of the territory.</p>
<p>So this was a customary practice at the time.</p>
<p>Defeated chieftains would sometimes hand over their child as tribute to the Romans and to</p>
<p>confirm Roman victory over the tribe.</p>
<p>So the young child, Arminius, had been raised as essentially a hostage in Rome, and he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been given a military education.</p>
<p>And he subsequently rose in the ranks of the Roman army.</p>
<p>But Arminius had secretly forged an alliance among competing Germanic tribes to oppose</p>
<p>the Romans.</p>
<p>And while the Roman general Varus was on his way from his summer camp to his winter camp</p>
<p>near the Rhine, he received reports of a rebellion in the province, and he took a detour through</p>
<p>some unfamiliar territory in the Teutoburg Forest region of Germany, probably at the</p>
<p>direction of Arminius.</p>
<p>What he didn&rsquo;t know was that the Germanic troops were waiting for him in the trees and</p>
<p>in the brush.</p>
<p>And when Varus and his Roman troops came through, the Germanic troops ambushed the Romans.</p>
<p>The Germanic soldiers surrounded the three Roman legions commanded by Varus, and they</p>
<p>hemmed them in.</p>
<p>And they then proceeded to slaughter the Romans with estimates of 15,000 to 20,000 Roman casualties,</p>
<p>including Varus himself who committed suicide.</p>
<p>This is known as the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, and it was a complete and shocking defeat</p>
<p>for the Romans.</p>
<p>The contemporary Roman sources at the time acknowledged the complete defeat of the Romans.</p>
<p>And even though the Romans did make a few more limited excursions into the region in</p>
<p>subsequent years, the Teutoburg defeat effectively ended Roman expansion into Europe east of</p>
<p>the Rhine.</p>
<p>And that effectively set the Rhine River as the de facto boundary between Rome and Germania</p>
<p>going forward.</p>
<p>Though the Romans couldn&rsquo;t conquer Germania, they could certainly trade with them.</p>
<p>The empire was in constant need of raw materials from Germania like amber and furs, and manpower</p>
<p>usually in the form of slaves.</p>
<p>And the Germans desired Roman luxury goods, especially gold and silver items like jugs</p>
<p>and buckets, ladles, cups, brooches, rings, and other jewelry.</p>
<p>They especially desired Roman coins, particularly those of small denominations, which they were</p>
<p>beginning to use in their own burgeoning free market economy.</p>
<p>So trade was primarily conducted between the Romans and the Germanic tribes living within</p>
<p>a hundred miles or so of the Rhine and the Danube border.</p>
<p>And these Germanic border tribes tended to act as intermediaries to facilitate the trade</p>
<p>of those same items deeper into Germanic territory.</p>
<p>So this was the state of the Romano-German relationship through the middle of the second</p>
<p>century AD.</p>
<p>And so it should not be surprising that we start to see Latin words associated with the</p>
<p>Romans flowing into the early Germanic language at this point.</p>
<p>Some linguists estimate that about 175 words were borrowed directly from Latin by these</p>
<p>early Germanic tribes in continental Europe.</p>
<p>In other words, these words made their way into the Germanic languages while the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>were still on the continent, before they migrated to the British Isles.</p>
<p>So the presence of these words in modern English can be traced all the way back to these Germanic</p>
<p>tribes while they were still trading with the Romans in Europe.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at some of those words.</p>
<p>We see the Latin influence in words associated with trade between the Romans and the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes, especially portable articles.</p>
<p>So the following words pass from Latin into the original Germanic dialects.</p>
<p>Words like chest, dish, cup, kettle, pillow, sack, sickle, chalk, pear, pepper, butter,</p>
<p>and cheese.</p>
<p>Now the Germans already had words for some of these items in their languages like butter</p>
<p>and cheese, but the modern words, which we use today, were originally borrowed from the</p>
<p>Romans.</p>
<p>The word wine was also borrowed by the Germanic tribes during this period.</p>
<p>The Germans had beer and ale and mead, remember that mead goes all the way back to the original</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans, and beer and ale were drinks developed in and around Germany.</p>
<p>Ale is actually a Germanic word, and beer has a disputed etymology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear if the word beer comes from the Germanic languages or from Latin.</p>
<p>There are actually possible roots within both languages.</p>
<p>But fermented fruit juices did not come from Germany.</p>
<p>That was a specialty of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>So the word wine definitely comes from the Latin word for wine, which was venum.</p>
<p>Now a trader or a huckster was called a calpo in Latin, and it may have also been used to</p>
<p>mean wine seller very early on.</p>
<p>This word was borrowed into the Germanic languages and ended up as keep in Old English, meaning</p>
<p>marketplace or wares or price.</p>
<p>But you may remember that the original Anglo-Saxon k sound assimilated or shifted to a ch sound.</p>
<p>So keep became cheap in Old English.</p>
<p>But it was originally a noun.</p>
<p>When the Norman French invaded England in 1066, they brought a French phrase for a bargain</p>
<p>which was bon marche.</p>
<p>And this was translated into Middle English as good cheap.</p>
<p>And it appears that this phrase was shortened during the early modern English period into</p>
<p>the adjective cheap, meaning inexpensive or low quality.</p>
<p>So the word cheap can be traced back to this Germanic borrowing from the Romans.</p>
<p>And the word anchor also came from the Germanic languages from Latin during this period.</p>
<p>The Romans were far more adept at shipbuilding than the central European Germans.</p>
<p>So the Germans were apparently impressed by this Roman technology, and anchor passed</p>
<p>into the Germanic languages at this time.</p>
<p>In addition to words associated with trade, we start to see the introduction of words</p>
<p>suggesting certain civilizing influences of the Romans.</p>
<p>The Romans introduced paved roads to the Germans, and the Latin word for paved road was strata.</p>
<p>And that word passed into the Germanic languages during this period and then eventually passed</p>
<p>into English as street.</p>
<p>And speaking of street, the word toll can also be traced back to a borrowing by the</p>
<p>original Germanic tribes from the Romans.</p>
<p>And in order to build roads, and for that matter, to build many of the large structures</p>
<p>associated with the Romans, you needed to have very precise measurements of distance</p>
<p>and weight.</p>
<p>So this is where many of the Roman weight measurements entered the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>The Latin word for thousand, mila, produced the measurement which we know today as a mile.</p>
<p>I discussed this measurement back in the episode on the early Romans.</p>
<p>Well the word now passed into the Germanic languages and eventually into English as mile.</p>
<p>Now the Romans had a mila, which was a precise measurement of 1,000.</p>
<p>But apparently the original Indo-European language didn&rsquo;t have a word for 1,000, nor</p>
<p>did the original Germanic languages.</p>
<p>But the early Germanic languages had developed a word which was pronounced something like</p>
<p>the sundi, which meant several hundred or a great many of something.</p>
<p>And the Germanic tribes used this Germanic word to translate the Latin word mila.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how the word passed into English as thousand, and it came to mean a specific</p>
<p>measurement of 1,000.</p>
<p>So even though the word thousand is a native Germanic word, its specific meaning today</p>
<p>comes from its association with Latin.</p>
<p>And in the last episode I mentioned that the British pound sterling came from the original</p>
<p>Old English word pund, which meant a pound of weight as used by the Romans.</p>
<p>Well that Old English word pund, meaning pound, goes back to the Germanic tribes who borrowed</p>
<p>the word from the Romans.</p>
<p>But you may say, hey, wait a minute, I thought the Latin word for pound was libra, which</p>
<p>is why we still use lb to abbreviate a pound.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s true, but the Roman word pondus meant weight, as in how much something weighs.</p>
<p>And they often used the phrase libra pondo to mean a pound of weight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in this sense that the Germanic tribes borrowed the word pondo as the name</p>
<p>for a pound of weight.</p>
<p>And from there we get pound.</p>
<p>And with Roman construction, we get words like tile and table via this same process.</p>
<p>Tile meant a roof covering and was a technology introduced by the Romans.</p>
<p>Table came from the Latin word tabula, meaning a board or plank.</p>
<p>I mentioned in an earlier episode that Romans sometimes covered small boards with a thin</p>
<p>layer of wax used for writing.</p>
<p>And from this word tabula, we get the modern English word tablet.</p>
<p>Well this same word passed into the early Germanic languages, meaning a board or plank.</p>
<p>And since boards or planks were used to create certain pieces of furniture, the word tabula</p>
<p>eventually gave us the word table.</p>
<p>The Romans had also developed an advanced technology to grind grain into flour.</p>
<p>And from this technology, the Latin word molina passed into the Germanic languages</p>
<p>and eventually gave us the English word mill.</p>
<p>And the civilizing influence of the Romans can also be seen in a word like kitchen, which</p>
<p>also comes from the Romans via the Germans.</p>
<p>The original word was a vulgar Latin word, coquina, which meant kitchen.</p>
<p>And this word passed into the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And again, we can see that Old English sound shift from the K sound to the CH sound in</p>
<p>the middle of that word, from coquina to kitchen.</p>
<p>The Latin word volum meant a rampart or a row of stakes.</p>
<p>Once again, the word was borrowed by the Germanic tribes from the Romans and eventually became</p>
<p>the word wall in modern English.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another word that followed this route into modern English.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, one word in modern English, but it means two different things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the word mint.</p>
<p>And in modern English, it can refer to an herb or it can refer to a place where money</p>
<p>is coined.</p>
<p>Well, in Old English, the herb was minta.</p>
<p>And that word came from the Germanic tribes who borrowed it from the Romans.</p>
<p>The Latin word for the herb was menta or mentha.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also where we get the word menthol in modern English.</p>
<p>Now, as far as the place where coins were made, that word also comes from Old English.</p>
<p>And the Old English word for coins was minute.</p>
<p>And that word came directly from the Latin word moneta, which meant money.</p>
<p>Now, I discussed that word in the last episode.</p>
<p>As you may recall, the Latin word for money or coins was moneta from the name of the Roman</p>
<p>goddess Juno Moneta.</p>
<p>Well, the word money comes from that original Latin word via the French.</p>
<p>But the word mint comes from that word via the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>It passed into Old English as minute, still meaning coins.</p>
<p>But its meaning eventually evolved to mean the place where coins were made.</p>
<p>So again, even though the words menta, meaning the herb, and minute, meaning coins, were</p>
<p>once distinct in Old English, they&rsquo;ve become identical in modern English as the word mint.</p>
<p>And both uses of the word come to us from the Romans thanks to the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>So words which we still use every day reflect a time in history when the early Germanic</p>
<p>tribes were trading with the Roman Empire and were adopting elements of Roman civilization.</p>
<p>But it also helps to illustrate the many ways in which Latin has influenced modern English.</p>
<p>As we can see, Latin didn&rsquo;t just come into English through French.</p>
<p>At least a few Latin words came with the original Germanic Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>So in this episode, we&rsquo;ve explored the origins of the Germanic tribes, as best we can determine.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve looked at their expansion throughout Central Europe at the expense of the Celtic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>And we looked at the Roman influences on the early Germanic language.</p>
<p>So next time, I&rsquo;m going to focus on the Germanic language itself.</p>
<p>Specifically, the development of that language, and the structure and grammar of that language.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll be very important as it relates to English.</p>
<p>Since English is a Germanic language, we&rsquo;ll see many features that are very familiar to us.</p>
<p>So next time, we&rsquo;ll look at the Germanic language.</p>
<p>Until then, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
