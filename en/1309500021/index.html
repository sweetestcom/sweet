<p>I hope you are having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>if not you&rsquo;ll get better tomorrow</p>
<p>today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s Murder Mystery and Makeup Monday</p>
<p>hey hey you know</p>
<p>at this point I&rsquo;ve been saying I need a theme song</p>
<p>blah blah blah blah whatever</p>
<p>but at this point it&rsquo;s like why get a theme song</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an amazing singer</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s so obvious</p>
<p>anyways if you are new here every Monday I sit down</p>
<p>I talk about a true crime case</p>
<p>and then I do my makeup</p>
<p>at the same time</p>
<p>it just keeps me busy</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re curious or interested in true crime</p>
<p>and you like makeup</p>
<p>I would suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>so today I want to talk about Jose Louis Calava</p>
<p>zippita zipit zippita</p>
<p>I have a really hard time pronouncing English words</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m about to butcher a lot of names</p>
<p>other than that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll shut up</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s get into this true crime story about Jose</p>
<p>Louis Calva Zapeta</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just gonna call him Jose</p>
<p>so Jose was born June 20th 1969</p>
<p>and when he was younger</p>
<p>when he was only like 2 years old</p>
<p>his father passed away</p>
<p>unsure as to how he passed away</p>
<p>but he passed away when Jose was just 2 years old</p>
<p>so that left him to be raised by his mother</p>
<p>and I think her name is Ilia</p>
<p>ilia e l I A Ilia ilia</p>
<p>anyways his mother</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just gonna call him mother</p>
<p>his mother raised him and his 5 siblings</p>
<p>so a really big family</p>
<p>he had 3 sisters and one brother</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t even mention</p>
<p>but they were growing up in Mexico City 5 siblings</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t ooh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big family</p>
<p>especially to take care of all these kids by yourself</p>
<p>it was said that jose&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>she was just really abusive growing up</p>
<p>and she had very harsh punishments</p>
<p>so she would be physically abusive towards Jose</p>
<p>and his siblings</p>
<p>and when Jose was just 6 years old</p>
<p>his mother I guess she beat him pretty badly</p>
<p>but she also smashed his</p>
<p>like a brand new toy</p>
<p>he had just gotten</p>
<p>so he got like</p>
<p>this brand new toy truck</p>
<p>and again he&rsquo;s 6 right</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re excited new toy</p>
<p>Jose had gotten in trouble over something</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what exactly</p>
<p>but his mother had beat him pretty badly</p>
<p>and then she took the new toy</p>
<p>and she smashed it</p>
<p>and this was like</p>
<p>really heartbreaking to poor Jose</p>
<p>because they never got new toys</p>
<p>they never got anything new</p>
<p>especially because there were so many siblings</p>
<p>it was always like</p>
<p>hand me downs</p>
<p>Jose then decided</p>
<p>at 6 years old</p>
<p>he decided he was gonna earn some money</p>
<p>and buy a new toy truck</p>
<p>to replace the one that his mom just smashed</p>
<p>Jose then started shining shoes to make some some money</p>
<p>and he would shine</p>
<p>all these shoes</p>
<p>and then he would just save all the money he got</p>
<p>and then he saved enough money to buy a new toy truck</p>
<p>he was really excited about it</p>
<p>he got a new toy</p>
<p>takes it home</p>
<p>he has it whatever</p>
<p>when his mom finds out that he has this new toy</p>
<p>and when she saw the toy</p>
<p>she went off</p>
<p>I guess she then took the toy</p>
<p>and she destroyed it</p>
<p>she smashed it</p>
<p>in front of Jose</p>
<p>and then she beat the crap out of Jose</p>
<p>so then at the age of 7</p>
<p>Jose was sadly</p>
<p>he was raped by a friend of his brother</p>
<p>who was like</p>
<p>16 at the time</p>
<p>the friend was</p>
<p>this was obviously very traumatizing for Jose</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear if the abuse continued on</p>
<p>or if it was just a one time thing</p>
<p>either way abuse</p>
<p>still has a life changing effect</p>
<p>in general like yeah</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s one time</p>
<p>so and then</p>
<p>at the age of 12</p>
<p>jose&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>she just had enough of him</p>
<p>at 12 she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done with you</p>
<p>you need to you&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out of the house</p>
<p>she kicks him out of the house at 12</p>
<p>he did end up dropping out of school</p>
<p>he fell into just a really dark depression</p>
<p>and he started drinking</p>
<p>he started drinking heavily</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before previously</p>
<p>that a lot of the times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see comments that say</p>
<p>I am trying to</p>
<p>portray the criminal as</p>
<p>like the victim</p>
<p>when I talk about these backstories</p>
<p>and the abuse</p>
<p>that usually</p>
<p>a lot of them have gone through that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m siding with</p>
<p>bad guy okay</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mention it again</p>
<p>I personally like</p>
<p>to get a backstory on people</p>
<p>I like to know like</p>
<p>what was their upbringing</p>
<p>like what did they experience</p>
<p>what was their life</p>
<p>like versus</p>
<p>just going straight to</p>
<p>what they did you know</p>
<p>they still did horrible things</p>
<p>and they still should be in jail</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>to think that</p>
<p>their upbringing</p>
<p>and stuff is sad</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay</p>
<p>for what they did</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>to feel sad</p>
<p>for these people anyways</p>
<p>shut up who cares</p>
<p>get into it anyways</p>
<p>back to Jose</p>
<p>so he realized you know</p>
<p>I gotta get a job</p>
<p>I gotta make some income</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not going to school</p>
<p>he has nowhere to live</p>
<p>to make some income</p>
<p>Jose he worked as a clown</p>
<p>and he was working</p>
<p>alongside his</p>
<p>brother in law</p>
<p>who was working</p>
<p>as a magician</p>
<p>at the time</p>
<p>so this magician</p>
<p>got him a job as a clown</p>
<p>and during this time</p>
<p>is when Jose</p>
<p>became very interested in writing</p>
<p>and he became very</p>
<p>passionate about books</p>
<p>screenplays poetry</p>
<p>he just found</p>
<p>like that thing</p>
<p>he was passionate about</p>
<p>he also just started writing himself</p>
<p>would write poems</p>
<p>so then in 1996</p>
<p>Jose married a</p>
<p>woman named</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Aid</p>
<p>A I D E But</p>
<p>he married this woman</p>
<p>the 2 of them</p>
<p>had 2 daughters</p>
<p>very quickly</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>back to back</p>
<p>the marriage only had lasted</p>
<p>like 2 years</p>
<p>and then they ended up</p>
<p>splitting up</p>
<p>she moved to America</p>
<p>and she took the children with her</p>
<p>and this infuriated Jose</p>
<p>it sent him into a really deep depression</p>
<p>he really heavily</p>
<p>started to abuse</p>
<p>alcohol and drugs as well</p>
<p>so shortly after</p>
<p>his ex wife left Jose</p>
<p>he met this lady</p>
<p>named Lydia</p>
<p>Sanchez Valdez</p>
<p>now Lydia would go on</p>
<p>this is later on</p>
<p>down the road</p>
<p>when she was</p>
<p>interviewed about Jose</p>
<p>but she would go on</p>
<p>to say that</p>
<p>Jose was very interested</p>
<p>in witchcraft</p>
<p>and she remembered him</p>
<p>doing some funky shit</p>
<p>using herbs</p>
<p>and cow tongues</p>
<p>to practice</p>
<p>his witchcraft</p>
<p>he was trying to put</p>
<p>curses on people</p>
<p>especially like</p>
<p>his ex wife</p>
<p>it made her really uncomfortable</p>
<p>how obsessive he was</p>
<p>about the people</p>
<p>who did him wrong</p>
<p>Lydia would also say that Jose</p>
<p>it sounds like he was OCD</p>
<p>but he was obsessed</p>
<p>with cleaning</p>
<p>washing his hands</p>
<p>and anytime</p>
<p>they had sex</p>
<p>he would have to wash his</p>
<p>lower regions</p>
<p>before and after having sex</p>
<p>he just had to clean</p>
<p>and he had constantly</p>
<p>wash himself</p>
<p>Lydia also would say that</p>
<p>Jose was very abusive</p>
<p>not physically</p>
<p>but um verbally</p>
<p>and mentally</p>
<p>he was very jealous</p>
<p>he was very controlling</p>
<p>and if Lydia</p>
<p>told Jose like</p>
<p>I want to get out of this relationship</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s something like</p>
<p>I want to break up with you</p>
<p>Jose would turn it around</p>
<p>and tell Lydia</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>gonna kill himself</p>
<p>if she did so</p>
<p>it was just a very emotionally</p>
<p>manipulative</p>
<p>manipulative</p>
<p>relationship</p>
<p>side note if</p>
<p>you were in</p>
<p>a relationship</p>
<p>where your partner</p>
<p>is telling you that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna kill themselves</p>
<p>if you break up with them</p>
<p>get the f out out</p>
<p>that is so toxic</p>
<p>luckily for Lydia</p>
<p>she was able to</p>
<p>get out of this relationship</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>able to get away</p>
<p>from his abuse</p>
<p>she would later</p>
<p>testify against him in court</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where this</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>all came from</p>
<p>Jose would spend a lot of his time</p>
<p>writing poetry</p>
<p>novels and even</p>
<p>place screenwriting</p>
<p>and he took</p>
<p>great pride in</p>
<p>his writing</p>
<p>and he wanted to pursue</p>
<p>a career with this</p>
<p>he would staple</p>
<p>booklets together</p>
<p>of his poetry</p>
<p>and different stories</p>
<p>and create like</p>
<p>little books</p>
<p>and he will</p>
<p>give them out</p>
<p>to people on the street</p>
<p>just to kind of</p>
<p>like try and</p>
<p>get his work out</p>
<p>there I mean</p>
<p>you never know</p>
<p>who you could be</p>
<p>giving it to</p>
<p>you could be</p>
<p>giving it to</p>
<p>someone who</p>
<p>is a big wig</p>
<p>you know for Jose</p>
<p>his writing</p>
<p>it never really</p>
<p>took off for him</p>
<p>but he really enjoyed it</p>
<p>and he would brag</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>about his writing</p>
<p>and he would tell people</p>
<p>that he was a</p>
<p>famous writer</p>
<p>and he was one</p>
<p>of the best</p>
<p>in the world</p>
<p>he had a very big ego</p>
<p>while passing out booklets</p>
<p>of his poems</p>
<p>on the street</p>
<p>Jose met a woman</p>
<p>named Alejandra</p>
<p>alejandra me</p>
<p>the 2 of them</p>
<p>had got to talk in</p>
<p>and and she</p>
<p>found him so charming</p>
<p>I mean he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>handing out</p>
<p>like his poetry</p>
<p>and she thought</p>
<p>his poetry was just</p>
<p>so lovely I mean</p>
<p>he was a charmer</p>
<p>seemed very sweet</p>
<p>passionate about</p>
<p>what he was doing</p>
<p>and she just</p>
<p>really liked</p>
<p>his work as well</p>
<p>so they got to talk in</p>
<p>Jose asked her like</p>
<p>what do you do</p>
<p>for a living</p>
<p>alejandra tells Jose</p>
<p>that she works</p>
<p>at a pharmacy</p>
<p>this piqued</p>
<p>jose&rsquo;s interest</p>
<p>a pharmacy you say</p>
<p>you see Jose</p>
<p>over here he</p>
<p>loved himself</p>
<p>some drugs okay</p>
<p>he was a big fan</p>
<p>and a big user</p>
<p>of Cloneza Pan</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how you pronounce it</p>
<p>Cloneza Pan</p>
<p>and this medication</p>
<p>is used to treat</p>
<p>seizures and treat</p>
<p>certain types of</p>
<p>anxiety disorders</p>
<p>now this drug</p>
<p>itself is said</p>
<p>to be one of</p>
<p>the most dangerous</p>
<p>and difficult</p>
<p>drugs to be</p>
<p>addicted to</p>
<p>I mean there are many</p>
<p>others as well</p>
<p>but this one is</p>
<p>definitely up there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very similar to like</p>
<p>Xanax or Volume</p>
<p>a lot of people abuse it</p>
<p>and Jose was</p>
<p>a big fan of it</p>
<p>so Jose was</p>
<p>like oh shit</p>
<p>you work at a</p>
<p>pharmacy awesome</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>her this but</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna use you</p>
<p>so I can get my drugs</p>
<p>so the 2 of them</p>
<p>began to hang out</p>
<p>Jose and Alejandra</p>
<p>and Alejandra</p>
<p>introduced Jose</p>
<p>to her mother</p>
<p>alejandra&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother really</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like Jose</p>
<p>alejandra&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>asked Jose like</p>
<p>what he did</p>
<p>for a living</p>
<p>he would go on to say</p>
<p>that he was a</p>
<p>a writer and</p>
<p>that he made</p>
<p>about 200 a day</p>
<p>selling his</p>
<p>written works</p>
<p>and this included his poetry</p>
<p>went on to say</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>a playwright</p>
<p>a director and</p>
<p>also a singer</p>
<p>so he just did it all</p>
<p>and this was a red flag</p>
<p>to alejandro&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>because she knew</p>
<p>he was lying</p>
<p>based on the</p>
<p>clothing he wore</p>
<p>you see like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>a lot of money</p>
<p>you probably</p>
<p>have maybe just</p>
<p>nicer clothes</p>
<p>he always seemed to be in</p>
<p>just really</p>
<p>like worn holy</p>
<p>beat up looking</p>
<p>clothing so</p>
<p>she knew that</p>
<p>he was just lying</p>
<p>like he didn&rsquo;t have money</p>
<p>she would also say that</p>
<p>she hated with Jose</p>
<p>everything was me</p>
<p>me me me me</p>
<p>me me me me</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>very selfish</p>
<p>it was all about him</p>
<p>he would just</p>
<p>talk and talk</p>
<p>and talk about</p>
<p>himself I mean</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever been</p>
<p>around one of</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>you know how that goes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they</p>
<p>come up to you</p>
<p>just to talk</p>
<p>about themselves</p>
<p>and then they go away</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>okay cool as</p>
<p>time went on</p>
<p>Alejandro started to see</p>
<p>the real Jose</p>
<p>he was jealous</p>
<p>he was controlling</p>
<p>lying about</p>
<p>a lot of things</p>
<p>not sure if</p>
<p>she ever found out</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really like</p>
<p>a famous writer and</p>
<p>stuff cause</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t much</p>
<p>said about it</p>
<p>but she did just see</p>
<p>the jealous</p>
<p>and controlling</p>
<p>side of him</p>
<p>and she wanted out</p>
<p>of the relationship</p>
<p>so she got offered a job</p>
<p>in northern</p>
<p>Mexico City</p>
<p>which meant</p>
<p>that she would</p>
<p>have to move</p>
<p>she was like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking this job</p>
<p>cause at this time</p>
<p>alejandra she was</p>
<p>32 years old</p>
<p>and I failed</p>
<p>to mention but</p>
<p>she had 2 children</p>
<p>they were not</p>
<p>fathered by Jose</p>
<p>was a different father</p>
<p>she had to do</p>
<p>what was best for her</p>
<p>and her 2 kids</p>
<p>as well she needed</p>
<p>out of this</p>
<p>relationship</p>
<p>she wanted out</p>
<p>of this relationship</p>
<p>and this job offer</p>
<p>was going to</p>
<p>bring more income</p>
<p>help her get away</p>
<p>and yeah she</p>
<p>could just take</p>
<p>care of her</p>
<p>kids and she</p>
<p>would be good</p>
<p>so October 5th</p>
<p>2007 alejandra</p>
<p>why am I laughing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not funny</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m laughing</p>
<p>at myself because</p>
<p>Alejandra anyways</p>
<p>so alejandra&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother gets</p>
<p>a call that</p>
<p>her daughter</p>
<p>failed to show</p>
<p>up for work</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>asking like</p>
<p>do you know</p>
<p>where she is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>like she always shows up</p>
<p>and her mother</p>
<p>would say like</p>
<p>immediately</p>
<p>she got that</p>
<p>gut feeling</p>
<p>that something</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t right</p>
<p>but her first</p>
<p>thought was</p>
<p>Jose she knew</p>
<p>that Jose knew</p>
<p>where she was</p>
<p>that something</p>
<p>had to happen</p>
<p>and just she</p>
<p>just knew Jose</p>
<p>okay her first</p>
<p>thought was</p>
<p>maybe that like</p>
<p>he tied her</p>
<p>up somewhere</p>
<p>so she couldn&rsquo;t leave him</p>
<p>because Alejandra</p>
<p>she told her</p>
<p>mother that</p>
<p>she wanted out of this</p>
<p>relationship</p>
<p>that Jose was</p>
<p>controlling</p>
<p>and just really</p>
<p>jealous and</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>her to leave</p>
<p>so she told</p>
<p>her mom this</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>Jose probably</p>
<p>tied her up</p>
<p>so she just</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t leave him</p>
<p>the next day</p>
<p>jose&rsquo;s neighbor</p>
<p>told alejandra&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>they had seen</p>
<p>a woman who</p>
<p>looked just</p>
<p>like Alejandra</p>
<p>going into jose&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment on</p>
<p>the same day</p>
<p>that she had</p>
<p>disappeared</p>
<p>with that little tip</p>
<p>alejandra&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother she had</p>
<p>called police</p>
<p>as soon as she</p>
<p>received that</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>to let them</p>
<p>know like hey</p>
<p>the neighbor</p>
<p>saw her at jose&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>so go down there</p>
<p>and find her</p>
<p>October 7th</p>
<p>which was like</p>
<p>the next day</p>
<p>police they</p>
<p>head over to</p>
<p>jose&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>knock on a door</p>
<p>Jose he answers the door</p>
<p>and to police</p>
<p>it looks like</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>sitting there</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>eating dinner</p>
<p>he had like</p>
<p>his little table set</p>
<p>A played out</p>
<p>a little napkin</p>
<p>bib going on</p>
<p>then the investigators</p>
<p>explain why</p>
<p>they were there</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>searching for</p>
<p>Alejandra that</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>sighting that</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>last location</p>
<p>somebody saw her</p>
<p>at so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to search</p>
<p>the home XYZ</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>if in Mexico City</p>
<p>you need to have</p>
<p>like a warrant</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming you do</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>fully sure anyways</p>
<p>but they start</p>
<p>searching the home</p>
<p>looking for</p>
<p>any clues or</p>
<p>any signs of</p>
<p>where Alejandra may be</p>
<p>was she here</p>
<p>is she there</p>
<p>maybe she&rsquo;s tied up</p>
<p>unfortunately though</p>
<p>and sadly fuck</p>
<p>they find more than</p>
<p>just a clue</p>
<p>so they end up</p>
<p>going into the house</p>
<p>and they search</p>
<p>start in like</p>
<p>jose&rsquo;s bedroom</p>
<p>and stuff and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>kind of looking</p>
<p>around no sign</p>
<p>of Alejandra</p>
<p>they open up</p>
<p>the bedroom closet</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>in the closet</p>
<p>and they see</p>
<p>a dismembered</p>
<p>body first they</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it looks fake</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why people</p>
<p>always think</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s fake</p>
<p>well I guess</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>kind of hard</p>
<p>to believe I like</p>
<p>look closer</p>
<p>and they realize that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>indeed alejandra</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s her body</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at her body</p>
<p>and they see that</p>
<p>her right forearm</p>
<p>and part of</p>
<p>her right leg</p>
<p>were missing</p>
<p>okay like where</p>
<p>did that go</p>
<p>buddy so then</p>
<p>they search</p>
<p>the rest of the home</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>her missing</p>
<p>body parts like</p>
<p>where are they</p>
<p>they have to be</p>
<p>here somewhere</p>
<p>right anyway</p>
<p>so they open up</p>
<p>jose&rsquo;s refrigerator</p>
<p>what do they find</p>
<p>they find alejandra&rsquo;s</p>
<p>missing body parts</p>
<p>just sitting</p>
<p>in the fridge</p>
<p>chilling they also</p>
<p>find a box of</p>
<p>corn flakes</p>
<p>I know suspicious</p>
<p>corn flakes</p>
<p>who the fuck</p>
<p>eats corn flakes</p>
<p>so then they</p>
<p>look inside</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what leads them to look</p>
<p>inside the box</p>
<p>of corn flakes</p>
<p>but they look</p>
<p>inside the box</p>
<p>of corn flakes</p>
<p>and guess what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inside this</p>
<p>goddamn box</p>
<p>of corn flakes</p>
<p>they find what</p>
<p>looks to be</p>
<p>fried bones</p>
<p>inside like</p>
<p>deep fried but</p>
<p>not chicken bones</p>
<p>or anything</p>
<p>they are human bones</p>
<p>what what are</p>
<p>you doing oh</p>
<p>I would love to be</p>
<p>an investigator</p>
<p>for these things</p>
<p>god I&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>so corn flakes</p>
<p>huh so then</p>
<p>when investigators</p>
<p>first got there</p>
<p>they saw well</p>
<p>Jose answers</p>
<p>the door and he had</p>
<p>like the napkin</p>
<p>all tucked in</p>
<p>right and he was</p>
<p>eating dinner</p>
<p>he had a plate</p>
<p>on the table</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>and like his</p>
<p>chair was he</p>
<p>was obviously</p>
<p>sitting eating</p>
<p>dinner okay</p>
<p>the investigators</p>
<p>actually look like</p>
<p>what was he</p>
<p>actually eating</p>
<p>well it wasn&rsquo;t just a normal ass dinner</p>
<p>he was eating part of the fried meat</p>
<p>it was on this plate</p>
<p>and it looked like he was eating it for dinner right</p>
<p>so then on the stovetop they see a frying pan and</p>
<p>and there were chunks of</p>
<p>flesh and fat that were just cooked</p>
<p>and so there was like</p>
<p>some cut up lemons on the side as well</p>
<p>I guess he was squeezing the lemon</p>
<p>on top of the cooked meat for some flavor</p>
<p>I mean to investigators</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just obvious that he was cooking this meat</p>
<p>and he was eating it</p>
<p>Jose was immediately arrested</p>
<p>and when questioned</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>Jose told authorities that he choked her to death</p>
<p>on accident</p>
<p>you know because we&rsquo;ve all been there</p>
<p>when you trip and you fall</p>
<p>and you accidentally choke someone to death</p>
<p>happens all the time</p>
<p>an accident my ass</p>
<p>Jose but okay</p>
<p>Jose also stood by</p>
<p>the fact that he did not eat any of her body</p>
<p>and his plan was to slowly dispose of her corpse</p>
<p>by feeding cooked meat</p>
<p>to the stray dogs that were in the neighborhood</p>
<p>like that makes it any better</p>
<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>anyways upon a further inspection</p>
<p>authorities concluded that Alejandra had been strangled</p>
<p>by a sneaker shoelace</p>
<p>that had been left on the floor of his apartment</p>
<p>so the accidental strangulation</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t gonna fly</p>
<p>because it there was</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s proof</p>
<p>she had the markings on her neck</p>
<p>and the shoelace was that</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>yeah so then</p>
<p>police also found a manuscript that Jose was working on</p>
<p>and the title was called Cannibal Instincts</p>
<p>the cover of the novel in progress</p>
<p>was a picture of Hannibal Lecter</p>
<p>which had been skewed to look like Jose</p>
<p>he was getting a little crafty</p>
<p>and like making Hannibal look like him</p>
<p>once Jose realized that he had been caught</p>
<p>in these lies</p>
<p>he either tried to escape or commit suicide</p>
<p>now this wasn&rsquo;t fully clear to authorities</p>
<p>which one exactly</p>
<p>it was because Jose had jumped from a balcony</p>
<p>and again they don&rsquo;t know if he jumped</p>
<p>because he was trying to commit suicide</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t know if he jumped</p>
<p>because he was trying to make a run for it</p>
<p>so as one of those</p>
<p>he jumps okay</p>
<p>he gets hurt pretty badly</p>
<p>he was taken to the hospital immediately</p>
<p>and he ended up recovering</p>
<p>so soon after jose&rsquo;s arrest</p>
<p>authorities linked the 2004 murder of Veronica okay</p>
<p>this last name is really hard casa Rubia</p>
<p>they linked her murder to Jose</p>
<p>poor Veronica had been beheaded</p>
<p>and her head and body had been put in like</p>
<p>cardboard boxes</p>
<p>and then dumped in the town next next door</p>
<p>when veronica&rsquo;s body was originally found</p>
<p>they really had no leads</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t really go anywhere</p>
<p>so it just kind of was turning into a cold case</p>
<p>but when Jose was under investigation</p>
<p>it turns out</p>
<p>Jose and Veronica</p>
<p>they were actually dating for a bit</p>
<p>they believed that he was responsible for her murder</p>
<p>Jose denied this</p>
<p>but all signs were pointing to him</p>
<p>there was also another murder of a sex worker</p>
<p>known as la Harocha</p>
<p>because her full name was never identified</p>
<p>that was her sex worker name I guess</p>
<p>but she was really well known in the area</p>
<p>her body was found</p>
<p>and it was dismembered</p>
<p>put in a suitcase</p>
<p>and it was found near jose&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>but originally</p>
<p>when her body was found</p>
<p>there were no suspects at the time</p>
<p>and it just never led anywhere</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before in</p>
<p>like the toy box</p>
<p>killer case</p>
<p>that when sex workers and stuff go missing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sad because a lot of the times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not taken seriously</p>
<p>or looked at seriously by police</p>
<p>so it was kind of the case with that</p>
<p>Jose then gives authorities another person</p>
<p>who was responsible for killing Veronica</p>
<p>so Jose gives authorities</p>
<p>the name Juan</p>
<p>Carlos Perez</p>
<p>Jose says that Juan</p>
<p>Carlos was responsible for killing Veronica not him</p>
<p>so investigators go</p>
<p>and they question Juan Carlos</p>
<p>Juan lets authorities know him</p>
<p>and Jose were actually in a romantic relationship</p>
<p>for quite some time</p>
<p>Jose told authorities</p>
<p>that Juan was a co</p>
<p>worker of Veronica</p>
<p>and that he wanted her dead</p>
<p>the motive there wasn&rsquo;t one</p>
<p>he just wanted her dead</p>
<p>because they were co workers</p>
<p>you see Jose was just trying to put veronica&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death on somebody else</p>
<p>police do end up arresting Juan</p>
<p>Carlos Juan</p>
<p>said that him and Jose were indeed in a relationship</p>
<p>but Jose was the one who killed Veronica</p>
<p>and that Veronica was single</p>
<p>she was a mother</p>
<p>just like Alejandra</p>
<p>and she had</p>
<p>3 kids of her own</p>
<p>one also said</p>
<p>that Jose was the one that cut her into pieces not him</p>
<p>juan&rsquo;s only involvement</p>
<p>would be that he knew that this happened</p>
<p>and did nothing about it</p>
<p>Juan was also</p>
<p>abusing drugs as well</p>
<p>so it seems like</p>
<p>Juan and Jose</p>
<p>like the relationship was mainly</p>
<p>using drugs together</p>
<p>and then a sexual relationship as well</p>
<p>so during the investigation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s brought to light</p>
<p>that Jose was heavily addicted</p>
<p>to the drug</p>
<p>we mentioned earlier klinosapan</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a hard time</p>
<p>but he was also addicted to cocaine</p>
<p>and alcohol</p>
<p>like heavily</p>
<p>and apparently</p>
<p>the mixture of these substances</p>
<p>can cause you to do some</p>
<p>just very crazy</p>
<p>and violent</p>
<p>stuff of course</p>
<p>when they go to court</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna use that</p>
<p>as their defense</p>
<p>so investigators kind of put together this</p>
<p>the idea that Jose purposely</p>
<p>went for women</p>
<p>that were single mothers</p>
<p>because he saw it</p>
<p>as an opportunity</p>
<p>to take advantage of</p>
<p>these women</p>
<p>they were in a vulnerable spot</p>
<p>they were looking for love</p>
<p>and their jobs</p>
<p>were usually low income jobs</p>
<p>so he knew he could take advantage of</p>
<p>these women</p>
<p>control them</p>
<p>have them be dependent on him</p>
<p>so they couldn&rsquo;t leave</p>
<p>while in jail</p>
<p>Jose refused</p>
<p>to make a guilty</p>
<p>or not guilty plea</p>
<p>his defense attorney</p>
<p>claimed that Jose killed a alejandra</p>
<p>because he was high</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t in the</p>
<p>right state of mind</p>
<p>quote he didn&rsquo;t eat her</p>
<p>he just cut her body up end quote</p>
<p>that was a defense</p>
<p>they were fighting hard</p>
<p>that he did not eat her</p>
<p>he just cut her up</p>
<p>come on so then in 2007</p>
<p>before reaching a conviction</p>
<p>Jose was found dead</p>
<p>in his prison cell</p>
<p>hanging by a belt</p>
<p>they also found a book</p>
<p>he had been writing</p>
<p>about himself</p>
<p>while in jail</p>
<p>and it was called</p>
<p>cannibal Poet</p>
<p>which is an odd</p>
<p>title for somebody who didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat his victim</p>
<p>but when they</p>
<p>first found Jose</p>
<p>it looked like a suicide</p>
<p>however he hadn&rsquo;t expressed</p>
<p>any suicidal ideation</p>
<p>it seemed like he was really excited</p>
<p>about writing his new book</p>
<p>about himself</p>
<p>because he was a</p>
<p>self absorbed asshat</p>
<p>so suicide was a little suspicious</p>
<p>plus how&rsquo;d he get a belt</p>
<p>it was reported</p>
<p>that Jose was receiving threats</p>
<p>from fellow inmates</p>
<p>and had been placed in a cell by himself</p>
<p>and he had constant</p>
<p>supervision</p>
<p>he was suspected</p>
<p>that he was killed</p>
<p>by fellow inmates</p>
<p>and this caused an investigation</p>
<p>within the prison system</p>
<p>of the officials</p>
<p>supervising</p>
<p>inmates also</p>
<p>when jose&rsquo;s body was examined</p>
<p>there were signs</p>
<p>that he was tortured</p>
<p>and he was raped</p>
<p>before he was hanged</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s widely believed</p>
<p>that he was killed</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t commit suicide</p>
<p>and nothing really came from that</p>
<p>investigation</p>
<p>that happened</p>
<p>inside the prison system</p>
<p>or the prison itself</p>
<p>Jose stood by the fact</p>
<p>that he did not eat anybody</p>
<p>and that he just simply</p>
<p>chopped them up</p>
<p>and he stood by that</p>
<p>but the book</p>
<p>or the screenplay</p>
<p>that he was writing</p>
<p>that they found</p>
<p>it was based off of his story</p>
<p>in that story</p>
<p>it said that he</p>
<p>ate this victim</p>
<p>but they were talking about</p>
<p>in the book</p>
<p>seems to be</p>
<p>that he did indeed</p>
<p>eat alejandra</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s belief</p>
<p>that there are up to 10 victims</p>
<p>that are linked to Jose</p>
<p>but because he died</p>
<p>or committed suicide</p>
<p>or whatever to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just unclear</p>
<p>they will never know</p>
<p>which is so frustrating</p>
<p>especially for the families</p>
<p>I would love to hear your thoughts</p>
<p>on this case</p>
<p>down below I mean</p>
<p>is there really much you can say about this</p>
<p>other than probably</p>
<p>better that he&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>which is sad</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>true anyways</p>
<p>I hope that</p>
<p>you have a really good day today</p>
<p>you make good choices</p>
<p>please please</p>
<p>please be safe out there</p>
<p>let me know down below</p>
<p>who you want me to talk</p>
<p>about next week</p>
<p>other than that</p>
<p>love and appreciate</p>
<p>you guys so much</p>
<p>have a wonderful day</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
