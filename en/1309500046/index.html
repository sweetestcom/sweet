    <p>hey bozo how are you</p>
<p>today i hope you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having a wonderful day so far my name is bailey sarian</p>
<p>and today is monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery</p>
<p>and makeup monday</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m out of breath</p>
<p>i should really work out if you&rsquo;re new here hi</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s it going my name is bailey</p>
<p>sarian and on</p>
<p>mondays i sit down and talk about true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>noggin and i do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup i</p>
<p>would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m here for you on</p>
<p>mondays but</p>
<p>other than that let&rsquo;s get into today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story let me</p>
<p>tell you it has been described as one of los angeles</p>
<p>most gruesome</p>
<p>crime scenes in history</p>
<p>history it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>often compared to the</p>
<p>black dahlia murder in terms of</p>
<p>level of gore</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re getting into today</p>
<p>blake label yeah</p>
<p>he was born on may eighth nineteen eighty one in canada</p>
<p>and he was just a normal guy right</p>
<p>always friendly</p>
<p>people liked him</p>
<p>but i think it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>to say that he had a very privileged upbringing yeah</p>
<p>his dad his name was lauren</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a prominent toronto real estate mogul so he</p>
<p>blake&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>had developed thousands</p>
<p>of homes with his father and brother so grandfather and</p>
<p>uncle to blake</p>
<p>anyways so it made the family</p>
<p>pretty well off you</p>
<p>could say they were doing</p>
<p>pretty damn well for themselves</p>
<p>anyhow so his</p>
<p>mother blake&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother she was</p>
<p>she was not a nobody you</p>
<p>could say blake&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother her name was eleanor</p>
<p>she was an heiress of a</p>
<p>major plastics</p>
<p>production company in canada</p>
<p>yeah this company they made all kinds of like different</p>
<p>plastic products</p>
<p>and her dad</p>
<p>blake&rsquo;s grandfather he owned a</p>
<p>bunch of patents</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about like rich rich rich</p>
<p>super rich blake</p>
<p>he also had an</p>
<p>older brother and his name was cody</p>
<p>so with parents</p>
<p>like that you know very</p>
<p>successful parents</p>
<p>they this is an assumption here but they probably felt</p>
<p>like they had to do something big and important with</p>
<p>their lives</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know though so don&rsquo;t quote me</p>
<p>so unfortunately</p>
<p>blinks parents</p>
<p>mom and dad</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t make the</p>
<p>marriage work so they</p>
<p>ended up splitting up right</p>
<p>but they also decided to</p>
<p>split up the boys</p>
<p>which is weird</p>
<p>i guess like</p>
<p>not only are you not living with both of your parents</p>
<p>anymore but now your brother is gone or your dad</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>never gonna see them again</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>switch it around</p>
<p>so the two boys they were only a year</p>
<p>apart so it&rsquo;s like they had a pretty</p>
<p>close relationship but</p>
<p>one went with the dad and one went with the mom</p>
<p>not was that so the boys</p>
<p>ended up growing up</p>
<p>completely apart</p>
<p>once their parents have split</p>
<p>cody went and lives with his dad and</p>
<p>blake went to go live with his mom</p>
<p>and it was pretty</p>
<p>safe to say that they did well</p>
<p>you know it wasn&rsquo;t like hard times they were both</p>
<p>still growing up in their</p>
<p>life of privilege and luxury</p>
<p>and all that</p>
<p>stuff you know</p>
<p>i guess it was said that</p>
<p>blake was feeling some</p>
<p>sort of way because he was jealous that his brother</p>
<p>got to hang out more with the father</p>
<p>and his father seemed to</p>
<p>favor him a lot more</p>
<p>i mean how could you not</p>
<p>think that when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a kid and you don&rsquo;t get to see your</p>
<p>dad i mean it&rsquo;s probably true no offense i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so it just seemed like he had some like very deep</p>
<p>jealousy issues</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll circle back to that</p>
<p>so the boys grow up and</p>
<p>then they both end up moving to los angeles california</p>
<p>cody decide to follow in his father&rsquo;s footsteps</p>
<p>and he became a real estate developer</p>
<p>and he would be working on</p>
<p>multi million dollar projects</p>
<p>he was also a</p>
<p>founder of a record company that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t last long</p>
<p>but he tried</p>
<p>you know he tried</p>
<p>and cody was also a business with a</p>
<p>major restaurant and</p>
<p>nightclub owner</p>
<p>so i mean he always coming seem to find</p>
<p>something to do they all did</p>
<p>cody also had some more</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>claims to fame</p>
<p>he kind of was like a big man on</p>
<p>campus in the hollywood scene</p>
<p>he definitely liked</p>
<p>to be out in the public eye and like rub</p>
<p>elbows with the</p>
<p>famous people</p>
<p>cody was also</p>
<p>known for the</p>
<p>super secret poker ring that he was in</p>
<p>which is not</p>
<p>so much a secret if it&rsquo;s like part of your</p>
<p>identity but you know</p>
<p>did you ever read the book</p>
<p>molly&rsquo;s game</p>
<p>or watch the</p>
<p>movie it was really good you</p>
<p>should watch it</p>
<p>or read it whatever you prefer</p>
<p>molly&rsquo;s game okay</p>
<p>cody was supposedly part of that poker ring</p>
<p>and played with big celebrities like</p>
<p>tobey maguire</p>
<p>leonardo dicaprio</p>
<p>ben affleck</p>
<p>and matt damon</p>
<p>so i guess cody was in on that</p>
<p>and he was also known for</p>
<p>honestly being really bad like not winning any games</p>
<p>i guess rumor has it who knows</p>
<p>but rumor has it</p>
<p>that there was one time</p>
<p>where he lost over a million dollars in just one game</p>
<p>i know fuck us</p>
<p>we get it so blake</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>stereotypical</p>
<p>trust fund kid okay</p>
<p>he joined in</p>
<p>with his older brother</p>
<p>in the high</p>
<p>stakes celebrity</p>
<p>poker games but in terms of his career goals</p>
<p>blake pursued more of the creative arts</p>
<p>he was an artist</p>
<p>after attending the</p>
<p>university of western ontario</p>
<p>in two thousand four</p>
<p>blake joined a bunch of</p>
<p>his college buddies</p>
<p>who had moved out to los angeles</p>
<p>so blake really wanted to direct</p>
<p>movies and he</p>
<p>definitely had the</p>
<p>money to help pave the way for him you know</p>
<p>nothing stopping him</p>
<p>great blake was also</p>
<p>known amongst</p>
<p>his friends to be like he had really cool ideas</p>
<p>but he never was able to execute</p>
<p>these ideas</p>
<p>you know like he was just</p>
<p>full of ideas but</p>
<p>never went anywhere with it</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t matter how much</p>
<p>money you threw</p>
<p>at it he just</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t reliable i</p>
<p>guess we could say</p>
<p>a lot of people thought</p>
<p>blake was like this genius</p>
<p>but others felt like he was</p>
<p>maybe just a really</p>
<p>smooth talker</p>
<p>and he was just trying to suck you in to like some</p>
<p>grand scheme that just</p>
<p>never paid off</p>
<p>finally blake was able to use his</p>
<p>money to get like</p>
<p>in the door a little bit okay</p>
<p>blake ended up</p>
<p>directing a low</p>
<p>budget film called bald</p>
<p>yeah bald it got two</p>
<p>point six stars on imbd so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s better than no stars</p>
<p>spare the no stars</p>
<p>so he directs that movie</p>
<p>and after he</p>
<p>directed that</p>
<p>movie he went on to work on an animated</p>
<p>series with mel brooks</p>
<p>now i had no idea that they turned</p>
<p>spaceballs into an animated tv show</p>
<p>did you i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>what did they do that</p>
<p>i forgot i forgot to look that up</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>and they did</p>
<p>and blake worked it on it well he</p>
<p>directed and consulted on it</p>
<p>and blake also did some</p>
<p>screenwriting</p>
<p>but one thing that he was</p>
<p>kind of successful at</p>
<p>was writing</p>
<p>graphic novels</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>he was pretty good</p>
<p>he was pretty good</p>
<p>so he was pretty</p>
<p>successful at writing graphic</p>
<p>novels so if you don&rsquo;t know what a</p>
<p>graphic novel is</p>
<p>cause i really didn&rsquo;t know what a</p>
<p>graphic novel was a graphic</p>
<p>novel is kind of like a more intense comic book</p>
<p>you know so the</p>
<p>story is told through art like a comic book</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s usually longer with more complicated and in</p>
<p>depth storylines</p>
<p>i guess blake&rsquo;s most successful project was a graphic</p>
<p>novel titled syndrome</p>
<p>yeah syndrome was originally published in 2010</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about a</p>
<p>neuropathologist</p>
<p>who was hellbent on figuring out</p>
<p>what is the root of all evil</p>
<p>so he experiments on serial killers and helps to try</p>
<p>and find a cure for the evilness that is inside of them</p>
<p>no matter what it costs him</p>
<p>and the scientist he never seems to find the cure and</p>
<p>blake ends the book by saying quote</p>
<p>in the end we all become</p>
<p>monsters end quote</p>
<p>which is so freaking creepy when you know</p>
<p>where this goes</p>
<p>now the story in the graphic novel is also pretty</p>
<p>freaking violent okay</p>
<p>and the images</p>
<p>that help tell the</p>
<p>story are very disturbing i mean for example like the</p>
<p>cover of the book is a photoshopped</p>
<p>picture of a baby doll head</p>
<p>with most of the brain and</p>
<p>skull removed no the skulls removed</p>
<p>and the brain is exposed</p>
<p>big difference so right off the bat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>warning of the type of</p>
<p>stuff you may be seeing inside the book</p>
<p>and the book itself</p>
<p>it included some incredibly gory illustrations of</p>
<p>two people hanging by</p>
<p>their feet completely</p>
<p>drained of blood</p>
<p>which again</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s creepy</p>
<p>knowing what&rsquo;s coming up</p>
<p>there are also illustrations of</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s body laying on a</p>
<p>blood soaked mattress</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s missing her head too</p>
<p>yeah maybe just</p>
<p>store this information in the back of your noggin</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s gonna come up and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be like what the fuck</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry you can be like what the hell</p>
<p>what the heck</p>
<p>what the sam hell</p>
<p>one of those what the chicken scratch salad</p>
<p>what the bob barker</p>
<p>likes chicken scratch sandwich</p>
<p>what the chicken scratch sandwich</p>
<p>so if you put that disturbing</p>
<p>graphic novel side</p>
<p>i guess blank would be considered</p>
<p>a catch i mean he had money</p>
<p>he came from a well off family</p>
<p>he had celebrity friends or at</p>
<p>least hung out with celebrity so it&rsquo;s like oh my god</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s somebody</p>
<p>and bitches</p>
<p>love that so with that being said in two thousand six</p>
<p>blakey he meets a woman</p>
<p>named amanda</p>
<p>now amanda was or is</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a former model okay</p>
<p>now just like everybody else</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got some baggage</p>
<p>okay so she meets</p>
<p>blake she&rsquo;s like oh my god yes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so great</p>
<p>and she tells him like my last</p>
<p>relationship was such a disaster</p>
<p>and this guy</p>
<p>blake like he is just the opposite of my last boyfriend</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not dead or in prison</p>
<p>many would say that when it came to</p>
<p>blake and amanda</p>
<p>it was like a opposites attract</p>
<p>type of deal</p>
<p>you know like amanda was this outgoing</p>
<p>party girl and</p>
<p>blake was introverted</p>
<p>nerdy whatever the hell that means but you know</p>
<p>maybe she was trying something new</p>
<p>because her last boyfriend</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work out for her</p>
<p>not blaming her not blaming her</p>
<p>just saying to me she&rsquo;s trying something new</p>
<p>amanda and blake date for a few years before</p>
<p>marrying in 2011</p>
<p>but at that time amanda was already pregnant</p>
<p>with their first son</p>
<p>and they seem to like genuinely just love each other</p>
<p>some speculated</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that they were getting married</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re having a son and it was for like</p>
<p>legal purposes</p>
<p>i feel like that&rsquo;s a rich people</p>
<p>think so kind of makes sense but</p>
<p>maybe they just</p>
<p>loved each other</p>
<p>maybe okay so</p>
<p>blake wasn&rsquo;t really making a lot of</p>
<p>money from his</p>
<p>graphic novels</p>
<p>he was actually getting a monthly</p>
<p>allowance from his parents and then</p>
<p>using that to pay for everything</p>
<p>blake was getting 18 000</p>
<p>a month from his parents</p>
<p>for just being born</p>
<p>and he got just over</p>
<p>17 million dollars over</p>
<p>eight years</p>
<p>until 2011 and that&rsquo;s when his mom</p>
<p>blake&rsquo;s mom had died of brain cancer that&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when the payments ended up stopping</p>
<p>so blake is kind of panicking because he has no</p>
<p>other source of income at all</p>
<p>how he&rsquo;s gonna support his wife amanda</p>
<p>and their newborn son what&rsquo;s he gonna do</p>
<p>get a job of course not</p>
<p>blake is like i know what i&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll sue my dad for the money</p>
<p>from mom&rsquo;s estate</p>
<p>you know since they split up</p>
<p>and i live with her it&rsquo;s only fair that i get</p>
<p>everything it kind of makes sense because like</p>
<p>no it doesn&rsquo;t but it kind of makes</p>
<p>sense because a lot of</p>
<p>stuff went to</p>
<p>his dad and they were like divorced for so long</p>
<p>maybe they said they</p>
<p>still liked each</p>
<p>other though</p>
<p>well obviously she left him a</p>
<p>bunch of stuff</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m getting at</p>
<p>is his mom&rsquo;s estate was</p>
<p>worth about</p>
<p>twelve million dollars but the court</p>
<p>only ends up awarding blakey</p>
<p>about half so six million dollars</p>
<p>great math i&rsquo;m sure you and i</p>
<p>could be like wow</p>
<p>jack fucking pot</p>
<p>great i&rsquo;m retiring</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never see me</p>
<p>again but but</p>
<p>but but but</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a big but</p>
<p>but lake was not</p>
<p>happy he was very</p>
<p>disappointed with this amount he wanted the full twelve</p>
<p>million i was</p>
<p>about to say</p>
<p>twelve thousand</p>
<p>okay so blake&rsquo;s not happy</p>
<p>now he&rsquo;s trying to fight this</p>
<p>right because he</p>
<p>thinks he deserves it all</p>
<p>now the two main reasons why the</p>
<p>courts only awarded him half</p>
<p>the first reason was because</p>
<p>blake didn&rsquo;t go to his mom&rsquo;s funeral</p>
<p>yep blake&rsquo;s friends said that</p>
<p>blake couldn&rsquo;t handle it because he was</p>
<p>super close with his mom</p>
<p>and like it was just too much for him you know</p>
<p>and and his friends also said that</p>
<p>his mom was his whole</p>
<p>world and her</p>
<p>death was like really hard for him</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>but the courts didn&rsquo;t see it that way they&rsquo;re like hmm</p>
<p>they see it as like</p>
<p>you not wanting to go and now you just want money yeah</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t you go to the funeral</p>
<p>i said last time you get to say goodbye</p>
<p>so he didn&rsquo;t go to the funeral</p>
<p>and the courts they saw it as cold and</p>
<p>as if he only cared</p>
<p>about her money</p>
<p>the second reason was because in the will his mom left</p>
<p>blake her condo in florida</p>
<p>and her really nice</p>
<p>house in toronto</p>
<p>and blake already got this</p>
<p>and guess what he did with it</p>
<p>he instantly turned around</p>
<p>and sold both properties</p>
<p>and made several million dollars from the two sales</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like bud</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>money going</p>
<p>cause you seem to be doing pretty well</p>
<p>oh gambling duh</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s all going</p>
<p>in the courts eyes this kid had already made</p>
<p>so much off of his mother</p>
<p>and all he was doing was turning around demanding more</p>
<p>money you know and to them like the courts</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a good look</p>
<p>you seem real greedy</p>
<p>so they only gave him six million they only</p>
<p>gave him six million</p>
<p>only six million</p>
<p>blake keeps going back to the courts like</p>
<p>can i have some more please</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re good blake</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>some believe that</p>
<p>maybe blake was doing this because he was</p>
<p>angry at his dad that his dad got so much money</p>
<p>and like they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t even together and</p>
<p>he felt like well i deserve it more because i loved mom</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s what some</p>
<p>people were speculating but it&rsquo;s just an observation</p>
<p>we really don&rsquo;t know it just</p>
<p>sounds like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>greedy honestly</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t want to work</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s around this time that blake&rsquo;s friends are</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>drift away from him because they noticed like</p>
<p>a change in his attitude</p>
<p>a shift in his character</p>
<p>it kind of started when his</p>
<p>mother was sick</p>
<p>he became more aggressive like he started acting out</p>
<p>he would throw really</p>
<p>awful tantrums like if like a freaking</p>
<p>three year old</p>
<p>and if he didn&rsquo;t get his way</p>
<p>he would just explode at his friends</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t physically violent but he was definitely</p>
<p>verbally abusive to them</p>
<p>so he like yelled</p>
<p>a lot and he would verbally harass his friends</p>
<p>and then call him up</p>
<p>and apologize the next day like i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>sorry i didn&rsquo;t mean what i said so</p>
<p>his friends</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t going to put up with his abuse anymore</p>
<p>no they were not</p>
<p>they were like</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need this we don&rsquo;t need a friend like you okay</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need anybody</p>
<p>like this in our lives so his friends</p>
<p>started dropping them and nobody</p>
<p>needs friends like that in</p>
<p>their lives if you have a friend</p>
<p>like that you get rid of them you do not entertain</p>
<p>that kind of behavior</p>
<p>no you do not</p>
<p>just ghost them you</p>
<p>could be an</p>
<p>adult and like tell them</p>
<p>i guess but</p>
<p>ghosting is easier</p>
<p>but either way</p>
<p>get far away from</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>one of the issues that</p>
<p>blake seemed to have was that he didn&rsquo;t like to be</p>
<p>alone and he was getting more more lonely</p>
<p>so it was kind of like i hate you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t leave me</p>
<p>kind of deal</p>
<p>you know and with his bad behavior and no one wants</p>
<p>to be around him but he&rsquo;s like please don&rsquo;t leave me</p>
<p>just toxic and</p>
<p>never ends and it&rsquo;s gross</p>
<p>why shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>should he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gross he does terrible things</p>
<p>with all that</p>
<p>money you think he</p>
<p>would have like got a therapist</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why people are so anti therapist</p>
<p>they are just the best</p>
<p>so over the next four years</p>
<p>blake became</p>
<p>super erratic</p>
<p>and very paranoid</p>
<p>and then one day during the summer of</p>
<p>2015 just out of nowhere poof</p>
<p>blake just picks up and he</p>
<p>leaves his wife amanda</p>
<p>who might i add</p>
<p>was eight months pregnant with their</p>
<p>second child</p>
<p>he just upped and left okay</p>
<p>it was like a</p>
<p>light switch went off and like he just</p>
<p>by she&rsquo;s eight</p>
<p>months pregnant</p>
<p>middle of summer</p>
<p>okay i hear that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>worst time to be pregnant</p>
<p>and he just up and leaves her</p>
<p>goodbye so blake</p>
<p>going through some kind of midlife crisis</p>
<p>he had met a new woman</p>
<p>and she was just his new world</p>
<p>who is this mysterious woman well</p>
<p>her name is yana casion</p>
<p>yana i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna call her yana</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s her name</p>
<p>great anyways she was born january</p>
<p>twenty seventh nineteen eighty six in keef</p>
<p>in keef ukraine</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t come for me yana</p>
<p>is apparently this beautiful</p>
<p>tall brunette</p>
<p>dark eyes and a very warm and</p>
<p>inviting smile</p>
<p>her friends and family</p>
<p>would describe</p>
<p>yana as like a very</p>
<p>happy person</p>
<p>with a strong character and</p>
<p>a fighting spirit</p>
<p>most she was just</p>
<p>smart as hell too okay because she was</p>
<p>studying law and college</p>
<p>and later she</p>
<p>would work as a tax office prosecutor</p>
<p>in the ukraine</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>brains okay</p>
<p>she was fluent in english</p>
<p>and russian</p>
<p>and she had really big</p>
<p>dreams of traveling the world</p>
<p>and working as an interpreter in 2014</p>
<p>while she was in her late 20s she decided to follow her</p>
<p>dreams and and that&rsquo;s when she came to the united</p>
<p>states in hopes for</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know like a better future you know</p>
<p>so she settled down in california</p>
<p>of course like los angeles</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where a lot of people you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not hating i&rsquo;m just saying like</p>
<p>so she settled down in</p>
<p>california and she was able to land</p>
<p>modeling jobs okay</p>
<p>and she started to make like a career out of it</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>clear how or where blake and</p>
<p>yana met amanda&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>they spread rumors that yana</p>
<p>remember amanda is the ex wife</p>
<p>so one night they find out that blake is seeing the</p>
<p>siana girl right</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re all over you know typical</p>
<p>girls are all over and they start</p>
<p>researching her like looking into her</p>
<p>background and they believe that she was working for an</p>
<p>escort service and that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>where they met because they found racing and nude</p>
<p>photos of her on a</p>
<p>certain website</p>
<p>escort service or not blake was smitten</p>
<p>and he was like taking her out on lavish trips</p>
<p>expensive dinners and just</p>
<p>spoiling her</p>
<p>blake also bought her a condo</p>
<p>for the two of them to move into</p>
<p>and a mercedes she&rsquo;s believing that this guy is</p>
<p>magical okay he bought her car in a condo</p>
<p>great now blake</p>
<p>did tell yana</p>
<p>about amanda</p>
<p>the ex wife</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t hide</p>
<p>his past from her and he didn&rsquo;t want like any</p>
<p>double life</p>
<p>vibes going on but he did tell her that his</p>
<p>marriage was over</p>
<p>when in reality</p>
<p>he was still very much married</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry i already called her the ex wife but at this</p>
<p>point they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exes yet because he did file for divorce</p>
<p>later that year</p>
<p>but by no means were they anywhere</p>
<p>near it being</p>
<p>finalized and being exes officially</p>
<p>so technically he was</p>
<p>still married</p>
<p>you get it you get it you get it you get it</p>
<p>you get it you get it good</p>
<p>so after a few</p>
<p>months of dating</p>
<p>blake he proposed</p>
<p>to iana he&rsquo;s like i just love you so much oh my god</p>
<p>and he proposes to her</p>
<p>and then not long after that</p>
<p>he was now expecting</p>
<p>not one kid but two</p>
<p>because his ex wife was pregnant</p>
<p>jana was pregnant she got pregnant in august of</p>
<p>twenty fifteen</p>
<p>yeah just being very</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being very messy</p>
<p>and yana was really</p>
<p>excited because she</p>
<p>always knew she wanted to be a mother</p>
<p>she just knew it was something she wanted to do</p>
<p>and on may third</p>
<p>twenty sixteen</p>
<p>yana gave birth to</p>
<p>their daughter</p>
<p>she was thrilled</p>
<p>so after giving</p>
<p>birth to her daughter</p>
<p>it seemed to yawn</p>
<p>that her life was pretty perfect</p>
<p>she had a new baby girl right</p>
<p>she was totally in love with this guy</p>
<p>blankie and</p>
<p>she was with like a pretty wealthy man who loved her</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be mad at that</p>
<p>but blake was</p>
<p>definitely not on the same page</p>
<p>okay he was a little stress aholic over here</p>
<p>he based off</p>
<p>some text messages that he had sent to his friends</p>
<p>he was worried that some of his brother&rsquo;s gambling</p>
<p>debts might</p>
<p>cause him to lose</p>
<p>everything i guess</p>
<p>his brother</p>
<p>cody had developed a bit of a gambling problem</p>
<p>which we knew</p>
<p>about this from the</p>
<p>celebrity ring</p>
<p>that was going on but</p>
<p>he now also owed</p>
<p>quite a lot of</p>
<p>money to some russian mobsters</p>
<p>and blake now was afraid that they or</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>associated with his brother&rsquo;s gambling game</p>
<p>would come after him and threaten his family</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>gonna get messy and he knew it was</p>
<p>gonna get messy</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of panicking</p>
<p>okay so gambling debt that sucks</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t the only</p>
<p>thing that was stressing</p>
<p>blake out you see</p>
<p>this little bozo over here bozo blake</p>
<p>yeah he seemed</p>
<p>to have gotten himself into a little bit of a pickle</p>
<p>and it came to his love life</p>
<p>you see how</p>
<p>he had a wife</p>
<p>right that he was in the process of divorcing</p>
<p>a fiance that had just</p>
<p>given birth to</p>
<p>their child</p>
<p>and a mistress</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s juggling</p>
<p>three women like</p>
<p>how do you have the time</p>
<p>how do you how do you do that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>would you even want that that</p>
<p>sounds like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a</p>
<p>heart attack or an</p>
<p>ulcer in like two minutes</p>
<p>three women in her life</p>
<p>okay so blake&rsquo;s</p>
<p>third girlfriend the mistress</p>
<p>she actually worked with him she was like a</p>
<p>storyboard artist</p>
<p>her name was constance</p>
<p>and blake also</p>
<p>he ended up buying her a condo to live in</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even that far from the home that he shared with iana</p>
<p>yeah it was like down the</p>
<p>street and i</p>
<p>guess i just made it</p>
<p>super easy for him like just</p>
<p>very convenient he just pop on pop on out go down the</p>
<p>street pop on into his mistress</p>
<p>this guy is so</p>
<p>stupid i know</p>
<p>this guy is such a dumbass</p>
<p>okay so he&rsquo;s got all these</p>
<p>girlfriends</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing the most we don&rsquo;t know why and she</p>
<p>sounds so stressful</p>
<p>but what blake didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>was that constance the new mistress girl</p>
<p>she contacted</p>
<p>his ex wife</p>
<p>amanda okay</p>
<p>she found her somehow</p>
<p>cause you know how we are investigators</p>
<p>so she tells amanda</p>
<p>who she was</p>
<p>and her reasoning behind the introduction</p>
<p>was to tell amanda</p>
<p>about yana because this constance</p>
<p>girl was like i</p>
<p>found this other girl named yana</p>
<p>and i believe like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s girl number two</p>
<p>constance just seemed to be very jealous</p>
<p>and wanted to make sure that amanda knew what was</p>
<p>going on too</p>
<p>you know if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going down we&rsquo;re all going down</p>
<p>but they kind of formed a</p>
<p>weird friendship over</p>
<p>their hatred or</p>
<p>mutual hatred for yana</p>
<p>yeah yana not the guy</p>
<p>blakey not him</p>
<p>they hate the girl</p>
<p>so they would text each</p>
<p>other saying shit like we</p>
<p>should get yana deported</p>
<p>they were just being evil little rodents</p>
<p>okay just nasty</p>
<p>and they were they&rsquo;re mad at the</p>
<p>wrong person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not who you</p>
<p>should be mad at you</p>
<p>should be mad at</p>
<p>blake the douchebag over here</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s he doing with</p>
<p>three girlfriends</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s worth that i&rsquo;m like foaming at the mouth um</p>
<p>so they are just being evil little rodents</p>
<p>okay and either</p>
<p>way the friendship between amanda and constance</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>weird and they</p>
<p>should have been more</p>
<p>focused on taking</p>
<p>blake down but</p>
<p>why do girls do that so yana</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s having problems of her own</p>
<p>it seems like blake is</p>
<p>extra stressed lately</p>
<p>and it just seems like</p>
<p>things are really bubbling up inside of him</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>becoming more controlling over her</p>
<p>um for example</p>
<p>while jana was</p>
<p>still recovering from her c section</p>
<p>blake threatened to</p>
<p>leave her if</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t have sex with him when he demanded it</p>
<p>yeah gross ass pig</p>
<p>but i mean this is the</p>
<p>freaking kind of person this guy was gross</p>
<p>and like if that&rsquo;s not bad enough</p>
<p>blake would</p>
<p>apparently also ask her if he</p>
<p>could leave her</p>
<p>to go out with another woman</p>
<p>i mean i was</p>
<p>about to say at</p>
<p>least he&rsquo;s telling her</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t make it better</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s demanding</p>
<p>sex from someone who just gave him a baby right</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s healing from surgery</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s asking or telling her that he&rsquo;s gonna go</p>
<p>sleep with another</p>
<p>woman it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>he just had this poor girl</p>
<p>under his thumb like she was</p>
<p>caught up in it all poor thing</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever been in one of</p>
<p>these relationships</p>
<p>look a lot of you are</p>
<p>thinking why</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t she just</p>
<p>leave and let me tell you right now</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever been in one of</p>
<p>these relationships</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really difficult to get out okay</p>
<p>you become brainwashed</p>
<p>you become stuck you feel you can&rsquo;t go anywhere</p>
<p>that without them you&rsquo;re nothing they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna destroy you they threaten</p>
<p>you they just</p>
<p>consume your</p>
<p>whole life and you become like very addicted</p>
<p>to this person&rsquo;s love it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>strange and</p>
<p>you truly feel like you can&rsquo;t get out of it</p>
<p>so yana&rsquo;s mom was coming out her name&rsquo;s olga</p>
<p>okay so she&rsquo;s coming out and she you know she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna help her</p>
<p>daughter just had a newborn baby</p>
<p>you know so mom wants to help and be there for her</p>
<p>daughter in this moment and you know you know</p>
<p>you know great</p>
<p>so her mom comes out and then somehow</p>
<p>blake convinces</p>
<p>um yana&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>to keep the newborn baby at the</p>
<p>apartment she was renting</p>
<p>so yana could take like take</p>
<p>better care of him the baby was distracting</p>
<p>that baby no</p>
<p>distracting you need to take care of me i&rsquo;m the baby</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>blake is saying</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m the baby</p>
<p>he asked can your mom take it like</p>
<p>anyways olga</p>
<p>ends up telling her</p>
<p>daughter like this is not okay okay</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s controlling you like a hawk</p>
<p>he wants you to do</p>
<p>everything he wants and</p>
<p>yana is like well i love him so it&rsquo;s fine but her mom</p>
<p>is trying to like warn her and help her get out or at</p>
<p>least see what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>going on so</p>

<p>night of may 20th</p>

<p>which is a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like why the hell are you in jail</p>
<p>well let me tell you</p>
<p>blake was arrested on suspicion of</p>
<p>sexual assault</p>
<p>constance girl number three</p>
<p>she accused</p>
<p>blake of raping her</p>
<p>and now prior to this</p>
<p>jana she didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about this constance</p>
<p>girl but boy</p>
<p>did she know</p>
<p>now she knew</p>
<p>she knew now and she was very</p>
<p>upset to say the least yana</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t just find out</p>
<p>about him cheating</p>
<p>everything was uncovered she found out</p>
<p>about the condo he bought for her yeah</p>
<p>that it was just down the street</p>
<p>she could look out the window and be like oh</p>
<p>okay he was there</p>
<p>it all came to the surface</p>
<p>like all of his lies</p>
<p>how long it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>going on i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just that&rsquo;s sad that sucks</p>
<p>so jana finally</p>
<p>stood up for herself and she told blake</p>
<p>that she was done</p>
<p>right she was done and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna move in with her mother and</p>
<p>she can&rsquo;t take it anymore good for her</p>
<p>so yana and the baby move in with her mom at the</p>
<p>apartment that mom was renting</p>
<p>and a couple days</p>
<p>later yana and mom are out</p>
<p>shopping for a</p>
<p>stroller and</p>
<p>blake is like texting yana</p>
<p>saying like i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>sorry i love you like i can&rsquo;t live without you</p>
<p>and mom saw</p>
<p>giannis attitude just</p>
<p>completely change</p>
<p>she was like</p>
<p>happy again</p>
<p>and she tells her mom like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go see him</p>
<p>will you keep the baby for a bit</p>
<p>and her mom&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>excited about that she is not thrilled</p>
<p>but she cannot convince</p>
<p>yana to stay home</p>
<p>but she takes her</p>
<p>granddaughter the baby and</p>
<p>yana goes back</p>
<p>over to blake&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house or their old condo you know</p>
<p>so yes the next day</p>
<p>on may twenty fourth</p>
<p>jana had not returned to her mom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment so</p>
<p>olga is sending her</p>
<p>daughter a bunch of text messages like</p>
<p>where are you</p>
<p>you know yes</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s getting no response</p>
<p>so then she</p>
<p>tries to call</p>
<p>yana and she&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>no response</p>
<p>so she keeps calling she keeps texting like a</p>
<p>dozen times no answer she</p>
<p>leaves voicemails</p>
<p>and yana just</p>
<p>never calls her back</p>
<p>so all the resorts to i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>laughing because</p>
<p>she resorts to sending emails</p>
<p>which means like she&rsquo;s really not responding so she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>emailing her</p>
<p>daughter like what the hell</p>
<p>where are you</p>
<p>nothing at this point</p>
<p>olga knows that something is not</p>
<p>right something is very</p>
<p>wrong so mom</p>
<p>decides you know what i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna go down to the</p>
<p>apartment not far</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just gonna see</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>you know she has a</p>
<p>three week old baby with her</p>
<p>and her daughter&rsquo;s missing right</p>
<p>so she calls the police</p>
<p>okay she calls him up</p>
<p>and they just kind of blow her off</p>
<p>saying that yana hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>missing for long enough and they&rsquo;re sure that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come back</p>
<p>and she i mean what are you supposed to do in that case</p>
<p>one of the police</p>
<p>officers tell you that you know it&rsquo;s frustrating</p>
<p>mom decides to take matters into her own hands</p>
<p>so olga she goes down to</p>
<p>blake and yana&rsquo;s west hollywood apartment</p>
<p>and then she sees that there&rsquo;s an open window</p>
<p>right so she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>standing outside she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>screaming she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>blake open the door it&rsquo;s me so she&rsquo;s yelling</p>
<p>blake blake you know</p>
<p>and blake ends up coming over to the window</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge</p>
<p>her he just</p>
<p>closes the window</p>
<p>and then he just disappears back into the</p>
<p>apartment so all goes like oh fuck no</p>
<p>she ends up</p>
<p>going around to the backside of the</p>
<p>building and then she finds that another tenant</p>
<p>is like leaving the complex</p>
<p>so the doors open</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s able to get in because it&rsquo;s locked you know</p>
<p>she ends up getting into the complex</p>
<p>and then she goes to</p>
<p>blake&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s knocking and she&rsquo;s ringing the doorbell</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s getting no answer</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like i know you&rsquo;re in there i just</p>
<p>literally saw you</p>
<p>stop being dumb</p>
<p>so olga calls the police</p>
<p>again and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>finally able to convince two officers to do a wellness</p>
<p>check on yana</p>
<p>so they come out</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re knocking on</p>
<p>blake&rsquo;s door but</p>
<p>blake refuses to answer</p>
<p>so blake ends</p>
<p>up opening the door and he kind of like starts</p>
<p>talking through the door being like what do you want</p>
<p>to the police</p>
<p>yeah and they&rsquo;re like we&rsquo;re looking for ayana</p>
<p>blake&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yana&rsquo;s fine you can go</p>
<p>but the cops are waiting because they want to</p>
<p>see her right</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing around and they&rsquo;re not leaving</p>
<p>and blake is telling the police officers and</p>
<p>those outside like</p>
<p>yana&rsquo;s fine she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t wanna come out i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why cause this to me</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>right but whatever</p>
<p>cause they didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>proof that there was a problem so the police</p>
<p>ended up leaving</p>
<p>but i feel like the fact that they didn&rsquo;t see hannah</p>
<p>that should have been</p>
<p>proof enough that</p>
<p>there was a problem cause i</p>
<p>never saw her</p>
<p>like was just like yeah she&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that sweetie</p>
<p>yeah she told me that she&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>no you should</p>
<p>leave so olga</p>
<p>her mom ends up</p>
<p>going home cause like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>feels like there&rsquo;s nothing she</p>
<p>could do poor thing</p>
<p>so she ends up</p>
<p>going home and then the next day on may 26</p>
<p>olga she&rsquo;s had enough</p>
<p>okay she&rsquo;s had enough and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take matters into her own hands</p>
<p>she calls 911 saying that she needs their help</p>
<p>and this time the police come to the apartment</p>
<p>and she tells them that</p>
<p>she fears yana</p>
<p>might be in medical distress</p>
<p>because she had just</p>
<p>given birth</p>
<p>so the police arrived</p>
<p>at the complex at 11 50</p>
<p>a m on may 26</p>
<p>they get a key from the realtor</p>
<p>but when they try to open the door</p>
<p>they find that the</p>
<p>apartment had been locked from the inside</p>
<p>they had like one of</p>
<p>those bar locks in the</p>
<p>hotel rooms</p>
<p>you know so this</p>
<p>leaves the cops with the only option to</p>
<p>break the door down so once they get the door</p>
<p>down they walk down the hallway</p>
<p>and they see that the door lean to the bedrooms</p>
<p>it was not just locked but it was also like barricaded</p>
<p>with furniture</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird right</p>
<p>whenever it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in that room</p>
<p>so after cops get through the barricade</p>
<p>they take the door off its</p>
<p>hinges and that&rsquo;s when police get</p>
<p>their real first</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>of what they</p>
<p>might be in for</p>
<p>as they make their way</p>
<p>into the master bedroom they look in the</p>
<p>guest bedroom and see</p>
<p>blood everywhere</p>
<p>there is blood all over the headboard and on the walls</p>
<p>so when they got into the master bedroom</p>
<p>they discovered that it was also locked and</p>
<p>barricaded and blake</p>
<p>he got the mattress from the</p>
<p>guest bedroom</p>
<p>and he put it up</p>
<p>against the door</p>
<p>so the police were like hey</p>
<p>come out if there&rsquo;s anyone inside like you</p>
<p>should come out</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here and</p>
<p>blake calls out from inside the bedroom</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m not coming out because you guys are</p>
<p>going to beat me up and</p>
<p>and there the cops are like well yeah of course we are</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna beat you up</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking for yana</p>
<p>but we might beat you up you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>reassure him that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna beat him up so they&rsquo;re asking like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s yana we&rsquo;re just looking for yana</p>
<p>and blake&rsquo;s yelling at them like she&rsquo;s not here</p>
<p>and the cops are</p>
<p>thinking like yeah freaking</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>so at some point</p>
<p>prior to the police showing up</p>
<p>blake from inside the</p>
<p>house he had called his accountant</p>
<p>um i thought it was i</p>
<p>would think it was his attorney but i</p>
<p>guess it was an accountant</p>
<p>for some reason</p>
<p>the accountant</p>
<p>went to the</p>
<p>house okay and they</p>
<p>showed up with the police</p>
<p>and the accountant is trying to talk to</p>
<p>blake to come out of the bedroom with the police</p>
<p>cause this is a man that like he trusts so</p>
<p>it was gonna work</p>
<p>finally blake</p>
<p>is like okay i&rsquo;ll come out but can you pass me some</p>
<p>clothes that are in the living room</p>
<p>and the accountant is like sure let me go get them</p>
<p>and the cops are no</p>
<p>dummies so they</p>
<p>search to close and</p>
<p>first they find</p>
<p>blake&rsquo;s passport in the pockets</p>
<p>and also four thousand dollars in cash</p>
<p>so clearly the guy was trying to make</p>
<p>an escape right he&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna jump out the window or something</p>
<p>and run for it</p>
<p>the accountant calls out like hey man i&rsquo;ve got your</p>
<p>clothes and then finally</p>
<p>blake opens up the door</p>
<p>and he walks out and only</p>
<p>a pair of his boxer shorts</p>
<p>and behind him</p>
<p>the police see a naked body</p>
<p>of 30 year old yana</p>
<p>laying on the bed</p>
<p>covered by a red</p>
<p>mickey mouse</p>
<p>blanket so they go</p>
<p>in and yana is pronounced</p>
<p>dead at 1 02pm</p>
<p>so police ask blake</p>
<p>how did you</p>
<p>wanna die you know and</p>
<p>blake was like</p>
<p>oh i didn&rsquo;t even know she was dead i thought she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s like i know she was dead</p>
<p>i hate this guy just a</p>
<p>waste of our damn time</p>
<p>and the cops are like yeah she&rsquo;s dead in that bad</p>
<p>right behind you</p>
<p>and then blake looks at them and goes well i</p>
<p>guess you&rsquo;ll have to find out who did it then</p>
<p>science is gonna tell you who did this</p>
<p>yeah science is</p>
<p>gonna tell us blakey</p>
<p>i want to say this guy has gone</p>
<p>completely mental but</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the crime scene</p>
<p>is reported as the</p>
<p>most gruesome murder in the history of los angeles or</p>
<p>west hollywood i</p>
<p>should say if not los angeles</p>
<p>and then when the cops are finally able to get</p>
<p>to the master bedroom they find iana laying on the bed</p>
<p>her head was on her pillow and she&rsquo;s covered</p>
<p>again by that red</p>
<p>mickey mouse like</p>
<p>blanket it looks like it</p>
<p>might have been</p>
<p>taken from the</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s room and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>covered all the way up</p>
<p>to her chin with the blanket</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a pillow next to her and it has like a</p>
<p>fresh indent</p>
<p>in it as if someone had been</p>
<p>lying next to her</p>
<p>cops describe her as almost looking peaceful</p>
<p>but there was a</p>
<p>large blood</p>
<p>stain on the wall that looked like someone</p>
<p>had tried to</p>
<p>clean it up</p>
<p>when the police</p>
<p>first inspect</p>
<p>the body they discovered that she okay this is</p>
<p>gonna gruesome</p>
<p>kind of gruesome it&rsquo;s a lot gruesome actually fyi okay</p>
<p>when the cops</p>
<p>first inspect</p>
<p>jana&rsquo;s body they discover that she had been scalped</p>
<p>yeah scalped</p>
<p>police find</p>
<p>pieces of her</p>
<p>flesh in the bed</p>
<p>behind the mattress and on the floor</p>
<p>they find one of her eyebrows</p>
<p>one of her eyebrows</p>
<p>cut off removed</p>
<p>thrown thrown on the floor near the bed</p>
<p>and they noticed she&rsquo;s missing an ear</p>
<p>the cops also noticed something</p>
<p>weird about giannis body aside from the</p>
<p>mutilation she was extremely pale</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not all that&rsquo;s weird what&rsquo;s super weird</p>
<p>was that there was like</p>
<p>a lack of blood at the crime scene</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of blood like where was the blood</p>
<p>she was brutally attacked she was</p>
<p>scalped and you know she was brutally murdered</p>
<p>there should have been more</p>
<p>blood there should have been blood everywhere</p>
<p>and there were only some spots on the</p>
<p>floor next to the bed</p>
<p>but the bedsheet that jana was laying on was</p>
<p>completely clean</p>
<p>so police begin to inspect the crime scene more closely</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when they</p>
<p>begin to understand what really</p>
<p>really happened</p>
<p>blood spatter evidence suggested that</p>
<p>yana was on the bed when the attack first started</p>
<p>and then in the bedroom they find a</p>
<p>knife and a razor that were probably used on her to</p>
<p>do some shit that&rsquo;s messed up</p>
<p>and after removing the bed sheets</p>
<p>cops find that the mattress is</p>
<p>stained with blood</p>
<p>but the sheet was clean and the mattress</p>
<p>at the time was dry</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re like well she must have been</p>
<p>moved somewhere else in the</p>
<p>apartment so the police come out and they use</p>
<p>um that blue star it&rsquo;s that like a</p>
<p>what do you call that stuff it lights up all the blood</p>
<p>like you spray it onto a surface</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s been blood on the surface it</p>
<p>lights up blue you&rsquo;ve seen it and all the crime</p>
<p>stuff right</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s actually fascinating right</p>
<p>because you just</p>
<p>spray the stuff and it finds blood they</p>
<p>spray it okay they</p>
<p>spray it in like the bathroom and</p>
<p>stuff in the living room what not</p>
<p>and the blue star it reveals</p>
<p>where the blood had once been and like</p>
<p>where cleaning</p>
<p>substances had been used to remove it because it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>visible to the eye but it was</p>
<p>visible to the blue</p>
<p>light so cops</p>
<p>spray the room and it just lights up</p>
<p>okay it was bright it actually lit up the hallway</p>
<p>there was evidence that</p>
<p>blood had been on the</p>
<p>floors and the walls</p>
<p>same thing with the</p>
<p>guest bedroom it just look like</p>
<p>are super fucked up like</p>
<p>nightclub cause it was so blue it said it was very</p>
<p>very bright</p>
<p>also investigators go and</p>
<p>check the bathroom</p>
<p>and in there they find a</p>
<p>razor with clumps of dark hair</p>
<p>stuck to it</p>
<p>and there are some</p>
<p>blood stains and hair in the tub</p>
<p>but otherwise it looks</p>
<p>super clean</p>
<p>but of course when they</p>
<p>sprayed that blue star</p>
<p>stuff it the</p>
<p>whole bathroom just</p>
<p>shined bright</p>
<p>like a diamond</p>
<p>it just like was</p>
<p>everything was covered in</p>
<p>blood and he</p>
<p>cleaned it up</p>
<p>yeah just i got you</p>
<p>police think that maybe after</p>
<p>blake dragged her around the apartment he then</p>
<p>got her into the bathroom and gave her a bath</p>
<p>and when they first arrived they had noticed that the</p>
<p>water was running in the tub</p>
<p>and someone went and turned off</p>
<p>the water when the cops first arrived</p>
<p>like yesterday</p>
<p>or you know the yesterday in the story</p>
<p>i mean clearly there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>concrete evidence that</p>
<p>the bathtub was heavily used</p>
<p>clearly blake had used a lot of cleaning supplies to</p>
<p>clean up that much blood but there&rsquo;s no evidence of</p>
<p>those cleaning supplies inside of the apartment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the police notice that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trash chute</p>
<p>like right near the door to their apartment so</p>
<p>they hurry on downstairs</p>
<p>to the basement and that&rsquo;s where they get 11</p>
<p>trash bags that are full of evidence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they find the bloody sheets bloody clothes</p>
<p>and then in the trash bags they also find a couple</p>
<p>of jana&rsquo;s body parts</p>
<p>they found like her ear and stuff it was just</p>
<p>not ideal but i mean they found it but that&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>whatever you know</p>
<p>blake sucks ass</p>
<p>cops and find a bed</p>
<p>skirt and on this bed skirt it had a bloody handprint</p>
<p>but not just any bloody handprint oh nene</p>
<p>it was a handprint that was an</p>
<p>exact match to blake&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like yes jackpot</p>
<p>hello we did it mystery solved</p>
<p>so cops know for sure that this guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s involved because</p>
<p>blake at the time was missing the top part of his pinky</p>
<p>on his right hand</p>
<p>and so was the handprint</p>
<p>mystery solved</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>just another one that could have been prevented</p>
<p>so obviously blake</p>
<p>arrested okay</p>
<p>taken down to the station</p>
<p>and they take his mug shot</p>
<p>super weird mug shot because he&rsquo;s like has all</p>
<p>these scratches and bruises all over his face</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like smiling</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just creepy yeah</p>
<p>so on may thirty first blake makes a court appearance</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s wearing his padded</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s wearing a padded suicide jacket</p>
<p>he has chains wrapped around his wrist and they cuffed</p>
<p>they cuffed in the front of his body</p>
<p>he was being formally charged with murder torture</p>
<p>mayhem and aggravated</p>
<p>mayhem mayhem</p>
<p>mayhem mayhem</p>
<p>mayhem great</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just funny because like</p>
<p>there are so many cases</p>
<p>where people plead not guilty you&rsquo;re like dude</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think they are guilty you know like they might</p>
<p>actually not be guilty</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s like dumb little</p>
<p>rowboats like this guy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s obvious that he&rsquo;s guilty but he&rsquo;s like hmm</p>
<p>not guilty like what&rsquo;s he</p>
<p>think is gonna happen</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna agree with that don&rsquo;t you just be honest</p>
<p>save us all some damn time</p>
<p>so they gave him a test with psychiatrist to see if he</p>
<p>could stand trial</p>
<p>he passes with flying colors he can</p>
<p>definitely stand trial</p>
<p>the prosecution gets to work</p>
<p>building their case</p>
<p>right so the</p>
<p>biggest question for them was like what was the motive</p>
<p>why did blake kill yana</p>
<p>so during interrogation</p>
<p>blake told cops at one</p>
<p>point quote</p>
<p>women don&rsquo;t like me if it wasn&rsquo;t for</p>
<p>money women</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t like me</p>
<p>end quote we also know that blake</p>
<p>tried to control jana</p>
<p>after she gave</p>
<p>birth forcing her to have sex with him</p>
<p>so maybe he felt like he was losing control over her</p>
<p>during the investigation police had a lot of roadblocks</p>
<p>no one who knew</p>
<p>blank want to talk to them</p>
<p>like nobody</p>
<p>no family no friends</p>
<p>no one want to</p>
<p>speak on camera</p>
<p>no one to go into court</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even want to like show</p>
<p>their face in</p>
<p>court at all in the pews is it</p>
<p>are they called pews</p>
<p>i always forget to look that up</p>
<p>but no one so they&rsquo;re 100 relying on evidence</p>
<p>for this whole case</p>
<p>well and the autopsy</p>
<p>which good thing they have like hardcore evidence</p>
<p>so some of the biggest</p>
<p>pieces of evidence for this case</p>
<p>was the autopsy report</p>
<p>which was finally</p>
<p>released to the public on september twentieth</p>
<p>twenty seventeen</p>
<p>it said that yana</p>
<p>she was killed</p>
<p>between may twenty</p>
<p>third and may twenty six</p>
<p>on her autopsy</p>
<p>report it said that she had</p>
<p>a lot of head trauma</p>
<p>but most of all</p>
<p>she had no blood in her</p>
<p>system like</p>
<p>she okay look</p>
<p>the average</p>
<p>human contains</p>
<p>about five liters of</p>
<p>blood correct</p>
<p>yes which is</p>
<p>about one and a half gallons</p>
<p>that really</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem like that much huh okay</p>
<p>well she was</p>
<p>found with less than a teaspoon</p>
<p>left in her so</p>
<p>ultimately this poor girl bled to death</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like not a</p>
<p>super common way to</p>
<p>kill somebody</p>
<p>the autopsy report also clearly</p>
<p>spells out exactly what the police saw when they</p>
<p>entered the bedroom</p>
<p>jana&rsquo;s scalp was removed from the body her</p>
<p>skull had been stripped down to the surface of her bone</p>
<p>actually there was no</p>
<p>scalp present</p>
<p>except for like little bits and</p>
<p>pieces on the back of her neck</p>
<p>portions of the</p>
<p>right side of</p>
<p>her face were torn all the way down to her jawline how</p>
<p>what the fuck was this guy doing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t what was he</p>
<p>her right ear was missing okay there were a shit ton</p>
<p>of bruises and cuts on her face primarily</p>
<p>on the left side of her face</p>
<p>she had a human bite mark on the left side of her face</p>
<p>she had lived for at</p>
<p>least eight</p>
<p>hours approximately</p>
<p>after receiving the</p>
<p>scalp injury</p>
<p>and the bruise on her collarbone</p>
<p>which is awful</p>
<p>cause that means she was alive</p>
<p>during scalpage</p>
<p>this poor yana</p>
<p>she just poor thing</p>
<p>and you know what&rsquo;s sad is like yana&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother olga</p>
<p>she was there at</p>
<p>the court listening to all this like i</p>
<p>could not imagine</p>
<p>i say with blake it&rsquo;s just kind of like</p>
<p>some people just deserve to go</p>
<p>like off with his head</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>these moments</p>
<p>remember his book</p>
<p>just saying</p>
<p>just saying he</p>
<p>might have used it as a blueprint</p>
<p>so when the</p>
<p>trial first gets</p>
<p>going the prosecution</p>
<p>starts with</p>
<p>olga&rsquo;s testimony</p>
<p>she spoke she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak english</p>
<p>so she had several</p>
<p>court appointed interpreters for</p>
<p>trial which made it a little bit</p>
<p>challenging but</p>
<p>the prosecution showed a lot of</p>
<p>photos from the</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>just describing how</p>
<p>blake probably used the</p>
<p>knife and the</p>
<p>razor found in the bedroom and the bathroom to scalper</p>
<p>and they also just went into really</p>
<p>graphic details</p>
<p>about what he did to her</p>
<p>and the prosecution also had access to newer</p>
<p>technology that was able to</p>
<p>show like a 3d</p>
<p>model of the</p>
<p>crime scene that allowed them to turn on and off the</p>
<p>light that showed the blue star</p>
<p>so the jury</p>
<p>essentially</p>
<p>got to see exactly what the police saw at the</p>
<p>crime scene when they were there</p>
<p>which is fascinating</p>
<p>prosecutors also provided text messages showing that</p>
<p>blake had ordered food from postmates</p>
<p>on several occasions</p>
<p>during the time</p>
<p>when yana was</p>
<p>most likely dying</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting postmates</p>
<p>oh god right he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still hungry oh good</p>
<p>he like left specific</p>
<p>instructions to the postmates person like do not</p>
<p>knock on door just</p>
<p>leave it outside</p>
<p>when he ordered the food he was</p>
<p>using on his phone</p>
<p>maybe he wanted to make it look like she was</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>ordering postmates</p>
<p>you know hmm</p>
<p>so then the prosecutors they also brought up</p>
<p>blake&rsquo;s graphic</p>
<p>novel remember syndrome</p>
<p>and remember remember it had</p>
<p>those guys hanging by</p>
<p>their feet and the woman</p>
<p>lying in the bloody bed</p>
<p>the prosecution felt that</p>
<p>like the book pretty much</p>
<p>was a blueprint</p>
<p>that blake might have followed for murdering jana when</p>
<p>blake was questioned as to why</p>
<p>those graphic</p>
<p>scenes were in his book like did he</p>
<p>did he get the ideas from the book</p>
<p>he pretty much told him that he</p>
<p>had done a lot of research on serial killers and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what inspired his book not what his</p>
<p>what he did to yana</p>
<p>no just defense</p>
<p>so the trial</p>
<p>ended up lasting only a week it was a easy</p>
<p>trial it seems like</p>
<p>in june of twenty eighteen</p>
<p>after a ninety</p>
<p>minute deliberation</p>
<p>the jury thirty</p>
<p>eight year old</p>
<p>blake was convicted of</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>and supplemental charges of torture and mayhem</p>
<p>on his fiance jana</p>
<p>oh yeah as he deserves</p>
<p>he was sentenced</p>
<p>to life in prison with no chance of for all</p>
<p>and he is still serving his sentence at</p>
<p>california correctional institution</p>
<p>he should have got the</p>
<p>death penalty let&rsquo;s be honest</p>
<p>cody he was the only family</p>
<p>member to show support for</p>
<p>blake but he refused to make any comments to the press</p>
<p>come out say anything</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like nope not</p>
<p>touching that</p>
<p>remember amanda</p>
<p>blake&rsquo;s ex wife</p>
<p>she only showed up</p>
<p>after the verdict had been read</p>
<p>and despite her</p>
<p>initial hatred towards</p>
<p>jana because</p>
<p>jana stole her husband</p>
<p>amanda was shocked when she learned</p>
<p>about jana&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>and she also cut</p>
<p>ties with constance</p>
<p>thinking she was a threat to her and her kids</p>
<p>and she eventually even got a restraining order</p>
<p>against constance</p>
<p>at no point during the</p>
<p>trial or after the verdict had been read</p>
<p>did blake or anyone from his family</p>
<p>reach out to</p>
<p>olga to offer</p>
<p>child support</p>
<p>for the baby remember there&rsquo;s a baby</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a baby</p>
<p>no one reached out to help</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even ask for like for custody</p>
<p>not that they</p>
<p>should have but it was like</p>
<p>do they not care</p>
<p>so olga she went</p>
<p>ahead and filed a</p>
<p>sixty five million dollar lawsuit a</p>
<p>civil lawsuit</p>
<p>and a los angeles</p>
<p>judge ordered</p>
<p>blake to pay her</p>
<p>forty one point six million dollars</p>
<p>to yana&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>will he pay it i don&rsquo;t know how that</p>
<p>stuff works</p>
<p>cause it seems like they</p>
<p>never pay it</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i should look into that</p>
<p>so that my friends is the</p>
<p>awful story</p>
<p>about blake lapel and how he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely what</p>
<p>would you call this guy</p>
<p>i wanna call him a psycho but i feel like</p>
<p>that word just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do it justice anymore because it&rsquo;s so overused</p>
<p>overused for</p>
<p>everything like oh my god that&rsquo;s psycho</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like so what do you call this guy</p>
<p>like satan he&rsquo;s fucking satan</p>
<p>okay he is um a clown</p>

<p>worse than a</p>
<p>clown he&rsquo;s ugh</p>
<p>he ugh a spoiled little brat</p>
<p>who wanted money</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get his way</p>
<p>and then just got really</p>
<p>angry and then did some sick shit</p>
