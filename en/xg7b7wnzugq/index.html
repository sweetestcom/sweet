<p>i just wanted to uh get it straight from 
you incredible story about lilliana so um  </p>
<p>can you tell me just a little bit in your 
own words what what happened initially i know  </p>
<p>uh you told you know you wrote everything 
out but maybe you could summarize it  </p>
<p>sure um so liliana was seven months old when 
we both moved my husband and i moved to asia  </p>
<p>to become language students and we were 
very happy there things were going well  </p>
<p>liliana had been having a lot of 
you know crying as a young infant  </p>
<p>right after her inoculations and so i didn&rsquo;t 
connect any dots we just kept on vaccinating and  </p>
<p>things like that but when we got to asia things 
were going fine um but then we noticed directly  </p>
<p>after her inoculation for the mmr and the typhoid 
um she started losing weight dramatically she lost  </p>
<p>over six pounds in two weeks uh and she was very 
small she was only two and a half years old at  </p>
<p>that time she&rsquo;s four now um and so uh yeah i was 
really concerned i took her to the pediatrician  </p>
<p>and he misdiagnosed her with a virus without 
doing any testing whatsoever and gave me a um  </p>
<p>like uh what do you call that a um uh antibiotic 
and i decided i just felt really weird about that  </p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t like the idea of giving her an antibiotic 
without knowing that it was a virus and she&rsquo;d had  </p>
<p>lots of viruses in the past but this was different 
it was just weird like the sudden losing weight  </p>
<p>the constant thirst i i didn&rsquo;t know the signs 
of diabetes at all and so i didn&rsquo;t know what to  </p>
<p>make but i just knew it was not a virus this is 
weird um but she kept on getting worse and worse  </p>
<p>and worse we were trying to feed her and she 
just could not move bowels that was the most  </p>
<p>horrible thing like to see her in that state 
where she was in so much pain crying and crying  </p>
<p>and her belly was just so big and i knew 
she needed to get that out but she couldn&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>and so finally i took her to the pediatrician 
again and he gave me a suppository and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like um it was so horrible just doing that 
to her and then she she went into seizures  </p>
<p>because it was so painful and um so she 
was able to pass a small bowel but still  </p>
<p>she was just losing all that weight and um 
so uh the day after that um i i you know  </p>
<p>i asked myself why now how how did i bring myself 
to actually go to a language lesson when she was  </p>
<p>in that condition but i i went to my language 
lesson i came home um and she did not recognize me  </p>
<p>she was just sitting on the chair like 
zoned out like totally glazed over  </p>
<p>her breath was labored um i started talking to 
her and she like looked beyond me she wasn&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>even looking at me it was just the most scary 
thing and she got up to walk and just collapsed  </p>
<p>and i just panicked i was like i i don&rsquo;t know the 
doctor is not helping us with this i don&rsquo;t know  </p>
<p>what this is so i took a video of her and shot 
it to um a really good friend of ours who lived  </p>
<p>like super close praise god he was only like five 
minutes away they lived in the same neighborhood  </p>
<p>and so he watched the video immediately he was 
a nurse um also um american and so he he knew  </p>
<p>you know when he saw her he knew something was 
awful so he rushed to our house and did a urine  </p>
<p>analysis of her diaper keep in mind she wasn&rsquo;t 
potty trained she wasn&rsquo;t talking like she&rsquo;s a baby  </p>
<p>but he brought whatever those little sticks 
are called with him and he stuck that in  </p>
<p>her diaper and immediately said there&rsquo;s 
sugar in her diaper she has diabetes and i  </p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even know what type 1 diabetes was you 
know and he was like let&rsquo;s get in the car we&rsquo;ve  </p>
<p>got to go get you know get her to the er and 
um my husband was sick that day he had the flu  </p>
<p>but we we piled into the car and i was like 
i was so stressed and zoned i it was like  </p>
<p>my head was just going slow motion i couldn&rsquo;t 
process anything um so praise god that  </p>
<p>that guy the nurse our friend was able 
to drive us to the the um emergency room  </p>
<p>and the doctors there in this asian country 
did not know how to take care of diabetes  </p>
<p>type one so he kind of coached them through you 
know bringing her blood sugars down giving her a  </p>
<p>blood sugar test um you know what other tests need 
to be run like that c peptide and the whole you  </p>
<p>know gamut of tests i think you said their blood 
sugars were was 600 yes yes and of course me not  </p>
<p>knowing anything about diabetes we don&rsquo;t have 
a history of that in my family i didn&rsquo;t realize  </p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s life-threatening i didn&rsquo;t realize 
that that&rsquo;s called dka i didn&rsquo;t know anything  </p>
<p>so when they told me that i would you know i was 
still zoned out i didn&rsquo;t know what was going on  </p>
<p>so to me you know all you know them sticking her 
with different things and it was just so traumatic  </p>
<p>i almost passed out like watching her go through 
that kind of trauma and she&rsquo;s screaming and</p>
<p>you know like i can&rsquo;t even talk about it 
without i could imagine i could imagine  </p>
<p>then you what happened is um you probably 
got the blood sugars under control and the  </p>
<p>foods the doctors recommending were just all carb 
and uh you&rsquo;re kind of like what&rsquo;s going on yes yes  </p>
<p>uh there in the hospital she was hospitalized 
for 10 days during that time the nurses would  </p>
<p>come in and give her the shots the the insulin 
and then give her this bowl of rice with chicken  </p>
<p>you know and a little bit of you know 
sugary tea or something and and i you know i  </p>
<p>i really trusted doctors i trusted people that 
said they knew how to take care of diseases and so  </p>
<p>you know we fed it to her and then her her 
blood sugars would shoot through the roof  </p>
<p>and this went on for a couple months of course 
we were discharged we came home we had to move  </p>
<p>back to the states all that happened and her her 
endocrinologist here in the states was telling us  </p>
<p>the same thing give her everything she&rsquo;s already 
used to eating you know and she was eating normal  </p>
<p>kid food like the animal crackers and cheerios and 
sugar bombs and ice cream and cookies and crackers  </p>
<p>pancakes and syrup and all that good stuff and 
so we it was i was literally in tears every day  </p>
<p>like i would check her blood sugars and they would 
be 400 500 you know a couple hours after eating or  </p>
<p>even in the middle of the night you know because 
it was literally a roller coaster so i became so  </p>
<p>desperate and stressed out with this pattern 
i lost my trust in the medical establishment i  </p>
<p>thought this is not working it&rsquo;s just not managing 
this disease and um so i found your channel  </p>
<p>and that i can say that was a a um a direct 
answer to my husband and my prayers um  </p>
<p>yeah we were begging god daily like give either 
a cure or a way to manage this thing like to help  </p>
<p>our child not to have complications because i was 
reading scary articles i was seeing articles like  </p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not managed what&rsquo;s going to happen when 
she gets 30 40 50 years old right blindness the  </p>
<p>neuropathy all that stuff and it scared me sure so 
yeah so we we started looking i was looking like  </p>
<p>day and night and searching and i put in cure for 
diabetes type one in my search and somehow one of  </p>
<p>your videos popped up it wasn&rsquo;t a cure there is 
no cure that we know but wow um you were talking  </p>
<p>about i think you were talking about a cure for 
type 2 actually the ketone intermittent fasting  </p>
<p>and so i watched that and i was like well if 
it can do that for type 2 let&rsquo;s give it a shot  </p>
<p>and so she&rsquo;s been now in ketosis for over probably 
close to a year at this point i i&rsquo;ve lost track a  </p>
<p>little bit but she&rsquo;s doing great and you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re 
you&rsquo;re even going to the doctor saying what about  </p>
<p>this ketogenic diet and they probably weren&rsquo;t they 
weren&rsquo;t supporting it yeah no they still they&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>still kind of skeptical but at first they were 
telling us oh you&rsquo;re gonna cause seizures you&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>gonna you know her brain is gonna go downhill 
her cognitive function is gonna be just zero  </p>
<p>and all this scary stuff but after i watched and 
watched and watched every day i was watching your  </p>
<p>videos and i that gave me the confidence to say 
to the doctor this is the diet we decided to do  </p>
<p>and we believe our child is going to be okay 
we think it&rsquo;s going to be good for her and they  </p>
<p>said okay well just do it you know you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll 
talk to us later you&rsquo;ll be sorry and all kinds of  </p>
<p>things but but it you know that never happened 
she&rsquo;s only improved since starting this diet  </p>
<p>and even her a1c right has come way down yeah 
it&rsquo;s come way down yeah and then her blood sugars  </p>
<p>what&rsquo;s her blood sugars running um let&rsquo;s see 
when she gets up in the morning it&rsquo;s around 110  </p>
<p>maybe 90 to 110 somewhere in there 
that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a lot better than 600 yeah  </p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s still hard to manage sometimes because 
she is a child she can&rsquo;t do it by herself so it&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>me and my husband are doing it for her she does 
wear a pump and a cgm um you know which is helpful  </p>
<p>really helpful and she&rsquo;s the the cutest thing 
i&rsquo;ve ever seen she&rsquo;s so cute yeah she&rsquo;s sitting</p>
<p>here i told her we were going to talk to you 
and she was really excited oh i&rsquo;ve got i&rsquo;ve  </p>
<p>got your keto shake that she drinks here every 
day here she is oh dr Berg that is so awesome  </p>
<p>hey that looks familiar i&rsquo;ve seen that 
before yeah so here it is we love it oh wow  </p>
<p>every day i even put fresh kale in with it and 
mix it up with a little extra chocolate in there  </p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s awesome yeah low low carb of course 
so um so she she even watches some of the videos  </p>
<p>and learning some of the organs and she loves 
your videos she she memorized parts of them wow  </p>
<p>when you start going into your ad about you know 
like the the the little ad at the end she&rsquo;s like  </p>
<p>quoting it with you because you say that same ad 
after every single video that&rsquo;s so cute oh she&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>so adorable and uh so she&rsquo;s four and a half right 
now right yeah and she has she&rsquo;s like what second  </p>
<p>grade level reading yes yes she&rsquo;s been 
reading for a year now oh my goodness  </p>
<p>wow so she i i think i i attribute 
the cognitive function to the keto  </p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s not doing intermittent fasting of 
course she&rsquo;s too little for that but yeah just  </p>
<p>yeah her brain function went up dramatically 
absolutely i&rsquo;ve been shocked because i&rsquo;m not like  </p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not even doing official homeschooling yet 
this is like four years old wow yeah so amazing  </p>
<p>yeah because see the key you get that um like 
even our granddaughter lucy we she&rsquo;s doing keto  </p>
<p>not intermittent fasting and she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s developed 
a very fast rate cognitive skills sharp i mean her  </p>
<p>mood&rsquo;s up i mean it&rsquo;s just a normal child right 
i&rsquo;ve heard you talk about her yeah yeah so this  </p>
