    <p>Walter Grosnickle finally had some free time on Saturday, August 18th, 1984 to make the</p>
<p>hour-long drive from his house in North Manchester, Indiana, to Argus to check out some land that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d been interested in buying for his timber operations.</p>
<p>This was actually the second time he had driven there to have a look, but he wanted to double</p>
<p>check the trees on the plot before he moved forward with actually buying it.</p>
<p>Since Walter wasn&rsquo;t from Argus, he didn&rsquo;t realize that there was a massive manhunt going</p>
<p>on near his destination, nor was he aware that a mother of three had been abducted the</p>
<p>day before just a few miles away and was still missing.</p>
<p>You could call it happenstance or fate.</p>
<p>The Marshall County prosecutor calls it divine intervention.</p>
<p>But many believed Darlene would have never been found had it not been for Walter&rsquo;s timber</p>
<p>search in the woods that day, or his subsequent call to police.</p>
<p>This is Episode 3, The Wooded Path.</p>
<p>When police got Walter&rsquo;s call at around 2.30, the lead investigators were just wrapping</p>
<p>up a press conference in Plymouth at the Marshall County Police Department.</p>
<p>They announced to the reporters that they were looking for a blonde man driving a four-door,</p>
<p>blue-green car with rust along the bottom.</p>
<p>They asked reporters to tell their readers and listeners to call the Indiana State Police</p>
<p>or the Marshall County Police Department with any tips.</p>
<p>By this point, Marshall County and State Police were heading up the search together, with</p>
<p>officers from Argus PD assisting with manpower.</p>
<p>Just as the press was leaving, Sergeant Dave Yokelet with Marshall County came running</p>
<p>in to advise ISP troopers that a body had been found in the southern part of the county</p>
<p>off Olive Trail.</p>
<p>Several troopers and local officers headed straight to the scene, getting there at about</p>
<p>2.45.</p>
<p>When they parked and got out of their cars, they noticed a cut in the fence leading to</p>
<p>the woods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how Walter had actually gotten into the woods to begin with.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to hear is a reenactment of Sergeant Yokelet&rsquo;s interview with Walter</p>
<p>at the scene.</p>
<p>Gail, can you inform me, just explain to me what you found here today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the process of bargaining with Thompson Realty in Plymouth on this acres,</p>
<p>timber and all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a timberman from North Manchester, and I came here to check the woods again to go</p>
<p>over it.</p>
<p>And I stopped up at these people&rsquo;s house from Chicago and talked to them for about an hour</p>
<p>and backed up along the road, hunting for a place in the fence where I could get across.</p>
<p>And I came upon this place where the fence was partially cut, so I climbed over and I</p>
<p>just walked in a few feet, parted the brush, and just happened to look up and I seen this</p>
<p>form laying there.</p>
<p>And I just turned and I run to the road.</p>
<p>At that time, a farmer was coming down, probably a couple hundred feet away with his tractor,</p>
<p>and I flagged him down.</p>
<p>So we went to the neighbours and called the police.</p>
<p>Okay, Gail.</p>
<p>You was just checking the property just to buy lumber out of it?</p>
<p>To buy the whole thing, 20 acres.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Had you been down here before, checking on it?</p>
<p>Yeah, my wife was here last week one night.</p>
<p>So you, again, you was just driving down here, just trying to find a place to park, to cross,</p>
<p>and go look?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a place way at the north end.</p>
<p>I wanted to go back there in the swamp to see if there might be any springs.</p>
<p>So I had the idea of maybe putting a pond in there if I buy it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a swamp area.</p>
<p>Back here is it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>So you found this low spot and that&rsquo;s when you just got out and you was going to walk</p>
<p>across there?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back towards the back there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back towards the south end of the woods.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How far into the woods from the road did you get into before you noticed this body?</p>
<p>Oh, you was there.</p>
<p>Yeah, but how far?</p>
<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>Take me out of them branches down so I could see.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>How close to the body did you get?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>20 feet, maybe.</p>
<p>I just happened to look up and seen a form laying out there and I just turned and run</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>You knew what it was right away?</p>
<p>Well, I knew.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know it was a body?</p>
<p>Yeah, I knew it was a body.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know what.</p>
<p>Is there anything about that body?</p>
<p>Did you see any clothes on the body?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t pay no attention.</p>
<p>I just seen something there and I took off and run.</p>
<p>Then you drove back up the road and met the farmer?</p>
<p>Yeah, just a little ways right there and I met him.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you went with him and made the phone call?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you, Gail, notice any traffic or anything else up and down the road here?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve been driving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been driving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been driving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been driving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been driving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been driving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been driving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been driving.</p>
<p>Did you, Gail, notice any traffic or anything else up and down the road here?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve been up here about an hour talking to these people in this house right there,</p>
<p>you know, from Chicago and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;d been a car went by.</p>
<p>Okay, Gail, thank you.</p>
<p>The time is now 3.15 p.m.</p>
<p>Edges of the fence where the cuts had been made were rusty, which made police think that</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a fresh cut.</p>
<p>Once they crossed over the fence, there were drag marks that they followed back into the</p>
<p>woods, beyond a ditch and to a tree.</p>
<p>And there, about 75 feet from the road, was a woman&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>She was laying on her back with one arm down by her side and the other bent up over her</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>She had on one Nike tennis shoe, which looked like the mate to the shoe investigators had</p>
<p>found at Darlene&rsquo;s house the day before.</p>
<p>She was also still wearing a light green pullover sweater and a green skirt.</p>
<p>But both were sort of pushed up on her body.</p>
<p>Her shirt was also pushed down off one shoulder, and it was pushed up so high on her torso</p>
<p>that one of her breasts was almost exposed, but not quite.</p>
<p>Same with her skirt.</p>
<p>It was one of those skirts that if she was standing, it would have been down almost to</p>
<p>her knees.</p>
<p>But when she was found, it was pushed way up on her thighs, but not quite exposing her</p>
<p>underwear.</p>
<p>Her dark brown hair was matted with blood, and there were obvious open wounds on her</p>
<p>head and face, and additional cuts and bruises on her neck, arms, fingers, and legs.</p>
<p>When officers knelt down beside her to get a good look at her face, she stared back at</p>
<p>them, eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Even through the maggots, there was absolutely no doubt that it was Darlene.</p>
<p>While Sgt.</p>
<p>Yochelet took Walter back to the station to get his boot print for possible elimination</p>
<p>purposes, other authorities radioed for a coroner and crime scene technicians to respond</p>
<p>to the scene to take some photos and search the woods for any other clues.</p>
<p>It was notable to them that whoever killed Darlene didn&rsquo;t attempt to cover her body</p>
<p>with brush or leaves or anything.</p>
<p>This scene was in pretty dense woods, so if the person had wanted to conceal her body,</p>
<p>they could have done it pretty easily.</p>
<p>I mean, there were leaves all over the ground.</p>
<p>But her killer did position her body behind a tree.</p>
<p>So while she wasn&rsquo;t too far from Olive Trail, if you were standing on the road looking</p>
<p>in, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to see her.</p>
<p>Gary Dunlap, a deputy coroner for Marshall County, arrived and was briefed before he</p>
<p>took photos of her body and the woods, and then he worked with ISP&rsquo;s crime scene techs</p>
<p>to process the scene.</p>
<p>They searched and searched for the missing fireplace poker rod, hoping to find it near</p>
<p>Darlene&rsquo;s body, but no such luck.</p>
<p>In fact, they didn&rsquo;t find any other evidence in the woods.</p>
<p>As they prepared to take Darlene&rsquo;s body to the morgue in Plymouth, other officers were</p>
<p>sent to break the horrible news to Ron and his family, who were still at the grandparents'</p>
<p>house, hoping and praying and believing that Darlene would be found safe.</p>
<p>An eight-year-old Marie really did believe that her mom would come back.</p>
<p>Mostly because she had seen the man who attacked her mom, and she was like, well, he was a</p>
<p>stranger, and why would a stranger want to hurt my mom?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that kind of kid logic that I sometimes wish adults could apply to situations more</p>
<p>often.</p>
<p>But in her mind, it made no sense that this perfect stranger would have any reason to</p>
<p>take her mom away.</p>
<p>So when the cops came to tell the Holst family that Darlene had been found dead, it was hard</p>
<p>for the girls to even understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it was so confusing and scary.</p>
<p>Do you remember anyone having those conversations with you?</p>
<p>The only person that did was my maternal grandmother, called her Grandma Jolly.</p>
<p>And she was the one who got it and made me understand that she may not be coming back,</p>
<p>because that was her daughter.</p>
<p>And she just would cry a lot.</p>
<p>And I remember her saying, I&rsquo;m going to get you some counseling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get you some counseling.</p>
<p>And I thought, why would I go to counseling?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But everyone else was very hesitant to say.</p>
<p>There were no words, really, just hugging.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember someone really sitting me down and saying, okay, this is what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do now.</p>
<p>They were just hugging and crying, a lot of crying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I remember.</p>
<p>When Marie finally did understand the gravity of the situation, that her mom wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be coming home, the overwhelming feeling she had, even at eight, was guilt.</p>
<p>I felt so bad because I kept on replaying it over in my mind and thinking what I could</p>
<p>have done differently.</p>
<p>And I knew my dad had a gun in the back of his closet.</p>
<p>And I just kept thinking to myself, I should have run the other way.</p>
<p>I felt so guilty that I didn&rsquo;t do something to stop him.</p>
<p>In my eight-year-old, I mean, now I&rsquo;m realizing that I could not have done that.</p>
<p>But in my eight-year-old self, I thought I should have just gone and got that gun.</p>
<p>But I was thinking, I was panicking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even like thinking about what might have happened had the girls stayed and tried</p>
<p>to defend their mom.</p>
<p>As a mother myself now, I believe the one ounce of peace that Darlene got in her death</p>
<p>was that she protected her children.</p>
<p>All she cared about in that moment was her girls.</p>
<p>It was the only thing she said, don&rsquo;t hurt my babies.</p>
<p>She told her girls to run.</p>
<p>She kept them safe.</p>
<p>Marie and Melissa gave their mother a gift by listening to her one final time.</p>
<p>As the Holses came to terms with Darlene&rsquo;s death, family members rallied around Ron to</p>
<p>help care for the girls.</p>
<p>And Marie and Melissa teamed up to help take care of their baby sister.</p>
<p>A welcome distraction, maybe.</p>
<p>But they were also just so relieved that she was okay.</p>
<p>Kristen, I don&rsquo;t remember Kristen, like, wanting anybody else but Melissa and I.</p>
<p>I mean, she was just with us all the time after that.</p>
<p>I mean, we fed her.</p>
<p>We bathed her.</p>
<p>We changed her.</p>
<p>We did everything for her.</p>
<p>Family members also stepped in to help Ron make funeral arrangements for Darlene.</p>
<p>And all of this was happening as police prepared for a massive manhunt.</p>
<p>And they shifted to a homicide investigation.</p>
<p>A crazed killer was on the loose.</p>
<p>And two days after Darlene&rsquo;s abduction, on August 19th, police were no closer to finding him.</p>
<p>But that morning was Darlene&rsquo;s autopsy.</p>
<p>And investigators were hoping the information they were going to get from that would help them understand the why behind it all.</p>
<p>It was becoming more and more difficult for them to reassure the community about their own safety</p>
<p>when they didn&rsquo;t even know why Darlene&rsquo;s killer showed up to her house in the first place.</p>
<p>Even though the scene didn&rsquo;t really support robbery as a motive,</p>
<p>police kept leaning that way until something else told them otherwise.</p>
<p>The autopsy was performed Sunday morning at Memorial Hospital in South Bend by Dr. Rick Hoover,</p>
<p>which is a name that you might recognize if you also listened to Counter Clock Season 3.</p>
<p>Also present at the autopsy were a few ISP troopers, Marshall County officers, and the prosecutor at the time, Fred Jones.</p>
<p>One of the first things Dr. Hoover noted in the autopsy report was Darlene&rsquo;s clothing</p>
<p>and the areas where blood was concentrated on her skirt, shirt, and underwear.</p>
<p>A few small hairs and fibers were found on her clothes, so they bagged those along with her clothes,</p>
<p>and fingernail clippings, all as evidence.</p>
<p>Even though she was only missing and likely in the woods for about 30 hours, rigor mortis had started to set in,</p>
<p>and lividity showed that she had likely been lying on her back in the woods since the time she died.</p>
<p>Darlene&rsquo;s left hand was injured, which looked like defensive wounds,</p>
<p>and there were seven lacerations on her head that Dr. Hoover said were caused by a, quote,</p>
<p>long, narrow type of instrument, a.k.a. the fireplace poker.</p>
<p>Dr. Hoover noted in his report that Darlene&rsquo;s skull wasn&rsquo;t fractured,</p>
<p>and her brain didn&rsquo;t show any evidence of additional trauma or hemorrhage.</p>
<p>He also noted some injuries to her legs, arms, and neck,</p>
<p>but some of those injuries Dr. Hoover thought Darlene probably received after she was already dead.</p>
<p>Hoover concluded that her cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head,</p>
<p>and he determined that her manner of death was homicide.</p>
<p>Dr. Hoover&rsquo;s findings also stated that Darlene was not sexually assaulted,</p>
<p>which is surprising considering everything we know so far, right?</p>
<p>Considering her skirt and shirt were pushed way up when she was found.</p>
<p>Considering that nothing was taken from the home, and this man seemingly came with duct tape for her.</p>
<p>Hoover&rsquo;s reports say they did a sexual assault kit,</p>
<p>but there isn&rsquo;t any information in the report about what type of testing they did.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve come to learn is that in 1984, it could have been one of several different tests,</p>
<p>some of which were super detailed and others were kind of superficial.</p>
<p>But Dr. Hoover seemed certain that she wasn&rsquo;t sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>He also said that Darlene likely died sometime between 8.30 a.m. and noon on Friday, August 17.</p>
<p>But we know that it was probably after 9 since Ron&rsquo;s dad had been there dropping off bananas just before 9.</p>
<p>As these findings made their way back to the Argus community,</p>
<p>the story of Darlene&rsquo;s murder was all over the news,</p>
<p>from the small local newspapers to radio broadcasts and even the TV stations in South Bend,</p>
<p>which meant that calls were pouring in.</p>
<p>Most of them were various sightings of green four-door cars,</p>
<p>which sort of became a wild goose chase for police.</p>
<p>But there was one very interesting tip that seemed super relevant.</p>
<p>An Argus man named Alex Long called police and said that he had seen the news about Darlene Hulse,</p>
<p>and in hindsight, he realized that he had been driving by her home right around 9.30 a.m. on the day that she was abducted.</p>
<p>Alex lived one road over from the Hulses,</p>
<p>and he was headed to Plymouth that morning when he passed their home.</p>
<p>He said that he saw a four-door, blue-green, early 70s Bonneville-type car</p>
<p>with round headlights parked outside their house,</p>
<p>but not in the driveway where Marie and Melissa would see it just moments later</p>
<p>when they would eventually go running from the home.</p>
<p>He said that the car was parked out front, like on the road.</p>
<p>He said what he noticed about the car was that it was in bad shape with rust on it,</p>
<p>and he saw a man sitting in the driver&rsquo;s seat who had a big, pointy nose,</p>
<p>blonde, slicked-back hair, and he was wearing a collared shirt.</p>
<p>He said the man looked to be in his 20s.</p>
<p>Now, the other interesting thing that Alex noted was that the car seemed to have had a homemade paint job,</p>
<p>which is very consistent with the chalky, bad paint job that Marie described.</p>
<p>This was the same car.</p>
<p>This guy had been parked out front.</p>
<p>Was he watching her through the open curtains in the window?</p>
<p>Was he working up the courage to do whatever it was he had planned?</p>
<p>Police still didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Investigators met that night to debrief on everything that they learned from the autopsy</p>
<p>and the other details that Alex had provided about their suspect and his car.</p>
<p>But at around 10.30 p.m.,</p>
<p>just as the police were wrapping up a game plan to ramp up their manhunt the following day,</p>
<p>another call came in.</p>
<p>The call was from a man who said that his friend might have had something to do with Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s next in Episode 4, They Left Town.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
<p>You</p>
