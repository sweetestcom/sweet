    <p>The following is a conversation with Richard Crabe,</p>
<p>founder of Numeri, which is a crowdsourced hedge fund,</p>
<p>very much in the spirit of Wall Street Bets,</p>
<p>but where the trading is done not directly by humans,</p>
<p>but by artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>submitted by those humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating and extremely difficult</p>
<p>machine learning competition</p>
<p>where the incentives of everybody is aligned,</p>
<p>the code is kept and owned by the people who develop it,</p>
<p>the data, anonymized data is very well organized</p>
<p>and made freely available.</p>
<p>I think this kind of idea has a chance to change</p>
<p>the nature of stock trading</p>
<p>and even just money management in general</p>
<p>by empowering people who are interested in trading stocks</p>
<p>with the modern and quickly advancing tools</p>
<p>of machine learning.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that this whole set of events</p>
<p>around GameStop and Wall Street Bets</p>
<p>has been really inspiring to me as a demonstration</p>
<p>that a distributed system,</p>
<p>a large number of regular people</p>
<p>are able to coordinate and collaborate</p>
<p>in taking on the elite centralized power structures,</p>
<p>especially when those elites are misbehaving.</p>
<p>I believe that power in as many cases as possible</p>
<p>should be distributed.</p>
<p>And in this case, the internet, as it is for many cases,</p>
<p>is the fundamental enabler of that power.</p>
<p>And at the core, what the internet</p>
<p>in its distributed nature represents is freedom.</p>
<p>Of course, the thing about freedom</p>
<p>is it enables chaos or progress, or sometimes both.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the point of the thing.</p>
<p>Freedom is empowering, but ultimately unpredictable.</p>
<p>And I think in the end, freedom wins.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Richard Crabe.</p>
<p>From your perspective, can you summarize</p>
<p>the important events around this amazing saga</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been living through of Wall Street Bets,</p>
<p>the subreddit and GameStop, and in general,</p>
<p>just what are your thoughts about it</p>
<p>from a technical to the philosophical level?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my favorite story ever.</p>
<p>Like when I was reading about it,</p>
<p>I was like, this is the best.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also connected with my company,</p>
<p>which we can talk about.</p>
<p>But what I liked about it is like,</p>
<p>I like decentralized coordination</p>
<p>and looking at the mechanisms</p>
<p>that these are Wall Street Bets users use</p>
<p>to hype each other up, to get excited,</p>
<p>to prove that they bought the stock and they&rsquo;re holding.</p>
<p>And then also to see that how big of an impact</p>
<p>that that decentralized coordination had.</p>
<p>So it really was a big deal.</p>
<p>Were you impressed by the distributed coordination,</p>
<p>the collaboration amongst like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the numbers are.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m numerized looking at the data.</p>
<p>After all of this is over and done,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be interesting to see like</p>
<p>from a large scale distributed system perspective</p>
<p>to see how everything played out.</p>
<p>But just from your current perspective, what we know,</p>
<p>is it obvious to you that such incredible level</p>
<p>of coordination could happen</p>
<p>where a lot of people come together in a distributed sense,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an emergent behavior that happens after that.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not at all obvious.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons is the lack of credibility.</p>
<p>To coordinate with someone,</p>
<p>you need to make credible contracts or credible claims.</p>
<p>So if you have a username on our Wall Street Bets,</p>
<p>like some of them are, like deep fucking value</p>
<p>is one of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an actual username.</p>
<p>By the way, we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a website called Reddit</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s subreddits on it.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, mostly anonymous,</p>
<p>I think for the most part anonymous,</p>
<p>can create user accounts</p>
<p>and then can then just talk on forum like style boards.</p>
<p>You should know what Reddit is.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what Reddit is, check it out.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what Reddit is,</p>
<p>maybe go to the awesome subreddit first,</p>
<p>aww with cute pictures of cats and dogs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my recommendation.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, that would be a good start to Reddit.</p>
<p>When you get into it more, go to our Wall Street Bets.</p>
<p>It gets dark quickly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll probably talk about that too.</p>
<p>So yeah, so there&rsquo;s these users</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no contracts, like you were saying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no contracts, the users are anonymous,</p>
<p>but there are little things that do help.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve posted a really good investment idea in the past,</p>
<p>that exists on Reddit as well.</p>
<p>And it might have lots of upvotes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also kind of like giving credibility</p>
<p>to your next thing.</p>
<p>And then they are also putting up screenshots,</p>
<p>like here&rsquo;s the trades I&rsquo;ve made and here&rsquo;s a screenshot.</p>
<p>Now you could fake the screenshot,</p>
<p>but still it seems like if you&rsquo;ve got a lot of karma</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve had a good performance on the community,</p>
<p>it somehow becomes credible enough</p>
<p>for other people to be like, you know what?</p>
<p>He actually probably did put a million dollars into this.</p>
<p>And you know what, I can follow that trade easily.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of people like that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of integrating all that information</p>
<p>together yourself to see like, huh,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something happening here.</p>
<p>And then you jump onto this little boat of like behavior,</p>
<p>like we should buy the stock or sell the stock.</p>
<p>And then another person jumps on,</p>
<p>another person jumps on.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you have just a huge number of people</p>
<p>behaving in the same direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like flock of whatever birds.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What was strange with this one,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just let&rsquo;s all buy Tesla.</p>
<p>We love Elon, we love Tesla, let&rsquo;s all buy Tesla.</p>
<p>Because that we&rsquo;ve heard before, right?</p>
<p>Everybody likes Tesla.</p>
<p>Well, now they do.</p>
<p>So what they did with this in this case,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re buying a stock that was bad.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re buying it because it was bad.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really weird because that&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>too galaxy brain for a decentralized community.</p>
<p>How did they come up with it?</p>
<p>How did they know that was the right one?</p>
<p>And the reason they liked it</p>
<p>is because it had really, really high short interest.</p>
<p>It had been shorted more than its own float, I believe.</p>
<p>And so they figured out that if they all bought</p>
<p>this bad stock, they could short squeeze some hedge funds.</p>
<p>And those hedge funds would have to capitulate</p>
<p>and buy the stock at really, really high prices.</p>
<p>And we should say that shorted means that</p>
<p>these are a bunch of people, when you short a stock,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re betting on the, you&rsquo;re predicting</p>
<p>that the stock&rsquo;s going to go down</p>
<p>and then you will make money if it does.</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s a short squeeze?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that if you are a hedge fund</p>
<p>and you take a big short position in a company,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain level at which</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t sustain holding that position.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no limit to how high a stock can go,</p>
<p>but there is a limit to how low it can go, right?</p>
<p>So if you short something, you have infinite loss potential.</p>
<p>And if the stock doubles overnight, like GameStop did,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting a lot of stress on that hedge fund.</p>
<p>And that hedge fund manager might have to say,</p>
<p>you know what, I have to get out of the trade.</p>
<p>And the only way to get out is to buy the bad stock</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t want, like they believe will go down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting situation,</p>
<p>particularly because it&rsquo;s not zero sum.</p>
<p>If you say, let&rsquo;s all get together</p>
<p>and make a bubble in watermelons,</p>
<p>you buy a bunch of watermelons,</p>
<p>the price goes up, it comes down again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a zero sum game.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s already shorted a stock</p>
<p>and you can make them short squeeze,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a positive sum game.</p>
<p>So yes, some Redditors will make a lot of money,</p>
<p>some will lose a lot,</p>
<p>but actually the whole group will make money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really why it was such a clever thing</p>
<p>for them to do.</p>
<p>And coupled to the fact that shorting,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you can push back,</p>
<p>but to me always from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>seemed, I hope I&rsquo;m not using too strong of a word,</p>
<p>but it seemed almost unethical.</p>
<p>Maybe not unethical, maybe it&rsquo;s just a asshole thing to do.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m speaking not from an economics</p>
<p>or financial perspective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking from just somebody who loves,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of a lot of people,</p>
<p>I love celebrating the success of a lot of people.</p>
<p>And this is like the stock market equivalent of like haters.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s not what it is.</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s efficient,</p>
<p>you wanna have an economy efficient mechanism</p>
<p>for punishing sort of overhyped, overvalued things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what shorthand guess is designed for.</p>
<p>But it just always felt like these people are just,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not just betting on the loss of the company.</p>
<p>It feels like they&rsquo;re also using their leverage and power</p>
<p>to manipulate media or just to write articles</p>
<p>or just to hate on you on social media.</p>
<p>Then you get to see that with Elon Musk and so on.</p>
<p>So this is like the man,</p>
<p>so people like hedge funds that were shorting</p>
<p>are like the sort of embodiment of the evil</p>
<p>or just the bad guy, the overpowerful</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s misusing their power.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the crowd,</p>
<p>the people that are standing up and rising up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that they were able to collaborate</p>
<p>on Wall Street bets to sort of effectively</p>
<p>make money for themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also that this is like a symbol</p>
<p>of the people getting together</p>
<p>and fighting the centralized elites, the powerful.</p>
<p>And that, I don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts are</p>
<p>about that in general.</p>
<p>At this stage, it feels like that&rsquo;s really exciting</p>
<p>that people have power,</p>
<p>just like regular people have power.</p>
<p>At the same time, it&rsquo;s scary a little bit</p>
<p>because just studying history,</p>
<p>people could be manipulated by charismatic leaders.</p>
<p>And so just like Elon right now is manipulating,</p>
<p>encouraging people to buy Dogecoin or whatever,</p>
<p>there can be good charismatic leaders</p>
<p>and there can be bad charismatic leaders.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s nerve wracking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit scary how much power</p>
<p>a subreddit can have to destroy somebody</p>
<p>because right now we&rsquo;re celebrating</p>
<p>they might be attacking or destroying somebody</p>
<p>that everybody doesn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>but what if they attack somebody</p>
<p>that is actually good for this world?</p>
<p>So that, and that&rsquo;s kind of the awesomeness</p>
<p>and the price of freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it could destroy the world</p>
<p>or it can save the world.</p>
<p>But at this stage, it feels like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>overall, when you sit back,</p>
<p>do you think this was just a positive wave</p>
<p>of emergent behavior?</p>
<p>Is there something negative about what happened?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, the cool thing is they weren&rsquo;t doing anything,</p>
<p>the Reddit people weren&rsquo;t doing anything exotic.</p>
<p>It was a creative trade, but it wasn&rsquo;t exotic.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, it was just buying the stock.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe they bought some options too,</p>
<p>but it was the hedge fund that was doing the exotic thing.</p>
<p>So I liked that.</p>
<p>It was, it&rsquo;s hard to say, well, we&rsquo;ve got together</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve pulled all our money together</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s a company out there that&rsquo;s worth more.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with that?</p>
<p>Yeah. Right?</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t talk about the motivations, which is,</p>
<p>and then we destroyed some hedge funds in the process.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about the humor</p>
<p>and the, I don&rsquo;t know, the edginess,</p>
<p>sometimes viciousness of that subreddit?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked at it too much,</p>
<p>but it feels like people can be quite aggressive on there.</p>
<p>So is there, what is that?</p>
<p>Is that what Freedom looks like?</p>
<p>I think it does, yeah.</p>
<p>You definitely need to let people,</p>
<p>one of the things that people have compared it to</p>
<p>is the Occupy Wall Street, which is, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>some very sincere liberals, like 23 years old, whatever,</p>
<p>and they go out with signs</p>
<p>and they have some kind of case to make.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t sincere, really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little bit more nihilistic,</p>
<p>a little bit more YOLO, and therefore a little bit</p>
<p>more scary because who&rsquo;s scared of the Occupy Wall Street</p>
<p>people with the signs?</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>But these hedge funds really are scared.</p>
<p>I was scared of the Wall Street bats people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still scared of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, the anonymity is a bit terrifying and exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following events in Russia, for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a struggle between centralized power</p>
<p>and the distributed.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the struggle of the history</p>
<p>of human civilization, right?</p>
<p>But this on the internet, just that you can multiply people.</p>
<p>Like some of them don&rsquo;t have to be real.</p>
<p>Like you can probably create bots.</p>
<p>Like it starts getting me, me as a programmer,</p>
<p>I start to think like, hmm, me as one person,</p>
<p>how much chaos can I create by writing some bots?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one thinking that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s hundreds, thousands</p>
<p>of good developers out there listening to this,</p>
<p>thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>And then as that develops further and further</p>
<p>in the next like decade or two,</p>
<p>what impact does that have on financial markets,</p>
<p>on just destruction of reputations of just,</p>
<p>or politics, the bickering of left and right</p>
<p>political discourse, the dynamics of that</p>
<p>being manipulated by, you know,</p>
<p>people talk about like Russian bots or whatever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably in a very early stage of that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And this is a good example.</p>
<p>So do you have a sense that most of WallStreetBets folks</p>
<p>are actually individual people, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the feeling I have is they&rsquo;re just individual,</p>
<p>maybe young investors, just doing a little bit</p>
<p>of an investment, but just on a large scale.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>The reason I found out, I&rsquo;ve known about WallStreetBets</p>
<p>for a while, but the reason I found out about GameStop</p>
<p>was this, just I met somebody at a party</p>
<p>who told me about it and he was like 21 years old</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s gonna go up 100% in the next one day.</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re talking about in last year?</p>
<p>This was probably, no, this was, yeah, a few days ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was like maybe two weeks ago or something.</p>
<p>So it was already high GameStop,</p>
<p>but it was just strange to me that there was someone</p>
<p>telling me at a party how to trade stocks</p>
<p>who was like 21 years old.</p>
<p>And I started to, yeah, I started to look into it.</p>
<p>And yeah, and he did make, he made it, yeah,</p>
<p>he made 140% in one day, he was right.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s supercharged, he&rsquo;s a little bit wealthier</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s gonna wait for the next thing.</p>
<p>And this decentralized entity</p>
<p>is just gonna get bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna together search for the next thing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s thousands of folks like him</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to probably search</p>
<p>for the next thing to attack.</p>
<p>People that have power in this world that sit there</p>
<p>with power right now in government and in finance</p>
<p>and any kind of position</p>
<p>are probably a little bit scared right now.</p>
<p>And honestly, that&rsquo;s probably a little bit good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dangerous, but it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Yeah, it certainly makes you think twice about shorting.</p>
<p>It certainly makes you think twice</p>
<p>about putting a lot of money into a short.</p>
<p>Like these funds put a lot into one or two names.</p>
<p>And so it was very, very badly risk managed.</p>
<p>Do you think shorting is, can you speak at a high level</p>
<p>just for your own as a person, is it good for the world?</p>
<p>Is it good for markets?</p>
<p>I do think that the two kinds of shorting,</p>
<p>evil shorting and chill shorting.</p>
<p>Evil shorting is what Melvin Capital was doing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you put a huge position down,</p>
<p>you get all your buddies to also short it</p>
<p>and you start making press</p>
<p>and trying to bring this company down.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think in some cases,</p>
<p>you go out after like fraudulent companies say,</p>
<p>this company is a fraud.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Like some, but they weren&rsquo;t even saying,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just saying it&rsquo;s a bad company</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to bring it to the ground,</p>
<p>bring it to its knees.</p>
<p>So a quant fund like Numerai,</p>
<p>we always have lots of positions</p>
<p>and we never have a position</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like more than 1% of our fund.</p>
<p>So we actually have right now, 250 shorts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any of them except for one</p>
<p>because it was one of the meme stocks.</p>
<p>But we shorting them not to make them go,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even want them to go down necessarily.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound a bit strange that I say that,</p>
<p>but we just want them to not go up as much as our longs.</p>
<p>So by shorting a little bit,</p>
<p>we can actually go long more</p>
<p>in the things we do believe in.</p>
<p>So when we were going long in Tesla,</p>
<p>we could do it with more money than we had</p>
<p>because we would borrow from banks</p>
<p>who would lend us money to go down.</p>
<p>Who would lend us money because we had longs and shorts,</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t have market exposure,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have market risk.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>because that means we can short the oil companies</p>
<p>and go long Tesla and make the future come forward faster.</p>
<p>And I do think that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about this incredible distributed system</p>
<p>created by Wall Street Bets.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a platform which is Robinhood,</p>
<p>which allows investors to efficiently as far,</p>
<p>you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s those and there&rsquo;s others in this new MRI</p>
<p>that allow you to make it accessible for people to invest.</p>
<p>But that said, Robinhood was in a centralized way</p>
<p>applied its power to restrict trading</p>
<p>on the stocks that we&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>Do you have a thoughts on actually</p>
<p>like the things that happened?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much you were paying attention</p>
<p>to sort of the shadiness around the whole thing.</p>
<p>Do you think it was forced to do it?</p>
<p>Or was there something shady going on?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts in general?</p>
<p>Well, I think I wanna see the alternate history.</p>
<p>Like I wanna see the counterfactual history</p>
<p>of them not doing that.</p>
<p>How bad would it have gotten for hedge funds?</p>
<p>How much more damage could have been done</p>
<p>if the momentum of these short squeezes could continue?</p>
<p>What happens when there are short squeezes,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re in a few stocks,</p>
<p>they affect kind of all the other shorts too.</p>
<p>And suddenly brokers are saying things like,</p>
<p>you need to put up more collateral.</p>
<p>So we had a short, it wasn&rsquo;t GameStop luckily,</p>
<p>it was Blackberry and it went up like 100% in a day.</p>
<p>It was one of these meme stocks, super bad company.</p>
<p>The AIs don&rsquo;t like it, okay?</p>
<p>The AIs think it&rsquo;s going down.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a meme stock?</p>
<p>A meme stock is kind of a new term for these stocks</p>
<p>that catch memetic momentum on Reddit.</p>
<p>And so the meme stocks were GameStop, the biggest one,</p>
<p>GameStonk, as Elon calls it, AMC.</p>
<p>And Blackberry was one, Nokia was one.</p>
<p>So these are high short interest stocks as well.</p>
<p>So these are targeted stocks.</p>
<p>Some people say, oh, isn&rsquo;t it adorable</p>
<p>that these people are investing money</p>
<p>in these companies that are nostalgic?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you go into the AMC movie theater,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like nostalgic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, it&rsquo;s not why they&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that they had a lot of short interest.</p>
<p>That was the main thing.</p>
<p>And so there were high chance of short squeeze.</p>
<p>In saying, I would love to see an alternate history,</p>
<p>do you have a sense that that,</p>
<p>what is your prediction of what that history would look like?</p>
<p>Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t have needed very many more days</p>
<p>of that kind of chaos to hurt hedge funds.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s underrated how damaging it could have been.</p>
<p>Because when your shorts go up,</p>
<p>your collateral requirements for them go up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to Robinhood.</p>
<p>Like we have a prime broker that says, said to us,</p>
<p>you need to put up like $40 per $100 of short exposure.</p>
<p>And then the next day they said,</p>
<p>actually you have to put up all of it, 100%.</p>
<p>And we were like, what?</p>
<p>But if that happens to all the short,</p>
<p>all the commonly held hedge fund shorts,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all kind of holding the same things.</p>
<p>If that happens, not only do you have to cover the short,</p>
<p>which means you&rsquo;re buying the bad companies,</p>
<p>you need to sell your good companies</p>
<p>in order to cover the short.</p>
<p>So suddenly like all the good companies,</p>
<p>all the ones that the hedge funds like are coming down</p>
<p>and all the ones that the hedge funds hate are going up</p>
<p>in a cascading way.</p>
<p>So I believe that if you could have had a few more days</p>
<p>of GameStop doubling, AMC doubling,</p>
<p>you would have had more and more hedge fund deleveraging.</p>
<p>But so hedge funds, I mean, they get a lot of shit,</p>
<p>but they, do you have a sense</p>
<p>that they do some good for the world?</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately, so, okay.</p>
<p>First of all, Wall Street bets itself</p>
<p>is a kind of distributed hedge fund.</p>
<p>Numeri is a kind of hedge fund.</p>
<p>So I got, hedge fund is a very broad category.</p>
<p>I mean, like if some of those were destroyed,</p>
<p>would that be good for the world?</p>
<p>Or would there be coupled</p>
<p>with the destroying the evil shorting,</p>
<p>would there be just a lot of pain</p>
<p>in terms of investment in good companies?</p>
<p>Yeah, a thing I like to tell people</p>
<p>if they hate hedge funds is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you want to rerun American economic history</p>
<p>without hedge funds.</p>
<p>So on mass they&rsquo;re, yeah, they&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Yeah, you really wouldn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Because hedge funds are kind of like picking up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making liquidity, right, in stocks.</p>
<p>And so if you love venture capitalists,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re investing in new technology, it&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>You have to also kind of like hedge funds</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the reason venture capitalists exist</p>
<p>because their companies can have a liquidity event</p>
<p>when they go to the public markets.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of essential that we have them.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of them.</p>
<p>I believe we could maybe get away</p>
<p>with only having an AI hedge fund.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t necessarily need</p>
<p>these evil billions type hedge funds</p>
<p>that make the media and try to kill companies.</p>
<p>But we definitely need hedge funds.</p>
<p>Maybe from your perspective,</p>
<p>because you run such an organization</p>
<p>and Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood,</p>
<p>sort of had to make decisions really quickly,</p>
<p>probably had to wake up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night kind of thing.</p>
<p>And he also had a conversation with Elon Musk on Clubhouse,</p>
<p>which I just signed up for.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating,</p>
<p>one of the great journalistic performances of our time</p>
<p>with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Pull a surprise for Elon.</p>
<p>How hilarious would it be if he gets a pull a surprise?</p>
<p>And then his Wikipedia would be like journalist</p>
<p>and part time entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Business magnate.</p>
<p>As you know, I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment</p>
<p>on any aspects of that,</p>
<p>but like, if you were Vlad,</p>
<p>how would you do things differently?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about his interaction with Elon?</p>
<p>How he should have played it differently?</p>
<p>Like, I guess there&rsquo;s a lot of aspects to this interaction.</p>
<p>One is about transparency.</p>
<p>Like how much do you want to tell people</p>
<p>about really what went down?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s NDAs potentially involved.</p>
<p>How much in private do you want to push back</p>
<p>and say, no, fuck you, to centralize power?</p>
<p>Whatever the phone calls you&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m sure he was getting some kind of phone calls</p>
<p>that might not be contractual.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not contracts that are forcing him,</p>
<p>but he was being, what do you call it?</p>
<p>Like pressured to behave in certain kinds of ways</p>
<p>from all kinds of directions.</p>
<p>Like what do you take from this whole situation?</p>
<p>I was very excited to see Vlad&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty cool to have him talk to Elon.</p>
<p>And one of the things that like struck me</p>
<p>in the first like few seconds of Vlad speaking was like,</p>
<p>I was like, is Vlad like a boomer?</p>
<p>Like, but hear me out.</p>
<p>Like he seemed like a 55 year old man</p>
<p>talking to a 20 year old.</p>
<p>Elon was like the 20 year old.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like the 55 year old man.</p>
<p>You can see why Citadel are NMR buddies, right?</p>
<p>Like you can, you can see why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is a nice, it&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s got a respectable professional attitude.</p>
<p>Well, he also tried to do like a jokey thing.</p>
<p>Like, no, we&rsquo;re not being ageist here.</p>
<p>Boomer, but like a 60 year old CEO of Bank of America</p>
<p>would try to make a joke for the kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Vlad&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was like, what is this?</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s like, what is he, 30?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, this is weird.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I think, and maybe that&rsquo;s also what I like</p>
<p>about Elon&rsquo;s kind of influence on American business</p>
<p>is like, he&rsquo;s super like anti the professional.</p>
<p>Like why say, you know, a hundred words about nothing?</p>
<p>And so I liked how he was cutting in and saying,</p>
<p>Vlad, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Spill the beans, bro.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you don&rsquo;t have to be courteous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the first principles thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what the hell happened?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just talk like normal people.</p>
<p>The problem of course is, you know, for Elon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cost them, what is it?</p>
<p>Tens of millions of dollars is tweeting like that.</p>
<p>But perhaps it&rsquo;s a worthy price to pay</p>
<p>because ultimately there&rsquo;s something magical</p>
<p>about just being real and honest</p>
<p>and just going off the cuff and making the mistakes</p>
<p>and paying for them, but just being real.</p>
<p>And then moments like this,</p>
<p>that was an opportunity for Vlad to be that.</p>
<p>And it felt like he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever find out what really went down</p>
<p>if there was something shady underneath it all?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it would be sad if nothing shady happened,</p>
<p>but his presence made it shady.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like that would mark Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>the CEO of Facebook.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like, yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of shitty things that Facebook is doing,</p>
<p>but sometimes I think he makes it look worse</p>
<p>by the way he presents himself about those things.</p>
<p>Like I honestly think that a large amount of people</p>
<p>at Facebook just have a huge unstable chaotic system</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all, not all, but mass are trying to do good</p>
<p>with this chaotic system.</p>
<p>But the presentation is like,</p>
<p>it sounds like there&rsquo;s a lot of back room conversations</p>
<p>that are trying to manipulate people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about the realness that Elon has</p>
<p>that it feels like CEO should have</p>
<p>and Vlad had that opportunity.</p>
<p>I think Mark Zuckerberg had that too when he was younger.</p>
<p>Younger.</p>
<p>And somebody said, you gotta be more professional, man.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say, you know, lol to an interview.</p>
<p>And then suddenly he became like this distant person</p>
<p>that was hot.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;d rather have him make mistakes,</p>
<p>but be honest than be like professional</p>
<p>and never make mistakes.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the difficult hires I think</p>
<p>is like marketing people or like PR people</p>
<p>is you have to hire people that get the fact</p>
<p>that you can say lol on an interview.</p>
<p>Or, you know, take risks as opposed to what the PR,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to quite a few big CEOs</p>
<p>and the people around them are trying to constantly</p>
<p>minimize risk of like, what if he says the wrong thing?</p>
<p>What if she says the wrong thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what, be careful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constantly like, ooh, like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this nervous energy that builds up over time</p>
<p>with larger and larger teams where the whole thing,</p>
<p>like I visited YouTube, for example.</p>
<p>Everybody I talked at YouTube, incredible engineering</p>
<p>and incredible system, but everybody&rsquo;s scared.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s be honest about this like madness</p>
<p>that we have going on of huge amounts of video</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t possibly ever handle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of hate on YouTube.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this chaos of comments,</p>
<p>bunch of conspiracy theories, some of which might be true.</p>
<p>And then just like this mess that we&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s exciting, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place where like democratizes education,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And instead they&rsquo;re all like sitting in like,</p>
<p>trying to be very polite and saying like,</p>
<p>well, we just want to improve the health of our platforms.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like this discussion like,</p>
<p>all right, man, let&rsquo;s just be real.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s both advertise how amazing this fricking thing is,</p>
<p>but also to say like, we don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We have all these Nazis posting videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how to like handle it.</p>
<p>And just being real like that,</p>
<p>because I suppose that&rsquo;s just a skill.</p>
<p>Maybe it can&rsquo;t be taught, but over time,</p>
<p>the whatever the dynamics of the company is,</p>
<p>it does seem like Zuckerberg and others get worn down.</p>
<p>They just get tired.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They get tired of.</p>
<p>Not being real.</p>
<p>Of not being real, which is sad.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about Numerai,</p>
<p>which is an incredible company system idea, I think,</p>
<p>but good place to start.</p>
<p>What is Numerai and how does it work?</p>
<p>So Numerai is the first hedge fund</p>
<p>that gives away all of its data.</p>
<p>So this is like probably the last thing</p>
<p>a hedge fund would do, right?</p>
<p>Why would we give away a data?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like giving away your edge.</p>
<p>But the reason we do it is because we&rsquo;re looking for people</p>
<p>to model our data.</p>
<p>And the way we do it is by obfuscating the data.</p>
<p>So when you look at Numerai&rsquo;s data</p>
<p>that you can download for free,</p>
<p>it just looks like a million rows</p>
<p>of numbers between zero and one.</p>
<p>And you have no idea what the columns mean,</p>
<p>but you do know that if you&rsquo;re good at machine learning</p>
<p>or have done regressions before,</p>
<p>you know that I can still find patterns in this data,</p>
<p>even though I don&rsquo;t know what the features mean.</p>
<p>And the data itself is a time series data.</p>
<p>And even though it&rsquo;s obfuscated, anonymized,</p>
<p>what is the source data like approximately?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>So we are buying data from lots of different data vendors</p>
<p>and they would also never want us to share that data.</p>
<p>So we have strict contracts with them.</p>
<p>So we only can,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the kind of data you could never buy yourself</p>
<p>unless you had maybe a million dollars a year</p>
<p>of budget to buy data.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happened with the hedge fund industry</p>
<p>is you have a lot of talented people</p>
<p>who used to be able to trade and still can trade,</p>
<p>but now they have such a data disadvantage,</p>
<p>it would never make sense for them to trade themselves.</p>
<p>But Numerai, by giving away this obfuscated data,</p>
<p>we can give them a really, really high quality data set</p>
<p>that would otherwise be very expensive.</p>
<p>And they can use whatever new machine learning technique</p>
<p>they want to find patterns in that data</p>
<p>that we can use in our hedge fund.</p>
<p>And so how much variety is there in underlying data?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>I apologize if I&rsquo;m using the wrong terms,</p>
<p>but one is just like the stock price.</p>
<p>The other, there&rsquo;s like options and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>like the, what are they called, order books or whatever.</p>
<p>Is there maybe other totally unrelated</p>
<p>directly to the stock market data,</p>
<p>like natural language as well, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, we were really focused on stock data</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s specific to stocks.</p>
<p>So things like you can have like a,</p>
<p>every stock has like a PE ratio.</p>
<p>For some stocks, it&rsquo;s not as meaningful,</p>
<p>but every stock has that.</p>
<p>Every stock has one year momentum,</p>
<p>how much they went up in the last year,</p>
<p>but those are very common factors.</p>
<p>But we try to get lots and lots of those factors</p>
<p>that we have for many, many years,</p>
<p>like 15, 20 years history.</p>
<p>And then the setup of the problem is commonly in quant</p>
<p>called like cross sectional global equity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not really trying to say,</p>
<p>I believe this stock will go up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to say the relative position of this stock</p>
<p>in feature space makes it not a bad buy in a portfolio.</p>
<p>So it captures some period of time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to find the patterns,</p>
<p>the dynamics captured by the data of that period of time</p>
<p>in order to make short term predictions</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, so our predictions are also not that short.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not really caring about things like order books</p>
<p>and tech data, not high frequency at all.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually holding things for quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>So our prediction time horizon is about one month.</p>
<p>We end up holding stocks</p>
<p>for maybe like three or four months.</p>
<p>So I kind of believe that&rsquo;s a little bit more</p>
<p>like investing than kind of plumbing,</p>
<p>like to go long a stock that&rsquo;s mispriced on one exchange</p>
<p>and short on another exchange, that&rsquo;s just arbitrage.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re trying to do is really know something more</p>
<p>about the longer term future of the stock.</p>
<p>Yeah, so from the patterns,</p>
<p>from these like periods of time series data,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to understand something fundamental</p>
<p>about the stock, not like about deep value,</p>
<p>about like it&rsquo;s big in the context of the market,</p>
<p>is it underpriced, overpriced, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So like, this is about investing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about like, just like you said,</p>
<p>high frequency trading,</p>
<p>which I think is a fascinating open question</p>
<p>from a machine learning perspective,</p>
<p>but just to like sort of build on that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve anonymized the data</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re giving away the data.</p>
<p>And then now anyone can try to build algorithms</p>
<p>that make investing decisions on top of that data</p>
<p>or predictions on the top of that data.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, what does that look like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal of that?</p>
<p>What are the underlying principles of that?</p>
<p>So the first thing is,</p>
<p>we could obviously model that data in house, right?</p>
<p>We can make an XGBoost model on the data</p>
<p>and that would be quite good too.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re trying to do is by opening it up</p>
<p>and letting anybody participate,</p>
<p>we can do quite a lot better than if we modeled it ourselves</p>
<p>and a lot better on the stock market</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need to be very much.</p>
<p>Like it really matters the difference</p>
<p>between if you can make 10 and 12%</p>
<p>in an equity market neutral hedge fund</p>
<p>because usually you&rsquo;re charging 2% fees.</p>
<p>So if you can do 2% better,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like all your fees, it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to make sure</p>
<p>that we always have the best possible model</p>
<p>as new machine learning libraries come out,</p>
<p>new techniques come out,</p>
<p>they get automatically synthesized.</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s a great paper on supervised learning,</p>
<p>someone on Numerai will figure out</p>
<p>how to use it on Numerai&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>And is there an ensemble of models going on</p>
<p>or is it more towards kind of like one or two or three</p>
<p>like best performing models?</p>
<p>So the way we decide on how to weight</p>
<p>all of the predictions together</p>
<p>is by how much the users are staking on them.</p>
<p>How much of the cryptocurrency</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re putting behind their models.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re saying, I believe in my model.</p>
<p>You can trust me because I&rsquo;m gonna put skin in the game.</p>
<p>And so we can take the stake weighted predictions</p>
<p>from all our users, add those together,</p>
<p>average those together,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a much better model than any one model</p>
<p>in the sum because ensembling a lot of models together</p>
<p>is kind of the key thing you need to do in investing too.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re putting,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a kind of duality from the user,</p>
<p>from the perspective of a machine learning engineer</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s both a competition, just a really interesting,</p>
<p>difficult machine learning problem,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a way to invest algorithmically.</p>
<p>So like, but the way to invest algorithmically</p>
<p>also is a way to put skin in the game</p>
<p>that communicates to you that the quality of the algorithm</p>
<p>and also forces you to really be serious</p>
<p>about the models that you build.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, everything just works nicely together.</p>
<p>Like, I guess one way to say that</p>
<p>is the interests are aligned.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s just like poker is not fun</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s like for very low stakes.</p>
<p>The higher the stakes,</p>
<p>the more the dynamics of the system</p>
<p>starts playing out correctly.</p>
<p>Like as a small side note,</p>
<p>is there something you can say about which kind,</p>
<p>looking at the big broad view of machine learning today</p>
<p>or AI, what kind of algorithms seem to do good</p>
<p>in these kinds of competitions at this time?</p>
<p>Is there some universal thing you can say,</p>
<p>like neural networks suck,</p>
<p>recurrent neural networks suck, transformers suck,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re awesome, like old school,</p>
<p>sort of more basic kind of classifiers are better,</p>
<p>all that, is there some kind of conclusions</p>
<p>so far that you can say?</p>
<p>There is definitely something pretty nice about tree models,</p>
<p>like XGBoost,</p>
<p>and they just seem to work pretty nicely</p>
<p>on this type of data.</p>
<p>So out of the box,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to come a hundredth</p>
<p>in the competition, in the tournament,</p>
<p>maybe you would try to use that.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s particularly interesting about the problem</p>
<p>that not many people understand,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re familiar with machine learning,</p>
<p>this typically will surprise you when you model our data.</p>
<p>So one of the things that you look at in finance</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t wanna be too exposed to any one risk.</p>
<p>Like, even if the best sector in the world</p>
<p>to invest in over the last 10 years was tech,</p>
<p>does not mean you should put all of your money into tech.</p>
<p>So if you train a model,</p>
<p>it would say, put all your money in tech, it&rsquo;s super good.</p>
<p>But what you wanna do is actually be very careful</p>
<p>of how much of this exposure you have to certain features.</p>
<p>So on Numeri, what a lot of people figure out is,</p>
<p>actually, if you train a model on this kind of data,</p>
<p>you wanna somehow neutralize or minimize your exposure</p>
<p>to these certain features, which is unusual,</p>
<p>because if you did train a stoplight</p>
<p>or stop street detection on computer vision,</p>
<p>your favorite feature, let&rsquo;s say you have an auto encoder</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s figuring out, okay, it&rsquo;s gotta be red</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gotta be white,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the last thing you wanna reduce your exposure to.</p>
<p>Why would you reduce your exposure</p>
<p>to the thing that&rsquo;s helping your model the most?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually this counterintuitive thing</p>
<p>you have to do with machine learning on financial data.</p>
<p>So reducing your exposure</p>
<p>would help you generalize the things that are&hellip;</p>
<p>So basically, a financial data has a large amount</p>
<p>of patterns that appeared in the past</p>
<p>and also a large amount of patterns</p>
<p>that have not appeared in the past.</p>
<p>And so like in that sense,</p>
<p>you have to reduce the exposure to red lights,</p>
<p>to the color red.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, but how much of this is art</p>
<p>and how much of it is science from your perspective so far</p>
<p>in terms of as you start to climb</p>
<p>from the 100th position to the 95th in the competition?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if you do make yourself super exposed</p>
<p>to one or two features,</p>
<p>you can have a lot of volatility</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re playing Numerai.</p>
<p>You could maybe very rapidly rise to be high</p>
<p>if you were getting lucky.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a bit like the stock market.</p>
<p>Sure, take on massive risk exposure,</p>
<p>put all your money into one stock</p>
<p>and you might make 100%,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t in the long run work out very well.</p>
<p>And so the best users are trying to stay high</p>
<p>for as long as possible,</p>
<p>not necessarily try to be first for a little bit.</p>
<p>So me, a developer, machine learning researcher,</p>
<p>how do I, Lex Friedman, participate in this competition</p>
<p>and how do others,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be a lot of others</p>
<p>interested in participating in this competition,</p>
<p>what are, let&rsquo;s see, there&rsquo;s like a million questions,</p>
<p>but like first one is how do I get started?</p>
<p>Well, you can go to numero.ai,</p>
<p>sign up, download the data.</p>
<p>And on the data is pretty small.</p>
<p>In the data pack you download,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like an example script,</p>
<p>Python script that just builds a XGBoost model</p>
<p>very quickly from the data.</p>
<p>And so in a very short time,</p>
<p>you can have an example model.</p>
<p>Is that a particular structure?</p>
<p>Like what, is this model then submitted somewhere?</p>
<p>So there needs to be some kind of structure</p>
<p>that communicates with some kind of API.</p>
<p>Like how does the whole,</p>
<p>how does your model, once you&rsquo;ve built,</p>
<p>once you create a little baby Frankenstein,</p>
<p>how does it then live in the world?</p>
<p>Okay, well, we want you to keep your baby Frankenstein</p>
<p>at home and take care of it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>So you never upload your model to us.</p>
<p>You always only giving us predictions.</p>
<p>So we never see the code that wrote your model,</p>
<p>which is pretty cool,</p>
<p>that our whole hedge fund is built from models</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve never, ever seen the code.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important for the users because it&rsquo;s their IP,</p>
<p>why do they want to give it to us?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got it themselves,</p>
<p>but they can basically almost like license</p>
<p>the predictions from that model to us.</p>
<p>License the predictions, yeah.</p>
<p>So. Think about it.</p>
<p>What some users do is they set up a compute server</p>
<p>and we call it Numeric Compute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little AWS kind of image</p>
<p>and you can automate this process.</p>
<p>So we can ping you.</p>
<p>We can be like, we need more predictions now.</p>
<p>And then you send it to us.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, is that described somewhere,</p>
<p>like what the preferred is, the AWS,</p>
<p>or whether another cloud platform,</p>
<p>is there, I mean, is there sort of specific technical things</p>
<p>you want to say that comes to mind</p>
<p>that is a good path for getting started?</p>
<p>So download the data, maybe play around,</p>
<p>see if you can modify the basic algorithm provided</p>
<p>in the example.</p>
<p>And then you, what, set up a little server on the AWS</p>
<p>that then runs this model and takes pings</p>
<p>and then makes predictions.</p>
<p>And so how does your own money actually come into play</p>
<p>doing the stake of a cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you don&rsquo;t have to stake.</p>
<p>You can start without staking.</p>
<p>And many users might try for months</p>
<p>without staking anything at all</p>
<p>to see if their model works on the real life data, right?</p>
<p>And is not overfit.</p>
<p>But then you can get Numeraire many different ways.</p>
<p>You can buy it on, you can buy some on Coinbase.</p>
<p>You can buy some on Uniswap.</p>
<p>You can buy some on Binance.</p>
<p>So what did you say this is?</p>
<p>How do you pronounce it?</p>
<p>So this is the Numeraire cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Yeah, NMR.</p>
<p>NMR, you just say NMR?</p>
<p>It is technically called Numeraire.</p>
<p>Numeraire, I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but NMR is simple.</p>
<p>NMR, Numeraire.</p>
<p>Okay, so, and you could buy it basically anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a bit strange</p>
<p>because sometimes people are like,</p>
<p>is this like pay to play?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, you need to put some money down</p>
<p>to show us you believe in your model.</p>
<p>But weirdly, we&rsquo;re not selling you the,</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t buy the cryptocurrency from us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s also, we never,</p>
<p>if you do badly, we destroy your cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s not good, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want it to be destroyed.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s good about it is it&rsquo;s also not coming to us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like we win when you lose or something,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re the house.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re definitely on the same team.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Helping us make a hedge fund that&rsquo;s never been done before.</p>
<p>Yeah, so again, interests are aligned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no tension there at all,</p>
<p>which is really fascinating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving away everything</p>
<p>and then the IP is owned by sort of the code.</p>
<p>You never share the code.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So since I have you here and you said a hundred,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t ask out of how many, so we&rsquo;ll just,</p>
<p>but if I then once you get started</p>
<p>and you find this interesting, how do you then win</p>
<p>or do well, but also how do you potentially try to win</p>
<p>if this is something you want to take on seriously</p>
<p>from the machine learning perspective,</p>
<p>not from a financial perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that first of all,</p>
<p>you would want to talk to the community.</p>
<p>People are pretty open.</p>
<p>We give out really interesting scripts and ideas</p>
<p>for things you might want to try.</p>
<p>And, but you&rsquo;re also going to need a lot of compute probably.</p>
<p>And so some of the best users are, you know,</p>
<p>actually the very first time someone won on Numerai,</p>
<p>I would, I wrote them a personal email.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, you&rsquo;ve won some money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited to give you $300.</p>
<p>And then they said, I spend way more on the compute,</p>
<p>but.</p>
<p>So this is fundamentally a machine learning problem first,</p>
<p>I think is this is one of the exciting things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll, in how many ways we can approach this,</p>
<p>but really this is less about kind of no offense,</p>
<p>but like finance people, finance minded people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also, I&rsquo;m sure great people,</p>
<p>but it feels like from the community that I&rsquo;ve experienced,</p>
<p>these are people who see finance</p>
<p>as a fascinating problem space, source of data,</p>
<p>but ultimately they&rsquo;re machine learning people or AI people,</p>
<p>which is a very different kind of flavor of community.</p>
<p>And I mean, I should say to that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to participate in this and I will participate in this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d love to hear from other people.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a machine learning person,</p>
<p>you should participate in it and tell me,</p>
<p>give me some hints how I can do well at this thing.</p>
<p>Cause this boomer, I&rsquo;m not sure I still got it,</p>
<p>but cause some of it is, it&rsquo;s like a Kaggle competitions.</p>
<p>Like some of it is certainly set of ideas,</p>
<p>like research ideas, like fundamental innovation,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure some of it is like deeply understanding,</p>
<p>getting like an intuition about the data.</p>
<p>And then like a lot of it will be like figuring out</p>
<p>like what works, like tricks.</p>
<p>I mean, you could argue most of deep learning research</p>
<p>is just tricks on top of tricks,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some of it is just the art</p>
<p>of getting to know how to work in a really difficult</p>
<p>machine learning problem.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>the important difference with something</p>
<p>like a Kaggle competition,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll set up this kind of toy problem</p>
<p>and then there will be an out of sample test,</p>
<p>like, Hey, you did well out of sample.</p>
<p>And this is like, okay, cool.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s cool with Numeri is the out of sample</p>
<p>is the real life stock market.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know,</p>
<p>like we don&rsquo;t know the onset of the problem.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, like you&rsquo;ll have to find out live.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve had users who&rsquo;ve like submitted every week</p>
<p>for like four years because it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>we say it&rsquo;s the hardest data science problem</p>
<p>on the planet, right?</p>
<p>And it sounds maybe sounds like maybe</p>
<p>but too much for like a marketing thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the hardest because it&rsquo;s the stock market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like literally there are like billions of dollars</p>
<p>at stake and like no one&rsquo;s like letting it be inefficient</p>
<p>on purpose.</p>
<p>So if you can find something that works at Numeri,</p>
<p>you really have something that is like working</p>
<p>on the real stock market.</p>
<p>Yeah, because there&rsquo;s like humans involved</p>
<p>in the stock market.</p>
<p>I mean, you could argue there might be harder data sets</p>
<p>like maybe predicting the weather,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But the fundamental statement here is, which I like,</p>
<p>I was thinking like,</p>
<p>is this really the hardest data science problem?</p>
<p>And you start thinking about that,</p>
<p>but ultimately it also boils down to a problem</p>
<p>where the data is accessible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made accessible, made really easy and efficient</p>
<p>at like submitting algorithms.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about the data being out there, like the weather.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about making the data super accessible,</p>
<p>making the ability of community around it.</p>
<p>Like this is what ImageNet did.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not just, there&rsquo;s always images.</p>
<p>The point is you aggregate them together.</p>
<p>You give it a little title.</p>
<p>This is a community and that was one of the hardest,</p>
<p>right, for a time.</p>
<p>And most important data science problems in the world</p>
<p>because it was accessible, because it was made sort of,</p>
<p>like there was mechanisms by which like standards</p>
<p>and mechanisms by which you judge your performance,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And Numerize actually step up from that.</p>
<p>Is there something more you can say about why</p>
<p>from your perspective it&rsquo;s the hardest problem in the world?</p>
<p>I mean, you said it&rsquo;s connected to the market.</p>
<p>So if you could find a pattern in the market,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really difficult thing to do</p>
<p>because a lot of people are trying to do it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the biggest one is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s non stationary time series.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve tried to regularize the data</p>
<p>so you can find patterns by doing certain things</p>
<p>to the features and the target.</p>
<p>But ultimately you&rsquo;re in a space where you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no guarantees that the out of sample distributions</p>
<p>will conform to any of the training data.</p>
<p>And every single era, which we call on the website,</p>
<p>like every single era in the data,</p>
<p>which is like sort of showing you the order of the time.</p>
<p>Even the training data has the same dislocations.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, and then there&rsquo;s so many things</p>
<p>that you might wanna try.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s unlimited possible number of models, right?</p>
<p>And so by having it be open,</p>
<p>we can at least search that space.</p>
<p>Zooming back out to the philosophical,</p>
<p>you said that Numerai is very much like Wall Street Bets.</p>
<p>Is there, I think it&rsquo;d be interesting</p>
<p>to dig in why you think so.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re speaking to the distributed nature of the two</p>
<p>and the power of the people nature of the two.</p>
<p>So maybe can you speak to the similarities</p>
<p>and the differences and in which way is Numerai more powerful</p>
<p>in which way is Wall Street Bets more powerful?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is why the Wall Street Bets story</p>
<p>is so interesting to me because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>feels like we&rsquo;re connected.</p>
<p>And looking at how,</p>
<p>just looking at the form of Wall Street Bets,</p>
<p>I was talking earlier about how,</p>
<p>how can you make credible claims?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re anonymous.</p>
<p>Okay, well, maybe you can take a screenshot.</p>
<p>Or maybe you can upvote someone.</p>
<p>Maybe you can have karma on Reddit.</p>
<p>And those kinds of things make this emerging thing possible.</p>
<p>Numerai, it didn&rsquo;t work at all when we started.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work at all.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>People made multiple accounts.</p>
<p>They made really random models</p>
<p>and hoped they would get lucky.</p>
<p>And some of them did.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Staking was our solution to,</p>
<p>could we make it so that we could trust?</p>
<p>We could know which model people believed in the most.</p>
<p>And we could weight models that had high stake more</p>
<p>and effectively coordinate this group of people</p>
<p>to be like, well, actually there&rsquo;s no incentive</p>
<p>to creating bot accounts anymore.</p>
<p>Either I stake my accounts,</p>
<p>in which case I should believe in them</p>
<p>because I could lose my stake or I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very powerful thing</p>
<p>that having a negative incentive</p>
<p>and a positive incentive can make things a lot better.</p>
<p>And staking is like this,</p>
<p>is this really nice like key thing about blockchain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like something special you can do</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re not even trusting us</p>
<p>with their stake in some ways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trusting the blockchain, right?</p>
<p>So the incentives, like you say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about making these perfect incentives</p>
<p>so that you can have coordination to solve one problem.</p>
<p>And nowadays I sleep easy</p>
<p>because I have less money in my own hedge fund</p>
<p>than our users are staking on their models.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>In some sense, from a human psychology perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating that the WallStreetBets worked at all, right?</p>
<p>That amidst that chaos, emerging behavior,</p>
<p>like behavior that made sense emerged.</p>
<p>It would be fascinating to think if numerized style staking</p>
<p>could then be transferred to places like Reddit, you know?</p>
<p>And not necessarily for financial investments,</p>
<p>but I wish sometimes people would have to stake something</p>
<p>in the comments they make on the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem with anonymity is like,</p>
<p>anonymity is freedom and power</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to, you can speak your mind,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s too easy to just be shitty.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So this, I mean, you&rsquo;re making me realize</p>
<p>from a profoundly philosophical aspect, numerized staking</p>
<p>is a really clean way to solve this problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really beautiful way.</p>
<p>Of course, it only with Numerai currently works</p>
<p>for a very particular problem, right?</p>
<p>Not for human interaction on the internet,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s nothing to stop people.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;ve open sourced the code we use for staking</p>
<p>in a protocol we call Erasure.</p>
<p>And if Reddit wanted to, they could even use that code</p>
<p>to enable staking on our Wall Street pets.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re actually researching now,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had some Ethereum grants</p>
<p>on how could they have more crypto stuff in there</p>
<p>in Ethereum, because wouldn&rsquo;t that be interesting?</p>
<p>Like, imagine you could, instead of seeing a screenshot,</p>
<p>like, guys, I promise I will not sell my GameStop.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going to go huge.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to sell at all.</p>
<p>And here is a smart contract, which no one in the world,</p>
<p>including me, can undo, that says,</p>
<p>I have staked millions against this claim.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>And then what could you do?</p>
<p>And of course, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be millions.</p>
<p>It could be just a very small amount,</p>
<p>but then just a huge number of users doing that kind of stake.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That could change the internet.</p>
<p>It would change, and then Wall Street.</p>
<p>It would change Wall Street.</p>
<p>They would never have been able to,</p>
<p>they would still be short squeezing one day</p>
<p>after the next, every single hedge fund collapsing.</p>
<p>If we look into the future, do you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that numerae style infrastructure,</p>
<p>where AI systems backed by humans are doing the trading,</p>
<p>is what the entirety of the stock market is,</p>
<p>or the entirety of the economy, is</p>
<p>run by basically this army of AI systems</p>
<p>with high level human supervision?</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing is that some of them could be bad actors.</p>
<p>Some of the humans?</p>
<p>No, well, these systems could be tricky.</p>
<p>So actually, I once met a hedge fund manager,</p>
<p>and this is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>He said, very famous one, and he said,</p>
<p>we can see, sometimes we can see things in the market</p>
<p>where we know we can make money, but it will mess shit up.</p>
<p>We know we can make money, but it will mess things up.</p>
<p>And we choose not to do those things.</p>
<p>And on the one hand, maybe this is like, oh, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being super arrogant.</p>
<p>Of course you can&rsquo;t do this, but maybe he can.</p>
<p>And maybe he really isn&rsquo;t doing things</p>
<p>he knows he could do, but would be pretty bad.</p>
<p>Would the Reddit army have that kind of morality or concern</p>
<p>for what they&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Probably not, based on what we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>The madness of crowds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be one person that says, hey, maybe,</p>
<p>and then they get trampled over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the terrifying thing, actually.</p>
<p>A lot of people have written about this,</p>
<p>is somehow that little voice that&rsquo;s human morality</p>
<p>gets silenced when we get into groups and start chanting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>But I think maybe I misunderstood.</p>
<p>I thought that you&rsquo;re saying AI systems can be dangerous,</p>
<p>but you just describe how humans can be dangerous.</p>
<p>So which is safer?</p>
<p>So one thing is, so Wall Street bets these kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible to model, numerize data,</p>
<p>and then come up with the idea from the model,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s short squeak, just game stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even framed in that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible to have that idea.</p>
<p>But it is possible for a bunch of humans.</p>
<p>So I think this, it&rsquo;s, numera could get very powerful</p>
<p>without it being dangerous.</p>
<p>But Wall Street bets needs to get a little bit more powerful,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be pretty dangerous.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, this is a good place</p>
<p>to think about numera data today and numera signals</p>
<p>and what that looks like in 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 years.</p>
<p>Right now, I guess, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but the data that we&rsquo;re working with is like a window.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an anonymized, obfuscated window</p>
<p>into a particular aspect, time period of the market.</p>
<p>And you can expand that more and more and more and more,</p>
<p>potentially.</p>
<p>You can imagine in different dimensions</p>
<p>to where it encapsulates all the things that,</p>
<p>where you could include kind of human to human communication</p>
<p>that was available to buy GameStop, for example,</p>
<p>on Wall Street bets.</p>
<p>So maybe as a step back, can you speak</p>
<p>to what is numera signals and what are the different data</p>
<p>sets that are involved?</p>
<p>So with numera signals, you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>providing predictions to us, but you can do it</p>
<p>from your own data sets.</p>
<p>So numera, it&rsquo;s all you have to model our data</p>
<p>to come up with predictions.</p>
<p>Numa signals is whatever data you can find out there,</p>
<p>you can turn it into a signal and give it to us.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a way for us to import signals</p>
<p>on data we don&rsquo;t yet have.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s particularly valuable,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to be signals.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only rewarded for signals that are</p>
<p>orthogonal to our core signal.</p>
<p>So you have to be doing something uncorrelated.</p>
<p>And so strange alternative data tends to have that property.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t too many other signals</p>
<p>that are correlated with what&rsquo;s happening on Wall Street</p>
<p>bets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to be correlated with the price</p>
<p>to earnings ratio.</p>
<p>And we have some users, as of recently, as of a week ago,</p>
<p>there was a user that created, I think he&rsquo;s in India,</p>
<p>he created a signal that is scraped from Wall Street bets.</p>
<p>And now we have that signal as one</p>
<p>of our signals in thousands that we use at Numerai.</p>
<p>And the structure of the signal is similar,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just numbers and time series data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, you&rsquo;re providing a ranking of stocks.</p>
<p>So you just say, a one means you like the stock,</p>
<p>zero means you don&rsquo;t like the stock,</p>
<p>and you provide that for 5,000 stocks in the world.</p>
<p>And they somehow converted the natural language</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the Wall Street bet.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And they open sourced this Colab notebook.</p>
<p>You can go and see it.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, it&rsquo;s making a sentiment score.</p>
<p>And then turning it into a rank of stocks.</p>
<p>A sentiment score.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, this stock sucks, or this stock is awesome.</p>
<p>And then converting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Just even looking at that data would be fascinating.</p>
<p>So on the signal side, what&rsquo;s the vision?</p>
<p>This long term, what do you see that becoming?</p>
<p>So we want to manage all the money in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Numerai&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>And to get that, we need to have all the data</p>
<p>and have all of the talent.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s no way, first principles,</p>
<p>if you had really good modeling and really good data</p>
<p>that you would lose, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of how much do you need to get really good.</p>
<p>So Numerai already has some really nice data</p>
<p>that we give out.</p>
<p>This year, we are 10xing that.</p>
<p>And I actually think we&rsquo;ll 10x the amount of data</p>
<p>we have on Numerai every year for at least the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to get very big, the data we give out.</p>
<p>And signals is more data.</p>
<p>People with any other random data set</p>
<p>can turn that into a signal and give it to us.</p>
<p>And in some sense, that kind of data</p>
<p>is the edge cases, the weirdness is the,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re focused on the bulk, the main data.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s just weirdness from all over the place</p>
<p>that just can enter through this back door of Numerai signals.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also a little bit shorter term.</p>
<p>So the signals are about a seven day time horizon.</p>
<p>And on Numerai, it&rsquo;s like a 30 day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s often for faster situations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written about a master plan.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve mentioned, which I love,</p>
<p>in a similar sort of style of big style thinking,</p>
<p>you would like Numerai to manage all of the world&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>So how do we get there from yesterday</p>
<p>to several years from now?</p>
<p>Like what is the plan?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve already started to allure to get all the data</p>
<p>and get all the talent, humans, models.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, the important thing to note there is,</p>
<p>what would that mean?</p>
<p>And I think the biggest thing it means</p>
<p>is if there was one hedge fund, you</p>
<p>would have not so much talent wasted</p>
<p>on all the other hedge funds.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s super weird how the industry works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one hedge fund gets a data source and hires a PhD.</p>
<p>And another hedge fund has to buy the same data source</p>
<p>and hire a PhD.</p>
<p>And suddenly, a third of American PhDs</p>
<p>are working at hedge funds.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not even on Mars.</p>
<p>And so in some ways, Numerai, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all about freeing up people who work at hedge funds</p>
<p>to go work for Elon.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also, the people who are working on Numerai problem,</p>
<p>it feels like a lot of the knowledge</p>
<p>there is also transferable to other domains.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>One of our top users, he works at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I went to go visit him there.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got Numerai posters.</p>
<p>And it looks like the movies.</p>
<p>It looks like Apollo 11 or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, the point is he didn&rsquo;t quit his job to join full time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s working on getting us to Jupiter&rsquo;s moon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his mission, the Europa Klippa mission.</p>
<p>Actually, literally what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s smart enough that we really want his intelligence</p>
<p>to reach the stock market.</p>
<p>Because the stock market&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Hedge funds are a good thing.</p>
<p>All kinds of hedge funds, especially.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t want him to quit his job.</p>
<p>So he can just do Numerai on the weekends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he does.</p>
<p>He just made a model and it just automatically submits to us.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like one of our best users.</p>
<p>You mentioned briefly that stock markets are good.</p>
<p>From my sort of outsider perspective, is there a sense,</p>
<p>do you think trading stocks is closer to gambling?</p>
<p>Or is it closer to investing?</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like it&rsquo;s gambling as opposed to betting</p>
<p>on companies that succeed.</p>
<p>And this is maybe connected to our discussion of shorting</p>
<p>in general, but from your sense, the way you think about it,</p>
<p>is it fundamentally still investing?</p>
<p>I do think, I mean, it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen lately people say, this is like speculation.</p>
<p>Is there too much speculation in the market?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, but all the trades are speculative.</p>
<p>All the trades have a horizon.</p>
<p>People want them to work.</p>
<p>So I would say that there&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>a lot of aspects of gambling math that applies to investing.</p>
<p>Like one thing you don&rsquo;t do in gambling</p>
<p>is put all your money in one bet.</p>
<p>You have bankroll management, and it&rsquo;s a key part of it.</p>
<p>And small alterations to your bankroll management</p>
<p>might be better than improvements to your skill.</p>
<p>And then there are things we care about in our fund.</p>
<p>Like we want to make a lot of independent bets.</p>
<p>We talk about it, like we want to make</p>
<p>a lot of independent bets, because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a higher sharp than if you have a lot of bets that</p>
<p>depend on each other, like all in one sector.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, the point is that you</p>
<p>want the prices of the stocks to be reflective of their value.</p>
<p>Of the underlying value of the company.</p>
<p>Yeah, you shouldn&rsquo;t have there be like a hedge fund that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>able to say, well, I&rsquo;ve looked at some data,</p>
<p>and all of this stuff&rsquo;s super mispriced.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super bad for society if it looks like that to someone.</p>
<p>I guess the underlying question then</p>
<p>is, do you see that the market often drifts away</p>
<p>from the underlying value of companies,</p>
<p>and it becomes a game in itself?</p>
<p>Like with these, whatever they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>like derivatives, like the options, and shorting,</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like layers of game on top of the actual,</p>
<p>like what you said, which is like the basic thing</p>
<p>that the Wall Street Bets was doing,</p>
<p>which is like just buying stocks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There are a lot of games that people</p>
<p>play that are in the derivatives market.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of the stuff people dislike when they look</p>
<p>at the history of what&rsquo;s happened,</p>
<p>they hate like credit default swaps,</p>
<p>or collateralized debt obligations.</p>
<p>Like these are the enemies of 2008.</p>
<p>And then the long term capital management thing,</p>
<p>it was like they had 30 times leverage, or something.</p>
<p>You could just go to a gas station</p>
<p>and ask anybody at the gas station,</p>
<p>is it a good idea to have 30 times leverage?</p>
<p>And they just say no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like common sense just like went out the window.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t respect long term capital management.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>But Numerai doesn&rsquo;t actually use any derivatives</p>
<p>unless you call shorting derivative.</p>
<p>We just we do put money into companies.</p>
<p>And that does help the companies we&rsquo;re investing in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just in little ways.</p>
<p>We really did buy Tesla.</p>
<p>And it did.</p>
<p>And we played some role in its success.</p>
<p>Super small, make no mistake.</p>
<p>But still, I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a pothead question,</p>
<p>which is what is money, man?</p>
<p>So if we just kind of zoom out and look at,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about cryptocurrency, which</p>
<p>perhaps could be the future of money.</p>
<p>In general, how do you think about money?</p>
<p>You said Numerai, the vision, the goal</p>
<p>is to run, to manage the world&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>What is money in your view?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a good answer to that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s definitely in my personal life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become more and more warped.</p>
<p>And you start to care about the real thing,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s really going on here.</p>
<p>Elon talks about things like this,</p>
<p>like what is a company, really?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bunch of people who show up to work together</p>
<p>and they solve a problem.</p>
<p>And there might not be a stock out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trading that represents what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the real thing.</p>
<p>And being involved in crypto, I put</p>
<p>in crowdsale of Ethereum and all these other things</p>
<p>and different crypto hedge funds and things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve invested in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just kind of like, it feels</p>
<p>like how I used to think about money stuff</p>
<p>is just totally warped.</p>
<p>Because you stop caring about the price</p>
<p>and you care about the product.</p>
<p>So by the product, you mean the different mechanisms</p>
<p>that money is exchanged.</p>
<p>I mean, money is ultimately a kind of a little,</p>
<p>one is a store of wealth, but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a mechanism of exchanging wealth.</p>
<p>But what wealth means becomes a totally different thing,</p>
<p>especially with cryptocurrency, to where it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like these little contracts, these little agreements,</p>
<p>these transactions between human beings</p>
<p>that represent something that&rsquo;s bigger than just cash being</p>
<p>exchanged at 7.11, it feels like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll answer what is finance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what are you doing when you have the ability</p>
<p>to take out a loan?</p>
<p>You can bring a whole new future into being with finance.</p>
<p>If you couldn&rsquo;t get a student loan to get a college degree,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t get a college degree</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t have the money.</p>
<p>But now, weirdly, you can get it with, and all you have</p>
<p>is this loan, which is like, so now you</p>
<p>can bring a different future into the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how when I was saying earlier about if you rerun</p>
<p>American economic history without these things,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not allowed to take out loans,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to have derivatives,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to have money,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really magic thing how much</p>
<p>you can do with finance by bringing the future forward.</p>
<p>Finance is empowering.</p>
<p>We sometimes forget this, but it enables innovation.</p>
<p>It enables big risk takers and bold builders that ultimately</p>
<p>make this world better.</p>
<p>You said you were early in on cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Can you give your high level overview</p>
<p>of just your thoughts about the past, present, and future</p>
<p>of cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>Yeah, so my friends told me about Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and I was interested in equities a lot.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, it has no net present value.</p>
<p>It has no future cash flows.</p>
<p>Bitcoin pays no dividends.</p>
<p>So I really couldn&rsquo;t get my head around it,</p>
<p>that this could be valuable.</p>
<p>And then I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was early in cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>in fact, because it was like 2014.</p>
<p>It felt like a long time after Bitcoin.</p>
<p>But then I really liked some of the things</p>
<p>that Ethereum was doing.</p>
<p>It seemed like a super visionary thing.</p>
<p>I was reading something that was just</p>
<p>going to change the world when I was reading the white paper.</p>
<p>And I liked the different constructs</p>
<p>you could have inside of Ethereum</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t have on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Like smart contracts and all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>And even spoke about different constructions you could have.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a cool dance between Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the space of ideas.</p>
<p>It feels so young.</p>
<p>Like, I wonder what cryptocurrencies will look like</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin or Ethereum 2.0 or some version</p>
<p>will stick around or any of those,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to win out?</p>
<p>Or if there&rsquo;s even a concept of winning out at all?</p>
<p>Is there a cryptocurrency that you especially</p>
<p>find interesting that technically, financially,</p>
<p>philosophically, you think is something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re keeping your eye on?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to invest in cryptocurrencies anymore.</p>
<p>But I mean, and many are almost identical.</p>
<p>I mean, there wasn&rsquo;t too much difference</p>
<p>between even Ethereum and Bitcoin in some ways, right?</p>
<p>But there are some that I like the privacy ones.</p>
<p>I mean, I like Zcash for its coolness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a different kind of invention</p>
<p>compared to some of the other things.</p>
<p>OK, can you speak just briefly to privacy?</p>
<p>Is there some mechanism of preserving</p>
<p>some privacy of the universe?</p>
<p>So I guess everything is public.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that the problem?</p>
<p>Yeah, none of the transactions are private.</p>
<p>And so I have some numeraire.</p>
<p>And you can just see it.</p>
<p>In fact, you can go to a website and it says like,</p>
<p>you can go to like, etherscan.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll say like, numeraire founder.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, how the hell do you guys know this?</p>
<p>So they can reverse the near, whatever that&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so they can see me move it, too.</p>
<p>They can see me.</p>
<p>Oh, why is he moving it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So but yeah, Zcash.</p>
<p>Also, when you can make private transactions,</p>
<p>you can also play different games.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what&rsquo;s quite cool about Zcash</p>
<p>is I wonder what games are being played there.</p>
<p>No one will know.</p>
<p>So from a deeply analytical perspective,</p>
<p>can you describe why Dogecoin is going to win?</p>
<p>Which it surely will.</p>
<p>Like it very likely will take over the world.</p>
<p>And once we expand out into the universe,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll take over the universe.</p>
<p>Or on a more serious note, like what</p>
<p>are your thoughts on the recent success of Dogecoin</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve spoken to sort of the meme stocks,</p>
<p>the memetics of the whole thing, that it feels like the joke can</p>
<p>become the reality.</p>
<p>Like the meme, the joke has power in this world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like why is it correlated with Elon tweeting about it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Elon alone tweeting, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Elon tweeting and that becomes</p>
<p>a catalyst for everybody on the internet kind of like spreading</p>
<p>the joke, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The joke of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the initial spark of the fire for Wall Street</p>
<p>bets type of situation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fascinating because jokes</p>
<p>seem to spread faster than other mechanisms.</p>
<p>Like funny shit is very effective at captivating</p>
<p>the discourse on the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think you can have, like I like the one meme,</p>
<p>like Doge, I haven&rsquo;t heard that name in a long time.</p>
<p>Like I think back to that meme often.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like funny.</p>
<p>And every time I think back to it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little probability that I might buy it, right?</p>
<p>And so imagine you have millions of people who have had</p>
<p>all these great jokes, told them,</p>
<p>and every now and then they reminisce,</p>
<p>oh, that was really funny.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re like, let me buy some.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be interesting if we travel in time</p>
<p>like multiple centuries where the entirety</p>
<p>of the communication of the human species is like humor?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s all just jokes.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re high on probably some really advanced drugs</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all just laughing nonstop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird like dystopian future of just humor.</p>
<p>Elon has made me realize how like good it feels</p>
<p>to just not take shit seriously every once in a while</p>
<p>and just relieve like the pressure of the world.</p>
<p>At the same time, the reason I don&rsquo;t always like</p>
<p>when people finish their sentences with lol</p>
<p>is like when you don&rsquo;t take anything seriously.</p>
<p>When everything becomes a joke,</p>
<p>then it feels like that way of thinking</p>
<p>feels like it will destroy the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I often think of like,</p>
<p>will memes save the world or destroy it?</p>
<p>Because I think both are possible directions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think this is a big problem.</p>
<p>I mean, I always felt that about America,</p>
<p>a lot of people are telling jokes kind of all the time</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of good at it.</p>
<p>And you take someone aside, an American,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, I really wanna have a sincere conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like hard to even keep a straight face</p>
<p>because everything is so, there&rsquo;s so much levity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>I like how sincere actually like your Twitter can be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I am in love with the world today.</p>
<p>I get so much shit for it, it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna stop because I realize like,</p>
<p>you have to be able to sometimes just be real</p>
<p>and be positive and just be, say the cliche things,</p>
<p>which ultimately those things actually capture</p>
<p>some fundamental truths about life.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a dance.</p>
<p>And I think Elon does a good job of that</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective of being able to joke,</p>
<p>but everyone&rsquo;s mostly to pull back and be like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s real problems, let&rsquo;s solve them and so on.</p>
<p>And then be able to jump back to a joke.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s ultimately, I think, I guess a skill that we</p>
<p>have to learn.</p>
<p>But I guess your advice is to invest everything</p>
<p>anyone listening owns into Dogecoin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I heard from this interaction.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, our hedge fund is unavailable.</p>
<p>Just go straight to Dogecoin.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re running a successful company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting because my mind has been in that space</p>
<p>of potentially just being one of the millions of other</p>
<p>entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your advice on how to build a successful startup,</p>
<p>how to build a successful company?</p>
<p>I think that one thing I do like,</p>
<p>and it might be a particular thing about America,</p>
<p>but there is something about playing,</p>
<p>tell people what you really want to happen in the world.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna make it,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re asking someone to invest in your company,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t say, I think maybe one day we might make</p>
<p>a million dollars.</p>
<p>When you actually believe something else,</p>
<p>you actually believe you&rsquo;re actually more optimistic,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re toning down your optimism because you want</p>
<p>to appear like low risk.</p>
<p>But actually it&rsquo;s super high risk if your company</p>
<p>becomes mediocre because no one wants to work</p>
<p>in a mediocre company.</p>
<p>No one wants to invest in a mediocre company.</p>
<p>So you should play the real game.</p>
<p>And obviously this doesn&rsquo;t apply to all businesses,</p>
<p>but if you play a venture backed startup kind of game,</p>
<p>like play for keeps, play to win, go big.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always feel like, yeah,</p>
<p>you can start narrowing your focus because 10 people</p>
<p>are telling you, you gotta care about this boring thing</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t matter five years from now.</p>
<p>And you should push back and do the real,</p>
<p>play the real game.</p>
<p>So be bold.</p>
<p>So both, I mean, there&rsquo;s an interesting duality there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the way you speak to other people</p>
<p>about like your plans and what you are like privately</p>
<p>just in your own mind.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s connected with what you were saying about,</p>
<p>yeah, sincerity as well.</p>
<p>Like if you appear to be sincerely optimistic</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s big or crazy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s putting yourself up to be kind of like</p>
<p>ridiculed or something.</p>
<p>And so if you say, my mission is to, yeah, go to Mars,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so bonkers that it&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>It is, but one powerful thing, just like you said,</p>
<p>is if you say it and you believe it,</p>
<p>then actually amazing people come and work with you.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just skill, but the dreams.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about optimism that,</p>
<p>like that fire that you have when you&rsquo;re optimistic</p>
<p>of actually having the hope of building</p>
<p>something totally cool, something totally new,</p>
<p>that when those people get in a room together,</p>
<p>like they can actually do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, yeah, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and also makes life really fun when you&rsquo;re in that room.</p>
<p>So all of that together, ultimately,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s what makes this crazy ride</p>
<p>of a startup really look fun.</p>
<p>And Elon is an example of a person who succeeded at that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many other inspiring figures, which is sad.</p>
<p>I used to be at Google and there&rsquo;s something that happens</p>
<p>that sometimes when the company grows</p>
<p>bigger and bigger and bigger,</p>
<p>where that kind of ambition kind of quiets down a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Google had this ambition, still does,</p>
<p>of making the world&rsquo;s information accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>And I remember, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I still love that dream of that they used to scan books,</p>
<p>but just in every way possible</p>
<p>make the world&rsquo;s information accessible.</p>
<p>Same with Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Every time I open up Wikipedia,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just awe inspired by how awesome humans are, man.</p>
<p>And creating this together,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the meanings are over there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just beautiful.</p>
<p>Like what they&rsquo;ve created is incredible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to be able to be part of something like that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, for that, you have to be bold.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, and strange to me also,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how many boring companies there are.</p>
<p>Something I always talk about, especially in FinTech,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, why am I excited about, this is so lame.</p>
<p>Like what is, this isn&rsquo;t even important.</p>
<p>Even if you succeed, this is gonna be like terrible.</p>
<p>This is not good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just strange how people can kind of</p>
<p>get fake enthusiastic about like boring ideas</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s so many bigger ideas that,</p>
<p>yeah, I mean, you read these things,</p>
<p>like this company raises money,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, that&rsquo;s a lot of money</p>
<p>for the worst idea I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>Some ideas are really big.</p>
<p>So like I worked on autonomous vehicles quite a bit.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many ways in which you can present</p>
<p>that idea to yourself, to the team you work with,</p>
<p>to just, yeah, like to yourself when you&rsquo;re quietly</p>
<p>looking in the mirror in the morning,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really boring or really exciting.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re really ambitious with autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>it changes the nature of like human robot interaction,</p>
<p>it changes the nature of how we move.</p>
<p>Forget money, forget all that stuff.</p>
<p>It changes like everything about robotics and AI,</p>
<p>machine learning, it changes everything about manufacture.</p>
<p>I mean, cars, transportation is so fundamentally connected</p>
<p>to cars, and if that changes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s changing the fabric of society,</p>
<p>of movies, of everything.</p>
<p>And if you go bold and take risks</p>
<p>and be willing to go bankrupt with your company,</p>
<p>as opposed to cautiously, you can really change the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so sad for me to see all these autonomous companies,</p>
<p>autonomous vehicle companies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like really more focused about fundraising</p>
<p>and kind of like smoke and mirrors,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really afraid,</p>
<p>the entirety of their marketing is grounded in fear</p>
<p>and presenting enough smoke to where they keep raising funds</p>
<p>so they can cautiously use technology of a previous decade</p>
<p>or previous two decades to kind of test vehicles</p>
<p>here and there, as opposed to do crazy things</p>
<p>and bold and go huge at scale, do huge data collection.</p>
<p>And yeah, so that&rsquo;s just an example.</p>
<p>Like the idea can be big,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t allow yourself to take that idea</p>
<p>and think really big with it,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not gonna make anything happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re absolutely right in that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been connected in your work</p>
<p>with a bunch of amazing people.</p>
<p>How much interaction do you have with investors,</p>
<p>that whole process is an entire mystery to me.</p>
<p>Is there some people that just have influence</p>
<p>on the trajectory of your thinking completely,</p>
<p>or is it just this collective energy behind the company?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I came here and I was amazed how,</p>
<p>yeah, people would, I was only here for a few months</p>
<p>and I met some incredible investors</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d almost run out of money.</p>
<p>And once they invested, I was like,</p>
<p>I am not gonna let you down.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna send them</p>
<p>like an email update every like three minutes.</p>
<p>And then they don&rsquo;t care at all.</p>
<p>So they kind of wanna, I don&rsquo;t know, like,</p>
<p>so for some, I like it when it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always available to talk,</p>
<p>but a lot of building a business,</p>
<p>especially a high tech business,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little for them to add, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little for them to add on product.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot for them to add on like business development.</p>
<p>And if we are doing product research,</p>
<p>which is for us research into the market,</p>
<p>research into how to make a great hedge fund,</p>
<p>and we do that for years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not much to tell the investors.</p>
<p>So that basically is like, I believe in you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, I like the cut of your jib.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in your idea, in your ambition,</p>
<p>in your plans that I like.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like a pat on the back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, go get them kid.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a bit like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad they do it that way.</p>
<p>Like the one meeting I had,</p>
<p>which was like really good with this</p>
<p>was meeting Howard Morgan,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s actually a co founder of Renaissance Technologies</p>
<p>in the like 1980s and worked with Jim Simons.</p>
<p>And he was in the room</p>
<p>and I was meeting some other guy and he was in the room</p>
<p>and I was explaining how quantitative finance works.</p>
<p>I was like, so they use mathematical models.</p>
<p>And then he was like, yeah, I started Renaissance.</p>
<p>I know a bit about this.</p>
<p>And then I was like, oh my God.</p>
<p>So yeah, but then, and then I think he kind of said, well,</p>
<p>yeah, he said, well, cause I was talking,</p>
<p>he was working at first round capital as a partner</p>
<p>and they kind of said, they didn&rsquo;t want to invest.</p>
<p>And then I wrote a blog post describing the idea</p>
<p>and I was like, I really think you guys should invest.</p>
<p>And then they end up.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>You convinced them on that.</p>
<p>That must be good.</p>
<p>Yeah, cause they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really invest in hedge funds.</p>
<p>And I was like, you don&rsquo;t see like what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>This is so a tech company, not a hedge fund, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and Numerai is brilliant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, when it caught my eye,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something special there.</p>
<p>So I really do hope you succeed in the,</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s a risky thing you&rsquo;re taking on,</p>
<p>the ambition of it, the size of it,</p>
<p>but I do hope you succeed.</p>
<p>You mentioned Jim Simons.</p>
<p>He comes up in another world of mine really often on the,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just a brilliant guy on the mathematics side</p>
<p>as a mathematician,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also brilliant finance hedge fund manager guy.</p>
<p>Have you gotten a chance to interact with him at all?</p>
<p>Have you learned anything from him on the math,</p>
<p>on the finance, on the philosophy, life side, things?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played poker with him.</p>
<p>It was pretty cool.</p>
<p>It was like, actually in the show, Billions,</p>
<p>they kind of do a little thing about this poker tournament</p>
<p>thing with all the hedge fund managers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s real life thing.</p>
<p>And they have a lot of like world series of bracelet,</p>
<p>world series poker bracelets holders,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of Jim&rsquo;s thing.</p>
<p>And I met him there and yeah, it was kind of brief,</p>
<p>but I was just like, he&rsquo;s like, oh, how do you,</p>
<p>why are you here?</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, Howard sent me, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, go play this tournament,</p>
<p>meet some of the other players.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>Was it Texas Holdem?</p>
<p>Yeah, Texas Holdem tournament, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you play poker yourself or was it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I mean, it was crazy.</p>
<p>On my right was the CEO,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the current CEO of Renaissance, Peter Brown.</p>
<p>And Peter Muller, who&rsquo;s a hedge fund manager at PDT.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, it was just like,</p>
<p>and then, you know, just everyone.</p>
<p>And then all these bracelet world series,</p>
<p>like people that I know from like TV.</p>
<p>And Robert Mercer, who&rsquo;s fucking crazy.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the guy who donated the most money to Trump.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just like&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of personality.</p>
<p>Character, yeah, geez, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s quite cool how, yeah, like the, it was really fun.</p>
<p>And then I managed to knock out Peter Muller.</p>
<p>I have a, I got a little trophy for knocking him out</p>
<p>because he was a previous champion.</p>
<p>In fact, I think he&rsquo;s won the most.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s won three times.</p>
<p>Super smart guy.</p>
<p>But I will say Jim outlasted me in the tournament.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all extremely good at poker,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also, so it was a $10,000 buy in.</p>
<p>And I was like, this is kind of expensive,</p>
<p>but it all goes to charity, Jim&rsquo;s math charity.</p>
<p>But then the way they play, they have like rebis</p>
<p>and like they all do a shit ton of rebis</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s for charity.</p>
<p>So immediately they&rsquo;re like going all in</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, man, like, so I ended up adding more as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like you couldn&rsquo;t play at all without doing that.</p>
<p>Yeah, the stakes are high.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re connected to a lot of these folks</p>
<p>that are kind of titans of just of economics</p>
<p>and tech in general.</p>
<p>Do you feel a burden from this?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a young guy.</p>
<p>I did feel a bit out of place there.</p>
<p>The company was quite new</p>
<p>and they also don&rsquo;t speak about things, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like going to meet a famous rocket engineer</p>
<p>who will tell you how to make a rocket.</p>
<p>They do not want to tell you anything</p>
<p>about how to make a hedge fund.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all secretive and that part I didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And they were also kind of making fun of me a little bit.</p>
<p>Like they would say, like they&rsquo;d call me like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the Bitcoin kid or.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And then they would say, even things like,</p>
<p>member Peter, yeah, said to me something like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think AI is gonna have a big role in finance.</p>
<p>And I was like, hearing this from the CEO of Renaissance</p>
<p>was like weird to hear because I was like,</p>
<p>of course it will.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, but he can see,</p>
<p>I can see it having a really big impact</p>
<p>on things like self driving cars.</p>
<p>But finance, it&rsquo;s too noisy and whatever.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s like the perfect application.</p>
<p>And I was like, that was interesting to hear</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, and I think it was that same day</p>
<p>that Libra, I think it is, the poker playing AI</p>
<p>started to beat like the human.</p>
<p>So it was kind of funny hearing them like say,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m not sure AI could ever attack that problem.</p>
<p>And then that very day it&rsquo;s attacking the problem</p>
<p>of the game we&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a kind of a magic to somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s exceptionally successful looking at you,</p>
<p>giving you respect, but also saying that what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is not going to succeed in a sense.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not really saying it,</p>
<p>but I tend to believe from my interactions with people</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a kind of prod to say like, prove me wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ultimately, that&rsquo;s how those guys talk.</p>
<p>They see good talent and they&rsquo;re like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re also saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna succeed quickly in some way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, this is gonna take a long time</p>
<p>and maybe that&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>And certainly AI in trading,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the most philosophically interesting questions</p>
<p>about artificial intelligence and the nature of money.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, how much can you extract</p>
<p>in terms of patterns from all of these millions</p>
<p>of humans interacting using this methodology of money?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one of the open questions</p>
<p>in the artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>In that sense, you converting into a data set</p>
<p>is one of like the biggest gifts to the research community,</p>
<p>to the whole, anyone who loves data science and AI,</p>
<p>this is kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see where this goes actually.</p>
<p>I think I say sometimes long before AGI destroys the world,</p>
<p>a narrow intelligence will win all the money</p>
<p>in the stock market.</p>
<p>Way, like just a narrow AI.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m gonna be the one who invents that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m building Numerai to make sure</p>
<p>that that narrow AI uses our data.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re giving a platform</p>
<p>to where millions of people can participate</p>
<p>and do build that narrow AI themselves.</p>
<p>People love it when I ask this kind of question</p>
<p>about books, about ideas and philosophers and so on.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you had books or ideas,</p>
<p>philosophers, thinkers that had an influence</p>
<p>on your life when you were growing up</p>
<p>or just today that you would recommend</p>
<p>that people check out blog posts, podcasts, videos,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Is there something that just kind of had an impact on you</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t recommend?</p>
<p>A super kind of obvious one that I really,</p>
<p>I was reading Zero to One while coming up with Numerai.</p>
<p>It was like halfway through the book.</p>
<p>And I really do like a lot of the ideas there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also about kind of thinking big</p>
<p>and also it&rsquo;s like peculiar little book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like why, like there&rsquo;s a little picture</p>
<p>of the hipster versus Unabomber.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a weird little book.</p>
<p>So I like, there&rsquo;s kind of like some depth there.</p>
<p>In terms of a book on a, if you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>of doing a startup, that&rsquo;s a good book.</p>
<p>A book I like a lot is maybe my favorite book</p>
<p>is David Deutsch&rsquo;s Beginning of Infinity.</p>
<p>I just found that so optimistic.</p>
<p>It puts you, everything you read in science,</p>
<p>it like makes the world feel like kind of colder</p>
<p>because like it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re just coming from evolution</p>
<p>and coming from nothing should be this way or whatever.</p>
<p>And humans are not very powerful.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just like scum on the earth.</p>
<p>And the way David Deutsch sees things</p>
<p>and argues, he argues them with the same rigor</p>
<p>that the cynics often use</p>
<p>and then has a much better conclusion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some of the statements of things like,</p>
<p>anything that doesn&rsquo;t violate the laws</p>
<p>of physics can be solved.</p>
<p>So ultimately arriving at a hopeful,</p>
<p>like a hopeful path forward.</p>
<p>Yeah, without being like a hippie.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned kind of advice for startups.</p>
<p>Is there, in general, whether you do a startup or not,</p>
<p>do you have advice for young people today?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like an example of somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s paved their own path</p>
<p>and were, I would say exceptionally successful.</p>
<p>Is there advice, somebody who&rsquo;s like 20 today, 18,</p>
<p>undergrad or thinking about going to college,</p>
<p>or in college and so on that you would give them?</p>
<p>I think I often tell young people don&rsquo;t start companies.</p>
<p>Is it not, don&rsquo;t start a company</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re prepared to make it your life&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a really good way of putting it.</p>
<p>And a lot of people think, well, this semester</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a semester off.</p>
<p>And in that one semester,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start a company and sell it or whatever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really work that way.</p>
<p>You should be like super into the idea,</p>
<p>so into it that you wanna spend a really long time on it.</p>
<p>Is that more about psychology or actual time allocation?</p>
<p>Like, is it literally the fact that you need to give 100%</p>
<p>for potentially years for it to succeed?</p>
<p>Or is it more about just the mindset that&rsquo;s required?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think, well, any, I think, yeah,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna have,</p>
<p>certainly don&rsquo;t wanna have a plan to sell the company</p>
<p>like quickly or something,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like a company that has a very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a big fashion component.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;ll only work now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an app or something.</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>And then I also think something I&rsquo;ve thought about recently</p>
<p>is I had a job as a quant at a fund</p>
<p>for about two and a half years.</p>
<p>And part of me thinks if I had spent</p>
<p>another two years there,</p>
<p>I would have learned a lot more</p>
<p>and had even more knowledge to be where,</p>
<p>to basically accelerate how long Numerai took.</p>
<p>So the idea that you can sit in an air conditioned room</p>
<p>and get free food,</p>
<p>or even sit at home now in your underwear</p>
<p>and make a huge amount of money and learn whatever you want</p>
<p>and get, it&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a good deal.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the case for, I was terrified of that.</p>
<p>Like at Google, I thought I would become really comfortable</p>
<p>in that air conditioned room.</p>
<p>And that, I was afraid the quant situation is,</p>
<p>I mean, what you present is really brilliant</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s exceptionally valuable, the lessons you learn,</p>
<p>because you get to get paid while you learn from others.</p>
<p>If you see that, if you see jobs</p>
<p>in the space of your passion that way,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just an education.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the best kind of education.</p>
<p>But of course you have, from my perspective,</p>
<p>you have to be really careful on that to get comfortable.</p>
<p>Again, in a relationship, then you buy a house</p>
<p>or whatever the hell it is, and then you get,</p>
<p>and then you convince yourself like,</p>
<p>well, I have to pay these fees for the car,</p>
<p>for the house, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s momentum and all of a sudden</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on your death bed and there&rsquo;s grandchildren</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re drinking whiskey</p>
<p>and complaining about kids these days.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m afraid of that momentum, but you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something special about the education</p>
<p>you get working at these companies.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I remember on my desk,</p>
<p>I had like a bunch of papers on quant finance,</p>
<p>a bunch of papers on optimization,</p>
<p>and then the paper on Ethereum, just on my desk as well,</p>
<p>and the white paper, and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been amazing how kind of, and you can learn about,</p>
<p>so that, I also thought, I think this idea</p>
<p>of like learning about intersections of things,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are too many people that know</p>
<p>like as much about crypto and quant finance</p>
<p>and machine learning as I do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really nice set of three things</p>
<p>to know stuff about.</p>
<p>And that was because I had like free time in my job.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask the perfectly impractical,</p>
<p>but the most important question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of all the things you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>so many amazing things, why?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of this life of yours or ours?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I have yet had some people say,</p>
<p>asking what meaning of life is,</p>
<p>is like asking the wrong question or something.</p>
<p>The question is wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, usually people get too nervous to be able to say that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like your question sucks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the searching for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sometimes asking it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sometimes sitting back and looking up at the stars</p>
<p>and being like, huh, I wonder if there&rsquo;s aliens up there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a useful like a palette cleanser aspect to it</p>
<p>because it kind of wakes you up to like all the little busy,</p>
<p>hurried day to day activities, all the meetings,</p>
<p>all the things you&rsquo;d like a part of.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just like ants, a part of a system,</p>
<p>a part of another system.</p>
<p>And then asking this bigger question</p>
<p>allows you to kind of zoom out and think about it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s ultimately,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an impossible thing for a limited capacity,</p>
<p>like cognitive capacity to capture.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fun to listen to somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s exceptionally successful, exceptionally busy now,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also young like you,</p>
<p>to ask these kinds of questions about like death.</p>
<p>You know, do you consider your own mortality kind of thing</p>
<p>and life, whether that enters your mind?</p>
<p>Because it often doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it kind of almost gets in the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how many things you can like that are trivial</p>
<p>that could occupy a lot of your mind</p>
<p>until something bad happens or something flips you.</p>
<p>And then you start thinking about the people you love</p>
<p>that are in your life.</p>
<p>Then you started thinking about like,</p>
<p>holy shit, this ride ends.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just had COVID and I had it quite bad.</p>
<p>What wasn&rsquo;t really bad is just like,</p>
<p>I also got a simultaneous like lung infection.</p>
<p>So I had like almost like bronchitis or whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even, I don&rsquo;t understand that stuff,</p>
<p>but I started, and then you&rsquo;re forced to be isolated.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s actually kind of nice</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very depressing.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve heard stories of, I think it&rsquo;s Sean Parker.</p>
<p>He had like all these diseases as a child</p>
<p>and he had to like just stay in bed for years.</p>
<p>And then he like made Napster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like pretty cool.</p>
<p>So yeah, I had about 15 days of this recently,</p>
<p>just last month.</p>
<p>And it feels like it did shock me</p>
<p>into a new kind of energy and ambition.</p>
<p>Were there moments when you were just like terrified</p>
<p>at the combination of loneliness?</p>
<p>And like, you know, the thing about COVID is like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some degree of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Like it feels like it&rsquo;s a new thing, a new monster</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s arrived on this earth.</p>
<p>And so, you know, dealing with it alone,</p>
<p>a lot of people are dying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like wondering like.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do wonder, I mean, for sure.</p>
<p>And then there are the even new strains in South Africa,</p>
<p>which is where I was.</p>
<p>And maybe the new strain had some interaction</p>
<p>with my genes and I&rsquo;m just gonna die.</p>
<p>But ultimately it was liberating somehow.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>Oh, I loved that I got out of it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because it also affects your mind.</p>
<p>You get confused, you get confusion</p>
<p>and kind of a lot of fatigue</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t do your usual tricks</p>
<p>of psyching yourself out of it.</p>
<p>So, you know, sometimes it&rsquo;s like, oh man, I feel tired.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m just gonna go have coffee and then I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, now it&rsquo;s like, I feel tired.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even wanna get out of bed to get coffee</p>
<p>because I feel so tired.</p>
<p>And then you have to confront,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no like quick fix cure and you&rsquo;re trapped at home.</p>
<p>But that, so now you have this little thing</p>
<p>that happened to you that was a reminder</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re mortal and you get to carry that flag</p>
<p>in trying to create something special in this world.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>With Numerai.</p>
<p>Listen, this was like one of my favorite conversation</p>
<p>because the way you think about this world of money</p>
<p>and just this world in general is so clear</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to explain it so eloquently.</p>
<p>Richard, that was really fun.</p>
