    <p>Slaves produce a surplus which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets.</p>
<p>Employees produce a surplus which the employer gets. It&rsquo;s very simple. These are exploitative</p>
<p>class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another</p>
<p>group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,</p>
<p>resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff, one of the top Marxist economists and</p>
<p>philosophers in the world. This is a heavy topic, in general and for me personally, given my family</p>
<p>history in the Soviet Union, in Russia, and in Ukraine. Today the words Marxism, Socialism,</p>
<p>and Communism are used to attack and to divide, much more than to understand and to learn.</p>
<p>With this podcast, I seek the latter. I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx,</p>
<p>as well as their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries.</p>
<p>And in general, we need to both steel man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize,</p>
<p>and to challenge the ideas we dogmatically accept as true, even when doing so is unpleasant,</p>
<p>and at times, dangerous. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our</p>
<p>sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Richard Wolff.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a basic question, but maybe not so basic after all. What is Marxism? What are the</p>
<p>defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and political theory and ideology?</p>
<p>Well, the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it&rsquo;s the tradition that takes its</p>
<p>founding inspiration from the works of Karl Marx. But because these ideas that he put forward</p>
<p>spread as fast as they did, and as globally as they did, literally it&rsquo;s 140 years,</p>
<p>140 years since Marx died. And in that time, his ideas have become major types of thinking</p>
<p>in every country on the earth. If you know much about the great ideas of human history,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time.</p>
<p>And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity, is that the Marxian</p>
<p>ideas interacted with very different cultural histories, religious histories, and economic</p>
<p>conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently in different places</p>
<p>at different times. And therefore, Marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality</p>
<p>of all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For the first roughly 40, 50 years,</p>
<p>Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism. Marx himself, that&rsquo;s all he</p>
<p>really did. He never wrote a book about communism. He never wrote a book really about socialism.</p>
<p>Either his comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed. What he was really interested in was</p>
<p>a critical analysis of capitalism. And that&rsquo;s what Marxism was, more or less, in its first 40 or 50</p>
<p>years. The only qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a few</p>
<p>weeks. In 1871, there was a collapse of the French government, consequent upon losing a war to Bismarck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Germany. And then the result was something called the Paris Commune. The working class of Paris</p>
<p>rose up, basically took over the function of running the Parisian economy and the Parisian</p>
<p>society. And Marx&rsquo;s people, people influenced by Marx, were very active in that commune,</p>
<p>in the leadership of the commune. And Marx wasn&rsquo;t that far away. He was in London.</p>
<p>These things were happening in Paris. That&rsquo;s an easy transport even then. And for a short time,</p>
<p>very short, Marxism had a different quality. In addition to being a critique of capitalism,</p>
<p>it became a theory of how to organize society differently. Before that had only been implicit.</p>
<p>Now it became explicit. What is the leadership of the Paris Commune going to do? And why? And</p>
<p>in what order? And in other words, governing, organizing a society. But since it only lasted</p>
<p>a few weeks, the French army regrouped. And under the leadership of people who were very opposed to</p>
<p>Marx, they marched back into Paris, took over, killed a large number of the communards, as they</p>
<p>were called, and deported them to islands in the Pacific that were part of the French empire at the</p>
<p>time. The really big change happens in Russia in 1917. Now you have a group of Marxists, Lenin,</p>
<p>Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position to seize a moment. Once again, a war,</p>
<p>like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into a very bad reputation</p>
<p>because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as you know,</p>
<p>Brest, Litovsk and all of that, and the government collapses and the army revolts.</p>
<p>And in that situation, a very small political party, Russian Social Democratic Workers Party,</p>
<p>splits, under the pressures of all of this, into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions. Lenin,</p>
<p>Trotsky and the others are in the Bolshevik division. And to make a long story short,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in exile. Lenin&rsquo;s position gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be</p>
<p>killing German workers. I mean, this is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into</p>
<p>colonies and Russian working people should not kill and should not die for such a thing. As you</p>
<p>can expect, they arrest him and they throw him out. Interestingly, in the United States, the</p>
<p>comparable leader at that time of the Socialist Party here, as you know, there was no Communist</p>
<p>Party at this point, that comes later. The head of the Socialist Party, a very important American</p>
<p>figure named Eugene Victor Debs, makes exactly the same argument that Americans should not fight in</p>
<p>the war. He has nothing to do with Lenin, I don&rsquo;t even know if they knew of each other, but he does</p>
<p>it on his own. He gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States. By the way, he runs for</p>
<p>president from jail and does very well, really very well, remarkable. And he&rsquo;s the inspiration</p>
<p>for Bernie Sanders, if you see the link, although he had much more courage politically than Bernie</p>
<p>has. That&rsquo;s really interesting. I&rsquo;d love to return to that link maybe later. History rhymes. Yes,</p>
<p>the complicated story. Anyway, the importance in terms of Marxism is that now this seizure of power</p>
<p>by a group of Marxists, that is a group of people inspired by Marx developing what you might call</p>
<p>a Russian, even though there were differences among the Russians too, but a Russian interpretation,</p>
<p>this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism into a plan, at least. What are you</p>
<p>going to do in the Soviet Union? And a lot of this was then trial and error. Marx never laid any of</p>
<p>this out. Probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been all that relevant if he had, because it was 50 years</p>
<p>earlier in another country, etc. So what begins to happen, and you can see how this happens then</p>
<p>more later in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on, is that you have kind of a bifurcation.</p>
<p>Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set,</p>
<p>and they differ from one to the other, a set of notions of what an alternative post capitalist</p>
<p>society ought to look like, how it ought to work. And there&rsquo;s lots of disagreement about it,</p>
<p>lots of confusion, and I would say that that&rsquo;s still where it is. You have a tradition now</p>
<p>that has these two major wings, critique of capitalism, notion of the alternative,</p>
<p>and then a variety of each of those, and that would be the framework in which I would answer,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what Marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society</p>
<p>can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try.</p>
<p>And then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back,</p>
<p>what do you think Marx would say if he just looked at the different implementations of the ideas that</p>
<p>Marxism throughout the 20th century, where his ideas that were implicit were made explicit?</p>
<p>Would he shake his head? Would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations? How do you think</p>
<p>he would analyze it?</p>
<p>Well, he had a great sense of humor. I don&rsquo;t know if he had a chance to take a look at his writing,</p>
<p>but he had an extraordinary sense of humorism. My guess is he would deploy his humor in answering</p>
<p>this question, too. He would say some of them are inspiring, some of his interpretations of his work,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s very pleased with those. Others are horrifying, and he wishes somehow he could</p>
<p>erase the connection between those things and the lineage they claim from him, which he would.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a German word‚ÄîI don&rsquo;t know if you speak the other languages‚Äîthere&rsquo;s a wonderful</p>
<p>German word called verzichte, and it&rsquo;s stronger than the word refuse. It&rsquo;s if you want to refuse</p>
<p>something, but with real strong emphasis. Verzichte darauf is a German way of saying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with that.</p>
<p>He would talk then in philosophical terms, because remember, he was a student of philosophy.</p>
<p>He wrote his doctoral thesis on ancient Greek philosophy and all the rest. He would wax</p>
<p>philosophical and say, you know, that the ideas you put out are a little bit like having a child.</p>
<p>You have a lot of influence, but the child is his own or her own person and will find his or</p>
<p>her own way, and these ideas, once they&rsquo;re out there, go their own way. And as you said, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a particular way that this idea spread, the speed at which it spread throughout the world made it</p>
<p>even less able to be sort of stabilized and connected back to the origins of where the idea</p>
<p>came from. The only people who ever really tried that were the Russians after the revolution,</p>
<p>because they occupied a position for a while, not very long, but they occupied a position for a</p>
<p>while in which, I mean, it was exalted, right? There had been all these people criticizing</p>
<p>capitalism for a long time, even the Marxists ever since mid century. And these were the first guys</p>
<p>who pulled it off. They made it. And so that there was a kind of presumption around the world,</p>
<p>their interpretation must be kind of the right one, because look, they did it. And so for a while,</p>
<p>they could enunciate their interpretation. And it came to be widely grasped as something which,</p>
<p>by the way, gets called in the literature, official Marxism, the very idea that you would</p>
<p>put that adjective in front of Marxism, or Soviet Marxism or Russian, there were these words that</p>
<p>where the adjective was meant to somehow say, kind of, this is the canon, you can depart from</p>
<p>it, but this is the canon. Before the Russian Revolution, there was no such thing. And by the</p>
<p>1960s, it was already, it was gone. But for a short time, 30, 40 years, it was a kind of,</p>
<p>and the irony is, particularly here in the United States, where the taboo against Marxism kicks in</p>
<p>right after World War II, is so total in this country, that I, for example, through most of</p>
<p>my adult life, have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time simply explaining to American</p>
<p>audiences that the Marxism they take as canonical is that old Soviet Marxism, which wasn&rsquo;t the canon</p>
<p>before 1917, and hasn&rsquo;t been since at least the 1960s. But they don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stupid, and it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re ignorant. It&rsquo;s that, well, ignorance may be, but I mean, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a mental problem. It&rsquo;s the taboo. Shut it down. And so all of the reopening that, in a way,</p>
<p>recaptures what went before and develops it in new direction, they just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>LW. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s a serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit. The Russians,</p>
<p>the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century, made a serious attempt at saying, okay, beyond the</p>
<p>critique of capitalism, how do we actually build a system like this? And so, in that sense,</p>
<p>not at a high level, but at a detailed level, it&rsquo;s interesting to look at those particular schools.</p>
<p>Maybe‚Ä¶ RL. Right, because, for example, let me just take your point one step further. You really</p>
<p>cannot understand the Cuban Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, Vietnamese, and the others,</p>
<p>because each of them is a kind of response, let&rsquo;s call it, to the way the Soviets did it.</p>
<p>Are you going to do it that way? Well, yes, and no is the answer. This we will do that way,</p>
<p>but that we&rsquo;re not going to do. And the differences are huge, but you could find a thread‚ÄîI can do</p>
<p>that for you if you want‚Äîin which all of them are, in a way, reacting. LW. To the originals.</p>
<p>RL. Yes, very much so. LW. Like maybe most of rock music is reacting to the Beatles and the Stones.</p>
<p>RL. Something like that. LW. Can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools</p>
<p>of that Soviet Marxism? So we got Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, maybe even let&rsquo;s expand</p>
<p>out to Maoism. So maybe I could speak to sort of Leninism, and then please tell me if I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>dumb things. I think for Lenin, there was an idea that there could be a small sort of vanguard party,</p>
<p>like a small controlling entity that&rsquo;s like wise and is able to do the central planning decisions.</p>
<p>Then for Stalinism, one interesting‚ÄîStalin&rsquo;s implementation of all of this‚Äîone interesting</p>
<p>characteristic is to move away from the international aspect of the ideal of Marxism to</p>
<p>make it all about nation, nationalism, the strength of nation. And then so Maoism is</p>
<p>different in that it&rsquo;s focused on agriculture and rural. And then Trotskyism, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>except that it&rsquo;s anti Stalin. I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know if there&rsquo;s unique sort of philosophical</p>
<p>elements there. Anyway, can you maybe from those or something else speak to different unique</p>
<p>elements that are interesting to think about implementation of Marxism in the real world?</p>
<p>Probably the best way to get into this is to describe something that happened in Marxism</p>
<p>that then shapes the answer to your question. In the early days of Marx&rsquo;s writings,</p>
<p>and you know, his life spans the 19th century. He&rsquo;s born in 1818, dies in 1883, so literally</p>
<p>he lives the 19th century. And to make things simple, you might look at the first half of the</p>
<p>first two thirds of his life as overwhelmingly gathering together the precursors to his own work.</p>
<p>Marx was unusually scholarly in the sense that partly because he didn&rsquo;t work a regular job,</p>
<p>and partly because he was an exile in London most of his adult life, he worked in the library. I</p>
<p>mean, he had a lot of time. He got subsidized a little bit by Engels, whose family were</p>
<p>manufacturers. And you might say the first half to two thirds of his life are about</p>
<p>the critique of capitalism. And that was what, in a broad sense, the audience for his work,</p>
<p>Western Europe more or less, was interested in. That&rsquo;s what they wanted. And he gave that to them.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t the only one, but he was very, very effective at it. By the last third of his life,</p>
<p>he and the other producers of an anti capitalist movement, people like the Chartists in England,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole other movement, the anarchists of various kinds, like Proudhon in France,</p>
<p>or Kropotkin or Bakunin in Russia, and so on. You pull all these together, and there was a shift</p>
<p>in what the audience, let&rsquo;s call it a mixture of militant working class people on the one hand,</p>
<p>and critical or radical intelligentsia on the other. They now wanted a different question.</p>
<p>They were persuaded by the analysis. They were agreeable that capitalism was a phase they would</p>
<p>like to do better than. And the question became, how do we do this? Not anymore, should we? Why</p>
<p>should we? Could we maybe fix capitalism? No, they had gotten to the point, the system has</p>
<p>to be fundamentally changed. But they didn&rsquo;t go, you might imagine, they didn&rsquo;t go and say, well,</p>
<p>what will that new system looks like? They didn&rsquo;t go that way. What they did was ask the question,</p>
<p>how could we get beyond capitalism? It seems so powerful. It seems to have captured people&rsquo;s minds,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s daily lives, and so on. And the focus of the conversation became, this was already</p>
<p>by the last third of the 19th century, the question of the agency, the mechanism whereby</p>
<p>we would get beyond. And again, make a long story short, the conversation focused on seizing the</p>
<p>government. Before that, the government was not a major interest. If you read Marx&rsquo;s Capital,</p>
<p>the great work of his maturity, three volumes, there&rsquo;s almost nothing in the state. He mentions</p>
<p>it, but he&rsquo;s interested in the details of how capitalism works, factory by factory, store by</p>
<p>store, office. What&rsquo;s the structure? The government&rsquo;s secondary for him. But there&rsquo;s also humans within</p>
<p>that capitalist system of, there&rsquo;s the working class. That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s interested in. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interested in each, think of it almost mechanically like the workplace. In the workplace there,</p>
<p>some people who do this and other people who do that, and they accept this division of authority,</p>
<p>and they accept this division of what&rsquo;s going on here, particularly because he believed that the</p>
<p>core economic objective of capitalism was to maximize something called profit, which his</p>
<p>analysis located right there in the workings of the enterprise. The government was not the</p>
<p>the key factor here. And he was looking at ideas of value. How much value does</p>
<p>the labor of the individual workers provide? And that means, how do we reward the workers in an</p>
<p>ethical way? And so those are the questions. But the government is not part of that picture.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very significant that towards the end of the 19th century, Marx is still alive when this</p>
<p>begins, but it really gets going after he dies, is this debate among Marxists about the role of</p>
<p>the state. They all agreed, nearly all of them agree, that you have to get the state. The working</p>
<p>class has to get the state because they see the state as the ultimate guarantor of capitalism.</p>
<p>When things get really out of hand, the capitalist calls the police or he calls the army or both of</p>
<p>them. And so the government is in a sense this key institution captured in Marxist language</p>
<p>by the bourgeoisie, by the other side, the capitalists, and yet vulnerable because of</p>
<p>suffrage. If suffrage is universal or nearly so, if everybody gets a vote, which in a way</p>
<p>capitalism brings to bear, part of its rejection of feudalism in the French American Revolution</p>
<p>is to create a place where elected represented. So the government being subject to suffrage</p>
<p>creates the notion, aha, here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re gonna, we have to seize the state. And then that gets</p>
<p>agreed upon, but there&rsquo;s a big split as to how to do it. One side says you go with the election,</p>
<p>you mobilize the voter. That gets to be called reformism within Marxism. And the other side</p>
<p>is revolution. Don&rsquo;t do that. This system, if I may quote Bernie again, is rigged. You can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get there. They&rsquo;ve long ago learned how to manipulate parliaments. They buy the politicians</p>
<p>and all that, and therefore revolution is going to be the way to do it. Revolution</p>
<p>gets a very big boost because the Russians, they did it that way. They didn&rsquo;t do, I mean,</p>
<p>they fought in the Duma, in the Parliament, but they didn&rsquo;t. And this focus on the state,</p>
<p>I would argue, goes way beyond what the debaters at the time, and if you&rsquo;re interested in the great</p>
<p>names, there was a great theorist of the role of the state in a reformist strategy to get power</p>
<p>in Germany named Edward Bernstein. Very important. His opponents in Germany were Karl Kautsky and</p>
<p>Rosa Luxemburg, the two other huge figures in Marxism at the time, and they wrote the articles</p>
<p>that everybody reads, but it was a much broader debate. By the way, that debate still goes on.</p>
<p>Reformism versus revolution?</p>
<p>WOLFF Mhm. And in terms of not all that different. I mean, it&rsquo;s adjusted to history, but</p>
<p>in terms of different.</p>
<p>SIMON Can you comment on where you lean in terms of</p>
<p>the mechanism of progress, reformation versus revolution?</p>
<p>WOLFF I&rsquo;d rather tell you the historical story.</p>
<p>SIMON Sure.</p>
<p>WOLFF Over and over and over again, in most cases,</p>
<p>the reformists have always won because revolution is frightening, is scary, is dangerous,</p>
<p>and so most of the time, when you get to the point where it&rsquo;s even a relevant discussion, not an</p>
<p>abstract thing for conferences, but a real strategic issue, the reformists have won.</p>
<p>I mean, and I&rsquo;ll give you an example from the United States. In the Great Depression of the</p>
<p>1930s, you had an extraordinary shift to the left in the United States, the greatest shift to the</p>
<p>United States, the greatest shift to the left in the country&rsquo;s history before or since, nothing</p>
<p>like it. Suddenly, you created a vast left wing composed of the labor movement, which went crazy</p>
<p>in the 1930s. We organized more people into unions in the 1930s than at any time before</p>
<p>or any time since. It is the explosion. And at the same time, the explosion of two socialist parties</p>
<p>and the Communist Party that became very powerful, and they all worked together, creating a very</p>
<p>powerful leftist presence in this country. They debated in a strategically real way reform or</p>
<p>revolution. The reformers were the union people, by and large, and the communists were the</p>
<p>revolutionaries, by and large, because they were affiliated with the Communist International,</p>
<p>with Russia and all of that. And in between, you might say, the two socialist parties,</p>
<p>one that was Trotskyist in inspiration and the other one more moderate Western European kind</p>
<p>of socialism. And they had this intense debate. And they ended up, the reformists won that debate.</p>
<p>There was no revolution in the 1930s here. But there was a reform that achieved unspeakably</p>
<p>great successes, which is why it was as strong and remains as strong as it does, because</p>
<p>it achieved in a few years, in the 1930s, starting around 1932,</p>
<p>three social security in this country. We had never had that before. That&rsquo;s the same one we</p>
<p>have now. Unemployment insurance never existed before that you have till today. Minimum wage</p>
<p>for the first time, still have that today. And a federal program of employment that hired 15</p>
<p>million people. I mean, these were unspeakable gifts, if you like, to the working class.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the 30s and the 40s.</p>
<p>30s. Not much in the 40s anymore, but in the 30s. And here&rsquo;s the best part. It was paid for by taxes</p>
<p>on corporations and the rich. So when people today say, well, you can tax the government,</p>
<p>the joke is I have to teach American history to Americans because it has been erased from</p>
<p>consciousness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to that. But first, let&rsquo;s take a stroll back to the beginning of the 20th century</p>
<p>with the Russians.</p>
<p>With the Russians. So their interpretation goes like this.</p>
<p>Everybody was right. The state is crucial. We were right. We were the revolutionaries.</p>
<p>We seized the state here in Russia. Now we have the state. And socialism</p>
<p>is when the working class captures the state, either by reform or revolution, and then uses</p>
<p>its power over the state to make the transition from capitalism to the better thing we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going toward. And again, make a long story short, in the interest of time, what happens,</p>
<p>which is not unusual in human history, is that the means becomes the end.</p>
<p>In other words, Lenin, who&rsquo;s crystal clear before he died, you know, he doesn&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>very long, he dies in 23. So he&rsquo;s only in power from 17 to 22. By that time, he has</p>
<p>his brain trouble.</p>
<p>1923, by the way, not at age 23.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. 1923. Yeah, he&rsquo;s only there for four or five years. He&rsquo;s very clear.</p>
<p>He even says, I&rsquo;ve done work on that, I&rsquo;ve published, so I know this stuff. He says in</p>
<p>a famous speech, let&rsquo;s not fool ourselves. We have captured the state, but we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have socialism. We have to create that. We have to move towards that.</p>
<p>With Stalin, you know, Lenin dies, and there&rsquo;s a fight between Stalin and Trotsky. Trotsky</p>
<p>loses the fight, he&rsquo;s exiled, he goes to Mexico. Stalin is now alone in power, does</p>
<p>all the things he&rsquo;s famous or infamous for. And by the end of the 20s, Stalin makes a</p>
<p>decision. I mean, not that he makes it alone, but things have evolved in Russia so that</p>
<p>they do the following. They declare that they are socialism. In other words, socialism becomes</p>
<p>when you capture the state. Not when the state capture has enabled you to do X, Y, Z, other</p>
<p>things. No, no. The state itself, once you have it, is socialism. So when a socialist</p>
<p>captures the state, that&rsquo;s socialism. Exactly. That&rsquo;s exactly right. I feel like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitionally confusing. Well, it shouldn&rsquo;t be, because I&rsquo;ll give you an example. If</p>
<p>you go to many parts of the United States today, and you ask people, what&rsquo;s socialism?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll look you right in the face and they&rsquo;ll say, the post office. When I first heard this</p>
<p>as a young man, I go, what? The post office. It took me a while to understand. The post</p>
<p>office, Amtrak, the Tennessee, all the examples in the United States where the government</p>
<p>runs something. This is socialism. See, capitalism is if the government doesn&rsquo;t run it. If a</p>
<p>private individual who&rsquo;s not a government official runs it, well, then it&rsquo;s capitalism.</p>
<p>If the government takes it, then it&rsquo;s socialism. So what is wrong with that reasoning? So the</p>
<p>idea, I think&hellip; There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it&rsquo;s a way of looking at the world. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>got nothing to do with Marx. Well, there&rsquo;s Marx, there&rsquo;s Marxism. Let&rsquo;s try to pull</p>
<p>this apart. So what role does central planning have in Marxism? So Marxism is concerned with</p>
<p>this class struggle, with respecting the working class. What is the connection between that</p>
<p>struggle and central planning that is often&hellip; Central planning is often associated with</p>
<p>Marxism. Right. So a centralized power doing&hellip; Russia did that. Allocation. So that has to</p>
<p>do with a very specific set of implementations initiated by the Soviet Union. Has nothing</p>
<p>to do with Marx. How else can you do&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think you can find anywhere in Marx&rsquo;s</p>
<p>writing anything about central planning or any other kind of planning. Again, fundamentally</p>
<p>then, Marx&rsquo;s work, it has to do with factories, with workers, with the bourgeoisie, and the</p>
<p>exploitation of the working class. Exactly. You still have to take that leap. What is</p>
<p>beyond capitalism? Right. So maybe we should turn to that, focus on that. Yes. Okay. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already looked historically at several attempts to go beyond capitalism. How else can we go</p>
<p>beyond capitalism? Right. Let me push a little further. They didn&rsquo;t succeed in my judgment</p>
<p>as a Marxist. And I&rsquo;m now gonna tell you why they didn&rsquo;t succeed, because they didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>as well as they could have or should have what Marxist was trying to do. I think I would</p>
<p>have been like them if I had lived at their time under their circumstances. This is not</p>
<p>a critique of them, but it&rsquo;s a different way of understanding what&rsquo;s going on. All right.</p>
<p>So give you an example. Most of my adult life I have taught Marxian economics. I&rsquo;m a professor</p>
<p>of economics. I&rsquo;ve been that all my life. I&rsquo;m a graduate of American universities. As</p>
<p>it happens, I&rsquo;m a graduate of what in this country passes for its best universities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another conversation you and I can have. So I went to Harvard, then I went to</p>
<p>Stanford, and I finished at Yale. I&rsquo;m like a poster boy for elite education. They tried</p>
<p>very hard. By the way, I spent 10 years of my life in the Ivy League, 20 semesters, one</p>
<p>after the other, no break. In those 20 semesters, 19 of them never mentioned a word about Marxism</p>
<p>that is no critique of capitalism was offered to me ever with one except one professor in</p>
<p>Stanford in the one semester I studied with him, he gave me plenty to read, but nobody</p>
<p>else. So that&rsquo;s really interesting. You&rsquo;ve mentioned that in the past, and that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>true, which makes you a very interesting figure to hold your ground intellectually through</p>
<p>this idea space where just people don&rsquo;t really even talk about it. Perhaps we can discuss</p>
<p>historically why that is, but nevertheless, that&rsquo;s the case. So Marxian economics, did</p>
<p>Karl Marx come up in conversation as a kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Dismissal. The best example, yeah, he came up only as an object of dismissal. To give</p>
<p>you an example, the major textbook in economics that I was taught with, and that was for many</p>
<p>years the canonical book, it isn&rsquo;t quite anymore, was a book authored by a professor of economics</p>
<p>at MIT named Paul Samuelson, and a whole generation or two were trained on his textbook.</p>
<p>If you open the cover of his textbook, he has a tree, and the tree is Adam Smith and</p>
<p>David Ricardo at the root, and then the different branches of it. He&rsquo;s trying to give you an</p>
<p>idea as a student of how the thing developed. And it&rsquo;s a tree, and everybody on it is a</p>
<p>bourgeois. And then there&rsquo;s this one little branch that goes off like this and sort of</p>
<p>starts heading back down. That&rsquo;s Karl Marx. In other words, he had to have it complete</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not a complete faker, but beyond that, no, there was no. Nothing in the book</p>
<p>gives you two paragraphs of an approach. But that&rsquo;s Cold War. I mean, that&rsquo;s really neither</p>
<p>here. That&rsquo;s the craziness. Yeah, that&rsquo;s the Cold War in this country. My professors</p>
<p>were afraid. Anyway, let me get to the core of it, what I think will help. Marx was interested</p>
<p>in the relationship of people in the process of production. He&rsquo;s interested in the factory,</p>
<p>the office, the store, what goes on, and by that he means what are the relationships among</p>
<p>the people that come together in a workplace. And what he analyzes is that there is something</p>
<p>going on there that has not been adequately understood and that has not been adequately</p>
<p>addressed as an object needing transformation. And what does he mean? The answer is exploitation,</p>
<p>which he defines mathematically in the following way. Whenever in a society, any society,</p>
<p>you organize people, adults, not the children, not the sick, but, you know, healthy adults,</p>
<p>in the following way, a big block of them, a clear majority, work. That is, they use their</p>
<p>brains and their muscles to transform nature. A tree into a chair, a sheep into a woolen sweater,</p>
<p>whatever. In every human community, Marx argues, there are the people who do that work,</p>
<p>but they always produce more chairs, more sweaters, more hamburgers than they themselves consume,</p>
<p>whatever their standard of living. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be low, can be medium, can be high,</p>
<p>but they always produce more than they themselves consume. That more, by the way, Marx, when he</p>
<p>writes this, uses the German word mehr, m e h r, which is the English equivalent of more. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>more. That more got badly translated into the word surplus. Shouldn&rsquo;t have been, but it was. By the</p>
<p>way, by German and English people doing the translations. What&rsquo;s the difference between</p>
<p>more and surplus? Is there a nuanced? Yeah, because surplus has a notion of its discretionary,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of extra. He&rsquo;s not making a judgment that it&rsquo;s extra. It&rsquo;s a simple math equation.</p>
<p>Yes, very simple. One minus the other. Yes, x minus y. That&rsquo;s right. x is the total output,</p>
<p>y is the consumption by the producer, therefore x minus y equals s, the surplus. Exactly. Now, Marx</p>
<p>argues, the minute you understand this, you will ask the following question. Who gets the surplus?</p>
<p>Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it? And Marx&rsquo;s answer</p>
<p>is, therein lies one of the great shapers of any society. How is that organized? For example,</p>
<p>who gets it? What are they asked, if anything, to do with it in exchange for getting it? What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their social role? For example, here we go now, if you get this and you get the core of it anyway,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t charge much, the workers themselves could get it. The workers themselves could get</p>
<p>it. That&rsquo;s the closest Marx comes to a definition of communism. Communism would be if the workers</p>
<p>who produce the surplus together decide what to do with it. So this has to do not just with who gets</p>
<p>it, but more importantly, who gets to decide who gets it. Well, who gets it and who gets to decide</p>
<p>what to do with it. Right. Because you can&rsquo;t decide it if you don&rsquo;t have disposition over it.</p>
<p>So this is the logic of the word sequence. It&rsquo;s produced. Marx uses the word appropriated. In</p>
<p>other words, whose property, who gets to decide, if you like, what happens. All that property ever</p>
<p>meant is who gets to decide and who&rsquo;s excluded. That&rsquo;s a clean definition of communism.</p>
<p>Right. By the way, it&rsquo;s not just clean. This is the only one.</p>
<p>So can we just linger on the definition of exploitation in that context?</p>
<p>Easy. It becomes very easy. Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that&rsquo;s produced</p>
<p>is taken and distributed by people other than those who produced it. Slaves produce a surplus</p>
<p>which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets. Employees produce a surplus</p>
<p>which the employer gets. It&rsquo;s very simple. These are exploitative class structures because one</p>
<p>class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another group of people, not the ones who</p>
<p>produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger, resentment, and all of the problems</p>
<p>you can lump under the heading class struggle. I use a metaphor, simple metaphorical story.</p>
<p>You have two children, let&rsquo;s assume, and you take them to Central Park a few blocks from here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice day and the children are playing and in comes one of those men with an ice cream truck</p>
<p>comes by. Dingalingalingaling, your children see the ice cream. Daddy, get me an ice cream. So you</p>
<p>walk over, you take some money, and you get two ice cream cones and you give them to one of the</p>
<p>children. The other one begins to scream and yell and howl, obviously. What&rsquo;s the issue? And you</p>
<p>realize you&rsquo;ve just made a terrible mistake. So you order the one you gave the two ice cream cones</p>
<p>to give one of those to your sister or your brother or whatever it is. And that&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>solve the problem. Until a psychologist comes along and says, you know, you didn&rsquo;t fix it by</p>
<p>what you just did. You should never have done that in the first place. My response, so you understand,</p>
<p>all of the efforts to deal with inequality in economic, political culture, these are all</p>
<p>giving the ice cream cone back to the kid. You should never do this in the first place.</p>
<p>LW. The reallocation of resources creates bitterness in the populace.</p>
<p>RL. Look at Arva. This country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I have never seen in my</p>
<p>life, and I&rsquo;ve lived here all my life, and I&rsquo;ve worked here all my life. It&rsquo;s tearing itself</p>
<p>apart, and it&rsquo;s tearing itself apart basically over the redivision, the redistribution of wealth,</p>
<p>having so badly distributed in the first place. But that&rsquo;s all in Marx. And notice as I explain</p>
<p>to you what is going on in this tension filled production scene in the office, the factory,</p>
<p>the store. I don&rsquo;t have to say a word about the government. I&rsquo;m not interested in the government.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s really a very secondary matter to this core question. And here comes the big point.</p>
<p>If you make a revolution and all you do is remove the private exploiter</p>
<p>and substitute a government official without changing the relationship,</p>
<p>you can call yourself a Marxist all day long, but you&rsquo;re not getting the point</p>
<p>of the Marxism. The point was not who the exploiter is, but the exploitation per se.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn&rsquo;t a group that makes all</p>
<p>the decisions and gets the surplus vis a vis another one that produces it. If you do that,</p>
<p>you will destroy the whole project. Not only will you not achieve what you set out to get,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll so misunderstand it that the Germans again have a phrase,</p>
<p>es geht schief. It goes crooked. It doesn&rsquo;t go right. The project gets off the rails because</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t understand either what its objective should have been, and therefore it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how and why it&rsquo;s missing its objective. It just knows that this is not what it had hoped</p>
<p>for. I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating questions here. So one is to what degree,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s human nature, to what degree does communism, a lack of exploitation of the working</p>
<p>class naturally emerge? If you leave two people together in a room and come back a year later,</p>
<p>if you leave five people together in a room, if you leave a hundred people and a thousand people,</p>
<p>it seems that humans form hierarchies naturally. So the clever, the charismatic,</p>
<p>the sexy, the muscular, the powerful, however you define that, starts becoming a leader and start to</p>
<p>do maybe exploitation in a nonnegative sense, a more generic sense, starts to become an employer,</p>
<p>not in a capitalist sense, but just as a human. Here, you go do this, and in exchange I will give</p>
<p>you this. Just becomes the leadership role, right? So the question is, yes, okay, it would be nice,</p>
<p>the idea sort of of communism would be nice to not steal from the world.</p>
<p>Nice in theory, but it doesn&rsquo;t work in practice because of human nature.</p>
<p>Because of human nature. That&rsquo;s, thank you. So what can we say about leveraging human nature</p>
<p>to achieve some of these ends? There&rsquo;s so many ways of responding,</p>
<p>in no particular order. Here are some of them. The history of the human race, as best I can tell,</p>
<p>is a history in which a succession of social forms, forms of society, arise,</p>
<p>and as they do, they rule out some kinds of human behavior on the grounds that they are socially</p>
<p>disruptive and unacceptable. The argument isn&rsquo;t really then, is there a need or an instinct,</p>
<p>is there some human nature that makes people want to do this? Well, whatever that is,</p>
<p>this has to be repressed or else we don&rsquo;t have a society. And Freud helps us to understand</p>
<p>that that repression is going on all the time and it has consequences. It&rsquo;s not a finished project,</p>
<p>you repress it, it&rsquo;s gone, it doesn&rsquo;t work like that. So for example, when you get a bunch of</p>
<p>people together at some point, they may develop animosities towards one another that lead them to</p>
<p>want the other person or persons to disappear, to be dead, to be gone. But we don&rsquo;t permit you to</p>
<p>do that. We just don&rsquo;t. Every economic system that has ever existed has included people who defend it</p>
<p>on the grounds that it is the only system consistent with human nature and that every</p>
<p>effort to go beyond it has to fail because it contradicts human nature. I can show you</p>
<p>endless documents of every tribal society I&rsquo;ve ever studied, every anthropological community that</p>
<p>has ever been studied, slavery wherever it&rsquo;s existed. I can show you endless documents in</p>
<p>which the defenders of those systems, not all of them of course, but many defenders used that</p>
<p>argument. To naturalize a system is a way to hold on to it, to prevent it from going,</p>
<p>to counter the argument that every system is born, every system evolves, and then every system dies.</p>
<p>And therefore capitalism, since it was born and since it&rsquo;s been developing, we all know what the</p>
<p>next stage of capitalism is. The burden is on the people who think it isn&rsquo;t going to die.</p>
<p>Okay, so it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re wrong, but what you&rsquo;re saying is if we look at history,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deeply suspicious of the argument this is going against human nature because we keep</p>
<p>using that for basically everything including toxic relationship, toxic systems, destructive</p>
<p>systems. That said, well, let me just ask a million different questions. So one, what about</p>
<p>the argument that sort of the employer, the capitalist takes on risk versus the employee</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just there doing the labor? The capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk. Are they not</p>
<p>in sort of aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort, hiring a lot of people?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t they taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure? So first of all, there&rsquo;s risk</p>
<p>almost in everything you undertake. Any project that begins now and ends in the future takes a</p>
<p>risk that between now and that future something&rsquo;s going to happen that makes it not work out. I mean,</p>
<p>I got into a cab before I came here today. In order to do this with you, I took a risk. The cab</p>
<p>could have been in an accident. The lightning could have hit us. A bear could have eaten my</p>
<p>left foot. Who the hell knows? But shouldn&rsquo;t I reward you for the risk you took? No, hold it</p>
<p>a second. Let&rsquo;s do this step by step. So everybody&rsquo;s taking a risk. I always found it wonderful.</p>
<p>You talk about risk and then you imagine it&rsquo;s only some of us who take a risk. Let&rsquo;s go with</p>
<p>the worker, with the capitalist. That worker, he moved his family from Michigan to Pennsylvania to</p>
<p>take that job. He made a decision to have children. They are teenagers. They&rsquo;re now in school at a</p>
<p>time when their friendships are crucial to their development. You&rsquo;re going to yank them out of the</p>
<p>school because his job is gone. He took an enormous risk to do that job every day, to forestall all</p>
<p>the other things he could have done. He was taking a risk that this job would be here tomorrow, next</p>
<p>month, next year. He bought a house, which Americans only do with mortgages, which means he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now stuck. He has to make a monthly payment. If you make a mistake, you capitalist. He&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to, you&rsquo;re a capitalist. You got a lot of money. Otherwise, you wouldn&rsquo;t be in that</p>
<p>position. You&rsquo;ve got a cushion. He doesn&rsquo;t. If you investigate, you&rsquo;ll see that in every business</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever been in. I&rsquo;ve been involved in a lot of them. So you think it&rsquo;s possible to actually</p>
<p>measure risk or is your basic argument is there&rsquo;s risk involved in a lot of both the working class</p>
<p>and the bourgeoisie, the capitalists. That&rsquo;s right. And the worker would never come and say,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s been taught right, I want this payment, a wage for the work I do.</p>
<p>And I want this page, this payment for the risk I take. Well, there&rsquo;s some level of communication</p>
<p>like that. You have acknowledgement of dangerous jobs, but that&rsquo;s probably built into the salary,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things. But you&rsquo;re not incorporating the full spectrum of risk.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t believe that. This country is now being literally transformed from below by an army of</p>
<p>workers who work at Amazon, fast food joints. You know what their complaint is? It&rsquo;s killing us.</p>
<p>We get paid shit and it&rsquo;s killing us. There is no relationship except in the minds of the defenders</p>
<p>of capitalism between the ugliness, the difficulty, the danger of labor on the one hand and the wage.</p>
<p>Let me give you just a couple of examples. This is my job. This is my life, what I do.</p>
<p>The median income of a child care worker in the United States right now, as we speak,</p>
<p>is $11.22 an hour median. So 50% make less, 50% make more. The median income for car park attendant</p>
<p>is several dollars per hour higher than that. What does the car park attendant do? He stares at your</p>
<p>car for many hours to make sure that nobody comes and grabs it. Maybe he parks it and he moves it</p>
<p>and he moves it around to get it in and out. By any measure that I know of that makes any rational</p>
<p>sense, being in charge of toddlers, two, three, four year olds who are at the key moment of</p>
<p>mental formation the first five years, to give that a lower salary than you give the guy who</p>
<p>watches your car. Come on, I know how to explain it. Gender explains all kinds of issues that the</p>
<p>car park people are males and the day the child care people are females. And that in our culture</p>
<p>is a very big marker of what, but the one who said only the economics professor, nobody else</p>
<p>says this stuff because in economics, I don&rsquo;t know if you were familiar with our profession, but</p>
<p>we have something which we call marginal product. This is a fantasy. I was a mathematician. Before</p>
<p>I became an economist, I loved mathematics. I specialized in mathematics. So I know mathematics</p>
<p>pretty well. What economists do is silly, is childish, but they think it&rsquo;s mathematics.</p>
<p>But think for a minute what it means to suggest that you can identify the marginal product</p>
<p>of a factor of production, like a worker. In the textbook when it&rsquo;s taught, I&rsquo;ve taught this stuff.</p>
<p>I hold my nose, but I teach it. Then I explain to students what I&rsquo;ve just taught you is</p>
<p>horse shit, but first I teach it. What is the marginal product if it might be useful?</p>
<p>The notion is if you take away one worker right now from the pile, what will be the diminution</p>
<p>of the output? That&rsquo;s the marginal product of that worker measured by the amount of the output</p>
<p>that diminishes output of the raw product of the product. Usually in real terms or physical,</p>
<p>not the value. You could do a value, but it&rsquo;s really more the physical you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>I mean, there is a transformation thing. I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about value. It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>What is value? I&rsquo;d be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that,</p>
<p>but I just want to get to this. Hegel, who was Marx&rsquo;s teacher, has a famous line.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t step in the same river twice. The argument is you and the river have changed</p>
<p>between the first and the second time. It&rsquo;s a different you and it&rsquo;s a different river.</p>
<p>You can choose not to pay attention to that. You can&rsquo;t claim you&rsquo;re not doing that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t claim that you can actually do that because you can&rsquo;t. There is no way to do that.</p>
<p>So the meaning that you can&rsquo;t just remove a worker and have a clean</p>
<p>mathematical calculation of the effect that it has on the output.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, because too many other things are going on, too many things are changing,</p>
<p>and you cannot assume, much as you want to, that the outcome on the output side is uniquely</p>
<p>determined by the change you made on the input side. You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Even in the average, it&rsquo;s not going to work out.</p>
<p>You can take, look, mathematics is full of abstractions. You can say, as we do in economics,</p>
<p>keteris paribus, everything else held constant, but you have to know what you just did. You know</p>
<p>why you do that? Because you can&rsquo;t do that in the real world. That&rsquo;s not possible. You better</p>
<p>account for that, otherwise you&rsquo;re mistaking the abstraction from the messy reality you abstracted</p>
<p>from to get the abstraction. As a quick tangent, if we somehow went through a thought experiment</p>
<p>or an actual experiment of removing every single economist from the world, would we be better off</p>
<p>or worse off? Much better off. Okay. Economics, and I&rsquo;m one, you know, I&rsquo;m talking about myself.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to ship all the economists to Mars and see how well it works off.</p>
<p>The serious part of this is that economics, it&rsquo;s really about capitalism. Economics as a</p>
<p>discipline is born with capital. There was no such thing. I teach courses at the university,</p>
<p>for example, called History of Economic Thought. I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato.</p>
<p>And I say, you know, they talked about really interesting things, but they never called it</p>
<p>economics. It made no sense to people to abstract something as central to daily life as economics</p>
<p>broadly defined. It made no sense. That&rsquo;s a creation much, much later. That&rsquo;s capitalism</p>
<p>that did that, created the field. So when I give them Plato and Aristotle, I have to give them</p>
<p>particular passages. By the way, footnote, because your audience will like it. Plato and Aristotle</p>
<p>talked about markets because they lived at a time in ancient Greece when market relations were</p>
<p>beginning to intrude upon these societies. So they were both interested in this phenomena,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not just producing goods and then distributing among us. We&rsquo;re doing it in a quid</p>
<p>pro quo. You know, I&rsquo;ll give you three oranges, you give me two shirts, a market exchange.</p>
<p>And both Aristotle and Plato hated markets, denounced them, and for the same reason,</p>
<p>they destroy social cohesion. They destroy community. They make some people rich and</p>
<p>other people poor, and they set us against each other, and it&rsquo;s terrible. And here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>that they agreed on that. Here&rsquo;s what they disagreed on. One of them said, okay, there</p>
<p>can be no markets. That was Plato. Aristotle comes back and says, no, no, no, no, no, too late for</p>
<p>that. The disruption caused in society by getting rid of this institution that has crawled in</p>
<p>amongst us would be too devastating. So we can&rsquo;t do that. But what we can do is control it, regulate</p>
<p>it, get from the market what it does reasonably well, and prevent it from doing the destructive</p>
<p>things it does so badly. So the fundamentally the destructive thing of a market is it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>engine of capitalism, so it creates exploitation of the worker. It facilitates it, and it is an</p>
<p>institution that Plato and Aristotle feel is a terrible danger to community. Which, by the way,</p>
<p>is a way of thinking about it that exists right now all over the world.</p>
<p>Look, the medieval Catholic Church had a doctrine, the prohibition of usury.</p>
<p>You know, and this was that God said, if there&rsquo;s a person who needs to borrow from you,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a person in need. And the good Christian thing to do is to help him. To demand</p>
<p>an interest payment rather than to help your fellow man is, God hates you for that. That&rsquo;s a sin.</p>
<p>Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes.</p>
<p>But would Jesus be crying when you try to scale that system? So that has to do with the</p>
<p>with the intimate human interaction. The idea of markets is you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to create a system that involves thousands, millions of humans, and there&rsquo;d be some level of</p>
<p>safe, self regulating fairness.</p>
<p>There might be, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that.</p>
<p>I wonder what, so I guess&hellip;</p>
<p>Suppose you were interested in having, suppose you took us your problem.</p>
<p>We have a set of funds that can be loaned out.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to consume it. They&rsquo;re ready to lend it. Okay. To whom should they lend it?</p>
<p>Well, we could say in our society, we&rsquo;re going to run this the way professors</p>
<p>in institutions like MIT work this. They write up a project. They send the project into some</p>
<p>government office where it is looked at against other projects. And this office in the government</p>
<p>decides we&rsquo;re going to fund this one and that one because they&rsquo;re more needed in our society.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we&rsquo;re going to lend</p>
<p>money to people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going to, but instead what we do is, who can pay the highest interest rate?</p>
<p>Whoa, what are you doing? What ethics would justify you doing? It&rsquo;s like a market in general.</p>
<p>Something is in shortage. All markets are about how to handle shortage. That&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>basic way to understand it. And so if the demand is greater than the supply, which is all the word</p>
<p>shortage means, has no other meaning, if the demand is greater than the supply, okay, now you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>a problem. You can&rsquo;t satisfy all the demanders because you don&rsquo;t have enough supply. You have</p>
<p>a shortage. Okay, now how are you going to do it? In a market, you allow people who have a lot of</p>
<p>money to bid up the price of whatever&rsquo;s short, and that solves your problem because as the price goes</p>
<p>up, the poor people, they drop out. They can&rsquo;t buy the thing at the exalted price, so you&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>way of distributing the shortage. It goes to the people with the most money. At this point, most</p>
<p>human beings confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it because it</p>
<p>contradicts their Christian, Judaic, Islamic, all of them would say, what? You know what that means?</p>
<p>It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk and give it to their cat, while the poor</p>
<p>person has no milk for their five children. There it is. You want a market? Why?</p>
<p>The fundamental thing that seems unfair, there&rsquo;s the resulting inequality. Now&hellip;</p>
<p>Or death.</p>
<p>Or death. Well, that&rsquo;s the ultimate inequality.</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>What about, and we&rsquo;re going to jump around from the philosophical, from the economics,</p>
<p>to the sort of debate type of thing. What about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats?</p>
<p>Meaning, if we look at the 20th century, a lot of people, maybe you disagree with this,</p>
<p>but they attribute a lot of the innovation and the average improvement in the quality of life</p>
<p>to capitalism, to inventions and innovation, to engineering and science developments</p>
<p>that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces. So, not looking at the individual</p>
<p>unfairness of exploitation as it&rsquo;s specifically defined, but just observing historically.</p>
<p>Looking at the 20th century, we came up with a lot of cool stuff that seemed to have made life</p>
<p>easier and better on average. What do you say to that?</p>
<p>I have several responses to that, but I do disagree pretty fundamentally with what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on there. But let me give you the arguments so that you can hear them,</p>
<p>and then you can evaluate them, as can anybody who&rsquo;s listening or watching.</p>
<p>Marx was a student of Hegel, and one of Hegel&rsquo;s central arguments was that everything that</p>
<p>exists exists, quote, in contradiction. In simple English, there&rsquo;s a good and bad side,</p>
<p>if you like, to everything. And you won&rsquo;t understand it unless you accept that proposition</p>
<p>and start looking for the good things that are the other side of the bad ones, and the bad things</p>
<p>that are the other side of the good ones, etc. So, the dialectic. Yes, exactly. And Marx,</p>
<p>very attentive to that, explicitly agrees with this on many occasions, and applies it,</p>
<p>of course, to the central object of his research, capitalism. So, this is not a simple minded fellow</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s telling you all the bad things about capitalism as if there were nothing that this</p>
<p>system achieved or accomplished. And one of the things he celebrates a lot is the technological</p>
<p>dynamism of the system, which Marx takes to be profound, because, you know, he lived at the time</p>
<p>when major breakthroughs in textile technology and mining and chemistry and so on were achieved.</p>
<p>But as to the notion that capitalism is therefore responsible for the improvement in</p>
<p>the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people, Marx now comes back and says,</p>
<p>oh wait, wait a minute here. Number one, capitalism as a system has been mostly represented by</p>
<p>capitalists, which makes a certain sense. And those capitalists, with very few exceptions,</p>
<p>some but very few, have fought against every effort to improve the lives of the mass of people.</p>
<p>The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs. What that means is replace a worker with</p>
<p>a machine, move the production from expensive U.S. to cheap China, bring in desperate immigrants from</p>
<p>other parts of the world, because they will work for less money than the folks that you have here</p>
<p>at home. Every measure to help the standard of living of American workers had to be fought for,</p>
<p>had to be fought for, for decades over the opposition of capitalists from the beginning</p>
<p>to right now. The reason we have a minimum wage, which was passed in the middle of the 1930s,</p>
<p>when it was proposed, it was blocked by capitalists. They got together. And today,</p>
<p>just a factoid for you, the last time the minimum wage was raised in the United States,</p>
<p>federal minimum wage, was in 2009, when it was set at the lofty sum of $7.25 an hour,</p>
<p>which you cannot live on. Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it is now, 11, 12, 13 years</p>
<p>since then, we have had an increase in the price level in this country every year. And in the last</p>
<p>year, 8.5%. During that time that the prices went up, the minimum wage was never raised.</p>
<p>What? This is a time of stock market boom, of growing inequality. This is the nerve of the</p>
<p>defender of capitalists, who wants now to get credit for the improvement in the standard of</p>
<p>life of the workers that was fought by every generation. You know, it takes your breath away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an argument. Whoa. But I take my hat off if I had one, because that is one of the only ways</p>
<p>to justify this system. Long ago‚Äîlet me get to the heart of it‚Äîlong ago, capitalism could have</p>
<p>overcome hunger, could have overcome disease, could have, I mean, way beyond what we have now,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t. And that&rsquo;s the worst moral condemnation imaginable. How do you justify</p>
<p>that when you could, you didn&rsquo;t? Look, let me get at it another way, because this may</p>
<p>interest you anyway. The issue is not that capitalism isn&rsquo;t technologically dynamic.</p>
<p>It is. And along the way, it has developed things that have helped people&rsquo;s lives get better. No</p>
<p>question. But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built</p>
<p>into capitalism is factually nuts and is such an outrageous‚Äîand I can give you a‚Äîbecause</p>
<p>you do math, you&rsquo;ll understand it. Think of it this way. Imagine a production process in which</p>
<p>you have $100 that the capitalist has to lay out for tools, equipment, and raw materials,</p>
<p>and $100 that he has to lay out for workers, hire the workers. And he puts them all together,</p>
<p>and he has an output. And let&rsquo;s say the output is 100 units of something, or whatever the price is,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s his revenue. And when he takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the revenue is‚Äîit doesn&rsquo;t really matter‚Äîit&rsquo;s $120, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>And he takes $100 of it and replaces the tools, equipment, and raw materials he used up,</p>
<p>another $100 to hire the workers for the next shift, and the other $20 is his profit,</p>
<p>and he puts that aside. Now along comes a technological breakthrough,</p>
<p>a machine, a new machine. And the new machine is so effective,</p>
<p>you can get the same number of units of output with half the workers. So you don&rsquo;t need to spend</p>
<p>$100 on workers. You only need to spend $50. You can do it with half the workers. And so the</p>
<p>capitalist goes to the workers‚Äîby the way, this happens every day‚Äîand he says to half of them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fired. Don&rsquo;t come back Monday morning. I don&rsquo;t need you. It&rsquo;s nothing personal. I got a</p>
<p>machine. Why does he do that? Because of the $50 he now no longer has to spend on labor, because</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t need half of them. He keeps. Everything else is the same. The machine, everything else is</p>
<p>just to make the math easy. So he keeps as his own profit the $50 that before he paid for those</p>
<p>workers. Because when he sells it for $220, that $50 he doesn&rsquo;t have to give to the next</p>
<p>job because he has a new machine. So that&rsquo;s what he does. The technology leads. He&rsquo;s happy. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>become more profitable. He&rsquo;s got an extra $50, which is why he buys the machine. The workers</p>
<p>are screwed. Half of them just lost their job, have to go home to their husband and wife,</p>
<p>tell them I don&rsquo;t have a job anymore. I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. The guy was nice enough to</p>
<p>say it was nothing wrong with me, but he doesn&rsquo;t need it. So I&rsquo;m completely screwed here. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what I&rsquo;m going to do about the debts we have, the house on mortgage, my children&rsquo;s education,</p>
<p>or whatever else he&rsquo;s got going for himself. Now the point. There was, of course, an alternative</p>
<p>path. The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers, pay them exactly the same that</p>
<p>you did before, for half a day&rsquo;s work. You would have got the same output, same revenue, same</p>
<p>profit as before. But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of freedom every day</p>
<p>of the lives of these workers. The majority of workers would have been really helped by this</p>
<p>technology. But instead they were screwed so that one guy, the employer, could make a big bundle of</p>
<p>more money. You want to support a system like this? Well, to go back to Hegel, the good and the bad.</p>
<p>So you just listed the bad and you also first listed the good, the technological innovation</p>
<p>of this kind of system. The question is the alternative, whatever, as we try to sneak up to</p>
<p>ideas of what the alternative might look like, what are the good and the bad of the alternative?</p>
<p>So you just kind of, as a opposite, by contrast, showed that, well, a nice alternative is you work</p>
<p>less, get paid the same, you have more leisure time, opportunity to pursue other interests,</p>
<p>the creative interests, family, flourish as a human being, basically strengthen and embolden</p>
<p>the basic humanity that&rsquo;s under all of us. Yes. But then what cost does that have on the deadline</p>
<p>fueled, competition fueled machine of technological innovation that is the positive side of capitalism?</p>
<p>Slows it down.</p>
<p>It slows it down. And the question is which is more important for the flourishing of humanity?</p>
<p>I agree with that. And I&rsquo;d love there to be a democratic mechanism. So let&rsquo;s discuss it,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s debate it, and then let&rsquo;s decide what mixture, because it&rsquo;s not either or,</p>
<p>the math problem I gave you is either or, we could mix it. You could have a third less of a working</p>
<p>day instead of a half less, and then the other part would be extra profit for our employer,</p>
<p>etc. etc. So let&rsquo;s have a democratic discussion of what is the mix between the positive, and we have</p>
<p>no such thing. All of this is decided by one side in this debate, which not only, we know what they</p>
<p>do, they always choose the one that maximizes their profit because that&rsquo;s what they were told</p>
<p>to do in business school where I&rsquo;ve taught. So not only is it an undemocratic decision,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s lopsided to boot. So we don&rsquo;t have the opportunity, but I would love for us to be good</p>
<p>Hegelian Marxists and say, let&rsquo;s take a look at the plus and the minus and make the best decision</p>
<p>that we can. We&rsquo;ll make mistakes, but we&rsquo;ll all make them together. It won&rsquo;t be one of us making</p>
<p>a dictatorial decision. You know, Marx developed the notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat,</p>
<p>not as a notion of how government works, but as a notion of what the practical reality is.</p>
<p>The dictatorship in these key decisions is not made by some sitting council, it&rsquo;s made by each</p>
<p>little capitalist in his or her relationships with the workers in the workplace, which is why Marx</p>
<p>focused his analysis on that point. And by the way, I can sketch for you right now so it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>lurk in the background what the alternative is. Let&rsquo;s go there. Okay. It goes right back to what</p>
<p>I said earlier. The workers themselves, the collection of employees together appropriate</p>
<p>their own surplus and decide democratically what to do with it, which includes the decision of</p>
<p>whether or not to buy a machine and whether or not to use the machine and the savings it might allow</p>
<p>to be handled by more leisure for themselves or as a fund for new developments in technology or</p>
<p>new products or whatever they want. And you know, this is an old idea in humans. Marx loved that.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his life, he started reading extensively in anthropology. And one of the</p>
<p>reasons he did that toward the end of his life was because he kept discovering that in this</p>
<p>society and that one, including here in the United States, that there were examples of people who</p>
<p>organized their production in precisely this way, as a collective democratic community in which</p>
<p>everybody had an equal voice. So we all together decide democratically what to produce, how to</p>
<p>produce, where to produce, and what to do with the output we all help to produce. So let&rsquo;s do it in,</p>
<p>you know, in this country where democracy is a value nearly everybody subscribes to.</p>
<p>Think about it this way, the stunning contradiction that there is a place in our society</p>
<p>where democracy has never been allowed to enter. The workplace. In the workplace, a tiny group of</p>
<p>people, unaccountable to the rest of us, the employer, whether that&rsquo;s an individual, a family,</p>
<p>a partnership, or a corporate board of directors, tiny group of people controls economically a vast</p>
<p>mass of employees. Those employees don&rsquo;t elect those people, have no nothing. There is no</p>
<p>accountability. It is the most undemocratic arrangement imaginable. And this society</p>
<p>insists on calling itself democratic when it has organized the minor matter of producing</p>
<p>everything in a way that is the direct, it&rsquo;s autocratic. So to push back on a few things.</p>
<p>So one is the idea of this society calling itself democratic is that the government is elected</p>
<p>democratically and the government is able to pressure the workplace through the process of</p>
<p>regulation. You pass laws of the boundaries of how, you know, minimum wage, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one idea. The other is there is a natural force within the capitalist when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no monopolies of competition being the accountability. So if you&rsquo;re a shitty boss,</p>
<p>the employee in the capitalist system has the freedom to move to another company, work for a</p>
<p>better boss. So that creates pressure on the employers and the bosses. That&rsquo;s at least the idea</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s two boundaries of you not misbehaving. One is the law, so regulations</p>
<p>passed by the government, democratic. And the second is because there&rsquo;s always alternatives,</p>
<p>in theory, then that puts pressure on everyone to behave well because you can always leave.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that&rsquo;s kinds of accountability. But what you&rsquo;re saying is that does not result</p>
<p>in a significant enough accountability for the employer that avoids exploitation of the worker.</p>
<p>WOLFF Absolutely. I mean, whatever accountability you get in those mechanisms. And let me respond</p>
<p>to that and then I&rsquo;ll counterargument. First, competition. Here again, we have to be Hegelians</p>
<p>just a little. Competition destroys itself. It doesn&rsquo;t need any‚Äîthe whole point of competition</p>
<p>is to beat the other guy. If I can produce the same product as the other guy, either a better</p>
<p>quality or a lower price or maybe both, then I win because the customers will come to me</p>
<p>because my price is lower or my quality is better, and they&rsquo;ll leave the other guy,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll go out of business. Now, let&rsquo;s follow. When he goes out of business, because I&rsquo;ve won</p>
<p>the competition, he fires his workers. I hire them because I&rsquo;m now going to be able to serve a market</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t serve anymore. So I&rsquo;m going to buy the used equipment, and thereby many become few.</p>
<p>Monopoly is the product of competition. It&rsquo;s not the antithesis, it&rsquo;s the product.</p>
<p>LAROI Well, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>WOLFF That&rsquo;s where it comes from.</p>
<p>LAROI There&rsquo;s another element to the system where there&rsquo;s always a new guy that comes in.</p>
<p>WOLFF There isn&rsquo;t. There isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>LAROI Well, that&rsquo;s the dream. The entrepreneurial spirit of the United States,</p>
<p>for example, of a capitalist system is you can be broke and one day have a strong idea and build</p>
<p>up a business that takes on Google and Facebook and Twitter and all the different car, Ford, GM,</p>
<p>which is what you look at Tesla, for example. That&rsquo;s the American dream. One of the many</p>
<p>ideals of the American dream is you can move from dirt poor to being the richest person in the world.</p>
<p>WOLFF Right.</p>
<p>LAROI It can happen.</p>
<p>WOLFF It can happen.</p>
<p>WOLFF You know what that&rsquo;s like? That&rsquo;s like you can win a lottery.</p>
<p>LAROI No, that&rsquo;s not quite. No, the lottery is complete luck. Here,</p>
<p>you can work your ass off if you have a good idea.</p>
<p>WOLFF The odds are better in the lottery.</p>
<p>LAROI That&rsquo;s not true. There&rsquo;s a lot of new businesses.</p>
<p>WOLFF How many Teslas do you know?</p>
<p>LAROI Tesla is a really bad example because the car</p>
<p>company, the automotive sector is so difficult. They operate at such a thin margin of profit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably a good example of capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of</p>
<p>lack of innovation. That&rsquo;s a very complicated industry because of the supply chain.</p>
<p>WOLFF Come on. They have their uniqueness as you&rsquo;re quite right, but so does every other</p>
<p>industry. The one thing that&rsquo;s common is that many become few. What you can also have is when you</p>
<p>have a few, they jack up the price. They make an enormous profit. In the irony of capitalism,</p>
<p>Marx would love this, they begin to incentivize people to break into this industry because the</p>
<p>few remaining are making a wild amount of profit because they are a few and can jigger the market</p>
<p>to make it work like that for them. The reason every small capitalist is trying to build market</p>
<p>share‚Äîthat&rsquo;s a polite way of saying they want to become a monopolist or to be more exact,</p>
<p>an oligopolist, one of a handful of firms that dominates. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re there for.</p>
<p>PEDRO But yeah, to push back a little bit also, because this is a question also,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;re in danger of oversimplifying capitalism that completely removes the basic</p>
<p>decency of human beings? If you give me a choice to press a button to get rid of the competition,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s going to lead to a lot of suffering, there&rsquo;s a lot of people at the heads of companies</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t press that button. That it&rsquo;s not in the calculation, it&rsquo;s not just money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s human well being too. So like‚Äî</p>
<p>PEDRO You think?</p>
<p>PEDRO Yes.</p>
<p>PEDRO You and I don&rsquo;t live in the same place then.</p>
<p>PEDRO So you&rsquo;re saying that the forces of capitalism</p>
<p>take over the minds of the people at the top, and then they cease being human.</p>
<p>PEDRO No.</p>
<p>PEDRO Depending on your model of humans.</p>
<p>PEDRO Yeah.</p>
<p>PEDRO They lose track of the better angels of their nature,</p>
<p>and they just become cogs in the machine, but they just happen to be the cock at the top.</p>
<p>PEDRO I would put it differently. The system is so set up, it&rsquo;s a little bit like natural</p>
<p>selection. The guys who may‚ÄîI could say the women too, it doesn&rsquo;t matter‚Äîthe people who make it up</p>
<p>through the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these things have had to do things along</p>
<p>the way that become selective. If they can&rsquo;t stand it because they have that human quality‚Äîand there</p>
<p>are people, I&rsquo;ve known them‚Äîthey&rsquo;re the ones running an Airbnb in Vermont. They went there and</p>
<p>they said, I&rsquo;m not doing this anymore. I&rsquo;m not going to treat people like that. I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever, and I&rsquo;m going to be enjoying</p>
<p>the people that come by and be a decent‚Äîof course, of course. But the system selects the firm. If you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do what has to be done to make the profit go up, you&rsquo;re toast there anyway. The rest of the</p>
<p>people who vote for you are going to kick you out. You can tell them all day long what a lovely</p>
<p>person you are. Then they&rsquo;re going to look at you and wonder what happened to you. How did you even</p>
<p>get this far with the lovely person horseshoe? RL It&rsquo;s not necessarily just a lovely person.</p>
<p>So maybe my‚ÄîI&rsquo;ll just say my bias is the people I know are, especially at the top of companies,</p>
<p>are in the tech sector where innovation is such a big part of it. So I think a lot of the things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about is when there&rsquo;s not much innovation in the system. So‚Äî</p>
<p>RL Innovation usually comes‚Äîin the history of capitalism, innovation comes in spurts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the electric period, the chemistry period, the nuclear period. There&rsquo;s now whatever you want</p>
<p>to call it, the artificial intelligence or robotics or computer. It comes, and then there&rsquo;s a flurry</p>
<p>as everything is reorganized around whatever the newest technology is, and then you have a period</p>
<p>where you can get excited about that, and the very rich people who come to the top can talk endlessly,</p>
<p>as they always do, about innovation. But again, it really is‚Äîthis is a recurring kind of debate and</p>
<p>a recurring kind of issue. For me‚Äîhow do I put this in a way that‚Äîno, I don&rsquo;t mean to offend.</p>
<p>RL Please, please. RL No, no, no, I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to, but</p>
<p>the problem with capitalism is‚Äîand maybe you&rsquo;ll like this‚Äîthe problem with capitalism is</p>
<p>not that it is the one thing that&rsquo;s consistent with human nature. That&rsquo;s what its defenders</p>
<p>would like to have us believe. But if anything, I would argue the opposite,</p>
<p>that it is such a contradiction to parts of our nature, not other parts, that it can never quite</p>
<p>make it. There&rsquo;s always going to be the people who don&rsquo;t go along with it, people you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about, who do quit along the way, or maybe a few of them actually make it to the top by god knows</p>
<p>what hook or what crook that they did it. But most of them go‚Äîand you know why? Because their</p>
<p>humanity is contradicted by what it is they&rsquo;re being asked to do. I mean, the corporate sector</p>
<p>this year‚Äîjust to give you an idea‚ÄîCEOs are jacking up their wage package. They&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>out of whack. I mean, the average CEO pay is now three, three hundred times what the average worker</p>
<p>pay is. But they&rsquo;re jacking it up even more. Why? Because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in their universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what‚Äîthey&rsquo;re all doing it, and they have to do‚Äîeach one of them justifies that,</p>
<p>I have to do that, otherwise I&rsquo;d lose my guy to the next one. Which, of course, is true,</p>
<p>but is no comfort for the mass of people who aren&rsquo;t CEOs, for whom this argument isn&rsquo;t very</p>
<p>exciting. So they&rsquo;re doing that at a time when the American people can&rsquo;t cope. They&rsquo;ve just gone</p>
<p>through the COVID disaster. They&rsquo;ve gone through the second worst economic crash of capitalism</p>
<p>in our history. After two years of this one, two punch, they got an inflation, a third punch,</p>
<p>and we are now predicting rising interest rates and a recession at the end of the year</p>
<p>or early next year. You can&rsquo;t do this to a working class. When this was done to the</p>
<p>German working class in the 1920s, Hitler was the result. You keep doing that in this country,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already watching it, you&rsquo;re going to get that too. You&rsquo;re already getting bits and pieces.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t keep doing it. So there&rsquo;s a quiet suffering amidst the working class that&rsquo;s growing.</p>
<p>Horror. Taking out on‚Äî</p>
<p>That can turn to anger. Some little 18 year old kid who has to go</p>
<p>three hours in his car and blow away people in a supermarket. Huh? What? And it happens</p>
<p>every day in this country. Every day.</p>
<p>So that anger rises up in those little ways now and then bigger and bigger potentially.</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s one more thing on the rationality. And this goes to Elon Musk.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, 49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year. The number</p>
<p>was just released yesterday. 49,000. Automobiles are the single largest pollutant in the country.</p>
<p>They use up an enormous amount of energy. They use up enormous amount of resources.</p>
<p>There is a way to make transportation much more rational. And we&rsquo;ve known it for decades. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called mass transportation. It&rsquo;s a really beautifully maintained, crystal clear, clean,</p>
<p>frequent system of buses, trains, street trolleys, vans. It could easily be done in this society.</p>
<p>In fact, I once did a project that I estimated cost $30 billion. That&rsquo;s less than we&rsquo;re sending</p>
<p>to Ukraine to do this, to reconfigure it.</p>
<p>A public transit system where?</p>
<p>Everywhere in this country. All the major metropolitan. This country&rsquo;s overwhelmingly</p>
<p>metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Well, it clearly has to be more than 30 billion, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, it was a few years ago.</p>
<p>Sure. But you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s a little bit more than 30 billion.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m using a lot of this. Right. It&rsquo;s not crazy stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reasonable number.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, but there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me just finish the point.</p>
<p>Sure. Yes.</p>
<p>Okay. So I&rsquo;m trying to be rational here. If we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s got a lot to do with fossil fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do, and with the use</p>
<p>of the fossil fuel, particularly for the automobile, then the solution to the problem would be mass</p>
<p>transit. We&rsquo;re doing nothing to make that happen. Nothing.</p>
<p>Well, you could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public transit because it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>reusable vehicles. It will end, in theory, car ownership. So you just have a more kind of</p>
<p>distributed public transit system.</p>
<p>If it happens, but you know that that&rsquo;s a side effect. His major goal and the major goal of the</p>
<p>other companies that are busy squeezing to get his share of the pie smaller, so they have some,</p>
<p>Ford, General Motors, Toyota, all of them are making electric cars now. So what they&rsquo;ve done is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another individual car.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fucking nuts. What are you doing?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one of the things they&rsquo;re doing, but automation is also another one. But on the Elon</p>
<p>side, there&rsquo;s also a hilarious thing named Boring Company, which is working on tunnels, which is</p>
<p>actually expanding the flexibility you might have to start playing with ideas of public transit,</p>
<p>I think. Listen, I&rsquo;m now partially living in Austin, Texas, that I don&rsquo;t know if they know</p>
<p>what a public transit system is, period.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s F150 pickup trucks.</p>
<p>Most American cities are.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, this is an interesting, so.</p>
<p>The older, by the way, footnote, the older this city, the more likely it has public transportation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Boston is the best example.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Have you been, well, you.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I have a place in Boston.</p>
<p>Boston with the street railway, Boston is your case study of how to do this,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been doing it all along. New York&rsquo;s pretty good, too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tradeoff. Yeah, New York, I would say, is better than Boston because</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s, you know, their technology also helps you out to do the public transit better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like Boston is a little too old, but yes, I get your point.</p>
<p>But there is a, the Ford F150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America,</p>
<p>and there is a practical nature to the fact that in order to do public transit,</p>
<p>in order to do some of these things that you&rsquo;re talking about with the working class,</p>
<p>there has to be a central planning component, or there has to be a centralized component.</p>
<p>And America is very much based on the idea of, at least in recent times,</p>
<p>I would say from the founding, of individualism, of respecting individual freedom.</p>
<p>Are you worried that in order to bring some of these ideas of Marxism to life,</p>
<p>you would trample on individual freedoms?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Can you respect both?</p>
<p>Sure. For me, Marxism is a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people</p>
<p>who have had that freedom eroded under the capitalist. That&rsquo;s a motive for my Marxism.</p>
<p>It was for Marx too. He loved the French Revolution. He loved the libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©,</p>
<p>the great three, and then democracy, the American contribution, if you like.</p>
<p>He believed in all of that. His critique of capitalism was, it promised it,</p>
<p>and then never delivered it. And the reason you have to go beyond it is because</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t deliver what it had promised. So for me, it is the fulfillment of agenda.</p>
<p>But again, I&rsquo;m a Hegelian Marxist, if you want. Individualism, for me, is not the way it&rsquo;s set</p>
<p>up in this society, some sort of antithesis to the government. I think an immense con has been</p>
<p>pulled on the American people. And the con works like this. You know what&rsquo;s bad and what&rsquo;s dangerous</p>
<p>and threatens you? It&rsquo;s the government. The government&rsquo;s going to come in and tell you</p>
<p>what to do. The government&rsquo;s going to run your life. The government&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>There really is no other way to explain the following in American politics.</p>
<p>Large numbers of people lose their homes in a downturn, like the so called Great</p>
<p>Recession of 2008. Who do they blame? The government. Large numbers of people go unemployed,</p>
<p>and what is the media all about? The government. If I were a capitalist, I&rsquo;d love this. I kick the</p>
<p>workers by throwing them out of their home, and they don&rsquo;t get angry at me. They get angry at the</p>
<p>government. I fire large numbers of people. I have no responsibility for what happens to them as a</p>
<p>result of having no job and no income. And they get angry at the senator. I&rsquo;m laughing all the way</p>
<p>to the bank. This is a genius stroke. In theory. But if you look at government, because you said</p>
<p>accountability in the capitalist system has no accountability. There&rsquo;s some pushback I give on</p>
<p>the accountability. I think there is some accountability we can discuss in a Hegelian way.</p>
<p>Who there&rsquo;s more accountability for. I would say that in theory, government is perfectly</p>
<p>accountable. That&rsquo;s the whole point of a democratic system is you vote people in. In practice,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a giant growing bureaucracy that is accountable only on the surface. There&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>parties that seem to be the same. Media somehow integrated into making the same two parties that</p>
<p>are just wearing different colored shirts to seem like they&rsquo;re very opposed and are arguing and</p>
<p>bitterly arguing and calling each other&rsquo;s nasty names and all those kinds of things. But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>government. So who exactly is worse here? Government or companies? Well, why are we asking</p>
<p>that question? These are twins. Look, what you were able to say about Republicans and Democrats</p>
<p>just now, with which I agree. I would say the same thing about corporations and the government.</p>
<p>This is the same people. Literally. Let&rsquo;s go to Churchill. Which one is worse? Let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Churchill. Democracy is the worst form of government except all the other ones or whatever.</p>
<p>So this kind of same idea. Which one exactly is worse? Because to me, it seems like&hellip;</p>
<p>Which one between what and what?</p>
<p>Government and industry and companies. It&rsquo;s because government is plagued by&hellip;</p>
<p>I would call it corruption because the corruption of bureaucratic paperwork.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not accountable. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a serious accountability.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re not living on the same planet. The greatest practitioners of central planning</p>
<p>are corporations. Elon has an operation like General Motors, Ford, IBM, or any of the other</p>
<p>megacorps. They have to plan. They buy up companies because they don&rsquo;t want to deal</p>
<p>in the market. They don&rsquo;t want the insecurity, the uncertainty of having to buy their inputs</p>
<p>or sell their outputs to somebody they don&rsquo;t control. They want the professor to teach the</p>
<p>genius of a market. They hate the market. And when they grow to be big, they keep buying</p>
<p>whoever they were dealing with before so they could better control them, which requires them</p>
<p>then to plan the production and distribution of goods inside rather than buying them in the market.</p>
<p>The model of the government is it&rsquo;s a private corporation. I have spent my life&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example. In American universities, big ones, famous ones, not just as a student but as</p>
<p>a professor. I&rsquo;ve been half a dozen schools. I teach now at the new school here. It&rsquo;s another one,</p>
<p>right? They all model themselves after businesses. They model their&hellip; You can attack the bureaucracy</p>
<p>of universities. Good reason. It&rsquo;s a mess. But they&rsquo;re proudly modeling themselves</p>
<p>on organizing their bureaucracy in a businesslike manner. So you&rsquo;re looking at a difference which</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there. The government and the private sector are partners, and both of them wouldn&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>any other way. The corporations want that from the government, and the government now knows that to</p>
<p>please the corporations is the number one objective they have because that&rsquo;s how they keep their jobs</p>
<p>and keep their system going. And so for all practical purposes, this is the same people.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s important differences that I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re fundamental or just a consequence</p>
<p>of history. But if you have government, they&rsquo;re accountable in a different way than companies.</p>
<p>Companies are accountable by&hellip; Especially if you have a consumer, they&rsquo;re accountable by sort of</p>
<p>the consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company is selling.</p>
<p>Right. The government is accountable by votes. And it seems like</p>
<p>government, unlike companies, for most of company&rsquo;s history, is always too big to fail, meaning</p>
<p>it can always just print money. It can always save itself. And that creates a bureaucracy.</p>
<p>You rarely pay the cost of having made bad decisions if you&rsquo;re in government. You</p>
<p>distribute the blame, and it&rsquo;s very unclear who&rsquo;s responsible for bad decisions. So bad decisions</p>
<p>in government accumulate. So you become more and more and more inefficient and more and more poor</p>
<p>in your decision making in terms of, you said, public transit. Should we build a public transit</p>
<p>system in this city or not? That&rsquo;s a difficult decision. That&rsquo;s an interesting decision. I would</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s very often a very good decision. But whoever makes that decision should be accountable</p>
<p>for a good or bad decision. And it seems like companies are more accountable. They pay&hellip;</p>
<p>They feel the pain of having made a bad decision more because it can go bankrupt. There&rsquo;s much more</p>
<p>day to day pressure to make good engineering decisions. Government doesn&rsquo;t seem to be under</p>
<p>the same level of pressure. Do you disagree with that? I disagree with that. Everything in my</p>
<p>history pushes me. You may be living&hellip; I may be living in a different planet or taking a different</p>
<p>sort of drug. I won&rsquo;t mention the name, but I personally had a lot to do with a very large</p>
<p>company here in the United States, here in the New York area. And it involved two brothers and</p>
<p>a family who built it up into a huge corporation. One of the brothers was kind of the dynamo</p>
<p>of the family. And he was more responsible than anybody else building it up.</p>
<p>But he took care of his brothers. He had a nice feeling about his brothers. So, the one brother</p>
<p>who could not, you know, without help tie his shoes, became a vice president. Got an enormous</p>
<p>salary. Got a beautiful office in a skyscraper, not that many blocks from where I&rsquo;m sitting right</p>
<p>now. And that was the way that family handled that company. And all of his relatives that were</p>
<p>somewhere in this company doing a variety of whatever, because&hellip; And my experience with this,</p>
<p>and because I went to the schools, I told you, all my experiences with that group of people,</p>
<p>corporate experiences, full of those stories. You know, they made mistake after mistake,</p>
<p>which they would tell you didn&rsquo;t undermine. They were always able to blame somebody else,</p>
<p>something else that scraped them through. And had they not been able to, they would have been</p>
<p>replaced by another person who did the same thing for as long as they could. And they knew it. They</p>
<p>would talk about it at family events. That&rsquo;s how I know. I understand that you want the outside</p>
<p>world to look at it this way, but it&rsquo;s not my experience.</p>
<p>But again, that kind of thing, at the risk of saying human nature again, I wonder what</p>
<p>kind of system allows for that more versus less. This is the question of, I would call that, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>put that under the umbrella term of corruption. Which system allows for more corruption?</p>
<p>But remember that the way I defined the different system is not more or less government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more or less allowing a democratic workplace, reconfiguring it. What happens when everybody</p>
<p>has a vote? When you have to explain what the strategies are, what the alternatives are to a</p>
<p>larger number of people than a board of directors or major shareholders or whoever it is that most</p>
<p>companies are responsible to. And now you&rsquo;ve got a whole different universe. It&rsquo;s not a small group</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t be hidden the way it&rsquo;s normally hidden, most of it, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>Worker coops is what this is called in many parts of the world. So it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m advocating</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s never been seen before, not at all. The Marxism I understand is to pick from</p>
<p>historical precedents the things that we think will work better. And I think if all the people</p>
<p>in enterprise, just to drive the point home, democratically decided they would never give</p>
<p>two or three individuals 100 million dollars while everybody else can&rsquo;t send their kid to</p>
<p>college. I mean they can do that. So just to return, just to address this point about the</p>
<p>particular implementation of Marxism that was the early days in the Soviet Union. Why did</p>
<p>Stalinism, for example, lead to so much bloodshed, do you think, and human suffering? Is there any</p>
<p>elements within the ideas of Marxism that catalyzed the kind of government, the kind of system that</p>
<p>led to that bloodshed? I don&rsquo;t think so. I think there were many things that led to the bloodshed</p>
<p>and to all that Stalin&rsquo;s regimes did. And I spent 10 years of my life with another economist writing</p>
<p>a book about that to try to explain from a Marxist position the rise and fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>You might want to take a look at it sometime. I&rsquo;m going to say a few things now, but all of</p>
<p>those things are spelled out in great detail with loads of empirical evidence, etc. in that work.</p>
<p>Let me start with playing a little bit with Hegel.</p>
<p>The biggest impact that Marxism had on the Soviet Union was really not so much what the Soviet Union</p>
<p>did, but what the rest of the world did. You had a really interesting move, and I&rsquo;ll give you a</p>
<p>parallel from today. The move was that the old Russian regime collapsed. World War I, it fell</p>
<p>apart. The Tsar and all of that, it couldn&rsquo;t survive. It had already been in trouble. There</p>
<p>was a revolution in 1905. There was the loss of the war to Japan. If you know Russian history,</p>
<p>which I assume you do, you&rsquo;ll know that there was a lot leading up to the collapse in 1917.</p>
<p>In some ways, it was fortuitous that the political group, very small, that could seize</p>
<p>the opportunity of that collapse, happened to be Marxists. Earlier on with Kerensky,</p>
<p>the first government that tried, it wasn&rsquo;t people all that impressed by Marxism. It was people more</p>
<p>skeptical and would not have been called Marxist, probably, by history. They tried. They couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Lenin and his associates were able to take over from them later in that same year.</p>
<p>The rest of the world, though, was horrified. The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken</p>
<p>this immense leap from being a political party, a movement, critical of capitalism, yes,</p>
<p>but still not challenging the power. Now it had the power, and in a big country. And they freaked</p>
<p>out. If you know American history, the leadership of this country went completely berserk. I mean,</p>
<p>we had a repression of the left, the likes of which we had not seen before. The 20s were a time</p>
<p>of Palmer raids in Boston, the Sacco Vanzetti trials, I mean, really grim hostility. And you</p>
<p>had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution.</p>
<p>The US, Britain, France, and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops. So what you had right away</p>
<p>was a notion in the West that this was unthinkable. There was a great professor at Princeton,</p>
<p>Meier, I forget his first name, who wrote this wonderful book about all American foreign policy</p>
<p>since 1917 has been obsessed with Russia. Even now, this fight with Ukraine is half about Russia,</p>
<p>as if Russia still was the Soviet Union, as if people haven&rsquo;t figured out. That was a big</p>
<p>change back in 1989 and 90. Yeltsin and Putin are not what you had before, or at least they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>Lenin. They may not be so different from some of the other, but in any case. So you had one factor</p>
<p>was the utter isolation, the utter condemnation, the global. I mean, Rosa Luxemburg, I assume you</p>
<p>know, Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets of Berlin. She&rsquo;s a critic of Lenin&rsquo;s, by the way,</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s a leftist, hunted down and hacked into bits, killed. So you&rsquo;re attributing some</p>
<p>of the bloodshed to the fact that basically the rest of the world turned away.</p>
<p>Turned against. Turned against. So you turn against is the better word.</p>
<p>I mean, not in order of importance, but it&rsquo;s a very important part of the psychology of being,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s what you would call paranoid if there weren&rsquo;t quite as much evidence that indeed</p>
<p>there was a lot to be afraid of at that time. Nobody had ever done it. Look, you could see the</p>
<p>effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea, which had no support at first, that you could have</p>
<p>socialism in one country. That was thought to be ridiculous, that socialism was internationalism.</p>
<p>Marx was against capitalism everywhere. It was, you know, workers of the world unite,</p>
<p>not workers of Russia unite. He had to go through a procedure of kind of coming to terms</p>
<p>with the fact that the revolution he had in Russia, which was tried in Berlin,</p>
<p>was tried in Munich, was tried in Budapest, was tried in Seattle here. They all failed.</p>
<p>They all failed, and he&rsquo;s left. So the French would say, tout √ßa, right? All alone. That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>The second thing is economic isolation. Russia&rsquo;s a poor country, and it needed what it got before</p>
<p>the war, which were heavy investments from the French and the Germans particularly, but others</p>
<p>too. Now this was all cut off, and you can see the replay with the sanctions program. We&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do it again. We&rsquo;re going to do it again. We have to do it. The world is different, and the sanctions</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work, but they&rsquo;re going to trial, because it&rsquo;s the history. But that culture today is</p>
<p>completely different. Russia&rsquo;s a different place today, but Russia has China, and that changes</p>
<p>everything. And they don&rsquo;t get that here yet, but they will. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a very complicated</p>
<p>dynamic with China, even with India. Yep. Or Turkey, Brazil. Sorry to say, human nature may</p>
<p>change at a slower pace. Yes, that has occurred to me as well. I get that point. So is there,</p>
<p>can you steel man the case, or consider the case, that there&rsquo;s something about the implementation</p>
<p>of Marxism, maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing on the working class and</p>
<p>workers unite, that naturally leads to a formation of a dictatorial force, a dictator that says,</p>
<p>let us temporarily give power to this person to manage some of the details of how to run the</p>
<p>democracy, of giving voice to the workers so that they get to choose. And then that naturally</p>
<p>leads to a dictator, and there&rsquo;s naturally, in human nature, power and absolute power,</p>
<p>as the old adage goes, corrupts absolutely. Is it possible that whenever you focus on Marxist ideals,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to end up with a dictator, and often, when you give too much power to anyone human,</p>
<p>a small number of people, you&rsquo;re going to get into a huge amount of trouble? You&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>putched things together there that I would&hellip; That&rsquo;s what&hellip; I think if you give&hellip;</p>
<p>Putched is a good word. Yeah. It&rsquo;s German.</p>
<p>Remember, I told you, my mother was born in Germany. And then your dad is French.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he was born in Metz, if you know European. It&rsquo;s a city on the border of France</p>
<p>and Germany. If you come from Alsatians, Alsass in German.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re German speaking, French speaking?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re both. It&rsquo;s bilingual because it&rsquo;s been back and forth so many times</p>
<p>in medieval days already that it&hellip; Literally, you go from one store to another,</p>
<p>the proprietor here is French and the proprietor there is German,</p>
<p>but they all speak both languages because&hellip; You don&rsquo;t speak either of them?</p>
<p>I speak Russian.</p>
<p>Russian, but not German or French? Ukrainian, no. It took French for four years</p>
<p>in high school, but I&rsquo;ve forgotten all of it. I remember the romance and the spirit</p>
<p>of the language, but not the details. I&rsquo;m sure I can remember.</p>
<p>If you allocate power unequally, undemocratically, and you do it for a very long period of time,</p>
<p>and you do it on many levels of ideology, it is not surprising that it sticks and it stays.</p>
<p>And you can make a political revolution or even an economic revolution and you will discover</p>
<p>it has a life of its own and it&rsquo;s going to take a long time before people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you have a religious tradition, Christianity, that prides itself on its monotheism</p>
<p>and that it doesn&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with the old Greek mythologies when there was</p>
<p>Zeus and Diana and all the others, and they were very humanlike, but instead we have one</p>
<p>who is the absolute beginning. What are you doing? You&rsquo;re teaching people</p>
<p>an authority line that comes from the individual. If you have a sequence of kings,</p>
<p>if in your feudal manner the lord sits called the landlord and he has unspeakable power</p>
<p>over everything that goes on, and you do this for thousands of years,</p>
<p>you can make a Russian revolution in 1917. But if you imagine you&rsquo;ve gotten away from all that</p>
<p>people assume without ever thinking about it, you&rsquo;re going to have trouble. Stalin is figured</p>
<p>here as the originator of his situation. He wasn&rsquo;t. He never had that power. He may have thought that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s the product. Look, the Cuban people made Fidel, who really wasn&rsquo;t that kind</p>
<p>of guy. You know, he&rsquo;s a baseball playing lawyer. That&rsquo;s what he was. But they made him into Tala.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the product of history. No, no, no. It was the systems, feudalism, the nature,</p>
<p>it was the structures and institutions that cultivated in people a mentality that has its</p>
<p>own rhythm and doesn&rsquo;t follow the calendar of a political revolution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental question. Is there something about communism</p>
<p>that creates a mentality that enables somebody like Stalin or Mao?</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s the social issues and problems the society has that make them then go to what</p>
<p>they find familiar, to what seems to make sense, and he&rsquo;s the guy. Look, let me give you an example</p>
<p>from American history. The Republican Party has traditionally in this country been the party of</p>
<p>private enterprise and minimum government. In comes Trump, runs for office in 2016,</p>
<p>is elected. What does he do? He commences the most massive tax increase and the most</p>
<p>massive government intervention in the worlds of economics that we&rsquo;ve had for decades. Nobody says</p>
<p>anything. The Republicans cave and the Democrats largely too. They cave. He can throw a tariff on</p>
<p>anything. He gets up in front of the American people and he says the Chinese will pay the tariff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what a tariff is. It&rsquo;s not how a tariff works. He would flunk a freshman course</p>
<p>in economics, which everybody knows, everybody who teaches these courses. No, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still calling the shots. What is going on here is that a society has come to a point where it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>solve its problems and it begins what? To tap into older forms and all of the laissez faire</p>
<p>and all of the individualism. And suddenly the Republican Party is gung ho. And now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to make abortion illegal. The government is telling you what you can do with your uterus.</p>
<p>What? What? The government is being given more and more and more and more power. They&rsquo;re hoping</p>
<p>what? Do they like the government? No. They&rsquo;re desperate. This is not a pro government</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t in Russia either. They were in a desperate fix and so, and he took advantage.</p>
<p>So to which degree would you say Marx&rsquo;s ideas led to the creation of the</p>
<p>National Socialism Party of German workers, hence the Nazi Party, the fascist party in the 30s</p>
<p>and the 40s at the head of whom was Hitler, which I just recently learned he was</p>
<p>employee number seven of the party or whatever, the seventh person to have joined the party</p>
<p>and have created one of the most consequential and powerful political parties in the history</p>
<p>of the 20th century. What degree did Marx&rsquo;s ideas, Marxism ideas have to play? It is the National</p>
<p>Socialist Party of German workers. Right. Workers. National Socialist Deutsche Arbeiter Partei,</p>
<p>German Worker Party. Worker Party. National Socialist German Worker Party. So. Well here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the history. Did he care about the workers or did he just use the workers as a populist message?</p>
<p>The only thing that Marxism did for Mr. Hitler was provide him with his stepping stone to power,</p>
<p>but had nothing, no other, he didn&rsquo;t know anything about it, didn&rsquo;t care anything about it,</p>
<p>nor did the people around him. Here&rsquo;s the story of what happened there,</p>
<p>which I know largely through my own family and plus my own history, the work that I did.</p>
<p>The most successful socialist party in Europe was the German Party. It started around 1870,</p>
<p>Marx was still alive. Some of his own family were leaders, Fernand Lassalle and others, his daughters.</p>
<p>By the end of the century, it was the second most important party in Germany.</p>
<p>Nobody understood it. It was almost as big a shock to the Europeans as was the Russian Revolution</p>
<p>in 1917. Here was a political party that was now in every German city, in every German town,</p>
<p>powerful and enjoying its rise up. My family is involved in this, I really do know the story.</p>
<p>It meant that starting around 1906, 1907, 1908, if you wanted to have any kind of presence</p>
<p>in the German working class, you had to use the word socialist. You had to, otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pay attention. The other parties called themselves Catholic. Germany is divided, the upper two,</p>
<p>the northern two thirds is Protestant, the southern third is Catholic. Munich and Bavaria</p>
<p>is Catholic and every other part of Germany basically is Protestant. You could be in the</p>
<p>Catholic Party, that was the south, or you could be in various conservative, Prussian and other.</p>
<p>But if you wanted to have a presence in the working class, which was growing, in Germany</p>
<p>a very powerful capitalist country, expanding like crazy at this time. Germany was the major</p>
<p>competitor to Britain for the empire. The United States was coming up too, but it was Germany and</p>
<p>US taking over from Britain&rsquo;s empire. So the German working class was it. So anybody who wanted</p>
<p>to approach the working class in whatever way had to come to terms and be friendly to socialism.</p>
<p>Other parties did this too, just like Hitler. They put the word socialist in their party,</p>
<p>but they wanted to make it clear that they weren&rsquo;t anything to do with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>or anything to do with Marxism. So they put the word national. Nazi is the first four letters</p>
<p>of national, national in German, and the ZI is how you spell national in the German.</p>
<p>National socialism, but definitely not communists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. They killed communists. They fought communists in the street.</p>
<p>They had pitched battles. They literally threatened each other&rsquo;s existence and their</p>
<p>lives. And the first people that he arrested and put in jail were not Jews and gypsies and all the</p>
<p>other people he eventually killed. It was communists. They were the number one, and</p>
<p>socialists right behind him. Why? Because up until he takes power, January of 1933,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when Hitler takes power, the last elections, two of them in 1932,</p>
<p>the socialists and communists, they vote together, 50% of the vote in Germany.</p>
<p>So he appealed to the German manufacturers, the German capitalists, and he said,</p>
<p>the communists and socialists are going to win. And you&rsquo;re just the capitalists. You have too</p>
<p>few people. You need a mass base, and I&rsquo;m the only one that can do that.</p>
<p>And it was just a populist message that he used.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. But it was explicitly done as a deal. The ruling group said to Hindenburg,</p>
<p>the old Prussian man who was in charge of the German government at the time,</p>
<p>you have to invite Hitler to form a new government. Otherwise, he would never have</p>
<p>done it. He had called Hitler nasty names before. The Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler</p>
<p>as a little funny man with a mustache who was Austrian, wasn&rsquo;t even German. For them,</p>
<p>that mattered. So he comes in as the enemy, the smasher of socialism and communism,</p>
<p>which he immediately does. Only people who don&rsquo;t know or care about the history</p>
<p>pick up on the word. It&rsquo;s like there are people here in the United States who like to say,</p>
<p>we are not a democracy, we are a republic, which is like saying, I&rsquo;m not a banana, I&rsquo;m a fruit.</p>
<p>You have to explain to these people, a banana is a kind of fruit. So you have to explain to people,</p>
<p>yes, we&rsquo;re a republic, but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the republic,</p>
<p>because to say you&rsquo;re a republic doesn&rsquo;t imply what kind of government you have. You have to</p>
<p>go through that with people so they kind of get it.</p>
<p>And certain words have power beyond their actual meaning. They&rsquo;re used in communication,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s negative, like racist, or positive, like freedom of speech.</p>
<p>RL. Or Democrat, with a D.</p>
<p>RG. Yeah, and then you use that to mean something.</p>
<p>RL. Who knows?</p>
<p>RG. Or negative, stop Donnie, stop being a socialist, or whatever that means that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even used in any kind of philosophical or economic sense. So let&rsquo;s fast forward to today.</p>
<p>RL. Right.</p>
<p>RG. You mentioned Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>RL. Right.</p>
<p>RG. There&rsquo;s another popular figure that represents some ideas of maybe let&rsquo;s call it democratic</p>
<p>socialism, and maybe let&rsquo;s try to start to sneak up on a definition of what that could</p>
<p>possibly mean, but AOC, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, she&rsquo;s from these parts.</p>
<p>RL. Yes, Queens.</p>
<p>RG. So maybe if you can comment on Bernie Sanders or AOC, are they open to some ideas in Marxism?</p>
<p>Are they representing those ideas well in both the economic and the political sense?</p>
<p>RL. Okay.</p>
<p>RG. Where do I begin?</p>
<p>RL. Yeah, the socialist movement predates Marx, was always larger than Marx, and has</p>
<p>gone on to develop separately after Marx&rsquo;s death. So&hellip;</p>
<p>RG. Can we pause on that actually? Is there a nice way to delineate, draw a line between</p>
<p>Marxism and socialism? Or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism, can you speak to like,</p>
<p>maybe try to define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is?</p>
<p>RL. Right. Marxism is a systematic analysis heavily focused on economics, and as I said</p>
<p>earlier, devoted to mostly a critique of capitalism, and that&rsquo;s its strength, how it does that,</p>
<p>how it poses the questions, how it analyzes the way capitalism works. That is really the</p>
<p>forte of the Marxist tradition. Socialism is a bigger, broader tent within which Marxism</p>
<p>figures. It&rsquo;s there so that people who aren&rsquo;t Marxists are nonetheless aware of Marxism,</p>
<p>like it more or less, study it more or less. But it&rsquo;s a broader notion that I like to use</p>
<p>this sentence to describe. It&rsquo;s a broad idea that we can do better than capitalism, that really</p>
<p>there are all kinds of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the</p>
<p>world think are adequate, that we are in a tradition that goes back to all the people who</p>
<p>thought they could do better than slavery, and all the people who thought they could do better</p>
<p>than feudalism. We&rsquo;ve made progress. Feudalism was a progress over slavery. Capitalism was a</p>
<p>progress over both of them. And progress hasn&rsquo;t stopped. And we are the people who, in a variety</p>
<p>of ways, want the progress to go further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is</p>
<p>somehow the best beyond which we cannot go or even think. We find that to be, in the worst sense of</p>
<p>the word, a reactionary way of thinking. And we&rsquo;re that large community. Many of us are not interested</p>
<p>in economics all that much. We don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the focal area. We are socialists, for example,</p>
<p>because we want to do something to deal with climate change. We think the world is about to</p>
<p>kill itself physically, and we want to take steps with other people to stop that, to fix that, etc.,</p>
<p>etc. So that&rsquo;s, for me, a kind of difference. It&rsquo;s a little difficult to say because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>other figure like Marx that has an equal impact, an equal place within the broad socialist</p>
<p>tradition. And the only tradition that comes close might be the anarchist tradition. But that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>specialized, and that&rsquo;s a whole other kind of conversation. And whatever you say, the influence</p>
<p>of the great anarchist thinkers‚ÄîKropotkin, Bakunin, Sorel, and others‚Äîstill doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>amount to the impact that Marx and Marxism have had so far. That could change, but I mean, up to</p>
<p>this point, that&rsquo;s the‚ÄîI think that&rsquo;s a way of understanding the relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an interesting thing that some of the ideas within anarchism‚Äîand of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the more varied disciplines because there&rsquo;s such, maybe by definition, such variety</p>
<p>in their thinkers‚Äîbut they kind of stand for a dismantling of a power center, and that,</p>
<p>if not equates, tends to rhyme with some of the ideas of socialism.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole train of thought in socialist ideas and in Marxist ideas</p>
<p>that uses the phrase, quote, the withering away of the state. That&rsquo;s a quotation from Lenin.</p>
<p>People should understand that&rsquo;s a quotation from Lenin. And it was made by Lenin. In other words,</p>
<p>Lenin was saying, that&rsquo;s a good thing. That&rsquo;s something we stand for. We want to create the</p>
<p>conditions under which there is a‚Äîbecause you remember the communists, or whatever,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t called that at first in Russia before the revolution. They were just socialists.</p>
<p>They were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right. They had no love</p>
<p>for the government. The government was their literal, everyday enemy. And being critical</p>
<p>of government didn&rsquo;t just mean this particular government, but of the whole‚Äîbeing a Marxist,</p>
<p>you always ask the questions of the social constitution of whatever it is you&rsquo;re struggling</p>
<p>against. So there was this interest, why is the state so important? Especially because if you</p>
<p>understand feudalism, particularly early feudalism, it didn&rsquo;t have powerful states.</p>
<p>One of Lenin&rsquo;s greatest books is called The Economic History of Russia, and it goes back</p>
<p>centuries. It&rsquo;s a huge book, three or four inches thick, and I&rsquo;m one of the few people who&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>it. And he&rsquo;s very good about the absence of a strong central government in many parts of</p>
<p>feudalism, including inside Russia, but also in other parts of Europe. The development of a powerful</p>
<p>central state comes towards the end of feudalism as it is desperate to hold on, which ought to be</p>
<p>suggestive that maybe the turn to powerful governments here in the United States or in Europe</p>
<p>and Europe is maybe also because this system is exhausted and can&rsquo;t go on and has to marshal every</p>
<p>last bit of power it can, not to be lost in history. It would be interesting to see what</p>
<p>the Soviet Union would look like if Lenin never died. A lot of people have asked that question</p>
<p>over the years, a lot of people. There&rsquo;s Stalin sliding in in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>erasing the withering away of the state part. So just to return briefly back to AOC and Bernie</p>
<p>Sanders, what are your thoughts about these modern political figures that represent some of these</p>
<p>ideas, and they sometimes refer to those ideas as democratic socialism? The crucial thing about</p>
<p>Bernie and about AOC, and this is particularly true about Bernie, because AOC is much younger</p>
<p>and Bernie&rsquo;s an older man. Bernie, being roughly my age, has been around formatively as a student,</p>
<p>as an activist, and then coming up through the ranks in Burlington, Vermont as a mayor and all</p>
<p>the rest. He lived through what, for lack of a better term, I would call Cold War America.</p>
<p>And the taboo in Cold War America, running from around 1945, 6 to the present, I mean,</p>
<p>really never stopped, was a Manichean worldview. The United States is good, it defines democracy,</p>
<p>and the Soviet Union is awful, it defines whatever the opposite of democracy should be called.</p>
<p>Good here, evil there. It was taken so far that even among the ranks of academic individuals,</p>
<p>it was impossible to have a conversation. I mean, I can&rsquo;t tell, just make it very personal,</p>
<p>the number of times I would raise my hand in my classes at Harvard or Stanford or Yale,</p>
<p>and I would ask a question that had something to do with Marxism,</p>
<p>because I was studying it on my own. There were no courses to teach this to me,</p>
<p>except by people who trashed it, other than that, and I didn&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>So I would ask a question, and I would see in the faces of my teachers, both those I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>much care for and those who were good teachers that I liked, fear. It was just fear. They didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to go there. They didn&rsquo;t want to answer my question. And after a while, I got to know some</p>
<p>of them, and I found out why. Because you don&rsquo;t know how the rest of the class is going to</p>
<p>understand this. Either they would have to say, I don&rsquo;t know, which would be the honest truth for</p>
<p>many of them, but a professor does not want to say in a classroom, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>not cool. Or they&rsquo;d have to, if they knew, they&rsquo;d have to say something that indicated they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know really much, and they weren&rsquo;t going to do that. Or they would know something, and maybe</p>
<p>that would be because they were interested. They did not want the rest of the students to begin to</p>
<p>say, oh, you know, Professor Smith, you know, he&rsquo;s interested. This is not good for your career. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how this is going to play out. Who&rsquo;s going to say what to whom? And I could see in</p>
<p>their faces what I later learned, because they told me, come to my office hours. We&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>office. We can talk about it. But that&rsquo;s how bad it was. Is it not still? Pretty much. In my field,</p>
<p>the great so called debate, I mean, I find it boring, but the great debate for my colleagues</p>
<p>is between what&rsquo;s called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics. Neoclassical, the</p>
<p>government should stay out of the economy. Let&rsquo;s say fair or liberalism. And the Keynesian saying,</p>
<p>no, you crazy neoclassical, if you do that, you&rsquo;ll have Great Depressions, and the system will</p>
<p>collapse. You need the government to come in to solve the problems, to fix the weaknesses. And</p>
<p>they hate each other, and they throw each other out of their jobs. One of the very few things that</p>
<p>they can do together that they agree on is keeping people like me out. That they can find common</p>
<p>ground to do. So I had to learn it all on my own. Why am I telling you this? Because this taboo means</p>
<p>that all of the complicated developments within Marxism and within socialism of the post World</p>
<p>War II period, the vast bulk of all of that is unknown, not just to the average American person,</p>
<p>but to the average American academic, to the average American who thinks of himself or herself</p>
<p>as an intellectual. I mean, I have had to spend ridiculous amounts of my time explaining Soviet</p>
<p>history. They have no idea. Or saying there&rsquo;s this man Luk√°cs, a Hungarian Marxist, he really had</p>
<p>interest in, or to explain that Gramsci was not a great literary critic. He was head of the</p>
<p>Communist Party of Italy for most of his adult life. What does that mean? You like Gramsci as a</p>
<p>literary critic, but they didn&rsquo;t even know. They don&rsquo;t even know. It&rsquo;s been erased. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little bit like stories I&rsquo;ve heard about Trotsky and his influence kind of erased in the Soviet</p>
<p>Union because he obviously fell out of favor. And so somehow all of his writings, many of which are</p>
<p>very interesting and complicated, anyway. So what you&rsquo;re going to have in this country is a slow</p>
<p>awakening of socialism from a long hibernation called the Cold War. I never expected, to be very</p>
<p>honest with you, that I would live to see it. I knew it would come, because these things always do,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t expect to see it. So I have been surprised, as have a lot of us, that when it</p>
<p>starts to happen, it happens fast. So you see Bernie as an early sign of the awakening from</p>
<p>the Cold War to accept the idea of socialism. Bernie was always a socialist. We all knew.</p>
<p>And everybody who paid attention, he denied it. But 2016, he makes a decision, momentous,</p>
<p>to run for president. He&rsquo;s just a senator from Vermont. Vermont is one of the smallest</p>
<p>states in the Union. People who live in Vermont love to tell you that there are more cows than</p>
<p>people in Vermont, et cetera, et cetera. So here from this little state, this elderly gentleman</p>
<p>with a New York City accent runs for office and says, I&rsquo;m a socialist. And when they attack him,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t run away. I&rsquo;m a socialist. I&rsquo;m a socialist. Now, he had been. It wasn&rsquo;t a secret</p>
<p>that suddenly got out. But the great question‚Äîand I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, because I went to the</p>
<p>right schools. I know a lot of people. You know, Janet Yellen was my classmate at Yale,</p>
<p>and stuff like that. So I was speaking with a high official of the Democratic Party,</p>
<p>and I said, well, what do you think about Bernie entering the race?</p>
<p>Makes no difference. He doesn&rsquo;t get 1% of the vote. Right? He was wrong. They had no idea</p>
<p>what was coming. But the truth is, I didn&rsquo;t either. It wasn&rsquo;t just that he didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>I thought his 1% was probably right. So we were both wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, change can happen fast. Do you think AOC might be president one day?</p>
<p>Yeah. Possible. Possible. But two things. Number one, it&rsquo;s fast. Number two,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to go in the following direction, I would guess. You begin with the most moderate,</p>
<p>calm, nonconfrontational socialism you can imagine.</p>
<p>So not AOC or Bernie.</p>
<p>No, no. They are not confrontational, in my judgment.</p>
<p>In terms of the ideas of socialism. I mean, they&rsquo;re both very feisty.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re feisty personally, but not ideologically.</p>
<p>Bernie is also, in honest moments, and they both really are pretty honest folks,</p>
<p>at least in my experience. In honest moments, Bernie will tell you that what he advocates</p>
<p>as democratic socialism is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s. It was a kind of popular</p>
<p>government, tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the</p>
<p>working class than you do now. That&rsquo;s not a fundamental change. That&rsquo;s what he means</p>
<p>by socialism. When he talks about it and he&rsquo;s asked for examples, he mentions Denmark a lot.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s consistent. That&rsquo;s the softest kind of socialism, and that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>start in a country coming out of hibernation. Pretty soon, it&rsquo;s already happening, there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be people who need and want to go further in the direction of socialism than Bernie and AOC are</p>
<p>comfortable with. You can already see the shoots of it now. AOC voted, together with most of the</p>
<p>others, to support the money for Ukraine. Okay, a lot of people in the socialist movement do not</p>
<p>support that. I don&rsquo;t know exactly how that&rsquo;s going to work out, but that should give people</p>
<p>an idea. There are disagreements, and they&rsquo;re going to fester, and they&rsquo;re going to grow.</p>
<p>So people in the socialist sphere don&rsquo;t support money from the United States in the large amounts</p>
<p>that it is being sent to Ukraine. Is it because it&rsquo;s fundamentally the military, industrial</p>
<p>complex is a capitalist institution kind of thing? No, there are some people for whom that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>issue. Then there are people for whom it&rsquo;s guns and butter, and why are we over there when we have</p>
<p>such needs at home that are being neglected? And then there are people who, well, go back to what</p>
<p>we talked about at the beginning, who are more like Lenin and Debs. This is a fight between</p>
<p>Western capitalism and Russian oligarchs and wannabe oligarchs in Ukraine, and what are we</p>
<p>doing here? We have to insist that these forces sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate</p>
<p>a settlement, don&rsquo;t kill large numbers of Ukraine. I mean, everybody&rsquo;s willing to fight to the last</p>
<p>Ukrainian is a little strange here. What are you doing? You&rsquo;re supposed to be in favor of peace,</p>
<p>you know, and for the United States, which just finished invading and occupying Afghanistan and</p>
<p>Iraq, to be against another country invading. I mean, who in the world is going to take this</p>
<p>seriously? This is crazy. You know, I invade, it&rsquo;s good, and you invade, it&rsquo;s terrible. What?</p>
<p>You know, what are you doing? Why are you doing that? What&rsquo;s going on here? All of these</p>
<p>questions are being active‚Äîby the way, not just by socialists, by lots of other people too‚Äîinside</p>
<p>the Democratic Party and also inside the Republican Party. You watch that Tucker Carlson or people</p>
<p>like that, they are against the stuff in Ukraine. They don&rsquo;t want the money spent there, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want the weapons sent there, they don&rsquo;t like the whole policy, and Trump wobble.</p>
<p>So Mr. Biden&rsquo;s policy has got all kinds of critics on the left and the right,</p>
<p>and every day that this thing lasts, these criticisms get bigger. Anyway, the point is that</p>
<p>AOC and Bernie should be, I think, evaluated as the early shoots after a long winter of Cold War</p>
<p>isolation from the whole‚Äîyou know, when I explain to people the contribution made, for example,</p>
<p>to modern Marxism‚ÄîI&rsquo;ll give you an example‚Äîby the French philosopher Louis Althusser. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if the name means anything to you. Okay. He was the rector of the √âcole Normale</p>
<p>Sup√©rieure in Paris. That&rsquo;s the equivalent. Imagine in this country if there were a university</p>
<p>that combined Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and MIT. It would be the university. Well, the √âcole Normale</p>
<p>in France, in Paris, is the‚Äîhe was a tenured professor who became the rector. The rector is</p>
<p>like the president of the university, an active member of the French Communist Party most of his</p>
<p>adult life. That was possible in France during the Cold War. That was unthinkable in this country.</p>
<p>You could not in a million years, right? So Althusser, as a philosopher, tried to bring</p>
<p>a version of postmodernism into Marxism, with enormous impact all over the world, where he</p>
<p>traveled‚Äînot just in Europe, all over, right? So if you want to look him up, I&rsquo;ll spell it out for</p>
<p>you. Sure. A.L.T.H.U.S.S.E.R. Louis. The Louis is spelled L.O.U.I.S. Louis Althusser. Look him up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see tons of stuff. By the way, MIT Press is a major publisher, if I remember, of his works</p>
<p>in English. By the way, the textbook I wrote in economics, in case you&rsquo;re ever interested,</p>
<p>was also published by the MIT Press. And the title? Contending Economic Theories.</p>
<p>Neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian. That&rsquo;s at MIT. Marxian. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. And by the way,</p>
<p>when we think‚ÄîI don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s an interesting distinction between Marxian economics</p>
<p>and Marxist‚ÄîI suppose Marxism is the umbrella of everything that&rsquo;s‚Äî I only use it because</p>
<p>Marxist I use as a noun. A person is a Marxist. Marxian I use as an adjective to qualify. But</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean some great difference. There&rsquo;s a last point I would like to make about</p>
<p>AOC and Bernie that&rsquo;s also general. I&rsquo;m a historian, too, and I know that the transition</p>
<p>out of feudalism in Europe to capitalism was a transition that took centuries and that occurred</p>
<p>in fits and starts. So, for example, a feudal manor would start to disintegrate. Serfs would</p>
<p>run away. They&rsquo;d run into a town. How would they live in the town? They had no land anymore because</p>
<p>they had run away from the feudal manor. A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal</p>
<p>understanding what they were doing. A merchant would say to one of these serfs, I&rsquo;m in the</p>
<p>business of buying and then reselling stuff and living off the difference, but, you know,</p>
<p>I could make more money if I produce some of this stuff myself rather than buy it from somebody</p>
<p>else. So I&rsquo;m going to make you a deal. I&rsquo;m going to give you money once a week. I&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>money, what we would later call a wage, and you come here and under my supervision you make this</p>
<p>crap that I&rsquo;m going to then sell and this all works out. In other words, there were efforts,</p>
<p>unconscious, not self aware, to go out of feudalism to a new system.</p>
<p>Some of them lasted a few days and then fell apart. Some of them lasted weeks or months or</p>
<p>years, but it took a long time before the conditions were ready for a kind of a general</p>
<p>switch and once that was done it grew on itself and became the global capitalist system we have</p>
<p>today. That&rsquo;s the only model we have. So for me that&rsquo;s what I see when I look at socialism.</p>
<p>I see the Paris Commune was an event, an attempt. It lasted a few weeks. I see Russia, that was an</p>
<p>attempt, lasted 70 years. Then I see, and you know, fill in the blank, I see these are all early</p>
<p>experiments. These are all you learn things to do, learn things never to do again. The good, the bad,</p>
<p>what do you build on? How do you learn? And that&rsquo;s what the socialist and Marxist tradition</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s serious, that&rsquo;s what it does. So in your ideas sort of capitalism was a significant</p>
<p>improvement over the feudalism and we are coming to an age and over slavery and we&rsquo;re coming to</p>
<p>an age where capitalism will die out and make, it&rsquo;s not that capitalism is somehow fundamentally</p>
<p>broken. It&rsquo;s better than the things that came before but there&rsquo;s going to be things yet better</p>
<p>and they will be grounded in the ideas of Marxism and socialism. Is there just to linger briefly on</p>
<p>the way Marxism is used as a term on Twitter. There&rsquo;s something called, I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;m using</p>
<p>the terms incorrectly, but cultural Marxism. Criticisms of universities being infiltrated</p>
<p>by cultural Marxists. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure. I don&rsquo;t pay close enough attention, but it&rsquo;s woke.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of woke ideology that I&rsquo;m not exactly sure. What is the fundamental text?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the Karl Marx of wokeness? All I do know is that there&rsquo;s certain characteristics</p>
<p>of woke ideology, which is hard lines are drawn between the good guys and the bad guys.</p>
<p>And basically everyone is a bad guy except the people that are very loudly nonstop saying that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the good guy. And that applies for racism, for sexism, for gender politics,</p>
<p>identity politics, all that kind of stuff. Is there any parallels between Marxian economics</p>
<p>and Marxist ideology and whatever is being called Marxism on Twitter?</p>
<p>WOLFF No, not much. One of the consequences</p>
<p>of the taboo after World War II is that Marxism, like socialism and communism, become swear words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like calling somebody, well, I won&rsquo;t use bad language, but using a four letter word to describe</p>
<p>somebody. So instead of calling them this or that, you call them a Marxist. In many circles,</p>
<p>this is even worse than whatever other adjective you might have used, but it doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>particular meaning that I can assess. The closest you get is your little list. It is somebody who is</p>
<p>concerned about race and sex and sexual orientation, gender and all of those things,</p>
<p>and wants there to be transgendered bathrooms. And I don&rsquo;t like any of these people, so I slap</p>
<p>the word Marxism or the phrase cultural Marxism, because it isn&rsquo;t Marxism about getting more money</p>
<p>or controlling the industry or all those things that dimly we know Marxists somehow are concerned</p>
<p>about. So this is odd, since they don&rsquo;t know much about Marxism. I&rsquo;ve always been interested</p>
<p>in culture. I mean, Lukacs, the man I mentioned to you before, Gramsci, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re famous</p>
<p>for, the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture. Gramsci writes at great</p>
<p>length about the Catholic Church, about theater and painting in Italy and on and on. I mean,</p>
<p>this is just ignorance talking. They don&rsquo;t know anything about that. They wouldn&rsquo;t know what the</p>
<p>names are. It&rsquo;s a label that summarizes, kind of a shorthand, I&rsquo;m against all of this. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be told that there&rsquo;s ugly racism in this country, and it always has been, or sexism, or</p>
<p>phobia against gay people, whatever it is that&rsquo;s agitating them. Marxism or socialism,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like socialism is the post office. It is a mentality. Well, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>blame them. I mean, it&rsquo;s childish. It&rsquo;s mean spirited. But it comes out of the fact no one</p>
<p>ever sat them down and said, you know, here is this tradition. It&rsquo;s got these kinds of things</p>
<p>that people kind of share and these big differences. Look, an intelligent society,</p>
<p>which this country is, could have and should have done that. It was fear and a kind of terror that</p>
<p>made them behave in the way they did, and we&rsquo;re now seeing it. Having said that, there is such a</p>
<p>thing as cultural Marxism. What that is is simply those Marxists who devoted themselves to analyzing</p>
<p>how it is that a particular culture is, on the one hand, shaped by capitalism and, on the other hand,</p>
<p>it becomes a condition for capitalism to survive and grow. In other words, how do we analyze the</p>
<p>interaction between the class struggle on the job and attitude towards sexuality, or movements in</p>
<p>music, or whatever else culture. And there are Georg Luk√°cs, this Hungarian, great name in there,</p>
<p>the greatest of all the names, Antonio Gramsci. And a modern name, just died a couple years ago,</p>
<p>a British intellectual named Stuart Hall, H A L L. If I were teaching, which I have done,</p>
<p>a course in cultural Marxism, those would be three major blocks on the syllabus. I would give you</p>
<p>articles and books to read of their stuff, because it has been so seminal in provoking many, many</p>
<p>others. So there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that</p>
<p>capitalism creates and the kind of culture that enables capitalism. Yes, and Marxists are</p>
<p>particularly those who like to look at that interaction. In other words, they are interested</p>
<p>in how capitalism shapes culture and how culture shapes capitalism. There is another name, I</p>
<p>forgot. Stuart Hall is British, Gramsci is Italian, Luk√°cs is Hungarian. The German is Walter Benjamin,</p>
<p>B E N J A M I N. He was a member of the Frankfurt School, which is a huge school of Marxism that</p>
<p>developed in Frankfurt, Germany, and that has a lot of people, many of whom were interested in</p>
<p>cultural questions. It was a bit of a reaction against the narrow Marxism that was so focused on</p>
<p>economics and politics. There were people who said, you&rsquo;re leaving out very important parts</p>
<p>of modern society that are shaping the economy as much as they are shaped by it. And it was that</p>
<p>impetus to open Marxism to be more inclusive in what it deemed to be important to understand</p>
<p>that this cult, and they call themselves cultural Marxists, but they had a completely different</p>
<p>meaning from this. This is just, you know, just bad mouthing, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>LW Let me ask a more personal question. So for most of the 20th century, no not most,</p>
<p>but a large many decades in the United States as a consequence of the Cold War and before,</p>
<p>being a Marxist is one of the worst things you could be. Have you had dark periods in your own</p>
<p>life where you&rsquo;ve gone to some dark places in your mind where it was difficult, like self doubt,</p>
<p>difficult to know, like what the hell am I doing? When you&rsquo;re surrounded by colleagues and people,</p>
<p>you said prestigious universities, both personal interest of career, but also as a human being,</p>
<p>when everybody, you know, kind of looks at you funny because you&rsquo;re studying this thing. Did</p>
<p>that ever get you real low?</p>
<p>RL No. I know people who had exactly what you said. I mean, your question&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>If I were you, I&rsquo;d be asking me that question too.</p>
<p>LW And what&rsquo;s wrong with you?</p>
<p>RL Nothing wrong with the question. And here&rsquo;s the honest truth. I don&rsquo;t know how anomalous I am. I</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t. But the truth is, no. I have, if my wife was sitting here, she&rsquo;d tell you what she</p>
<p>tells me, which is I have been tremendously lucky in my life, which is true. But then again,</p>
<p>luck never is the only explanation for things. That&rsquo;s part of it. What can I say? I didn&rsquo;t choose</p>
<p>the time of my birth. I didn&rsquo;t choose the communities in which I grew up or the schools I</p>
<p>attended or anything else.</p>
<p>RL No, but the fact that there was no courses or extensive courses on Marxian economics.</p>
<p>RL But you know, again, I&rsquo;m Hegel. On the one hand, I was denied good instruction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I had to go out and learn it on my own. And the motivation when you do that is</p>
<p>very different. I&rsquo;m not the student who sits there with my notebook, taking notes of what the great</p>
<p>professor says and reading the text and getting ready for the exam. I don&rsquo;t have an exam. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing something slightly risque, you know, kind of romantically different and oppositional. I was</p>
<p>able to find always one or two professors that I could talk to outside of the classroom situation,</p>
<p>other students who felt enough similar to me that we could get together and read these books and</p>
<p>talk about them. I had a number of really fortuitous people who were kind to me and gave me</p>
<p>of their time and their effort to teach me along the way. And I&rsquo;ve had the benefit that because I</p>
<p>went to all these fancy schools, I do know a lot of people who are in high places in this culture.</p>
<p>And when I have been put in difficult positions, I often wave my pedicure at them and say,</p>
<p>I often wave my pedigree and it works like garlic with the devil. They back away. They back away.</p>
<p>Because Americans are very deferential to that kind of academic prestige.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a personal psychological thing that seems that you have never been shaken by this. You</p>
<p>have just naturally somebody who just has perseverance.</p>
<p>WOLFF Well, I would put it, I understand what you&rsquo;re saying, but I would put it a little</p>
<p>differently. I think capitalism struck me early on in my life as not that great a system and nothing</p>
<p>has happened to change my mind. In other words, the development just kept giving me more and more</p>
<p>evidence. And I must say over the last 10 years, what&rsquo;s really changed? The last 10 years. I mean,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t describe to you how big that change is. And that may be more important than anything else</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve discussed. Up until 10 years ago, I would do a public event, an interview on television or</p>
<p>a radio thing or give a talk at some conference or something. Once every two or three months,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be invited and I would do it, like academics often do. I now do two to three to four</p>
<p>interviews every day. So, there&rsquo;s a hunger. How is there hunger? And I want to be honest with you.</p>
<p>WOLFF As I say at the end of some of my talks, I allow there to be a kind of a pregnant pause</p>
<p>from the podium that I lean into the microphone and I say, with as much smile as I can get,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having the time of my life. And that&rsquo;s the truth. That&rsquo;s the truth. I never expected, look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to teaching a classroom, a seminar for graduate students with eight or nine or 10</p>
<p>students or a regular undergraduate class with 30 or an occasional introductory course</p>
<p>with a few hundred. I&rsquo;ve done all of those things many times. But an audience, you know,</p>
<p>that I can count in the hundreds of thousands on YouTube and all of that, no, that&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>LESTER Is there advice you can give, given your bold and nonstandard career and life, advice you</p>
<p>can give to high school students, college students about how to have a career like that, or maybe</p>
<p>how to have a career or a life they can be proud of? WOLFF Yeah. First of all, my advice is go for</p>
<p>it. The conditions for doing that now are infinitely better than they were when I had to do it.</p>
<p>And I could do it and I&rsquo;m happy I did it. Becoming a teacher is one of those decisions I made</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve never regretted. And I&rsquo;ve never regretted being a critic of this society,</p>
<p>ever. I find it edifying. I find it, I mean, the gratitude people express to me for helping them</p>
<p>see kind of what&rsquo;s going on is unbelievably encouraging. I mean, what can I tell you?</p>
<p>LESTER So that fills you, that fills you with joy. Pointing out that the Emperor has no clothes</p>
<p>fills you. That&rsquo;s a life not just important. WOLFF And you know why? It&rsquo;s because most of the people</p>
<p>who say something like that to me are people who, if they had the vocabulary, and some of them do,</p>
<p>would say, you know, I thought I was seeing through that outfit that I was wearing. I thought</p>
<p>it and they did. And all they needed was a little extra this information or that factoid or this</p>
<p>logic. And they have that. And I remember having that too. When I had a teacher who made something</p>
<p>clear that had been murky, I always felt gratitude. And now I get that gratitude a good bit.</p>
<p>And yes, it is enormously gratifying. And I&rsquo;m not sure I could get it any other way.</p>
<p>I have learned and I&rsquo;m walking proof that being a critic of society and doing it systematically</p>
<p>and sharing it with other people makes for a very good life. A very good life.</p>
<p>LESTER Speaking of which, however, one other aspect of human nature is that life comes to an end.</p>
<p>Do you think about your death? Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>WOLFF Afraid of it? No. Think about it? Yes. Yes. I&rsquo;m not afraid. I&rsquo;ve always thought,</p>
<p>you know, death is hard for the people that are left when you&rsquo;re dead. It&rsquo;s not going to bother</p>
<p>you very much. So I worry more about my wife. I&rsquo;m very attached to my wife. I might mention to you,</p>
<p>I got married when I was 23 years old. That&rsquo;s my wife to this day. So I&rsquo;m lucky because if you get</p>
<p>married to anybody in age 23, it&rsquo;s either luck or it isn&rsquo;t. LESTER What role has love played</p>
<p>in your life? WOLFF Enormous.</p>
<p>Because I came from a family, you know, if your family is political refugees, which mine were,</p>
<p>who had to interrupt their lives, moved to another continent, learn another language,</p>
<p>find another life, income and job. The disruption goes real deep for any refugee. So my mother and</p>
<p>father were both refugees. They met as refugees. So I had to, in a way, make it up to them. I had</p>
<p>to be, I was the first child of their younger sister, but the first child. And, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of psychological pressure on you if you&rsquo;re in that situation. Nobody means you harm,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got to do what they couldn&rsquo;t, what was shut off to them in a way they want you to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the closest they&rsquo;re going to get to what they had hoped. And my parents were both university</p>
<p>students. My father was a lawyer. My mother had to leave the university to run for her life.</p>
<p>So I had to perform. You know, I went to high school here in the United States. I had to get</p>
<p>all A&rsquo;s. I had to be on the football team. I had to play the violin in the orchestra. I had to</p>
<p>do all these because everything had to be achieved. So I&rsquo;m an achievement crazy person that</p>
<p>way. But that&rsquo;s functional in this dysfunctional society. But on top of that, that&rsquo;s an achievement</p>
<p>within the game of this particular society. But then love seems to be a thing that&rsquo;s greater</p>
<p>than that game. Is that something that made you a better person? Oh, God, yes. How is it</p>
<p>made you a better Marxian and a better human? Everything. Because my wife, by profession,</p>
<p>is a psychotherapist. Excellent. I love it. And I needed it. And so I married it. I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what I was doing at the time, but I think as I look back on it, that was more than a little what</p>
<p>was going on. And she has tutored me all my life about a whole range of aspects of life that my</p>
<p>family never talked about, never dealt with, never at least explicitly engaged in any of that.</p>
<p>Because it was all about survival. The immigrant challenge is survival. Survive. And you&rsquo;re so busy</p>
<p>that you tell yourself you can&rsquo;t do that. Of course you can. And there are other reasons</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re not going to look at those problems. But the survival is so urgent that you can fool</p>
<p>yourself this way. And my parents did that. One last question. What&rsquo;s the meaning of life,</p>
<p>Richard Wolff? Why are we here? I will quote you, Mr. Marx. Let&rsquo;s go. Life is struggle. And for me,</p>
<p>I have found that to be true. That the struggle, whether it is to build a relationship with your</p>
<p>child, I have two children, whether it&rsquo;s to build one with your spouse, whether it&rsquo;s to understand</p>
<p>a complicated argument and simplify it so that you can share the pleasure of understanding this</p>
<p>relationship to a student or to an audience. It&rsquo;s a struggle to do all those things. But that</p>
<p>network of struggles, that makes life interesting, intriguing, and satisfying.</p>
<p>And meaningful.</p>
<p>Very meaningful.</p>
<p>And that latter thing, I got to say, you do masterfully. You&rsquo;re one of the great communicators</p>
<p>and educators out there today. And it&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would sit with me for so many hours.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>This is awesome. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Wolff.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.</p>
<p>The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
