    <p>Our card this week is Deanna Patnode, the Four of Diamonds from Minnesota.</p>
<p>In 1982, 23-year-old Deanna disappeared without a trace from a bar in South St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Decades later, a deck of cards would lead to some closure for her family, but ultimately</p>
<p>leave everyone with more questions than answers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>In February of 2006, Jim Warren was taking on one of his first assignments after being</p>
<p>promoted to detective at the Wabasha County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office in Minnesota.</p>
<p>He was tasked with cleaning the evidence room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hazing, it&rsquo;s just maybe the old rookie, you know, you can clean that up for such a</p>
<p>first job.</p>
<p>So I was cleaning it out in evidence and I slid this box out and it had a white cover</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know what it was.</p>
<p>So I opened the box.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I don&rsquo;t know why I opened the box, I just did it.</p>
<p>And I looked down, I saw a skull, some bones and some clothes and I&rsquo;m like, what the heck</p>
<p>did I, what&rsquo;s going on here, you know?</p>
<p>So it kind of caught me off guard.</p>
<p>Detective Warren turned the box around and read, bones case, scribbled across the back,</p>
<p>meaning that the remains were unidentified.</p>
<p>He continued with cleaning the evidence room, but something wasn&rsquo;t sitting right with him.</p>
<p>The thought of a person with a whole life and a family just held in a box in some evidence</p>
<p>room, this is something Detective Warren couldn&rsquo;t get off his mind.</p>
<p>So he decided to ask to work the case.</p>
<p>Sheriff Rodney Barch remembers his interaction with the newly promoted Detective Well.</p>
<p>Jim here brought the remains in to me and said, can I work on this?</p>
<p>And my response was, what would you possibly do different than what they did back then?</p>
<p>And he said, well, there&rsquo;s some new technologies.</p>
<p>Not only had DNA improved leaps and bounds since the Jane Doe was found in 1989, but</p>
<p>Detective Warren reminded Sheriff Barch that the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension,</p>
<p>or BCA, was working on coming out with a brand new tool that other states had been using,</p>
<p>a cold case playing cards deck.</p>
<p>Detective Warren got the green light from Sheriff Barch, so he dove in headfirst, reviewing</p>
<p>all of the information in the case file.</p>
<p>But like most other Doe cases, there wasn&rsquo;t much for him to review.</p>
<p>With the information he did have, though, this was the narrative he compiled.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 20th, 1989, a group of three men were out in rural Wabasha County</p>
<p>hunting for mushrooms.</p>
<p>For some reason, they chose to scour a heavily wooded, steep slope that was the median between</p>
<p>the north and southbound lanes of Highway 61, just a few miles south of Kellogg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real heavy wooded area where nobody would go in there because you&rsquo;d have to cross</p>
<p>lanes of traffic even for the mushroom hunters to go down there and look.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m guessing that no one has been in that area before the mushroom hunters.</p>
<p>The mushroom hunters are looking for signs of mushrooms from different types of trees</p>
<p>that are dead, so hard to say why they even went and looked there when there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>other places to look, but we can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>It was there that the mushroom hunters found something that stopped them in their tracks.</p>
<p>About 60 feet away from the southbound lanes, wrapped around the trunk of a tree in kind</p>
<p>of a U-shape, was what appeared to be a human skeleton.</p>
<p>The hunters immediately contacted authorities who confirmed that the remains were human.</p>
<p>We had a full skull, both shoulder blades, rib cages, both femurs, so three quarters</p>
<p>of it was recovered.</p>
<p>It was immediately clear that the remains had been there for a while.</p>
<p>The bones were clean, like they didn&rsquo;t have any tissue on them, and some had vegetation</p>
<p>growing over them.</p>
<p>It was also obvious right away that it wasn&rsquo;t by accident that the body ended up in this</p>
<p>median about 60 feet away from the roadway.</p>
<p>It felt like it had been carefully placed there.</p>
<p>Once the coroner was called to the scene and collected the remains, investigators continued</p>
<p>searching the area for anything else that might give them a clue as to who this person</p>
<p>was or what happened to them.</p>
<p>I know that they were out there with metal detectors looking for possible jewelry or</p>
<p>any type of fillings that might have shown up, that might have come out of the, from</p>
<p>the jaw, and they didn&rsquo;t find anything else other than the skeletons that we ended up</p>
<p>recovering and then some clothes.</p>
<p>The clothes found were an off-white sweater with a collar covered in white buttons and</p>
<p>off-white striped knee-high socks.</p>
<p>Once the coroner examined the bones, he concluded that they belonged to a young woman, 20 to</p>
<p>30 years old, standing around 5 feet 1 inches to 5 feet 5 inches tall.</p>
<p>And because of the bleaching of the bones and the fact that vegetation had grown over</p>
<p>them, the coroner estimated that they had been there, hiding on that median, for about</p>
<p>five years.</p>
<p>If Bartch remembers, there was evidence of blunt force trauma to the skull, but the coroner</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t rule that as the cause of death.</p>
<p>Actually, he wasn&rsquo;t able to rule any cause of death because he had so little to work</p>
<p>with, which also meant that he couldn&rsquo;t rule a manner of death, like homicide, accident,</p>
<p>or natural causes.</p>
<p>But there was something he could tell from the skeleton.</p>
<p>The woman had been attacked, or maybe in some kind of accident, either at the time of her</p>
<p>death or shortly before she died.</p>
<p>She had a severe fracture of the upper right arm and a hip injury, both of which appeared</p>
<p>to be untreated.</p>
<p>Again, the coroner couldn&rsquo;t determine if those injuries were something she received</p>
<p>as she was killed, like if she had been beaten or hit by a car, or if they were something</p>
<p>suffered before her death that just went untreated.</p>
<p>Authorities got to work right away, trying to figure out who she was.</p>
<p>They compared the remains with missing persons reports from all over the state, but nothing</p>
<p>was matching up.</p>
<p>They even tried expanding their search to North and South Dakota, even Wisconsin and</p>
<p>Iowa, but still there was no one reported missing who matched their Jane Doe.</p>
<p>The only resource investigators had at their fingertips was the local media.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office put out a sketch done by an artist of what the woman may have looked</p>
<p>like in life, hoping to jog someone&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>When nothing really came of that, investigators then sent the skull off to state authorities</p>
<p>to have a clay composite made, which would be a bit more lifelike than the artist&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rendering.</p>
<p>Once completed, a photo of the clay composite was shared with the public.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a photo of it in the blog post for this episode at thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>But even with the more realistic rendering of what the woman probably looked like, still</p>
<p>no one was coming forward saying that they recognized her.</p>
<p>While they would give you a pretty realistic look, you&rsquo;d have to use your imagination</p>
<p>a little bit to put that clay structure to a real face.</p>
<p>And I think that was some of the problems back then.</p>
<p>Although investigators didn&rsquo;t know who this woman was, what caused her death, or even</p>
<p>if there was foul play involved, they wanted to cover all of their bases.</p>
<p>So they began questioning people.</p>
<p>The BC, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for the state of Minnesota, and our investigator,</p>
<p>and then the sheriff, investigated these three mushroom hunters and dead backgrounds to make</p>
<p>sure that, hey, is this legit or do we need to look into it?</p>
<p>Investigators determined that the hunters weren&rsquo;t suspicious and didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>more information to offer.</p>
<p>They truly just stumbled upon the woman&rsquo;s body and there was nothing more to it.</p>
<p>Police also questioned some people who&rsquo;d been working on Highway 61 and others who&rsquo;d</p>
<p>worked on the nearby railroad, but they didn&rsquo;t know anything either.</p>
<p>After that, the case just went cold.</p>
<p>For 17 years, this woman sat in a box on a shelf waiting for the right person to come</p>
<p>along.</p>
<p>Detective Warren knew he was that person and he was ready to spring into action.</p>
<p>I immediately jumped to this new technology of maybe sending the skull out because I looked</p>
<p>at the clay composite and said, well, the technology is a lot better today than it was.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first step I did.</p>
<p>Warren did some digging and found that Louisiana State University was renowned for the work</p>
<p>their anthropology unit was doing.</p>
<p>So he got in contact with them to see what options he had.</p>
<p>They said that they could make a realistic computer-enhanced clay facial reconstruction</p>
<p>and all they would need to do that was the skull.</p>
<p>So Detective Warren sent it off to be examined.</p>
<p>While he was waiting for the facial reconstruction results, he also looked into other ways of</p>
<p>figuring out the woman&rsquo;s identity, including getting her on the new cold case playing cards</p>
<p>deck that the BCA was putting together.</p>
<p>It proved to be a bit of an uphill battle though, because Wabasha County already had</p>
<p>a face on the deck, Donna Ingersoll, who we actually did an episode on last year.</p>
<p>You see, most of these decks aren&rsquo;t made up of just one department&rsquo;s cold cases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually a statewide thing and different agencies will submit the cases that they need</p>
<p>help with most.</p>
<p>So for a county inhabited by a fraction of a percent of the state&rsquo;s population, it seemed</p>
<p>like a stretch for them to get two of the 52 cases featured.</p>
<p>But Detective Warren was persistent and he convinced the BCA to put the Wabasha County</p>
<p>Jane Doe on a card.</p>
<p>He was hoping to have the new and improved facial reconstruction back from LSU before</p>
<p>the cards were printed, but the turnaround time was too tight.</p>
<p>They ended up having no other choice but to put the old original clay reconstruction on</p>
<p>the card instead.</p>
<p>In 2008, the playing cards were finally released.</p>
<p>They were handed out to 515 police departments and 75 jails.</p>
<p>And according to Pioneer Press, 10,000 decks were distributed to inmates at state prisons.</p>
<p>In addition to all of that, PDFs of the cards were posted online on the Minnesota Department</p>
<p>of Public Safety&rsquo;s website so anyone could see the cases featured.</p>
<p>To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, soon after their release, the playing cards generated a promising</p>
<p>tip.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks after the launch, a man was surfing the internet when he stumbled</p>
<p>across the playing cards on the department&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he saw the four of diamonds, the Wabasha County Jane Doe.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet from a press conference held by the BCA and the Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>He recognized the photo that was on the card as appearing to be similar to a neighbor of</p>
<p>his when he was growing up.</p>
<p>This neighbor disappeared when he was about 10 years old.</p>
<p>He relied on stories from his own family to kind of piece a few things together, and</p>
<p>he called in with this tip.</p>
<p>The neighbor he named was Deanna Patnode from Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, which is a</p>
<p>southern suburb of St. Paul.</p>
<p>BCA Assistant Superintendent Dave Bierga said one of their agents, quote, took this thing</p>
<p>and ran with it, end quote.</p>
<p>In December of 2008, investigators were able to track down a woman named Chloe Hughesby,</p>
<p>Deanna&rsquo;s older sister.</p>
<p>Chloe confirmed what the neighbor said, that her sister Deanna was missing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d never filed the missing persons report, but they hadn&rsquo;t seen or heard from her since</p>
<p>the early 80s.</p>
<p>There were records that the family had called police to say that they hadn&rsquo;t seen Deanna,</p>
<p>but they never filed an official report, which is why it was so hard to identify her remains.</p>
<p>I know her family cared, and I know there&rsquo;s still family around, but I have a hard time</p>
<p>wrapping my head around, if you called the police one time, then why wouldn&rsquo;t you follow up?</p>
<p>And maybe they said, we&rsquo;ll call back if she don&rsquo;t show up in two days, and that was just,</p>
<p>that was it.</p>
<p>That she went on vacation and she never came back.</p>
<p>As frustrating as it is, Detective Warren told us this isn&rsquo;t an uncommon thing to see</p>
<p>in cases from decades ago.</p>
<p>Things back then happened like that, where sometimes maybe the family didn&rsquo;t have trust</p>
<p>in law enforcement.</p>
<p>Maybe they called them and said they were good, and nothing ever was reported.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that for a fact, I can&rsquo;t blame anybody or point fingers, but to me, by reading</p>
<p>what I read, it sounds like maybe they didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d be found, or she was just common</p>
<p>to have her leave for a day or two, and that I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m just speculating.</p>
<p>But a lot of times that happens, and she was never seen again, and there was never, ever</p>
<p>a missing persons report made on her.</p>
<p>And again, times have changed, and we&rsquo;re not talking about a 12-year-old, we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about an adult, and a lot of times back then they&rsquo;d say, well, she&rsquo;s an adult, she can</p>
<p>go where she wants.</p>
<p>And missing persons were taken differently than they are today.</p>
<p>Reported or not, Deanna&rsquo;s family had felt the hole that her absence left in their family.</p>
<p>Chloe said she was dumbfounded and amazed when she got a call that her sister had possibly</p>
<p>been found.</p>
<p>It renewed a hope that she and her family had let go of long, long ago.</p>
<p>Now she was out of state by then, living in Iowa, but she was able to provide DNA for</p>
<p>comparison.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that in the press conference held by the BCA and the DOC, Chloe pronounced</p>
<p>her sister&rsquo;s name as Deanna, and unfortunately, we were unable to get a hold of her for an</p>
<p>interview, so for consistency&rsquo;s sake, we&rsquo;re pronouncing her name Deanna, which is how</p>
<p>detectives pronounce it.</p>
<p>Anyways, even before the results of the test came back, investigators were pretty convinced</p>
<p>that Deanna was indeed their Jane Doe.</p>
<p>Remember how I said that police initially thought the woman had been hit by a car or</p>
<p>in some kind of accident because she had some pretty severe injuries?</p>
<p>Well, investigators learned that Deanna had gotten badly hurt just a few months before</p>
<p>she vanished.</p>
<p>She jumped out of the back of a pickup, and no one knows why she jumped, but she jumped</p>
<p>out of a moving vehicle on a gravel road, and that caused a severe upper right arm fracture</p>
<p>and also an injury to her right hip.</p>
<p>Deanna&rsquo;s injuries perfectly matched up with what the coroner back in 1989 concluded from</p>
<p>the remains.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks after Chloe gave her DNA, everyone&rsquo;s suspicions were confirmed.</p>
<p>The test concluded, beyond all medical certainty, that the remains were Deanna Pattenoad.</p>
<p>As part of that process, another autopsy was completed, and this time, drawing from</p>
<p>his findings and the new information that they&rsquo;d learned, the medical examiner ruled</p>
<p>that Deanna&rsquo;s manner of death was homicide.</p>
<p>During the press conference held by the BCA and the DOC, Chloe described the mixed emotions</p>
<p>that came with the DNA match.</p>
<p>Grief for her sister&rsquo;s death, but at the same time, relief for finally having answers</p>
<p>after all of these years.</p>
<p>She said, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We just never thought that we&rsquo;d hear anything, and this is just phenomenal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so thankful that she got to be one of the playing cards because she wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be identified.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>I always expected her to walk through the door too, but no, it&rsquo;s Deanna,&rsquo; end quote.</p>
<p>Investigators were also glad to finally have a name for their Jane Doe and a level of closure</p>
<p>for Deanna&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>This was just the beginning of a brand new investigation.</p>
<p>How did she end up there and who killed her?</p>
<p>There was a problem.</p>
<p>Because she was never reported missing, that meant there wasn&rsquo;t another investigative</p>
<p>file out there that Detective Warren could piece together with his own.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d have to start from scratch, tracking the moments of someone who went missing 27</p>
<p>years before, which proved to be difficult because that meant that they&rsquo;d have to rely</p>
<p>on the memories of her friends and family from nearly three decades ago to piece together</p>
<p>a timeline of her last known movements.</p>
<p>Based on everyone&rsquo;s recollection, the last time Deanna was seen was on October 26, 1982.</p>
<p>She was out for a night with friends at the Buck Board Bar on Concord Boulevard in South</p>
<p>St. Paul, which is roughly 80 miles away from where she was found in Wapishaw County.</p>
<p>Friends who were with her at the bar that night recalled that at some point they saw</p>
<p>her leaving with someone else.</p>
<p>Now at first it was reported that she was seen leaving with a friend, but later that</p>
<p>was changed to her seen leaving with an unknown man.</p>
<p>Now because this happened nearly 30 years prior, the friends couldn&rsquo;t recall what the</p>
<p>man even looked like.</p>
<p>Like no guess at height, build, hair color, age, none of that.</p>
<p>Which I mean that was at least something because it probably meant this guy wasn&rsquo;t someone</p>
<p>her friends knew, so he likely wasn&rsquo;t a close friend of Deanna&rsquo;s and probably wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>someone who went to that bar a lot.</p>
<p>The friends also weren&rsquo;t able to provide a vehicle description, but it&rsquo;s not super</p>
<p>clear if they even saw her get into a car with this mystery man at all.</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s very possible that she just walked out of the bar with the man and then</p>
<p>they went their separate ways.</p>
<p>South St. Paul is only a few miles from Inver Grove Heights, so maybe she tried to walk</p>
<p>home and got abducted on the way.</p>
<p>Or maybe she tried to hitchhike, which investigators learned she wasn&rsquo;t against doing.</p>
<p>If that was the case, maybe she got picked up by a shady character along the way.</p>
<p>Regardless, it seemed like the last person who saw Deanna would have been this man that</p>
<p>she was seen leaving with.</p>
<p>It would have been great to track him down, but with literally no physical description</p>
<p>to go from, this task was impossible.</p>
<p>So they had to keep moving in directions that actually let them press forward.</p>
<p>Detectives learned more about Deanna, and they confirmed that she had no ties whatsoever</p>
<p>to the Wabasha County area where she was found.</p>
<p>Which meant it was unlikely that she just happened to be in that area and ran into someone.</p>
<p>She was taken there.</p>
<p>Detectives continued trying to track down people who may have been with or seen Deanna</p>
<p>the night she disappeared from the Buck Board Bar.</p>
<p>But the investigation eventually came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where things were when our reporting team went to Minnesota in September to interview</p>
<p>Warren, who is now the Chief Deputy at the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>But then, in January of this year, literally after this episode was written, our reporter</p>
<p>got a call from Warren.</p>
<p>He said that he was going through the case file again when he found something interesting</p>
<p>that he hadn&rsquo;t come across before.</p>
<p>Right around the time detectives were diving deep into Deanna&rsquo;s life in 2009, the Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office got a call from someone that we&rsquo;ve been asked to not identify.</p>
<p>And this person said that their relative lived in the same neighborhood as Deanna when she</p>
<p>disappeared.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the relative they&rsquo;re referring to?</p>
<p>Donald Blum.</p>
<p>That name might ring a bell for some of you, because in 2000, Blum was arrested for the</p>
<p>1999 kidnapping and murder of 19-year-old Katie Poyer in Northeastern Minnesota.</p>
<p>He abducted her while she was working the night shift alone at a convenience store,</p>
<p>and her remains were found on his property a few weeks later.</p>
<p>In addition to the Poyer murder, Blum was involved in five other cases of kidnapping</p>
<p>and or sexual assault.</p>
<p>From what Warren can tell, back then, the Sheriff wrote to him in the out-of-state prison</p>
<p>where he was serving his time.</p>
<p>Blum never responded, though, and investigators had nothing on him other than that statement</p>
<p>from the relative.</p>
<p>So they kind of just left it alone, and it faded from everyone&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>But with where they were now, Chief Deputy Warren felt like every dead end was worth</p>
<p>reexamining.</p>
<p>So he decided to do some digging.</p>
<p>He found that Blum was no longer being held in that out-of-state prison, which was in</p>
<p>Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>He had recently been moved to a prison right there in Minnesota, which meant it&rsquo;d be much</p>
<p>more feasible to go in person and talk with him.</p>
<p>Chief Deputy Warren also discovered that Blum might have been familiar with Highway 61,</p>
<p>where Deanna&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>So he was having a good feeling about this.</p>
<p>After all of these years, maybe the answer was right in front of them all along.</p>
<p>So he jumped right into action, wanting to interview him sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>We actually held off on releasing this episode so we could let you all know how that interview</p>
<p>went.</p>
<p>But, of course, it wasn&rsquo;t that easy.</p>
<p>That first call from Warren came to us on January 3rd.</p>
<p>He said that he planned to talk with Blum in just a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>But then we got another call on January 10th, literal days before Warren planned to meet</p>
<p>with him, Blum died in prison.</p>
<p>A DOC spokesperson said that his death was expected and due to illness.</p>
<p>Now, when I heard the news of Blum&rsquo;s death, my jaw dropped.</p>
<p>And I can only imagine how Chief Deputy Warren was feeling, having been that close to speaking</p>
<p>with one of the only potential persons of interest in a decades-old case, only for him</p>
<p>to die days before he was going to speak with him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>This is the prime example, though, of everything the deck is about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re lifting off these old cases, getting new eyes and ears on them while we can, because</p>
<p>time is precious.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re losing witnesses, persons of interest, people with information every single day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important that we talk about these cases now while we still have time.</p>
<p>Now though Blum is dead, Warren says he&rsquo;s not letting the lead die with him.</p>
<p>There are other avenues that he&rsquo;ll be chasing down in the near future, such as interviewing</p>
<p>those who knew Blum in hopes of getting answers.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s this lead that solves the case or one that comes years down the road,</p>
<p>Warren told our reporting team that he&rsquo;s hoping this case won&rsquo;t be cold for much longer.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s glad that he picked up that cardboard box all those years ago.</p>
<p>You ask me why I wanted to work on it, well, nothing&rsquo;s going to get solved unless you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work on it, right?</p>
<p>So you got to imagine when you go to work on something and you got, let&rsquo;s say, other</p>
<p>people in your profession and even outside people saying, well, what are you, some guru?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, it&rsquo;s not going to get solved unless you work on it.</p>
<p>And then it turns out, well, you got lucky.</p>
<p>Yeah, we did get lucky, but guess what?</p>
<p>We got lucky because we worked on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist.</p>
<p>And anything could bust at any time if you just work on it, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not feeling like confident.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very hopeful that every swing we take, it connects to something and it won&rsquo;t connect</p>
<p>with nothing if we don&rsquo;t try and go up there and find out, right?</p>
<p>So I guess I&rsquo;m instead of confident, I&rsquo;m just hopeful that it&rsquo;s going to get solved, not</p>
<p>just because of this tip, but because of, I don&rsquo;t know, continuing to work on it.</p>
<p>We asked Chief Deputy Warren and Sheriff Barge what they think happened to Deanna back in</p>
<p>1982.</p>
<p>Well, no doubt we think she got into a vehicle with someone.</p>
<p>There is no idea or no evidence to conclude that there was any type of assault on her</p>
<p>sexually or not, but we assume that an altercation occurred somewhere there or on the way down</p>
<p>here on Highway 61 where she ended up in our county.</p>
<p>But outside of that, we just have, we have no idea how to put it together.</p>
<p>She could have had an altercation with somebody.</p>
<p>She could have been, for all we know, she could have been stabbed.</p>
<p>We know she wasn&rsquo;t shot.</p>
<p>She could have been strangled.</p>
<p>She could have hit her head on a curb and died, maybe intoxicated and the person freaked</p>
<p>out, but that&rsquo;s a long ways to bring a body.</p>
<p>Something tells me that the person that did this knew the area of Highway 61 well enough</p>
<p>to come down here and possibly leave her on the way to maybe a different state.</p>
<p>Sheriff Barge said the fact that the two crime scenes are nearly 80 miles apart has complicated</p>
<p>the investigation.</p>
<p>I think one of the issues here is location.</p>
<p>That while her body was placed here in the woods, we don&rsquo;t think the crime happened here.</p>
<p>I think the crime happened someplace else and then she was placed here, either by a</p>
<p>trucker or somebody that was just driving, needed to drive through this area, knew that</p>
<p>area. So there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of tips that came in, I think, and that was probably location</p>
<p>was more than anything in regards to, to tips.</p>
<p>Although Deanna&rsquo;s loved ones have gotten the closure of finding her and knowing she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not missing anymore, Sheriff Barge says he hopes this isn&rsquo;t the only closure they get.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we&rsquo;ll be thinking about the Pattenwood family and then her close friends</p>
<p>as well to put some closure on it for them, because I know this isn&rsquo;t closed for them.</p>
<p>I know that they think about it every day in regards to what happened to her.</p>
<p>I know they&rsquo;re grateful that she was identified so that they could put her remains to rest.</p>
<p>But the other part of this would be so concerning for them as it would any of us if her</p>
<p>family members had had something like this happen to them.</p>
<p>And it was never determined how or who did it, because that closure always or sometimes</p>
<p>comes with somebody being held accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re certainly hopeful and hoping for that outcome in this case.</p>
<p>Chief Deputy Warren said that he knows people out there have the answers he&rsquo;s looking for,</p>
<p>and he hopes that those people are listening to this podcast.</p>
<p>He said no bit of information is too small because it could be the missing piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Just anything they knew about that evening, anything they knew, if they had a description</p>
<p>of a vehicle that she would have gotten in or the guy that she was with, if they were</p>
<p>in the bar and didn&rsquo;t see her, but they knew for their friends that they were with that</p>
<p>evening, that we could have other people to talk to.</p>
<p>So just anything about that night and anything about that bar, including if they knew of</p>
<p>people that went into that bar that they might question from time to time in regards to who</p>
<p>they were and if they felt uneasy about this person being in the bar or if he looked at</p>
<p>females a different way.</p>
<p>Anything like that could be very helpful today.</p>
<p>If you know anything about the murder of Deanna Patnode, or if you were at the Buckford Bar</p>
