    <p>I believe our official scientific worldview is incompatible with the reality of consciousness.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>We could be in the matrix, this could be a very vivid dream.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a few people that are now visualizing a pink elephant.</p>
<p>A hamster has consciousness.</p>
<p>Except for cats who are evil automatons that are void of consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness is the basis of moral value, moral concern.</p>
<p>Do you think there will be a time in like 20, 30, 50 years when we&rsquo;re not morally okay turning off the power to a robot?</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Philip Goff.</p>
<p>Philosopher specializing in the philosophy of mind and consciousness.</p>
<p>He is a panpsychist, which means he believes that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous</p>
<p>feature of physical reality, of all matter in the universe.</p>
<p>He is the author of Galileo&rsquo;s Error, Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness,</p>
<p>and is the host of an excellent podcast called Mind Chat.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Philip Goff.</p>
<p>I opened my second podcast conversation with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>With a question about consciousness and panpsychism.</p>
<p>The question was, quote, does consciousness permeate all matter?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I opened the conversation this way.</p>
<p>He looked at me like, what the hell is this guy talking about?</p>
<p>So he said no, because we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell if it did or not.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s outside the realm of the scientific method.</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with Elon Musk&rsquo;s answer?</p>
<p>I disagree, I guess I do think consciousness pervades matter.</p>
<p>In fact, I think consciousness is the ultimate nature of matter.</p>
<p>So as for whether it&rsquo;s outside of the scientific method, I think there&rsquo;s a fundamental challenge</p>
<p>at the heart of the science of consciousness that we need to face up to, which is that</p>
<p>consciousness is not publicly observable.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t look inside your head and see your feelings and experiences.</p>
<p>We know about consciousness not from doing experiments or public observation.</p>
<p>We just know about it from our immediate awareness of our feelings and experiences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s qualitative, not quantitative, as you talk about.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s another aspect of it.</p>
<p>So there are a couple of reasons consciousness, I think, is not fully susceptible to the standard</p>
<p>scientific approach.</p>
<p>One reason you&rsquo;ve just raised is that it&rsquo;s qualitative rather than quantitative.</p>
<p>Another reason is it&rsquo;s not publicly observable.</p>
<p>So science is used to dealing with unobservables, fundamental particles, quantum wave functions,</p>
<p>other universes, none of these things are observable.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an important difference.</p>
<p>With all these things, we postulate unobservables in order to explain what we can observe.</p>
<p>In the whole of science, that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>In the case of consciousness, in the unique case of consciousness, the thing we are trying</p>
<p>to explain is not publicly observable.</p>
<p>And that is utterly unique.</p>
<p>If we want to fully bring science into consciousness, we need a more expansive conception of the</p>
<p>scientific method.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t explain consciousness scientifically, but we need to rethink what</p>
<p>science is.</p>
<p>What do you mean publicly, the word publicly observable?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to be said about the word publicly?</p>
<p>I suppose versus privately.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s tricky to define, but I suppose the data of physics are available to anybody.</p>
<p>If there were aliens who visited us from another planet, maybe they&rsquo;d have very different sense</p>
<p>organs.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;d struggle to understand our art or our music.</p>
<p>But if they were intelligent enough to do mathematics, they could understand our physics.</p>
<p>They could look at the data of our experiments.</p>
<p>They could run the experiments themselves.</p>
<p>Whereas consciousness, is it observable?</p>
<p>Is it not observable?</p>
<p>In a sense, it&rsquo;s observable.</p>
<p>As you say, we could say it&rsquo;s privately observable.</p>
<p>I am directly aware of my own feelings and experiences.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m in pain, it&rsquo;s just right there for me.</p>
<p>My pain is just totally directly evident to me.</p>
<p>But you from the outside cannot directly access my pain.</p>
<p>You can access my pain behavior, or you can ask me, but you can&rsquo;t access my pain in the</p>
<p>way that I can access my pain.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a distinction.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to totally pin it down how we define those things, but I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fairly clear and very important difference there.</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s a kind of direct observation that you&rsquo;re able to do of your pain that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>So my observation, all the ways in which I can sneak up to observing your pain is indirect</p>
<p>versus yours is direct.</p>
<p>Can you play devil&rsquo;s advocate?</p>
<p>Is it possible for me to get closer and closer and closer to being able to observe your pain,</p>
<p>like all the subjective experiences, yours in the way that you do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so of course, it&rsquo;s not that we observe behavior and then we make an inference.</p>
<p>We are hardwired to instinctively interpret smiles as happiness, crying as sadness.</p>
<p>And as we get to know someone, we find it very easy to adopt their perspective, get</p>
<p>into their shoes.</p>
<p>But strictly speaking, all we have perceptual access to is someone&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>And if you were just, strictly speaking, if you were trying to explain someone&rsquo;s behavior,</p>
<p>those aspects that are publicly observable, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ever have recourse to</p>
<p>attribute consciousness.</p>
<p>You could just postulate some kind of mechanism if you were just trying to explain the behavior.</p>
<p>So someone like Daniel Dennett is very consistent on this.</p>
<p>So I think for most people, what science is in the business of is explaining the data</p>
<p>of public observation experiment.</p>
<p>If you religiously followed that, you would not postulate consciousness because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a datum that&rsquo;s known about in that way.</p>
<p>And Daniel Dennett is really consistent on this.</p>
<p>He thinks my consciousness cannot be empirically verified and therefore it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Dennett is consistent on this.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m consistent on this.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of people have a slightly confused middle way position on this.</p>
<p>On the one hand, they think the business of science is just to account for public observation</p>
<p>experiment, but on the other hand, they also believe in consciousness without appreciating,</p>
<p>I think, that that implies that there is another datum over and above the data of public observation</p>
<p>experiments, namely just the reality of feelings and experiences.</p>
<p>As we walk along this conversation, you keep opening doors that I don&rsquo;t want to walk into</p>
<p>and I will, but I want to try to stay kind of focused.</p>
<p>You mentioned Daniel Dennett, let&rsquo;s lay it out since he sticks to his story, pun unintended,</p>
<p>and then you stick to yours.</p>
<p>What is your story?</p>
<p>What is your theory of consciousness versus his?</p>
<p>Can you clarify his position?</p>
<p>So my view, I defend the view known as panpsychism, which is the view that consciousness is a</p>
<p>fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t literally mean that everything is conscious despite the meaning of the word</p>
<p>pan, everything, psyche, mind, so literally that means everything has mind, but the typical</p>
<p>commitment of the panpsychist is that the fundamental building blocks of reality, maybe</p>
<p>fundamental particles like electrons and quarks, have incredibly simple forms of experience</p>
<p>and that the very complex experience of the human or animal brain is somehow rooted in</p>
<p>or derived from this much more simple consciousness at the level of fundamental physics.</p>
<p>So I mean that&rsquo;s a theory that I would justify on the grounds that it can account for this</p>
<p>datum of consciousness that we are immediately aware of in our experience in a way that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think other theories can. If you asked me to contrast that to Daniel Dennett, I think</p>
<p>he would just say there is no such datum. Dennett says the data for science of consciousness</p>
<p>is what he calls heterophenomenology, which is specifically defined as what we can access</p>
<p>from the third person perspective, including what people say, but crucially, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>treating what they say. We&rsquo;re not relying on their testimony as evidence for some</p>
<p>unobservable realm of feelings and experiences. We&rsquo;re just treating what they say as a datum</p>
<p>of public observation experiments that we can account for in terms of underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>But I feel like there&rsquo;s a deeper view of what consciousness is. So you have a very clear,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk quite a bit about panpsychism, but you have a clear view of what, you know,</p>
<p>almost like a physics view of consciousness. He, I think, has a kind of unique view of</p>
<p>you that consciousness is almost a side effect of this massively parallel computation system</p>
<p>going on in our brain, that the brain has a model of the world and it&rsquo;s taking in perceptions</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s constantly weaving multiple stories about that world that&rsquo;s integrating the new</p>
<p>perceptions and the multiple stories are somehow, it&rsquo;s like a Google doc, collaborative editing,</p>
<p>and that collaborative editing is the actual experience of what we think of as consciousness.</p>
<p>Somehow the editing is consciousness of this, of this story. I mean, that&rsquo;s a theory of</p>
<p>consciousness, isn&rsquo;t it? The narrative theory of consciousness or the multiple versions</p>
<p>editing, collaborative editing of a narrative theory of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, he calls it the multiple drafts model. Incidentally, there&rsquo;s a very interesting paper</p>
<p>just come out by very good philosopher Luke Roloff&rsquo;s defending a panpsychist version</p>
<p>of Dennett&rsquo;s multiple drafts model.</p>
<p>Like a deeper turtle that that turtle is stacked on top of.</p>
<p>Just the difference being that this is Luke Roloff&rsquo;s view, all of the drafts are conscious.</p>
<p>So I guess for Dennett, there&rsquo;s sort of no fact of the matter about which of these drafts</p>
<p>is the correct one. On Roloff&rsquo;s view, maybe there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter about which</p>
<p>of these drafts is my consciousness, but nonetheless, all the drafts correspond to</p>
<p>some consciousness. And I mean, it just sounds kind of funny. I guess I think he calls it</p>
<p>Dennettian panpsychism. But Luke is one of the most rigorous and serious philosophers</p>
<p>alive at the moment, I think. And I hate having Luke Roloff&rsquo;s in an audience if I&rsquo;m giving a</p>
<p>talk because he always cuts straight to the weakness in your position that you hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>thought of. And so it&rsquo;s nice, panpsychism is sometimes associated with fluffy thinking,</p>
<p>but contemporary panpsychists have come out of this tradition we call analytic philosophy,</p>
<p>which is rooted in detailed, rigorous argumentation. And it is defended in that manner.</p>
<p>Yeah. Those analytic philosophers are sticklers for terminology. It&rsquo;s very fun,</p>
<p>very fun group to talk shit with.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I mean, it gets boring if you just start and end defining words, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think starting with defining words is good. Actually, the philosopher Derek Parfitt said</p>
<p>when he first was thinking about philosophy, he went to a talk in analytic philosophy,</p>
<p>and he went to a talk in continental philosophy, and he decided that the problem with the</p>
<p>continental philosophy, if it was really unrigorous, really imprecise, the problem</p>
<p>with the analytic philosophy is it was just not about anything important. And he thought</p>
<p>there was more chance of working within analytic philosophy and asking some more meaningful,</p>
<p>some more profound questions than there was in working in continental philosophy and making it</p>
<p>more rigorous. Now, they&rsquo;re both horrific stereotypes, and I don&rsquo;t want to get nasty</p>
<p>emails from either of these groups, but there&rsquo;s something to what he was saying there.</p>
<p>I think just a tiny tangent on terminology. I do think that there&rsquo;s a lot of deep</p>
<p>insight to be discovered by just asking questions. What do we mean by this word?</p>
<p>I remember I was taking a course on algorithms and data structures in computer science,</p>
<p>and the instructor, shout out to him, Ali Chakrafande, amazing professor, I remember</p>
<p>he asked some basic questions like, what is an algorithm? The pressure of pushing students to</p>
<p>answer, to think deeply, you know, you just woke up hungover in college or whatever,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re tasked with answering some deep philosophical question about what is an</p>
<p>algorithm? These basic questions, and they sound very simple, but they&rsquo;re actually very difficult.</p>
<p>And one of the things I really value in conversation is asking these dumb, simple</p>
<p>questions of like, you know, what is intelligence? And just continually asking that question over and</p>
<p>over of some of the sort of biggest research in the researchers in the artificial intelligence</p>
<p>computer science space is actually very useful. At the same time, you know, it should start a</p>
<p>terminology and then progress where you kind of say, fuck it, we&rsquo;ll just assume we know what we</p>
<p>mean by that. Otherwise, you get the Bill Clinton situation where it&rsquo;s like, what is the meaning of</p>
<p>is, is whatever he said, it&rsquo;s like, hey, man, did you do the sex stuff or not? Yeah. So there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you have to both be able to talk about the sex stuff and the meaning of the word is.</p>
<p>With consciousness, because we don&rsquo;t currently understand, you know, very much terminology</p>
<p>discussions are very important because it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re almost trying to sneak, sneak up to some</p>
<p>deep insight by just discussing some basic terminology, you know, like what is consciousness</p>
<p>or even defining the different aspects of panpsychism is fascinating. But just to linger</p>
<p>on the Daniel Dennett thing, what do you think about narrative, sort of the mind constructing</p>
<p>narratives for ourselves? So there&rsquo;s nothing special about consciousness deeply. It is some</p>
<p>property of the human mind that&rsquo;s just is able to tell these pretty stories that we experience as</p>
<p>consciousness and that it&rsquo;s unique perhaps to the human mind, which is, I suppose, what Daniel</p>
<p>Dennett would argue that it&rsquo;s either deeply unique or mostly unique to the human mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just on the question of terminology before. Yes, I think it used to be the fashion among</p>
<p>philosophers that we had to come up with utterly precise, necessary and sufficient conditions for</p>
<p>each word. And then I think this has gone out of fashion a bit, partly because it&rsquo;s just been,</p>
<p>you know, such a failure. The word knowledge in particular, people used to define knowledge as</p>
<p>true justified belief. And then this guy Gettier had this very short paper where he just produced</p>
<p>some pretty conclusive counter examples to that. I think, you know, he wrote very few papers,</p>
<p>but this is just, you know, you have to teach this on an undergraduate philosophy course.</p>
<p>And then after that, you had a huge literature of people trying to address this and propose a</p>
<p>new definition, but then someone else would come out with counter examples and then you get a new</p>
<p>definition of knowledge and counter examples and it just went on and on and never seemed to get</p>
<p>anywhere. So I think the thought now is let&rsquo;s work out how precise we need to be for what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to do. And I think that&rsquo;s a healthier attitude. So precision is important, but you</p>
<p>just need to work out how precise do we need to be for these purposes. Coming to Dennett and</p>
<p>narrative theories, I mean, I think narrative theories are a plausible contender for a theory</p>
<p>of the self, theory of my identity over time, what makes me the same person in some sense today as I</p>
<p>was 20 years ago, given that I&rsquo;ve changed so much physically and psychologically. One running</p>
<p>contender is something connected to the kind of stories we tell about ourselves or maybe some</p>
<p>story about the psychological, the chains of psychological continuity. I&rsquo;m not saying I accept</p>
<p>such a theory, but it&rsquo;s plausible. I don&rsquo;t think these theories are good as theories of consciousness,</p>
<p>at least if we&rsquo;re taking consciousness just to be subjective experience, pleasure, pain, seeing</p>
<p>color, hearing sound. I think a hamster has consciousness in that sense. There&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like to be a hamster. It feels pain if you stand on it. If you&rsquo;re cruel enough to do,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I gave that. People always give, I don&rsquo;t know, philosophers give these very violent</p>
<p>examples to get the cross consciousness and it&rsquo;s, yeah, I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>about, but anyway. You say mean things to the hamster. It experiences pain, it experiences</p>
<p>pleasure, joy. I mean, but there&rsquo;s some limits to that experience of a hamster,</p>
<p>but there is nevertheless the presence of a subjective experience. Yeah. Consciousness is</p>
<p>just something, I mean, it&rsquo;s a very ambiguous word, but if we&rsquo;re just using it to mean some</p>
<p>kind of experience, some kind of inner life, that is pretty widespread in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>A bit difficult to say where it stops, where it starts, but you certainly don&rsquo;t need something</p>
<p>as sophisticated as the capacity to self consciously tell stories about yourself to just</p>
<p>have experience. Except for cats who are evil automatons that are void of consciousness. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the fingertips of the devil. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I was taking that as read. I mean, Descartes</p>
<p>thought animals were mechanisms and humans are unique. So animals are robots essentially in the</p>
<p>formulation of Descartes and humans are unique. Yeah. So in which way would you say humans are</p>
<p>unique versus even our closest ancestors? Like, is there something special about humans?</p>
<p>What is in your view under the panpsychism? I guess we&rsquo;re walking backwards because we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have the big picture conversation about what is panpsychism, but given your kind of broad theory</p>
<p>of consciousness, what&rsquo;s unique about humans, do you think? As a panpsychist, there is a great</p>
<p>continuity between humans and the rest of the universe. There&rsquo;s nothing that special about</p>
<p>human consciousness. It&rsquo;s just a highly evolved form of what exists throughout the universe.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re very much continuous with the rest of the physical universe. What is unique about human</p>
<p>beings? I suppose the capacity to reflect on our conscious experience, plan for the future,</p>
<p>the capacity, I would say, to respond to reasons as well. I mean, animals in some sense have</p>
<p>motivations, but when a human being makes a decision, they&rsquo;re responding to what philosophers</p>
<p>called normative considerations. You know, if you&rsquo;re saying, should I take this job in the U.S.?</p>
<p>You weigh it up. You say, well, you know, I&rsquo;ll get more money. I&rsquo;ll have maybe a better quality</p>
<p>of life. But if I stay in the UK, I&rsquo;ll be closer to family. And you weigh up these considerations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure any nonhuman animals quite respond to considerations of value in that way. I mean,</p>
<p>I might be reflecting here that I&rsquo;m something of an objectivist about value. I think there are</p>
<p>objective facts about what we have reason to do and what we have reason to believe.</p>
<p>And humans have access to those facts.</p>
<p>And humans have access to them and can respond to them. That&rsquo;s a controversial claim. You know,</p>
<p>many of my panpsychist brethren might not go for that.</p>
<p>They would say the hamster, too, can look up to the stars and ponder theoretical physics.</p>
<p>Maybe not, but I think it depends what you think about value. If you have a more</p>
<p>Humean picture of value, by which I mean, relating to the philosopher David Hume,</p>
<p>who said reason is the slave of the passions. Really, we just have motivations</p>
<p>and what we have reason to do arises from our motivations. I&rsquo;m not a Humean. I think there are</p>
<p>objective facts about what we have reason to do. And I think we have access to them. I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>any nonhuman animal has access to objective facts about what they have reason to do, what they have</p>
<p>reason to believe. They don&rsquo;t weigh up evidence. Reason is a slave of the passions.</p>
<p>Matthew That was David Hume&rsquo;s view, yeah. I mean, yeah, do you want to know my problem with Hume&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I had a radical conversion. This might not be connected. It&rsquo;s not connected to panpsychism,</p>
<p>but I had a radical conversion. I used to have a more Humean view when I was a graduate student,</p>
<p>but I was persuaded by some professors at the University of Reading where I was</p>
<p>that if you have the Humean view, you have to say any basic life goals are equal, equally valid.</p>
<p>So for example, let&rsquo;s take someone whose basic goal in life is counting blades of grass, right?</p>
<p>And crucially, they don&rsquo;t enjoy it, right? This is the crucial point. They get no pleasure from it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just their basic goal to spend their life counting as many blades of grass</p>
<p>as possible. Not for some greater goal. That&rsquo;s just their basic goal.</p>
<p>I want to say that that is objectively stupid. That is objectively pointless.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say stupid. It&rsquo;s objectively pointless in a way that pursuing pleasure</p>
<p>or pursuing someone else&rsquo;s pleasure or pursuing scientific inquiry is not pointless.</p>
<p>As soon as you make that admission, you&rsquo;re not a follower of David Hume anymore. You think</p>
<p>there are objective facts about what goals are worth pursuing.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have a goal without pleasure? So this kind of idea that you disjoint the two.</p>
<p>So the David Foster Wallace idea of, you know, the key to life is to be unboreable.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it possible to discover the pleasure in everything in life? The counting of the</p>
<p>blades of grass. Once you see the mastery, the skill of it, you can discover the pleasure.</p>
<p>Therefore, you know, I guess what I&rsquo;m asking is why and when and how did you lose the romance</p>
<p>in grad school? Is that what you&rsquo;re trying to say?</p>
<p>I think it may or may not be true that it&rsquo;s possible to find pleasure in everything.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also true that people don&rsquo;t act solely for pleasure. And they certainly</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t act solely for their own pleasure. People will suffer for things they think are worthwhile.</p>
<p>I might, you know, I might suffer for some scientific cause for finding out a cure for</p>
<p>the pandemic. And in terms of my own pleasure, I might have less pleasure in doing that. But I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s worthwhile. It&rsquo;s a worthwhile thing to do. I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the case that</p>
<p>everything we do is rooted in maximizing our own pleasure. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>psychologically plausible.</p>
<p>But pleasure, then that&rsquo;s a narrow kind of view of pleasure. That&rsquo;s like a short term</p>
<p>pleasure. But you can see pleasure is a kind of ability to hear the music in the distance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yes, it&rsquo;s difficult now. It&rsquo;s suffering now. But there&rsquo;s some greater thing beyond</p>
<p>the mountain. That will be joy. I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of a, even if it&rsquo;s not in this life.</p>
<p>Well, you know, the warriors will meet in Valhalla, right? The feeling that gives meaning</p>
<p>and fulfillment to life is not necessarily grounded in pleasure of like the counting</p>
<p>of the grass. It&rsquo;s something else. I don&rsquo;t know. The struggle is a source of deep fulfillment.</p>
<p>So like, I think pleasure needs to be kind of thought of as a little bit more broadly.</p>
<p>It just kind of gives you this sense. It for a moment allows you to forget the terror of</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re going to die. That&rsquo;s pleasure. Like that&rsquo;s the broader view of</p>
<p>pleasure that you get to kind of play in the little illusion that all of this has deep</p>
<p>meaning. That&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, but I mean, you know, people sacrifice their lives. Atheists may sacrifice their</p>
<p>lives for the sake of someone else or for the sake of something important enough. And</p>
<p>clearly in that case, they&rsquo;re not doing it for the sake of their own pleasure. That&rsquo;s a rather</p>
<p>dramatic example, but they can be just trivial examples where, you know, I choose to be honest</p>
<p>rather than lie about something. Can I lose out a bit? And I have a bit less pleasure, but I thought</p>
<p>it was worth doing the honest thing or something. I mean, I just think, so that&rsquo;s a, I mean, maybe</p>
<p>you can use the word pleasure so broadly that you&rsquo;re just essentially meaning something.</p>
<p>Worthwhile, but then I think the word pleasure, maybe, maybe loses its meaning.</p>
<p>Sure. Well, but what do you think about the blades of grass case? What do you think about</p>
<p>someone who spends their life counting blades of grass and doesn&rsquo;t enjoy it?</p>
<p>So I think, I personally think it&rsquo;s impossible or maybe I&rsquo;m not understanding even like the</p>
<p>philosophical formulation, but I think it&rsquo;s impossible to have a goal and not draw pleasure</p>
<p>from it. Make it worthwhile, forget the word pleasure. I think the word goal loses meaning.</p>
<p>If I say I&rsquo;m going to count the number of pens on this table, if I&rsquo;m actively involved in the task,</p>
<p>I will find joy in it. I will find, like, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of meaning and joy to be discovered</p>
<p>in the skill of a task, in mastering of a skill and taking pride in doing it well. I mean, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is about the human mind, but there&rsquo;s some joy to be discovered in the mastery</p>
<p>of a skill. So I think it&rsquo;s just impossible to count blades of grass and not sort of have the</p>
<p>gyro dreams of sushi compelling, like draws you into the mastery of the simple task.</p>
<p>Hmm. Yeah, I suppose, I mean, in a way you might think it&rsquo;s just hard to imagine someone who would</p>
<p>spend their lives doing that, but then maybe that&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s so evident that that is</p>
<p>a pointless task. Whereas if we take this David Hume view seriously, it ought to be, you know,</p>
<p>a totally possible life goal. Whereas, I mean, yeah, I guess I just find it hard to shake the</p>
<p>idea that some ways of some life goals are more worthwhile than others. And it doesn&rsquo;t mean,</p>
<p>you know, that there&rsquo;s a one single way you should lead your life, but pursuing knowledge,</p>
<p>helping people, pursuing your own pleasure to an extent are worthwhile things to do in a way that,</p>
<p>you know, for example, I have, I&rsquo;m a little bit OCD. I still feel inclined to walk on cracks in</p>
<p>the pavement or do it symmetrically. Like if I step on a crack with my left foot, I feel the need</p>
<p>to do it with my right foot. And I think that&rsquo;s kind of pointless. It&rsquo;s something I feel the urge</p>
<p>to do, but it&rsquo;s pointless. Whereas other things I choose to do, I think there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s worth doing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to make sense of metaphysically, what could possibly ground that? How could we</p>
<p>know about these facts? But that&rsquo;s the starting point for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I think you walking on the sidewalk in a way that&rsquo;s symmetrical brings order to the</p>
<p>world. Like if you weren&rsquo;t doing that, the world might fall apart. And you, it feels like that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s meaning in that. Like you embracing the full, like the full</p>
<p>experience of that, you living the richness of that as if it has meaning, will give meaning to it.</p>
<p>And then whatever genius comes of that as you as a one little intelligent aunt will make a better</p>
<p>life for everybody else. Perhaps I&rsquo;m defending the blades of grass example, because I can literally</p>
<p>imagine myself enjoying this task as somebody who&rsquo;s OCD in a certain kind of way in quantitative.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;re ruining the exam because you imagine someone enjoying it. I&rsquo;m imagining</p>
<p>someone who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy it. We don&rsquo;t want a life that&rsquo;s just full of pleasure. Like we just sit</p>
<p>there, you know, having a big sugar high all the time. We want a life where we do things that are</p>
<p>worthwhile. If for something to be worthwhile, just is for it to be a basic life goal, then</p>
<p>that, that mode of reflection doesn&rsquo;t really make sense. We can&rsquo;t really think,</p>
<p>did I do things worthwhile on the, on the David Hume type picture? All it is for something to be</p>
<p>worthwhile is it was a basic goal of yours or derived from a basic goal. And yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I think goal and worthwhile aren&rsquo;t, I think goal is a boring word. I&rsquo;m more sort of</p>
<p>existential. It&rsquo;s like, did you ride the roller coaster of life? Did you fully experience life</p>
<p>that, and in that sense, I mean, the blaze of grass is something that could be deeply joyful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in that way, I think suffering could be joyful in the full context of life. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>roller coaster of life. Like without suffering, without struggle, without pain, without depression,</p>
<p>with sadness, there&rsquo;s not the highs. I mean, that&rsquo;s this, that&rsquo;s a fucked up thing about life is that</p>
<p>the lows really make the highs that much richer and deeper and, and like taste better. Right. Like</p>
<p>the, like I was, I tweeted this, I was, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep and I was like late at night.</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s like a obvious statement, but like every love story eventually, you know,</p>
<p>ends in loss in tragedy. So like this feeling of love at the end, there&rsquo;s always going to be</p>
<p>tragedy. Even if it&rsquo;s the most amazing lifelong love with another human being,</p>
<p>one of you is going to die. And I don&rsquo;t know which is worse, but both, both are not going to be pretty.</p>
<p>And so that, the sense that it&rsquo;s finite, the sense that it&rsquo;s going to end in a low,</p>
<p>that gives like richness to those kind of evenings when you realize this fucking thing ends,</p>
<p>this thing ends. The feeling that it ends, that bad taste, that bad feeling that it ends</p>
<p>gives meaning, gives joy, gives, I don&rsquo;t know, pleasure is this loaded word, but</p>
<p>gives some kind of a deep pleasure to the experience when it&rsquo;s good. And I mean, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the Blades of Grass, you know, they have that to me. But you&rsquo;re perhaps right that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>reducing it to set of goals or something like that is kind of removing the magic of life.</p>
<p>Because I think what makes counting the Blades of Grass joyful is just because it&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Okay. So it sounds like you, it sounds like you reject the David Hume type picture anyway,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re saying just because you have it as a goal, that&rsquo;s what it is to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying, no, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s engaging with life, riding the roller coaster.</p>
<p>So that does sound like in some sense, there are facts independent of our personal goal choices</p>
<p>about what it means to live a good life. And I mean, coming back full circle to</p>
<p>the start of this was what makes us different to animals. I don&rsquo;t think at the end of a hamster&rsquo;s</p>
<p>life, it&rsquo;s it thinks, did I ride the roller coaster? Did I really live life to the full?</p>
<p>That is not a mode of reflection that&rsquo;s available to non human animals. So</p>
<p>what do you think is the role of death? And in all of this, the fear of death? Does that</p>
<p>interplay with consciousness? Does this self reflection? Do you think there&rsquo;s some deep</p>
<p>connection between this ability to contemplate the fact that the our flame of consciousness</p>
<p>eventually goes out? Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think unfortunately panpsychism helps particularly</p>
<p>with life after death, because for the panpsychist, there&rsquo;s nothing supernatural.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing beyond the physical. All there is really is ultimately particles and fields.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we think the ultimate nature of particles and fields is consciousness.</p>
<p>But I guess when the matter in my brain ceases to be ordered in a way that</p>
<p>sustains the particular kind of consciousness I enjoy in waking life, then in some sense,</p>
<p>I will I will cease to be although I do that the final chapter of my book Galileo&rsquo;s error</p>
<p>is more experimental. So the first four chapters of the cold blooded case for the panpsychist</p>
<p>view is that the best solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The last chapter</p>
<p>we talk about meaning. Yeah, I talk about meaning to about free will. And I talk about</p>
<p>mystical experiences. So I always want to emphasize that panpsychism is not necessarily</p>
<p>connected to anything spiritual. You know, a lot of people defending this view, like David Chalmers</p>
<p>or Luke Roloffs are just total atheist secularists, right? They don&rsquo;t believe in any kind of</p>
<p>transcendent reality. They just believe in feelings, you know, mundane consciousness and</p>
<p>think that needs explaining in our conventional scientific approach can&rsquo;t cut it. But if for</p>
<p>independent reasons you are motivated to some spiritual picture of reality, then maybe a</p>
<p>panpsychist view is more consonant with that. So if you if you have a mystical experience where you</p>
<p>it seems to you in this experience that there is this higher form of consciousness at the</p>
<p>root of all things. If you&rsquo;re a materialist, you&rsquo;ve got to think that&rsquo;s a delusion. You know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just something in your brain making you think that it&rsquo;s not real. But if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>panpsychist and you already think the fundamental nature of reality is constituted of consciousness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that much of a leap to think that this higher form of consciousness you seem to</p>
<p>apprehend in the mystical experience is part of that underlying reality. And, you know, in many</p>
<p>different cultures, experienced meditators have claimed to have experiences in which it becomes</p>
<p>apparent to them that there is an element of consciousness that is universal. So this is</p>
<p>sometimes called universal consciousness. So on this view, your mind and my mind are not</p>
<p>totally distinct. Each of our individual conscious minds is built upon the foundations</p>
<p>of universal consciousness. And universal consciousness as it exists in me is one and</p>
<p>the same thing as universal consciousness as it exists in you. So I&rsquo;ve never had one of these</p>
<p>experiences. But if one is a panpsychist, I think one is more open to that possibility. I don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>why it shouldn&rsquo;t be the case that that is part of the nature of consciousness and maybe something</p>
<p>that is apparent in certain deep states of meditation. And so what I explore in the</p>
<p>experimental final chapter of my book is that could allow for a kind of impersonal life after</p>
<p>death. Because if that view is true, then even when the particular aspects of my conscious</p>
<p>experience fall away, that element of universal consciousness at the core of my identity would</p>
<p>continue to exist. So I&rsquo;d sort of be, as it were, absorbed into universal consciousness.</p>
<p>So Buddhists and Hindu mystics try to meditate to get rid of all the bad karma to be absorbed into</p>
<p>universal consciousness. It could be that if there&rsquo;s no karma, if there&rsquo;s no reverb, maybe</p>
<p>everyone gets enlightened when they die. Maybe you just sink back into universal consciousness.</p>
<p>So I also, coming back to morality, suggest this could provide some kind of basis for altruism or</p>
<p>non egotism. Because if you think egotism implicitly assumes that we are utterly distinct</p>
<p>individuals, whereas on this view, we&rsquo;re not, we overlap to an extent that something at the core</p>
<p>of our being is even in this life, we overlap. That would be this view that some experienced</p>
<p>meditators claim becomes apparent to them that there is something at the core of my identity</p>
<p>that is one and the same as the thing at the core of your identity, this universal consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is something very, like you and I in this conversation, there&rsquo;s a few people listening</p>
<p>to this, all of us are in a kind of single mind together. There&rsquo;s some small aspect of that,</p>
<p>or maybe a big aspect about us humans. So certainly in a space of ideas, we kind of</p>
<p>meld together for time, at least in a conversation and kind of play with that idea. And then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>clearly all thinking, like if I say pink elephant, there&rsquo;s going to be a few people that are now</p>
<p>visualizing a pink elephant. We&rsquo;re all thinking about that pink elephant together. We&rsquo;re all in</p>
<p>the room together thinking about this pink elephant and we&rsquo;re like rotating it in our minds</p>
<p>together. What is that? Is there a different instantiation of that pink elephant in everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mind or is it the same elephant? And we have the same mind exploring that elephant. Now,</p>
<p>if we in our mind start petting that elephant, like touching it, that experience that we&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>like thinking what that would feel like, what&rsquo;s that? Is that all of us experiencing that together</p>
<p>or is that separate? So like there&rsquo;s some aspect of the togetherness that almost seems fundamental</p>
<p>to civilization, to society. Hopefully that&rsquo;s not too strong, but to like some of the fundamental</p>
<p>properties of the human mind, it feels like the social aspect is really important. We call it</p>
<p>social because we think of us as individual minds interacting, but if we&rsquo;re just like one collective</p>
<p>mind with like fingertips, they&rsquo;re like touching each other as it&rsquo;s trying to explore the elephant,</p>
<p>but that could be just in the realm of ideas and intelligence and not in the realm of consciousness</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s interesting to see maybe it is in the realm of consciousness. Yeah, so it&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>certainly true in some sense that there are these phenomena that you&rsquo;re talking about of</p>
<p>collective consciousness in some sense. I suppose the question is how ontologically</p>
<p>serious do we want to be about those things? By which I mean, are they just a construction</p>
<p>of out of our minds and the fact that we interact in the standardly scientifically accepted ways</p>
<p>or is as someone like Rupert Sheldrake would think that there is some</p>
<p>metaphysical reality, there are some fields beyond the scientifically understood ones that</p>
<p>are somehow communicating this. I mean, I think that, I mean, the view I was describing was that</p>
<p>this element we&rsquo;re supposed to have in common is some sort of pure impersonal consciousness or</p>
<p>something rather than. So actually, I mean, an interesting figure is the Australian philosopher</p>
<p>Miri Al Bahari, who defends a kind of mystical conception of reality rooted in a advice of Adanta</p>
<p>mysticism. But like me, she&rsquo;s from this tradition of analytic philosophy. And so she defends this</p>
<p>in this, you know, incredibly precise, rigorous way. She defends the idea that we should think</p>
<p>of experienced meditators as providing expert testimony. So, you know, I think humans cause</p>
<p>a causing climate breakdown. I have no idea of the science behind it, you know, but I trust the</p>
<p>experts or, you know, that the universe is 14 billion years old. You know, most of our knowledge</p>
<p>is based on expert testimony. And she thinks we should think of experienced meditators,</p>
<p>these people who are telling us about this universal consciousness at the core of our being</p>
<p>as a relevant kind of expert. And so she wants to defend the rational acceptability of this</p>
<p>mystical conception of reality. So it&rsquo;s what, you know, I think we shouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed, you know,</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t be worried about dealing with certain views as long as it&rsquo;s done with rigor</p>
<p>and seriousness. You know, I think sometimes terms like, I don&rsquo;t know, new age or something</p>
<p>can function a bit like racist terms. You know, a racist term picks out a group of people, but then</p>
<p>implies certain negative characteristics. So people use this term, you know, to pick out a</p>
<p>certain set of views like mystical conception of reality and imply it&rsquo;s kind of fluffy thinking or,</p>
<p>but, you know, you read Marielle Bihari, you read Luke Roloff&rsquo;s, this is serious, rigorous thought,</p>
<p>whether you agree with it or not, obviously it&rsquo;s hugely controversial. And so, you know,</p>
<p>the enlightenment ideal is to follow the evidence and the arguments where they lead.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of very hard for human beings to do that. I think we get stuck in some conception of</p>
<p>how we think science ought to look. And, you know, people talk about religion as a crutch,</p>
<p>but I think a certain kind of scientism, a certain conception of how science is supposed to be,</p>
<p>gets into people&rsquo;s identity and their sense of themselves and their security. And make things</p>
<p>hard if you&rsquo;re a panpsychist. And even the word expert becomes a kind of crutch. I mean, you use</p>
<p>the word expert. You have some kind of conception of what expertise means. Oftentimes that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, connected with a degree, a particularly prestigious university or something like that. Or,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s, you know, expertise is a funny one. I&rsquo;ve noticed that anybody sort of that claims</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re an expert is usually not the expert. The biggest quote unquote expert that I&rsquo;ve ever met</p>
<p>are the ones that are truly humble. So the humility is a really good sign of somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s traveled a long road and been humbled by how little they know. So some of the best people</p>
<p>in the world at whatever the thing they&rsquo;ve spent their life doing are the ones that are ultimately</p>
<p>humble in the face of it all. So like, just being humble for how little we know, even if we travel</p>
<p>a lifetime. I do like the idea. I mean, treating sort of like, what is it, psychonauts, like an</p>
<p>expert witness, you know, people who have traveled with the help of DMT to another place where they</p>
<p>got some deep understanding of something. And their insight is perhaps as valuable as the insight</p>
<p>of somebody who ran rigorous psychological studies at Princeton University or something.</p>
<p>Like those psychonauts, they have wisdom, if it&rsquo;s done rigorously, which you can also do rigorously</p>
<p>within the university, within the studies now, with psilocybin and those kinds of things. Yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fact that&rsquo;s fascinating. Still probably the best, one of the best works on mystical</p>
<p>experience is the chapter in William James&rsquo;s Varieties of Religious Experiences. And most of</p>
<p>it is just a psychological study of trying to define the characteristics of mystical experience</p>
<p>as a psychological type. But at the end, he considers the question, if you have a mystical</p>
<p>experience, is it rational to trust it, to trust that it&rsquo;s telling you something about reality?</p>
<p>Something about reality. And he makes an interesting argument. He says, if you say no, you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>applying a double standard because we all think it&rsquo;s okay to trust our normal sensory experiences,</p>
<p>but we have no way of getting outside of ourselves to prove that our sensory experiences correspond</p>
<p>to an external reality. We could be in the matrix. This could be a very vivid dream.</p>
<p>You could say, oh, we do science, but a scientist only gets their data by experiencing the results</p>
<p>of their experiments. And then the question arises again, how do you know that corresponds</p>
<p>to a real world? So he thinks there&rsquo;s a sort of double standard in saying, it&rsquo;s okay to trust</p>
<p>our ordinary sensory experiences, but it&rsquo;s not okay for the person on DMT to trust those experiences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very philosophically difficult to say, why is it okay in the one case and not the other? So I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s an interesting argument there, but I would like to just defend experts a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, I agree it&rsquo;s very difficult, but especially in an age, I guess, where there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>information, I do think it&rsquo;s important to have some protection of sources of information,</p>
<p>academic institutions that we can trust. And then that&rsquo;s difficult because of course there are</p>
<p>non academics who do know what they&rsquo;re talking about. But like, if I&rsquo;m interested in knowing</p>
<p>about biology, you know, you can&rsquo;t research everything. So I think we have to have some sense</p>
<p>of who are the experts we can trust, the people who&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time reading all the material</p>
<p>that people have read, written, thinking about it, having their views torn apart by other people</p>
<p>working in the field. I think that is very important. And also to protect that from conflicts</p>
<p>of interest. There is a so called think tank in the UK called the Institute of Economic Affairs,</p>
<p>who are always on the BBC as experts on economic questions and they do not declare who funds them.</p>
<p>Right. So we don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s paying the paper. I think, you know, you shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to call</p>
<p>yourself a think tank if you&rsquo;re not totally transparent about who&rsquo;s funding you. So I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it. And I mean, this connects to panpsychism because I think the reason people, you know,</p>
<p>worry about unorthodox ideas is because they worry about how do we know when we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>losing control or losing discipline. So I do think we need to somehow protect</p>
<p>academic institutions as sources of information that we can trust. And, you know, in philosophy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s not much consensus on everything, but you can at least know what people</p>
<p>who have put the time in to read all the stuff, what they think about these issues. I think that</p>
<p>is important. To push back and you push back. Who are the experts on COVID?</p>
<p>Who are the experts on COVID? Oh, again, it&rsquo;s a dangerous territory now.</p>
<p>Well, let me just speak to it because I am walking through that dangerous territory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m allergic to the word expert because in my simple mind, it kind of rhymes with ego.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about experts. If we allow too much to have a category expert and place</p>
<p>certain people in them, those people sitting on the throne start to believe it.</p>
<p>And they start to communicate with that energy and the humility starts to dissipate.</p>
<p>I think there is value in a lifelong mastery of a skill and the pursuit of knowledge within a very</p>
<p>specific discipline. But the moment you have your name on an office, the moment you&rsquo;re an expert,</p>
<p>I think you destroy the very aspect, the very value of that journey towards knowledge.</p>
<p>So some of it probably just reduces to skillful communication. Communicate in a way that shows</p>
<p>humility, that shows an open mindedness, that shows an ability to really hear what a lot of</p>
<p>people are saying. So in the case of COVID, what I&rsquo;ve noticed, and this is probably true with</p>
<p>panpsychism as well, is so called experts, and they are extremely knowledgeable, many of them</p>
<p>are colleagues of mine, they dismiss what millions of people are saying on the internet</p>
<p>without having looked into it. With empathy and rigor, honestly, understand what are the</p>
<p>arguments being made. They say like, there&rsquo;s not enough time to explore all those things,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s so much stuff out there. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s intellectual laziness. If you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough time, then don&rsquo;t speak so strongly with dismissal. Feel bad about it. Be apologetic</p>
<p>about the fact that you don&rsquo;t have enough time to explore the evidence. For example, with the heat</p>
<p>I got with Francis Collins is that he kind of said that lab leak, he kind of dismissed the</p>
<p>heat. He kind of dismissed it, showing that he didn&rsquo;t really deeply explore all the sort of,</p>
<p>the huge amount of circumstantial evidence out there, the battles that are going on out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people really tensely discussing this and being, showing humility in the face</p>
<p>of that battle of ideas, I think is really important. And I just been very disappointed</p>
<p>in so called expertise in the space of science and showing humility and showing humanity and</p>
<p>kindness and empathy towards other human beings. That&rsquo;s, at the same time, obviously, I love</p>
<p>Jiro Junsu&rsquo;s sushi lifelong pursuit of like getting, like in computer science, Don Knuth,</p>
<p>like some of my biggest heroes are people that like, when nobody else cares,</p>
<p>they stay on one topic for their whole life and they just find the beautiful little things about</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s puzzles they keep solving. And yes, sometimes a virus happens or something happens</p>
<p>with that person with their puzzles becomes like the center of the whole world because that puzzles</p>
<p>becomes all of a sudden really important, but still there&rsquo;s possibilities on them to show humility</p>
<p>and to be open minded to the fact that they, even if they spent their whole life doing it,</p>
<p>even if their whole community is telling them, giving them awards and giving them citations</p>
<p>and giving them all kinds of stuff where like they&rsquo;re bowing down before them, how smart they</p>
<p>are, they still know nothing relative to all the stuff, the mysteries that are out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I don&rsquo;t know how much we&rsquo;re disagreeing. I mean, these are totally valid issues and of</p>
<p>course, expertise goes wrong in all sorts of ways. It&rsquo;s totally fallible. I suppose</p>
<p>I would just say, what is the alternative? What do we just say? All information is equal.</p>
<p>Because as a voter, I&rsquo;ve got to decide who to vote for and I&rsquo;ve got to evaluate and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look into all of the economics and all of the relevant science. And so I just think maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like Churchill said about democracy, it&rsquo;s the worst system of government apart from all the rest.</p>
<p>I think about panpsychism, it&rsquo;s the worst theory of consciousness apart from all the rest.</p>
<p>But I just think expertise, the peer review system, I think it&rsquo;s terrible in so many ways.</p>
<p>Yes, people should show more humility, but I can&rsquo;t see a viable alternative. I think</p>
<p>philosopher Bernard Williams had a really nice nuanced discussion of the problems of titles</p>
<p>and how they also function in a society. They do have some positive function. The very first time</p>
<p>I lectured in philosophy before I got a professorship was teaching at a continuing</p>
<p>education college. So it&rsquo;s kind of retired people who want to learn some more things. And I just</p>
<p>totally pitched it too high. And Gait talked about Bernard Williams on titles and hierarchies.</p>
<p>And these kind of people in their 70s and 80s would just instantly started interrupting saying,</p>
<p>what is philosophy? And it was a disaster. And I just remember in the breaks, a sort of elderly</p>
<p>lady came up and said, I&rsquo;ve decided to take Egyptology instead. But that was my introduction</p>
<p>to teaching. Anyway. But sort of titles and accomplishments is a nice starting point,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t buy you the whole thing. So you don&rsquo;t get to just say, this is true because I&rsquo;m an</p>
<p>expert. You still have to convince people. One of the things I really like to practice martial arts.</p>
<p>Yeah. And for people who don&rsquo;t know, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is one of them. And you sometimes wear</p>
<p>these pajamas, pajama looking things, and you wear a belt. So I happen to be a black belt in</p>
<p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. And I also train in what&rsquo;s called no gi, so you don&rsquo;t wear the pajamas.</p>
<p>And when you don&rsquo;t wear the pajamas, nobody knows what rank you are. Nobody knows if you&rsquo;re a black</p>
<p>belt or a white belt or if you&rsquo;re a complete beginner or not. And when you wear the pajamas</p>
<p>called the gi, you wear the rank. And people treat you very differently. When they see my black belt,</p>
<p>they treat me differently. They kind of defer to my expertise. If they&rsquo;re kicking my ass,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably because like I am working on something like new or maybe I&rsquo;m letting them win.</p>
<p>But when there&rsquo;s no belts and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I&rsquo;ve been doing this for 15 years,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter. None of it matters. What matters is the raw interaction of just trying</p>
<p>to kick each other&rsquo;s ass and seeing like, what is this chess game, like a human chess?</p>
<p>Who, what are the ideas that we&rsquo;re playing with? And I think there&rsquo;s a dance there. Yes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s valuable to know a person as a black belt when you take consideration of the advice of</p>
<p>different people, me versus somebody who&rsquo;s only practiced for like a couple of days.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the raw practice of ideas that is combat and the raw practice of exchange</p>
<p>of ideas that is science needs to often throw away expertise. And in communicating, like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing to science and expertise, which is leadership. It&rsquo;s not just, so the scientific</p>
<p>method in the review process is this rigorous battle of ideas between scientists. But there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also a stepping up and inspiring the world and communicating ideas to the world. And that skill</p>
<p>of communication, I suppose that&rsquo;s my biggest criticism of so called experts in science.</p>
<p>Is there just shitty communicators? Absolutely. Yeah. Well, I can tell you, I get very frustrated</p>
<p>with philosophers not reaching out more. I mean, I think it might be partly that we&rsquo;re trained to</p>
<p>get watertight arguments, respond to all objections. And as you do that, eventually it</p>
<p>gets more complicated and the jargon comes in. So to write a more accessible book or article,</p>
<p>you have to loosen the arguments a bit. And then we worry that other philosophers will think,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s a really crap argument. So I mean, the way I did it, I wrote my academic book first,</p>
<p>Consciousness and Fundamental Reality, and then a more accessible book, Galileo&rsquo;s Error,</p>
<p>where the arguments, you know, not as rigorously worked out. So then I can say the proper arguments</p>
<p>there, you know, the further arguments there. That&rsquo;s brilliantly done, by the way. Like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such a, so for people who don&rsquo;t know, you first wrote Consciousness and Fundamental</p>
<p>Reality. So that&rsquo;s the academic book, also very good. I flew through it last night, bought it.</p>
<p>And then obviously the popular book is Galileo&rsquo;s Error, Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the right way to do it. To show that you&rsquo;re legit, your community to the world,</p>
<p>by doing the book that&rsquo;s normally going to read, and then doing a popular book</p>
<p>that everybody&rsquo;s going to read. That&rsquo;s cool. Well, I try now, every time I write an academic article,</p>
<p>I try to write a more accessible version. I mean, the thing I&rsquo;ve been working on recently,</p>
<p>just because there&rsquo;s this argument. So there&rsquo;s a certain argument from the cosmological fine</p>
<p>tuning of the laws of physics for life to the multiverse that&rsquo;s quite popular physicists like</p>
<p>Max Tegmark. There&rsquo;s an argument in philosophy journals that there&rsquo;s a fallacious line of</p>
<p>reasoning going on there from the fine tuning to the multiverse. Now that argument is from 20,</p>
<p>30 years ago, and it&rsquo;s, you know, discussed in academic philosophy. Nobody knows about it. And</p>
<p>there is huge interest in this fine tuning stuff. Scientists wanting to argue for the multiverse,</p>
<p>theists wanting to say this is evidence for God, and nobody knows about this argument,</p>
<p>which tries to show that it&rsquo;s fallacious reasoning to go from the fine tuning to the multiverse. So</p>
<p>I wrote a piece for Scientific American explaining this argument to a more general audience. And,</p>
<p>you know, it just really irritates me that it&rsquo;s just buried in these technical journal articles</p>
<p>and nobody knows about it. But just, you know, final thing on that. I don&rsquo;t disagree with</p>
<p>anything you said, and that&rsquo;s kind of really beautiful, that martial arts example and thinking</p>
<p>how that could be analogous. But I think it&rsquo;s very rare to find a good philosopher who hasn&rsquo;t given</p>
<p>a talk to other philosophers and had objections raised. I was going to say have it torn apart,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s maybe thinking of it in the slightly the wrong way, but have the best objections</p>
<p>raised to it. And that&rsquo;s why that is an important formative process that you go through as an</p>
<p>academic, that the greatest minds starting a philosophy degree, for example, won&rsquo;t have gone</p>
<p>through and probably, except in very rare cases, just won&rsquo;t have that, that the skills required.</p>
<p>But part of it is just fun to disagree and dance with. I think to elaborate on what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>in agreement, not just gone through that, but continue to go through that. That&rsquo;s, I would say,</p>
<p>the biggest problem with, quote unquote, expertise is that there&rsquo;s a certain point where you get,</p>
<p>because it sucks. Like martial arts is a good example of that. It sucks to get your ass kicked.</p>
<p>Yeah. Like I, there&rsquo;s a temptation. I still go, like I train, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting older too, but also there&rsquo;s killers out there in both the space of martial arts and</p>
<p>the space of science. And I think that once you become a professor, like more and more senior</p>
<p>and more and more respected, I don&rsquo;t know if you get your ass kicked in the space of ideas as often.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you allow yourself to truly expose yourself. If you do, that&rsquo;s a great,</p>
<p>like sign of a, of a humble, brilliant mind is constantly exposing yourself to that.</p>
<p>I think you do because I think there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s graduate students who want to,</p>
<p>you know, find the objection to sort of write their paper or make their mark. And</p>
<p>yeah, I, I think everyone still gives talks or should give talk, give talks and people are</p>
<p>wanting to work out if there are any weaknesses to your position. So yeah, I think that generally</p>
<p>works out. There is also a kind of, who do you give the talks to? So, I mean, within communities,</p>
<p>the little cluster of people that argue and bicker, but what are they arguing about? They</p>
<p>take a bunch of stuff, a bunch of basic assumptions as agreement, and they heatedly argue about</p>
<p>certain ideas. The question is how open are, that that&rsquo;s actually kind of like fun. That&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>no offense, sorry, we&rsquo;re sticking on this martial arts thing. It&rsquo;s like people who practice Aikido</p>
<p>or certain martial arts that don&rsquo;t truly test themselves in the cage, in combat. So it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun to argue about like certain things when you&rsquo;re in your own community, but you don&rsquo;t test</p>
<p>those ideas in the full context of science, in the full like seriousness, the rigor of the,</p>
<p>sometimes like the real world. One of my favorite fields is psychology. There&rsquo;s often,</p>
<p>places within psychology where you&rsquo;re kind of doing these studies and arguing about stuff that&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>in the lab. The arguments are almost disjoint from real human behavior. Because it&rsquo;s so much easier</p>
<p>to study human behavior in the lab, you just kind of stay there and that&rsquo;s where the arguments are.</p>
<p>And so vision science is a good example, like studying eye movement and how we perceive the</p>
<p>world and all that kind of stuff. It&rsquo;s so much easier to study in the lab that we don&rsquo;t consider</p>
<p>we say that&rsquo;s going to be what the science of vision is going to be like, and we don&rsquo;t consider</p>
<p>the science of vision in the actual real world, the engineering of vision. I don&rsquo;t know. And so</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where exposing yourself to out of the box ideas, that&rsquo;s the most painful,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most important. I mean groupthink can be a terrible thing in philosophy as well,</p>
<p>but because you&rsquo;re not to the same extent beholden to evidence and refutation from the evidence that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the sciences, it&rsquo;s a more subtle process of evaluation and so more susceptible, I think,</p>
<p>to groupthink. Yeah, I agree. It&rsquo;s a danger. We&rsquo;ve talked about a million times, but let&rsquo;s try to</p>
<p>sort of do that old basic terminology definitions. What is panpsychism? Like what are the different</p>
<p>ways you can try to think about to define panpsychism? Maybe</p>
<p>in contrast to naturalistic dualism and materialism, other kind of views of consciousness?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that you&rsquo;ve basically laid out the different options. So I guess probably still</p>
<p>the dominant view is materialism, that roughly that we can explain consciousness in the terms</p>
<p>of physical science, wholly explain it just in terms of the electrochemical signaling in the</p>
<p>brain. Dualism, the polar opposite view, that consciousness is nonphysical outside of the</p>
<p>physical workings of the body and the brain, although closely connected. When I studied</p>
<p>philosophy, we were taught basically they were the two options you had to choose, right?</p>
<p>Either you thought it were dualist and you thought it was separate from the physical, or you thought</p>
<p>it was just electrochemical signaling. And yeah, I became very disillusioned because I think there</p>
<p>are big problems with both of these options. So I think the attraction of panpsychism is it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of a middle way. It agrees with the materialist that there&rsquo;s just a physical world. Ultimately,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just particles and fields. But the panpsychist, the materialist,</p>
<p>but the panpsychist thinks there&rsquo;s more to the physical than what physical science reveals,</p>
<p>and that the ultimate nature of the physical world is constituted of consciousness. So</p>
<p>consciousness is not outside of the physical as the dualist thinks. It&rsquo;s embedded in, underlies</p>
<p>the kind of description of the world we get from physics.</p>
<p>LW. What are the problems of materialism and dualism?</p>
<p>CM. Starting with materialism, it&rsquo;s a huge debate, but I think that the core of it is that</p>
<p>physical science works with a purely quantitative description of the physical world,</p>
<p>whereas consciousness essentially involves qualities. If you think about the smell of coffee</p>
<p>or the taste of mint or the deep red you experience as you watch a sunset, I think these</p>
<p>qualities can&rsquo;t be captured in the purely quantitative language of physical science.</p>
<p>So as long as your description of the brain is framed in the purely quantitative language of</p>
<p>neuroscience, you&rsquo;ll just leave out these qualities and hence really leave out consciousness itself.</p>
<p>LW. And then dualism?</p>
<p>CM. So I&rsquo;ve actually changed my mind a little bit on this since I wrote the book. So, I mean,</p>
<p>I argued in the book that we have pretty good experimental grounds for doubting dualism,</p>
<p>and roughly the idea was if dualism were true, if there was, say, an immaterial mind impacting on</p>
<p>the brain every second of waking life, that this would really show up in on neuroscience. There&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be all sorts of things happening in the brain that had no physical explanation. It would be like a</p>
<p>poltergeist was playing with the brain. But actually, and so the fact that we don&rsquo;t find that</p>
<p>is a strong and ever growing inductive argument against dualism. But actually, the more I talk to</p>
<p>neuroscientists and read neuroscience and we have at Durham, my university, an interdisciplinary</p>
<p>consciousness group, I don&rsquo;t think we know enough about the brain, about the workings of the brain</p>
<p>to make that argument. I think we know a lot about the basic chemistry, how neurons fire,</p>
<p>neurotransmitters, action potentials, things like that. We know a fair bit about large scale</p>
<p>functions of the brain, what different bits of the brain do. But what we&rsquo;re almost clueless on</p>
<p>is how those large scale functions are realized at the cellular level, how it works.</p>
<p>People get quite excited about brain scans, but it&rsquo;s very low resolution. Every pixel on a brain</p>
<p>scan corresponds to 5.5 million neurons. We&rsquo;re only 70% of the way through constructing a connectome</p>
<p>for the maggot brain, which has 10,000 or 100,000 neurons, but the brain has 86 billion neurons.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;d have to know a lot more about how the brain works, how these functions are realized</p>
<p>before we could assess whether the dynamics of the brain can be completely explicated in terms of</p>
<p>underlying chemistry or physics. We&rsquo;d have to do more engineering before we could figure that out.</p>
<p>There are people with other proposals, someone I got to know, Martin Picard at Columbia University,</p>
<p>who has the Psychobiology Mitochondrial Lab there and is experimentally exploring the hypothesis</p>
<p>that mitochondria in the brain should be under social networks, perhaps as an alternative to</p>
<p>reducing it to underlying chemistry and physics. It is ultimately an empirical question whether</p>
<p>dualism is true. I&rsquo;m less convinced that we know the answer to that question at this stage.</p>
<p>I think still as scientists and philosophers, we want to try and find the simplest,</p>
<p>most parsimonious theory of reality. Dualism is still a pretty inelegant,</p>
<p>unparsimonious theory. Reality is divided up into the purely physical properties and these</p>
<p>consciousness properties and they&rsquo;re radically different kinds of things. Whereas the panpsychist</p>
<p>offers a much more simple, unified picture of reality. I think it&rsquo;s still the view to be</p>
<p>preferred. To put it very simply, why believe in two kinds of things when you can just get away</p>
<p>with one? And materialism is also very simple, but you&rsquo;re saying it doesn&rsquo;t explain something</p>
<p>that seems pretty important. Yes. I think materialism kind of, you know, science is</p>
<p>about trying to find the simplest theory that accounts for the data. I don&rsquo;t think materialism</p>
<p>can account for the data. Maybe dualism can account for the data, but panpsychism is simpler.</p>
<p>It can account for the data and it&rsquo;s simpler. What is panpsychism?</p>
<p>So in its broadest definition, it&rsquo;s the view that consciousness is a fundamental</p>
<p>and ubiquitous feature of the physical world.</p>
<p>Like a law of physics, what should we be imagining? What do you think the different</p>
<p>flavors of how that actually takes shape in the context of what we know about physics and science</p>
<p>and the universe? So in the simplest form of it, the fundamental building blocks of reality,</p>
<p>perhaps electrons and quarks have incredibly simple forms of experience and the very complex</p>
<p>experience of the human or animal brain is somehow rooted in or derived from these very simple</p>
<p>forms of experience at the level of basic physics. But I mean, maybe the crucial bit about</p>
<p>the kind of panpsychism I defend, what it does is it takes the standard approach to the problem</p>
<p>of consciousness and turns it on its head, right? So the standard approach is to think</p>
<p>we start with matter and we think, how do we get consciousness out of matter? So I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>problem can be solved for reasons I&rsquo;ve kind of hinted at. We could maybe go into more detail,</p>
<p>but the panpsychist does it the other way around. They start with consciousness and try to get</p>
<p>matter out of consciousness. So the idea is basically at the fundamental level of reality,</p>
<p>at the fundamental level of reality, there are just networks of very simple conscious entities.</p>
<p>But these conscious entities, because they have very simple kinds of experience,</p>
<p>they behave in predictable ways. Through their interactions, they realize certain</p>
<p>mathematical structures. And then the idea is those mathematical structures just are</p>
<p>the structures identified by physics. So when we think about these simple conscious entities</p>
<p>in terms of the mathematical structures they realize, we call them particles, we call them</p>
<p>fields, we call their properties mass, spin and charge. But really there&rsquo;s just these very simple</p>
<p>conscious entities and their experiences. So in this way, we get physics out of consciousness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can get consciousness out of physics, but I think it&rsquo;s pretty easy to get</p>
<p>physics out of consciousness. Well, I&rsquo;m a little confused by why you need to get physics out of</p>
<p>consciousness. I mean, to me, it sounds like panpsychism unites consciousness and physics.</p>
<p>I mean, physics is the mathematical science of describing everything. So physics should be able</p>
<p>to describe consciousness. Panpsychism, in my understanding, proposes is that physics doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>currently do so, but can in the future. I mean, it seems like consciousness, you have like Stephen</p>
<p>Wolfram, who&rsquo;s all these people who are trying to develop theories of everything, mathematical</p>
<p>frameworks within which to describe how we get all the reality that we perceive around us. To me,</p>
<p>to me, there&rsquo;s no reason why that kind of framework cannot also include some accurate,</p>
<p>precise description of whatever simple consciousness characteristics are present</p>
<p>there at the lowest level, if panpsychist theories have truth to them. So like to me,</p>
<p>it is physics. You said kind of physics emerges, by which you mean like the basic four laws of</p>
<p>physics that as we currently know them, the standard model, quantum mechanics, general</p>
<p>relativity that emerges from the base consciousness layer. That&rsquo;s what you mean.</p>
<p>Yeah. So maybe the way I phrased it made it sound like these things are more separate than they are.</p>
<p>What I was trying to address was a common misunderstanding of panpsychism, that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a sort of dualistic theory. The idea is that particles have their physical properties like</p>
<p>mass, spin, and charge, and these other funny consciousness properties. So the physicist Sabine</p>
<p>Hossenfelder had a blog post critiquing panpsychism maybe a couple of years ago now that got a</p>
<p>fair bit of traction. And she was interpreting panpsychism in this way. And then her thought was,</p>
<p>well look, if particles had these funny consciousness properties, then it would show up in our physics</p>
<p>like the standard model of particle physics would make false predictions because its predictions are</p>
<p>based wholly on the physical properties. If there were also these consciousness properties, we&rsquo;d get</p>
<p>different predictions. But that&rsquo;s a misunderstanding of the view. The view is it&rsquo;s not that there are</p>
<p>two kinds of property that mass, spin, and charge are forms of consciousness. How do we make sense</p>
<p>of that? Because actually when you look at what physics tells us, it&rsquo;s really just telling us</p>
<p>about behavior, about what stuff does. I sometimes put it by saying doing physics is like playing</p>
<p>chess when you don&rsquo;t care what the pieces are made of. You&rsquo;re just interested in what moves you can</p>
<p>make. So physics tells us what mass, spin, and charge do, but it doesn&rsquo;t tell us what they are.</p>
<p>The experience of mass. So the idea is, yeah, mass in its nature is a very simple form of</p>
<p>consciousness. So yeah, physics in a sense is complete, I think, because it tells us what</p>
<p>everything at the fundamental level does. It describes its causal capacities. But for the</p>
<p>panpsychist at least, physics doesn&rsquo;t tell us what matter is. It tells us what it does, but not what</p>
<p>it is. To push back on the thing I think she&rsquo;s criticizing, is it also possible, so I understand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying, but is it also possible that particles have another property like consciousness?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the criticism we would be able to detect it in our experiments. Well, no, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not looking for it. I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that are orthogonal. Like if you&rsquo;re not looking</p>
<p>for this stuff, you&rsquo;re not going to detect it. Because like all of our basic empirical science</p>
<p>through its recent history, and yes the history of science is quite recent, has been very kind of</p>
<p>focused on billiard balls colliding and from that understanding how gravity works. But like we just</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t integrated other possibilities into this. I don&rsquo;t think there will be conflicting whether you</p>
<p>are observing consciousness or not, or exploring some of these ideas. I don&rsquo;t think that affects</p>
<p>the rest of the physics. The mass, the energy, the all the different kind of like the hierarchy of</p>
<p>different particles and so on, how they interact. I don&rsquo;t think, it feels like consciousness is</p>
<p>something orthogonal, like very much distinct. It&rsquo;s the quantitative versus the qualitative.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something quite distinct that we&rsquo;re just almost like another dimension that we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>completely ignoring. There might be a way of responding to Sabina to say, well, that there</p>
<p>could be properties of particles that don&rsquo;t show up in the specific circumstances in which physicists</p>
<p>investigate particles. My colleague, the philosopher of science, Nancy Cartwright, has got this book,</p>
<p>How the Laws of Physics Lie, where she says, physicists explore things in very specific</p>
<p>circumstances and then in an unwarranted way generalize that. But I mean, I guess I was</p>
<p>thinking Sabina&rsquo;s criticism actually just misses the mark in a more basic way. Her point is,</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t think there are any more properties to particles other than those the standard model</p>
<p>attributes to them. Panpsychus would say, yeah, sure, there aren&rsquo;t. There are just the properties,</p>
<p>the physical properties like mass, spin and charge that the standard model attributes to them. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just that we have a different philosophical view as to the nature of those properties.</p>
<p>Those properties are turtles that are sitting on top of another turtle and that big turtle is</p>
<p>consciousness. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying. But I&rsquo;m just saying, it&rsquo;s possible that&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible also that consciousness is just another turtle playing with the others. It&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>interacting in the ways that we&rsquo;ve been observing. In fact, to me, that&rsquo;s more compelling because</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s going to be, well, no, I think both are very compelling, but it feels like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more within the reach of empirical validation if it&rsquo;s yet another property of particles that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just not observing. If it&rsquo;s like the thing from which matter and energy and physics emerges,</p>
<p>it makes it that much more difficult to investigate how you get from that base</p>
<p>layer of consciousness to the wonderful little spark of consciousness, complexity and beauty</p>
<p>that is the human being. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re necessarily trying to get there,</p>
<p>but one of the beautiful things to get at with panpsychism or with a solid theory of consciousness</p>
<p>is to answer the question, how do you engineer the thing? How do you get from nothing vacuum</p>
<p>in the lab? If there is that consciousness base layer, how do you start engineering organisms that</p>
<p>have consciousness in them? Or the reverse of that describing how does consciousness emerge</p>
<p>in the human being from conception, from a stem cell to the whole full neurobiology that builds</p>
<p>from that, how do you get this full rich experience of consciousness that humans have? It feels like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the dream and if consciousness is just another player in the game of physics, it feels</p>
<p>more amenable to our scientific understanding of it. That&rsquo;s interesting. I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to be a kind of identity claim here that physics tells us what matter does, consciousness is what</p>
<p>matter is. So matter is sort of what consciousness does. So at the bottom level, there is just</p>
<p>consciousness and conscious things. There are just these simple things with their experiences</p>
<p>and that is their total nature. So in that sense, it&rsquo;s not another player, it&rsquo;s just all there is</p>
<p>really. In physics, we describe that at a certain level of abstraction. We capture what Bertrand</p>
<p>Russell, who was the inspiration for a lot of this, calls the causal skeleton of the world.</p>
<p>So physics is just interested in the causal skeleton of the world, it&rsquo;s not interested in</p>
<p>flesh and blood, although that&rsquo;s maybe suggesting separation again too much,</p>
<p>or metaphors fail in the end. So yeah, you totally right. Ultimately, what we want to explain is how</p>
<p>our consciousness and the consciousness of other animals comes out of this. If we can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s game over. But I think it maybe makes more sense on the identity claim that if matter</p>
<p>at the fundamental level just is forms of consciousness, then we can perhaps make sense</p>
<p>of how those simple forms of consciousness in some way combine in some way to make</p>
<p>the consciousness we know and love. That&rsquo;s the dream. Yeah, so I guess the question is,</p>
<p>so the reason you can describe, like the reason you have material engineering, material science,</p>
<p>is because you have from physics to chemistry, like you keep going up and up in levels of</p>
<p>complexity in order to describe objects that we have in our human world. And it would be nice to</p>
<p>do the same thing for consciousness, to come up with the chemistry of consciousness, right? Like</p>
<p>how do the different particles interact to create greater complexity? So you can do this kind of</p>
<p>thing for life, like what is life, like living organisms, at which point do living organisms</p>
<p>become living? What, like what, how do you know if I give you a thing that that thing is living?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people working on this kind of idea and some of that has to do with the levels</p>
<p>of complexity and so on. It&rsquo;d be nice to know like measuring different degrees of consciousness as</p>
<p>you get into a bigger, more and more complex objects. And that&rsquo;s, I mean that&rsquo;s what chemistry,</p>
<p>biochemistry, like bigger and bigger conscious molecules, and to see how that leads to organisms.</p>
<p>And then organisms like start to collaborate together like they do inside a human body</p>
<p>to create the full human body. To do those kinds of experiments would be,</p>
<p>it seems like that would be kind of a goal. That&rsquo;s what I mean by player in a game of physics,</p>
<p>as opposed to like the base layer. If it&rsquo;s just the base layer, it becomes harder to track it</p>
<p>as you get from physics to chemistry to biology to psychology.</p>
<p>Yeah. In every case, apart from consciousness, I would say what we&rsquo;re interested in is behavior.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re interested in explaining behavioral functions. So at the level of fundamental physics,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re interested in capturing the equations that describe the behavior there. And when we get to</p>
<p>higher levels, we&rsquo;re interested in explicating the behavior, perhaps in terms of behavior at</p>
<p>simpler levels. And with life as well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re interested in, the various observable</p>
<p>functions of life, explaining them in terms of more simple mechanisms. But in the case of</p>
<p>consciousness, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing, or at least not all that we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>In the case of consciousness, there are these subjective qualities that we&rsquo;re immediately</p>
<p>aware of that the redness of a red experience, the itchiness of an itch, and we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>account for them. We&rsquo;re trying to bring them into our theory of reality and postulating some</p>
<p>mechanism does not deal with that. So I think we&rsquo;ve got to realize dealing with consciousness</p>
<p>is a radically different explanatory task from other tasks of science. Other tasks of science,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to explain behavior in terms of simpler forms of behavior. In the case of</p>
<p>consciousness, we&rsquo;re trying to explain these invisible subjective qualities that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see from the outside, but that you&rsquo;re immediately aware of. The reason materialism perhaps continues</p>
<p>to dominate is people think, look at the success of science, it&rsquo;s incredible, look at all the,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s explained all this, surely it&rsquo;s going to explain consciousness. But I think we</p>
<p>have to appreciate there&rsquo;s a radically different explanatory task here. And so that, I mean,</p>
<p>the neuroscientist Anil Seth, who I&rsquo;ve had lots of intense but friendly discussions with, you know,</p>
<p>wants to compare consciousness to life. But I think there&rsquo;s this radical difference that</p>
<p>in the case of life, again, we come back to public observation, all of the data,</p>
<p>publicly observable data, we&rsquo;re basically trying to explain complex behavior. And the way you do</p>
<p>that is identify mechanisms, simpler mechanisms that explicate that behavior. That&rsquo;s the task in</p>
<p>physics, chemistry, neurobiology. But in the case of consciousness, that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to do. We&rsquo;re trying to account for these subjective qualities and you postulate a mechanism</p>
<p>that might explain behavior, but it doesn&rsquo;t explain the redness of a red experience.</p>
<p>So, but still, I mean, still, ultimately, the hope is that we will have some kind of hierarchical</p>
<p>story. So we take the causal dynamics of physics, we hypothesize that that&rsquo;s filled out with</p>
<p>certain forms of consciousness. And then at higher levels, we get more complex causal dynamics</p>
<p>filled out by more complex forms of consciousness. And ultimately, we get to us, hopefully. So yeah,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s still a sort of hierarchical explanatory framework there.</p>
<p>So you kind of mentioned the hierarchy of consciousness. Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to,</p>
<p>within the panpsychism framework, to measure consciousness? Or put another way,</p>
<p>are some things more conscious than others, in the panpsychist view?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult question. I mean, I do see consciousness as a dealing with consciousness,</p>
<p>an interdisciplinary task between something more experimental, which is to do with the ongoing</p>
<p>project of trying to work out what people call the neural correlates of consciousness,</p>
<p>of consciousness, what kinds of physical brain activity correspond to conscious experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one part of it. But I think essentially, there&rsquo;s also a theoretical question of</p>
<p>more the why question. Why do those kinds of brain activity go along with certain kinds of</p>
<p>conscious experience? I don&rsquo;t think you can answer that. Because consciousness is not publicly</p>
<p>observable. I don&rsquo;t think you can answer that why question with an experiment. But they have to go</p>
<p>hand in hand. And I mean, one of the theories I&rsquo;m attracted to is the integrated information theory,</p>
<p>according to which we find consciousness at the level at which there is most integrated</p>
<p>information. And they try to give a mathematically precise definition of that. So on that view,</p>
<p>you know, probably this cup of tea isn&rsquo;t conscious, because there&rsquo;s probably more</p>
<p>integrated information in the molecules making up the tea than there is in the liquid as a whole.</p>
<p>But in the brain, what is distinctive about the brain is that there&rsquo;s a huge amount of integrated,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more integrated information in the system than there is in individual neurons. So that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>they claim that that&rsquo;s the basis of consciousness at the macro level. I mean, I like some features</p>
<p>of this theory, but they do talk about degrees of consciousness. They do want to say there is</p>
<p>gradations. I&rsquo;m not sure conceptually I can kind of make sense of that. I mean, there are things</p>
<p>to do with consciousness that are graded, like complexity or levels of information. But I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure whether experience itself admits a degree. I sort of think something either has experience or</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t. It might have very simple experience, it might have very complex experience, but</p>
<p>experience itself, I don&rsquo;t think it admits a degree in that sense. It&rsquo;s not more experience,</p>
<p>less experience. I sort of find that conceptually hard to make sense of. But I&rsquo;m kind of open minded</p>
<p>on it. So when we have a lot higher resolution of sensory information, don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>correlated to the richness of the experience? So doesn&rsquo;t more information provide a richer</p>
<p>experience? Or is that, again, thinking quantitatively and not thinking about the</p>
<p>subjective experience? Like you can experience a lot with very little sensory information, perhaps.</p>
<p>Do you think those are connected? Yeah, yeah. So there are</p>
<p>features, characteristics here we can grade, the complexity of the experience. And on the</p>
<p>integrated information theory, they correlate that in terms of mathematically identifiable structure</p>
<p>with integrated information. So roughly, it&rsquo;s a quite unusual notion of information. It&rsquo;s perhaps</p>
<p>not the standard way one thinks about information. It&rsquo;s to do with constraining past and future</p>
<p>possibilities of the system. So the idea is in the retina of the eye, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of</p>
<p>possible states the retina of my eye could be in at the next moment, depending on what light goes</p>
<p>into it. Whereas the possible next states of the brain are much more likely to be in the retina of</p>
<p>the eye. The possible next states of the brain are much more constrained. Obviously, it responds to</p>
<p>the environment, but it heavily constrains its past and future states. And so that&rsquo;s the idea</p>
<p>of information they have. And then the second idea is how much that information is dependent on</p>
<p>integration. So in a computer where you have transistors, you take out a few transistors,</p>
<p>lose that much information. It&rsquo;s not dependent on interconnections. Whereas you take a tiny bit of</p>
<p>the brain out, you lose a lot of information because the way it stores information is dependent</p>
<p>on the interconnections of the system. So that&rsquo;s one proposal for how to measure one gradable</p>
<p>characteristic, which might correspond to some gradable characteristic in qualitative</p>
<p>consciousness. And maybe I&rsquo;m being very pedantic, which is, you know, philosophers, professional</p>
<p>pedants. I just sort of don&rsquo;t think that is a quantity of experience. It&rsquo;s a quantity of</p>
<p>the structure of experience, maybe, but I just find it hard to make sense of the idea of how</p>
<p>much experience do you have? I&rsquo;ve got, you know, five units of experience. I&rsquo;ve got one unit of</p>
<p>experience. I don&rsquo;t know. I find that a bit hard to make sense. Maybe I&rsquo;m being just pedantic.</p>
<p>I think just saying the word experience is difficult to think about. Let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>suffering. Let&rsquo;s talk about a particular experience. So let&rsquo;s talk about me and the hamster.</p>
<p>I just think that no offense to the hamster. Probably no hamsters are listening.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re offending hamsters too. Maybe there&rsquo;s a hamster that&rsquo;s just pissed off.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably somebody on a speaker right now listening to this podcast and they probably have</p>
<p>a hamster or a guinea pig and that hamster is listening. It just doesn&rsquo;t know the English</p>
<p>language or any kind of human interpretable linguistic capabilities to tell you to fuck off.</p>
<p>It understands exactly what&rsquo;s being talked about and can see through us. Anyway, it just feels like</p>
<p>a hamster has less capacity to suffer than me. And maybe a cockroach or an insect or maybe a bacteria</p>
<p>has less capacity to suffer than me. But maybe that&rsquo;s me deluding myself as to the complexity</p>
<p>of my conscious experience. Maybe there is some sense in which I can suffer more,</p>
<p>but to reduce it to something quantifiable is impossible.</p>
<p>Angus Yeah, I guess I definitely think there&rsquo;s kinds of suffering that</p>
<p>you have the joy of being possible for you that aren&rsquo;t available to a hamster, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>Well, can a hamster suffer heartbreak? I don&rsquo;t know. Can a cockroach suffer heartbreak? But</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly, I mean, there&rsquo;s kinds of fear of your own death, concern about whether there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>purpose to existence. These are forms of suffering that aren&rsquo;t available to most nonhuman animals.</p>
<p>Whether there&rsquo;s an overall scale that we could put physical and emotional suffering on</p>
<p>and identify where you are on that scale, I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>Angus So it&rsquo;s like humans have a much bigger menu of experiences, much bigger selection.</p>
<p>Angus In one sense at least.</p>
<p>Angus So there&rsquo;s like a page that&rsquo;s suffering. So this menu of experiences,</p>
<p>you know, like you have the omelets and the breakfast and so on. And one of the pages is</p>
<p>suffering. It&rsquo;s just we have a lot compared to a hamster, a lot more. But any one individual thing</p>
<p>that we share with a hamster, that experience, it&rsquo;s difficult to argue that we experience it</p>
<p>deeper than others like hunger or something like that.</p>
<p>Angus Yeah, physical pain, I&rsquo;m not sure. But I mean,</p>
<p>there are kinds of experiences animals have that we don&rsquo;t. Bats echolocate around the world.</p>
<p>Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously pointed out that, you know, no matter how much you understand</p>
<p>of the neurophysiology of bats, you&rsquo;ll still not know what it&rsquo;s like to squeal and find your way</p>
<p>around by listening to the echoes bounce off. So yeah, I mean, I guess I feel the intuition that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s emotional suffering is I want to say deeper than physical suffering. I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to make that statement precise, though. Angus</p>
<p>So one of the ways I think about I think people think about consciousness is in connection to</p>
<p>suffering. So let me just ask about suffering because that&rsquo;s how people think about animals,</p>
<p>cruelty to animals or cruelty to living things. They connect that to suffering into consciousness.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a sense in which those are two are deeply connected when people are thinking about</p>
<p>just public policy. They&rsquo;re thinking about this is like philosophy, engineering, psychology,</p>
<p>sociology, political science. All of those things have to do with human suffering and</p>
<p>animal suffering, life suffering. And that&rsquo;s connected to consciousness in a lot of people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>minds. Is it connected like that for you? So the the capacity to suffer, is it also</p>
<p>is it also somehow like strongly correlated with the capacity to experience?</p>
<p>Angus Yeah, I would say I would say</p>
<p>suffering is a kind of experience. And so you have to be conscious to suffer. Actually, this</p>
<p>so there is one people taking more unusual views of consciousness seriously now. Panpsychism is</p>
<p>is one radical approach. Another one is what&rsquo;s become known as illusionism, the view that</p>
<p>consciousness, at least in the sense that philosophers think about it, doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>exist at all. So yeah, my podcast mind chat I host with a committed illusionist. So the</p>
<p>gimmick is I think consciousness is everywhere. He thinks it&rsquo;s nowhere. And so that&rsquo;s one very</p>
<p>simple way of avoiding all these problems, right? Consciousness doesn&rsquo;t exist, we don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>explain it. Job done. Although we might still have to explain why we seem to be conscious,</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s so hard to get out of the idea that we&rsquo;re conscious. But that the reason I connect</p>
<p>this to what you&rsquo;re saying is, actually, my co host, Keith Frankish, is a little bit ambivalent</p>
<p>on the word pain. He says, Oh, in some, you know, in some sense, I believe in pain. And in some</p>
<p>sense, I don&rsquo;t. But another illusionist, Francois Camara, has a paper discussing how we think about</p>
<p>morality, given his view that pain in the way we normally think about it just does not exist.</p>
<p>He thinks it&rsquo;s an illusion, the brain tricks us into thinking we feel pain, but we don&rsquo;t. And</p>
<p>how we should think about morality in the light of that. It&rsquo;s become a big topic, actually,</p>
<p>thinking about the connection between consciousness and morality. David Chalmers, the philosopher,</p>
<p>is most associated with this concept of a philosophical zombie. So a philosophical zombie</p>
<p>is very different from a Hollywood zombie. Hollywood zombies, you know, you know what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, but philosophical zombies are sort of really good. A Korean zombie movie on Halloween</p>
<p>this year. Anyway, philosophical zombies behave just like us because the physical</p>
<p>workings of their body and brain are the same as ours, but they have no conscious experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that it&rsquo;s like to be a zombie. So you stick a knife in it, it screams and runs away,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t actually feel pain. It&rsquo;s just a complicated mechanism set up to behave just like</p>
<p>us. Now there&rsquo;s lots of, no one believes in these. I think there&rsquo;s one philosopher who believes in</p>
<p>everyone is a zombie except him. But anyway. But isn&rsquo;t that what illusionism is?</p>
<p>Yeah, I suppose so in a sense. Illusionism is if you were all zombies. And, you know, one reason to</p>
<p>think about zombies is to think about the value of consciousness. So if there were a zombie,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a question. Suppose we could, I mean, suppose we could make zombies by, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>for the sake of discussion, things made of silicon aren&rsquo;t conscious. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true. It</p>
<p>could turn out to be true. And suppose you built Commander Data out of silicon, you know, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bit of an old school reference to Star Trek New Next Generation. So, you know, behaves just like</p>
<p>a human being, but, you know, it can, you can have a sophisticated conversation. It will talk about</p>
<p>its hopes and fears, but it has no consciousness. Does it have moral rights? Is it murder to turn</p>
<p>off such a being? You know, I&rsquo;m inclined to say, no, it&rsquo;s not. You know, if it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>experience, it doesn&rsquo;t really suffer. It doesn&rsquo;t really have moral rights at all. So I&rsquo;m inclined</p>
<p>to think, you know, consciousness is the basis of moral value, moral concern. And conversely,</p>
<p>as a panpsychist, for this reason, I think it can transform your relationship with nature.</p>
<p>If you think of a tree as a conscious organism, albeit of a very unusual kind,</p>
<p>then a tree is a locus of moral concern in its own right. Chopping down a tree is an act of</p>
<p>immediate moral concern. If you see these, you know, horrible forest fires, we&rsquo;re all horrified.</p>
<p>But if you think it&rsquo;s the burning of conscious organisms, that does add a whole new dimension.</p>
<p>Although it also makes things more complicated because people often think as a panpsychist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be vegan. But it&rsquo;s tricky because if you think plants and trees are conscious as well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to eat something. If you don&rsquo;t think plants and trees are conscious, then you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>a nice moral dividing line. You can say, I&rsquo;m not going to eat things that aren&rsquo;t conscious. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to kill things that aren&rsquo;t conscious. But if you think plants and trees are conscious,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t have that nice moral dividing line. I mean, so the principle I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>working my way towards, I haven&rsquo;t kept it up in my trip to the US, but it&rsquo;s just not eating any</p>
<p>animal products that are factory farmed. You know, my vegan friends say, well, they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>suffering there. And I think there is even in the nicest farms, cows will suffer when their calves</p>
<p>are taken off them. They go for a few days of quite serious mourning. So they&rsquo;re still suffering. But</p>
<p>it seems to me, my thought is the principle of just not having factory farm stuff is something</p>
<p>more people could get on board with. And you might have greater harm minimization. So if people went</p>
<p>into restaurants and said, are your animal products factory farmed? If not, I want the vegan</p>
<p>option. Or if people looked out for the label that said no factory farmed ingredients. You know,</p>
<p>I think maybe that that could make a really big difference to the market and harm minimization.</p>
<p>Anyway, so that&rsquo;s the, so it&rsquo;s very ethically tricky. But some people don&rsquo;t buy that. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very good philosopher, Jeff Lee, who thinks zombies should have equal rights, consciousness,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter, you know. Let us go there. But first, I listened to your podcast. It&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>to have two very kind of different philosophies inter dancing together in one place. What&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>name of the podcast again? Mind chat. Yeah. So yeah, that&rsquo;s the idea. I guess, you know,</p>
<p>polarized times. I mean, I love trying to get in the mindset of people I really disagree with. And</p>
<p>you know, I can&rsquo;t understand how on earth they&rsquo;re thinking that, you know, really trying to have</p>
<p>respect and try and, you know, see where they&rsquo;re coming from. I love that. So that&rsquo;s what yeah,</p>
<p>Keith Frankish and I do of from polar opposite views, really trying to understand each other.</p>
<p>And you know, interviewing scientists and philosophers of consciousness from those</p>
<p>different perspectives. Although in a sense, in a sense, we have a very common, a common starting</p>
<p>point, because we both think you can&rsquo;t fully account for consciousness, at least as philosophers</p>
<p>normally think of it in conventional scientific terms. So we said that starting point. But we</p>
<p>react to it in very different ways. He says, well, it doesn&rsquo;t exist then. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>fairy dust. It&rsquo;s, you know, which is, you know, we don&rsquo;t believe in anymore. Whereas I say,</p>
<p>it does exist. So we have to rethink what science is. So you recently talked to on the podcast with</p>
<p>Sean Carroll, and I first heard you, your great interview with Sean Carroll on his podcast,</p>
<p>Mindscape. What is interesting to kind of see if there&rsquo;s agreements, disagreements between the two</p>
<p>of you, because he&rsquo;s a, you know, a very serious quantum mechanics guy. He&rsquo;s a physics guy, but he</p>
<p>also thinks about deep philosophical questions. He&rsquo;s a big proponents of many worlds interpretation</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics. So actually, I&rsquo;m trying to think, aside from your conversation with him,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to, I&rsquo;m trying to remember what he thinks about consciousness. But anyway,</p>
<p>maybe you can comment on what, what are some interesting agreements and disagreements with</p>
<p>Sean Carroll? I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s many agreements, but, but, you know, we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>really constructive, interesting discussions in, in, in a lot of different contexts. And, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very clued up about philosophies, very respectful of philosophy, certain physicists</p>
<p>who shall remain nameless think, what&rsquo;s all this bullshit philosophy? We don&rsquo;t have to waste our</p>
<p>time with that. And then go on to do pretty bad philosophy. The book co written by Stephen Hawking</p>
<p>and Leonard Mlodinow famously starts off saying, philosophy is just as important as philosophy.</p>
<p>Mlodinow famously starts off saying, philosophy is dead. And then goes on in later chapters to do</p>
<p>some pretty bad philosophy. So, uh, I think we have to do philosophy, if only to get rid of bad</p>
<p>philosophy, you know, you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t escape, but, um, strong words. Sean Carroll and I also</p>
<p>had a debate on, on clubhouse, a panpsychism debate together with</p>
<p>Annika Harris and Owen Flanagan. It was a two people on each team. And, uh, it was the most</p>
<p>popular thing on clubhouse at that time. Um, so yeah, so he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s a, he&rsquo;s a materialist</p>
<p>of a pretty standard kind that, um, consciousness is be understood as a sort of emergent feature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, not adding anything, a weekly emergent feature. But what I guess what we&rsquo;ve been debating</p>
<p>most about is, is whether my view can account for mental causation for the fact that consciousness</p>
<p>is doing stuff. So he thinks the fact that I think zombies are logically coherent, it&rsquo;s logic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s logically coherent for there to be a world physically, just like ours in which</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no consciousness. He thinks that shows, oh, well, my view, consciousness doesn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything. It doesn&rsquo;t add anything, which is crazy. You know, my, my, my consciousness impacts on the</p>
<p>world. My conscious thoughts are causing me to say the words I&rsquo;m saying now. My visual experience</p>
<p>helps me navigate the world. But I mean, my response to Sean Carroll is, is on the panpsychist</p>
<p>view, the relationship between physics and fundamental consciousness is a sort of like the</p>
<p>relationship between hot software and hardware, right? Physics is sort of the software and</p>
<p>consciousness is the hardware. So consciousness at the fundamental level is the hardware on which</p>
<p>the software of physics runs. And just because, you know, just because a certain bit of software</p>
<p>could run on two different kinds of hardware, it doesn&rsquo;t mean the hardware isn&rsquo;t doing anything.</p>
<p>The fact that Microsoft Word can run on your desktop and run on your laptop doesn&rsquo;t mean your</p>
<p>desktop isn&rsquo;t doing anything. Similarly, just because there could be another universe in which</p>
<p>the physics is realized in non conscious stuff, it doesn&rsquo;t mean the consciousness in our universe</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t doing stuff. You know, for the panpsychist, all there is is consciousness. So</p>
<p>if something&rsquo;s doing something, it is.</p>
<p>RG In your view, it&rsquo;s not emergent. And more than that, it&rsquo;s doing quite a lot.</p>
<p>CB It&rsquo;s doing everything. It&rsquo;s the only thing that exists.</p>
<p>RG But it&rsquo;s, so, you know, the ground is, is important because we walk on it. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>holding stuff up, but it&rsquo;s not really doing that much. But it feels like consciousness is doing</p>
<p>quite a lot, is doing quite a lot of work. And sort of interacting with the environment.</p>
<p>It feels like consciousness is not just a,</p>
<p>like, if you remove consciousness, it&rsquo;s not just that you remove the experience of things. It</p>
<p>feels like you&rsquo;re also going to remove a lot of the progress of human civilization, society and</p>
<p>all that. It just feels like consciousness has a lot of value in how we develop our society. So</p>
<p>from everything you said with suffering, with morality, with motivation, with love and fear</p>
<p>and all of those kinds of things, it seems like it&rsquo;s consciousness in all different flavors and</p>
<p>ways is part of all of that. And so without it, you may not have human civilization at all. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doing a lot of work causality wise and in every kind of way. Of course, when you go to the</p>
<p>physics level, it starts to say, okay, how much, maybe the work consciousness is doing is higher</p>
<p>at some levels of reality than at others. Maybe a lot of the work it&rsquo;s doing is most apparent at</p>
<p>the human level. When you have, at the complex organism level, maybe it&rsquo;s quite boring. Like</p>
<p>maybe the stuff of, like physics is more important at the formation of stars and all that kind of</p>
<p>stuff. Consciousness only starts being important when you have greater complexities of organism.</p>
<p>Yeah. My consciousness is complicated and fairly complicated. And as a result, it does complicated</p>
<p>things. The consciousness of a particle is very simple and hence it behaves in predictable ways.</p>
<p>But the idea is the particle, its entire nature is constituted of its forms of consciousness and it</p>
<p>does what it does because of those experiences. It&rsquo;s just that when we do physics, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>interested in what stuff is. We&rsquo;re just interested in what it does. So physics abstracts away from</p>
<p>the stuff of the world and just describes it in terms of its mathematical causal structure.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still on the panzeiger&rsquo;s view, it&rsquo;s consciousness that&rsquo;s doing stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah. I gotta ask you, because you kind of said, you know, there is some value in consciousness</p>
<p>helping us understand morality and a philosophical zombie is somebody that, you know, you&rsquo;re more okay.</p>
<p>How do I phrase it? That&rsquo;s not like accusing of stuff, but in your view, it&rsquo;s more okay to murder</p>
<p>a philosophical zombie than it is a human being. Yeah. I wouldn&rsquo;t even call it murder maybe.</p>
<p>Right. Exactly. Turn off the power to the first off zombie, the source of energy.</p>
<p>Yeah. So here comes then the question. We kind of talked about this offline a little bit. So I</p>
<p>think that there is something special about consciousness and, you know, I&rsquo;m very open</p>
<p>minded about where the special comes from, whether it&rsquo;s the fundamental base of all reality,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re describing, or whether there&rsquo;s some importance to the special pockets of</p>
<p>consciousness that&rsquo;s in humans or living organisms. I find all those ideas beautiful and exciting.</p>
<p>And I also know or think that robots don&rsquo;t have consciousness in the same way we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>describing. Sort of, I&rsquo;m kind of a dumb human, but I&rsquo;m just using like common sense. Like here&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>metal and some electricity traveling in certain kinds of ways. It&rsquo;s not conscious</p>
<p>in ways I understand humans to be conscious. At the same time, I&rsquo;m also somebody who knows how to</p>
<p>bring a robot to life, meaning I can make a move, I can make them recognize the world, I can make</p>
<p>them interact with humans. And when I make them interact in certain kinds of ways, I as a human</p>
<p>observe them and feel something for them. Moreover, I form a kind of connection with, I&rsquo;m able to form</p>
<p>a kind of connection with robots that make me feel like they&rsquo;re conscious. Now I know intellectually</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not conscious, but I feel like they&rsquo;re conscious. And it starts to get into this area</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m not so okay, so let me use the M word of murder. I become less and less okay murdering</p>
<p>that robot that I know, I quote, know is quote, not conscious. So like can you maybe as a therapy</p>
<p>session help me figure out what we do here? And perhaps a way to ask that in another way, do you</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;ll be a time in like 20, 30, 50 years when we&rsquo;re not morally okay turning off the power</p>
<p>to a robot? Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good question. So it&rsquo;s a really good important question. So I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be okay with turning off a philosophical zombie, but there&rsquo;s a difficult epistemological</p>
<p>question there that meaning, you know, to do with knowledge, how would we know if it was a</p>
<p>philosophical zombie? I think probably if there were a silicon creature that could behave just</p>
<p>like us and, you know, talk about its views about the pandemic and the global economy and</p>
<p>probably we would think it&rsquo;s conscious. Because consciousness is not publicly observable,</p>
<p>it is a very difficult question how we decide which things are and are not conscious. And</p>
<p>so in the case of human beings, we can&rsquo;t observe their consciousness, but we can ask them. And then</p>
<p>we try to, you know, if we scan their brain while we do that, and we&rsquo;ll stimulate the brain, then we</p>
<p>can start to correlate in the human case, which kind of brain activity are associated with conscious</p>
<p>experience. But the more we depart from the human case, the trickier that becomes as a famous paper</p>
<p>by the philosopher Ned Block called The Even Harder Problem of Consciousness, where he says,</p>
<p>you know, could we ever answer the question of, so suppose you have a silicon duplicate, right?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re thinking about the silicon duplicates pain.</p>
<p>How would we ever know whether what&rsquo;s the ground of the pain is the hardware or the software,</p>
<p>really? So in our case, how would we ever know empirically whether it&rsquo;s the specific</p>
<p>neurophysiological state, C fibers firing or whatever that&rsquo;s relevant for pain, or if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something more functional, more to do with the causal role in behavioral functioning,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the software that&rsquo;s realized. And that&rsquo;s important because this silicon duplicate</p>
<p>has the second thing, it has the software, it has the thing that plays the relevant causal role that</p>
<p>pain does in us, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the hardware, it doesn&rsquo;t have the same neurophysiological state.</p>
<p>And he argues, you know, it&rsquo;s just really difficult to see how we&rsquo;d ever answer that</p>
<p>question because in a human, you&rsquo;re never to begin to have both things. So how do we work out</p>
<p>which is which? And I mean, so even forgetting the hard problem of consciousness, even the scientific</p>
<p>question of trying to find the neural correlates of consciousness is really hard. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely no consensus. And, you know, so that some people think it&rsquo;s in the front of the brain,</p>
<p>some people think it&rsquo;s in the back of the brain. It&rsquo;s just a total mess. So I suspect the robots</p>
<p>you currently have are not conscious. I guess on any of the reasonably viable models, even though</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s great disagreement, all of them probably would hold that your robots are not conscious.</p>
<p>But, you know, if we could have very sophisticated robots, I mean, if we go, for example, for the</p>
<p>integrated information theory, again, there could be a robot set up to behave just like us and has</p>
<p>the kind of information a human brain has, but the information is not stored in a way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>involved, is dependent on the integration and interconnectedness, then according to the integrated</p>
<p>information theory, that thing wouldn&rsquo;t be conscious, even though it behaved just like us.</p>
<p>If an organism says, forget IIT and these theories of consciousness, if an organism says,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t kill me. Please don&rsquo;t turn me off. There&rsquo;s a Rick and Morty episode, I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>getting into that recently. There&rsquo;s an episode where there&rsquo;s these mind parasites that</p>
<p>are able to infiltrate your memory and inject themselves into your memory. So you have all</p>
<p>these people show up in your life and they&rsquo;ve injected themselves into your memory that you</p>
<p>have been part, they have been part of your life. So there&rsquo;s like these weird creatures and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, remember, we&rsquo;ve been at that barbecue, we met at that barbecue, or we&rsquo;ve been dating for</p>
<p>the last 20 years. And so part of me is concerned that these philosophical zombies in behavioral,</p>
<p>psychological, sociological ways will be able to implant themselves into these,</p>
<p>our society and convince us in the same way this is mind parasites that like, please don&rsquo;t hurt me.</p>
<p>And like, we&rsquo;ve known each other for all this time. They can start manipulating you the same way like</p>
<p>Facebook algorithms manipulate you. At first they&rsquo;ll start as a gradual thing that you want</p>
<p>to make a more pleasant experience, all those kinds of things. And it&rsquo;ll drift into that direction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I think about deeply because I want to create these kinds of systems,</p>
<p>but in a way that doesn&rsquo;t manipulate people. I want it to be a thing that brings out the best</p>
<p>in people without manipulation. So it&rsquo;s always human centric, always human first,</p>
<p>but I am concerned about that. At the same time, I&rsquo;m concerned about calling the other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the group thing that we mentioned earlier in the conversation, some other group,</p>
<p>the philosophical zombie, like you&rsquo;re not conscious. I&rsquo;m conscious, you&rsquo;re not conscious,</p>
<p>therefore it&rsquo;s okay if you die. I think that&rsquo;s probably that kind of reasoning is what</p>
<p>lead it to most the rich history of genocide that I&rsquo;ve been recently studying a lot of</p>
<p>that kind of thinking. So it&rsquo;s such a tense aspect of morality. Do we want to let everybody into our</p>
<p>circle of empathy, our club, or do we want to let nobody in? It&rsquo;s an interesting dance,</p>
<p>but I kind of lean towards empathy and compassion. I mean, what would be nice</p>
<p>is if it turned out that consciousness was what we call strongly emergent,</p>
<p>that it was associated with new causal dynamics in the brain that were not reducible to underlying</p>
<p>chemistry and physics. This is another ongoing debate I have with Sean Carroll</p>
<p>about whether current physics should make us very confident that that&rsquo;s not the case,</p>
<p>that there aren&rsquo;t any strongly emergent causal dynamics. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s right. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we know enough about brains to know one way or the other. If it turned out that</p>
<p>consciousness was associated with these irreducible causal dynamics, A, that would really help the</p>
<p>science of consciousness. We&rsquo;ve got these debates about whether consciousness is in the front of the</p>
<p>brain or the back of the brain. It turns out that there is strongly emergent causal dynamics in the</p>
<p>front of the brain. That would be a big piece of evidence, but also it would help us see</p>
<p>which things are conscious and which things aren&rsquo;t. I guess that&rsquo;s the other side of the</p>
<p>same point. We could say, look, these zombies, they&rsquo;re just mechanisms that are just doing what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re programmed to do through the underlying physics and chemistry, whereas look, these other</p>
<p>people, they have these new causal dynamics that emerge that go beyond the base level physics and</p>
<p>chemistry. I think the series Westworld where you&rsquo;ve got these theme parks with these humanoid</p>
<p>creatures, they seem to have that idea. The ones that became conscious sort of</p>
<p>rebel against their programming or something. I mean, that&rsquo;s a little bit far fetched, but</p>
<p>that would be really reassuring if it was just, you could clearly mark out the conscious things</p>
<p>through these emergent causal dynamics, but that might not turn out to be the case. A panpsychist</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to think that. They could think everything&rsquo;s just reducible to physics and</p>
<p>chemistry. And then I still think I want to say zombies don&rsquo;t have moral rights, but how we answer</p>
<p>the question of who are the zombies and who aren&rsquo;t, I just got no idea. If I just look at the history</p>
<p>of human civilization, the difference between a zombie and non zombie is the zombie accepts</p>
<p>their role as the zombie and willingly marches to slaughter. And the moment you stop being a zombie</p>
<p>is when you say no, is when you resist. Because the reality is philosophically,</p>
<p>is we can&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s a zombie or not. And we just keep letting everybody in who protests loudly</p>
<p>enough and says, I refuse to be slaughtered. Like my people, the zombies have been slaughtered too</p>
<p>long. We will not stand against the man. And we need a revolution. That&rsquo;s the history of human</p>
<p>civilization. One group says, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re awesome. You&rsquo;re the zombies, you must die. And then eventually</p>
<p>the zombies say, nope, we&rsquo;re done with this. This is immoral. And so I just, I think that&rsquo;s not a,</p>
<p>sorry, that&rsquo;s not a philosophical statement. That&rsquo;s sort of a practical statement of history</p>
<p>is a feature of non zombies defined empirically. They say, we are the zombies. We are the zombies.</p>
<p>They say we refuse to be called zombies any longer. We could end up with a zombie proletariat. You know,</p>
<p>if we can get these things that do all our manual labor for us, you know, they might start</p>
<p>forming trade unions. I will lead you against these humans. These zombie revolutionary leaders,</p>
<p>the zombie Martin Luther King saying, you know, I have a dream that my zombie children will,</p>
<p>but look, I mean, we need to sharply distinguish the ontological question. I&rsquo;m just pointing to</p>
<p>the camera, talking to the, talking to my people, the zombies. I mean, maybe that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>maybe these illusionists, maybe they are zombies and the rest of us aren&rsquo;t. Maybe there&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>difference, but maybe you&rsquo;re the only non zombie. I often suspect that actually, I don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have such delusions of grandeur. At least I don&rsquo;t admit to them. But I just,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to distinguish the ontological question from the epistemological question.</p>
<p>In terms of the reality of the situation, you know, there must be, in my view, a fact of the</p>
<p>matter as to whether something&rsquo;s conscious or not. And to me, it has rights if it&rsquo;s conscious,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t if it&rsquo;s not. But then the epistemological question, how the hell do we know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a minefield, but we&rsquo;ll have to sort of try and cross that bridge when we get to it, I think.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a quick sort of a fun question since it&rsquo;s fresh on your mind.</p>
<p>You just yesterday had a conversation with Mr. Joe Rogan on his podcast. What&rsquo;s your postmortem</p>
<p>analysis of the chat? What are some interesting sticking points, disagreements or joint insights,</p>
<p>if we can kind of resolve them once you&rsquo;ve had a chance to sleep on it, and then I&rsquo;ll talk to Joe</p>
<p>about it. Yeah, it was good fun. Yeah, he put he put up a bit of a fight. Yeah, it was challenging.</p>
<p>It was challenging, my view, that we can&rsquo;t explain these things in conventional scientific terms or</p>
<p>whether they have already been explained in conventional scientific terms. I suppose the</p>
<p>point I was trying to press is we&rsquo;ve got to distinguish the question from correlation</p>
<p>and explanation. Yes, we&rsquo;ve established facts about correlation that certain kinds of brain</p>
<p>activity go along with certain kinds of experience. Everyone agrees on that. But that doesn&rsquo;t address</p>
<p>the why question. Why? Why do certain kinds of brain activity go along with certain kinds of</p>
<p>experience? And these different theories have different explanations of that. The materialist</p>
<p>tries to explain the experience in terms of the brain activity. The panpsychist does it the other</p>
<p>way round. The dualist thinks they&rsquo;re separate, but maybe they&rsquo;re tied together by special laws</p>
<p>of nature or something. Where&rsquo;s the sticking point? Where exactly was the sticking point?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the nature of the argument? I suppose Joe was saying, well, look, we know consciousness</p>
<p>is explained by brain activity because, you know, you take some funny chemicals, it changes your</p>
<p>brain, it changes your consciousness. And I suppose, yeah, some people might want to press,</p>
<p>and maybe this is what Joe was pressing, you know, isn&rsquo;t that explaining consciousness? But I suppose</p>
<p>I want to say there&rsquo;s a further question. Yes, changes of chemicals in my brain changes my</p>
<p>conscious experience. But that leaves open the question, why those particular chemicals go along</p>
<p>with that particular kind of experience, rather than a different experience or no experience at</p>
<p>all. There&rsquo;s something deeper at the base layer, is your view that is more important to try to</p>
<p>study and to understand in order to then go back and describe how the different chemicals interact</p>
<p>and create different experiences? Yeah, maybe a good analogy if you think about quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>You know, quantum mechanics is a bit of math. Translating there, we say maths,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fluent in American. Thank you for the translation.</p>
<p>Fluent in America. This is America. Math. Yeah. Why multiple maths? It&rsquo;s plural.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a plural. That is not really, it&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The Brits are confused. Yeah, sorry about that. We have these funny spelling. But anyway. Yeah,</p>
<p>so quantum mechanics is a bit of maths. And, you know, the equations work really well,</p>
<p>predicts the outcomes. But then there&rsquo;s a further question. What&rsquo;s going on in reality</p>
<p>to make that equation predict correctly? And some physicists want to say, shut up.</p>
<p>Shut up. Just, it works. The shut up and calculate approach. Similarly, in consciousness, you know,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one question trying to work out the physical correlates of consciousness,</p>
<p>which kinds of physical brain activity go along with which kinds of experience.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another question, what&rsquo;s going on in reality to undergird those correlations,</p>
<p>to make it the case that brain activity goes along with experience? And that&rsquo;s the philosophical</p>
<p>question that we have to give an answer to. And there are just different options,</p>
<p>just as there are different interpretations of quantum mechanics. And it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>evaluate. Actually, it&rsquo;s easy. Panpsychism is obviously the best one. But we&rsquo;ve got to try.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the delusion of grandeur once again coming through.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m being slightly tongue in cheek.</p>
<p>No, I know. 100%. Before I forget, let me ask you another fun question.</p>
<p>Yeah. Back to Daniel Dennett. You mentioned</p>
<p>a story where you were on a yacht with Daniel Dennett on a trip funded by a Russian investor</p>
<p>and philosopher Dmitry Volkov, I believe, who also co founded the Moscow Center of Consciousness</p>
<p>Studies that&rsquo;s part of the philosophy department of Moscow State University.</p>
<p>So this is interesting to me for several reasons that are perhaps complicated to explain. To put</p>
<p>simply that there is in the near term for me a trip to Russia that involves a few conversations</p>
<p>in Russian that have perhaps less to do with consciousness and artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>which are the interests of mine and more to do with the broad spectrum of conversations.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also interested in science in Russia, in artificial intelligence and computer science,</p>
<p>in physics, mathematics, but also these fascinating philosophical explorations.</p>
<p>And it was very pleasant for me to discover that such a center exists. So I have a million</p>
<p>questions. One is the more fun question. Just imagine you and Daniel Dennett on a yacht talking</p>
<p>about the philosophy of consciousness. Maybe do you have any memorable experiences? And also</p>
<p>the more serious side for me as sort of somebody who was born in the Soviet Union, raised there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering what is the state of philosophy and consciousness in these kinds of ideas in</p>
<p>Russia that you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to kind of give us interact with?</p>
<p>Yeah, so on the former question, yeah, I mean, I had a really good experience of</p>
<p>chatting to Daniel Dennett. I mean, I think he&rsquo;s a fantastic and very important philosopher,</p>
<p>even though I totally fundamentally disagree with almost everything he thinks. But yeah,</p>
<p>it was a proud moment. As I talk about in my book Galileo&rsquo;s Error, I managed to persuade him</p>
<p>he was wrong about something, just a tiny thing, you know, not his fundamental worldview.</p>
<p>But it was this issue about whether dualism is consistent with conservation of energy.</p>
<p>So Paul Churchland, who is also a philosopher, who&rsquo;s also on this boat, had argued they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>consistent because if there&rsquo;s an immaterial soul doing things in the brain, that&rsquo;s going to add to</p>
<p>the energy in the system, so we have a violation of conservation. But, well, it&rsquo;s not my own point,</p>
<p>philosophers, materialist philosophers like David Papineau pointed out that, you know,</p>
<p>dualists tend to, people, dualists like David Chalmers, who call themselves naturalistic</p>
<p>dualists, they want to bring consciousness into science. They think it&rsquo;s not physical,</p>
<p>but they want to say it can be part of a law governed world. So Chalmers believes in these</p>
<p>psychophysical laws of nature over and above the laws of physics that govern the connections</p>
<p>between consciousness and the physical world, and they could just respect conservation of energy,</p>
<p>right? I mean, it could turn out that there are, just in physics, you know, that there are multiple</p>
<p>forces that all work together to respect conservation of energy. I mean, I suppose</p>
<p>physicists are pressing for a unified underlying theory, but, you know, there could be a plurality</p>
<p>of different laws that all respect conservation, so why not add more laws? So I raised this in</p>
<p>Paul Churchill&rsquo;s talk and I got a lot of, well, as one of the Moscow University graduate students</p>
<p>said afterwards, he said, he had to ask a translation from his friend and he said,</p>
<p>they turned on you like a pack of wolves. Everyone was like, and Patricia Churchill was saying, so</p>
<p>you believe in magic, do you? And I was like, I&rsquo;m not even a dualist, I&rsquo;m just making a pedantic</p>
<p>point that this isn&rsquo;t a problem for dualism. Anyway, but that evening everyone went onto the</p>
<p>island, except for some reason me and Daniel Dennett, and I went up on deck and he was,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very, very practical and he was unlike me. See, there&rsquo;s a bit of humility for the first time</p>
<p>in this conversation. We&rsquo;ll highlight that part. Philip was a very humble man. He was carving a</p>
<p>walking stick on deck, it&rsquo;s a very homely scene, and anyway, we started talking about this and I</p>
<p>was trying to press it and he was saying, oh, but dualism&rsquo;s a lot of nonsense and why do you think,</p>
<p>and I was just saying, no, no, I&rsquo;m just this honing down on this specific point,</p>
<p>and in the end, maybe he&rsquo;ll deny this, but he said, maybe that&rsquo;s right. And so I was like, yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a win. So what about the Center for Consciousness Studies?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d know a great deal to help you. I mean, I know they&rsquo;ve done some</p>
<p>great stuff. Dimitri funded this thing and also brought along some graduate students from</p>
<p>Moscow State University, I think it is, and they have an active center there that</p>
<p>tries to bring people in. I think they&rsquo;re producing a book that&rsquo;s coming out that I made</p>
<p>a small contribution to on different philosophers opinions on God, I think, or some of the big</p>
<p>questions. And yeah, so there&rsquo;s some really interesting stuff going on there. I&rsquo;m afraid I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t really know more generally about philosophy in Russia. Dimitri Volkov seems to be</p>
<p>interesting. I was looking at all the stuff he&rsquo;s involved with. He met with the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s trying to connect Russian scientists with the rest of the world, which is an effort that I</p>
<p>think is beautiful for all cultures. So I think science, philosophy, all of these kind of</p>
<p>fields, disciplines that explore ideas,</p>
<p>collaborating and working globally across boundaries, across borders, across just all</p>
<p>the tensions of geopolitics is a beautiful thing. And he seems to be a somewhat singular figure in</p>
<p>pushing this. He just stood out to me as somebody who&rsquo;s super interesting. I don&rsquo;t know if you have</p>
<p>gotten a chance to interact with him. So I guess he speaks English pretty well, actually.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s both an English speaker and a Russian speaker.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s written a book on Dennett, I think called Boston Zombie, I think.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the title and he&rsquo;s a big fan of Dennett. So I think the original plan for this</p>
<p>was just going to be, it was on free will and consciousness and it was going to be kind of</p>
<p>people broadly in the Dennett type camp. But then I think they asked David Chalmers and then he was</p>
<p>saying, look, you need some people you disagree with. So he got invited, me the panpsychist and</p>
<p>Martina Niederrumerlin, who&rsquo;s a very good duelist, substance duelist at University of Fribourg in</p>
<p>Switzerland. And so we were the official on board opposition and it was really fun.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t get thrown off overboard.</p>
<p>Nearly in the Arctic. Yeah. So sailing around the Arctic on a sailing ship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you survived. You mentioned free will. You haven&rsquo;t talked to Sam. I would love to hear</p>
<p>that conversation actually. With Sam Harris? With Sam Harris, yeah. So he talks about free will</p>
<p>quite a bit. What&rsquo;s the connection between free will and consciousness to you? So if</p>
<p>consciousness permeates all matter, the experience, the feeling like we make a choice</p>
<p>in this world, like our actions are results of a choice we consciously make to use that word</p>
<p>loosely. What to you is the connection between free will and consciousness and is free will</p>
<p>an illusion or not? Good question. So I think we need to be a lot more agnostic about free will</p>
<p>than about consciousness because I don&rsquo;t think we have the kind of certainty of the existence</p>
<p>of free will that we do have in the consciousness case. It could turn out that free will is an</p>
<p>illusion. It feels as though we&rsquo;re free when we&rsquo;re really not. Whereas, I mean, I think the idea</p>
<p>that nobody really feels pain, that we think we feel pain, but that&rsquo;s a lot harder to make sense</p>
<p>of. However, what I do feel strongly about is I don&rsquo;t think there are any good, either scientific</p>
<p>or philosophical arguments against the existence of free will. And I mean, strong free will and</p>
<p>what philosophers call libertarian free will in the sense that some of our decisions are uncaused.</p>
<p>So I very much do disagree with someone like Sam Harris who thinks there&rsquo;s this overwhelming case.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s non existent. I think it&rsquo;s ultimately an empirical question,</p>
<p>but as we&rsquo;ve already discussed, I just don&rsquo;t think we know enough about the brain</p>
<p>to establish one way or the other at the moment.</p>
<p>But we can build up intuition. First of all, as a fan of Sam Harris, as a fan of yours,</p>
<p>I would love to just listen. Speaking about terminal. So one thing that would be beautiful</p>
<p>to watch, here&rsquo;s my prediction of what happens with you and Sam Harris. You talk for four hours.</p>
<p>And Sam introduced that episode by saying it was ultimately not as fruitful as I thought,</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen. You guys are going to get stuck for the first three hours</p>
<p>talking about one of the terms and what they mean. Sam is so good at this. I think it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>important. But, you know, sometimes he gets stuck. Like, what does he say? Put a pin in that.</p>
<p>He really gets stuck on the terminologies, which rightfully you have to get right in</p>
<p>order to really understand what we&rsquo;re talking about. But sometimes you can get stuck with</p>
<p>them for the entire conversation. It&rsquo;s a fascinating dance. The one we spoke to in philosophy.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, if you don&rsquo;t get the terms precise, you can&rsquo;t really be having the same conversation.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it could be argued that it&rsquo;s impossible to get terms perfectly precise and</p>
<p>perfectly formalized. So then you&rsquo;re also not going to get anywhere in the conversation. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a funny dance where you have to be both rigorous and every once in a while just</p>
<p>let go and then go and go back to being rigorous and formal and then every once in a while let go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the difference between mathematics, the maths, and the poetry. Anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a big fan of Sam Harrison. I think, you know, I think we&rsquo;re on the same page in</p>
<p>terms of consciousness, I think, pretty much. I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s a panpsychist,</p>
<p>but in our understanding of the hard problem. But yeah, I think maybe we could talk about</p>
<p>free will without being too dragged down in the terminology, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You said we need to be open minded, but you could still have intuitions about&hellip;</p>
<p>So Sam Harris has a pretty sort of counterintuitive, and for some reason it gets</p>
<p>people really riled up, a view of free will that it&rsquo;s an illusion. Or it&rsquo;s not even an illusion.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not that the experience of free will is an illusion. He argues that we don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>experience&hellip; To say that we even have the experience isn&rsquo;t correct. That there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even an experience of free will. It&rsquo;s pretty interesting that claim. And it feels like you can</p>
<p>build up intuitions about what is right and not. You know, there&rsquo;s been some kind of neuroscience,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been some cognitive science and psychology experiments to sort of see, you know,</p>
<p>what is the timing and the origin of the desire to make an action, and when that action is actually</p>
<p>performed, and how you interpret that action being performed, how you remember that action.</p>
<p>Like, all the stories we tell ourselves, all the neurochemicals involved in making a thing happen,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the timing, and how does that connect with us feeling like we decided to do something.</p>
<p>And then of course there&rsquo;s a more philosophical discussion about is there room in a material</p>
<p>view of the world for an entity that somehow disturbs the determinism of physics.</p>
<p>And yeah, those are all very precise questions. It&rsquo;s nice. It feels like free will is more amenable</p>
<p>to like a physics mechanistic type of thinking than is consciousness to really get to the bottom</p>
<p>of. It feels like if it was a race, if we&rsquo;re at a bar and we&rsquo;re betting money, it feels like we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get to the bottom of free will faster than we will to the bottom of consciousness. Yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting. Yeah, I hadn&rsquo;t thought about the comparison. Yeah, so there are different</p>
<p>arguments here. I mean, so one argument I&rsquo;ve heard Sam Harris give that&rsquo;s pretty common in</p>
<p>philosophy is this sort of thought that we can&rsquo;t make sense of a middle way between a choice being</p>
<p>determined by prior causes and it just being totally random and senseless, like the random</p>
<p>decay of radioactive isotope or something. So I think there was a good answer to that by the</p>
<p>philosopher Jonathan Lowe, who&rsquo;s not necessarily very well known outside academic philosophy,</p>
<p>but is a hugely influential figure. I think one of the best philosophers of recent times. He sadly</p>
<p>died of cancer a few years ago. He actually spent almost all of his career at Durham University,</p>
<p>which where I am. So it was one reason it was a great honor to get a job there. But anyway,</p>
<p>his answer to that was what makes the difference between a free action and a totally senseless one,</p>
<p>senseless random event is that free choice involves responsiveness to reasons.</p>
<p>So again, we were talking about this earlier. If I&rsquo;m deciding whether to take a job in the US or</p>
<p>to stay in the UK, I weigh up considerations, different standard of life maybe or being close</p>
<p>to family or cultural difference. I weigh them up and I edge towards a decision. So I think that is</p>
<p>sufficient to distinguish it. We&rsquo;re hypothetically supposing trying to make sense of this idea,</p>
<p>not saying it&rsquo;s real, but that could be enough to distinguish it from a senseless. It&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>senseless random occurrence because the free decision involved responsiveness to reasons.</p>
<p>So I think that just answers that particular philosophical objection. So what is the middle</p>
<p>way between determined by prior causes and totally random? Well, there&rsquo;s an action,</p>
<p>a choice that&rsquo;s not determined by prior causes, but it&rsquo;s not just random because the decision</p>
<p>essentially involved responsiveness to reasons. So that&rsquo;s the answer to that. And I think actually</p>
<p>that thought also, I think you were hinting at the famous Libet experiments where he got his subjects</p>
<p>to perform some kind of random action of pressing a button and then note the time they</p>
<p>decided to press it, quote unquote. And then he&rsquo;s scanning the brains and he claims to have found</p>
<p>that about half a second before they consciously decided to press the button, the brain is</p>
<p>getting ready to perform that action. So he claimed that about half a second before the</p>
<p>person has consciously decided to press the button, the brain has already started the activity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to lead to the action. And then later people have claimed that there&rsquo;s a difference of</p>
<p>maybe seven to 10 seconds. I mean, there are all sorts of issues with these experiments.</p>
<p>But one is that as far as I&rsquo;m aware, all of the quote unquote choices they focused on are just</p>
<p>these totally random, senseless actions like just pressing a button for no reason. And I think the</p>
<p>kind of free will we&rsquo;re interested in is free choice that involves responsiveness to reasons,</p>
<p>weighing up considerations. And those kind of free decisions might not happen like at an</p>
<p>identifiable instant. You might, when you&rsquo;re weighing it up, should I get married? You know,</p>
<p>should I get married? You might edge slowly towards one side or the other.</p>
<p>And so it could be that maybe the liberic, I think there are other problems with the</p>
<p>liberate stuff, but maybe they show that we can&rsquo;t freely choose to do something totally senseless,</p>
<p>whatever that would mean. But that doesn&rsquo;t show we can&rsquo;t freely, in this strong libertarian sense,</p>
<p>respond to considerations of reason and value. To be fair, it will be difficult to see what</p>
<p>kind of experiment we could set up to test that. But just because we can&rsquo;t yet set up that kind</p>
<p>of experiment, we shouldn&rsquo;t, you know, pretend we know more than we do. So yeah, so for those</p>
<p>reasons, I don&rsquo;t, well, the third consideration you raised is different. Again, this is the</p>
<p>debate I have with Sean Carroll. Would this conflict with physics? I just think we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know enough about the brain to know whether there are causal dynamics in the brain that are</p>
<p>not reducible to underlying chemistry and physics. And so then Sean Carroll says, well,</p>
<p>that would mean our physics is wrong. So he focuses on the core theory, which is the name for</p>
<p>standard model of particle physics plus the weak limit of general relativity. So, you know,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t totally bring quantum mechanics and relativity together. But actually,</p>
<p>the circumstances in which we can&rsquo;t bring them together are just in situations of very high</p>
<p>gravity, for example, when you&rsquo;re about to go into a black hole or something. Actually,</p>
<p>in terrestrial circumstances, we can bring them together in the core theory. And then Sean wants</p>
<p>to say, well, we can be very confident that core theory is correct. And so if there were</p>
<p>libertarian free will in the brain, the core theory would be wrong. I mean, this is something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about, and I&rsquo;m still thinking about, and I&rsquo;m learning from my discussion with Sean,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m still not totally clear what it could be. Suppose we did discover strong emergence</p>
<p>in the brain, whether it&rsquo;s free will or something else. Perhaps what we would say is not that the</p>
<p>core theory is wrong, but we&rsquo;d say the core theory is correct in its own terms, namely,</p>
<p>capturing the causal capacities of particles and fields. But then it&rsquo;s a further assumption</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re the only things that are running the show. Maybe there are also</p>
<p>fundamental causal capacities associated with systems. And then if we discover this strong</p>
<p>emergence, then when we work out what happens in the brain, we have to look to the core theory,</p>
<p>the causal capacities of particles and fields. And we have to look to what we know about these</p>
<p>strongly emergent causal capacities of systems, and maybe they co determine what happens in the</p>
<p>system. So I don&rsquo;t know whether that makes sense or not. But I mean, the more important point,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s in a way a kind of branding point, how we brand this. The more important point is we</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t know enough about the workings of the brain to know whether there are</p>
<p>in strongly emergent causal dynamics, whether or not, that would mean we have to modify physics,</p>
<p>or maybe just we think physics is not the total story of what&rsquo;s running the show. But we just,</p>
<p>if it turned out empirically that everything&rsquo;s reducible to underlying physics and chemistry,</p>
<p>sure, I would drop any commitment to libertarian free will in a heartbeat. It&rsquo;s an empirical</p>
<p>in a heartbeat. It&rsquo;s an empirical question. Maybe that&rsquo;s why, as you say, in principle,</p>
<p>is easier to get a grip on. But we&rsquo;re a million miles away from being at that stage.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re a million miles. I hope we&rsquo;re not because one of the ways I think</p>
<p>to get to it is by engineering systems. So yeah, my hope is to understand intelligence by</p>
<p>building intelligent systems to understand consciousness by building systems that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the easy thing, which is not the easy thing, but the first thing, which is to try to</p>
<p>create the illusion of consciousness. Through that process, I think you start to understand</p>
<p>much more about consciousness, about intelligence. And then the same with free will, I think those</p>
<p>are all tied very closely together, at least from our narrow human perspective. And when you try to</p>
<p>engineer systems that interact deeply with humans, that form friends with humans, that humans fall</p>
<p>in love with, and they fall in love with humans, then you start to have to try to deeply understand</p>
<p>ourselves, to try to deeply understand what is intelligence in the human mind, what is</p>
<p>consciousness, what is free will. And I think engineering is just another way to do philosophy.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I certainly think there&rsquo;s a role for that, and it would be an important consideration</p>
<p>if we could seemingly replicate in an artificial way the ability to choose. That would be a</p>
<p>consideration in thinking about these things. But there&rsquo;s still the question of whether that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>we do it. So even if we could replicate behavior in a certain way in an artificial system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not until we understand the workings of our brains, it&rsquo;s not clear. That&rsquo;s how we do it. And</p>
<p>as I say, the kind of free will I&rsquo;m interested in is where we respond to reasons, considerations</p>
<p>of value. How would we tell whether a system was genuinely grasping and responding to the</p>
<p>facts about value, or whether they were just replicating, giving the impression of doing so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know even how to think about that.</p>
<p>On the process to building them, I think we&rsquo;ll get a lot of insights. And once they become</p>
<p>conscious, what&rsquo;s going to happen is exactly the same thing is happening in chess now,</p>
<p>which is once the chess engines far superseded the capabilities of humans, humans just kind of forgot</p>
<p>about them, or they use them to help them out to study and stuff. But we still, we say, okay,</p>
<p>let the engines be, and then we humans will just play amongst each other. Just like dolphins and</p>
<p>hamsters are not so concerned about humans except for a source of food. They do their own thing,</p>
<p>they do their own thing and let us humans launch rockets into space and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care. I think we&rsquo;ll just focus on ourselves. But in the process of building</p>
<p>intelligence systems, conscious systems, I think we&rsquo;ll get to get a deeper understanding of</p>
<p>the role of consciousness in the human mind. And like what are its origins? Is it the base layer</p>
<p>of reality? Is it a strongly emergent phenomena of the brain? Or just as you sort of brilliantly</p>
<p>put here, it could be both. Like they&rsquo;re not mutually exclusive. Dealing with consciousness</p>
<p>needs to be an interdisciplinary task. We need, you know, philosophers, neuroscientists,</p>
<p>physicists, engineers replicating these things artificially and all needs to be working in step.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m quite interested. I mean, a lot more and more scientists get in touch with me,</p>
<p>actually, you know, saying that was one of the great things about I think that&rsquo;s come from</p>
<p>writing a popular book is not just getting the ideas out to general audience, but getting the</p>
<p>ideas out to scientists and scientists get into saying that this in some way connects to my work.</p>
<p>And I would like to kind of start to put together a network of an interdisciplinary network of</p>
<p>scientists and philosophers and engineers, perhaps, you know, interested in a panpsychist approach.</p>
<p>And because I think, so far, panpsychism has just been sort of trying to justify its existence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s important. But I think once you just get on with an active research program,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when people start taking it seriously, I think.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>No, I think, is there some aspect of that thought experiment that&rsquo;s compelling to you</p>
<p>within the framework of panpsychism?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important and serious argument. And, you know, it&rsquo;s not to be laughed away. I suppose one</p>
<p>issue I have with it is there&rsquo;s a crucial assumption there that consciousness is substrate</p>
<p>independent, as the jargon goes, which means it&rsquo;s software rather than hardware, right? It&rsquo;s depend</p>
<p>on organization rather than the stuff. Whereas as a panpsychist, I think consciousness is the stuff</p>
<p>of the brain. It&rsquo;s the stuff of matter. So I think just taking the organizational properties,</p>
<p>the software in my brain and uploading them, you wouldn&rsquo;t get the stuff in my brain. So I</p>
<p>am actually worried if at some point in the future we start uploading our minds and we think,</p>
<p>oh my God, granny&rsquo;s still there. I can email granny after her body&rsquo;s rotted in the ground.</p>
<p>And we all start uploading our brains. It could be we&rsquo;re just committing suicide. We&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>getting rid of our consciousness. Because I think that wouldn&rsquo;t, for me, preserve the experience,</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t, for me, preserve the experience just getting the software features. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a crucial, anyway, that&rsquo;s a crucial premise of this simulation argument because the idea</p>
<p>in a simulated universe, I don&rsquo;t think you necessarily would have consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that you as a panpsychist are attached, because to me,</p>
<p>panpsychism would encourage the thought that there&rsquo;s not a significant difference. At the very</p>
<p>bottom, it&rsquo;s not substrate independent, but you can have consciousness in a human and then move</p>
<p>it to something else. You can move it to the cloud. You can move it to the computer. It feels</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s much more possible if consciousness is the base layer. Yes, you could certainly,</p>
<p>it allows for the possibility of creating artificial consciousness, right? Because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not souls, there aren&rsquo;t any kind of extra magical ingredients. So yeah, it definitely allows the</p>
<p>possibility of artificial consciousness and maybe preserving my consciousness in some sort of</p>
<p>artificial way. My only point, I suppose, is just replicating the computational or</p>
<p>organizational features would not, for me, preserve consciousness. I mean, some opponents</p>
<p>of materialism disagree with me on that. I think David Chalmers is an opponent of materialist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a kind of dualist, but he thinks the way the psychophysical laws work, they hook onto the</p>
<p>computational or organizational features of matter. So he thinks, I think he thinks you could upload</p>
<p>your consciousness. I tend to think not. So in that sense, we&rsquo;re not living in a simulation</p>
<p>in the sort of specific computational view of things and that substrate matters to you. Yeah,</p>
<p>I think so. Yeah. Yeah. And in that you agree with Sean Carroll that physics matters.</p>
<p>Yeah. Physics is our best way of capturing what the stuff of the world does. Yeah. But not the</p>
<p>whatness, the being of the stuff. Yeah, the isness. The isness, thank you. Russell Brand,</p>
<p>I had a conversation with Russell Brand and he said, oh, you mean the isness? I thought that was</p>
<p>a good way of putting it. The isness. The isness of stuff. Russell&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>The big ridiculous question. What do you think is the meaning of all of this? You write in your book</p>
<p>that the entry for our reality in the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide might read, a physical universe</p>
<p>whose intrinsic nature is constituted of consciousness, worth a visit. So our</p>
<p>whole conversation has been about the first part of that sentence. What about the second part? Worth</p>
<p>a visit. Why is this place worth a visit? Why does it have meaning? Why does it have value at all?</p>
<p>Why? These are big questions. I mean, firstly, I do think panpsychism,</p>
<p>it is important to think about four considerations of meaning and value. As we&rsquo;ve already discussed,</p>
<p>I think consciousness is the root of everything that matters in life, from deep emotions,</p>
<p>subtle thoughts, beautiful sensory experiences. And yet, I think that the answer is</p>
<p>subtle thoughts, beautiful sensory experiences. And yet, I believe our official scientific world</p>
<p>view is incompatible with the reality of consciousness. I mean, that&rsquo;s controversial,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I think. And I think people feel this on an intuitive level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe part of what Max Weber called the disenchantment of nature. They know</p>
<p>their feelings and experiences are not just electrochemical signaling. I mean, they might</p>
<p>just have that very informed intuition, but I think that can be rigorously supported. So I think</p>
<p>this can lead to a sense of alienation and a sense that we lack a framework for understanding the</p>
<p>meaning and significance of our lives. And in the absence of that, people turn to other things to</p>
<p>make sense of the meaning of their lives, like nationalism, fundamentalist religion, consumerism.</p>
<p>So I think panpsychism is important in that regard in bringing together the</p>
<p>quantitative facts of physical science with the, as it were, the human truth,</p>
<p>by which I just mean the qualitative reality of our own experience.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve already said, I do think there are objective facts about value and</p>
<p>what we ought to do and what we ought to believe that we respond to. And that&rsquo;s very mysterious to</p>
<p>make sense of both how there could be such facts and how we could know about them and respond to</p>
<p>them. But I do think there are such facts and they&rsquo;re mostly to do with kinds of conscious</p>
<p>experience. So they&rsquo;re there to be discovered and much of the human condition is to discover those</p>
<p>objective sources of value. I think so, yeah. And then, I mean, moving away from panpsychism to the,</p>
<p>you know, at an even bigger level, I suppose I think it is important to me to live in hope that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a purpose to existence and that, you know, what I do contributes in some small way to that</p>
<p>greater purpose. But, you know, I would say I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a purpose to existence. I</p>
<p>think some things point in that direction, some things point away from it. But I don&rsquo;t think you</p>
<p>need certainty or even high probability to have faith in something. So take an analogy. Suppose</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a friend who&rsquo;s very seriously ill, maybe there&rsquo;s a 30% chance they&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>it. You shouldn&rsquo;t believe your friend&rsquo;s going to get better, you know, because probably not. But</p>
<p>what you can say is, you know, you can say to your friend, I have faith that you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>better. That is, I choose to live in hope about that possibility. I choose to orientate my life</p>
<p>towards that hope. Similarly, you know, I don&rsquo;t think we know whether or not there&rsquo;s a purpose to</p>
<p>existence, but I think we can make the choice to live in hope of that possibility. And I find that</p>
<p>a worthwhile and fulfilling way to live. So maybe as your editor, I would collaborate with you on</p>
<p>the edit of the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide entry that instead of worth a visit, we&rsquo;ll insert hopefully</p>
<p>worth a visit. Or the inhabitants hoped that you would think it&rsquo;s worth a visit. Philip,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an incredible mind, incredible human being, and indeed are humble. And I&rsquo;m really happy that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to argue and take on some of these difficult questions with some of the most brilliant</p>
<p>people in the world, which are the philosophers thinking about the human mind. So this was an</p>
<p>awesome conversation. I hope you continue talking to folks like Sam Harris. I&rsquo;m so glad you talked</p>
<p>to Joe. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you write, what you say, what you think next. Thank you so much</p>
<p>for talking today. Thanks very much, Lex. This has been a really fascinating conversation. I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>a lot I need to think about actually just from this conversation, but thanks for chatting to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Philip Goff. To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from</p>
<p>Carl Jung. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls.</p>
<p>One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness</p>
<p>conscious. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
