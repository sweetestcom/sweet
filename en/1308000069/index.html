    <p>So, Sax, are we going to talk with each other today or, you know, or is an ISO</p>
<p>player?</p>
<p>He turned into an ISO player.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like the Carmelo Anthony of this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the Carmelo Anthony of the all in pod.</p>
<p>Sax, you want to pass the ball or you just want to you want to clank it off the room?</p>
<p>Raymond, I think we should have a focus on having a dialogue with each other</p>
<p>today, several points in the thing, as opposed to all standing up,</p>
<p>saying our piece and then we lost a little bit of the fiber of this team here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three people playing as a team.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s I would love to ask you questions and I would love</p>
<p>my job to pass the ball, Jake.</p>
<p>Al, you&rsquo;re the guard.</p>
<p>You pass the ball.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m supposed to score.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Remember what Shaq used to say when he wasn&rsquo;t getting the ball?</p>
<p>He gets really unhappy.</p>
<p>So pass the ball to the big dog.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll score.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m Shaq.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re you know, you&rsquo;re not Kobe.</p>
<p>Who is the shitty little like Fisher?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Derek Fisher.</p>
<p>Make sure the big dog gets the ball.</p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t be any problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Bob Cousy. OK, I&rsquo;m Gary Payton in this.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Satterthwaite.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s said we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Queen of Kinwam.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, welcome to the all in podcast</p>
<p>where three besties talk about a range of talking topics and one monologues</p>
<p>about Biden derangement syndrome with you again this week,</p>
<p>the sultan of science and the dictator.</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya, David Friedberg, and playing</p>
<p>Iso ball somewhere in the wing is your political commentator.</p>
<p>Tucker Jr., Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an active projection.</p>
<p>First story, which Sachs is going to lose his mind over.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got two monologues prepared.</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau has invoked an emergency order to freeze bank accounts</p>
<p>linked to trucker protests in Canada.</p>
<p>On Monday, Trudeau invoked an emergency law</p>
<p>that requires financial institutions in Canada to examine customer records</p>
<p>and take action against people involved with or aiding in the protest.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Trudeau&rsquo;s tweet from yesterday.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re watching on the video streams, illegal blockades</p>
<p>and occupations are not peaceful protests.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a threat to jobs and communities, and they cannot continue.</p>
<p>In the House of Commons earlier today, I joined members of the Parliament</p>
<p>to speak about that and about the need</p>
<p>to invoke the Emergencies Act, the counter signal,</p>
<p>which is a right leaning Canadian digital publication reported</p>
<p>that 34 different crypto wallets were also being targeted by Canadian officials.</p>
<p>This law grants the government extraordinary powers</p>
<p>like the right to ban public assembly in certain locations.</p>
<p>The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said a plan to challenge</p>
<p>the government&rsquo;s decision in court.</p>
<p>Remember, Sachs wrote a piece on financial</p>
<p>deplatforming for Bari Weiss&rsquo;s Common Sense about a year ago.</p>
<p>The piece was about the private sector financial platforms, deplatforming folks.</p>
<p>So your thoughts, Sachs, you have 90 seconds on the uninterrupted clock</p>
<p>on the shot clock. All right.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jake. It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Last summer, I wrote a piece for Barry Weiss</p>
<p>is some stack talking about how financial</p>
<p>deplatform would be the next wave of online censorship.</p>
<p>And here we are. It&rsquo;s actually happened.</p>
<p>What I could not have predicted is that it would occur in our mild manner</p>
<p>neighbor to the north and that the reprisals would be directed</p>
<p>by the government itself, not just a consortium of private actors.</p>
<p>And what Trudeau has done is he didn&rsquo;t just employ the Emergency Act</p>
<p>against the truckers so that he could basically arrest them and break up</p>
<p>the protest.</p>
<p>They have now directed banks and any financial institution,</p>
<p>even cryptocurrency wallets to freeze the accounts, not just of the truckers,</p>
<p>but anybody who&rsquo;s contributed to them.</p>
<p>Basically, anyone has contributed twenty five dollars or more.</p>
<p>There were two crowdfunding sites that they raised money from.</p>
<p>All those people, the thousands of of just ordinary Canadians</p>
<p>who did nothing more than contribute to an anti-government protest.</p>
<p>They are now at risk of financial ruin because their bank accounts have been frozen.</p>
<p>And you have to wonder what is the ends here that justifies the means.</p>
<p>COVID, you know, Omicron is on the wane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on its way out.</p>
<p>At the same time that Trudeau was announcing these dictatorial measures,</p>
<p>Ford, the the guy who runs Ontario, the largest province, 15 seconds</p>
<p>forward, was out there saying that he was going to that COVID mandates</p>
<p>were going to be over.</p>
<p>So why exactly are they doing this?</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re at the end of COVID.</p>
<p>And let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>If if there were people online making donations to the criminals who loot</p>
<p>and kill people in San Francisco, which you&rsquo;ve railed against</p>
<p>being criminals who are breaking the law and should all be put behind bars.</p>
<p>Do you think that it would be appropriate in that context for the government</p>
<p>to block their donations to supporting criminal activity in a criminal ring?</p>
<p>You know that I think we all agree, you know, shouldn&rsquo;t shouldn&rsquo;t be transpiring.</p>
<p>Well, but your the implication there is that truckers are using violence</p>
<p>or something like that, and they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s been largely a peaceful protest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been very annoying to people who, you know.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t the case being made that they are actually breaking the law</p>
<p>by blocking streets?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not you know, there&rsquo;s a peaceful protest</p>
<p>where you can go and get a permit and actually go in a public zone</p>
<p>and peacefully protest within the confines of the law</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s allowed in that jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Look, but what these folks are doing is civil disobedience,</p>
<p>which is not a peaceful protest.</p>
<p>It is, you know, kind of breaking the law to make a point.</p>
<p>It is peaceful because there&rsquo;s been no violence.</p>
<p>If you look at actual videos, they&rsquo;re breaking the law. Right.</p>
<p>Well, let me let me ask the question for free bird and sex.</p>
<p>If a group of truckers were shutting down the Bay Bridge</p>
<p>with three lanes of traffic and then shut down the 280 and the 101</p>
<p>and it impacted this, if they in fact are shutting down roads</p>
<p>and our businesses and ambulances can&rsquo;t get through,</p>
<p>would you want them to be towed?</p>
<p>Would you want their cars to be towed?</p>
<p>Listen, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>The ambassador bridge, this vital choke point of commerce</p>
<p>between the US and Canada that was blocked and that was creating a serious problem.</p>
<p>But it had already been cleared on Monday by the time that Trudeau</p>
<p>invoked the Emergencies Act.</p>
<p>And then on Tuesday, he then invokes the Financial Act.</p>
<p>Your opinion, Saks, if they if they block roads and bridges,</p>
<p>would you if they were in charge?</p>
<p>Yeah. If they&rsquo;re breaking the law in that way, it&rsquo;s not just one lane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all three lanes damages society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to understand the standard here, because</p>
<p>just zooming out to last year and the year before, right,</p>
<p>there was a protest happening with BLM and those BLM protests</p>
<p>resulted in damage to private property, to burning cars.</p>
<p>There were protests at the Capitol that involved folks trespassing</p>
<p>into federal land and federal buildings.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s protests that are, you know, blocking vital trade routes</p>
<p>and, you know, access to emergency vehicles and all this sort of stuff to me.</p>
<p>And also, you know, people in San Francisco breaking the law</p>
<p>and not being put in jail.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is anyone that&rsquo;s breaking the law.</p>
<p>We should stop them for breaking the law.</p>
<p>And anyone that wants to kind of, you know, follow a peaceful protest</p>
<p>or make a point should kind of make the point.</p>
<p>But if the law is the law, shouldn&rsquo;t there be a universal standard</p>
<p>to hold up the law?</p>
<p>And if the case and if the case is people are giving money to aid</p>
<p>in breaking the law, shouldn&rsquo;t we stop the transmission?</p>
<p>Hold on. Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Look, I think you&rsquo;re conflating a bunch of really important things there.</p>
<p>Aiding and abetting criminals is already illegal.</p>
<p>There are RICO statutes that allow the authorities</p>
<p>to go after people that are aiding and abetting.</p>
<p>Through monetary support, criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Separately, there is a whole body of law at the federal state</p>
<p>local level that allows you to deal with protests. OK.</p>
<p>The real question is, why did you have to go and invoke emergency powers</p>
<p>at the tail end of a pandemic for what is effectively</p>
<p>nonviolent protests?</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s the key question, right?</p>
<p>So just to give you some Canadian history</p>
<p>as a Canadian citizen, what I can tell you is that we&rsquo;ve invoked</p>
<p>this Emergency Powers Act three times in the past.</p>
<p>The first was for World War two.</p>
<p>The second sorry, World War one.</p>
<p>The second was for World War two.</p>
<p>And the third was the FLQ crisis, which was a domestic terrorist</p>
<p>organization in Quebec that was fighting for a separate homeland.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s those are the three other times in the past that a sitting</p>
<p>prime minister has invoked these broad sweeping emergency powers.</p>
<p>And they did it because you exhaust the natural body of law</p>
<p>and the Constitution and the bill of the Charter of Rights that governs</p>
<p>the normal behavior of a democratic society.</p>
<p>What this was is not any of those things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody could claim that a bunch of nonviolent protests.</p>
<p>Yes, they were annoying.</p>
<p>Yes, they basically, you know, stop some commerce.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it was on the order of World War one, World War two</p>
<p>or a domestic terrorism issue like the FLQ crisis.</p>
<p>So why invoke this basically get out of jail free card</p>
<p>where you can behave without any checks and balances?</p>
<p>This is the confounding.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Did we exhaust the current body of normal governing law?</p>
<p>And if we didn&rsquo;t, why is this example OK?</p>
<p>And the counterfactuals are so many.</p>
<p>Imagine Trump invoked this thing during BLM.</p>
<p>Imagine Biden did this right now.</p>
<p>Right. You would be up in arms.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s well said.</p>
<p>And we just have to make sure that the Emergencies Act that Trudeau invoked</p>
<p>requires something like an act of espionage against the country</p>
<p>or Syria, the word serious violence or in the law or the threat of serious violence.</p>
<p>Those conditions were simply not met.</p>
<p>Yeah. And then on top of that, to go after people who contribute</p>
<p>as little as $25 to these truckers who are trying to support them</p>
<p>because these guys are not making any money.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re they have very they&rsquo;re living under very harsh conditions.</p>
<p>So you make a small check.</p>
<p>You write a small donation to support these people, to aid them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re simple working class people who are protesting for normalcy</p>
<p>and to get their freedom back.</p>
<p>And now all of a sudden your bank account gets frozen.</p>
<p>It is basically creating a it&rsquo;s going to have a chilling effect</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s essentially creating a cast of untouchables</p>
<p>because no one is going to want to associate with, transact with or donate</p>
<p>to this group of people, these designated people now under the Emergencies Act</p>
<p>who your bank can get frozen if you deal with them.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to blow up in Trudeau&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>This is the worst decision making by any major political leader in a long time</p>
<p>to go after a group of people, as Chamath said, in the in the waning days</p>
<p>of a pandemic, what is the point?</p>
<p>Why are we picking this? Why is he picking this?</p>
<p>Why do you guys? So why? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>But why is he doing it?</p>
<p>And Chamath, why? Why did the police not break?</p>
<p>So I totally hear your point.</p>
<p>Why did the police not break up these protests?</p>
<p>Why did he need to invoke the emergency?</p>
<p>Because, look, it happened.</p>
<p>I think that the police in some cases did.</p>
<p>In some cases didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There were probably a lot of police sympathizers.</p>
<p>There were probably a lot of sympathizers in general,</p>
<p>as there were a lot of people who were detractors.</p>
<p>Are you think the police you&rsquo;re saying there were police that were complicit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the nature of a protest.</p>
<p>You have people for you have people against.</p>
<p>But the point is, I think what&rsquo;s really clear is Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>First, basically said these people are racists and misogynists.</p>
<p>Then he said they just hold views that are just unacceptable to me.</p>
<p>And then like a totalitarian dictator invoked an emergency measures</p>
<p>act that allows him to do what he wants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fact pattern.</p>
<p>He painted himself into a political corner and then tried to give successfully.</p>
<p>He gave himself absolute power for some period of time.</p>
<p>And the real question, I think, is why should this be allowed to happen</p>
<p>in a democratic country?</p>
<p>With democratic norms against people that haven&rsquo;t done,</p>
<p>as far as I can tell, a shred of violent behavior?</p>
<p>No, it hasn&rsquo;t been.</p>
<p>You guys think and where it&rsquo;s clear that the body of normal governing law</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been exhausted yet, meaning the minute that these people</p>
<p>were asked to actually empty the ambassador bridge, they did.</p>
<p>Guys, we&rsquo;re Canadians.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>Yes, we love super nice.</p>
<p>But if you just ask us, we&rsquo;re just going to do it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Trudeau never tried talking to them.</p>
<p>I mean, why wouldn&rsquo;t he just try and talk?</p>
<p>Why would he just try and negotiate with them?</p>
<p>Instead, he demonized them right off the bat as white supremacists</p>
<p>and Nazis and even, you know, confederates or which I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>understand in the context of Canada.</p>
<p>This is a yet another example of the dying death right in front of us</p>
<p>of the woke playbook, right?</p>
<p>We talked about this last week.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s related to the San Francisco Board of Ed recall.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s now national and probably even international news.</p>
<p>The the the reaction to Rogan, the reaction to Dave Chappelle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part and parcel of this thing where people up and down the</p>
<p>spectrum have learned what the mechanism of action is of this cancel</p>
<p>culture, and they don&rsquo;t fall for it anymore.</p>
<p>Trudeau did not get the memo.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a person that&rsquo;s able to escalate it because he&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>in a seat of power, and that&rsquo;s what I think people should be debating.</p>
<p>You mean shutting down dissenting voices from a position of power?</p>
<p>Just because.</p>
<p>And he went on the record.</p>
<p>He went on the record and he said, guys, these views are unacceptable to me.</p>
<p>Well, in a democratic society, that&rsquo;s not your choice.</p>
<p>Yeah, not your choice, Justin.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>you could have engaged the views on all kinds of topics all the time.</p>
<p>Unacceptable is not the threshold of World War Two, World War One in the</p>
<p>FLQ crisis.</p>
<p>Do you guys think that there&rsquo;s a moment here that also is a mile marker on</p>
<p>the road towards the state versus crypto, given the actions that were</p>
<p>Bitcoin wallets, because that seems to be like a big trend that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>play out over the next decade or two.</p>
<p>There are plenty.</p>
<p>Inevitably, crypto is the threat to the state, right?</p>
<p>And so, you know, you&rsquo;re going to see skirmishes like this that kind of, you</p>
<p>know, hey, wallets that donate are illegal.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>Freedberg, this is one of the best points you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>If you look at what this has done to Bitcoin, and you look at what it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>for other cryptocurrencies, this will do more than McDonald&rsquo;s accepting</p>
<p>Bitcoin, because this is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever seen a cryptocurrency</p>
<p>accepting Bitcoin, because this is the first time like a Western democratic</p>
<p>state is seizing people&rsquo;s funds, like in an incredibly unfair, unnecessary</p>
<p>way, which is just going to have more people say, you know what, maybe I</p>
<p>should keep some of my net worth out of the government&rsquo;s purview, if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to seize it anyway.</p>
<p>And then now people are going to start looking into the coins that allow</p>
<p>people to conflate having an enemy with having a different view.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t the same thing.</p>
<p>Having an enemy is a serious deal, right?</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s domestic or international.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we had to do in World War One World War Two in the FLQ crisis.</p>
<p>This is just somebody who has a different opinion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree in mask mandates is what one person says.</p>
<p>I want to mask mandate is what the other person says the idea that you</p>
<p>can deep platform one or the other or fire them from their job or prevent</p>
<p>them from having access to the money that they&rsquo;ve earned or preventing</p>
<p>other people from donating money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s a really low bar.</p>
<p>And I think when you normalize this kind of behavior, it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>slippery slope.</p>
<p>And so if if somebody else were to do it, they now have like it&rsquo;s again</p>
<p>going back to the Rene Girard sort of philosophical discussion from</p>
<p>last week.</p>
<p>One of the things about you know, these stoning rituals, right that</p>
<p>sacks talked about that we talked about last week.</p>
<p>One of the things that Rene Girard talks about is it is always hardest</p>
<p>for that first person, right?</p>
<p>The first person that throws the stone, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Jesus was able to defuse that that incident as described in</p>
<p>the book of John, but in a different example, the first person that</p>
<p>throws a stone all of a sudden normalizes it for everybody else after</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>And then these stonings become commonplace or became commonplace.</p>
<p>So similarly, it&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re a sitting Democratic person who just</p>
<p>decides this doesn&rsquo;t work for you.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t flip the script and and basically remove everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Democratic rights.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually had a closing point you want to make?</p>
<p>Well, okay, just on this point about Bitcoin, the reason why Bitcoin</p>
<p>is necessary is because the tactics that Trudeau is using is essentially</p>
<p>to starve these truckers out to not only basically arrest them, but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also taking away their insurance licenses.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically preventing them from ever working again.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talked about that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to put give you a criminal record.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to make it hard for you to get a job.</p>
<p>And then most importantly, on top of that, he&rsquo;s preventing anyone from</p>
<p>helping them by contributing to them by making a donation.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s essentially starving these guys out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason why Bitcoin is potentially helpful is it allows</p>
<p>people using non custodial wallets to make an end run around that and</p>
<p>donate and help these these people who are being persecuted, essentially.</p>
<p>I mean, he could have just simply chosen to do what sacks his favorite</p>
<p>President Obama did with Occupy Wall Street, which is say, great, you</p>
<p>have something you want to voice.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where you can do it.</p>
<p>Just, you know, no guns, no violence.</p>
<p>But we let how long did Occupy Wall Street last in downtown Wall Street</p>
<p>and in Oakland and other places like a year or two, and you just wait</p>
<p>them out. And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I think when you encounter a sincere protest movement, the first thing</p>
<p>you should do as a leader is actually listen and try to understand what</p>
<p>it is that they&rsquo;re protesting on behalf of.</p>
<p>And Trudeau never did that.</p>
<p>He went straight to a to 11 with this.</p>
<p>And I think part of the reason why I mean, Jake, are you asked why?</p>
<p>Why is it that that, you know, there seems to be a common denominator</p>
<p>with this and with the Ukraine issue that the leaders are immediately</p>
<p>escalating these situations instead of looking for a way to deescalate</p>
<p>it and they&rsquo;re doing it with the media egging them on.</p>
<p>And so as harsh as Trudeau&rsquo;s rhetoric has been, the media&rsquo;s rhetoric</p>
<p>around this has been even worse.</p>
<p>You have this CNN contributor, Juliette Kayyem, who&rsquo;s also a Harvard</p>
<p>who basically tweeted that Trudeau needed to slash their tires, empty</p>
<p>the gas tanks, arrest the drivers, you know, making it unclear how</p>
<p>you never get the trucks off the bridge.</p>
<p>But then she said cancel their insurance, suspend their driver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>license, prohibit any future regulatory verification.</p>
<p>She says, trust me.</p>
<p>I will not run out of ways to make this hurt.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s you have the media cheering this on egging on Trudeau.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing the same thing beating the drums of war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>What is wrong with these people?</p>
<p>Yeah, deescalate.</p>
<p>And where&rsquo;s the off ramp?</p>
<p>I think the biggest the biggest story is this this Bitcoin thing</p>
<p>because, you know, if you guys think about like, pre 1960s, like</p>
<p>capital wasn&rsquo;t digitized.</p>
<p>It was like physical.</p>
<p>Like you had to own like a stock certificate or cash or gold or a</p>
<p>bearer bond today.</p>
<p>Everything is digitized, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a digital record of, you know, who owns what stock and</p>
<p>who how much is in your bank account and none of it is tied to your</p>
<p>having a physical asset and ultimately the law was able to reach into</p>
<p>these digital systems and have greater oversight and ultimately</p>
<p>control, you know, over accounts and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s had a, you know, the digitization of capital assets has had</p>
<p>an incredible ability to drive economic growth and investment and</p>
<p>ease of transaction, but it&rsquo;s also significantly increased the</p>
<p>centralization of assets or the central influence over assets.</p>
<p>Bitcoin seems to be the resolution to that.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re seeing the ultimate challenge to Bitcoin and the</p>
<p>challenge to decentralized systems like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to speak specifically to anyone, but there seems to be</p>
<p>like this trend line over the last 60 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s now being challenged because you can have your accounts frozen</p>
<p>any moment, you know, for breaking the law or because emergency acts</p>
<p>are are induced.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Probably going to accelerate interest in these kind of off government</p>
<p>chain.</p>
<p>If true, it&rsquo;s just a separate chain.</p>
<p>Anybody can do it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing it in China, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the point of it.</p>
<p>The digital yuan is like this incredible whole point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like absolute centralization of every capital asset.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets scary.</p>
<p>Think about dangerous.</p>
<p>The digital yuan is the minute you say something that Xi Jinping</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a stroke of a keyboard key and all your assets are all</p>
<p>your assets are locked away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a database entry and you just basically reroute who belong who</p>
<p>belongs to or it could be it could happen in America.</p>
<p>They say, you know what California now wants to have a wealth tax.</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s got money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going to take your money out of your account automatically.</p>
<p>Do you guys think we sound like a right wing politics show at this</p>
<p>point?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a right wing politics thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I think I think that we have so jumped the shark.</p>
<p>There are things that are happening today every day that you know, if</p>
<p>you had said in isolation two or three years ago, would any of these</p>
<p>things ever happen?</p>
<p>We all would have just looked at each other and said it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>that these things could happen.</p>
<p>And but the problem is fast forward two years of a pandemic.</p>
<p>I think we have let a lot of our civil liberties decay right under</p>
<p>our nose and we&rsquo;re not willing to fight for it because it&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>too tribal and rights have been politicized.</p>
<p>So the idea of having rights, you know, and then standing up for</p>
<p>your rights all of a sudden has to be a decision between whether</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re left or right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that liberties in the sense of government oversight</p>
<p>have decayed as in addition to that.</p>
<p>Liberties in the sense of a social setting have decayed, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve because of cancel culture, we&rsquo;ve normalized the ability to</p>
<p>silence minority or dissenting voices and this is both in the private</p>
<p>enterprise setting as well as in the public setting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s you know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself a right wing conservative person by any</p>
<p>stretch.</p>
<p>But I do consider myself a person who believes in individual freedom</p>
<p>and Liberty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called an American by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s basically being an American and I think, you know, as</p>
<p>we move on to this recall in San Francisco, I think Saks made a</p>
<p>really good point.</p>
<p>Like what are political leaders doing here?</p>
<p>Are they trying to stir the pot and antagonize these situations?</p>
<p>If you look, you know, Clinton, Obama, a lot of people previously</p>
<p>were trying to defuse these situations and then Biden seems to be</p>
<p>stirring the pot, Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>And then if you look at Trump with BLM, you know, and the immigration</p>
<p>stuff, he never sat down and met with him and he arguably antagonize</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>So I think this is a perfect segue into what happened.</p>
<p>And you know, so we should expect a little more from our political</p>
<p>leaders.</p>
<p>Great point from Saks.</p>
<p>You just brought up something incredible, you know, Trump railed</p>
<p>against these BLM folks, but at no point did he try to shut down their</p>
<p>bank accounts and take their money away.</p>
<p>And Trudeau can&rsquo;t, you know, this was not even near in the scale of</p>
<p>BLM.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the bigger authoritarian?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s clearly if you objectively it&rsquo;s Trudeau in this</p>
<p>situation.</p>
<p>The scary authoritarianism as we talked about in previous pods tends</p>
<p>to come from the left.</p>
<p>At least the right you see it coming.</p>
<p>I just want to read it&rsquo;s veiled under moral virtue signaling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very sanctimonious.</p>
<p>They claim they claim to be the defenders of the working class while</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually prosecuting them.</p>
<p>Such an unforced error, like, so dumb.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna lose, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna lose</p>
<p>if a DA was elected and a police office and police chief were elected</p>
<p>to San Francisco, that said we are going to freeze the bank accounts</p>
<p>and, you know, demobilize the criminals that are ransacking our</p>
<p>city, our people, our stores, would you support that?</p>
<p>No, not if it&rsquo;s an office and extrajudicial use of power.</p>
<p>I mean, the law specifies what you&rsquo;re allowed to do.</p>
<p>Do you think San Francisco&rsquo;s in an emergency situation?</p>
<p>I mean, would you support the mayor taking on emergency authority to</p>
<p>go and fix the problem, which she just did, by the way, in the</p>
<p>tenderloin?</p>
<p>Yeah, but that doesn&rsquo;t give her the power to go to Wells Fargo and</p>
<p>say to Wells Fargo, we want you to freeze all these accounts with</p>
<p>no due process of law.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what Trudeau has done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the overreach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the line.</p>
<p>You think is like go and see you should have to go through a court</p>
<p>proceeding to freeze someone&rsquo;s bank accounts, period.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t just freeze someone&rsquo;s bank account.</p>
<p>The law allows you to do this.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Rico.</p>
<p>So you follow the due process of the law and you can do all those</p>
<p>things free bird that you just mentioned if you want to free</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s bank account, right?</p>
<p>You can actually do that.</p>
<p>The government has the ability to do that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to pass this.</p>
<p>Basically get out of jail free card to do whatever you want without</p>
<p>any oversight.</p>
<p>And to Chamath&rsquo;s point earlier, have you exhausted the regular law</p>
<p>here?</p>
<p>They have the regular law haven&rsquo;t even tried.</p>
<p>You can buy Fentanyl for five bucks on, you know, anytime you</p>
<p>want.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, the all the provinces are ending COVID mandates</p>
<p>anyway.</p>
<p>So this whole issue is moot.</p>
<p>So dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this is like the stupidest behavior at the end of a pandemic</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve ever seen and shout out to George Lucas for getting it</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at the theme of Star Wars, it was like, oh, I</p>
<p>just need emergency powers for a minute because of a trade Federation</p>
<p>blockade.</p>
<p>And here we are a crisis, a fake crisis.</p>
<p>Yeah, that wasn&rsquo;t George Lucas, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, that goes back to the Roman Empire, right?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, yeah, that was the formation of the Empire Caesar</p>
<p>God, Caesar God emergency authority.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a tried and true.</p>
<p>And the poll, the polls are actually right.</p>
<p>And the polls show that the most of the public in Canada is</p>
<p>applauding.</p>
<p>So what was the line from Democracy dies to applause?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly that was Padme&rsquo;s line in the Star Wars films.</p>
<p>All right, they&rsquo;re aging.</p>
<p>Well, the prequels three members of San Francisco&rsquo;s Board of</p>
<p>Education were they were the worst just to be clear, but go</p>
<p>not compared to the three, just huge dumps that Disney took on</p>
<p>the our childhoods with the sequels, three members of the</p>
<p>San Francisco Board of Education were called this week.</p>
<p>Massively, they lost by between 72% and 79%.</p>
<p>These were the virtue signaling maniacs who wanted to change</p>
<p>the names of all the schools wouldn&rsquo;t reopen the schools,</p>
<p>yada, yada, and this really frustrated and they wanted to</p>
<p>get rid of elite AP classes.</p>
<p>All of this Jason they did they did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And these three board members are out.</p>
<p>So London Breed,</p>
<p>Jason, Jason, just to be clear in the middle of a pandemic.</p>
<p>I think my understanding is that instead of figuring out how</p>
<p>to get these kids back in class how to figure out how they</p>
<p>could take off their masks.</p>
<p>They wanted to drop Abraham Lincoln and George Washington&rsquo;s</p>
<p>name from schools because it was it was too regressive.</p>
<p>Yep, they canceled the gifted program because it made other</p>
<p>kids feel bad.</p>
<p>And a gentleman that wanted to serve on a committee</p>
<p>who I think was gay but not minority was excluded because</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t a minority.</p>
<p>Enough for them.</p>
<p>So these are the three people that 76% of San Francisco</p>
<p>citizens or you know residents just recalled and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not following this the tech industry had a major part in</p>
<p>this in terms of backing it.</p>
<p>There was a lot of claims which I&rsquo;ll let sacks address in</p>
<p>a moment that this was a Republican driven out of state</p>
<p>movement.</p>
<p>But if you look there are not a hundred thousand Republicans</p>
<p>in San Francisco in all likelihood.</p>
<p>This was actually parents and a lot of cases based on the</p>
<p>geography of San Francisco and the density of certain</p>
<p>populations.</p>
<p>A lot of Asian Americans came out in force in some neighborhoods</p>
<p>90% were voting to oust these people Gary tan who is a product</p>
<p>of the San Francisco public education system and a great</p>
<p>entrepreneur venture capitalist was a leader in this movement.</p>
<p>So congratulations to him and this all is going to culminate</p>
<p>I think in May or June sacks will correct me with the recall</p>
<p>effort for Chesa Boudin this killer da who will prosecute</p>
<p>anybody sacks.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this victory and full disclosure?</p>
<p>You were a major donor to this.</p>
<p>I was the second largest donor and I was the largest donor</p>
<p>under age 90.</p>
<p>Arthur Rock was the biggest donor.</p>
<p>What a badass by the way, the guy is 95 years old.</p>
<p>He donated to $400,000 to this recall.</p>
<p>He was in fairness.</p>
<p>You live in San Francisco.</p>
<p>This is a backdoor issue for you.</p>
<p>You care.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I think crime and schools are the key quality of life</p>
<p>issues in any community and it transcends partisan boundaries.</p>
<p>If your kids cannot get a quality education and you cannot</p>
<p>be safe in your community, nothing else matters and that</p>
<p>matters to Democrats just as much as Republicans and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why like you said three quarters of San Francisco voted for</p>
<p>this recall even though 85% of them voted for Biden.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s basically a 90% Democrat city.</p>
<p>So, you know all these claims that was a Republican recall</p>
<p>turned out to be nonsense.</p>
<p>This was something that was broadly supported and and you</p>
<p>know, look, it&rsquo;s the same reason that young can flipped a</p>
<p>you know, plus 10 Democrat state in Virginia, which is that</p>
<p>you know, it had a lot to do with school closures.</p>
<p>They kept the schools closed for a year and a half and then</p>
<p>when they were supposed to have conversation a PTA meeting</p>
<p>about reopening it like Jamal Smith said they spent five hours</p>
<p>debating whether to allow this beloved gay parent onto a</p>
<p>voluntary school board.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t they spent all their time, you know talking</p>
<p>about changing the names of the schools instead of how to</p>
<p>reopen them.</p>
<p>They also there&rsquo;s chronic mismanagement.</p>
<p>I mean the school is something like 125 million dollars in</p>
<p>debt despite, you know being in a very rich city open for</p>
<p>one day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Just so that they could get a state piece of the state budget</p>
<p>pie.</p>
<p>So these kids clamored back to school just so that they could</p>
<p>leave technically say, yeah, we were open and to get I think</p>
<p>it was a 12 or 13 million dollar check and then they shut</p>
<p>the schools down again, right?</p>
<p>And you brought a key point Jason, which is that the Asian</p>
<p>American community in San Francisco has been absolutely</p>
<p>galvanized by this issue because the school board also, you</p>
<p>know, Lowell High School is one of the best schools in the</p>
<p>city and it was merit-based and it had great advanced math</p>
<p>programs and this this board basically got rid of all that</p>
<p>stuff and it infuriated the Asian American community many</p>
<p>of whose most prominent members have basically risen out of</p>
<p>poverty because of the education they got at Lowell.</p>
<p>And so this war on merit that&rsquo;s happening is something that</p>
<p>is going to you know, flip the you know, Asian American</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p>I think to when I when I was growing up, I grew up in a French</p>
<p>ghetto of Ottawa.</p>
<p>And I was supposed to go to a local high school.</p>
<p>That was just plainly trash and I was able to go to an</p>
<p>equivalent of Lowell this a public magnet high school that</p>
<p>had advanced classes and everything a gifted program and</p>
<p>it really did change my life.</p>
<p>And so I really understand what people are saying, which is</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re in poverty, the only way out is through an</p>
<p>education.</p>
<p>Really, you may get, you know, get accidentally lucky, but the</p>
<p>only really predictable sustainable pattern here is is</p>
<p>through school.</p>
<p>And so when you deprive folks from being able to get a decent</p>
<p>education and there&rsquo;s no real, you know, orderly logic to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really ridiculous kind of an idea.</p>
<p>The other thing is I think that this speaks very powerfully.</p>
<p>As sack said as a non as a bipartisan issue that these</p>
<p>Democrats have to get right because you know, you saw this</p>
<p>also in Virginia where Democrats basically went down this</p>
<p>one tack and you know, the Republican candidate Glenn</p>
<p>Youngkin basically said, hey, listen, the schools are broken.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>We oppose a lot of what&rsquo;s going on the watering down and the</p>
<p>critical race theory, etc, etc.</p>
<p>And he put it to a vote and a lot of people cross the aisle</p>
<p>there as well, where typically ardent Democrats basically</p>
<p>voted for this Republican governor.</p>
<p>I think the point is that there are just several issues that</p>
<p>are just so transcend like they&rsquo;re just they transcend all</p>
<p>party lines.</p>
<p>And this is an anchor issue that we have to get right Friedberg.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Do you think this is the start of maybe a turnaround for San</p>
<p>Francisco because Chesa Boone is way more hated and safety is</p>
<p>an even bigger issue.</p>
<p>I think for a lot of people right now in San Francisco and</p>
<p>It dovetails with Asian hate and the number of Asian people</p>
<p>targeted in crimes.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got a I mean, if these people got out by 75% on average,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to be out by 95% is this a tipping point in San</p>
<p>Francisco going to make a read?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I think there&rsquo;s generally a broader</p>
<p>trend and momentum around what we classify as woke ism, which</p>
<p>I think is a little bit disparaging to the intention of</p>
<p>social justice and recognizing the primary points of social</p>
<p>justice through action and behavior in civic discourse and</p>
<p>government behavior.</p>
<p>And you know, this like the election of several da&rsquo;s around</p>
<p>the country who take a different stance to prosecution of crime</p>
<p>to try and create better options for rehab and so on.</p>
<p>I think is not a movement that&rsquo;s going to go away overnight.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s certainly a hefty amount of resistance, but</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re really doing right now is I think we&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>and realizing the boundaries of this movement and of this</p>
<p>moment, the one boundary that I think San Franciscans are too</p>
<p>bad in San Francisco, like, you know, as in the case in tech</p>
<p>has always been so progressive in terms of, you know, doing</p>
<p>these things faster than anyone else.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re realizing in San Francisco is non-prosecution</p>
<p>of criminals as the DA has undertaken over the past couple</p>
<p>of years leads to really heinous crime and rampant crime and</p>
<p>and this kind of social justice movement within the education</p>
<p>system causes a decline in the value of our education system.</p>
<p>Those are two really important learnings that San Francisco</p>
<p>has had over the past couple of years with this very important</p>
<p>and momentous kind of social justice movement, but it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean that the movement is over.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that quote-unquote woke ism is over.</p>
<p>It means that that social justice intent is still there, but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re realizing where the boundaries are and how far things</p>
<p>can and maybe should go.</p>
<p>I posted this article.</p>
<p>Tyler Collin, who&rsquo;s a, you know, pretty well-known economist.</p>
<p>He wrote this op-ed for the for Bloomberg and what he said is</p>
<p>that woke ism has peaked and there&rsquo;s just these two passages</p>
<p>that the builds on what freeberg said quote by woke ism.</p>
<p>I refer to a movement that on the positive side is highly aware</p>
<p>of racism and social injustice and is galvanized towards</p>
<p>raising awareness on the negative side.</p>
<p>It can be preachy alienating overly concerned with symbols</p>
<p>and self-righteous unquote.</p>
<p>And I think that that probably does summarize sort of like</p>
<p>where it starts, which is I think rooted in a very good place.</p>
<p>But unfortunately all too often where it ends, which is that</p>
<p>sort of moral absolutist judgment cancel culture around it.</p>
<p>And then the second quote that he said was the following.</p>
<p>He said quote woke ism is likely to evolve into a subculture</p>
<p>that is highly educated highly white and fairly feminine.</p>
<p>That is still a large mass of people but not enough to run</p>
<p>the country or all its major institutions in the San Francisco</p>
<p>school board recall.</p>
<p>For instance, the role of Asian Americans was especially</p>
<p>prominent unquote.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just think that all these things sort of people are looking</p>
<p>for affiliation and you start with labels that bring you in</p>
<p>and then you have to sort out are all these labels really</p>
<p>true and how true are they and I think we&rsquo;re in this moment</p>
<p>now where now that we know the mechanism of action of locus</p>
<p>and I just don&rsquo;t think it works anymore and I think a lot</p>
<p>of people will say I believe in the high order of deals of</p>
<p>racial and social justice, but I don&rsquo;t believe in the mechanism</p>
<p>of action.</p>
<p>And so the pendulum swung too far, but but but but the core</p>
<p>intent of a generation of change is underway, which is social</p>
<p>justice and climate change.</p>
<p>I think those are the two big points of concern be done with</p>
<p>this cohort under this will it will be done to this extreme</p>
<p>this fast, right?</p>
<p>And and I think that the pendulum went too fast too far and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s and there are boundary effects that are causing recourse</p>
<p>right now and we&rsquo;re seeing this across the country, especially</p>
<p>in New York with the election of the mayor and San Francisco</p>
<p>that the da recalls happening in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>So sacks, what&rsquo;s your prediction on the da recall by the way?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s 95% but I mean it just to build on your point.</p>
<p>They were talking about 10% of the people in the United States</p>
<p>who are involved in this, you know, retweeting and virtual</p>
<p>signaling and you know, is Twitter a real place?</p>
<p>Well, no, a city&rsquo;s a real place people have to live in San</p>
<p>Francisco.</p>
<p>And when these ideologies result in unlivable conditions for</p>
<p>people, well, they&rsquo;re going to say, you know what, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>reality here.</p>
<p>How do we get competent people to take the positions sacks that</p>
<p>are being vacated now who should London breed put in these</p>
<p>three positions and maybe tech people need to I mean, this is</p>
<p>what I think has to happen.</p>
<p>I think some number of tech people have to get off the bench</p>
<p>and say, you know what, I&rsquo;m going to do a tour of duty as</p>
<p>politicians in San Francisco to take back the city.</p>
<p>What should happen here in terms of who takes these positions</p>
<p>because Republicans can&rsquo;t win in San Francisco.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to need moderate Democrats, right?</p>
<p>Sacks before sacks goes, can I just say something?</p>
<p>Because I think I just want to say something that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>important sacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to jump in.</p>
<p>But Jake, how I think the point you&rsquo;re making about the tech</p>
<p>people implies the tech people are effective and good at doing</p>
<p>this, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily the fabric of San Francisco.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in San Francisco since 2001.</p>
<p>The number of people in San Francisco in 2001 that were in</p>
<p>the tech industry was a minority.</p>
<p>Since that time it became a significant size and over the</p>
<p>last two years since the pandemic it&rsquo;s decreased significantly.</p>
<p>But San Francisco is a city with decades and generations of</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s family is multi-generational San Franciscans.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that traditionally San Franciscans view</p>
<p>tech people as the right people to solve these problems for</p>
<p>them that the intention of that city is not necessarily about</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get tech people to solve our problems.</p>
<p>They have a different set of values perhaps.</p>
<p>And so we often overstate and assume that tech people are the</p>
<p>right people and are this the problem solvers, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s necessarily the right problems that people</p>
<p>want to solve.</p>
<p>So I just I just wanted to intervene and take these positions</p>
<p>because right, it&rsquo;s really far left people are motivated to</p>
<p>take these positions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see business people writ large across all political,</p>
<p>you know positions, but specifically San Francisco don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to take these positions.</p>
<p>So is this just going to be replayed sex?</p>
<p>The recall effort was led by two parents autumn illusion and</p>
<p>Siva Raj.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who led this thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who rose up to basically oppose these crazy</p>
<p>school board members.</p>
<p>And that is who London breach to talk to.</p>
<p>I mean, she needs to go talk to the people who are successful</p>
<p>in organizing this recall because they understand the issues</p>
<p>obviously and the people are with them.</p>
<p>So either appoint them to the board or ask them for their</p>
<p>recommendations.</p>
<p>And I think what you see consistently, whether it&rsquo;s with</p>
<p>this SF school board or the school boards that we saw in</p>
<p>Virginia, the young can very effectively ran against is that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t believe the parents matter.</p>
<p>Terry McAuliffe fatal that his last gap was basically saying</p>
<p>that the parents shouldn&rsquo;t get to decide what is taught in</p>
<p>the schools.</p>
<p>He basically said the quiet part out loud, but that is what</p>
<p>still across the country.</p>
<p>The teachers unions believe and most of Democratic Party,</p>
<p>the activists believe and until they start losing elections,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to see a change in that belief.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>How awesome would it be exactor on the school board?</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just to put a pin in this and the cherry on top,</p>
<p>the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted seven to four</p>
<p>to send a recall reform bill.</p>
<p>So their reaction to all of this is to do a recall of recalls</p>
<p>and say now you can&rsquo;t recall somebody in their first year</p>
<p>and the people who are placed in these positions can&rsquo;t run</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>So now the speculation is that three people who got voted off</p>
<p>are going to run again.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot more to come on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also part so they&rsquo;re putting this to staff that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re putting that on the ballot on June 7th, the same</p>
<p>day that we vote on the recall of Jason Boudin, the Board</p>
<p>of Supervisors now put in this measure that would make it</p>
<p>far harder to recall people.</p>
<p>One of the provisions of that is whoever London Breed appoints</p>
<p>as the successor, like you&rsquo;re talking about, they cannot run</p>
<p>after that.</p>
<p>So it is designed to for no that makes no sense.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically what they do a great job, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>So you have the Board of Supervisors trying to throw a wrench</p>
<p>into the democratic process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, these are people who claim to be preserving democracy</p>
<p>saving democracy.</p>
<p>They are trying to throw a wrench in the thing is underlying</p>
<p>it David is they think they know better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it fundamentally comes down to.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re willing to have democracy up to a point and when</p>
<p>that point is an unacceptable view by somebody else, they</p>
<p>feel like they know better and they&rsquo;re willing to be really</p>
<p>draconian in whatever they do to decide.</p>
<p>Yeah, and shout out to Mike Bloomberg.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pull up the the tweet for everybody.</p>
<p>He hasn&rsquo;t been very vocal or been on the stage much but</p>
<p>obviously did a great job in New York on reforming schools.</p>
<p>The San Francisco School Board recall should be a wake-up</p>
<p>call to elected officials, especially Democrats across the</p>
<p>nation.</p>
<p>Parents are fed up with the status quo and I put adults that</p>
<p>puts adults ahead of kids.</p>
<p>Yeah, well ideology ahead of results.</p>
<p>Well said Mike.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well said Mr.</p>
<p>Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Yes, that was very good.</p>
<p>And Bloomberg has been very good on calling out the Democrat</p>
<p>their Democratic Party&rsquo;s blind loyalty to the teachers unions</p>
<p>and until they&rsquo;re willing to break with the teachers unions</p>
<p>who are their biggest donor.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to get any real progress on school reform.</p>
<p>And this is the issue of my favorite political commentator.</p>
<p>One of them is Roy Tashara, who&rsquo;s a Democrat.</p>
<p>He wrote the emerging Democrat majority.</p>
<p>He wrote a blog post talking about how the Asian American</p>
<p>voters are going to swing away from the Democratic Party</p>
<p>because of issues like this because of the decline of</p>
<p>standards in school and safety and and and the Asian American</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p>I think is galvanized on this Jason Boudin issue because they</p>
<p>have seen in all these cases of Asian hate where elders in</p>
<p>their community have been violently assaulted.</p>
<p>Jason Boudin has done nothing except release the perpetrators</p>
<p>occurs.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, listen, this is seems like a good turning point.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s we talked about on this podcast over and over again</p>
<p>about the compression in SAS multiples in the public market</p>
<p>valuations, something that we&rsquo;re still working through in the</p>
<p>stock market, which has been choppy at best over the last</p>
<p>couple of months.</p>
<p>An information story came out just this week, major crossover</p>
<p>funds like tiger and D one are slowing down their investments</p>
<p>in late stage private companies.</p>
<p>And I was talking to some folks who said the multiple compression</p>
<p>is here now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not doing the deals at 75 or 100 x revenue.</p>
<p>This is reported in an article by the information tiger global</p>
<p>told their LPS in a webinar earlier this month that it would</p>
<p>no longer focus on backing late stage startups preparing to go</p>
<p>public instead, they will focus on two things going even earlier</p>
<p>into series A and series B rounds and buying shares of public</p>
<p>tech companies that have sunk in value compared to the all time</p>
<p>highs. Obviously, we know twillow zoom block, all down over</p>
<p>60% from their one year highs, I could get into more details</p>
<p>here. But let&rsquo;s stop for a second. And Chamath, what are</p>
<p>your thoughts in the dot com bubble?</p>
<p>It took somewhere between three to five years for most stocks</p>
<p>to bottom. And they bottomed, I think, peak to trough somewhere,</p>
<p>you know, towards 80% of where they were in 2000. Right. So it</p>
<p>took three to five years to go basically minus 80%. We did</p>
<p>that in three months, you know, maybe four months. And so the</p>
<p>markets have become a lot more efficient over time. So now that</p>
<p>we have that reset, it&rsquo;s pretty natural that there&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be a very quick reset on the private market side. And you</p>
<p>know, you have to go where the bodies are buried. And what I</p>
<p>mean by that, in this case is that overwhelming misvaluation</p>
<p>of late stage private companies. And so these folks don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>much of a choice, they have a lot of money that they&rsquo;ve raised.</p>
<p>Before all of this happened, they have a huge portfolio of</p>
<p>stuff that they&rsquo;ve marked up or have been marked up by others.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t want to go through the pain now resetting.</p>
<p>So part of the easy strategic decision there is to say, you</p>
<p>know what, we know this is a little bit radioactive. But</p>
<p>instead of really figuring out what the mark on these companies</p>
<p>are, we&rsquo;ll go to a different sort of part of the playground</p>
<p>and play there. Because we don&rsquo;t have to go and deal with these</p>
<p>issues. And, you know, we can do 10, 15 $20 million checks</p>
<p>into early stage businesses, pretty normal reaction strategically.</p>
<p>But I think the reality is that at some point in the next year</p>
<p>or two, these other companies have to get public, the hope</p>
<p>is that the market catches back up so that you can defend</p>
<p>the last valuation. And that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the way that this</p>
<p>stuff doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of pain. The problem is, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>high burn, and you are counting on yet another successive round,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re at a point in your life cycle where you need to go</p>
<p>public. In the next two years, if you go public, you will get</p>
<p>taken to the woodshed.</p>
<p>Take the woodshed being your valuation might be half of what</p>
<p>it is in your last round. So there&rsquo;s going to be medicine</p>
<p>that has to be taken sacks, there&rsquo;ll be medicine, some people</p>
<p>are gonna have to take some medicine sacks, what&rsquo;s your best</p>
<p>advice being one of the great operators in the history of</p>
<p>Silicon Valley as a CEO of PayPal?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m up there with share. I mean, I think this, I think</p>
<p>everybody agreed the top four people can correct me here. Tim</p>
<p>was a good operator.</p>
<p>I mean, I saw what you did to ICQ, man, you were riding that</p>
<p>that bad boy down. That wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I delivered a billion fucking users to a company. Okay, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty decent.</p>
<p>You did pretty good at Facebook. I&rsquo;ll say that. But if I would</p>
<p>think most people would say sacks, Cheryl, Tim Cook, Keith</p>
<p>Roy, boy, we&rsquo;ll put that aside for the debate in terms of</p>
<p>operating a little dark, spicy barbecue pork here. Come on,</p>
<p>give me I&rsquo;ll put you in the top 25. Sure. Okay. But I mean, it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t your wasn&rsquo;t your chosen career. A little dark meat.</p>
<p>Nice. Please don&rsquo;t get me in trouble. Bring me into your dark</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>Wait, J Cal, who are your top four? Cheryl?</p>
<p>I put my top four in this order. I&rsquo;ll give it an order.</p>
<p>So basically, for white people when</p>
<p>basically, Asian and Indian CEOs run most of the tech companies</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking about number two, CEOs, not CEOs. Just for</p>
<p>the CEO position. To be clear, I&rsquo;m not talking CEO, I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>to COO. I would say Tim Cook, when he was Steve Jobs, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my number one operator last 20 30 years. Number two, I put</p>
<p>Cheryl Sandberg, who did obviously amazing things for</p>
<p>Google, and then Facebook, right? Those two would be my top</p>
<p>two. And then I tie my top two sacks as a PayPal and Zenefits</p>
<p>even though it didn&rsquo;t work out. It was still a great run at the</p>
<p>time. And then I put Keith or a boy square and a couple of other</p>
<p>companies he did. Those are my top four. Anybody else want to</p>
<p>come at me? Go ahead. I don&rsquo;t have complete data set on CEOs.</p>
<p>But where would you put sex? You did I put your mind to disagree?</p>
<p>Who might disagree?</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Keith at LinkedIn?</p>
<p>Really? You are J. Cal lately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a love fest now. Yeah. Okay. There we go. There we go.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re back together.</p>
<p>You and Friedberg are at each other&rsquo;s throats. So I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>let you guys fight it out. And I&rsquo;ll be all about the love. Yeah,</p>
<p>Friedberg. Why are you attacking J. Cal? Yeah, Friedberg.</p>
<p>Be quiet over there. No one&rsquo;s asking you. Stay in your lane,</p>
<p>Friedberg. So sacks as an operator extraordinaire. What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your best advice to the company that raised 100 million? And</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say their valuation is now not a billion. It&rsquo;s 500 million.</p>
<p>What are the steps you take? You got 14 months of runway in the</p>
<p>bank? Do you lay people off? Do you extend it to 24? What are</p>
<p>your thoughts? Okay, you must be dealing with this with companies</p>
<p>in your portfolio.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a few things going on. First of all, I think Tiger</p>
<p>built a great business and providing late stage sort of</p>
<p>passive non dilutive capital to companies, SAS companies, we</p>
<p>have a bunch of SAS businesses that they provided later stage</p>
<p>financing. I think those valuations are going to come</p>
<p>down. I don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re going to be such a great partner</p>
<p>for series a firms because they are passive. And, you know, we</p>
<p>see is that series a companies need a lot of help. They need a</p>
<p>lot of advice, you need a lot of help with recruiting,</p>
<p>governance, governance, they need, you know, when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>growing from, say, 20 employees to 100, they need to know what</p>
<p>that org chart looks like, and on and on and on. So I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that if this report, I don&rsquo;t know if this reporting is</p>
<p>actually true. But if the goal is all of a sudden for Tiger to</p>
<p>become a series a investor that competes with craft or Sequoia</p>
<p>or these other firms that are not very hands on, does it that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem like a great strategy to me. I do think that</p>
<p>for our later stage companies, they have to realize that, you</p>
<p>know, if they raise the other side of this, sorry, David, I</p>
<p>just want your reaction to this. I think it&rsquo;s going to work, but</p>
<p>not for the right reasons. The reason it&rsquo;ll work is there are</p>
<p>way more entrepreneurs now than there are great entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>And so of all of these entrepreneurs that exist, the</p>
<p>idea of getting passive money, where you won&rsquo;t get fired, where</p>
<p>there is that remember, like, remember, when we were growing</p>
<p>up in Silicon Valley, the risk is always like if you take</p>
<p>Sequoia benchmark, you know, social cap, like there&rsquo;s a high</p>
<p>bar for that capital, which means we are helping you run</p>
<p>this business effectively. And there&rsquo;s a cost where if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t perform, you will get fired. There&rsquo;s always been that</p>
<p>risk. It&rsquo;s true. And I guess that&rsquo;s the argument they could</p>
<p>make. But the flip side is that there&rsquo;s a lot of these. So the</p>
<p>CEO now, why would you take a $15 million Series A check from</p>
<p>Sequoia where they could fire you? Where&rsquo;s $15 million from</p>
<p>Tiger, they&rsquo;ll may never call you. We address that by doing</p>
<p>look, if a founder is really worried about that, we address</p>
<p>that by giving them three board seats, you know, we might have</p>
<p>one, they might have three. I mean, my view on it is you just</p>
<p>never fire a founder unless he does something criminal. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just that simple. But so look, I think there&rsquo;s ways of</p>
<p>addressing the governance where you can get the help or the</p>
<p>value out of an early stage firm without giving up the control.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, look, that&rsquo;s the pitch that Tiger would make,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s addressable.</p>
<p>What do you think of that pitch freeberg? We&rsquo;ll give you the</p>
<p>$15 million Series A, you don&rsquo;t have to have a board, you can</p>
<p>just be passive and let us know how it goes. Give us a quarterly</p>
<p>report. We&rsquo;ll look at the p&amp;l.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all of crypto now. Anyways, that&rsquo;s true. Well, I</p>
<p>mean, that&rsquo;s a fair point. No governance in crypto is leading</p>
<p>to a lot of weird stuff. I can tell you, I tell people this a</p>
<p>lot. So I had three term sheets for my Series B. It was from</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz, coastal ventures and founders fund and</p>
<p>founders fund came in kind of last minute. But I went with</p>
<p>coastal, even though it&rsquo;s a lower valuation, because the</p>
<p>node was pretty insistent, like, let me put someone that could</p>
<p>be useful some, you know, government person, because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing a lot of work lobbying in DC, on your board, we won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>on your board, we won&rsquo;t bother you. And I took the round. And</p>
<p>then my Series C, I took from founders fund, because Brian</p>
<p>Singerman, who&rsquo;s obviously a good friend, you know, made the</p>
<p>case like, look, our model of founders fund is we let founders</p>
<p>run the business, we&rsquo;re not here to tell you how to run your</p>
<p>business. And they were both great fits. And you know, it</p>
<p>worked out. Well, I didn&rsquo;t, I had, I have had experience with</p>
<p>antagonistic VCs on boards. And, you know, generally creates a</p>
<p>pretty negative dynamic. Now, when I was the worst story,</p>
<p>without the person&rsquo;s name, I don&rsquo;t think I want to go public</p>
<p>with it. So I&rsquo;m not going to do that. But when I was on, give us</p>
<p>an idea of what the behavior would be, because there are</p>
<p>people in the audience who want to know what is bad behavior of</p>
<p>VC, just give us a composite. When you&rsquo;re an entrepreneur, or</p>
<p>a CEO running an early stage business, you live that business</p>
<p>20 hours a day, you know, the details, if you&rsquo;re smart, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thorough, you&rsquo;re analytical, you&rsquo;re creative, there is no one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to come in the boardroom for two hours a</p>
<p>quarter, and suggest things to you that you haven&rsquo;t thought of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no one that&rsquo;s going to come in the room and be smarter</p>
<p>than you at your own business. And so more often than not,</p>
<p>Vinod&rsquo;s been exceptional at defining this problem. The problem</p>
<p>is VCs join a board, and they think that they have to quote</p>
<p>add value. So they come in, and they make a bunch of suggestions</p>
<p>and recommendations and push you to do a bunch of things. And</p>
<p>as Vinod has said correctly, many times, they more often than</p>
<p>not add negative value, they can actually destroy and damage</p>
<p>a business, because they need to feel like they&rsquo;re exerting</p>
<p>some degree of influence over the business. And as a result,</p>
<p>they push the business to do things that the CEO or founder</p>
<p>otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be doing. And that often ends up in a kind</p>
<p>of weird sticky kind of place. So I just validated the tiger</p>
<p>pitch right there. I think that&rsquo;s right. And by the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s why founders fund founders fund is fantastic. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you guys are LPS, but their investment returns are so far</p>
<p>beyond what I think anyone really realizes they&rsquo;re incredible</p>
<p>investors. And a big part of it is they try and find the</p>
<p>entrepreneur that doesn&rsquo;t want and doesn&rsquo;t need the help. And</p>
<p>then they give them the capital to go and execute and they leave</p>
<p>them the heck alone. And they are just so good at finding those</p>
<p>folks, identifying them and then literally being passive in</p>
<p>how they kind of manage and operate their business. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they were so freaking good.</p>
<p>I think the people you&rsquo;re talking about are a lot of rookie</p>
<p>VCs who come in and then yeah, they think they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>experienced x operators, even people who ran businesses who</p>
<p>say I know how to run a business and look, no two businesses are</p>
<p>alike. So maybe the way they ran their business with their team</p>
<p>and their market and their industry worked well for them.</p>
<p>But now when they got to come in and do it with someone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>business in some other space, with some completely different</p>
<p>team, you know, they try and exert influence. And really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, you know, not want it.</p>
<p>Let me go to sack sacks. Hold on, I want to just get one from</p>
<p>you. Give us an idea because you&rsquo;ve been in the business for</p>
<p>over 20 years. I mean, by the looks of it, maybe 40, but 20</p>
<p>years, just crushing it in the business. What&rsquo;s the worst</p>
<p>behavior you&rsquo;ve seen on a board? You can make a composite of</p>
<p>like a VC being destructive on a board.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I think sometimes VCs will have sort of</p>
<p>hobby horses and they&rsquo;ll keep pushing for things that the</p>
<p>founder doesn&rsquo;t want. That&rsquo;s not productive. But what I would</p>
<p>say is, first of all, let me just say like, I&rsquo;m not somebody</p>
<p>who likes to take board seats. And I, I do it as it&rsquo;s like I</p>
<p>see it as a cost, not a benefit to me, because it takes up my</p>
<p>time. If I didn&rsquo;t have to ever take a board seat, that&rsquo;d be a</p>
<p>great as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, that&rsquo;d be a good thing. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>somebody who wants to, you know, insert myself and get on these</p>
<p>boards, you know,</p>
<p>offered as an incentive. No,</p>
<p>I only only took a board seals. Yeah, the only reason I&rsquo;ll ever</p>
<p>take a board seat is because I have to do it because the</p>
<p>founder insists that otherwise they won&rsquo;t go with I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>it with them. So exactly. So you&rsquo;ll do it for one year,</p>
<p>right? You&rsquo;ll say, Hey, I&rsquo;ll do it for a year.</p>
<p>I always time limited now because I just can&rsquo;t. I mean, I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t make a 10 year obligation. You know, it&rsquo;s typically like</p>
<p>one or two years and then you know, we&rsquo;ll see doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll roll off in two years, but but I but I need to have the</p>
<p>expectation set up and and the reality is if the company can</p>
<p>perform well for another two years, they&rsquo;ll be at a different</p>
<p>stage. And maybe they won&rsquo;t, you know, need my help as much. So</p>
<p>tomorrow, the two most valuable pieces of private equity that</p>
<p>I own is a company called DCG. And it&rsquo;s a company called</p>
<p>Netscope. And collectively, it&rsquo;s like a billion dollars worth</p>
<p>of stock that I own what I&rsquo;m on the board of one. I&rsquo;m not on</p>
<p>the board of the other anymore. And I text with these guys</p>
<p>maybe once every two or three months at best. So, you know,</p>
<p>completely confirming David your point that great founders are</p>
<p>just end of one individuals, you know, Barry Silbert, Sanjay</p>
<p>Berry, next level guys. But that&rsquo;s very different than the</p>
<p>the series a playbook because when I ran institutional money,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you there is a pressure to be involved and show</p>
<p>some value. And I do think that there is a level of judgment</p>
<p>on the CEO that has happened. Now, maybe that&rsquo;s changed</p>
<p>historically. But I think that&rsquo;s the single biggest pivot that</p>
<p>one would exploit. If you were tiger or code two or D one</p>
<p>stepping into the early stage game, which is to essentially</p>
<p>make it a feature and it&rsquo;s not dissimilar to when DST and Yuri</p>
<p>Milner entered the late stage round. You know, what was his</p>
<p>big differentiation? I&rsquo;ll take common stock and I won&rsquo;t take a</p>
<p>board seat. I do not need a board seat to be influential. It</p>
<p>seems so counterintuitive and so against the grain, but he</p>
<p>acknowledged what was this thing that up until that point was</p>
<p>true, which is common and preferred converged in price per</p>
<p>share. So buying common in a late stage company was the same</p>
<p>as buying preferred.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s something you should explain a chamath for a</p>
<p>second people don&rsquo;t know this, but at an IPO,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s start with it. So when you set up a company, you</p>
<p>have a price per share of the common stock and then a price</p>
<p>per share that the series a investor has. The series a</p>
<p>investor is buying preferred shares that actually looks more</p>
<p>like debt than equity. And what I mean by that is there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>typically a coupon. There&rsquo;s a rate of return. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>accumulated dividends. All these features give it a certain</p>
<p>price per share and the common has none of those features. And</p>
<p>so it has a low protective provisions and that gap is</p>
<p>typically around 20 to one when you set up a company. Okay, and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what allows you to hire employees and give them very</p>
<p>very cheap options with embedded upside. Then what happens</p>
<p>is you raise more and more of these series B series C series</p>
<p>D these preference stack, right? Preferred shares build up,</p>
<p>but the value of the common keeps rising too. And by the</p>
<p>time you go public, the gap converges. What Yuri realized</p>
<p>was, hey, wait a minute. I&rsquo;m buying a company a year or 18</p>
<p>months before it goes public. The price of the common and the</p>
<p>price of the preferred are roughly the same. And so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just going to, you know, do that and I&rsquo;m not going to take a</p>
<p>board seat because it&rsquo;s clear this company is successful. So</p>
<p>similarly, for Tiger D one and code two, I would just observe</p>
<p>the obvious and kind of put everything that we&rsquo;ve just said</p>
<p>on the table, which is, hey, guys, I&rsquo;ll give you the money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either end of one or not. I&rsquo;m making a guess that you are</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just going to get out of your way and leave you alone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bundling governance and unbundling the governance and</p>
<p>advice piece from the capital piece, but you&rsquo;re gonna still</p>
<p>need that governance and advice piece. I think it could work.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of great founders or their</p>
<p>founders who start young and experience become great. And the</p>
<p>smart ones listen to advice on the way and they seek out people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve done it before. And so, you know, yes, they may be an end</p>
<p>of one business by the growth stage. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t need any help whatsoever at the Series A</p>
<p>stage. Such a good observation. Yeah. And look, I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been I think there&rsquo;s been an evolution Silicon Valley, I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>actually say there&rsquo;s been like three distinct phases in the</p>
<p>venture capital world. And I remember all of them. So you go</p>
<p>back to the the night the late 90s. Okay. When you had this</p>
<p>mentality on the part of VCs, that if a company became</p>
<p>successful, you would just automatically replace the</p>
<p>founders, right? You go bring in a professional CEO upgrade,</p>
<p>that was a disaster. Okay. And, and that&rsquo;s when founders fund</p>
<p>Peter came in, I think founded founders fund in 2003. And the</p>
<p>reason they called it founders fund is to indicate they were</p>
<p>gonna be pro founder, and they would never replace the founder.</p>
<p>And they would let you do whatever you wanted. And I think</p>
<p>you want to tell the backstory of the Sean Parker stuff and how</p>
<p>that happened. Yeah, I mean, so basically, both Peter and Sean</p>
<p>Parker had, you know, experiences, they felt were very</p>
<p>negative with Sequoia. And by the way, I have great relations</p>
<p>with Sequoia, Roloff, who worked with us at PayPal is there. And</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve evolved as a firm. So I&rsquo;m not calling them</p>
<p>out or anything. But, but both Sean Parker and Peter felt like</p>
<p>Sequoia pushed to have them replaced. And so with Plaxo,</p>
<p>specifically, there are a couple of different companies involved.</p>
<p>But when Peter was CEO of PayPal, as well, that, you know, he</p>
<p>felt he felt that pressure as well. So when they then founded</p>
<p>as two of the four founding partners of founders from back</p>
<p>in 2003, the whole point was, we are going to be pro founder,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna replace you will let you do whatever you</p>
<p>want. I think that was that was phase two. And that became I</p>
<p>think, the dominant model. And so becoming pro founder was now</p>
<p>table stakes. And I think the third phase has been, you know,</p>
<p>what Andreessen Horowitz has now done with this massive, like</p>
<p>the services and the value add, which is that we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>basically not only be pro founder, but we&rsquo;re going to like</p>
<p>bring all these resources to help you. And that&rsquo;s the era</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in right now. I mean, from the, from our perspective, like</p>
<p>as as craft, I mean, look, it&rsquo;s not in our interest to get into</p>
<p>any dispute with a founder. And if we feel like our advice isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>being taken, well, we just back off. You know, of course, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pro founder, like we don&rsquo;t want the control. We&rsquo;re not control</p>
<p>investors. And, you know, if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s becoming</p>
<p>frictional, we&rsquo;d rather just get out of the way.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just not worth it. The underlying thing that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>saying, though, it&rsquo;s because you have enough of a fund that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>large enough where you can have enough bets where any of these</p>
<p>any of these things to the upside is a total needle mover.</p>
<p>But anything that goes to zero doesn&rsquo;t actually diminish the</p>
<p>fund or impair it meaningfully. So there is no upside to getting</p>
<p>engaged and really being non anti founder. So yeah, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a I think it&rsquo;s a part of a business model. But one thing I</p>
<p>want to tell you about Parker, Parker was single handedly</p>
<p>incredibly responsible for keeping Zuck in the seat when he</p>
<p>was president of Facebook, as Parker wrote, you know, the</p>
<p>structure that really allowed Mark to keep control super</p>
<p>voting shares,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s active to add on to your your point, I think that there</p>
<p>has been. So there seems to be a bifurcation around the services</p>
<p>model or not. But the fourth thing that seems to have</p>
<p>happened, and you guys tell me if I&rsquo;m wrong on this, but it</p>
<p>plays into the tiger global story. When I was, when I got</p>
<p>that term sheet for my series B, at Climate Corp, Mark Andreessen,</p>
<p>I was trying to raise like 25 to $30 million. And Mark Andreessen</p>
<p>was like, we&rsquo;re gonna give you a term sheet for $40 million more</p>
<p>than you were asking for. Because we want you to use that</p>
<p>extra capital to go faster to go harder to grab the market</p>
<p>because we have this big pitch in business is grabbing the</p>
<p>market. And that seems to have also become a bit of a mainstay</p>
<p>but not just a mainstay, but now almost like the kind of standard</p>
<p>pitch that a lot of the later stage guys are taking, which is</p>
<p>like, here&rsquo;s so much capital that it helps you make the</p>
<p>market. And then the SoftBank Vision Fund kind of took that</p>
<p>to the extreme with $100 billion raise and Tiger Global, I think</p>
<p>last year, have publicly said they deployed about $15 billion</p>
<p>into startups, where a startup may in a natural cycle kind of</p>
<p>evolved to needing $70 million raise or $100 million raise. And</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like writing checks for 250 or 300. And saying this</p>
<p>extra capital gives you the ability to move faster. And the</p>
<p>reason is, the faster a business moves, the higher the multiple</p>
<p>they get on their revenue. So the higher the growth rate, the</p>
<p>higher the multiple. So if you can deploy capital faster, if we</p>
<p>can find a business where we can pump money through you to get it</p>
<p>out the door faster, your multiple goes up and Tigers</p>
<p>model was let&rsquo;s just get the multiples up. There&rsquo;s multiple</p>
<p>expansion and growth. So we&rsquo;ll make money two ways when the</p>
<p>company goes public in 18 to 24 months. Obviously, when the</p>
<p>markets end up tanking and all those multiples compress, no</p>
<p>growth rate is going to solve that problem for you. But having</p>
<p>more capital than maybe you were thinking or asking for also</p>
<p>seems to have become kind of attacking. I don&rsquo;t know if that</p>
<p>if you view that as kind of this fourth evolution, but that</p>
<p>certainly wasn&rsquo;t the case 20 years ago, when VCs were being</p>
<p>careful about is it a $6 million round or an $8 million round,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right amount of capital. And nowadays, it&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>more about take more than you need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say there was a 3.5 in there, which is, you saw a</p>
<p>little bit of lack of governance or superpowers on the part of</p>
<p>like some incompetent founders or bad founders. Just you know,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s we were Theranos, whatever, too much control, not</p>
<p>enough governance, things go off the rail. But, you know,</p>
<p>based on this discussion, I really think this bifurcates</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s a first time founder versus a second time founder in</p>
<p>what I see, because I have been doing board training for seed</p>
<p>companies where I will just have three founders sit in on each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s first board meetings, we do one board meeting each, and</p>
<p>I train them how board meetings works in what I experienced with</p>
<p>Sequoia on my board and other boards. And first time founders</p>
<p>like the tactical stuff, how to run a board meeting legal HR</p>
<p>hiring partnerships, go to market strategies, man, it is</p>
<p>all tactical all the time. And then when I&rsquo;ve been on with</p>
<p>second and third time founders, you know, they really are like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s all the materials, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking about, what do</p>
<p>we think strategically, so they go from the tactical level to</p>
<p>the strategic and mission level awfully quick. And they actually</p>
<p>seem to enjoy having those four meetings a year. Whereas the</p>
<p>first time founders really need to have six to 10 a year in</p>
<p>those in that first, you know, call it year two of a company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my experience.</p>
<p>I realized in this discussion, that the market has really</p>
<p>meaningfully changed, meaning when I was actively investing,</p>
<p>even in the early 2000s, or sorry, in the in the, you know,</p>
<p>2011 1213. There was a culture where if you underperformed, you</p>
<p>would get replaced. And I think David, what you just spoke about</p>
<p>which, I guess is true, has really changed, which is if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running a multi multi billion dollar fund, where every</p>
<p>check is $20 million, the upside is billions, but the</p>
<p>downside is negative 20. There&rsquo;s just no point. And so</p>
<p>you know, Sequoia used to be known as a very, very, very</p>
<p>tough, tough, tough place for CEOs that were underperforming.</p>
<p>Now they got a $9 billion fund. Now you have maybe 20 years</p>
<p>ago, it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. Not No, not even even 10, less</p>
<p>than 10 years ago. I think it was, I think it was known as a</p>
<p>very tough demanding place. I think benchmark was known as a</p>
<p>very tough demanding place because the money was much more</p>
<p>finite, right benchmark still don&rsquo;t still that case.</p>
<p>Expectation culture, they never they never grew their fund size.</p>
<p>No, Jason, you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not hearing me. I am. I think what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening is, listen, I had Sequoia on my board, and I</p>
<p>worked at Sequoia. So there&rsquo;s a difference between high</p>
<p>expectations, which I think all these folks have to have and the</p>
<p>willingness to replace the founder as CEO. And what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is every VC claims this, but there were a handful of VCs</p>
<p>that had the courage to do this. I mean, famously, Mike Morrison,</p>
<p>john door, you know, had it out with Larry at the you know,</p>
<p>right, right after this round, like either go public, you know,</p>
<p>get your business model or give us your money back famously at</p>
<p>Google. So they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re willing to draw a line in the</p>
<p>sand. I think that that has fundamentally changed at all</p>
<p>these organizations, because the fund sizes have gone up. And the</p>
<p>and the mathematical reality of venture capital has changed</p>
<p>something else you&rsquo;re missing, which is you got to remember</p>
<p>Moritz and door, we&rsquo;re not operators. And now these</p>
<p>companies are being run rule off is running Sequoia. And he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an operator and he was there. So the changing of the guard and</p>
<p>Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz were operators. So the operator</p>
<p>class behaves very differently. I disagree with you. I think</p>
<p>that fun respectfully just takes No, hold on. I think that fun</p>
<p>size dictates his behavior more than any singular other feature.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re running a $9 billion fund, you just don&rsquo;t sweat that</p>
<p>changing of the CEO. And David said it really well. You just</p>
<p>say, Okay, I&rsquo;ll cut our losses and move on. We don&rsquo;t lose. I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s more about the culture change in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>of a bunch of MBA finance people who have never run a company now</p>
<p>moving and running companies. But you know, let&rsquo;s move on to</p>
<p>the next any closing thoughts on this one?</p>
<p>Well, just I mean, Jason, you start to make this point that if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a founder, and you want to eventually run a great public</p>
<p>company, when you IPO, guess what, you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>governments. And what I&rsquo;ve seen big time, right? I mean, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just Delaware law, there&rsquo;s just a lot of like expectations around</p>
<p>being a public company. And so if you don&rsquo;t have a board, you</p>
<p>know, and you&rsquo;re not constituting one until you go</p>
<p>public, there&rsquo;s going to be a massive amount of cleanup that</p>
<p>you have to do. I mean, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve seen. And so you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>end up scrambling to create a board, I think that a board</p>
<p>serves so many purposes early on of giving you advice and giving</p>
<p>you structure of providing support, help services, you can</p>
<p>still remain in control while getting those things. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just, I&rsquo;m just skeptical that like, if you form a company with</p>
<p>completely passive VCs, you don&rsquo;t even serve on a board,</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re gonna have to do a lot of cleanup later, I&rsquo;d say at</p>
<p>a minimum.</p>
<p>Totally. I think that that&rsquo;s true, too. Totally. I&rsquo;m not, by</p>
<p>the way, I&rsquo;m not saying I advocate this. But I just think</p>
<p>that the reality is that if these large late stage crossover</p>
<p>firms really step into the early stage, I think they could</p>
<p>really build a big book of business. I do think there are a</p>
<p>lot of founders who would love to just be given the money and</p>
<p>just to be left alone. I&rsquo;m not saying that they think they know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s better for them. But on the margin just to be able to</p>
<p>be left alone. Now, what has changed maybe those everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be very hands off just because all the fund sizes have</p>
<p>exploded. So at that point, then you know, what is the difference</p>
<p>between Sequoia and D one time will tell.</p>
<p>I just know that like when I see a founder doing something that</p>
<p>I think could risk the company going off the rails, I&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>so. And then, you know, if it keeps happening, and situation</p>
<p>gets worse, I&rsquo;ll say so again, I might mention the third time I</p>
<p>might not, at a certain point, I&rsquo;m just like, maybe after like</p>
<p>two times, I&rsquo;m just like, they don&rsquo;t want to listen to me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s their decision, their company, their</p>
<p>decision, they go off the rails, their problem, you know, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>move on to the next one. I mean, that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>Sometimes founders have to learn by doing it, like sometimes</p>
<p>their intent and you know what, they could be right and you</p>
<p>could be wrong too. So it&rsquo;s hard as a, as a it&rsquo;s hard as a</p>
<p>board member, you know, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m very judicious in giving</p>
<p>advice as a board member now, and I&rsquo;m on a bunch of boards and</p>
<p>do word training, because when the rule of was on my board, and</p>
<p>he still is, you know, he would ask great questions. And he</p>
<p>would be very thoughtful about Hey, have you thought about this?</p>
<p>Or when I got advice from Doug or Michael Moritz directly, you</p>
<p>know, Doug would say, Hey, well, can you share the two year plan</p>
<p>with me? And I&rsquo;d say, you know, we haven&rsquo;t built a plan. And he</p>
<p>said, Well, you know, Jason, you know, hope is not a plan. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>make a plan. And let&rsquo;s discuss, you know, the milestones along</p>
<p>here. And it was amazing to have that level of thoughtfulness</p>
<p>around totally vision as a founder.</p>
<p>I love I mean, as a founder, I love getting advice. And I think</p>
<p>you got to be really dumb not to seek it out. I mean, I when I</p>
<p>was a founder, I would even though I was sort of competing</p>
<p>with any off, I would meet with him and I would like get amazing</p>
<p>tidbits. Just recently, we did it wasn&rsquo;t like an official board</p>
<p>meeting because roll off isn&rsquo;t on our board, but he&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>investor in one of my incubations, Colin. And we just</p>
<p>did a meeting with him. And, and, and</p>
<p>gets it in every time. Not to be confused with all in, but no,</p>
<p>yeah, not to be confused. We have a trademark.</p>
<p>It was it was me and Axel, who&rsquo;s the co founder of Colin and, and</p>
<p>roll off. And we had like an amazing meeting where we got</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;d say amazing advice from raw, that like, focused us.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t know these things. But it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the weeds, sometimes you don&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>crystallize and focus on the most important thing. And I came</p>
<p>out of that meeting, feeling like, okay, roll off just</p>
<p>refocused us on the most important thing. And it was</p>
<p>immensely valuable. And you&rsquo;ve got to be like dumb not to seek</p>
<p>that out, no matter what stage you&rsquo;re at. Because I seek it out</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>Yeah. And think about this, David, you&rsquo;re in the thick of</p>
<p>things. He&rsquo;s on squares board, he&rsquo;s on other boards, he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>picture of the entire playing field. It&rsquo;s like somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the coach of 15 NBA teams. And you&rsquo;re like the coach of one,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s seeing things on other NBA teams that they&rsquo;re doing in</p>
<p>methodologies and best practices that you&rsquo;re just not going to</p>
<p>see. So I mean, again, and then if you look at the great</p>
<p>founders, TK used to come to me and say, Hey, you know, this is</p>
<p>the thing I&rsquo;m going to be doing at the next board meeting, or</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing, can we jam out? And he would just ask for a jam</p>
<p>session, he came up with that term, and three or four people</p>
<p>would get together and just jam and talk for five hours about</p>
<p>the product. It was awesome. All right, let&rsquo;s go on to David</p>
<p>Sachs, his favorite section of the show. Science with the</p>
<p>Sultan of Science himself. Oh, I thought you were gonna say his</p>
<p>favorite program. Oh, enough with that. Oh, we can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about that. That was exciting. You have to you if you are</p>
<p>engaged in the science segment, it&rsquo;s actually PG or in a fight.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s cover it. Here&rsquo;s the deal. If David Sachs</p>
<p>is engaged during the science portion of the class, we will</p>
<p>let him have his fight. As the as the teacher here, tell us a</p>
<p>little bit about stem cells. And this HIV story, I was gonna tell</p>
<p>sex that the earth is round. Okay, it&rsquo;s not flat. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care. Yeah. How does that affect Solana? So sorry, the story that</p>
<p>I think we wanted to, you guys wanted to cover today with the</p>
<p>HIV story, which incredible. Yeah, I suggested this topic. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested. Explain it to us. HIV is a retrovirus. Meaning</p>
<p>once you get infected, it doesn&rsquo;t go away. He doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s flipping through his politico notes to figure out</p>
<p>what did he miss saying that he was supposed to say today? He</p>
<p>just flipped over to Ben Shapiro. He&rsquo;s listening to</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris in conversation. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Okay, the HIV being cured headline, you know, we can dive</p>
<p>into it for two minutes. But HIV is a retrovirus. When you get</p>
<p>infected with HIV, it stays in your body forever. It actually</p>
<p>ends up living inside of your immune cells. That&rsquo;s what makes</p>
<p>it such an interesting, challenging virus. And it</p>
<p>destroys those immune cells. So over time, you end up getting</p>
<p>AIDS. And the way it enters the immune cells is through a</p>
<p>specific protein. Some people have a genetic mutation, where</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a change in the their DNA, and that protein is</p>
<p>different, HIV cannot enter their immune cells. And they can</p>
<p>actually they are naturally immune to HIV. CCR five. Yeah.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happened is found apparently in white, northern</p>
<p>Europeans. Yeah, like Norwegians, I think. Yeah,</p>
<p>exactly. And anyway, so what&rsquo;s the interesting study that was</p>
<p>done, all immune cells are made from stem cells in your bone</p>
<p>marrow. And so you know, all the white blood cells that we have</p>
<p>that fight off our diseases come from our bone marrow. And when</p>
<p>you get a blood cancer, sometimes you end up getting so</p>
<p>severe that you have to actually wipe out all the immune cells in</p>
<p>your body, and give yours and you end up with a bone marrow</p>
<p>transplant. So you get new bone marrow put in your blood cells</p>
<p>put in. And hopefully, if you can survive the therapy and</p>
<p>survive that treatment, those that new bone marrow will</p>
<p>produce new immune cells in your body will recover, and you will</p>
<p>be cured of your blood cancer. So what happened is people had</p>
<p>HIV. And when you get this, this bone marrow transplant, you end</p>
<p>up, you know, they give you radiation and chemo, and they</p>
<p>wipe out all your blood cells. And, and then they give you this</p>
<p>bone marrow transplant. So they selectively chose bone marrow</p>
<p>stem cells that came from people that have the genetic mutation</p>
<p>that that prevents HIV. So then when these HIV patients that got</p>
<p>blood cancer got a bone marrow transplant with this mutation in</p>
<p>it, they were cured of HIV. And so it&rsquo;s a pretty profound kind</p>
<p>of demonstration of what we already knew, which is that this</p>
<p>genetic mutation can can prevent HIV. And there are a lot of</p>
<p>therapies that are underway right now, to actually use gene</p>
<p>editing to induce that mutation in people&rsquo;s blood cells in their</p>
<p>bone marrow without needing to give them a whole transplant.</p>
<p>The first guy that did it, the first guy that did it was</p>
<p>German, right? Or he was in Germany, I think, and he</p>
<p>unfortunately passed away. They cured his his HIV AIDS, but he</p>
<p>unfortunately had a relapse of the leukemia that killed him. But</p>
<p>I think all three cases of people that that have been</p>
<p>quote unquote cured, have been these leukemia patients.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll say two things, two things about the future of this</p>
<p>kind of possibility. Number one is you don&rsquo;t need to get a bone</p>
<p>marrow transplant to have this mutation induced in your cells</p>
<p>to prevent this infection from kind of occurring in your body,</p>
<p>you can use gene editing tools to do that. And so we are now</p>
<p>developing gene editing therapies, where rather than go</p>
<p>and get a whole bone marrow transplant, to cure your HIV, we</p>
<p>can actually edit yourselves, those edited cells will now be</p>
<p>resistant, and you will be resolved of HIV. The second</p>
<p>thing is the way that they gave people the bone marrow</p>
<p>transplant, the way they created those stem cells for the</p>
<p>bone marrow transplant was from umbilical cord blood from from</p>
<p>newborns, which is very rich in stem cells. And this is a</p>
<p>traditional way of kind of giving people stem cell based</p>
<p>therapies is you go and source stem cells from another body, or</p>
<p>your own body, which are called autologous stem cells. But like,</p>
<p>I just want to say one thing, what&rsquo;s really interesting in the</p>
<p>future is not going to be about pulling other people&rsquo;s stem</p>
<p>cells into your body, and finding them from you know,</p>
<p>fetal blood or what have you, we now have the technology, which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about multiple times on the show called Yamanaka</p>
<p>factors, where theoretically, we can take your cells from your</p>
<p>own body, turn them into stem cells, grow them in a lab and</p>
<p>use that as the therapy that&rsquo;s called autologous stem cell</p>
<p>therapy. And rather than use stem cells, we&rsquo;re trying to find</p>
<p>them and sort, you know, figure them out where they are in your</p>
<p>body and pull them out, we can actually do stem cells from your</p>
<p>body. And that&rsquo;s like, you know, 15 years out is autologous</p>
<p>induced stem cell therapy, where you actually make your own stem</p>
<p>cells, and then give yourself all sorts of therapies, not just</p>
<p>bone marrow transplants, but you can heal lots of tissue in the</p>
<p>body using these stem cell systems.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really hear about HIV AIDS anymore. In that article, I</p>
<p>think it said that there was about 37 million people around</p>
<p>the world that have HIV AIDS. And it&rsquo;s incredible, actually,</p>
<p>the amount of progress that science has made in this</p>
<p>disease. I remember when I was growing up, it was made to be</p>
<p>like this incredible boogeyman. Yeah. And it really governed</p>
<p>like a lot of social norms at the time, because we were still</p>
<p>discovering what HIV AIDS was. And, you know, how, you know,</p>
<p>how do you think about sexual promiscuity, you know, from a</p>
<p>moral and ethical perspective? I think it had a huge impact on my</p>
<p>generation.</p>
<p>Absolutely. It did. It was a death sentence. They made us</p>
<p>paranoid.</p>
<p>So so here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened. therapies have gotten so good</p>
<p>at suppressing suppressing the virus. If the virus is</p>
<p>suppressed far enough, even though you are always going to</p>
<p>be infected, if it&rsquo;s suppressed far enough, the who and the FDA</p>
<p>have both said you can still have unprotected sex and not</p>
<p>transmit HIV. And so even though there are plenty of people out</p>
<p>there that might be having unprotected sex with HIV, the</p>
<p>therapies have suppressed the viral load to the point that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not transmitting it actively. And so that&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>big breakthrough in science over the last decade.</p>
<p>And then they also had these prep pills, right, which people</p>
<p>could take proactively if they thought they might, you know,</p>
<p>find themselves. But I mean, Chamath, you and I lived in a</p>
<p>generation where I mean, it was the end of things. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it was the end of days. And they&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, it was a single biggest thing that I was that I was</p>
<p>taught in sex ed classes to be afraid of, be really scared at</p>
<p>all costs. And then the problem that it that it created was like</p>
<p>a, you know, in countries that had a large Catholic population.</p>
<p>You know, the Catholic Church was so, you know, evil, they</p>
<p>had, they were undecided on. They were the opposite. They</p>
<p>told people in Africa to not use condoms. When AIDS was</p>
<p>rampant, it was the biggest evil, second biggest evil the</p>
<p>Catholic Church did in modern history. Obviously, the first we</p>
<p>know,</p>
<p>I have a contribution to the segment.</p>
<p>I know, I took this relationship. Look, I remember</p>
<p>how scared people were of AIDS, you know, back in the 1980s,</p>
<p>when this came up. And I remember that there was a head</p>
<p>of the NIH, who even whipped up people&rsquo;s fear, hold on people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fear, by saying that even casual even casual contact within the</p>
<p>same household can spread it. And you know,</p>
<p>yes, we know fact he dedicated his life to trying to solve and</p>
<p>reduce the suffering of solve for AIDS and HIV.</p>
<p>No, in the 1980s. In the 1980s, he was the face of government</p>
<p>difference towards AIDS. And he spread fear and was medically</p>
<p>wrong about it. Go check the records. He was a screw up on</p>
<p>it. He worked tirelessly and work tirelessly on it.</p>
<p>J. Cal, I think sacks is right in the sense that like what we</p>
<p>thought we knew back then turned out to be wrong. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really important point. You know, particularly in</p>
<p>science, it&rsquo;s a process of discovery. What we thought we</p>
<p>knew back then turned out it was all a hypothesis. It&rsquo;s all a</p>
<p>thesis until it&rsquo;s proven or disproven. And that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Read Andrew Sullivan. I mean, you know, Fauci was absolutely</p>
<p>the enemy public enemy number one of the of the gay movement.</p>
<p>Who is it? Tony? Tony? Yeah. Well, it was a Tony, Tony</p>
<p>Perkins. There was actually a debate that Fauci was in on AIDS</p>
<p>where a gay actress literally said to him, I hate you. And if</p>
<p>you read Andrew Sullivan&rsquo;s blog, he will talk about how he</p>
<p>remembers back in the 1980s, that Fauci was sort of public</p>
<p>enemy number one in the gay community, because of his</p>
<p>position on this during the Reagan administration. And so it</p>
<p>is a lot of civil disobedience, act up, etc. Remember, and he</p>
<p>responded by putting massive resources into this. So I think</p>
<p>you know, if he was that&rsquo;s not listening to Andrew Sullivan on</p>
<p>this, Andrew Sullivan, he is not that way. Wait, Andrew Sullivan</p>
<p>is the reason why more than any other public intellectual, why</p>
<p>we have marriage equality today. He is number one, he advocated</p>
<p>for marriage equality, and in the New Republic made the case</p>
<p>for it before anybody else and popularize that argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of his writing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not so don&rsquo;t try and portray him as a far right</p>
<p>winger, whatever.</p>
<p>Portray fouture, you&rsquo;re going to Fauci his intent. Anyway, to</p>
<p>believe that Fauci is an evil person.</p>
<p>I think you and many other people have mysteriously</p>
<p>forgotten who Fauci really is.</p>
<p>Okay, you think I know the conspiracy that you think</p>
<p>Fauci his intent is to, you know, cover up the</p>
<p>and he intentionally was working against solving for HIV.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Do you think Fauci had good intentions?</p>
<p>And if you inferred that sex, do you think Fauci had good</p>
<p>intentions?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t really care about his intentions. I just</p>
<p>want to look at his actions. It&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that a public official who was so wrong, back</p>
<p>then in the 1980s, 1990s, on the public health rights of our time</p>
<p>would just be given a free pass. And along comes a new public</p>
<p>health crisis last couple years. And he&rsquo;s been completely wrong</p>
<p>about that, too. So why are you giving this guy a free pass? I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Hey, sex in a cloud of uncertainty in a time of war. Do</p>
<p>you think that leaders need to show strong intent and clear</p>
<p>signals? Or do you think that they should be wishy washy</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t know enough?</p>
<p>I think they should just be right.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re trying the best with what they have with the</p>
<p>information they have at the time.</p>
<p>Okay, well, yeah, you there&rsquo;s some forgiveness for for making</p>
<p>mistakes. But when you&rsquo;re constantly wrong, maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time to get somebody else in there. That&rsquo;s true. And Fauci,</p>
<p>by the way, Fauci app with respect to code, we talked about</p>
<p>it before 100% participated in a suppression of the investigation</p>
<p>into the origins of COVID. There was an active attempt to</p>
<p>suppress that. Come on. You know that the the foliage email show</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good science segment.</p>
<p>I do want to give a shout out to the researchers who actually did</p>
<p>this with this woman in New York. It&rsquo;s pretty freaking</p>
<p>incredible. What&rsquo;s incredible is that they did it with HIV</p>
<p>patients who had blood cancer. And it was a really kind of like</p>
<p>thoughtfully designed experiment. Incredibly</p>
<p>thoughtful. Yeah, it&rsquo;s been four years. So I mean, this has been</p>
<p>baking for a long time. By the way, as I zoom out and hear you</p>
<p>guys talk about what HIV was like, you know, back in the day</p>
<p>and the fear around it, I do think that 3040 years from now,</p>
<p>given the tools we have with induced stem cells and cell</p>
<p>based therapies, and there are hundreds of cell based therapies</p>
<p>coming to market over the next few years, they&rsquo;re all in late</p>
<p>stage clinical trials, as well as gene editing, I think</p>
<p>hopefully, and I&rsquo;m optimistic that one day, we will look back</p>
<p>at cancer and aging in the same way that we&rsquo;re talking about HIV</p>
<p>today, and that both of those diseases can and will be</p>
<p>resolved with the tools that we&rsquo;re developing through</p>
<p>science. And you know, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>bumps along the road. But man, I, you know, it&rsquo;s so clear that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s go, go.</p>
<p>Look, I think I think what Freeberg just said, actually is</p>
<p>really important and inspiring. And I think it&rsquo;s great. And I</p>
<p>was kind of joking around with the Fauci thing. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect it to become a tangent. So I don&rsquo;t need to keep going on</p>
<p>and on.</p>
<p>When you see him, when you see him in editing, try to change</p>
<p>his position.</p>
<p>Keep that whole segment.</p>
<p>Can you use of kind of a voice?</p>
<p>If you had to become so argumentative, we wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>spent five minutes on it.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m correct, you&rsquo;re incorrect position that</p>
<p>on ramp, please, because I got to fly to Europe. Go.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go. David Sachs and Paul Graham have gotten into</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s a battle for the ages and the stakes are so low. The</p>
<p>stakes are so high. And the animosity is so high because the</p>
<p>stakes are so low. Here we go.</p>
<p>Wait, but get it before this. Does Phil Helmuth qualified this</p>
<p>as a billionaire battle or a</p>
<p>literally, he revealed the billionaire if you follow Phil</p>
<p>Helmuth account, it&rsquo;s being da greatest, being the greatest on</p>
<p>Twitter, being da greatest to get that phil. No, Phil Helmuth</p>
<p>outed he on his Twitter. His new billionaire bestie is his which</p>
<p>he stole bestie from me. I used to call everybody bestie and he</p>
<p>just co opted it. Like he co opted me calling him off the</p>
<p>dictator, but I&rsquo;ll tell the dictator origin story later. Is</p>
<p>Stanley from DoorDash. Stanley tank, co founder, chief product</p>
<p>officer of DoorDash. Great guy. Really great.</p>
<p>Helmuth&rsquo;s latest truffle.</p>
<p>Exactly. Because he found it. Okay, here we go. So some to</p>
<p>Paul Graham.</p>
<p>Go ahead, sex. All right, here&rsquo;s the issue to pick what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>beef? Here we go. Actually, I did not seek out this be sex</p>
<p>vendetta section of the</p>
<p>panel. Listen, PG waded into my tweets. He came after me waited</p>
<p>on waiting. I love it. Please any billionaires out there who</p>
<p>want to like debate like come waiting into my tweets. Mark</p>
<p>Cuban didn&rsquo;t make a big ass of himself. I don&rsquo;t want to deter</p>
<p>these guys from from waiting in because it&rsquo;s great. Here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>basically happened is I tweeted a video of all these</p>
<p>multimillionaire celebrity hypocrites partying massless at</p>
<p>the Super Bowl. And then meanwhile, the next day, my</p>
<p>three kids have to go to school in California wearing their</p>
<p>masks. That is ridiculous. Okay. It makes no sense. We all know</p>
<p>that. Okay. Any sane person knows that. That&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>tweeted about. I don&rsquo;t know why of all issues that was</p>
<p>triggering in a PG, but he had to come in and say, Well, they</p>
<p>were all partying outdoors. It&rsquo;s like, really? Looks to me like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in a skybox. And if it has three walls in the ceiling,</p>
<p>I call that a room. But in any event, that wasn&rsquo;t he was he was</p>
<p>misinformed. Because the rule of the Super Bowl was that if you</p>
<p>were not eating and drinking anyone under over the age of two</p>
<p>have to be wearing a mask. So you know, my point stands, I</p>
<p>just want to air. So here&rsquo;s where things kind of went south</p>
<p>is, is so that I tweeted, blink twice, you know, Paul. And and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing, I wasn&rsquo;t totally trying to be snarky with</p>
<p>that comment. Here&rsquo;s why I said that is because explain what</p>
<p>that means. I didn&rsquo;t understand that. What does that mean?</p>
<p>Blink twice? Well, it means like, are you are a captor,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being held kidnapped by these concepts that you have to</p>
<p>wear? No, you&rsquo;re being held hostage by somebody. And the</p>
<p>reason why I said that is because is is look, if PG had</p>
<p>just been some crazy dumb person ever would have said that the</p>
<p>fact is that PG is smart. He writes extremely well published</p>
<p>a lot of interesting things. He&rsquo;s an independent thinker. So</p>
<p>it almost seemed to me like somebody is holding him hostage</p>
<p>here. Because how can this really smart person be making</p>
<p>this case? Anyway, it kind of went south from there. So I have</p>
<p>no desire to continue that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kendall Jenner wore North Face shoes to Justin</p>
<p>Bieber&rsquo;s. Yeah, can you</p>
<p>she knows that he has a North Face? How did he do that?</p>
<p>Gossip, gossip, gossip.</p>
<p>All right. So this has been saxes, then corner for the week</p>
<p>and for a regular segment. But</p>
<p>the segment saxes,</p>
<p>I want to stay on the main issue here, which is Oh, please, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>do it every week. But</p>
<p>am I wrong about this mass hypocrisy that&rsquo;s going on? How</p>
<p>in the world</p>
<p>picture of sacks in the mess? No, no, no sacks in the bag.</p>
<p>Jake, I&rsquo;ll stop. I want to air 100% support for sacks on this</p>
<p>statement. I totally agree with you on the mask hypocrisy, as</p>
<p>well as the mask mandates in schools. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous. We think that we&rsquo;ve pivoted so far away from first</p>
<p>principle thinking on this stuff. It&rsquo;s nuts. I totally</p>
<p>agree with you completely. And on this point, on you wasting</p>
<p>your time fighting with people on Twitter, my personal advice</p>
<p>to you as a friend is just cut it out. But buddy, but totally</p>
<p>agree. Oh, it&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<p>All right, everybody for the dictator himself chamath</p>
<p>poly hoppitya. Rain Man. Yeah, David Sachs. And the Sultan of</p>
<p>science. If you see him out and about as for a selfie, Sultan of</p>
<p>science love selfies. He does. Love you boys. Bye. See you all</p>
<p>next time on the all in pod. Bye. Bye.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David.</p>
<p>sack.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it. I love you.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release</p>
<p>that.</p>
