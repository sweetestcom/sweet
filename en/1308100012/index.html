    <p>One, two, three, that wasn&rsquo;t my best effort.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Did it again.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>That was better.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you start us off?</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>AKA pumps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here with my friend, Jay Welch, Jennifer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name of our podcast?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it podcast and to start us off, I got to stop you right there.</p>
<p>You did it all out of order.</p>
<p>First we talk about what we&rsquo;ve had it with, the small ones, then we&rsquo;ll do the introduction.</p>
<p>Well then, since you have a rule on how it goes, why don&rsquo;t you be the starter?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Start clap.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>That just reminded me of a huge, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Oh, I cannot wait.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Tell me what you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is a true story.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We go to a march, a rally before voting and we marched down to the Capitol, blah, blah,</p>
<p>So Jennifer is the chant leader.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the person that has the microphone, like the walkie talkie.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;d be like, okay, tell them we&rsquo;re doing chant to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, I get ready to do the walkie talkie.</p>
<p>She is in my boob, has grabbed the walkie talkie and is talking to it, into it.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t happen once.</p>
<p>This happens every single time, every single time.</p>
<p>And I wanted just to throw it at you and go, you fucking do it.</p>
<p>I am the worst.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guilty as charged.</p>
<p>I thought you were going to start breastfeeding any moment.</p>
<p>I mean, you were right there.</p>
<p>It was attached to my jacket, sitting on one of the dragons.</p>
<p>According to my, um, what was that episode at my horoscope?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Probably somewhat controlling.</p>
<p>And I would, I thought she, they&rsquo;re not going to hear her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not doing it right.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the loudest person in 15 counties.</p>
<p>You think they couldn&rsquo;t hear me?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just want to be the sheriff all the time.</p>
<p>Even volunteer work, you need to be a sheriff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>God, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can change.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re too old to change.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge character defect.</p>
<p>Well, but I mean, on the opposite side, you are the sheriff.</p>
<p>I mean, nobody gets more shit done and gets more people laid out and how it&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to roll than you.</p>
<p>So I would rather you be breastfeeding slash calling the chance in a parade rather than</p>
<p>keeping all the other balls in there.</p>
<p>That was a really good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>And I just remembered it.</p>
<p>I deserved it.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Lay it on me.</p>
<p>Hulu and HBO.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to watch one episode of Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale at a time like a civilized, normal person</p>
<p>that moderates their life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re way past that.</p>
<p>Netflix has taught us that we can take a show and inject it straight into our veins.</p>
<p>Episode after episode, season after season.</p>
<p>And then Hulu trots out Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale, which is fantastic.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>And then they torture you with the slow drip.</p>
<p>Same with HBO and Succession or the White Lotus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough of a hit for me and I&rsquo;m not civilized nor patient enough nor do I moderate</p>
<p>myself enough with television to want to watch one episode a week like a normal person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think House of Cards was the first one that you got to binge.</p>
<p>That was the beginning.</p>
<p>And so that was like 15 years ago.</p>
<p>So to take us from we can watch the whole thing in one weekend to spreading it out over</p>
<p>10 weeks, it feels like cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
<p>It really does.</p>
<p>So I want to say this, Hulu and HBO, we have fucking had it.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re paying no matter what.</p>
<p>We have to pay in.</p>
<p>We have the streaming device.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re customers.</p>
<p>So why not just give us what we want?</p>
<p>You could pop out more TV.</p>
<p>Surely there&rsquo;s an economic reason that they could even crank out more.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re trying to keep you interested like back in the day when you had to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re past that as a society.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying we&rsquo;ve evolved way past that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re way past that.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I just wait now until the whole thing&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>And then I just watch it.</p>
<p>I try.</p>
<p>I try to do that.</p>
<p>But I am such a successful television watcher.</p>
<p>You have such elite, elite skills.</p>
<p>I have such elite skills that sometimes I finish Netflix or I finish Hulu.</p>
<p>And so then I am forced to watch them as they are presented to me, which obviously I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>butthurt about.</p>
<p>Jen and Nealy, do y&rsquo;all agree that this is ‚Äì we&rsquo;re as a society, we&rsquo;re way past</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re devolving in this area as a society instead of evolving.</p>
<p>Social media.</p>
<p>Even if you want to wait until everything ‚Äì but everyone&rsquo;s posting about it so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to miss out or get spoilers.</p>
<p>So you have to watch when it comes out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a total ‚Äì</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t noticed that.</p>
<p>Total spoiler alert situation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If you ‚Äì</p>
<p>I mean, even like CNN or Variety, like they&rsquo;ll post about it.</p>
<p>And that annoys me so much.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what we do now?</p>
<p>I would like to welcome everybody to our podcast.</p>
<p>The name of it is I&rsquo;ve Had It.</p>
<p>And I am one of the co-hosts.</p>
<p>My name is Jennifer.</p>
<p>And my other co-host, what&rsquo;s your name, my dear?</p>
<p>Angie.</p>
<p>Angie.</p>
<p>We call her Pumps.</p>
<p>And we have Jen Morton, Nealy, and Richard who chime in.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had it with a variety of things.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing that ‚Äì Pumps and I are from Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>Jen and Nealy are ‚Äì Nealy&rsquo;s from New York.</p>
<p>Jen&rsquo;s from California but they both live in LA.</p>
<p>And so they have that ‚Äì you know, fuck you, first of all, for living in California</p>
<p>and having the ocean, mountains, and 75 degree weather all the time.</p>
<p>I mean that is like ‚Äì that&rsquo;s why people live there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s showing off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we in the Great Plains get weather systems a lot.</p>
<p>So we have this phrase called being weather aware.</p>
<p>And we have to be aware especially in the spring because tornadoes can come.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re weather aware.</p>
<p>You have a smart phone that can talk to you and do lots of things.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a whole dark side to this.</p>
<p>And it is the meteorologists.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They want to grandstand.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll see a weather pattern.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll get on their raging hard-ons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so excited to talk about it, to tell you.</p>
<p>And guess what happens?</p>
<p>Fucking nothing.</p>
<p>Fucking nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago the weathermen are like, listen up, Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>We are going to get 30 inches of snow.</p>
<p>Get ready.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be hunkered down.</p>
<p>The roads are not going to be drivable.</p>
<p>Schools will be closed.</p>
<p>Offices will be closed.</p>
<p>While they&rsquo;re making this prediction, there&rsquo;s not a cloud in the sky.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is like ‚Äì it&rsquo;s incoming like 72 hours, two to three days from now.</p>
<p>They cancel school.</p>
<p>So everybody goes and panic buys.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All the grocery stores are completely cleaned out.</p>
<p>COVID style.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t find toilet paper.</p>
<p>Any of the ‚Äì all the good shit&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They cancel schools.</p>
<p>They cancel work.</p>
<p>Kids are so excited.</p>
<p>Moms are furious.</p>
<p>Furious.</p>
<p>Because they have to stay home with the kids.</p>
<p>Nothing worse than a snow day.</p>
<p>Wake up that morning that ‚Äì it&rsquo;s the worst.</p>
<p>The snow days are the worst.</p>
<p>The worst.</p>
<p>The worst.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in kid jail.</p>
<p>But anyway, I woke up that morning.</p>
<p>Look out the window.</p>
<p>And much to my surprise, there was not one goddamn snowflake.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so all the schools are canceled.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re completely dicked over.</p>
<p>The kids are at home.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having to watch kid shows.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having to cook.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not at work.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the worst.</p>
<p>So basically, there&rsquo;s a lot of lying liars.</p>
<p>The thing about it is, which infuriates me, if I was as terrible at my job as they are</p>
<p>at their job, I would be fired.</p>
<p>Everything they say is not true.</p>
<p>And yet we still ‚Äì listen, like people still like, oh my gosh, did you go to the grocery</p>
<p>store?</p>
<p>Did you have to get in your shelter?</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>When I first came out to Oklahoma and met you guys in 2016 ‚Äì</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was May.</p>
<p>I remember.</p>
<p>And there was a big tornado in the first couple of days.</p>
<p>I called Jay Welch and I was like, what are we going to do?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t be scared of the tornadoes.</p>
<p>The best part is you need to come over here and we&rsquo;re going to watch the meteorologists.</p>
<p>She goes, it&rsquo;s their Super Bowl.</p>
<p>They love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best day of their lives.</p>
<p>Remember, you were scared though because the tornado sirens, you were like, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>the tornado sirens.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, oh, we ignore those.</p>
<p>I was scared.</p>
<p>Was that your first time?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I was scared.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not scared at all.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re born and raised in Oklahoma and it&rsquo;s like tornadoes, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my bad.</p>
<p>I think we need to get into the storm chaser at some point.</p>
<p>What the fuck is wrong with those people?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I do have one kind of funny story.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>When your school, they never shut down for snow days.</p>
<p>When we, my kids were little, I remember specifically getting on to see if school was canceled and</p>
<p>then taking so much joy in the fact that you got to take your kids to school.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Today we have a really fun guest, Matt and Jake, the hosts of Reality Gaze.</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>And Matt is actually an Ardmore, Oklahoma native.</p>
<p>And apparently he is always trying to tell his co-hosts about all the shit going down</p>
<p>in Oklahoma with the weather and he doesn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s have them on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about this fuckery going on with meteorologists.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hi, y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I love y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to be good, but fuck it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an Oklahoma show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a Dr. Pepper.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>That should be Jake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget.</p>
<p>I was in a waiting room with my kid one time and somebody was pouring Dr. Pepper into their</p>
<p>baby&rsquo;s bottle.</p>
<p>And I just thought, only in Oklahoma are we serving Dr. Pepper in our baby bottles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some Lone Grove, Oklahoma shit that I saw.</p>
<p>Is that where you&rsquo;re from?</p>
<p>Lone Grove?</p>
<p>Originally Lone Grove.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Grew up there on Lone Grove.</p>
<p>And then Jake and I met at North Texas.</p>
<p>We went to college together.</p>
<p>Hi, guys.</p>
<p>Hi, Jake.</p>
<p>Oh, so like the Mean Green Eagles?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>North Texas Mean Green.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we went to school.</p>
<p>You guys like have your own talk show set up.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not fucking around.</p>
<p>Oh, Jake.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re in like nice chairs.</p>
<p>Like I expect Oprah to have something underneath the chairs.</p>
<p>There is zero fucking around with I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>One day when I can afford it, Jennifer is going to redo my California house.</p>
<p>I just have to get that house first.</p>
<p>I just need to buy that house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a couple million.</p>
<p>I have pumpers as this year.</p>
<p>I quote you all the time because people say, that&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>I said, I didn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s pumps.</p>
<p>I say 2022 has been a Lazy Susan of shit sandwiches and I just keep eating them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, isn&rsquo;t that the truth?</p>
<p>Sometimes you just feel like you cannot get off the Lazy Susan at all.</p>
<p>That was college.</p>
<p>See, I thought college was fun.</p>
<p>No, I was talking about lying on my Lazy Susan, just being thrown around.</p>
<p>So Matt, you&rsquo;re from Oklahoma originally.</p>
<p>Went to Ardmore.</p>
<p>I did live in Oklahoma city for about a year.</p>
<p>I started my grad school at OCU.</p>
<p>I lived in the El Paseo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from South Carolina originally, but I went to school in Texas and I&rsquo;ve lived in</p>
<p>a town called Pickens or Greenville.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, if you know, South Carolina geography at all, it looks like a piece of pie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from the, the tip of the pie where it&rsquo;s basically inbreeding and moonshine.</p>
<p>So let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Are you low country or high country?</p>
<p>I am high country, but low country food is so much better than high country food.</p>
<p>So what we were talking about before we had you guys on is something that we&rsquo;ve absolutely</p>
<p>had it with our meteorologists.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>They are lying liars.</p>
<p>They are complete lying liars.</p>
<p>They get everybody into hysterics.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s out panic buying, you know, going fucking crazy, stockpiling shit and then quarantining</p>
<p>all up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got, they&rsquo;ve canceled school and if you&rsquo;re a parent, it&rsquo;s fucking miserable.</p>
<p>School is the only thing that is a bridge to sanity as a mother is taking that child</p>
<p>and dropping it off at school.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a total dick over.</p>
<p>And then you wake up in the morning and guess what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fucking snow.</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>How do they get away with this?</p>
<p>They should be prosecuted.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no oversight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an attorney.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no oversight.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of Gary England that you can actually trust.</p>
<p>If you live in Oklahoma, the meteorologists are like big time local celebrities because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gods and we have major weather systems and so you have major weather.</p>
<p>So Gary England was this calm, stable voice that you grew up with your whole life and</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t go bananas.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t go hysterical.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have the weather woody when he was talking about tornadoes because these guys</p>
<p>have erections big time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re way too excited about a tornado.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be huge damage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to level entire towns.</p>
<p>Gary England had big dick weather energy.</p>
<p>He was calm about it.</p>
<p>You are 100% right.</p>
<p>Big dick weather energy.</p>
<p>Big dick weather.</p>
<p>Whereas, but I have to say Jake and I&rsquo;ve talked about on our podcast, I guess, are they still</p>
<p>scientists in Oklahoma?</p>
<p>Cause I didn&rsquo;t live there in 19 years.</p>
<p>Are they still scientists?</p>
<p>Because in California we have weathermen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weathermen.</p>
<p>Dallas Rains.</p>
<p>Dallas Rains.</p>
<p>They say that&rsquo;s his real name.</p>
<p>That is an actual person&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>He is extremely tan.</p>
<p>When you do weather here, it never, nothing really changes that much.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s, it is overcast today and people are expecting the end of the world.</p>
<p>No one knows what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>We were supposed to meet someone later for dinner and I said, I can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s overcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, it&rsquo;s either Dallas Rains or it&rsquo;s women who were models with just oversized</p>
<p>huge jugs that had no hooters that they were never taken a science class.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, are they still scientists in Oklahoma?</p>
<p>I think they are.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think they are meteorologists.</p>
<p>Because they roll out big words.</p>
<p>Like when tornadoes are happening, it&rsquo;s like there is there the rain curtains and the vortex</p>
<p>and what are all the words they use?</p>
<p>That all sounds believable and real.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>I just ignore them.</p>
<p>So I have no help on that.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s, they trot out and I mean they&rsquo;re full blown and you can tell they get</p>
<p>excited because it&rsquo;s like they studied all this stuff and then it&rsquo;s coming to fruition</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, there is like this sociopathic excitement that they have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a narcissism.</p>
<p>Trailer homes are getting leveled and they&rsquo;re like, look at that folks, that&rsquo;s a mile wide.</p>
<p>South Carolina weathermen are like that because we have tornadoes and in the summertime or</p>
<p>like late summer, it&rsquo;ll be like, folks, we&rsquo;ve got an all out barrage going down on Walhalla.</p>
<p>It is going to wipe out most of the county.</p>
<p>We have satellites all over the planet right now.</p>
<p>I can get on Google Earth and basically zoom in on Pumps&rsquo;s nipple.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, she has some high quality nipples because one of her hidden talents</p>
<p>is she can balance a wire hanger on her nipple.</p>
<p>It used to be a wood hanger, but with age, with age, she&rsquo;s had to demotivate to a wire</p>
<p>hanger.</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m gay, so it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I kind of want to see that.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show you off the camera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally fine.</p>
<p>Everybody who&rsquo;s ever had more than two drinks with me in this entire county has seen that</p>
<p>trick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll try to tit out.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s almost clinical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sexual.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like if the party&rsquo;s like winding down, we got to.</p>
<p>Like shaking hands.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you guys want to see the nipple trick?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Jake get naked at three different parties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to throw it out anytime.</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s parties that a lot of people aren&rsquo;t getting naked at.</p>
<p>I choose to do it.</p>
<p>So how did you all meet in college?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dying to know this.</p>
<p>We got hired to teach at the same fine arts camp in the Berkshires in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>And Jake was a grad student at the time and I was an undergrad.</p>
<p>So even those programs don&rsquo;t even mix a lot.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m 18 months older than you, do you always make it sound like I&rsquo;m 30 years</p>
<p>older than you?</p>
<p>Jake, I totally get that.</p>
<p>Jennifer acts like-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much younger than you.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s always like, I&rsquo;m much younger than you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like four years is not that much.</p>
<p>Think about all the things you had accomplished it for when I was just a little baby.</p>
<p>This is what she said.</p>
<p>So I call her, trying to be nice, a good friend, I&rsquo;m like, Hey, go get your COVID booster at</p>
<p>the drugstore.</p>
<p>They have them in.</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>She goes, Oh, I&rsquo;m too young for the COVID booster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re such a-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for seniors.</p>
<p>You had to be 50 to get the COVID booster and spoiler alert, I&rsquo;m still two years shy</p>
<p>of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just paving the way for you.</p>
<p>Well, like I&rsquo;ll know all the tricks in the nursing home before she gets there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;ve got to go out to the bars.</p>
<p>We drove like 45 minutes to this bar in Western Massachusetts called the Red Door.</p>
<p>And I mean-</p>
<p>No, Club Red.</p>
<p>A Club Red.</p>
<p>The Red Door is a perfume you marry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>We went out to Club Red, which it is not Angles.</p>
<p>This is not a nice gay bar.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is not like a dance-</p>
<p>Slut Angles.</p>
<p>This is Angles.</p>
<p>Angles is a bar in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>We love it.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s closed.</p>
<p>They all have names like that.</p>
<p>Angles, Attitudes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The Rec Room.</p>
<p>The bars.</p>
<p>Did you, Jake, did you know the 80s shows, Dallas, iconic show Dallas?</p>
<p>J.R. Hewing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In Dallas, there was-</p>
<p>I knew Dallas.</p>
<p>J.R.&rsquo;s and then was the big gay bar and then across the street, Sue Ellen&rsquo;s, which I thought</p>
<p>was so cool.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, J.R.&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I went to J.R.&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>Stand in circles and talk to gay men you had no chance with.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny you bring that up, Jen, because Poodle called me after a night of going out</p>
<p>to J.R.&rsquo;s because that was our stopping ground.</p>
<p>J.R.&rsquo;s, Sue Ellen&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This is a real story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real story.</p>
<p>Eddie, my friend and I who lived in L.A. for a while said we&rsquo;d lived there for like a year</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like, you need to come to L.A. and he&rsquo;s like, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in school here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finishing my doctorate.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a serious academic person.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t leave.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, OK, fine.</p>
<p>And so he called me and he said, this is the morning after and I said, you sound rough.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, I got a little drunk last night.</p>
<p>He said, well, I looked around the club and I was talking about seven different people</p>
<p>and I realized I&rsquo;d fucked all of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to move on.</p>
<p>Well, not all of them, but all of them, at least by proxy, like in other words, I&rsquo;d slept</p>
<p>with like three people who I was talking to, but those three people had slept with the</p>
<p>other three more than once.</p>
<p>That literally was it.</p>
<p>And I said, I think it&rsquo;s time to go on to greener pastures.</p>
<p>So that was you&rsquo;re an academic scholar devoted to your studies and the most unacademic</p>
<p>decision ever leads you to L.A.</p>
<p>Yeah. What was your doctorate in?</p>
<p>Yeah. I did three years of coursework in musicology when I was doing my career and doing</p>
<p>my academic degree.</p>
<p>I was like, this is I don&rsquo;t think I want to be teaching school like in colleges my</p>
<p>whole life. Either of y&rsquo;all teach, do you teach at a law school or do you teach interior</p>
<p>design, Jen?</p>
<p>No, but I would rather I would rather paint the interior walls of my house with a Q-tip</p>
<p>two coats than teach a fucking class.</p>
<p>Yeah. I don&rsquo;t like people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like stupid questions and classrooms are rotten with stupid questions.</p>
<p>I would be a terrible teacher.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the patience.</p>
<p>If if I told somebody how to do something once and they came and asked me how to do it</p>
<p>again, I would I don&rsquo;t think I would be compassionate.</p>
<p>Your empathy might be a little small.</p>
<p>Yeah. It might be just a touch off.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be out the first day, Jen, because someone would ask you the same thing four</p>
<p>times in the first ten minutes of class.</p>
<p>I have to tell you this.</p>
<p>Are you sure that you&rsquo;re qualified to even to advance this far in school?</p>
<p>This far? I have I just want to say that I agree with you on that.</p>
<p>And something definitely I wasn&rsquo;t planning on talking, but you triggered me.</p>
<p>I have had it with people wasting my time.</p>
<p>And the worst of the worst, if you can&rsquo;t do something, you can&rsquo;t show up.</p>
<p>Whatever. Just tell me don&rsquo;t waste my fucking time.</p>
<p>But the worst waste of time for me is when you&rsquo;re in a class and someone everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ready to go. The lecture is done and someone raises their hand and they ask a question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only the most specific question for their own fucking life and has nothing to</p>
<p>do with anyone else.</p>
<p>It drives me insane.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh. We&rsquo;re in a simulation right now because we just had this conversation</p>
<p>last night. Like, do not be the person that asks the question specific to you when</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s done trying to get out of there.</p>
<p>My son, my oldest son, was going to New York on a class field trip, OK?</p>
<p>And the teachers were taking the students.</p>
<p>The parents couldn&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>So I have to go to this fucking parent meeting.</p>
<p>Right. Which is I mean, it is fingernails on a chalkboard for me to sit down with all</p>
<p>the power moms. So we go through the circle jerk of all the stuff and all the rules and</p>
<p>regulations.</p>
<p>Exactly. And then we&rsquo;re at the tail end of it.</p>
<p>And then here comes the hand.</p>
<p>She raises it up.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the question she asks.</p>
<p>She said, you know, do you all have a backup plan?</p>
<p>In case there is a 9-11 style terror attack</p>
<p>while the kids are in New York.</p>
<p>And I audibly said, for fuck&rsquo;s sake, because I&rsquo;m thinking, don&rsquo;t send your fucking</p>
<p>kid to New York if you&rsquo;re that worried about it.</p>
<p>Then, yeah, your kid doesn&rsquo;t go to New York.</p>
<p>I would I would have this was I was teaching in college.</p>
<p>I was a grad student and parents, parents of my students, the college students would</p>
<p>call me. And if I was if I was either if I gave them a</p>
<p>sort of like a grade like, well, you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s really she&rsquo;s been having a rough, rough semester.</p>
<p>And so she hasn&rsquo;t really been there a lot.</p>
<p>And I never heard any over on the bar.</p>
<p>I know. Doing jealous Jenny for babes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what her problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Yeah. Jenny hasn&rsquo;t shown up for class in four weeks.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s last time I saw her, she was getting dragged out of some club.</p>
<p>So you need to worry about your daughter, not her grades.</p>
<p>I had a woman email me and she totally is like, I just I wanted to pitch my daughter to</p>
<p>be an intern for Jennifer Welch Design.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s really interested in interior design.</p>
<p>Did the mother send this?</p>
<p>The mother. And I responded, I only hire interns that send their own resumes to me and</p>
<p>are at least a junior or senior in college majoring in interior design.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the information, signed Jennifer, because I&rsquo;m just like immediately</p>
<p>not going to hire your daughter.</p>
<p>No, because I&rsquo;m not going to have your ass up here running around.</p>
<p>Why the fuck isn&rsquo;t she emailing?</p>
<p>Right. She loves it.</p>
<p>Let me ask y&rsquo;all a question.</p>
<p>Huge red flag.</p>
<p>Let me. Speaking of red flags, I want to ask y&rsquo;all a question.</p>
<p>So Pops has a son that&rsquo;s 22 years old and in college.</p>
<p>And we go to dinner one night and she is like.</p>
<p>Angry, texting somebody, and then she takes a phone call and I go, that had to have been</p>
<p>one of your kids, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>She goes, oh, Sam&rsquo;s mad at me about something that I said in the mom group me.</p>
<p>And I was like, pump the brakes, pump the fucking brakes.</p>
<p>She has browbeat me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a mom group me for a 22 year old.</p>
<p>Who are these people and who are these monsters that they are raising?</p>
<p>Because and so I talked to Sam about it and he&rsquo;s like, please get my mom out of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. Thank you, Jenny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an adult. I don&rsquo;t need my mom.</p>
<p>And what do y&rsquo;all think about that?</p>
<p>Well, Pops, I want to know, why are you in there?</p>
<p>Why are you in there?</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What keeps you there?</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly what keeps me there.</p>
<p>Like Sam is the worst at saying, okay, like parents weekend is this.</p>
<p>We go to Follies.</p>
<p>You got to buy tickets.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no information communicated whatsoever.</p>
<p>And the moms always know like what time, what t-shirt we&rsquo;re supposed to buy, where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re supposed to meet.</p>
<p>Now I understand that he&rsquo;s too old for that.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t communicate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not really in, probably he just doesn&rsquo;t want me to get involved.</p>
<p>I wonder why he doesn&rsquo;t communicate well.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Can y&rsquo;all take a stab at that?</p>
<p>Jen is not, she&rsquo;s not impressed.</p>
<p>I think the whole idea of a mom group me sounds terrifying.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I have to go through.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>My son, my youngest son recently switched schools and there&rsquo;s this mom group me and</p>
<p>it has, I can look it up right now.</p>
<p>Hang on, hold tight.</p>
<p>Let me tell you how many unread group me, um, messages I have in the class.</p>
<p>I have 150 unread messages in the mom group me.</p>
<p>And you know what&rsquo;s going to happen if I never read them?</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing, zero.</p>
<p>The last time I was in there, this is why I decided not to check it anymore.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a mom get together and we can go to Cosa Bella kitchen where we can all take</p>
<p>a pasta cooking class.</p>
<p>I have several fucking problems with that.</p>
<p>Sounds like hell.</p>
<p>Number one, I don&rsquo;t like group activities.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going out for the evening, I don&rsquo;t want to cook.</p>
<p>I want, right.</p>
<p>I want the cooking to be done for me.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re probably going to listen to this and they&rsquo;re probably going to think I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>biggest bitch, but I&rsquo;m okay with it.</p>
<p>It probably already.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;re going to pray.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;re going to pray over the pasta.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a prayer.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a whole, a whole thing.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m on some other.</p>
<p>We just want to come to you.</p>
<p>We just want to come to you.</p>
<p>We, we say father.</p>
<p>We just on our shows where you, you have a, you do a father.</p>
<p>We just prayer where you say, father, we just want to thank you or we just father.</p>
<p>We just prayers.</p>
<p>I grew up.</p>
<p>We just, we just want to thank you for this gluten.</p>
<p>We want to keep gluten in America, less this nourishment to our bodies and the other gluten</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t want them need to know what&rsquo;s up lower.</p>
<p>We pray for them.</p>
<p>How many prayer lists do you think you&rsquo;re on?</p>
<p>Oh, the sins that I think my family commit, everyone&rsquo;s praying for all of us and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all kind of similarly bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just my brother.</p>
<p>My brother will smoke weed occasionally and like the extended family know about it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, I just, it&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s smoking that and it&rsquo;s not good for him.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I get from my mother.</p>
<p>You know, marijuana is a gateway track.</p>
<p>A gateway to calming your ass down.</p>
<p>Jake, are you drinking sweet tea?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m drinking water, but I, I, I grew up with sweet tea.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>Actually, let me show you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Oh God, that has ever happened.</p>
<p>Everywhere we go, she&rsquo;s got this fucking cup and then she has a backup at all times and</p>
<p>she has to have liquid going in the body all the time.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s got a wonder woman thing that pisses me the fuck off cause I can hear it</p>
<p>going.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>She just got it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>She just got mad at me before you come on slurping on a.</p>
<p>There it goes.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had, I have to carry around large beverages.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see doing that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>My mama does that.</p>
<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s water right over there, but you never know.</p>
<p>Just go get it.</p>
<p>What if, what if you get stranded in some place and you need a drink and it also, it</p>
<p>keeps it so cold.</p>
<p>I mean, my mother, I mean, people in LA don&rsquo;t get this, but we talk about like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back where we&rsquo;re from.</p>
<p>If somebody says they&rsquo;re going to happy hour, you know, they&rsquo;re going to Sonic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to a bar because everybody goes to happy hour at Sonic and</p>
<p>my mom, she&rsquo;d be like, it&rsquo;s happy hour, baby.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s going to Sonic to get her.</p>
<p>I just put some vodka in it.</p>
<p>Dr.</p>
<p>Pepper with diet cherry light on the ice route 40, but it&rsquo;s 44, 44 here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with all of that shit.</p>
<p>You can drink out of glasses and that&rsquo;s been good enough for everyone before that.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with all of that shit.</p>
<p>Jake doesn&rsquo;t believe all the stories that I talk about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with Oklahoma stories, which I don&rsquo;t believe are real.</p>
<p>He was talking about all the towns he lives like, well, you know, Davis and they all,</p>
<p>none of them sound real.</p>
<p>And this guy, Wayne Payne, he was talking about way pain.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Wayne Payne, a toka, a toka.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is a story in the pan.</p>
<p>I mean, a city in the panhandle of Oklahoma that is called hooker and their team</p>
<p>mascot is the hooker horny toads right next door to hooker is beaver and their</p>
<p>mascot are the deep beaver dusters.</p>
<p>No, it is true.</p>
<p>Welcome to the beaver duster territory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Hooker horny toads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I was a mascot in high school.</p>
<p>I was the Lone Grove Longhorn, so I don&rsquo;t know what it would be like to be a beaver</p>
<p>duster.</p>
<p>Yes, beaver duster or a hooker horny toad.</p>
<p>I guess that I still can&rsquo;t believe that high school mascots are still a big, like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling me in high school, people I heard about when I went to college, people</p>
<p>dressed up as their mascots.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling you have a whole in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>They have like a whole high school history.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I just, thank you.</p>
<p>He went to a mascot camp.</p>
<p>I did go to mascot.</p>
<p>Do you know how much those mascots make?</p>
<p>I about fell over when I found out like a professional team mascot.</p>
<p>Like we have the rumble, the buffalo for the thunder.</p>
<p>Those mascots make about half a million dollars a year.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Hell, I could do that.</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>Dress me up as rumble and send me out of a cannon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m your girl.</p>
<p>I once tried to do a, uh, a cartwheel in high school and then the, uh, the longhorn</p>
<p>head came off, I fell over and then children started screaming and saying,</p>
<p>Bruno&rsquo;s dad, it didn&rsquo;t go good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Cardinal sin of mascot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you cannot talk, you cannot show your head as a mascot.</p>
<p>And people that do, I have disrespect for them.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t have a lot of arrogance about a lot of things y&rsquo;all, but</p>
<p>I was a damn good fucking mascot.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it that you guys are so like in tune to Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It looks like we have so much in common.</p>
<p>Who would have ever known?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And when you come to Oklahoma.</p>
<p>I feel like I, I feel like I&rsquo;ve lived there half of my life just hearing the</p>
<p>stories.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We are a lot cheaper now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I remember Arbuckle wilderness because the commercials used to come on in North</p>
<p>Texas, it was still a market and we, and he started singing the Arbuckle wilderness</p>
<p>song and I through like imprinting or something, just, he&rsquo;s like, come see the</p>
<p>animals at Arbuckle wilderness.</p>
<p>The animals are waiting for you.</p>
<p>And so now all of our listeners, we will sing it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go to a live show when we go to, we will sing it.</p>
<p>And this is not an Oklahoma city.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go to like fucking Seattle and everybody in Seattle will sing.</p>
<p>Come see the animals at Arbuckle wilderness.</p>
<p>And I basically, one of the reasons I started saying it was, it was when like when</p>
<p>stupid people, that&rsquo;s another thing I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>It was stupid.</p>
<p>People try to engage with wild animals at all and should be murdered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason you were murdered.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That bison gored someone in like North Dakota, cause they were trying to get a</p>
<p>picture.</p>
<p>And I was like, you can get gored by a bison at Arbuckle wilderness.</p>
<p>They should just let the animals out of the cages and just have what, have fun</p>
<p>whatever with those people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you want your picture taken with an animal, here&rsquo;s your real picture.</p>
<p>Take this.</p>
<p>They probably got their Christmas show up now, it&rsquo;s probably very pretty now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big person who doesn&rsquo;t like private zoos of any kind.</p>
<p>Cause I just think they&rsquo;re ridiculous.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s weird to own lots of wild animals.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, and I, I, I just like, let it, let it, let the animals go and let them, let</p>
<p>them just like eat the people who had the private zoo.</p>
<p>Let the animals have the last laugh.</p>
<p>Well, guys, we have to go, but thank you both.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re excited.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re planning, uh, we&rsquo;re planning with Jen, your producer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have you on our show.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thanks for having us.</p>
<p>It was so fun.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>
<p>Those guys are so much fun.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like I want to go stay at their house and live for a little bit.</p>
<p>I love the Southern accents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so comforting.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I love how he tortures the other one with all the Oklahoma stories.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Follow us on all the shit.</p>
<p>Like all the shit.</p>
<p>Say bye to the audience.</p>
<p>Assuming there is one.</p>
