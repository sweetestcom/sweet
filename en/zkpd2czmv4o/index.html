amazing success story that i just got check this out now this was sent to me by someone by the name of genevieve sylvester and this person is a sonographer someone who uses ultrasound to help evaluate different organs like your liver or kidney abdomen etc so you&amp;rsquo;re putting sound waves in the body to help visualize what&amp;rsquo;s going on the inside dr berg i&amp;rsquo;m a sonographer and i&amp;rsquo;ve seen it all about nine months ago i had a young woman come in for an ultrasound of her abdomen because her liver enzymes were elevated a lot her liver was looking beyond just fatty it was dense in what we described as difficult to penetrate she grew up on processed foods and pop we chatted a bit and i told her my thoughts on the food industry and its devastating effect it had on humans fast forward six months later same patient came back for a follow-up and looked at a previous study before scanning her again i put my transducer that&amp;rsquo;s the thing that you actually rub on the outside of the skin that sends sound waves on her abdomen and i actually thought i had the wrong patient previously her liver measured 19 centimeters that&amp;rsquo;s enlarged and now it was 14 centimeters which is normal i asked her if she had changed her diet and she said yes she changed over to keto after we talked about it to see what would happen i then asked her if she watched anyone on youtube and by the way i was going to send her your information but she said some doctor named berg but my results stopped a few days ago so i was going to stop i said no don&amp;rsquo;t i&amp;rsquo;m going to show you why so i showed her what her liver looked like six months prior compared to what it looks like now she started crying a happy cry i didn&amp;rsquo;t tell you yet dr berg but i work at a native reservation where everyone&amp;rsquo;s liver is at least fatty and 80 percent of the population is type 2 diabetic this young woman mid-20s by the way was on her way to diabetes she was so excited and she left knowing she healed herself like her ancestors before her she told me she was going to watch more of your videos and continue to heal and she did say her brother has started when she did as well and had some encouraging results with him too so there my story of a young woman who literally turned her world around and ended her family curse of getting diabetes thank you so much for your wisdom wow talk about a success story and by the way now on our site we are actively and aggressively accumulating success stories and i desperately want your success story too i&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing a lot more videos to share these success stories but i thought it&amp;rsquo;d be great to share this amazing success story with you before i talk a little bit about the liver now a lot of people that have a fatty liver also have diabetes so what is the connection the connection is they&amp;rsquo;re both caused by the same thing usually and that would be insulin resistance now what causes insulin resistance too much insulin anytime we have too much of a certain hormone going into receptor the receptor will protect itself against this excessive communication by becoming resistant or downgraded that&amp;rsquo;s what insulin resistance is it&amp;rsquo;s a compensation so now when we get a resistance to this hormone then the signals don&amp;rsquo;t get back to the pancreas so we get this lack of return communication it will be similar to someone wearing earplugs as you&amp;rsquo;re talking to them and they&amp;rsquo;re not receiving your communication so you&amp;rsquo;re going to start shouting to them right same thing happens with insulin if we get this resistance at the receptor level at the return communication the pancreas doesn&amp;rsquo;t get that acknowledgement and so it starts to put out more and more communication and so hormones are communication so now we have a situation where we have the receipt part is not receiving and the communication part is excessively communicating and that&amp;rsquo;s only going to go so far to the point where now the pancreas is going to get tired it&amp;rsquo;s exhausted and it&amp;rsquo;s like okay i&amp;rsquo;m i&amp;rsquo;m done with communicating that&amp;rsquo;s when we get diabetes okay so now we lose the function of insulin which is the regulation of blood sugar and so now we get nothing to push the blood sugar down so the blood sugars go up and up and up so with all this insulin now which is a storage hormone for glucose and all this carbohydrate that originally created this high insulin we&amp;rsquo;re going to get a fatty liver and so 25 to 46 of the population has a fatty liver and so when the liver becomes fatty it spills over into the other organs and around the organs around your gut that&amp;rsquo;s called visceral fat so if you were to look down right now and you see something protruding out like your belly is protruding out chances are you have a fatty liver if you had an ultrasound you probably could see that you have a fatty liver so what can you do very simply if you&amp;rsquo;re new to my channel click the link down below because i have a whole plan for you number one you&amp;rsquo;re going to get unhealthy keto you&amp;rsquo;re going to cut your carbs down you&amp;rsquo;re going to bring your sugars down to zero number two you&amp;rsquo;re gonna stop snacking okay because every time you eat you trigger insulin and then you&amp;rsquo;re gonna start doing intermittent fasting so you&amp;rsquo;re gonna drop your breakfast do just two meals for right now and then i would also recommend adding choline to your diet because choline can help you speed up the process to get this fat off the liver now just as a side note artificial sweeteners okay like in diet soda can also create insulin resistance but overall this is the plan i highly recommend you do it so you can also have a success story like this young lady hey before you go if you&amp;rsquo;re benefiting from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below'>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>﻿so before we talk about the liver i want to share 
with you an amazing and amazing success story that  </p>
<p>i just got check this out now this was sent to 
me by someone by the name of genevieve sylvester  </p>
<p>and this person is a sonographer someone who uses 
ultrasound to help evaluate different organs like  </p>
<p>your liver or kidney abdomen etc so you&rsquo;re putting 
sound waves in the body to help visualize what&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>going on the inside dr berg i&rsquo;m a sonographer 
and i&rsquo;ve seen it all about nine months ago i had  </p>
<p>a young woman come in for an ultrasound of her 
abdomen because her liver enzymes were elevated  </p>
<p>a lot her liver was looking beyond just fatty 
it was dense in what we described as difficult  </p>
<p>to penetrate she grew up on processed foods and 
pop we chatted a bit and i told her my thoughts  </p>
<p>on the food industry and its devastating effect 
it had on humans fast forward six months later  </p>
<p>same patient came back for a follow-up and 
looked at a previous study before scanning  </p>
<p>her again i put my transducer that&rsquo;s the thing 
that you actually rub on the outside of the skin  </p>
<p>that sends sound waves on her abdomen and 
i actually thought i had the wrong patient  </p>
<p>previously her liver measured 19 centimeters 
that&rsquo;s enlarged and now it was 14 centimeters  </p>
<p>which is normal i asked her if she had changed 
her diet and she said yes she changed over to keto  </p>
<p>after we talked about it to see what would happen 
i then asked her if she watched anyone on youtube  </p>
<p>and by the way i was going to send her your 
information but she said some doctor named  </p>
<p>berg but my results stopped a few days ago so 
i was going to stop i said no don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m going  </p>
<p>to show you why so i showed her what her liver 
looked like six months prior compared to what  </p>
<p>it looks like now she started crying a happy cry i 
didn&rsquo;t tell you yet dr berg but i work at a native  </p>
<p>reservation where everyone&rsquo;s liver is at least 
fatty and 80 percent of the population is type 2  </p>
<p>diabetic this young woman mid-20s by the way was 
on her way to diabetes she was so excited and she  </p>
<p>left knowing she healed herself like her ancestors 
before her she told me she was going to watch more  </p>
<p>of your videos and continue to heal and she did 
say her brother has started when she did as well  </p>
<p>and had some encouraging results with him too 
so there my story of a young woman who literally  </p>
<p>turned her world around and ended her family 
curse of getting diabetes thank you so much  </p>
<p>for your wisdom wow talk about a success 
story and by the way now on our site we are  </p>
<p>actively and aggressively accumulating success 
stories and i desperately want your success story  </p>
<p>too i&rsquo;m going to be doing a lot more videos to 
share these success stories but i thought it&rsquo;d  </p>
<p>be great to share this amazing success story with 
you before i talk a little bit about the liver now  </p>
<p>a lot of people that have a fatty liver also have 
diabetes so what is the connection the connection  </p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re both caused by the same thing usually 
and that would be insulin resistance now what  </p>
<p>causes insulin resistance too much insulin 
anytime we have too much of a certain hormone  </p>
<p>going into receptor the receptor will protect 
itself against this excessive communication  </p>
<p>by becoming resistant or downgraded that&rsquo;s 
what insulin resistance is it&rsquo;s a compensation  </p>
<p>so now when we get a resistance to this hormone 
then the signals don&rsquo;t get back to the pancreas so  </p>
<p>we get this lack of return communication it will 
be similar to someone wearing earplugs as you&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>talking to them and they&rsquo;re not receiving your 
communication so you&rsquo;re going to start shouting  </p>
<p>to them right same thing happens with insulin if 
we get this resistance at the receptor level at  </p>
<p>the return communication the pancreas doesn&rsquo;t get 
that acknowledgement and so it starts to put out  </p>
<p>more and more communication and so hormones are 
communication so now we have a situation where  </p>
<p>we have the receipt part is not receiving and the 
communication part is excessively communicating  </p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s only going to go so far to the point 
where now the pancreas is going to get tired it&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>exhausted and it&rsquo;s like okay i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m done with 
communicating that&rsquo;s when we get diabetes okay  </p>
<p>so now we lose the function of insulin which is 
the regulation of blood sugar and so now we get  </p>
<p>nothing to push the blood sugar down so the 
blood sugars go up and up and up so with all  </p>
<p>this insulin now which is a storage hormone for 
glucose and all this carbohydrate that originally  </p>
<p>created this high insulin we&rsquo;re going 
to get a fatty liver and so 25 to 46  </p>
<p>of the population has a fatty liver and so when 
the liver becomes fatty it spills over into the  </p>
<p>other organs and around the organs around your 
gut that&rsquo;s called visceral fat so if you were  </p>
<p>to look down right now and you see something 
protruding out like your belly is protruding out  </p>
<p>chances are you have a fatty liver if you had an 
ultrasound you probably could see that you have  </p>
<p>a fatty liver so what can you do very simply if 
you&rsquo;re new to my channel click the link down below  </p>
<p>because i have a whole plan for you number 
one you&rsquo;re going to get unhealthy keto  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to cut your carbs down you&rsquo;re 
going to bring your sugars down to zero number  </p>
<p>two you&rsquo;re gonna stop snacking okay because every 
time you eat you trigger insulin and then you&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>gonna start doing intermittent fasting so you&rsquo;re 
gonna drop your breakfast do just two meals for  </p>
<p>right now and then i would also recommend adding 
choline to your diet because choline can help you  </p>
<p>speed up the process to get this fat off the liver 
now just as a side note artificial sweeteners okay  </p>
<p>like in diet soda can also create insulin 
resistance but overall this is the plan i  </p>
<p>highly recommend you do it so you can also 
have a success story like this young lady  </p>
<p>hey before you go if you&rsquo;re benefiting 
from any of my content i would love  </p>
<p>to hear about your success story 
please share it in the link down below</p>
