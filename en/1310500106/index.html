    <p>The following is a conversation with Matt Botmanek,</p>
<p>Director of Neuroscience Research at DeepMind.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brilliant, cross disciplinary mind,</p>
<p>navigating effortlessly between cognitive psychology,</p>
<p>computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the ads.</p>
<p>Two sponsors, The Jordan Harbinger Show</p>
<p>and Magic Spoon Cereal.</p>
<p>Please consider supporting the podcast</p>
<p>by going to jordanharbinger.com slash lex</p>
<p>and also going to magicspoon.com slash lex</p>
<p>and using code lex at checkout</p>
<p>after you buy all of their cereal.</p>
<p>Click the links, buy the stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast</p>
<p>and the journey I&rsquo;m on.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,</p>
<p>or connect with me on Twitter at lexfriedman,</p>
<p>spelled surprisingly without the E,</p>
<p>just F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>This episode is supported by The Jordan Harbinger Show.</p>
<p>Go to jordanharbinger.com slash lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how he knows I sent you.</p>
<p>On that page, subscribe to his podcast</p>
<p>on Apple Podcast, Spotify, and you know where to look.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been binging on his podcast.</p>
<p>Jordan is a great interviewer</p>
<p>and even a better human being.</p>
<p>I recently listened to his conversation with Jack Barsky,</p>
<p>former sleeper agent for the KGB in the 80s</p>
<p>and author of Deep Undercover,</p>
<p>which is a memoir that paints yet another</p>
<p>interesting perspective on the Cold War era.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about the Stalin</p>
<p>and then Gorbachev and Putin eras of Russia,</p>
<p>but this conversation made me realize</p>
<p>that I need to do a deep dive into the Cold War era</p>
<p>to get a complete picture of Russia&rsquo;s recent history.</p>
<p>Again, go to jordanharbinger.com slash lex.</p>
<p>Subscribe to his podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how he knows I sent you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
<p>This episode is also supported by Magic Spoon,</p>
<p>low carb, keto friendly, super amazingly delicious cereal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a keto or very low carb diet</p>
<p>for a long time now.</p>
<p>It helps with my mental performance.</p>
<p>It helps with my physical performance,</p>
<p>even during this crazy push up, pull up challenge I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>including the running, it just feels great.</p>
<p>I used to love cereal.</p>
<p>Obviously, I can&rsquo;t have it now</p>
<p>because most cereals have crazy amounts of sugar,</p>
<p>which is terrible for you, so I quit it years ago.</p>
<p>But Magic Spoon, amazingly, somehow,</p>
<p>is a totally different thing.</p>
<p>Zero sugar, 11 grams of protein,</p>
<p>and only three net grams of carbs.</p>
<p>It tastes delicious.</p>
<p>It has a lot of flavors, two new ones,</p>
<p>including peanut butter.</p>
<p>But if you know what&rsquo;s good for you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll go with cocoa, my favorite flavor,</p>
<p>and the flavor of champions.</p>
<p>Click the magicspoon.com slash lex link in the description</p>
<p>and use code lex at checkout for free shipping</p>
<p>and to let them know I sent you.</p>
<p>They have agreed to sponsor this podcast for a long time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re an amazing sponsor and an even better cereal.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delicious, it&rsquo;s good for you, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Matt Botpenik.</p>
<p>How much of the human brain do you think we understand?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re at a weird moment</p>
<p>in the history of neuroscience in the sense that</p>
<p>I feel like we understand a lot about the brain</p>
<p>at a very high level, but a very coarse level.</p>
<p>When you say high level, what are you thinking?</p>
<p>Are you thinking functional?</p>
<p>Are you thinking structurally?</p>
<p>So in other words, what is the brain for?</p>
<p>What kinds of computation does the brain do?</p>
<p>What kinds of behaviors would we have to explain</p>
<p>if we were gonna look down at the mechanistic level?</p>
<p>And at that level, I feel like we understand</p>
<p>much, much more about the brain</p>
<p>than we did when I was in high school.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s almost like we&rsquo;re seeing it through a fog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only at a very coarse level.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really understand what the neuronal mechanisms are</p>
<p>that underlie these computations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten better at saying,</p>
<p>what are the functions that the brain is computing</p>
<p>that we would have to understand</p>
<p>if we were gonna get down to the neuronal level?</p>
<p>And at the other end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>in the last few years, incredible progress has been made</p>
<p>in terms of technologies that allow us to see,</p>
<p>actually literally see, in some cases,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on at the single unit level,</p>
<p>even the dendritic level.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this yawning gap in between.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So at the high level,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s almost a cognitive science level.</p>
<p>And then at the neuronal level,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s neurobiology and neuroscience,</p>
<p>just studying single neurons,</p>
<p>the synaptic connections and all the dopamine,</p>
<p>all the kind of neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>One blanket statement I should probably make</p>
<p>is that as I&rsquo;ve gotten older,</p>
<p>I have become more and more reluctant</p>
<p>to make a distinction between psychology and neuroscience.</p>
<p>To me, the point of neuroscience</p>
<p>is to study what the brain is for.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a nephrologist</p>
<p>and you wanna learn about the kidney,</p>
<p>you start by saying, what is this thing for?</p>
<p>Well, it seems to be for taking blood on one side</p>
<p>that has metabolites in it that shouldn&rsquo;t be there,</p>
<p>sucking them out of the blood</p>
<p>while leaving the good stuff behind,</p>
<p>and then excreting that in the form of urine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the kidney is for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like obvious.</p>
<p>So the rest of the work is deciding how it does that.</p>
<p>And this, it seems to me,</p>
<p>is the right approach to take to the brain.</p>
<p>You say, well, what is the brain for?</p>
<p>The brain, as far as I can tell, is for producing behavior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for going from perceptual inputs to behavioral outputs,</p>
<p>and the behavioral outputs should be adaptive.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what psychology is about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about understanding the structure of that function.</p>
<p>And then the rest of neuroscience is about figuring out</p>
<p>how those operations are actually carried out</p>
<p>at a mechanistic level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting, but so unlike the kidney,</p>
<p>the brain, the gap between the electrical signal</p>
<p>and behavior, so you truly see neuroscience</p>
<p>as the science that touches behavior,</p>
<p>how the brain generates behavior,</p>
<p>or how the brain converts raw visual information</p>
<p>into understanding.</p>
<p>Like, you basically see cognitive science,</p>
<p>psychology, and neuroscience as all one science.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a personal statement.</p>
<p>Is that a hopeful or a realistic statement?</p>
<p>So certainly you will be correct in your feeling</p>
<p>in some number of years, but that number of years</p>
<p>could be 200, 300 years from now.</p>
<p>Oh, well, there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that aspirational or is that pragmatic engineering</p>
<p>feeling that you have?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both in the sense that this is what I hope</p>
<p>and expect will bear fruit over the coming decades,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also pragmatic in the sense that I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing in either psychology or neuroscience</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s not the framing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it means to understand the brain</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no, if part of the enterprise</p>
<p>is not about understanding the behavior</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being produced.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, but I would compare it</p>
<p>to maybe astronomers looking at the movement</p>
<p>of the planets and the stars without any interest</p>
<p>of the underlying physics, right?</p>
<p>And I would argue that at least in the early days,</p>
<p>there is some value to just tracing the movement</p>
<p>of the planets and the stars without thinking</p>
<p>about the physics too much because it&rsquo;s such a big leap</p>
<p>to start thinking about the physics</p>
<p>before you even understand even the basic structural</p>
<p>elements of&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, I agree with that.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying in the end, the goal should be</p>
<p>to deeply understand.</p>
<p>Well, right, and I think&hellip;</p>
<p>So I thought about this a lot when I was in grad school</p>
<p>because a lot of what I studied in grad school</p>
<p>was psychology and I found myself a little bit confused</p>
<p>about what it meant to&hellip;</p>
<p>It seems like what we were talking about a lot of the time</p>
<p>were virtual causal mechanisms.</p>
<p>Like, oh, well, you know, attentional selection</p>
<p>then selects some object in the environment</p>
<p>and that is then passed on to the motor, you know,</p>
<p>information about that is passed on to the motor system.</p>
<p>But these are virtual mechanisms.</p>
<p>These are, you know, they&rsquo;re metaphors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, you know, there&rsquo;s no reduction going on</p>
<p>in that conversation to some physical mechanism that,</p>
<p>you know, which is really what it would take</p>
<p>to fully understand, you know, how behavior is rising.</p>
<p>But the causal mechanisms are definitely neurons interacting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to say that at this point in history.</p>
<p>So in psychology, at least for me personally,</p>
<p>there was this strange insecurity about trafficking</p>
<p>in these metaphors, you know,</p>
<p>which were supposed to explain the function of the mind.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t ground them in physical mechanisms,</p>
<p>then what is the explanatory validity of these explanations?</p>
<p>And I managed to soothe my own nerves</p>
<p>by thinking about the history of genetics research.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very far from being an expert</p>
<p>on the history of this field.</p>
<p>But I know enough to say that, you know,</p>
<p>Mendelian genetics preceded, you know, Watson and Crick.</p>
<p>And so there was a significant period of time</p>
<p>during which people were, you know,</p>
<p>productively investigating the structure of inheritance</p>
<p>using what was essentially a metaphor,</p>
<p>the notion of a gene, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, genes do this and genes do that.</p>
<p>But, you know, where are the genes?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of an explanatory thing that we made up.</p>
<p>And we ascribed to them these causal properties.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s a dominant, there&rsquo;s a recessive,</p>
<p>and then they recombine it.</p>
<p>And then later, there was a kind of blank there</p>
<p>that was filled in with a physical mechanism.</p>
<p>That connection was made.</p>
<p>But it was worth having that metaphor</p>
<p>because that gave us a good sense</p>
<p>of what kind of causal mechanism we were looking for.</p>
<p>And the fundamental metaphor of cognition, you said,</p>
<p>is the interaction of neurons.</p>
<p>Is that, what is the metaphor?</p>
<p>No, no, the metaphor,</p>
<p>the metaphors we use in cognitive psychology</p>
<p>are things like attention, the way that memory works.</p>
<p>I retrieve something from memory, right?</p>
<p>A memory retrieval occurs.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s not a physical mechanism</p>
<p>that I can examine in its own right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still worth having, that metaphorical level.</p>
<p>Yeah, so yeah, I misunderstood actually.</p>
<p>So the higher level of abstractions</p>
<p>is the metaphor that&rsquo;s most useful.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But what about, so how does that connect</p>
<p>to the idea that that arises from interaction of neurons?</p>
<p>Well, even, is the interaction of neurons</p>
<p>also not a metaphor to you?</p>
<p>Or is it literally, like that&rsquo;s no longer a metaphor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already the lowest level of abstractions</p>
<p>that could actually be directly studied.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m hesitating because I think</p>
<p>what I want to say could end up being controversial.</p>
<p>So what I want to say is, yes,</p>
<p>the interactions of neurons, that&rsquo;s not metaphorical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a physical fact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the causal interactions actually occur.</p>
<p>Now, I suppose you could say,</p>
<p>well, even that is metaphorical relative</p>
<p>to the quantum events that underlie.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go down that rabbit hole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always turtles on top of turtles.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reduction that you can do.</p>
<p>You can say these psychological phenomena</p>
<p>can be explained through a very different</p>
<p>kind of causal mechanism,</p>
<p>which has to do with neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re really trying to do</p>
<p>in neuroscience writ large, as I say,</p>
<p>which for me includes psychology,</p>
<p>is to take these psychological phenomena</p>
<p>and map them onto neural events.</p>
<p>I think remaining forever at the level of description</p>
<p>that is natural for psychology,</p>
<p>for me personally, would be disappointing.</p>
<p>I want to understand how mental activity</p>
<p>arises from neural activity.</p>
<p>But the converse is also true.</p>
<p>Studying neural activity without any sense</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re trying to explain,</p>
<p>to me feels like at best groping around at random.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;ve kind of talked about this bridging</p>
<p>of the gap between psychology and neuroscience,</p>
<p>but do you think it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>like my love is, like I fell in love with psychology</p>
<p>and psychiatry in general with Freud</p>
<p>and when I was really young,</p>
<p>and I hoped to understand the mind.</p>
<p>And for me, understanding the mind,</p>
<p>at least at that young age before I discovered AI</p>
<p>and even neuroscience was to, is psychology.</p>
<p>And do you think it&rsquo;s possible to understand the mind</p>
<p>without getting into all the messy details of neuroscience?</p>
<p>Like you kind of mentioned to you it&rsquo;s appealing</p>
<p>to try to understand the mechanisms at the lowest level,</p>
<p>but do you think that&rsquo;s needed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to understand how the mind works?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important part of the whole picture,</p>
<p>but I would be the last person on earth</p>
<p>to suggest that that reality</p>
<p>renders psychology in its own right unproductive.</p>
<p>I trained as a psychologist.</p>
<p>I am fond of saying that I have learned much more</p>
<p>from psychology than I have from neuroscience.</p>
<p>To me, psychology is a hugely important discipline.</p>
<p>And one thing that warms in my heart is that</p>
<p>ways of investigating behavior</p>
<p>that have been native to cognitive psychology</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s dawn in the 60s</p>
<p>are starting to become,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re starting to become interesting to AI researchers</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been exciting for me to see.</p>
<p>Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you see</p>
<p>as beautiful aspects of psychology,</p>
<p>maybe limiting aspects of psychology?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe just start it off as a science, as a field.</p>
<p>To me, it was when I understood what psychology is,</p>
<p>analytical psychology,</p>
<p>like the way it&rsquo;s actually carried out,</p>
<p>it was really disappointing to see two aspects.</p>
<p>One is how small the N is,</p>
<p>how small the number of subject is in the studies.</p>
<p>And two, it was disappointing to see</p>
<p>how controlled the entire,</p>
<p>how much it was in the lab.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t studying humans in the wild.</p>
<p>There was no mechanism for studying humans in the wild.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I became a little bit disillusioned</p>
<p>to psychology.</p>
<p>And then the modern world of the internet</p>
<p>is so exciting to me.</p>
<p>The Twitter data or YouTube data,</p>
<p>data of human behavior on the internet becomes exciting</p>
<p>because the N grows and then in the wild grows.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just my narrow sense.</p>
<p>Like, do you have a optimistic or pessimistic</p>
<p>cynical view of psychology?</p>
<p>How do you see the field broadly?</p>
<p>When I was in graduate school,</p>
<p>it was early enough that there was still a thrill</p>
<p>in seeing that there were ways of doing,</p>
<p>there were ways of doing experimental science</p>
<p>that provided insight to the structure of the mind.</p>
<p>One thing that impressed me most when I was at that stage</p>
<p>in my education was neuropsychology,</p>
<p>looking at, analyzing the behavior of populations</p>
<p>who had brain damage of different kinds</p>
<p>and trying to understand what the specific deficits were</p>
<p>that arose from a lesion in a particular part of the brain.</p>
<p>And the kind of experimentation that was done</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s still being done to get answers in that context</p>
<p>was so creative and it was so deliberate.</p>
<p>It was good science.</p>
<p>An experiment answered one question but raised another</p>
<p>and somebody would do an experiment</p>
<p>that answered that question.</p>
<p>And you really felt like you were narrowing in on</p>
<p>some kind of approximate understanding</p>
<p>of what this part of the brain was for.</p>
<p>Do you have an example from memory</p>
<p>of what kind of aspects of the mind</p>
<p>could be studied in this kind of way?</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, the very detailed neuropsychological studies</p>
<p>of language function,</p>
<p>looking at production and reception</p>
<p>and the relationship between visual function,</p>
<p>reading and auditory and semantic.</p>
<p>There were these, and still are, these beautiful models</p>
<p>that came out of that kind of research</p>
<p>that really made you feel like you understood something</p>
<p>that you hadn&rsquo;t understood before</p>
<p>about how language processing is organized in the brain.</p>
<p>But having said all that,</p>
<p>I think you are, I mean, I agree with you</p>
<p>that the cost of doing highly controlled experiments</p>
<p>is that you, by construction, miss out on the richness</p>
<p>and complexity of the real world.</p>
<p>One thing that, so I was drawn into science</p>
<p>by what in those days was called connectionism,</p>
<p>which is, of course, what we now call deep learning.</p>
<p>And at that point in history,</p>
<p>neural networks were primarily being used</p>
<p>in order to model human cognition.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t yet really useful for industrial applications.</p>
<p>So you always found neural networks</p>
<p>in biological form beautiful.</p>
<p>Oh, neural networks were very concretely the thing</p>
<p>that drew me into science.</p>
<p>I was handed, are you familiar with the PDP books</p>
<p>from the 80s when I was in,</p>
<p>I went to medical school before I went into science.</p>
<p>And, yeah.</p>
<p>Really, interesting.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I also did a graduate degree in art history,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m kind of exploring.</p>
<p>Well, art history, I understand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a curious, creative mind.</p>
<p>But medical school, with the dream of what,</p>
<p>if we take that slight tangent?</p>
<p>What, did you want to be a surgeon?</p>
<p>I actually was quite interested in surgery.</p>
<p>I was interested in surgery and psychiatry.</p>
<p>And I thought, I must be the only person on the planet</p>
<p>who was torn between those two fields.</p>
<p>And I said exactly that to my advisor in medical school,</p>
<p>who turned out, I found out later,</p>
<p>to be a famous psychoanalyst.</p>
<p>And he said to me, no, no, it&rsquo;s actually not so uncommon</p>
<p>to be interested in surgery and psychiatry.</p>
<p>And he conjectured that the reason</p>
<p>that people develop these two interests</p>
<p>is that both fields are about going beneath the surface</p>
<p>and kind of getting into the kind of secret.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you understand this as someone</p>
<p>who was interested in psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sort of a, there&rsquo;s a cliche phrase</p>
<p>that people use now, like in NPR,</p>
<p>the secret life of blankety blank, right?</p>
<p>And that was part of the thrill of surgery,</p>
<p>was seeing the secret activity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s inside everybody&rsquo;s abdomen and thorax.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very poetic way to connect it to disciplines</p>
<p>that are very, practically speaking,</p>
<p>different from each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure, that&rsquo;s for sure, yes.</p>
<p>So how did we get onto medical school?</p>
<p>So I was in medical school</p>
<p>and I was doing a psychiatry rotation</p>
<p>and my kind of advisor in that rotation</p>
<p>asked me what I was interested in.</p>
<p>And I said, well, maybe psychiatry.</p>
<p>He said, why?</p>
<p>And I said, well, I&rsquo;ve always been interested</p>
<p>in how the brain works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that nobody&rsquo;s doing scientific research</p>
<p>that addresses my interests,</p>
<p>which are, I didn&rsquo;t have a word for it then,</p>
<p>but I would have said about cognition.</p>
<p>And he said, well, you know, I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You might be interested in these books.</p>
<p>And he pulled down the PDB books from his shelf</p>
<p>and they were still shrink wrapped.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t read them, but he handed them to me.</p>
<p>He said, you feel free to borrow these.</p>
<p>And that was, you know, I went back to my dorm room</p>
<p>and I just, you know, read them cover to cover.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s PDB?</p>
<p>Parallel distributed processing,</p>
<p>which was one of the original names for deep learning.</p>
<p>And so I apologize for the romanticized question,</p>
<p>but what idea in the space of neuroscience</p>
<p>and the space of the human brain is to you</p>
<p>the most beautiful, mysterious, surprising?</p>
<p>What had always fascinated me,</p>
<p>even when I was a pretty young kid, I think,</p>
<p>was the paradox that lies in the fact</p>
<p>that the brain is so mysterious</p>
<p>and seems so distant.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s responsible for the full transparency</p>
<p>of everyday life.</p>
<p>The brain is literally what makes everything obvious</p>
<p>and familiar.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always one in the room with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I used to teach, when I taught at Princeton,</p>
<p>I used to teach a cognitive neuroscience course.</p>
<p>And the very last thing I would say to the students was,</p>
<p>you know, people often,</p>
<p>when people think of scientific inspiration,</p>
<p>the metaphor is often, well, look to the stars.</p>
<p>The stars will inspire you to wonder at the universe</p>
<p>and think about your place in it and how things work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m all for looking at the stars,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always been much more inspired.</p>
<p>And my sense of wonder comes from the,</p>
<p>not from the distant, mysterious stars,</p>
<p>but from the extremely intimately close brain.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something just endlessly fascinating</p>
<p>to me about that.</p>
<p>The, like, just like you said,</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s close and yet distant</p>
<p>in terms of our understanding of it.</p>
<p>Do you, are you also captivated by the fact</p>
<p>that this very conversation is happening</p>
<p>because two brains are communicating so that?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>The, I guess what I mean is the subjective nature</p>
<p>of the experience, if it can take a small attention</p>
<p>into the mystical of it, the consciousness,</p>
<p>or when you were saying you&rsquo;re captivated</p>
<p>by the idea of the brain,</p>
<p>are you talking about specifically</p>
<p>the mechanism of cognition?</p>
<p>Or are you also just, like, at least for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like paralyzing the beauty and the mystery</p>
<p>of the fact that it creates the entirety of the experience,</p>
<p>not just the reasoning capability, but the experience.</p>
<p>Well, I definitely resonate with that latter thought.</p>
<p>And I often find discussions of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>to be disappointingly narrow.</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who has always had an interest in art.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I was just gonna go there</p>
<p>because it sounds like somebody who has an interest in art.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there are many layers</p>
<p>to full bore human experience.</p>
<p>And in some ways it&rsquo;s not enough to say,</p>
<p>oh, well, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re talking about cognition,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll add emotion, you know?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible scope</p>
<p>to what humans go through in every moment.</p>
<p>And yes, so that&rsquo;s part of what fascinates me,</p>
<p>is that our brains are producing that.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it&rsquo;s so mysterious to us.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Our brains are literally in our heads</p>
<p>producing this experience.</p>
<p>Producing the experience.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s so mysterious to us.</p>
<p>And so, and the scientific challenge</p>
<p>of getting at the actual explanation for that</p>
<p>is so overwhelming.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Certain people have fixations on particular questions</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s always, that&rsquo;s just always been mine.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say the poetry of that is fascinating.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really interested in natural language as well.</p>
<p>And when you look at artificial intelligence community,</p>
<p>it always saddens me how much</p>
<p>when you try to create a benchmark</p>
<p>for the community to gather around,</p>
<p>how much of the magic of language is lost</p>
<p>when you create that benchmark.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s something, we talk about experience,</p>
<p>the music of the language, the wit,</p>
<p>the something that makes a rich experience,</p>
<p>something that would be required to pass</p>
<p>the spirit of the Turing test is lost in these benchmarks.</p>
<p>And I wonder how to get it back in</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>The moment you try to do like real good rigorous science,</p>
<p>you lose some of that magic.</p>
<p>When you try to study cognition</p>
<p>in a rigorous scientific way,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;re losing some of the magic.</p>
<p>The seeing cognition in a mechanistic way</p>
<p>that AI folk at this stage in our history.</p>
<p>Well, I agree with you, but at the same time,</p>
<p>one thing that I found really exciting</p>
<p>about that first wave of deep learning models in cognition</p>
<p>was the fact that the people who were building these models</p>
<p>were focused on the richness and complexity</p>
<p>of human cognition.</p>
<p>So an early debate in cognitive science,</p>
<p>which I sort of witnessed as a grad student</p>
<p>was about something that sounds very dry,</p>
<p>which is the formation of the past tense.</p>
<p>But there were these two camps.</p>
<p>One said, well, the mind encodes certain rules</p>
<p>and it also has a list of exceptions</p>
<p>because of course, the rule is add ED,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not always what you do.</p>
<p>So you have to have a list of exceptions.</p>
<p>And then there were the connectionists</p>
<p>who evolved into the deep learning people who said,</p>
<p>well, if you look carefully at the data,</p>
<p>if you actually look at corpora, like language corpora,</p>
<p>it turns out to be very rich</p>
<p>because yes, there are most verbs</p>
<p>that you just tack on ED, and then there are exceptions,</p>
<p>but there are rules that the exceptions aren&rsquo;t just random.</p>
<p>There are certain clues to which verbs</p>
<p>should be exceptional.</p>
<p>And then there are exceptions to the exceptions.</p>
<p>And there was a word that was kind of deployed</p>
<p>in order to capture this, which was quasi regular.</p>
<p>In other words, there are rules, but it&rsquo;s messy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s either structure even among the exceptions.</p>
<p>And it would be, yeah, you could try to write down,</p>
<p>we could try to write down the structure</p>
<p>in some sort of closed form,</p>
<p>but really the right way to understand</p>
<p>how the brain is handling all this,</p>
<p>and by the way, producing all of this,</p>
<p>is to build a deep neural network</p>
<p>and train it on this data</p>
<p>and see how it ends up representing all of this richness.</p>
<p>So the way that deep learning</p>
<p>was deployed in cognitive psychology</p>
<p>was that was the spirit of it.</p>
<p>It was about that richness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I always found very compelling,</p>
<p>still do.</p>
<p>Is there something especially interesting</p>
<p>and profound to you</p>
<p>in terms of our current deep learning neural network,</p>
<p>artificial neural network approaches,</p>
<p>and whatever we do understand</p>
<p>about the biological neural networks in our brain?</p>
<p>Is there, there&rsquo;s quite a few differences.</p>
<p>Are some of them to you,</p>
<p>either interesting or perhaps profound</p>
<p>in terms of the gap we might want to try to close</p>
<p>in trying to create a human level intelligence?</p>
<p>What I would say here is something</p>
<p>that a lot of people are saying,</p>
<p>which is that one seeming limitation</p>
<p>of the systems that we&rsquo;re building now</p>
<p>is that they lack the kind of flexibility,</p>
<p>the readiness to sort of turn on a dime</p>
<p>when the context calls for it</p>
<p>that is so characteristic of human behavior.</p>
<p>So is that connected to you to the,</p>
<p>like which aspect of the neural networks in our brain</p>
<p>is that connected to?</p>
<p>Is that closer to the cognitive science level of,</p>
<p>now again, see like my natural inclination</p>
<p>is to separate into three disciplines of neuroscience,</p>
<p>cognitive science and psychology.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve already kind of shut that down</p>
<p>by saying you&rsquo;re kind of see them as separate,</p>
<p>but just to look at those layers,</p>
<p>I guess where is there something about the lowest layer</p>
<p>of the way the neural neurons interact</p>
<p>that is profound to you in terms of this difference</p>
<p>to the artificial neural networks,</p>
<p>or is all the key differences</p>
<p>at a higher level of abstraction?</p>
<p>One thing I often think about is that,</p>
<p>if you take an introductory computer science course</p>
<p>and they are introducing you to the notion</p>
<p>of Turing machines,</p>
<p>one way of articulating</p>
<p>what the significance of a Turing machine is,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a machine emulator.</p>
<p>It can emulate any other machine.</p>
<p>And that to me,</p>
<p>that way of looking at a Turing machine</p>
<p>really sticks with me.</p>
<p>I think of humans as maybe sharing</p>
<p>in some of that character.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re capacity limited,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not Turing machines obviously,</p>
<p>but we have the ability to adapt behaviors</p>
<p>that are very much unlike anything we&rsquo;ve done before,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some basic mechanism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s implemented in our brain</p>
<p>that allows us to run software.</p>
<p>But just on that point, you mentioned Turing machine,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, it&rsquo;s fundamentally</p>
<p>our brains are just computational devices in your view.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re getting at?</p>
<p>It was a little bit unclear to this line you drew.</p>
<p>Is there any magic in there</p>
<p>or is it just basic computation?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to think of it as just basic computation,</p>
<p>but mind you, I won&rsquo;t be satisfied</p>
<p>until somebody explains to me</p>
<p>what the basic computations are</p>
<p>that are leading to the full richness of human cognition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be enough for me</p>
<p>to understand what the computations are</p>
<p>that allow people to do arithmetic or play chess.</p>
<p>I want the whole thing.</p>
<p>And a small tangent,</p>
<p>because you kind of mentioned coronavirus,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s group behavior.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting</p>
<p>to your search of understanding the human mind</p>
<p>where behavior of large groups</p>
<p>or just behavior of groups is interesting,</p>
<p>seeing that as a collective mind,</p>
<p>as a collective intelligence,</p>
<p>perhaps seeing the groups of people</p>
<p>as a single intelligent organisms,</p>
<p>especially looking at the reinforcement learning work</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done recently.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, I have the honor of working</p>
<p>with a lot of incredibly smart people</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna take any credit</p>
<p>for leading the way on the multiagent work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s come out of my group or DeepMind lately,</p>
<p>but I do find it fascinating.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think it can&rsquo;t be debated.</p>
<p>You know, human behavior arises within communities.</p>
<p>That just seems to me self evident.</p>
<p>But to me, it is self evident,</p>
<p>but that seems to be a profound aspects</p>
<p>of something that created.</p>
<p>That was like, if you look at like 2001 Space Odyssey</p>
<p>when the monkeys touched the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the magical moment I think Yuval Harari argues</p>
<p>that the ability of our large numbers of humans</p>
<p>to hold an idea, to converge towards idea together,</p>
<p>like you said, shaking hands versus bumping elbows,</p>
<p>somehow converge without being in a room altogether,</p>
<p>just kind of this like distributed convergence</p>
<p>towards an idea over a particular period of time</p>
<p>seems to be fundamental to just every aspect</p>
<p>of our cognition, of our intelligence,</p>
<p>because humans, I will talk about reward,</p>
<p>but it seems like we don&rsquo;t really have</p>
<p>a clear objective function under which we operate,</p>
<p>but we all kind of converge towards one somehow.</p>
<p>And that to me has always been a mystery</p>
<p>that I think is somehow productive</p>
<p>for also understanding AI systems.</p>
<p>But I guess that&rsquo;s the next step.</p>
<p>The first step is try to understand the mind.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s something to the argument</p>
<p>that that kind of like strictly bottom up approach</p>
<p>is wrongheaded.</p>
<p>In other words, there are basic phenomena,</p>
<p>basic aspects of human intelligence</p>
<p>that can only be understood in the context of groups.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m perfectly open to that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been particularly convinced by the notion</p>
<p>that we should consider intelligence</p>
<p>to inhere at the level of communities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, I&rsquo;m sort of stuck on the notion</p>
<p>that the basic unit that we want to understand</p>
<p>is individual humans.</p>
<p>And if we have to understand that</p>
<p>in the context of other humans, fine.</p>
<p>But for me, intelligence is just,</p>
<p>I stubbornly define it as something</p>
<p>that is an aspect of an individual human.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just my, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a matter of taste.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you, but that could be the reductionist dream</p>
<p>of a scientist because you can understand a single human.</p>
<p>It also is very possible that intelligence can only arise</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s multiple intelligences.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s multiple sort of, it&rsquo;s a sad thing,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s true, because it&rsquo;s very difficult to study.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s just one human,</p>
<p>that one human would not be homosapien,</p>
<p>would not become that intelligent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>One thing I will say along these lines</p>
<p>is that I think a serious effort</p>
<p>to understand human intelligence</p>
<p>and maybe to build humanlike intelligence</p>
<p>needs to pay just as much attention</p>
<p>to the structure of the environment</p>
<p>as to the structure of the cognizing system,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a brain or an AI system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing I took away actually</p>
<p>from my early studies with the pioneers</p>
<p>of neural network research,</p>
<p>people like Jay McClelland and John Cohen.</p>
<p>The structure of cognition is really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only partly a function of the architecture of the brain</p>
<p>and the learning algorithms that it implements.</p>
<p>What really shapes it is the interaction of those things</p>
<p>with the structure of the world</p>
<p>in which those things are embedded.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s especially important for,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s made most clear in reinforcement learning</p>
<p>where the simulated environment is,</p>
<p>you can only learn as much as you can simulate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what DeepMind made very clear</p>
<p>with the other aspect of the environment,</p>
<p>which is the self play mechanism of the other agent,</p>
<p>of the competitive behavior,</p>
<p>which the other agent becomes the environment essentially.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I mean, one of the most exciting ideas in AI</p>
<p>is the self play mechanism that&rsquo;s able to learn successfully.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing where competition is essential</p>
<p>for learning, at least in that context.</p>
<p>So if we can step back into another sort of beautiful world,</p>
<p>which is the actual mechanics,</p>
<p>the dirty mess of it of the human brain,</p>
<p>is there something for people who might not know?</p>
<p>Is there something you can comment on</p>
<p>or describe the key parts of the brain</p>
<p>that are important for intelligence or just in general,</p>
<p>what are the different parts of the brain</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re curious about that you&rsquo;ve studied</p>
<p>and that are just good to know about</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about cognition?</p>
<p>Well, my area of expertise, if I have one,</p>
<p>is prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>So, you know. What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Where do we?</p>
<p>It depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>The technical definition is anatomical.</p>
<p>There are parts of your brain</p>
<p>that are responsible for motor behavior</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very easy to identify.</p>
<p>And the region of your cerebral cortex,</p>
<p>the sort of outer crust of your brain</p>
<p>that lies in front of those</p>
<p>is defined as the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And when you say anatomical, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s referring to sort of the geographic region</p>
<p>as opposed to some kind of functional definition.</p>
<p>Exactly, so this is kind of the coward&rsquo;s way out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you what the prefrontal cortex is</p>
<p>just in terms of what part of the real estate it occupies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing in the front of the brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And in fact, the early history</p>
<p>of neuroscientific investigation</p>
<p>of what this front part of the brain does</p>
<p>is sort of funny to read</p>
<p>because it was really World War I</p>
<p>that started people down this road</p>
<p>of trying to figure out what different parts of the brain,</p>
<p>the human brain do in the sense</p>
<p>that there were a lot of people with brain damage</p>
<p>who came back from the war with brain damage.</p>
<p>And that provided, as tragic as that was,</p>
<p>it provided an opportunity for scientists</p>
<p>to try to identify the functions of different brain regions.</p>
<p>And that was actually incredibly productive,</p>
<p>but one of the frustrations that neuropsychologists faced</p>
<p>was they couldn&rsquo;t really identify exactly</p>
<p>what the deficit was that arose from damage</p>
<p>to these most kind of frontal parts of the brain.</p>
<p>It was just a very difficult thing to pin down.</p>
<p>There were a couple of neuropsychologists</p>
<p>who identified through a large amount</p>
<p>of clinical experience and close observation,</p>
<p>they started to put their finger on a syndrome</p>
<p>that was associated with frontal damage.</p>
<p>Actually, one of them was a Russian neuropsychologist</p>
<p>named Luria, who students of cognitive psychology still read.</p>
<p>And what he started to figure out was that</p>
<p>the frontal cortex was somehow involved in flexibility,</p>
<p>in guiding behaviors that required someone</p>
<p>to override a habit, or to do something unusual,</p>
<p>or to change what they were doing in a very flexible way</p>
<p>from one moment to another.</p>
<p>So focused on like new experiences.</p>
<p>And so the way your brain processes</p>
<p>and acts in new experiences.</p>
<p>Yeah, what later helped bring this function</p>
<p>into better focus was a distinction</p>
<p>between controlled and automatic behavior,</p>
<p>or in other literatures, this is referred to</p>
<p>as habitual behavior versus goal directed behavior.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, very clear that the human brain</p>
<p>has pathways that are dedicated to habits,</p>
<p>to things that you do all the time,</p>
<p>and they need to be automatized</p>
<p>so that they don&rsquo;t require you to concentrate too much.</p>
<p>So that leaves your cognitive capacity</p>
<p>free to do other things.</p>
<p>Just think about the difference</p>
<p>between driving when you&rsquo;re learning to drive</p>
<p>versus driving after you&rsquo;re a fairly expert.</p>
<p>There are brain pathways that slowly absorb</p>
<p>those frequently performed behaviors</p>
<p>so that they can be habits, so that they can be automatic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like the purest form of learning.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s happening there, which is why,</p>
<p>I mean, this is kind of jumping ahead,</p>
<p>which is why that perhaps is the most useful for us</p>
<p>to focusing on and trying to see</p>
<p>how artificial intelligence systems can learn.</p>
<p>Is that the way you think?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I do think about this distinction</p>
<p>between controlled and automatic,</p>
<p>or goal directed and habitual behavior a lot</p>
<p>in thinking about where we are in AI research.</p>
<p>But just to finish the kind of dissertation here,</p>
<p>the role of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is generally understood these days</p>
<p>sort of in contradistinction to that habitual domain.</p>
<p>In other words, the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is what helps you override those habits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what allows you to say,</p>
<p>well, what I usually do in this situation is X,</p>
<p>but given the context, I probably should do Y.</p>
<p>I mean, the elbow bump is a great example, right?</p>
<p>Reaching out and shaking hands</p>
<p>is probably a habitual behavior,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the prefrontal cortex that allows us</p>
<p>to bear in mind that there&rsquo;s something unusual</p>
<p>going on right now, and in this situation,</p>
<p>I need to not do the usual thing.</p>
<p>The kind of behaviors that Luria reported,</p>
<p>and he built tests for detecting these kinds of things,</p>
<p>were exactly like this.</p>
<p>So in other words, when I stick out my hand,</p>
<p>I want you instead to present your elbow.</p>
<p>A patient with frontal damage</p>
<p>would have a great deal of trouble with that.</p>
<p>Somebody proffering their hand would elicit a handshake.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is what allows us to say,</p>
<p>hold on, hold on, that&rsquo;s the usual thing,</p>
<p>but I have the ability to bear in mind</p>
<p>even very unusual contexts and to reason about</p>
<p>what behavior is appropriate there.</p>
<p>Just to get a sense, are us humans special</p>
<p>in the presence of the prefrontal cortex?</p>
<p>Do mice have a prefrontal cortex?</p>
<p>Do other mammals that we can study?</p>
<p>If no, then how do they integrate new experiences?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really tricky question</p>
<p>and a very timely question</p>
<p>because we have revolutionary new technologies</p>
<p>for monitoring, measuring,</p>
<p>and also causally influencing neural behavior</p>
<p>in mice and fruit flies.</p>
<p>And these techniques are not fully available</p>
<p>even for studying brain function in monkeys,</p>
<p>let alone humans.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a very sort of, for me at least,</p>
<p>a very urgent question whether the kinds of things</p>
<p>that we wanna understand about human intelligence</p>
<p>can be pursued in these other organisms.</p>
<p>And to put it briefly, there&rsquo;s disagreement.</p>
<p>People who study fruit flies will often tell you,</p>
<p>hey, fruit flies are smarter than you think.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll point to experiments where fruit flies</p>
<p>were able to learn new behaviors,</p>
<p>were able to generalize from one stimulus to another</p>
<p>in a way that suggests that they have abstractions</p>
<p>that guide their generalization.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had many conversations in which</p>
<p>I will start by observing,</p>
<p>recounting some observation about mouse behavior</p>
<p>where it seemed like mice were taking an awfully long time</p>
<p>to learn a task that for a human would be profoundly trivial.</p>
<p>And I will conclude from that,</p>
<p>that mice really don&rsquo;t have the cognitive flexibility</p>
<p>that we want to explain.</p>
<p>And then a mouse researcher will say to me,</p>
<p>well, hold on, that experiment may not have worked</p>
<p>because you asked a mouse to deal with stimuli</p>
<p>and behaviors that were very unnatural for the mouse.</p>
<p>If instead you kept the logic of the experiment the same,</p>
<p>but presented the information in a way</p>
<p>that aligns with what mice are used to dealing with</p>
<p>in their natural habitats,</p>
<p>you might find that a mouse actually has more intelligence</p>
<p>than you think.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll go on to show you videos</p>
<p>of mice doing things in their natural habitat,</p>
<p>which seem strikingly intelligent,</p>
<p>dealing with physical problems.</p>
<p>I have to drag this piece of food back to my lair,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something in my way</p>
<p>and how do I get rid of that thing?</p>
<p>So I think these are open questions</p>
<p>to put it, to sum that up.</p>
<p>And then taking a small step back related to that</p>
<p>is you kind of mentioned we&rsquo;re taking a little shortcut</p>
<p>by saying it&rsquo;s a geographic part of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is a region of the brain.</p>
<p>But if we, what&rsquo;s your sense in a bigger philosophical view,</p>
<p>prefrontal cortex and the brain in general,</p>
<p>do you have a sense that it&rsquo;s a set of subsystems</p>
<p>in the way we&rsquo;ve kind of implied</p>
<p>that are pretty distinct or to what degree is it that</p>
<p>or to what degree is it a giant interconnected mess</p>
<p>where everything kind of does everything</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s impossible to disentangle them?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s overwhelming evidence</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s functional differentiation,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s clearly not the case</p>
<p>that all parts of the brain are doing the same thing.</p>
<p>This follows immediately from the kinds of studies</p>
<p>of brain damage that we were chatting about before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious from what you see</p>
<p>if you stick an electrode in the brain</p>
<p>and measure what&rsquo;s going on at the level of neural activity.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are two other things to add,</p>
<p>which kind of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe tug in the other direction.</p>
<p>One is that it&rsquo;s when you look carefully</p>
<p>at functional differentiation in the brain,</p>
<p>what you usually end up concluding,</p>
<p>at least this is my observation of the literature,</p>
<p>is that the differences between regions are graded</p>
<p>rather than being discreet.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>to divide the brain up into true modules</p>
<p>that have clear boundaries and that have</p>
<p>you know, clear channels of communication between them.</p>
<p>And this applies to the prefrontal cortex?</p>
<p>Yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is made up</p>
<p>of a bunch of different subregions,</p>
<p>the functions of which are not clearly defined</p>
<p>and the borders of which seem to be quite vague.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s popping up</p>
<p>in very recent research, which, you know, which,</p>
<p>involves application of these new techniques,</p>
<p>which there are a number of studies that suggest that</p>
<p>parts of the brain that we would have previously thought</p>
<p>were quite focused in their function</p>
<p>are actually carrying signals</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t have thought would be there.</p>
<p>For example, looking in the primary visual cortex,</p>
<p>which is classically thought of as basically</p>
<p>the first cortical way station</p>
<p>for processing visual information.</p>
<p>Basically what it should care about is, you know,</p>
<p>where are the edges in this scene that I&rsquo;m viewing?</p>
<p>It turns out that if you have enough data,</p>
<p>you can recover information from primary visual cortex</p>
<p>about all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Like, you know, what behavior the animal is engaged</p>
<p>in right now and how much reward is on offer</p>
<p>in the task that it&rsquo;s pursuing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear that even regions whose function</p>
<p>is pretty well defined at a core screen</p>
<p>are nonetheless carrying some information</p>
<p>about information from very different domains.</p>
<p>So, you know, the history of neuroscience</p>
<p>is sort of this oscillation between the two views</p>
<p>that you articulated, you know, the kind of modular view</p>
<p>and then the big, you know, mush view.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think, I guess we&rsquo;re gonna end up</p>
<p>somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Which is unfortunate for our understanding</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something about our, you know,</p>
<p>conceptual system that finds it&rsquo;s easy to think about</p>
<p>a modularized system and easy to think about</p>
<p>a completely undifferentiated system.</p>
<p>But something that kind of lies in between is confusing.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re gonna have to get used to it, I think.</p>
<p>Unless we can understand deeply the lower level mechanism</p>
<p>of neuronal communication.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But on that topic, you kind of mentioned information.</p>
<p>Just to get a sense, I imagine something</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s still mystery and disagreement on</p>
<p>is how does the brain carry information and signal?</p>
<p>Like what in your sense is the basic mechanism</p>
<p>of communication in the brain?</p>
<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;m old fashioned in that I consider</p>
<p>the networks that we use in deep learning research</p>
<p>to be a reasonable approximation to, you know,</p>
<p>the mechanisms that carry information in the brain.</p>
<p>So the usual way of articulating that is to say,</p>
<p>what really matters is a rate code.</p>
<p>What matters is how quickly is an individual neuron spiking?</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s the frequency at which it&rsquo;s spiking?</p>
<p>Is it right?</p>
<p>So the timing of the spike.</p>
<p>Yeah, is it firing fast or slow?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, you know, let&rsquo;s put a number on that.</p>
<p>And that number is enough to capture</p>
<p>what neurons are doing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s still uncertainty</p>
<p>about whether that&rsquo;s an adequate description</p>
<p>of how information is transmitted within the brain.</p>
<p>There, you know, there are studies that suggest</p>
<p>that the precise timing of spikes matters.</p>
<p>There are studies that suggest that there are computations</p>
<p>that go on within the dendritic tree, within a neuron,</p>
<p>that are quite rich and structured</p>
<p>and that really don&rsquo;t equate to anything that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in our artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>Having said that, I feel like we can get,</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re getting somewhere</p>
<p>by sticking to this high level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Just the rate, and by the way,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the electrical signal.</p>
<p>I remember reading some vague paper somewhere recently</p>
<p>where the mechanical signal, like the vibrations</p>
<p>or something of the neurons, also communicates information.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen that, but.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody who was arguing</p>
<p>that the electrical signal, this is in a nature paper,</p>
<p>something like that, where the electrical signal</p>
<p>is actually a side effect of the mechanical signal.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that changes the story.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s almost an interesting idea</p>
<p>that there could be a deeper, it&rsquo;s always like in physics</p>
<p>with quantum mechanics, there&rsquo;s always a deeper story</p>
<p>that could be underlying the whole thing.</p>
<p>But you think it&rsquo;s basically the rate of spiking</p>
<p>that gets us, that&rsquo;s like the lowest hanging fruit</p>
<p>that can get us really far.</p>
<p>This is a classical view.</p>
<p>I mean, this is not, the only way in which this stance</p>
<p>would be controversial is in the sense</p>
<p>that there are members of the neuroscience community</p>
<p>who are interested in alternatives.</p>
<p>But this is really a very mainstream view.</p>
<p>The way that neurons communicate</p>
<p>is that neurotransmitters arrive,</p>
<p>they wash up on a neuron, the neuron has receptors</p>
<p>for those transmitters, the meeting of the transmitter</p>
<p>with these receptors changes the voltage of the neuron.</p>
<p>And if enough voltage change occurs, then a spike occurs,</p>
<p>one of these like discrete events.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that spike that is conducted down the axon</p>
<p>and leads to neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p>This is just like neuroscience 101.</p>
<p>This is like the way the brain is supposed to work.</p>
<p>Now, what we do when we build artificial neural networks</p>
<p>of the kind that are now popular in the AI community</p>
<p>is that we don&rsquo;t worry about those individual spikes.</p>
<p>We just worry about the frequency</p>
<p>at which those spikes are being generated.</p>
<p>And people talk about that as the activity of a neuron.</p>
<p>And so the activity of units in a deep learning system</p>
<p>is broadly analogous to the spike rate of a neuron.</p>
<p>There are people who believe that there are other forms</p>
<p>of communication in the brain.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve been involved in some research recently</p>
<p>that suggests that the voltage fluctuations</p>
<p>that occur in populations of neurons</p>
<p>that are sort of below the level of spike production</p>
<p>may be important for communication.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m still pretty old school in the sense</p>
<p>that I think that the things that we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>in AI research constitute reasonable models</p>
<p>of how a brain would work.</p>
<p>Let me ask just for fun a crazy question, because I can.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible we&rsquo;re completely wrong</p>
<p>about the way this basic mechanism</p>
<p>of neuronal communication, that the information</p>
<p>is stored in some very different kind of way in the brain?</p>
<p>Oh, heck yes.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I wouldn&rsquo;t be a scientist</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t think there was any chance we were wrong.</p>
<p>But I mean, if you look at the history</p>
<p>of deep learning research as it&rsquo;s been applied</p>
<p>to neuroscience, of course the vast majority</p>
<p>of deep learning research these days isn&rsquo;t about neuroscience.</p>
<p>But if you go back to the 1980s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of an unbroken chain of research</p>
<p>in which a particular strategy is taken,</p>
<p>which is, hey, let&rsquo;s train a deep learning system.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s train a multi layer neural network</p>
<p>on this task that we trained our rat on,</p>
<p>or our monkey on, or this human being on.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s look at what the units</p>
<p>deep in the system are doing.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s ask whether what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>resembles what we know about what neurons</p>
<p>deep in the brain are doing.</p>
<p>And over and over and over and over,</p>
<p>that strategy works in the sense that</p>
<p>the learning algorithms that we have access to,</p>
<p>which typically center on back propagation,</p>
<p>they give rise to patterns of activity,</p>
<p>patterns of response,</p>
<p>patterns of neuronal behavior in these artificial models</p>
<p>that look hauntingly similar to what you see in the brain.</p>
<p>And is that a coincidence?</p>
<p>At a certain point, it starts looking like such coincidence</p>
<p>is unlikely to not be deeply meaningful, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.</p>
<p>But it could be.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re always open to total flipping at the table.</p>
<p>Hey, of course.</p>
<p>So you have coauthored several recent papers</p>
<p>that sort of weave beautifully between the world</p>
<p>of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And maybe if we could, can we just try to dance around</p>
<p>and talk about some of them?</p>
<p>Maybe try to pick out interesting ideas</p>
<p>that jump to your mind from memory.</p>
<p>So maybe looking at, we were talking about</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex, the 2018, I believe, paper</p>
<p>called the Prefrontal Cortex</p>
<p>as a Meta Reinforcement Learning System.</p>
<p>What, is there a key idea</p>
<p>that you can speak to from that paper?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the key idea is about meta learning.</p>
<p>What is meta learning?</p>
<p>Meta learning is, by definition,</p>
<p>a situation in which you have a learning algorithm</p>
<p>and the learning algorithm operates in such a way</p>
<p>that it gives rise to another learning algorithm.</p>
<p>In the earliest applications of this idea,</p>
<p>you had one learning algorithm sort of adjusting</p>
<p>the parameters on another learning algorithm.</p>
<p>But the case that we&rsquo;re interested in this paper</p>
<p>is one where you start with just one learning algorithm</p>
<p>and then another learning algorithm kind of emerges</p>
<p>out of thin air.</p>
<p>I can say more about what I mean by that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be scurrentist,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the idea of meta learning.</p>
<p>It relates to the old idea in psychology</p>
<p>of learning to learn.</p>
<p>Situations where you have experiences</p>
<p>that make you better at learning something new.</p>
<p>A familiar example would be learning a foreign language.</p>
<p>The first time you learn a foreign language,</p>
<p>it may be quite laborious and disorienting</p>
<p>and novel, but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>two foreign languages.</p>
<p>The third foreign language, obviously,</p>
<p>is gonna be much easier to pick up.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve learned how to learn.</p>
<p>You know how this goes.</p>
<p>You know, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna have to learn how to conjugate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a simple form of meta learning</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s some slow learning mechanism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s helping you kind of update</p>
<p>your fast learning mechanism.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>So how from our understanding from the psychology world,</p>
<p>from neuroscience, our understanding</p>
<p>how meta learning might work in the human brain,</p>
<p>what lessons can we draw from that</p>
<p>that we can bring into the artificial intelligence world?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, so the origin of that paper</p>
<p>was in AI work that we were doing in my group.</p>
<p>We were looking at what happens</p>
<p>when you train a recurrent neural network</p>
<p>using standard reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
<p>But you train that network, not just in one task,</p>
<p>but you train it in a bunch of interrelated tasks.</p>
<p>And then you ask what happens when you give it</p>
<p>yet another task in that sort of line of interrelated tasks.</p>
<p>And what we started to realize is that</p>
<p>a form of meta learning spontaneously happens</p>
<p>in recurrent neural networks.</p>
<p>And the simplest way to explain it is to say</p>
<p>a recurrent neural network has a kind of memory</p>
<p>in its activation patterns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s recurrent by definition in the sense</p>
<p>that you have units that connect to other units,</p>
<p>that connect to other units.</p>
<p>So you have sort of loops of connectivity,</p>
<p>which allows activity to stick around</p>
<p>and be updated over time.</p>
<p>In psychology we call, in neuroscience</p>
<p>we call this working memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like actively holding something in mind.</p>
<p>And so that memory gives</p>
<p>the recurrent neural network a dynamics, right?</p>
<p>The way that the activity pattern evolves over time</p>
<p>is inherent to the connectivity</p>
<p>of the recurrent neural network, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s idea number one.</p>
<p>Now, the dynamics of that network are shaped</p>
<p>by the connectivity, by the synaptic weights.</p>
<p>And those synaptic weights are being shaped</p>
<p>by this reinforcement learning algorithm</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re training the network with.</p>
<p>So the punchline is if you train a recurrent neural network</p>
<p>with a reinforcement learning algorithm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s adjusting its weights,</p>
<p>and you do that for long enough,</p>
<p>the activation dynamics will become very interesting, right?</p>
<p>So imagine I give you a task</p>
<p>where you have to press one button or another,</p>
<p>left button or right button.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some probability</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna give you an M&amp;M</p>
<p>if you press the left button,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some probability I&rsquo;ll give you an M&amp;M</p>
<p>if you press the other button.</p>
<p>And you have to figure out what those probabilities are</p>
<p>just by trying things out.</p>
<p>But as I said before,</p>
<p>instead of just giving you one of these tasks,</p>
<p>I give you a whole sequence.</p>
<p>You know, I give you two buttons</p>
<p>and you figure out which one&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>And I go, good job, here&rsquo;s a new box.</p>
<p>Two new buttons, you have to figure out which one&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>Good job, here&rsquo;s a new box.</p>
<p>And every box has its own probabilities</p>
<p>and you have to figure it out.</p>
<p>So if you train a recurrent neural network</p>
<p>on that kind of sequence of tasks,</p>
<p>what happens, it seemed almost magical to us</p>
<p>when we first started kind of realizing what was going on.</p>
<p>The slow learning algorithm that&rsquo;s adjusting</p>
<p>the synaptic weights,</p>
<p>those slow synaptic changes give rise to a network dynamics</p>
<p>that themselves, that, you know,</p>
<p>the dynamics themselves turn into a learning algorithm.</p>
<p>So in other words, you can tell this is happening</p>
<p>by just freezing the synaptic weights saying,</p>
<p>okay, no more learning, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a new box, figure out which button is best.</p>
<p>And the recurrent neural network will do this just fine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, like it figures out which button is best.</p>
<p>It kind of transitions from exploring the two buttons</p>
<p>to just pressing the one that it likes best</p>
<p>in a very rational way.</p>
<p>How is that happening?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening because the activity dynamics</p>
<p>of the network have been shaped by the slow learning process</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurred over many, many boxes.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happened is that this slow learning algorithm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s slowly adjusting the weights</p>
<p>is changing the dynamics of the network,</p>
<p>the activity dynamics into its own learning algorithm.</p>
<p>And as we were kind of realizing that this is a thing,</p>
<p>it just so happened that the group that was working on this</p>
<p>included a bunch of neuroscientists</p>
<p>and it started kind of ringing a bell for us,</p>
<p>which is to say that we thought this sounds a lot</p>
<p>like the distinction between synaptic learning</p>
<p>and activity, synaptic memory</p>
<p>and activity based memory in the brain.</p>
<p>And it also reminded us of recurrent connectivity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very characteristic of prefrontal function.</p>
<p>So this is kind of why it&rsquo;s good to have people working</p>
<p>on AI that know a little bit about neuroscience</p>
<p>and vice versa, because we started thinking</p>
<p>about whether we could apply this principle to neuroscience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the paper came from.</p>
<p>So the kind of principle of the recurrence</p>
<p>they can see in the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>then you start to realize that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>for something like an idea of a learning</p>
<p>to learn emerging from this learning process</p>
<p>as long as you keep varying the environment sufficiently.</p>
<p>Exactly, so the kind of metaphorical transition</p>
<p>we made to neuroscience was to think,</p>
<p>okay, well, we know that the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is highly recurrent.</p>
<p>We know that it&rsquo;s an important locus for working memory</p>
<p>for activation based memory.</p>
<p>So maybe the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>supports reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>In other words, what is reinforcement learning?</p>
<p>You take an action, you see how much reward you got,</p>
<p>you update your policy of behavior.</p>
<p>Maybe the prefrontal cortex is doing that sort of thing</p>
<p>strictly in its activation patterns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s keeping around a memory in its activity patterns</p>
<p>of what you did, how much reward you got,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s using that activity based memory</p>
<p>as a basis for updating behavior.</p>
<p>But then the question is, well,</p>
<p>how did the prefrontal cortex get so smart?</p>
<p>In other words, where did these activity dynamics come from?</p>
<p>How did that program that&rsquo;s implemented</p>
<p>in the recurrent dynamics of the prefrontal cortex arise?</p>
<p>And one answer that became evident in this work was,</p>
<p>well, maybe the mechanisms that operate</p>
<p>on the synaptic level, which we believe are mediated</p>
<p>by dopamine, are responsible for shaping those dynamics.</p>
<p>So this may be a silly question,</p>
<p>but because this kind of several temporal sort of classes</p>
<p>of learning are happening and the learning to learnism</p>
<p>emerges, can you keep building stacks of learning</p>
<p>to learn to learn, learning to learn to learn</p>
<p>to learn to learn because it keeps,</p>
<p>I mean, basically abstractions of more powerful abilities</p>
<p>to generalize of learning complex rules.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s overstretching this kind of mechanism.</p>
<p>Well, one of the people in AI who started thinking</p>
<p>about meta learning from very early on,</p>
<p>J√ºrgen Schmidhuber sort of cheekily suggested,</p>
<p>I think it may have been in his PhD thesis,</p>
<p>that we should think about meta, meta, meta,</p>
<p>meta, meta, meta learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s gonna get us to true intelligence.</p>
<p>Certainly there&rsquo;s a poetic aspect to it</p>
<p>and it seems interesting and correct</p>
<p>that that kind of levels of abstraction would be powerful,</p>
<p>but is that something you see in the brain?</p>
<p>This kind of, is it useful to think of learning</p>
<p>in these meta, meta, meta way or is it just meta learning?</p>
<p>Well, one thing that really fascinated me</p>
<p>about this mechanism that we were starting to look at,</p>
<p>and other groups started talking</p>
<p>about very similar things at the same time.</p>
<p>And then a kind of explosion of interest</p>
<p>in meta learning happened in the AI community</p>
<p>shortly after that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we had anything to do with that,</p>
<p>but I was gratified to see that a lot of people</p>
<p>started talking about meta learning.</p>
<p>One of the things that I liked about the kind of flavor</p>
<p>of meta learning that we were studying was that</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t require anything special.</p>
<p>It was just, if you took a system that had</p>
<p>some form of memory that the function of which</p>
<p>could be shaped by pick URL algorithm,</p>
<p>then this would just happen, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there are a lot of forms of,</p>
<p>there are a lot of meta learning algorithms</p>
<p>that have been proposed since then</p>
<p>that are fascinating and effective</p>
<p>in their domains of application.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re engineered, they&rsquo;re things that somebody</p>
<p>had to say, well, gee, if we wanted meta learning</p>
<p>to happen, how would we do that?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an algorithm that would,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about the kind of meta learning</p>
<p>that we were studying that seemed to me special</p>
<p>in the sense that it wasn&rsquo;t an algorithm.</p>
<p>It was just something that automatically happened</p>
<p>if you had a system that had memory</p>
<p>and it was trained with a reinforcement learning algorithm.</p>
<p>And in that sense, it can be as meta as it wants to be.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no limit on how abstract the meta learning can get</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not reliant on a human engineering</p>
<p>a particular meta learning algorithm to get there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I also, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I guess I hope that that&rsquo;s relevant in the brain.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a kind of beauty</p>
<p>in the ability of this emergent.</p>
<p>The emergent aspect of it, as opposed to engineered.</p>
<p>Exactly, it&rsquo;s something that just, it just happens</p>
<p>in a sense, in a sense, you can&rsquo;t avoid this happening.</p>
<p>If you have a system that has memory</p>
<p>and the function of that memory is shaped</p>
<p>by reinforcement learning, and this system is trained</p>
<p>in a series of interrelated tasks, this is gonna happen.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t stop it.</p>
<p>As long as you have certain properties,</p>
<p>maybe like a recurrent structure to.</p>
<p>You have to have memory.</p>
<p>It actually doesn&rsquo;t have to be a recurrent neural network.</p>
<p>One of, a paper that I was honored to be involved</p>
<p>with even earlier, used a kind of slot based memory.</p>
<p>Do you remember the title?</p>
<p>Just for people to understand.</p>
<p>It was Memory Augmented Neural Networks.</p>
<p>I think it was, I think the title was</p>
<p>Meta Learning in Memory Augmented Neural Networks.</p>
<p>And it was the same exact story.</p>
<p>If you have a system with memory,</p>
<p>here it was a different kind of memory,</p>
<p>but the function of that memory is shaped</p>
<p>by reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Here it was the reads and writes that occurred</p>
<p>on this slot based memory.</p>
<p>This will just happen.</p>
<p>But this brings us back to something I was saying earlier</p>
<p>about the importance of the environment.</p>
<p>This will happen if the system is being trained</p>
<p>in a setting where there&rsquo;s like a sequence of tasks</p>
<p>that all share some abstract structure.</p>
<p>Sometimes we talk about task distributions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s very obviously true</p>
<p>of the world that humans inhabit.</p>
<p>Like if you just kind of think about what you do every day,</p>
<p>you never do exactly the same thing</p>
<p>that you did the day before.</p>
<p>But everything that you do sort of has a family resemblance.</p>
<p>It shares a structure with something that you did before.</p>
<p>And so the real world is sort of</p>
<p>saturated with this kind of, this property.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s endless variety with endless redundancy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the setting in which</p>
<p>this kind of meta learning happens.</p>
<p>And it does seem like we&rsquo;re just so good at finding,</p>
<p>just like in this emergent phenomena you described,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really good at finding that redundancy,</p>
<p>finding those similarities, the family resemblance.</p>
<p>Some people call it sort of, what is it?</p>
<p>Melanie Mitchell was talking about analogies.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re able to connect concepts together</p>
<p>in this kind of way,</p>
<p>in this same kind of automated emergent way,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s so many echoes here</p>
<p>of psychology and neuroscience.</p>
<p>And obviously now with reinforcement learning</p>
<p>with recurrent neural networks at the core.</p>
<p>If we could talk a little bit about dopamine,</p>
<p>you have really, you&rsquo;re a part of coauthoring</p>
<p>really exciting recent paper, very recent,</p>
<p>in terms of release on dopamine</p>
<p>and temporal difference learning.</p>
<p>Can you describe the key ideas of that paper?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing I want to pause to do</p>
<p>is acknowledge my coauthors</p>
<p>on actually both of the papers we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So this dopamine paper.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just, I&rsquo;ll certainly post all their names.</p>
<p>Okay, wonderful.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I&rsquo;m sort of abashed</p>
<p>to be the spokesperson for these papers</p>
<p>when I had such amazing collaborators on both.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a comfort to me to know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll acknowledge them.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an incredible team there, but yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s such a, it&rsquo;s so much fun.</p>
<p>And in the case of the dopamine paper,</p>
<p>we also collaborated with Naochit at Harvard,</p>
<p>who, you know, obviously a paper simply</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without him.</p>
<p>But so you were asking for like a thumbnail sketch of.</p>
<p>Yeah, thumbnail sketch or key ideas or, you know,</p>
<p>things, the insights that are, you know,</p>
<p>continuing on our kind of discussion here</p>
<p>between neuroscience and AI.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this was another,</p>
<p>a lot of the work that we&rsquo;ve done so far</p>
<p>is taking ideas that have bubbled up in AI</p>
<p>and, you know, asking the question of whether the brain</p>
<p>might be doing something related,</p>
<p>which I think on the surface sounds like something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really mainly of use to neuroscience.</p>
<p>We see it also as a way of validating</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing on the AI side.</p>
<p>If we can gain some evidence that the brain</p>
<p>is using some technique that we&rsquo;ve been trying out</p>
<p>in our AI work, that gives us confidence</p>
<p>that, you know, it may be a good idea,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll, you know, scale to rich, complex tasks,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll interface well with other mechanisms.</p>
<p>So you see it as a two way road.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. Just because a particular paper</p>
<p>is a little bit focused on from one to the,</p>
<p>from AI, from neural networks to neuroscience.</p>
<p>Ultimately the discussion, the thinking,</p>
<p>the productive longterm aspect of it</p>
<p>is the two way road nature of the whole interaction.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we&rsquo;ve talked about the notion</p>
<p>of a virtuous circle between AI and neuroscience.</p>
<p>And, you know, the way I see it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always been there since the two fields,</p>
<p>you know, jointly existed.</p>
<p>There have been some phases in that history</p>
<p>when AI was sort of ahead.</p>
<p>There are some phases when neuroscience was sort of ahead.</p>
<p>I feel like given the burst of innovation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened recently on the AI side,</p>
<p>AI is kind of ahead in the sense that</p>
<p>there are all of these ideas that we, you know,</p>
<p>for which it&rsquo;s exciting to consider</p>
<p>that there might be neural analogs.</p>
<p>And neuroscience, you know,</p>
<p>in a sense has been focusing on approaches</p>
<p>to studying behavior that come from, you know,</p>
<p>that are kind of derived from this earlier era</p>
<p>of cognitive psychology.</p>
<p>And, you know, so in some ways fail to connect</p>
<p>with some of the issues that we&rsquo;re grappling with in AI.</p>
<p>Like how do we deal with, you know,</p>
<p>large, you know, complex environments.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think it&rsquo;s inevitable</p>
<p>that this circle will keep turning</p>
<p>and there will be a moment</p>
<p>in the not too different distant future</p>
<p>when neuroscience is pelting AI researchers</p>
<p>with insights that may change the direction of our work.</p>
<p>Just a quick human question.</p>
<p>Is it, you have parts of your brain,</p>
<p>this is very meta, but they&rsquo;re able to both think</p>
<p>about neuroscience and AI.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t often meet people like that.</p>
<p>So do you think, let me ask a meta plasticity question.</p>
<p>Do you think a human being can be both good at AI</p>
<p>and neuroscience?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what, on the team at DeepMind,</p>
<p>what kind of human can occupy these two realms?</p>
<p>And is that something you see everybody should be doing,</p>
<p>can be doing, or is that a very special few</p>
<p>can kind of jump?</p>
<p>Just like we talk about art history,</p>
<p>I would think it&rsquo;s a special person</p>
<p>that can major in art history</p>
<p>and also consider being a surgeon.</p>
<p>Otherwise known as a dilettante.</p>
<p>A dilettante, yeah.</p>
<p>Easily distracted.</p>
<p>No, I think it does take a special kind of person</p>
<p>to be truly world class at both AI and neuroscience.</p>
<p>And I am not on that list.</p>
<p>I happen to be someone whose interest in neuroscience</p>
<p>and psychology involved using the kinds</p>
<p>of modeling techniques that are now very central in AI.</p>
<p>And that sort of, I guess, bought me a ticket</p>
<p>to be involved in all of the amazing things</p>
<p>that are going on in AI research right now.</p>
<p>I do know a few people who I would consider</p>
<p>pretty expert on both fronts,</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t embarrass them by naming them,</p>
<p>but there are exceptional people out there</p>
<p>who are like this.</p>
<p>The one thing that I find is a barrier</p>
<p>to being truly world class on both fronts</p>
<p>is just the complexity of the technology</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in both disciplines now.</p>
<p>So the engineering expertise that it takes</p>
<p>to do truly frontline, hands on AI research</p>
<p>is really, really considerable.</p>
<p>The learning curve of the tools,</p>
<p>just like the specifics of just whether it&rsquo;s programming</p>
<p>or the kind of tools necessary to collect the data,</p>
<p>to manage the data, to distribute, to compute,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And on the neuroscience, I guess, side,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be all different sets of tools.</p>
<p>Exactly, especially with the recent explosion</p>
<p>in neuroscience methods.</p>
<p>So having said all that,</p>
<p>I think the best scenario for both neuroscience</p>
<p>and AI is to have people interacting</p>
<p>who live at every point on this spectrum</p>
<p>from exclusively focused on neuroscience</p>
<p>to exclusively focused on the engineering side of AI.</p>
<p>But to have those people inhabiting a community</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re talking to people who live elsewhere</p>
<p>on the spectrum.</p>
<p>And I may be someone who&rsquo;s very close to the center</p>
<p>in the sense that I have one foot in the neuroscience world</p>
<p>and one foot in the AI world,</p>
<p>and that central position, I will admit,</p>
<p>prevents me, at least someone</p>
<p>with my limited cognitive capacity,</p>
<p>from having true technical expertise in either domain.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I at least hope</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s worthwhile having people around</p>
<p>who can kind of see the connections.</p>
<p>Yeah, the community, the emergent intelligence</p>
<p>of the community when it&rsquo;s nicely distributed is useful.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>So hopefully that, I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen that work,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that work out well at DeepMind.</p>
<p>There are people who, I mean, even if you just focus</p>
<p>on the AI work that happens at DeepMind,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a good thing to have some people around</p>
<p>doing that kind of work whose PhDs are in neuroscience</p>
<p>or psychology.</p>
<p>Every academic discipline has its kind of blind spots</p>
<p>and kind of unfortunate obsessions and its metaphors</p>
<p>and its reference points,</p>
<p>and having some intellectual diversity is really healthy.</p>
<p>People get each other unstuck, I think.</p>
<p>I see it all the time at DeepMind.</p>
<p>And I like to think that the people</p>
<p>who bring some neuroscience background to the table</p>
<p>are helping with that.</p>
<p>So one of my probably the deepest passion for me,</p>
<p>what I would say, maybe we kind of spoke off mic</p>
<p>a little bit about it, but that I think is a blind spot</p>
<p>for at least robotics and AI folks</p>
<p>is human robot interaction, human agent interaction.</p>
<p>Maybe do you have thoughts about how we reduce the size</p>
<p>of that blind spot?</p>
<p>Do you also share the feeling that not enough folks</p>
<p>are studying this aspect of interaction?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m actually pretty intensively interested</p>
<p>in this issue now, and there are people in my group</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve actually pivoted pretty hard over the last few years</p>
<p>from doing more traditional cognitive psychology</p>
<p>and cognitive neuroscience to doing experimental work</p>
<p>on human agent interaction.</p>
<p>And there are a couple of reasons that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty passionately interested in this.</p>
<p>One is it&rsquo;s kind of the outcome of having thought</p>
<p>for a few years now about what we&rsquo;re up to.</p>
<p>Like what are we doing?</p>
<p>Like what is this AI research for?</p>
<p>So what does it mean to make the world a better place?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m pretty sure that means making life better</p>
<p>for humans.</p>
<p>And so how do you make life better for humans?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a proposition that when you look at it carefully</p>
<p>and honestly is rather horrendously complicated,</p>
<p>especially when the AI systems</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re building are learning systems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not programming something</p>
<p>that you then introduce to the world</p>
<p>and it just works as programmed,</p>
<p>like Google Maps or something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building systems that learn from experience.</p>
<p>So that typically leads to AI safety questions.</p>
<p>How do we keep these things from getting out of control?</p>
<p>How do we keep them from doing things that harm humans?</p>
<p>And I mean, I hasten to say,</p>
<p>I consider those hugely important issues.</p>
<p>And there are large sectors of the research community</p>
<p>at DeepMind and of course elsewhere</p>
<p>who are dedicated to thinking hard all day,</p>
<p>every day about that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, I guess I would say a positive side to this too</p>
<p>which is to say, well, what would it mean</p>
<p>to make human life better?</p>
<p>And how can we imagine learning systems doing that?</p>
<p>And in talking to my colleagues about that,</p>
<p>we reached the initial conclusion</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not sufficient to philosophize about that.</p>
<p>You actually have to take into account</p>
<p>how humans actually work and what humans want</p>
<p>and the difficulties of knowing what humans want</p>
<p>and the difficulties that arise</p>
<p>when humans want different things.</p>
<p>And so human agent interaction has become,</p>
<p>a quite intensive focus of my group lately.</p>
<p>If for no other reason that,</p>
<p>in order to really address that issue in an adequate way,</p>
<p>you have to, I mean, psychology becomes part of the picture.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so there&rsquo;s a few elements there.</p>
<p>So if you focus on solving like the,</p>
<p>if you focus on the robotics problem,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say AGI without humans in the picture</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re missing fundamentally the final step.</p>
<p>When you do want to help human civilization,</p>
<p>you eventually have to interact with humans.</p>
<p>And when you create a learning system, just as you said,</p>
<p>that will eventually have to interact with humans,</p>
<p>the interaction itself has to be become,</p>
<p>has to become part of the learning process.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t just watch, well, my sense is,</p>
<p>it sounds like your sense is you can&rsquo;t just watch humans</p>
<p>to learn about humans.</p>
<p>You have to also be part of the human world.</p>
<p>You have to interact with humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And I mean, then questions arise that start imperceptibly,</p>
<p>but inevitably to slip beyond the realm of engineering.</p>
<p>So questions like, if you have an agent</p>
<p>that can do something that you can&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>under what conditions do you want that agent to do it?</p>
<p>So if I have a robot that can play Beethoven sonatas</p>
<p>better than any human, in the sense that the sensitivity,</p>
<p>the expression is just beyond what any human,</p>
<p>do I want to listen to that?</p>
<p>Do I want to go to a concert and hear a robot play?</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t engineering questions.</p>
<p>These are questions about human preference</p>
<p>and human culture.</p>
<p>Psychology bordering on philosophy.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then you start asking,</p>
<p>well, even if we knew the answer to that,</p>
<p>is it our place as AI engineers</p>
<p>to build that into these agents?</p>
<p>Probably the agents should interact with humans</p>
<p>beyond the population of AI engineers</p>
<p>and figure out what those humans want.</p>
<p>And then when you start,</p>
<p>I referred this the moment ago,</p>
<p>but even that becomes complicated.</p>
<p>Be quote, what if two humans want different things?</p>
<p>And you have only one agent that&rsquo;s able to interact with them</p>
<p>and try to satisfy their preferences.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re into the realm of economics</p>
<p>and social choice theory and even politics.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense in which,</p>
<p>if you kind of follow what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to its logical conclusion,</p>
<p>then it goes beyond questions of engineering and technology</p>
<p>and starts to shade imperceptibly into questions</p>
<p>about what kind of society do you want?</p>
<p>And actually, once that dawned on me,</p>
<p>I actually felt,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right word is,</p>
<p>quite refreshed in my involvement in AI research.</p>
<p>It was almost like building this kind of stuff</p>
<p>is gonna lead us back to asking really fundamental questions</p>
<p>about what is this,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the good life and who gets to decide</p>
<p>and bringing in viewpoints from multiple sub communities</p>
<p>to help us shape the way that we live.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, it started making me feel like</p>
<p>doing AI research in a fully responsible way, would,</p>
<p>could potentially lead to a kind of like cultural renewal.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the way to understand human beings</p>
<p>at the individual, at the societal level.</p>
<p>It may become a way to answer all the silly human questions</p>
<p>of the meaning of life and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Even if it doesn&rsquo;t give us a way</p>
<p>of answering those questions,</p>
<p>it may force us back to thinking about them.</p>
<p>And it might bring, it might restore a certain,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a certain depth to,</p>
<p>or even dare I say spirituality to the way that,</p>
<p>to the world, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s too grandiose.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s AI will be the philosophy of the 21st century,</p>
<p>the way which will open the door.</p>
<p>I think a lot of AI researchers are afraid to open that door</p>
<p>of exploring the beautiful richness</p>
<p>of the human agent interaction, human AI interaction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy that somebody like you</p>
<p>have opened that door.</p>
<p>And one thing I often think about is the usual schema</p>
<p>for thinking about human agent interaction</p>
<p>as this kind of dystopian, oh, our robot overlords.</p>
<p>And again, I hasten to say AI safety is hugely important.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying we shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking</p>
<p>about those risks, totally on board for that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, having said that,</p>
<p>what often follows for me is the thought</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s another kind of narrative</p>
<p>that might be relevant, which is,</p>
<p>when we think of humans gaining more and more information</p>
<p>about human life, the narrative there is usually</p>
<p>that they gain more and more wisdom</p>
<p>and they get closer to enlightenment</p>
<p>and they become more benevolent.</p>
<p>And the Buddha is like, that&rsquo;s a totally different narrative.</p>
<p>And why isn&rsquo;t it the case that we imagine</p>
<p>that the AI systems that we&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>are just gonna, like, they&rsquo;re gonna figure out</p>
<p>more and more about the way the world works</p>
<p>and the way that humans interact</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll become beneficent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that will happen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t honestly expect that to happen</p>
<p>without some careful, setting things up very carefully.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s another way things could go, right?</p>
<p>And yeah, and I would even push back on that.</p>
<p>I personally believe that the most trajectories,</p>
<p>natural human trajectories will lead us towards progress.</p>
<p>So for me, there is a kind of sense</p>
<p>that most trajectories in AI development</p>
<p>will lead us into trouble.</p>
<p>To me, and we over focus on the worst case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in computer science,</p>
<p>theoretical computer science has been this focus</p>
<p>on worst case analysis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something appealing to our human mind</p>
<p>at some lowest level to be good.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t wanna be eaten by the tiger, I guess.</p>
<p>So we wanna do the worst case analysis.</p>
<p>But the reality is that shouldn&rsquo;t stop us</p>
<p>from actually building out all the other trajectories</p>
<p>which are potentially leading to all the positive worlds,</p>
<p>all the enlightenment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book, Enlightenment Now,</p>
<p>with Steven Pinker and so on.</p>
<p>This is looking generally at human progress.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many ways that human progress</p>
<p>can happen with AI.</p>
<p>And I think you have to do that research.</p>
<p>You have to do that work.</p>
<p>You have to do the, not just the AI safety work</p>
<p>of the one worst case analysis.</p>
<p>How do we prevent that?</p>
<p>But the actual tools and the glue</p>
<p>and the mechanisms of human AI interaction</p>
<p>that would lead to all the positive actions that can go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a super exciting area, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, we should be spending,</p>
<p>we should be spending a lot of our time saying</p>
<p>what can go wrong.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s harder to see that there&rsquo;s work to be done</p>
<p>to bring into focus the question of what it would look like</p>
<p>for things to go right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>And we wouldn&rsquo;t be doing this if we didn&rsquo;t have the sense</p>
<p>there was huge potential, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing this for no reason.</p>
<p>We have a sense that AGI would be a major boom to humanity.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s worth starting now,</p>
<p>even when our technology is quite primitive,</p>
<p>asking exactly what would that mean?</p>
<p>We can start now with applications</p>
<p>that are already gonna make the world a better place,</p>
<p>like solving protein folding.</p>
<p>I think DeepMind has gotten heavy</p>
<p>into science applications lately,</p>
<p>which I think is a wonderful, wonderful move</p>
<p>for us to be making.</p>
<p>But when we think about AGI,</p>
<p>when we think about building fully intelligent</p>
<p>agents that are gonna be able to, in a sense,</p>
<p>do whatever they want,</p>
<p>we should start thinking about</p>
<p>what do we want them to want, right?</p>
<p>What kind of world do we wanna live in?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an easy question.</p>
<p>And I think we just need to start working on it.</p>
<p>And even on the path to,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be AGI,</p>
<p>but just intelligent agents that interact with us</p>
<p>and help us enrich our own existence on social networks,</p>
<p>for example, on recommender systems of various intelligence.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much interesting interaction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s yet to be understood and studied.</p>
<p>And how do you create,</p>
<p>I mean, Twitter is struggling with this very idea,</p>
<p>how do you create AI systems</p>
<p>that increase the quality and the health of a conversation?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful human psychology question.</p>
<p>And how do you do that</p>
<p>without deception being involved,</p>
<p>without manipulation being involved,</p>
<p>maximizing human autonomy?</p>
<p>And how do you make these choices in a democratic way?</p>
<p>How do we face the,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;m speaking for myself here.</p>
<p>How do we face the fact that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a small group of people</p>
<p>who have the skillset to build these kinds of systems,</p>
<p>but what it means to make the world a better place</p>
<p>is something that we all have to be talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, the world that we&rsquo;re trying to make a better place</p>
<p>includes a huge variety of different kinds of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, how do we cope with that?</p>
<p>This is a problem that has been discussed</p>
<p>in gory, extensive detail in social choice theory.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m really interested in</p>
<p>and one thing I&rsquo;m really enjoying</p>
<p>about the recent direction work has taken</p>
<p>in some parts of my team is that,</p>
<p>yeah, we&rsquo;re reading the AI literature,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re reading the neuroscience literature,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve also started reading economics</p>
<p>and, as I mentioned, social choice theory,</p>
<p>even some political theory,</p>
<p>because it turns out that it all becomes relevant.</p>
<p>It all becomes relevant.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been trying not to write philosophy papers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been trying not to write physician papers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to figure out ways</p>
<p>of doing actual empirical research</p>
<p>that kind of take the first small steps</p>
<p>to thinking about what it really means</p>
<p>for humans with all of their complexity</p>
<p>and contradiction and paradox</p>
<p>to be brought into contact with these AI systems</p>
<p>in a way that really makes the world a better place.</p>
<p>Often, reinforcement learning frameworks</p>
<p>actually kind of allow you to do that,</p>
<p>machine learning, and so that&rsquo;s the exciting thing about AI</p>
<p>is it allows you to reduce the unsolvable problem,</p>
<p>philosophical problem, into something more concrete</p>
<p>that you can get ahold of.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it allows you to kind of define the problem</p>
<p>in some way that allows for growth in the system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not responsible for the details, right?</p>
<p>You say, this is generally what I want you to do,</p>
<p>and then learning takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>Of course, the safety issues arise in that context,</p>
<p>but I think also some of these positive issues</p>
<p>arise in that context.</p>
<p>What would it mean for an AI system</p>
<p>to really come to understand what humans want?</p>
<p>And with all of the subtleties of that, right?</p>
<p>You know, humans want help with certain things,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t want everything done for them, right?</p>
<p>There is, part of the satisfaction</p>
<p>that humans get from life is in accomplishing things.</p>
<p>So if there were devices around that did everything for,</p>
<p>you know, I often think of the movie WALLI, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like dystopian in a totally different way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, the machines are doing everything for us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we wanted.</p>
<p>You know, anyway, I find this, you know,</p>
<p>this opens up a whole landscape of research</p>
<p>that feels affirmative and exciting.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s one of the most exciting, and it&rsquo;s wide open.</p>
<p>We have to, because it&rsquo;s a cool paper,</p>
<p>talk about dopamine.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, okay, so I can.</p>
<p>We were gonna, I was gonna give you a quick summary.</p>
<p>Yeah, a quick summary of, what&rsquo;s the title of the paper?</p>
<p>I think we called it a distributional code for value</p>
<p>in dopamine based reinforcement learning, yes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another project that grew out of pure AI research.</p>
<p>A number of people at DeepMind and a few other places</p>
<p>had started working on a new version</p>
<p>of reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>which was defined by taking something</p>
<p>in traditional reinforcement learning and just tweaking it.</p>
<p>So the thing that they took</p>
<p>from traditional reinforcement learning was a value signal.</p>
<p>So at the center of reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>at least most algorithms, is some representation</p>
<p>of how well things are going,</p>
<p>your expected cumulative future reward.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s usually represented as a single number.</p>
<p>So if you imagine a gambler in a casino</p>
<p>and the gambler&rsquo;s thinking, well, I have this probability</p>
<p>of winning such and such an amount of money,</p>
<p>and I have this probability of losing such and such</p>
<p>an amount of money, that situation would be represented</p>
<p>as a single number, which is like the expected,</p>
<p>the weighted average of all those outcomes.</p>
<p>And this new form of reinforcement learning said,</p>
<p>well, what if we generalize that</p>
<p>to a distributional representation?</p>
<p>So now we think of the gambler as literally thinking,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s this probability</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll win this amount of money,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this probability</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll lose that amount of money,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t reduce that to a single number.</p>
<p>And it had been observed through experiments,</p>
<p>through just trying this out,</p>
<p>that that kind of distributional representation</p>
<p>really accelerated reinforcement learning</p>
<p>and led to better policies.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition about,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking about rewards.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your intuition why that is, why does it do that?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s kind of a surprising historical note,</p>
<p>at least surprised me when I learned it,</p>
<p>that this had been proven to be true.</p>
<p>This had been tried out in a kind of heuristic way.</p>
<p>People thought, well, gee, what would happen if we tried?</p>
<p>And then it had this, empirically,</p>
<p>it had this striking effect.</p>
<p>And it was only then that people started thinking,</p>
<p>well, gee, wait, why?</p>
<p>Wait, why?</p>
<p>Why is this working?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s led to a series of studies</p>
<p>just trying to figure out why it works, which is ongoing.</p>
<p>But one thing that&rsquo;s already clear from that research</p>
<p>is that one reason that it helps</p>
<p>is that it drives richer representation learning.</p>
<p>So if you imagine two situations</p>
<p>that have the same expected value,</p>
<p>the same kind of weighted average value,</p>
<p>standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms</p>
<p>are going to take those two situations</p>
<p>and kind of, in terms of the way</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re represented internally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna squeeze them together</p>
<p>because the thing that you&rsquo;re trying to represent,</p>
<p>which is their expected value, is the same.</p>
<p>So all the way through the system,</p>
<p>things are gonna be mushed together.</p>
<p>But what if those two situations</p>
<p>actually have different value distributions?</p>
<p>They have the same average value,</p>
<p>but they have different distributions of value.</p>
<p>In that situation, distributional learning</p>
<p>will maintain the distinction between these two things.</p>
<p>So to make a long story short,</p>
<p>distributional learning can keep things separate</p>
<p>in the internal representation</p>
<p>that might otherwise be conflated or squished together.</p>
<p>And maintaining those distinctions</p>
<p>can be useful when the system is now faced</p>
<p>with some other task where the distinction is important.</p>
<p>If we look at the optimistic</p>
<p>and pessimistic dopamine neurons.</p>
<p>So first of all, what is dopamine?</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Why is this at all useful</p>
<p>to think about in the artificial intelligence sense?</p>
<p>But what do we know about dopamine in the human brain?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Why is it useful?</p>
<p>Why is it interesting?</p>
<p>What does it have to do with the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and learning in general?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, well, this is also a case</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a huge amount of detail and debate.</p>
<p>But one currently prevailing idea</p>
<p>is that the function of this neurotransmitter dopamine</p>
<p>resembles a particular component</p>
<p>of standard reinforcement learning algorithms,</p>
<p>which is called the reward prediction error.</p>
<p>So I was talking a moment ago</p>
<p>about these value representations.</p>
<p>How do you learn them?</p>
<p>How do you update them based on experience?</p>
<p>Well, if you made some prediction about a future reward</p>
<p>and then you get more reward than you were expecting,</p>
<p>then probably retrospectively,</p>
<p>you want to go back and increase the value representation</p>
<p>that you attached to that earlier situation.</p>
<p>If you got less reward than you were expecting,</p>
<p>you should probably decrement that estimate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the process of temporal difference.</p>
<p>Exactly, this is the central mechanism</p>
<p>of temporal difference learning,</p>
<p>which is one of several sort of the backbone</p>
<p>of our momentarium in NRL.</p>
<p>And this connection between the reward prediction error</p>
<p>and dopamine was made in the 1990s.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been a huge amount of research</p>
<p>that seems to back it up.</p>
<p>Dopamine may be doing other things,</p>
<p>but this is clearly, at least roughly,</p>
<p>one of the things that it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>But the usual idea was that dopamine</p>
<p>was representing these reward prediction errors,</p>
<p>again, in this like kind of single number way</p>
<p>that representing your surprise with a single number.</p>
<p>And in distributional reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>this kind of new elaboration of the standard approach,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not only the value function</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s represented as a single number,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also the reward prediction error.</p>
<p>And so what happened was that Will Dabney,</p>
<p>one of my collaborators who was one of the first people</p>
<p>to work on distributional temporal difference learning,</p>
<p>talked to a guy in my group, Zeb Kurt Nelson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a computational neuroscientist,</p>
<p>and said, gee, you know, is it possible</p>
<p>that dopamine might be doing something</p>
<p>like this distributional coding thing?</p>
<p>And they started looking at what was in the literature,</p>
<p>and then they brought me in,</p>
<p>and we started talking to Nao Uchida,</p>
<p>and we came up with some specific predictions</p>
<p>about if the brain is using</p>
<p>this kind of distributional coding,</p>
<p>then in the tasks that Nao has studied,</p>
<p>you should see this, this, this, and this,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where the paper came from.</p>
<p>We kind of enumerated a set of predictions,</p>
<p>all of which ended up being fairly clearly confirmed,</p>
<p>and all of which leads to at least some initial indication</p>
<p>that the brain might be doing something</p>
<p>like this distributional coding,</p>
<p>that dopamine might be representing surprise signals</p>
<p>in a way that is not just collapsing everything</p>
<p>to a single number, but instead is kind of respecting</p>
<p>the variety of future outcomes, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So yeah, so that&rsquo;s showing, suggesting possibly</p>
<p>that dopamine has a really interesting</p>
<p>representation scheme in the human brain</p>
<p>for its reward signal.</p>
<p>Exactly. That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another beautiful example of AI</p>
<p>revealing something nice about neuroscience,</p>
<p>potentially suggesting possibilities.</p>
<p>Well, you never know.</p>
<p>So the minute you publish a paper like that,</p>
<p>the next thing you think is, I hope that replicates.</p>
<p>Like, I hope we see that same thing in other data sets,</p>
<p>but of course, several labs now</p>
<p>are doing the followup experiments, so we&rsquo;ll know soon.</p>
<p>But it has been a lot of fun for us</p>
<p>to take these ideas from AI</p>
<p>and kind of bring them into neuroscience</p>
<p>and see how far we can get.</p>
<p>So we kind of talked about it a little bit,</p>
<p>but where do you see the field of neuroscience</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence heading broadly?</p>
<p>Like, what are the possible exciting areas</p>
<p>that you can see breakthroughs in the next,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get crazy, not just three or five years,</p>
<p>but the next 10, 20, 30 years</p>
<p>that would make you excited</p>
<p>and perhaps you&rsquo;d be part of?</p>
<p>On the neuroscience side,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great deal of interest now</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s going on in AI.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>I feel like, so neuroscience,</p>
<p>especially the part of neuroscience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s focused on circuits and systems,</p>
<p>kind of like really mechanism focused,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been this explosion in new technology.</p>
<p>And up until recently,</p>
<p>the experiments that have exploited this technology</p>
<p>have not involved a lot of interesting behavior.</p>
<p>And this is for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>one of which is in order to employ</p>
<p>some of these technologies,</p>
<p>you actually have to, if you&rsquo;re studying a mouse,</p>
<p>you have to head fix the mouse.</p>
<p>In other words, you have to like immobilize the mouse.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been tricky to come up</p>
<p>with ways of eliciting interesting behavior</p>
<p>from a mouse that&rsquo;s restrained in this way,</p>
<p>but people have begun to create</p>
<p>very interesting solutions to this,</p>
<p>like virtual reality environments</p>
<p>where the animal can kind of move a track ball.</p>
<p>And as people have kind of begun to explore</p>
<p>what you can do with these technologies,</p>
<p>I feel like more and more people are asking,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s try to bring behavior into the picture.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to like reintroduce behavior,</p>
<p>which was supposed to be what this whole thing was about.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hoping that those two trends,</p>
<p>the kind of growing interest in behavior</p>
<p>and the widespread interest in what&rsquo;s going on in AI,</p>
<p>will come together to kind of open a new chapter</p>
<p>in neuroscience research where there&rsquo;s a kind of</p>
<p>a rebirth of interest in the structure of behavior</p>
<p>and its underlying substrates,</p>
<p>but that that research is being informed</p>
<p>by computational mechanisms</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re coming to understand in AI.</p>
<p>If we can do that, then we might be taking a step closer</p>
<p>to this utopian future that we were talking about earlier</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s really no distinction</p>
<p>between psychology and neuroscience.</p>
<p>Neuroscience is about studying the mechanisms</p>
<p>that underlie whatever it is the brain is for,</p>
<p>and what is the brain for?</p>
<p>What is the brain for? It&rsquo;s for behavior.</p>
<p>I feel like we could maybe take a step toward that now</p>
<p>if people are motivated in the right way.</p>
<p>You also asked about AI.</p>
<p>So that was a neuroscience question.</p>
<p>You said neuroscience, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And especially places like DeepMind</p>
<p>are interested in both branches.</p>
<p>So what about the engineering of intelligence systems?</p>
<p>I think one of the key challenges</p>
<p>that a lot of people are seeing now in AI</p>
<p>is to build systems that have the kind of flexibility</p>
<p>and the kind of flexibility that humans have in two senses.</p>
<p>One is that humans can be good at many things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just expert at one thing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also flexible in the sense</p>
<p>that they can switch between things very easily</p>
<p>and they can pick up new things very quickly</p>
<p>because they very ably see what a new task has in common</p>
<p>with other things that they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that our AI systems</p>
<p>just blatantly do not have.</p>
<p>There are some people who like to argue</p>
<p>that deep learning and deep RL</p>
<p>are simply wrong for getting that kind of flexibility.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t share that belief,</p>
<p>but the simpler fact of the matter</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re not building things yet</p>
<p>that do have that kind of flexibility.</p>
<p>And I think the attention of a large part</p>
<p>of the AI community is starting to pivot to that question.</p>
<p>How do we get that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna lead to a focus on abstraction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna lead to a focus on</p>
<p>what in psychology we call cognitive control,</p>
<p>which is the ability to switch between tasks,</p>
<p>the ability to quickly put together a program of behavior</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never executed before,</p>
<p>but you know makes sense for a particular set of demands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very closely related to what the prefrontal cortex does</p>
<p>on the neuroscience side.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s gonna be an interesting new chapter.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the reasoning side and cognition side,</p>
<p>but let me ask the over romanticized question.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever engineer an AGI system</p>
<p>that we humans would be able to love</p>
<p>and that would love us back?</p>
<p>So have that level and depth of connection?</p>
<p>I love that question.</p>
<p>And it relates closely to things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot lately,</p>
<p>in the context of this human AI research.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s social psychology research</p>
<p>in particular by Susan Fisk at Princeton</p>
<p>the department where I used to work,</p>
<p>where she dissects human attitudes toward other humans</p>
<p>into a sort of two dimensional scheme.</p>
<p>And one dimension is about ability.</p>
<p>How able, how capable is this other person?</p>
<p>But the other dimension is warmth.</p>
<p>So you can imagine another person who&rsquo;s very skilled</p>
<p>and capable, but is very cold.</p>
<p>And you wouldn&rsquo;t really like highly,</p>
<p>you might have some reservations about that other person.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a kind of reservation</p>
<p>that we might have about another person</p>
<p>who elicits in us or displays a lot of human warmth,</p>
<p>but is not good at getting things done.</p>
<p>We reserve our greatest esteem really</p>
<p>for people who are both highly capable</p>
<p>and also quite warm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the best of the best.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a normative statement I&rsquo;m making.</p>
<p>This is just an empirical statement.</p>
<p>This is what humans seem&hellip;</p>
<p>These are the two dimensions that people seem to kind of like</p>
<p>along which people size other people up.</p>
<p>And in AI research,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who think that humans are</p>
<p>very capable, and in AI research,</p>
<p>we really focus on this capability thing.</p>
<p>We want our agents to be able to do stuff.</p>
<p>This thing can play go at a superhuman level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only one dimension.</p>
<p>What about the other dimension?</p>
<p>What would it mean for an AI system to be warm?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, maybe there are easy solutions here.</p>
<p>Like we can put a face on our AI systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cute, it has big ears.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s probably part of it.</p>
<p>But I think it also has to do with a pattern of behavior.</p>
<p>A pattern of what would it mean for an AI system</p>
<p>to display caring, compassionate behavior</p>
<p>in a way that actually made us feel like it was for real?</p>
<p>That we didn&rsquo;t feel like it was simulated.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t feel like we were being duped.</p>
<p>To me, people talk about the Turing test</p>
<p>or some descendant of it.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s the ultimate Turing test.</p>
<p>Is there an AI system that can not only convince us</p>
<p>that it knows how to reason</p>
<p>and it knows how to interpret language,</p>
<p>but that we&rsquo;re comfortable saying,</p>
<p>yeah, that AI system&rsquo;s a good guy.</p>
<p>On the warmth scale, whatever warmth is,</p>
<p>we kind of intuitively understand it,</p>
<p>but we also wanna be able to, yeah,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand it explicitly enough yet</p>
<p>to be able to engineer it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an open scientific question.</p>
<p>You kind of alluded it several times</p>
<p>in the human AI interaction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question that should be studied</p>
<p>and probably one of the most important questions</p>
<p>as we move to AGI.</p>
<p>We humans are so good at it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that we&rsquo;re born warm.</p>
<p>I suppose some people are warmer than others</p>
<p>given whatever genes they manage to inherit.</p>
<p>But there are also learned skills involved.</p>
<p>There are ways of communicating to other people</p>
<p>that you care, that they matter to you,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re enjoying interacting with them, right?</p>
<p>And we learn these skills from one another.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not out of the question</p>
<p>that we could build engineered systems.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hopeless, as you say,</p>
<p>that we could somehow hand design</p>
<p>these sorts of behaviors.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not out of the question</p>
<p>that we could build systems that kind of,</p>
<p>we instill in them something that sets them out</p>
<p>in the right direction,</p>
<p>so that they end up learning what it is</p>
<p>to interact with humans</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s gratifying to humans.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, if that&rsquo;s not where we&rsquo;re headed,</p>
<p>I want out.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s exciting as a scientific problem,</p>
<p>just as you described.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t see a better way to end it</p>
<p>than talking about warmth and love.</p>
<p>And Matt, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had such a wonderful</p>
<p>conversation where my questions were so bad</p>
<p>and your answers were so beautiful.</p>
<p>So I deeply appreciate it.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking to me.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been very fun.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something I like about kind of thinking</p>
<p>outside the box and like,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s good having an opportunity to do that.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for doing it.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from neurologist V.S. Amarachandran.</p>
<p>How can a three pound mass of jelly</p>
<p>that you can hold in your palm imagine angels,</p>
<p>contemplate the meaning of an infinity</p>
<p>and even question its own place in the cosmos?</p>
<p>Especially awe inspiring is the fact that any single brain,</p>
<p>including yours, is made up of atoms</p>
<p>that were forged in the hearts</p>
<p>of countless far flung stars billions of years ago.</p>
<p>These particles drifted for eons and light years</p>
<p>until gravity and change brought them together here now.</p>
<p>These atoms now form a conglomerate, your brain,</p>
<p>that can not only ponder the very stars they gave at birth,</p>
<p>but can also think about its own ability to think</p>
<p>and wonder about its own ability to wander.</p>
<p>With the arrival of humans, it has been said,</p>
<p>the universe has suddenly become conscious of itself.</p>
<p>This truly is the greatest mystery of all.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
