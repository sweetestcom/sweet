    <p>Hello, dear listener. I&rsquo;m Megan, host of this series. And before we get into the show,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a minute to tell you about our sponsor, FIRE, the Foundation for Individual</p>
<p>Rights and Expression. We live in a moment when free speech, the bedrock of our democracy</p>
<p>and of all free societies, is often viewed as suspect, where many argue that the right</p>
<p>to free speech is too dangerous, and that even listening to ideological opponents is</p>
<p>morally wrong. Many people just don&rsquo;t see a problem with using the law, corporate power,</p>
<p>and even extraordinary social pressure to censor viewpoints they disagree with.</p>
<p>But many of us feel the costs of all this in our everyday lives. We feel it when we</p>
<p>self-censor, afraid to say what we really think, sometimes even in private conversations</p>
<p>with friends or loved ones. We feel it when we opt out of a growing number of public discussions,</p>
<p>afraid of the potential cost to our jobs and even our relationships.</p>
<p>FIRE shares a mission with this show, to remind us why a culture of free speech and open dialogue</p>
<p>matters. And regardless of how loud the calls for censorship are, FIRE&rsquo;s defense of that</p>
<p>culture is unshakable and invaluable. And if you want to remember why we choose freedom,</p>
<p>even for people we strenuously disagree with, you can learn more about FIRE&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>work at thefire.org. And now, on to the show.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve been asking people about, kind of the elephant in the room, so</p>
<p>to speak, is the author, J.K. Rowling. Has your relationship to J.K. Rowling changed</p>
<p>since the early days?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care for J.K. Rowling, unfortunately, because the comments that she&rsquo;s made, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really sad, actually, because she seemed so progressive. The Harry Potter books, like</p>
<p>when we were kids, they seemed progressive.</p>
<p>I think to have the author of these beautiful, loving, accepting stories hurting marginalized</p>
<p>communities, it sucks.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s super transphobic. She&rsquo;s a TERF. She&rsquo;s pretty terrible.</p>
<p>I really wish this was not the hill she chose to die on.</p>
<p>Someone like her, she really is just truly at the heart, bigoted, hiding in this sheep&rsquo;s</p>
<p>costume, pretending that she is an ally.</p>
<p>As I have been working on this series, the accusation that&rsquo;s come up over and over again</p>
<p>is that J.K. Rowling is a transphobe and a bigot.</p>
<p>In fact, last year at LeakyCon, a Harry Potter fan convention, staff took the accusation</p>
<p>so seriously that at one point they announced that attendees should report anyone who was</p>
<p>vocally supporting Rowling in any way, saying, quote,</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance for transphobia and bigotry of any kind.</p>
<p>For many people who support Rowling, they say that these accusations are so off-base</p>
<p>that they can be dismissed out of hand.</p>
<p>But for me, bigotry is not an accusation that I can take lightly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because for a long time, I was a notorious bigot.</p>
<p>The Westboro Baptist Church is known for picketing the funerals of U.S. soldiers and</p>
<p>Marines in protest over what the church sees as the ills of American society.</p>
<p>The Westboro Baptist Church is one of America&rsquo;s most notorious religious aid groups.</p>
<p>From the time I was five years old, I could be found almost every day protesting alongside</p>
<p>my family as proud members of the Westboro Baptist Church.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s wisdom has been crying to this evil nation.</p>
<p>Listen to these lying politicians.</p>
<p>Letting your children be taught it&rsquo;s okay to be gay.</p>
<p>We became infamous for picketing events, like the funerals of soldiers and celebrities,</p>
<p>with signs that said unspeakably cruel things.</p>
<p>God hates fags.</p>
<p>Fags doom nations.</p>
<p>Fags are worthy of death.</p>
<p>Shame! Shame! Shame!</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s hard for some people to believe this, but we truly didn&rsquo;t see these</p>
<p>words as cruel and bigoted.</p>
<p>We thought that what we were doing was right, as you can hear me try to argue here, at one</p>
<p>of our protests 12 years ago.</p>
<p>If you see your neighbor sitting and you don&rsquo;t warn them, what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tacitly enabling and encouraging them on their way to hell.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not loving your neighbor.</p>
<p>So how can you love your neighbor unless you&rsquo;re out here‚Ä¶</p>
<p>So this is about love?</p>
<p>This is about love.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>This is the definition of love.</p>
<p>But people‚Ä¶</p>
<p>They are the definition of a hatred.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>What would you tell them?</p>
<p>We saw ourselves like the biblical prophets, warning people that they needed to obey God,</p>
<p>or else suffer his curses in this life and hell in the next.</p>
<p>And we proudly defended our views, like in this clip of my mom and me on the Tyra Banks</p>
<p>show back when I was 20 years old.</p>
<p>You said, why are you so angry?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re not angry.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to do is get the point across to people who hate our message, who</p>
<p>hate us, who hate God, who hate his judgments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have to get‚Ä¶</p>
<p>A little defiant.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We have to make sure if you&rsquo;re going to hear us that we talk loud enough to be heard</p>
<p>because you cut us off before we say the words because you don&rsquo;t like the words.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everybody we talk to.</p>
<p>From the outside, I understand how this all sounds absurd.</p>
<p>But we actually saw ourselves as living out meaningful values and virtues, like courage.</p>
<p>When we protested, we knew people would hate us for it.</p>
<p>We knew there would be people who would even attack us for it.</p>
<p>So I understand that there&rsquo;s some people that don&rsquo;t like what you have to stand for,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve taken some strong actions about that.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you tell me about that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had so many crimes committed against us, vandalism.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had cars driven at us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been shot at.</p>
<p>And I thought this was the, you know, do-your-own-thing generation.</p>
<p>Tolerance.</p>
<p>Loving.</p>
<p>Where is that?</p>
<p>There were people who bombed my house, set our church on fire, regularly vandalized our</p>
<p>homes, doxxed us, and sent us death threats and rape threats in enormous numbers.</p>
<p>And these attacks only furthered our feelings that we were being persecuted for telling</p>
<p>a hard truth to the world.</p>
<p>To a society that would rather hurl insults at us or violently attack us than listen to</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>After I left the Westboro Baptist Church at age 26, I had to wrestle for a long time with</p>
<p>some truly terrifying questions.</p>
<p>How was it that I could be so certain that I was right and still be so wrong for so long?</p>
<p>How was it that my critics, even the ones who would threaten and attack us, had seen</p>
<p>reality more clearly than I had?</p>
<p>And most terrifying of all, how could I ever trust my own mind again?</p>
<p>When I go back and watch these videos of myself on the Tyra Banks Show or me picketing these</p>
<p>funerals, there&rsquo;s a part of me that wants to say, that was a different person.</p>
<p>But the truth is, I am still that person.</p>
<p>It was me who held those beliefs.</p>
<p>It was me who shouted those cruel words at grieving families.</p>
<p>Ever since I left, I&rsquo;ve been cautious, just so careful when trying to discern what is</p>
<p>true, what is right, what is good.</p>
<p>I try to stay away from certainty, to remember that at any given moment, I am only seeing</p>
<p>a tiny fraction of the world.</p>
<p>I tell myself to embrace humility.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that I do this is by listening, really listening to people and where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming from.</p>
<p>I try to understand them and their experiences and their values and how they&rsquo;ve come to the</p>
<p>positions that they have.</p>
<p>So after speaking with Rowling and trying to really understand her experiences and how</p>
<p>they shaped her views, I left Scotland and did the same thing with many of her critics,</p>
<p>including many who are transgender.</p>
<p>Now of course, trans people, like all people, are not a monolith.</p>
<p>In working on this project, I met trans people who agreed with Rowling and admired her for</p>
<p>speaking up, and others who viewed her as such a menace that they didn&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>on a podcast that included her voice, and many more in between.</p>
<p>But for today, I want to share two conversations with two different critics who not only were</p>
<p>thoughtful in their critique of Rowling, but were also really frank with me about the difficult</p>
<p>experiences that inform their views.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Megan Phelps-Roper, and this is Chapter Six, Natalie and Noah.</p>
<p>So I want to understand your critique of J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s recent comments over the past few</p>
<p>years, but before we do, I would love to know what you think the two of you have in common</p>
<p>on these issues of trans identity, feminism.</p>
<p>I think that we both, in some broad sense, believe in women&rsquo;s liberation and equality.</p>
<p>I think that we both support gay marriage, for example, as the sort of very basic 2010-level activism.</p>
<p>I think that we both recognize that far-right movements like Donald Trump, the politics,</p>
<p>for example, are dangerous.</p>
<p>I think those are kind of the foundations, and then things quickly start to split.</p>
<p>This is Natalie Nguyen, a popular YouTuber better known as ContraPoints.</p>
<p>She makes artful and insightful videos about politics, culture, the internet, and about</p>
<p>being transgender.</p>
<p>A lot of people have the sense that, oh, being trans is this kind of fad.</p>
<p>People go online, and then they get sort of transed by exposure to the social contagion</p>
<p>in these trans communities.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, in my case, I will say that I experienced gender dysphoria and experienced</p>
<p>these kinds of subjective personal things long before that, but the internet makes it</p>
<p>possible to form communities out of people who would otherwise be very geographically</p>
<p>isolated.</p>
<p>I think less than 1% of people are transgender.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I actually met someone who I knew was transgender until I was in my 20s.</p>
<p>And if the only experience that you really have with trans people is whatever media you</p>
<p>saw about trans people from the 90s and 2000s, you&rsquo;ve seen portrayals that are monstrous,</p>
<p>that are alien, that are-</p>
<p>Mocking.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a punchline, or it&rsquo;s like a horror story.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want anything to do with it.</p>
<p>For me to sort of conceptualize myself as, oh, I am a transgender person, I had to actually</p>
<p>see trans people who seemed like people, right?</p>
<p>And YouTube was great for that.</p>
<p>Natalie transitioned in 2017, and she says that YouTube was revelatory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, you know, trans people sharing their transitions, and that was really helpful to</p>
<p>me to recognize, oh, this is something that I want to do.</p>
<p>She says it not only helped her on her path to self-discovery, but it also inspired her</p>
<p>to share aspects of her own transition on her channel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about YouTube that it makes it easy to kind of share private things about</p>
<p>yourself with a big audience because you are talking to a camera alone in your room.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of false intimacy of that.</p>
<p>I feel that there&rsquo;s a lot of things that I said to a YouTube audience that I had never</p>
<p>said to my own friends and family even.</p>
<p>It just felt easier to say to anonymous people on the internet.</p>
<p>And that experience of sharing these intimate parts of her life with so many people online,</p>
<p>she says it was really significant.</p>
<p>The early transition era of my life online was a kind of mix of the rush of this Disney</p>
<p>let it go moment, right, like where you&rsquo;ve broken all the rules of your upbringing and</p>
<p>done something that you&rsquo;re very drastically not supposed to do.</p>
<p>As a person who is assigned male at birth, you&rsquo;re really not supposed to be a woman.</p>
<p>And so if over the course of years, this kind of need, this longing has been building up,</p>
<p>it does feel good at first to finally let it go.</p>
<p>My guest today is self-described YouTuber and ex-philosopher Natalie Wynne, better known</p>
<p>as ContraPoints.</p>
<p>The Verge has called her an elegant, whip-smart middle finger.</p>
<p>Her videos, including the ones following her transition, ended up becoming really popular.</p>
<p>Today we are very lucky to have Natalie Wynne, aka ContraPoints, an ex-philosopher.</p>
<p>Wynne&rsquo;s impact on YouTube culture is so notable that the Library of Congress recently said</p>
<p>it was archiving her entire channel.</p>
<p>She was featured in the New York Times, Vice, NPR, BuzzFeed, and pretty quickly, she became</p>
<p>a very well-known trans person.</p>
<p>I was suddenly very prominent.</p>
<p>I was very visible.</p>
<p>And all this attention, it ultimately led her to getting over 1.5 million subscribers</p>
<p>to her channel.</p>
<p>It also attracted a lot of transphobic hate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doxxed, I&rsquo;ve been swatted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received death threats, mutilation threats, anger, shaming, mockery, any kind of terrible</p>
<p>online behavior you can imagine, I&rsquo;ve been the target of.</p>
<p>I would say that at first it was primarily from anti-trans people, but when you become</p>
<p>sort of a very prominent person from a marginalized community, you sort of inevitably are going</p>
<p>to attract a lot of aggression from that community itself.</p>
<p>In 2019, Natalie posted a tweet indicating that she didn&rsquo;t like how sharing pronouns</p>
<p>and what she called hyper-woke spaces made her feel.</p>
<p>And that, along with the fact that she briefly worked with a controversial trans man, inspired</p>
<p>a really vicious backlash, where she was called a Nazi, a grifter, and a traitor to</p>
<p>the trans community.</p>
<p>People online not only targeted her, but demanded that her friends and people she&rsquo;d worked with</p>
<p>publicly denounce her.</p>
<p>When I was being Twitter mobbed, where the trans community kind of really turned on me,</p>
<p>I remember walking around Baltimore with a hoodie over my head and sunglasses and headphones</p>
<p>in because I was actually almost delusional about how total my ostracism was.</p>
<p>I sort of thought I would be hated on the street, which is crazy in retrospect, but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it felt at the time, it&rsquo;s overwhelming.</p>
<p>And that honestly got worse than the transphobia.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s coming from people that you would see as your allies.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of easier to dismiss hateful bigots because it&rsquo;s like, well, whatever,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re going to hate me regardless.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s from people whose political side that you&rsquo;re supposedly aligned with,</p>
<p>and from people who share your identity, and they&rsquo;re the ones who are really coming at</p>
<p>you the hardest, yeah, it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>Being trans is a pretty socially isolating experience in general, and a lot of trans</p>
<p>people rely pretty heavily on other trans people for support.</p>
<p>So when you are an outcast from the trans community, you feel very alone.</p>
<p>And this experience that Natalie had, which she used to make one of my favorite of her</p>
<p>videos called Cancel Culture, gave her a deeper insight into why it is that speaking about</p>
<p>trans identity and gender issues online so often leads to these vicious public shamings,</p>
<p>even towards allies to the trans rights movement.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of trans people are living with intense shame.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of bitterness because people feel excluded from society, a lot of times</p>
<p>thrown out by their families, humiliated by their families.</p>
<p>And when you have unresolved anger and bitterness and humiliation, that&rsquo;s aggression in search</p>
<p>of a target.</p>
<p>And when you feel downtrodden, and you feel abused, and you feel humiliated, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>vindictive impulse.</p>
<p>You want revenge, not just justice.</p>
<p>But often the person that we take revenge against is not really the person who&rsquo;s responsible,</p>
<p>but rather they are a symbol of all the pain that we feel.</p>
<p>You need a scapegoat.</p>
<p>A scapegoat, yeah.</p>
<p>In January 2021, Natalie released a video essay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve probably heard by now about Joanne Rowling&rsquo;s transphobic tweets, unless you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been living under a rock, in which case, get back under that rock, sweetie.</p>
<p>There is nothing good going on up here.</p>
<p>And in it, she unpacked her thoughts about J.K. Rowling.</p>
<p>Maybe you heard that all Joanne did was say biological sex is real, and now crazy gender</p>
<p>ideologues and trans activists are trying to silence her.</p>
<p>This is cancel culture gone too far.</p>
<p>This is a witch hunt.</p>
<p>Celebrities are under attack.</p>
<p>This is the new Salem.</p>
<p>This is Orwell&rsquo;s nightmare.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons that I really wanted to talk to her was that as a transgender fan</p>
<p>of Harry Potter, who was also a critic of cancel culture, she was critiquing Rowling</p>
<p>from the point of view of someone who has been deeply interested in the very same dynamics</p>
<p>in our society that I had been investigating myself.</p>
<p>This is a painful topic for me all around because as a transgender woman, I am honestly</p>
<p>hurt by a lot of the things Joanne has said in the last year.</p>
<p>But I also know what it&rsquo;s like to be the target of a Twitter mob.</p>
<p>And I realize that to most people, complaining about being canceled, it sounds incredibly</p>
<p>whiny and self-absorbed.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;d especially think that rich and famous people like J.K. Rowling would be above</p>
<p>staying up alone at night reading mean things people say online, but you&rsquo;d think wrong.</p>
<p>And when I see her getting trashed on the TL, there&rsquo;s a traumatized part of me that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unironically triggered by watching people cancel her.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a part of me that wants to join the trashing.</p>
<p>How could you do this to me, Joanne?</p>
<p>I did not come out of the cupboard under the stairs for this.</p>
<p>So in that video, I distinguish between what I&rsquo;m calling sort of two rhetorical styles</p>
<p>of bigotry, which I call direct and indirect.</p>
<p>Direct usually involves framing the target as vermin, invaders, parasites, right?</p>
<p>This sort of dangerous, foreign, infiltrating menace.</p>
<p>The idea that bigotry is simply hate, I call the Westboro Baptist Church theory of bigotry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the idea that bigots are people who outright say, we hate you, God hates you, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all marching around with signs about how much we hate you.</p>
<p>I think in the video, you used my family as an example of direct bigotry.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Westboro Baptist Church, God hates fags, pretty direct, right?</p>
<p>And I think that in some ways, it can render it less dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not insidious.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s as influential.</p>
<p>You know, protesting at funerals, that puts people off, and people don&rsquo;t want to be associated</p>
<p>with that.</p>
<p>It kind of has the opposite of the effect of getting people on their side.</p>
<p>It alienates people and pushes people away.</p>
<p>Yes, but remember that the political talking points that were used 10 years ago, 15 years</p>
<p>ago, 20 years ago, when the Bush era conservatives made opposition to gay marriage a major point</p>
<p>of their platform, it was not about God hates fags.</p>
<p>It was about defending marriage.</p>
<p>We have to protect this institution that&rsquo;s the foundation of the family that&rsquo;s here to</p>
<p>protect children.</p>
<p>There was this kind of fear that if we allow for ambiguity, if we allow for the strict</p>
<p>rule about one man and one woman, and we include two men or two women, then order falls apart.</p>
<p>Slippery slope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slippery slope, and then anything could happen, right?</p>
<p>Indirect bigotry manifests as concern or debate about a host of proxy issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often defensive in tone rather than offensive.</p>
<p>Frequently the claim is that a once needed liberation movement has now gone too far,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s now the activists who are the&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of parallel, right, between where people are afraid that if we allow trans</p>
<p>people to participate in society, then the gender order will collapse, and then it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be anything goes, and men can invade any woman&rsquo;s space, and the protections such as they are</p>
<p>that exist for women will fall apart because of the collapse of the gender order.</p>
<p>When it comes to those ideas of direct and indirect bigotry, when it comes to Rowling</p>
<p>and her views about prisons or childhood transition, is your claim that Rowling is being transphobic</p>
<p>indirectly and maybe even unknowingly?</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;m willing to engage with someone who is skeptical, for example, about is it</p>
<p>fair for trans women to be in sports?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s honestly a question I have myself.</p>
<p>But I feel like that I&rsquo;m not, my willingness to engage with that is going to decrease if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s with someone who I think doesn&rsquo;t really believe in trans acceptance at a much more</p>
<p>fundamental level, which is kind of the feeling that I get from Joe Rowling.</p>
<p>So J.K. Rowling frames her position as, I am just saying the fact that sex is real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hateful to say a fact, why is everyone so mad at me?</p>
<p>A fact can&rsquo;t be bigoted.</p>
<p>And I agree that a fact cannot be bigoted, but a fact on its own doesn&rsquo;t mean very much.</p>
<p>Usually when we discuss facts, we&rsquo;re using those facts to tell a story.</p>
<p>And facts can be used to tell bigoted stories.</p>
<p>You know, suppose someone&hellip;</p>
<p>This was, I think, one of the hardest parts of your critique to consume because of just</p>
<p>my own understanding of how important doubts are and how important open dialogue is, obviously</p>
<p>because of that being the most transformative thing I&rsquo;ve ever experienced in my life.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to ask you to help me understand where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>So one critique you made clear in the video, seeing it as the coded language of indirect</p>
<p>bigotry, is the danger of people who say that they&rsquo;re just asking questions.</p>
<p>And I totally see what you&rsquo;re talking about because there are for sure bad actors and</p>
<p>also just people with really bad ideas and all these people online who make their whole</p>
<p>careers out of using the just asking questions idea as a smokescreen, essentially, right?</p>
<p>But there are a lot of people and I&rsquo;ve met many of them while working on this project</p>
<p>who just genuinely have a lot of questions and sometimes they&rsquo;re afraid to ask them.</p>
<p>And I think asking tough questions and pulling apart arguments is obviously a cornerstone</p>
<p>of reasoning.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually a thing that you do so well on your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>So I just wonder, like, why is it that you see Rowling and other people in this debate?</p>
<p>Why do you see that as if they&rsquo;re just like clearly trying to disguise bad intentions?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily see it as just trying to disguise bad intentions.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m less concerned with the intentions than I am with the consequences.</p>
<p>And when you have someone who is as influential as J.K. Rowling posing ignorant loaded questions</p>
<p>on Twitter, like this is not the acceptable forum for that level of discourse, right?</p>
<p>So okay, yes, there&rsquo;s very complicated questions that are legitimate to be asked.</p>
<p>But I feel like, I don&rsquo;t know, if you&rsquo;re going to be someone with a huge platform who wants</p>
<p>to like pose these questions, you kind of have to be responsible for the way that you</p>
<p>go about doing that.</p>
<p>If you do it in a way that&rsquo;s harmful to trans people, as I consider it beyond any question</p>
<p>that the way J.K. Rowling has done it has been harmful, then I think it&rsquo;s valid for</p>
<p>people to be upset with you and to criticize that.</p>
<p>Is it that you believe that it&rsquo;s dangerous to ask the questions or just that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust that she&rsquo;s actually engaging in good faith?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primarily that I don&rsquo;t trust that she&rsquo;s engaging in good faith.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really gotten the impression that she wants to know more about the experiences</p>
<p>of trans people from the way that these questions are posed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about, isn&rsquo;t this dangerous to all of the rest of us, right?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t these people posing a threat to us?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this dangerous to children?</p>
<p>Like I see that as a very loaded question.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s not the text, but the subtext.</p>
<p>In other words.</p>
<p>Yeah, completely.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s any validity to the concerns that she&rsquo;s raised about the possibility of</p>
<p>rushed care?</p>
<p>Trans care is a small minority of trans people who detransition.</p>
<p>And many of these people do kind of cite that trans identity for them was some kind of shelter</p>
<p>from other issues going on in their life.</p>
<p>But the idea that trans care is rushed is something that probably is pretty grating</p>
<p>to most trans people to hear.</p>
<p>Because most trans people have this experience of sometimes years-long waiting lists to get</p>
<p>care, of having to jump through all these hoops, of having to answer sort of invasive</p>
<p>questions about why you&rsquo;re transitioning and so on, having to really fight, in other words,</p>
<p>for care.</p>
<p>So the idea that, oh, we&rsquo;re just throwing any teenager who plays with the wrong type</p>
<p>of toys into the transition pipeline, that&rsquo;s just not happening.</p>
<p>Probably some people are getting sloppy care.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s generally a problem with healthcare in the US and the UK.</p>
<p>The medical infrastructure is actually not that great.</p>
<p>But I feel that this is being presented as a bigger problem than it, in fact, is.</p>
<p>Which is not to minimize that, obviously, it&rsquo;s very painful if you transition and then</p>
<p>realize that you&rsquo;ve made a mistake.</p>
<p>But it just doesn&rsquo;t happen that often.</p>
<p>So is your issue on the possibility of trans children transitioning being rushed in some</p>
<p>cases?</p>
<p>Is that you and Rowling don&rsquo;t necessarily have a totally different point of view, but</p>
<p>more about what she&rsquo;s choosing to focus on?</p>
<p>Well, no one wants to rush teenagers into transitioning if that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be the best outcome for them, right?</p>
<p>I just feel that a lot of the kind of moral panic over this is overstated.</p>
<p>It sounds like you think that she&rsquo;s exaggerating the risks and that adds to a climate of fear</p>
<p>around something that society still seems hesitant to embrace.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When I was talking to Natalie about this idea of exaggerating real risks in a way that might</p>
<p>distort them, I asked her if she felt the same way about Rowling&rsquo;s concerns around</p>
<p>self-ID and gender recognition certificates and what they could mean for single-sex bases.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, she says, you know, there&rsquo;s this fear, oh, men are just going</p>
<p>to be able to come barging into bathrooms with those certificates.</p>
<p>Do you need a certificate to enter a bathroom now?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how bathrooms work.</p>
<p>To me, this is a sort of imagined fear-generated scenario that doesn&rsquo;t really line up with</p>
<p>the actual experience of people in bathrooms, right?</p>
<p>People identify your gender based on how you look.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been using women&rsquo;s bathrooms for five years.</p>
<p>No one has ever approached me about it, right?</p>
<p>So generating a paranoia about men in women&rsquo;s bathrooms, it&rsquo;s sort of this purely imaginative</p>
<p>scenario where, you know, there&rsquo;s going to be perverts in bathrooms who will face no</p>
<p>consequences because of like, I don&rsquo;t know, sexual assault is still illegal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really clear to me how much protection a certificate gives someone.</p>
<p>When you talk about the danger of the like asking questions idea or seeing it as indirect</p>
<p>bigotry, an interesting aspect of this part of it is that, you know, in the first chapter</p>
<p>of the first Harry Potter book, Uncle Vernon keeps yelling at Harry over and over again,</p>
<p>stop asking questions.</p>
<p>And when I asked Rowling about why she started the book this way, she said that from the</p>
<p>start, the book was anti-authoritarian.</p>
<p>And that, she understood, starts when people are discouraged from voicing their doubts.</p>
<p>And you are someone who&rsquo;s been vocal about the way that the internet has become a place</p>
<p>where authoritarian behavior is on the rise.</p>
<p>Do you see what she&rsquo;s worried about?</p>
<p>I think that to be authoritarian, you have to be able to leverage authority and trans</p>
<p>people are in a weak position, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see that like this trans big brother that you can&rsquo;t question, like, like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very melodramatic and self-pitying way of framing this, that I understand why to people</p>
<p>it feels like, oh, the mob is attacking me.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is that, that the mob is, is, it can be vicious and unreasonable and unsympathetic and unnuanced.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But to me, that&rsquo;s fundamentally different from big brother.</p>
<p>In her JK Rowling video, Natalie talks about the way that some trans people wield power</p>
<p>online, including why that power is sometimes wielded so fiercely.</p>
<p>A lot of extremely online trans people really don&rsquo;t have a strong sense of conviction and</p>
<p>their own identity, which is why they need constant external validation to prop them</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>They need to constantly be told that they&rsquo;re valid, that they really are the gender that</p>
<p>they say they are.</p>
<p>And if someone even obliquely threatens or questions their fragile self-concept, they</p>
<p>lash out.</p>
<p>And for some of those trans people, canceling celebrities on Twitter is the one kind of</p>
<p>power they have.</p>
<p>You know, have people been abusive, disproportionate, out of line in reacting against JK Rowling?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Do I endorse people saying like violent or abusive, cruel things?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been the target of a lot of that myself, but I also kind of understand what people</p>
<p>are mad about.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I definitely hear you.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m thinking back, you know, of course I was in Westboro when the discussion about</p>
<p>same-sex&hellip;</p>
<p>At the end of our conversation, I told Natalie a bit more about my own story, how it was</p>
<p>people willing to engage with me even when I was saying really cruel things that was</p>
<p>so transformative, and how I wonder, as uncomfortable as those conversations can be, if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really the best path to progress that we have.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, when it comes to things like opposition to same-sex marriage, so many</p>
<p>people have been persuaded and now support it.</p>
<p>And I asked her whether one of the reasons she was willing to speak publicly about these</p>
<p>issues was because in a pluralistic society, actually having the conversation is how effective</p>
<p>change is made.</p>
<p>They serve a purpose that is ultimately good, even though we wish there was a more ideal</p>
<p>route.</p>
<p>Well, I think that realistically, that is how acceptance&hellip;</p>
<p>That is the trajectory.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not under any illusions about what it&rsquo;s going to take for trans people to be</p>
<p>accepted.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;re probably 20 years away.</p>
<p>And I think that what it is going to take is people simply habituating to a world that</p>
<p>includes trans people.</p>
<p>And my guess is that once that happens, once that habituation happens, it becomes much</p>
<p>less of this hypothetical, new, scary, invasive thing, and it becomes something that&rsquo;s sort</p>
<p>of accepted in life.</p>
<p>And that will happen with trans people.</p>
<p>Trans people are not going anywhere.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be able to get rid of us.</p>
<p>I think that once this becomes normal, it will become, to most people, a bit more of</p>
<p>an embarrassment that they behaved in this way during these years.</p>
<p>And I certainly do believe in having the conversation.</p>
<p>I mean, if I consider myself, I think I&rsquo;m having the conversation right now.</p>
<p>And thank you for that.</p>
<p>Again, I just want you to know how much I appreciate that because&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to have the conversation because I feel that I often have no choice.</p>
<p>But I also hope that people sort of understand the reason why a lot of trans people might</p>
<p>not be super eager to politely answer every question they have about, isn&rsquo;t giving you</p>
<p>healthcare dangerous for children?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t allowing you into bathrooms going to leave women vulnerable to rape?</p>
<p>It takes patience to answer these questions and to not feel insulted or attacked.</p>
<p>I am willing to do it to a certain extent because I know that I have to, right?</p>
<p>Because unfortunately, the progress of trans people is in its still fairly early stages.</p>
<p>And I hope you understand how deeply I know this in my bones.</p>
<p>Because when I think about the people who engaged me on Twitter back in the day, the</p>
<p>ones who were patient and showed me grace when I displayed the kind of absolutely horrible,</p>
<p>cruel behavior that I did, it honestly shocks me.</p>
<p>So anyway, I completely understand that and I appreciate it.</p>
<p>I do sometimes worry that I&rsquo;m like somewhat losing my ability to be, to have that kind</p>
<p>of like tranquil, forgiving quality because you can get worn down doing this for too long.</p>
<p>Sometimes I worry that I&rsquo;m, I guess, I sort of usually avoid these conversations lately</p>
<p>because I honestly kind of have gotten a bit burnt out on it, but I do still feel this</p>
<p>kind of, you know, why am I here?</p>
<p>I think J.K. Rowling, like, you know, she, I read all those books when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a lingering emotional, like there&rsquo;s a part of me that actually still cares.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a part of me that still cares what she thinks, you know?</p>
<p>What would you want to say to J.K. Rowling?</p>
<p>I just kind of hope she could try to see why so many trans people are angry and hurt by</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>And I realize that that means asking for a second to like leave her own position of feeling</p>
<p>hurt and threatened.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what she says that she wants to do.</p>
<p>And to me, what doing that would look like would be understanding why people who are</p>
<p>sort of being constantly rejected and humiliated by our families, by the government, who are</p>
<p>losing our access to healthcare or being threatened with it, who are kind of just like fighting</p>
<p>for a basic ability to participate in society, like why we might feel hurt and betrayed by</p>
<p>her sort of contributing to like fear about us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I guess what I would say.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>

<p>I am a person who can be pretty obsessive about my health.</p>
<p>My routine typically includes things like 10,000 steps a day and smoothies and strength</p>
<p>workouts.</p>
<p>And yes, I am even one of those people who forces myself to take cold showers even in</p>
<p>the winter.</p>
<p>But a lot of that flew out the window when I had a baby six months ago.</p>
<p>And I especially struggled to make sure that I was getting good nutrition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was so excited to add AG-1 from Athletic Greens to my routine.</p>
<p>I love that I can get 75 vitamins, minerals, and nutrients from whole food sources just</p>
<p>by adding a scoop of AG-1 to my smoothie in the morning or mixing it with a glass of cold</p>
<p>water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really simple habit to get into, and it&rsquo;s so much easier than swallowing</p>
<p>a bunch of pills, which is what I did for years and came to completely dread.</p>
<p>AG-1 is different, and it makes me feel grateful that even during the most chaotic times in</p>
<p>my life, I can do this small, powerful thing to help me cover my nutritional bases every</p>
<p>day.</p>

<p>Happy birthday.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>A while back, our team got an email from a father in California.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d written to say that he was confused and upset about JK Rowling and why she was</p>
<p>speaking out about young people medically transitioning.</p>
<p>He said that if we wanted to understand what that experience is like, we should talk to</p>
<p>his teenage kid, Noah, who is trans.</p>
<p>And when we sat down for the interview, I was surprised to hear that Noah already knew</p>
<p>who I was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to meet you because part of my whole gender journey was, you know, finding</p>
<p>resources on the Internet.</p>
<p>And I watched every TED Talk about every remotely queer subject that there was.</p>
<p>So I saw yours more than once.</p>
<p>On YouTube, he&rsquo;d seen a TED Talk I gave back in 2017.</p>
<p>In my home, life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil.</p>
<p>The good was my church and its members, and the evil was everyone else.</p>
<p>Explaining how and why I&rsquo;d left the Westboro Baptist Church.</p>
<p>My friends on Twitter didn&rsquo;t abandon their beliefs or their principles, only their scorn.</p>
<p>They channeled their infinitely justifiable offense and came to me with pointed questions</p>
<p>tempered with kindness and humor.</p>
<p>They approached me as a human being.</p>
<p>I watched it, and I appreciate that it was sort of a resource for developing critical thinking.</p>
<p>I guess I like to think of myself as someone who tries my hardest to second-guess myself</p>
<p>in a positive way, and I like to think maybe you helped with that.</p>
<p>Once I saw that we were not the ultimate arbiters of divine truth, but flawed human beings,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>So, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Oh man, nice to meet you too. That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It felt serendipitous to meet Noah because he not only shares my commitment to investigating our beliefs,</p>
<p>but also he is in many ways the embodiment of one of Rowling&rsquo;s concerns.</p>
<p>A young person, born female, who showed no signs of gender dysphoria growing up,</p>
<p>but was overwhelmed with dysphoria at puberty, and within a few years had medically transitioned,</p>
<p>including getting surgery as a minor.</p>
<p>Can you tell me how long have you gone by Noah?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone by Noah since the summer of 2018.</p>
<p>I tried out the name Blake for like a month, but I&rsquo;ve been going by a name that was not the one</p>
<p>I was assigned at birth since March of 2018.</p>
<p>March of 2018.</p>
<p>And so, how old were you at that point then?</p>
<p>I think I was 13.</p>
<p>And how do you describe yourself and your gender?</p>
<p>I think the simplest way to describe myself is trans male, a trans masculine person,</p>
<p>which is a term for anyone whose gender transition has led them to a more masculine place than when they started.</p>
<p>And when did that start for you? When did you start to feel different?</p>
<p>My therapist has said that it&rsquo;s very common for trans people to only come to the realization that they&rsquo;re trans in puberty,</p>
<p>which was the case for me.</p>
<p>For a lot of my childhood, it just didn&rsquo;t come up, which my parents had a really hard time with,</p>
<p>because the portrayal of transgender people, the extent of what they had encountered,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s like a four-year-old who is a girl and then says,</p>
<p>I want to play with trucks, I hate trusses, I won&rsquo;t wear one, etc.</p>
<p>And then they get older, and they have the words to articulate their feelings,</p>
<p>and everyone realizes, oh, you were transgender, and we all knew all along, and nobody&rsquo;s caught off guard.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t my story.</p>
<p>I have feminine interests, and I had feminine interests growing up,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t until I was 10 or 11 that I started being uncomfortable with my body.</p>
<p>When I started developing a more feminine body, I knew I was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And then when I was in middle school, I started discovering portions of the Internet</p>
<p>where people would talk about queer identity issues.</p>
<p>What specifically were you looking at?</p>
<p>My sort of gateway was BuzzFeed, because they have a ton of viral content.</p>
<p>Dear BuzzFeed, when I was four, I just thought I was like any other boy.</p>
<p>As I grew a little older, I started realizing I was different.</p>
<p>Jamie Dodger, whose video, it was titled Dear BuzzFeed or something similar.</p>
<p>I tried to fit in as female during my early teens.</p>
<p>I could never find clothes I liked, felt uncomfortable in anything I wore, and disliked my hair being long.</p>
<p>I must have watched that 20 times.</p>
<p>The day I started testosterone was incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>My dad picked up my prescription for me, and it was sitting waiting for me when I got home from college.</p>
<p>From BuzzFeed, I started doing my own research.</p>
<p>When I was 11, I used to just re-watch videos over and over of trans men documenting their journeys online.</p>
<p>And even before I understood why I was fascinated with that content,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just all I would do is just re-watch videos like that.</p>
<p>Hey, what&rsquo;s up, everybody? Welcome back to my channel.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to be giving y&rsquo;all some of my most effective dysphoria hacks, tips to get over dysphoria.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to recommend that everybody document their transition.</p>
<p>Having before pictures and videos and recordings of your voice that you can look back on later in your transition</p>
<p>will end up being so meaningful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made a big difference in my&hellip;</p>
<p>A lot of my exploration, none of it was, you should be trans.</p>
<p>It was just, this is my journey.</p>
<p>I really liked it when people called me a tomboy.</p>
<p>I liked it when I fit in with the boys more than the girls around me.</p>
<p>This is what I want to tell the world about my journey and about the community at large.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to be going over my one-month post-op top surgery, kind of a general overview.</p>
<p>And I took all of that information in and I came to the conclusion,</p>
<p>I should allow myself to explore who I am and try and use that as an avenue to find happiness.</p>
<p>And something that had a really, really significant impact on me</p>
<p>was people who portrayed a trans body in whatever forms it came in as beautiful or normal,</p>
<p>which taught me that there is hope for me to be happy</p>
<p>and that I can allow myself to feel joy or find some joy in how I look.</p>
<p>And were you seeing a therapist or a counselor at that time?</p>
<p>Like when all of this started?</p>
<p>I had a lot of mental issues.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s not the most delicate way to say that,</p>
<p>but I was dealing with a lot of mental struggles once puberty began.</p>
<p>You mean aside from your issues with gender?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I couldn&rsquo;t really identify that I had issues with gender.</p>
<p>I just had all of these abstract feelings that didn&rsquo;t coalesce into gender dysphoria</p>
<p>until I understood what that term meant fully, which was later on in my life.</p>
<p>And so I was dealing with very severe anxiety disorder,</p>
<p>a depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>and attention deficit hyperactive disorder.</p>
<p>And so my mom got me a therapist who I&rsquo;ve been with ever since.</p>
<p>And when she picked out that therapist,</p>
<p>she picked out someone who specialized in anxiety and gender issues in adolescence,</p>
<p>which I find interesting to look back on.</p>
<p>And I had a psychiatrist as well.</p>
<p>And around eighth grade, I went into this really severe depressive episode,</p>
<p>and I ended up telling my psychiatrist that I was debating suicide.</p>
<p>And so everyone decided that we were going to have to keep an eye on me.</p>
<p>And so I just kept going to therapy.</p>
<p>And like I said, the core issue, which we couldn&rsquo;t figure out, was never resolved.</p>
<p>And I believe within a year, I joined a support group for transgender youths.</p>
<p>And my therapist helped me identify that a lot of what I had been expressing to her</p>
<p>for a really long time could be identified as feelings of gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>And after at least a year and a half or two years of those issues being present,</p>
<p>she referred me to a gender clinician.</p>
<p>And talking to my parents was the first big step that was taken.</p>
<p>We identified what I wanted from the gender clinic,</p>
<p>which was to go on testosterone and to get top surgery,</p>
<p>but that couldn&rsquo;t happen partially because I was too young.</p>
<p>I believe the limit was 16 for surgery, and they just weren&rsquo;t comfortable at 14.</p>
<p>So our task that we got was for me to discuss my gender with my parents.</p>
<p>And so once or twice a week for a long time, at least a year,</p>
<p>my parents would sit down with me, and we would have a long talk about how I was feeling</p>
<p>because it had to become very clear that not only was my gender dysphoria</p>
<p>spawning all of the other mental issues I was having,</p>
<p>but that the solution was medical intervention,</p>
<p>and that was seemingly the only thing that could help me</p>
<p>because we had tried pretty much every other option at that point.</p>
<p>And how did your parents react when you first told them that you wanted to transition?</p>
<p>They had both been watching me struggle for a really long time,</p>
<p>and my dad in particular just really wanted to help me improve</p>
<p>and help me do better and help me become healthy.</p>
<p>But it was very intense for them. It was very intimidating.</p>
<p>They were pretty caught off guard.</p>
<p>They raised me. There wasn&rsquo;t any very intense masculine leanings.</p>
<p>And when I brought it up, they were really surprised.</p>
<p>So it took a lot for them to even be on board with me not being a girl,</p>
<p>and I think they&rsquo;re still struggling with that to an extent which is understandable.</p>
<p>And I can empathize with where they&rsquo;re coming from on that, of course,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done my best to empathize with every possible point of view that this situation involves.</p>
<p>They did not really want me medically transitioning.</p>
<p>It took a very long time, and it took like three or four or maybe even five medical professionals</p>
<p>saying to them, we have been observing your child for a long time,</p>
<p>and we believe this is the right step for them, for my parents to be on board.</p>
<p>And can you talk about what specifically made them uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Like what were their concerns about ‚Äì I mean, it sounds like you&rsquo;re saying in part</p>
<p>that they just couldn&rsquo;t envision you as anything other than a girl,</p>
<p>but were there other concerns that they had that they expressed to you?</p>
<p>I think a lot of it was that they understandably had this ‚Äì</p>
<p>certain ideas in their head of who I was going to become,</p>
<p>things like one day your dad will walk you down the aisle towards a bride or a groom.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t matter to them as much, but they pictured me in a gown,</p>
<p>and they pictured being in the operating room as I gave birth to my child,</p>
<p>and they had all these specific ideas and dreams and goals and hopes for me.</p>
<p>So a lot of it was their expectations for me and how they saw me developing,</p>
<p>but I would argue the majority of their concern was, to quote Abigail Schreier,</p>
<p>that I was doing irreversible damage to myself, that I was making a choice</p>
<p>that was incredibly drastic, that I could not make because I was a minor,</p>
<p>and that I would regret and have to reverse later in my life.</p>
<p>All of which are very, very valid concerns, and I took them all very seriously,</p>
<p>as did all the other adults and medical professionals in that environment.</p>
<p>And another issue that was raised by my dad was he has transgender friends,</p>
<p>and he has encountered a lot of transgender people who don&rsquo;t pass</p>
<p>or who it&rsquo;s clear that they&rsquo;re transgender, and he felt that I would be discriminated against</p>
<p>or I would never fit into the beauty standard, or that I would ‚Äì</p>
<p>both my parents expressed concern that I would have a harder time living my life</p>
<p>if I was a transgender person, in terms of finding love, getting married,</p>
<p>and having children, and how people would react to me,</p>
<p>and feeling like an outsider my entire life.</p>
<p>They had a lot of concerns with how my quality of life would decrease,</p>
<p>even if I made the right choice, by transitioning.</p>
<p>So even with all of your parents&rsquo; concerns, what made you, and eventually them,</p>
<p>feel safe in moving forward with medical transition?</p>
<p>To me, what&rsquo;s important is that I had a team of medical professionals who had done this</p>
<p>and who could help me make the right decision and help guide me.</p>
<p>And I felt convicted of things in my life, but I&rsquo;ve never felt as convicted as I have</p>
<p>about my identity in terms of knowing what would make me more comfortable,</p>
<p>which was medical intervention.</p>
<p>And as convicted as I was about that, which was 100%,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would have let myself make that decision</p>
<p>had I not had help from a support network who did not just blindly say yes</p>
<p>to everything I was telling them, who asked me more questions,</p>
<p>who guided me in a way that wasn&rsquo;t just,</p>
<p>everything sounds right, you&rsquo;ve checked off all the boxes,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s move you to the next stage of your transition.</p>
<p>It was a very thoughtful, serious process, as I believe it should be for everybody.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re doing all that research and thinking things through,</p>
<p>did you read or see stories about detransitioners during that time?</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely did.</p>
<p>I think it was a concern for me in some ways.</p>
<p>It was a concern for me because the idea of detransitioning was scary to me</p>
<p>because I know I feel this way now.</p>
<p>If other people have also felt this way and transitioned,</p>
<p>they must have just woken up one day and felt a completely different way.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to dismiss detransition as an issue</p>
<p>because not exploring it is risky and it&rsquo;s important to talk about</p>
<p>because just as much as I feel transition is liberating,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it to become limiting for anybody.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want someone to do it who won&rsquo;t really benefit from it.</p>
<p>Exactly. I want everyone who will benefit from it to do it,</p>
<p>everyone who won&rsquo;t to not, which is a hot take, I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a revolutionary in that way.</p>
<p>Thank you for laughing at that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, though.</p>
<p>This topic obviously elicits a lot of really strong feelings</p>
<p>and people have sometimes a really hard time talking about it with nuance</p>
<p>because the stakes feel extremely high.</p>
<p>Yeah, I completely agree.</p>
<p>And I think one of the reasons I&rsquo;m excited to be talking about this</p>
<p>is I think it&rsquo;s so important to emphasize that everybody comes into this issue</p>
<p>with a core belief that people should be happy.</p>
<p>And a lot of the people who are anti-trans, not all of them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a lot of them are grifting, but a lot of them come at it</p>
<p>from the perspective of not wanting other people to make an irreversible mistake</p>
<p>and do irreversible damage.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really important to note that I take all that really seriously</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m coming from the exact same place of wanting to mitigate irreversible damage.</p>
<p>Part of what J.K. Rowling says in her essay,</p>
<p>she lists all these things that are common among people my age</p>
<p>who transition from female to male, and it&rsquo;s like anxiety, dissociation,</p>
<p>all of these different things that are very common in transgender people.</p>
<p>But she is interpreting those real facts as these children are misinterpreting</p>
<p>their difficult feelings as being on account of gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s crucial is that I was not the only person</p>
<p>making these decisions for myself.</p>
<p>I expressed how I was feeling to adults and to professionals</p>
<p>and they came to medical conclusions the same way you would</p>
<p>about undergoing any sort of medical procedure.</p>
<p>Okay, so a lot of people like to break with social norms,</p>
<p>like women who shave their heads or guys who wear eyeliner.</p>
<p>And I just want to understand what was different about what you were experiencing?</p>
<p>Can you talk about that a little bit more?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question. That&rsquo;s a question my parents had too.</p>
<p>For me, what was different between my experience</p>
<p>and maybe just a masculine woman&rsquo;s experience is that</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel I could continue living happily or living sustainably at all</p>
<p>unless I was living the life of a man as opposed to a masculine person.</p>
<p>When I was being perceived as a woman, it was incredibly distressing to me.</p>
<p>It just became incredibly important and a sort of psychological need</p>
<p>that I be seen and referred to and live my life the way that a man would.</p>
<p>It was also so severe for me that medical intervention</p>
<p>had to be taken for my own well-being.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Okay, so I just want to stick here for one more minute</p>
<p>because I really want to understand your experience</p>
<p>and to help other people understand it.</p>
<p>And I think one way to do that is to compare it to an experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I think pretty common and then to see where yours diverges from that.</p>
<p>So I remember being seven years old and there was a girl in my class</p>
<p>who was experiencing what I now know is called precocious puberty.</p>
<p>So she started her period and I didn&rsquo;t know what that meant.</p>
<p>So I went home and asked my mom and she pulls out this book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d seen the book before.</p>
<p>She starts showing me illustrations of uteruses and ovaries and fallopian tubes.</p>
<p>And I last about 90 seconds before I was just so disgusted</p>
<p>that I was like, please, just put it away.</p>
<p>And she laughed at me and kind of we went on.</p>
<p>But as a kid, I just remember being angry and offended and upset</p>
<p>when I found out that childbirth was painful.</p>
<p>I was disgusted and embarrassed by bras and breasts and periods</p>
<p>and basically anything that distinguished me from boys.</p>
<p>It just seemed to me that boys had it easy</p>
<p>and I just wanted nothing to do with femaleness.</p>
<p>And I guess my question is, is that disgust and discomfort that I felt,</p>
<p>that kind of alienation from my body and from the role that I understood</p>
<p>I was supposed to occupy in life,</p>
<p>is that similar to what you felt?</p>
<p>And do you think that maybe the magnitude of it was just more extreme in your case?</p>
<p>Or what do you think are the biggest differences</p>
<p>between what I described and what you went through?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think my experience was different in ways that I hadn&rsquo;t thought about</p>
<p>because I hadn&rsquo;t had someone express to me that question formatted that way.</p>
<p>But I think for me, I sort of was excited for puberty</p>
<p>and then I thought it would be an escape where I would finally get to a place</p>
<p>where I was comfortable and I could fit into a role.</p>
<p>I always didn&rsquo;t really feel like I fit in places</p>
<p>and so I thought, well, puberty, I can&rsquo;t wait to turn into a woman.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to grow breasts and begin my period and everything</p>
<p>because then I&rsquo;ll finally feel like I am belonging to the female gender</p>
<p>for the first time and then everything will click into place.</p>
<p>And I was really excited and then things started developing</p>
<p>and I remember telling my mom, I don&rsquo;t like it but I&rsquo;m sure I will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just because I don&rsquo;t like that they&rsquo;re small.</p>
<p>When my breasts are bigger, then I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>
<p>And then they got bigger and I was less happy.</p>
<p>And so I guess I really was looking forward to puberty</p>
<p>because I thought it would be a gateway to feeling acceptance</p>
<p>and finally feeling at home in my body.</p>
<p>And then the opposite happened.</p>
<p>And part of me leaned in and part of me was leaning out</p>
<p>and it took a lot of daily discomfort</p>
<p>and a certain amount of self-loathing</p>
<p>to get to a place where I understood</p>
<p>that what I wanted was to be a masculine person</p>
<p>and then I think it didn&rsquo;t click until I experimented with masculinity.</p>
<p>At the start of my gender journey, you could say,</p>
<p>when I was just using different pronouns and a different name,</p>
<p>it made a huge impact to how I felt</p>
<p>and I was finally feeling more like myself.</p>
<p>So I guess the difference between me</p>
<p>and maybe another person going through feminine puberty</p>
<p>who was leaning in a masculine direction</p>
<p>is that I leaned so far into that masculine direction</p>
<p>and only found that I was finally happy and secure</p>
<p>once I had gone all the way from female to male.</p>
<p>And any in-between zone, any masculine womanhood</p>
<p>or anything like that was unsatisfying and I was still unhappy.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>Can I ask, how old were you when you got top surgery?</p>
<p>I got top surgery three months ago tomorrow.</p>
<p>And so you were 16?</p>
<p>I was.</p>
<p>And what do you think would have happened</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d had to wait until you were at least 18</p>
<p>to make these decisions?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about that a lot.</p>
<p>And I think if I hadn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and again, this is very severe language,</p>
<p>if I hadn&rsquo;t killed myself, I would have at least tried.</p>
<p>And I have dealt with self-harm and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I was dealing with emotional problems,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m dealing with a lot of them now.</p>
<p>Transitioning didn&rsquo;t cure any of my disorders,</p>
<p>but it made everything so much easier.</p>
<p>And it was just sort of this pit</p>
<p>that dragged me down into a place</p>
<p>where I felt so hopeless and so miserable.</p>
<p>And part of my journey with self-mutilation</p>
<p>was that I hated my body and I wanted to punish my body</p>
<p>because it was causing me so much pain</p>
<p>and I wanted to crawl out of my skin,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And it was at times genuinely agonizing</p>
<p>and it was difficult having to square my reality</p>
<p>of living what was sometimes an agonizing life experience</p>
<p>with also understanding that I am 16, 15, 14</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m going through all this</p>
<p>and so many other teenagers have felt miserable</p>
<p>and then grown up and they&rsquo;ve been fine.</p>
<p>But for me, it was just a deep need</p>
<p>that I just felt so miserable in my body</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t bear to be alive in the body I was in.</p>
<p>I personally believe that I, if I had had to wait longer,</p>
<p>would have attempted suicide and I might have been successful.</p>
<p>And I was experiencing all that</p>
<p>while I had friends who were calling me the right name.</p>
<p>And it was sort of a constant state of crisis</p>
<p>and that was sort of the hardest part</p>
<p>was I understood the reality</p>
<p>and I understood that it was not,</p>
<p>as much as I know what I&rsquo;m feeling is real,</p>
<p>I also know I can&rsquo;t expect my parents to hear that</p>
<p>and go, great, let&rsquo;s just have you undergo surgery right away.</p>
<p>It had to be a long process</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you do everything safely</p>
<p>but it was agonizing to get to that point.</p>
<p>And so I think there needs to be a balance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that a teenager,</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of teenagers</p>
<p>who attempt suicide or commit suicide</p>
<p>who maybe think that transitioning</p>
<p>is the answer for them and it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And if they had said to their parents,</p>
<p>I have to transition or I&rsquo;ll commit suicide,</p>
<p>they might have made the wrong decision.</p>
<p>But for me, it was the right decision</p>
<p>and I knew that and doctors knew that</p>
<p>and it was what I needed to feel like</p>
<p>I could stand to wake up in the mornings.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for sharing that with me.</p>
<p>Before you go, I did want to make sure to ask you</p>
<p>about J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter</p>
<p>and how you feel about all of that now.</p>
<p>Let me share with you some of my accolades.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read the books four times.</p>
<p>I know what house I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>I know what wand I have.</p>
<p>I brought my Harry Potter wand</p>
<p>that I made out of hot glue and a chopstick</p>
<p>to prove that I have stake in this conversation.</p>
<p>I made that when I was like seven.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Gryffindor.</p>
<p>I have a Gryffindor letterman&rsquo;s jacket in my closet</p>
<p>that I wore even way past when it was remotely cool</p>
<p>or interesting for me to do that.</p>
<p>I have my golden snitch right here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such a big Harry Potter fan</p>
<p>or I was such a big Harry Potter fan</p>
<p>especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even state how important it was to me.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography</p>
<p>from my third grade classroom</p>
<p>and I kept it for a long time</p>
<p>because I just loved reading it</p>
<p>because I just admired her so much</p>
<p>and some part of her has shaped who I am</p>
<p>and gotten me through so much</p>
<p>and her work is so important to me</p>
<p>now in so many ways</p>
<p>and she just really taught me to believe in beauty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really going on about J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter</p>
<p>but it just dominated my life for a really long time.</p>
<p>And so what do you think now about J.K. Rowling?</p>
<p>Like how do you understand the things</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s been saying about sex and gender</p>
<p>and I guess where do you think you agree and disagree?</p>
<p>Do you think?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very, very good question.</p>
<p>I am almost positive</p>
<p>and maybe this is a childlike thing for me to say</p>
<p>that if I sat down with J.K. Rowling</p>
<p>we would have a great time talking</p>
<p>and we would get along</p>
<p>and she would say things that I would cherish</p>
<p>for the rest of my life</p>
<p>coming from my childhood hero</p>
<p>who was one of the youngest billionaires of all time</p>
<p>and then lost that title</p>
<p>because she gave so much of it away.</p>
<p>God, I&rsquo;ve adored her for so much of my life</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure I would cry if I ever met her</p>
<p>and I believe she believes a lot of the same things that I do</p>
<p>and I think a lot of what the issue has become</p>
<p>is that a lot of what she has said</p>
<p>is not bigotry in the way that bigotry is portrayed sometimes</p>
<p>in that to my knowledge</p>
<p>I strongly believe she has never said anything like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m better than trans people</p>
<p>or trans people are this negative thing, this negative thing, this negative thing.</p>
<p>But I think that there was bigotry veiled</p>
<p>in what she was saying</p>
<p>or that things she was saying</p>
<p>were reminiscent of bigoted ideas</p>
<p>and she expressed what are very reasonable emotions</p>
<p>to a platform where they became interpreted as fact</p>
<p>or used to support opinions</p>
<p>that are bigoted or untrue or harmful</p>
<p>and I guess the issue is</p>
<p>I feel that she came from a reasonable place</p>
<p>but I think she is contributing to the idea</p>
<p>that trans people and trans activists are irrational</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re harming children</p>
<p>because she is overstating</p>
<p>a lot of what she has said</p>
<p>is a very real account of what she&rsquo;s gone through</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s been said to her and what she&rsquo;s encountered</p>
<p>but because she&rsquo;s sharing the story of a cisgender woman</p>
<p>who experienced a predominant amount of backlash from trans people</p>
<p>the story that gets shared to an unfathomably large audience</p>
<p>is one where trans people are the bad guys</p>
<p>because in her story</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s fair to say that they were</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s dangerous, I think.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more like it&rsquo;s not what she said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what some people can interpret</p>
<p>or take away from what she said.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there anything that you would like to say to J.K. Rowling?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Definitely thank you for changing my life.</p>
<p>I have a lot of hope for her</p>
<p>and maybe naively a lot of faith in her</p>
<p>and what I would like to see is just</p>
<p>I want to look back on this in 10 years</p>
<p>and be like, remember when everyone thought</p>
<p>that J.K. Rowling was transphobic</p>
<p>and then there was that big dialogue</p>
<p>where she, I don&rsquo;t know, said something</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t abandon her original concerns</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how possible that is</p>
<p>but I guess I want to say I hope</p>
<p>that this is a blip on her legacy</p>
<p>and a point in the timeline of trans liberation</p>
<p>that sort of coincided</p>
<p>and I guess I just</p>
<p>I want people to be able to identify her</p>
<p>as having good intentions.</p>
<p>I want that to be what we come away with</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just my hope is that</p>
<p>we look at her as a well-meaning positive figure</p>
<p>and not evil or&hellip;</p>
<p>Or Voldemort.</p>
<p>Or Voldemort.</p>
<p>Noah, thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>You have been so generous</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just incredibly impressed</p>
<p>with the kind of thoughtful, nuanced position</p>
<p>that you have taken.</p>
<p>So thank you again for sharing that with us.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>As a fan who&rsquo;s been there from the beginning,</p>
<p>what is it you&rsquo;d like to say to her on this?</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a really powerful question.</p>
<p>I would say to her that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just wrong.</p>
<p>What would you want to say to her?</p>
<p>I would say</p>
<p>I know you have a lot of strongly held beliefs</p>
<p>and I just would like you to listen to us a little more</p>
<p>and hear what we&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>What would you say to her if she were listening?</p>
<p>Just&hellip;</p>
<p>God, why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>On my second trip to Scotland</p>
<p>to again sit down and talk with J.K. Rowling,</p>
<p>I wanted to give her the chance to answer</p>
<p>some of the hard questions posed by her critics,</p>
<p>to hear what she makes of them,</p>
<p>and to ask her, essentially,</p>
<p>the same question I am always asking myself.</p>
<p>What if you&rsquo;re wrong?</p>
<p>More, next time.</p>
