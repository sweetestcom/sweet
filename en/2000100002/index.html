<p>My daughter on the other hand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard people say that
there are no differences</p>

those people are idiots.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a husband.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a father of four.</p>
<p>I host a talk show.</p>
<p>I give speeches.</p>
<p>I write books.</p>
<p>I like to make sense of things,</p>
<p>but making sense of females
is a whole other matter.</p>
<p>Even astrophysicist, Stephen Hawking,</p>
<p>who could come up with

<p>was completely dumbfounded by women.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Stephen] Women, they
are a complete mystery.</p>

<li>
<p>[Matt] And now our culture is telling us</p>

<p>that the difference is between
girls and boys don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>That if you identify as something,</p>
<p>then you are that thing.</p>

<p>How do we help our kids make sense of this</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re bombarded
with conflicting messages</p>
<p>about gender and identity?</p>
<p>Forget trying to figure out women,</p>
<p>the real question is what is a woman?</p>

<p>Truth is I&rsquo;m not very good at fishing.</p>

<p>Are any of my kids who they claim to be?</p>
<p>Who are these people?</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>I better see a therapist.</p>
<p>(water trickling)</p>
<ul>
<li>In the state of Tennessee,</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a licensed marital
and family therapist,</p>
<p>which basically means I&rsquo;ve been trained up</p>
<p>to think about like
systems, family systems,</p>
<p>how we were raised up,</p>
<p>how that shapes who we are today.</p>
<ul>
<li>So on your website, quote if you&rsquo;ll,</li>
</ul>
<p>if you&rsquo;ll bear with me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quoting, you say, &ldquo;I use
a combination of approaches</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in my therapeutic work, including
anti-oppression feminist</p>
<p>and narrative frameworks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rely deeply on systems theory</p>
<p>and understanding that individuals</p>
<p>are products of and in
dialogue with our surroundings,</p>
<p>including our families,
broader culture, workplaces,</p>
<p>nature, and political climates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, so thinking about
the modalities that I use,</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely informed by
like feminist family therapy</p>
<p>and the ideas that we
live in gendered worlds</p>
<p>where there are certain imperatives</p>
<p>that are placed on us about
who we are and what we do</p>
<p>based on how we&rsquo;ve been gendered.</p>
<p>From the minute I was
assigned female, I was told,</p>
<p>okay, these are the kind of clothing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna wear.</p>
<p>These are the kind of the,</p>
<p>the type of play that you&rsquo;re
gonna engage in as a child.</p>
<p>The path that maybe your life will take</p>
<p>because of social expectations.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you, what do you
mean by assigned female?</li>
</ul>
<p>Who, who assigns female?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, so most times
people when they&rsquo;re born</li>
</ul>
<p>they&rsquo;re assigned a gender.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By the?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doctors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Gert] Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like what do they, what do
they base that assignment on?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s,
it&rsquo;s based on genitalia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So people looking at
genitalia and deciding,</p>
<p>okay, this is a, a girl or a boy.</p>
<p>And we know now that
like that sex and gender</p>
<p>are so much more than just this binary.</p>
<p>Some women have penises, right?</p>
<p>Some men have vaginas.</p>
<p>That, that, that&rsquo;s not
how, how gender works.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we know that, how do
we know that that&rsquo;s not true?</li>
</ul>
<p>Where, where did we, where
did we learn that from?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, well, we, I, I learned that</li>
</ul>
<p>from hearing from transgender people,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve said like, oh, I&rsquo;m a trans woman,</p>
<p>and just because I happen
to have a penis, right,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean that this is
like who I am as a person or,</p>
<p>or that genitalia doesn&rsquo;t equal gender.</p>
<p>Who they are, their gender,
their gender expression.</p>
<p>That, yeah, a trans woman is a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the fluidity of these things,</li>
</ul>
<p>how do I know if, if
I&rsquo;m a woman, you know?</p>
<p>I, I.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like scented candles and-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched &ldquo;Sex and the City&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Um.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So how do I know?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, Matt, that question right there,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>like that question is like,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s asked with a
lot of curiosity, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beginning of a lot of people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like gender identity development journeys.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If my mom who gave
birth to me is a woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And my wife is a woman,
though I haven&rsquo;t asked her.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I should.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re all women</p>
<p>and also the boy who sits
down with you and says,</p>
<p>I, I think I&rsquo;m a girl actually is one,</p>
<p>then, then what is a woman?</p>
<ul>
<li>Mm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a woman, so I, I
can&rsquo;t really answer that.</p>
<p>(brooding music)</p>
<ul>
<li>I thought therapy would
make me less confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I the only one feeling this way?</p>
<p>I need to hit the road and find out.</p>
<p>(gentle upbeat music)
(plane engine humming)</p>
<p>(traffic humming)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about gender in society.</p>
<p>Let me start with a real basic question.</p>
<p>What is a woman?</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman.</li>
</ul>
<p>(group laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna assume,
but you guys are all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;re all women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;re women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So how would you define it,
like in the simplest terms?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, it is, it is a stumper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A woman is someone
that likes to be pretty</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and think of themself
as a delicate creature.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty and delicate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could be a woman too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, you could.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining womanhood is
just a project of someone</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>who identifies as a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, but what, like,
what do they identify?</li>
</ul>
<p>You see what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>What do they identify as?</p>
<p>They identify as a
woman, but what is that?</p>
<ul>
<li>I honestly, don&rsquo;t know.</li>
</ul>
<p>(brooding music)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] It&rsquo;s a simple question,</li>
</ul>
<p>so why is it so hard to answer?</p>
<p>This is gonna take some
serious investigation.</p>
<p>(slow tempo jazz music)</p>
<p>For all of human existence women</p>
<p>were understood to be a certain thing,</p>
<p>(screen whooshes)</p>
<p>so what changed?</p>
<p>No one can seem to
answer the question now.</p>
<p>Over 2000 surgeries and
counting, Dr. Marci Bowers</p>
<p>is the nation&rsquo;s preeminent
sex change surgeon.</p>
<p>Surely someone who does
sex change surgeries</p>
<p>can answer what a woman is.</p>
<p>(gentle upbeat music)
(plane engine humming)</p>
<p>Dr. Marci Bowers, first of
all, thanks for talking to us.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a world renowned
gynecologist and surgeon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;re also a transgender woman.</p>
<p>Can you tell me a little bit about-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No, I mean, I identify as a woman, but.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re a woman, right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a woman with, I mean,
that&rsquo;s my life day-to-day,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but I have a transgender history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hmm.</li>
</ul>
<p>So one, one thing on your website,</p>
<p>it says gender affirm, GAV,
gender affirming vaginal plasty.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is that exactly?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaginal plasty is
creation of, of female,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>a, a female vagina and vulva.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re altering the
physical characteristics</p>
<p>of the individual to, to fit
better with a gender identity</p>
<p>that, that is female.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is all constructed from the penis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The surgeries are quite
refined in the sense</p>
<p>that they really not only do
they look like female anatomy,</p>
<p>but they also function
that way for the most part.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly it&rsquo;s a
bit of a Faustian bargain,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does anyone ever regret their surgeries</li>
</ul>
<p>or we know they do,</p>
<p>but how often do people
regret their surgeries?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, actually we
don&rsquo;t know that they do.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are legitimate detransitioner</p>
<p>and there are people who truly
feel that in their journey,</p>
<p>they may have made a mistake.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, this is a really,</p>
<p>really uncommon phenomenon.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve
ever heard of people</li>
</ul>
<p>in the transabled community,</p>
<p>these are people who are
physically able-bodied,</p>
<p>but feel like they should be
disabled or identify as such.</p>
<p>For example, a man who has two arms,</p>
<p>but feels like you should have one.</p>
<p>If a, if a man in this kind
of marginalized community</p>
<p>was, went to the doctor and said,</p>
<p>I want to have my arm cut off,</p>
<p>do you think that-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t have anything
to do with gender identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s,
someone&rsquo;s self identity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How someone identifies.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s some,</li>
</ul>
<p>that&rsquo;s someone who has a, a,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll accept it as a mental diagnosis,</p>
<p>a psychiatric condition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even pretend to know</p>
<p>what apotemnophilia is all about.</p>
<p>But somehow it&rsquo;s the idea
that you, and, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fascinated or
charmed by having a limb</p>
<p>or part of a limb missing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hmm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, I would say that&rsquo;s, uh,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>pardon my non-medical language, kooky.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see any, you think
this is totally irrelevant?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So the biggest broadest
question is what is a woman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A woman is a, you know,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>it&rsquo;s a combination of
your physical attributes,</p>
<p>and then what you&rsquo;re showing to the world,</p>
<p>and the gender clues that you give,</p>
<p>and hopefully those match
your gender identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The critics on the other side of this,</li>
</ul>
<p>of, of this, of this issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t many, but go ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t many who would disagree</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re saying about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, you know, the
dinosaurs of the world</li>
</ul>
<p>are certainly out there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hmm.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>(upbeat music)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How long have you been
running the shop here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25 Years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you had an incident
here a little while ago</p>
<p>that went really viral online.</p>
<p>Lots of reaction in the public.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Reporter] Aberdeen
Councilwoman Tiesa Meskis</li>
</ul>
<p>confronted owner Don Sucher about a sign</p>
<p>he posted in his store.</p>
<ul>
<li>One day I just put
the sign up over here,</li>
</ul>
<p>and he came around the corner,</p>
<p>and I thought, okay, I recognize him.</p>
<p>I says, &ldquo;Oh, I recognize you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re our new city councilman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m your
new city councilwoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was, it was kind of on from there.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Tiesa] You know what?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No, what your spouting is bullshit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Tiesa] No it&rsquo;s not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Transwomen are women, sir.</p>
<p>That sign is bullshit.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing this 25 years,</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with anybody,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re gay,
transsexual, anything.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now how, you&rsquo;re saying councilman, he,</li>
</ul>
<p>this individual was saying, I&rsquo;m a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right.</li>
<li>And you said,</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you know that
that person&rsquo;s not a woman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I know?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, uh, common sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Tiesa] Trans women are women!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t, doesn&rsquo;t the science say</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that if someone identifies
as a woman then they are.</p>
<ul>
<li>No, no.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s completely bogus.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care, if you
think you&rsquo;re a sheep dog</p>
<p>and you come into my store,</p>
<p>it don&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t come in and try to shove</p>
<p>that shit down my throat.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it makes someone feel better,</li>
</ul>
<p>what about their, their feelings?</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t give shit</li>
</ul>
<p>about their feelings, I&rsquo;m old.</p>
<ul>
<li>What about the Star Wars universe?</li>
</ul>
<p>Jar Jar Binks, pansexual do you think?</p>
<p>Transgender?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Uh, why would I, why would I even care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s his truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, it ain&rsquo;t true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a scientist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a gender
studies major or are you?</p>
<ul>
<li>No.</li>
<li>No, okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you know that you&rsquo;re a man?</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I know that I&rsquo;m a man?</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess, because I got a dick.</p>
<ul>
<li>Huh?</li>
</ul>
<p>(upbeat music)</p>
<p>Well, I guess Don isn&rsquo;t overthinking it.</p>
<p>He admits he&rsquo;s not a gender studies major</p>
<p>or at the very least a doctor.</p>
<p>Maybe I should go talk to one.</p>
<p>(gentle upbeat music)
(plane engine humming)</p>
<p>(traffic humming)</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Michelle Forcier,</li>
</ul>
<p>um, and I have a medical degree</p>
<p>from University of Connecticut Residency,</p>
<p>University of Utah Pediatrics.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve worked for a number</p>
<p>of different Planned
Parenthoods for 20 years.</p>
<p>I do advanced contraception and abortion</p>
<p>as well as gender hormones,</p>
<p>and sort of looking at the whole sort</p>
<p>of schema of gender, sex,
and, and reproductive justice.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you&rsquo;ve done a lot
of work in this field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could you just start by telling us-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At what age can a child
first begin to transition</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>into another gender or identify themselves</p>
<p>as a gender different
from how they were born?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I mean, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s research</p>
<p>and data that show that babies and infants</p>
<p>understand differences in gender.</p>
<p>Some children figure out
their gender really early,</p>
<p>and the reason why we are say,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s interesting or important</p>
<p>is &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re figuring
out their gender identity</p>
<p>is not necessarily congruent</p>
<p>with their sexes signed at birth.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the, when the doctor
sees the penis and says,</li>
</ul>
<p>this is a male, has the sex of male,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an arbitrary distinction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Telling that family
based on that little penis</li>
</ul>
<p>that your child is absolutely</p>
<p>a hundred percent male identified</p>
<p>no matter what else occurs in their life,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>So what is gender affirmation care?</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;re a big proponent of,</p>
<p>if we walk through a child
is sitting down with you</p>
<p>is questioning-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their gender.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What&rsquo;s the gender affirmation process?</p>
<ul>
<li>Affirmation means
that as a pediatrician,</li>
</ul>
<p>as someone who says my job</p>
<p>is to provide the best
medical care for you</p>
<p>is I need to listen really carefully.</p>
<p>And how I put it in words for kids</p>
<p>so that they can understand
it is tell me your story.</p>
<p>Where have you been in
terms of your gender</p>
<p>and your gender identity?</p>
<p>Where are you right now?</p>
<p>And more excitingly,</p>
<p>where would you like to be in the future?</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever met a four-year-old</li>
</ul>
<p>who believes in Santa Claus?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So this is someone who believes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that a fat man is
traveling through the sky</p>
<p>on a flying reindeer at lightning speed</p>
<p>coming down his chimney with presents.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would you say that this is someone</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>who maybe has a tenuous grasp on reality?</p>
<ul>
<li>They have an appropriate
four-year-old handle</li>
</ul>
<p>on the reality-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sure, agreed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s very real for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreed, agreed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But Santa Claus is real for them but-</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Santa Claus</li>
</ul>
<p>is not actually real.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, well and, but Santa Claus</li>
</ul>
<p>does deliver their Christmas presents.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well, yeah, but he is not real though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To that child they are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I see a child who, you know,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>believes in Santa Claus
and then let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>this is a boy and he says, I&rsquo;m a girl.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is someone who can&rsquo;t distinguish</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>between fantasy and reality,</p>
<p>so how could you take that as a reality?</p>
<ul>
<li>I would say that as a
pediatrician and as a parent,</li>
</ul>
<p>I would say how wonderful</p>
<p>my four-year-old and their imagination is.</p>
<p>(gentle music)</p>
<p>(girl laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>Aren&rsquo;t kids famous for
their active imaginations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we really let our
children define reality?</p>
<p>(traffic humming)</p>
<p>If I say that I, I feel a certain way</p>
<p>then obviously you can&rsquo;t tell
me I don&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But just because I feel that way</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>does that mean that it&rsquo;s true?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I mean, if it&rsquo;s your reality okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s yours reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly like none of
my business who you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So we all have our own-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What if I said, I want you to say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s true that I&rsquo;m a
woman, would you say that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That you&rsquo;re a woman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would also say that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t care like
whatever makes you happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Woman] What&rsquo;s true to you
can be, can be false to me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So like it, it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<ul>
<li>What if I said that it&rsquo;s true,</li>
</ul>
<p>my truth is that you don&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>does that mean you, you no longer exist?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Woman] I mean, if
that&rsquo;s your truth sure.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, because it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>But you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Woman] Well, I mean, if you&rsquo;re saying</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that I do then I do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, but even if I said
that you don&rsquo;t you still do</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re
having this conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Woman] I mean, are we?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think so, I mean, I thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Woman] That&rsquo;s what you think.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(brooding music)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] Well, I should have known</li>
</ul>
<p>it would be hard to define
reality in Hollywood.</p>
<p>I should probably look to the place</p>
<p>where truth is the foremost pursuit,</p>
<p>the American university.</p>
<p>(slow tempo gentle music)</p>
<ul>
<li>What we do in, in gender studies</li>
</ul>
<p>is not just reduced gender</p>
<p>to what psychologists might
call individual differences,</p>
<p>but rather thinking about gender.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not women and man,</p>
<p>but gender as a, as a social form,</p>
<p>something that kind of infuses itself</p>
<p>into virtually all aspects of social life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s talk about that then.</li>
</ul>
<p>Uh, I guess we should start with</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got gender and sex, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Patrick] Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What, what&rsquo;s the
difference between the two?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a difference?</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw that in your questions
and I thought, my goodness,</li>
</ul>
<p>this is what we spend an entire semester</p>
<p>kind of thinking through.</p>
<p>But what we tend to think about
in the social sciences today</p>
<p>is that sex refers to a set
of biological characteristics,</p>
<p>and gender is a social
construct or category.</p>
<p>What I think is often misleading
about that characteristic,</p>
<p>then is allowed to be sort
of messy and complicated.</p>
<p>But in that framing,
when you split them up</p>
<p>into these holy discrete
constructs studies scholars, and,</p>
<p>and really more specifically people</p>
<p>who study gender and sex,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking about
sexuality right now.</p>
<p>I teach in the kind of,</p>
<p>academic universe that I travel in</p>
<p>is that we see how deeply gendered ideas,</p>
<p>cultural ideas about
masculinity and femininity,</p>
<p>maleness and femaleness,</p>
<p>both in humans and in
lots of other animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So are gender and sex
two different things or?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, I think that they,
they both are, and they aren&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d be, I&rsquo;m comfortable
saying that gender and sex</p>
<p>are, are two different constructs,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re deeply
intertwined with each other.</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re talking about gender and, and sex,</li>
</ul>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of controversies there.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about a trans woman,</p>
<p>has all of the male
physical characteristics,</p>
<p>so would that not be a male then?</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t, couldn&rsquo;t we plainly
say this person is a male?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, well I guess it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like,</li>
</ul>
<p>why are you asking the question?</p>
<p>I think I, I, I wanna understand</p>
<p>sort of why that&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>So if someone tells you-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Just to sort of understand
reality, you know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, I mean, I think when
someone tells you who they are,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>you should believe them.</p>
<p>So if a person says that they&rsquo;re
a woman or they&rsquo;re a man,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s them telling
you their gender is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not so sure why,</p>
<p>what social in interactions
would have to do with,</p>
<p>with maleness or femaleness that would be-</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I, I&rsquo;m not even
talking about social context.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m just trying to start</p>
<p>by getting to the truth, you know?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m really uncomfortable</li>
</ul>
<p>with that language of
like getting to the truth.</p>
<p>Again in social life-</p>
<ul>
<li>Why, why is that,</li>
</ul>
<p>why is that uncomfortable?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because that, it sounds actually</li>
</ul>
<p>deeply transphobic to me, and if-</p>
<ul>
<li>And truth-</li>
<li>And if you keep probing,</li>
</ul>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna stop the interview.</p>
<p>I-</p>
<ul>
<li>If I probe</li>
</ul>
<p>about what the truth is?</p>
<ul>
<li>You keep invoking the word truth,</li>
</ul>
<p>which is condescending and rude.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying to you-</p>
<ul>
<li>How is,</li>
</ul>
<p>how is the word truth
condescending and rude?</p>
<ul>
<li>Why don&rsquo;t you tell
me what your truth is?</li>
</ul>
<p>And you&rsquo;re walking on 30
seconds more of thin ice</p>
<p>before I get up.</p>
<ul>
<li>What my truth is?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think I really have a truth.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s just
the truth, like the reality.</p>
<p>And so we should begin
by trying to figure out</p>
<p>what the reality is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uh-huh.</li>
</ul>
<p>And why are you concerned with
when someone else tells you</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a man or even
if they use the word male,</p>
<p>why are you concerned
with not believing them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, you keep bringing
it back to, you know,</li>
</ul>
<p>how do you respond in a
social situation, but-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do,
I&rsquo;m a social scientist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, right, but we&rsquo;re at a university.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a place of understanding
truth, isn&rsquo;t it or?</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely we are, we
pursue the true truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a social scientist
and that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well, you just said
the truth is transphobic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That, that you would say that you&rsquo;re,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>if you&rsquo;re saying the truth is</p>
<p>that I get to say you are not
a man, show me your genitalia,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s transphobic.</p>
<ul>
<li>No, I don&rsquo;t wanna see
anybody&rsquo;s genitalia.</li>
</ul>
<p>I, I, I just mean someone
can make a statement</p>
<p>about themselves that could be untrue.</p>
<p>Like, for example, if I,</p>
<p>if I were to say that I&rsquo;m a black man,</p>
<p>could you, would you accept
that or would you be skeptical?</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you Black?</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you African American?</p>
<p>Are you biracial?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well you don&rsquo;t look that,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t sound like
that&rsquo;s a genuine statement</p>
<p>of who you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, so that&rsquo;s my point.</li>
</ul>
<p>I, I could make a statement
about who I am that&rsquo;s incorrect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course, I think it&rsquo;s well established</li>
</ul>
<p>that human beings can lie yes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Or not even lie.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, I could just be mistaken.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<ul>
<li>I guess this all comes back,</li>
</ul>
<p>just it all comes down
to really one question,</p>
<p>especially women, gender,
and sexuality studies.</p>
<p>So what, so what, what is a woman?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why do you ask that question?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just really like to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think the
answer to that question is?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m asking,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I came to a college professor</p>
<p>who, who&rsquo;s, this is your,
this is what you do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What other kinds of
answers have you gotten?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of like this,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>where you&rsquo;re, where
you&rsquo;re not answering it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of that so.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that you,</li>
</ul>
<p>that you say that some of the people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve interviewed have
been reluctant to answer it.</p>
<p>And I think that has a
lot to do with the way,</p>
<p>the questions that preceded it and the,</p>
<p>the way that you&rsquo;ve conducted
yourself in the interview.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How have I conducted myself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you think you&rsquo;ve
conducted yourself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, (laughs)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>you just really don&rsquo;t wanna
answer the questions do you?</p>
<ul>
<li>I, I came today very willing</li>
</ul>
<p>and, and enthusiastic
about answering questions</p>
<p>about women&rsquo;s and gender
sexuality studies,</p>
<p>which is what I do.</p>
<ul>
<li>You wanted,</li>
</ul>
<p>you wanted to answer questions
about women&rsquo;s studies,</p>
<p>and so shouldn&rsquo;t the, the first answer</p>
<p>you should be able to provide</p>
<p>is what exactly as a woman?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, it&rsquo;s, for me it&rsquo;s,</li>
</ul>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a really simple answer,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a person who
identifies as a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>But what are they identifying as?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Matt] So what is that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you know what a
circular definition is?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like what
you&rsquo;re doing right now,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>where a woman is, is a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, &lsquo;cause you are seeking</li>
</ul>
<p>what we would call in my field of work,</p>
<p>an essentialist definition of gender.</p>
<p>I think it sounds like you would like me</p>
<p>to give you a set of biological
or cultural characteristics</p>
<p>that are associated with
one gender or the other.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not seeking any type of definition,</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m just seeking a definition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, and I gave you one.</li>
</ul>
<p>(gentle playful music)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well now I can say I&rsquo;ve been to college.</li>
</ul>
<p>Glad I didn&rsquo;t pay for it.</p>
<p>Is there anyone willing to
give me a straight answer?</p>
<p>Ideally somebody with a bunch</p>
<p>of medical degrees on the wall.</p>
<p>Dr. Grossman, thanks for talking to us.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a psychiatrist medical doctor,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve done a lot of
work in child psychiatry.</p>
<p>What is transgenderism from
a psychiatric standpoint?</p>
<ul>
<li>The best way to approach it</li>
</ul>
<p>is by speaking about gender dysphoria,</p>
<p>which is an intense
loathing and discomfort</p>
<p>with one&rsquo;s biological sex.</p>
<p>They exist anywhere between</p>
<p>one in 30,000 people and one in 110,000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to distinguish those people</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s happening much more recently,</p>
<p>which is kids that never had
any discomfort or dysphoria</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s now called with
their biological sex.</p>
<p>And then quite suddenly as
preteens or as, as adolescents,</p>
<p>they come out and they announce
that they are gender fluid</p>
<p>or they, they start to question their sex.</p>
<p>So first let&rsquo;s define
the terms sex and gender.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sex is biology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sex is unchanging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on chromosomes
99.999% of the cells in the body</p>
<p>are marked either male or female.</p>
<p>Gender on the other hand is a perception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feeling, it&rsquo;s a way of identifying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s an experience.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s subjective.</p>
<ul>
<li>It sounds like what you&rsquo;re saying</li>
</ul>
<p>is that if a man is male,</p>
<p>but thinks of himself as a
woman, he&rsquo;s not actually a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Male gametes, that&rsquo;s what makes me male.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, your, your sperm
don&rsquo;t make you male.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then what does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s a constellation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In reality, in truth, okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whose truth are we talking about?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same truth that says
we&rsquo;re sitting in this room</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>right now you and I.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not listening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I, if I see a chicken lying eggs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I say that&rsquo;s a female
chicken laying eggs,</p>
<p>did I assign female</p>
<p>or am I just observing a physical reality</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in the world?</p>
<ul>
<li>Does a chicken have gender identity?</li>
</ul>
<p>Does a chicken cry?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, a-</li>
<li>Does a chicken</li>
</ul>
<p>commit suicide?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s frame it-</p>
<ul>
<li>What does that</li>
</ul>
<p>have to do with?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re talking,
you&rsquo;re trying to-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chicken has sex like any,
like any biological organism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A chicken has an assigned gender,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but a chicken doesn&rsquo;t
have a gender identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>So we assign female to
chickens when they lay eggs?</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s-</p>
<ul>
<li>We assume they&rsquo;re female</li>
</ul>
<p>if they lay eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now I was told that
really everyone agrees</li>
</ul>
<p>with the current approach to
gender and transitioning kids</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t agree that
you&rsquo;re a dinosaur and a bigot.</p>
<p>So are you a bigoted dinosaur?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not bigoted, and I&rsquo;m not a dinosaur.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am rooted in reality and in science.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who&rsquo;s reality?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s one reality.</p>

<p>[Announcer] Coming up
girls 100 meter final.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first race that I competed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>against a transgender athlete
was during my freshman year.</p>
<p>(gun bangs)
(group chattering)</p>
<p>And once the gun went off,</p>
<p>the two transgender
athletes took off flying</p>
<p>and left all of us girls in the dust.</p>
<p>Throughout all four years of high school</p>
<p>I was forced to compete
against biological males.</p>
<p>I only competed against them
in the sprinting events,</p>
<p>but I raced against these athletes</p>
<p>over a dozen times throughout the years,</p>
<p>and every single time I lost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did, did they inch you out of metals</li>
</ul>
<p>that you would&rsquo;ve won otherwise</p>
<p>or trophies you would&rsquo;ve had?</p>
<ul>
<li>They beat me out by
20 meters out of metals</li>
</ul>
<p>and qualifying spots.</p>
<p>I missed out on qualifying
for New England.</p>
<p>I had, and I had to go in the long jump</p>
<p>and the four by 200 meter relay,</p>
<p>so I was forced on the
sidelines in my own event,</p>
<p>and if they were not there, I
would&rsquo;ve been able to qualify.</p>
<p>So I missed out on so much
throughout my high school career.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did they win all the events
or almost all the events?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between the two of them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>they won every single
event they competed in.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How does that, how does that feel?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is so frustrating and heartbreaking</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>because we elite female
athletes train so hard</p>
<p>to shave just fractions of
a second off of our time</p>
<p>and going into races</p>
<p>knowing that we will never be able to win.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It feels like all
that work gone to waste?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After so many losses it
just gets to the point</p>
<p>of why am I even doing this?</p>
<p>Why am I keep, training so
hard and sacrificing so much</p>
<p>just to place third and beyond.</p>

<ul>
<li>Case in Connecticut, there
were two male track runners,</li>
</ul>
<p>trans-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They were trans girls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And who, who decided that they</p>
<p>were gonna race against the girls.</p>
<p>And you look at the, those individuals,</p>
<p>you look at their times against
the men, against the boys,</p>
<p>so they were kind of middle of the pack.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re racing the girls</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re, you know,
first and second place.</p>
<p>Is that indicative of some
kind of unfair advantage</p>
<p>that those individuals might
have against the girls?</p>
<ul>
<li>No, it&rsquo;s not indicative
of an unfair advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I think part of the proof of this</p>
<p>is that more transgender girls</p>
<p>are coming out in high school
and still playing sports,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not winning.</p>
<p>You know, the Connecticut
case is the exception.</p>
<p>It got a lot of attention</p>
<p>because those two trans
girls performed well,</p>
<p>but there are many, many-</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>More trans girls competing</li>
</ul>
<p>in sports and they don&rsquo;t excel because-</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, we could-</li>
<li>&lsquo;Cause at the end</li>
</ul>
<p>of the day, whether or not you win a game</p>
<p>is not just, is about how hard
you work in your practice,</p>
<p>and most of us aren&rsquo;t gonna win,</p>
<p>and that goes for
transgender athletes too.</p>
<p>(upbeat country music)</p>
<p>‚ô™ Let&rsquo;s go girls. ‚ô™</p>
<p>(group cheering)</p>
<p>The norm is that transgender youth</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t win that much in sports games.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Announcer] Alana McLaughlin
was very appreciative</li>
</ul>
<p>for Provost to take this fight.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how appreciative it&rsquo;s now,</p>
<p>but she got a couple punches in.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Rodrigo] It is the
very much the exception</li>
</ul>
<p>when a transgender young person does win.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>And the tap!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Rodrigo] And it&rsquo;s
because there&rsquo;s not really</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>an advantage to being trans.</p>
<p>Only a few people are
going to lead the pack.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some slight differences,</li>
</ul>
<p>but does it translate to
a competitive advantage?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be very hard
pressed to prove that.</p>
<p>(group chattering)</p>
<ul>
<li>If there was a big advantage</li>
</ul>
<p>to being transgender in sports,</p>
<p>then we would see transgender
women totally dominating.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Announcer] And over
the last half of the pool,</li>
</ul>
<p>nobody will touch Lia Thomas.</p>
<p>‚ô™ Man I feel like a woman ‚ô™</p>
<ul>
<li>[Reporter] Transgender
swimmer, Lia Thomas</li>
</ul>
<p>breaking barriers and records,</p>
<p>but in a new article Sports Illustrated</p>
<p>calls the college senior</p>
<p>the most controversial athlete in America.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lia obviously helps us do better, right?</li>
</ul>
<p>Lia swimming really fast.</p>
<p>Lia&rsquo;s performance helps</p>
<p>the University of Pennsylvania swim team.</p>
<p>The feeling of winning
doesn&rsquo;t feel as good anymore</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause it feels tainted.</p>
<p>There was a lot of things
you couldn&rsquo;t talk about</p>
<p>that were very concerning.</p>
<p>Like a locker room situation</p>
<p>if you even brought up concerns about it,</p>
<p>you were transphobic.</p>
<p>If you even bring up the
fact that Lia&rsquo;s swimming</p>
<p>might not be fair, you
were immediately shut down</p>
<p>being called a hateful
person or transphobic.</p>
<ul>
<li>But there&rsquo;s never any conversation?</li>
</ul>
<p>The coaches don&rsquo;t sit
everyone down and acknowledge</p>
<p>what everyone&rsquo;s really upset about.</p>
<ul>
<li>So Penn actually
brought in people high up</li>
</ul>
<p>in the athletic department to talk to us.</p>
<p>They brought in someone
from like the LGBTQ center.</p>
<p>They brought in someone from
the psychological services.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So you&rsquo;re upset about
what&rsquo;s happening and so-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need psychological help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And they told us in
this meeting, they said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, we understand there&rsquo;s
an array of emotions,</p>
<p>but Lia&rsquo;s swimming is a non-negotiable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However we can help you make that okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>So you&rsquo;re anonymous for this interview.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why did you decide that you
can&rsquo;t have your face out there</p>
<p>saying these things?</p>
<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;ve made it pretty clear
that if you speak up about it</li>
</ul>
<p>and you say anything
negative that like your life</p>
<p>will be over in some way.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ll be blasted all over
the internet as a transphob</p>
<p>if you come out and then you&rsquo;ll
never be able to get a job.</p>
<p>Like anyone who wants to
hire you will look you up</p>
<p>and see you&rsquo;re transphobic
and your life will be over.</p>
<p>(siren wailing)

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s say that I identified
as a woman tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<p>and I wanted to go into the
same locker room where you are.</p>
<p>Should I be allowed to do that</p>
<p>as long as I identify that way?</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just feel that other women</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay for a man</p>

<li>Hello, I&rsquo;m Congressman Mark Takano.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trans month of visibility is a time</p>
<p>to recognize the strength,
diversity, and resiliency</p>
<p>of the transgender community.</p>
<p>Together we can make our
country and our world</p>
<p>a more accepting place by speaking out</p>
<p>against transphobia at the source,</p>
<p>and supporting the trans community</p>
<p>by getting the Equality
Act signed into law.</p>
<ul>
<li>Congressman, thank
you for, for being here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for joining us.</p>
<p>You are the first member of Congress</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a member of the LGBT community</p>
<p>and also a person of Asian descent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also a big proponent
of the Equality Act.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the Equality Act?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were to just
summarize it very briefly.</p>
<p>I know it does a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most simplest way to
talk about the Equality Act</li>
</ul>
<p>is that it simply amends
the 1964 Civil Rights Act</p>
<p>to include sexual orientation
and gender identity.</p>
<p>So public accommodations is one area.</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s a way that someone whose LGBT is,</li>
</ul>
<p>could be discriminated in
public accommodations currently?</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, you know,
public accommodations</li>
</ul>
<p>is the whole area of, you
know, hotels and motels, and.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bathrooms, and sports teams is that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d say bathrooms-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports teams, athletic events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get into more
specific policy issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There, there are some
women who say, and I&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a few who say this.</p>
<p>They say, &ldquo;Hey, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like some privacy in the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer not to encounter,</p>
<p>you know, naked penises, frankly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They say even that the
penis is a telltale sign</p>
<p>that someone is a male.</p>
<p>I mean, there, there are people</p>
<p>who kind of really bought into the,</p>
<p>to the rumor that only men have penises.</p>
<p>What, how do we account for that?</p>
<p>How do you respond to that?</p>
<ul>
<li>Um.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, um,</p>
<p>well, what I would say is
that most transgender people</p>
<p>that I know, um, and it&rsquo;s a very I think</p>
<p>distinct minority of people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very, it&rsquo;s a, it is a, it is a very</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re talking not
about a lot of people.</p>
<p>Um, I think a person who wants
to use a woman&rsquo;s bathroom</p>
<p>who identifies as transgender</p>
<p>really does think themselves as a female.</p>
<p>So how we go about trying to,</p>
<p>um, you know, respect
their basic right to live.</p>
<p>I think will be an important
part of this law and um-</p>
<ul>
<li>With a law-</li>
<li>Bathrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, wait a minute, bath, bathrooms are,</p>
<p>bathrooms are, you know,</p>
<p>where you want to take this conversation</p>
<p>instead of the basic right to just life</p>
<p>is something that I&rsquo;m kind of mystified</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re kind of not focusing on first.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going straight to the
controversy over bathrooms.</p>
<p>Um, so you know what I think
this interview is over.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Woman] Yeah, I think
we&rsquo;re gonna wrap it there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think, I think this interview is over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just said one last question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uh, no, I, I, I, the interview is over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want to know-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please turn off the cameras.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What, what is a woman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just turn off the cameras.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Woman] Excuse me.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna end the interview.</p>
<p>If you guys could please pack up</p>
<p>and return the office exactly as-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I just wanted to know-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you found it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I came all this way</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to know what-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;re fair questions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I just wanted to know what is a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Woman] And you&rsquo;re not gonna find out.</li>
</ul>
<p>(slow tempo jazz music)</p>
<ul>
<li>My trip to California
isn&rsquo;t providing many answers,</li>
</ul>
<p>but at least I&rsquo;m making new friends.</p>
<p>You worry about kids
walking around out here?</p>
<ul>
<li>No, because I raised two daughters.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&rsquo;re two of the most
well-adjusted adults.</p>
<p>They grew up around naked people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been studies that have shown</p>
<p>that children raised
around non-sexual nudity</p>
<p>actually have fewer hangups
when they&rsquo;re adults.</p>
<ul>
<li>People do have hangups.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things hanging right now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>During this conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Uh, can anyone be any
gender they wanna be?</p>
<p>Can a man become a
woman if he wants to be?</p>
<ul>
<li>I leave the, I mean, what people do</li>
</ul>
<p>that&rsquo;s personal choice.</p>
<p>People can live the life they want to.</p>
<p>I, I&rsquo;m trying to live the life
I want to, an authentic life.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can see that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I respect</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>other people&rsquo;s rights to
choose what they wanna do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, why are you asking a gay man</li>
</ul>
<p>as to what it means to be a woman?</p>
<p>You should be asking women
what it means to be women,</p>
<p>especially trans women who,
what it means to be women.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I&rsquo;m asking all kinds of people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can anyone have an opinion about it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Only people who are women.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gay men don&rsquo;t know nothing</p>
<p>about what it means to be a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you told gay men
here in San Francisco</li>
</ul>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not allowed
to talk about this?</p>
<ul>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I have, it&rsquo;s not like I come around</p>
<p>and say what a gay man is allowed to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you&rsquo;re saying, so you&rsquo;re
saying if you&rsquo;re not a woman,</li>
</ul>
<p>then you shouldn&rsquo;t have an opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where does a guy get a
right to say what a woman is?</li>
</ul>
<p>Women only know what women are.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are you a cat?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you tell me what a cat is?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is actually a genuine mistake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sorry I even came up here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you wanna tell us what a woman is?</li>
</ul>
<p>(slow tempo jazz music)</p>
<p>If my friend in the purple hat is correct</p>
<p>and only women can tell
me what a woman is,</p>
<p>I guess I need to go where the women are.</p>
<p>(upbeat music)</p>
<p>What, what is a woman?</p>
<p>Can you tell me that?</p>
<p>(group laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>Uh.</li>
<li>Well, you&rsquo;re at</li>
</ul>
<p>the women&rsquo;s march, you
must to have some idea.</p>
<p>So I see girl&rsquo;s vagina.</p>
<p>Does that mean that
they&rsquo;re the only people</p>
<p>who can get pregnant?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Brunette Woman] If men
could get pregnant too,</li>
</ul>
<p>I think they want the right to choose.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>But they,</li>
</ul>
<p>but men can get pregnant?</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re saying someone
who is born as a woman,</li>
</ul>
<p>but identifies as a man, that-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is that a man?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Blonde Woman] Real man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So they, so men can get pregnant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Blonde Woman] Yes. (laughs)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ul>
<li>If they have the parts</li>
</ul>
<p>to do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is it just women that
get birth or is it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or I guess yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, so men, so men can give birth too?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone with a vagina.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, that could be a man or a woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Blonde Woman] Well, I mean, I think</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that&rsquo;s the whole point, right?</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s fluid.</p>
<p>The way that we define
these things changes a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Brunette Woman] What
are you doing here?</p>

<p>I figured this is a
good place to find out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come all this way
to ask that question.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what a woman is?</p>
<ul>
<li>

<li>Uh, they&rsquo;re just laughing</li>

<p>A woman have a penis and she&rsquo;s a woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my country, I can&rsquo;t
go day without hearing it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We hear it every day.</p>
<p>So in my country, sometimes
you&rsquo;ll hear people say,</p>
<p>a man will say, I, that I&rsquo;m a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a woman trapped in a man&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>And so they say that I have
a woman trapped inside me.</p>

<p>So it sounds like you,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>you don&rsquo;t spend a lot of
time thinking about gender.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, you just
kind of live your lives.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think much about it.</p>
<p>(tribe member speaking

<p>(tribe leader speaking

<p>He&rsquo;s shocked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(group singing in foreign language)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] The Maasai people
don&rsquo;t think much about gender,</li>
</ul>
<p>but they have a firm
sense of their identity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that gender ideology</p>
<p>is a uniquely Western phenomenon.</p>
<p>So where did all this come from?</p>
<p>Who came up with it and why?</p>
<p>(group chattering)</p>
<ul>
<li>Matt, I, I want, I
wanna show this to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;re a parent, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Perfectly Normal&rdquo;,
for 10 years and up.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just one page I
want you to see here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For 10 and up, huh?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s unspeakable what these people</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>have done to our children.</p>
<ul>
<li>When, when did that start?</li>
</ul>
<p>When was it decided that we
need to start teaching kids</p>
<p>about this stuff at such a young age?</p>
<ul>
<li>So I&rsquo;ll answer that
with one word, Kinsey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kinsey was a social reformer.</p>
<p>(slide clicking)</p>
<p>He wanted to rid society
of Judeo-Christian values</p>
<p>when it came to sexuality,</p>
<p>and he worked very hard to do that.</p>
<p>And I would say he succeeded.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] Kinsey would be very
happy with our culture today.</li>
</ul>
<p>His idea was that children
are sexual from birth.</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re all inherently sexual creatures</p>
<p>from cradle to grave.</p>
<p>He believed that true happiness is found</p>
<p>in a life of perverse
sexual experimentation,</p>
<p>no matter the age.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What came out is that his
research was fraudulent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinsey based, his
fraudulent conclusions on data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>he collected from convicted sex offenders</p>
<p>and child molesters.</p>
<p>(slide clicking)</p>
<p>His research was conducted in
prisons, not everyday America.</p>
<p>(slide clicking)</p>
<p>He also performed horrific
sexual experiments on children,</p>
<p>some under the age of one.</p>
<p>(slide clicking)</p>
<p>His most influential book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&rdquo;</p>
<p>contains an infamous
chart called table 34,</p>
<p>which documents the
orgasms of very young kids,</p>
<p>including babies as
young as five months old.</p>
<p>But instead of suffering the consequences</p>
<p>for his heinous actions,</p>
<p>he was and still is celebrated
by academia and Hollywood.</p>
<p>His ideas formed the
foundation for sexual education</p>
<p>in public schools today.</p>
<p>How do we get from this to you
can choose your own gender?</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, well now we have another</li>
</ul>
<p>and very important character,</p>
<p>and his name was John Money.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] John Money was a
psychologist and professor</li>
</ul>
<p>at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Gender ideology was his brain child.</p>
<p>In fact, he coined the terms</p>
<p>gender identity and gender roles.</p>
<p>And according to Money,</p>
<p>babies are gender neutral at birth</p>
<p>and ultimately environment determines</p>
<p>whether a person is a man or a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>Money was telling the
world about his theory</li>
</ul>
<p>that a boy could be raised as a girl</p>
<p>and do just fine and vice versa.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] And so money tried out his theory</li>
</ul>
<p>on two young twin boys, the Reimer twins.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the twins were eight months old</li>
</ul>
<p>and they went to be circumcised,</p>
<p>the first twin, whose name was Bruce,</p>
<p>something went wrong with the machinery</p>
<p>and his penis was burnt off.</p>
<p>They stopped and didn&rsquo;t
do a second circumcision</p>
<p>on the other twin, as you might imagine.</p>
<p>And the parents of course
didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>How are they gonna raise this child?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] John Money
convinced Bruce&rsquo;s parents</li>
</ul>
<p>to transition him into a girl.</p>
<p>Money also conducted
sexually abusive experiments</p>
<p>on the twins throughout their childhood,</p>
<p>including forcing them to
simulate sex acts on each other.</p>
<ul>
<li>He reported up to the age of 10</li>
</ul>
<p>that this was a complete success.</p>
<p>Well, wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] The results were a disaster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bruce could never fully
accept his female identity.</p>
<p>Eventually his parents told him the truth</p>
<p>and he chose to transition back to a boy,</p>
<p>taking the name David.</p>
<p>As an adult, David spoke out</p>
<p>about the abuse and the damage
done to him by John Money.</p>
<ul>
<li>The girls would do their
things with their Barbies</li>
</ul>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>and that wouldn&rsquo;t interest me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And things such as
trucks, and building forts,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and, you know, get into the odd fist fight</p>
<p>and climbing trees, that&rsquo;s the
kind of stuff that I liked,</p>
<p>but it was unacceptable.</p>
<p>So I never-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As a girl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[David] As, as a girl, I
had no place to, to fit in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trauma that he and his brother</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and his entire family went
through left deep scars.</p>
<p>His brother died of an
overdose when he was 38,</p>
<p>and then David died, committed suicide.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was never a retraction</li>
</ul>
<p>or an apology from John Money,</p>
<p>instead his ideas were adopted
by mainstream psychology</p>
<p>and they formed the basis
of gender ideology today.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t more people know</p>
<p>about John Money and Alfred Kinsey?</p>
<ul>
<li>Evidently there are forces</li>
</ul>
<p>that don&rsquo;t want this information out.</p>
<p>(gentle brooding music)</p>
<ul>
<li>I, I never fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was a, I was an alpha female,</p>
<p>a sales executive that kind
of just didn&rsquo;t fit in any box.</p>
<p>When psychologists, or somebody
that I was in love with,</p>
<p>or whatever said that I
was in the wrong body,</p>
<p>I started to think, well, maybe I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a biological woman
that medically transitioned</p>
<p>to appear like a male</p>
<p>through synthetic hormones and surgery.</p>
<p>I will never be a man.</p>
<p>Is it transphobic for
me to tell the truth?</p>
<p>Why is it in a couple
hundred years from now</p>
<p>if you dug up my body,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna go, yep, that was a woman.</p>
<p>Had babies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can you tell me about the
procedures that you, you had?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had seven surgeries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had one stress heart attack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a helicopter life
ride with a pulmonary embolism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had 17 rounds of antibiotics.</p>
<p>I had six inches of hair</p>
<p>on the inside of my urethra for 17 months.</p>
<p>Nobody would help me,</p>
<p>including the doctor that did this to me,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause I lost my insurance.</p>
<p>I get infections every
three to four months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably not gonna live very long.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was there any real discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>of the risks and the side effects and?</p>
<ul>
<li>No, no, there&rsquo;s not.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I know that people want
to think that there is,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The truth is, is that medical
transition is experimental.</p>
<p>We have studies that said
that medical transition</p>
<p>helps mental health, helps
mental health with kids.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all been retracted,
modified, changed.</p>
<p>But the only long-term study
tells us seven to 10 years</p>
<p>is when transgender people
are the most suicidal.</p>
<ul>
<li>After.</li>
<li>After surgery.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that&rsquo;s transphobic to say.</p>
<p>For the first time in history</p>
<p>a marginalized group
has a huge dollar sign</p>
<p>on the top of their head.</p>
<p>We have five children&rsquo;s hospitals</p>
<p>in the United States promoting that.</p>
<ul>
<li>What?</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s a phalloplasty.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bottom surgery.</p>
<p>We have five children&rsquo;s
hospitals in the United States</p>
<p>telling girls that they can
be boys at $70,000 a pop</p>
<p>in a surgery that has
a 67% complication rate</p>
<p>that will kill me from
infection that I can&rsquo;t sue on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re butchering a generation of children</p>
<p>because nobody&rsquo;s willing
to talk about anything.</p>
<p>I have three kids</p>
<p>at the age that they&rsquo;re
doing this to kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not transphobic.</p>
<p>I love my kids and I
love other people&rsquo;s kids.</p>
<p>And you should too.</p>
<p>This is wrong on so many levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can kids consent?</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you think kids are-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capable of consenting to this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a parent is loving
the hell outta your kids</p>
<p>and helping them see around corners.</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s the, what&rsquo;s the youngest patient</li>
</ul>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve operated on?</p>
<ul>
<li>The youngest patient
I&rsquo;ve done vaginal plasty on</li>
</ul>
<p>um, is age 16.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you worry that minors</li>
</ul>
<p>just don&rsquo;t understand
enough about themselves?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not neurologically
developed enough yet</p>
<p>to make permanent life altering decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A young person&rsquo;s self-perception</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>one day they may be clear,</p>
<p>the next day they may be
totally confused and not sure.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re affirming it with hormones</p>
<p>that have never been used in this way.</p>
<p>In the, in the field of medicine.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about puberty blockers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blockers, and then
opposite sex hormones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At what age does the medical transition</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>begin with medication?</p>
<ul>
<li>So medical affirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>begins when the patient
says they&rsquo;re ready for it.</p>
<p>So that could be a, a kiddo</p>
<p>who is just starting puberty and panicking</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re getting breast buds</p>
<p>or their penis is getting
bigger and busier,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re worried about all
kinds of masculine changes.</p>
<p>And that way puberty blockers,</p>
<p>which are completely reversible,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have permanent effects</p>
<p>are wonderful because we can
put that pause on puberty.</p>
<p>Just like if you were to listen in music,</p>
<p>you put the pause on,
and we stop the blockers,</p>
<p>and puberty would go right
back to where it was,</p>
<p>the next note in the song just
delayed that period of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can just pause puberty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No you can&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then pick it up-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No you can&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No you can&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How many studies do they
have, long-term studies</p>
<p>on hormone blockers with children?</p>
<p>None.</p>
<ul>
<li>I just spoke a month or two ago</li>
</ul>
<p>with a mother whose 14-year-old daughter</p>
<p>was put on blockers.</p>
<p>They discovered after two years</p>
<p>this 14-year-old girl has osteoporosis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that like old women get.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can doctors assure parents</li>
</ul>
<p>that a certain medicine is totally safe?</p>
<p>If based on what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t possibly know that.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can they be removing
the healthy breasts</li>
</ul>
<p>of 15-year-old girls?</p>
<p>How can they be sterilizing kids?</p>
<p>How can this whole thing
be happening, Matt?</p>
<ul>
<li>Every child that they
convince is, is transgender</li>
</ul>
<p>and in need of medical transition</p>
<p>it generates 1.3 million to pharma.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re believing a
pharmaceutical company, Lupron,</p>
<p>hormone blockers reversible so they say.</p>
<p>Well, the truth is that
in 2003 Lupron was sued</p>
<p>and deemed a criminal
enterprise by the US government.</p>
<p>They paid the most fine of
any pharmaceutical company</p>
<p>at that time, $874 million, wrote a check.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is Lupron chemical castration?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;re giving it to pedophiles aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re giving it to people that are dying.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re giving it to kids telling them</p>
<p>that they were born in the wrong body</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely safe.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the drugs used is Lupron, right?</li>
</ul>
<p>Which-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has actually been used</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to chemically castrate sex offenders.</p>
<ul>
<li>You know what?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that we should
continue with this interview,</p>
<p>because it seems like it&rsquo;s going-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a particular direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re a medical professional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a medical professional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t wanna talk about the drugs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that you give to kids or?</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, I&rsquo;m a physician
and I use medication.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;re choosing exploitive
words, drugs I give to kids.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m choosing a-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chemical castration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Word that was</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in a dictionary.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s not a correct
term for puberty blocking</li>
</ul>
<p>in a transgender person.</p>
<ul>
<li>I mean I could</li>
</ul>
<p>look it up on my phone,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure if
I looked it up like-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You, you can look it up on your phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It says, &ldquo;Medical definition,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the administration of a drug</p>
<p>to bring about a marked reduction
of the body&rsquo;s production</p>
<p>of androgens and especially testosterone.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>And I&rsquo;m saying as a pediatrician</li>
</ul>
<p>who takes care of hundreds of these kids,</p>
<p>when you use that terminology</p>
<p>you were being malignant and harmful.</p>
<ul>
<li>I mean, there are some who would say</li>
</ul>
<p>that giving chemical drugs to
kids is malignant and harmful.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s about the context
of caring for a child</li>
</ul>
<p>and, and seeing the,
the suffering that kids</p>
<p>can have that have not been an
affirmative home situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you say to the claim that,</li>
</ul>
<p>well, we have to do this for these kids</p>
<p>because if we don&rsquo;t,
they&rsquo;ll kill themselves,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll resort
to drugs and self harm?</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of them were hurting themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of them were suicidal</p>
<p>before they even discovered gender.</p>
<p>That is never part of the discussion.</p>
<p>And they say, what would you rather</p>
<p>have a, a living daughter or a dead son?</p>
<p>If this is what the
professionals are saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible emotional blackmail.</p>
<p>(brooding music)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Man] Hello?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Matt] Hey, is this (beep)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Man] This is yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Matt] Hey it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s Matt Walsh.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you, where are you right now?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Man] I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m in
Vancouver, British Columbia,</li>
</ul>
<p>Canada right now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Matt] Are you, can,
are you able to leave?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Man] I&rsquo;m not able to leave B.C.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even go to another
province in Canada right now.</p>
<p>Uh, and it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m
technically out on bail.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] What happened exactly?</li>
</ul>
<p>(dramatic music)</p>
<p>How exactly did, did this</p>
<p>get into the courts to begin with?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Man] Right, so what happened</li>
</ul>
<p>is we set up a meeting with
B.C. Children&rsquo;s Hospital</p>
<p>and according to the B.C.
Children&rsquo;s Hospital website,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a thorough evaluation.</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m thinking, good.</p>
<p>This is gonna be the end of it all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna clearly see that my child</p>
<p>is not the opposite sex.</p>
<p>So my ex-wife brings my child
into B.C. Children&rsquo;s hospital.</p>
<p>I get a call less than an
hour into that appointment</p>
<p>that they were gonna pump
her full cross-sex hormones</p>
<p>within the hour.</p>
<p>And I put a halt to that.</p>
<p>I said, no.</p>
<p>They agreed to, to stop for the moment.</p>
<p>They figured, well, let&rsquo;s
get the dad on board too.</p>
<p>This is all gonna be better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get everybody on the same page.</p>
<p>I said, it&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>So I get a letter from
B.C. Children&rsquo;s Hospital</p>
<p>in December of 2018,</p>
<p>and it says, &ldquo;That under
the B.C. Infant&rsquo;s Act</p>
<p>they will start injecting my
child with cross-sex hormones,</p>
<p>and I have two weeks to
respond with legal action</p>
<p>if I so choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how I ended up in court</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause I did respond with legal action.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] So you called
your daughter a she,</li>
</ul>
<p>and you, you went to jail for that?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Man] It&rsquo;s considered criminal violence</li>
</ul>
<p>to not use the preferred pronouns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no different than let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>I were to take a broomstick</p>
<p>and whack one of my kids over the head.</p>
<p>So they were treating
it in a similar fashion</p>
<p>that misgendering, mispronouning my child</p>
<p>was the equivalent of family violence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Matt] Is she on the hormone pills now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Man] She is.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The court ordered that she
could do whatever she wanted.</p>
<ul>
<li>2010 until I would say 2016,</li>
</ul>
<p>I would say 80% of my
clients were trans youth.</p>
<p>Now it is you identify, you
take hormones, you do surgery.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t any other pathways.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if you have two parents,</li>
</ul>
<p>one parent wants to
affirm the trans identity,</p>
<p>the other parent doesn&rsquo;t
who wins that battle?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The one who wants to affirm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every single time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to get the
parents to affirm the kid.</p>
<p>(plane engine humming)</p>
<p>(dramatic music)</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a
gender affirming therapist.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s a contradiction in terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t affirm
if you&rsquo;re a therapist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your business to affirm.</p>
<p>You come to see me &lsquo;cause
there&rsquo;s something wrong.</p>
<p>Maybe you come to see me</p>
<p>because a destructive element of you</p>
<p>is wreaking havoc in your life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the side of the part of you</p>
<p>that wants to aim up, man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m on the side of.</p>
<p>Okay, now I don&rsquo;t know what
that means in your case,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna talk about it.</p>
<p>Am I gonna affirm what you think?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not up to me to affirm it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get a casual pat
on the back from a therapist</p>
<p>for your preexisting
axiomatic conclusions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not therapy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a rubber stamp.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is anybody at any point
explaining to these kids</li>
</ul>
<p>the, the, the real long-term consequences</p>
<p>of hormones and puberty blockers?</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re
explaining it to the kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that has frightened me,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s become that we&rsquo;re
even talking to the kids</p>
<p>about it at 10, we&rsquo;re
presenting it in schools.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So this generation, they&rsquo;re
the, they&rsquo;re the lab rats?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biological sex binary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s been binary for like
a hundred million years,</p>
<p>longer than that.</p>
<p>Temperament is not binary,
temperament or personality.</p>
<ul>
<li>So that&rsquo;s gender.</li>
</ul>
<p>Temperament is gender?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, gender&rsquo;s not a good word,</li>
</ul>
<p>because it&rsquo;s vague and
it isn&rsquo;t measurable.</p>
<ul>
<li>So do we need it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can we just say temperament?</p>
<p>What do we even need the word gender for?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But what I would say</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>is that people who talk about
the diversity and gender</p>
<p>are actually talking</p>
<p>about diversity, and
personality, and temperament,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>You can have a masculine
temperament if you&rsquo;re a woman.</p>
<p>Maybe one in 10 women have the
average temperament of a man.</p>
<p>And you can have feminine
men temperamentally.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that uncommon,
because the differences</p>
<p>between men and women
temperamentally aren&rsquo;t that great.</p>
<p>There are masculine girls.</p>
<p>There are feminine boys.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do about that?</p>
<p>Carve them up.</p>
<ul>
<li>You as someone who, who
started your professional life,</li>
</ul>
<p>you know, transgender care.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re sitting here talking to me</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>um, and I&rsquo;m a dangerous
man I&rsquo;ve been told.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you worried about reprisals?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you worried about
how this is gonna be,</p>
<p>how this is gonna play among
your professional peers?</p>
<ul>
<li>I am worried that I
can&rsquo;t have conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>with any other peers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any other peer</p>
<p>that will speak to me around these things.</p>
<p>That question it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think developmentally</p>
<p>this is helpful to our children.</p>
<ul>
<li>You step wrong as the therapist,</li>
</ul>
<p>you say the wrong thing once,</p>
<p>and like your bloody career is over.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s the same with physicians.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that gonna work?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go have
an honest conversation</p>
<p>with your physician when he&rsquo;s
terrified out of his mind</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;ll say something
politically incorrect</p>
<p>during the diagnostic processes.</p>
<p>Hey man, you&rsquo;re sick with
whatever you wanna be.</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
<p>You want a prescription for something.</p>
<ul>
<li>I left academia because the climate</li>
</ul>
<p>had become too stifling politically,</p>
<p>especially when it comes to
the topic of gender identity</p>
<p>and the science of gender</p>
<p>it is absolutely impossible
to do good research.</p>
<p>You basically have to decide beforehand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to find,</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t upset activists.</p>
<p>And that is not how you do science.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why has this shift occurred</li>
</ul>
<p>where all of a sudden gender and sex</p>
<p>have become so politically
and culturally charged?</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a really ugly history</li>
</ul>
<p>between sex researchers
and transgender activists.</p>
<p>In the past if any sex
researcher spoke out</p>
<p>about science that went
against activists orthodoxy,</p>
<p>or particular narratives that
activists wanted to promote,</p>
<p>they would basically have their personal</p>
<p>and professional reputations ruined.</p>
<p>So what you see is that only
experts who tow the party line</p>
<p>and say the things that activists like,</p>
<p>those are the people who get attention.</p>
<p>Those are the people who
get lifted up in the media.</p>
<p>And also, I would say people
are incentivized to go along</p>
<p>with the activist narratives
and gender ideology,</p>
<p>because that helps their career.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trans is very cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trans is a way of, of,
of giving yourself value.</p>
<p>Given the way society at
the moment is functioning.</p>
<p>All of the things that used
to give us anchors of identity</p>
<p>have become very fluid or
very volatile in recent years.</p>
<p>And into that context, I think
what, what you find then is,</p>
<p>is new identities start to, to
fill the void or the vacuum.</p>
<p>Whereas in the past, I might
have got my sense of self-worth</p>
<p>from being part of the
village where I grew up.</p>
<p>Now, I might get my sense of self-worth</p>
<p>through being part of the online community</p>
<p>that I connect with or part of the,</p>
<p>the sexual identity community.</p>
<ul>
<li>So now we are seeing kids</li>
</ul>
<p>that are identifying as
animals going to school,</p>
<p>and they are purring instead
of answering questions</p>
<p>and they meow,</p>
<p>and the teachers are not
allowed to question it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s considered a queer identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you have kids that
are going to school</li>
</ul>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying I&rsquo;m a cat.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the teachers have
to affirm them as a cat?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, so it&rsquo;s not-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So schools are-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just the young ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like literal,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>literal zoos now basically.</p>

<li>They are.</li>

<ul>
<li>I am a 27-year-old transgender woman.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a wolf therian and a
member of the furry fandom.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When and how did you
discover this inner wolfness?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probably around age 10 or 11.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was watching an anime about wolves,</p>
<p>and see the wolf running
across the screen,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m somehow just
intrinsically like, oh, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have you spent any time
around biological wolves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That sounds dangerous also.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What, what context are you?</p>
<ul>
<li>So I was a volunteer with a preserve,</li>
</ul>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve also visited
many wolf preserves.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are you able to
communicate with the wolves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I gonna have a
conversation with the wolf</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in the way that I&rsquo;m
communicating you and I?</p>
<p>Obviously not.</p>
<p>Am I going to read their body language,</p>
<p>respond appropriately to their behaviors</p>
<p>and their nonverbal cues?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you be able, would
you be able to give us</li>
</ul>
<p>an example of this wolf communication?</p>
<ul>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not comfortable doing so.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, all right.</li>
</ul>
<p>How exactly have these
ideas become so pervasive?</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, I think
we need to remember</li>
</ul>
<p>that in the West at least,</p>
<p>we have it drilled into our minds</p>
<p>from childhood onwards
that personal happiness</p>
<p>is the key to individual flourishing.</p>
<p>Secondly, we think of ourselves
in psychological terms.</p>
<p>I am my feelings.</p>
<p>And in order for me to be happy,</p>
<p>I have to be able to express my feelings.</p>
<p>I have to be outwardly</p>
<p>that which I feel myself to be inwardly.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we are taught that interfering</p>
<p>with somebody else&rsquo;s
happiness is very bad.</p>
<p>We need to acknowledge that
there are powerful lobby groups,</p>
<p>powerful cultural and
political lobby groups</p>
<p>driving this thing.</p>
<p>Hollywood is pressing LGBTQ+
matters in so many movies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing it in the way
Amazon sets up its algorithms.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of factors in society</p>
<p>that are pushing what
would really be numerically</p>
<p>a fairly minority interest into being one</p>
<p>of the main political focal
points of this generation.</p>
<p>(dramatic music)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After my operation, I will be a woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t she just be a lesbian?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;Cause she&rsquo;s not a lesbian mom.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She&rsquo;s a boy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because I was born in a girl&rsquo;s body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you kiss me?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Preston] The whole
idea of social contagion,</li>
</ul>
<p>that there could be something
in one social environment</p>
<p>that could play some role
in somebody coming out,</p>
<p>identifying as trans,</p>
<p>would you say that that is
definitely part of your story?</p>
<ul>
<li>When I look back, I don&rsquo;t
think I would&rsquo;ve ever even</li>
</ul>
<p>considered in seeing myself as a boy</p>
<p>without these social aspects.</p>
<p>Especially if I hadn&rsquo;t joined
these online communities.</p>
<p>(fast tempo dramatic music)</p>
<ul>
<li>I identify as non-binary.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll officially be changing
my pronouns to they/them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My pronouns are he/him
and demon/demonself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been going by they/them
pronouns for four years now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty-</p>
<ul>

<p>They!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comfortable with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I use they/them pronouns.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was literally a period</li>
</ul>
<p>of a few weeks to a few months,</p>
<p>I started out as an ally,</p>
<p>and then eventually I starting
to identify as transgender.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Both] We are trans models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So they go on the internet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and they&rsquo;re told that all of
their problems will be solved</p>
<p>if they become a man.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kids are being taught you
might feel like you&rsquo;re a boy</li>
</ul>
<p>even if you have a
vagina and you&rsquo;re a girl,</p>
<p>you are what you feel you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people are girls,
some are boys, some are both,</li>
</ul>
<p>some are neither.</p>
<p>Gender is all about how
we feel on the inside</p>
<p>and how we express ourselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ah, the gender fluid teacher.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I go by in the classroom?</p>
<p>I go by teacher Fambrini.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a queer and trans teacher my agenda</li>
</ul>
<p>is to show little boys
that they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to be like as stereotypically masculine.</p>
<p>That they can like paint
their nails and wear earrings</p>
<p>and like still be a guy,</p>
<p>and like it can be cool.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you worry that there,</li>
</ul>
<p>there could be a sort of social
contagion element of this?</p>
<ul>
<li>A teeny tiny bit, maybe.</li>
</ul>
<p>(dramatic music)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Helena] Looking back on
it was the same pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just kids who were really struggling.</p>
<p>Kids who were very alone and isolated.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Miriam] They have anxiety.</li>
</ul>
<p>They don&rsquo;t fit in with their peers.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know where they belong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe they didn&rsquo;t have
a welcoming family life.</li>
</ul>
<p>They just got caught up in
these communities online.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then they discover, hey,
there&rsquo;s these group of people</li>
</ul>
<p>and they also don&rsquo;t fit in.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not sure who they are.</p>

they haven&rsquo;t fully developed</li>
</ul>
<p>that all you have to do
is medically transition</p>

that is basically saying,</p>
<p>are you okay with the risk
of permanent health effects</p>
<p>that you can never, ever reverse?</p>

<li>Tanner Cross is on administrative leave</li>
</ul>
<p>for what he said about gender identity.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;He would not call a student</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s transgender by
their preferred pronoun.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&rsquo;t lie to children.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, and I gotta also
represent a whole community</p>
<p>that believes in biological
facts and scientific facts.</p>
<p>And I just can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t do that to kids.</p>
<ul>
<li>You get into teaching
because you love kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>This policy started coming into play</p>
<p>and I was like, wait a minute,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s causing me, I&rsquo;m gonna
have to lie to my kids.</p>
<p>The ones I&rsquo;ve always wanted to protect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we have assaults in our bathrooms,</li>
</ul>
<p>in our locker rooms regularly?</p>

we don&rsquo;t have any records</li>

<li>The Virginia Department
of Education says,</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;It is now reviewing whether</p>
<p>the Loudoun County school district</p>
<p>has properly reported
cases of sexual assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This comes after a 15-year-old</p>
<p>was charged on two separate occasions</p>
<p>for assaulting two different
students at different schools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dozens rallying
tonight in Loudoun County</li>
</ul>
<p>to protest the school&rsquo;s policies.</p>
<ul>
<li>So that includes limiting who can talk</li>
</ul>
<p>during public comment
portions of board meetings.</p>
<p>One speaker leased property in the area</p>
<p>just so he could speak tonight.</p>
<p>Fox 5&rsquo;s Perris Jones is
live with the details.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s right, conservative
commentator Matt Walsh told me,</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s leasing out someone&rsquo;s
basement in Loudoun County</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;d be able to speak
during tonight&rsquo;s meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>I decided last week to
fulfill my lifelong dream</li>
</ul>
<p>of being a, um, a Loudoun County resident.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve always felt
like I&rsquo;ve lived in Tennessee.</p>
<p>I felt sort of like a Virginian</p>
<p>trapped in a Tennessean&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>I identify sort of state fluid, I guess.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Reporter] This is
Matt Walsh, he tweeted,</li>
</ul>
<p>how do you do, fellow Virginians?</p>
<ul>
<li>Now I just got explain
to my wife and kids</li>
</ul>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna be staying
in someone&rsquo;s basement.</p>
<p>(brooding music)</p>
<p>They tried to muzzle me by
not allowing me to speak.</p>
<p>And when that didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>they tried to muzzle me with a mask.</p>
<p>I would thank you all</p>
<p>for allowing me to speak to you tonight,</p>
<p>but you try not to
allow it, yet here I am.</p>
<p>Now you only give us 60 seconds,
so let me get to the point.</p>
<p>You are all child abusers.</p>
<p>You prey upon impressionable
children and indoctrinate them</p>
<p>into your insane ideological cult.</p>
<p>A cult, which holds many fanatical views,</p>
<p>but none so deranged as the idea</p>
<p>that boys are girls and girls are boys.</p>
<p>By imposing this vial nonsense on students</p>
<p>to the point even of forcing young girls</p>
<p>to share locker rooms with boys,</p>
<p>you deprive these kids
of safety and privacy,</p>
<p>and something more fundamental
too, which is truth.</p>
<p>If education is not grounded
in truth than it is worthless.</p>
<p>Worse, it is poison.</p>
<p>You are poison.</p>
<p>You are predators.</p>
<p>I can see why you tried
to stop us from speaking,</p>
<p>you know that your ideas are indefensible.</p>
<p>You silence the opposing side
because you have no argument.</p>
<p>You can only hide under your beds,</p>
<p>like pathetic little gutless cowards</p>
<p>hoping we shut up and go away.</p>
<p>But we won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I promise you that.</p>

<p>Johnny&rsquo;s a boy with a big imagination.</p>
<p>One day, he&rsquo;s a dog, the
next day a crustation.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s mom loves her
son&rsquo;s make-believe time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Johnny the Walrus
till you change your mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Matt Walsh is out with
a new children&rsquo;s book.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book is called &ldquo;Johnny the Walrus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What is this about?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It sold out on Amazon in a few hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I have embraced my true calling</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>as a, as a children&rsquo;s author.</p>
<p>Hence the cardigan.</p>
<p>The book is about a little boy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very imaginative and, and playful.</p>
<p>And like I have four kids and
they all have an imagination.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And he likes to pretend
to be different things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And one day he pretends to be a walrus.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, his mother</p>
<p>is, is very progressive and thus confused.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;s convinced by
the internet and by society</p>
<p>that if your child is, is
identifying as something,</p>
<p>then he really is that thing.</p>
<p>And so she tries to raise
her child as a walrus,</p>
<p>as a sort of trans walrus,
respecting his self identity.</p>
<p>One morning, he came downstairs
barking and clapping,</p>
<p>wood spoons for tusks,
and sock fins of flapping.</p>
<p>It spoons in his mouth.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pretending to be a walrus.</p>
<p>(group laughing)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Johnny the Walrus,&rdquo;
he said with a roar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Johnny the Walrus.</li>
</ul>
<p>(speaking in foreign language)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Phil] This is a hot topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Addison] Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Phil] That&rsquo;s a good thing, right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for us to have
these conversations,</p>
<p>so people open their minds
and relearn and unlearn</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;ve been taught.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So I want this to be a safe
place to talk about and learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you can see, there&rsquo;s
an ongoing evolution</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>of language and how people can identify.</p>
<ul>
<li>My next guest author
and conservative host</li>
</ul>
<p>of Daily Wire&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Matt Walsh Show&rdquo;</p>
<p>talking about his recently
published children&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>that has since been removed online</p>
<p>by a popular large retail chain.</p>
<p>Now Matt says, &ldquo;Gender is
not a social construct,</p>
<p>but rooted firmly in biology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True?</p>
<ul>
<li>True.</li>
</ul>
<p>As human beings we have
a sex, male or female,</p>
<p>that is a biological scientific fact.</p>
<p>Now gender is a linguistic term.</p>
<p>Words have gender, people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can have whatever
self-perception you want,</p>
<p>but you can expect me to take
part in that self-perception</p>
<p>or to take part in this kind of charade,</p>
<p>this theatrical production.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get your own pronouns,</p>
<p>just like you don&rsquo;t get
your own prepositions</p>
<p>or your own, your own adjectives.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like,
if I were to tell you,</p>
<p>my adjectives are handsome and brilliant</p>
<p>and no matter whatever
you&rsquo;re talking about me,</p>
<p>you have to describe me
as handsome and brilliant</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how I identify.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s a delusion?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, this is one of the problems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>with this left-wing gender ideology</p>
<p>is that no one who espouses it</p>
<p>can even tell you what these words mean.</p>
<p>Like what is a woman?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well.</li>
<li>Can you tell me</li>
</ul>
<p>what a woman is?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Womanhood is something
that is an umbrella term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It includes people who-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Matt] That describes what?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who identify as a woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s to each their own.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each woman, each man, each person</p>
<p>is gonna have a different relation</p>
<p>with their own gender identity
and define it differently.</p>
<ul>
<li>That, so that&rsquo;s the problem.</li>
<li>You wanna reduce women,</li>
</ul>
<p>you wanna reduce men down to
maybe just their genetics,</p>
<p>our genitals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our chromosomes, right?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What you do is-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we are-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What, you, what you want
to do is appropriate women.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You wanna appropriate womanhood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>And turn it into</li>
</ul>
<p>basically a costume that could be worn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Joining us on stage is Dr. Suzy D&rsquo;Enbeau</li>
</ul>
<p>associate professor at
Kent State University.</p>
<p>Dr. D&rsquo;Enbeau how do you feel</p>
<p>those who oppose using pronouns</p>
<p>are taking the wrong approach
in this conversation?</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s the extreme approach</li>
</ul>
<p>that you are admittedly taking.</p>
<p>Um, and then there&rsquo;s
also just ordinary people</p>
<p>that might not be comfortable
with the language change.</p>
<ul>
<li>She began by saying
that my view is extreme.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so the view that
every single person on earth</p>
<p>has held up until 15
seconds ago is extreme.</p>
<p>They are conflating gender
and sex because on one hand,</p>
<p>they say, well, you got
your biological sex,</p>
<p>but then your gender is
whatever social construct.</p>
<p>But then they turn around</p>
<p>and say that trans women are women.</p>
<p>So a man who, who, who identifies</p>
<p>with the, with the, the gender,</p>
<p>the social construct of
womanhood actually is a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Part of me wants to ask
why you care so much because-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that big of a deal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I answer that?</li>
</ul>
<p>I care about the truth.</p>
<p>So, so basic truth matters.</p>
<p>I wanna live in a society where people-</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, fine.</li>
<li>Care about the truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Um, I care about children
and this, these insane ideas-</p>
<ul>
<li>I do too.</li>
<li>About gender are being,</li>
</ul>
<p>are being foist on kids.</p>
<p>Um, and that, that bothers me quite a bit.</p>
<p>I care about the women</p>
<p>who are having their
opportunities stolen from them.</p>
<p>I care quite a bit, yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted us to have a safe place</li>
</ul>
<p>to be able to talk about this.</p>
<p>And it seems like we should
just keep the dialogue going</p>
<p>and, and hopefully find
some middle ground.</p>
<p>(slow tempo brooding music)</p>
<p>(dramatic music)</p>
<p>(gentle brooding music)</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you say to parents?</li>
</ul>
<p>A parent comes to you and says,</p>
<p>my eight-year-old son is
telling me he&rsquo;s a girl.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, great.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have him do
an experimental procedure</p>
<p>that creates the most suicidal ideation</p>
<p>of any other population</p>
<p>seven to 10 years after,
you know, transition.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I tell parents,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the right to
medically transition your child.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have no research on
long-term hormone use.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be seeing the first generation</p>
<p>of long-term hormone use.</p>
<p>And we already know, at least
with 10 years of hormones</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving yourself cancer.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Matt] What&rsquo;s your message to parents</li>
</ul>
<p>who are trying to cope with this?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Man] The first thing is to tell parents</li>
</ul>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>It is our responsibility as a parent</p>
<p>to be the frontline
defense for our children.</p>
<p>And, and I know with my child,</p>
<p>a lot of people will say, was it worth it</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause you now seemingly
have lost your child?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say, yeah, but at
least I&rsquo;ve saved my conscience,</p>
<p>and my morals, and my convictions.</p>
<p>And when my child turns 25 and says,</p>
<p>Dad, where were you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say I was there.</p>
<p>I was fighting as hard as I could.</p>
<p>I was not prepared to let this happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does this really matter
is, is another question so?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matters for those who are
getting double mastectomies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>when they&rsquo;re 16.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should we care</li>
</ul>
<p>if we live in a society
where gender is fluid?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I cared because
my government decided</li>
</ul>
<p>that I had to call people
by the terms that they were,</p>
<p>that they designated or I&rsquo;d
be subject to legal penalties.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, I&rsquo;m not doing that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what your reason is.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get control of my tongue.</p>
<ul>
<li>We live in a climate now</li>
</ul>
<p>in which no one seems to care</p>
<p>about the safety of women and
girls who are going through</p>
<p>a very developmentally
challenging time in their lives.</p>
<p>They may not want to share
spaces with their male peers.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised in a few years,</p>
<p>there will no longer be women&rsquo;s sports.</p>
<p>It will literally be men&rsquo;s
sports and transgender sports.</p>
<ul>
<li>The question being
asked by the trans person</li>
</ul>
<p>is, is a legitimate
one, how can I be happy?</p>
<p>The answer being given by
having my body transformed</p>
<p>to look like the other gender,</p>
<p>by having myself pumped full of hormones,</p>
<p>clearly isn&rsquo;t working,</p>
<p>and we have to find a better</p>
<p>and the more humane way of
dealing with individuals</p>
<p>who are struggling with gender dysphoria.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have the utmost compassion</li>
</ul>
<p>for people who suffer
from gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nightmare for
them and their families.</p>
<p>The vast majority, up to 90% of kids</p>
<p>if they go through a normal
puberty, they&rsquo;re gonna be okay.</p>
<p>They will be at peace with their bodies,</p>
<p>and they will have avoided dangerous</p>
<p>and experimental medical
interventions and surgeries.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Man] Maybe we&rsquo;re up
against a battle here</li>
</ul>
<p>up against a hill that perhaps,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re not gonna
necessarily win today,</p>
<p>but if we don&rsquo;t pave the way for a win,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll never get there.</p>
<ul>
<li>So we&rsquo;re going on this journey,</li>
</ul>
<p>boys can be girls, girls can be boys,</p>
<p>men can be women, women can be men.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder what, what is a woman?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a woman?</li>
</ul>
<p>A woman is someone who claims
that is their identity.</p>
<p>It could be many things to many people.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the question really brings up</li>
</ul>
<p>the, the fact that it is
pretty relative, right?</p>
<p>That if you ask women across
race, across identities,</p>
<p>across class, across culture,</p>
<p>you will get a different answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of it is, you
know, based on biology,</li>
</ul>
<p>some of it is based on hormones.</p>
<p>Some of it, it is based on what you wear</p>
<p>and, and how you present yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman is not anything in particular.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s no one particular thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is not one particular thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A woman is someone who
says that she is a woman</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and transitions to be a woman.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who says that she&rsquo;s what?</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you define the word woman
without using the word woman?</p>
<ul>
<li>I mean that&rsquo;s actually kind of like,</li>
</ul>
<p>it&rsquo;s a curious question, but I.</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve been journeying across the country</li>
</ul>
<p>asking people this question,</p>
<p>and almost nobody can answer it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is a woman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Matt] What is a woman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marry one and find out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So I should go home
and ask my wife, I guess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah.
(gentle music)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(plane engine humming)</p>
<p>(water splashing)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;ve been meaning
to ask you something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a woman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An adult human female who
needs help opening this?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(gentle upbeat music)</p>
<p>(lid pops)</p>
<p>(slow tempo gentle music)</p>
<p>(Matt chuckles)</p>
<p>(upbeat music)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can you provide a
definition for the word woman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I provide a definition?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mm-hmm, yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can&rsquo;t?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not in this-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So you believe-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a biologist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The meaning of the word</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>woman is so unclear and controversial</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t give me a definition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Senator, in my work as a judge,</li>
</ul>
<p>what I do is I address disputes.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a dispute about a definition,</p>
<p>people make arguments,</p>
<p>and I look at the law-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I decide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that you can&rsquo;t
give me a straight answer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>about something as
fundamental as what a woman is</p>
<p>underscores the dangers of the
kind of progressive education</p>
<p>that we are hearing about.</p>
<p>Just last week, an entire
generation of young girls</p>
<p>watched as our taxpayer
funded institutions,</p>
<p>permitted a biological man</p>
<p>to compete and beat a biological woman</p>
<p>in the NCAA swimming championships.</p>
<p>What message do you
think this sends to girls</p>
<p>who aspire to compete and win in sports</p>
<p>at the highest levels?</p>
<ul>
<li>Senator, I&rsquo;m not sure
what message that sends.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, if you&rsquo;re asking me</p>
<p>about the legal issues related to it,</p>
<p>those are topics that are
being hotly discussed,</p>
<p>as you say, and-</p>
<ul>
