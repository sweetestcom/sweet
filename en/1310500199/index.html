    <p>The following is a conversation with Clara Souza Silva, a quantum astrochemist at Harvard</p>
<p>specializing in spectroscopy of gases that serve as possible signs of life on other planets,</p>
<p>most especially the gas phosphine.</p>
<p>She was a coauthor of the paper that in 2020 found that there is phosphine in the atmosphere</p>
<p>of Venus and, thus, possible extraterrestrial life that lives in its atmosphere.</p>
<p>The detection of phosphine was challenged, reaffirmed, and is now still under active</p>
<p>research.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Onnit, Grammarly, Blinkist, and Indeed.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I think the search for life on other planets is one of</p>
<p>the most important endeavors in science.</p>
<p>If we find extraterrestrial life and study it, we may find insights into the mechanisms</p>
<p>that originated life here on Earth, and more than life, the mechanisms that originated</p>
<p>intelligence and consciousness.</p>
<p>If we understand these mechanisms, we can build them.</p>
<p>But more than this, the discovery of life on other planets means that our galaxy and</p>
<p>our universe is teeming with life.</p>
<p>This is humbling and terrifying, but it is also exciting.</p>
<p>We humans are natural explorers.</p>
<p>For most of our history, we explored the surface of the Earth and the contents of our minds.</p>
<p>But now, with spacefaring vessels, we have a chance to explore life beyond Earth, their</p>
<p>physics, their biology, and perhaps the contents of their minds.</p>
<p>This is the Lux Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Clara Souza Silva.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;re the world expert in, well, in many things, but one of them is phosphine,</p>
<p>would it technically be correct to call you the queen of phosphine?</p>
<p>I go for Dr. Phosphine.</p>
<p>Queen is an inherited title, I feel.</p>
<p>But you still rule by love and power, so, but while having the doctor title, I got it.</p>
<p>Kindness.</p>
<p>In September 2020, you coauthored a paper announcing possible presence of phosphine</p>
<p>in the atmosphere of Venus, and that it may be a signature of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Big maybe.</p>
<p>There was some pushback, of course, from the scientific community that followed, friendly,</p>
<p>loving pushback.</p>
<p>Then in January, another paper from University of Wisconsin, I believe, confirmed the finding.</p>
<p>So where do we stand in this saga, in this mystery of what the heck is going on, on Venus</p>
<p>in terms of phosphine and in terms of aliens?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to break it down.</p>
<p>The short answer is we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think you and the rest of the public are now witnessing a pretty exciting discovery,</p>
<p>but as it evolves, as it unfolds, we did not wait until we had, you know, years of</p>
<p>data from 10 different instruments across several layers of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>We waited until we had two telescopes with independent data months apart, but still,</p>
<p>the data is weak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s noisy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delicate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much at the edge of instrument sensitivity, sensitivity, and so we still don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>if it is phosphine.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even really know if the signal is real.</p>
<p>People still disagree about that.</p>
<p>I think at the more philosophical end of how this happened, I think it is a distinction,</p>
<p>and myself and other coauthors were talking about this, it&rsquo;s a distinction between hypothesis</p>
<p>generation and hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>Now hypothesis testing is something that I think is the backbone of the scientific method,</p>
<p>but it has a problem, which is if you&rsquo;re looking through very noisy data and you want to test</p>
<p>the hypothesis, you may by mistake create a spurious signal.</p>
<p>The safest, more conservative approach is hypothesis generation.</p>
<p>You see some data and you go, what&rsquo;s in there?</p>
<p>With no bias.</p>
<p>Now this is much safer, much more conservative, and when there&rsquo;s a lot of data, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>When there isn&rsquo;t, you can clean the noise and take out the signal with it.</p>
<p>The signal with a bath water, whatever the equivalent of the analogy would be.</p>
<p>And so I think the healthy discourse that you described is exactly this.</p>
<p>There are ways of processing the data, completely legitimate ways, checked by multiple people</p>
<p>and experts where the signal shows up and then phosphine is in the atmosphere of Venus,</p>
<p>and some where it doesn&rsquo;t, and then we disagree what that signal means.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s real and it is an ambiguously phosphine, it is very exciting because we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to explain it without life, but going from there to Venusians is still a huge jump.</p>
<p>And so&hellip;</p>
<p>Venusians.</p>
<p>So that would be the title for the civilization, if it is a living and thriving on Venus&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Venusians.</p>
<p>Until we know what they call themselves and that&rsquo;s the name, yes.</p>
<p>So this is the early analysis of data or analysis of early data.</p>
<p>It was nevertheless, you waited until the actual peer reviewed publication to know?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And analysis of the two different instruments months apart.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s ALMA and JCMT, the two telescopes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s still, I mean, it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>What did it feel like sort of sitting on this data?</p>
<p>Like kind of anticipating the publication and wondering and still wondering, is it true?</p>
<p>Like how does it make you feel that a planet in our solar system might have phosphine in</p>
<p>the atmosphere?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nuts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely nuts.</p>
<p>I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>In the best possible way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on phosphine for over a decade.</p>
<p>Before it was cool.</p>
<p>Way before it was cool.</p>
<p>Before anyone could spell it or heard of it.</p>
<p>And at the time people either didn&rsquo;t know what phosphine was or only knew it for being</p>
<p>just possibly the most horrendous molecule that ever graced the earth.</p>
<p>And so no one was a fan.</p>
<p>And I had been considering looking for it because I did think it was an unusual and</p>
<p>disgusting but very promising sign of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for it everywhere.</p>
<p>I really didn&rsquo;t think to look in the solar system.</p>
<p>I thought it was all pretty rough around here for life.</p>
<p>And so I wasn&rsquo;t even considering the solar system at all, never mind next door Venus.</p>
<p>It was only the lead author of the study, Jane Greaves, who thought to look in the clouds</p>
<p>of Venus and then reached out to me to say, I don&rsquo;t know phosphine but I know it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>How weird is it?</p>
<p>And the answer is very weird.</p>
<p>And so the telescopes we&rsquo;re looking at, this is visual data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean by visual.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t see the phosphine.</p>
<p>Well, but I mean it&rsquo;s a telescope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remote.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re observing, you&rsquo;re what zooming in on this particular planet and what does the sensor</p>
<p>actually look like?</p>
<p>How many pixels are there?</p>
<p>What does the data kind of look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice to kind of build up intuition of how little data we have based on which,</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at like, I&rsquo;ve just been reading a lot about gravitational waves and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of incredible how from just very little, like probably the world&rsquo;s most precise</p>
<p>instrument, we can derive some very foundational ideas about our early universe.</p>
<p>And in that same way, it&rsquo;s kind of incredible how much data, how much information you can</p>
<p>get from just a few pixels.</p>
<p>So what are we talking about here in terms of based on which this paper saw possible</p>
<p>signs of phosphine in the atmosphere?</p>
<p>So phosphine, like every other molecule has a unique spectroscopic fingerprint, meaning</p>
<p>it rotates and it vibrates in special ways.</p>
<p>I calculated how many of those ways it can rotate and vibrate, 16.8 billion ways.</p>
<p>What this means is that if you look at the spectrum of light and that light has gone</p>
<p>through phosphine gas on the other end, there should be 16.8 billion tiny marks left, indentations</p>
<p>left in that spectrum.</p>
<p>We found one of those on Venus, one of those 16.8 billion.</p>
<p>So now the game is, can we find any of the other ones?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re really hard to spot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all in terrible places in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>And the instruments we use to find this one can&rsquo;t really find any other one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another one of the 16.8 billion we could find, but it would take many, many days</p>
<p>of continuous observations and that&rsquo;s not really in the cards right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of noise, first of all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of other signal.</p>
<p>So how do you separate all of that out to pull out just this particular signature that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>associated with phosphine?</p>
<p>So the data kind of looks somewhat like a wave and a lot of that is noise and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>baseline.</p>
<p>And so if you can figure out the exact shape of the wave, you can cancel that shape out</p>
<p>and you should be left with a straight line and if there&rsquo;s something there, an absorption,</p>
<p>so a signal.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>We tried to find out what was this baseline shape, cleaned it out and got the signal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the problem.</p>
<p>If you do this wrong, you can create a signal.</p>
<p>But that signal is at 8.904 wave numbers and we actually have more digits than that, but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember by heart.</p>
<p>And ALMA in particular is a very, very good telescope, array of telescopes and it can</p>
<p>focus on exactly that frequency.</p>
<p>And in that frequency, there are only two known molecules that absorb it all.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how we do it.</p>
<p>We look at that exact spot where we know phosphine absorbs the other molecules SO2.</p>
<p>If there is extraterrestrial life, whether it&rsquo;s on Venus or on exoplanets where you</p>
<p>looked before, how does that make you feel?</p>
<p>How should it make us feel?</p>
<p>Should we be scared?</p>
<p>Should we be excited?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s not intelligent life.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s microbial life.</p>
<p>Is it a threat to us?</p>
<p>Are we a threat to it?</p>
<p>Or is it only, not only, but mostly a possibility to understand something fundamental, something</p>
<p>beautiful about life in the universe?</p>
<p>Hard to know.</p>
<p>You would have to bring on a poet or a philosopher on the show.</p>
<p>I feel those things.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know if those are the right things to feel.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t feel scared.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s rather silly to feel scared.</p>
<p>Definitely don&rsquo;t touch them.</p>
<p>Sometimes in movies, don&rsquo;t go near it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t interfere.</p>
<p>I think one of the things with Venus is because of phosphine, now there is a chance that Venus</p>
<p>is inhabited.</p>
<p>And in that case, we shouldn&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>We should be very careful with messing with them, bringing our own stuff there that contaminates</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And Venus has suffered enough.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s life there, it&rsquo;s probably the remains of a living planet, the very last survivors</p>
<p>of what once was potentially a thriving world.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t want our first interaction with alien life to be a massacre.</p>
<p>So I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t want to go near out of a, let&rsquo;s say, galactic responsibility,</p>
<p>galactic ethics.</p>
<p>And I often think of alien astronomers watching us and how disappointed they would be if we</p>
<p>messed this up.</p>
<p>So I really want to be very careful with anything that could be life.</p>
<p>But certainly I wouldn&rsquo;t be scared.</p>
<p>Humans are plenty capable of killing one another.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need extraterrestrial help to destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>Scared mostly of other humans.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But these, this life, if there is life there, it does seem just like you said, it would</p>
<p>be pretty rugged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the cockroaches or Chuck Norris, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, some kind of, it&rsquo;s something that survived through some very difficult conditions.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean it would handle us, you know, it could be like war of the worlds.</p>
<p>You come, just because you&rsquo;re resilient in your own planet doesn&rsquo;t mean you can survive</p>
<p>another.</p>
<p>The extremophiles, which are very impressive, we should all be very proud of our extremophiles.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t really make it in the Venusian clouds.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t expect, because you&rsquo;re tough, even Chuck Norris tough, that you would survive</p>
<p>on an alien planet.</p>
<p>And then from the scientific perspective, you don&rsquo;t want to pollute the data gathering</p>
<p>process by showing up there.</p>
<p>The observer can affect the observed.</p>
<p>How heartbreaking would it be if we found life on another planet and then we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, we brought it with us.</p>
<p>It was my sandwich.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s always the problem, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly a problem with Mars because we&rsquo;ve visited the, if there is life on Mars</p>
<p>or like remains of life on Mars, it&rsquo;s always going to be a question of like, well, maybe</p>
<p>we planted it there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not do the same with Venus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder because when we try to go to Venus, things melt very quickly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little harder to pollute Venus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good at destroying foreigners.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, in terms of Elon Musk and terraforming planets, Mars is stop number one, then Venus</p>
<p>maybe after that.</p>
<p>So can we talk about phosphine a little bit?</p>
<p>So you mentioned it&rsquo;s a pretty&hellip;</p>
<p>Love talking about phosphine.</p>
<p>Love phosphine.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your Twitter handle?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Dr. Phosphine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Dr. Phosphine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You will be surprised here.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t taken already.</p>
<p>I just grabbed it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to buy it off anyone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s phosphine?</p>
<p>You already mentioned it&rsquo;s pretty toxic and troublesome and outside, troublesome, sorry.</p>
<p>No, I love it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stop calling it troublesome.</p>
<p>So maybe what are some things that make it interesting chemically and why is it a good</p>
<p>sign of life when it&rsquo;s present in the atmosphere?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve described in your paper, aptly titled the phosphine as a biosignature gas</p>
<p>in exoplanet atmospheres.</p>
<p>I suppose you wrote that paper before Venus.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>And no one cared.</p>
<p>In that paper, I said something like, if we find phosphine on any terrestrial planet can</p>
<p>only mean life.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s like, yeah, that sounds about right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>And then Venus shows up and I was like, are you sure?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I was sure before I was sure.</p>
<p>Now that it&rsquo;s right here, I&rsquo;m less sure now that my claims are being tested.</p>
<p>So phosphine, phosphine is a fascinating molecule.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s shaped like a pyramid with a phosphorus up top and then three hydrogens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite a simple molecule in many ways and you know, it&rsquo;s the most popular elements</p>
<p>in the universe, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur.</p>
<p>When you add hydrogen to them, it makes quite simple, quite famous molecules.</p>
<p>You do it to oxygen, you get water, you do it to carbon, you get methane, you do it to</p>
<p>nitrogen, you get ammonia.</p>
<p>These are all molecules people have heard of, but you do it to phosphorus, you get phosphine.</p>
<p>People haven&rsquo;t heard of phosphine because it&rsquo;s not really popular on earth.</p>
<p>You really shouldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere on earth because it is extremely toxic to life.</p>
<p>It interacts with oxygen metabolism and everything you know and love uses oxygen metabolism and</p>
<p>it interacts fatally.</p>
<p>So it kills in several very imaginative and very macabre ways.</p>
<p>So it was used as a chemical warfare agent in the first world war and most recently by</p>
<p>ISIS.</p>
<p>So really bad.</p>
<p>Most life avoids it.</p>
<p>Even life that might not avoid it, so life that doesn&rsquo;t use oxygen metabolism, anaerobic</p>
<p>life still has to put crazy amounts of effort into making it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really difficult molecule to make, thermodynamically speaking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult to make that phosphorus want to be together with that hydrogen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>Everyone avoids it.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re not avoiding it, it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to make.</p>
<p>You would have to put energy in, sacrifice energy to make it.</p>
<p>And if you did go through all that trouble and made it, it gets reacted with the radicals</p>
<p>in the atmosphere and gets destroyed.</p>
<p>So we shouldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere and yet we do.</p>
<p>This is kind of weird molecule that seems to be made by life and we don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>why.</p>
<p>Life clearly finds a use for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only molecule that life is willing to sacrifice energy to make, but we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how or why life is even making it.</p>
<p>So absolutely mysterious, absolutely deadly, smells horrifically.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s made, it produces other kind of diphosphenes and it&rsquo;s been reported as smelling</p>
<p>like garlicky, fishy death.</p>
<p>Once someone referred to it as smelling like the, let me see if I remember, the rancid</p>
<p>diapers of the spawn of Satan.</p>
<p>Oh, very nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, very vivid.</p>
<p>And so&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a poet after all.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t call it that, someone else did.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just this horrific molecule, but it is produced by life.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>And when it is produced by life, it&rsquo;s done with enormous sacrifice and the universe does</p>
<p>not sacrifice, life sacrifices.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this strange, contradictory molecule that we should all be avoiding and yet seems</p>
<p>to be an almost an ambiguous sign of life on rocky planets.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can we dig into that a little bit?</p>
<p>So on rocky planets, is there biological mechanisms that can produce it?</p>
<p>You said that why is unclear, why life might produce it, but is there an understanding</p>
<p>of what kind of mechanisms might be able to produce it, this very difficult to produce</p>
<p>molecule?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>The enzymatic pathways of phosphine production by life are not yet known.</p>
<p>This is not actually as surprising as it might sound.</p>
<p>I think something like 80% of all the natural products that we know of, so we know biology</p>
<p>makes them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how.</p>
<p>It is much easier to know life produces something because you can put bacteria in a Petri dish</p>
<p>and then watch and then that gas is produced, you go, oh, life made it.</p>
<p>That actually happened with phosphine.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s much easier to do of course, than figuring out what is the exact metabolic pathway</p>
<p>within that life form that created this molecule.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>Phosphine is really understudied.</p>
<p>No one had really heard of it until nowish.</p>
<p>What you were presenting is the fact that life produces phosphine, not the process by</p>
<p>which it produces phosphine.</p>
<p>Is there an urgency now?</p>
<p>Like if you were to try to understand the mechanisms, the, what did you call them, enzymatic</p>
<p>pathways that produce phosphine, how difficult is that of a problem to crack?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, even the scent of truffles, obviously a billion dollar industry, huge</p>
<p>deal.</p>
<p>Until quite recently, it wasn&rsquo;t known exactly how those scents, those molecules that create</p>
<p>this incredible smell were produced.</p>
<p>This is a billion dollar industry.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, there is no such pressure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no phosphine lobby or anything that would push for this research, but I hope someone</p>
<p>picks it up and does it.</p>
<p>And it isn&rsquo;t crazy because we know that phosphine is really hard to make.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s really hard for it to happen accidentally.</p>
<p>Even lightning and volcanoes that can produce small amounts of phosphine, it&rsquo;s extremely</p>
<p>difficult for even these extreme processes to make it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not really surprising that only life can do it because life is willing to make</p>
<p>things at a cost.</p>
<p>So maybe on the topic of phosphine, what, again, you&rsquo;ve gotten yourself into trouble.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask you all these high level poetic questions.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>No, I would love it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love with phosphine?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t love at first sight.</p>
<p>It was somewhere between a long relationship and Stockholm syndrome.</p>
<p>When I first started my PhD, I knew I wanted to learn about molecular spectra and how to</p>
<p>simulate it.</p>
<p>I thought it was really outrageous that we as a species couldn&rsquo;t detect molecules remotely.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have this perfect catalog ready of the molecular fingerprint of every molecule</p>
<p>we may want to find in the universe.</p>
<p>And something as basic as phosphine, the fact that we didn&rsquo;t really know how it interacted</p>
<p>with light and so we couldn&rsquo;t detect it properly in the galaxy, I was so indignant.</p>
<p>And so initially I just started working on phosphine because people hadn&rsquo;t before.</p>
<p>And I thought we should know what phosphine looks like and that was it.</p>
<p>And then I read every paper that&rsquo;s ever been published about phosphine.</p>
<p>It was quite easy because there aren&rsquo;t that many.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I started learning about where we had already found it in the universe and</p>
<p>what it meant.</p>
<p>I started finding out quite how little we know about it and why.</p>
<p>And it was only when I joined MIT and I started talking to biochemists that it became clear</p>
<p>that phosphine wasn&rsquo;t just weird and special and understudied and disgusting.</p>
<p>It was all these things for oxygen loving life.</p>
<p>And it was the anaerobic world that would welcome phosphine and that&rsquo;s when the idea</p>
<p>of looking for it on other planets became crystallized.</p>
<p>Because oxygen is very powerful and very important on Earth but that&rsquo;s not necessarily going</p>
<p>to be the case on other exoplanets.</p>
<p>Most planets are oxygen poor, overwhelmingly most planets are oxygen poor.</p>
<p>And so finding the sign of life that would be welcomed by everything that would live</p>
<p>without oxygen on Earth seemed so cool.</p>
<p>But ultimately the project at first was born out of the idea that you want to find that</p>
<p>molecular fingerprint of a molecule.</p>
<p>And this is just one example.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s connected to then looking for that fingerprint elsewhere in a remote way.</p>
<p>And obviously that then at that time where exoplanets already, when you were doing your</p>
<p>PhD, and by the way you should say your PhD thesis was on phosphine.</p>
<p>It was all on phosphine, 100% on phosphine with a little bit of ammonia.</p>
<p>I have a chapter that I did where I talked about phosphine and ammonia.</p>
<p>But no, phosphine was very much my thesis.</p>
<p>But at that time when you&rsquo;re writing it there&rsquo;s already a sense that exoplanets are out there</p>
<p>and we might be able to be looking for biosignatures on those exoplanets?</p>
<p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>I did my PhD in 2015.</p>
<p>We found the first exoplanets in the kind of mid to late 90s.</p>
<p>So exoplanets were known.</p>
<p>It was known that some had atmospheres and from there it&rsquo;s not a big jump to think, well,</p>
<p>if some have atmospheres, some of those might be habitable and some of those may be inhabited.</p>
<p>So how do you detect, you started to talk about it, but can we linger on it?</p>
<p>How do you detect phosphine on a faraway thing, rocky thing, rocky planet?</p>
<p>What is spectroscopy?</p>
<p>What is this molecular fingerprint?</p>
<p>What does it look like?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned the wave, but what are we supposed to think about?</p>
<p>What are the tools?</p>
<p>What are the uncertainties?</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So the path can go this way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got light, kind of pure light.</p>
<p>You can crack that light open with a prism or a spectroscope or water and make a rainbow.</p>
<p>That rainbow is all the colors and all the invisible colors, the ultraviolet, the infrared.</p>
<p>And if that light was truly pure, you could consider that rainbow to just cover continuously</p>
<p>all of these colors.</p>
<p>But if that light goes through a gas, we may not see that gas.</p>
<p>We certainly cannot see the molecules within that gas, but those molecules will steal,</p>
<p>absorb some of that light, some, but not all.</p>
<p>Each molecule absorbs only very specific colors of that rainbow.</p>
<p>And so if you know, for example, that shade of green can only be absorbed by methane,</p>
<p>then you can watch.</p>
<p>As a planet passes in front of a star, the planet&rsquo;s too far away, you can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>And it has an atmosphere.</p>
<p>That atmosphere is far too small, you definitely can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>But the sunlight will go through that atmosphere.</p>
<p>And if that atmosphere is methane, then on the other side, that shade of blue, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember if I said blue or green, that color will be missing because methane took it.</p>
<p>And so with phosphine, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It has specific colors, 16.8 billion colors that it absorbs it and nothing else does.</p>
<p>And so if you can find them and notice them missing from the light of a star that went</p>
<p>through a planet&rsquo;s atmosphere, then you&rsquo;ll know that atmosphere contains the molecule.</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So you can have this fingerprint within the space of colors and there&rsquo;s a lot of molecules.</p>
<p>And I mean, I wonder, that&rsquo;s a question of like how much overlap there is.</p>
<p>How close can you get to the actual fingerprint?</p>
<p>Like can phosphine unlock the iPhone with its lights on?</p>
<p>You said 16.8 billion, so presumably this rainbow is discretized into little segments</p>
<p>somehow.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>How many total are there?</p>
<p>How a lot is 16.8 billion?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the instruments to break these, break any light into this many tiny segments.</p>
<p>And so with the instruments we do have, there&rsquo;s huge amounts of overlap.</p>
<p>As an example, a lot of the ways it&rsquo;s detectable is because the carbon and the hydrogens, they</p>
<p>vibrate with one another, they move, they interact.</p>
<p>But every other hydrocarbon, acetylene, isoprene has carbon and hydrogens also vibrating and</p>
<p>rotating.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s actually very hard to tell them apart at low resolutions and our instruments</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really cope with distinguishing between molecules particularly well.</p>
<p>But in an ideal world, if we had infinite resolution, then yes, every molecule&rsquo;s spectral</p>
<p>features will be unique.</p>
<p>Yeah, like almost too unique, like it would be too trivial.</p>
<p>At the quantum level, they&rsquo;re unique.</p>
<p>At our level, there&rsquo;s huge overlap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you can start to then try to disambiguate the fact that certain colors are missing,</p>
<p>what does that mean?</p>
<p>And hopefully they&rsquo;re missing in a certain kind of pattern where you can say with some</p>
<p>kind of probability, there&rsquo;s this gas, not this gas.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re solving that gaseous puzzle.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We can go back to Venus actually and show that.</p>
<p>So with this, I mentioned those two molecules that could be responsible for that signal,</p>
<p>the resolution that we have.</p>
<p>It was phosphine and SO2, sulfur dioxide.</p>
<p>And that resolution could really be one of the other, but in the same bandwidth, so in</p>
<p>the kind of the same observations, there was another region where phosphine does not absorb,</p>
<p>we know that, but SO2 does.</p>
<p>So we just went and checked and there was no signal.</p>
<p>So we thought, oh, then it must be phosphine.</p>
<p>And then we submitted the paper.</p>
<p>The rest is history.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s beautifully told.</p>
<p>Is there, so the telescopes we&rsquo;re talking about are sitting on earth.</p>
<p>What can it help solving this fingerprint, molecular fingerprint problem if we do a flyby?</p>
<p>Does it help if you get closer and closer or are telescopes pretty damn good for this</p>
<p>kind of puzzle solving?</p>
<p>Telescopes are pretty good, but the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is a pain.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m very thankful for it, but it does interrupt a lot of measurements and a lot</p>
<p>of regions where phosphine would be active, they are not available.</p>
<p>The earth is not transparent in those wavelengths.</p>
<p>So being above the atmosphere would make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Then proximity matters a lot less, but just escaping the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere would be wonderful.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s really hard to stay very stable and if there is phosphine on Venus, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very little of it in the clouds.</p>
<p>And so the signal is very weak and the telescopes we can use on earth are much bigger and much</p>
<p>more stable.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit of a trade off.</p>
<p>So is it, are you comfortable with this kind of remote observation?</p>
<p>Is it at all helpful to strive for going over to Venus and like grabbing a scoop of the</p>
<p>atmosphere or is remote observation really a powerful tool for this kind of job?</p>
<p>Like the scoop is not necessary.</p>
<p>Well a lot of people want to scoop, I get it.</p>
<p>I get it completely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my natural inclination, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to scoop specifically because if it is life, I want to know everything I</p>
<p>can remotely before I interfere.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my, I&rsquo;ve got ethical reasons against the scoop more than engineering reasons against</p>
<p>the scoop.</p>
<p>But I have some engineering reasons against the scoop.</p>
<p>Scoop is not a technical term, but I feel like now it&rsquo;s too late to take it back.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand the clouds well enough to plan the scoop very well.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not that saturated, like there&rsquo;s not that much of it present.</p>
<p>No, and the place is nasty.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not going to be easy to build something that can do the task reliably and</p>
<p>can be trusted, the measurements can be trusted and then pass that message on.</p>
<p>So actually I&rsquo;m for an orbiter.</p>
<p>I think we should have orbiters around every solar system body whose job is just to learn</p>
<p>about these places.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed we haven&rsquo;t already got an orbiter around every single one of them.</p>
<p>A small, it can be a small satellite.</p>
<p>Getting data, figuring out, you know, how do the clouds move?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in them?</p>
<p>How often is there lightning and volcanic activity?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the topography?</p>
<p>Is it changing?</p>
<p>Is there a biosphere actively doing things?</p>
<p>We should be monitoring this from afar.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m for over the atmosphere, hopefully around Venus, that would be, that would be</p>
<p>my choice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So now recently Venus is all exciting about a phosphine and everything.</p>
<p>Is there other stuff maybe before we were looking at Venus or now looking out into other</p>
<p>solar systems?</p>
<p>Is there other promising exoplanets or other planets within the solar system that might</p>
<p>have phosphine or might have other strong biosignatures that we should be looking for</p>
<p>like phosphine?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few, but outside the solar system, all are kind of promising candidates.</p>
<p>We know so little about them.</p>
<p>For most of them, we barely know their density.</p>
<p>Most of them, we don&rsquo;t even know if they have an atmosphere, nevermind what that atmosphere</p>
<p>might contain.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re still very much at the stage where we have detected promising planets, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>promising in that they&rsquo;re about the right size, about the right density.</p>
<p>They could have an atmosphere and they&rsquo;re about the right distance from their host star.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really all we know.</p>
<p>Near future telescopes will tell us much more, but for now we&rsquo;re just guessing.</p>
<p>So you said near future, so there&rsquo;s hope that there&rsquo;ll be telescopes that can see that far</p>
<p>enough to determine if there&rsquo;s an atmosphere and perhaps even the contents of that atmosphere?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>JWST, launching later this year, will be able to get a very rough sense of the main atmospheric</p>
<p>constituents of planets that could potentially be habitable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s this year.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name?</p>
<p>JWST, the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be out in space, past the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to be said about the engineering aspect of the telescope?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an incredible beast, but it&rsquo;s a beast of many burdens.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to do, it&rsquo;s going to.</p>
<p>See, you are a poet.</p>
<p>You are, yeah.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>This is very eloquent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re speaking to the audience, which I appreciate.</p>
<p>So yeah, so it&rsquo;s a giant engineering project and is it orbiting something, do you know?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be above the atmosphere and it will be doing lots of different astrophysics.</p>
<p>And so some of its time will be dedicated to exoplanets, but there&rsquo;s an entire astronomy</p>
<p>field fighting for time before the cryogenic lifetime of the instrument.</p>
<p>And so when I was looking for the possibility of finding phosphine on distant exoplanets,</p>
<p>I used JWST as a way of checking with this instrument that we will launch later this</p>
<p>year, could we detect phosphine on an oxygen poor planet?</p>
<p>And there I put very much a hard stop where some of my simulation said, yes, you can totally</p>
<p>do it, but it will take a little under the cryogenic lifetime of this machine.</p>
<p>So then I had to go, well, that&rsquo;s not going to, no one&rsquo;s going to dedicate all of JWST</p>
<p>to look for my molecule that no one cared about.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re very much at that edge, but there&rsquo;ll be many other telescopes in the coming decades</p>
<p>that will be able to tell us quite a lot about the atmospheres of potentially habitable planets.</p>
<p>So you mentioned simulation.</p>
<p>This is super interesting to me.</p>
<p>And this perhaps could be a super dumb question, but I think I haven&rsquo;t been able to, I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been able to prove you wrong on that one.</p>
<p>You simulate molecules to understand how they look from a distance is what I understand.</p>
<p>Like what does that simulation look like?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s talking about which colors that the rainbow will be missing.</p>
<p>Is that the goal of the simulation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal, but it&rsquo;s really just a very, very nasty Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a quantum simulation.</p>
<p>Oh, so it&rsquo;s simulating at the quantum level.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a quantum astrochemist.</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Clara.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a quantum astrochemist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we should have started this conversation.</p>
<p>Can you describe the three components of that quantum astro and chemist and how they interplay</p>
<p>together?</p>
<p>So I study the quantum behavior of molecules, hence the quantum and the chemist specifically</p>
<p>so I can detect them in space, hence the astro.</p>
<p>So what I do is I figure out the probability of a molecule being in a particular state.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no deterministic nature to the work I do, so it&rsquo;s every transition is just a likelihood.</p>
<p>But if you get a population of that molecule, it will always happen.</p>
<p>And so this is all at the quantum level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Schrodinger equation on, I think, 27 dimensions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember it by heart.</p>
<p>And what this means is I&rsquo;m solving these giant quantum matrices.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you need a lot of computer power, giant computers, to diagonalize these</p>
<p>enormous matrices, each of whom describes a single vibrational behavior of a molecule.</p>
<p>So I think phosphine has 17.5 million possible states it can exist in.</p>
<p>And transitions can occur between pairs of these states, and there&rsquo;s a certain likelihood</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>This is the quantum world.</p>
<p>Nothing is deterministic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a likelihood that it will jump from one state to another.</p>
<p>And these jumps, they&rsquo;re transitions, and there&rsquo;s 16.8 billion of them.</p>
<p>When energy is absorbed, that corresponds to this transition, we see it in the spectrum.</p>
<p>This is more quantum chemistry than you had asked for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Brain&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>So when the transitions happen between the different states, somehow the energy maps</p>
<p>the spectrum.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Energy corresponds to a frequency, and a frequency corresponds to a wavelength, which corresponds</p>
<p>to a color.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some probability assigned to each color then?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that probability determines how intense that transition will be, how strong.</p>
<p>And so you run this kind of simulation for particular, so that&rsquo;s 17.5 squared or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>So 15.5 million energies, each one of whom involves diagonalizing a giant matrix with</p>
<p>a supercomputer.</p>
<p>I wonder what the most efficient algorithm for diagonalization is, but there&rsquo;s some kind</p>
<p>of&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many.</p>
<p>Depends on kind of the shape of the matrix.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not random matrices.</p>
<p>So some are more diagonal than others, and so some need more treatment than others.</p>
<p>Most of the work ends up going in describing the system, this quantum system in different</p>
<p>ways until you have a matrix that is close to being diagonal, and then it&rsquo;s much easier</p>
<p>to clean it up.</p>
<p>So how hard is this puzzle?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re solving this puzzle for phosphine, right?</p>
<p>Is this&hellip;</p>
<p>Are we supposed to solve this puzzle for every single molecule?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Yes, I calculated if I did the work I did for phosphine, again, for all the molecules</p>
<p>for which we don&rsquo;t have spectra, for which we don&rsquo;t have a fingerprint, it would take</p>
<p>me 62,000 years, a little over.</p>
<p>62,000 years.</p>
<p>What time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But you write that there are about 16,000 molecules we care about when looking for a</p>
<p>new Earth or when we try to detect alien biosignatures.</p>
<p>If we want to detect any molecules from here, we need to know their spectra, and we currently</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So to solve this particular problem, that&rsquo;s my job.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s absolutely correct.</p>
<p>I could have not said it better myself.</p>
<p>Did you take that from my website?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I stole it.</p>
<p>And your website is excellent, so it&rsquo;s a worthy place to steal stuff from.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>How do you solve this problem for the 16,000 molecules we care about, of which phosphine</p>
<p>is one?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, taking a step a little bit out of phosphine, is there&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, we were having so much fun.</p>
<p>We were having so much fun.</p>
<p>No, no, we&rsquo;re not saying bye.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sticking around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying we&rsquo;re joining, more friends coming to the party.</p>
<p>How do you choose other friends to come to the party that are interesting to study as</p>
<p>we solve one puzzle at a time through the space of 16,000?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve already started.</p>
<p>Out of those 16,000, we understand water quite well, methane quite well, ammonia quite well,</p>
<p>carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>I could keep going.</p>
<p>And then we understand molecules like acetylene, hydrogen cyanide, more or less.</p>
<p>And that takes us to about 4% of those 16,000.</p>
<p>We understand about 4% of them, more or less.</p>
<p>Phosphine is one of them.</p>
<p>But the other 96%, we just really have barely any idea at all of where in the spectrum of</p>
<p>light they would leave a mark.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t spend the next 62,000 years doing this work.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to, even if somehow I was able, that wouldn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I try to do now is move away from how I did phosphine.</p>
<p>So I did phosphine really the best that I could, the best that could be done with the</p>
<p>computer power that we have, trying to get each one of those 16.8 billion transitions</p>
<p>mapped accurately, calculated.</p>
<p>And then I thought, what if I do a worse job?</p>
<p>What if I just do a much worse job?</p>
<p>Can I just make it much faster and then it&rsquo;s still worth it?</p>
<p>How bad can I get before it&rsquo;s worthless?</p>
<p>And then could I do this for all the other molecules?</p>
<p>So I created exactly this terrible, terrible system.</p>
<p>So how, what&rsquo;s the answer to that question, that fundamental question I ask myself all</p>
<p>the time in other domains.</p>
<p>How crappy can I be before I&rsquo;m useless?</p>
<p>Before somebody notices.</p>
<p>Turns out pretty crappy because no one has any idea what these molecules look like.</p>
<p>Anything is better than nothing.</p>
<p>And so I thought, how long will it take me to create better than nothing spectra for</p>
<p>all of these molecules?</p>
<p>And so I created RASCAL, Rapid Approximate Spectral Calculations for All.</p>
<p>And what I do is I use organic chemistry and quantum chemistry and kind of cheat them both.</p>
<p>I just try to figure out what is the fastest way I could run this.</p>
<p>And I simulate rough spectra for all of those 16,000.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve managed to get it to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really shocking how well it works considering how bad it is.</p>
<p>Is there insights you could give to like the tricks involved in making it fast?</p>
<p>Like what are the maybe some insightful shortcuts taken that still result in some useful information</p>
<p>about the spectra?</p>
<p>The insights came from organic chemistry from decades ago.</p>
<p>When organic chemists wanted to know what a compound might be, they will look at a spectrum</p>
<p>and see a feature and they would go, I&rsquo;ve seen that feature before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually what happens when you have a carbon triple bonded to another carbon.</p>
<p>And they were mostly right.</p>
<p>Almost every molecule that has a carbon triple bonded to another one looks like that.</p>
<p>Has other features different that distinguish them from one another, but they have that</p>
<p>feature in common.</p>
<p>We call these functional groups.</p>
<p>And so most of that work ended up being abandoned because now we have mass spectrometry.</p>
<p>We got nuclear magnetic resin spectroscopy, so people don&rsquo;t really need to do that anymore.</p>
<p>But these ancient textbooks still exist and I&rsquo;ve collected them all as many as I could.</p>
<p>And there are hundreds of these descriptions where people have said, oh, whenever you have</p>
<p>a iodine atom connected to this one, there&rsquo;s always a feature here and it&rsquo;s usually quite</p>
<p>sharp and it&rsquo;s quite strong.</p>
<p>And some people go, oh yeah, that&rsquo;s really broad feature.</p>
<p>Every time that combination of atoms and bonds.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve collected them all and I&rsquo;ve created this giant dictionary of all these kind of</p>
<p>puzzle pieces, these Lego parts of molecules.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve written a code that then puts them all together in some kind of like Frankenstein&rsquo;s</p>
<p>monster of molecules.</p>
<p>So you asked me for any molecule and I go, well, it has these bonds and this atom dangling</p>
<p>off this atom and this cluster here, and I tell you what it should look like and it kind</p>
<p>of works.</p>
<p>So this creates a whole portfolio of just kind of signatures that we could look for.</p>
<p>Rough, very rough signatures.</p>
<p>But still useful enough to analyze the atmospheres, the telescope generated images of other planets?</p>
<p>Close.</p>
<p>Right now it is so complete.</p>
<p>So it has all of these molecules that it can tell you, say you look at an alien atmosphere</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a feature there.</p>
<p>It can tell you, oh, that feature, that&rsquo;s familiar.</p>
<p>It could be one of these 816 molecules, best of luck.</p>
<p>So I think the next step, which is what I&rsquo;m working on is telling you something more useful</p>
<p>than it could be one of those 816 molecules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still true.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>So it can tell you, but only 12% of them also have a feature in this region.</p>
<p>So go look there.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s nothing there, it can&rsquo;t be those and so on.</p>
<p>It can also tell you things like you will need this much accuracy to distinguish between</p>
<p>those 816.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a lot of work.</p>
<p>So this is really interesting, the role of computing in this whole picture.</p>
<p>You mentioned code.</p>
<p>So like you as a quantum astrochemist, there is some role for programming in your life,</p>
<p>in your past life, in your current life, in your group?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, almost entirely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a computational quantum astrochemist, but that doesn&rsquo;t roll off the tongue very</p>
<p>easily.</p>
<p>So this is fundamentally computational.</p>
<p>Like if you want to be successful in the 21st century in doing quantum astrochemistry, you</p>
<p>want to be computational?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All quantum chemistry is computational at this point.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So does machine learning play a role at all?</p>
<p>Is there some extra shortcuts that could be discovered through, like you see all that</p>
<p>success with protein folding, right?</p>
<p>A problem that thought to be extremely difficult to apply machine learning to because it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean mostly because there&rsquo;s not a lot of already solved puzzles to train on.</p>
<p>I suppose the same exact thing is true with this particular problem, but is there hope</p>
<p>for machine learning to help out?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Currently you&rsquo;ve laid out exactly the problem.</p>
<p>The training set is awful and because there&rsquo;s so, a lot of this data that I&rsquo;m basing it</p>
<p>on is literally many decades old.</p>
<p>The people who worked on it and data that I get, often they&rsquo;re dead and the files that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used, some of them were hand drawn by someone tired in the seventies.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I can of course have a program training on these, but I would just be perpetuating</p>
<p>these mistakes without hope of actually verifying them.</p>
<p>So my next step is to improve this training set by hand and then try to see if I can apply</p>
<p>machine learning on the full code of the full 16,000 molecules and improve them all.</p>
<p>But really I need to be able to test the outcomes with experimental data, which means convincing</p>
<p>someone in a lab to spend a lot of money putting very dangerous gases in chambers and measuring</p>
<p>them at outrageous temperatures.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a work in progress.</p>
<p>And so collecting huge amounts of data about the actual gases.</p>
<p>So you are up for doing that kind of thing too.</p>
<p>So actually like doing the full end to end thing, which is like having a gas, collecting</p>
<p>data about it, and then doing the kind of analysis that creates the fingerprint and</p>
<p>then also analyzing using that library, the data that comes from other planets.</p>
<p>So you do the full.</p>
<p>Full from birth to death.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I worked in an industrial chemistry laboratory when I was much younger in Slovenia and there</p>
<p>I worked in the lab actually collecting spectrum and predicting spectrum.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like to work with a bunch of gases that are like not so human friendly?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrific.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so scary.</p>
<p>And I love my job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to clearly sacrifice a lot for it, you know, job, stability, money, sanity.</p>
<p>But I only worked there for a few months and it was really terrifying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so many ways to die.</p>
<p>You know, usually you only have a handful of ways to die every day, you know.</p>
<p>And if you work in a lab, there&rsquo;s so many more, orders of magnitude more.</p>
<p>And I was very bad at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a good hands on scientist.</p>
<p>I want a laptop connected to a remote super computer or a laptop connected to a telescope.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to be there to believe it.</p>
<p>And I am not good in the lab.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s a bunch of things that can poison you, a bunch of things that could explode</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gaseous and they&rsquo;re often, maybe they might not even have a smell or they might</p>
<p>not be visible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>So many of them give you cancer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so cruel.</p>
<p>And some people love this work, but I&rsquo;ve never enjoyed experimental work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so ungrateful.</p>
<p>So lonely.</p>
<p>Well, most, I mean, so much work is lonely if you find the joy in it, but you enjoy the</p>
<p>results of it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very thankful for all the experimentalists in my life, but I&rsquo;ll do the theory.</p>
<p>They do the experiment and then we talk to one another and make sure it matches.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>What are spectroscopic networks?</p>
<p>Those look super cool.</p>
<p>Are they related to what we were talking about?</p>
<p>The picture look pretty.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, slightly.</p>
<p>So remember when I mentioned the 17.5 million energy levels?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There are rules for each molecule on which energy levels they can jump from and to and</p>
<p>how likely it is to make that jump.</p>
<p>And so if you plot all the routes it can take, you get this energy network, which is like</p>
<p>a ball.</p>
<p>So these are the constraints of the transitions that could be taken.</p>
<p>Exactly for each molecule.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not, so it&rsquo;s not a fully connected, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s sparse somehow.</p>
<p>Yes, you get islands sometimes.</p>
<p>You get a molecule can only jump from one set of states to another and it&rsquo;s trapped</p>
<p>now in this network.</p>
<p>It can never go to another network that could have been available to other siblings.</p>
<p>Is there some insights to be drawn from these networks?</p>
<p>Like something cool that you can understand about a particular molecule because of it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Some molecules have what we call forbidden transitions, which aren&rsquo;t really forbidden</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s quantum.</p>
<p>There are no rules.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not joking.</p>
<p>One of the rules is just the rules are very often broken in the quantum world.</p>
<p>And so forbidden transitions doesn&rsquo;t actually mean they&rsquo;re forbidden.</p>
<p>Low probability.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>They just become deeply unlikely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>And so you could do all the same, like I&rsquo;m coming from a computer science world, I love</p>
<p>graph theory.</p>
<p>So you can do all the same graph theoretic kind of analysis of clusters or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And draw insights from it.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re unique for each molecule.</p>
<p>And the networks that you mentioned, that&rsquo;s actually not too difficult a layer of quantum</p>
<p>physics.</p>
<p>By then, all the energies are mapped.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had high school children work on those networks.</p>
<p>And the trick is to not tell them they&rsquo;re doing quantum physics until like three months</p>
<p>in when it&rsquo;s too late for them to back out.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re a quantum physicist now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But like the promise of this, even though it&rsquo;s 16,000, even just a subset of them, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really exciting because then you can do as the telescope data get better and better,</p>
<p>especially for exoplanets, but also for Venus.</p>
<p>You can then start like getting your full, like, you know how you get like blood work</p>
<p>done or like you get your genetic testing to see what your ancestors are.</p>
<p>You can get the same kind of like high resolution information about interesting things going</p>
<p>on on a particular planet based on the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>How cool would that be if we could, you know, scan an alien planet and go,</p>
<p>oh, this is what the clouds are made of.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s in the surface.</p>
<p>These are the molecules that are mixing.</p>
<p>Here are probably oceans because you can see these types of molecules above it.</p>
<p>And here are the Hadley cells.</p>
<p>Here are how the biosphere works.</p>
<p>We could map this whole thing.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if the aliens like are aware of these techniques and like would spoof</p>
<p>like the wrong gases, just to like pretend that&rsquo;s how they can be, it&rsquo;s like an invisibility</p>
<p>cloak.</p>
<p>They can generate gases that would throw you off or like, or do the opposite.</p>
<p>They pretend they will artificially generate phosphine.</p>
<p>So like, like the dumb, the dumb apes on earth again, like go out, like flying in different</p>
<p>places because it&rsquo;s just fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some teenager alien somewhere, just pranking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was asked that exact question this Saturday by, by a 70 year old boy in Canada, but it</p>
<p>was the first time I&rsquo;d been asked that question, the second in a week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kindred spirits, him and I.</p>
<p>We can, they can prank us to some extent, but the, this work of interpreting an alien</p>
<p>atmosphere means you&rsquo;re reading the atmosphere as a message and it&rsquo;s very hard to hide signs</p>
<p>of life in an atmosphere because you can try to prank us, but you&rsquo;re still going to fart</p>
<p>and breathe and somehow metabolize the environment around you and call that whatever you call</p>
<p>that and release molecules.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really hard to hide.</p>
<p>You know, you can go very quiet.</p>
<p>You can throw out some weird molecule to confuse us further, but we can still see all your</p>
<p>other metabolites.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to fake.</p>
<p>Is there, so you kind of mentioned like water that what, what other gases are there that</p>
<p>we know about that are like high likelihood as biosignatures in terms of life?</p>
<p>I mean, what are your other favorites in terms of, so, so we&rsquo;ve got phosphine, but like what,</p>
<p>what else is a damn good signal to be a, that you think about that we should be looking</p>
<p>for if we look at another atmosphere, is there gases that come to mind or are there all sort</p>
<p>of possible biosignatures that we should love equally?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many, so there&rsquo;s water.</p>
<p>We know that&rsquo;s important for life as we know it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s molecular oxygen on earth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the most robust sign of life, particularly combined with small amounts of</p>
<p>methane.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true that the majority of the oxygen in our atmosphere is a product of life.</p>
<p>And so if I was an alien astronomer and I saw earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, I&rsquo;m, I would get a</p>
<p>Nobel I think on, you know,</p>
<p>What would you notice?</p>
<p>I mean, this is a really,</p>
<p>I would be very excited about this.</p>
<p>About the oxygen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not finding 20%, 21% of oxygen atmosphere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very unusual.</p>
<p>So would that be the most exciting thing to you from an alien perspective about earth</p>
<p>in terms of the tech, like analyzing the atmosphere, like what are the biosignatures of life on</p>
<p>earth?</p>
<p>Would you say in terms of the contents of the atmosphere is oxygen, high amount of oxygen,</p>
<p>pretty damn good sign.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not as good as the TV signals we&rsquo;ve been sending out.</p>
<p>Those are slightly more robust than oxygen.</p>
<p>Oxygen on its own has false positives for life.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s still ways of making it, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a pretty robust sign of life in the context</p>
<p>or atmosphere with the radiation that the sun produces, our position in relation to</p>
<p>the sun, the other components of our atmosphere, the volcanic activity we have, all of that</p>
<p>together makes the 20% of oxygen extremely robust sign of life.</p>
<p>But outside that context, you could still produce oxygen without life.</p>
<p>But phosphine, although better in the sense of it is much harder to make, it has lower</p>
<p>false positives, still has some.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually against looking for specific molecules unless we&rsquo;re looking for like CFCs.</p>
<p>If we find CFCs, that&rsquo;s definitely aliens, I feel confident, chlorofluorocarbons.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if aliens had been watching us, they would have been going, oh no, CFCs.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re not going to last long.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, you know, everyone&rsquo;s writing their thesis on the end of, the end of the earth.</p>
<p>And then we got together, we stopped using them.</p>
<p>I like to think they&rsquo;re really proud of us.</p>
<p>You know, they literally saw our ozone hole shrinking.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been watching it and they saw it happen.</p>
<p>I think to be honest, they&rsquo;re more paying attention to the whole nuclear thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to bother them.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, worried about us.</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>Oh no, worried about us.</p>
<p>They, I mean, this is why the aliens have been showing up recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you, if you look at, I mean, there is, I mean, it&rsquo;s probably, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>correlation with a lot of things, but what the ufologists quote unquote often talk about</p>
<p>is that there seems to be a much higher level of UFO sightings since like in the nuclear</p>
<p>age.</p>
<p>So like if aliens were indeed worried about us, like if you were aliens, you would start</p>
<p>showing up when the living organisms first discovered a way to destroy the entire, the</p>
<p>entire colony.</p>
<p>Can the increase in sightings not have to do with the fact that people now have more</p>
<p>cameras?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thing about science, like with UFO sightings, it&rsquo;s like either 99.9%</p>
<p>of them are false or 100% of them are false.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to me is that in that 0.01%, there&rsquo;s a lot of things in science</p>
<p>that are like these weird outliers that are difficult to replicate.</p>
<p>You have like, there&rsquo;s even physical phenomena, ball lightning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s difficult things to artificially create in large amounts or observe in nature in large</p>
<p>amounts in such a way that you can do it to apply the scientific method that could be</p>
<p>just things that like what happened like a few times or once and you&rsquo;re like, what the</p>
<p>hell is that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very difficult for science to know what to do with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge proponent of just being open minded because when you&rsquo;re open minded about aliens,</p>
<p>for example, it allows you to think outside of the box in other domains as well.</p>
<p>And somehow that will result, like if you&rsquo;re open minded about aliens and you don&rsquo;t laugh</p>
<p>it off immediately, what happens is somehow that&rsquo;s going to lead to a solution to a P</p>
<p>equals NP or P not equals NP.</p>
<p>Like in ways that you can&rsquo;t predict, the open mindedness has tertiary effects that will</p>
<p>result in progress, I believe, which is why I&rsquo;m a huge fan of aliens because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>because too many scientists roll their eyes at the idea of aliens, alien life.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s one of the most exciting possibilities in the biggest, most exciting questions before</p>
<p>all of human civilization.</p>
<p>So to roll your eyes is not the right answer.</p>
<p>To roll your eyes presumes that you know anything about this world as opposed to just knowing</p>
<p>point zero zero zero one percent of this world.</p>
<p>And so being humble in the face of that, being open to the possibility of aliens visiting</p>
<p>Earth is a good idea.</p>
<p>Not everything, though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so open minded to the flat Earth hypothesis as there&rsquo;s a growing number of people believing</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>But even then.</p>
<p>Or the inner Earth, I&rsquo;ve got shouted at in a public talk about it.</p>
<p>So like the Earth is hollow?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My understanding is that there&rsquo;s this conspiracy theory that as far as I can tell has no grounding</p>
<p>in reality is that there&rsquo;s a slightly smaller Earth inside this one, which is just too cute</p>
<p>as a concept.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And you can access it, I think, from Antarctica.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we keep, and I quote, the mammoths and the Nazis.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that one is ridiculous.</p>
<p>But like I do like.</p>
<p>Hey, I thought you were keeping an open mind.</p>
<p>I genuinely think that&rsquo;s more likely than aliens visiting the Earth.</p>
<p>And I say this as someone who has dedicated her life to finding like alien life.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how improbable, I think, the visitations are.</p>
<p>Because interstellar distances are so huge that it&rsquo;s just not really worth it.</p>
<p>See, I have a different view on this whole thing.</p>
<p>I think the aliens that look like little green men are like extremely low probability event.</p>
<p>Like mammoths and Nazis under that level.</p>
<p>But other kind of ideas, like the sad thing to me, and I think in my view, if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other alien civilizations out there and they visited Earth, neither them or perhaps just</p>
<p>us would be even able to detect them.</p>
<p>Like we wouldn&rsquo;t be open minded enough to see it.</p>
<p>Like if, because our understanding of what is life, and I just talked to Sarah Walker,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You know Sarah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we talked for three hours about the question of what is life.</p>
<p>Sarah&rsquo;s a good person to talk to about what is life.</p>
<p>But like the whole point is we don&rsquo;t really, we have a very narrow minded view of what</p>
<p>is life.</p>
<p>And when it shows up, and it might be already here, trees and dolphins and so on, or mountains</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t know, or the molecules in the atmosphere, or like people make fun of me.</p>
<p>But I do think that ideas are kind of aliens themselves, or consciousness could be the</p>
<p>aliens, or it could be the method by which they communicate.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know shit about the way our human mind works.</p>
<p>And the fact that this thing is a quantum process, please don&rsquo;t I understand this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not woo woo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not I, we could, but it very well could be there could be something at the at the</p>
<p>physics level, right?</p>
<p>It could be at the chemical or the biological level, things that are happening that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just close to close minded, because our conception of life is at the level of like us, like at</p>
<p>the jungle level of mammals.</p>
<p>And on the time scale, that&rsquo;s the human time scale, we may not be able to perceive what</p>
<p>alien life is actually like what the scale at which their intelligence realizes itself</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not able to perceive.</p>
<p>And the other thing that&rsquo;s really important about alien visitations, whether it happened</p>
<p>or not, is especially after COVID in 2020, I&rsquo;m losing a little bit of faith of our government</p>
<p>being able to handle that that well, not our government, but us as a society, as a collective,</p>
<p>being able to deal with new things in an effective way that&rsquo;s inspiring, that&rsquo;s efficient, that</p>
<p>like, whether it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s a dangerous thing to deal with it to alleviate the danger, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the possibility of new discoveries and something inspiring to ride that wave and</p>
<p>make it inspiring all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I honestly think if aliens showed up, they would look around, everybody would ignore</p>
<p>them and the government might like hide it, try to like see to keep it from the Chinese</p>
<p>and the Russians if it&rsquo;s the United States, call it a military secret in a very close</p>
<p>minded way.</p>
<p>And then the bureaucracy would drown it away to where through paperwork, the poor aliens</p>
<p>would just like waste away and sell somewhere like there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>That would not happen, that would never happen, part of the reason that I feel so confident</p>
<p>that aliens have not visited because they would have had to visit just to have a look</p>
<p>remotely, from Neptune or something, which makes no sense because interstellar travel</p>
<p>is so difficult that it would be quite a ridiculous proposition, but that&rsquo;s the bit that I think</p>
<p>is technically possible.</p>
<p>If they did come here and they were visible by anyone, detectable by anyone, the thought</p>
<p>that any government, no matter, or any military could just contain them, these beings are</p>
<p>capable of traveling interstellar distances when we can barely go to the moon, like barely</p>
<p>go to the moon.</p>
<p>These things would be way, way, way, way out there.</p>
<p>Way.</p>
<p>And the fact that we think our puny military, even if all the military in the world got</p>
<p>together and the fact that they could somehow contain it, that&rsquo;s the bit that&rsquo;s laughable.</p>
<p>Ants trying to contain a human that visited them.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And scientists, you would have to bring scientists on board.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve met a lot of scientists.</p>
<p>How good are they at keeping secrets?</p>
<p>Because in my experience, they&rsquo;re absolutely appalling at keeping secrets.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Even the Phosphine on Venus thing, which was a pretty well kept secret.</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>You had a bunch of people that were.</p>
<p>I told my dad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, my dad knew and hopefully didn&rsquo;t tell anyone, but if it had been an alien visiting,</p>
<p>he probably would have told a mate, you know?</p>
<p>And so these secrets could not be kept by any scientist that I know and certainly not</p>
<p>collaborative scientists, which would be needed.</p>
<p>You would need all sorts of scientific teams.</p>
<p>So between the pathetic power of any world&rsquo;s military compared to any civilization capable</p>
<p>of traveling and our absolute inability to keep secrets, absolutely not.</p>
<p>I will bet everything that we have not been visited because we are too pathetic to hold</p>
<p>that truth.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re just making like a $10 bet, the possibility here that the main alien, say there exists</p>
<p>one alien civil, other intelligent alien civilization in the galaxy.</p>
<p>To me, if they visit Earth, what&rsquo;s going to visit Earth is like the crappy, like the really</p>
<p>crappy, short straw, like, like this, this like really dumb thing that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like the early game boys or something like, there&rsquo;s a cartoon about this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an alien that gets sent to Earth, Commander Spiff or something, and it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of a punishment or something, but that&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing because interstellar distances are so hard to, to cross.</p>
<p>You have to do it on purpose.</p>
<p>You have to do on purpose.</p>
<p>It has to be a big, big deal, and we know this because yes, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know enough about galactic biology.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what the universal rules of biology or biochemistry are because we only</p>
<p>have the Earth, but we do know that the laws of physics are universal.</p>
<p>We can predict behavior in the universe and then see it happen based on these laws of</p>
<p>physics.</p>
<p>We know that the laws of chemistry are universal.</p>
<p>We know the periodic table is all they have to choose from.</p>
<p>So yes, they may be some sort of unimaginable intelligence, but they still have to use the</p>
<p>same periodic table that we have access to.</p>
<p>They still have a finite number of molecules they can do things with.</p>
<p>So they still have to use the resources around them, the stars around them, the universe</p>
<p>around them, and we know how much energy is in these places.</p>
<p>And so yes, they may be very capable, capable beyond our wildest dreams, but they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>in the same universe, and we know a lot of those rules.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not completely blind.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a colleague of yours at Harvard, Kamran Vafa, he&rsquo;s a theoretical physicist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only joined Harvard about six months ago.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to meet all the theoretical physicists.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a string theorist, but his idea is that aliens that are sophisticated enough</p>
<p>to travel interstellar like those kinds of distances will figure out actually ways to</p>
<p>hack the fabric of the universe enough to have fun in other ways, like this universe</p>
<p>is too boring.</p>
<p>Like you would figure out ways to create other universes, like you go outside the physics</p>
<p>as we know it.</p>
<p>So the reason we don&rsquo;t see aliens visiting us all over the place is they&rsquo;re having fun</p>
<p>elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is like way too boring.</p>
<p>We humans think this is fun, but it&rsquo;s actually mostly empty space that no fun is happening.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fun in visiting Earth for a super advanced civilization.</p>
<p>So he thinks like if alien civilizations are out there, they found outside of our current</p>
<p>standard models of physics ways of having fun that don&rsquo;t involve us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably true, but even the notion of visiting, that&rsquo;s so literally pedestrian.</p>
<p>Of course we want to go there because going there is the only thing we know.</p>
<p>We see a thing we want, we want to go there and get it.</p>
<p>But that is probably something they&rsquo;ve no longer gotten need for.</p>
<p>I specifically don&rsquo;t particularly want to go to space.</p>
<p>Sounds awful.</p>
<p>None of the things I like are going to be there.</p>
<p>My whole work is my whole career is finding life and understanding the universe.</p>
<p>So I care a lot, but I care about knowing about it and I feel no need to go there to</p>
<p>learn about it.</p>
<p>And I think as we develop better tools, hopefully people will feel less and less a need to go</p>
<p>everywhere that we know about.</p>
<p>And I would expect any alien civilization worth the salt have developed observation</p>
<p>tools and tools that allow them to understand the universe around them and beyond without</p>
<p>having to go there.</p>
<p>This going is so wasteful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So more focused on the knowledge and learning versus the colonization, like the conquering</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beneath them.</p>
<p>I mean, that said, do you think there&rsquo;s in your hopeful search for life through phosphine</p>
<p>and other gases, do you think there&rsquo;s other alien civilizations out there?</p>
<p>First do you think there&rsquo;s other life out there?</p>
<p>First do you think there&rsquo;s life in the solar system?</p>
<p>Second do you think there&rsquo;s life in the galaxy?</p>
<p>And a third, do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent life in the solar system or the galaxy outside</p>
<p>of earth?</p>
<p>So intelligent life, I have no idea.</p>
<p>It seems deeply unlikely possible, but I&rsquo;m not even sure if it&rsquo;s plausible.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the special thing to you about earth is somehow intelligent life came to me.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only, you know, very briefly, probably extremely briefly.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean like it&rsquo;s always going to be like, we&rsquo;re going to destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to continue on earth happily, probably more happily.</p>
<p>So the trees and the dolphins will be here, I&rsquo;m telling you.</p>
<p>And the cockroaches and the incredible fungi, you know, they&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>So life on earth will be fine, was fine before us and will be fine after us.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not that worried about intelligent life, but I think it is unlikely, even on</p>
<p>earth is unlikely out of, what is it, five billion species across the history of the</p>
<p>earth.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For an intelligent one and for a blink of an eye, possibly not much longer than that.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on that at all, though I would love it, of course, you know, I wanted</p>
<p>to find aliens since I was a little girl.</p>
<p>And so of course I initially wanted to find ones that I could be friends with and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had to let go of that dream because it&rsquo;s so deeply implausible.</p>
<p>But see the nice, and sorry to interrupt, but the nice thing about intelligent alien</p>
<p>civilizations, they may have more biosignatures than nonintelligent ones.</p>
<p>So they might be easier to detect, that would be the hope.</p>
<p>On earth that&rsquo;s not the case, but it could be the case elsewhere.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s not the case on earth.</p>
<p>Most of the biosignatures we have on earth are created by quite simple life.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t count pollution, pollution is all, all us baby.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t see polluting gases as a possible, like.</p>
<p>I look for polluting gases.</p>
<p>I would love to find polluting gases.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I&rsquo;d be worried for them, of course, the same way I, I think about my alien</p>
<p>colleagues all the time looking at us and I&rsquo;m sure they worry about our pollutions,</p>
<p>but it would be a really good, robust, unambiguous sign of life if we found complex pollutants.</p>
<p>So I look for those too.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t have any hope of finding them.</p>
<p>I think intelligent life in the galaxy at the same time that we&rsquo;re looking is deeply</p>
<p>implausible, but life I think is inevitable and if it is inevitable, it is common.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;ll be life everywhere in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Now how common that life is, I think will depend a lot on whether there&rsquo;s life in the</p>
<p>solar system beyond earth.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll adjust my expectations very much based on there being life in the solar system.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s life in the Venusian clouds, if there&rsquo;s life in the, if there are biosignals</p>
<p>coming out of the plumes of Enceladus, if there&rsquo;s life on Titan.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Plumes of Enceladus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s the Saturn one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the moon that has the geysers that come out.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t see the, under the subterranean oceans, but.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed, so it would be in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I was going to ask you about that one.</p>
<p>Have you looked at that?</p>
<p>Have you, is that a hope for you to use the tools you&rsquo;re using with RASCAL and other ways</p>
<p>for detecting the 16,000 molecules that might be biosignatures to look at Enceladus?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s absolutely the plan.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the limiting factor currently?</p>
<p>Is it the quality of the telescopes, what&rsquo;s the quality of the data?</p>
<p>Yeah, the quality of the data, the observational data, and also the quality of RASCAL and other</p>
<p>associated things.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re missing a lot of fundamental data to interpret the data that we get and we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have good enough data.</p>
<p>But hopefully we will, in the coming decades, we&rsquo;ll get some information on Titan.</p>
<p>We have Dragonfly going over.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get the plumes of Enceladus.</p>
<p>We will look at the clouds of Venus and there&rsquo;s other places.</p>
<p>And so if we find any life or any sign of life ever, like on Mars, then I&rsquo;ll adjust</p>
<p>my calculations and I&rsquo;ll say life is not just inevitable and common, but extremely common.</p>
<p>Because all of these places we&rsquo;ve mentioned, the subterranean oceans on Enceladus, the</p>
<p>methane oceans of Titan, the clouds of Venus, the acidic clouds of Venus, these are places</p>
<p>that are very different from the places where we find life on Earth.</p>
<p>Even the most extreme places.</p>
<p>And so if life can originate in all of these completely different habitats, then life is</p>
<p>even more resourceful than we thought, which means it&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting if it&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s life on just one of the moons, if it&rsquo;s on Mars.</p>
<p>Anywhere.</p>
<p>Anywhere in the solar system and I will bet everything I own that every solar system,</p>
<p>every planetary system has a potential for habitability.</p>
<p>Because even if they don&rsquo;t have a habitable planet, they&rsquo;ll have moons around other giant</p>
<p>planets and there&rsquo;ll be so much life.</p>
<p>So for me, that&rsquo;s the only thing to figure out now, whether life is inevitable and quite</p>
<p>common throughout the galaxy or everywhere, but it&rsquo;s somewhere between those two.</p>
<p>In life, I make no bets and if I had to bet, I would be against.</p>
<p>To me, like two discoveries in the 21st century would change everything.</p>
<p>One is, and maybe I&rsquo;m biased, but one is a discovery of life in the solar system.</p>
<p>I feel like that would change our whole conception of how unique we are in the universe.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m much more eager than you are to jump from basic life to intelligent life.</p>
<p>I feel like if there&rsquo;s life everywhere, like the odds are, there has, like we cannot, like</p>
<p>you have, oh, I see.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying there could have been many intelligent civilizations out there, but they just keep</p>
<p>dying out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like little.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was detecting them, you know, ships in the night.</p>
<p>Ships in the night.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s ultra sad.</p>
<p>Just like.</p>
<p>Is it sad?</p>
<p>The earth is not better for having us.</p>
<p>Is it, we, it doesn&rsquo;t owe us anything.</p>
<p>Would you be sad to find alien giraffes?</p>
<p>Would you be disappointed if you found alien giraffes?</p>
<p>Because I would not.</p>
<p>No, well, giraffes, first of all, they look goofy with their necks and everything, but.</p>
<p>We do not shit on giraffes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Giraffes are wondrous animals, are deeply understudied.</p>
<p>We still know so little about them because no one does PhDs in giraffes.</p>
<p>I am disappointed I made a PhD in phosphine when people aren&rsquo;t doing PhDs in giraffes.</p>
<p>We do not know enough about giraffes.</p>
<p>I think it was like Ricky Gervais that did a whole, like a long thing.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t trust Ricky Gervais to talk about giraffes.</p>
<p>That is not his expertise.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a stupid necks, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Giraffes are very resourceful animals who do incredible things and can kick a lion in</p>
<p>the face.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you climb the tree?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to grow through the lengthy evolutionary process.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re shitting on giraffes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Giraffes are wondrous animals.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I would very appreciate it.</p>
<p>Take it back.</p>
<p>I take it back.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>I trust your expertise on this.</p>
<p>The thing that makes humans really fascinating, and I think the earth, but I&rsquo;m a human, is</p>
<p>we create things that are, yes, there&rsquo;s all the ugliness in the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all the, on the biological, on the chemical level, there&rsquo;s the pollution, but</p>
<p>we create beauty.</p>
<p>If you even from a physics perspective, look at symmetry as somehow capturing beauty, the</p>
<p>breaking of symmetries, stuff grounded in all the different definitions of symmetry,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re good at creating things.</p>
<p>So are spiders.</p>
<p>But not giraffes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But yes, this is a&hellip;</p>
<p>Spiders.</p>
<p>Spiders that create little bubbles of air so they can breathe underwater, they can literally</p>
<p>scuba dive.</p>
<p>There are spiders that can create parachutes so they can glide.</p>
<p>And talk about symmetry, look what spiders can do.</p>
<p>And I just thought of spiders, but if I was an alien species coming to earth, there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be plenty to wonder, and we would just be one of the things, clunky, naked monkey.</p>
<p>The ants might be even more fascinating.</p>
<p>The ants.</p>
<p>The ants can figure out exactly through some emergent consciousness what the maximum distance</p>
<p>between their trash, their babies, and their food is just from without any of them knowing</p>
<p>how to do this.</p>
<p>And collectively they&rsquo;ve learned how to do this.</p>
<p>If I was an alien species, I&rsquo;ll be looking at that.</p>
<p>Well, so that was the other thing I was going to mention.</p>
<p>The second thing is I tend to believe we can engineer consciousness, but at the basic level,</p>
<p>in the source of consciousness, because if consciousness is unique to humans, and if</p>
<p>we can engineer it, that gives me hope that it could be present elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing that makes, it&rsquo;s an open question, that makes humans perhaps special</p>
<p>is not maybe the presence of consciousness, but somehow a presence of elevated consciousness.</p>
<p>It does, again, maybe human centric, but it feels like we&rsquo;re more conscious than giraffes,</p>
<p>for example, and spiders.</p>
<p>Yes, I won&rsquo;t deny that.</p>
<p>There is something special about humans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re my favorite species.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Some of my best friends are humans.</p>
<p>I think highly of humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t have great hope for our longevity, and specifically I don&rsquo;t have great hope given</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re the only species that are five billion that did this cool consciousness trick.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t want to bet on finding a kinship elsewhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite interesting to think about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve even considered that possibility that there would be life in the solar system,</p>
<p>so that indicates that very possibly life is literally everywhere.</p>
<p>Everywhere it can happen, it does.</p>
<p>And especially what we&rsquo;re discovering with the exoplanets now, how numerous they are,</p>
<p>or earthlike habitable, quote unquote, planets, they&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>The most common type of planet is rocky, it seems.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t consider the possibility that life is literally everywhere, and yet intelligent</p>
<p>life is nowhere long enough to communicate with each other, to form little clusters of</p>
<p>civilizations that expand beyond the solar system and so on.</p>
<p>Man, maybe becoming a multi planetary species is a less likely pursuit than we imagine.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But one of the things that makes humans beautiful is we hope.</p>
<p>What I hope for humanity, and one of the things I hope for is that we become less obsessed</p>
<p>with conquering, and we become less obsessed with spreading ourselves.</p>
<p>I hope that we transcend that, that we&rsquo;re happy with the universe without having to</p>
<p>go and take it.</p>
<p>So you can hope for the species without hoping for a multi planetary existence.</p>
<p>That is only, I think, the drive of our most primitive instincts to go and take, to go</p>
<p>and plant a flag somewhere.</p>
<p>We love planting a flag somewhere.</p>
<p>And maybe we could overcome that minor drive.</p>
<p>And once we do, the AI systems we build will destroy us because we&rsquo;re too peaceful, and</p>
<p>they will go and conquer and plant the flags.</p>
<p>Best of luck to them.</p>
<p>Rock roaches will be happy to keep to the business as they always have.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that robots can have the same elegance and consciousness and all the</p>
<p>qualities of kindness and love and hope and fear that humans have.</p>
<p>In principle, they could, yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really trust the people who make them.</p>
<p>This is about the giraffe comment, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t forgiven you for shitting on giraffes, whatever they&rsquo;ve done to you.</p>
<p>Just as a small tangent, your master&rsquo;s thesis is also fascinating.</p>
<p>Maybe we could talk about it for just a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s titled Influence of a Star&rsquo;s Evolution on its Planetary System.</p>
<p>So this interplay between a star and a planet, is there something interesting you could say</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;ve learned about this journey that a star takes and the planets around it?</p>
<p>Well, when I was younger and I was told what would happen ultimately to the Earth as the</p>
<p>sun expands towards a red giant and mercury would just like fall in and then Venus fall</p>
<p>in and the sun doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And it just seemed so, I felt so small.</p>
<p>I felt like the Earth and everything on it, it&rsquo;s just the universe doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Even our sun doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And I think I felt like our sun should feel some sort of responsibility for its planets.</p>
<p>And it just felt like such a violent and neglectful parent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a parent eating its own children.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a horrible notion, but it made me think, what if there&rsquo;s some sort of generation?</p>
<p>And so at the time when I was doing my master&rsquo;s, there was a notion of the white dwarf cemetery,</p>
<p>which is this idea that when stars become white dwarfs, that death is so horrible that</p>
<p>planets, potentially habitable planets that could have been habitable before, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>now gone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no chance for life.</p>
<p>But then I thought, what if life returns?</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a white dwarf, it&rsquo;s calmed down, it&rsquo;s not going to go anywhere.</p>
<p>White dwarfs are very stable across like universal timescales.</p>
<p>And so could you have planets around the white dwarf that could themselves get life again?</p>
<p>No, life doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And so my work was basically killing dozens of planets, thousands of times.</p>
<p>I just ran thousands and thousands of end body simulations.</p>
<p>Oh, you simulated this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I simulated the star growing and just eating all these planets up and just absolute chaos.</p>
<p>The orbits of the planets would change as the star loses mass.</p>
<p>So you would have like Jupiter planets just crashing into the other planets, throwing</p>
<p>them into the sun early.</p>
<p>It was terrifying to watch these simulations.</p>
<p>It was absolute carnage.</p>
<p>But if you run thousands of these simulations, some systems find new balance ways of staying</p>
<p>alive.</p>
<p>Some systems post star death find stable orbits again for billions of years, more than enough</p>
<p>for life to originate again.</p>
<p>And so that was my idea during that time that Thesis was trying to explore this notion of</p>
<p>life coming back.</p>
<p>And this idea of the universe doesn&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re here or not, and it will go about</p>
<p>its business.</p>
<p>Andromeda will crash into us and doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>No one cares if you&rsquo;re alive in the universe.</p>
<p>And so letting go of that preciousness of life, I found very useful at that stage of</p>
<p>my career.</p>
<p>And instead, I just thought, if life is inevitable, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that it came by four billion</p>
<p>years ago.</p>
<p>It can start again four billion years later.</p>
<p>And maybe that is nice.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s where hope lies, the Phoenix rising everywhere.</p>
<p>Planets being destroyed and created and we&rsquo;re here now and others will be more or less hereish</p>
<p>billions of years later.</p>
<p>So accepting the cycle of death and life and yeah.</p>
<p>Not taking it personally.</p>
<p>The sun doesn&rsquo;t owe us anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bad parent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a parent at all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was looking at the work of Freeman Dyson and seeing how this universe eventually will</p>
<p>just be a bunch of supermassive black holes before they also evaporate.</p>
<p>A bunch of tiny black holes too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Absolute quiet.</p>
<p>Everyone, all the black holes a little too far away from one another to even interact</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s just silence forever.</p>
<p>But until then, many, many cycles of death and destruction and rebirth.</p>
<p>And rebirth.</p>
<p>You kept bringing up sort of coding stuff up.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask two things.</p>
<p>First of all, what programming language do you like?</p>
<p>And also what, because you&rsquo;re as a computational quantum astrochemist, no, yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of, you could say you&rsquo;re actually understanding some exceptionally complicated</p>
<p>things with one of the things you&rsquo;re using is the tools of computation of programming.</p>
<p>Is there a device you can give to people, because I know quite a few that have not practiced</p>
<p>that tool and have fallen in love with a particular science, whatever it&rsquo;s biology and chemistry</p>
<p>and physics and so on.</p>
<p>And if they were interested in learning to program and learning to use computation as</p>
<p>a tool in their particular science, is there advice you can give on programming and also</p>
<p>just maybe a comment on your own journey and the use of programming in your own life?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a terrible programmer.</p>
<p>A lot of scientists, their programming is bad because we never learned formal programming.</p>
<p>We learned science, physics, chemistry.</p>
<p>And then we were told, oh, you can, you have to get these equations modeled and run through</p>
<p>a simulation.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, oh, okay, so I&rsquo;m going to learn how to code to do this.</p>
<p>And you learn just as much as you need to run these simulations and no more.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re rarely optimized and they&rsquo;re really clunky.</p>
<p>Six months later, you can&rsquo;t read your own code.</p>
<p>My variable names are extremely embarrassing.</p>
<p>I still have error messages for different compilation errors that say things like, at</p>
<p>least your dad loves you, Clara.</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t help me at all.</p>
<p>Just like you suck at coding, but there&rsquo;s other things in your life.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a bad programmer.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if that will give hope to anyone else who&rsquo;s a bad programmer, I can</p>
<p>still do pretty impressive science.</p>
<p>But I learned, I think I started learning MATLAB and Java when I was in college.</p>
<p>It did me no good at all.</p>
<p>It has not been particularly useful.</p>
<p>I learned some Fortran that was very useful, even though it&rsquo;s really not a fun language</p>
<p>because so much of legacy code is in Fortran.</p>
<p>And so if you want to use other people&rsquo;s code who have now retired, Fortran will be nice.</p>
<p>And then I used IDL to visualize.</p>
<p>So that simulation and body simulation, those all Fortran and IDL.</p>
<p>But thankfully, since I&rsquo;ve left college, I&rsquo;ve just learned Python like a normal person and</p>
<p>that has been much nicer.</p>
<p>So most of my code now is in Python.</p>
<p>I should also make a few quick comments as well.</p>
<p>So one is, you say you&rsquo;re sort of bad at programming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of excellent scientists that are quote unquote bad at programming.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>It gets the job done.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a downside to sort of, especially getting a software engineering education.</p>
<p>If I were to give advice, especially if you&rsquo;re doing a computer science degree and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing software engineering, is not to get lost in the optimization of the correct, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an obsession, you could see it in like Stack Overflow, of the correct way to do things.</p>
<p>And I think you can too easily get lost in constantly trying to optimize and do things</p>
<p>the correct way when you actually never get done.</p>
<p>The same thing happens, you have like communities of people obsessed with productivity and they</p>
<p>keep researching productivity hacks and then they spend like 90% plus of their time figuring</p>
<p>out how to do things productively and then never actually do anything.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain sense if you focus on the task that needs to be done, that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>programming is for.</p>
<p>So not over optimizing, not thinking about variable names in the following sense.</p>
<p>Sometimes you think, okay, I&rsquo;m going to write code that&rsquo;s going to last for decades.</p>
<p>In reality, your code, if it&rsquo;s well written or poorly written, will be very likely obsolete</p>
<p>very quickly.</p>
<p>The point is to get the job done really well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a trade off there that you have to make sure to strike.</p>
<p>I should also comment as a public service announcement or a request, if there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>world class Fortran or Cobalt programmers out there, I&rsquo;m looking for them, I want to</p>
<p>talk to you.</p>
<p>That will not be me, I&rsquo;m a terrible Fortran programmer.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fascinating because so much of the world in the past and still runs programming</p>
<p>languages and there&rsquo;s no experts on it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all retiring.</p>
<p>I disagree slightly in that I think because I can get the job done, I&rsquo;m a programmer.</p>
<p>But because no one else can look at my code and know how I got my job done, I&rsquo;m a bad</p>
<p>programmer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m defining it.</p>
<p>Including yourself.</p>
<p>Including myself six months later, I&rsquo;m working with a new student right now and she sent</p>
<p>me some messages on Slack being like, what is this file that you&rsquo;ve got with some functions</p>
<p>that run?</p>
<p>And I was like, this was from 2018, it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago and I can no longer remember</p>
<p>what that code does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to spend now two days reading through my own code and trying to improve it.</p>
<p>And I do think that&rsquo;s frustrating.</p>
<p>And so I think my advice to any young people who want to get into astronomy or astrobiology</p>
<p>or quantum chemistry is that I certainly find it much easier to teach the science concepts</p>
<p>to a programmer than the programming to a scientist.</p>
<p>And so I would much, much faster hire someone who knows programming but barely knows where</p>
<p>space is than teach programming to an astronomer.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, there&rsquo;s some basics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m focusing too much on the silver lining because the people that write MATLAB code,</p>
<p>yeah, single variable, single letter variable names, those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s accessibility, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I want my code to be open source and it is, it&rsquo;s on GitHub, anyone can download</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But is it really open source if it&rsquo;s written so cryptically, so poorly that no one can</p>
<p>really use it to its full functionality?</p>
<p>Have I really published my work and that weighs on me?</p>
<p>I feel guilty for my own inadequacies as a programmer.</p>
<p>But you can only do so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already learned quantum chemistry and astrophysics.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways to contribute to the world.</p>
<p>One of them is publication, but publishing code is a fascinating way to contribute to</p>
<p>the world, even if it&rsquo;s very small, very basic element, great code.</p>
<p>I guess I was also kind of criticizing the software engineering process versus like,</p>
<p>which is a good thing to do is code that&rsquo;s readable, almost like without documentation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s readable, it&rsquo;s understandable.</p>
<p>The variable names, the structure, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dream.</p>
<p>This is a dumb question.</p>
<p>What do you, all right.</p>
<p>No, no, tell me a dumb question.</p>
<p>I want to hear it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, this is the question about beauty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way too general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very impossible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like asking, what&rsquo;s your favorite band?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite music band?</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you meant wavelength band.</p>
<p>I was like, I definitely have favorite wavelength bands.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s hard to narrow it down, huh?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What do you use the most beautiful idea in science?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a dumb question.</p>
<p>Do you want to try the question again proudly?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have a really good question to ask you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t oversell it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got an okay question to ask you, you know?</p>
<p>What do you use the most beautiful idea in science, something you just find inspiring</p>
<p>or just maybe the reason you got into science or the reason you think science is cool?</p>
<p>My favorite thing about science is kind of the connection between the scales.</p>
<p>So when I was little and I wanted to know about space, I really felt that it would make</p>
<p>me feel powerful to be able to predict the heavens.</p>
<p>Something so much larger than myself that felt really powerful.</p>
<p>It was almost a selfish desire and that&rsquo;s what I wanted.</p>
<p>There was some control to being able to know exactly what the sky would do.</p>
<p>And then as I got older and I got more into astronomy and I didn&rsquo;t just want to know how</p>
<p>the stars moved.</p>
<p>I wanted to know how the planets around them moved.</p>
<p>And then as I got deeper into that field, I really didn&rsquo;t care that much about the planets.</p>
<p>I wanted to know about the atmospheres around the planets and then the molecules within</p>
<p>those atmospheres and what that might mean.</p>
<p>So I ended up shrinking my scale until it was literally the quantum scale.</p>
<p>And now all my work, the majority of my work is on this insane quantum scale.</p>
<p>And yet I&rsquo;m using these literal tiny, tiny tools to try and answer the greatest questions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve ever been able to ask.</p>
<p>And this crossing of scales from the quantum to the astronomical, that&rsquo;s so cool, isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It spans the entirety, the tiny and the huge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cool thing about, I guess, being a quantum astrochemist is you&rsquo;re using the</p>
<p>tools of the tiny to look at the heavenly bodies, the giant stuff.</p>
<p>And the potential life out there that this is the thing that connects us, that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>escape the rules of the quantum world and how universal they themselves are despite</p>
<p>being probabilistic.</p>
<p>And that makes me feel really pleased to be in science, but in a really humbling way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer this thirst for power.</p>
<p>I feel less special the more work I do, less exceptional the more work I do.</p>
<p>I feel like humans and the earth and our place in the universe is less and less exceptional.</p>
<p>And yet I feel so much less lonely.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been a really good trade off that I&rsquo;ve lost power, but I&rsquo;ve gained company.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful answer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to actually end it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I asked a mediocre question and you came through.</p>
<p>You made the question good by a brilliant answer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the Michael Jordan and I&rsquo;ll be the Dennis Rodman.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about basketball.</p>
<p>I mean, literally you&rsquo;ve reached the peak of my basketball knowledge because I know</p>
<p>that those people are basketball pros, I believe, but only because I watch Space Jam, I think.</p>
<p>Are there books or movies in your life?</p>
<p>Long ago or recently, do you have any time for books and movies had an impact on you?</p>
<p>What ideas did you take away?</p>
<p>I absolutely have time for books and movies.</p>
<p>I try as best I can to not work very hard.</p>
<p>I mostly fail.</p>
<p>I should point out.</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;m a better scientist when I don&rsquo;t work evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>If I get four good hours in a day, I often don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I often get eight crappy hours, emails, meetings, bad code, data processing.</p>
<p>But if I can get four high quality scientific hours, I just stop working for the day because</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s diminishing returns after that.</p>
<p>So I have a lot of time.</p>
<p>I try to make as much time as I can.</p>
<p>Can you kind of dig into what it takes to be, one, productive, two, to be happy as a</p>
<p>researcher?</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s too easy in that world because you have so many hats, you have to</p>
<p>wear so many jobs, you have to be a mentor, a teacher, a head of a research group to research</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>You have to do service, all the kinds of stuff you&rsquo;re doing now with education and interviews.</p>
<p>So as a public science, like being a public communicator, that&rsquo;s a job.</p>
<p>The whole thing.</p>
<p>Pays very poorly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pay you in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So is there some advice you can give to the process of being productive and happy as a</p>
<p>researcher?</p>
<p>I think, sadly, it&rsquo;s very hard to feel happy as a scientist if you&rsquo;re not productive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a trap, but I certainly find it very difficult to feel happy when I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>being productive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become slightly better.</p>
<p>If I know my students are being productive, I can be happy.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of senior scientists, once they get into that mindset, they start thinking</p>
<p>that their student science is theirs.</p>
<p>And I think this happens a lot with senior scientists.</p>
<p>They have so many hats, as you mentioned, they have to do so much service and so much</p>
<p>admin, that they have very little time for their own science.</p>
<p>And so they end up feeling ownership over the junior people in their labs and their</p>
<p>groups.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I see it all the time.</p>
<p>And that, I think I&rsquo;ve escaped that trap.</p>
<p>I feel so happy, even when I&rsquo;m not productive, when my students are productive.</p>
<p>I think that sensation I was describing earlier of they only need to be half as productive</p>
<p>as me for me to feel like I&rsquo;ve done my job for humanity.</p>
<p>So that has been the dynamic I&rsquo;ve had to worry about.</p>
<p>But to be productive is not clear to me what you have to do.</p>
<p>You have to not be miserable otherwise.</p>
<p>I find it extremely hard when I&rsquo;m having conflicts with collaborators, for example, kind of very</p>
<p>hard to enjoy the work we do.</p>
<p>Even if the work is this fantastical phosphine or things that I know I love, still very difficult.</p>
<p>So I think choosing your collaborators based on how well you get along with them is a really</p>
<p>sound scientific choice.</p>
<p>Being a miserable collaborator ruins your whole life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>It makes you not want to do the science.</p>
<p>It probably makes you do clumsy science because you don&rsquo;t focus on it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go over it several times.</p>
<p>You just want it to be over.</p>
<p>And so I think in general, just not being a douchebag can get so much good science done.</p>
<p>Just find the good people in your community and collaborate with them.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re not as good scientists as others, you&rsquo;ll get better science out.</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t be a douchebag yourself and surround yourself by other cool people.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll get better science than if you would try to work with three geniuses</p>
<p>who are just hell to be around.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s parallel things like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fortunate now.</p>
<p>I was very fortunate at MIT to have friends and colleagues there that were incredible</p>
<p>to work with.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m currently sort of, I&rsquo;m doing a lot of fun stuff on the side, like this little</p>
<p>podcast thing and I mentioned to you, I think, robotics related stuff.</p>
<p>I was just at Boston Dynamics yesterday checking out their robots.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m currently, I guess, hiring people to help me with a very fun little project</p>
<p>around those robots.</p>
<p>Want to put an ad in?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I have more applications I can possibly deal with, there&rsquo;s thousands.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an ad, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>We need to put an ad out for someone to help you go through the applications.</p>
<p>Well, that too is already there.</p>
<p>Over 10,000 people apply for that.</p>
<p>An infinite Master Yoshika doll of application management.</p>
<p>But the point is, it&rsquo;s not exactly, the point is, like what I&rsquo;m very distinctly aware of</p>
<p>is life is short and productivity is not the right goal to optimize for, at least for me.</p>
<p>The right goal to optimize for is how happy you are to wake up in the day and to work</p>
<p>with the people that you do.</p>
<p>Because the productivity will take care of itself.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>And so like, it&rsquo;s so important to select the people well.</p>
<p>And I think one of the challenges with academia, as opposed to sort of the thing I&rsquo;m currently</p>
<p>doing is, like, saying goodbye is sometimes a little bit tougher.</p>
<p>Because your colleagues are there, I mean, their goodbye hurts.</p>
<p>And then if you have to spend the rest, you know, for many years to come, still surrounded</p>
<p>by them in the community, it&rsquo;s tougher.</p>
<p>It kind of adds, puts extra pressure to stay in that relationship, in that collaboration.</p>
<p>And in some sense, that makes it much more difficult, but it&rsquo;s still worth it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still worth it to break ties if you don&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;re not happy, if there&rsquo;s not that magic,</p>
<p>that dance.</p>
<p>I talked to this guy named Daniel Kahneman.</p>
<p>Oh, I know.</p>
<p>Danny Kahneman.</p>
<p>Danny, yeah.</p>
<p>Boy, did that guy make me realize, like, what a great collaborator is.</p>
<p>Well, he had Tversky, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they had, obviously, they had a really deep collaboration there, but, like, I collaborated</p>
<p>with him on a conversation, like, just, like, talking about, I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>I think cars, autonomous vehicles, but the brainstorming session, I&rsquo;m like a nobody.</p>
<p>And the fact that he would, with that childlike curiosity and that dance of thoughts and ideas</p>
<p>and the push and pull and the, like, and the lack of ego, but then enough ego to have a</p>
<p>little bit of a stubbornness over an idea and a little bit of humor and all those things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, holy shit, that person, also the ability to truly listen to another human,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, that&rsquo;s what it takes to be a good collaborator.</p>
<p>It made me realize that I haven&rsquo;t been, I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to have cool people in</p>
<p>my life, but there&rsquo;s, like, levels even to the cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think you can compete with Danny Kahneman on cool.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>Everybody was like, okay, I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that collaboration is an</p>
<p>art form, but perhaps it&rsquo;s actually a skill, is allowing yourself to develop that skill</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s one of the fruitful skills.</p>
<p>And praise it in students, you know, and I think it is something you can really improve</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become a better collaborator as the years have gone on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have some innate collaborative skills.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re skills I&rsquo;ve developed, and I think in science there&rsquo;s this really destructive</p>
<p>notion of the lone wolf, the scientist who sees things where others don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s really appealing and people really like either fulfilling that or pretending</p>
<p>to be fulfilling that.</p>
<p>And first of all, it&rsquo;s mostly a lie.</p>
<p>Any modern scientist, particularly in astronomy, which is so interdisciplinary, any modern scientist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing it on their own is doing a crappy job most likely because you need an independent</p>
<p>set of eyes to help you do things.</p>
<p>You need experts in the sub fields that you&rsquo;re working on to check your work.</p>
<p>But most importantly, it&rsquo;s just a bad idea.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t lead to good science and it leaves you miserable.</p>
<p>I was recently, I had some work that I was avoiding and I thought maybe I should pursue</p>
<p>the scientific project because I don&rsquo;t care enough about the outcome and it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>And I was trying to balance these two things to be really difficult.</p>
<p>And the outcome is that maybe 10 people will cite me in the next decade because it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s asking for this question to be answered.</p>
<p>And then I found myself working with this collaborator, Jason Dittman.</p>
<p>And I spent a whole afternoon hours with him working on this and time flew by and I just</p>
<p>felt taller and like I could breathe better.</p>
<p>I was happier, I was a better person when it was done.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s a great collaborator.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a wonderful person that brings out joy out of science that you&rsquo;re doing with</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the trick.</p>
<p>You find the people that make you feel that way about the science you&rsquo;re doing and you</p>
<p>stop worrying about being the lone wolf.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a terrible dream that will leave you miserable and your science will be shit.</p>
<p>And since I&rsquo;m Russian, just murder anybody who doesn&rsquo;t fall into that beautiful collaborative</p>
<p>relationship.</p>
<p>We were talking about books.</p>
<p>Books, yes.</p>
<p>Is there books, movies?</p>
<p>Why was I talking about my productivity?</p>
<p>Oh, you said you maybe don&rsquo;t have time for books and movies.</p>
<p>And you said you must make time for books and movies.</p>
<p>Make time to not work.</p>
<p>Make time to not work whatever that looks like to you.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s plenty.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I found a lot of my scientific fulfillment in books and movies.</p>
<p>Now as I got older, I have plenty of that in my work and I try to read outside my field.</p>
<p>I read about Danny Kahneman&rsquo;s work instead.</p>
<p>But when I was little, it was Contact, the Carl Sagan book.</p>
<p>I really thought I was just like Ellie and I was going to become Ellie.</p>
<p>I really resonated with me, that character and the notions of life and space and the</p>
<p>universe.</p>
<p>Even the idea of then the movie came out and I got to put Jodie Foster in that, which helped.</p>
<p>But even the notion of if it is just us, what an awful waste of space, I find extremely</p>
<p>useful as a concept to think maybe we are special, but that would suck is a really nice</p>
<p>way of thinking of the search for life, that it&rsquo;s much better to not be special and have</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>I got that from Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I always recommend.</p>
<p>Let me ask one other ridiculous question.</p>
<p>We talked about the death and life cycle that is ever present in the universe until it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not, until it&rsquo;s supermassive and little black holes too at the end of the universe.</p>
<p>What do you think is the why, the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life here on Earth and the meaning of that life that</p>
<p>you look for, whether it&rsquo;s on Venus or other exoplanets?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s none.</p>
<p>I find enormous relief in the absence of meaning.</p>
<p>I think chasing for meaning is a human desire that the universe doesn&rsquo;t give two shits about.</p>
<p>But you still enjoy&hellip;</p>
<p>I enjoy finding meaning in my life.</p>
<p>I enjoy finding where the morality lies.</p>
<p>I enjoy the complication of that desire and I feel that is deeply human, but I don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s universal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow absolute.</p>
<p>Like we conjure it up.</p>
<p>We bring it to life through our own minds, but it&rsquo;s not any kind of fundamental way real.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And the same way the sun is not to be blamed for destroying its own planets.</p>
<p>The universe doesn&rsquo;t care because it has no meaning.</p>
<p>It owes us nothing.</p>
<p>And looking for meaning in the universe is demanding answers.</p>
<p>Who are we?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re nothing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get to demand anything and that includes meaning.</p>
<p>And I find it very reassuring because once there is no meaning, I don&rsquo;t have to find</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Once there&rsquo;s no meaning, it&rsquo;s a kind of freedom in a way.</p>
<p>You sound a bit like&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy about it.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a depressing outlook as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who Sam Harris is, but he, despite the pushbacks from the entirety</p>
<p>of the world, really argues hard that free will is an illusion, that the deterministic</p>
<p>universe and it&rsquo;s all already been predetermined and he&rsquo;s okay with it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s happy with it, that he&rsquo;s distinctly aware of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>The quantum world will disagree with him on the deterministic nature of nature.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s not saying it&rsquo;s deterministic, but he&rsquo;s saying that the randomness doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help either.</p>
<p>Randomness does not help in the experience of feeling like you&rsquo;re the decider of your</p>
<p>own actions.</p>
<p>That he kind of is okay with being a leaf flowing on the river, or being the river,</p>
<p>as opposed to having or being like a fish or something that can decide its swimming</p>
<p>direction.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s okay just embracing the flow of life.</p>
<p>I mean, in that same way, it kind of sounds like your conception of meaning.</p>
<p>I mean, it just is.</p>
<p>The universe doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It just is what it is and we experience certain things and some feel good and some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t feel like that about life.</p>
<p>I think life does have meaning and it&rsquo;s laudable to look for that meaning in life.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think you can apply that beyond life and certainly not beyond earth.</p>
<p>That this notion of meaning is a human construct and so it only applies within us and the other</p>
<p>life forms and planet types that suffer from our intrusions or rejoice from our interactions.</p>
<p>But this meaning is ours to do as we please.</p>
<p>We created it, we&rsquo;ve created a need for it, and so that&rsquo;s our problem to solve.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t apply it beyond us.</p>
<p>I think we as humans have a lot of responsibilities, but they&rsquo;re moral responsibilities.</p>
<p>And a lot of those responsibilities are much more easily fulfilled if you find meaning</p>
<p>in them.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s value to meaning, whether it&rsquo;s real or not.</p>
<p>I just think we gain nothing from trying to anthropomorphize the entire universe.</p>
<p>And also that&rsquo;s the height of hubris.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not for us to do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It also could be just like duality and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>It could be both that there is meaning and that there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re somehow depending on the observer, depending on the perspective you take on the</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>I mean, even on earth that&rsquo;s true, but whether things have meaning or not depends a lot on</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s looking.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s us humans, the aliens or the giraffes.</p>
<p>Clara, this was an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>I mean, I learned so much, but I also am just inspired by the passion you have in not finding</p>
<p>meaning in the universe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very passionate about not finding meaning in the universe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the most inspiring nihilist I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>You are truly an inspiring communicator of everything from phosphine to life to quantum</p>
<p>astrochemistry.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what other cool things you do in your career, in your scientific</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for wasting your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>It was my pleasure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d already got my four hours of productivity before I got here.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not a waste.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all downhill from there.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Clara Sousa Silva.</p>
<p>And thank you to Onnit, Grammarly, Blinkist, and Indeed.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.</p>
<p>The earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
