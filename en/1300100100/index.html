<p>we got no guests we got shit this</p>
<p>is the hundredth episode and it will go to</p>
<p>100 the way it began</p>
<p>with no form</p>
<p>not knowing what the fuck we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>sitting in front of a laptop with snow</p>
<p>the stupid karaoke snow effect</p>
<p>yeah i listened to it</p>
<p>today actually on the way over here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlistenable</p>
<p>there is times where there was like 15</p>
<p>seconds 20 seconds of dead air</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re just fucking sitting there</p>
<p>like looking at things yeah</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t really supposed to be on itunes we</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>never let it go on itunes yeah</p>
<p>what it is you</p>
<p>know it was just we were just fucking around we just</p>
<p>what it would</p>
<p>start was it anthony kumia&rsquo;s show</p>
<p>that was actually i remember a</p>
<p>while ago when justin tv came out</p>
<p>we used to always be on the road in the</p>
<p>green room and i always</p>
<p>tried to like</p>
<p>set up like a</p>
<p>video like in the</p>
<p>green room thing we did it a few times the joey diaz</p>
<p>and then joey</p>
<p>diaz got pissed and</p>
<p>twisted my finger remember that</p>
<p>he got mad because he didn&rsquo;t want the camera on anymore</p>
<p>and he grabbed my hand and started</p>
<p>twisting my finger it was</p>
<p>crazy like he got really</p>
<p>upset well joey i</p>
<p>think joey has to be</p>
<p>funny all the time</p>
<p>in his eyes</p>
<p>and when joey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>backstage if he&rsquo;s just sitting there like what</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>wanna do well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even hungry</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want people to see that</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t want people to see the normal</p>
<p>average everyday joey he just wants joey when he&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>so yeah after that that that incident</p>
<p>i was like alright i&rsquo;m not doing this anymore and then</p>
<p>we tried it</p>
<p>again joey&rsquo;s a lot more sensitive than you</p>
<p>think he is man yeah you know joey joey</p>
<p>said something to me remember when i came down when i</p>
<p>when we were headed</p>
<p>to the show in portland and joey got mad yeah well</p>
<p>that was ridiculous</p>
<p>that came out of nowhere too</p>
<p>it was just me and him sitting there</p>
<p>waiting for you to come down and it was really weird</p>
<p>i mean the bottom line was i had to take a shit</p>
<p>and sometimes</p>
<p>was that me yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably me</p>

<p>these big like floppy</p>
<p>truck driver arms</p>
<p>you know and she was a dyke</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no getting</p>
<p>around it she was but she was you know</p>
<p>my friend did not want to come</p>
<p>clean though why</p>
<p>she wants to be normal man</p>
<p>everybody wants to be normal</p>
<p>you remember joey diaz&rsquo;s stories</p>
<p>about wanting to be a</p>
<p>white kid yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not white that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right well i mean that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>ridiculous you hear that bitches that&rsquo;s called a slurp</p>
<p>people go i hate when you make that</p>
<p>slurping noise</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you turn your</p>
<p>microphone off</p>
<p>just fucking deal with it man</p>
<p>when i was listening</p>
<p>to episode number one in the car that was another</p>
<p>thing that the mic</p>
<p>sucks so bad there was parts</p>
<p>where things were</p>
<p>dropping and just blew your</p>
<p>speakers out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>annoying you know one</p>
<p>thing i didn&rsquo;t know is</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>say why do you</p>
<p>stitch her i had no idea</p>
<p>i talked to the president recently and we were talking</p>
<p>about the whole incident and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>the incident</p>
<p>the rss incidents</p>
<p>we had a beer and</p>
<p>you know he said a lot of</p>
<p>things that i had no idea that</p>
<p>stitcher did and one</p>
<p>thing was that</p>
<p>stitcher normalizes the</p>
<p>whole audio</p>
<p>so when there&rsquo;s big loud</p>
<p>bursts and stuff like that</p>
<p>which is what we</p>
<p>should be doing we</p>
<p>should be doing</p>
<p>we actually used to do that</p>
<p>but it made the audio too</p>
<p>quiet because</p>
<p>for some reason i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m not an</p>
<p>audio engineer but it didn&rsquo;t work right</p>
<p>yeah we need compression</p>
<p>i heard that compression</p>
<p>was actually not the way to go though a lot of</p>
<p>audio engineers that work at</p>
<p>radio stations here</p>
<p>in la actually told me that that&rsquo;s not the way to go is</p>
<p>to use software post</p>
<p>who knows post yeah but then you</p>
<p>have to edit it you have to put it through post before</p>
<p>well i think it&rsquo;s just a plug in</p>
<p>in what the program i use which is</p>
<p>logic and it automatically just does that</p>
<p>right but you have to run it</p>
<p>through the program meaning you can&rsquo;t do it live right</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re doing it live</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re doing it live and i</p>
<p>guess there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>by saying there i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about the adam corral show</p>
<p>i have podcast envy</p>
<p>i went to his</p>
<p>setup it&rsquo;s so dope</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s something cool</p>
<p>about that you and i</p>
<p>just chilling in my office</p>
<p>right we always do</p>
<p>it this way it&rsquo;s either in your office or in my office</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where we do it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something cool</p>
<p>about that but</p>
<p>his setups pretty fucking sweet</p>
<p>yeah except</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing a</p>
<p>radio show you actually got</p>
<p>one of the same mics that he used as</p>
<p>i guess mark mehron</p>
<p>and him both used and we</p>
<p>tried it out and didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sound as good</p>
<p>well ours is a lot louder</p>
<p>but i think a part of that is</p>
<p>this show is</p>
<p>a little more unstructured so there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>leaning back and yelling and</p>
<p>stuff like that there&rsquo;s not really any of that</p>
<p>going on in marin show</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not really any of that</p>
<p>going on the corolla show you</p>
<p>know i think</p>
<p>for our purposes</p>
<p>these are better</p>
<p>do you listen to any podcast</p>
<p>besides you know</p>
<p>or do you listen to</p>
<p>here and there i listen to disinfo</p>
<p>i listen to</p>
<p>psychedelic salon</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>salon is kind</p>
<p>of cool because it&rsquo;s a podcast but really it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of old</p>
<p>audio recordings</p>
<p>like old terrence</p>
<p>mckenna recordings</p>
<p>or you know</p>
<p>stuff like that so i listen to that stuff but</p>
<p>honestly i try to listen to the news or</p>
<p>i listen to talk radio</p>
<p>for two reasons</p>
<p>one you know to see if there&rsquo;s anybody that i</p>
<p>agree with and two to see</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s anybody that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>completely out to launch</p>
<p>like i listen to</p>
<p>patriot on sirius</p>
<p>satellite radio</p>
<p>the reason why i</p>
<p>listen to it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all fucking</p>
<p>bananas it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these crazy assholes that want to</p>
<p>bury gold and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ready for the</p>
<p>whole thing to come</p>
<p>tumbling down they got their guns</p>
<p>ready and this is</p>
<p>obama what he&rsquo;s trying to do with this eric andre</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>those guys you don&rsquo;t fall for that shit that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>in the back of your head like oh my god you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right we need to collect gold and</p>
<p>no you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t follow</p>
<p>come on man i</p>
<p>think if the shit hits the fan</p>
<p>gold&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna need we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna need bullets and gasoline that&rsquo;s what i think</p>
<p>bullets gasoline</p>
<p>guns places to stay</p>
<p>somewhere you go</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no radiation</p>
<p>when the shit hits the fan there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>human beings have devised</p>
<p>so many ways to fuck each other up</p>
<p>that if something</p>
<p>ever really chaotic happened at this</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>where we really went into like nuclear</p>
<p>warfare man</p>
<p>golden can help you dog</p>
<p>every time i&rsquo;m away from la</p>
<p>this is the reason</p>
<p>one of the things that</p>
<p>maybe we should</p>
<p>leave la someday</p>
<p>because every time i&rsquo;m away from la like i was</p>
<p>out of town this weekend and when i was away i was like</p>
<p>now&rsquo;s a good time if shit was to happen</p>
<p>this would be a good time because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>out of the crowd i</p>
<p>could escape easier you know</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>whole bunch of traffic and soul vein and like</p>
<p>i think i have like a</p>
<p>whole suitcase of shit i have my computers and</p>
<p>stuff like i</p>
<p>think at a certain</p>
<p>point in time it becomes</p>
<p>completely unnecessary to be in such a</p>
<p>large group of people</p>
<p>the only benefit</p>
<p>of it is that because there&rsquo;s so many people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get and</p>
<p>especially because it&rsquo;s such a like</p>
<p>a desired area</p>
<p>you get a lot of fascinating people here</p>
<p>yeah and like if you</p>
<p>moved to denver like what are you</p>
<p>gonna do with the podcast</p>
<p>fly freddy lockhart</p>
<p>out on a plane</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i think what i</p>
<p>could do is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s three comedy clubs in denver</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two comedy works and there&rsquo;s one improv</p>
<p>i could talk to the people that are coming in for that</p>
<p>i can interview them make it like a</p>
<p>radio show kind of yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>local comics there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>strong local</p>
<p>comic scene</p>
<p>in denver so i</p>
<p>could always</p>
<p>have those guys come on</p>
<p>and we could do skype too i did</p>
<p>ariel hawani his</p>
<p>mma show i did it yesterday</p>
<p>and i did it through skype</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty badass man how did it</p>
<p>sound it sounds</p>
<p>he sounds great</p>
<p>i used that</p>
<p>stupid blue</p>
<p>snowball microphone</p>
<p>the only thing that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of fucked though is that you can&rsquo;t hear your own voice</p>
<p>right and there&rsquo;s ways to set it up that you</p>
<p>could definitely</p>
<p>you could use</p>
<p>these mics yeah</p>
<p>as an example yeah and if i had it set up like this</p>
<p>like in like if i had it set up like this in</p>
<p>colorado and you had it set up like this in</p>
<p>california and we just skyped it together</p>
<p>we could do a podcast it&rsquo;d be pretty easy</p>
<p>once i show you how</p>
<p>sweet colorado is you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>wanna move to yeah</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>as many of your type of girls out there yeah</p>
<p>i know you&rsquo;d have to change your standards</p>
<p>yeah i think</p>
<p>yeah what would</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hippie is just this wet</p>
<p>smuzzly there</p>
<p>right like people that are working out and hippie</p>
<p>yes boulder&rsquo;s a lot of that boulder&rsquo;s hippie</p>
<p>and boulder&rsquo;s people that are in really good</p>
<p>shape right</p>
<p>no one wears makeup</p>
<p>no one looks like a whore yeah</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of a bummer</p>
<p>gonna have to get the girl pregnant</p>
<p>or something there&rsquo;s not a lot of girls</p>
<p>like the ones that you&rsquo;re around all the time in</p>
<p>california there&rsquo;s not a lot that&rsquo;s very rare for the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>yeah well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know i go ups and downs you know my dating is not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>stock market graph is</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t really look for</p>
<p>what i understand</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is living in los angeles is giving you access</p>
<p>to these girls why</p>
<p>leave that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth it that&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>it going at</p>
<p>least you die with a heart on</p>
<p>you can find hot chicks in</p>
<p>colorado they&rsquo;re just not gonna</p>
<p>be quite so needy yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucked up you know ever</p>
<p>since i got in this relationship i already see my</p>
<p>stand up going away</p>
<p>just like how it always does</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like hey do you want to have</p>
<p>sex and hang out with this hot girl or do you want to</p>
<p>stand up and hang out with four guys that you</p>
<p>yeah barely now you got a</p>
<p>tricky situation because if you really want to do</p>
<p>stand up you can&rsquo;t just do it half</p>
<p>hour during my shows or half</p>
<p>hours right</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m making myself good at</p>
<p>night but i&rsquo;m you know i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been writing because when i&rsquo;m you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not writing as much either yeah you&rsquo;re weak weak</p>
<p>you just give in</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s easy to do man i did that when i was in high</p>
<p>school yeah</p>
<p>i said a whole joke about it</p>
<p>about how when i was in high school</p>
<p>i played baseball</p>
<p>i did all these</p>
<p>sports until i</p>
<p>started getting laid</p>
<p>and then i was like</p>
<p>whatever with all that</p>
<p>other stuff</p>
<p>my parents like what</p>
<p>about baseball might</p>
<p>yeah from this new thing</p>
<p>i think i like it more</p>
<p>right you know like once you</p>
<p>start having sex like</p>
<p>like why am i playing baseball yeah</p>
<p>that shit&rsquo;s boring</p>
<p>yeah i was have you you don&rsquo;t have your</p>
<p>first set on tape do you no no</p>
<p>do you yeah i</p>
<p>watched it the</p>
<p>other day it&rsquo;s awful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s horrible what sucks is</p>
<p>just everything sucks do you like the new ones though</p>
<p>i like the new ones definitely</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>like before</p>
<p>you could see the nervousness on</p>
<p>stage and i mean this was 2003 or whatever but</p>
<p>it was gross i can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>fucking imagine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>watch my my sets from like last</p>
<p>night even if i killed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still weird you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard even</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re killing but man if you&rsquo;re not killing</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s painful so painful yeah</p>
<p>stand up you</p>
<p>gotta figure out bro</p>
<p>if you really</p>
<p>wanna do it</p>
<p>cause if you really</p>
<p>wanna do it there&rsquo;s only one way to do it you</p>
<p>gotta go gang busters you</p>
<p>gotta like put together an act</p>
<p>you got a rare opportunity man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>road with me all the time so you get to do</p>
<p>these sets in</p>
<p>front of these</p>
<p>giant crowds i guess</p>
<p>how i look at</p>
<p>standup is more as</p>
<p>i enjoy doing it kind of like i</p>
<p>like doing it playing baseball you know i like bowling</p>
<p>but i guess i&rsquo;m not looking as it in a career wise</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i ever wanted to do it as a career</p>
<p>i think i think</p>
<p>if anything it&rsquo;s just a workout for this podcast even</p>
<p>to make you more comfortable yeah</p>
<p>just more comfortable</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>thinking of</p>
<p>funny ideas and</p>
<p>just being creative</p>
<p>you know because if i&rsquo;m not doing this then i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>painting if i have to be doing something and now</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you just have so much and you need to get out yeah</p>
<p>right shrooms really</p>
<p>is nice to reset that though you need to shroom</p>
<p>yeah soon man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>stream like</p>
<p>the other day and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t the best one</p>
<p>but it definitely just</p>
<p>opens up how you look at</p>
<p>everything so</p>
<p>reset yeah definitely</p>
<p>resetting i do that</p>
<p>every time i get in the tank</p>
<p>yeah thanks a big</p>
<p>reset you need to try that</p>
<p>but yeah any any</p>
<p>any opportunity that you have to</p>
<p>just fucking just step outside of the whole</p>
<p>thing and just</p>
<p>relax and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>take a look at this let&rsquo;s assess this you</p>
<p>know from an even position</p>
<p>so many times in life man you&rsquo;re just on momentum</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>and every one step from the next is like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something pushing behind you and you just keep moving</p>
<p>have you ever forgot to</p>
<p>take off a condom</p>
<p>after sex like not le</p>
<p>who no like</p>
<p>sometimes you know</p>
<p>like all have sex in like</p>
<p>then you know when i come and then i&rsquo;ll take the condom</p>
<p>throw away put a new condom on so i can continue</p>
<p>and then not come</p>
<p>again but i forget i have</p>
<p>that condom on you&rsquo;re getting way too personal i know</p>
<p>i was trying to</p>
<p>clean it up a little bit but</p>
<p>i was srooming and then i went to go piss</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m sitting there going</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>waving it into</p>
<p>the condom yeah i didn&rsquo;t know what the condom</p>
<p>was on and i didn&rsquo;t hear the</p>
<p>water and i&rsquo;m like what the fuck you</p>
<p>might be the laziest</p>
<p>motherfucker i&rsquo;ve ever met in my life but when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so lazy you can&rsquo;t even take your condom off to pee</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s cram</p>
<p>be bothered</p>
<p>you never know</p>
<p>way down there</p>

<p>crazy how much pee</p>
<p>comes out so fast because it was like a full balloon</p>
<p>when i look down</p>

<p>fifth grader you need to slow right</p>
<p>your body yeah you</p>

<p>no yeah sure i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what were we talking about</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about you being lazy as fuck yeah i i i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s either exercise or it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>some kind of</p>
<p>deficiency of some kind probably that i i need like</p>
<p>well i know that</p>
<p>i know friends that are on that adderall shit and they</p>
<p>said oh i needed it to concentrate and</p>
<p>okay i guess but it&rsquo;s speed</p>
<p>you know i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna last very long on</p>
<p>speed yeah you know i don&rsquo;t like what it feels like</p>
<p>i have a cup of coffee during the podcast</p>
<p>and one cup of coffee is fine</p>
<p>but if i have two cups of coffee during the podcast</p>
<p>after the podcast is over i feel all amped up</p>
<p>i feel like ugh</p>
<p>see i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t feel shitty</p>
<p>really i don&rsquo;t feel that at all the only</p>
<p>thing like like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of energy no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work but what i do notice is that i clinch</p>
<p>when i when</p>
<p>instead of feeling that energy i&rsquo;ll find myself like</p>
<p>were you clenching my</p>
<p>teeth really</p>
<p>hard i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>out of nowhere</p>
<p>i do it all</p>
<p>the time i noticed on the way home yesterday</p>
<p>cause i had two cups of coffee here yesterday</p>
<p>and i noticed i was driving i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>why am i clenching my teeth</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>going to my jaw</p>
<p>dude you&rsquo;ve got to be one of the weirdest</p>
<p>motherfuckers i&rsquo;ve ever met</p>
<p>i do it all the time if you if you look back at old you</p>
<p>streams you&rsquo;ll see like this line on my</p>
<p>i do this i bite my</p>
<p>cheek and are you</p>
<p>thinking about anything when you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>doing it i&rsquo;m just like clean like</p>
<p>you have this energy that you got to get out yeah my</p>
<p>mouth squeeze off around yeah</p>
<p>wow maybe you have some like</p>
<p>unaddressed energy issues</p>
<p>you know maybe if you like</p>
<p>started doing something like like</p>
<p>throwing the discus</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>like really physical</p>
<p>like maybe you</p>
<p>would like feel much better i&rsquo;ve been trying this xbox</p>
<p>dance game unconnected</p>
<p>it works pretty good</p>
<p>oh that shit</p>
<p>when are they</p>
<p>gonna have some sort of a martial arts game</p>
<p>where like a</p>
<p>robot does certain moves and you can kick it</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>it like moves forward and you can leg kick it it moves</p>
<p>forward you</p>
<p>punch it it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to do much</p>
<p>i think this is to be a</p>
<p>target i think this</p>
<p>kinect thing i don&rsquo;t know if you know what</p>
<p>kinect is it&rsquo;s like that webcam</p>
<p>thing that they</p>
<p>put you put on top of your tv</p>
<p>and it detects your body</p>
<p>it works i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t played that much but the games i&rsquo;ve played</p>
<p>fucking badass it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>where you just</p>
<p>hold up your hand like you can do netflix we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>streaming through</p>
<p>movies going like this with your hand moving it left or</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>streaming through</p>
<p>movies and then if you want to pick one you</p>
<p>pull your hand out and grab it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of like whatever</p>
<p>minority report or whatever</p>
<p>but they have games too</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have any controllers anymore so</p>
<p>how accurate</p>
<p>is it how effective is it you know from what i</p>
<p>understand it&rsquo;s not the best but i have</p>
<p>never noticed it not being accurate</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s pretty accurate</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>the so as long as you&rsquo;re not playing like a</p>
<p>first person</p>
<p>shooter or something</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d have i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s good enough for that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>enough for that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>based on lighting and</p>
<p>clothing because</p>
<p>the girl i was</p>
<p>with was wearing a</p>
<p>dress and it couldn&rsquo;t detect her</p>
<p>separate legs</p>
<p>so it was kind of fucking up</p>
<p>so she took off her</p>
<p>dress and then</p>
<p>it worked perfect</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a trick it wanted you to be a whore</p>
<p>exactly that&rsquo;s what it is that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i told her it&rsquo;s because you have a</p>
<p>dress on too much</p>
<p>clothes on god what are you doing over here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy so now what if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using it as a</p>
<p>first person</p>
<p>shooter how do you pull triggers</p>
<p>see i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t played a</p>
<p>first person</p>
<p>shooter but what i</p>
<p>would imagine</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;d be weird</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do it</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about that one</p>
<p>thing but there is a</p>
<p>crazy first person</p>
<p>shooter that</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about something no no why</p>
<p>not because i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s known</p>
<p>somebody tell us this no</p>
<p>that the the</p>
<p>video that i showed you that</p>
<p>kevin pereira</p>
<p>might have showed us</p>
<p>oh right right</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>right yeah yeah that&rsquo;s all incognito</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>yeah because you got to</p>
<p>think of a guy if you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>first person</p>
<p>shooter you got</p>
<p>got to deal with two</p>
<p>things one how</p>
<p>do you simulate movement like how do you go forward</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re running how do you run forward</p>
<p>and how does the machine know you&rsquo;re running back</p>
<p>yeah because you&rsquo;re not moving forward though no</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something to do with your hands like because with the</p>
<p>dance game it was like</p>
<p>you do something</p>
<p>like that that means forward you go like this and you</p>
<p>shake your hand to the</p>
<p>right that means you&rsquo;re shooting</p>
<p>ideally what you</p>
<p>want is like a giant</p>
<p>dome or a ball</p>
<p>rather and you be inside that ball like a</p>
<p>hamster ball</p>
<p>right and that ball</p>
<p>you have like some sort of a 3d helmet on like</p>
<p>a complete you know</p>
<p>what is it virtual reality</p>
<p>complete virtual reality helmet on</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>would be walking around with this ball you</p>
<p>could walk in any direction</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t feel totally real</p>
<p>like you would kind of be realizing that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on a ball and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stuck in this you know in this</p>
<p>thing but that</p>
<p>would be i mean</p>
<p>other than that how the fuck else</p>
<p>could you simulate movement</p>
<p>unless you just did it</p>
<p>inside like the</p>
<p>virtual reality then it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>virtual anymore</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to do it inside like</p>
<p>put a program and then make make a program the</p>
<p>exact parameters of say an airplane hangar</p>
<p>right and then you have an</p>
<p>empty airplane</p>
<p>hangar and they walk around inside that hangar</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>wired and you</p>
<p>could do it that way but then that kind of</p>
<p>defeats the</p>
<p>whole purpose of</p>
<p>virtual reality</p>
<p>right yeah the idea is that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to be able to do it wherever you are yeah</p>
<p>would you ever go to burning man</p>
<p>no why not too many hippies</p>
<p>too many hippies</p>
<p>i learned about hippies when i</p>
<p>moved to boulder</p>
<p>i like them in theory yeah</p>
<p>i like them in theory</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like a lot of people that are asking for</p>
<p>money all the time i find that shit be very annoying</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>people playing shitty songs and wanting a dollar</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>for the most part they&rsquo;re cool but</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>of that hippie movement that wants people to help them</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>this is how i feel</p>
<p>about that if i felt like</p>
<p>everybody was on the ball and everybody was doing</p>
<p>their best and</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>generous person and i</p>
<p>think one of the</p>
<p>things about being</p>
<p>generous is</p>
<p>if you have the opportunity to do so</p>
<p>it feels really good to be generous</p>
<p>especially if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t affect you it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>generous and it&rsquo;s hurting you</p>
<p>so i think it&rsquo;s important but</p>
<p>in passing say you&rsquo;re passing love to the left</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a big circle of people man</p>
<p>the real problem is there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking people</p>
<p>that never keep passing</p>
<p>the love they take it and then they walk away you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people that are always there for you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>their best and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>their life and you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>your best you&rsquo;re living life and you&rsquo;re helping each</p>
<p>other and you hey man can i borrow</p>
<p>your truck i</p>
<p>gotta move fuck yeah</p>
<p>man come on over dude anytime you got my shit you know</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re friends you help me i help you</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all together but we all know</p>
<p>those the few people that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>contribute they always need something and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>contribute and my</p>
<p>experience that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>experience with hippies</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my experience with</p>
<p>lot of people that you know</p>
<p>are like really into like socialist ideals</p>
<p>a lot of it is because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking lazy man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking lazy and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t work that hard and they don&rsquo;t do their part</p>
<p>and they somehow or another feel like the whole</p>
<p>system is unfair man</p>
<p>which fuck yeah of course it is of course it&rsquo;s unfair</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s corrupt of</p>
<p>course it&rsquo;s fucked up but that&rsquo;s not why you&rsquo;re a loser</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that aren&rsquo;t losers</p>
<p>most people are losers</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re lazy as shit</p>
<p>and they wanna</p>
<p>blame other people for that and they</p>
<p>wanna blame society and they</p>
<p>wanna blame</p>
<p>look society is</p>
<p>completely fucked but</p>
<p>guess what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like this one person that makes it fuck the</p>
<p>whole thing is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fuck cause it&rsquo;s on a</p>
<p>foundation of bullshit</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense but knowing that</p>
<p>you see what it is</p>
<p>make your path</p>
<p>make your path</p>
<p>figure out something that you can do to feed yourself</p>
<p>okay figure out something you can</p>
<p>do to put a roof over your head just figure it out man</p>
<p>fucking figure it out</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to be a fucking asshole to be</p>
<p>successful doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to be a part of the</p>
<p>system man no just</p>
<p>stop asking people for</p>
<p>money stop being a fucking mooch</p>
<p>get your shit together okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my problem with hippies</p>
<p>my problem with hippies is</p>
<p>part of the</p>
<p>whole idea of being a hippies</p>
<p>being like really nice and being really relaxed</p>
<p>and sometimes life does not call for that</p>
<p>sometimes life calls for you</p>
<p>gotta get off your fucking ass</p>
<p>and make something happen man</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot i had a friend who</p>
<p>his girlfriend</p>
<p>was having a baby this is many many years ago</p>
<p>and i had a</p>
<p>fucking scream at this guy this guy was unemployed</p>
<p>and he was like you would</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t get his shit together</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t make something</p>
<p>happen he was trying to be a comedian for a while</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>and then he was trying to do some</p>
<p>other stuff</p>
<p>trying to do some</p>
<p>radio and a</p>
<p>bunch of and we had this conversation and i&rsquo;m like man</p>
<p>you gotta realize you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna become that fucking guy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna become that</p>
<p>unbelievably pathetic guy who can&rsquo;t feed his kids</p>
<p>right you gotta fucking do something man you</p>
<p>gotta make something happen</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>hey you know we really need some food you</p>
<p>think you could help us</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the hippie</p>
<p>approach to go to people and</p>
<p>you gotta make your own fucking way you</p>
<p>gotta make your own way</p>
<p>and that was my problem with boulder</p>
<p>and that would</p>
<p>ultimately i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;d be my problem with portland</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit of my problem with san francisco and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that i&rsquo;m not a kind person i&rsquo;m a very kind person</p>
<p>but i recognize the difference between</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s in need and someone who&rsquo;s fucking lazy</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are just weak</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re weak as shit man and they have</p>
<p>no philosophy to live</p>
<p>their life by they have no</p>
<p>discipline that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve developed over years of trying to accomplish</p>
<p>things to the</p>
<p>point where they have this sense</p>
<p>of personal</p>
<p>sovereignty they can take care of themselves and</p>
<p>occasionally everybody needs help</p>
<p>but if somebody will help you if they</p>
<p>know that you&rsquo;re the type of person that will help them</p>
<p>and if you know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re the type of person that does</p>
<p>their best what</p>
<p>drives me nuts is when</p>
<p>someone wants help</p>
<p>like motherfucker</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even helping yourself</p>
<p>like look what you&rsquo;re doing for yourself</p>
<p>and you want someone</p>
<p>else to step in and manage your fucking situation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that is the number one problem with the whole idea</p>
<p>of everyone together man</p>
<p>the real problem is that everyone</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do their fucking part man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real problem</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of lazy bitches in this world</p>
<p>yeah the reason why i was asking</p>
<p>about burning man is i</p>
<p>often thought the same</p>
<p>thing like fuck hippies</p>
<p>you know because i&rsquo;ve been there done that i hate it</p>
<p>you know i hated</p>
<p>the people to that the lazy if there&rsquo;s good there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great hippies</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s legit hippies</p>
<p>right but i hung out with bad hippies they got bad you</p>
<p>like everything else it&rsquo;s like mma fans</p>
<p>you know i have a lot of friends that are</p>
<p>mma fans i have friends have</p>
<p>graduated from harvard</p>
<p>friends that are fucking i know guys who are scientists</p>
<p>the guy who created</p>
<p>beavis and butthead mike judge huge</p>
<p>mma fan there&rsquo;s a lot of intelligent</p>
<p>mma fans yeah</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>idiots yeah</p>
<p>but i was looking at</p>
<p>these videos lately cause the girl goes</p>
<p>every year or whatever</p>
<p>and so there is some fucking cool shit</p>
<p>going on at burning man i&rsquo;m sure like</p>
<p>and i guess you can rent</p>
<p>these big rvs you know and that&rsquo;s the way to do it so</p>
<p>they have your rv don&rsquo;t like live in a tent or whatever</p>
<p>they have showers and stuff</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>thing called i don&rsquo;t know if you ever</p>
<p>heard of it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what are they called</p>
<p>her most shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s zero tropes have you</p>
<p>heard of a zero trope</p>
<p>zero trope i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry zoe trope</p>
<p>zoe trope z o e</p>
<p>t r o p e what it is</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s like a carousel type</p>
<p>thing like a</p>
<p>merry go round</p>
<p>and each kind of</p>
<p>a couple feet there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a draw or there&rsquo;s some kind of</p>
<p>sculpture like it&rsquo;s like a monkey</p>
<p>hanging from</p>
<p>a vine and then the next one like</p>
<p>three feet over</p>
<p>is the same</p>
<p>monkey but it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>changing a little you</p>
<p>know so when it turns</p>
<p>and you have a</p>
<p>flashing light that just</p>
<p>flashes at a certain rate oh</p>
<p>wow it looks like the</p>
<p>monkeys are moving</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>middle of this desert and there&rsquo;s like they have these</p>
<p>statues of like people diving</p>
<p>down into the ground that just melt into the ground</p>
<p>they have like</p>
<p>these monkey</p>
<p>that are spinning</p>
<p>check this out</p>
<p>right here here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a monkey one</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you can see this</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a monkey oh that is badass and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking trippy</p>
<p>so anyways so basically</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done is animation animation yeah</p>
<p>and just like the old claymation</p>
<p>models i used to use for</p>
<p>king kong and shit</p>
<p>or like an old flip book</p>
<p>where you draw</p>
<p>on a flip pic and you flip it through that&rsquo;s badass man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m down with the artistic end of it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m down with</p>
<p>the whole idea of</p>
<p>all these artists getting together and doing cool shit</p>
<p>i just think there&rsquo;d be a lot of</p>
<p>stinky people</p>
<p>i just wonder why i don&rsquo;t know or</p>
<p>maybe they have why</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t a collection</p>
<p>of people like yourself</p>
<p>do a comedy show</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>cause that is</p>
<p>huge no i&rsquo;d rather not perform there</p>
<p>if i was gonna go there</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d just wanna hang out have</p>
<p>fun well i mean you can</p>
<p>hang out before</p>
<p>and imagine performing once</p>
<p>like a woodstock of comedy</p>
<p>psychedelic comedy</p>
<p>there would be so much mushrooms and so much</p>
<p>everything else</p>
<p>going around</p>
<p>i would be too fucked up</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t want to be talking on</p>
<p>stage through a microphone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the last</p>
<p>thing you want to do when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>shrooms oh i mean yeah you just don&rsquo;t do shrooms that</p>
<p>hour and a half two</p>
<p>hours yeah i</p>
<p>think if you&rsquo;re there you just want to</p>
<p>experience it that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>would want to</p>
<p>do yeah i perform enough man i perform plenty</p>
<p>you know i think</p>
<p>freddy soto used to say this</p>
<p>back in the day you</p>
<p>know people used to offer freddie gigs at like bars and</p>
<p>stuff like that is in his like</p>
<p>no thank you i</p>
<p>appreciate it but i only do comedy clubs man that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>and that was his he just is like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>worth it man you go to</p>
<p>these bars and everyone&rsquo;s talking and</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do your act</p>
<p>right you rush it because you&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>their attention</p>
<p>he was totally right</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s totally right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of how i am right now</p>
<p>i only do shows i&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my show i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>it i&rsquo;m at this theater come see me i&rsquo;m at this comedy</p>
<p>club come and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no problems there&rsquo;s no hassles it is what it is</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>two in a fucking like you&rsquo;re in a tent with some</p>
<p>speakers and you&rsquo;re on this</p>
<p>stage and all</p>
<p>these people are all</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all fucked out of</p>
<p>their minds you know why</p>
<p>should they pay attention to you they shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you would feel</p>
<p>illegitimate</p>
<p>standing there</p>
<p>asking them to if you knew that everyone in the</p>
<p>crowd was on mushrooms</p>
<p>you would have nothing to say</p>
<p>unless i&rsquo;m on mushrooms too what am i</p>
<p>gonna tell you guys</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not gonna tell you shit man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re communicating with</p>
<p>the alien overlords right now</p>
<p>these beings that have come on asteroids and</p>
<p>their spores have infested this earth</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re communicating with them through eating them</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m gonna tell you some stupid</p>
<p>dick joke yeah you&rsquo;re pretty pretty</p>
<p>known for being a psychic</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>speaker i mean</p>
<p>you always do the marijuana shows here in town and</p>
<p>stuff like that for</p>
<p>the same reason to the same kind of people yeah but i</p>
<p>think part of</p>
<p>being into psychedelics and</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>psychedelics and have had</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences it sort of negates</p>
<p>any idea of you</p>
<p>wanting that sort of attention</p>
<p>like doing a show</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re doing a show</p>
<p>the beautiful thing</p>
<p>about a show is that people</p>
<p>enjoy and they have</p>
<p>a good fucking time they come see a comedy show but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what you want to do when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>jazzed out of your head</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna go see a comedy show</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna see anything</p>
<p>structured i certainly don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>someone on stage</p>
<p>forcing there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things you say on</p>
<p>stage in a comedy show</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just to get a laugh</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s there for it&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>to spice up the show to have more fun</p>
<p>and those things will</p>
<p>stand out like</p>
<p>like fucking wet shits in your</p>
<p>underwear they just like</p>
<p>oh what&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on mushrooms</p>
<p>every like jokey joke that you have will just be like</p>
<p>bring doug benson some</p>
<p>black lights and some body</p>
<p>paint might be a good time</p>
<p>doug benson</p>
<p>would just be hugging girls hi you can have a hug too</p>
<p>can we have a hug i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never met anybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s high more consistently than doug benson</p>
<p>yeah every now and then he&rsquo;ll send me a</p>
<p>tweet you&rsquo;re high</p>
<p>right now aren&rsquo;t you a text message you&rsquo;re high</p>
<p>right now aren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>like i know you are</p>
<p>motherfucker it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny because i</p>
<p>never knew that was real</p>
<p>like when i first</p>
<p>met really when i</p>
<p>first met doug i thought the</p>
<p>whole marijuana</p>
<p>thing was kind of like</p>
<p>an act kind of like an andrew dice clay kind of like</p>
<p>you know like he was doing i mean he</p>
<p>might have smoked weed but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>the crazy stoner and</p>
<p>just after hanging out with him that</p>
<p>first night</p>
<p>oh fuck yeah immediately he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>every five minutes hey let&rsquo;s go back to your</p>
<p>hotel room and</p>
<p>smoke some another joint</p>
<p>yeah he those guys like to</p>
<p>go deep man there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some dudes who go real deep</p>
<p>those guys in involved in the medical marijuana like</p>
<p>those those look like normal and</p>
<p>those guys go so deep</p>
<p>we were not normal but</p>
<p>the cannabis cup that was</p>
<p>the deepest that i&rsquo;ve ever been there was on melrose</p>
<p>in hollywood</p>
<p>i was one of the judges</p>
<p>and it was at a head shop</p>
<p>and they closed the head shop down they</p>
<p>papered up the window so no one</p>
<p>could see inside</p>
<p>they put a doorman in the back locked the front</p>
<p>and then they turned the</p>
<p>whole thing into this cannabis cup party</p>
<p>really fucking bold move man</p>
<p>because they did this shit in the middle of hollywood</p>
<p>and the place was just</p>
<p>filled with weed</p>
<p>i mean it was</p>
<p>unbelievable and no one stopped they just kept</p>
<p>going deeper and deeper and deeper</p>
<p>until i left</p>
<p>there i went to get something to eat i was like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way i can</p>
<p>drive home right now</p>
<p>i just got to hang out for a few</p>
<p>hours i had to hang out</p>
<p>i mean most of the time when you&rsquo;re high</p>
<p>driving is not an issue</p>
<p>because driving</p>
<p>is not any more complicated than walking</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not smoking indica</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not smoking some dopey weed you know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re driving and you&rsquo;re high you know just</p>
<p>be extra careful</p>
<p>watch what you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t affect your hand eye coordination i mean i do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu on weed i</p>
<p>kickboxing weed is not a problem but</p>
<p>but i was so high then i was like no fucking way man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna drive this</p>
<p>thing and risk not being in control of my senses</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna have a cup of coffee</p>
<p>and have some</p>
<p>food and just fucking sit back and read my cell</p>
<p>phone for a little bit</p>
<p>go over my notes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll sit down for a bit before i drive home</p>
<p>it was too stupid</p>
<p>because like you get to a certain point</p>
<p>when people are like everybody&rsquo;s handing you cookies</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a vaporizer bag hit this</p>
<p>this is a new blunt</p>
<p>paper that are developed hit that</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s passing joints left to</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>never ending</p>
<p>like a cyclone</p>
<p>of joints getting passed around it was fucking</p>
<p>ridiculous but you get to this</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even high anymore it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>high anymore it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not there it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you were in a room</p>
<p>and the room has one window and it&rsquo;s a circular window</p>
<p>and the room is like four</p>
<p>by four wide you can&rsquo;t even move it&rsquo;s not even a toilet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just you you in that room in that circular window</p>
<p>and that circle</p>
<p>window is now how you view the rest of the world</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking out that window</p>
<p>going what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on out there</p>
<p>cause this is crazy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s happening out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re detached</p>
<p>from the world you&rsquo;re so high</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re detached</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>those things if</p>
<p>anybody ever wanted like</p>
<p>some sort of argument</p>
<p>against the</p>
<p>cause right</p>
<p>go to one of</p>
<p>those cannabis cups man</p>
<p>the good thing is man everybody is friendly as fuck</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been to</p>
<p>shit a hundred medical marijuana shows or you know</p>
<p>parties or parties at the playboy mansion</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen so much as an argument</p>
<p>never seen a raised voice</p>
<p>yeah never seen a push</p>
<p>never seen anybody get</p>
<p>crazy not even girls you know</p>
<p>i mean every time you go out some girl will be</p>
<p>talking shit to some other girl</p>
<p>everywhere in</p>
<p>vegas and la anywhere so</p>
<p>if you stay around the</p>
<p>night long enough and pay attention you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna hear some girl yell at some girl</p>
<p>right yeah totally but not in</p>
<p>those weed shows</p>
<p>those weed shows everybody is just so nice</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just people if people really realize what it</p>
<p>could do for you</p>
<p>you know so many people like i have a friend who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>super organized and like he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really ambitious and</p>
<p>he produces</p>
<p>television shows like</p>
<p>a real go getter very nice guy</p>
<p>and but he&rsquo;s so anal and</p>
<p>just fucking</p>
<p>wound up about shit he only wears black</p>
<p>he won&rsquo;t wear anything other than</p>
<p>black oh really his whole</p>
<p>out like you open up his wardrobe it&rsquo;s black</p>
<p>shirt is it</p>
<p>weird when somebody does that or</p>
<p>would they only wear the</p>
<p>white t shirt like john cap</p>
<p>caparella it&rsquo;s that his name</p>
<p>do that he only wears</p>
<p>white t shirt</p>
<p>you know like every day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like his outfit yeah</p>
<p>uniform when he goes</p>
<p>to work yeah does he</p>
<p>wear it like when he goes out on dates only that white</p>
<p>t shirt that i don&rsquo;t know but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely a</p>
<p>jask amount of dates what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>vagina for me</p>
<p>well yeah but</p>
<p>like there is people like that that like only wear</p>
<p>certain things like</p>
<p>well this dude isn&rsquo;t just in badly in need of a joint</p>
<p>i keep telling him i go dude just</p>
<p>trust me man just trust me</p>
<p>just try a little weed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll help you relax</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re a good guy you got a lot of good</p>
<p>things going on</p>
<p>you just need a little</p>
<p>fresh perspective man and that&rsquo;s totally true look</p>
<p>you had a live</p>
<p>proofing the</p>
<p>other day on that podcast 98</p>
<p>it was like you just need to</p>
<p>smoke weed immediately</p>
<p>after smoking weed</p>
<p>everything was great</p>
<p>you know podcast 98</p>
<p>aka the disaster</p>
<p>the disaster</p>
<p>brian whitaker</p>
<p>apparently is very</p>
<p>upset with the depictions of him</p>
<p>on that podcast</p>
<p>tweeting mean</p>
<p>things to you yeah he</p>
<p>started attacking me on twitter just like today</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>all right the</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>make sure that people that</p>
<p>are at home</p>
<p>can listen to this podcast</p>
<p>and understand what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on instead of having a million people</p>
<p>talking at once there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no attack on you i understand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying so for the people that don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that podcast and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>worth listening to it wasn&rsquo;t a good one but</p>
<p>there was just</p>
<p>he just had an</p>
<p>issue where he didn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>be on a podcast he didn&rsquo;t know that you can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>while other people are talking</p>
<p>right and it wasn&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have a chance to</p>
<p>prepare he just</p>
<p>got thrown into it you know he didn&rsquo;t even know he was</p>
<p>gonna be doing it</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about him too much</p>
<p>we have talked</p>
<p>about he&rsquo;s a good dude he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re doing his</p>
<p>thing and it&rsquo;s hard out there for a pimp</p>
<p>yeah but at</p>
<p>least it&rsquo;s easier when you work at the improv</p>
<p>you know you get stage time</p>
<p>is that your dig</p>
<p>is that your last dig at him</p>
<p>because he had to</p>
<p>get you you get a lot of people</p>
<p>that hate on you man of course i&rsquo;ve always had that</p>
<p>ever since i</p>
<p>started talking to you i&rsquo;ve been getting haters</p>
<p>you start talking to me</p>
<p>yeah man people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>respect the red band yeah</p>
<p>cause people</p>
<p>well whenever you do something i mean even</p>
<p>you do comedy people look at it and god looks so easy i</p>
<p>could do that too and you ain&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>funny i could fucking do that</p>
<p>then you know they look at you and</p>
<p>was you know how to make edit some</p>
<p>videos or something fucking i can do that too</p>
<p>you know they just</p>
<p>they look at</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s in a nice spot and i</p>
<p>think what the fuck why isn&rsquo;t that me you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to not be jealous man there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>some ingrained shit i see with my kids</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting the</p>
<p>three year old and the one year old</p>
<p>i sometimes a</p>
<p>three year old</p>
<p>would get upset at the one year old if</p>
<p>the one year old getting too much attention she&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>things from her and</p>
<p>stuff and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they just it&rsquo;s just nature</p>
<p>nature wants you you</p>
<p>wanna collect all that love</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people develop</p>
<p>great personalities they develop</p>
<p>great personalities</p>
<p>cause they realize somewhere</p>
<p>along the line</p>
<p>with rewards</p>
<p>is that when you have a</p>
<p>great personality the reward is people are</p>
<p>always nice to you you get all this nice energy people</p>
<p>wanna be around you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reason why</p>
<p>great personalities get invented</p>
<p>because people become whores for</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s love</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really what it is i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>thing in both ways</p>
<p>but really the root of it all is that people</p>
<p>really want positive attention</p>
<p>so when you see like little jealousy</p>
<p>and like little kids and then you see jealousy and like</p>
<p>grown adults</p>
<p>you know you see like really</p>
<p>petty shit and haters and</p>
<p>i love to go on like</p>
<p>those gossip blogs</p>
<p>you know and just just to read i don&rsquo;t even know who</p>
<p>these people are</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>someone will you know to be someone from the bachelor</p>
<p>or someone from some i just like to read the comments</p>
<p>just i don&rsquo;t even know what the fuck the</p>
<p>story&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>half the time he can&rsquo;t pay</p>
<p>his baby and you</p>
<p>have mom and they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>court whatever whatever what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in the comments</p>
<p>and i go down in the comments and it just</p>
<p>hates yeah it is</p>
<p>hate evilness</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s ridiculous because when people</p>
<p>the biggest</p>
<p>thing is like if it wasn&rsquo;t for rogan</p>
<p>this and that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like yeah</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>for rogan he saw my work he liked what i did</p>
<p>he hired talking</p>
<p>about me like i&rsquo;m not even here</p>
<p>i know but what is like a company like nbc</p>
<p>like jay leno should</p>
<p>people are mad at jay like if it wasn&rsquo;t for nbc you</p>
<p>would be nobody you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s me getting</p>
<p>jo sing my work and then hiring me i got a job</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really simple he&rsquo;s an artist hello</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an artist and he was creating</p>
<p>things that i thought were very</p>
<p>worthwhile and so i hired him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really simple pretty easy</p>
<p>and people that</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird dynamic</p>
<p>people like you know</p>
<p>how are you guys friends you guys are so different like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to be the</p>
<p>same as your fucking friends man that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s silly</p>

<p>but now i do all the time</p>
<p>i do all the time</p>
<p>i like a nice</p>
<p>strong red wine with like a</p>
<p>steak it just</p>
<p>tastes better it&rsquo;s like this little</p>
<p>you know this is</p>
<p>thing the flavor is all combining</p>
<p>and as i&rsquo;ve gotten like</p>
<p>matt lichtenberg my buddy</p>
<p>is a huge wine fanatic he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a wine geek</p>
<p>i mean he has this</p>
<p>crazy wine cellar</p>
<p>in his home with some insane amount of</p>
<p>money worth of wine in it and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that can</p>
<p>tell you why a wine is good and what year it&rsquo;s good and</p>
<p>you know what what part of the country it comes from</p>
<p>and all that kind of shit</p>
<p>and when when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re around a guy like that and they know so much</p>
<p>about why then you</p>
<p>start to sort of</p>
<p>appreciate it like okay this is some weird</p>
<p>tasting art form</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re trying to create this ultimate</p>
<p>taste and it&rsquo;s a very specific taste</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing like the</p>
<p>whole idea of acquired</p>
<p>taste i used to</p>
<p>think that was so</p>
<p>stupid like why</p>
<p>would you acquire a</p>
<p>taste for something like caviar</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>stuff you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super expensive and</p>
<p>it really kind of</p>
<p>tastes like shit when you</p>
<p>first take it</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you just</p>
<p>okay it tastes like shit forever and this is what it is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about it anymore</p>
<p>but no people get into it and then they</p>
<p>start getting</p>
<p>more and more expensive</p>
<p>tastes and you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s thousands and thousands of dollars for</p>
<p>these salty fucking</p>
<p>stupid fish eggs</p>
<p>well wine is kind of like that too</p>
<p>and that like the</p>
<p>first time you try wine like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like a little kid or something like who the fuck</p>
<p>would get into that</p>
<p>but when you really like</p>
<p>get a nice pinot noir</p>
<p>and a delicious steak</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re cut into that steak</p>
<p>and then you have a sip of the wine like ah</p>
<p>all the flavors together</p>
<p>takes a while to</p>
<p>appreciate it</p>
<p>but knowing someone who knows as much</p>
<p>about wine as i do</p>
<p>i mean he tells me so much about</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about how they put it in</p>
<p>what kind of barrels they use to</p>
<p>store it and how they</p>
<p>store it and how long they</p>
<p>store it and</p>
<p>how long has it been bottled for and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty amazing</p>
<p>one of the wineries</p>
<p>i went to they did cheese pairings</p>
<p>which is cool because</p>
<p>you never you</p>
<p>think okay they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna mix this cheese with this wine yeah it&rsquo;s</p>

<p>subject for a joke chances are someone&rsquo;s already done</p>
<p>100 jokes on it</p>
<p>you know when i looked up the other day</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m writing this</p>
<p>chapter in my book</p>
<p>and it has to do with porn</p>
<p>and so i was talking</p>
<p>about the moment</p>
<p>that i realized that the internet was taking porn to a</p>
<p>whole new level</p>
<p>was the moment</p>
<p>i forget who it was it</p>
<p>might have been duncan</p>
<p>sent me an email and the</p>
<p>email heading said home run</p>
<p>and then i opened up the</p>
<p>email and it</p>
<p>just said i love people in all capital letters</p>
<p>and a link so i</p>
<p>click the link</p>
<p>and it opens up it&rsquo;s belladonna</p>
<p>on all fours with a baseball bat</p>
<p>stuffed in her asshole</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stuffed in there</p>
<p>fat end first</p>
<p>which i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think was possible</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>double facepalming like the home</p>
<p>alone kid and going</p>
<p>this bitch is just taking shit to another</p>
<p>level she stuffed the baseball</p>
<p>and then i thought about it</p>
<p>or is she taking it to another level</p>
<p>and i went and did a google search</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s two million</p>
<p>eight hundred thousand</p>
<p>hits for baseball bat in the ass yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>and you know what</p>
<p>normal shit</p>
<p>no you know when she</p>
<p>when she did that she used to tweet about</p>
<p>that where she was stretching it out for like a</p>
<p>whole week like i got a big anal scene</p>
<p>you know and so she had like all</p>
<p>these butt plugs and she just</p>
<p>spent the week getting</p>
<p>ready for doing shit like that</p>
<p>you know she doesn&rsquo;t do porn anymore i</p>
<p>heard i heard she retired</p>
<p>well she had that really sad interview</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember what it was for whether it was</p>
<p>nightline or one of those shows but</p>
<p>you know where they</p>
<p>they you know they made her feel bad</p>
<p>about it and you know and they</p>
<p>asked her you know what</p>
<p>happened to you how did you become this porn star and</p>
<p>they kind of like go over her past and shit like that</p>
<p>and then at the end she was like you</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;m done i&rsquo;m not doing this anymore and then they</p>
<p>found out afterwards she had done some more</p>
<p>movies after</p>
<p>the you know</p>
<p>after she said that all</p>
<p>right it was</p>
<p>weird was like</p>
<p>you know you kind of</p>
<p>wanted to root for her to get out of it and then she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in it and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know fucking</p>
<p>not everybody</p>
<p>could be a ballet</p>
<p>instructor okay</p>
<p>some some people are</p>
<p>gonna be porn stars and by the time they&rsquo;re that</p>
<p>age where they&rsquo;re gonna be porn stars</p>
<p>man the least of</p>
<p>their problems is fucking on film that&rsquo;s the least of</p>
<p>their problems is that baseball in their ass that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>least their problems</p>
<p>the big problem is what</p>
<p>what have you</p>
<p>become that you&rsquo;re letting someone put a baseball bat</p>
<p>in your ass what has happened to you to get you to this</p>
<p>point it&rsquo;s not the bat itself that&rsquo;s not the real issue</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s who who are you</p>
<p>like what kind of a strange person are you</p>
<p>that you you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got your asshole up in the air and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>giant log in it a big fucking bat</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s 2</p>
<p>million 800 000 hits of that always</p>
<p>yeah but then you also</p>
<p>think about it</p>
<p>if that only</p>
<p>is bad if you look if you</p>
<p>think it is bad</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>if i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s good for anybody&rsquo;s asshole</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like hey i</p>
<p>could put yeah i know but</p>
<p>hey i could put a baseball bat</p>
<p>in my ass that</p>
<p>equals 20 000</p>
<p>okay do you think</p>
<p>they get paid that much</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they do</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t think they do either i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>grand if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lucky and i think that</p>
<p>might have been during the heyday</p>
<p>you know i think nowadays</p>
<p>you know those</p>
<p>girls were getting like half million dollar vivid deals</p>
<p>you remember i remember</p>
<p>hanging out with jenna</p>
<p>jameson&rsquo;s husband and he was</p>
<p>a producer and he was giving me the whole</p>
<p>skinny on how much</p>
<p>money there is in the porn industry and this dude</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>had all the numbers and i was like that is incredible</p>
<p>like there was so much money</p>
<p>and then the internet came</p>
<p>along the internet just robbed them all</p>
<p>yeah sucked it all away and now i mean</p>
<p>how the fuck do you make</p>
<p>money now doing porn well i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely still</p>
<p>money there it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>you just have to do more</p>
<p>like i know a lot of</p>
<p>these girls they&rsquo;ll do like</p>
<p>a spanking video and make 500</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do another video</p>
<p>later that day</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just them</p>
<p>masturbating</p>
<p>and they get a thousand you know so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>then you think</p>
<p>of it that way he&rsquo;s like alright you just made 2 000</p>
<p>today and is it for a website is that what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for most of</p>
<p>these are websites</p>
<p>you know fetish websites or you know exchanging content</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>the the weirdest</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>knowing all</p>
<p>these pornstars i</p>
<p>think the saddest</p>
<p>thing is not even what</p>
<p>how they got into it or that they</p>
<p>do it because i don&rsquo;t have a problem with it is that</p>
<p>their future</p>
<p>because a lot of them don&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>an idea yeah once that they&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>athletes yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>fighters i mean is that</p>
<p>where you go to</p>
<p>you know like a</p>
<p>truck stopper</p>
<p>is that really</p>
<p>older woman then you&rsquo;re just like wow she used to be a</p>
<p>yeah you know playboy bunny</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>look this avenue</p>
<p>this internet avenue has opened up the door</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s way way way more porn stars than they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>everywhere back in the day</p>
<p>you know and porn is so much more available</p>
<p>when i was a kid</p>
<p>the way you got porn was magazines</p>
<p>when i was a kid</p>
<p>vhss came out</p>
<p>while i was in high</p>
<p>school i remember</p>
<p>we got one it was like a big deal at our house</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>my dad had a couple</p>
<p>my stepfather had a couple</p>
<p>laying around the</p>
<p>house too and i got to watch</p>
<p>those two and i was like what the hell is this you</p>
<p>know to go from like</p>
<p>it never existed or</p>
<p>every now and then you saw a</p>
<p>magazine and the</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>about those</p>
<p>magazines were</p>
<p>they had rules</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;d buy a porn</p>
<p>magazine but there was</p>
<p>rules and one of the rules was the man couldn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>heart on yeah</p>
<p>they still have</p>
<p>those rules really yeah like</p>
<p>where they can&rsquo;t show insertion</p>
<p>in certain magazines but some</p>
<p>magazines they can yeah</p>
<p>but back then it was all</p>
<p>magazines back then there was no</p>
<p>magazines that showed hard ons</p>
<p>and i think i mean none that you could find</p>
<p>and it was like you&rsquo;d ask the guy at the</p>
<p>counter if you were bold</p>
<p>you know at</p>
<p>the bookstore but you really want to</p>
<p>ask him like hey how come nobody&rsquo;s dick&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>bring it up to him</p>
<p>but there was always like</p>
<p>these weird</p>
<p>poses where</p>
<p>they were being like not just one but like 20 different</p>
<p>poses and in each one of them</p>
<p>the girls like</p>
<p>moaning like she&rsquo;s an xc</p>
<p>and the dude</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a heart on</p>
<p>right again</p>
<p>every one of them it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what is the message that they&rsquo;re trying to send you</p>
<p>you know what is</p>
<p>the message that they&rsquo;re trying to send you is it that</p>
<p>this is just how the universe works and that women</p>
<p>that are way hotter than you</p>
<p>could ever possibly</p>
<p>imagine will always wind up with gay guys</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>alone by yourself</p>
<p>jerking off onto</p>
<p>pictures of them</p>
<p>is that what it is what is</p>
<p>the message</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t they have hard ons they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>naked and they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>reality of it all comes into play because you see all</p>
<p>these 20 different scenes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like this</p>
<p>bitch is not giving up in</p>
<p>every scene</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s super enthusiastic</p>
<p>she seems non judgmental this guy can&rsquo;t get it up</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>everything for him she&rsquo;s posing</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got her ass up in the air</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s lying on her back with a leg</p>
<p>spread sucking on her fingers she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>letting him pick her up and he&rsquo;s holding her by the</p>
<p>ants and his dick&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still limp it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still limp and this</p>
<p>bitch is just there for him</p>
<p>the whole way</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like soup some way</p>
<p>eventually he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get a hard on i know it</p>
<p>i just keep posing for him</p>
<p>until she&rsquo;s in all</p>
<p>these weird poses and</p>
<p>never loses interest</p>
<p>never has the you</p>
<p>know should be like at</p>
<p>least the 18th or 19th pose</p>
<p>she should be like what the fuck like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on like</p>
<p>why do you have my legs spread</p>
<p>spread and you</p>
<p>know you&rsquo;re laying your limp dick on my pelvis</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>like a drowning</p>
<p>victim just pulled ashore</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like slop</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s got his limp dick and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>laying it on her pelvis</p>
<p>like who&rsquo;s that for</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t want hard dicks like</p>
<p>who is this</p>
<p>this is where</p>
<p>this is where we draw the line</p>
<p>you want to get all naked and</p>
<p>crazy and pretend you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>so if you had to look</p>
<p>at a dick it was either hard or lamp you would pick</p>
<p>hard all the time</p>
<p>if i had to look at a dick</p>
<p>it depends if i&rsquo;m beating off</p>
<p>the last thing you want to do is be</p>
<p>beating off to a dude with a limp</p>
<p>dick so you</p>
<p>would rather have hard</p>
<p>dicks yeah because you can&rsquo;t even imagine that that</p>
<p>would feel good</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d feel like that the guy</p>
<p>would be embarrassed and that it feels</p>
<p>pointless and</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t feel good because he&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>excited and so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>weird shit going on there</p>
<p>at least if the guy has an erection</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s feeling good it feels good and at</p>
<p>least she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happy that she</p>
<p>can give him an erection it&rsquo;s a much more positive</p>
<p>experience is it hotter for you if the dick is</p>
<p>black or white</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t really relate to</p>
<p>black dicks see i always like but</p>
<p>i can relate to a</p>
<p>black dick if it&rsquo;s big</p>
<p>but then a little tiny</p>
<p>micro white dick</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;d rather have</p>
<p>hard black dick fucking a girl</p>
<p>because for some reason to me that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth naughtier</p>
<p>or something like that&rsquo;s all you</p>
<p>take that big</p>
<p>black dick you</p>
<p>know really yeah really so you find yourself</p>
<p>saying that as you&rsquo;re doing the stroking motion</p>
<p>why whisper it</p>
<p>take it back</p>
<p>what for real</p>
<p>it makes it more naughty to you yeah it just seems like</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;re getting fucked for realsies</p>
<p>i remember some girl</p>
<p>for realsies</p>
<p>some girl came to the comedy</p>
<p>store one night and she</p>
<p>gave us the rules of</p>
<p>being a porn star she was i</p>
<p>think she was with ron jeremy</p>
<p>and she was like</p>
<p>you know rule number one is don&rsquo;t fuck</p>
<p>black guys until they pay you</p>
<p>you have to you can&rsquo;t do it right away don&rsquo;t fuck them</p>
<p>until they pay you</p>
<p>rule number two is no anal for a long time you gotta</p>
<p>keep it to yourself</p>
<p>and like you have strategies</p>
<p>on what you hold back when you do porn oh yeah</p>
<p>honey it&rsquo;s a business</p>
<p>oh yeah honey</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a business</p>
<p>wow yeah they</p>
<p>strategize when to give up</p>
<p>for the black dick</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>right away start fucking black eyes</p>
<p>hey hey hey hey settle into that a little</p>
<p>like some girls like</p>
<p>like jenna jameson</p>
<p>never fucked a</p>
<p>black guy well that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>thing important once you go</p>
<p>black you&rsquo;re actually considered different</p>
<p>than if you did</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>weird so why do girls</p>
<p>why do any girls do</p>
<p>black guys just i mean for</p>
<p>their career why do they do that uh</p>
<p>maybe i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just easy yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just they</p>
<p>just want to fuck</p>
<p>black guys i</p>
<p>guess yeah maybe</p>
<p>maybe they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re there for</p>
<p>equal rights i</p>
<p>guess but a lot of the porn</p>
<p>buyers are southern and</p>
<p>stuff like that and once you fucking</p>
<p>black i don&rsquo;t want it</p>
<p>stupid slut</p>
<p>please there&rsquo;s a disproportionate</p>
<p>amount of all interracial porn sold in the deep</p>
<p>south is that</p>
<p>it yeah i just do a whole joke</p>
<p>about that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right yeah it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>story it&rsquo;s a true statistic</p>
<p>yeah a disproportionate amount is so then it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>black guys buying that stuff</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s scared</p>
<p>white guys gonna look at in nigga</p>
<p>fucking that</p>
<p>white woman</p>
<p>oh man i can&rsquo;t believe what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>right now to her oh yeah</p>
<p>stop looking me in the eyes</p>
<p>stop bitch oh</p>
<p>yeah i think that</p>
<p>that whole black white</p>
<p>thing eventually is gonna go away</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>gonna be like one strange shade of gray</p>
<p>you know one mocha</p>
<p>one something mexican we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>gonna be mexican we&rsquo;re all gonna be mexican yeah yeah</p>
<p>this it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>black white</p>
<p>thing can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>last it only lasted back when people couldn&rsquo;t move to</p>
<p>other places</p>
<p>when you were</p>
<p>stuck in china</p>
<p>and everybody else was in</p>
<p>china well you fed</p>
<p>off the same gene pool and you produced chinese people</p>
<p>but once the africans got to</p>
<p>the northern africa</p>
<p>and egypt and</p>
<p>things started getting</p>
<p>weird and they took over cairo</p>
<p>and then they move into</p>
<p>other places and then the moors</p>
<p>hit sicily and then all these</p>
<p>fucking the spaniards</p>
<p>come over on boats and fuck the american indians and</p>
<p>eventually eventually we&rsquo;re gonna be a</p>
<p>world culture</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t see how you can keep people</p>
<p>from interbreeding for the next</p>
<p>millennia i just don&rsquo;t see it happen i</p>
<p>think in the next thousand years</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all gonna be one</p>
<p>shade you know</p>
<p>you think that&rsquo;s what happened when neanderthals</p>
<p>neanderthals got</p>
<p>assimilated into the</p>
<p>population they used to</p>
<p>think they went extinct</p>
<p>but now they think</p>
<p>they sort of went extinct because</p>
<p>women wouldn&rsquo;t fuck them</p>
<p>but men would fuck the women</p>
<p>men human men</p>
<p>would fuck neanderthal</p>
<p>women and make</p>
<p>babies with them</p>
<p>but neanderthal</p>
<p>men were like what the fuck nothing nothing</p>
<p>they just got on the outs</p>
<p>hmm that would be</p>
<p>weird what would that one</p>
<p>final species</p>
<p>look like well</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s the end of the</p>
<p>world once you make jesus</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna look like aliens</p>
<p>yeah you know i mean you look at the gray</p>
<p>alien the model</p>
<p>alien this big</p>
<p>big head and</p>
<p>you know sexless body and you</p>
<p>know and no muscle tone and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>the next stage i mean if you look at</p>
<p>monkeys and then you look at us and</p>
<p>what is the difference well</p>
<p>our heads aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the monkeys have</p>
<p>smaller heads our heads are bigger</p>
<p>our muscles aren&rsquo;t as big we&rsquo;re softer</p>
<p>we last longer we have</p>
<p>nutrition and information and all that stuff but</p>
<p>physically we&rsquo;re far weaker than the chimps</p>
<p>know and then well then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be more weak than us with bigger heads</p>
<p>their heads are</p>
<p>gonna be bigger they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be more uh</p>
<p>more smooth and less muscular and sinewy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna need that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna be in combat</p>
<p>you never gonna be</p>
<p>fighting for</p>
<p>their life against</p>
<p>other bodies and</p>
<p>trying to take down animals to eat them they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>moved way way way way past that shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s i mean</p>
<p>the human alien connection</p>
<p>for a lot of people they believe that what</p>
<p>their alien</p>
<p>image represents whether it&rsquo;s real or imagined</p>
<p>what it represents is</p>
<p>humans from the future</p>
<p>and that the</p>
<p>eventual metamorphosis of the</p>
<p>human animal</p>
<p>the morphing the</p>
<p>evolving will</p>
<p>ultimately lead to something like that</p>
<p>we look at inherently all our issues well</p>
<p>first of all we have</p>
<p>sexual issues</p>
<p>we have emotional issues we have</p>
<p>anger issues we have all</p>
<p>these things well</p>
<p>all the depictions of the</p>
<p>aliens they&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>completely past all that shit</p>
<p>you eliminate all your</p>
<p>sexual issues</p>
<p>if you can reproduce outside of</p>
<p>a male female environment if you&rsquo;re able to reproduce</p>
<p>completely in</p>
<p>laboratories or in</p>
<p>petri dishes or</p>
<p>whatever the fuck they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>you know if the</p>
<p>human animal moves past reproduction</p>
<p>in a natural way</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>might be what if they</p>
<p>found out that</p>
<p>babies were 100</p>
<p>smarter and they lived</p>
<p>twice as long and they were</p>
<p>five times more</p>
<p>resistant to diseases</p>
<p>if you raise them in</p>
<p>a test tube</p>
<p>everybody raised them outside</p>
<p>of the womb and some new machine that someone created</p>
<p>well every woman</p>
<p>would want that why</p>
<p>would you want your kid to be</p>
<p>stupid because you want to</p>
<p>carry it around inside you</p>
<p>you selfish cunt</p>
<p>put the baby in the machine</p>
<p>right you know so that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>would do and that&rsquo;s inevitable they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna eventually come up with something like that the</p>
<p>human body can only do so much you know the human body</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>figuring out artificial</p>
<p>parts they already devise artificial</p>
<p>hearts they&rsquo;ve come up with artificial</p>
<p>leaves that make</p>
<p>photosynthesis</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have artificial</p>
<p>wounds artificial electricity you know</p>
<p>those artificial trees</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re gonna be able to make electricity</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re gonna be able to make electricity the</p>
<p>solar power</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing that i got from transcendent man that</p>
<p>the ray kurzweil documentary that i watched</p>
<p>fucking awesome shit man</p>
<p>but he talks about the</p>
<p>upcoming advances in</p>
<p>solar powers</p>
<p>solar powers</p>
<p>gonna be the shipments gonna be</p>
<p>driving cars man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>solar powered cars of the next twenty</p>
<p>thirty years it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>all eventually is moving us towards the aliens man</p>
<p>i mean they really might be</p>
<p>the ideas of</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe they</p>
<p>exist or that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist i don&rsquo;t believe that you know people are</p>
<p>really seeing flying</p>
<p>saucers and i don&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>everything that people see</p>
<p>is a government</p>
<p>spacecraft it was very possible that</p>
<p>could be something</p>
<p>from another dimension or something from another</p>
<p>world or something from some</p>
<p>some even even hoki</p>
<p>ridiculous cliche description from like a 1950 sci fi</p>
<p>movie i&rsquo;m not discounting the possibility that</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve looked at all</p>
<p>these different people that all</p>
<p>their stories and all their</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t jive</p>
<p>man it doesn&rsquo;t jive</p>
<p>to me i have</p>
<p>an awesome bullshit detector</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m currently reading this john mac book john mac was</p>
<p>actually a professor at harvard who</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>post past life</p>
<p>hypnotic regression shit with people</p>
<p>you know hypnotic regression not not past life but in</p>
<p>their past like</p>
<p>abduction stuff</p>
<p>because he was dealing with all</p>
<p>these different people that had</p>
<p>very very similar</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>where they were abducted</p>
<p>repeatedly over many times in</p>
<p>their life but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking at the work and i&rsquo;m reading his</p>
<p>stuff and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like god this is so embarrassing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>squirrely work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this guy has</p>
<p>gone he&rsquo;s made a</p>
<p>conclusion in his mind already</p>
<p>and what he&rsquo;s doing in his work is not like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not exploring all the</p>
<p>possibilities he&rsquo;s kind of like pushing towards this</p>
<p>conclusion and</p>
<p>the latest one that i&rsquo;m reading is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so sloppy</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s telling all</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>about all these people and all</p>
<p>their depictions of</p>
<p>their experiences</p>
<p>how about you tell me how</p>
<p>crazy that person is on a one to ten</p>
<p>tell me ask me what</p>
<p>do they think</p>
<p>about astrology</p>
<p>what do they</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>tarot cards</p>
<p>what do they</p>
<p>think about crystals or mind reading what do they</p>
<p>think about the loch</p>
<p>ness monster</p>
<p>i want to know a lot of</p>
<p>other shit about</p>
<p>these people i don&rsquo;t want to know</p>
<p>about what their</p>
<p>experience was like</p>
<p>first when i was eight</p>
<p>you know i was</p>
<p>alone in a cab and i knew something was there</p>
<p>with me i saw the dark eyes in the corner of the room</p>
<p>really were you on lithium</p>
<p>were you crazy are you</p>
<p>crazy at all is anyone else in your family crazy</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>crazy motherfuckers out there</p>
<p>and they tell some</p>
<p>crazy stories</p>
<p>and all you need to know</p>
<p>about this whole</p>
<p>ufo abduction</p>
<p>experience the one</p>
<p>most important</p>
<p>point is that it all happens at night</p>
<p>well when the fuck are you dreaming</p>
<p>when the fuck do you have the most</p>
<p>realistic bizarre</p>
<p>dreams the other</p>
<p>night i had some</p>
<p>crazy fucking</p>
<p>dream i was on a dragon</p>
<p>i was reading from these</p>
<p>that the words</p>
<p>would light up on fire as you read them so you</p>
<p>could only read it once</p>
<p>i mean this is bizarre</p>
<p>yeah it was a cool ass</p>
<p>dream but it was a fucking</p>
<p>dream all right</p>
<p>it was really obvious to me when i woke up like wow</p>
<p>what a crazy ass dream</p>
<p>well what is a dream</p>
<p>well what a</p>
<p>dream is is your mind reaches a certain</p>
<p>state in rem sleep</p>
<p>where rapid eye</p>
<p>movement takes place and</p>
<p>all sorts of</p>
<p>crazy chemicals</p>
<p>psychedelic chemicals</p>
<p>start being produced by your body</p>
<p>and they all pass the</p>
<p>blood brain</p>
<p>barrier and you have all</p>
<p>these nutty fucking</p>
<p>experiences and</p>
<p>you and your cousin mikey</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>sleds and you&rsquo;re running from godzilla</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>is that real sleds</p>
<p>should we investigate whether there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sleds in space</p>
<p>whether godzilla is real no</p>
<p>no you should say</p>
<p>when did this happen</p>
<p>oh i was sleeping</p>
<p>oh you were dreaming</p>
<p>right yeah probably</p>
<p>when were you abducted by aliens</p>
<p>while i was in bed</p>
<p>do you think you were dreaming</p>
<p>no it was so real oh okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s write a book on how real it was</p>
<p>and you gotta say</p>
<p>no it was so real</p>
<p>well a lot of them</p>
<p>the interviews that they do with them are so telling</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really fascinating</p>
<p>and not necessarily that the people are</p>
<p>stupid and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even necessarily that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re lying</p>
<p>cause a lot of them i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think are lying</p>
<p>i think what a lot of them are is</p>
<p>first of all people live some</p>
<p>boring ass fucking shitty lives</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re boring as fuck</p>
<p>and if something happens and all of a</p>
<p>sudden that something gives your life meaning</p>
<p>like oh my god</p>
<p>instead of it being some</p>
<p>sleep paralysis</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>your brain has this endogenous dump of</p>
<p>psychedelic chemicals that are natural</p>
<p>in the brain anyway</p>
<p>instead of that being the case</p>
<p>like no no no i have been</p>
<p>visited and i have information</p>
<p>that i have to give to the people of the world</p>
<p>well you know if you have a natural</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience or if you have</p>
<p>a real psychedelic</p>
<p>experience where you take a drug and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re planning it out</p>
<p>either one is</p>
<p>going to give you a very similar</p>
<p>experience and that</p>
<p>experience is</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is totally</p>
<p>wrong everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucked up you need to get your shit together</p>
<p>how about an</p>
<p>analysis of yourself an analysis of life on the planet</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s look at this</p>
<p>other than the way we&rsquo;re looking at it</p>
<p>right now because this obviously isn&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>this is the theme</p>
<p>to every mushroom trip the theme to</p>
<p>every acid trip the theme to every</p>
<p>time you eat a pot</p>
<p>brownie you want to reconstruct the</p>
<p>whole thing and put it back together again</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s rational and that makes sense</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>this experience</p>
<p>these people are having whether the</p>
<p>aliens are telling them well</p>
<p>we need to get your shit together yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re high dude</p>

<p>spacecraft it&rsquo;s dope</p>
<p>like you look at them like that is a fucking</p>
<p>stealth bomber</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see that</p>

<p>seven days from today yeah</p>
<p>yeah adam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be on you know what man</p>
<p>my dream has already been</p>
<p>not just reached but surpassed</p>
<p>when we first</p>
<p>started doing this when you and i</p>
<p>first started doing this in episode</p>
<p>one we were just fucking around man we were just</p>
<p>sitting in front of the computer and</p>
<p>we just thought it</p>
<p>would be fun to have</p>
<p>some little kind of</p>
<p>silly show that we</p>
<p>would do for people that were on the message board</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mostly what it was and people on twitter</p>
<p>you know but now it&rsquo;s become like a</p>
<p>radio show now it&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>this way to</p>
<p>tell people</p>
<p>about shows</p>
<p>that it never had before you know what used to be</p>
<p>you would go on a</p>
<p>radio show and</p>
<p>you would hope that some</p>
<p>of the people listening were your fans or hope that you</p>
<p>could say something</p>
<p>funny enough to convince them</p>
<p>you know on the radio</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the morning you&rsquo;re fucking half</p>
<p>awake random</p>
<p>people listening</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s random people listening and who knows if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna jive with the</p>
<p>djs like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>radio station in houston that</p>
<p>apparently is</p>
<p>still mad at me</p>
<p>for being on their</p>
<p>radio show back in</p>
<p>i guess it was like fear factor days like 2002 or 2003</p>
<p>and they apparently</p>
<p>still talk shit about me</p>
<p>about what they had</p>
<p>me on and i remember they wanted me and i was probably</p>
<p>tired and if i came off rude i didn&rsquo;t mean to</p>
<p>but they wanted me to eat some stuff</p>
<p>first of all they wanted me</p>
<p>to eat some big hamburger they had and i&rsquo;m like no no</p>
<p>thank you i</p>
<p>watch when i eat</p>
<p>and also in the morning i have hypothyroidism so i take</p>
<p>a thyroid medication</p>
<p>and when i take</p>
<p>it i can&rsquo;t eat anything for like an hour</p>
<p>so i was on this</p>
<p>radio show and they&rsquo;re trying to get me to eat this</p>
<p>stupid thing that they made in an easy bake</p>
<p>oven i was there i actually filmed that did you yeah</p>
<p>those people are</p>
<p>mad at me are you</p>
<p>still mad they</p>
<p>still talk shit</p>
<p>about me like i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>worst person they&rsquo;ve ever had on their show</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know that i didn&rsquo;t even know they had an issue</p>
<p>until i left and</p>
<p>apparently they were talking</p>
<p>about me when i wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>when i was there they were nice as pie to me</p>
<p>but then when i left</p>
<p>they started talking like what</p>
<p>i was so rude</p>
<p>they had a gag</p>
<p>and i wasn&rsquo;t into</p>
<p>their gag and i didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>with it it was</p>
<p>stupid shit it is</p>
<p>stupid and you know what they&rsquo;re not comedians man and</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re not on my vibe</p>
<p>not on my frequency</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on their own frequency</p>
<p>and they thought</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be fun they thought it&rsquo;d be cool if i played</p>
<p>along but i didn&rsquo;t want to eat their</p>
<p>thing and they didn&rsquo;t adjust</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>adjust so then i&rsquo;m like why the fuck am i doing this</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>look when you do</p>
<p>radio stations there&rsquo;s a lot of different kind of</p>
<p>radio djs some of them are really cool and easy to do</p>
<p>and easy to do</p>
<p>their shows</p>
<p>and other ones they want</p>
<p>more attention</p>
<p>than you and they&rsquo;re a little squirrely and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like the fact that you&rsquo;re on tv and they&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>radio and they get to be cunty</p>
<p>you know they get to be</p>
<p>weird and they&rsquo;re looking for something to be</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re coming from some fucking</p>
<p>television show and you won&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>their stupid easy bake oven thing</p>
<p>you become an asshole instead of</p>
<p>if that was me</p>
<p>and i had a</p>
<p>guest on like come on eat the easy bake</p>
<p>oven and you won&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be like what kind of an idiot am i</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>this guy to eat something this is all i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>planned for this fucking thing</p>
<p>i could be asking him</p>
<p>a million interesting questions like we&rsquo;d be talking</p>
<p>about all kinds of</p>
<p>crazy stuff</p>
<p>but instead</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pissed that he won&rsquo;t eat my</p>
<p>fucking tuna casserole out of a fucking easy bake oven</p>
<p>so these people</p>
<p>apparently are</p>
<p>still upset at me</p>
<p>well used to used to</p>
<p>have to deal with</p>
<p>those kind of people in the past now i don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean anything anymore</p>
<p>every show that i do now i do nothing for no press</p>
<p>i mean i did preston and</p>
<p>steve i called up</p>
<p>for philly but it was</p>
<p>after the shows were already sold out but</p>
<p>i did it because i like them because they&rsquo;re cool guys</p>
<p>but when we do</p>
<p>these shows now</p>
<p>we have our own</p>
<p>radio station we have</p>
<p>our own ability</p>
<p>to promote the</p>
<p>shows and probably more listeners than ever than</p>
<p>compared to that</p>
<p>radio station that hates you yeah</p>
<p>well that and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>100 your fans</p>
<p>i hate that word</p>
<p>all hundred percent people who</p>
<p>appreciate your work</p>
<p>right so they already are</p>
<p>enjoying what you do they are</p>
<p>enjoy your podcast</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re already there for you they like you</p>
<p>you know and so they want to come to the shows</p>
<p>and as opposed to you know doing a</p>
<p>radio show and</p>
<p>trying to get people out there to listen and like you</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why people like</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>these mediocre</p>
<p>folks in houston</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they</p>
<p>you know they have like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they have</p>
<p>power their only</p>
<p>power was that they&rsquo;re the ones who get to talk on this</p>
<p>radio show meanwhile</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not even they have no</p>
<p>talent there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>going on there they&rsquo;re just talking people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just dum dums</p>
<p>and then they play music</p>
<p>they sort of</p>
<p>hijack your attention span for a few minutes</p>
<p>while you wait for the next cool song to</p>
<p>start playing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just sitting</p>
<p>there reading your wikipedia page most of the time</p>
<p>so joe rogan</p>
<p>i heard that you that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>be a problem for me</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know i just i don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still upset at me because</p>
<p>apparently this is some recent interview</p>
<p>oh really i didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>about i don&rsquo;t even know who they are i don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>where station is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t care it was justin it&rsquo;s there look</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these years and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still upset that i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t eat your</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s on you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on you</p>
<p>100 i didn&rsquo;t do anything to you</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t break your window didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>light your bathroom</p>
<p>on fire you know if i just didn&rsquo;t eat your thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the whole</p>
<p>world is filled with different</p>
<p>kinds of people man and if you try to make everybody</p>
<p>happy you will fucking go crazy</p>
<p>i know when i&rsquo;ve been a douchebag in my past</p>
<p>i know when i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>things where i could have</p>
<p>made this go smoother</p>
<p>i could have just</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t one of</p>
<p>those things this is just stupidity</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t want to deal with stupidity</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>texas soon aren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>like august or something i</p>
<p>want to go back</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m going to houston</p>
<p>i think august august</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait that&rsquo;d be fun</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m doing that september</p>
<p>again in austin too</p>
<p>oh really yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always good time</p>
<p>yeah and plus now</p>
<p>it looks like i&rsquo;m recording the special in june</p>
<p>so if that happens</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>i have to have all new shit</p>
<p>by the time</p>
<p>september rolls around so i got a lot of work to do</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been writing a lot lately man</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m trying to finish this book</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been writing like crazy man</p>
<p>writing is so fucking satisfying it</p>
<p>might be one of my favorite</p>
<p>things to do</p>
<p>i love the idea that you just sit in</p>
<p>front of that computer and</p>
<p>these ideas just</p>
<p>start dancing in your head they</p>
<p>start dancing you</p>
<p>know they start</p>
<p>arranging themselves on paper</p>
<p>and then sometimes</p>
<p>like when an idea</p>
<p>will come out and then another idea will follow it and</p>
<p>you step back</p>
<p>i step back and look and i&rsquo;m like wow this</p>
<p>crazy thing that just like happened through me</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>crazy idea that you know just happened through me</p>
<p>and then it all like</p>
<p>puts itself onto</p>
<p>paper and then the next</p>
<p>thing you know there&rsquo;s 100 pages next</p>
<p>thing you know there&rsquo;s 200 pages it&rsquo;s like wow it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such a fascinating process man the</p>
<p>creative process of actually sitting down and writing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing man</p>
<p>i tried last</p>
<p>night i was</p>
<p>gonna write just for a little like an hour</p>
<p>and then get in the tank</p>
<p>but sometimes</p>
<p>every now and then you tap into a vein</p>
<p>and you gotta stay there you can&rsquo;t go anywhere</p>
<p>i just had one idea that i needed to</p>
<p>write down before i went into the tank</p>
<p>and as i was writing that idea down</p>
<p>something about writing like say if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking about a word</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re writing the word experience</p>
<p>it takes longer to</p>
<p>write that word than it is to</p>
<p>think of the concept of</p>
<p>experience so it</p>
<p>allows you to deeply consider</p>
<p>everything that you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and then oftentimes like when you&rsquo;re writing i can</p>
<p>seem so much</p>
<p>smarter writing than i ever</p>
<p>could just talking</p>
<p>think yeah yeah</p>
<p>like i mean you talk very like</p>
<p>smart yeah but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>waste i just</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m way</p>
<p>smarter writing that i am talking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>because you can consider</p>
<p>everything much more</p>
<p>you know you get a chance to look at it</p>
<p>you know you you really</p>
<p>get to know someone like and that&rsquo;s another beautiful</p>
<p>thing about this podcast you get to know someone</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>to them for a long time you get to know like how their</p>
<p>brain works</p>
<p>you know like you</p>
<p>could write</p>
<p>things out like that&rsquo;s what that was used to</p>
<p>drive me crazy</p>
<p>about presidential</p>
<p>speeches and shit like that</p>
<p>that they have people writing them for them</p>
<p>that is so fucked up</p>
<p>this is time right</p>
<p>cause they have to give like a</p>
<p>speech like</p>
<p>every fucking day almost</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you just</p>
<p>speak from the heart</p>
<p>yeah but there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>things they have to just</p>
<p>touch on they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably not like writers like this is what you have</p>
<p>to say it&rsquo;s more like taking your ideas and making a</p>
<p>speech form because i mean they</p>
<p>literally have to do like</p>
<p>probably two or three</p>
<p>speeches a day</p>
<p>if you looked at</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really does he do truth</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>going to colleges or talking</p>
<p>here with representatives you know they&rsquo;re always doing</p>
<p>speeches if you look at his</p>
<p>schedule like there&rsquo;s that one time</p>
<p>where they followed him around</p>
<p>for a week i</p>
<p>forget what program did it and it was just like his</p>
<p>schedule is pretty much from when he wake up</p>
<p>just going from one</p>
<p>place to another giving a speech</p>
<p>giving a speech</p>
<p>giving a speech</p>
<p>fuck either way</p>
<p>write your own</p>
<p>speeches bitch</p>
<p>i think he does actually and one of his</p>
<p>most famous</p>
<p>speeches is one that he wrote</p>
<p>one of them</p>
<p>the ones when he was running for office</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a smart guy and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very good</p>
<p>speech writer but</p>
<p>the whole idea of having</p>
<p>a speech written out for you by a</p>
<p>bunch of other people is</p>
<p>kind of offensive to me</p>
<p>like what the</p>
<p>fuck are you doing being the leader if you&rsquo;ve got all</p>
<p>these people telling you exactly what to say</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re following all</p>
<p>these charts and</p>
<p>graphs and this is what the people want and so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>give them this and this is sort of in the middle and</p>
<p>will lower their</p>
<p>expectations</p>
<p>expectations with that</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll hit them with this to make them happy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s like so obvious that we&rsquo;re being played</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>drives me nuts</p>
<p>about speech writing</p>
<p>about the idea of it so this is like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>trying to pretend that you know they&rsquo;re not playing you</p>
<p>then i even try to pretend this guy</p>
<p>wrote the shit himself</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s just up there reading</p>
<p>off a fucking teleprompter and you&rsquo;re just going yay</p>
<p>and nothing changes</p>
<p>yeah i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>never do that i</p>
<p>could never do</p>
<p>speeches or anything like that</p>
<p>you could if you wanted to give</p>
<p>speeches on podcasting or</p>
<p>speeches on something that you know a lot</p>
<p>about like if you want to give</p>
<p>speeches on</p>
<p>how to be a good</p>
<p>video editor</p>
<p>you could do that you</p>
<p>could easily do like a seminar and</p>
<p>video editing</p>
<p>you know if you ever wanted to like if people</p>
<p>were into your internet</p>
<p>videos and you</p>
<p>could come up with a</p>
<p>bunch of bulletin points of</p>
<p>things that you need to consider like hey brevity you</p>
<p>know this you wanted to make it</p>
<p>under 10 minutes you</p>
<p>want this you want that sure you know this is my best</p>
<p>video and this is why</p>
<p>and the good</p>
<p>thing about this</p>
<p>video is it</p>
<p>starts off in one</p>
<p>point and then it goes back in time then it</p>
<p>brings you forward</p>
<p>again you know</p>

<p>is no more what</p>
<p>cisco bought flip</p>
<p>video and they axed him</p>

<p>video was very</p>
<p>successful and</p>
<p>a big money maker seems like everybody&rsquo;s got flip</p>
<p>videos i see a lot of them my own norton</p>
<p>had it when norton was at</p>
<p>austin he taped all the</p>
<p>sets with that shit yeah they killed it for some reason</p>
<p>is it but is it so good is it a big deal</p>
<p>well i mean it&rsquo;s just kind of</p>
<p>weird that they did that you know</p>
<p>you would have</p>
<p>never found out</p>
<p>about that 20 years ago</p>
<p>yeah it just would</p>
<p>have stopped</p>
<p>unless you were reading the</p>
<p>technology page of the new york times you know</p>
<p>how the fuck</p>
<p>would you have ever known</p>
<p>you know now you get like an email</p>
<p>alert from cnn to tell you that</p>
<p>flip video has been</p>
<p>eaten up by cisco</p>
<p>yeah you know yeah</p>
<p>weird you know</p>
<p>scott adams is the guy who created dilbert uh huh</p>
<p>he got busted</p>
<p>going online</p>
<p>defending himself</p>
<p>under a fake name are you serious yeah</p>
<p>is that like the weakest shit ever how&rsquo;d he get busted</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know he got busted</p>
<p>and then he um he</p>
<p>wrote something</p>
<p>about it admitting it and</p>
<p>this is what he wrote</p>
<p>according to</p>
<p>wise and fair denizens of the internet this</p>
<p>after he&rsquo;s been busted</p>
<p>according to the wise and fair</p>
<p>denizens of the internet</p>
<p>this behavior is</p>
<p>proof that i am a thin skin troll</p>
<p>asshole dick fame whore</p>
<p>egomaniac douche nozzle</p>
<p>misogynist that list</p>
<p>might sound bad to you</p>
<p>but keep in mind that i was</p>
<p>starting from a pretty low base</p>
<p>so i think my</p>
<p>reputation is</p>
<p>trending up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>funny wow yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the oc weekly</p>
<p>if you guys want to read it it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re like wow this so he what he did was</p>
<p>he logged online</p>
<p>and he did under the name planned</p>
<p>chaos and he pretended to be the only person in the</p>
<p>world who doesn&rsquo;t hate him</p>
<p>cause i guess he&rsquo;s been getting in trouble lately</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember what it was</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember what exactly he said</p>
<p>he said some things that people thought were</p>
<p>questionable</p>
<p>and so people were shitting all over him i met him</p>
<p>he was on an episode of news radio</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>that goes to show you</p>
<p>how old dilbert is dilbert&rsquo;s been around forever man</p>
<p>i never got into dilbert really it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>those cartoons are like the lowest</p>
<p>expectation ever for humor and for entertainment value</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing that they can make so much money</p>
<p>like i used to read dunesbury and i remember dunesbury</p>
<p>was the smart one man</p>
<p>it was really</p>
<p>smart the only time to me was even remotely interesting</p>
<p>was when they had</p>
<p>raoul raoul</p>
<p>duke who was the hunter s thompson character</p>
<p>who would come in with guns and</p>
<p>start shooting shit up and</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>hunter s thompsons</p>
<p>they kind of like he has his character raoul duke from</p>
<p>fear and loathing in las vegas</p>
<p>you know he like</p>
<p>the novel is sort of</p>
<p>based on very loosely on him and</p>
<p>his friend oscar and the</p>
<p>crazy shit they did when they were on drugs in vegas</p>
<p>right and this guy</p>
<p>from dunesbury</p>
<p>just sort of co opted that character sort of stole it</p>
<p>stole his intellectual property</p>
<p>and started</p>
<p>using it as characters inside of his dunesbury comic</p>
<p>i thought that was kind of cool like</p>
<p>those kind of</p>
<p>funny that he did that it was kind of</p>
<p>those were fun</p>
<p>but other than</p>
<p>that like most of it was like really like nothing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the jokes were like whoo</p>
<p>like you ever read like marma</p>
<p>duke or something like that or</p>
<p>beetle bailey</p>
<p>how is this shit</p>
<p>still even possible you know bailey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still around yeah i think so</p>
<p>i think i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i am funny yeah who</p>
<p>would cry if the cartoon section i remember when i was</p>
<p>a kid though i used to like the cartoon section i used</p>
<p>to like far side</p>
<p>that was fucking</p>
<p>brilliant shit</p>
<p>and then they just</p>
<p>kind of went away</p>
<p>i was like garfield guy growing up obviously so</p>
<p>garfield and far side were my two</p>
<p>calvin hobbs pretty</p>
<p>so you do like our dudes i do</p>
<p>but then you get</p>
<p>those ones like whatever that fucking kathy</p>
<p>or sticky oh yeah fucking there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense and you have to wonder how</p>
<p>those people keep their jobs</p>
<p>is it like some sort of a government job</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t get fired</p>
<p>that prince valiant</p>
<p>or whatever that one that was like</p>

<p>seventy percent of all pornography gets</p>
<p>watched during nine to five hours</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>twelve percent of</p>
<p>a porno film is</p>
<p>watched at a</p>
<p>hotel room on average</p>
<p>only twelve that makes sense</p>
<p>but seventy percent being</p>
<p>during the internet or</p>
<p>downloaded from the internet</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re at work nine to</p>
<p>five totally</p>
<p>how many people are</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>podcast or listening to this podcast at work a lot</p>
<p>how many people are masturbating</p>
<p>while listening to the</p>
<p>podcast two people</p>
<p>right now and only one&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>one of them is crying</p>
<p>struggling trying to make shit happen</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much porn</p>
<p>i think at this</p>
<p>point it&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s too easy</p>
<p>to beat off</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s all out there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like unavoidable</p>
<p>like it used to be hard as hell</p>
<p>to get some pornography</p>
<p>when i was a kid like we were talking about</p>
<p>earlier about</p>
<p>magazines man</p>
<p>that was what you got</p>
<p>magazines man</p>
<p>you had to go to a liquor</p>
<p>store and ask for the back shelf and</p>
<p>nowadays man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fucking easy to get pornography</p>
<p>nowadays you</p>
<p>could just you</p>
<p>specialize on one</p>
<p>particular type of pornography</p>
<p>you could be like</p>
<p>a weirdo foot guy you only want foot jobs girls</p>
<p>jacking guys off of</p>
<p>their feet and you</p>
<p>could fucking</p>
<p>stack monitors to the top of your room</p>
<p>like a movie</p>
<p>screen 50 feet high</p>
<p>and every one of them has got a different</p>
<p>video of a girl jerking a guy off with her feet</p>
<p>and you would die of old</p>
<p>age before you</p>
<p>watched all of them</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>shit that i was reading</p>
<p>about where guys who</p>
<p>go to graveyards after</p>
<p>they bury somebody recently</p>
<p>like the next day after they</p>
<p>bury somebody and they dig them up and fuck them oh</p>
<p>god like they</p>
<p>check the obituaries and find</p>
<p>a young team</p>
<p>you know oh</p>
<p>where was this happening</p>
<p>it was on the internet i read it</p>
<p>i heard some</p>
<p>people doing it in</p>
<p>there was an old kinesin bit</p>
<p>people doing it in</p>
<p>a mortician&rsquo;s office the mortuary</p>
<p>that you know remember that bit i</p>
<p>could see that happening dude that bit</p>
<p>is what got me into kinesin</p>
<p>really i&rsquo;ve told this</p>
<p>story before but in the interests of brevity</p>
<p>a girl that i was working with</p>
<p>did the bit for me</p>
<p>cause she was telling me how</p>
<p>funny he was</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s lying on her stomach in the parking lot</p>
<p>going oh oh</p>
<p>you mean life keeps fucking you in the ass even</p>
<p>after your dad</p>
<p>it never ends</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>thinking like wow what</p>
<p>is this guy like this guy must be the funniest guy ever</p>
<p>and then i got a hold of his hbo</p>
<p>special i got a chance to see it that&rsquo;s what that</p>
<p>it was probably the one moment when i was 19 years</p>
<p>old with that girl on her stomach in the parking lot</p>
<p>telling me that joe</p>
<p>that was one of the one moments</p>
<p>one of the few moments in my life where a</p>
<p>spark went off in my head like wow</p>
<p>maybe i should do that</p>
<p>maybe i should be a fucking comedian</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>i was nineteen i had no idea what the hell was</p>
<p>gonna happen in my future i didn&rsquo;t know what i was</p>
<p>gonna do but i was already</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>think like maybe you know</p>
<p>maybe i have to find something you know</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not martial</p>
<p>arts i have to find like something else to do like</p>
<p>maybe it was this</p>
<p>fucking guys on his stomach you</p>
<p>pretend to get fucked in the</p>
<p>ass like well there was nothing like that back then man</p>
<p>but i think his joke was</p>
<p>based on a true</p>
<p>story that was in la</p>
<p>some people got arrested</p>
<p>for paying the morticians to</p>
<p>spend a few</p>
<p>hours undisturbed with the</p>
<p>freshest male corpses</p>
<p>oh god oh god yeah</p>
<p>i think if i was a mortician</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>if you get a hot chick</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;d be sometimes you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting in this basement by yourself you&rsquo;d like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>definitely gonna</p>
<p>touch this video</p>
<p>is online this</p>
<p>photos online</p>
<p>have guys fucking dead</p>
<p>bodies this is</p>
<p>fuck it there&rsquo;s a voting</p>
<p>photo online of a guy with this</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s still up</p>
<p>years ago this was in the late 90s</p>
<p>early 2000s</p>
<p>and it was a</p>
<p>whole sequence of</p>
<p>photos from</p>
<p>start to finish of this woman</p>
<p>being on the slab she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clearly dead you know</p>
<p>and then you know him</p>
<p>putting his</p>
<p>penis inside of her</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like whoa dude</p>
<p>you you know he didn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>take these photos of someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter and someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sister someone&rsquo;s wife he fucked her and took</p>
<p>pictures of it</p>
<p>and then put it online you know</p>
<p>some fucking crazy shit</p>
<p>i wonder how many people who get into</p>
<p>like what the number is</p>
<p>how many people get into being a mortician or being a</p>
<p>how many of them are there for the sex</p>
<p>yeah how many</p>
<p>fucking around with</p>
<p>bodies i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very high man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m never surprised at the</p>
<p>things i hear</p>
<p>and i think if you were into fucking dead</p>
<p>bodies that</p>
<p>would be the number one</p>
<p>thing to do i bet hope</p>
<p>good as the meat in the dead body is it</p>
<p>is it i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s juicier</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s juicier</p>
<p>i mean you know what i&rsquo;m saying i mean</p>
<p>is it other</p>
<p>persons but</p>
<p>is rigo mortis</p>
<p>set in do they can they fix that</p>
<p>today is there a way that they can have rigor mortis</p>
<p>not sit in like what happens when they embalm them</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t they pump out all the what is rigor mortis</p>
<p>what does that come from that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it comes from i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s when you died the body just</p>
<p>stiffens up but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>squirrel off the road yeah</p>
<p>i think i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s immediate i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s immediate i think</p>
<p>it takes a few</p>
<p>hours yeah so</p>
<p>maybe if you get the person</p>
<p>right after they die they&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>still pliable</p>
<p>yeah but don&rsquo;t you like when you die</p>
<p>also you just</p>
<p>automatically piss and shit yourself and all that crap</p>
<p>just clean em up man if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fuck a dead body you can&rsquo;t have high standards</p>
<p>you kind of have to warm them up</p>
<p>maybe get some lamps or a heated</p>
<p>blanket and let them sit in there for a</p>
<p>while or something like</p>
<p>that put them in a warm tub</p>
<p>not warm enough to cook them</p>
<p>god you know the cool</p>
<p>thing is that you</p>
<p>could just pretty much fucking rip skin if you</p>
<p>would like one</p>
<p>of the fuck that ass really hard you know</p>
<p>you just fucking</p>
<p>just ripping it</p>
<p>never have to</p>
<p>worry about her getting hurt right yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>i guess you</p>
<p>could think</p>
<p>about it that way</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a gagger</p>
<p>going right through the back of her throat</p>
<p>something about disrespecting dead bodies it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>particularly offensive</p>
<p>particularly unsavory you know the idea of</p>
<p>disrespecting someone&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>their vessel while they&rsquo;re gone</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s so like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so inhuman you know there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s very creepy</p>
<p>right yeah one of the creepiest things</p>
<p>that an eating it</p>
<p>eating someone&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>yeah i was listening to um</p>

<p>one badass song it</p>
<p>would be like pink floyd</p>

<p>like how many</p>
<p>times in history of people had to eat people to stay</p>
<p>alive there&rsquo;s only like a few</p>
<p>recorded instances right</p>

<p>crashed in a</p>
<p>plane crash and they made that</p>
<p>movie about them</p>
<p>remember when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>alive spoon yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spooning that guy&rsquo;s ass out oh yeah it is</p>
<p>about that the</p>
<p>frozen ass meat with a</p>
<p>spoon that was a</p>
<p>freaky ass movie man when that airplane</p>
<p>broke apart yeah</p>
<p>yeah tubes made out of</p>
<p>metal aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really meant to fly through the fucking sky</p>
<p>yeah you know what i was</p>
<p>thinking the</p>
<p>other day is what happened to all</p>
<p>those lost people</p>
<p>you notice how like all</p>
<p>those actors from lost</p>
<p>were such so high in</p>
<p>their career</p>
<p>and now do you see any of them they burnt off</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want to have anything</p>
<p>to do with them jack was pissing me off man i know</p>
<p>after a while man he really</p>
<p>annoyed the shit out of me man</p>
<p>he drove me nuts</p>
<p>he was so phoning it in at the end</p>
<p>when they were all</p>
<p>standing around</p>
<p>that tub and someone comes back to life like</p>
<p>this motherfucker is just phoning it in man that is</p>
<p>ridiculous yeah he</p>
<p>drove me nuts</p>
<p>because he wasn&rsquo;t appreciating his fucking</p>
<p>his part he</p>
<p>started off that</p>
<p>series as a winner</p>
<p>jack was the fucking hero</p>
<p>he was the man</p>
<p>he was the doctor he was handsome all the girls</p>
<p>loved him and by the end</p>
<p>he was a junkie and a loser and</p>
<p>what they did was i guarantee you that guy&rsquo;s annoying</p>
<p>i guarantee that actor is</p>
<p>annoying and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>fuck this guy</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start making him a douchebag</p>
<p>and start slowly</p>
<p>making him more and more</p>
<p>annoying yeah</p>
<p>fuck yeah they must have done that cause</p>
<p>if he was so cool everybody else sort of kept their</p>
<p>thing or became more cool as the show went on you know</p>
<p>like the really hot girl with no ass what&rsquo;s her name um</p>
<p>the really pretty</p>
<p>one with the dark hair the fuck is beautiful</p>
<p>face kate i</p>
<p>remember her she sort of became cooler as time went on</p>
<p>got her shit together</p>
<p>you know raised that girl&rsquo;s baby</p>
<p>you know she had</p>
<p>a lot of good positive attributes</p>
<p>john locke became like mysterious and sort of</p>
<p>magical and sort of figured out the world</p>
<p>jack just became a junkie</p>
<p>just became a fucking loser man</p>
<p>he just slowly</p>
<p>started there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a reason for that if you saw the last episode</p>
<p>that last episode</p>
<p>can suck my dick</p>
<p>i ain&rsquo;t fucking with that man</p>
<p>i think this i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe you</p>
<p>watched that much</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some freedom in walking away for it man</p>
<p>yeah but you</p>
<p>watch so much of it</p>
<p>that you might as well</p>
<p>see what happens</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some freedom</p>
<p>just saying no you don&rsquo;t have me anymore you fucks</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t own me bitch</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not your whore</p>
<p>all right i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>tuning in every week to watch your</p>
<p>stupid commercials</p>
<p>just so you can</p>
<p>trick me with your</p>
<p>silly storyline</p>
<p>i i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>watch tv anymore it seems like</p>
<p>but once you</p>
<p>start fucking</p>
<p>throwing in like time</p>
<p>travel and shit like they did</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re in 1970 all</p>
<p>right you don&rsquo;t even know what happened</p>
<p>you fucks you can do anything you want you fucks</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason</p>
<p>why yeah the reason you want to know i can tell you now</p>
<p>would you like to know nope</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to know</p>
<p>i love that you want me to know</p>
<p>and that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to know i love that this freedom in that</p>
<p>all right he was a girl the</p>
<p>whole time he was a girl</p>
<p>oh good good</p>
<p>it seemed like a girl he</p>
<p>was kate seemed like he was on his period for ten years</p>
<p>fucking twat</p>
<p>oh jesus anything else</p>
<p>before we get</p>
<p>going there was some</p>
<p>questions on the rogan board</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m perusing</p>
<p>through and some of them we&rsquo;ve actually already</p>
<p>answered and</p>
<p>some of them</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s like one what</p>
<p>are your thoughts on listeners supporting the podcast</p>
<p>the podcast financially</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessary the podcast as i said is a great</p>
<p>method for me to promote shows and promote all the</p>
<p>other stuff that we do and</p>
<p>we get sponsorships</p>
<p>the more you guys listen the more we get</p>
<p>sponsors i mean</p>
<p>we just have this</p>
<p>flashlight right now but that&rsquo;s mostly because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be moving to sirius very soon</p>
<p>both obviously it will</p>
<p>still be live and free on the internet it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still be on itunes for free it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still be available for download on the website for free</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll also be on sirius</p>
<p>satellite radio just so more people can listen to it</p>
<p>you know i like serious i have it in my car</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an awesome service and i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just another avenue for us</p>
<p>to get heard and you</p>
<p>know we&rsquo;re not even getting paid for it the same</p>
<p>thing is like</p>
<p>stitcher and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m for all</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>and the more of</p>
<p>these things that we do</p>
<p>the more it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never had this many people come to my shows i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never had i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious that this is a good thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious that there&rsquo;s a benefit for me</p>
<p>in that and the</p>
<p>promotional aspect of it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a benefit in people that they get this free</p>
<p>entertainment man</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a benefit for us too</p>
<p>over the course</p>
<p>of the year or so that we&rsquo;ve been doing this</p>
<p>one of the coolest</p>
<p>things that really made me</p>
<p>appreciate i</p>
<p>was bummed out when i had to come back here</p>
<p>from colorado</p>
<p>you know i have this idea of raising my kids in a</p>
<p>place where it&rsquo;s a little more calm there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>less people there&rsquo;s less of the pressures of hollywood</p>
<p>the sort of the bullshit materialism</p>
<p>of this area this part of the country</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a silly part</p>
<p>of the country there&rsquo;s a lot of cool people here but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a very</p>
<p>silly part of the country</p>
<p>so i was bummed out man when the dog got</p>
<p>eaten by the mountain lion and when mrs</p>
<p>rogan got pregnant we had to come back i mean it was</p>
<p>to me it was like fuck i was gone i made it out of this</p>
<p>place i had</p>
<p>escaped and now i&rsquo;m back again</p>
<p>but what really</p>
<p>like made me</p>
<p>appreciate this place</p>
<p>was this podcast</p>
<p>and was having all</p>
<p>these cool people come over all the time</p>
<p>having ari over having</p>
<p>eddie over having joey over having</p>
<p>bert kreischer and russell</p>
<p>peters and tom</p>
<p>green i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you know i sit</p>
<p>back and i go god this is so much fucking fun</p>
<p>you know somehow or another we have like a real legit</p>
<p>national radio show</p>
<p>and not even national man worldwide</p>
<p>because we had a fuckload of podcast fans in australia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>other side of the fucking planet</p>
<p>and when when i</p>
<p>asked them about the podcast they went nuts</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>worldwide sort of a</p>
<p>thing man and you know and i</p>
<p>who the fuck knew</p>
<p>when we did this that it</p>
<p>would be what it is now</p>
<p>who knew that</p>
<p>every week would be in</p>
<p>the top five of itunes</p>
<p>who the fuck we had never</p>
<p>had no idea no idea</p>
<p>it was completely by chance</p>
<p>and slowly along the line it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>morphed and slowly</p>
<p>along the line it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evolved and slowly</p>
<p>along the line it&rsquo;s become something</p>
<p>it is itself now</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>like now we don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about how to do it</p>
<p>we came over here like</p>
<p>brian came over here today</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t even have to talk</p>
<p>about when we talked</p>
<p>about just normal shit like we always do</p>
<p>but this is our hundredth episode man it&rsquo;s a big deal</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re like but we</p>
<p>should do it we were like well we</p>
<p>should do it together yeah it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you and me for the hundredth</p>
<p>and then that was not all the</p>
<p>thing we had to talk</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it is its own</p>
<p>thing you know it is it&rsquo;s got its own life to it now</p>
<p>and all the people that send me</p>
<p>emails man and all the twitter messages and all</p>
<p>the people that i meet in the comedy clubs</p>
<p>i appreciate the fuck out of that i</p>
<p>think it is one of my biggest accomplishments</p>
<p>in my career</p>
<p>is this podcast and that message</p>
<p>board and both of</p>
<p>those things and</p>
<p>the whole internet</p>
<p>group of bringing all</p>
<p>these cool people together</p>
<p>and the positive energy that i get from all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>at shows and the positive reactions that i get</p>
<p>so many people coming up to me and telling me that</p>
<p>this podcast helps them</p>
<p>think differently</p>
<p>it changes the way they look at life</p>
<p>it changes the way they view</p>
<p>their friends</p>
<p>change the way that you view how they interact with</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>you know i couldn&rsquo;t be happier</p>
<p>man i couldn&rsquo;t be happier that we did this and this</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have happened</p>
<p>if i didn&rsquo;t give in and come back from colorado</p>
<p>if i decided to stay in</p>
<p>colorado we</p>
<p>would have never have done this</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>about the idea of getting like a female</p>
<p>sidekick a female</p>
<p>sidekick a whole</p>
<p>a whole mr robin</p>
<p>quinn&rsquo;s not really down with that</p>
<p>mmm yeah oh did you hear that he</p>
<p>slurped his coffee</p>

<p>yeah if you hear</p>
<p>slurping man that&rsquo;s me blame me</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>adam crowell had a really</p>
<p>funny girl in his show</p>
<p>he had teresa strasser for a</p>
<p>while and she was really</p>
<p>funny and now he&rsquo;s got this new</p>
<p>chick and a</p>
<p>a lot of people on the rogen</p>
<p>board didn&rsquo;t like her but i thought she was</p>
<p>funny man she made</p>
<p>me laugh the</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>about that is</p>
<p>he auditioned a few girls like esther</p>
<p>little esther</p>
<p>went there oh that&rsquo;s how this girl got it yeah and i</p>
<p>guess but what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy is like if you go</p>
<p>to his website and look at all the comments per episode</p>
<p>every single one</p>
<p>of the girls that he did</p>
<p>like all hate like</p>
<p>his audience hates</p>
<p>so bad that girl</p>
<p>on any girl that&rsquo;s on his show i</p>
<p>feel so bad</p>
<p>or brody stevens</p>
<p>so the girls and brody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the new girl</p>
<p>you know i think her name&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>jesse or something</p>
<p>like that i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m looking for it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna look it</p>
<p>right now because i feel rude that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about her own yeah</p>
<p>her name up</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be cool to have adam krolow</p>
<p>on yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be on this this next week</p>
<p>next tuesday yeah</p>
<p>yeah in your formula</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been working with on onit com</p>
<p>o and nit it&rsquo;s almost done</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on its way yeah</p>
<p>did you read the case</p>
<p>study that&rsquo;s pretty interesting</p>
<p>yeah a lot of people look i&rsquo;ve been taking 5htp</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve had some pretty</p>
<p>powerful results i feel like it makes</p>
<p>sentences form easier</p>
<p>i feel like there&rsquo;s more circulation in my</p>
<p>brain or something</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what it is but</p>
<p>5htp has given me</p>
<p>a very tangible benefit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some other</p>
<p>stuff that i took that gave me some</p>
<p>good benefits as well but what we did what chris did</p>
<p>with this neutropic formula it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>alpha brain wave</p>
<p>neutropic formula i was</p>
<p>gonna call it</p>
<p>what we did was take all of the best</p>
<p>nootropics which are</p>
<p>nutrients for the</p>
<p>brain and condense them into</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s like two pills</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these people the case studies had some really positive</p>
<p>experiences with it</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m excited it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>legit stuff it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>stuff that people have reported actually helps</p>
<p>brain function</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna combine it into one</p>
<p>thing and i think</p>
<p>nutrition and</p>
<p>mental nutrition and physical</p>
<p>nutrition all of it is one of the most</p>
<p>underlooked</p>
<p>keys to happiness for people</p>
<p>i mean we have a friend that</p>
<p>got on antidepressants and</p>
<p>this motherfucker eats cheetos</p>
<p>every night and</p>
<p>never works out and i was like yo dude you know</p>
<p>if you took</p>
<p>care of that body i guarantee you you&rsquo;d feel</p>
<p>a little bit better i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>an issue that</p>
<p>maybe needs to be corrected</p>
<p>chemically because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not inside your head</p>
<p>but i know for a fact my own</p>
<p>brain if i didn&rsquo;t work out i</p>
<p>would not be nearly as happy</p>
<p>i would have all this</p>
<p>extra pent up shit</p>
<p>you gotta get that out man and you gotta</p>
<p>treat this fucking</p>
<p>vehicle good give this</p>
<p>vehicle vitamins man</p>
<p>i drink fresh</p>
<p>squeezed juices</p>
<p>every morning</p>
<p>every morning when i&rsquo;m at home i squeeze</p>
<p>i get ginger and raw garlic and carrots and celery</p>
<p>and i blend</p>
<p>it all together and you feel so fucking good good</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting all those raw</p>
<p>nutrients in your body and your body</p>
<p>you know to people</p>
<p>that i know i have a lot of friends who are very very</p>
<p>smart but they almost</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>vain and trivial and foolish</p>
<p>about taking care of your body</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>smoke cigarettes or</p>
<p>they eat shitty food</p>
<p>and they never exercise they</p>
<p>never take care</p>
<p>of themselves like man you&rsquo;re missing out on</p>
<p>a big chunk of life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s annoying</p>
<p>to have to go to the gym that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>learn to martial art or it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>pick up a sport or racquetball or something where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forced to move around you</p>
<p>know where it&rsquo;s fun it&rsquo;s part of the whole game</p>
<p>but find some way find some way to take</p>
<p>care of your fucking body find some fucking way man</p>
<p>take some fucking vitamins even if it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>multi vitamins and fish oil even if it&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>that will make a fucking difference</p>
<p>and so many people don&rsquo;t man so many</p>
<p>people just ride it out and they just hope it all is</p>
<p>gonna fucking stay together</p>
<p>i switched my 5htp</p>
<p>to chris&rsquo;s brand</p>
<p>which is called roll on</p>
<p>or roll over can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>which one it is</p>
<p>blue bottle</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great too it&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>175 milligrams i</p>
<p>think it was and you feel a difference</p>
<p>after taking</p>
<p>photos i&rsquo;ve been i&rsquo;ve been taking it for</p>
<p>over a month</p>
<p>and that in the resveratro i think are</p>
<p>two of the best</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve take i take i mean i take fish oil in a</p>
<p>multi multi</p>
<p>vitamin every day but i</p>
<p>think those two or the</p>
<p>things that i&rsquo;ve noticed the biggest from</p>
<p>how much do you think</p>
<p>cigarettes fuck with you</p>
<p>oh a lot definitely yeah</p>
<p>yeah does it bother you though that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that that you&rsquo;re poisoning yourself with cigarettes</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve seen you before dude there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>times that i&rsquo;ve seen you when you like smoking a lot</p>
<p>when you take</p>
<p>on like you have a gray quality to your face</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m serious man</p>
<p>and when you quit</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great and what that is is i have a</p>
<p>great beard</p>
<p>no and if i don&rsquo;t if i shave</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great for the</p>
<p>first three days</p>
<p>no man i mean</p>
<p>i mean like your eyes</p>
<p>like around your eyes</p>
<p>like you there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about smoking</p>
<p>something about a lot of that cigarette</p>
<p>smoke in your</p>
<p>system where like</p>
<p>your whole system looks like yeah</p>
<p>you know it looks like your whole</p>
<p>system is being poisoned slowly well it is</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you fucking quit</p>
<p>crazy bitch</p>
<p>i will you won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what makes you say you&rsquo;re gonna quit</p>
<p>wait for the first stroke the best part</p>
<p>is that what&rsquo;s gonna do</p>
<p>you gonna go vegan all my grandfather</p>
<p>go completely</p>
<p>your grandfather had a</p>
<p>stroke yeah from smoking really yeah oh look at you</p>
<p>living smart yeah</p>
<p>it was like 65</p>
<p>oh so you feel like you&rsquo;ve got a few years yeah okay</p>
<p>well isn&rsquo;t there like a point of no return like</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve done so much damage that you can</p>
<p>never heal yourself up</p>
<p>no i mean well to a</p>
<p>point if you get cancer obviously but i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a chart i</p>
<p>think like after a year you&rsquo;re pretty much</p>
<p>back to normal</p>
<p>your lung capacity and all that</p>
<p>stuff there&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>thing where like if you quit the first week</p>
<p>the first day the</p>
<p>first month what keeps you from</p>
<p>quitting i mean you taking</p>
<p>those nicotine patches can&rsquo;t you just jam</p>
<p>those yeah i mean it&rsquo;s just doing it i mean</p>
<p>seriously smoking see i wish you could tell</p>
<p>the addiction</p>
<p>i wish i could too because marin&rsquo;s complaining</p>
<p>about it all</p>
<p>the time he&rsquo;s always on his twitter it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>there putting nicotine patches on shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be there like that</p>
<p>voice in the back of your head even if you quit is</p>

<p>death scott who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going there</p>
<p>yeah probably</p>
<p>whoever&rsquo;s around you know if joey and i can do it</p>
<p>you know how we do it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like ari&rsquo;s getting a</p>
<p>bunch of headline gigs now</p>
<p>which is very nice yeah ari&rsquo;s headlining all over the</p>
<p>place he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>doing comedy competitions he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>you know comedy festivals</p>
<p>he just got back from atlanta</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>it goes i realized</p>
<p>something i was like why is this feel so weird</p>
<p>and then someone said because you&rsquo;re the most</p>
<p>famous comic here</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like oh i&rsquo;m not comfortable with that</p>
<p>and i go you&rsquo;re not comfortable with that because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsibility you feel responsible for the</p>
<p>young pucks</p>
<p>is that what</p>
<p>it feels like he&rsquo;s a yeah that is what it is</p>
<p>i go you shy away from</p>
<p>every responsibility possible</p>
<p>even being the most</p>
<p>famous comedian</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look to me i don&rsquo;t know nothing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m get out of here</p>
<p>and he just runs away that dude</p>
<p>should be so much bigger i mean there gotta be</p>
<p>i was talking</p>
<p>to mary carey when we had her on the podcast and</p>
<p>she was talking</p>
<p>about how she saw you and ari and she&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that guy&rsquo;s name ari</p>
<p>shafir he was so fucking hilarious i&rsquo;m like wow</p>
<p>you know his</p>
<p>name off hand well we talked to her for like five</p>
<p>hours on the plane too</p>
<p>but yeah that she did remember his name</p>
<p>yeah i mean look</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tough these days for a</p>
<p>comic to get</p>
<p>notoriety just for</p>
<p>their stand up</p>
<p>you have to get on something</p>
<p>where people see you there&rsquo;s just so much</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>value you know you have to have</p>
<p>a comedy central special you have to have something</p>
<p>and ari is at a bit of</p>
<p>a disadvantage just like joey is in that they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>ruthlessly dirty</p>
<p>you know which is really hilarious but it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>clean that shit up for</p>
<p>you know a seven</p>
<p>minute spot at live at gotham</p>
<p>or something like that you know</p>
<p>it was always hard for me too when i first</p>
<p>started out to</p>
<p>clean it up for like a 10</p>
<p>minute set or a</p>
<p>seven minute set</p>
<p>seven minutes sets are hard in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like just getting a joke out it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>fuck you know you when you want</p>
<p>to do a set you want to open up get there get their</p>
<p>respect get some</p>
<p>laughs and then slowly settle into your view of things</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that in ten minutes man</p>
<p>in ten minutes you got to slam them</p>
<p>with some shit and then just get the fuck out of there</p>
<p>and you know that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that ari hasn&rsquo;t done yet he hasn&rsquo;t really really</p>
<p>knocked one out of the park and then got</p>
<p>a half an hour commie central special and then got an</p>
<p>hours commie</p>
<p>central special and</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t do enough</p>
<p>updating on his website either he&rsquo;s i mean</p>
<p>you know i was</p>
<p>look i&rsquo;ve had a website</p>
<p>since 1998 and there&rsquo;s thousands of blog entries</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m a busy guy you gotta</p>
<p>write things you</p>
<p>gotta give people</p>
<p>things like twitter</p>
<p>look i write a lot of shit on twitter</p>
<p>is like hey the podcast is about to</p>
<p>start or hey you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to do this gig</p>
<p>or hey you know come see me here</p>
<p>but a lot of the rest of it is just me writing</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>i think are</p>
<p>funny and interesting or</p>
<p>some link that somebody</p>
<p>sent me that&rsquo;s interesting i&rsquo;m retweeting it and</p>
<p>i want it entertaining</p>
<p>i wanna make sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>entertaining</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a part of that</p>
<p>whole system of</p>
<p>promoting yourself of getting yourself out there or</p>
<p>being able to work</p>
<p>and ari hasn&rsquo;t really embraced that</p>
<p>you know he embraced the twitter a little bit he writes</p>
<p>funny tweets</p>
<p>every now and</p>
<p>then but he needs to be like real pro active</p>
<p>like his website</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s got a wife and</p>
<p>kids and a job and an excuse to not be doing all this</p>
<p>stuff you know</p>
<p>but at least he&rsquo;s doing his podcast on your desk</p>
<p>squad network</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>skeptic tank if you&rsquo;re looking for it that&rsquo;s what ari</p>
<p>calls it and it&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been on it</p>
<p>mayhem miller&rsquo;s been on it he had with</p>
<p>steve on his</p>
<p>no no that was</p>
<p>not a show but yeah</p>
<p>mayhem they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under death</p>
<p>squads has gone itunes a subscribe to</p>
<p>death squad has made</p>
<p>ari&rsquo;s it has sam tripoli&rsquo;s</p>
<p>podcast tom seguro who was on yesterday they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>grouped into one podcast yeah and</p>
<p>think about that man you would have</p>
<p>never thought you&rsquo;d be doing something like that</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>how crazy is that you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird is that the whole</p>
<p>thing is that when i was in</p>
<p>middle school you had</p>
<p>something like a high</p>
<p>school a freshman in high</p>
<p>school you had a</p>
<p>shadow of the day job</p>
<p>where you picked</p>
<p>what you wanted to be when you grew up and you shadowed</p>
<p>them for a day</p>
<p>right so i shadowed a</p>
<p>radio station because i wanted to be a</p>
<p>radio dj and i</p>
<p>shadowed the morning zoo</p>
<p>wnci 979 was the dave buster douglas one</p>
<p>and they had buster douglas on the</p>
<p>radio station i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before but yeah a long time ago</p>
<p>yeah but it was</p>
<p>crazy because we actually buster douglas</p>
<p>knocked out tyson yeah</p>
<p>we were actually in columbus ohio</p>
<p>like when we did your dvd special and we are on that</p>
<p>radio show and the guy was</p>
<p>still working</p>
<p>as a dj and i was like you know what you were</p>
<p>the guy that</p>
<p>when i was a kid that i hung out with this guy all day</p>
<p>took me to breakfast took me to</p>
<p>lunch and now</p>
<p>wow now look at this it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m an</p>
<p>adult and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still here that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird adult you</p>
<p>still here that&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>yeah no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting what podcasting has become</p>
<p>you know ariel hawani</p>
<p>and i did his</p>
<p>podcast yesterday and i did it through skype</p>
<p>which is pretty badass i did the video</p>
<p>portion of it through skype</p>
<p>and i just used the</p>
<p>microphone and</p>
<p>listened to the headsets and i&rsquo;m like this is</p>
<p>crazy and we&rsquo;re doing it in real time and it</p>
<p>sounds awesome</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>sounded really clear</p>
<p>sound clear</p>
<p>sounded great yeah</p>
<p>you know you can</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>world man we live in a different</p>
<p>world and we got</p>
<p>lucky we snuck in</p>
<p>right on the ground</p>
<p>floor you know</p>
<p>totally never</p>
<p>expected that i remember all these</p>
<p>other people were doing podcasts at the time because</p>
<p>i did adam carolla&rsquo;s podcast way before i even</p>
<p>moved to colorado</p>
<p>you know i had done it</p>
<p>and i still</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t done my own well it&rsquo;s podcasts in general it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird how they used to be popular like four years ago</p>
<p>like when they</p>
<p>first came out and ipods just</p>
<p>first came out</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>it was huge for</p>
<p>oh no like who</p>
<p>were the huge ones back then</p>
<p>i remember kevin rose and all those guys</p>
<p>from techtv had</p>
<p>kevin roosevelt is he the guy</p>
<p>started dig</p>
<p>yeah same guy same guy</p>
<p>kevin rose yeah</p>
<p>crazy bastard</p>
<p>follow him he&rsquo;s got some ideas well now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not with dig anymore and everyone&rsquo;s pissed because they</p>
<p>he pretty much digs</p>
<p>supposedly gone to shit</p>
<p>since he left and that one&rsquo;s mad at him i</p>
<p>guess well that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard oh kevin</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been following i like dig</p>
<p>still i use dig all the time i like dig</p>
<p>dig com if you&rsquo;ve never been</p>
<p>is an excellent portal for interesting stories</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s always like i will</p>
<p>scroll through the</p>
<p>first four or five pages and</p>
<p>every time i do it you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always something interesting that pops up that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i got that billboard</p>
<p>story and you know there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>charlie sheen</p>
<p>asking for custody of his twins</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s the fucking perfect</p>
<p>thing to happen</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>the end of the podcast</p>
<p>for this goddamn</p>
<p>phone to ring because i</p>
<p>never turn it off</p>
<p>malibu malibu here malibu please malibu california</p>
<p>all right sorry</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen for that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>sort of an inside</p>
<p>joke on this podcast that i&rsquo;m a retard i</p>
<p>never turn my fucking phone off</p>
<p>the real problem is i&rsquo;m always usually on the</p>
<p>phone right up</p>
<p>until the time we start</p>
<p>and then does</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of them and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cordless you know so they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>floating around i</p>
<p>never know where the fuck they are</p>
<p>and i usually just pull the plug out of the wall</p>
<p>i did it yesterday</p>
<p>actually plugged it back in</p>
<p>right before the</p>
<p>show today because i had to make a call</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t give a fuck and i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t either</p>
<p>the point is we&rsquo;ve done this for a hundred episodes now</p>
<p>give me some knuckles</p>
<p>we had a good time</p>
<p>red band and i have</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve more than</p>
<p>surpassed our</p>
<p>expectations i</p>
<p>never had any</p>
<p>going into and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you did either no</p>
<p>never thought it</p>
<p>would be like this i thought this was actually</p>
<p>going to last a month</p>
<p>i thought like you&rsquo;d get sick of it a month and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the craziest</p>
<p>thing about that you still</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>still do it</p>
<p>i thought for sure</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty good at doing</p>
<p>things once i get</p>
<p>started i&rsquo;m pretty good at</p>
<p>sticking to em but</p>
<p>when i realized it was</p>
<p>crazy when i realized that</p>
<p>weird things was happening</p>
<p>was when i asked the crowd in boston</p>
<p>i did the wilbur theatre</p>
<p>this is pack sold out</p>
<p>and i go how many and eddie bravo was there</p>
<p>and i yelled out to eddie cause i had my</p>
<p>tenth planet jujutsu shirt on</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>tenth planet in the</p>
<p>house then i and i yelled</p>
<p>out how many guys listen to podcast and they went</p>
<p>fucking crazy</p>
<p>it was like ninety percent of the</p>
<p>crowd i was like whoa really really</p>
<p>and then i realized that i&rsquo;m like somewhere</p>
<p>along the route</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s why these</p>
<p>crowds have been cooler lately</p>
<p>like over the last like six months</p>
<p>the crowds have gotten noticeably</p>
<p>cooler and they were always cool they were always</p>
<p>cool there was always a huge percentage of cool people</p>
<p>but there was</p>
<p>always people that didn&rsquo;t know what i was up to</p>
<p>and they were just</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a fear</p>
<p>factor ufc or whatever</p>
<p>jamie kennedy wasn&rsquo;t in town so they went to see me</p>
<p>you know what i mean it&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what they&rsquo;re doing they&rsquo;re just wandering in there</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely changed like in philly the</p>
<p>whole crowd it&rsquo;s all podcast fans</p>
<p>as they find out</p>
<p>about the show long before everybody else</p>
<p>that show was sold out a</p>
<p>month before we were ever there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s never happened to me before</p>
<p>the best case</p>
<p>scenario was like the last time i was in philly</p>
<p>which was like a year ago</p>
<p>we sold it all out</p>
<p>just before</p>
<p>i got there but this was sold out like way before that</p>
<p>you know so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i did an extra show you did more stuff than</p>
<p>shut the fuck up</p>
<p>god damn it</p>
<p>who is this</p>
<p>again same thing</p>
<p>hang up on there</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about them that&rsquo;s how i roll</p>
<p>all right ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>at that note i apologize for the</p>
<p>phone this won&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>after episode 100</p>
